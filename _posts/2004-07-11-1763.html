That was my entertainment as a college student. I used to hang out in the  <br/>
school laundromat. I would sit and watch the freshmen guys who had just learned  <br/>
&quot;last week&quot; how to do laundry. They&#39;d actually use a measuring cup and <br/>
measure  the soap *exactly* to the line. They would carefully sort their laundry by  <br/>
colors into three washers. They&#39;d check the water temperature. They&#39;d remove  <br/>
each piece from the washer and shake it out before placing it in the dryer.  <br/>
They&#39;d remove each piece from the dryer and fold it carefully before placing <br/>
it  back in the basket.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course I could always tell the seniors: they would dump the whole load  <br/>
into one washer, pour the detergent in from the box, keep whatever temperature  <br/>
setting that it was on, leave for an hour---probably having a beer or two, <br/>
come  back and toss it all into the dryer, leave for a few more beers, and come <br/>
back  to throw it all in a duffle bag! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

Have you tried doing housework with a song in your heart?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Corny, yes. But I&#39;m serious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you done housework because you want to make a clean, safe, pleasant place to live for the ones you adore the most? Have your children seen that attitude for several years?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How do unschoolers get their kids to do chores? For that matter, how do we<br/>
keep our homes clean if we&#39;re not one of the high-energy do-it-all-yourself<br/>
types?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I AM one of those &quot; high-energy do-it-all-yourself&quot; types. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t make my children do much of anything. I DO ask, and they are happy to help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s because I changed the way *I* looked at cleaning. I took the advice from unschooling moms years and years ago and chose to view housecleaning as a gift I give my family. The miraculous result was that MY CHILDREN also see cleaning as a gift they can give to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can stand a little bit of a mess, but dishes piled up all over the kitchen<br/>
and strewn about the house is another story. Not tolerable! It makes for a<br/>
depressed mama when I come out in the morning to find the kitchen a complete<br/>
junk yard when I want to make breakfast. We, dh and I, have tried setting an<br/>
example by cleaning up after ourselves consistently - that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
help either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t say how old your children are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the result of my &quot;cleaning gift&quot; is that I often wake up to a clean kitchen. &lt;g&gt; The boys, who are occasionally up later Â than I am, will be &quot;elves&quot; and clean the rooms I&#39;m not in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But it took years and years of MY doing that FOR THEM. But they&#39;re just following my lead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figure that, if I had continued to do the same as the conventional parents around here, I would have children who were always expecting someone *else* to do things for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you and your husband always cleaning up after the children too? Or are they responsible for their own messes?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband can stand far less than I, but he can&#39;t do it all himself because<br/>
he works long hours and is bushed by the time he&#39;s home for the night (yes,<br/>
&quot;night&quot; - he works late).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So are you home?<br/>

It&#39;s ALL about attitude. I cannot stress that enough. You apparently hate cleaning---and you&#39;ll be passing that attitude on to your children. Don&#39;t think you won&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the baggage I want to pass on to my kids. Remember---one carry-on, not a complete set of Samsonite! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The more clearly *you* can see housekeeping and food and sleep and learning, the better your children&#39;s view!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Besides I don&#39;t want to live in a pig sty, but I don&#39;t have the energy to<br/>

<br/>
Hire a maid. Seriously. If it&#39;s that bad, consider what you&#39;d have to do without in order to have someone clean it for you.<br/>
<br/>
A good maid can do it in a few HOURS.<br/>

Do a search for chores or cleaning. It comes up every two months or so---its a BIGGIE on this list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535785966">I know one thing that really helps me is to focus on what they do instead of<br/>
what they are not doing that you want them to. I am grateful when Malila<br/>
(11) plays with the baby so I can put away groceries or when Easy (5) helps<br/>
do dishes or when Zola (1) helps with laundry. Sometime when I come into the<br/>
computer room in the morning after Malila has been up all night I shake my<br/>
head at the mess. She sometimes leaves everything behind, a juice cup and<br/>
something from her snacks. But I am grateful that we have juice and snacks.<br/>
I am grateful that she isn&#39;t afraid of me and scared to leave a mess for<br/>
fear of bring harmed. I am happy she is alive so that I can pick up after<br/>
her. It is an act of service. I view acts of service as a way to show love.<br/>

not impossible) to let go of seeing my dh and kids in this way. It doesn&#39;t<br/>

things to be safe and out of the way of harm (ie not on the floor). My home<br/>
is no showcase by any means but it generally works for us. I take it one<br/>
space at a time. I find that I need a calm space of my own so I generally<br/>
work on my bedroom first and use my efforts to keep that up a priority. That<br/>
way if I feel stressed in the common areas I have a retreat. After that I<br/>
need the kitchen space clean. We all like to eat, lol. Then I find the<br/>
TV/video game room and/or the playroom need the most attention. I clean<br/>
these rooms because I want my kids to have a clean pallette to create in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575870810">And can i add that often unschooled children will do chores when they  <br/>
see that it&#39;s necessary? As Joyce mentioned, if a parent is being  <br/>
nitpicky about things that really are not that important, then they  <br/>
don&#39;t see a need outside of that of the parent to have it done their  <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
We recently had a mouse invasion. Serious mouse invasion, I think  <br/>
we&#39;ve caught seven or eight...and our house isn&#39;t really cluttered.  <br/>
It&#39;s not dirty or messy or anything, but they really saw a need to  <br/>
clean out cabinets and shelves and repackage our dry goods into  <br/>
airtight storage. It is amazing HOW CLEAN our garage is...Josh really  <br/>
worked hard to get rid of potential mouse buffet or nesting. Their  <br/>
closets are not quite martha stewart, but i think i&#39;d puke if they  <br/>
were lol!<br/>
<br/>
And I really could not do it (second necessary) I&#39;m pregnant and  <br/>
supposedly on bedrest. I could NOT pull stuff out and clean and  <br/>
organize. I would do one pot, and be exhausted and crampy and have to  <br/>
lay down for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
So it really does happen...when we can compromise on standards (as  <br/>
Joyce said, if the standards are our own, what is the motivation for  <br/>
them?) and not see chores as some domestic slavery ourselves, we can  <br/>
enjoy the time spent with our kids, and they enjoy it in return. Lots  <br/>
of times I&#39;m the one doing dishes while the kids sit and keep me  <br/>
company. I like that, and so do they. We love cranking up the music  <br/>
when we know we have company over. WHich is often.<br/>

<br/>
What exactly do you mean when you use the words &quot;don&#39;t/doesn&#39;t <br/>

work&quot;  to accomplish what?  <br/>
<br/>
Is the goal to get household tasks done? <br/>
Is it to get the kids to share in the household tasks?<br/>
Is it to get the kids to see the value in having a tidy space/house?<br/>
Is it to eliminate some of your workload by sharing the load with <br/>
someone else?<br/>
Is it to help the kids understand that when you live with other <br/>

entitlement issues?<br/>
Is it to make you happier because you don&#39;t function as well in <br/>
disorder?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really have to answer here.  Although if you did, someone <br/>
might be able to give you ways that those things you listed might <br/>
work, depending on what you are trying to accomplish.  The answer <br/>
might be one or a combination of the things I listed.  Or it might be <br/>
something completely different.  I know I had to really reevaluate <br/>
what I was trying to accomplish.  Not just with chores, but with any <br/>
demand or rule or restriction I might have had.  The hardest thing to <br/>
swallow is the idea that I might have been making those demands or <br/>
rules or restrictions for no other real reason than that they made <br/>
things more convenient for me.  <br/>
<br/>
~~~How do unschoolers get their kids to do chores? For that matter, <br/>
how do we<br/>
keep our homes clean if we&#39;re not one of the high-energy do-it-all-<br/>
yourself types?~~~<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to get kids to help out around the house is to <br/>
not expect them to, ever. Never make it a battle.  It would be best <br/>
if it were a non issue from the very day they were born.  Just keep <br/>
cleaning up.    <br/>
<br/>
ButÂmost people start out in a much more mainstream place.  So then, <br/>
if they find their way to unschooling, they have to undo the damage <br/>
that has already been done.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really answer your question about how to keep the house clean <br/>
if you aren&#39;t one of the high energy do it yourself types.  When I <br/>
was threatening/bribing/punishing to get my kids to do chores it had <br/>
much less to do with keeping the house clean than it did with my fear <br/>
that they were going to grow up and see housework in the same way I <br/>
did.  I&#39;m working to change my perception of housework, so that I can <br/>
have a clean house without resenting the work I have to do to have <br/>
it.  If you are really just looking to have a clean house but can&#39;t <br/>
or don&#39;t want to do it yourself, hire someone to do it or change how <br/>
you feel about having a clean house.  Own it as being your issue.  <br/>
Don&#39;t make it an issue for your children too. <br/>
<br/>
~~~I can stand a little bit of a mess, but dishes piled up all over <br/>
the kitchen<br/>
and strewn about the house is another story. Not tolerable! It makes <br/>
for a depressed mama when I come out in the morning to find the <br/>
kitchen a complete junk yard when I want to make breakfast. We, dh <br/>
and I, have tried setting an example by cleaning up after ourselves <br/>
consistently - that doesn&#39;t seem to help either.~~~<br/>
<br/>
Not tolerable for who?  It must not be bothering them if they are <br/>
leaving it that way.  This is your issue.  There are all kinds of <br/>
things that would &quot;work&quot; to get your kids to clean up the kitchen or <br/>
whatever.  But they aren&#39;t going to support an unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.  They aren&#39;t going to foster joy, love, and respect.  <br/>
<br/>
~~~My husband can stand far less than I, but he can&#39;t do it all <br/>
himself because he works long hours and is bushed by the time he&#39;s <br/>
home for the night (yes, &quot;night&quot; - he works late).~~~<br/>
<br/>
Could  your husband do a quick clean up of the kitchen before he goes <br/>
to bed if he is up late?  Do you go to bed before your kids and then <br/>
they eat and make a mess, leaving it for you in the morning?  Or are <br/>
is this accumulating over the day and you are wanting/expecting your <br/>
kids to clean it all up?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~All of the things we&#39;ve tried have been over years of trying, <br/>
implementing, failing. <br/>
<br/>
Trying, implementing, failing to do what?~~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~I don&#39;t want to be passive-aggressive about it, but that&#39;s usually<br/>
how I end up when I wind up having to clean the kitchen in the <br/>
mornings just so I can sanely make myself some breakfast.~~~<br/>
<br/>
I understand how you feel.  I struggle with not feeling resentful <br/>
that my family can&#39;t just pick up their stuff.  If everyone would <br/>
just put their plate in the dishwasher, or their paper in the garbage <br/>
every thing would be cool, I tell myself and on a bad day, them.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t help me to have the kind of relationship that I want with my <br/>
kids though.  I have to actively work to let go of those feelings.  <br/>
<br/>
~~~Besides I don&#39;t want to live in a pig sty, but I don&#39;t have the <br/>
energy to make the house clean by myself. Not day, not n a week.~~~<br/>
<br/>
These are your issues.  Not your kids.  They aren&#39;t bothered by the <br/>
pigsty and it seems, they are choosing to use their energy on other <br/>
things.  Probably fun things.  They probably don&#39;t see cleaning up as <br/>
fun.  It doesn&#39;t seem like something you enjoy either.  Maybe if you <br/>
changed your view of housework they would change theirs?  That is <br/>
what is working for me to have the kind of relationship I am striving <br/>
for with my children, and once in a while I get a clean house out of <br/>
it too.  <br/>

&gt; disorder?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of the above, really. But if I wanted to be very specific I&#39;d say<br/>
it&#39;s mostly: to get household tasks done, eliminate some of my<br/>
workload by sharing the load with someone else, and to help the kids<br/>
understand that when you live with other people you have a<br/>
responsibility to others.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else asked in a roundabout way what ages my kids are. They&#39;re<br/>
13 yrs, 12 yrs and 2 mos. I don&#39;t expect the 2 month old to do<br/>
anything except be cute and make more work (diapers, laundry).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The hardest thing to<br/>

&gt; rules or restrictions for no other real reason than that they made<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is, of course, an element of that too for me and moreso for my<br/>
husband. But dh gets a little &quot;nutso&quot; in a messy-house situation, and<br/>
as I mentioned before he hasn&#39;t the time to make it the way he wants<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I can tolerate more of a mess than he, but I have issues<br/>
with the kitchen and bathroom being a mess. The trouble is, I am<br/>
clinically depressed (Major Depression, diagnosed & treated,<br/>
hereditary), and that shows up mostly in the physical for me. I just<br/>
don&#39;t have the energy and it&#39;s not about changing my attitude. I can<br/>
change my attitude until I&#39;m blue in the face but that doesn&#39;t change<br/>
the fact that my body is just not on board with doing a lot of things<br/>
- and I already do a lot for someone with my limitations. I have had<br/>
to find coping mechanisms that really work for me, those things are<br/>
gardening, bird-watching, cooking/baking, and knitting & crocheting.<br/>
And it&#39;s not as though I don&#39;t set about doing chores myself. I<br/>
voluntarily go about laundry day(s), daily washing of diapers, picking<br/>
up after the kids and dh, mending clothes and costumes, knitting or<br/>
crocheting wearable items for the family, making nice meals for the<br/>
family, and so on rather joyfully, oftentimes singing while I do them.<br/>
The kids see this. Do they join in or follow along? No.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my dd does clean her own room periodically of her own volition,<br/>
and she cares for her snake in a way that makes me think she&#39;ll be an<br/>
excellent, doting mother one day if she chooses. And so I know she&#39;s<br/>
picking something good up from me.<br/>
<br/>
My older ds, however, (and  he&#39;s 12), will leave things to go until,<br/>
for example, his room was so messy the cats had been using it as a<br/>
litter box. He finally cleaned his room to get rid of the smell, only<br/>
the smell had set in he let it go so long. He has to be reminded - and<br/>
I hate that I feel compelled to do this - to take a shower, for<br/>
another example. I love him to pieces, but i don&#39;t want to be<br/>
physically near him if his body odor is repulsive. Hygiene is another<br/>
important topic to me, but that&#39;s probably another email for another<br/>
time.<br/>

But we can&#39;t afford one. :-( One of our cars just blew its head<br/>

and scrimping so as to save up for another second/family car. We&#39;re<br/>
getting by in dh&#39;s economy commuting car for the next few months. Four<br/>
adult sized people and a baby in a Mazda3. *blinkblink* ...not that a<br/>
maid is an expense we can reasonably justify anyway. DH keeps the<br/>
books, not me (thankgod!).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm... But y&#39;know, I don&#39;t go into their rooms and leave my dirty<br/>

originally talking about the common areas, but the analogy does apply<br/>
to a degree.<br/>

that it did work. His putting on TMBG and doing various household<br/>
chores with the kids did seem effective. This was at night after I&#39;d<br/>
gone to bed. I&#39;m a morning person, the rest of the household members<br/>
are night owls. He has since gotten behind with the financial end of<br/>
keeping our house running and so has gone back to that to catch up.<br/>
Meanwhile, I still go to bed around 9 with the baby, and the next<br/>
morning  I find dirty dishes left around the living room and kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
I cook and clean up after myself while I&#39;m cooking. They cook for<br/>
themselves and leave the mess to sit. I&#39;m just not seeing the setting<br/>
an example and showing respect working. I feel taken advantage of,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to answer, since we&#39;ve had a pretty hard week, made so by my<br/>
insistence on getting help cleaning the house.  Then I&#39;m going to<br/>
paste my blog post for today here, in hopes of getting further help! <br/>
I do want the kids to see the value in having a tidy space, simply<br/>
because we all are losing things all the time!  I think if it were<br/>
kept up, and we had particular homes for all of our stuff, it would be<br/>
easier to live.  And yes, to make me happier because I don&#39;t function<br/>
well in disorder.  Here is the blog post I just made about it:<br/>
<br/>
We had our worst day yesterday since we jumped into radical<br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;ve been reading about Chores on a radical unschooling<br/>
list serve.  From that, I see that a mistake I might have made <br/>
jumping into this was verbally &quot;lifting all controls.&quot;  My kids are<br/>
very confused right now.    They hear me saying that they are free to<br/>
say no, but they see me struggling with it, and basically not really<br/>
meaning it yet.   It is an unschooling philosophy, IF I am<br/>
understanding it correctly, that the NEED for a neat and tidy or clean<br/>
house is the issue of the person that has that need. LOL I keep asking<br/>
myself, what kid would want to clean up all these overwhelming piles<br/>
of toys, dishes, etc., if I can&#39;t even get up the willpower to do it?<br/>
 It doesn&#39;t keep me from falling into my familiar victim role of &quot;i<br/>
can&#39;t do it all by myself!&quot;  I even had a small epiphany a week or so<br/>
ago about how I really do feel awesome when I have a clean house, and<br/>
so it would be worth it for me to just get over it and get it done. <br/>
Everything becomes very black and white to me when I am in a<br/>
victim/panic/really-need-it-my-way-now-mode, so I officially told the<br/>
kids about 3 days ago,  that we are not radically unschooling with<br/>
chores anymore.  LOL   For two days we have been sorting through<br/>
overturned toy boxes, with trash bags in the boys bedrooms, etc.  Oh,<br/>
by the way, their rooms have been that way since we moved in!  I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to unpack everything, because I wanted the house to keep<br/>
that brand new clean feeling to it! Haha!  So of course, having all<br/>
those boxes hidden in their closets made it all the more fulfilling<br/>
for them to dump them!!  Piles of disorganized chaos fill me with an<br/>
overwhelming panicky feeling that I can&#39;t even describe. Anway.  I<br/>
cleaned my room first, still trying to keep with the &quot;model the<br/>
behavior&quot; mantra I have going on.  In between errands and gymnastics,<br/>
while we were home, we turned on music and worked together and it<br/>
ended up being a fun time.  Before I reinstated the Chore Patrol<br/>
(haha!), I was an angry, yelling, giving up on unschooling Mama, all<br/>
to end up with a bunch of dancing happy kids that are helping me<br/>
clean.   What I&#39;m trying to remember to do, to keep in my head, is How<br/>
can I skip the whole yelling, screaming and demanding part of things? <br/>
<br/>
And a bit more, off the top of my head. I have Naomi Aldort&#39;s book,<br/>
and after my whole fiasco, I took it out to read it and could have<br/>
just banged my head against a wall, I was so upset that the key thing<br/>
that may have helped me, I FORGOT to do.  (the whole taking a moment<br/>
to pause and just thinking through the yelling, etc., instead of<br/>
actually doing it!  argh!)  In talking with friends, I have been<br/>
reminded that I tend to let things that bother me go on way past the<br/>
point of upset, and if I could catch it sooner, I could deal with it<br/>
internally and not explode on everyone else.  Any pointers on what I<br/>
can do to remind me to do the pause?  Thank goodness my children are<br/>
incredibly forgiving and move on easily!  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
PLEASE give this a try. Find someone to do some of the work around the  <br/>
house for you and your kids. When the house is already neater and more  <br/>
orderly, you&#39;ll find that the kids will help more with keeping it that  <br/>
way and you won&#39;t be as tense about it and your husband will be  <br/>
happier. I bet you can find $40 a week to pay someone to come in and  <br/>
clean up for a few hours a week and it will make a HUGE difference to  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the hygiene thing - it is SUPER common for kids to not want to  <br/>
shower at your son&#39;s age. I don&#39;t know why, but it is just very very  <br/>
common. Try to relax about it.  Be honest with him about the smell -  <br/>
if there really IS smell, do him the favor of telling him and giving  <br/>
him ideas of how to deal with it. Give him some baby wipes to use  <br/>
under his arms. maybe. But if there is no smell, just let it go. It  <br/>
WILL pass. He will most like move into a phase in which he will spend  <br/>
LOTS of time in the shower - lots and lots! &lt;G&gt; Don&#39;t bug him about  <br/>
that, either, when the time comes!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>RIGHT. It IS overwhelming. So  - my husband is really good at &quot;make it  <br/>
approachable&quot; - he does this even for me sometimes, when the kitchen  <br/>
gets overwhelming. He just goes in and does some of the work. He  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have the need to totally finish what he started, to  <br/>
end up with a sparkling clean kitchen with the sink washed and  <br/>
counters and floor cleaned. When &quot;I&quot; do the dishes, I end up cleaning  <br/>
the stove. He doesn&#39;t even clean the sink or wipe off the counters.  <br/>
Because he doesn&#39;t seem to see the huge job that needs doing, but just  <br/>
notices that we&#39;re short of clean dishes, he can go in and do a bunch  <br/>
of dishes. When he does that, it makes the job look less overwhelming  <br/>
to me and I go in and do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe do that for the kids. Do the first half of a job and ask  <br/>
them for help to finish it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571232892">I have found that if I ask for them to help it needs to be a small thing. I<br/>
break things up into 15 minute quick jobs. I just make a list of what I<br/>
think needs to be done and then ask them if they will help with some.<br/>
Saturday I was feeling crappy and the house was a mess. We all sat down I<br/>
talked about feeling really grumpy and really needing the house to be clean.<br/>
We all wrote a list of what we wanted to be finished to have a clean house.<br/>
The kids and dh and I all picked jobs and set a timer. We worked for 15<br/>
minutes and then took a small break 5-10 minute. Then we picked another<br/>
task. We did this for a couple hours. Ds 5 wandered away after a couple jobs<br/>
and dd 11 lasted over a hour. And they both played with the baby so I could<br/>

because they didn&#39;t feel overwhelmed and had options. They were free to stop<br/>
if they wanted to. DS cleaned (extra cleaned as he says) the windows...he<br/>
used a full bottle of vinegar :-) And that job wasn&#39;t even on the list! It<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; RIGHT. It IS overwhelming. So - my husband is really good at &quot;make it<br/>
&gt; approachable&quot; - he does this even for me sometimes, when the kitchen<br/>
&gt; gets overwhelming. He just goes in and does some of the work. He<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have the need to totally finish what he started, to<br/>
&gt; end up with a sparkling clean kitchen with the sink washed and<br/>
&gt; counters and floor cleaned. When &quot;I&quot; do the dishes, I end up cleaning<br/>
&gt; the stove. He doesn&#39;t even clean the sink or wipe off the counters.<br/>
&gt; Because he doesn&#39;t seem to see the huge job that needs doing, but just<br/>
&gt; notices that we&#39;re short of clean dishes, he can go in and do a bunch<br/>
&gt; of dishes. When he does that, it makes the job look less overwhelming<br/>
&gt; to me and I go in and do the rest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - maybe do that for the kids. Do the first half of a job and ask<br/>
&gt; them for help to finish it up.<br/>

As far as chores I generally just ask if we can pick up for a few <br/>

kicks in and in several minutes we can have the house presentable. <br/>

I also do most of the deep cleaning myself. If we are going to do a <br/>
room I have asked for help and I am always amazed how much we can get <br/>
done together. <br/>

Stacey, what are you doing about the depression? I have been battling<br/>
depression and anxiety for the better part of 7 years.  I can&#39;t say I<br/>
know you you feel.  But I know how it felt for me.  I also know that<br/>
somehow, you have to pull yourself up out of it, whether that be by<br/>
shear determination and willpower, or by taking something that will<br/>
give you the extra umph you need.  I just weaned off the<br/>
pharmaceutical antidepressant I had been on for over 5 years.  I am<br/>
taking a bunch of vitamins and supplements and making it work. E-mail<br/>
me personally if you&#39;d like suggestions on what to take.  I had the<br/>
help of a Medical Doctor that&#39;s very into natural remedies.  The<br/>
depression is gone, though I&#39;m having trouble sometimes with<br/>
anxiety..which often comes out as defensiveness on lists like this, LOL!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; What exactly do you mean when you use the words &quot;don&#39;t/doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; work&quot;. &quot;Chore charts with money and/or other incentives don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; work&quot; to accomplish what?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is the goal to get household tasks done?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to get the kids to share in the household tasks?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to get the kids to see the value in having a tidy space/house?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to eliminate some of your workload by sharing the load with<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone else?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to help the kids understand that when you live with other<br/>
&gt; &gt; people you have a responsibility to others?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to make the kids realize that they aren&#39;t going to get a free<br/>
&gt; &gt; ride from you. You aren&#39;t raising lazy, no good, kids with<br/>
&gt; &gt; entitlement issues?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it to make you happier because you don&#39;t function as well in<br/>
&gt; &gt; disorder?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of the above, really. But if I wanted to be very specific I&#39;d say<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s mostly: to get household tasks done, eliminate some of my<br/>
&gt; workload by sharing the load with someone else, and to help the kids<br/>
&gt; understand that when you live with other people you have a<br/>
&gt; responsibility to others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Someone else asked in a roundabout way what ages my kids are. They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; 13 yrs, 12 yrs and 2 mos. I don&#39;t expect the 2 month old to do<br/>
&gt; anything except be cute and make more work (diapers, laundry).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The hardest thing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; swallow is the idea that I might have been making those demands or<br/>
&gt; &gt; rules or restrictions for no other real reason than that they made<br/>
&gt; &gt; things more convenient for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is, of course, an element of that too for me and moreso for my<br/>
&gt; husband. But dh gets a little &quot;nutso&quot; in a messy-house situation, and<br/>
&gt; as I mentioned before he hasn&#39;t the time to make it the way he wants<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I can tolerate more of a mess than he, but I have issues<br/>
&gt; with the kitchen and bathroom being a mess. The trouble is, I am<br/>
&gt; clinically depressed (Major Depression, diagnosed & treated,<br/>
&gt; hereditary), and that shows up mostly in the physical for me. I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have the energy and it&#39;s not about changing my attitude. I can<br/>
&gt; change my attitude until I&#39;m blue in the face but that doesn&#39;t change<br/>
&gt; the fact that my body is just not on board with doing a lot of things<br/>
&gt; - and I already do a lot for someone with my limitations. I have had<br/>
&gt; to find coping mechanisms that really work for me, those things are<br/>
&gt; gardening, bird-watching, cooking/baking, and knitting & crocheting.<br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s not as though I don&#39;t set about doing chores myself. I<br/>
&gt; voluntarily go about laundry day(s), daily washing of diapers, picking<br/>
&gt; up after the kids and dh, mending clothes and costumes, knitting or<br/>
&gt; crocheting wearable items for the family, making nice meals for the<br/>
&gt; family, and so on rather joyfully, oftentimes singing while I do them.<br/>
&gt; The kids see this. Do they join in or follow along? No.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, my dd does clean her own room periodically of her own volition,<br/>
&gt; and she cares for her snake in a way that makes me think she&#39;ll be an<br/>
&gt; excellent, doting mother one day if she chooses. And so I know she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; picking something good up from me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My older ds, however, (and  he&#39;s 12), will leave things to go until,<br/>
&gt; for example, his room was so messy the cats had been using it as a<br/>
&gt; litter box. He finally cleaned his room to get rid of the smell, only<br/>
&gt; the smell had set in he let it go so long. He has to be reminded - and<br/>
&gt; I hate that I feel compelled to do this - to take a shower, for<br/>
&gt; another example. I love him to pieces, but i don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; physically near him if his body odor is repulsive. Hygiene is another<br/>
&gt; important topic to me, but that&#39;s probably another email for another<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the best way to get kids to help out around the house is to<br/>
&gt; &gt; not expect them to, ever. Never make it a battle. It would be best<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it were a non issue from the very day they were born. Just keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleaning up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...in a perfect world...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ButÂmost people start out in a much more mainstream place. So then,<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they find their way to unschooling, they have to undo the damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; that has already been done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which is why I&#39;m asking. I don&#39;t really want to let this go as a<br/>
&gt; damaging thing or as a forceful thing or as a battle or something by<br/>
&gt; which the kids and I alienate ourselves one from the other. Would like<br/>
&gt; to find an amenable solution!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; it. If you are really just looking to have a clean house but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; or don&#39;t want to do it yourself, hire someone to do it or change how<br/>
&gt; &gt; you feel about having a clean house. Own it as being your issue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t make it an issue for your children too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Someone else also suggested I might hire a maid. That&#39;s a great idea!<br/>
&gt; But we can&#39;t afford one. :-( One of our cars just blew its head<br/>
&gt; gaskets and it&#39;s not a repair we can afford, so we&#39;re down to one car<br/>
&gt; and scrimping so as to save up for another second/family car. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; getting by in dh&#39;s economy commuting car for the next few months. Four<br/>
&gt; adult sized people and a baby in a Mazda3. *blinkblink* ...not that a<br/>
&gt; maid is an expense we can reasonably justify anyway. DH keeps the<br/>
&gt; books, not me (thankgod!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not tolerable for who? It must not be bothering them if they are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, me, of course. I know full well this is my issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving it that way. This is your issue. There are all kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; things that would &quot;work&quot; to get your kids to clean up the kitchen or<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever. But they aren&#39;t going to support an unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; lifestyle. They aren&#39;t going to foster joy, love, and respect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm... But y&#39;know, I don&#39;t go into their rooms and leave my dirty<br/>
&gt; dishes, clothes and shoes laying about. I realize that I was<br/>
&gt; originally talking about the common areas, but the analogy does apply<br/>
&gt; to a degree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Could your husband do a quick clean up of the kitchen before he goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; to bed if he is up late? Do you go to bed before your kids and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; they eat and make a mess, leaving it for you in the morning? Or are<br/>
&gt; &gt; is this accumulating over the day and you are wanting/expecting your<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids to clean it all up?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DH had been doing chores with them for a short while and he reported<br/>
&gt; that it did work. His putting on TMBG and doing various household<br/>
&gt; chores with the kids did seem effective. This was at night after I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; gone to bed. I&#39;m a morning person, the rest of the household members<br/>
&gt; are night owls. He has since gotten behind with the financial end of<br/>
&gt; keeping our house running and so has gone back to that to catch up.<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, I still go to bed around 9 with the baby, and the next<br/>
&gt; morning  I find dirty dishes left around the living room and kitchen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I cook and clean up after myself while I&#39;m cooking. They cook for<br/>
&gt; themselves and leave the mess to sit. I&#39;m just not seeing the setting<br/>
&gt; an example and showing respect working. I feel taken advantage of,<br/>
&gt; like they know if they make a mess I&#39;m going to clean it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; fun. It doesn&#39;t seem like something you enjoy either. Maybe if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed your view of housework they would change theirs? That is<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which view is that? I addressed this above re: depression, its<br/>
&gt; physical manifestation, and attitude changes. Also addressed above the<br/>
&gt; chores I do happily.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; what is working for me to have the kind of relationship I am striving<br/>
&gt; &gt; for with my children, and once in a while I get a clean house out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; it too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like that (all of it! :-) too.<br/>

teen who is willing to work for $5 for an hour or two per week.<br/>

But, that said, to many people, $40 is less than they spend on fast  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138644827">I know I am new and this is my first post here but I just wanted to<br/>
chime in with my experince with trying to find someone other then my<br/>
family to help. I have similar issues to the OP and little to no<br/>

<br/>
We can&#39;t really afford a maid either but it got to the point and still<br/>
is at that point were something had to give. I First tried with<br/>
finding someone to get together and clean each others houses. I got a<br/>
few people who were interested but no one was ever willing to commit<br/>
so it never happened. I did get offers of people who were willing to<br/>
come over and throw all our stuff away with little regard to what was<br/>
tossed and that did not seem like what we wanted either.<br/>
<br/>
So I looked into getting a maid. I called around and soon found that<br/>
all the maid services would be useless as I would have to do the part<br/>
that is overwhelming me in order to do the part they do which is<br/>
actually the part I like to do but never get to do due to the<br/>
overwhelming parts. So I looked into self employed maids and even had<br/>
a couple come over to give me an estimate on a day when the house was<br/>
pretty good I thought. I was told &quot;I would not even know where to<br/>
start call me when you get rid of the mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I gave in to having my MIL come up and help us get the house<br/>
organized so that maybe I could handle it and at least find things or<br/>
maybe get to the point where a maid would be willing to actually do<br/>
what her job title indicates. I mean she kept decent house so it<br/>
seemed a logical choice. Unfortunately she insisted the house be clean<br/>
before she starts organizing it and subscribes to the children are<br/>
slave labor mentality. Problem is if things do not have homes its<br/>
awful hard to put things away. SO while it was cleaner while she was<br/>
here it did not solve the over all issue. <br/>
<br/>
So I am at a huge loss here. I can&#39;t do it by myself. I used to try<br/>
with my kids following me undoing everything practically as soon as I<br/>
did it, Spending my whole life futilely failing to achieve a minimal<br/>
standard of cleanliness and feeling like nothing but a failure. I<br/>
could clean house all day taking out several bags of garbage and it<br/>
would look like I did nothing when my husband got home from work. Any<br/>
joy I had in cleaning was completely destroyed. I now hate and resent<br/>
cleaning house and feel like it is a futile life sucking activity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is how do you find a maid that is willing to actually<br/>
clean a messy house?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913537253">I am not the neatest or tidiest or most organized. I try to do the best I<br/>
can. One thing I have learned is take it small. I clean each room for only<br/>
15 minutes than break for at least that long. I have a 13 month old so I<br/>
understand how frustrating that can be. My ds5 will at times help and other<br/>
times raze, lol. I have learned to laugh. Although I do need to remind<br/>
myself of that from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend breaking your project into small parts that might take around 15<br/>
minutes. If you living room is so cluttered you can&#39;t use it like a living<br/>
room start there. Get a bunch of bins and start sorting for 15 minutes. Or<br/>
start with just trash removal. If your kids are old enough make it a game<br/>
somehow. Sometimes I have pirates that with search for treasure (trash) and<br/>
get a big bag of booty. Yes this makes the chore take longer but the journey<br/>
is as important as the end. Then move on to taking everything that doesn&#39;t<br/>
belong in that room to where it belongs. If you want to get rid of stuff as<br/>
well. Or box up some stuff for a while until you get a better handle on<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I remember you mentioning things not having homes. You need to create them.<br/>
Buy or make shelves. Buy or find boxes (even free boxes from the liquor<br/>
store). Label the boxes. Making homes is the first step. If you need more<br/>
help with that ask a specific question.<br/>
<br/>
This might sound crazy but I love to watch Clean House. I have been so<br/>
inspired by that show. I love to see how they swoop in and make everything<br/>
orderly and nice. Now I don&#39;t want my house show room pretty so I am happy<br/>
with our &quot;lived in&quot; look, lol. But I have learned to make homes and small<br/>
organizing ideas from that show.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is making me want to write a blog...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057679138">I&#39;ve never actually had a maid, but from what I do know about maid <br/>
services...they just really want to scrub your toilets, sinks, and <br/>
floors; dust; vacuum; maybe change your sheets and such.  <br/>
<br/>
I can tell from your post you desperately want a house that looks and <br/>
feels clean, but you have no idea where to start.  My suggestion is <br/>
to start small.  Start by finding a &quot;home&quot; for everything new that <br/>
you bring into the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, try doing these things every day--<br/>
<br/>
1.  Go through your mail and throw away the &quot;trash&quot; mail and find <br/>
a &quot;home&quot; for the bills to live in while they are waiting to be paid.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Do your dishes and clean your kitchen counters every night before <br/>
bed.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  Every morning collect all the dirty laundry from the house and <br/>
take it to the laundry room.  <br/>
<br/>
4.  Do two loads of laundry every day...from start to finish (put <br/>
away those 2 loads).  <br/>
<br/>
5.  Pick one area to work on and just spend 15 minutes (at least once <br/>
a day) sorting through things--either find a new home for it, put it <br/>
in a box labeled &quot;keep&quot;, or throw it away.  Give it time too.  It <br/>
took a lot longer than one day for it to get messy...so it&#39;s going to <br/>
take time to get it where you want it.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturdays you could take your &quot;keep&quot; box and find a new home for <br/>
everything you put in it that week.<br/>
<br/>
Try visiting www.flylady.net and look through her suggestions.  Don&#39;t <br/>
feel like you have to do everything just like she says, but see if <br/>
something there can inspire you to come up with a plan that works for <br/>
you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish you lots of luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998337562">You have my greatest sympathy. I used to feel exactly the way you&#39;ve  <br/>
described your feelings!<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question, I still think the ideal is to find a teen  <br/>
who is willing to learn how to clean up the clutter in your house. I  <br/>
have a friend who has four children and her aunt used to come over to  <br/>
her house twice a week and &quot;clean.&quot; I put &quot;clean&quot; in quotes because  <br/>
she didn&#39;t scrub and sweep and dust and stuff like that - she  <br/>
organized and threw away trash and cleaned closets and sorted through  <br/>
the kids&#39; clothing and toys and stuff like that. It made a HUGE  <br/>
difference in my friend&#39;s life. She and her husband did the actual  <br/>
cleaning, but they always had the space in which to do it (and they  <br/>
could FIND the broom and other cleaning supplies). My friend had hired  <br/>
&quot;housekeepers&quot; before, but she couldn&#39;t stand the stress of having to  <br/>
clean all the clutter in order for the hired person to &quot;clean.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Really - cleaning can be very minimal. Wipe out the sink and wipe off  <br/>
the counters when you&#39;re brushing your teeth. Scrub the tub a little  <br/>
when you&#39;re in the shower anyway. Clean out just the fruit drawer of  <br/>
the fridge, not the whole fridge, while you wait for something to heat  <br/>
up in the microwave. With &quot;cleaning&quot; the trick is to do the obvious  <br/>
first and to do little bits constantly and NEVER expect it to feel  <br/>
done. But with &quot;organizing&quot; the trick is to do the underlying stuff  <br/>
first (i.e., clear off the top shelf in the closet) to make space for  <br/>
the rest and, again, never expect to feel done.<br/>

I really like this idea, but I have a question here. <br/>
<br/>
I DO hate cleaning. Or rather : I hate cleaning so much for such a<br/>
poor, short-lasting result. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been complaining about it a lot, even if I know how useless it<br/>
is. So they know how much I hate that (working for no apparent result,<br/>
because they undo what I do lightning fast).<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that, if I succeed in changing my inner attitude, this<br/>
would be enough to *erase* all these words they&#39;ve heard ? And how do<br/>
you do that ? How did you realise that it was your gift to your family<br/>
? Did it hit you as an evidence the first time you heard about it ? Is<br/>
is a mere question of will (from now on, I won&#39;t hate cleaning so much)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397521996">For all those who struggle with organizing and clutter... have you<br/>
heard of or tried Flylady&#39;s system?<br/>
She has a book or two, but her website and email list are very<br/>
thorough and don&#39;t cost anything.  After a few years of &quot;flywashing&quot;<br/>
(her term for brainwashing), my attitude has changed.  I never really<br/>
hated tidying up, but... I disliked it enough to rarely get around to<br/>
doing it.  I never really did her routine exactly, but I did get a few<br/>
good habits ingrained permanently in my head, and most-importantly I<br/>
got a big attitude adjustment.  She constantly refers to cleaning as<br/>
&quot;blessing the house.&quot;  And after hearing that a few thousand times,<br/>
that&#39;s how I feel about it.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, it&#39;s possible to undo the attitude passed down to the<br/>
children... just be patient.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
That said, despite me having a good attitude toward &quot;blessing&quot; for<br/>
most of my dd&#39;s life, she is COMPLETELY oblivious to messes.  She<br/>
inherited her dad&#39;s... um... lack of concern.  I&#39;m finally accepting<br/>
that.  My ds loves helping me clean, though, which just goes to show<br/>
that everyone is different.<br/>
<br/>
It really did help me to realize that *I* am the one in this household<br/>
who desperately needs things put away.  I get really cranky when the<br/>
floor is filling up with toys and cat fuzz.  But no one else does.<br/>
Just me.  So I clean it up and then I feel better.  On the other hand,<br/>
despite my dust mite allergy, dusty surfaces don&#39;t bother me at all.<br/>
I&#39;ve been known to go 6 months between dustings.  Just my little<br/>
oddity.  No one else in the house cares about dust, so... no one ends<br/>
up cleaning it.  LOL  And, to just keep rambling... the main reason I<br/>
hate dusting is because of our clutter level.  We&#39;re not too bad, but<br/>
definitely have that &quot;lived in&quot; look, and every single horizontal<br/>
surface is full of stuff.  I am not going to spend the time to take<br/>
every single thing off.  I would LOVE to declutter some more, but that<br/>
butts up against my husband&#39;s genetic need to never get rid of<br/>
anything ever.  Soooo... no dusting.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just really can&#39;t recommend Flylady enough.  She understands clutter<br/>
that takes over the entire house, literally.  She&#39;s lived it.  And<br/>
she&#39;s gentle with people&#39;s feelings.  She doesn&#39;t judge or condemn,<br/>
because it is NOT a personal failing to have a messy house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058341069">Helen,<br/>
<br/>
HereÂ¹s an example: Do you like eating off dirty dishes? If not, then the<br/>
benefits of washing them outweigh the bother of cleaning them. So then maybe<br/>
you donÂ¹t hate cleaning them as much as you thought. I used to despise and<br/>
put off doing dishes until there were so many it was overwhelming. Now, I<br/>
try and not do that on purpose. I also listen to music with headphones<br/>
during my dishwashing time so that it brings me joy. Sometimes I dance too.<br/>
<br/>
Your family will probably need to hear your joy of cleaning for longer than<br/>
they have heard your hate of it. It will take time, but a change is very<br/>
likely to happen. And I believe it is a question of will. Simply decide that<br/>
you will do things differently and do you best to make that change.<br/>
