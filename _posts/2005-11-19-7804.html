<div id="ygrps-yiv-714237238">&quot;Do others also enjoy eating as a family? If so, they&#39;ll come and sit<br/>
and talk, whether they eat or not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We do things very much the way Pam described. We LOVE having family<br/>
mealtime. In our last house, things weren&#39;t set up to be very<br/>
conducive to this (art supplies all over the table etc..) but we<br/>
bought this house because of the kitchen and extra space that was SO<br/>
inviting for family meals and gathering.<br/>
So I&#39;ve been cooking a lot of evening meals and even breakfasts. The<br/>
kids are loving it. We don&#39;t all get hungry at the same time though,<br/>
so just like Pam&#39;s example, I&#39;ll have a child out munching while I&#39;m<br/>
preparing the meal.  <br/>
We help each other get what we need, at any given time, even if<br/>
someone is hungry right before dinner. I&#39;ve had kids eating huge bowls<br/>
of ice cream as dinner is being prepared, then sit down and eat loads<br/>
of dinner too! Trust.<br/>
I value that time to eat and connect around the table. We DO spend<br/>
loads of time together, but as kids get older, they&#39;re more involved<br/>
in their own activities so it&#39;s nice to really connect again in the<br/>
evening (or whenever).<br/>
I still trust them to listen to their own bodies. I try to cook foods<br/>
we all like, but if someone wants a peanut butter sandwich or other<br/>
snack instead of what I prepared, that&#39;s ok too.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime around here is when *I* can&#39;t keep my eyes open any more.:)<br/>
Because the two younger ones want me to tuck them in, cuddle, read<br/>
stories etc... except on the rare occasion that Jalen wants to finish<br/>
watching a movie, they sleep when I can&#39;t stay up anymore.:)<br/>
They&#39;re pretty tired by then anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The older boys stay up almost all night though. The key is whether<br/>
everyone is letting the tired people sleep. Dh goes to bed earlier<br/>
than anyone...so we all get quiet for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Typically, Sierra (who loves bedtime ritual) will say &quot;I have a great<br/>
idea Mom. I&#39;m going to take a warm bubble bath, then let&#39;s read books<br/>
and cuddle, ok?&quot;  So she usually starts up the calm-down time.<br/>
They love to read lots and lots of books lately, so I read until my<br/>
head starts to fall forward and then we turn off the lights.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s &quot;bedtime&quot; around here. It might be 9:30, it might be<br/>
midnight...just depends on the days activities and how tired we all are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928940953">&quot;and the leftover broccoflower&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, ooh! We just tried that two nights ago. Sierra had seen some at<br/>
the store and was fascinated by the bright green color. It looks like<br/>
some bizarre Dr. Seuss food (or maybe I&#39;m being influenced by having<br/>
read &quot;green eggs and ham&quot; a million times this week).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s mutant food, I swear! <br/>

I&#39;ve been getting the green for a year, but I was astonished last week to<br/>
find a bright orange version! No discernible taste difference.<br/>
