<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066102934">Last chance for general registration!<br/>
 Many of you have already reserved your spot at the conference  in that<br/>
case, we look forward to seeing you there! We have a few beds still<br/>
available, so we&#39;re keeping general registration open until noon on Monday.<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in attending, make sure to get in touch by that time!<br/>
We have an easy-to-follow registration form on our website where you can<br/>
register, sign up for housing and food, include a photo and message for the<br/>
conference directory, and even pre-order conference t-shirts! After Monday,<br/>
August 17th, conference registration costs will go up to the final<br/>
registration level of $30/adult, $25/child, and $100/family. Conference<br/>
T-shirts will not be available after Monday (except by extreme luck), so<br/>
pre-order yours now! Enjoy Life is just over a month away now, and the<br/>
conference is taking shape beautifully. We know, because we&#39;ve talked to all<br/>
the wonderful unschooling families who&#39;ve registered already; and we&#39;re<br/>
excited to meet everyone face-to-face. If you haven&#39;t checked out our<br/>
conference website, take a look at the lists of talks<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/things-to-do-and-hear/talks/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/things-to-do-and-hear/talks/</a>&gt; , chats<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/things-to-do-and-hear/chats/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/things-to-do-and-hear/chats/</a>&gt; , and<br/>

there should be something for everyone, from unschooling families with teens<br/>
and older children to families new to the unschooling lifestyle; from those<br/>
worrying about nuts-and-bolts issues of unschooling to people just looking<br/>
to meet and spend time with like-minded parents and children.<br/>
