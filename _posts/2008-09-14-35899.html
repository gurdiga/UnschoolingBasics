<br/>
Ok, with that said.  I really am interested in how to approach number <br/>
concepts without &#39;seat work&#39;.  I just finished reading an <br/>
article/blog entry on doing so, but...the person writing the entry <br/>
LOVES math. In fact she does trig for fun and referred to algebra as <br/>
mind candy.  Math is not my thing.  I am not very good at it and <br/>
really never have been; Which is part of the reason I took my <br/>
daughter out of public schools. (They had placed her in a low reading <br/>
group and she began to dislike reading. It reminded me way to much of <br/>
my math issues.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that my mindset has to change and that will take some time. <br/>
In the meantime does anyone have suggestions for math games or <br/>
activities?  My daughter really likes math and likes the worksheets <br/>
she has.  Maybe playing learning games together would help me to feel <br/>
I am doing something quantifiable to expose her to number concepts <br/>
but still not be working with ridged school room methods. <br/>

Jump rope? Dress and undress her dolls? Cook? Play any board games at <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710001870">How old is your child?  Do you shop together?  Have you watched the<br/>
show Numbers???  That has ME interested in math.  My DH and I have<br/>
been having wonderful math based discussions because of that show.  It<br/>
is so fun.  Are they interested in playing with math?  Or if it is<br/>
just you &quot;pushing&quot; it, then drop it till they are interested.  They<br/>
will learn what they need to when they need to, honest!<br/>
