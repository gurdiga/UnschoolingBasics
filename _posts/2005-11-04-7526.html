<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623736073">&quot;I think it is offensive when people who are ignorant of what the &quot;label&quot;<br/>
actually means to people and their families make a blanket statement<br/>
such as<br/>
that. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that people who write about NOT liking labels like<br/>
gifted, are ignorant of the issues these children face. Many of us<br/>
have out-of-synch or highly sensitive children that would have a<br/>
heaping of labels put on them in school. We choose to live without<br/>
those labels.<br/>
<br/>
Saying that ALL children are gifted is absolute truth.<br/>
It isn&#39;t saying that many, many children who fit the &quot;gifted&quot; label<br/>
according to the &quot;experts&quot; don&#39;t have huge challenges or sensitivies<br/>
to deal with. By saying all children are gifted, it&#39;s saying ALL<br/>
children are special and meant to shine in their own way (there&#39;s that<br/>
word again).<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that searching out answers about your child is important,<br/>
when it&#39;s hard to understand certain behaviors. It can be a HUGE<br/>
relief to parent&#39;s, knowing that their child is wired a certain way<br/>
and seemingly bizarre behavior isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a huge relief to know that other parent&#39;s are dealing with<br/>
these challenges and to learn ways to meet your child&#39;s needs better.<br/>
I understand.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean the label becomes a filter we see our child<br/>
through. It doesn&#39;t mean the label defines anything other than a way<br/>
to understand the child. Those kind of labels are harmful...that&#39;s all<br/>
we&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
I have a unique child that challenges me to be a better person every<br/>
day he is on this earth. He is Jalen...my sweet, intense, beautiful<br/>
child. He is not &quot;gifted&quot; or LD or ADD or ADHD or anything other than<br/>
my Jalen Kai.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is trying to say that a parent shouldn&#39;t do everything possible<br/>
to understand their child&#39;s uniqueness. We aren&#39;t saying there aren&#39;t<br/>
hugely challenging issues for some of these kids. The unschooling<br/>
philosphy stays the same though....it&#39;s all about helping each child<br/>
explore the world in their own way, assisting them where they need us,<br/>
protecting them, encouraging them and BEING with them.<br/>
