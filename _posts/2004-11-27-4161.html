 </span></blockquote>While I am learning to be less controlling with my family, I am extending<br/>
the same freedom to myself.  Who says my house has to be vacuumed weekly?<br/>
Who says the dishes must be done the minute I get up from the table?   Why<br/>
does the yard get mowed weekly during the summer?  There&#39;s some police-voice<br/>
in our heads that we can turn off!!  Relax!  Go play instead of clean!<br/>
