<div id="ygrps-yiv-107899906">I&#39;m &quot;getting&quot; more unschoolish as the days go by...<br/>
My 2 little girls went with me to help pick out fresh ingredients to<br/>
accompany supper - that&#39;s nothing really new, they get to pick the ones<br/>
they think are the prettiest and tastiest (green peppers, cucumbers,<br/>
fresh salad, etc)<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did differently that I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d not been doing<br/>
much ... They went to the bulk section and asked for a candy necklace<br/>
each.  I bought them (there was no money issues, they just wanted 35c<br/>
worth of candy in total), and I didn&#39;t make them &quot;wait until after<br/>
dinner&quot;.... They still ate their dinner joyfully, and enjoyed the whole day.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
