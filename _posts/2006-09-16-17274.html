If  unschooling is not doing school, then how is going to school  <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
If someone believes they need someone to decide what  they need to <br/>
know and need someone to teach it to them, then even if  they&#39;re given <br/>
the freedom to choose school or stay home, they aren&#39;t  unschooling if <br/>
they choose school.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t even unschooling if  they stay home and choose curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
*What* someone does doesn&#39;t  define unschooling. *Why* someone chooses <br/>
something is what will define  whether someone is unschooling or  not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Not sure I understand.  Personally I don&#39;t define unschooling as &quot;not  going <br/>
to school&quot;.  School is not even in my definition.<br/>
 <br/>
But first you say &quot;...they aren&#39;t unschooling if they choose school.   They <br/>
aren&#39;t even unschooling if they stay home and choose curriculum.&quot;   then you go <br/>
on to say &quot;*What* someone does doesn&#39;t define  unschooling. *Why* someone <br/>
chooses something is what will define whether someone  is unschooling or not.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Those two things doing seem to say the same thing.  You are saying you  <br/>
aren&#39;t unschooling if you use curriculum then say it isn&#39;t the *what* but the  <br/>
*why*.  Sounds a bit confusing to me.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally I don&#39;t label myself an unschooler or radical unschooler outside  <br/>
of these &quot;groups&quot; really.  It helps me find more like minded individuals in  <br/>
one sense, like on lists and in homeschool groups where the focus is on  <br/>
*education*.  But what we do is more than unschooling.  I personally  believe the <br/>
label itself binds you to defining things in *school* terms.   And when you tell <br/>
someone ( who is unfamiliar with homeschooling or  unschooling)  you are <br/>
unschooling they immediately think of *anti school* (  have been told that by <br/>
several people), and I don&#39;t want to be * anti school*  school is not for us right <br/>
now but I am not *anti* it.  I prefer to not  even think about it at all.<br/>
 <br/>
Our (dh and I) parenting has nothing at all to do with school so I  feel that <br/>
*radical unschooler* is even more of a mis-labeling.  We live  consensually <br/>
and right now my children choose to live and learn and explore  etc.  But when <br/>
I think about it if they decided to use a curriculum or text  book to learn a <br/>
particular topic I would not stop them, also I would not  consider us NOT <br/>
unschooling, some may though.  I prefer to just live our  lives moving through the <br/>
different phases with ease.  Not popping in and  out of a *category* called <br/>
unschooling, depending on what we are doing that  particular day.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway this is going off topic, LOL to the question asked.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not *doing* school. Important distinction!<br/>
<br/>
It was John Holt&#39;s original definition. At the time 7-Up was the  <br/>
UnCola and that inspired the word unschooling which was not doing  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is way more than that but in the context of  <br/>
discussing defining unschooling as any instance of learning out of  <br/>
interest even while in school, it seemed useful.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought of that as I hit send ;-) But, yeah, it is confusing!<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t know why someone&#39;s doing something so we can&#39;t define  <br/>
unschooling -- in a way that will help people understand it -- by  <br/>
what kids are doing. Is a child building a model rocket unschooling?  <br/>
Is a child doing problems from a textbook unschooling? Maybe the  <br/>
model rocket kid would rather be playing a video game but his mom  <br/>
gets nervous unless he&#39;s doing something that looks educational.  <br/>
Maybe the textbook kid just loves math problems like puzzles and  <br/>
treats the textbook like he does sudoku puzzle books.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more helpful to talk about unschooling in terms of values: joy,  <br/>
pursuing and valuing interests, creating a happy childhood, what  <br/>
valuing a child&#39;s interests looks like (something other than  <br/>
happiness and relief when they&#39;re doing something on their own that  <br/>
they might do in school!), respect them (beyond the times when  <br/>
they&#39;re doing what we want) and so on.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask &quot;Do unschoolers use workbooks?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want to reply &quot;Don&#39;t ask that question!&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On the surface the simple answer is &quot;Yes, some do.&quot; But *why* is  <br/>
someone asking? And what do they mean by &quot;use&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Do unschoolers use coloring books?<br/>
<br/>
If a child asks for and enjoys workbooks, is doing a workbook  <br/>
unschooling? Depends! Depends if the mom trusts unschooling and isn&#39;t  <br/>
breathing a sigh of relief when the child does a workbook. Depends if  <br/>
the child is still deschooling and sees workbooks as essential to  <br/>
learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What unschoolers do in real life is live life :-) But people who send  <br/>
their kids to school would say they&#39;re living life too so we need  <br/>
something we can point at and define and describe to help others do  <br/>
it. To help people do it we need more than &quot;just live life&quot;. We need  <br/>
more than &quot;learn what interests you&quot;. What we discuss on the lists is  <br/>
less about what we do and more about describing what we do in a way  <br/>
that will help someone understand it and get past the roadblocks that  <br/>
are in their way.<br/>
