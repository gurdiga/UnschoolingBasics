<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074115404">Jaiden(5) got a leap pad for x-mas this past year from my dad and stepmom. In their attempt to get him to read. He thought it was fun at first, but when they refused to get him any more of the books until he had proved to them that he could read them. He stoped playing with it(they were sooo pissed we wouldn&#39;t make him do it the right way and didn&#39;t have him sitting down everyday doing it). We brought it home from their house(where we had been storing it) last night, because we found out that our library checks out the books/cartriges and he asked if we could get them for him tonight.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;neways, this morning Jaiden had spread all of the books out and was playing around with them and he found the sample book that has a buch of the different levels that they(leap pad) offer. He was playing on the page that had a map of the USA, he just ran in tho show me how he had eaten a piece of cake into the shape of Texas. Damn if it isn&#39;t a perfect replica of the picture he was looking at. (he wants to save it until Jason gets home from school so he can show him-Jason grew up in Texas)<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s what my dad and stepmom were thinking of when thye got him the leap pad, but I think it&#39;s really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Think Letterman has any openings for kids who can eat chocolate cake into the shape of Texas? I know it&#39;s not cheese but......... <br/>
