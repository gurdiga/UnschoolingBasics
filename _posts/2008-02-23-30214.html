<div id="ygrps-yiv-336293798">TPG - Unschooled till age 16 when he decided to take a few college <br/>
courses. Ended up graduating with a degree in some computer field... <br/>
worked with a physics prof programming some things for Fermi Lab in <br/>
Chicago and something about neutrinos.... He&#39;s now 26 and works as a <br/>
computer sales engineer for rPath - a Linux based company based in <br/>
Cary NC- and he makes very good money. Owns a house and car has no <br/>
bills... and he loves his job! He travels all over the US now with <br/>
his company.<br/>
<br/>
AGG - unschooled till age 17 when he decided to take a few college <br/>
courses. Worked as a self employed car mechanic, bought a 66 Mustang <br/>
to restore (and it&#39;s almost done) - took off two years of school - <br/>
recently went back and is majoring in Mechanical Engineering. He&#39;s now 23.<br/>
<br/>
PWG - unschooled till age 17 when he decided to take a few college <br/>
classes...  (we get those free so the kids have all wanted to try it <br/>
out!) Worked as a computer pixel artist for a programmer in Israel <br/>
who developed computer games. Eventually he wants a degree in <br/>
computer graphics. He&#39;s a multi-media artist and dabbles in oils, <br/>
clay, clay-mation, computer generated art, photo editing, water color <br/>
and acrylic. PWG is almost 21.<br/>
<br/>
REG - just started her up her fourth semester at college - started at <br/>
16 like her brothers - majoring in music and possibly going into <br/>
music therapy; she&#39;s 18.<br/>
<br/>
So far they have all chosen to take a few college courses and decided <br/>
they enjoyed it enough to continue. No pressure from us, but it&#39;s <br/>
there if they want it. Both dh and I have degrees (his is useful, <br/>
mine was a waste of time and money in my view) and I guess the kids <br/>
feel it&#39;s not a bad idea. They have all been very successful in <br/>
college even though I never required any papers or math work or <br/>
anything!! This might be more &quot;schooly&quot; than you are looking for <br/>
since they all ended up in college - but it does go to show that <br/>
unschoolers can do just fine in college if they want to be there - <br/>
even without 13 years of busy work to &quot;prepare&quot; them.<br/>

Cameron is 20 and is a sixth grade drop out. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if you would read the archives here, you can learn ALL about <br/>
him! Put &quot;Cameron&quot; in the search. You&#39;ll get a zillion hits! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Actually---just read all my posts. He is in most of them. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a seasoned traveller: Germany, Australia, (without a parent). He <br/>
just got back from New Orleans---no he *just* got back from a weekend <br/>
in Asheville. LAST week, he was in New Orleans. He&#39;s been to the NW <br/>
twice---once with Wilderness Ventures in Washington and once for <br/>
NBTSCamp in Oregon. He&#39;s been to Vermont and West Virginia to NBTSCamp <br/>
as well. He&#39;s going to the Yukon for the month of June for NOLS <br/>
(National Outdoor Leadership School), as his new passion is the <br/>
wilderness and backpacking and camping.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a magician and has studied with some of the top magicians in the <br/>
world---notably Jeff McBride.<br/>
<br/>
He attended skateboard twice camp in Pennsylvania, but he was never all <br/>
that great at skating. He just loved it.<br/>
<br/>
He made a short film that made its debut at Spoleto. He has also worked <br/>
on two other films and has an IMBD page for his work on The Four <br/>
Children of Tander Welch---due out this year, starring Mac Astin and <br/>
his mom, Patty Duke.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s an accomplished drummer and has been a member of several bands, <br/>
one he formed himself. He&#39;s played professionally with some top jazz <br/>
musicians and has met and jammed with many others. He&#39;s performed with <br/>
a Scottish pipe and drums corps.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s worked at many jobs, including restaurants, electronics, moving <br/>
companies, caterers, bands, and odd jobs. His favorite jobs have <br/>
probably been the bands, babysitting, and house/petsitting.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s sat in on university classes, but he&#39;s learned that he&#39;s not sure <br/>
that he wants to devote so much time to college.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s buying a car and paying his own insurance because he wants to <br/>
establish credit.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s an artist and musician. He&#39;s an excellent cook and is working on <br/>
the perfect vegie-burger. &lt;g&gt; In fact, he made supper tonight.<br/>
<br/>
His first piece of written work since leaving school was published in <br/>
the e-zine Connections, so technically he&#39;s a published author.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a conscientious and obnoxious recycler. &lt;G&gt; He gives a GREAT <br/>
massage!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the world&#39;s most patient and considerate boyfriend to Carly. They <br/>
will be celebrating FIVE years together in March.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s speaking at this year&#39;s Live and Learn Unschooling Conference.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s interested in farming/gardening now and will be helping me build a <br/>
chicken house and yard next month.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting SOO much! &lt;G&gt; But he would be happy <br/>
to directly answer any questions your husband would like to throw at <br/>
him.<br/>

My son Julian is 18 and is attending Goddard College, majoring in Music and  <br/>
Social Justice. He&#39;s a wonderful musician and wants to do it professionally.  <br/>
He&#39;s performed pretty regularly, is writing lots of songs, and does cool  <br/>
things.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s already had a couple of really cool jobs. He spent a year directing  the <br/>
Religious Education program at a UU church -- at 16.  He worked for  <br/>
MassEquality, the organization that worked to get same-sex marriage legal in  <br/>
Massachusetts, as a canvasser. He was the youngest canvasser, and regularly was  <br/>
acknowledged as the best canvasser of the week. He was good enough that his  <br/>
supervisors regularly asked him to train other canvassers and supervise  volunteers.<br/>
 <br/>
We think he&#39;s worked out quite well, actually :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692512320">I&#39;m  trying to collect a lot of information about unschooled kids who <br/>
are older  than ... about seventeen, I guess ....and what they&#39;re like, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
I think most people would agree that my 18 year old daughter Brenna has  <br/>
&quot;accomplished&quot; quite a lot.<br/>
But that isn&#39;t what makes her who she is.  I believe unschooling has  given <br/>
her the wings and the courage and the desire to live each day as fully as  she <br/>
does.  She would probably rather I didn&#39;t sing her praises but I love  the <br/>
chance to talk about how &quot;neat&quot; she is..&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Brenna has been homeschooled since she was 8 and unschooled since she was  <br/>
13.  The unschooling has made all the difference in her life and in  ours.<br/>
 <br/>
 She takes classes at a community college, has been offered numerous  <br/>
scholarships and has decided to go to New College in Sarasota, Florida, this  coming <br/>
fall semester.  She sings, works at a Young Chefs Academy,  sings, plays the <br/>
guitar, spends time with her boyfriend, enjoys her classes,  hangs out with us <br/>
and I find her amazing and a joy to be around.  Did I  mention she sings?  :-) <br/>
 All the time.<br/>
 <br/>
She was a regional problem captain for Odyssey of the Mind yesterday, in  <br/>
charge of 11 adult judges that she conducted training for last weekend.  I  <br/>
watched some of the problems and was just amazed at her attention to detail and  <br/>
ability to coordinate and manage an all day event that rested on her shoulders.  <br/>
She received a scholarship from Odyssey of the Mind at the awards ceremony <br/>
last  night.<br/>
 <br/>
In two weeks, she is performing as Dorothy in a weekend long Wizard of Oz  <br/>
celebration.  In May, we going to the Life is Good Unschooling  Conference and <br/>
then she is going to travel a bit on the west coast.  In September, she is one <br/>
of the speakers at the Live and Learn Conference  in North Carolina.  She&#39;s <br/>
already working on her speech.   Come  to that conference and you&#39;ll meet and <br/>
hear another amazing young adult, Cameron  Lovejoy, who is also living his full <br/>
life and making a difference in the lives  of those he meets.  <br/>
 <br/>
These two young adults are not the exceptions.  Across the board, the  <br/>
unschooled teens we know are interesting because they are interested in  life and <br/>
learning and they are fun to be around because they are  joyful,  kind and <br/>
respected and trusted by their families.<br/>
 <br/>
The unschooled teens we know each have stories to tell and are living  these <br/>
large lives free of school.  So many accomplishments from them all,  but by <br/>
far their largest &quot;accomplishment&quot; is the thoughtfulness that  they bring to <br/>
their relationships with their families and friends.  It&#39;s  easy to find teens <br/>
anywhere who have a laundry list of things they&#39;ve  done.  It&#39;s how they&#39;ve done <br/>
these things and how they live  their lives that make these unschooling young <br/>
adults unique.  They  live life from their hearts and that&#39;s what makes the <br/>
biggest difference.<br/>
