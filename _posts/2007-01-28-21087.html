<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710783757">I ended up with PPROM with both my pregnancies so when to deliver (both<br/>
cesareans) wasn&#39;t an option.<br/>
<br/>
I found out the hard way that I&#39;m allergic to steroids. An injection I<br/>
received a few years back damaged my pancreas so surprise, surprise, I ended<br/>
up diabetic. I ordered the lab tests myself since the doctors didn&#39;t request<br/>
the most important ones (HbA1C and C-peptide) and then went through 5<br/>
internists...had I listenedd to half of when they said, I&#39;d probably be dead<br/>
today. I went to the American Diabetes association and stuck to that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for pointing this out--your right, I haven&#39;t been able to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; info<br/>
&gt; &gt; off the internet. Would you believe that I got this from my doctor?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes. In my experience, doctors are a good source of misinformation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; what you get for listening to people in this country--my apologies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the bright side, you could sue him. :P In NL, the judges would laugh<br/>
&gt; you away, you probably couldn&#39;t get this to be a court case, whereas<br/>
&gt; here... who knows what would happen? Although I don&#39;t like stupid<br/>
&gt; lawsuits... they just increase the cost of medical care.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking of doctors and malinformation, I&#39;m currently reading &quot;The<br/>
&gt; thinking woman&#39;s guide to a better birth&quot;, which is actually pretty<br/>
&gt; well researched, despite the title. Some of the stuff in it really<br/>
&gt; makes me roll my eyes, even though I was already very skeptical of<br/>
&gt; hospital birth with all its interventions. It&#39;s a wonder obstetricians<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get sued more often. Example: in around 1800, some doctor decided<br/>
&gt; that the average length of a pregnancy is 40 weeks. Nowadays, doctors<br/>
&gt; use that number to decide when to induce, which is quite often done at<br/>
&gt; 41 weeks, although there are doctors that wait till 42 weeks. Still,<br/>
&gt; turns out that the average length of a first time pregnancy is 41 weeks<br/>
&gt; and a day, and for subsequent pregnancies 40 weeks and 3 days. So, the<br/>
&gt; average first time mom is overdue and should be induced? Gimme a break.<br/>
&gt; And I could obviously go on and on, but then I&#39;d be abusing Henci<br/>
&gt; Goer&#39;s copyright, I think.<br/>
