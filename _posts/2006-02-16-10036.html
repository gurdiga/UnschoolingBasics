<div id="ygrps-yiv-6404172">I&#39;ve been emailing this to everyone I can think of, offlist, but<br/>
double checked and realized Diana isn&#39;t on this list, so I think it&#39;s<br/>
safe to post:<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I know most of you are aware that Diana Jenner&#39;s (HahaMommy)<br/>
daughter Hannah has been diagnosed with Leukemia. For those that<br/>
haven&#39;t heard, it was just diagnosed recently and she&#39;s already been<br/>
started on Chemo.  Diana and family were at the Live and Learn<br/>
conference last October and she&#39;s a regular at several unschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Pam Sorooshian had a lovely idea...to have a bunch of us make<br/>
quilt  squares and have a big quilt made for their family.  A<br/>
volunteer has been found<br/>
(Jill Parmer) and the parameters have been set up. We need the squares<br/>
very soon, I&#39;ll get the address for mailing them to shortly.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re doing this quietly offlist, in hopes of keeping it a surprise<br/>
for them. If you know anyone that would like to be involved, please<br/>
pass this on to whomever you choose. Jill says she can put it together<br/>
no matter how many there are.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the scoop:  The squares need to be pre-shrunk (so wash<br/>
material first) and cut to an 11x11 size.  Please keep your design<br/>
inside of a 10x10 size<br/>
though, so she has room for seams. Sign the square (inside the 10x10<br/>
area of course) with a fine tip permanent marker if you wish.<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be a quilter to get involved!  There are fabric<br/>
paints, photo transfers, fabric crayons, embroidery...a lot of ways to<br/>
decorate fabric without actually quilting.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some of their favorites, which Kelli T posted at the<br/>
Imagination Tribe<br/>
list:<br/>
<br/>
    ~Kyra says, Hannah&#39;s fav color is definitely blue, and she likes<br/>
yellow too.<br/>
<br/>
    Some interests of Hannah,  her fav stuffed animal is a polar bear,<br/>
she plays<br/>
basketball and sings.  They play alot of bratz, don&#39;t know if that is<br/>
helpful or<br/>
not. &lt;g&gt;    She likes camouflage colors too.<br/>
<br/>
    Oh, Kyra says Hayden&#39;s favorite color is red, and I know Diana<br/>
likes the<br/>
colors in her poncho, the oranges, reds.~<br/>
<br/>
The Imagination Tribe is handling the organization, so lotsa<br/>
unschoolers there already know (Kathryn B, Kelli T,Danielle, Kelly<br/>
Lovejoy, Rue, Gail etc...)  I&#39;m passing this to the people I&#39;m sure<br/>
would want to know that aren&#39;t there. Please continue passing this,<br/>
just tell everyone to try and keep it from Diana. So<br/>
don&#39;t post it at any groups she&#39;s on!:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really excited to be part of this...I can just see them cuddled up<br/>
in a quilt that is filled with all of our love and healing energy.:)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to catch up on the treatment and all, Diana is posting to<br/>
a blog (gutsy woman that she is) about the day to day stuff:<br/>

And this just came through today, posted by Jill Parmer:<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the plan:<br/>
<br/>
Mail quilt pieces by Tues, Feb 21st.  That gives everyone this weekend<br/>
to work on them and should be enough time for them to arrive by Tues,<br/>
Feb 28th.  I will start organizing and putting them together on Wed,<br/>
March 1st.  And then sew, sew, sew, and get the quilt in the mail to<br/>
Diana on Monday, March 6th.<br/>
<br/>
Send all the pieces you want.  If there is an over flow, I will send<br/>
those pieces onto Robyn Coburn and she will make a throw for Diana.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you can send $2 or $3 along with your pieces, that will<br/>
help me pay for batting, back piece, and postage.  Thank you.  Any<br/>
extra would follow the quilt to Diana, Hannah and Hayden.<br/>
<br/>
Send pieces to:<br/>

There might be some of you that want to do something nice, but can&#39;t<br/>
do the quilt right now. If you want to help Hannah sell her goal of<br/>
600 boxes of Girl Scout cookies, Kelli posted this:<br/>
<br/>
 ~Diana&#39;s address:  1218 So First Ave  Sioux Falls SD  57105<br/>
<br/>
The cookies are $3.50 per box and checks can be made out to Girl Scouts.~<br/>

She said they&#39;ll be donating all the cookies we purchase to a boys<br/>

Danielle and I are sending a square tomorrow.  Danielle&#39;s favorite <br/>
color is blue, so we used fabric leftover from some pillows I made for <br/>
her room (sun, moon, stars, blue and yellow).   Hannah and her family <br/>
are in our thoughts.<br/>
