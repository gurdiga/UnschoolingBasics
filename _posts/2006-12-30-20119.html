<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146904007">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
New question here...<br/>
<br/>
I am the grown daughter of an obsessive-compulsive parent.  OCD is funny when you <br/>
watch it on MONK, but in real life, its horrible.  You&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;a place for <br/>
everything, and everything in its place&quot;, but with my dad, this was taken to a new level. I <br/>
remember more than one occassion being jerked out of bed in the middle of the night <br/>
because something was a couple of inches out of place and it was my responsibility to <br/>
align it PERFECTLY before being allowed to go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Althought *I* do not have OCD, it has been ingrained in me that things have to be <br/>
cleaned/picked up/put away PERFECTLY.  I have worked very hard to overcome this part of <br/>
my upbringing, and I&#39;ve done quite well in a lot of areas.  I&#39;ve lowered my standards on <br/>
cleanliness to a point I never thought possible (for instance, I can&#39;t remember the last time <br/>
I cleaned the bathrooms - hows that for lowered standards!).  But...I have 3 young children <br/>
(5.5, 4, 2) with 3 seperate interests and the clutter is tearing me apart on the inside.  I&#39;ve <br/>
gone thru the archives, but have only seen stuff on picking up/cleaning relating to &quot;have <br/>
to vs. choose to&quot;, which I don&#39;t feel applies to me.  Because of my upbringing, mentally <br/>
&quot;letting go&quot; of the mess is not something I feel I can do. It causes such incredible anxiety <br/>
in me that sometimes I have trouble breathing! I have come to understand thru reading <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that if something bothers me, then it is *my* responsibility to clean it <br/>
up.  But...I feel I like I am *always* picking up and sacrificing time with my kids in order to <br/>
do this. I don&#39;t wont to sacrfice my time/relationship with them, but I&#39;m not sure how to <br/>
overcome something that has been so deeply ingrained in me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817777113">Hi Tami,<br/>
<br/>
I understand how you feel.  I have had to work hard to let go of &quot;perfectionism&quot; myself.  www.flylady.net has helped me tremendously!  My house stays fairly straightened.  I just have to be careful to do ONLY what she tells me to do daily and not go way overboard and try to do everything perfectly.  Hope you find this helpful.<br/>

incredible anxiety <br/>
in me that  sometimes I have trouble breathing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OCD can run in families.  I have struggled for years with much of what  you <br/>
have been describing.  I&#39;ve read self-help books, gone to counseling,  <br/>
exercised, changed my diet, tried every trick I could uncover.  In the last  couple of <br/>
years, the anxiety and compulsiveness began to cause problems with my  <br/>
relationships with my family and friends. <br/>
 <br/>
About 6 weeks ago, I went on a very low dosage of an SSRI antidepressant  <br/>
that is used for both anxiety, depression and OCD symptoms.  Within a few  days, <br/>
my anxiety subsided, my compulsiveness diminished to a very manageable  level <br/>
and I was able to step back and start feeling like myself again.  My  <br/>
relationship with my husband is greatly improved...He likes me again...:-)   And I <br/>
like me again.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not recommending medication as the answer but I just wanted to share  <br/>
with you that after years of frustration with not being able to deal with  these <br/>
issues, this has made a huge difference for me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anxiety to the point of having trouble breathing might be more than your  <br/>
upbringing.  I know that I felt so guilty that I was not able to deal with  this <br/>
&quot;on my own&quot; that I would not even consider medication.  However, it  has truly <br/>
been a life changing decision for me to try it. <br/>

**Hi Tami - My dad has OCD, I have OCD, and my daughter has OCD.  When<br/>
Rowan, my daughter, first started having problems with it we talked about<br/>
what it feels like.  I stood in the kitchen with all the cabinet doors open<br/>
(a big problem for me) and told her how my body felt.  My chest felt<br/>
constricted.  I didn&#39;t feel like I was breathing right.  All of my muscles<br/>
felt strained and anxious.  It was a huge physical effort to stop myself<br/>
from from closing the doors.  Rowan says that&#39;s just how she feels too.  So<br/>
I&#39;d maybe think about the possibility that it wasn&#39;t only your dad&#39;s<br/>
actions, but his genetics, that have contributed to your having trouble<br/>
&#39;letting go&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan and I did a LOT of learning about OCD and ways to minimize its effect<br/>
on our lives.  If you want an email about some of what we learned feel free<br/>
to email me off-list.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224644612">Because of my upbringing, mentally &quot;letting go&quot; of the mess is not something I feel I can do. It causes such incredible anxiety in me that sometimes I have trouble breathing! I have come to understand thru reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that if something bothers me, then it is *my* responsibility to clean it up.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  ******<br/>
   <br/>
  I strugge with a very low tolerance for clutter -- and kids who don&#39;t seem to have the same issue about visual clutter.  I&#39;ve been thru cycles where I felt I had to clean it all, every day and found myself resenting that no one else cleaned up. I would grump and grumble, and lose my temper, and spend hours being angry about my lot in life.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to insist that the kids do chores or clean up -- I grew up with chore lists and years of picking up after my brother and sister.  I swore I&#39;d never make my kids do chore (my Mom still thinks I&#39;m wrong that as an adult it&#39;s my turn to have someone else do the housework!).<br/>
   <br/>
  For me, what works is to keep my bedroom neat.  I chose that one because it&#39;s an easy one to tackle, and I pass thru it on my way to the bathroom several times a day, so I get a regular &#39;fix&#39; of order!  As soon as the bed is empty, I make it -- I bought myself pretty flannel sheets I enjoy seeing and put on my favorite bedspread.  Once the bed is made, that motivates me to neaten up the clutter around it -- put laundry in the basket, pick up loose books or newspapers, open the curtains to let the sun in.  Just seeing it so neat brings me peace.  Whenever a get a few minutes in my day, I sit in my rocking chair in the &#39;reading&#39; corner of my bedroom and just survey my space.  I first tried it when someone else said that having the bed made was really nice.  I never made my bed growing up -- having a messy room was my rebellion against my Mom&#39;s neatnik demands.  It seemed silly, and took me a week or so to get into the habit, but what a difference it makes. <br/>
   <br/>
  It also helps me to break it up into small jobs.  I just do the dishes, loading and unloading the dishwasher as I heat up a kettle of water for a cup of tea -- my reward and so much better enjoyed in a clean kitchen!  Or I pick up toys while my tea kettle heats.  I fold laundry while watching a favorite TV show I&#39;ve DVR&#39;d -- in Dan&#39;s bedroom so the boys can have the living room to enjoy as they wish.  I clean on my way to bed, when the boys are asleep, and enjoy the few moments of order.  I remind myself that before I know it, the boys will be grown and I&#39;ll miss the clutter of their favorite stuff, because it will mean they&#39;re spending less time in my space.  I remember that giving them the freedom from being responsible for meeting my needs is really a very small season in my life, and such a huge blessing to them (one I missed, but giving it to them heals me so much!) and in grand scheme of things, I&#39;m blessed to have these magnificent little beings in my life.  <br/>
   <br/>
  But mostly, I make my bed! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s just enough to satisfy my complusions -- and given the size of my compulsions, that&#39;s practically a miracle!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH, have you tried Bach Flower remedies!! These help when nothing else<br/>
will. You can choose according to needs. These are available at any<br/>
natural food store. Rescue Remedy, Elm, Cherry Plum, Beech are must<br/>
haves, imo. The links below have some remedy finder tools to help<br/>
select the most appropriate to one&#39;s needs. We have a bunch on hand<br/>
for varied situations. They just take the edge off of intensity, so<br/>
that coping can occur. They are not a panacea to exploring ways to<br/>
address underlying needs; but they do help to create a calmer state, ime.<br/>

However, we use classical homeopathy rather than acute.<br/>

homeopathy does help to address emotional aspects and behavioral<br/>
characteristics. I highly recommend considering it. I was leery<br/>
at first but am evangelical about homeopathy now. LOL<br/>
