<div id="ygrps-yiv-968584194">I think most of the kids are a little older.  Karl is not on there but then<br/>
again I haven&#39;t mentioned it.  He might enjoy it.  I think there&#39;s a kids<br/>
subgroup within RUN.  There&#39;s also plenty of kids all over RUN.  It&#39;s pretty<br/>
kid friendly if you&#39;ve been on there, you&#39;ll see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691797333">Hey Ren,<br/>
Efua is now friends with almost every child on the Youth Network - including Sierra - but I <br/>
should have been more specific.  She is looking for children in general but she specifically <br/>
wants more children around her age.  Kwamena is a lot less interested in the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that Sierra seems to send these long and detailed responses to the forums - <br/>
until I read them and they clearly were from you!  Pretty funny.<br/>
<br/>
And Efua is enjoying communicating with you on the network.  Hopefully one day we can <br/>
meet in person.<br/>

   <br/>
  On this topic,  since it is an obviously innocuous(sp?) issue (the use of the rad. Unsch. network.prior to age thirteen that is). i bring a question that is really (to me) the root of this discussion. how about the state you live in&#39;s registry of motor vehicles, or the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, how about the state legislature or even the congress of the united states of america. at what point does the principal of law actually matter? i understand that rules in and of themselves particualarly within the home and family are not tools to be aspired to but in a grander scope i.e. society it is the very existance of some sense of rules that make the choices we make possible. when we allow and even encourage the breaking of someone else&#39;s rules to govern themselves what are we modeling?  the radical unschoolers network for example has an age limit for some reason(i cant see why but...) and it is their right to do as it our right to self determine. i just wanted<br/>
 to toss out a question as to when does a respect for the law become an issue that we should model a lifestyle that shows that laws need to be followed and that when we disrespect the boundaries set by others for themselves we ask that ours be violated. it is the very truth of our own self determination that points out the act of violating someone elses right to determination as unacceptable. would in a situation such as this be more prudent to show our kids how to reach out to an organization to possibly get them to re-evaluate their rules while maybe allowing them to use our log in or using the site together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060376878">~~how about the state you live in&#39;s registry of motor vehicles, or the<br/>
bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, how about the state<br/>
legislature or even the congress of the united states of america. at<br/>
what point does the principal of law actually matter?~~<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring an arbitrary age limit is very different from ignoring the<br/>
LAW. There are no laws about joining an internet community, just<br/>
biased rules about it. Mostly because of liability concerns for the<br/>
people running the servers, not because it truly keeps anyone safe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~when we allow and even encourage the breaking of someone else&#39;s<br/>
rules to govern themselves what are we modeling? ~~<br/>
<br/>
The ability to think. What it means to be truly American even!;) If<br/>
following the rules was more important to the founding fathers and<br/>
mothers of my country, then this country wouldn&#39;t even exist. They<br/>
committed treason for crying out loud. How&#39;s that for ignoring the rules?<br/>
<br/>
 ~~the radical unschoolers network for example has an age limit for<br/>
some reason(i cant see why but...) and it is their right to do as it<br/>
our right to self determine. ~~<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with anyone self-determining anything. One of my<br/>
best friend&#39;s started the network and she is working within the<br/>
limitations of existing server space. The Ning network has their<br/>
parameters set up to only allow over 13 so if you want to start a<br/>
network that is not age discriminatory, you have to ask people to<br/>
fudge their birthdates. No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about an internet community for people to communicate<br/>
with. NOT asking anyone to break the law and face penalties or fines<br/>
or worse. Nor is it affecting anyone else, their life, their choices<br/>
or creating harm in any manner. THAT is part of how we assess whether<br/>
a rule or law is worth ignoring.<br/>
<br/>
~~to toss out a question as to when does a respect for the law become<br/>
an issue that we should model a lifestyle that shows that laws need to<br/>
be followed and that when we disrespect the boundaries set by others<br/>
for themselves we ask that ours be violated.~~<br/>
<br/>
Respect for the law should only exist if it actually makes sense or is<br/>
the choice that has consequences you are willing to live with. Many<br/>
laws violate my personal liberties, such as tax laws because the taxes<br/>
in this country were meant to be VOLUNTARY only and were never meant<br/>
to become what they are today.<br/>
<br/>
 Though the constituation originally states that taxes are to be<br/>
voluntary (until the 16th amendment was passed) and what has happened<br/>
today violates that principle, I still choose to pay my taxes though I<br/>
am ethically opposed. I choose to pay them because the fight isn&#39;t<br/>
worth it. The consequences aren&#39;t worth it to me right now. So I<br/>
choose to comply. I&#39;m not against any form of taxes, but I am opposed<br/>
to the current form they take and the power the government has.<br/>
<br/>
My children are intelligent enough to figure out which laws they will<br/>
or won&#39;t comply with and be responsible enough to face consequences of<br/>
their actions.<br/>
<br/>
 ~~it is the very truth of our own self determination that points out<br/>
the act of violating someone elses right to determination as<br/>
unacceptable.~~<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear how fudging a birth date in order to join a<br/>
social network violates any else&#39;s right to self-determination.<br/>
You seem to be using the &quot;slippery slope&quot; theory here. If you<br/>
encourage kids to lie about one thing, they&#39;ll learn poor ethical<br/>
judgmentand immorality. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t disagree more. <br/>
When a person exercises their free will, they can actually make<br/>
choices that help them look at a situation from many angles. I helped<br/>
my children lie about their age to join a network. Is that encouraging<br/>
lying? I think not. It&#39;s encouraging thinking. It&#39;s encouraging them<br/>
to have the ability to determine a useful lie from a hurtful one.<br/>
<br/>
People like to pretend that lying is bad. Everyone lies. Show me<br/>
someone that says they don&#39;t and I&#39;ll find a situation they were happy<br/>
to lie about. People lie about liking a hairstyle they don&#39;t care for<br/>
in order to avoid hurt feelings. They lie to assist each other in<br/>
planning surprise parties or gifts for each other. Lying isn&#39;t all<br/>
bad. Intent is more important to me.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re talking to someone that is somewhere between libertarian<br/>
and anarchist. I think in this society, people are so rule/law driven<br/>
that they can&#39;t think clearly anymore. Give me clear-thinking people<br/>
over law abiding people any day. They&#39;ll figure out the right thing to<br/>
do much faster and more effectively.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535278992">well, with regard to the R. U. N. as i pointed out in my post i know <br/>
that the surface issue was a little of a stretch but i want to get to <br/>
the deeper issue. you may personally know the people who started this <br/>
site but that will not always be the case.  lets use an arbitrary <br/>
site for example, it is in fact their site(who ever created and runs <br/>
it) and if i choose to use it and my expose and encourage my childs <br/>
use of a site how respectful am i being and are we being when we <br/>
violate the stipulations of the person or persons who the site <br/>
belongs to. does that model respect. this is my point. i dont say all <br/>
lying is evil. read my post that wasnt my point.  i know that to make <br/>
a similar point about how rules are bad or how labels are wrong the <br/>
same logic has been applied. the logic that as parents we model <br/>
behaviors of respect or not and that is what our children get a firm <br/>
grasp on.  lets face it in a society we do need some rules not just <br/>
people following their own critical thought as that would lead to <br/>
complete oligarchy which by the way would eb the natural end result <br/>
of anarchy. so be careful what you wish for as once we achieve <br/>
anarchy, it will be the strong and the forceful that rule, not the <br/>
wise or the intelligent.  as china and russia were quick to teach us <br/>
the educated are easily eradicated by the strong. i didnt mean for <br/>
this to get so big i just think that an address with regard to <br/>
societal respect not just personal respect is important too. <br/>
if the birth date on the website is so irrelivant what about a fake <br/>
id to get into bars or why not just buy coke since i am a smart and <br/>
critical thinking person arent they all the same thing?  a series of <br/>
rules put in place arbitrarily to in some way control the populace, <br/>
and as i may or may not choose to risk the ramifications of said <br/>
choices. i thought we were trying to accomplish modeling a behavior <br/>
that wasnt about following rules to avoid punishment or to be <br/>
rewarded but to respect those around us and ourselves in a way that <br/>
allows us to just live and have our very life shine through with a <br/>
manner that by its very essence does not impeach anothers right at <br/>
self regulation.<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts<br/>

Are you more concerned about respecting an arbitrary age rule, set up<br/>
to protect a network from liability issues or respecting your child&#39;s<br/>
desire to connect with friends? That&#39;s where you and I differ (amongst<br/>
many other things). I choose to respect my child more than some<br/>
arbitrary rule. Doesn&#39;t mean we ignore all rules. We can logically<br/>
analyze whether there is a good reason for something and whether it is<br/>
a useful rule. <br/>
<br/>
The age of thirteen isn&#39;t some magical age that indicates a child&#39;s<br/>
ability to properly utilize an online community.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ~~lets face it in a society we do need some rules not just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people following their own critical thought as that would lead to <br/>
&gt; complete oligarchy which by the way would eb the natural end result <br/>
&gt; of anarchy.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess that&#39;s another point we differ on. I don&#39;t think rules and<br/>
laws prevent anything. Maybe to a small degree. But mostly it just<br/>
gives the law makers the ability to punish people. Laws exist to allow<br/>
punishment for not following the law. They don&#39;t exist to prevent<br/>
anything (thought the makers seem to think they do).<br/>
<br/>
More laws don&#39;t equal less problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~if the birth date on the website is so irrelivant what about a fake <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; id to get into bars or why not just buy coke since i am a smart and <br/>
&gt; critical thinking person arent they all the same thing?~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you think that any and all lying about age is the same thing, that<br/>
shows a lack of critical thinking. It&#39;s faulty logic.<br/>
<br/>
As for fake ID, my parents didn&#39;t drink or allow any alcohol in our<br/>
home. They certainly never lied about our ages. I borrowed a fake ID<br/>
at age 18 and went bar hopping. Actually, I&#39;d been bar hopping before<br/>
and never got carded! The night I borrowed the fake ID I met my<br/>
husband of 19 years.:) Funny how things can work out eh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating &quot;ignore all rules&quot; but I&#39;m also baffled when people<br/>
say that by ignoring an age rule it somehow equates to any and all age<br/>
fudging as being equal. It&#39;s not. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~ i thought we were trying to accomplish modeling a behavior <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that wasnt about following rules to avoid punishment or to be <br/>
&gt; rewarded but to respect those around us and ourselves in a way that <br/>
&gt; allows us to just live and have our very life shine through with a <br/>
&gt; manner that by its very essence does not impeach anothers right at <br/>
&gt; self regulation.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And by choosing to fudge a birth date to join a lively group of<br/>
unschoolers who have enriched our lives immensely, we in NO way are<br/>
impeaching upon any one else&#39;s right at self regulation. Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should go read at the site itself and see how the children<br/>
are sharing their art,their dreams, their birthdays, their joys and<br/>
concerns, their lives with each other. It&#39;s a beautiful thing and I&#39;m<br/>
glad for parents that are giving their child access to such rich<br/>
connections! Without ever causing infringement upon any other human<br/>
being or their rights. Cool huh?<br/>

&gt;   well, with regard to the R. U. N. as i pointed out in my post i know<br/>
&gt; that the surface issue was a little of a stretch but i want to get to<br/>
&gt; the deeper issue. you may personally know the people who started this<br/>
&gt; site but that will not always be the case. lets use an arbitrary<br/>
&gt; site for example, it is in fact their site(who ever created and runs<br/>
&gt; it) and if i choose to use it and my expose and encourage my childs<br/>
&gt; use of a site how respectful am i being and are we being when we<br/>
&gt; violate the stipulations of the person or persons who the site<br/>
&gt; belongs to. does that model respect. this is my point. i dont say all<br/>
&gt; lying is evil. read my post that wasnt my point. i know that to make<br/>
&gt; a similar point about how rules are bad or how labels are wrong the<br/>
&gt; same logic has been applied. the logic that as parents we model<br/>
&gt; behaviors of respect or not and that is what our children get a firm<br/>
&gt; grasp on. lets face it in a society we do need some rules not just<br/>
&gt; people following their own critical thought as that would lead to<br/>
&gt; complete oligarchy which by the way would eb the natural end result<br/>
&gt; of anarchy. so be careful what you wish for as once we achieve<br/>
&gt; anarchy, it will be the strong and the forceful that rule, not the<br/>
&gt; wise or the intelligent. as china and russia were quick to teach us<br/>
&gt; the educated are easily eradicated by the strong. i didnt mean for<br/>
&gt; this to get so big i just think that an address with regard to<br/>
&gt; societal respect not just personal respect is important too.<br/>
&gt; if the birth date on the website is so irrelivant what about a fake<br/>
&gt; id to get into bars or why not just buy coke since i am a smart and<br/>
&gt; critical thinking person arent they all the same thing? a series of<br/>
&gt; rules put in place arbitrarily to in some way control the populace,<br/>
&gt; and as i may or may not choose to risk the ramifications of said<br/>
&gt; choices. i thought we were trying to accomplish modeling a behavior<br/>
&gt; that wasnt about following rules to avoid punishment or to be<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems you want to discuss whether it&#39;s right for people to feel  <br/>
entitled to break rules but no one has suggested doing that. The  <br/>
questions people should ask are: Why does the rule exist? Who will it  <br/>
hurt if I break it? What will happen to me if I&#39;m caught?<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t casually asked questions. It&#39;s how a thinking person  <br/>
should approach rules.<br/>
<br/>
Why does an age limit exist on the site? (The RUN site. Any site.) Is  <br/>
it because of the law against collecting information from minors? Is  <br/>
it a way of suggesting the content is might be too mature for those  <br/>
under 13? How is it harming the person who set up the site?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; read my post that wasnt my point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t ask people to reread to get your point. If you&#39;ve said  <br/>
something that has confused people, it&#39;s an opportunity to rethink  <br/>
how you communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Carriage returns would help. Periods and capitalization would help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  i know that to make<br/>
&gt; a similar point about how rules are bad or how labels are wrong the<br/>
&gt; same logic has been applied.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a home where we&#39;re raising kids to think, rules for behavior don&#39;t  <br/>
help. Rules just say, for instance, &quot;Don&#39;t hit.&quot; They don&#39;t say  <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t bite.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t poke.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t tease.&quot; ...<br/>
<br/>
But if the philosophy is to be kind and respectful, we don&#39;t need to  <br/>
spell out everything that&#39;s not kind and not respectful. Putting the  <br/>
philosophy of being kind and respectful into action in a variety of  <br/>
contexts helps kids think about what it means to kind and respectful  <br/>
and why.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we do need rules in society since we&#39;re not all raised to be  <br/>
generous. Some people are raised to grasp what they can. Different  <br/>
families have different ideas about what is &quot;fair&quot;. There are parents  <br/>
who would take their little kids to NC-17 movies because it&#39;s too  <br/>
inconvenient to get a baby sitter. There are parents who would leave  <br/>
their kids locked up in the car while they went into a bar.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i just think that an address with regard to<br/>
&gt; societal respect not just personal respect is important too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you&#39;re being vague about who is being disrespected.<br/>
<br/>
It could be the person who set it up. It could be the people who  <br/>
participate. It could be the people who don&#39;t get to participate.<br/>
<br/>
All that matters to someone who lives life by philosophy rather than  <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if the birth date on the website is so irrelivant what about a fake<br/>
&gt; id to get into bars or why not just buy coke since i am a smart and<br/>
&gt; critical thinking person arent they all the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This shows a lack of critical thinking by treating all age  <br/>
restrictions as though they&#39;re the same. Why do the age restrictions  <br/>
exist? What&#39;s their purpose? What are the consequences of breaking them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i thought we were trying to accomplish modeling a behavior<br/>
&gt; that wasnt about following rules to avoid punishment or to be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Whose* rights are being impeached on? You&#39;re just stating it as  <br/>
though it&#39;s a fact.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a question meant to point out that the RUN site is an  <br/>
exception. That and the above questions are at the heart of acting  <br/>
and thinking critically.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506240493">Yet we have a history of many times when someone (or some group) <br/>
*chose* to break a law/rule because that law/rule was flawed. Should <br/>
they have not broken the law because it was the law? Laws/Rules are <br/>
made for a reason. Sometimes the reasoning is flawed. That&#39;s why <br/>
there are mechanisms in place to change them (most of the time). As <br/>
was already mentioned a couple of times, what I seek to impart to my <br/>
offspring is not &quot;follow all rules/laws&quot; but rather &quot;Examine the <br/>
rules/laws. Why was it made? Who is it intended to help or protect? <br/>
What are the consequences of not following that rule/law? Is it a <br/>
flawed rule/law that needs to be changed? Are you willing to face the <br/>
consequences in order to be an agent of change?&quot; and so on. No rules <br/>
or laws of our society are so sacred that they cannot and should not <br/>
be critically examined. Sure, I can agree that murder is right out <br/>
and there needs to be an appropriately severe consequence to it. <br/>
Driving under the influence of mental function altering substances is <br/>
dangerous to many, invoking consequences to perhaps, for some, cause <br/>
them to think twice before engaging in such behavior, makes sense. <br/>
Creating a law that says that my 18 yr old son (when he gets to 18 <br/>
that is, he&#39;s only 10 now) MUST register for a potential military <br/>
draft and possibly go into battle - that one requires thought - what <br/>
are the options for NOT fighting? is it worth the consequences to NOT <br/>
register? should it be changed in some way to allow more options?<br/>
<br/>
Heck, go back 25 years and HOMESCHOOLING was illegal and <br/>
people &#39;fudged&#39; things, went underground, faced jail time, and now we <br/>
have an abundance of homeschooling options anywhere you go in this <br/>
country. Should those parents NOT have &#39;fudged&#39; things to retain <br/>
custody of their children while they worked to change the laws?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67523547">I often use my birthdate to get Simon and Linnaea full-entry on to an on-line site. Partially because I can remember it better than I can some hedging of their own birthday, but also because it seems legitimate, in my head, to see myself as the person who is signing up for the access. <br/>
<br/>
When Simon first got on to Neopets I signed him up at the age he was at the time. I then wrote the letter that was required to get him access to the rest of the website. It took almost a month. It wasn&#39;t very convenient. He got frustrated. I decided that it was easier for me to give my approval for him to access the adult sections of an on-line membership without jumping the hurdle that the service required. <br/>
<br/>
There is this really cool climbing and zip swing sliding and treetop walking park near us. You have to be a certain height and 10 years old to participate. Linnaea is almost the height, but she&#39;s 8 and a bit. I talked about why they would have an age limit. There are lots of age limited access to things in the UK, far more than I remember there being in the U.S. So it isn&#39;t a new discussion. She was completely not comfortable with the idea of lying about her age to get into the harness and up the trees. Changing her age to access Neopets hasn&#39;t been a slippery slope for her into the realm of lying about her age. She doesn&#39;t want to be older than she is. And if she really wanted to go and do something that had an age limit I would work really hard to find ways around lying about her age. <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Children on Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~if i choose to use it and my expose and encourage my childs<br/>
use of a site how respectful am i being and are we being when we<br/>
violate the stipulations of the person or persons who the site<br/>
belongs to. does that model respect.~~<br/>
<br/>
Are you more concerned about respecting an arbitrary age rule, set up<br/>
to protect a network from liability issues or respecting your child&#39;s<br/>
desire to connect with friends? That&#39;s where you and I differ (amongst<br/>
many other things). I choose to respect my child more than some<br/>
arbitrary rule. Doesn&#39;t mean we ignore all rules. We can logically<br/>
analyze whether there is a good reason for something and whether it is<br/>
a useful rule. <br/>
<br/>
The age of thirteen isn&#39;t some magical age that indicates a child&#39;s<br/>
ability to properly utilize an online community.<br/>
<br/>
~~lets face it in a society we do need some rules not just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people following their own critical thought as that would lead to <br/>
&gt; complete oligarchy which by the way would eb the natural end result <br/>
&gt; of anarchy.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess that&#39;s another point we differ on. I don&#39;t think rules and<br/>
laws prevent anything. Maybe to a small degree. But mostly it just<br/>
gives the law makers the ability to punish people. Laws exist to allow<br/>
punishment for not following the law. They don&#39;t exist to prevent<br/>
anything (thought the makers seem to think they do).<br/>
<br/>
More laws don&#39;t equal less problems.<br/>
<br/>
~~if the birth date on the website is so irrelivant what about a fake <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; id to get into bars or why not just buy coke since i am a smart and <br/>
&gt; critical thinking person arent they all the same thing?~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you think that any and all lying about age is the same thing, that<br/>
shows a lack of critical thinking. It&#39;s faulty logic.<br/>
<br/>
As for fake ID, my parents didn&#39;t drink or allow any alcohol in our<br/>
home. They certainly never lied about our ages. I borrowed a fake ID<br/>
at age 18 and went bar hopping. Actually, I&#39;d been bar hopping before<br/>
and never got carded! The night I borrowed the fake ID I met my<br/>
husband of 19 years.:) Funny how things can work out eh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating &quot;ignore all rules&quot; but I&#39;m also baffled when people<br/>
say that by ignoring an age rule it somehow equates to any and all age<br/>
fudging as being equal. It&#39;s not. <br/>
<br/>
~~ i thought we were trying to accomplish modeling a behavior <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that wasnt about following rules to avoid punishment or to be <br/>
&gt; rewarded but to respect those around us and ourselves in a way that <br/>
&gt; allows us to just live and have our very life shine through with a <br/>
&gt; manner that by its very essence does not impeach anothers right at <br/>
&gt; self regulation.~ ~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And by choosing to fudge a birth date to join a lively group of<br/>
unschoolers who have enriched our lives immensely, we in NO way are<br/>
impeaching upon any one else&#39;s right at self regulation. Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should go read at the site itself and see how the children<br/>
are sharing their art,their dreams, their birthdays, their joys and<br/>
concerns, their lives with each other. It&#39;s a beautiful thing and I&#39;m<br/>
glad for parents that are giving their child access to such rich<br/>
connections! Without ever causing infringement upon any other human<br/>
being or their rights. Cool huh?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen anyone suggest rules are useless.  Instead, I believe <br/>
what is being said is that everyone makes their own choices about <br/>
whether or not to follow a certain rule/law.  I do not break every <br/>
law, but I&#39;ll confess I have sometimes broken a rule.  I sometimes <br/>
speed in my vehicle.  I have lied about being sick to get a day off <br/>
at work (if caught doing so in one particular job, it was grounds for <br/>
terminaion).  I think people make choices every day that have <br/>
consequences.  Laws are supposedly written for the good of the <br/>
public.  But what about some of the crazy laws that have made it onto <br/>
the books?  Have you ever researched those?  Am I really criminal if <br/>
I utter the phrase &#39;Oh boy&#39; in Jonesboro Georgia, which reportedly <br/>
does have a law on the books making that illegal?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think our country is on the verge of destruction because some <br/>
people don&#39;t follow all the rules all the time.  History also shows <br/>
many people breaking laws and dealing with consequences.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that, in the rule/law-bound societies that we have <br/>
NOW, there is absolutely NO chaos, NO death, and NO disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for laws and rules! They are soooo comforting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824035129">I always thought it was funny that &quot;rules&quot; always say &quot;Don&#39;t&quot; first so the only thing a child <br/>
hears is bite, poke, tease, hit.  Why don&#39;t parents do the positive thing?  Why is it usually <br/>
negative?  Parental history?  I don&#39;t know, but if a child only hears the final word why not <br/>
have it be peace?  or love? or play? try this? (redirection) or (insert your word here).  It is no <br/>
wonder to me that most children by the time they are 2 are saying NO!  They hear it <br/>
constantly.  <br/>
<br/>
When we had children we chose not to do it that way and it was miraculous --the children <br/>
were happy, loving, and didn&#39;t start yelling NO at age 2...or 3.....or 4....or even now. LOL  If <br/>
we want to be respectful and help our children, guide our children, shouldn&#39;t they be able <br/>
to learn to make good decisions and take the natural consequences of the poor ones?  I <br/>
don&#39;t mean stand there and watch as your baby pulls a boiling pot of water down on <br/>
herself or a toddler put his hand on a flaming stove.  Those consequences are too severe, <br/>
but I mean letting them learn while redirecting their behavior in a positive way till they are <br/>
able to understand the differences.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if I am making sense right now, so tired.  So I apologize if my critical brain <br/>
cells are currently down.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I just knew from my background that I didn&#39;t want to behave the way my parents did and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want my children to hate me the way I hated them.  Abuse is not an option.  So I <br/>
discussed it with my husband, we read a lot and we found a way to be that was ok for <br/>
both of us.  He had been spanked on occasion but knew why, I had been beaten.  I felt <br/>
spanking was evil and wanted it not in my home.  Where is the peace in that???  So he went <br/>
along, and although he did spank a couple times, that was all it took for him to see it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work and would not be a good way if we wanted a happy home.  sounds cheesy, I <br/>
know.  But I am the only one to break the mold of my family.  I have to work at it all the <br/>
time.  I have to remember that rules aren&#39;t laws.  There is a difference.  I hope my children <br/>
will do the same, but they have their own agency to choose.  They will make their choices <br/>
based on the information they have. My job is to help them find all the information they <br/>
need or want.<br/>
<br/>
We are the models they will take with them when they are grown and have families of their <br/>
own. If we practice what we preach they will know, if we don&#39;t it will show.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193305486">Yeah, we fudged DS&#39; age on Neopets also - and I recently had a<br/>
discussion with him about being careful about giving out information<br/>
since not everyone is who they say they are (in regards to a 19 yr old<br/>
from somewhere or other who sent a friend request). Basically, I just<br/>
asked that he let us know about such requests before he adds them as<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
And, I thought of a time when I&#39;m basically always &quot;fudging&quot; things<br/>
either overtly or covertly (that is verbally or non verbally). When I go<br/>
to a bookstore (say B&N) and use my Educator Discount card on a stack of<br/>
Pokemon books and MASH season DVDs and such. I -do- divide out things<br/>
that are gifts for others and stuff that is strictly my own reading<br/>
material. But, most of the stuff in the pile is stuff that will be used<br/>
for our life as a family (books on herb gardening for instance). Most of<br/>
the time, no one asks about it, they just take the discount but on<br/>
occasion I&#39;ve been asked &quot;Is this for classroom use?&quot; W-e-e-l-l-l by<br/>
their definition of &#39;classroom&#39; Not exactly; by our definition (all the<br/>
world&#39;s a stage and we are but learners on&#39;t) yes, definitely. So, I say<br/>
Yes. Definite fudge factor there - but then again the answer to the<br/>
question is not black & white.<br/>
