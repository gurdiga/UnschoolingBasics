<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493719434">I&#39;m not sure - but my kids are 21, 18, and 15 and all three picked up  <br/>
how to multiply multiple-digit numbers, divide multiple-digit numbers  <br/>
using long division. They learned how to add and subtract and  <br/>
multiply and divide fractions. They know how to convert decimals to  <br/>
fractions vice versa. They understand percentages and their  <br/>
equivalent decimal formats. They can figure out percentages of numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Past that - they picked up a pretty good understanding of probability  <br/>
- but not formal algorithms about how to compute probabilities (I  <br/>
doubt most adults know that, either).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve picked up a good sense of measurement, a bit of geometry, and  <br/>
a little algebra - not much.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I think math requires more conscious effort to learn - I  <br/>
doubt anybody is going to pick up advanced algebra or calculus in  <br/>
their daily life - but lots of kids decide to learn it because they  <br/>
want to do so for a specific reason.<br/>
<br/>
I have a good story about how Roxana learned long division, though.<br/>
<br/>
She was passionately interested in CATS - the musical. For years we  <br/>
lived and breathed CATS. I think I saw it live something like 12  <br/>
times - and watched the video many more times. We made costumes. We  <br/>
learned to do the make-up. She learned to play the songs on the  <br/>
piano. She wrote CATS fan fiction. We read T.S. Elliot. We listened  <br/>
to CATS in different languages.  My mother took Roxana to London and  <br/>
they went to see CATS there. It was the longest-running show, ever,  <br/>
on Broadway. And we talked about going to see it there. But then - OH  <br/>
NO - it was scheduled to close on Broadway. Roxana was REALLY wanting  <br/>
to go see it, before it closed.<br/>
<br/>
So - I was doing laundry and she asked me, &quot;Hey, Mom, how far away is  <br/>
New York City?&quot; I said, &quot;Around 3,000 miles.&quot; Then she asked, &quot;How  <br/>
far could we drive in a day?&quot; I told her some number - I think it was  <br/>
350 miles per day. I was busy, folding laundry, and when I looked at  <br/>
what she was doing, she had put 3,000 at the top of a paper and was  <br/>
subtracting 350 from it, over and over. I asked her what she was  <br/>
doing and she said she was figuring out how many 350&#39;s there were in  <br/>
3,000 because that&#39;s how many days it would take us to drive to NYC.  <br/>
BUT - she&#39;d made a subtraction mistake, early on, and had just  <br/>
realized it. So she was a little frustrated and I said, &quot;I can show  <br/>
you an easier way to do that.&quot; She jumped at the chance to do it  <br/>
easier - but I told her I&#39;d have to show her some simpler ones first.  <br/>
She was okay with that - so I started with 6 divided by 3 and then 60  <br/>
divided by 3 and then 60 dividid by 30 and so on - just showed her  <br/>
examples, progressively more complex, and then said, &quot;Okay, you  <br/>
should be able to divide 3,000 by 350 now.<br/>
<br/>
So - she did it. And then asked for more problems to practice on.<br/>
<br/>
The entire process took less than 30 minutes, including the time she  <br/>
spent working problems she asked me to write down for her.<br/>
<br/>
 From then on, she always knew how to do long division. The other day  <br/>
I saw her doing it - and it involved decimals - she had no problem  <br/>
with it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re as much a part of real life as addition and subtraction.  <br/>
Multiplication and subtraction both are just quick ways to do,  <br/>
respectively, repeated addition and subtraction. As your kids get  <br/>
older they&#39;ll be in situations that need multiplication and division.<br/>
<br/>
Percentages come up in video games, art and photography programs,  <br/>
sales, tip, tax ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535071849">Here&#39;s one example for how it works out for us. I just bought a new treadmill. Sarah wants to walk on it and eventually run, working up to where she can run the mile for the Young Marines Physical Training Tests with a good time. <br/>
   <br/>
  She played around with the speed, the timer, and the distance; she asked questions and I gave her answers. She asked some of herself and figured out the answers as she walked. <br/>
   <br/>
  She now has a better understanding of tenths and hundredths as well as percentages (this distance is 15% of a mile, or it&#39;s a quarter to my goal or 80% towards my goal) because she is using them towards her own goals. <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope that helps! Beth<br/>
