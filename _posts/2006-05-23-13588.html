<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048634426">Hi! We won a Tivo and are not sure we want or can<br/>
afford it. When we plugged it in and went to set it up<br/>

definately a high pitch hum. There doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
anyway to shut it off. Two questions: 1-Is it supposed<br/>
to have that hum? We sleep in the living room and I<br/>
know it would make me crazy! 2- What happens if you<br/>
unplug it at night so it can&#39;t hum? Thanks-ELISA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082579923">We have TiVo through DirecTV, and it does not make any noise what-so-<br/>
ever.  From my knowledge, you would have quite a process to go through <br/>
if you unhooked the power every night.  I&#39;d just call the service <br/>
provider and have them straighten it out.  It really shouldn&#39;t make <br/>
any noise.<br/>

Some people are more attuned to noises than others. I haven&#39;t noticed <br/>
any hum in ours, but I&#39;m not terribly sensitive to  that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you unplug it, it won&#39;t record things during the nighth---if that&#39;s <br/>
no problem. It takes a few minutes to reboot every time you turn it off <br/>
& back on. But if you have nothing to record at 3:00 am, it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be a problem!<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
