<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139827306">Hi all, just wanted to share something, that maybe will help those who are still struggling <br/>
with videogames (or maybe it won&#39;t help at all, but I thought it was interesting)<br/>
<br/>
We stopped video game limitations probably about two years ago, and the kids had a <br/>
definite upsurge in time spent, and then a decrease, averaging about two hours a day <br/>
when they were fully past that testing period. I didn&#39;t think anything of it, didn&#39;t even track <br/>
it because it was too difficult, with six kids playing, plus dh and I, who know how long <br/>
anyone actually playing any game?<br/>
<br/>
Well, when we got the Wii in December, there was again the upsurge in playing, and then <br/>
the decrease. The funny thing is yesterday Josh was drawing a chart. I thought that was a <br/>
little odd, so I asked what was up, and he explained that the wii keeps track of your daily <br/>
playing, and he was charting it to see what it looked like. How funny! So the first day he <br/>
had it, between the lot of us, we played for SIXTEEN HOURS. That&#39;s pretty much every <br/>
waking hour of the day. Of course, some of us sleep later than others and stay up later <br/>
than others, however, it&#39;s still a lot of playing time. After about six weeks, it drops to six <br/>
hours a day, which is less than an hour for each of us, approximately, taking into account <br/>
that we have only one wiimote and have to take turns playing. At eight weeks, Josh&#39;s <br/>
birthday occurred, he got three new games, and playing went up a little, but not a whole <br/>
bunch.<br/>
<br/>
So it really emphasizes that novelty will increase playing time, and the longer you keep it a <br/>
novelty, the longer playing time will be. However!! I&#39;m not saying that you should drop <br/>
limitations with the hope of seeing a child decrease playing time, that&#39;s not the point at all. <br/>
.Josh still plays the game system about four to five hours a day. He loves it, and it&#39;s fun, <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest if it&#39;s educational. I have friends who will only let their <br/>
children do things that &#39;edify&#39; them. Well, that&#39;s great, but to be honest, *I* don&#39;t want to <br/>
only do things that make me a better person. I love surfing the web following a train of <br/>
thought and reading snopes, I read lots of horror and scifi, which does nothing more for <br/>
me than makes me happy. I have four or five hobbies that I only touch on rare occasions, <br/>
and I don&#39;t even consider it &#39;quitting&#39; when I set it aside, I&#39;m &#39;saving it&#39; for when I&#39;m in the <br/>
mood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I discovered recently that I was doing exactly that. Reading to educate me.<br/>
It was either non-fiction on topics directly related to my life (not some topic that &quot;simply&quot; interested me). Or fiction, but then either in a language I wasn&#39;t too good at, or at least by an author from a country I was learning about, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I sure enjoyed all this reading, but nevertheless it was never for-fun-*only*. Now I&#39;m wondering. Is that the way it has to be, like learning from *everything* we do, or is it some kind of &quot;must not waste time on doing nonsense&quot;? It wasn&#39;t a conscious decission back then, it just happened.<br/>
<br/>
Well, just trying to understand myself while deschooling...<br/>

<br/>
Josh was on the phone with a friend and started to leave the room...I was like &quot;WAIT...can <br/>
you help me to the end of the boss stage?&quot;. I could hear his friend say &quot;Who is THAT?&quot; &quot;Oh, <br/>
my mom, she loves video games but she&#39;s high maintainance on them&quot; LOL! But he gladly <br/>
helped me and his friend thinks it&#39;s cool that I try. :-P I just want Zelda for the Wii, but all <br/>
of our money has gone for points to buy the classic games. <br/>

 My kids got Guitar Hero for Christmas and it took me DAYS to figure<br/>
out how to play the game!!  I am proud to say I am pretty competent at<br/>
it.... we won&#39;t talk about how stumped I am by most of the other games<br/>
but the Guitar Hero thing makes sense to my brain!  Until we got GH I<br/>
thought I was somehow mentally deficient that I couldn&#39;t figure out<br/>
how to get a stinking little frog across the highway without him<br/>
meeting his death under a semi truck!!   And don&#39;t even get me started<br/>

I laughed at this comment, Ren, because I usually do the same thing.  :-)  BUT...I have FINALLY discovered a video game that I can actually play w/o assistance from my children...YAY!!!  My 14-year-old ds got Guitar Hero 2 last weekend and it is AWESOME!  I made it all the way through Van Halen&#39;s &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; (albeit on the EASY level, but I usually never make it that far even in practice mode in other games) and I was literally shouting and dancing around the room because I was so proud of myself!  My kids were a little frightened, but they got over it.  ;-)<br/>
