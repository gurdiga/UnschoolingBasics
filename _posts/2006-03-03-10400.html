Got the test results back today, and both boys are showing no food  <br/>
allergy reactions at all. As mentioned, Dan has been getting daily  <br/>
wheat for two months, so if it was a truly allergy, it would have  <br/>
shown up. Doctor now wants to wait a year until he&#39;s older (because  <br/>
older kids are more likely to react to blood test) and do a blood  <br/>
test specific for celiac (which is kind of what I thought we were  <br/>
doingGRRR!) He says to go ahead and follow our &#39;intuition&#39;, allowing  <br/>
wheat however he feels comfortable. Sounds dangerous to me, he has  <br/>
never shown signs of delayed growth because we stopped giving him  <br/>
wheat at 9months. He does have all of the digestive signs, and  <br/>
complains of pain in his arm and leg bones (much more than our other  <br/>
kids have with growth pains)<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve read is that it&#39;s imperative to just do a biopsy and get it  <br/>
over with. Please, anyone have response? Thanks to all, feel free to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16399720">I have many friends and family with a large range of problems from diabetes<br/>
to skin problems and those include allergies. In my experience, sometimes<br/>
you have to take control of the situation. If the doctor isn&#39;t doing what<br/>
you want them to do it is best for you and your family that you find a<br/>
doctor who will. All insurances have a second opinion clause even if you<br/>
have to search for it and no distance is too far for your child&#39;s health.<br/>
This too I speak from experience - we drive half a day for my son&#39;s heart<br/>
check-ups (congenital heart runs in the family and he has to be checked<br/>
every six months).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448347676">Hi, Melissa.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly lurk on the list (this is one of a few unschooling lists I <br/>
subscribe to, so I find it&#39;s time consuming to sometimes just keep <br/>
up with reading! ;)  ).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for what it&#39;s worth I wanted to mention the Specific <br/>
Carbohydrate Diet.  Here&#39;s a link to the main website:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/">http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
 From what I understand, it works on the basis that the gut is <br/>
damaged so it cannot digest certain foods right now.  By avoiding <br/>
certain carbohydrates and allowing foods the body can currently <br/>
digest well, you allow the gut to heal.  And eventually you can <br/>
gradually reintroduce what might have been offending foods.<br/>
<br/>
Also from what I understand,  it&#39;s different from gluten-free in <br/>
thta it avoids pretty much all grains, not just gluten, but does <br/>
allow plenty of carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables.  (Hence <br/>
the name &quot;specific carbohydrate&quot;.)<br/>
But it seems you do not have to be on the diet for the rest of your <br/>
life, only enough time to allow the gut to heal.  Although some do <br/>
choose to stay on it for longer periods.<br/>
<br/>
It seems the diet has been successful for many people who suffer <br/>
from IBS, Crohn&#39;s, celiac, even autistic kids, have benefitted.  <br/>
Thought it might be worth mentioning and looking at the info.  Good <br/>
luck.<br/>
<br/>
As for a sort of miniintroduction from me (because I really can&#39;t <br/>
remember if I posted one yet or not):  Hi, I&#39;m Terri.  I have one <br/>
dd, who is 3.5 years old.  We are enjoying this unschooling life, <br/>
have let go of many controls, and it is great.  I still have much to <br/>
learn though and I enjoy reading what everyone has to say and <br/>
discuss.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Terri J<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548719313">Thanks Nicole for your reply.<br/>
<br/>
We will definitely stay wheat free, someone suggested a good GI here  <br/>
that we can talk to. The diet is hard. It&#39;s really hard because wheat  <br/>
is in all the food. And he reacts to it on his skin. that&#39;s why I was  <br/>
so convinced it&#39;s a wheat allergy. He reacts to gluten and starch.  <br/>
Like you said, we don&#39;t want to cause damage. He doesn&#39;t have delayed  <br/>
growth, but he does already have the signs of brittle bones, and many  <br/>
of the other symptoms of CD. Funny, my daughter is autistic, and  <br/>
wheat free doesn&#39;t affect her at all, but the corn really does.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part is with unschooling lifestyle. We have to control so  <br/>
MUCH of what they can eat. He desperately wants all these yummy  <br/>
snacks. It&#39;s difficult to go with the flow of like, going to the zoo  <br/>
or out to eat, because we can&#39;t just buy whatever is there.  <br/>
Everything is so planned.<br/>
<br/>
Now I just sound whiny. LOL! How do other families live this radical  <br/>
unschooling style with restrictions like this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423717539">Maybe if you treat the wheat free as a lifestyle choice, rather than a restriction/control, perhaps  that would help. I know families who are vegan who always pack snacks when they go anywhere, because they understand that there may not always be vegan choices.   With going out to eat, they understand that there aren&#39;t always a lot of vegan choices, so they don&#39;t go out that often. You could involve him in what are his choices to take as snacks, where could you go to eat, what would be a good choice to make. <br/>

is in all the food. And he reacts to it on his skin.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  Ugh ! yes it is hard and expensive! Im currently learning how to make things my son will eat from scratch because I cant afford to keep buying all the mixes and prepared breads from misrobens. <br/>
  If feel its worth it though. My son had horrible skin rashes ..worst case of eczema Id ever seen and I could either remove offending foods ( gluten, casein and soy in our case) or spend a fortune on steriod creams, doc visits to get them, elidal and otc the counter stuff . <br/>
   <br/>
  Funny, my daughter is autistic, and  <br/>
wheat free doesn&#39;t affect her at all, but the corn really does.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  ewwwww  ((    )) that can be an even tougher one. Are you aware that most of the citric acid added to foods is corn derived?<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  He desperately wants all these yummy  <br/>
snacks. It&#39;s difficult to go with the flow of like, going to the zoo  <br/>
or out to eat, because we can&#39;t just buy whatever is there.  <br/>
Everything is so planned.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  That part is tough. I generaly pack a lunch for everyone for a zoo trips but we go almost weekly and it ends up being $30 for the 4 of us to buy lunch there. <br/>
  Occasionaly at Mcdonalds ill talk the manager out of a kids meal bad and chicken nugget container. Then make my son&#39;s nuggets at home and bring them with us to serve with everyone else. You can also bring your favorite gluten free bun along and request just a meat patty w/o grill seasoning ( often has gluten fillers).<br/>
   <br/>
  You may also want to consider a good digestive enzyme and give it when they cheat occasionaly. <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Now I just sound whiny. LOL! How do other families live this radical  <br/>
unschooling style with restrictions like this.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  naw you dont sound whiny . It is tough. As far as the redical unschooling lifestyle ....<br/>
  er well Im just getting started on this road and DS is in sped preschool and we havent decided when or if to pull him out. <br/>
  I try to let my children take the lead but its hard with Nathaniel. He is completely non verbal so I cant ask him what he wants , the only signs Ive managed to get across to him are eat and more. So for now I have to trust that his happiness when he gets to the school, his dragging me to his class and the big hug he usualy gives the closest teacher are signs that he is content where he is right now. <br/>

&gt; preschool and we havent decided when or if to pull him out.<br/>
&gt;   I try to let my children take the lead but its hard with  <br/>
&gt; Nathaniel. He is completely non verbal so I cant ask him what he  <br/>
&gt; wants , the only signs Ive managed to get across to him are eat and  <br/>
&gt; more. So for now I have to trust that his happiness when he gets to  <br/>
&gt; the school, his dragging me to his class and the big hug he usualy  <br/>
&gt; gives the closest teacher are signs that he is content where he is  <br/>
&gt; right now.<br/>

daughter was like that when we started this road, but with a lot of  <br/>
prompting, she got to the point where she would ask for just about  <br/>
anything with one word. Then we moved on to that one word with &#39;more&#39;  <br/>
or &#39;please&#39; When she was five, we got to the point where we could  <br/>
hold up three fingers and say, &quot;Three words please&quot;. We&#39;d usually get  <br/>
&#39;more crackers please&#39;. Now that she&#39;s eight, we usually prompt her  <br/>
with &#39;I need a sentence please&#39;, although on days that she is  <br/>
stressed, we move back to holding up fingers and asking for a number  <br/>
of words. She really is much happier, and I&#39;d say about a quarter of  <br/>
the time she will ask independently for something she really really  <br/>
wants. Just keep labeling for now, and it&#39;ll happen.<br/>
<br/>
We kept Breanna in school all through kindergarten. And TBH, it was a  <br/>
great program up til first grade. She was joyful to be there, and the  <br/>
kids really were great with her. But once academics got serious, she  <br/>
was miserable, the schools didn&#39;t know what to do with her, they  <br/>
didn&#39;t know how to teach her, and basically they were stressing her  <br/>
out. Thankfully, or else dh would never been on board with  <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
