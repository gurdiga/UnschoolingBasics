<div id="ygrps-yiv-903362310">&quot; he said he<br/>
likes playing the computer war games, and the weapons are related to<br/>
real wars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trevor too...he originally got interested in wars and weaponry by<br/>
watching &quot;mail call&quot; on the history channel. He would spout off all<br/>
sorts of interesting factoids about weapons at the darndest times.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been a pretty serious gamer for many years now...I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
any &quot;waning&quot; of the hours he spends on games and computers, but that&#39;s<br/>
his life.  He&#39;s mega into technology, has learned to build and repair<br/>
computers and loves the complicated games. He&#39;s also very willing to<br/>
walk away if we have interesting plans, or to help me out if I need it.<br/>
So while there is no &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; syndrome going on, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily mean a waning in time spent on an activity.<br/>
<br/>
I really think if a parent is waiting around for a child to spend less<br/>
time on ANYTHING, that is the wrong attitude. Would you say &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
waiting for him to spend less time reading those darn books&quot;?<br/>
or &quot;I really hope this fascination with nature starts waning soon&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Tv, video games and computers are valid sources for learning. They are<br/>
not secondary, or less than or better than other sources, unless you<br/>
love them...then they ARE better.:)<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is your child loves, don&#39;t hope for them to spend less<br/>
time on it, hope that they feel secure and safe enough with you that<br/>
it isn&#39;t an issue at all.<br/>
