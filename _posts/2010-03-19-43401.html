<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788579589">My husband came from a poor family that didn&#39;t have tv and video  <br/>
games. He was made to work at an early age of 6 I think. He had to get  <br/>
up at 4am and check on the animals miles from his house and then still  <br/>
go to school. I myself feel like a child should have  1-2 little   <br/>
chores like dishes or feeding a peg. I had chores and didn&#39;t always do  <br/>
them and now I don&#39;t enjoy them as an adult. Anyway, what happened is  <br/>
my husband got mad earlier yesterday because I told my 11 yo son he  <br/>
could buy a used video game. He had some money and I didn&#39;t mind  <br/>
giving him a few dollars. My husband Fili came home around 8:45pm and  <br/>
said he needed our son to help him with work. He told me to save them  <br/>
dinner. Well, it&#39;s 4:05 am and they are still not here! I am so pissed  <br/>
off with him. I think it&#39;s crazy! Our son R does so much helping us  <br/>
around the house and then he doesn&#39;t even want him to play video  <br/>
games?!?! Fili says he makes him get up earlier to help him cause he  <br/>
wants him to be a man. He&#39;s still a kid! A great kid. R called me  <br/>
around 11:30pm and told me that his dad said the money he could&#39;ve  <br/>
used for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead. Then when Fili saw  <br/>
Romeo was on the phone he made him hang up. Fili hates when I  <br/>
criticize what he does with him. Fili is not R&#39;s real dad but R  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know it. A friend told me that because he isn&#39;t his real son,  <br/>
he&#39;ll always be like that towarda him. I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know and I  <br/>
could really use your advice. Thank you, Stephanie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither part of that is necessarily true - people can form very strong bonds with non-biological offspring, for one, and the issues you describe seem to have more to do with something other than biological parentage, too. They are issues a lot of men struggle with as a parents of sons, and some handle more gracefully than others. Be gentle with your spouse as much as you can, he&#39;s dealing with some tough personal issues wrapped around ideas of masculinity and responsibility and what it means to be A Father.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Fili hates when I  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really tricky territory to negotiate because while on the one hand you want to stand up for your child, no-one likes to be criticized, and criticism doesn&#39;t tend to help relationships. In a sense, your dh&#39;s relationship with you ds is about them, not you or even unschooling. Its something they have to work out between them.<br/>
<br/>
When George and I were first together, he was pretty harsh with Ray. He saw that as his job as a Dad, to be the harsh guy, the rule-keeper, the &quot;asshole&quot; as he put it. He didn&#39;t like that, but he thought it was something he Had to do for Ray&#39;s benefit. My jumping in between them and leaving George feel like he was &quot;doing it wrong&quot; as a parent didn&#39;t help very much, it just left George feeling vulnerable and trying harder to be a Good Dad, and to him that meant the biggest &quot;asshole&quot; he could be. <br/>
<br/>
Talking to George when Ray wasn&#39;t around was more helpful. I could ask him what kind of relationship he Wanted to have with his son, and hear some of the baggage that men carry into fatherhood. I didn&#39;t argue with him about his baggage, and I think that helped. He didn&#39;t need me to help him process that stuff, he needed me to love him in all his imperfections. Beyond that, I worked on saying kind things to George about his parenting. I made an effort to notice, out loud, when he was patient, or sweet, or thoughtful. I found ways to let him know I appreciated how hard he was trying for the sake of his boy. I also found ways to offer him some of the same love and support I was offering the kids - to give George the same emotional benefits of unschooling, essentially. <br/>
<br/>
Over time, his attitude about what it meant to be a dad softened. He started offering more kindness to Ray, and saw the way their relationship improved. Nowadays George is a committed radical unschooling parent - some of that is likely personality, but he&#39;s also not unique. Other dads have made the same unlikely transition, part way or all the way. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, what happened is  <br/>

&gt; giving him a few dollars.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that would likely be better discussed when things calm down a little - not the situation itself, but the underlying ideas of &quot;who&#39;s money is it&quot; and how the decision to give it / spend it comes about. There are two different parts to that, too - what kind of expectations does you dh have about the money your son &quot;has&quot; - is it a gift, is it something he&#39;s worked for and &quot;owns&quot; or is it something he&#39;s been entrusted with. Most parents will say money &quot;belongs&quot; to the child but treat it like a trust, with conditions on it. So having those expectations in clear air could help. Again, I&#39;m not saying you should argue or criticize. It may be better to let your husband vent his feelings on the matter so he can feel heard and validated.<br/>
<br/>
The other part of the issue is that you gave your ds some money - whose money was it? Was it &quot;family money&quot;? or part of your designated &quot;spending money&quot;? If it was &quot;family money&quot; then maybe your dh feels left out of the process. If he&#39;s the main income provider, he may even feel like its &quot;his&quot; money, and you&#39;re merely entrusted with it. That&#39;s an uncomfortable situation for you, for sure, but if its something you know up-front, rather than an implied expectation, its easier to make decisions about how you want to deal with that in personal terms. If the money was &quot;yours&quot; then that&#39;s something else to discuss - you did not expect to be paid back in the fashion your dh is imposing on your child, and don&#39;t necessarily want that kind of repayment in the future. <br/>
<br/>
Do y&#39;all know any other unschoolers in real life, or is there a way your dh can meet some unschooling dads? There are some fantastic dads out there who are pretty darned &quot;manly&quot; without being &quot;assholes&quot; and that might be soothing to your dh. He doesn&#39;t Have To hold some imaginary line in order to be a good father of a son. <br/>

<br/>
    We don&#39;t know any unschoolers;but maybe a conference would help or  <br/>
try to find some around here. That would be awesome to find other  <br/>
&quot;manly&quot; unschooling dads! Lol We&#39;re just starting out with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling and she  <br/>
was saying that she views her kids as guests and that they didn&#39;t ask  <br/>
to be here and that they don&#39;t owe us anything. Wow, that really  <br/>
resonated with me. I was just talking to Fili and I told him this. He  <br/>
said she was absolutely right and so he says that he&#39;s going to let  <br/>
them ( the kids) be freer (it&#39;s a start!). I was so upset and was  <br/>
thinking of seperating and so I&#39;m glad he wants to do this. Thanks  <br/>
Meredith for answering. I didn&#39;t have anyone to talk to. Stephanie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929843496">Dearest Meredith<br/>
<br/>
Have I ever told you how impressed I am with the posts you send in reply to what others send out? I find your post to be VERY thought through, nurturing, looking at the most impossible angels and still be rational and all encompassing.<br/>
<br/>
Are you putting your valuable know-how into something like a book to benefit others eventually? So much love and understanding and experience is focussed on you already.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get &#39;your book&#39; some time soon. The world needs it, I think.<br/>

go to school.***<br/>
<br/>
While he was growing up your husband probably heard the hard work and <br/>
responsibility was good for him.<br/>
Because he could not change what was happening to him he probably accepted <br/>
it to be true.<br/>
He &quot;turned out&quot; to be a good, hard working, responsible person so he has <br/>
justified the work he was made to do as a child.<br/>
<br/>
It seems he cares a great deal about your son.  He wants to ensure Romeo <br/>
will &quot;turn out&quot; well.  I understand your concern about his methods, though.<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;m way behind on email so someone may have given you this link <br/>
already.  There is an email list called &quot;Peaceful Partnerships&quot; at : <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships/?yguid=279647515">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships/?yguid=279647515</a><br/>
and you may find some helpful advice there.   If you can build a better <br/>
relationship between yourself and your husband, if you can understand his <br/>
point of view and motivations, I think you&#39;ll be better able to help him <br/>
build good relationships with your children.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t change your husband.  You already know that.  But you can consider <br/>
why he is the way he is.  In some peaceful moment you might talk with him <br/>
about his childhood and tell him you&#39;re sorry that he didn&#39;t have the kind <br/>
of childhood he ought to have had.   If you can find a way to express it, <br/>
suggest he turned out well because of his own good character, not because of <br/>
his hardships, but in spite of them.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has written about something she called &quot;re-parenting.&quot;  I <br/>
believe the idea came from meetings of Adult Children of Alcoholics.   It is <br/>
a practice for healing.   In AA the members become parents to a Teddy bear <br/>
and &quot;parent&quot; it the way they wish they had been parented.   Sandra has <br/>
written about the healing that can come from being kinder to our children <br/>
than our parents were with us.  Maybe, if you can find an appropriate time, <br/>
you could talk with your husband about the idea.  If he remembers how he <br/>
felt as a child, he might find some comfort in making sure his children have <br/>
a happier life.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that many men with this kind of work ethic seem to need the <br/>
approval of others.  Offer him more thanks for taking care of his family, <br/>
offer more praise for the work he does.  People who feel they are <br/>
appreciated are usually kinder and more patient with others.   This is part <br/>
of the concept of filling a person up emotionally.<br/>
The more appreciative, kind, generous we are with others, the more of that <br/>
they have to give to others.  Help your husband feel full of love.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a peaceful moment, talk about how you feel toward your children. <br/>
Mom&#39;s have a special connection with their children.  Our children grow <br/>
inside us, they are  nurtured from our bodies and that bond is powerful. <br/>
Remind your husband that it is natural for you to feel strongly about the <br/>
emotional well being of your children and that you wouldn&#39;t be much of a <br/>
mother if you weren&#39;t thinking of these things.   Ask him to be patient with <br/>
you when his ideas and your ideas clash.   This might help him feel less <br/>
like you&#39;re criticizing him and more like you&#39;re mothering your children. <br/>
But be careful not to suggest the children need you to protect them from <br/>
him.  Make it about you, about your nature and not about your husband. <br/>
Maybe a small difference but I think it can help.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is old enough to understand some things about his dad and maybe you <br/>
can talk with him.   Be careful not to talk against his dad.   But maybe <br/>
talk about your husband&#39;s childhood and how it is that people come to <br/>
justify unpleasant things because they are powerless to change them.   Help <br/>
your son understand his dad loves him and that you are trying to work for a <br/>
really happy, peaceful home life - and sometimes that might look like doing <br/>
things to help your husband feel better, doing chores, etc.   Let your son <br/>
know if his dad assigns chores you will help him get them done.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s likely to change in a hurry.  But if it helps <br/>
you, many unschooling moms have husbands who were not fully onboard with <br/>
unschooling and who didn&#39;t really understand these pretty radical parenting <br/>
ideas.  It can work out.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding that we can&#39;t change others does not mean we can&#39;t share <br/>
information and ideas.<br/>
Will your husband read brief articles?   There are bits at Sandra Dodd&#39;s <br/>
website about the benefits of video games.  If your husband sees games as a <br/>
waste of time maybe reading about kids whose interest in video games led to <br/>
jobs in computers or software would give him a different perspective. <br/>
Maybe you could print an article now and then and offer it in the way you&#39;d <br/>
share anything else you found interesting.<br/>
<br/>
There are links to follow here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames/">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/</a><br/>
<br/>
There are some blurbs about chores here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores/">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website has a lot about video games and chores (and money) <br/>
:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can ease some of your husband&#39;s worries about the kids spending <br/>
money by pointing out the best way for kids to learn is by getting the <br/>
opportunity to use money and make spending decisions.  Maybe list members <br/>
can offer their stories about kids and money.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can take the responsibility.  Don&#39;t say, &quot;Romeo bought a game&quot; say, <br/>
&quot;I bought a game for Romeo, a gift&quot; and then if your husband needs to <br/>
express his concern, he can express it to you instead of your child.<br/>
<br/>
***Well, it&#39;s 4:05 am and they are still not here! I am so pissed off with <br/>
him.***<br/>
<br/>
That *is* troubling.   I would probably have gone there and picked up my <br/>
kid.   But that does depend on the kid.  Some kids might have thought it was <br/>
kind of cool to be up in the middle of the night.  But if my kid was <br/>
unhappy, I&#39;d have gone to get him.   Maybe you were without a car or <br/>
couldn&#39;t leave other children.  I understand your distress over this.<br/>
<br/>
***...his dad said the money he could&#39;ve<br/>
used for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead.***<br/>
<br/>
My heart hurt for your son *and* your husband when I read that.  Your <br/>
husband must have heard it often.<br/>
<br/>
We have played a kind of game here about what money could have bought <br/>
instead of what we chose.  The money we spent on our computer (not a great <br/>
example, it&#39;s ten years old, but when it was new) could have bought a <br/>
reliable used car for some needy, car-less family.   It&#39;s interesting to <br/>
consider our choices.  Though your husband made it feel like guilt, you <br/>
might ease your son&#39;s concerns by playing a game about what the money you <br/>
spent on a toaster or blender or coffee pot (or other household things) <br/>
might have bought instead.  Food for animals in the animal shelter.  A <br/>
hearing aid for an old person.  Some really cool toys. Two more video games! <br/>
Consider the possibilities, talk about all the different reasons we make the <br/>
choices we make,  and maybe if it comes up again between them, your son will <br/>
be able to consider it philosophically,  without it hurting his feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574453649">Thanks Deb for taking time to answer my post! You have lots of good  <br/>
points. I admit, I haven&#39;t been doing so well with housekeeping. Its  <br/>
something I absolutely hated as a child! I was relying a lot on my  <br/>
older kids to help me out with household chores and the baby. I have a  <br/>
2 yr old and an almost 8 mo old and it has been hard! I have a good  <br/>
baby carrier and today I was able to get tons of stuff done!  My  <br/>
husband and I didn&#39;t have time with our parents or the love/affection  <br/>
that we wish we had. I think unschooling will help us heal. Fili says  <br/>
he&#39;s ok with it (not forcing the kids to clean up) if i keep my end of  <br/>
the deal. He says he just doesn&#39;t want them to be lazy and he&#39;s afraid  <br/>
they won&#39;t have a job and will be depending on us forever! lol I  <br/>
assured him that that won&#39;t happen.<br/>

&gt; justify unpleasant things because they are powerless to change them.  <br/>
&gt; Help<br/>
&gt; your son understand his dad loves him and that you are trying to  <br/>
&gt; work for a<br/>
&gt; really happy, peaceful home life - and sometimes that might look  <br/>
&gt; like doing<br/>
&gt; things to help your husband feel better, doing chores, etc. Let your  <br/>
&gt; son<br/>
&gt; know if his dad assigns chores you will help him get them done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s likely to change in a hurry. But if it  <br/>
&gt; helps<br/>
&gt; you, many unschooling moms have husbands who were not fully onboard  <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; unschooling and who didn&#39;t really understand these pretty radical  <br/>
&gt; parenting<br/>
&gt; ideas. It can work out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Understanding that we can&#39;t change others does not mean we can&#39;t share<br/>
&gt; information and ideas.<br/>
&gt; Will your husband read brief articles? There are bits at Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
&gt; website about the benefits of video games. If your husband sees  <br/>
&gt; games as a<br/>
&gt; waste of time maybe reading about kids whose interest in video games  <br/>
&gt; led to<br/>
&gt; jobs in computers or software would give him a different perspective.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you could print an article now and then and offer it in the  <br/>
&gt; way you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; share anything else you found interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are links to follow here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames/">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are some blurbs about chores here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores/">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website has a lot about video games and chores  <br/>
&gt; (and money)<br/>
&gt; : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can ease some of your husband&#39;s worries about the kids  <br/>
&gt; spending<br/>
&gt; money by pointing out the best way for kids to learn is by getting the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to use money and make spending decisions. Maybe list  <br/>
&gt; members<br/>
&gt; can offer their stories about kids and money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or you can take the responsibility. Don&#39;t say, &quot;Romeo bought a game&quot;  <br/>
&gt; say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I bought a game for Romeo, a gift&quot; and then if your husband needs to<br/>
&gt; express his concern, he can express it to you instead of your child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***Well, it&#39;s 4:05 am and they are still not here! I am so pissed  <br/>
&gt; off with<br/>
&gt; him.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That *is* troubling. I would probably have gone there and picked up my<br/>
&gt; kid. But that does depend on the kid. Some kids might have thought  <br/>
&gt; it was<br/>
&gt; kind of cool to be up in the middle of the night. But if my kid was<br/>
&gt; unhappy, I&#39;d have gone to get him. Maybe you were without a car or<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t leave other children. I understand your distress over this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***...his dad said the money he could&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; used for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My heart hurt for your son *and* your husband when I read that. Your<br/>
&gt; husband must have heard it often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have played a kind of game here about what money could have bought<br/>
&gt; instead of what we chose. The money we spent on our computer (not a  <br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; example, it&#39;s ten years old, but when it was new) could have bought a<br/>
&gt; reliable used car for some needy, car-less family. It&#39;s interesting to<br/>
&gt; consider our choices. Though your husband made it feel like guilt, you<br/>
&gt; might ease your son&#39;s concerns by playing a game about what the  <br/>
&gt; money you<br/>
&gt; spent on a toaster or blender or coffee pot (or other household  <br/>
&gt; things)<br/>
&gt; might have bought instead. Food for animals in the animal shelter. A<br/>
&gt; hearing aid for an old person. Some really cool toys. Two more video  <br/>
&gt; games!<br/>
&gt; Consider the possibilities, talk about all the different reasons we  <br/>
&gt; make the<br/>
&gt; choices we make, and maybe if it comes up again between them, your  <br/>
&gt; son will<br/>
&gt; be able to consider it philosophically, without it hurting his  <br/>
&gt; feelings.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that is necessarily true. It scared me for a while because my<br/>
dh is raising my daughter that is not biologically his own. She knows this,<br/>
she was 5 when he became part of our life. He treats her with the same love<br/>
and compassion that he treats our children that are biologically his. It can<br/>
seem different at times because she is first. We tend to make the most<br/>
mistakes on our firsts whether they are biologically ours or otherwise. Your<br/>
dh is learning about parenting. There are things that I did to my first that<br/>
I would never to do my second (I controlled her TV viewing for one).<br/>
