<div id="ygrps-yiv-571791970">Thanks to everyone who responded about the TV question -- very helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve let go of my TV=Evil concept -- was really more about trying to be the &quot;best&quot; parent, and buying into fears.  (It seems like our society&#39;s expectations are that you have to be fearful to be a good parent -- what a crock!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check out the TIVO thing -- it&#39;s all new to me.<br/>
<br/>
I am so enjoying all these parenting discussions.  Thanks so much to all of you for contributing.<br/>
<br/>
