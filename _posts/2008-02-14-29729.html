<div id="ygrps-yiv-345509425">I just watched yesterday&#39;s episode of Oprah - it was one of the<br/>
strangest shows I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;m still processing why it was so odd...<br/>
but I wanted to let you know, you can download Suze Orman&#39;s book,<br/>
Women & Money, for free until 8pm Eastern time. Sorry for the late<br/>
notice - I just found out! It downloads as an Adobe file, which you<br/>
can then save on your computer. The whole thing! I&#39;m not a HUGE Suze<br/>
Orman fan, but I think this will be one of those take what you want,<br/>
leave the rest things - and the things I take will be very valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2ss74m">http://tinyurl.com/2ss74m</a>   Just click &quot;Women & Money&quot;<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
