<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356762355">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just responded to the &#39;cursing&#39; thread then realised that I <br/>
haven&#39;t introduced myself on this list yet! <br/>
<br/>
My name is Katherine and I live in the UK with my dh and my three <br/>
children who have never been to school. My dd is 6.5 yrs and my boys <br/>
are 5 and 3 yrs. Here in the UK, my dd&#39;s peers have been at school for <br/>
2 years already and ds1 would have started at the beginning of this <br/>
month although legally he&#39;s not &#39;compulsary school age&#39; until January.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in natural learning and parenting respectfully. However, I <br/>
don&#39;t always find putting these beliefs into practice as easy as I <br/>
would like!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to reading, and taking part in, many more discussions on <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Katherine.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761504743">There may be some cross posting, so please excuse it. I have been on and off <br/>
unschooling lists for years. Some of these are new to me, some are not. I <br/>
usually join them when I�m in a panic and enjoy them for several months, <br/>
then just get too busy and tired of 3000 new messages a day to wade through <br/>
in my e-mail. I�ve lurked for several weeks. I panic every fall as everyone <br/>
else goes back to school. I have 5 wonderful boys ages 16, 14, 11, 7, 4. I <br/>
found out about homeschooling when my oldest was about 2. The more I read, <br/>
the more I liked the idea. When he was about 4 I found out about John Holt. <br/>
The more I read his books, the more I was convinced that he could be talking <br/>
about my own son and his learning. We are a Navy family and are constantly <br/>
moving. We were living in Sicily, when my son should have started <br/>
Kindergarten. There was one really good teacher and one really bad teacher. <br/>
Of course, everyone wanted the really good one, so there was no switching, <br/>
and I thought, �Not a chance! We are so not going to play this game.� I kept <br/>
him home that year, which was hard on both of us. Kindergarten has been the <br/>
hardest year for all my boys because they know that when you are big enough <br/>
you start school. They all wanted to go, and I kept them home. We moved back <br/>
to the States the next year but were already started down the homeschooling <br/>
path, so stayed on it. I have to admit that the first year or two were more <br/>
homeschool than unschool, until I was able to relax a little more. I have <br/>
been fighting the battle with neighbors and grandparents for quite a few <br/>
years now and it gets a little wearisome. My husband has been very <br/>
supportive. Both his parents are college professors and their family just <br/>
doesn�t get it. DH has trusted, however, that I know what is best. He has <br/>
seen how much time and energy I have put into studying this unschooling <br/>
thing. He has his doubts at times, but then don�t we all.  Now getting <br/>
around to my question�My son says he wants to go to college. Is it the <br/>
Moores or John Holt that says all 13 of their school years can be caught up <br/>
in 2 or 3 when they are ready? My son is very smart and very social. His <br/>
brain works much differently than mine, so that has caused some battles in <br/>
math for instance. He didn�t really start reading until about age 14. BOY! <br/>
You should have heard the grandparents on that one! But now, I�m confident <br/>
he is nearly caught up to �grade level�. He�s reading Robert Jordan books, <br/>
which is something I can�t even do. His brain understands a lot of math <br/>
intuitively but doesn�t get the way I teach it. What I am basically asking <br/>
you for, I guess, is for ideas on programs or ways to catch him up so that <br/>
he is ready for ACT tests and college. We have tried numerous math programs, <br/>
but he is still on basic math. I want to try teaching textbooks pre-algebra <br/>
next. He probably needs it to be self-directed resources because he does NOT <br/>
want me to be involved, or tell him anything, or try to teach him anything. <br/>
He can read novels, but I�m not sure he is ready to wade through texts yet. <br/>
My husband is getting nervous and requested that I buy a science, history <br/>
and math book that he can work in. I�m looking to all you experts to fill me <br/>
in on the best resources to get a kid ready for college, when he is <br/>
�behind�, not huge into reading hour after hour, and not very motivated. At <br/>
least, he hasn�t liked any of the suggestions I could give about how and <br/>
what to study. Thanks in advance. I�m sorry that it was so long.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17624215">I picked out the following statements from your post:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now getting  around to my questionMy son says he wants to go to<br/>
&gt; college.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My son is very smart and very social.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; He probably needs it to be self-directed resources because he<br/>
&gt; does NOT want me to be involved, or tell him anything, or try to<br/>
&gt; teach him anything. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m looking to all you experts to fill me in on the best resources<br/>
&gt; to get a kid ready for college, when he is &quot;behind&quot;, not huge into<br/>
&gt; reading hour after hour, and not very motivated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure he wants to go to college?  Or is he saying that because <br/>
he knows you and his dad are nervous?  You&#39;re saying he&#39;s smart but <br/>
that he&#39;s behind and not very motivated.  I&#39;m not sure that all plays <br/>
together.  Maybe he&#39;s not very motivated because it&#39;s not really <br/>
something he wants to do.  If it really were something he wanted to <br/>
do, he&#39;d be more a part of the decision making process.  In fact, if <br/>
he&#39;s really interested in college, I&#39;d suggest that he start looking <br/>
at what they may need for him to be enrolled.  He could speak with an <br/>
admissions counselor, explain his educational background and ask what <br/>
he can do to be admitted.<br/>
<br/>
And I think he also should be told that college isn&#39;t the only option <br/>
for him.  Maybe there is something else he&#39;d rather do right now that <br/>
would motivate him and bring a sparkle to his eye.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a dd16 preparing for college but she has been the one doing <br/>
the research and the work.  I&#39;m here for anything she needs but she <br/>
didn&#39;t want me to do it for her.  I&#39;ve been on these lists for a long <br/>
time and I&#39;ve never seen any of these unschooling families feel a <br/>
need to catch a child up.  It implies that unschooling is really <br/>
doing nothing and then trying to pack in all the traditional years of <br/>
schooling in a cram session.  <br/>
