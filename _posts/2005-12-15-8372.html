Your post answered my question about healing and unschooling ourselves and I<br/>
hadn&#39;t even asked the question on the group yet.  Thanks.  :)<br/>

 <br/>
I did not know about the tradition of some Native American tribes<br/>
considering the next seven generations when making the decision, but it is<br/>
sentiments like that that make mothering a spiritual path for me.  I am<br/>
becoming less and less surprised that I am ending up where I am as a mother.<br/>
 It started with breastfeeding and has evolved into unschooling.  These last<br/>
few weeks, I have truly come into the realization that unschooling is just<br/>
the next step in a process that began with a goal that I had before I had my<br/>
children.  I decided that my goal as a parent would be to raise children who<br/>
felt good about themselves, who had high self-esteem.  This has to do with<br/>
the fact that I have struggled with having high self-esteem.  Little did I<br/>
know where this would lead me because at every turn, I have to work on who I<br/>
am in order to parent in a way that allows my children the freedom to be who<br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
It is a beautiful thing to be able to leave our children material wealth,<br/>
but nothing compares to the love.  I once remember an alcohol and drug<br/>
counselor saying that he had NEVER treated a patient for alcohol and drug<br/>
addiction who said that they were addicts because their parents did not buy<br/>
them enough stuff.  It is the lack of love that had them there.  It is<br/>
comments like those that keep me determined to continue to open myself more<br/>
to my children, husband and people in general.  <br/>
<br/>
They may not remember our name, but they will have our love.......There is<br/>
no greater legacy.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
