<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966284670">What interesting activites, projects or experiments have your kids done <br/>
this past year? We&#39;ve gotten some really cool ideas from other <br/>
unschoolers so tell us what you&#39;ve done in 2006! <br/>
<br/>
This is the next topic for Unschooling Voices and all replies will be <br/>
added (unless you don&#39;t want yours to be included) to the next edition, <br/>
which will be out on December 1. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
