<div id="ygrps-yiv-102544333">Thought I&#39;d change the subject:)  Are there really other Air Force <br/>
families who unschool?  I sure wish I could find just one!  We&#39;re in <br/>
Turkey right now, and we are so happy to be leaving in a couple of <br/>
months.  We haven&#39;t made any real friends at all since we&#39;ve been <br/>
here.  We&#39;ll be moving to Spokane, WA in the spring and are hoping <br/>
to find someone since it&#39;s a good sized city.<br/>

OT - dh is coming home on Monday after 4 long months deployed to <br/>

A few. Scattered here & there.<br/>

I know you&#39;ve heard it before, but I&#39;ll say it again: enjoy it while you&#39;re  <br/>
there &#39;cause you&#39;ll miss it when you&#39;re gone! Take advantage of the time you  <br/>
have there----what an experience!  And the bargains! Rugs, copper, brass!  The <br/>
Mediterranean! Don&#39;t let the opportunities to see things and go places get  <br/>
lost in the desire to come home!<br/>

You might make one next week! &lt;g&gt; We often *really* liked the family  we were <br/>
replacing! &lt;g&gt; But we only  got to know them for a few  weeks/months!<br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t know of anyone there, off-hand, but the Northwest seems more  <br/>
unschooling-friendly than the South! &lt;G&gt; <br/>

****************************<br/>
 <br/>
As one of the few and proud Marine Corps unschooler&#39;s,  YAY!!!  Enjoy your <br/>
reunion.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with your move, too.  I hope you meet lots of great people  in WA <br/>
(well, and in Turkey, too, like Kelly says...who also gets on to me about  my <br/>
lack of ability to meet friends!).<br/>

NOT lack of *ability*---Leslie&#39;s adorable! Lack of *initiative*!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lost in the desire to come home!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kelly, I know you are right, but I also lack initiative:)  Dh has <br/>
been gone a long time, and I don&#39;t feel comfortable driving around <br/>
Turkey by myself.  We have gone on a few trips here though - <br/>
Cappadocia was amazing! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping!  I have spent enough time in the south and <br/>
want to try somewhere new.  We&#39;ve never lived out west before and <br/>
are really looking forward to it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! He works in Intelligence - mostly analysis and passing on of <br/>
info to air crews, also some targeting.<br/>
<br/>
And Leslie, thank you also for your good wishes.  It will be an <br/>
adjustment for all of us, but a good one I think.  I&#39;m just <br/>
wondering what the cat will do:)  We had her for only a month before <br/>
dh left, so she&#39;ll probably be hiding for a while.<br/>
