<div id="ygrps-yiv-184725904">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list and thought I should introduce myself.  My name is Debbie, and I have been homeschooling my 13 yo dd for four years now.  My younger dd just began homeschooling this year (grade K).  Like many other people new to homeschooling, we went with a packaged curriculum the first year.  Trouble is, we&#39;ve been stuck in that rut ever since.  It seemed easier at first, having a program laid out for me, telling me what my kids need to do each week, etc., but now I realize that it is making life much more difficult than it needs to be.  We have finally reached a point where we are both (my older dd and I, that is) sick to death of this program and ready to learn more about unschooling.  Since she will begin high school level next school year, I&#39;m concerned about transcripts and a diploma, for college purposes.  How do you get around this?  Cafi Cohen&#39;s book &quot;Homeschooling:The Teen Years&quot; was recommended to me quite some time ago, and I still haven&#39;t checked it out yet - would any of you recommend it? or could you recommend a better book?<br/>
My younger daughter is using Oak Meadow&#39;s kindergarten curriculum, and it suits her well as there really isn&#39;t much to it so we supplement it by learning more about whatever she is interested in at the moment.  Today it was the moon.  Last week, she had a strong interest in learning about creatures that live in the ocean.  In fact, this way of &quot;schooling&quot; is what got me thinking that maybe unschooling would be a good fit for my kids after all.   LOL.<br/>
My older dd is also using OM materials (8th grade level).  The math is very, very good, but the rest of it is just so-so, and our biggest mistake was going with teacher support this year.  The OM teacher has been SOOOO strict, and even had the nerve to suggest that my dd&#39;s extracurricular activities are &quot;cutting into her OM studies too much&quot;!!!  I was outraged - to me, the extracurricular things are not &quot;fluff&quot; but real honest-to-goodness learning opportunies.  AND, the only things she goes to during the day is a Spanish class once a week (for one hour), and swimming with her friends at the Y once a week (not lessons, just swimming together for fun).   I complained to the OM teacher. Her reply was that she does this with all of her 8th graders to prepare them for the much more difficult/challenging high school years ahead.  Hmmmmm.....somehow, discouraging them doesn&#39;t seem like such a good idea to me.  A little praise would go a looooonnngggggg way, imo.<br/>
Anyhow, as you can probably tell, we are ready for a change.<br/>
If you have gotten this far, thank you for listening.<br/>
Debbie<br/>
P.S. Ren, I enjoyed your post very much!  thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663414939">your husband is right - here is a little article talking more about<br/>
college in general.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north303.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north303.html</a><br/>
<br/>
the most relevent excerpt I see offhand is this:<br/>
<br/>
Instead of going to college full time at 18, a wise student will seek<br/>
employment by a company on a part-time basis and take his college work<br/>
by examination. His college degree will cost him $12,000 instead of<br/>
costing his parents $35,000 to $140,000. He can pay his own way<br/>
through school. He can gain his independence at 18.<br/>
<br/>
He will be trained on the job by people who know how to make a buck.<br/>
He will have a four-year to six-year head start on his peers. At age<br/>
22 or 23, he will have a college degree and work experience that will<br/>
impress a would-be employer. He will be in a position to rise in the<br/>
existing chain of command because his employer knows he is now a<br/>
marketable commodity in the business world. The employer will have to<br/>
pay him more money.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true.  I went to college because work was boring.  I had little interest in being there and goofed around for 2 years before finding my passion.<br/>
<br/>
My unschooled daughter has been living her passion for years.  She has researched colleges, checked out entrance requirements and made a plan.  All on her own.  She chose to follow a very traditional curriculum because it is an entrance requirement.<br/>
<br/>
But what a difference in working with a kid who truly wants to learn these things, has a goal in mind, chose for herself, than working with a kid who isn&#39;t interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507295078">Also, the typical example I hear of homeschoolers going to college is<br/>
by taking community college classes at 16 or 17, getting 30 hours<br/>
there and then transferring to a university (which requests high<br/>

If you want to, keep a scrapbook.  One of the easiest ways for unschoolers to attend college is to start at a local community college and then transfer in to whatever university they want to attend.<br/>

If your kids express a desire to go to college, worry about it then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851813795">Thank you, Daniel.  I will definitely have her check into attending community college classes in a few years (she&#39;s 13).<br/>
Right now, she thinks she might want to attend college to further her art skills.  I doubt getting accepted to an art college is as difficult as getting accepted at other types of colleges, so she most likely wouldn&#39;t run into too much trouble anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny - one of my brothers who attended a four-year college, and in later years attended a couple of different community colleges, is the one who gives me the most grief over homeschooling.  The subject of college is his main attack method (&quot;are they going to college?&quot;  &quot;don&#39;t you think homeschooling is going to hurt their chances?&quot; etc.).  He was a typical bookworm in high school, and one of his best friends was a teacher who strongly believed that everyone should go on to college.  He&#39;s in his mid-40s now and has never held a job in the field he studied.  He has held a string of low-paying jobs that he doesn&#39;t like, sometimes with months and months of unemployment between jobs (while living at my mother&#39;s house).  Why he doesn&#39;t see that college didn&#39;t exactly pay off for him, I don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;m too polite to say this to him, and try to remain calm when he attacks our choice to homeschool.  When we saw him just a few weeks ago, he asked if my 5 YEAR OLD is going to go to college!  I was surprised by the stupidity of the question, and it was difficult to stop myself from saying &quot;ARE YOU CRAZY? HOW COULD I POSSIBLY KNOW IF A FIVE YEAR OLD IS GOING TO COLLEGE?!&quot;   Instead, I politely said &quot;we&#39;ll have to wait several years to see if she is interested in going.&quot;  I think he got the point, as he dropped the subject after that.<br/>

I talk about how we cannot even begin to fathom the technological advances  <br/>
made in the next 13 years and the affect they will have on our society.  I  say <br/>
I am doing my best to help my child remain open to what *will* happen as  <br/>
opposed to what happened in my generation.  That might include  college.  Who <br/>
knows?  College may only be an option for those going  into professions such as <br/>
law by that time.<br/>

Unschoolers put real learning first - the learning is for its own sake, <br/>
not for the purpose of creating transcripts, earning a diploma, or <br/>
getting into college.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - amazingly (no longer amazing to me &lt;G&gt;) unschooled kids often DO <br/>
go to college and do extremely well.<br/>
<br/>
I attribute my daughters&#39; success in college to unschooling.<br/>

that they&#39;ve kept during all those years of homeschooling - I  know <br/>
that the colleges and universities do NOT care what your child was <br/>
doing instead of  elementary or middle school. What your child did in <br/>
place of going to high school COULD be of interest to them if the kid <br/>
is applying as a freshman - so if you want to take notes along the way <br/>
to help your memory when it comes time to apply, that might make some <br/>
sense. My kids haven&#39;t needed any documentation at all of any kind - <br/>
because they went to community college - once they do that, the <br/>
university relies on what they did there and doesn&#39;t care about what <br/>
they did instead of high school.<br/>

teach in the evenings, so the majority of studens in my classes are <br/>
adults who have been in the work force for a while and are going back to <br/>
school for whatever reason.  These people are much more highly motivated <br/>
than the ones who are there because they are taking college courses <br/>
because they think they &quot;have to&quot;.   They participate in class and do <br/>
thoughtful work.  One could argue that it is because they are older and <br/>
therefore more mature, but I think it is because they have finally had a <br/>
few years of being in charge of their own lives and they now have a <br/>
sense of self-motivation (of course, I know several adults who have not <br/>
yet achieved this, but they usually don&#39;t show up in my classes).  Many <br/>
of the 18 year olds who are coming out of high school barely know how to <br/>
write, usually don&#39;t come to class, and do the bare minimum of work <br/>
required to get a C.  They clearly don&#39;t want to be there, and it&#39;s <br/>
really a drag for me to have them in class.  I&#39;ll tell you--I&#39;d rather <br/>
have an unschooler who is there by choice any day!<br/>

It is the art portfolio that makes the difference, though.<br/>

Taking art courses at a community college is a really good way to build <br/>

trouble @ birth breathing,struggled through 5 yrs of public school which <br/>
labeled him early as learning disabled,which did well in private school,untill the <br/>
focus went from totally a mission for the kids to their own agendas(too long to <br/>
go into!!),,then he floundered and they also,without  the label but by <br/>
putting him into school work way below his intelligence labeled him learning <br/>
disabled also,,my question is,if someone is suppose to be learning disabled,how is <br/>
teaching them below their obvious intellengence suppose to enable them?????????<br/>
he is 15,an awesome young man,smarter in his own right  than many grown <br/>
men,why,because if its something that interest him ,,he absorbs it ...stuff he <br/>
couldnt care less about ,,,he doesnt .....hummmmm gee,,,,funny thing,,,it takes <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859076938">I have to jump in here for a bit. It *is* wonderful<br/>
teaching homeschoolers and unschoolers. I&#39;ve had one<br/>
school-at-home hser and a couple of relaxed hsers in<br/>
my classes, and I&#39;ve had a couple of unschoolers, and<br/>
the sheer passion that the unschoolers expressed in<br/>
their writing (I taught English & Women&#39;s Studies) was<br/>
just *amazing* and completely refreshing! And their<br/>
critical thinking was just awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I wasn&#39;t the only instructor/professor who<br/>
expected the students to take charge of and own their<br/>
own education (by finding their own subjects and<br/>
angles on which to write, etc). The unschoolers and<br/>
relaxed hsers had no significant problems in my<br/>
classes. The traditional public-schooled and even the<br/>
school-at-home hsers had more problems, particularly<br/>
the public-schooled kids. Whereas the unschoolers had<br/>
some minor problems on grammar (which they ended up<br/>
mastering by the end of the semester probably because<br/>
they had a reason to understand the often goofy<br/>
grammar rules), the public-schooled kids and<br/>
school-at-home hsers (to a much lesser degree, though)<br/>
had much more trouble in critical thinking, analyzing,<br/>
and interpreting--abstract skills and much more<br/>
important than mickey-mouse grammar rules. (Besides,<br/>
that&#39;s why grammar handbooks have been invented--to<br/>
help us all look up that pesky definition of<br/>
intransitive verb!)<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I was *never* asked by an unschooler (and I&#39;ve<br/>
taught quite a few at UTSA and Purdue), &quot;Is this going<br/>
to be on the test?&quot; AAARGGH!<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t see a problem with unschooling and going to<br/>
college.<br/>
