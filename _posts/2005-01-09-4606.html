<div id="ygrps-yiv-585834165">Thank you so much Kelly.  There are so  many similarities to my  family.  My <br/>
son left school at the end of the sixth grade, actually we  didn&#39;t wait for <br/>
the year to end.  I remember telling his teacher that I was  going to homeschool <br/>
him and thinking that was a threat..lol.  I never  thought I would actually <br/>
do it.  I can just imagine what she would think  about unschooling.  She was a <br/>
very controlling woman..&quot;he has to conform,  we all have to so he might as <br/>
well get used to it now&quot;...  that kind of  thing.  I&#39;m actually glad she chose <br/>
those words because that&#39;s what pushed  us out of the school system.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway I also have a son eight years younger.  I am so glad he won&#39;t  ever <br/>
have to start at school.  I&#39;m especially glad that he won&#39;t have to  DEschool.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He  needs to  <br/>
know <br/>
you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to  be left to heal. I  <br/>
don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly  fine line between <br/>
leaving  <br/>
him alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t  know how to explain it. But you&#39;ll <br/>
know  it AFTER you&#39;re through it!  &lt;G&gt; Go figure!&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much for admitting how hard it was.  I know it&#39;s OK for  him to <br/>
spend his time pursuing his interests but when I see how fast the  time seems <br/>
to fly by I start getting anxious.  I know it&#39;s OK for him to  play video <br/>
games, or whatever as much as he wants, but I have to keep  reminding myself that <br/>
I know it&#39;s OK, if you know what I mean. &lt;G&gt;   And sometimes when I read the <br/>
boards you guys who&#39;ve been at it for a while  sound so sure of yourselves and <br/>
I wonder if I lack something-- trust? in my  kids? in myself?  <br/>
 <br/>
But I am definitely commited to unschooling.  And knowing that it was  hard <br/>
for others and that they made it definitely helps me to keep going.   And I <br/>
know what you mean about that fine line.  I think I have been good  about erring <br/>
on the side of caution, trying to offer variety and fun stuff  to do without <br/>
turning into &quot;teacher-mom&quot;. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It gets better! It gets GREAT!&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It is great.  And you guys online have opened up a new world for my  family.  <br/>
Thanks.  And I apologize if I am rambling, I&#39;m just coming  off a 12 hour <br/>
night shift and my husband is on his 12 hour day shift, so it&#39;s me  and the kids <br/>
and very little sleep.  But thanks again.<br/>

Thank  you so much Kelly.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;m just reciprocating! I had LOTS of help from others too!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
YUCK! But that&#39;s a *very* common sentiment in out society! We just don&#39;t  <br/>
hear so much of it *here*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway I also have a son eight years younger.   I am so glad he won&#39;t  <br/>

DEschool.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah---me too. Duncan seems so &quot;at peace&quot;---it&#39;s a whole different  <br/>
feeling/attitude! Nothing to be undone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you so much for admitting how hard it  was.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s REALLY hard. And it can be harder if you&#39;ve invested your time and  mind <br/>
in &#39;education&#39; as the be-all-end-all!<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron was obviously struggling---and talking with his friends didn&#39;t  help <br/>
at all. *They* thought they were being helpful---by saying that he NEEDED  sc<br/>
hool. But that just made it harder for him and me. He just couldn&#39;t see  how I <br/>
could possibly be right!<br/>
 <br/>
I believe that sleep is the absolute BEST thing he can do during  <br/>
DEschooling. We heal during sleep. Physically and mentally. It&#39;s SO important.  It&#39;s also <br/>
important to &#39;veg out&#39;----so that even when we&#39;re NOT sleeping, we&#39;re  <br/>
deconstructing that school life.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know it&#39;s OK for  him to <br/>

 <br/>
Yeah----just keep repeating, &quot;It&#39;s OK!&quot; &lt;g&gt; Over and over!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;ll be whole again soon.<br/>
 <br/>
And Mary (Zenmomma) Gold had a note she taped on the wall or mirror:  &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
NOT unschooling, it&#39;s the.....&quot; To remind herself that, when things seemed  <br/>
dark, it wasn&#39;t the unschooling. Unschooling was the GOOD thing. It was  <br/>
something else causing the problem: lack of sleep, hunger, traffic, ..whatever.  But <br/>
it&#39;s NOT the unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And sometimes when I read the <br/>

 <br/>
We&#39;re sure because we have living PROOF in our homes. We also had that lack  <br/>
of trust (and often NO willpower! &lt;g&gt;). It is a lack of trust in your kids  <br/>
and in yourself. But as you get better and better, that trust grows and grows.  <br/>
When Ren and I are long gone from this e-list---YOU may be the one to take up  <br/>
the torch! &lt;G&gt; *You * will be the one lending a hand! You&#39;ll be surprised:  I <br/>
never thought *I* would be the one telling people how to do this!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is great.  And you guys online have opened up a new  world for my  family. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.  &lt;snip&gt;    But thanks again.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re welcome again. I felt the same way just a few years ago! Welcome to  <br/>
the new world! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I think for kids who leave school at that adolescent, 11-13ish age, physical <br/>
activity is really important too. My son spent hours riding his bike or just <br/>
walking the hills behind our house (in Santee CA 1989) the first year after I <br/>
pulled him from school. It helped work out the residual stress - plus it&#39;s just <br/>
really helpful to help moderate moods when hormonal effects start bouncing <br/>
kids around. <br/>
<br/>
A job is good too. Adolescents need to be needed. Adolescents who&#39;ve just <br/>
changed their whole way of life REALLY need to be needed and valued by folks <br/>
outside of their family. If you can help your son find and appropriate volunteer <br/>
position in some area where he has skills/knowledge/interest it will really <br/>
help to smooth his transition. It&#39;s something I really wish we&#39;d managed for my <br/>
oldest.<br/>
