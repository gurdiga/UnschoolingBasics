 I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m writing this...perhaps for reassurance &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 We go to the library often. And what I have noticed over the last 3-4 months <br/>
is that my son (8) no longer picks out the great literature that he used to.. <br/>
but he just gravitates towards the Yugioh, Pokemon and Star Wars books. <br/>
<br/>
 I mean, some ARE cool...all about strategy and etc...but I&#39; can&#39;t help <br/>
feeling sad that he has no interest, whatsoever  in all the other wonderful stuff <br/>
out there.<br/>

cause him to enjoy them.  Expressing your disappointment in his <br/>
interests, however, isn&#39;t a good way to support him or unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Find books and web sites and magazines for him in the things he is <br/>
interested in!  Rent or buy the movies if you don&#39;t already have them.  <br/>
Watch for merchandise at yard sales.  THESE are his interests today ... <br/>
maybe not in 6 months or 6 years.  But he&#39;s getting pleasure from them <br/>
now.  He&#39;s happy *today*.  Isn&#39;t that something worth supporting and <br/>
joining in on?  :D<br/>

How much great literature is there for 8yo&#39;s?  And how many of those books speak to his life today?  From what I&#39;ve seen of traditional books for the 7 - 10 crowd (my son is 8) they&#39;re often about kids in school, things like that.

<br/>
Years ago when my oldest was a poorly reading 8yo (school&#39;s position) my position was that all reading counts, just like everything counts in unschooling.  Whatever a person reads adds to our store of words, understanding of the language and just basic knowledge.  My kids have spent more time reading the funnies, cereal boxes, TV captions, video game instructions, and street signs than books.  Reading is reading, it all should count.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can really relate to this and have been thinking alot about it lately.  My <br/>
son (11) also went through a time when he was reading books lots of books that <br/>
seemed well written.  He also would get non-fiction books with topics he was <br/>
interested in like electricity and computers.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately, however, he reads nothing but joke or comic books!  I found myself <br/>
trying to urge him to get something else at the library but then I remembered my <br/>
daughter at 11.  After reading many classics, she started doing the same <br/>
thing at about 11.  She read those teenage paperback books endlessly!  She will be <br/>
15 in a couple of weeks and right not she is reading Philosophy Problems 101, <br/>
Michael Moore&#39;s New Book, and book about Sigmund Freud as well as numerous <br/>
fiction books from authors she loves.<br/>
<br/>
I realize I do the same thing.  I read Cold Mountain this week but I also <br/>
read things like Sue Grafton&#39;s New Mystery or some weeks I barely read the <br/>
newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t want to check anything out of the library last time we <br/>
went...he just was not interested.  He reads for hours online though and plays Neopets <br/>
and computer games.  I truly believe that he will read what I consider &quot;good <br/>
literature&quot; again someday but i&#39;s not going to bother me if he doesn&#39;t.   <br/>
Well, maybe just a little...  But I&#39;m working on that..:-)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Those books and interests can lead to other interests and readings.  For example, Yu-Gi-O has lots of connections with Egypt and other ancient cultures.  So that could lead in so many other directions.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My 11 yr old son also has read lots of Star Wars, Yu-Gi-O, Bionicle, and lots of anime books.  Its been amazing the other paths his mind has gone to,(from those books).  I just keep talking with him about what he&#39;s reading and the conversations keep going and going.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
***I&#39; can&#39;t help <br/>
feeling sad that he has no interest, whatsoever  in all the other wonderful stuff <br/>
out there.***<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But see, right now he is finding wonderful stuff, his wonderful stuff.  Some day he might choose to read other things that you might think are more worthy.  Or he might not too,  maybe he isn&#39;t interested in everything that you are interested in.  That&#39;s a hard realization.  It was hard and is still hard for me sometimes.  My son doesn&#39;t care to go to museums with me, he doesn&#39;t care to go biking or hiking much with me,  BUT,  he does like sitting with me and discussing politics, strategies in his video games and lots of other stuff.  So, things are good.  :)<br/>
I would just keep helping him find what he wants to read,  that in itself will deepen your relationship and the trust between you.   You will be amazed at what he can/will learn from his own choices in reading.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Kelli~<br/>
<br/>
PS.  Oh, and have you ever read some of the books he&#39;s chosen?  I&#39;m not saying you need to read everything your kids are reading, its just that its nice sometimes to know what they are talking about when they want to tell you something--some common ground, ya know.   I actually got into a few DragonballZ books,  and I was an English major. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220174215">HI there,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done any library trips with Hannah yet, and you all are inspiring<br/>
me to do it. I just prefer to buy I LOVE owning books, and hate returning<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But as I was reading this I thought hey this is like me. I will read half a<br/>
dozen books on parenting or self help or biographies or history, you know<br/>
things that I have to &quot;think&quot; a bit through especially if I am learning<br/>
things from them and then I will just shut down and loose myself in a half<br/>
dozen or more Nora Roberts style books. Fluff, fun mindless abandon. So<br/>
maybe this is the same thing. Seems like my subconscious needs time to<br/>
digest what I have taken in from the other books and I need a rest from<br/>
&quot;learning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just thought as I was reading this, that if anyone else was like me and<br/>
spent time reading fluffy stuff, then perhaps it isn&#39;t so bad for our kids<br/>
to be doing it either. Probably won&#39;t last forever, just like the TV thing.<br/>
right?<br/>
