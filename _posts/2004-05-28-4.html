<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089446338">Hi.  Thanks for the invitation to the group.  Although my kids have <br/>
never been to school, and I&#39;ve been mostly lurking at <br/>
unschooling.com for about 4 years now, I feel like I still have much <br/>
more to learn from others than I have to offer.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Christy, and I have 2 daughters, 9yo & 4yo.  We live in Turkey <br/>
right now on an Air Force base.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a new group!<br/>
<br/>
