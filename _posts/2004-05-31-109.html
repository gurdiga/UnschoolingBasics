<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792596430">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am mother to 3 & 5yo girls, with a baby due at the end of June. Dh <br/>
have come to see we have been home/unschooling since birth, but have <br/>
been a little anxious as the &#39;big step&#39; of not sending older dd to<br/>
kindergarten in the fall approaches. I have been researching<br/>
homeschooling for several years, and have gone back and forth about<br/>
using curriculum, but keep coming back to unschooling, or very<br/>
relaxed &#39;methods&#39;. I asked my dh recently how he feels we should <br/>
proceed in the fall with homeschooling, and although he does not <br/>
read, and research lie I do, he surprised me by saying, &#39;why do <br/>
anything different than what we are doing now?&#39; At this point we both <br/>
see the girls learning all the time, and older dd resists teaching of <br/>
any sort, so we feel we are on the right path, doing what we are <br/>
doing! It was so great to hear this comment from him, as he was not <br/>
open to school at home, let alone the idea of unschooling when I <br/>
first brought up the possiblity. <br/>
<br/>
I recognize many of you from other unschooling lists I have been <br/>
visiting, as well as a postive discipline list I am on. The insight <br/>
and support I have been getting has been so helpful, and I am excited <br/>
about this list for the opportunity to ask more questions, since it <br/>
is aimed specifically for those beginning the journey. We have been <br/>
making many changes in our parenting and lifestyle, out of recent re-<br/>
examination, and the changes are resembling the unschooling mindset <br/>
more and more, and proving to be positive, although at the same time <br/>
dh and I are still struggling for understanding as we deschool our <br/>
thinking.  We have very little support from family (mostly <br/>
negativity, actually), and know few homeschoolers at this point. <br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions/issues that I&#39;d like to present right away, <br/>
but think I will break them up into separate posts to avoid getting <br/>
too lengthy with my intro.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this opportunity, Ren, Rue & others!<br/>
<br/>
Melissa Z.</div>

<br/>
Where are you and your family?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but I&#39;ve been at work for the past 3 days and I&#39;m now back on line and trying to catch up...long way to go still :^).<br/>
