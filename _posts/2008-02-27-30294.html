<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158046514">Hiya, Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Lisa was buried today very near her home in Lake Peekskill, New <br/>
York.  The part of New York where she was &quot;laid to rest&quot; is just to <br/>
the east of the beautiful Hudson River and is notable for its <br/>
verdant, rolling hills.  The site where she was buried is, if my <br/>
navigational skills are intact, in a western-facing slope of one of <br/>
these hills.  If standing on a rather steep slope under a steely <br/>
February sky with a biting, chilly wind weren&#39;t, um, challenging <br/>
enough, the slushy snow and ice underfoot definitely added an <br/>
intensity to the moment.  Every now and again, someone would succumb <br/>
and suddenly slip, even though they were standing still.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, somehow we were warm, all of us there together.  (We reminded <br/>
me, just a little, of the penguins who huddle in Antarctica.  Perhaps <br/>
I&#39;m exaggerating just a tad!)<br/>
<br/>
The rabbi who conducted the service (I didn&#39;t catch his name) was <br/>
eloquent and impassioned.  As Liam said as we drove home later, &quot;How <br/>
could he not be?  He had excellent material to work with.&quot;  So <br/>
true.  You really got the sense, you *knew* that this man knew Who <br/>
Lisa was.  He was thorough and kind.<br/>
<br/>
When the opportunity for the mourners to speak came, I stepped up <br/>
with my 20-page-long list of messages, some lengthy, some brief, that <br/>
had been sent from very near and very far.  Before I left the house <br/>
for the funeral, I timed the reading of the whole thing and found it <br/>
to be more than 30 minutes long!  And that was with some editing.  I <br/>
felt that I couldn&#39;t do that to this slipping-and-sliding, shivering <br/>
bunch.  So, although I was prepared to read all the submissions, I <br/>
read only one rather brief piece and told folks that they could look <br/>
at the tribute blog I am creating to see the rest in all their <br/>
unabridged beauty.  The URL for that site, by the way, is <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lheyman.blogspot.com">http://lheyman.blogspot.com</a>&gt;, and it is about halfway done.  There <br/>
are still many tributes and photos for me to post.<br/>
<br/>
But, I am positively fried right now, so I&#39;m going to tackle the <br/>
completion of this another day.  Perhaps tomorrow?<br/>
<br/>
For a while, there, last year, Lisa and I and a couple of other local <br/>
unschoolers (Mary Ann and Robin) were trying to get an unschooling <br/>
information night going for folks who expressed an interest in <br/>
learning about unschooling.  I believe it was Lisa&#39;s idea, and she <br/>
invited me to participate ~ how incredibly honored I felt!  For some <br/>
reason tonight, I looked back through our email exchanges; we were <br/>
working on refining the notices for the event and the event <br/>
itself.  Looking through these emails, I felt a sharp pain in my <br/>
heart that I will not be having these exchanges any longer with this <br/>
impossibly wonderful, bright, sweet person.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked about her puzzling, frustrating illness in many of <br/>
these emails; the illness, by the way, precluded our ever getting <br/>
this thing off the ground.  It was the consensus of the three of us, <br/>
Mary Ann, Robin, and me, that Lisa and Roxanne and Ruby were <br/>
indispensable; I felt they could have gotten along without *me* just <br/>
fine, but I couldn&#39;t imagine the thing without Lisa.  ::sigh::<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really rambling when I ought to be sleeping.  Thanks, folks, for <br/>
listening.  Do check out the blog, and if you&#39;re moved to post <br/>
something on there and you haven&#39;t already sent me something, please <br/>
do send me something now.  It&#39;ll never be too late.<br/>
<br/>
Sending you all love,<br/>
<br/>
Marji</div>
