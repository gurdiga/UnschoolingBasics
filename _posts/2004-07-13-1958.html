<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909146050">You asked how we helped Jalen meet his needs for throwing....I don&#39;t <br/>
know that I really have very well, since he still seems to throw <br/>
food every day. Argh.<br/>
<br/>
I like those wiffle style balls. Lightweight plastics with holes <br/>
throughout. He can throw them as hard as he wants and not break <br/>
anything. We bought a little dollar store set, with a plastic bat <br/>
and ball, he could spend hours hitting the ball when we pitch it. <br/>
<br/>
A bucket with bean bags is good. You can use an old laundry bucket <br/>
and make your own bean bags (I used felt, lentils and hot glue) for <br/>
a really inexpensive option.<br/>
Wadded up paper would be fun too. Ooh, ooh...I&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>
buy a magnetic dart board set. I bet that would be fun, and no <br/>
danger of anyone getting punctured.:)<br/>

is also in the throw stage, food is a favorite projectile, especially when the <br/>
rotund Schipperke is under her chair!!! <br/>
We also have a small basketball hoop on a bedroom door, down low where it can <br/>
be reached. That is fun!! <br/>
