<div id="ygrps-yiv-941018842">I&#39;m sitting here taking a break from the birthing process...of our<br/>
cat&#39;s kittens! It&#39;s about 4:30am here. The boys came downstairs about<br/>
and hour ago asking me to come because our Bella cat was acting funny<br/>
and discharging a bit of blood.<br/>
<br/>
I realized she was in labor right away and stayed with her. If I even<br/>
tried to get up for a minute, she would meow and meow, trying to<br/>
follow me. She insisted that we stay right next to her. <br/>
<br/>
Right as a tail begin to appear, she started walking around. The first<br/>
baby was born at the top of the stairs! We moved her into the soft<br/>
spot in the hall closet we made for her. The first baby is nursing.<br/>
She&#39;s been a good mama so far.<br/>
<br/>
Ciara and Jared are sitting right there, taking in the whole process.<br/>
Trevor comes and goes to see what&#39;s up...he&#39;s a bit grossed out by the<br/>
afterbirth thing.:)<br/>
Jalen and Bleu are asleep for now. <br/>
<br/>
Learning about birth at 4am....that&#39;s unschooling for ya! I should be<br/>
quite amusing in a few hours when I head to work all bleary eyed.<br/>
Gotta love it.<br/>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth...<br/>
<br/>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
And that has made all the difference.<br/>
