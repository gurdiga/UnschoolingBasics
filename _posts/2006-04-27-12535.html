<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812682846">&quot;If your husband can&#39;t bring himself to admit - to your SON - that his<br/>
punishment was stupid (because I can guarantee you the boy knows how<br/>
stupid it is) it may well damage their relationship.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It will definitely hurt the relationship.<br/>
Overreacting to a child&#39;s emotions and feelings (even if it seems<br/>
rude) can also hurt.<br/>
Children NEED to know that their parents can handle ALL of their<br/>
feelings. They need to know that you are confident and secure enough<br/>
in yourself to handle their very intense emotions. They do NOT need to<br/>
feel responsible for our feelings, that is NOT their job.<br/>
<br/>
If we react harshly when they say things that seem rude or hurtful,<br/>
then they learn we are not safe to share feelings with. If you can use<br/>
some reflective conversation &quot;you feel really angry at me right now&quot;<br/>
or &quot;so what you&#39;re saying is___________?&quot;  You will find them very<br/>
capable of calming down and getting to the heart of the matter with you.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen has been known to say &quot;I hate you&quot; when he&#39;s frustrated. Why<br/>
take it personal? It&#39;s a vent. They NEED to vent and feel safe with<br/>
us. It&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
Punishments are stupid. Punishments and threats only get in the way of<br/>
healthy relationships. All you have to do is picture your partner<br/>
treating you that way to see how awful it would be for the<br/>
relationship. I know it&#39;s very hard to shift paradigms on the<br/>
punishment/reward issue. But a lot of us have done it, with beautiful<br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
Taking candy away from a child doesn&#39;t truly teach them anything but<br/>
resentment and/or self-loathing. We are the mirrors that reflect our<br/>
children.  What we reflect to them is of absolute importance.<br/>
Do we reflect annoyance?<br/>
Do we reflect fear and mistrust?<br/>
Do we reflect their beauty and wholeness, their goodness?<br/>
<br/>
Balance is a really BIG part of this unschooling adventure. Ask<br/>
yourself if that child was not here tomorrow, would this thing you&#39;re<br/>
upset about really matter at all? Usually it isn&#39;t truly important.<br/>
&quot;Attitude&quot; is a GOOD thing for a child to have. They are trying to<br/>
communicate with you.<br/>
If it comes across rude/mean-spirited, where did that come from?<br/>
I would simply say &quot;I understand you are frustrated right now, but<br/>
could you say it like this (and then paraphrase for them) so I can<br/>
listen better&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are the adults. We are responsible for our own feelings. We are<br/>
responsible for how our children see themselves to a very large<br/>
degree...we need to make sure the reflection is clear and not<br/>
distorted through our own fears, lack or annoyance. We need to be full<br/>
and balanced enough to give them this....or at least process these<br/>
issues quietly on our own without dumping it on our children.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all a huge shift.<br/>
But from many of us that have BTDT, it&#39;s really an important shift to<br/>
make for the healing to take place and relationships to blossom in a<br/>
way that invites unschooling into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Also, &quot;attitude&quot; is not a puberty thing in my experience. I have a 16<br/>
year old that is really sweet and loving, not at all like the<br/>
&quot;typical&quot; teen. I think if a child is angry or speaking hurftully,<br/>
they need to be heard. There&#39;s some hurt or disrpespect they&#39;ve had in<br/>
their lives that needs to be processed. Trust the process, trust the<br/>
healing will happen.<br/>
Give them ultimate respect so they know what it looks like.<br/>

<br/>
I basically have two adolescents here now. Neither one has an attitude &quot;problem.&quot; But both of them do tend to get grumpier at times than they used to. I just try to remember what it felt like to be 12 and 16. I give them space. I give them privacy. I give them freedom to feel. I let them vent. They know I&#39;m on their side. That&#39;s HUGE.<br/>

<br/>
Stupidest of all, it ends up having the opposite effect of what the punisher <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind harsh discipline is that it will cause the child to think <br/>
about what they did, repent of it, and never repeat it.<br/>
<br/>
The reality is that harsh discipline causes the child to think about how <br/>
unfair the parent is being. The merit of the parent&#39;s position on whatever it was <br/>
that brought about the punishment is usually lost in a sea of bad feelings.<br/>

It&#39;s late. I&#39;m tired. And my eyes are mediocre on a *good* day.<br/>
<br/>
But *I* read: &quot;Not that I&#39;m advocating QUILTING children.&quot;<br/>

I read it three times before I noticed it was a G, not a Q! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I couldn&#39;t figure out from the previous text where the quilting would <br/>

I know that was not directed at me but I do agree with you.<br/>
 and our sons counceler agreed as well that when puberty hits mood <br/>
swings and many new and confusing feelings can be overwhelming for <br/>
kids. Which she told us is why he needs &quot;stability&quot; and not <br/>
wishywashyness so going back on somthing is not a good thing for him <br/>
right now. (the best thing is of course to think before saying <br/>
somthing stupid)<br/>
<br/>
 Even at 11 My son is begining to notice &quot;weird feelings&quot; (in the <br/>
pants area) when he sees girls or women in tight clothing, or short <br/>
skirts or glimpses of breasts in a low cut shirt.<br/>
<br/>
 He has moodswings from minor sadness & massive sensitivity to every <br/>
little thing, to utter frustration to laughing uncontrolably and he <br/>
has expressed concern that he doesn&#39;t quite know what to expect <br/>
next. he just &quot;outgrew&quot; his nightlight this week and this morning <br/>
told me about a dream that had a fairly sexual nature to it that <br/>
made him feel &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One moment he loves playing with somthing and the next he <br/>
has &quot;outgrown it&quot; and a bit later he enjoys it again, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
know where his interests are any more because he is right there on <br/>
the cusp of childhood and becoming a teen.<br/>
<br/>
 This is just the Tip of the Hormonal iceburg I think and because <br/>
everything is so new for him and for us its dificult for everyone.<br/>
 Not to mention the shift from a very abusive Public school to <br/>
homeschooling and then trying to ease into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To be fair I think we are all having high emotions and stress and <br/>
crying is sometimes inevitable for me, I cry easily, Im sensitive <br/>
and I have no one who cares about me to discuss my feelings with. I <br/>
have neither a family that cares to hear me &#39;whine&#39; or friends in <br/>
this area that I know well enough to bother.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that because I did end up crying that I was making <br/>
anyone responcible for my feelings, or &quot;dumping&quot; them on my child. <br/>
 I simply got up, went into my room, shut the door and proceeded to <br/>
cry. All by my self like I always do.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Stability is not the same thing as never changing your mind or admitting a mistake. For my kids, their stability is in knowing that their parents are on their side. They know we have worked through problems in a respectful tone when they were younger and we&#39;ll continue to do the same now that they&#39;re older and the challenges are bigger.<br/>
<br/>
When emotions swirl and feelings are easily hurt, they can count on that as their rock. It WILL NOT change. I&#39;m with them on this bumpy journey. I have deliberately not set myself up as their adversary. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s typical traditional counselor/parent talk. The &quot;stability&quot; he <br/>
needs is an open relationship with you where he knows you have his best <br/>
interest at heart. Where he knows he can trust you to do what&#39;s RIGHT, <br/>
not what&#39;s politically correct.<br/>
<br/>
Wishy-washy is when you can&#39;t make up your mind. It&#39;s NOT when you <br/>
realize the first decision/reaction was a bad one and correct it.<br/>
<br/>
Being honest and trustworthy is much more important than being <br/>
authoritarian.<br/>
<br/>
Being pragmatic is better than being dogmatic!<br/>
<br/>
Going back on a bad decison/reaction is MUCH better than staying the <br/>
bad/wrong course. What do you think that is teaching your son? Better a <br/>
bad decision than an apology? YUCK!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You made *those* changes because you found a better way? Right? Why <br/>
wouldn&#39;t you apologiz and make a better way with other things?<br/>
<br/>
You only have *so* much time to make things right. Not apologizing and <br/>
fixing the problem  only prolongs the problem. You only have a few more <br/>
years with him---make them joyful years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771777720"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;If your husband can&#39;t bring himself to admit - to your SON - that his<br/>
&gt; punishment was stupid (because I can guarantee you the boy knows how<br/>
&gt; stupid it is) it may well damage their relationship.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the punishment demonstrates to your son that the best method of  <br/>
resolving a conflict between two people  -- best because your husband  <br/>
has had years and years of practice to try different ways out and  <br/>
this is what he&#39;s chosen -- is to be bigger and stronger and use your  <br/>
greater power to control a smaller person.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what he wants to model?<br/>
<br/>
So if your son had a conflict with a younger neighbor, would your  <br/>
husband think it was okay if your son took away the child&#39;s toy until  <br/>
the child did what your son wanted?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He can<br/>
&gt; be all fire and brimstone sometimes because he just thinks shock  <br/>
&gt; and awe is<br/>
&gt; so effective<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well he&#39;s right! It *is* effective. But what he&#39;s seeing is the short  <br/>
term effect. What he&#39;s missing is the longer term side effect.<br/>
<br/>
Being bigger and stronger can make smaller people do what we want in  <br/>
the here and now. It can make them stop fighting. And take out the  <br/>
trash. And eat their peas. And go to bed. And not watch TV ... unless  <br/>
they&#39;re somewhere where their parents can&#39;t see them. And not do  <br/>
drugs ... unless their parents aren&#39;t around to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
Being bigger and stronger to control and make them do what we want  <br/>
&quot;works&quot; (or *appears* to work) when they&#39;re small and weak. The  <br/>
*hope* is that by they time they&#39;re bigger our message about what is  <br/>
the right way to be and act will have sunk in and they&#39;ll make the  <br/>
right choices.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that they can 1) learn to *act* the way we want and then  <br/>
are very different when they&#39;re out of our sight, or 2) be defiant  <br/>
and openly rebellious, or 3) give up and let others make decisions  <br/>
for them, or 4) decide (some of) what the parents say makes sense  <br/>
because they&#39;re older and it&#39;s more understandable.<br/>
<br/>
As much as we want to hope for 4, their reaction to authoritarianism  <br/>
really depends on their personality and how well we make up for the  <br/>
damage authoritarianism does to our relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re in the midst of &quot;If they&#39;d just do what I want them to  <br/>
then I wouldn&#39;t need to make them!&quot; it&#39;s hard to see another way. If  <br/>
we let go of making them, the only other option seems to be letting  <br/>
them have their way.<br/>
<br/>
If we stop making it about who gets to win, if we stop being  <br/>
adversaries with our kids so that one has to win and the other has to  <br/>
lose, and start being their partners, then lots more options open up.<br/>
<br/>
*And* the bonus is that we become people our kids want to be with,  <br/>
people our kids want to bring their problems to.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with authoritarianism is that it *looks* on the  <br/>
surface like it&#39;s working. Kids tend to behave around the  <br/>
authoritarian parent. But once they&#39;re out of the sight of the  <br/>
authoritarian parent it&#39;s a different story. And the sad part is that  <br/>
they aren&#39;t misbehaving because they&#39;re bad and need more control.  <br/>
They&#39;re misbehaving because they&#39;re fighting to get loose of the  <br/>
chains around them and it often turns out badly.<br/>
<br/>
When the world is divided between what you can and can&#39;t do, it&#39;s  <br/>
natural to want to challenge yourself on what others think you can&#39;t  <br/>
do. We want to show ourselves and others that we&#39;re competent, if not  <br/>
competent to handle it, at least competent enough to try. When the  <br/>
world is divided between what you enjoy and what you don&#39;t enjoy  <br/>
there isn&#39;t a reason to do what you don&#39;t enjoy ;-) (Though sometimes  <br/>
we *choose* to do something we don&#39;t enjoy because we enjoy something  <br/>
else even less, like paying taxes instead of facing the hassle of a  <br/>
tax audit, getting up at 5AM for a job because not having a job is  <br/>
worse.)<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian parents often grew up in authoritarian homes where it  <br/>
was implied that adults get their way because they&#39;re adults. And  <br/>
kids can have their way once they&#39;re adults too. So kids who&#39;ve grown  <br/>
up expecting to have their way as adults pass that legacy onto their  <br/>
own kids as the adults try to get their own way because, they feel,  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s my turn now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line of authoritarian parenting is that kids want to be  <br/>
far far away from the parent. When they&#39;re teens they *are* going to  <br/>
try risky things because they haven&#39;t been allowed to try less risky  <br/>
things as kids to learn about themselves. And when things go wrong  <br/>
they aren&#39;t going to come first to their parents. Some kids run away.  <br/>
Some adult kids want to move away from their parents and have as  <br/>
little as possible to do with them.<br/>
<br/>
Is what he&#39;s getting in the moment worth the price he&#39;ll pay in the  <br/>
future?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Trying to express love<br/>
&gt; and kindness respectfully then just as I was about to pull away my  <br/>
&gt; daughters<br/>
&gt; mouth kicks in for the last word and I slammed on the brake to give  <br/>
&gt; her the<br/>
&gt; look of the devil.  The constant conflict, noise and stress of it  <br/>
&gt; all is<br/>
&gt; really like a noose around my neck.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It takes time. It&#39;s like breaking a habit.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a clear vision of how you want to react, faking it until  <br/>
you make it is good. :-) But in the mean time it helps to be working  <br/>
on not suppressing the feelings of being out of control but of not  <br/>
feeling them.<br/>
<br/>
First, it helps to create a vision of who you want to be so you know  <br/>
what goal you&#39;re headed for.<br/>
<br/>
Second, before you respond, always give yourself two choices. And  <br/>
choose the better one, the one that moves you towards the vision. (It  <br/>
will take time to remember to give yourself two choices, but make  <br/>
that a goal. Maybe make that the only goal for the next month.) Even  <br/>
if you haven&#39;t made the best choice someone else would have, know  <br/>
that you&#39;ve made a *better* choice than in the past. And keep working  <br/>
at it, working towards even better choices.<br/>
<br/>
Third, try various techniques to connect to them throughout the day,  <br/>
to remind yourself why it&#39;s great that they&#39;re in your life so that  <br/>
can carry over into the times when you think maybe this all isn&#39;t  <br/>
worth it. When we&#39;re caught up in the moment of trying to get our  <br/>
way, our children can seem like obstacles on the path. Consciously  <br/>
work at other times to see how great they are. Imagine when they&#39;re  <br/>
sweet if tomorrow they were gone. What if you never had to pick their  <br/>
toys up again?<br/>

<br/>
Or maybe instead of being related to puberty, it&#39;s related to NOT<br/>
knowing what he really loves and trying to &quot;find&quot; himself again as he<br/>
heals.  He&#39;s been through a lot of painful and debilitating<br/>
experiences. It&#39;s going to take a LONG time for that to be worked<br/>
through. I don&#39;t think your traditional counselor is going to be very<br/>
helpful in some areas. Sounds like he/she is very understanding of<br/>
punishment, which will only get in the way of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And I think it&#39;s REALLY important for a parent to stand up to another<br/>
parent when something is wrong or hurtful. Your child deserves that.<br/>
The other night Markus was really overwhelmed. <br/>
He&#39;d been dealing with intense behaviors from Jalen all night (before<br/>
I got home from work) and the final meltdown was too much for him to<br/>
handle. I carried Jalen into the room and was letting him vent and<br/>
gently trying to calm him. Markus turns around and yells &quot;STOP <br/>
SCREAMING&quot;  <br/>
Brilliant. You want a child to stop being out of control and screaming<br/>
so you act out of control and scream??? Duh.<br/>
I looked at him and said &quot;Get out of this room RIGHT NOW and let me<br/>
deal with this&quot;. <br/>
He didn&#39;t like it, but he saw the look of death in my eyes and left.:)<br/>
<br/>
Our children need an advocate. Part of this journey as a family is<br/>
letting our partners know that they are hurting US when they hurt the<br/>
child. Part of this journey is standing up for our children when they<br/>
need us. It can be done in a loving manner, but if our partners really<br/>
value us, they need to LISTEN when something bothers us, right?<br/>
<br/>
It bothers me deeply when he is harsh or uncaring....he knows that and<br/>
does things differently because of that. When he slips, he tries<br/>
really hard to be kind and sweet afterwards. He&#39;s also willing to say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I screwed up&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s a much better model for a child than someone that is willing to<br/>
stand behind a big fat mistake!!! Consistency is not about doling out<br/>
punishments and standing behind them. It&#39;s about providing a safe,<br/>
caring and nurturing environment for the child and being attentive to<br/>
their needs.<br/>
If consistency is more desirable than those traits, most of us would<br/>
be parenting more traditionally and have our kids in school.<br/>
Consistency would mean we aren&#39;t growing and learning!! What would<br/>
that model to our children?<br/>
<br/>
Also, a lot of the healing of old hurts can&#39;t happen until unschooling<br/>
is fully embraced. It&#39;s a journey for sure...we all take steps towards<br/>
it in our own way. But when a child comes out of school at 11 years of<br/>
age, you don&#39;t have a lot of time to create a wonderful environment,<br/>
only a few years and they&#39;re adult age. Each day, each moment needs to<br/>
be focused on joy and how to BE together without friction.<br/>

<br/>
I think we are all affected by hormones and mood swings our entire<br/>
lives. I don&#39;t think attributing it all to &quot;puberty&quot; is a good idea.<br/>
Everyone is affected differently, but I also believe that part of the<br/>
&quot;mood swings&quot; are due to how our society treats these issues.<br/>
<br/>
For example, at the onset of the menstrual cycle, our society does not<br/>
celebrate this cycle of life...it&#39;s seen as a nuisance.  Honoring the<br/>
changes in our bodies, the developmental stages we all go through is<br/>
so much healthier in my opinion.<br/>
I try to imagine a bunch of women gathered around me when I got my<br/>
period as a teen. I imagine them as a circle of love, celebrating that<br/>
change with me. I picture singing and gifts and honor, rather than the<br/>
rather alienating experience I really had.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of these difficulties that puberty causes, are due to<br/>
how they are handled. Embracing these changes, honoring the feelings<br/>
our children have (fearful or otherwise) and helping them navigate<br/>
this time in their lives with respect will really go a long way to<br/>
smoother water.<br/>
<br/>
Mood swings aren&#39;t just a pubescent thing....we all deal with these<br/>
issues.  Having people around you that understand, honor your feelings<br/>
and try to provide the environment you need helps you deal with those<br/>
moods. All of us.<br/>
<br/>
If we keep saying &quot;oh, that&#39;s puberty&quot; I think it&#39;s an easy excuse to<br/>
NOT look deeper. Hormones may exascerbate certain moods, but I think<br/>
we need to really look at where the feelings are coming from and<br/>
whether there are changes that need to be made.<br/>

<br/>
Is there not scientific proof that during the phase we refer to <br/>
as &quot;puberty&quot; there are huge fluctuations in these hormones as the <br/>
body changes?  Those Fluctuations can effect to a great degree how <br/>
someone acts and reacts to the world and the people arround them. <br/>

<br/>
We do all deal with them and as adults we have had years of practice <br/>
since puberty in dealing with them.<br/>
  hormones do fluctuate throughout our lives although not as <br/>
intensely as in puberty or durring advancing age.<br/>
 A woman going through menopause can tell you that even though she <br/>
may have experianced hormonal flux as an adult that Menopause can <br/>
bring it to a whole diferent level.<br/>
 Children just entering puberty have nothing to compaire with, I <br/>
think we do them a diservice if we do not take into acount how new <br/>
feelings and fluctuating hormones can have an effect on them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The changes in hormones can impact how we act on our emotions and moods.<br/>
And people are so subjective when it comes to how much hormonal change they<br/>
can handle.  Post partum is a good example of this.  Some women produce a<br/>
lot of prolactin after childbirth.  This is a good thing in that it helps<br/>
bring on a good supply of milk.  For most women this hormone helps calm them<br/>
and keep them relaxed.  Some women produce very little prolactin.  They<br/>
struggle with breastfeeding and are very moody or depressed.  Some women<br/>
produce prolactin in swings and will bounce from a state of euphoria to a<br/>
state of depression in a matter of a few hours. Some women can handle the<br/>
changes in hormonal level after birth and while they may feel depressed, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t inhibit their ability to cope.  Other women can&#39;t handle these<br/>
changes and need assistance in balancing their emotions out.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really recall if hormones effected me much.  I was a very &quot;loner&quot;<br/>
kid and hid about in my room most of the time reading.  I do remember<br/>
watching friends go through changes and thinking, &quot;What&#39;s got into<br/>
her/him?&quot;  Some women never seem deal with PMS some women you just want to<br/>
shoot to get them out of your misery :)   Some men don&#39;t have a midlife<br/>
crisis and need to go find a PYT or buy a motorcycle and others wake up one<br/>
morning and go, &#39;Huh, there&#39;s a gray hair.  Interesting&quot; and go about their<br/>
life like normal.<br/>

Cramps -- no one can tell me it is psychosomatic.  I had no idea <br/>
there was a connection, until I had them, and my mom said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s <br/>
probably from your period.&quot;  Sure enough, each month, pain.  I would <br/>
find it hard to celebrate those months that I&#39;ve had double-over in <br/>
pain until I can&#39;t see straight cycles.  Thankfully, that is not <br/>
often, but it has happened. <br/>
<br/>
I also remember my surprise when, as a teen, a friend said, &quot;Oh, <br/>
everyone gets crabby that time of month.&quot;  I told her, no, I never <br/>
did, my mom never did.  She was as surprised by that, as I was by her <br/>
comment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think it is too bad that girls and women (and I <br/>
don&#39;t think I was truly a woman when I first started, not <br/>
emotionally) so often feel embarrassed by it all.  <br/>

And of course, if you are wearing white pants, that&#39;s when things <br/>
happen unexpectedly.... ;-)<br/>

unhappy about budding breasts.  I would have given my eye teeth to <br/>
NOT develop until later.  (On another board, I read that 2/3 of all <br/>
women have been sexually abused at some point.  That&#39;s gotta have <br/>
emotional/mood consequences!)<br/>

sexuality, puberty, etc. with our children.<br/>

My son is 13 (14 in October) and my husband hangs out in the <br/>
bathroom with him (about 3-5 nights) a week while my son showers. <br/>
They usually talk about girls and changes in his body. <br/>
His voice is changing and will change 2-3 octives in one sentence <br/>

My son hasn&#39;t hit puberty yet (late bloomer), but I am fairly confident that my mother would back me up in saying I didn&#39;t have moodiness/mood swings when I was in puberty.  Any moods I felt tended to have a specific cause -- and hormones didn&#39;t change that.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well we *are* a moody family here. &lt;g&gt; But in general it was not an issue for Conor when he was younger. Something definitely changed when the hormones came in. But you&#39;re absolutely right, it is individual. But it&#39;s also something that does happen. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely! What I was saying is that emotions can and many times do increase during puberty. At least they have in our house! But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m fighting with my kids or they&#39;re sullen and distant from us. It just means I&#39;ve had to adjust some of my expectations for interactions during this time. It&#39;s ALL about how we react and respond to them that matters. We have an incredibly peaceful and happy pair of adolescents here. That&#39;s because of radical unschooling. It&#39;s because I don&#39;t take one instant of short temper as a personal insult. I relate to them as real people with real needs. <br/>
