<div id="ygrps-yiv-607975663">I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m still struggling with wanting to interfere more<br/>
with my 8 yo. dd&#39;s social issues than I should.  For example, she and<br/>
her friends were letterboxing (searching for letterboxes at a park,<br/>
kind of like a treasure hunt) and there were only two letterboxes but<br/>
several friends.  At one point, they were searching for the last<br/>
letterbox and one of her friends spotted it and wanted to get it, but<br/>
my dd was closer and she grabbed it down.  I know it sounds so silly,<br/>
but I spoke up before she grabbed it and asked that she let her friend<br/>
who spotted it get the letterbox.  I was thinking that it wasn&#39;t fair<br/>
that the girl who spotted it shouldn&#39;t get it down and that my dd<br/>
should leave it and could maybe help open it up or something else.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking back, I realized that the other mother&#39;s didn&#39;t get involved<br/>
and that I may have upset my dd by speaking up and that I should have<br/>
kept quiet.  I have to trust that she will learn social skills on her<br/>
own and that her friend&#39;s will guide her.  Or maybe I shouldn&#39;t say<br/>
anything at the time and wait until we are alone to discuss it with her.<br/>
<br/>
I always felt like a social reject growing up (and still plenty of<br/>
times now - lol) and so I think that I may feel the need to have more<br/>
control with dd in this area.  I&#39;m not definite about this, but<br/>
sometimes I think that is how I feel.<br/>
<br/>
I would love some insight into this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that most of the times the children will work it out between <br/>
them if you just let them work it through. My children are 4 and 2 and <br/>
when they want womething the other has they often get physical but <br/>
since I have been using different methods the 4 yr old has started to <br/>
find ways to &quot;work it out&quot; so both gets to have what they want. Many <br/>
times I will stand back and see how they will resolve the issue but am <br/>
ready to pounce if it gets out of hand. My mom on the other hand wants <br/>
me to step in and make it fair for the little one or teach the older <br/>
one to share or what not and I tell her that they have to live <br/>
together without me and they have to find ways to work it out or they <br/>
will be worse to each other. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes life is not fair and that is okay- If the girl who spotted <br/>
it did not throw a fit or say hey I see it I get it then you could <br/>
have let it go. Your daughter got it first and that is okay to. I do <br/>
not think we should teach our children to *always give into someone <br/>
eles* or *always share with people* or *always be nice* these things <br/>
are not reality and do not teach children to stand up for their ideas, <br/>
thought, opinions, wants, needs..... <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts- <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228476562">The other thing I meant to suggest with intervening prescriptively in <br/>
these kinds of situations is that you risk drawing the negativity of the <br/>
moment as your *fault* rather than a natural consequence of your dd&#39;s <br/>
choice. Social situations can be naturally corrective or not, we can&#39;t <br/>
always predict. And while there are ways we can gently intervene without <br/>
thwarting the natural learning moment between peers as a way of <br/>
mitigating potentially painful natural consequences, I personally think <br/>
it&#39;s important to do so in a way the preserves the peer relations. Kind <br/>
of like the police being called into a domestic dispute and both parties <br/>
turning on the police, kwim? I try to step in with the role of mediator <br/>
and facilitator rather than authority if that makes any sense because I <br/>
feel I can help without detracting or disempowering.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a tired mantra, but I feel that if I keep empowerment as my <br/>
goal, then I tend to approach things in a way that&#39;s more conducive to <br/>
helping my kids find their own paths while simultaneously being able to <br/>
help avoid or at least diminish painful consequences. Not that I&#39;m a <br/>
100% perfect practitioner, but that&#39;s my goal.<br/>
