<div id="ygrps-yiv-905457287">Jealous why?<br/>
<br/>
Look at your kids - are they happy doing what they&#39;re doing? If so, it&#39;s enough. Keep strewing, but don&#39;t do that with the idea that &quot;THIS is what&#39;s going to get them excited!&quot; - do it because you know them, and you know what their interests are, and you want to share something interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is really, really content at home, connecting with friends online. When he goes out anywhere, as soon as we&#39;re done doing what we said we were doing, he&#39;s immediately ready to come home. It&#39;s who he is, right now, and I don&#39;t have a need for him to have more friends or be more involved in the community, or want to be out more. He&#39;s happy, and excited by what he does do at home.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read about different personality types - introvert/extrovert? Introverts recharge their energy by being alone, extroverts by being around people. Introverts feel drained after being around groups of people, or sometimes in loud places. They can do it, and most *enjoy* parties, being around other people, but they&#39;re ultimately drained by it, and need alone time to recharge. The extrovert is certainly more &quot;rewarded&quot; in our society, and in school, and one of the real joys of unschooling is the ability to celebrate our kids for who they are, without the desire for them to be anyone other than that.<br/>
<br/>
This could be a really helpful time for you to look within, and ask yourSELF why you have these fears around your kids and what brings them enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

what this kid is doing- why can&#39;t you take the opportunities I am <br/>
offering you! Not my intention- just offered as an example as how one <br/>
can expand on an interest. Some kids have paths that are easier for <br/>
adults to understand, though. This is one that many people can get. He <br/>
is doing a lot less of this at the moment, and seems to be going in <br/>
another direction. This summer he has focused on skateboarding and <br/>
mountain biking just about every day - and getting a job as a cashier. <br/>
All this involves a ton of learning, too The type of learning he does <br/>
fits his personality- very active and adventurous. Other people are more <br/>
comfortable learning at home. Like myself, for instance.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of room for all types of poeple - some are more <br/>
impressive and outward, and that is cool. Some are quieter and content <br/>
to be at home - and that is really great, too. I am a &quot;homebody&quot; myself <br/>
so can relate. It has been and still is a journey for me to accept my <br/>
two very different kids and their different ways of learning and <br/>
approaches to life.<br/>
<br/>
I think the real question is here- are your kids content with their <br/>
lives? If they are, then all is well. You could try exploring some <br/>
things you are interested in yourself if you need some excitement!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My son&#39;s interest in listening to music expanded to such things as going<br/>
<br/>
to local concerts, playing the electric bass, then trying the upright <br/>
bass at a music camp, which led to lessons when he requested them, to <br/>
playing with various groups such as the high school jazz band, high <br/>
school pit orchestras for musicals, a youth orchestra, several different <br/>
youth organized bands, attending scale classes at a local college, <br/>
apprenticing with a luthier, apprenticing with a sound technician, <br/>
recording music on his own, teaching electric bass, etc. Just to give <br/>
you an idea - not that your son&#39;s interest in music would lead to any of <br/>
that.<br/>
