<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217198329">after reading some of the post regarding cleaning up and what not, i <br/>
evaluated our situation. i don&#39;t mind if my children&#39;s room is a <br/>
disaster and i will clean it with them or by myself if it is <br/>
overwhelming to anyone....the problem i was finding was that they <br/>
would bring their toys and &quot;mess&quot; into my room....*my space* and it <br/>
was driving me crazy. i would remind them to keep their things in <br/>
their room or the play room but everything always ended up in my <br/>
room...SO i thought during the day, i thought as i was laying in bed <br/>
and it hit me....i dont&#39; know why i didn&#39;t realize it before. my room <br/>
is a fun bright color, has a big window, lots of space, always <br/>
light....it is a very appealing room. their room is nice and a fun <br/>
color, but not as much floor space, light or window....SO the other <br/>
day we all worked together (my 7,5 and 1yo) to move the bedrooms! we <br/>
created a really fun room for them in the big bright room and i moved <br/>
mine to the calm smaller playroom leaving their old bedroom an empty <br/>
bubblegum pink space.  one step closer to giving them freedom. <br/>
<br/>
and so far my space hasn&#39;t even been considered for anything other <br/>
than a nap....it is way too relaxing:) ....who&#39;s to say the parents <br/>
need to occupy the biggest room with bathroom...i think my daughters <br/>
will appreciate it much more than i could and now i won&#39;t even think <br/>
twice (not that i really did before) about the globs of toothpaste <br/>
and dirt around the main bathroom sink....the girls now have their <br/>
*own* hidden away in their nice big room. <br/>
<br/>
just thought i would share.<br/>
peace, sarah</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575722217">Hey, Sarah!  Great idea!<br/>
 <br/>
It is amazing when we open up and let creativity flow instead of living in  <br/>
&quot;just because.&quot;  Unschooling rocks!<br/>
 <br/>
I had a problem with my living room getting taken over....a room my husband  <br/>
needed uncluttered.  I finally moved the tv out and try to keep the play  <br/>
areas open and tidy (what had lured them to the living room in the first  place!). <br/>
 Such an easy solution to a situation that had caused so much  stress.<br/>
