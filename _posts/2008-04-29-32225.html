<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109012050">No ideas here. That&#39;s happened to DS once or twice with a family we had<br/>
regularly scheduled playdates with for a few years. At first, it was<br/>
upsetting to DS because it disrupted how he saw the day going - sudden<br/>
schedule changes are always an issue. But, one time, he went over there<br/>
to play (there are 3 boys in the family, a set of twins slightly older<br/>
than DS and another slightly younger than DS, made for a great &#39;pack&#39; of<br/>
boys to play) and the youngest was &#39;allowed&#39; to play but the other two<br/>
hadn&#39;t finished their schoolwork (they home&#39;school&#39;) so they couldn&#39;t<br/>
play. DS also started noticing that they had to ask permission to use<br/>
their Gameboys and had limits on how long they could play - something<br/>
foreign to him. He couldn&#39;t quite understand why someone would give a<br/>
kid a Gameboy and then not let them use it. We&#39;d talk it through,<br/>
validate his feelings, and now - at almost 10 - he actually feels a bit<br/>
sorry for kids who are forced to do or not do things, all the rules,<br/>
regulations, chores, schoolwork/homework, etc. That&#39;s why we call him<br/>
our &quot;Free Radical&quot; - he thinks all kids should be set free to grow, and<br/>
explore, and live life.<br/>

I know the feeling, it happens all to often or homework seems to get <br/>
inn the way of friends coming over. I have learned to never tell my <br/>
children that their friends are coming until I know they are on the <br/>
way, in route, I request a phone call from the parent to let me know <br/>
they are on the way.  It works for some cases. Another problem, I ran <br/>
into was that the parents may over book them selves and cant drive,so I <br/>
offer to pick up and drop off a lot. I tell my kids that we have made <br/>
tenative plans, but that I wont know for sure until they are on the <br/>
way. I quit saying anything that sounds like a for sure thing. The <br/>
dissapointment is not so great that way, and when they do get <br/>
dissapointed I try and come up with something else we can go do thats <br/>
fun. I hope this helps some.<br/>

All I can say is that *I* don&#39;t think that&#39;s right. And I tell my boys <br/>
that *my* relationship with them is so much more important and that I <br/>
would never do such a thing to them. I say that I&#39;m sooo sorry someone <br/>
else would treat her own kids this way and that I&#39;m so mad she would <br/>
choose to inflict such treatment on my boys as a side effect. I think <br/>
it&#39;s creepy, and I would say so.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that that is one reason we choose to parent the way we <br/>
do---because I hate to see things like that happen. I am as open and <br/>
honest as I can be about the situation. We commiserate with each other <br/>
and with the absent friend. And we realize why *our* house is the cool <br/>
house to hang out at! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

stark contrast and is very appreciative of his peaceful, joyful, <br/>
sensible, even if sorta funky home, perhaps more than he might be if <br/>
every other home were also as peaceful and nonpunitive.  Or maybe <br/>
not.  I don&#39;t know.   He sure expresses a lot of gratitude!<br/>

his choice to join and each week if he doesn&#39;t want to go (so far only<br/>

one of the other boys about watching television and was shocked to<br/>
find out that this little boy isn&#39;t allowed to watch television except<br/>
for watching videos on Friday nights.   He is also limited on computer<br/>

this week for having a potty mouth&quot;     Later he asked me what<br/>
grounded meant and why other kids get grounded.   Now mind you most of<br/>
these parents are very young and have very young children and I<br/>

didn&#39;t limit tv, video games or computer time and the other parents<br/>
were shocked.   We have had other conversations about not having<br/>
bedtimes and limits on other things so they pretty much think I am a<br/>

hill in the backyard and rode it down while the other kids were eating<br/>
snack like they hadn&#39;t been fed in days (another limit they all put on<br/>
their kids! UGH!)  By the end all of the kids rode the wagon down<br/>

probably crash and get hurt!    Since Jack is my youngest I think they<br/>
all think I have just &quot;given up&quot;  yet they always comment on how<br/>
pleasant he is and he&#39;s never a problem.   Oh and I won&#39;t even get<br/>
into the consequences I saw being doled out when one boy threw a ball<br/>
inside the house and broke two small vases that were on a shelf (the<br/>
hostess immediately told the mom it wasn&#39;t a big deal the vases were<br/>

reflect on you as a parent if something happens like that?   I would<br/>
apologize, offer to replace the broken item or compensate them if the<br/>

of &quot;punishment&quot; for our own families. If anything, saying &quot;I feel like <br/>
we&#39;re being punished&quot; suggests that the other family has some sort of <br/>
authority to change your behavior - and they don&#39;t. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553215586">Although we haven&#39;t had the experience of kids not being able to keep a <br/>
play date because of punishment, we recently had an experience that <br/>
kind of shook me. We were visiting a friend I have not seen in a while. <br/>
<br/>
We used to be very good friends, but a few years ago they became born <br/>
again Christians (which is fine, I don&#39;t have a problem with that)and <br/>
decided that we were to worldly, so they didn&#39;t invite us over very <br/>
much. They did invite us over and she was talking about how she needs <br/>
to punish her 3 yr old by spanking him with a paddle because he doesn&#39;t <br/>
say hello back when the pastor says hello to him. Then she left him in <br/>
the bathroom for 1/2 an hour because he peed his pants. Fortunately my <br/>
kids did not see any of this because they were outside in the back,and <br/>
we left right then.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I don&#39;t want to see them anymore, so I know how other <br/>
people feel when they say they don&#39;t want to see us anymore!<br/>

  How did you handle that?<br/>
  I would have been out of my mind wanting to tell my &#39;friend&#39; she was insane!  The child was only three?  Nope.  I wouldn&#39;t want my kids around her either.  Shoot, I don&#39;t even want HER kids around her.<br/>
   <br/>
  Yikes!<br/>

legal to spank with your hand. You cannot hit a child with any other <br/>
kind of instrument. Just something to think about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812944662">WTF!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s child abuse, folks.<br/>
<br/>
Ex-kind-of-a-friend-you-still-see-sometimes or not, she needs to be<br/>
told that she&#39;s not allowed to do these things.<br/>
<br/>
That if DCF shows up at her door, this isn&#39;t going to be acceptable<br/>
and, more importantly, it&#39;s not acceptable to most civilized people.<br/>
<br/>
What else does she does she do when you&#39;re not there? Whatever she and<br/>
her husband get up to, they shouldn&#39;t be hiding behind their religion<br/>
to terrorize their kids and if she hasn&#39;t figured that out on her own<br/>
and needs to be told, you need to tell her!<br/>
