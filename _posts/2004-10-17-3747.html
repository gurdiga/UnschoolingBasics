<div id="ygrps-yiv-212091636">&quot;The worry isn&#39;t all-consuming, and after you do it for a while, when<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it does<br/>
&gt; come up it&#39;s surprising. But all parents worry sometimes. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree and disagree.:) I was unschooling several years ago, and <br/>
still had worries. So yeah, you can unschool and still worry of <br/>
course. But part of REALLY GETTING unschooling, deep down in my <br/>
heart and knowing it as TRUTH, was worries disappearing. Gone, poof! <br/>
Just like that.<br/>
It didn&#39;t happen overnight, I don&#39;t know exactly the moment it <br/>
happened, but it did.<br/>
I think worries about our children are part of being a concerned <br/>
parent, but I never worry about unschooling harming my child in any <br/>
way. I never, ever worry about them &quot;getting&quot; academic subjects in <br/>
their own way (or not). Never.<br/>
Jared is just beginning to read at 11 y.o. I don&#39;t worry about him <br/>
at all. Not a bit.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s just me perhaps. But I do believe that a deep, heartfelt <br/>
trust in unschooling makes that possible.<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the worries, I still remember the fears. So I can <br/>
relate and understand those feelings. But they aren&#39;t here anymore. <br/>
I believe it&#39;s possible for all unschooling parents to get to that <br/>
point. Concerned parents always think about their children and have <br/>
fleeting worries...that doesn&#39;t mean unschooling worries are there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone, but that is my world. It&#39;s <br/>
possible.<br/>

((((((((Danielle)))))))))))))<br/>
<br/>
I know how extremely frustrating it is!! My dh and I went round and <br/>
round about these issues for three years....he finally, finally <br/>
really &quot;got&quot; unschooling about a year ago. Hang in there, you&#39;re <br/>
confidence and joy will eventually win out.:)<br/>
