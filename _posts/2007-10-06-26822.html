&gt;   &lt;&lt;Thanks for the info though. I have tried to relax. This is obviously a<br/>
&gt; difficult issue for me. Progress is not a straight line. I&#39;ll get there<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s going to be a hard road.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Karen,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This morning on my run I was thinking about you! I had posted last<br/>
&gt; week about how my dad was always a healthy, active guy and by him<br/>
&gt; modeling such a life I naturally emulated it. My mom was less active,<br/>
&gt; ate junk, watched A LOT of TV. I always saw the energy my dad had in<br/>
&gt; comparison and knew that a healthy, active life was the route I<br/>
&gt; wanted to take. However, when I was 20 I went through a rough spot in<br/>
&gt; my life. I packed on some pounds and felt awful. Physically and<br/>
&gt; mentally. I was working long hours, eating bad and not getting my<br/>
&gt; workouts in. I lost focus on taking care of myself. After putting up<br/>
&gt; with this for awhile, I finally decided no more. I started to eat<br/>
&gt; right again. I resumed my work outs. I started to lose weight and<br/>
&gt; feel really good about myself again. During that period of taking<br/>
&gt; control and losing weight, I also became very angry at the fat<br/>
&gt; america I was living in. My mom is an ex-smoker. I&#39;ve always been a<br/>
&gt; non-smoker. Although I think smoking is disgusting, my mom holds much<br/>
&gt; more judgment and anger surrounding the issue. If she could quit why<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t everyone else? I was this way with weight loss. In that time<br/>
&gt; when I was losing weight I was so frustrated by those around me. Quit<br/>
&gt; crying about your weight and do something for gosh sakes, I did! I<br/>
&gt; was so against junk food being eaten all the time. I was militant and<br/>
&gt; wanted only healthy food around. Years removed from the weight loss I<br/>
&gt; am not so militant. Do I still think a healthy, active lifestyle is<br/>
&gt; best? Absolutely! Do I want to impart that lifestyle to my children?<br/>
&gt; Absolutely!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe this isn&#39;t how you are feeling at all, but I wanted to share my<br/>
&gt; experience during the time I was losing weight. I was angered with<br/>
&gt; the Fat american epidemic and it feels like you are at that point<br/>
&gt; too. Although, probably much more so since you have struggled with<br/>
&gt; weight issues your whole life. Congrats on losing all your weight.<br/>
&gt; That is amazing. Keep it up!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to type this with lots of commotion in the house. Dh is<br/>
&gt; rough housing with the kiddos and we are about to walk out the door,<br/>
&gt; so I hope it made sense.<br/>

choices and he&#39;ll respond by picking some of them. Keep it up. Don&#39;t  <br/>
be disappointed if there are times he says, &quot;I just want mac and  <br/>
cheese.&quot; Just smile and make it for him, but maybe put some carrots  <br/>
and some cantaloupe on the side and say, &quot;Hey, I made you an &quot;all- <br/>
orange&quot; meal.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.<br/>

Hey Karen? Wanna make a bet? I bet you a year from now you&#39;re one of us  <br/>
obnoxious people arguing with unschooling newbies that it CAN and DOES work and  <br/>
that they need to relax. ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Great work!<br/>

I told Ben the same thing last night!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been on the computer for several hours yesterday, and he asked <br/>
whether I&#39;d saved the whole world yet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I told him there was this one mom who was soooo close. And that, if we <br/>
could get her over this hump, she&#39;d be doing all the convincing of <br/>
newbies this time next year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
