<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766043735">That got sorted quickly in the end.  I had a chat with him and it turns out he had seen a different course that he was really, really into doing ( the online college had put up some new ones after he got his) but didn&#39;t want to say cos he had only just got the Egyptology. ( which he admitted he hates with a passion). I looked at the small print and realised he could transferred if we asked within six months - quick phone call and job done. One happy smiling boy again and one very relieved mum.  Courses suck.<br/>
