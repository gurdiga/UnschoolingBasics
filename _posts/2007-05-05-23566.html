<div id="ygrps-yiv-7018351">This was posted on another list that I&#39;m on. It made several points ...mostly about how we <br/>
have to change the way we think in order to change our lives, and how trading in our false <br/>
sense of &quot;knowing&quot; for curiosity can lead to a much fuller life...I enjoyed it and thought I&#39;d <br/>
pass the link along.<br/>

I don&#39;t know anything about Nicole Mackenzie, but I thought the little film (9 minutes) was <br/>
thought provoking.<br/>
