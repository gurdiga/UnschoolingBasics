<div id="ygrps-yiv-600816041">Hi;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in So Cal also.  Seven years ago I was faced with the very same <br/>
problem.  Fortunately my cancer turned out to be a huge cyst and was <br/>
removed surgically.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an RN and Kenneth Norris at USC is the best possible place to get <br/>
your answer.  Those doctors know what they are doing and if God for <br/>
bid it is positive, they are the best in So Cal to treat it.<br/>
<br/>
I live in the South Bay, if your near by we could get together.  I <br/>
have a 11yo dd.  Email if you would like.<br/>
<br/>
