<div id="ygrps-yiv-349488605">Today was quite a hilarious day.  My children and I have been gradually introducing more <br/>
types of food into our home and today they reminded me of the book &#39;The Hungry <br/>
Caterpillar&#39; by Eric Carle.  <br/>
<br/>
My 3 yr old daughter and I went to the supermarket and almost everything that she put in <br/>
the cart remained there. ( I am still not all the way but getting there).  Within 2 hours of <br/>
getting home she had eaten:<br/>
3 lollipops with bubblegum inside.<br/>
1 Yogurt smoothie<br/>
Some of my baby Spinach/Mushroom salad<br/>
1/2 pack of Goldfish<br/>
A small box of strawberry soy milk<br/>
Some pieces of Chocolate<br/>
1/2 of a Palmier (a kind of pastry)<br/>
1 slice of Monterey Jack cheese<br/>
6 slices of Veggie Ham<br/>
A few bites of a strawberry lollie<br/>
Stuffed olives.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what I saw - there may be more.  She was certainly getting into trying the <br/>
different things, putting them half-eaten into the fridge, switching to something else, <br/>
going back to the original food, and more.  It was quite interesting to watch.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old son, on the other hand, is going to take some time to remove the internal <br/>
voice of restriction.  I can see that he is holding himself back and trying to limit his <br/>
enjoyment of the &#39;junky&#39; items.  He even said that he doesn&#39;t like me buying all of this stuff <br/>
and that he prefers if it is not around.  I am not necessarily seeing this as a sign of his <br/>
&#39;clarity&#39; around food.  I think that he probably had to rationalize all the restrictions and <br/>
now can&#39;t let himself go.  It was a bit sad to see how he was struggling (it showed on his <br/>
face and in his taking something and putting it back and then taking it again).  I said <br/>
nothing and I&#39;m just going to continue to let this thing unfold.  I trust that it will get <br/>
figured out.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, the main challenge remains that in a small community where when I go to the <br/>
grocery store I see 20 people that I know - and there are others who know me from <br/>
healthy eating TV shows - I continue to feel a bit self-conscious.  In a small place you are <br/>
much more visible and I am sometimes &#39;relied&#39; on to show the direction around food.  <br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get accustomed.<br/>
