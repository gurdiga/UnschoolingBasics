<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537764868">The <br/>
problem is our first review is in January and I have to present <br/>
records of dated work, teaching supplies, attendance records (that <br/>
one makes me laugh), etc. I have been keeping records but our <br/>
unschooling has turned into school of late - yuk. We are in Talbot <br/>
County Maryland - on the Eastern Shore<br/>
****<br/>
No, No, NO!<br/>
Md law does not require ANY of the above. Please head to NHEN.org and read up on the laws.<br/>
A portfolio of samples of work is all that is needed. No attendance, no teaching supply list, you don&#39;t have to show &quot;dated work&quot;. You do not have to show progress. You must show that you provide &quot;a regular and thourough method of instruction&quot;.<br/>
Please know your state laws and don&#39;t give them anything more than that.<br/>
Best of all, Md. allows for an umbrella school option in which you avoid the county school district completely.<br/>
