on the other hand, has no clue. What advice would you give a child<br/>
in that situation?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was SO much like that. It took me years and years to find myself <br/>
again and really remember what I am passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend that you encourage her to take a break from <br/>
school. If she could kick back, relax and do some things just for <br/>
FUN, it might help that self-realization kick in. I think the <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook would be a great one, there&#39;s also <br/>
another one Grace Lewellyn wrote...the name is escaping me right <br/>
now, something about Teens that left school for real life? Can&#39;t <br/>
remember. Someone will be along shortly with the name.<br/>
<br/>
Help her do things and go places she loves this summer, get a lot of <br/>
videos and watch them together, buy foods she enjoys and basically <br/>
make the next few months interesting and enjoyable for you all. <br/>
Which is good advice for everyday of course...but I think she could <br/>
really use a dose of what freedom really feels like.<br/>
I wish someone had helped me see the alternatives to college and <br/>
typical jobs earlier on.<br/>
<br/>
And take her to the conference!:)<br/>
