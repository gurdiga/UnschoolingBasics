<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581988969">Last night at the cafe I met a really interesting man.  He came up and<br/>
asked for a &quot;something&quot; (a word I can&#39;t remember now but intend to<br/>
look up later) and I found out that the word means &quot;something to eat&quot;<br/>
He talked for me for a while (it was really slow at the cafe last<br/>
night) and he was just SO interesting.  I asked him what his<br/>
profession was and he asked me what I thought he did.  I told him that<br/>
I hoped that he was a teacher, because he was interesting and seemed<br/>
like the kind of person who could easily share his information in a<br/>
way that people would enjoy.  He then said, &quot;I do not like teachers or<br/>
schools.  And tests are a horrible invention.  Tests do not tell us<br/>
what a student has learned.  Tests tell us what a teacher has failed<br/>
to communicate.  When a student fails a test, it is not the student<br/>
who is at fault.  It is the teacher who has failed.  That teacher has<br/>
failed to effectively teach that student in a way in which that<br/>
student needs material presented to him.  I am sad that you would<br/>
think I was a teacher.&quot;  I smiled and told him that we at least agreed<br/>
on tests and it was one of the reasons that I homeschool my children.<br/>
I hope he comes to the cafe again.  He never did tell me what it was<br/>
that he does.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm a &#39;nosh&#39; maybe? That&#39;s the first word I thought of that isn&#39;t the <br/>
typical &quot;snack&quot; word. &quot;eppes essen&quot; in Yiddish is roughly &quot;good eats&quot; <br/>
maybe it was related to that? <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I had to find a thesaurus online and search on &#39;snack&#39; <br/>
(since &quot;something to eat&quot; didn&#39;t get me anywhere)&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
a bite, gorp, grub, nibble, nunch, tidbit, morsel, munchies, sop, <br/>
peck, vittles or victuals, chow, soupcon<br/>
<br/>
just some of the ones from the list that were less often used<br/>
