<div id="ygrps-yiv-230339142">Thanks, Pam.  Well I haven&#39;t heard the term Joyful disruption before, but I have done that plenty, and you are right that it should work well in this situation.  Guess I was too busy being bothered to think of it...good idea, thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Have you read about &quot;joyful disruptions?&quot; This might be a good use of <br/>
that kind of response - or at least something verbally imaginative.<br/>
<br/>
For example, he says, &quot;No, don&#39;t eat cereal,&quot; and you say, &quot;It isn&#39;t <br/>
cereal - I&#39;m eating a big bowl of juicy fat WORMS. YUM YUM YUM.&quot; He <br/>
says, &quot;Mommy, don&#39;t take a shower,&quot; and you say, &quot;Well, if I don&#39;t <br/>
we&#39;re going to be able to plant seeds all over my skin, I&#39;ll be so <br/>
dirty, and then the seeds will grow into plants and I will be a walking <br/>
forest.&quot; Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Could work - having a sense of humor really helps a lot with parenting. <br/>
You just have to be careful that it doesn&#39;t come across as teasing or <br/>
making fun of him.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I&#39;ll be listening to other responses, because I also do not <br/>
at ALL handle it well when I feel like somebody is ordering me around. <br/>
It pushes all my buttons, too. I&#39;m sure there will be others here with <br/>
some great insight and we&#39;ll both learning something!<br/>
