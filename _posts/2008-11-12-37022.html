<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444380349">Thanks everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I was very encouraged by all of your responses.  I am going to let my daughter be.  It really <br/>
helped me to hear others support the idea of allowing my daughter to be who she is without <br/>
trying to change or &quot;fix&quot; her.  Thanks so much.  I&#39;m letting it go....what a relief for both of us!<br/>
