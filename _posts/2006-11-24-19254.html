<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462088957">I have &quot;The Green Guide&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/)">http://www.thegreenguide.com/)</a> set up as my <br/>
home page when I get online, which I forgot to include in my earlier <br/>
&quot;green links&quot;....but anyway, they have some great tips on holiday <br/>
shopping and one thing I came across that I have to pass on is a link to <br/>
this...the online International Children&#39;s Library...it&#39;s super!  You <br/>
may need a few plug-ins but the interface is great.<br/>

    Mission statement<br/>
<br/>
The mission of the International Children&#39;s Digital Library Foundation <br/>
(ICDL Foundation) is to support the world&#39;s children in becoming <br/>
effective members of the global community - who exhibit tolerance and <br/>
respect for diverse cultures, languages and ideas -- by making the best <br/>
in children&#39;s literature available online free of charge. The Foundation <br/>
pursues its vision by building a digital library of outstanding <br/>
children&#39;s books from around the world and supporting communities of <br/>
children and adults in exploring and using this literature through <br/>
innovative technology designed in close partnership with children for <br/>
children.<br/>
