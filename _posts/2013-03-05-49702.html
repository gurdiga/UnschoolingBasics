<div id="ygrps-yiv-266297922">Hello<br/>
<br/>
we have recently moved to a new town(about 20 miles away from where we used to live). <br/>
Volen have requested a house party. My concern is that all 6(all similar age) boys he wants to invite do not know each other, they know Volen individually. I was also thinking, if he agrees, to invite the kids from the two next door houses and get to know them. Their kids range from 3 to 11. Now if it was 4 years old birthday party, we could probably rent a bouncy castle and be sure kids will play happily. But at this age I worry two of them will play minecraft and the rest will be wondering what to do.<br/>
I can organize pass the parcel and musical chairs, even though not sure how well this will go at that age. And I need more ideas and suggestions.<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>

If you do that separately, it will make planning easier for everyone. You&#39;re already inviting kids who don&#39;t know each other. The trouble with adding neighbors is that you&#39;re inviting people who likely Do know each other and have their own social circles and biases pre-established. Get to know those relationships before you decide to drop your son&#39;s other friends into the mix.<br/>

<br/>
Have a Video Game party - maybe a straight-up Minecraft party. Make sure there are enough games and controllers for everyone. If you have a server, consider setting up a world just for the party. Plan to have someone help out younger kids - talk to your son about being a good host in that regard, but also be ready to step in as needed. Have other things to do as well, but if you state up-front that its a games party, that sets everyone&#39;s expectations in the right direction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember any parties I went to as a kid where I knew most of the people. I *was* uncomfortable at the parties but I&#39;m an introvert so that pretty much goes without saying. ;-) The focus at parties wasn&#39;t on each other. It was on the activities, food, opening presents. In fact it felt uncomfortable when there were kids who knew each other because they&#39;d form comfortable groups that left others out. I at least felt connect with others in our lack of knowing others ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you have activities planned they shouldn&#39;t be wandering off to play Minecraft. Unless the point of the party is to get together to play Minecraft. If they are all MInecrafters, there might be physical games you could play, like collect loads of cardboard boxes and create something together out of it. I&#39;m sure there are ideas on the internet from clever Moms :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Parties -- especially for kids -- aren&#39;t a great way to get to know people. It&#39;s more about entertainment than each other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d invite them over maybe for some specific activity. Like building things with the boxes :-) Or Nerf play. Or decorating cookies. Or some science experiment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742711875">A Nerf gun party  is a great way for all ages to have fun.<br/>
In the Summer I do a water gun party!<br/>
Just have a big container in the yard by the hose full of water for quick load!!<br/>
<br/>
Cardboard boxes set up to kids can hide behind or obstacle would also work great for the little war!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844272915">If you have a minecraft party (or not), you could make an Angry Bird game by setting up cardboard boxes and then throwing either balls or those stuffed Angry Birds at them to knock them down.  Could also stick some little stuffed animals (to take the place of the piggies) in or on some of the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
My 4 yr old son and I play this upstairs as it is a good way to direct his enjoyment of throwing and knocking things down!  <br/>
