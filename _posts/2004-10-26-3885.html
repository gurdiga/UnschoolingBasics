<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115234577">&quot;I need your advice/suggestions.  I&#39;m wondering how you balance <br/>
reading these <br/>
lists & interacting w/your children?  I&#39;ve already gone on the <br/>
digest versions <br/>
<br/>
and pared down to just the bare bones, &#39;most valuable&#39; ones to me <br/>
(ShineWithUnschooling, UnschoolingBasics, AlwaysUnschooled), but I <br/>
am still not <br/>
doing a <br/>
good job balancing reading/responding to them w/ my daughter needing <br/>
time w/me. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say cut back more.<br/>
If you go &quot;no mail&quot;, you&#39;re still a member, but you can choose to <br/>
ignore the list for several days if need be.<br/>
I just joined Anne&#39;s &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; list this month but <br/>
found it WAY too busy for my life. I just went &quot;no mail&quot; there too.<br/>
<br/>
The only lists I&#39;m getting email from, are this one, <br/>
my &quot;imaginationtribe&quot; and my local list which is not very active.<br/>
I just can&#39;t keep my time online to a minimum any other way...as <br/>
much as I love chatting with everyone, the swirling, bubbly life <br/>
around me is far more important.<br/>

I missed most of this thread as I was on vacation, but wanted to say that  I <br/>
have done the same thing and have found it very helpful.  The Highlights  list <br/>
is great, you miss all the little chat but catch the insightful, thought  <br/>
provoking posts.  I have a hard time keeping up with lists as well.  I  have had <br/>
to decide for myself which lists provide me with the positive energy I  need.  <br/>
Which lists are truly helpful to me and my  family? <br/>

<br/>
It has gotten busy...and it goes in spurts, also.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, the conversations have been SO interesting, so that inspires everyone to post...<br/>
<br/>
AND connecting with other unschooling parents of non-typical children is just not a priority in your life at this time, therefore you don&#39;t feel the *need* to be there.<br/>
<br/>
So it is exactly what everyone has been saying ~ which lists *bless* your life and your unschooling and your children?...<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm....no, it&#39;s not a priority, but I do enjoy it. I think the list <br/>
came at a moment when I really needed to hear some affirmation <br/>
though...so that was wonderful for me.<br/>
I just can&#39;t be on any list that is generating 3 digests and more <br/>
per day, don&#39;t have time for it. Even skimming I find it too <br/>
overwhelming, and there&#39;s truly great stuff so I am compelled to <br/>
respond.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better for me to cut way back....not out of disinterest, but <br/>
out of necessity.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling Highlights is where I occasionally send really insightful <br/>
great posts. I don&#39;t send many, because I want that list to be <br/>
extremely low volume. If somebody sees a post on unschoolingdiscussion <br/>
or unschooling basics that they think is really wonderful, I appreciate <br/>
it if they point it out to me, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think of the list as for people who just want an occasional little <br/>
burst of unschooling support - or for those dads who aren&#39;t all that <br/>
interested in reading hours of discussion, but are willing to read an <br/>
occasional email.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can add up, over time, to a lot of input.<br/>

There is no discussion on the list - just the few posts that I send to <br/>
it.<br/>
