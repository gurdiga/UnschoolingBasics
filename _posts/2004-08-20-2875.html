<div id="ygrps-yiv-923492086">Hi guys,<br/>
  Wow, I sure didn&#39;t realize that we had a Dr on board here, how <br/>
cool!  Still a book I intend to get and read!<br/>
  Anyway, alittle update here. This is the first year we have not <br/>
started ps for my ds11.  And it was so exciting not to have to worry <br/>
about buying all that stuff for school, let alone having to let my <br/>
kids go when time.  This is what we were both feeling.  Then it hit.  <br/>
1st me, then him.  A feeling of being left behind hearing about <br/>
school starting and everyone out shopping and people that don&#39;t know <br/>
us asking, are you excited?!  And with him, just that general <br/>
depression that he had to leave all his friends when he left school. <br/>
We live in a rual area, with only one kid on our block.  And I did <br/>
try to get him to set up a weekend with a friend or two, but it was <br/>
such a busy, and SHORT summer!  <br/>
  Anyway, does anyone have any words of wisdom on this?  I&#39;ve told <br/>
Kaleb that he is more then welcome to invite anyone over, even though <br/>
they are in school, they can still come on the weekends.  He seemed <br/>
happy with that, then we ran into one of his old buddies while we <br/>
were out and it started it up again.  This time it lasted just a day <br/>
or two, but i&#39;m not sure how to help him.  Or do I need to unless he <br/>
asks?  <br/>
Thanks all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125255952">Hi Syndi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here, but thought I might be able to help out a little bit.  All the <br/>
emotions you and your son are experieincing are completely normal.  There is a <br/>
time period right after leaving the school environment known as <br/>
&#39;deschooling&#39;.  It&#39;s just a period of readjustment. <br/>
<br/>
My family lives very rural and have no neighbors.  What has worked for us is <br/>
getting the girls involved in something they have an interest in.  What does <br/>
your son enjoy doing?  Maybe there is someplace he can volunteer.  My dd/12.5 <br/>
loves horses and animals in general.  She is volunteering with a local horse <br/>
rescue group.  My other dd/4.5 will be joining gymnastics this Fall.  Through <br/>
these and many other activities, they have come to meet friends.  They have a <br/>
small group that they hang out with on a fairly consistent basis. But they also <br/>
have many interests that they pursue on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
He may feel &#39;bored&#39; and need some support in helping him figure out what he <br/>
wants to pursue. Another &#39;out of the house&#39; activity we do often, is go to the <br/>
State Park --- the naturalist there is always doing some really cool workshop. <br/>
 My girls love anything having to do with critters or bugs! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll work out, I promise -- it&#39;s all good! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
All my best,<br/>
Helen (DE, USA)<br/>
<br/>
p.s.--If you live near a beach, September is the best month for playing! ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Thanks for your advice!  Part of our (and its all of us) is that we <br/>
love to stay home!  I do intend to get my youngest ds 6 enrolled in <br/>
karate class&#39;s soon, but his older brother is just not into large <br/>
groups.  What i&#39;m hoping to find is an instructor with a smallish <br/>
class.  I&#39;ve spotted one on our local tv who seems very kind, and <br/>
thats exactly what ds11 needs.  <br/>
  Ohhhhhh, a beach, that would be great!  We smack dab in the middle <br/>
of the US (almost).<br/>
Thanks<br/>
