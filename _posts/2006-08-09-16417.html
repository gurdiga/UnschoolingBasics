Wow...I perused her site earlier but missed that link before.  Thanks.  <br/>
It reads wonderfully but is it more info than the state requires?  <br/>
Whether I include it on the NOI or not I&#39;m going to use it as a model <br/>
for my own use for the years goals.  I love making lists and being <br/>
organized so this year will be a challenge for me.  I&#39;ll miss my lesson <br/>
plans ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And thanks again Deb for your suggestion...I like your wording.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can make all the lists and organization that you want.  Just<br/>
realize that your children may not follow them  :)  I&#39;m a list maker<br/>
myself and like to make lists.  Keeps me organized and reminds me of<br/>
the things that I am supposed to do.  Lists are fun.   My kids don&#39;t<br/>
work well with lists (well, I prefer to think they haven&#39;t foudn the<br/>
joy in lists yet LOL!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534770800">I like what you say Michelle, lists are great! Some people don&#39;t need  <br/>
them or want them. Some people find it distracting and some find it  <br/>
insulting to be provided with the details of what &#39;should&#39; be done.<br/>
<br/>
For more concrete examples, I make lists of what I like to see done  <br/>
by the end of the day. It helps me keep on track. We have the added  <br/>
bonus that the kids like to see it and see how they can help me. Josh  <br/>
requested his own list several years ago, for cleaning his room. He  <br/>
wanted it clean but honestly had no idea how to get from A to B. So  <br/>
we sat together, talked about what usually entails a clean room, what  <br/>
was important to him (stuff put away where toddlers couldn&#39;t destroy  <br/>
it), what was important to me (no leftover snacks or dirty plates, no  <br/>
choke hazards) and then wrote down what should happen. It&#39;s a tool,  <br/>
he can use it or not. I can use it or not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done similar things for the younger kids, even made them with  <br/>
pictures from trainland.tripod.com. As you said, just realized that  <br/>
your kids may not follow them. It might be a week or two when they  <br/>
don&#39;t even look at them (they&#39;re taped up all over the house &lt;the  <br/>
lists, not the kids&gt; )but when they want them they are available. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493372382">Ok,  I&#39;ve already started compiling lists of my yearly goals for them <br/>
(my own, that is, and not a state course of study) and creating a chart <br/>
where I can record skills they are learning as they happen and what <br/>
subject the skills fall under so when portfolio time comes around I&#39;ll <br/>
have something to work with.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be list-challenged <br/>
anymore with unschooling ;-)   Plus there are always grocery lists, life <br/>
goals, to do lists, etc...long live the lists!!<br/>
