<div id="ygrps-yiv-465420570">Hi.  I&#39;m new to homeschooling.  I have a 8yr old dd who we just <br/>
pulled from 3rd grade PS.  We also have an 11yr old DS who wants to <br/>
stay in PS.  I didn&#39;t choose unschooling because it is what I wanted <br/>
to do.  Our dd has Selective Mutism, an anxiety disorder.  She was <br/>
having a really bad year and being mis-treated at school.  She came <br/>
home with bruises.  So we decided to homeschool to protect her. She <br/>
chose unschooling because PS was such a horrible experience for her <br/>
that if you put anything in front of her that even slightly <br/>
resembles PS work she just shuts down.  I know this is what she <br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been home two weeks now and mostly its been good.  Yesterday <br/>
though was a bad day.  My dh runs his own business and needed some <br/>
supplys. I wanted to start Christmas shopping.  I was bored.  My <br/>
sister invited us to go shopping with her.  I asked dd if she wanted <br/>
to do that, saying we could look for some supplys for a project we <br/>
were planning togeather. She said yes.  We get to the store to get <br/>
dh&#39;s supplies and dd asked for a new halloween costume.  I said no <br/>
because I&#39;d already bought her a new costume this yr that she picked <br/>
out and wore at the &quot;halloween camping weekend&quot; we went to in Sept.  <br/>
In Sept I told her I didn&#39;t want to spend $ on a pre-made costume <br/>
because they are expensive but so cheaply made.  She came up with a <br/>
costume idea to make but when we got to the store she changed her <br/>
mind about it and asked for a pre-made costume.  I said ok.  She <br/>
took forever to decide on one because she kept changing her mind <br/>
(decisions are hard for her because of her anxiety disorder).  She <br/>
ended up loving what she got and wore it a lot.  So back to <br/>
yesterday....I said no I wasn&#39;t buying her a second one. I told her <br/>
we didn&#39;t have money for that because we needed to get gloves, <br/>
boots, & hats, our project & Christmas presents. She was angry with <br/>
me and then refuse to walk with us through the store.  I tried <br/>
cheering her up and my sister did too.  I tried explaining to her <br/>
and telling her lets just get his boring stuff done & then we&#39;ll get <br/>
lunch, you can pick where, and we&#39;ll look for our fun stuff for the <br/>
project, ect, ect.  She wouldn&#39;t budge or talk.  So I left our cart <br/>
and took her to the car.  She wrote I hate you on her pants.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like she thinks things will make her happy but they don&#39;t.  <br/>
She asks me to buy her something every time we go to the store but <br/>
the majority of the time she doesn&#39;t touch it again when we get <br/>
home.  (the costume from sept was an exception).  I feel like she <br/>
isn&#39;t grateful for all she has and worry I&#39;m raising a matrialistic <br/>
person.  She told me she doen&#39;t get joy form giving, only <br/>
recieving.  How do I turn this around?  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of allowance maybe.  I don&#39;t know.  My sister gives <br/>
her kids allowance but makes them do housework for it then dictates <br/>
how & when they spend it.  I definately don&#39;t want to do that. <br/>
<br/>
Ok.  Take it easy on me.  We are adjusting to this new life style <br/>
and I have a lot to learn.  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps having her own money would help with this as long as she knows<br/>
that she has control over that money.  She&#39;s getting to that age where<br/>
she wants &quot;cool stuff&quot; and if she had the freedom to do that for<br/>
herself she might see things differently.  I think that my oldest<br/>
child was about the same age as your daughter when she told me once<br/>
that she hated her siblings&#39; birthdays because they got something and<br/>
she didn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t fair that she had to wait until November every<br/>
year for her birthday when their birthdays were earlier in the year<br/>
and Daddy doesn&#39;t heve have to wait but 23 days each year for his<br/>
birthday.  She couldn&#39;t see that everyone has to wait 365 days from<br/>
birthday to birthday.  Now she delights in her siblings&#39; birthdays and<br/>
enjoys planning their presents and surprises.  She talks says things<br/>
like, &quot;Oh Keon would LOVE this for his birthday&quot; or &quot;This would be so<br/>
cool to give Mary Elayne for Yule!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I have to do with my son when we go out shopping is to<br/>
state what it is we are shopping for.  That this is all we can get<br/>
today.  It really lessens the &quot;I wants&quot; plus he has his own money and<br/>
if he truly wants something he knows he can buy it.  He has the<br/>
control to get it if he really wants.  I think it helps him with<br/>
decision making on spending.  &quot;Is this something that I would be<br/>
willing to spend my money on?  If not then perhaps it isn&#39;t something<br/>
that mom would spend her money on either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the more freedoms your daughter has the easier things will be<br/>
for her.  BTW, I have a child who also has anxieties that are<br/>
portrayed by selective muteness.  She&#39;s been known not to talk for<br/>
days.  She&#39;s 11 now we have fewer and fewer days where this is an<br/>
issue.  Sometimes she just can&#39;t express what is causing her<br/>
anxieities.  Although knowing that mom can try to fix something if she<br/>
understands it has really helped.  Building that trust took several<br/>
years.  She feels her emotions physically.  She had an incident a<br/>
while back and two days afterwards she told me, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to<br/>
explain how I feel.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m being pushed in from two different<br/>
sides and being squished.&quot;  I&#39;ve learned to ask her how she feels<br/>
physically, not emotionally.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603627392">Sounds like a lot of power struggling. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s wanting  <br/>
stuff to be happy, she wanting you to buy it to see if you still  <br/>
will. As well, she&#39;s still learning that stuff doesn&#39;t make her  <br/>
happy, and if *you* are the one restricting it, then she perceives  <br/>
you as the one bringing her unhappiness, not the item for not living  <br/>
up to her expectations. And no, she probably isn&#39;t &#39;grateful&#39; as you  <br/>
want her to feel, because she&#39;s only eight.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on the money issue, we do our big shopping once a week, and I  <br/>
usually give my older kids enough to buy a soda, some candy and one  <br/>
little thing. They can choose to spend it on whatever they want, or  <br/>
not spend it at all. The younger ones don&#39;t get a $5 bill, but they  <br/>
have the opportunity to pick stuff out.  I figure $20 a week is  <br/>
cheaper than our copay on counseling ;-)  If we go to the store for a  <br/>
little errand, I try to give them at least a quarter for the machine.  <br/>
My kids are lucky, I think, in that they are very much involved in  <br/>
the running of our home, so they know that our money is limited and  <br/>
associated to certain bills and esp medical since we have so many  <br/>
with disabilities. So they have lots of practice with me apologizing  <br/>
sincerely and saying that I see that they really like such-n-so, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not possible to get at this time.<br/>

I pulled these out in order but without all the extra stuff. Does it <br/>
look any different to you with out all the fluff?<br/>

She needed to tell you. AGain---communicating.<br/>

Have you asked her how she feels?<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what little kids DO!<br/>
<br/>
Before we&#39;d go (this is a used to be---mine are older. But when they <br/>
were---probably 3-8), I&#39;d discuss with them what we *needed* to buy. I <br/>
would let them know whether had extra for something special for them. <br/>
Halloween costumes have *always* been a huge draw. Who can resist??? <br/>
&lt;g&gt; Before we go, though, we&#39;d discuss what was needed and what extras <br/>
we could handle.<br/>
<br/>
If he saw a fun costume, we would try it on, look at the workmanship, <br/>
fantasize about next year, get ideas about what would go with what. <br/>
Make silly costum combinations---like a dress-up party on aisle 7! We&#39;d <br/>
hang them all up and make plans for next year. With Cameron, I did this <br/>
weekly! &lt;g&gt; Party City and Walmart hated to see us walk in! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Do *you* remember being eight? Were you grteful? Ask your mom. Did you <br/>
not want everything you saw?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
She told me she doen&#39;t get joy form giving, only<br/>
recieving.  How do I turn this around?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
By giving her what she needs. By giving *others* what they need. <br/>
Modeling.<br/>
<br/>
Time and patience help a LOT!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only eight. Do you expect this to be a life-long issue?<br/>
<br/>
Well, you could *make* it a life-long issue. Many parents DO!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of allowance maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How much?<br/>
<br/>
It needs to be enough that she can actually BUY something. Or save up <br/>
quickly enough that she doesn&#39;t have to wait six months to buy a Barbie.<br/>
