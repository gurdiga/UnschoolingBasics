<div id="ygrps-yiv-234710053">I have a basic newbie type question: I have a 13 yo who wants to stay up later and later..now it&#39;s up to 3:00 am. I also have a 7yo who doesn&#39;t sleep much later than 7:00 am, and a very active child whose schedule is right in the middle of these. I am a part-time ER doc ( 6 shifts per month, each 24 hours). I am a single  parent (no other income), and I&#39;m nearly 47, so maybe my sleep need is creeping up some. Here is the problem: My 13yo ds goes to bed 4 to 6 hours before my 7yo ds gets up. I have no adult private time to think, read, pay bills, etc. When any of the kids has a chance to be with me (private mom time they call it) they want it and I am glad!  But I am starting to wear out.  Should I wait this out? Try to tell the 13yo that if he wants to stay up that late he&#39;ll have to sometimes understand that I can&#39;t sit with him, sometimes I&#39;ll have to do something else. He does try to keep me awake but seems to mostly have trouble with not sitting beside me if I am<br/>
 already awake.  The problem isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t want to be with them...just that I am wearing out. I have been sorely tempted to be sure the 13yo goes to bed at midnight or 1:00 am instead.  Also, if he does any video games or TV that late at night, no matter the topic, he can&#39;t sleep for hours...he actually isn&#39;t happy with that. And during the day we just don&#39;t see him until afternoon.  I think he is trying to get some psychological space, too...again, how do I meet his needs AND mine? I can&#39;t spend my days as a sleepy zombie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133181263">Ask for his input--yes! See if he has other ideas--yes! It is hard to think when tired and I am still trying to shake my training from my marriage that when I present my needs I will get no help. That&#39;s not the kids fault but can reduce my creativity at times.----- Original Message ----<br/>

   I have a basic newbie type question:<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, you are so funny! That last post was SO on the money!<br/>
<br/>
But I know what a lack of sleep can do to a person---that&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
used as torture!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have a 13 yo who wants to stay up later<br/>
and later..now it&#39;s up to 3:00 am. I also have a 7yo who doesn&#39;t sleep <br/>
much<br/>
later than 7:00 am, and a very active child whose schedule is right in <br/>
the<br/>
middle of these. I am a part-time ER doc ( 6 shifts per month, each 24 <br/>
hours). I<br/>
am a single  parent (no other income), and I&#39;m nearly 47, so maybe my <br/>
sleep need<br/>
is creeping up some. Here is the problem: My 13yo ds goes to bed 4 to 6 <br/>
hours<br/>
before my 7yo ds gets up. I have no adult private time to think, read, <br/>
pay<br/>
bills, etc. When any of the kids has a chance to be with me (private <br/>
mom time<br/>

out.<br/>

They should all be told how tired you are! I bet they would be willing <br/>
to help work towards a solution. Kids can be very creative! They want a <br/>
happy, healthy family too.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a friend who could take them both one day a week so that <br/>
you could catch up on sleep or get things done?<br/>
<br/>
As far as his (13 yo) having a hard time sleeping after playing, I&#39;d <br/>
suggest the same things we say to parents of toddlers: he could make <br/>
his room &quot;sleep ready&quot;---dim the lights, spray lavendar around, drink a <br/>
warm drink, maybe take a warm bath, listen to quiet music or watch a <br/>
boring movie (golf or bowling with the sound down does it for me! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
It&#39;s hard to shut our brains down with bright lights---and TV, the <br/>
computer screen, and video games can make it seem like daytime 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. Sleep deprivation SUCKS!<br/>
