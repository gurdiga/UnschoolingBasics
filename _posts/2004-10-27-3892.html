I say cut back more.<br/>
If you go &quot;no mail&quot;, you&#39;re still a member, but you can choose to <br/>
ignore the list for several days if need be.<br/>
I just joined Anne&#39;s &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; list this month but <br/>
found it WAY too busy for my life. I just went &quot;no mail&quot; there too.<br/>
<br/>
The only lists I&#39;m getting email from, are this one, <br/>
my &quot;imaginationtribe&quot; and my local list which is not very active.<br/>
I just can&#39;t keep my time online to a minimum any other way...as <br/>
much as I love chatting with everyone, the swirling, bubbly life <br/>
around me is far more important.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is a good idea, Ren!  Problem is deciding which list I&#39;m getting <br/>
the most from, keeping that one and going on no mail w/the others :)  It&#39;s hard <br/>
to CHOOSE...they are all so inspiring!  And then there&#39;s the problem with <br/>
learning about &#39;new&#39; lists that sound like ones I&#39;d enjoy and/or learn from; like <br/>
the HSfor Kerry list someone recently mentioned (to feed my interest in <br/>
politics) and the one you just mentioned.... &#39;imaginationtribe&#39;...hmmm, makes me <br/>
want to check this out, too).  <br/>
<br/>
I thin what draws me to these lists is that I can find and connect w/a <br/>
&#39;like-minded community&#39;...something severely lacking in my real life in somewhat <br/>
rural Louisiana.<br/>
<br/>
But BALANCE...is a key and what I need to focus on right now ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your advice!<br/>
