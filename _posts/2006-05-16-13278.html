<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180687265">Wow,<br/>
<br/>
I just opened a big ole can of worms didn&#39;t I?  Well it seems that we<br/>
all have our convictions on what is beneficial or worthwhile.  I am<br/>
just lurking on the edge of unschooling, while I continue mulling over<br/>
issues such as this.<br/>
<br/>
I limit my children&#39;s exposure to certain topics for a couple of reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1.  A lot of what is considered normal on TV is forbidden (to watch or<br/>
do) in our religion.  I watched a close relative allow their children<br/>
to watch mainstream TV without supervision or restriction and I see<br/>
what the results have been.  I want to limit the possibility of them<br/>
becoming numb to certain images that are normal on TV and forbidden<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
2.  My kids are gifted, my son is probably profoundly gifted, which<br/>
means that he can understand everything he sees but he lacks the<br/>
maturity to process it emotionally.  This was proven when we watched a<br/>
show on a genius sperm bank (I did not explain anything).  A few weeks<br/>
later, my daughter asked some question about having a baby and I told<br/>
her (because she was 5) that she had to be married first.  My son<br/>
responded that no she didn&#39;t, she could use the sperm bank.  There you<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t intend to keep them locked up and naive about the<br/>
realities of life, I would just prefer to limit their prominence at<br/>
this point.  They are only 6 and 8.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;pure entertainment&quot;, I guess you are right.  Even pure<br/>
entertainment has much value.  I guess I am looking at the couch<br/>
potato persona that accompanies these kinds of days.  That is what<br/>
bugs me.  I know when I am engaged with them, the TV doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
As for the message of creativity is bad because it is messy - hey we<br/>
all have our faults right?  At least I&#39;m owning up to mine and giving<br/>
them an option.  I am moving forward there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719090695">I am new to unschooling and choose to unschool because it is what fits my children and me the best but a reason above all of that is that I want my children to be able to think for themselves and whatever they choose to learn about they need to be able to make a choice of they agree with it and disagree with it.  I am a reader so when I heard a panel of parents and then a second panel of children speak on unschooling I began my research and at the same time because of my and my husband faith and believe in the bible I had to find the fit for me where I did not feel that my convictions and beliefs were not compromised.  So again I was on a search spiritually this time to see how I could unschool and be true to my beliiefs and what I found out is that when my husband and I choose to follow the path spiritually it was our choice but we were able to make that choice based on what we saw in others at our church what we heard read and studied and that is what I want my children<br/>
 to be able to do so as it realtes to T.V. when my children watch things that I may not agree with or hear things or learn things that go against our beliefs It is an opportunity for me to have a conversation with them let them know what their oarents believe ands why and then let them know that they to have ot make a choice of lwhat they want to believe we talk about how seeing that or hearing that makes them feel and it becomes one of the best opportunity for me to share with my children that a book or  curriculum never could.  My children are 5, 7 and 8 I don&#39;t want to not say that because sometimes it is hard when you read a post and try to relate without all the information.  <br/>

than just unrestricted television.  And I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame<br/>
television for what happened to their children. Their children could have<br/>
still had the same outcome even without television.  I don&#39;t think that my<br/>
children have become &quot;numb&quot; to anything in life.  They are still saddened by<br/>
someone dying and blush when they see people making out in public despite<br/>
seeing mass mayhem and makeout scenes on television.  If you have religious<br/>
issues with what is on television, then perhaps you could &quot;parental control&quot;<br/>
them so that they aren&#39;t viewable to anyone.  Seems as though if they are<br/>
forbidden to your children they should also be forbidden to you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
All children are gifted. Some just open their presents sooner than others.<br/>
<br/>
This was proven when we watched a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; show on a genius sperm bank (I did not explain anything).  A few weeks<br/>

&gt; responded that no she didn&#39;t, she could use the sperm bank.  There you<br/>
&gt; go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Well, you did give her false information.  You associated having a baby<br/>
with being married when that isn&#39;t factually true.  Your child called your<br/>
bluff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t intend to keep them locked up and naive about the<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I stated in a previous post, most likely at 6 and 8 years old your<br/>
children aren&#39;t interested in much of what you feel is innapropriate and if<br/>
they are then you need to figure out why and fill that curiosity rather than<br/>
squash it.<br/>

I used to be a natural childbirth educator and still show my birth video to friends who I educate about birth now.  It is nothing for my sons to see a woman giving birth.  It is a part of what I do and it has never been a big deal because both have seen birthing videos since they were infants.

Being honest with our children from day one is what builds<br/>
relationships wherein a child would trust the information they are<br/>
given. Lying to a five year old isn&#39;t going to help her understand any<br/>
future information. Even at five, we need to be perfectly honest with them<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how that was a helpful answer. It&#39;s an outright lie.<br/>
Sex isn&#39;t some dirty thing. It&#39;s natural and we ought to treat it like<br/>
that.<br/>

At what arbitrary age will you just decide they can handle information<br/>
about sex or other topics?  How uncomfortable will THAT be since<br/>
they&#39;ll know you weren&#39;t up front with them from day one??<br/>
<br/>
I have always answered my children&#39;s questions factually from the time<br/>
they asked. I answered simply and if they wanted more info., I gave more.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor wanted to know HOW the sperm got to the egg when he was 6 years<br/>
old! I told him. It&#39;s natural and happens every day, why be<br/>
uncomfortable about it. It&#39;s as natural and normal as the desire to<br/>
eat!!  Just part of what human beings DO.<br/>
<br/>
This  very open way of talking and being honest has led to very<br/>
trusting relatinships in our family. Trevor asked me some pretty<br/>
detailed questions about sex a couple years ago. I really doubt he&#39;d<br/>
been comfortable asking if I&#39;d demonized it or lied to him in the past.<br/>

1.  A lot of what is considered normal on TV is forbidden (to watch or<br/>
do) in our religion.  I watched a close relative allow their children<br/>
to watch mainstream TV without supervision or restriction and I see<br/>
what the results have been.  I want to limit the possibility of them<br/>
becoming numb to certain images that are normal on TV and forbidden<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My children watch mainstream TV without restriction with great results. <br/>
How do you explain this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
2.  My kids are gifted, my son is probably profoundly gifted, which<br/>
means that he can understand everything he sees but he lacks the<br/>
maturity to process it emotionally.  This was proven when we watched a<br/>
show on a genius sperm bank (I did not explain anything).  A few weeks<br/>
later, my daughter asked some question about having a baby and I told<br/>
her (because she was 5) that she had to be married first.  My son<br/>
responded that no she didn&#39;t, she could use the sperm bank.  There you<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll advise you to dump the gifted label.<br/>
But I think your son managed to process it emotionally just fine.<br/>
<br/>
He called you on your bald-faced lie. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have <br/>
enough information. She doesn&#39;t have to use just a sperm bank. All she <br/>
needs to do is to have unprotected (and occasionally, even protected!) <br/>
sex.<br/>
<br/>
You made another mistake by not explaining anything about sperm banks <br/>
in the first place! You were right *there* and didn&#39;t even explain <br/>
anything?????<br/>
<br/>
There you go!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think that a young child won&#39;t remember and take to heart what <br/>
she hears. When I was 7 (my brother was 6), my brother had read a <br/>
button that read, &quot;FUCK.&quot; He asked my mother what that meant. She said, <br/>
after gulping hard---I remember *that* too---&quot;That&#39;s the hippie word <br/>
for having a baby.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, at seven, I thought that, if someone said, &quot;she&#39;s fucked,&quot; she was <br/>
pregnant. I thought that for *years*! Because my MOTHER said so.<br/>
<br/>
Lying puts the brakes on trust. If she finds out you&#39;ve lied about <br/>
*that*, what else could you have lied about?<br/>
<br/>
Not worth it!<br/>

<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t intend to keep them locked up and naive about the<br/>
realities of life, I would just prefer to limit their prominence at<br/>
this point.  They are only 6 and 8.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That may not be your intention. But how do you think they will process <br/>
that information you&#39;ve given them?<br/>
<br/>
They *will* lose trust in you if you keep lying to them.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer NOT to lose that trust!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-.<br/>
<br/>
As for the message of creativity is bad because it is messy - hey we<br/>
all have our faults right?  At least I&#39;m owning up to mine and giving<br/>
them an option.  I am moving forward there!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Better to join them and not put restrictions/stipulations on their <br/>
learning. They *will* learn not to pursue art or cooking or other <br/>
&quot;messy&quot; endeavors if they think it&#39;s too much trouble or inconveneint <br/>
or unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Make their options *better* ones! Make it fun and exciting. BE fun and <br/>
exciting!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re moving forward. &lt;g&gt; But that&#39;s not a &quot;fault&quot;---just a <br/>
not as good a choice/decision! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 Not to worry dear, that was just my answer for the moment because she<br/>
 was fantasizing about becoming a mother. Before she is impregnable,<br/>
 she&#39;ll know the real deal...<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If she&#39;s fantasizing, why NOT give her the correct information? <br/>
Perfect opportunity to build a foundation of trust and respect about an <br/>
often difficult subject.<br/>
<br/>
 Before she&#39;s impregnable???<br/>

 I bet that&#39;s what all the parents of teenage mothers thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278987093">***I just opened a big ole can of worms didn&#39;t I? ***<br/>
<br/>
Not at all.  These are the topics we discuss again and again on<br/>
unschooling lists.   You&#39;re here now to read it and in a month or a week<br/>
someone new will be here and it will come up again.<br/>
<br/>
***I limit my children&#39;s exposure to certain topics for a couple of<br/>
reasons:***<br/>
<br/>
Every person who limits another person thinks they have good reasons for<br/>
doing so.   <br/>
<br/>
Where ever you go your kids are likely to see people interacting in the<br/>
ways people do.  When your kids go to visit friends they will watch what<br/>
their friends watch, they will see their friends parents kissing.    And<br/>
when they discover that there are no immediate religious consequences to<br/>
watching they will wonder about the other &quot;forbidden&quot; things they have<br/>
been kept away from.  It is easy to use rules to keep a six year old from<br/>
watching TV but it is not easy to keep ten or fifteen year old from doing<br/>
anything they want to do.   <br/>
<br/>
***My kids are gifted, my son is probably profoundly gifted, which<br/>
means that he can understand everything he sees but he lacks the<br/>
maturity to process it emotionally. ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gifted&quot; is a label that has done as much harm to kids as the label<br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;lazy.&quot;     <br/>
<br/>
If you care to explore this idea you can read something here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/giftedness">http://sandradodd.com/giftedness</a><br/>
<br/>
My kid is not gifted and he has been deciding what he likes to watch on<br/>
TV his whole life.  He&#39;s usually been able to process what he chose to<br/>
watch and on the rare occasion he wasn&#39;t sure what he&#39;d just seen or<br/>
heard he asked.  One doesn&#39;t have to be gifted to be paying attention.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
The expert in the article you sited, Howard Rowland, says that while any<br/>
kid wants to learn a gifted kid is &quot;self propelled.&quot;  Unschooling has<br/>
shown me and others here that every child is &quot;self propelled.&quot;   The only<br/>
kids who aren&#39;t pursuing their interests are kids who&#39;ve been told their<br/>
interests aren&#39;t as important as academics.  <br/>
<br/>
And what did they say exactly about precociousness?  That a precocious<br/>
child might be ahead of age mates in at least one area?   Again, that&#39;s<br/>
any child.   What they basically said was &quot;gifted&quot; children learn when<br/>
they&#39;re ready.   That&#39;s natural learning and all people learn when<br/>
they&#39;re ready and not one minute before.  <br/>
<br/>
I think when a parent doesn&#39;t really know how to live easily with a kid<br/>
it&#39;s comforting to say that child is gifted because it lets the parent<br/>
off the hook.  They have an excuse for a child they don&#39;t really<br/>
understand and can&#39;t easily control.  <br/>
<br/>
But one beautiful thing about unschooling is that it helps parents change<br/>
the way they see their role in their child&#39;s life so that they understand<br/>
the child doesn&#39;t need to be controlled in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
***...he lacks the<br/>
maturity to process it emotionally.  This was proven when we watched a<br/>
show on a genius sperm bank ***<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
***my daughter asked some question about having a baby and I told<br/>
her (because she was 5) that she had to be married first.  My son<br/>
responded that no she didn&#39;t, she could use the sperm bank. ***<br/>
<br/>
You could have said most girls have to be older for their bodies to be<br/>
ready for a baby.  You lied to her and then you found another reason to<br/>
think your son needs limits when he gave her more honest information. <br/>
That moment didn&#39;t prove his lack of maturity, it proved yours. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we all have our faults.<br/>
<br/>
This list -- as discussion lists as opposed to support lists -- was  <br/>
created by the list owners as a place for people to present their  <br/>
faults and problems and have them filtered through an unschooling lens.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a place to share what will help people move towards  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
While we do all have our faults, all the ones brought to the list are  <br/>
up for discussion. That&#39;s what the list is for. So if you have faults  <br/>
or practices you don&#39;t want examined or don&#39;t want to change yet,  <br/>
it&#39;s best to not write about them.<br/>
<br/>
We have a small window in our own lives to be with our kids. We have  <br/>
*the rest* of our lives to do the things that will get in the way of  <br/>
them reaching their full potential. We can have our houses neat as a  <br/>
pin. We can have nothing but raw vegan foods in the house. We can get  <br/>
rid of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve chosen to have kids. Kids *are* inconvenient. They make  <br/>
messes. They cost money. They impose on our time.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue to see the ways kids inconvenience us and make our  <br/>
life more difficult as burdens to be borne. Or we can find ways to  <br/>
let go of that view point and see the extra effort we will need to  <br/>
put in as a *gift* to them.<br/>
<br/>
Give them the gift of freedom to create! Don&#39;t paint creativity with  <br/>
the brush of drudgery of cleaning up. Do ask them to help but make it  <br/>
a real request and allow them to say no thanks. Look at their joyous  <br/>
faces as they create and keep that in mind as you clean up because  <br/>
you have the ability to give that freedom to them.<br/>
<br/>
Give them the gift of your ear to listen to them. Because if you  <br/>
listen only enough to hear whether they are saying things you want  <br/>
them to think and believe, they *will* find someone else who will say  <br/>
&quot;I understand. Tell me about it.&quot; Because people who want something  <br/>
from others know that&#39;s exactly what other people want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A lot of what is considered normal on TV is forbidden (to watch or<br/>
&gt; do) in our religion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There *are* religious folks who have found ways to give their  <br/>
children the freedom to explore while holding onto strong  <br/>
convictions. I don&#39;t think there are specifically Muslim unschooling  <br/>
lists but there are radical Christian unschooling lists. The ideas  <br/>
will be the same even if the specifics aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But as I said before, we *all* have values we want our children to  <br/>
have. There are a lot of things on TV that I don&#39;t want for my  <br/>
daughter. There are values expressed there that I don&#39;t want her to  <br/>
have. But I know that fear is a big neon sign that points to those  <br/>
values. I know that roadblocks are what make people curious.  <br/>
Regardless of what religion (or lack of religion) we&#39;re practicing,  <br/>
we have all thought deeply about passing on our values. There *are*  <br/>
choices other than &quot;You can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot;. Just because we aren&#39;t  <br/>
saying &quot;No, don&#39;t.&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t care and we aren&#39;t doing  <br/>
*other* things to help our kids. Ask how we&#39;re doing it rather than  <br/>
assuming we are just letting them do whatever! :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but see you practiced lying/misinformation as a way to get out of  <br/>
a situation that made you uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
So when your daughter is older and you ask her where she was all  <br/>
afternoon, it will be okay if she gives you an answer that&#39;s more  <br/>
comfortable for her than the truth? It will be okay if she leads you  <br/>
to believe what *she* wants you to believe rather than telling the  <br/>
truth?<br/>
<br/>
That type of thinking is *so* common to conventional parenting that  <br/>
we don&#39;t even notice the hypocrisy. We come to see our way as right  <br/>
so whatever means we use to achieve it is also right.<br/>
<br/>
But when we turn it around and picture our children using those  <br/>
means, it&#39;s so obviously wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If your child gives you misinformation don&#39;t you trust their  <br/>
understanding less? If they lie, don&#39;t you trust them less? Is that  <br/>
what you want for your relationship with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
One mother several years ago decided her kids were watching too much  <br/>
TV so she pulled the plug and told the kids the TV was broken.<br/>
<br/>
If we use the technique of making someone do and believe as we want  <br/>
them to, what are we modeling for them?  That when someone isn&#39;t  <br/>
doing what you want, the best technique is to be bigger and stronger  <br/>
and make them?<br/>
<br/>
But the other option isn&#39;t letting them loose to do whatever they  <br/>
want! That doesn&#39;t give them the skills to handle disagreements and  <br/>
differences of opinion either. There *are* other options.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise</a><br/>
<br/>
There is an unschooling page at ArabesQ but all the info is general  <br/>
unschooling, not specific to Muslims.<br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t a suggestion to go away. But a source of *more*  <br/>
information. I know many Christian unschoolers get the impression  <br/>
that secular unschoolers don&#39;t understand, many unschoolers of  <br/>
special needs kids and gifted kids get the idea that unschoolers of  <br/>
typical children don&#39;t understand but we do. We have the same general  <br/>
concerns, just not the specific concerns. But the principles of  <br/>
unschooling work whether a child is Jewish or Pagan or Muslim or  <br/>
autistic or reading Proust at 3. It&#39;s all about learning who that  <br/>
child is and nurturing who he is. It&#39;s about living our lives  <br/>
together within the framework of values *and* freedom.<br/>
<br/>
We can share our values without imposing them. We can help them think  <br/>
about the why behind the values we hold. But they can&#39;t truly think  <br/>
and understand if we don&#39;t give them the freedom to think &quot;wrong&quot;  <br/>
thoughts. Art critics don&#39;t come to understand what good art is by  <br/>
memorizing some expert&#39;s idea of what is &quot;good art&quot; They come to  <br/>
understand by being free to embrace all art and come to their own  <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never told my daughter not to shoot someone. (There are plenty  <br/>
of 14 yos who have.) And yet she isn&#39;t a violent person. Why? She&#39;s  <br/>
free to shoot and destroy things in video games -- so she&#39;s had the  <br/>
ability to explore the possibilities -- but she doesn&#39;t in real life.  <br/>
Why? It isn&#39;t because I&#39;ve stepped back and let her do whatever she  <br/>
wants. It&#39;s because she&#39;s grown up in a loving supportive environment  <br/>
that&#39;s given her the freedom to make choices and weigh the good and  <br/>
bad of decisions. And she knows I&#39;m there to help her. She&#39;d be gving  <br/>
up a great deal to turn her back on those values.<br/>
<br/>
If your values feel like chains and restrictions rather than a way to  <br/>
have what is valuable, then kids have the choice of bending beneath  <br/>
the weight of the chains and giving in or of fighting against them  <br/>
and running far far away. While fear and restrictions have kept kids  <br/>
within the confines of Christianity because they fear what lies  <br/>
beyond the boundaries, it has also for many kids firmly entwined the  <br/>
religion with feeling confined and controlled so, to throw off the  <br/>
control, they throw off the religion too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215789941">Exactly my experience of growing up in a fundamental religious home. <br/>
The associations I had and still have of Christianity are so weighty<br/>
and continue to be reminiscent of the abuse of so many Christians I&#39;ve<br/>
known (starting with my family).  My response has been to reject the<br/>
religion.  I don&#39;t want those ties that bind anymore.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I don&#39;t consider myself a Christian.   <br/>
<br/>
The real kicker is it&#39;s possible to raise children who follow rules<br/>
without using principles or carrying any solid values.   I was lucky<br/>
not to have that problem.  Because I resisted the rule orientation I<br/>
grew up under, I looked for something else.  I gathered my ideas from<br/>
all over, mostly reading.  Rules might work as long as there are &quot;well<br/>
travelled roads&quot; and no need for a &quot;compass&quot; to guide to the next<br/>
step.  I&#39;d rather ds formulated a clear set of values (a nice accurate<br/>
compass) while still living with me, free to get messy, make mistakes<br/>
and learn what works, a little at a time, in a relatively safe<br/>
environment.<br/>
