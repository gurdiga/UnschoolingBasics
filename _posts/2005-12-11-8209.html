&gt; Occasionally my daughter (14) and I will have lattes. The espresso in<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; them is stronger than coffee (but doesn&#39;t leave that nasty sour taste<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; that coffee seems to.) She hasn&#39;t shown any interest in regular<br/>

&gt;   Sooo, a lg. coffee(20oz) has @5 times the amount of caffine as a<br/>

&gt;   The sour taste left by coffee has a LOT to do with the roasting<br/>

also sat in a caraf for a while, depending on the day and how busy we<br/>
are, our coffee may sit for hours, by the endof the day it is really<br/>
bitter. Espresso shots are brewed fresh and the process is much faster<br/>
than brewing coffee. Coffee done in a French Press tends to be less<br/>
bitter as well. Oh, and the quality of your water is really important,<br/>
tap water can change the taste and bitterness of your coffee as well.<br/>

The ground espresso  goes into a small metal portafilter which fits directly under the hot water source. When the hot water is pulled, the espresso shot should take 18-24 seconds to complete. And, yes, a good barista will count their shots. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW a mocha is just a regular latte with chocolate syrup added (and maybe a little whipped cream.....yum).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I make a quick sorta mocha here at work - I put a packet of instant <br/>
cocoa into a mug, add a little dab of sugar and a splash of half and <br/>
half or milk, then fill with brewed coffee (regular, decaf, or <br/>
hazelnut, depending on what&#39;s available and what my mood is) instead <br/>
of water - best method I&#39;ve found is to put in just a small amount and <br/>
mix everything then add the rest of the coffee and stir - makes a nice <br/>
frothy head too! But, alas, no whipped cream...<br/>
