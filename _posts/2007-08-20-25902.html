<div id="ygrps-yiv-157300913">My brother is coming in tomorrow to stay with us for 3 weeks. He is very <br/>
into the Assembly of God church. I have no problem with this, but he is <br/>
often times preachy while he is here. The last time he stayed he put his <br/>
hand on each of my kids heads and prayed for them while speaking in tongues <br/>
and such. I&#39;m dreading it. :(<br/>

<br/>
And you let him??? How did your kids feel about that?<br/>
<br/>
I would think when he visits YOUR home, you should feel able to say<br/>
&quot;no thanks bro&quot;....that&#39;s what respect is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could throw in a pagan chant just to see how he reacts.;)<br/>

they&#39;re pretty good at saying what they feel and when.<br/>

ACK, a full scale attack on unschooling! We must prepare for battle!<br/>

if your daughters are OK with him doing this, in your mind, you can<br/>

it all means the same thing.  I try to assign positive intent as much<br/>
as possible - what a gift that your brother cares about your<br/>
daughters!  Now, if there was talk of how they&#39;d be going to hell,<br/>
that would be stickier!  But it would still, more than likely, be<br/>
coming from a place of caring for you, wanting the best for you.  It&#39;s<br/>
just that his idea of best, and your ideas of best, are different.<br/>

Of course, this is seen from the outside - I&#39;m not there to see how it<br/>

Yeah, I think my older boys would have been like &quot;what the heck are<br/>
you doing? Chill out!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve had enough negative experiences with that type of thing,<br/>
it probably colors my reactions. My focus would be letting my brother<br/>
know that he needs to get my children&#39;s permission before doing<br/>
anything like that! I also would make sure my children felt<br/>
comfortable expressing that to their uncle and being an advocate<br/>
should they not be able to speak up.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re ok with it. Fine. But people like that often have issues<br/>
with boundaries or he would have asked them if it was alright in the<br/>
first place. Or asked you. I think it&#39;s important to be an advocate<br/>
that way, especially in your very own home. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t talk about unschooling though. Just smother them with all this<br/>
joy and excitement about the cool things you&#39;ve been doing and they<br/>
won&#39;t have time to question the homeschool thang.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972210641">Last time I ate out with my (stepmom), i did this. Of course, we had  <br/>
been NOT talking for a few months, so when she emailed to ask about  <br/>
going out for dinner, i agreed with the caveat that there would be NO  <br/>
discussions on my parenting, my lifestyle, or our homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I just kept telling my mom all the fun and cool stuff the kids are  <br/>
doing, and she seemed to follow my conditions okay. Just once when it  <br/>
seemed the conversation was turning to our radical nature, I asked  <br/>
how my (step)brother was doing. :-) The fact that he&#39;s 27, living at  <br/>
home, doesn&#39;t help with anything, and is trying to fly under the  <br/>
radar because he has three DUI&#39;s really argues the point that she  <br/>
cannot complain about OUR lifestyle. At least my kids love to help me  <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I think it does help to share all the positive stuff (and never once  <br/>
mention struggles of any sort, I made the mistake of once saying how  <br/>
tired I was...oh, they jump on that! &quot;If you&#39;d put them in school  <br/>
you&#39;d at least get some break&quot;) Grrr. like I&#39;d put my kids in jail to  <br/>
get a break.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457108767">Caren, <br/>
   My FIL frequently tells us we are going to hell... he isn&#39;t amused<br/>
by me asking him to save me a seat! HA!    My girls have completely<br/>
been turned off of organized religion because of him and his extended<br/>
family (you know the type in church everytime the doors are open,<br/>
writing checks for any cause related to a church, but constantly judge<br/>
others, treat everyone around like crap and behave however they&#39;d like<br/>
because I guess they are forgiven! UGH!)     While I commend you for<br/>
having such a calm center and being able to see that things like<br/>
praying for the kids  and even the going to hell comments might be<br/>
coming from a place of caring for my FIL it&#39;s about control... can I<br/>
make you do what I want because I am bigger, louder, the parent etc<br/>
etc.   Nothing this man does is coming from a place other than his<br/>
desire to control everything and everyone around him.   I do think<br/>
that most folks that offer a prayer, or express concern about<br/>
religious training for our children are expressing their concerns from<br/>
a place of love and caring.   I feel much more respected by someone<br/>
who asks if they may pray for us than someone who says &quot;if you prayed<br/>
hard enough or were a good enough Christian your autistic child with a<br/>
genetic syndrome would be healed&quot; like my FIL is fond of doing.   I<br/>
think the next time I will try inserting some of your words in his<br/>
mouth...sort of like subtitles.... hehehehe!   Thanks for the<br/>
different perspective!   <br/>
