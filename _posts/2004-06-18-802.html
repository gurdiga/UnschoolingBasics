<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155649521">This book isn&#39;t specifically a parenting book.  Instead it can be <br/>
applied to every aspect of our lives.  It seems like many of you know <br/>
these principles intuitively, but for those of us who don&#39;t this book <br/>
is clearly written and transforming.  Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

Excerpt from Mindfulness By Ellen J. Langer<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Openness, not only to new information, but to different <br/>
points of view is also an important feature of mindfulness.  For <br/>
years, social psychologists have written about the differences <br/>
between the perspective of an actor and that of an observer.  For <br/>
instance, we are likely to blame circumstances for our own negative <br/>
behavior: `The subway made me late&#39;.  If the very same behavior is <br/>
engaged in by someone else, however, we tend to blame that <br/>
individual: `He is chronically behind schedule.&#39;<br/>
	&quot;Once we become mindfully aware of views other than our own, <br/>
we start to realize that there are as many different views as there <br/>
are different observers.  Such awareness is potentially liberating.  <br/>
For instance, imagine that someone has just told you that you are <br/>
rude.  You thought you were being frank.  If there is only one <br/>
perspective, you can&#39;t be both right.  But with an awareness of many <br/>
perspectives, you could accept that you are both right and <br/>
concentrate on whether your remarks had the effect that you actually <br/>
wanted to produce.  If we cling to our own point of view, we may be <br/>
blind to our impact on others; if we are too vulnerable to other <br/>
people&#39;s definitions of our behavior, we may feel undermined, for <br/>
observers are typically less flattering of us than we are of <br/>
ourselves.  It is easy to see that any single gesture, remark, or act <br/>
between people can have at least two interpretations: spontaneous <br/>
versus impulsive; consistent versus rigid; softhearted versus weak; <br/>
intense versus overemotional; and so on.<br/>
	&quot;This list should not give the impression that for every act <br/>
there are two set, polarized interpretations.  As we said, there are <br/>
potentially as many interpretations as there are observers.  Every <br/>
idea, person or object is potentially simultaneously many things <br/>
depending on the perspective from which it is viewed.  A steer is <br/>
steak to a rancher, a sacred object to a Hindu, and a collections of <br/>
genes and proteins to a molecular biologist.  Nor does being mindful <br/>
mean that we can plan certain defined ways of interacting with others <br/>
that will produce certain outcomes; rather, it means that we remain <br/>
aware that the various possible perspectives will never be exhausted.&quot;</div>
