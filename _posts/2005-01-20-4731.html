<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421559289">Okay, so I have been unschooling for awhile but I am still stuck on <br/>
a few things.  We followed a math curriculum non-consistently for <br/>
about a year and a half, but other than that my kids have been <br/>
learning math as needed.  (Mostly when we play games, cook, or talk <br/>
about money)  My question is this: is the idea to wait to show them <br/>
how to do &quot;computations&quot; (like adding numbers that are more than one <br/>
digit, the concept of multiplication, division, etc.) when they ask <br/>
how to do that kind of stuff...OR... do you show them how to do it <br/>
before they get into a situation where it would be helpful to <br/>
already know it?  My kids get frustrated when we are doing something <br/>
that requires math skills and they don&#39;t know how to do it (like the <br/>
whole concept of multiplication instead of adding) but not <br/>
frustrated enough that they ask &quot;I want to learn how to....&quot;.  I <br/>
have chalked it up to their ages (11 and 8) and that they are just <br/>
not old enough to understand that it is helpful to figure things out <br/>
when you have a mathematical procedure to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Any insight on this?  Thanks!<br/>

Listening to my dd (11.5yo)  solve mathematical situations is facinating and<br/>
definately not the way i would have explained a solution.  She has her own<br/>
way of thinking to figure out how to add multi-digit numbers, subtract,<br/>
multiply and divide.  It has nothing to do with the formal &quot;training&quot; that<br/>
you&#39;d find through conventional worksheets but it works just fine for her.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will learn through their interests.  She has learned to manage numbers<br/>
through money handling, sales of her crafts and budgeting for art classes<br/>
she teaches.  I&#39;ve seen kids learn mathematical thinking skills through lego<br/>
building, computer games, construction projects and baking.<br/>
<br/>
Funny about two months ago my dd put some numbers together and gave me the<br/>
result.  When I asked her how she arrived at that she explained it in terms<br/>
of multiplying by 8&#39;s and then added the remainder....i never never never<br/>
would be able to multiply by 8&#39;s...5&#39;s or 10&#39;s yes...but 8&#39;s - you&#39;ve gotto<br/>
be kidding.  But her mind has figured out a methodology that works for her<br/>
based on her own experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine as her interest in sewing grows she may learn concepts of<br/>
geometry, trignometry and from knitting she may learn algebra.  Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen unschooled kids (teens - of varying ages) sit down and teach<br/>
themselves formal math from curriculum out of their need to create computer<br/>
animation or in one case from the desire to learn it as they have seen their<br/>
peers in school learn. Or because they need to pass a certain test in order<br/>
to go to a technical school they want to attend.  But in these cases it came<br/>
from thier desire...not because some parental authority decided they need<br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522997560">Model it for them - when -you- are calculating cooking times or <br/>
measurements, sales tax or miles per gallon, work it out out loud <br/>
instead of just in your head. When you are playing games, calculate <br/>
scores out loud - okay I&#39;ve got 5 twos so 2 5 times equals 10. If <br/>
you&#39;re getting ready to go somewhere &quot;Hmm it&#39;s 2:15 and we need to <br/>
leave at 2:30 so we have 15 minute&quot;. Not as a &quot;teaching&quot; activity <br/>
compulsively but just open up your thought processes to them a bit <br/>
and when they see the need for something, they&#39;ll have a start on <br/>
how to go about it.</div>

<br/>
Everything else can be done out loud---I think out loud ALL the time (I talk to myself too!). We were at Cape Cod after last year&#39;s conference, and I saw a seagull. Out loud, I said, &quot;I wonder why the gulls up here are darker than the ones down South.&quot; I wasn&#39;t looking for an answer. Just wondering...out loud. We talked about seagulls and climate and sand color and feathers and temperature and other things for 20-25 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this leads to brainstorming about how and why and when. Sometimes my wondering simply floats there in the air. &lt;g&gt; Both are OK. I&#39;ll keep blubbering anyway! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I think she definitely will...she just won&#39;t know it&#39;s called <br/>
anything other than &quot;sewing&quot;.:) Algebra is solving for the unknown. <br/>
We do that all the time in life really, and the mind best prepared <br/>
for the formal aspects of these math forms, is one that has used <br/>
them in natural forms for a long time,just having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I love that these unschooled kids are free to find their own <br/>
methods. It&#39;s really the only way to tailor learning to the <br/>
individual...letting them creatively use their minds the way that <br/>
suits them best.<br/>
In school, I could come up with the answers, but if I didn&#39;t show <br/>
THEIR method, I would get it wrong. ARGH. My mind worked differently <br/>
than the way they were forcing me to &quot;learn&quot;. Such frustration.<br/>
I ended up convinced I was bad at math and really didn&#39;t care. I had <br/>
knots of frustration and anxiety when using numbers. It&#39;s only in <br/>
the last few years that I&#39;ve been able to see math as FUN and <br/>
calculate numbers without my former stress.<br/>
Just another issue unschooling healed.:)<br/>
