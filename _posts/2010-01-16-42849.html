<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056460850">So, given the assumption that children like the current stories because <br/>
they can experience some freedom from limits through the characters in <br/>
the story... what sort of stories do unschooled children write?  In what <br/>
way would the plot be furthered, or the character develop, with their <br/>
parents always there to help them?<br/>
<br/>
Little Bear is actually a good example, maybe.  Sure, mama is sometimes <br/>
gone, and little bear gets into some mischief.  But its always just <br/>
creative play, or misunderstanding, never an attempt to gain authority.  <br/>
And particularly, the one where he keeps changing his clothes to go out <br/>
into the cold, and she keeps supporting him and knitting him new pieces <br/>
of winter outerwear, even though she must know that his &#39;coat of fur&#39; is <br/>
the best snowsuit for him, and in the end he learns that on his own.  <br/>
And she doesn&#39;t say &quot;I told you so&quot; or anything. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Red is Best&quot; - How about that book?  Read it?  I&#39;m thinking about it.  <br/>
I noticed some things while reading it.  The child says that red is <br/>
best, wants only all her red things to use.  You see the parent telling <br/>
her that her red boots aren&#39;t warm enough for winter, her red mittens <br/>
have holes, her red coat isn&#39;t warm enough, etc.   And yet, the little <br/>
girl is wearing all of the red things that aren&#39;t &#39;quite right&#39;, despite <br/>
what the mother said, except for the winter coat, which she is wearing <br/>
the blue one.  So it seems like the mother is wonderful, sharing with <br/>
her child information about choices, and letting child make choices, but <br/>
taking control of one thing that is more important (winter coat during <br/>
cold weather), and letting child experiment with the rest.  Probably not <br/>
a good idea to voice our opinions about every choice our children make <br/>
(every time they choose to wear the red pantyhose with the pink dress), <br/>
but books are often about exaggeration to show a point, and also <br/>
repetition for children who enjoy that.  So, I don&#39;t fault the book for <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
This is really interesting.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if someone were to do a <br/>
review of literature from an unschooling perspective?</div>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the assumption is correct. I think stories meet a  <br/>
biological need to feel personally powerful to triumph over  <br/>
obstacles, not a socially induced need.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is empowering our kids, helping them feel they  <br/>
can tackle problems. We&#39;re supporting and nurturing their growing  <br/>
independence. Why would they write or read stories about needing  <br/>
support?<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn&#39;s stories are similar to stories written by mainstream  <br/>
people. They&#39;re adventure stories. Many of them are team stories, but  <br/>
that&#39;s because she branched out from Pokemon stories where there were  <br/>
several characters working towards a goal.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooled children write stories with supportive mothers or  <br/>
present parents, I suspect it will be a conscious decision because  <br/>
they&#39;re tired of stories with mean or absent parents. (*I* get  <br/>
irritated by stories with conventional power struggles between  <br/>
parents and kids.)<br/>
<br/>
While it would be a refreshing element to a story and it&#39;s great to  <br/>
live lives of nurture and support, they get dull to read about! The  <br/>
story limitations of supportive parents working with their kids on an  <br/>
adventure will become apparent after a few stories! ;-) And why would  <br/>
unschooled kids need the comfort of supportive parents in a book when  <br/>
they have that in real life? They have the same biological drive  <br/>
toward independence that schooled, conventionally parented kids do.  <br/>
Losing the parents in a story might be partly reactionary to control  <br/>
but I think it&#39;s mostly a biological drive toward independence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573924241">My girls enjoy the Septimus Heap series.  The family has two parents and grandparents, along w/ an assortment of ghosts and other adult figures, who have meaningful relationships with the kids.  The kids often end up on adventures of their own, usually w/ the parent&#39;s blessing or because of a turn of events in the book, but the adults do show up periodically in the book to offer support or help.  However, the older kids also help the younger kids in exactly the same way when adults aren&#39;t present.  <br/>
 <br/>
The kids all have followed their own interests and even though the parents some times are concerned for their children&#39;s safety, the parents don&#39;t get in the way of personal choices.  The family relationship is based on respect and love and trust.  <br/>
 <br/>
However, I would suggest that my girls are mainly drawn to these books because they are well written and have a great plot rather than for the above reasons.  That said, my eldest often pointed out the absence of parents in books, or divorce or death as a common theme, when she was around 8.  It did bother her and she wished she could find more books w/ two parents or less unhappiness.  (The Ramona books are another series that has two parents.)  It gave us a great opportunity to discuss why authors might use those elements and if it would be possible to write a book where everything was happy and still have it be an interesting book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365325912">My friend, Lisa Bentley, has started writing a series of chapter books about<br/>
a homeschool family that travels the US in a RV.  Lisa herself is an<br/>

<br/>
So, I guess both kinds of children are looking for the same thing in the <br/>
end, but their reason for looking are different?  A schooled child has <br/>
an urge to be independent, biologically, and also might want <br/>
independence they aren&#39;t allowed in real life.  And an unschooled child <br/>
feels very secure in their ability to make choices in real life, and so <br/>
also enjoy reading about situations where children get to make exciting <br/>
choices and experience independence?  Ok, more clearly, unschooled <br/>
children are given much freedom and choice, but still, age-appropriately <br/>
are not independant, because their parents are always there to help <br/>
them... so they enjoy reading about children acting independently <br/>
without parents around.... its about independence from the need of <br/>
parental help?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think ultimately their reasons are the same. It&#39;s biological  <br/>
instinct to want to feel competent. The schooled, conventionally  <br/>
parented kids have an additional layer on top of that, like the  <br/>
parent voices that keep reminding them they aren&#39;t competent (to make  <br/>
choices, to do what the parents think they should and so on.) When  <br/>
you&#39;re digging this deep for answers, I think control is too vague a  <br/>
term. Control could be a shackle or a cage that operates even when  <br/>
the parent is gone. For kids, control is very often about a parent in  <br/>
effect saying a child isn&#39;t competent to make the right decisions so  <br/>
the parent needs to decide for the child. And that grates against the  <br/>
drive to feel competent and test one&#39;s own always-changing limitations.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell a child, &quot;No, you can&#39;t jump off the slide, that&#39;s too  <br/>
high,&quot; I don&#39;t think a child feels chained down. They feel -- and I&#39;m  <br/>
projecting from my own feelings as a child and my reactions as an  <br/>
adult -- &quot;How do you know? I need to test that out and see. Maybe I  <br/>
can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(A good unschooling approach would be, if you know your child isn&#39;t a  <br/>
great jumper, to start off with some jumps that aren&#39;t quite as high  <br/>
and work up to it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so they enjoy reading about children acting independently<br/>
&gt; without parents around.... its about independence from the need of<br/>
&gt; parental help?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I think it&#39;s need for competence and a movement toward  <br/>
independence rather than a fight against something in their way. It&#39;s  <br/>
biological.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might be looking too much from the parents&#39; point of  <br/>
view. All the work we as parents do is pretty much in the background  <br/>
as far as young kids are concerned. We&#39;re providing what they expect  <br/>
and need so they&#39;re not really consciously aware of 90% of what we  <br/>
do. (And when they do it&#39;s a momentary thing.) The time they most  <br/>
notice us is when we&#39;re in their way or not there when they need us ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re attuned to them, we&#39;re providing the amount of help they  <br/>
need so it&#39;s not going to be a &quot;too much!&quot; or &quot;too little!&quot; alarm on  <br/>
their radar. Sort of like when the furnace is working. It&#39;s not that  <br/>
we don&#39;t appreciate it. It&#39;s that we are hyper aware when it&#39;s not  <br/>
shutting off or not coming on when it should ;-) (Of course there are  <br/>
always some kids whose drive exceeds their ability so it&#39;s not a  <br/>
blanket statement. Lots of kids want to ride bikes before their  <br/>
bodies are ready. Some kids want to be out in the world before  <br/>
they&#39;ve gathered enough experience (or years to be taken seriously).)<br/>

I read because you live those adventures that you normally would not.<br/>
