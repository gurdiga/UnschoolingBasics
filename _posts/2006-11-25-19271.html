<div id="ygrps-yiv-892066418">I dont know whether this is appropriate for this site as it has nothing to do with unschooling. But the subject has come up so I thought I would comment on what I have learned about the issue. If its not appropriate please let me know.<br/>
Cyberstalking is a form of internet harassment that sexual predators use. I would like to believe that unschoolers are immune to it but I doubt it. I have been in the unfortunate position of having witnessed it for myself, and therefore researched it and consulted with the police on it. Apparently every segment of the population, of every age and demographic group have been the victim of some form of cyberstalking and/or internet harassment. Sexual predators have a variety of techniques they use to &quot;get&quot; to children that include stalking (following the child to different sites and chat rooms) intimidation, threatening, gaining confidence, posing as someone they are not, etc. These guys are crafty and they dont just show up in a chat room and say &quot;hey meet me at the mall.&quot; Often they will lurk sites and chatrooms for months and quietly gather information about a child and build a &quot;portfolio&quot; of the child well before they even contact the child. It is not difficult to find informatio<br/>
n on people in cyberspace. Kids have blogs and webpages and cyberpals. They post pictures of their friends on MySpace (or other sites) where the predator can get the email or IM/ICQ screennames of their friends and approach them posing as someone else to get information on the targe child. That is a very common tactic for predators-to get information through other kids. Sexual predators and internet harrassers take time to do what they do. They take time to build relationships, not only with the target child but with other children the target child communicates with in cyberspace. They are capable of gaining so much information about a child that when they make contact, they can choose a method that works on the child. Sometimes its a mild form of intimidation that escalates into a power play. The child gets a mildly insulting IM and  feels indignant rather than threatened and responds by retort to &quot;hold their own&quot; in the conversation and therefore slips right into the power play t<br/>
he predator is seeking. Another tactic is to work to tear down the self-esteem of kids to make them vulnerable.  Sometimes they use the information thay have gained to pose as someone the childs age, and they begin to &quot;mirror&quot; the child&#39;s vocabulary and emotional responses. Through thier internet surveillance activities they learn about something the child likes, and they use it to become someone the child thinks &quot;understands me and is SO much like me!&quot; They can nurture these relationships for a long time before they venture into anything that appears inappropriate. Other times they never reveal their true age and identity and when they finally set up a meeting, the child is met with a grown adult who sexually assaults them. There are also the &quot;harassers,&quot; who have no intention of ever meeting a child, they just send threatening instant messages like this one sent to my friend&#39;s 12 y/o daughter:  &quot;Hey ugly bitch, you are so ugly you deserve to be SHOT. I know because I know where y<br/>
ou live and I&#39;ve seen you. You&#39;d better suck my cock when I come over. And then swallow and I&#39;ll let you go.&quot; There are dangerous people trolling the internet. Blocking this guy&#39;s screenname did nothing. He just created a new one and showed up again. This kind of harassment is terrifying to anyone and even a kid who would never meet up in real life with anyone they met in cyberspace can be terrified by it.   Kathryn<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Useful information, to be sure. My stepson has been enjoying lurking <br/>
over my shoulder (he gets it from his dad!) and reading posts, and <br/>
he was fascinated: &quot;Why the heck would an Adult want to have sex <br/>
with a Kid?&quot; Thanks for providing me with an opportunity to chat <br/>
with him on the subject! <br/>
<br/>
At his mom&#39;s home his computer use has been somewhat limited - and <br/>
obviously she hasn&#39;t had a meaningful conversation with him on the <br/>
subject. That&#39;s disturbing to me - and I can&#39;t help but wonder how <br/>
many other young teens are in the same boat. Its no wonder kids are <br/>
running into problematic situations if no-one is telling them <br/>
Anything.<br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s gf is in a similar-but-different situation, she&#39;s been <br/>
*told* &quot;you can&#39;t go on Myspace b/c there are evil people there <br/>
waiting to molest children&quot;. Since she knows a dozen kids IRL who <br/>
have Myspace accounts, she doesn&#39;t believe a word of it. Mom&#39;s a <br/>
nutcase, doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about. That may be even <br/>
worse than not telling a kid anything at all - now there&#39;s no way <br/>
this girl will ever tell her mom if she gets into Any kind of <br/>
sexually threatening situation. <br/>
<br/>
Its so easy to undermine trust and so hard to build it back. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sometimes its a mild form of intimidation that escalates into a <br/>
&gt;power play<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So much traditional parenting revolves around this very idea: hold <br/>
hands or you&#39;ll get hit by a car, brush your teeth or you&#39;ll lose <br/>
them, go to school or you&#39;ll be a dummy. Its no wonder kids are <br/>
vulnerable to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another tactic is to work to tear down the self-esteem of kids to <br/>
&gt;make them vulnerable. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one worries me most, b/c Ray&#39;s had his self-esteem slashed to <br/>
ribbons Already. Last night we were talking about....what the heck <br/>
was it...oh, I know! our neighbor Mir was over and made a pun about <br/>
Ray&#39;s name - Rayan//rayon. I could tell Ray was feeling a little <br/>
defensive about being compared to a piece of fabric so I <br/>
deliberately made a comment along the lines of &quot;well, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want you for a table-cloth, but I also don&#39;t thing a piece of fabric <br/>
is nearly as fun and interesting to talk to as you are&quot;. He was <br/>
flabergasted.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not going to foster his self-esteem to limit his computer use <br/>
or tell him he&#39;s &quot;too young to know better&quot; though. Nor will it <br/>
improve our communication. <br/>
<br/>
Oops, now my 5yr old is telling me its time to limit *my* computer <br/>
use ;) <br/>
