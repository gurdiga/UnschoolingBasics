<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208704829">So what are the basics?<br/>
<br/>
In our family we budget in mortgages, necessary bills (gas, water, car ins),<br/>
then the communal bills (stuff we all want life Internet and cable) and of<br/>
course food. We have some extras that bring us joy, Netflix, WoW, cell<br/>
phones, etc. We save for Unschooling trips because they are so important to<br/>
us (Malila paid for half of Live and Learn because it was THAT important to<br/>
her and we were really short on money). We all have a vision board and we<br/>
have a family vision board. We buy what we can or obtain it from other<br/>
resources (free clothing store, freecycle, thrift store, etc) We are really<br/>
creative :-) When we have money the kids get any lessons they want and<br/>
memberships to the places we love to go.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that we are lacking this year is lessons (they want martial<br/>
arts and gymnastics) because we are that tight right now. But they know that<br/>
if/when we do have it it will be paid for by us.<br/>
<br/>
We get most of our clothing free but some at the thrift store or yard sales.<br/>
We get a lot of toys/games/books at yard sales/freecycle/paperback swap etc.<br/>
We put it out to the universe and it usually comes. being poor doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to feel like poverty.<br/>
<br/>
We go to as many Unschooling gatherings as possible. I find that just saying<br/>
we are going makes it happen :-) When I say i can&#39;t afford something it just<br/>
doesn&#39;t come. I am just not open. SO I say we are going and we find a way.<br/>
<br/>
I consider all these things to be basics.<br/>
<br/>
My kids get their allowance and occasional money from relatives. It is<br/>
theirs to spend. Anyway they want. It isn&#39;t to get things I won&#39;t buy them.<br/>
It is to get them things I can&#39;t buy them. Or save.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I pay for clothes, food, lessons and/or equipment, trips, and subcriptions<br/>
&gt; (netflix, WoW, gamefly).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we differ somewhat. We pay for basics, and the kids can<br/>
buy above and beyond that if they want.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---but what I listed above I DO consider &quot;the basics.&quot; Clothes, food,<br/>
lessons, equipment, trips, subscriptions---all those are basics here.<br/>
