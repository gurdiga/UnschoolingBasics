<div id="ygrps-yiv-84042976">This wasn&#39;t for Equinox... but when DS1 was quite young, we had<br/>
friends who were very &quot;Waldorf-y&quot;, for lack of a better word. They<br/>
hosted a Martinmas festival - part of that was the kids would carry a<br/>
lighted turnip lantern (easily made by carving a turnip!) through the<br/>
woods. It was very magical, and beautiful. Probably lots of things<br/>
about that are out there if you google &quot;Waldorf festivals&quot;.<br/>
