  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554695778">See, I&#39;m not even calling it bedtime anymore...aaaahhhh...evening flow...although it didn&#39;t feel very flowy last night or tonight and that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing.<br/>
   <br/>
  So...we&#39;ve had 6 nights or so since we went unschooly around here :o).  It appears that the girls have really enjoyed their evenings.  It&#39;s almost like they have this reservation still about what they&#39;re &#39;allowed&#39; to do, and I think they may be a tad confused about being told &#39;yes&#39; so much - relieved, but a little confused.  They ask me alot &#39;mommy, can I _____&#39; like they&#39;re sure I&#39;m going to say no.  The evenings have been really late!  The first night was after 11, then the next was around 10, then the next was around 9, then the last 2 have been 11:15 and 11:30.  I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re not *bagged* by then because their dad and I sure are!  We haven&#39;t been waiting around like I talked about last time, but the last 2 nights seemed to go on forever.<br/>
   <br/>
  This isn&#39;t to say that I haven&#39;t felt the peace of them, we all have felt it and it&#39;s good.  Inspite of being tired I&#39;ve really loved the sweetness and calm of the some of the moments of talking and cuddling and watching them play.  I feel like I&#39;ve experienced major shifts the last few weeks, and...wait for it...perhaps...could I finally be...no...growing up?!?!? :o)<br/>
   <br/>
  My question is about the transition for the girls.  They are all over the map about what they want.  Is this because we&#39;ve told them what they want so far and they&#39;re feeling it out?  Does it smooth out after awhile?  What I&#39;m referring to is in particular choosing where they want to go to sleep and if they&#39;re hungry.  Okay, here&#39;s the scenario from tonight:<br/>
   <br/>
  They are on the couch cuddled with us, sleepy, yawning, then they say &#39;I want to go to sleep in mommy&#39;s bed...or I want to go to sleep in my bed with daddy...or I want to go to sleep in daddy&#39;s bed (same as mommy&#39;s bed &lt;g&gt;) with mommy...etc., you get the picture.  So we toddle on in there, get set up, and then after they&#39;re all set up for that location they&#39;ll change their minds and decide they want to sleep in the other bed with the other parent, or they&#39;ll decide they aren&#39;t ready to go to sleep after all and say &#39;I want something from the fridge&#39;.We literally followed them around for 2 hours doing this last night and tonight, and I had to stay really present, remember to breathe *alot*, and remind myself *alot* that they are just learning to run their own show.<br/>
   <br/>
  Are we on track with this??  Mostly I am asking about the all-over-the-place quality of their evenings this week, and will they become more certain of what they want regarding bedtime?  And also I&#39;m trying to be okay with my 3 year olds going to bed close to midnight.  So I need some feedback, some reassurance that all is well.  Actually I have repeated &quot;All is well&quot; quite often this week when I have felt like how can I possibly jump through the hoop one more time to give a little girls what she wants.<br/>
   <br/>
  This is all a very weird feeling mix of peace and chaos, but at least the girls are happy.  I have seen results in just this short time - they are fighting much less, and they say they love me all the time which is *such* a lovely side effect of this peaceful parenting!  When I look back at pictures of the last 3 years there is much time I regret that I wasn&#39;t totally engaged, totally enjoying them, and I&#39;m grateful that I found this so that I can look back at pictures from this time on and think, wow, am I ever glad I was present, engaged, enjoying.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks y&#39;all.  And no we don&#39;t say this in Canada, but I heard a man from Texas say it recently and I like it.  He also told me that the plural of &#39;y&#39;all&#39; is &#39;all y&#39;all&#39; which I like even more :o).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142393276">It is great to be in the moment with the kids, even when it&#39;s tough.<br/>
Last night at around 2 or 3am one of my twins were sitting on the bed<br/>
playing with Duplo.  I took a moment to look over his face and thought<br/>
about being in the present.    (We slept for a couple hours around 7pm<br/>
previously... ;) )<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do, that I don&#39;t know if others here do, is that I am<br/>
aware of my limits at night. I can&#39;t really go on for hours without<br/>
sleep.  If the kids come to me at a point where I&#39;m close to dragging<br/>
my knuckles on the floor and ask for a sandwich I let them know that<br/>
I&#39;m tired and not able to meet their needs at the moment.  I can help<br/>
them tomorrow when I&#39;ve gotten my rest.  This also means that good<br/>
food has to be within easy reach, and I do ask them if they want<br/>
something when I&#39;m in the kitchen and able to help them.  Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling includes some natural limits. I wish we were<br/>
genial all the time, but we&#39;re not.  Someone wrote about consensual<br/>
quiet time past midnight, I&#39;m sure others have discussed it with their<br/>
families.  Just  know what you can and can&#39;t do -- your natural<br/>
boundaries.  Maybe you all can meet somewhere in between without<br/>
having to &quot;sacrifice&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576292244">sometimes I also get to that point about midnight- 1am - I make sure <br/>
they are settled- eaten- bathroom- bed stuff ready usually they are <br/>
watching a movie nad I tell them I am tired and going to bed and <br/>
when they are ready to come join me-- usually soon after they wander <br/>
in to snuggle.<br/>
<br/>
One night I did that at about 11 and they did play quietly for a <br/>
while and then we went to bed- it is not always a smooth thing but <br/>
it is getting smoother-- then we all sleep in till 10 am so we do <br/>
get enough sleep<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779362470">I completely understand what you&#39;re saying, and I believe that sort of family rhythm will happen.  The fact that they are only 3 right now means that if they don&#39;t get what they want the instant they want it (or perhaps it&#39;s just my girls!) they have a meltdown, they just can&#39;t seem to handle it (especially if they&#39;re tired).  So...I look after a want/need one more time.  I really don&#39;t see another way around it until they are a little older.  If there is a way that fits with the RU philosophy, I would love to know about it!!!<br/>
