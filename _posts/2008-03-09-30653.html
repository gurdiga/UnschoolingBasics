<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998039535">hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve never introduced myself.  I&#39;ve been lurking since Dec and gaining<br/>
lots of information.  I have a dd8 and ds7.  We&#39;ve been unschooling<br/>
since Sept.  We did &#39;school at home&#39; before that.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been following the thread about setting limits and was hoping I<br/>
could expand the topic a little more.  What do you do when you child<br/>
will not accept or follow the limits?  She is great at following<br/>
limits/rules when she is not angry.  When she gets angry, she hides<br/>
her anger and secretly destroys things. We are not a family that ever<br/>
hides our anger.  She sees us handle our anger in appropriate ways.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess the bigger question is, how do I get her to let out her anger<br/>
in a healthy way if she avoids me and refuses to talk about it later?<br/>
 I&#39;ve tried talking to her when she is not angry. She&#39;s been in<br/>
therapy (we left because it was no longer helpful).  She said when she<br/>
is angry, she just wants to make everyone around her as angry as she<br/>
is.  She likes being angry and destroying things.  I wish this was a<br/>
phase that I could wait out, but she&#39;s been doing it since she was 5<br/>
and shows no signs of stopping.  Any suggestions?<br/>

But imagine being powerless and *then* having the power to destroy  <br/>
things and control the emotions of those around you. It&#39;s sort of  <br/>
like a superpower :-)<br/>
<br/>
Empowerment is a good solution to that.<br/>

<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Yes, it is exactly empowerment.  She refuses to budge on her first thought.  She wants her way or no other way.  She sees CL as a weakness in dh and I.<br/>
<br/>
First, let me say, these are isolated incidents, because she mostly gets what she wants, from me anyway.  Here&#39;s an example (I&#39;m sorry I knew I should have put in an example, I don&#39;t know what I was thinking)<br/>
<br/>
DH decided to build a snowman and asked the kids to join him.  They built it very big and tall.  DD wanted to put her coat on the snowman and it wouldn&#39;t fit.  Dh was not willing to let her try until it fell over.  I offered to make another snowman for her, I offered to get her shawl, poncho, something that would fit, whatever.  She wanted just that coat, period.  So she got angry and went inside.  I followed to see if I could help her and protect the contents of the house.  She slammed the door and told me to go away. I wanted to be in the house, so I went in the garage door.  She screamed at me and told me to get out of the house.  That option did not work for me.  She started grabbing things and throwing.  I waited patiently and tried to stop her from destroying things.  After her fit, she stormed upstairs.  She took a marker and started marking on our sheets.  Then she came downstairs, said she was sorry.  I told her she didn&#39;t need to be sorry.  I loved her and I<br/>
 understood that she didn&#39;t know any better way to get out her anger.  I told her I would like to help her find better ways and she said she didn&#39;t feel like talking.  She sneaked out into the garage and got some gum out of her dad&#39;s car, chewed it, then went upstairs and put it on our headboard of our bed.  I figured it out about 15 minutes too late.<br/>
<br/>
How do I get out of the cycle of her demanding everything she wants, me being as nice as I can and her taking advantage and back stabbing?  I&#39;m trying to be kind all the time, but I&#39;m starting to feel foolish.  If I try to stand my ground, it&#39;s world war 3.  I just don&#39;t know where to draw the line on kindness and how to handle physical confrontation.  What do I do if she starts throwing glasses at the kitchen window?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell when she is angry because she hides it.  I offer to help.  She says she wants help and then says she hates talking.  She told me she will say anything to get out of talking to me about what she wants (I&#39;m not sure she knows).  How do I help if she doesn&#39;t want to talk?  She contradicts herself constantly... in the same conversation.  How can I be consensual if she claims the only thing she consistently wants is to make us all angry and miserable like her?<br/>

Is that ALL you said? Because I would certainly NOT be ok with someone<br/>
marking up my sheets. I wouldn&#39;t have a problem letting them know that<br/>
this is not ok with me! If you&#39;re just being sweet and not letting her<br/>
know where your boundaries are, then there may be issues with her<br/>
feeling like she isn&#39;t getting real help when she feels out of control.<br/>
<br/>
You can let someone know they are loved AND that certain things are<br/>
not ok at the same time. It almost sounds like you are afraid of her,<br/>
or afraid to say no to her. Is that the case?<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Ren, I&#39;m not afraid of her, but I&#39;m afraid of hurting her.  I went through so many years of punishing her.  Time outs, push ups, taking away &#39;priveledges&#39;.  I just never want to do that again, but I don&#39;t know how to get her to stop.  I&#39;m fine with her testing me to make sure I&#39;m not going to do it again, but I feel like it has gone beyond that.<br/>
I genuinely think she is miserable and does not even know what she wants.   After her brother made out a christmas list last year, she copied his exactly and added 1 thing.  When christmas came and she got everything on her list, she was miserable.  She hated it all.  She was so jealous of the thought that her brother would have things she didn&#39;t, but she had no idea what she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t know what she wants.  So she doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.  And I don&#39;t know where to go from here.<br/>
So you have to have that ARGH gathering in April. &lt;shameless grin&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Hmmmm....she is probably doing a lot of healing. She is also probably<br/>
feeling a bit lost and unsure of you at this point. In a sense, you<br/>
pulled the rug out from under her because she doesn&#39;t know what to<br/>
expect perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Can you stay with her when she&#39;s melting down and angry? So she has<br/>
you right there until the process is complete? She&#39;s really angry at<br/>
her parents it seems like...so this might be a part of her healing.<br/>
She might be trying to hurt you back for some of the hurt she<br/>
experienced before but is unable to put it into words just yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that with Jalen, we couldn&#39;t communicate during the storm<br/>
but we could go with the flow. If he felt like throwing something,<br/>
we&#39;d hand him safe items to throw. If he wanted to hit or strike out,<br/>
I&#39;d pick up a pillow or rice bag and yell &quot;hit it!!&quot; and it really<br/>
helped him work through that energy and get back to a place of balance<br/>
much faster than trying to calm him down.<br/>
<br/>
Could you make a &quot;high energy&quot; area for her? A place with a punching<br/>
bag or bean bags to throw, a wall to draw on? Things that might seem<br/>
destructive normally are great in an area designed to accomodate that.<br/>
You could even keep some small items from the dollar store that she<br/>
could smash or destroy. This could be helpful until she&#39;s ready to put<br/>
some of this into words.<br/>
<br/>
What happens when you reflect back to her? &quot;You seem really angry<br/>
right now&quot; or &quot;Wow, that upset you&quot;. You have to find words that fit<br/>
the situation and personality, but how does she respond to you simply<br/>
listening and absorbing her anger?<br/>
<br/>
As far as finding herself again and what she loves, it might take some<br/>
time. She might have some sensory challenges or other issues that she<br/>
has no words for. Some people just FEEL things more intensely and when<br/>
something feels &quot;off&quot; they just don&#39;t have the tools or words for what<br/>
is happening yet. It isn&#39;t easy to find ways to support someone<br/>
through that process but I think you&#39;re on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I need to get working on the ARGH gathering! There&#39;s nothing<br/>
like live support to give encouragement.:)<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like she is screaming for some direction. Ren is correct, you <br/>
have most likely thrown her for a loop with your 180 in the way you <br/>
treat her. Immature minds do not know precisely how to handle changes <br/>
like that so they&#39;ll turn to extreme behaviour patterns to extract what <br/>
they need. This girl needs her purpose spelled out for her (which <br/>
you&#39;ll have to invent, but that is ok) so she has something to focus <br/>
on. Human psychology teaches us that for us to be happy, stable, and <br/>
balanced, we simply need to think we have a lifelong purpose and have <br/>
the ability and tools to direct our focus on it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601255989">Can you stay with her when she&#39;s melting down and angry? So she has<br/>
you right there until the process is complete? <br/>
<br/>
~She will let me if she is not mad at me. I do that.  I sit outside her door to give her privacy and let her know I&#39;m there if she needs me.  I tell her that I am here for her and I will go if she wants me to.  She can&#39;t tell me to stay (ask for help), but she will not tell me to go (making me think she wants me there).<br/>
<br/>
She might be trying to hurt you back for some of the hurt she<br/>
experienced before but is unable to put it into words just yet.<br/>
<br/>
~Maybe, but she says she is afraid to hurt me physically.  She knows that she has hurt me a lot too.  I think she does feel guilty about it as well.  When I suggest she let her anger out, she is afraid to because she doesn&#39;t want to hurt me.  I suggested pillows and such, but she said that feels silly to her.  She seems to be destroying to feel powerful, so it has to genuinely hurt someone else emotionally.  I&#39;ve already said, &quot;if that&#39;s what you need to do to let out your anger, go ahead.&quot;  That really diffuses the situation.  She said it ruins it for her.  The problem is that I can&#39;t always say that.  She knows when I&#39;m bluffing.  <br/>
<br/>
Could you make a &quot;high energy&quot; area for her? <br/>
<br/>
~We have a punching bag, mattress/boxspring to jump on, park and rec center in walking distance.  I do think part of it is her needing to let out energy.  The problem is that she is choosing TV instead of activity.  If I ask her to do something active, she declines.  We had two days of gorgeous weather and she never came outside.  Ds and I were out there the whole time!  <br/>
<br/>
What happens when you reflect back to her? <br/>
<br/>
~She HATES that.  Originally she would look at me and say, &quot;well, duh! I&#39;m not stupid, but you are.&quot;  Now, it just fuels her anger.  She&#39;ll take my reflection and magnify it.  I just feel like I can&#39;t find the right words.  The less I say the better, but sometimes I have to say things like, &quot;put the glass down.&quot;  She challenges me, forcing me to grab the glass.  Then it becomes a fight for the glass.  That&#39;s what I want to avoid before it gets that far, but the words are eluding me.    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions.  I&#39;m gonna see what I can do to make activity more interesting.  I don&#39;t mind that she is watching TV, I just know that is not making her happy.  She&#39;s usually a very active and social kid, and she seems to be choosing tv out of boredom.  I&#39;ve suggested things around the house until I was blue in the face and she is not interested. I think I&#39;m going to need to look outside to find something for her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like right here is where she got you.  I am going to guess<br/>
that you were throwing out these ideas in hopes that she did not<br/>
meltdown.  When these anger issues would come up with my son, I found<br/>
that empathizing first (&quot;oh bummer!  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit.  that really<br/>
stinks!&quot;)  and asking him to figure out what to do next worked a<br/>
little better than throwing out a bunch of ideas. (not always but<br/>
sometimes) That way, it was still HIS idea and he still felt in<br/>
control.  This took practice though.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She wanted just that coat, period.  So she got angry and went inside.<br/>

&gt;and told me to get out of the house.  That option did not work for<br/>
&gt;me.  She started grabbing things and throwing.  I waited patiently<br/>
&gt;and tried to stop her from destroying things.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At this point, I wouldn&#39;t wait patiently. With my older son, I warned<br/>
him once and told him &quot;I will NOT let you destroy [insert thing here].<br/>
 And if he truly was destroying things I would physically stop him.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how unschooly or proper that is.  But there was no way I<br/>
would allow him (or anyone else for that matter) to come in and<br/>
destroy things in our house.  I never hurt him, or used any force<br/>
beyond keeping myself and him safe.  And he knew very quickly that<br/>
being destructive wasn&#39;t the best way to get his point across.  We<br/>
often waited until things were calm to discuss other options.  For<br/>
example, &quot;I see that when you&#39;re angry you need to be alone, but I<br/>
feel that I can&#39;t trust you around [insert stuff in house here] when<br/>
you destroy things.  How can we work that out?&quot;  I don&#39;t remember the<br/>
exact conversations, but something along those lines.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;After her fit, she stormed upstairs.  She took a marker and started<br/>
&gt;marking on our sheets.  Then she came downstairs, said she was sorry.<br/>
&gt;I told her she didn&#39;t need to be sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She apologized on her own, and you told basically told her it wasn&#39;t<br/>
the right thing to do.  That&#39;s similar to saying &quot;that&#39;s ok&quot; when<br/>
someone apologizes.  It&#39;s NOT ok.  Say &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;I appreciate<br/>
your apology&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I loved her and I understood that she didn&#39;t know any better way to<br/>
&gt;get out her anger.  I told her I would like to help her find better<br/>
&gt;ways and she said she didn&#39;t feel like talking.  She sneaked out into<br/>
&gt;the garage and got some gum out of her dad&#39;s car, chewed it, then<br/>
&gt;went upstairs and put it on our headboard of our bed.  I figured it<br/>
&gt;out about 15 minutes too late.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knowing how sensitive my son was with words, if I had said that to<br/>
him...  he would have heard &quot;I love you&quot;.  Good.  But then he would<br/>
have heard, &quot;you don&#39;t know any better.&quot;  And that would have set him<br/>
off again.  He still does that with my words sometimes.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>
be clear.  Would it be wrong to let her know that what she is doing is<br/>
making you angry/upset/tired or [insert emotion here]?  Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
better to be more realistic here, than to try and be &quot;nice&quot;.  That&#39;s a<br/>
question I have as well.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to be as kind/nice as you can.  I&#39;m not suggesting you<br/>
be mean.  I&#39;m just saying, when you child is going bonkers and putting<br/>
herself and others in danger it&#39;s time for action.  When she starts<br/>
throwing glasses at the kitchen window you can/should/need to<br/>
physically stop her and yell &quot;NO, I won&#39;t let you do that!&quot; <br/>
Unschooling and peaceful parenting does not mean hands off and<br/>
everybody talks in a nice calm voice 24/7.  People have emotions and<br/>
reactions.  Even you.  It&#39;s your job to keep her and others safe.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;she wants (I&#39;m not sure she knows).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Talking too much drives some kids nuts!  You know the husband that<br/>
complains about nagging wife?  It&#39;s usually because when his wife<br/>
wants/needs something she goes on for an hour about something.  Same<br/>
idea.   Mine doesn&#39;t like to talk unless he initiates it.  Usually I<br/>
just listen.  Ask HER what sort of helps she wants.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How do I help if she doesn&#39;t want to talk?  She contradicts herself<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By just being there.  How about just listening without commenting?  In<br/>
the heat of the moment or even directly afterward isn&#39;t always the<br/>
best time for you to be talking, but she may have loads to get off her<br/>
chest.  How about having a snack together later in the day or the next<br/>
day and having a chat? How about asking her questions, and see if she<br/>
has any ideas.  Let her know she&#39;s affecting others and see if she<br/>
comes up with ideas.  She might not come up with any.  You&#39;re out of<br/>
ideas.  Maybe she has some.  Maybe she wants to be held not talked to?<br/>
 I like Ren&#39;s idea of having a safe place to retreat to and get some<br/>
anger and energy out. She sounds FULL of it!   Is she distractable? <br/>
Distraction is sometimes a good way to bring her back to you.  I think<br/>
its works better with the young ones though.<br/>
<br/>
These are just things I have found myself doing with my highly<br/>
physical son.  He&#39;s 9 now, much better with his emotions, and a<br/>
wrestler on a team instead of with his mom.  LOL  I&#39;m actually hoping<br/>
Kelly or someone will read this and comment on what I wrote here.  It<br/>
is sounding a bit harsh.  But I feel that personal safety is extremely<br/>
important and needs to addressed very fast and seriously before<br/>
someone catches a glass to the head.  I also wondering why you feel<br/>
that it&#39;s not ok for you to be angry?  How could your child possibly<br/>
learn to deal with her anger if you aren&#39;t dealing with yours?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025636805">My family really doesn&#39;t like it at all when I reflect, either. Why are <br/>
you talking in that weird way, mom. Being quiet with them or even just <br/>
giving space works better- or just saying yes or making a small sound.  <br/>
I think that when someone is really angry there is not much I can do <br/>
besides not add fuel. Talking is most always best done later, when <br/>
everyone calms down.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter used to throw things and break things when angry, up to <br/>
about age 9. I would hold her gently, from behind, until she was ready <br/>
to stop, which wouldn&#39;t take too long. I would do this only when <br/>
necessary. She did break many of her own things, though. She would throw <br/>
most everything in her room on the floor.  A friend who worked at a <br/>
violent youth offender facility once showed me a way to hold a child by <br/>
sitting behind, arms and legs wrapped around them. I would say- <br/>
something like: You can be angry, but I am not going to allow you to <br/>
break things and will hold you until you are ready to stop. I don&#39;t know <br/>
either if this is recommended unschooling practice but it sure worked <br/>
better than yelling or trying to fight her to get things away from her.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read the book &quot;The Explosive Child&quot;?- I think it has been <br/>
recommended on this list before and certainly on others- This one really <br/>
helped me a lot in understanding her and with tools for reducing <br/>
conflict situations, and though it seemed really hard along the way <br/>
things are much easier now. Saying yes as much as possible has made the <br/>
times that a real limit comes up much more tolerable for her- she trusts <br/>
that I am doing what I can to help. She is still angry, disappointed, <br/>
but the intensity is way less. Offering solutions often doesn&#39;t really <br/>
help though I still have the tendency to do it. She will often figure <br/>
out something later that meets the need.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I don&#39;t know if it is unschooly or not.  But in my situation it<br/>
was necessary.  My oldest son had given me one too many fat lips and<br/>
burises not do it.  Their came a time when he actively sought it out<br/>
too.  For some reason he found it safe to &quot;freak out&quot; in my arms.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is generally used in severe cases.  Our situation, when he<br/>
was younger, was severe.  My son would literally black out from anger<br/>
when he was younger and cause an awful lot of harm to himself and us.<br/>
  If you could picture a child screaming like he had just broken his<br/>
leg, running around his room aimlessly banging into things, hurting<br/>
himself on purpose, and trying to hurt me on purpose. He truly was,<br/>
emotionally and physically safer in our arms.  I hated it though.  I<br/>

you are probably right.  So, here goes.<br/>
<br/>
--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;swissarmy_wife&quot;<br/>
&lt;heatherbean@...&gt; wrote:<br/>
It sounds like right here is where she got you. I am going to guess<br/>
that you were throwing out these ideas in hopes that she did not<br/>
meltdown. <br/>
<br/>
~ Yes, she smelled my fear.. and the opportunity to divide mom and<br/>
dad.  I thought dh was being rather protective of a big snowball, but<br/>
he was very emotional about the whole thing.  She knew I thought he<br/>
should lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
When these anger issues would come up with my son, I found<br/>
that empathizing first (&quot;oh bummer! It&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit. that really<br/>
stinks!&quot;) and asking him to figure out what to do next worked a<br/>
little better than throwing out a bunch of ideas. <br/>
<br/>
~I think she would go for this. Yeah, I give them ideas all the time.<br/>
 A friend recently suggested that I let them find their own solutions<br/>
instead of giving them tons of ideas(we were talking about boredom),<br/>
but I think it is definitely an issue with times like this as well.<br/>
<br/>
And if he truly was destroying things I would physically stop him. I<br/>
don&#39;t know how unschooly or proper that is. <br/>
<br/>
~Yup, that&#39;s my dilemma.  I&#39;m new at this unschooly thing and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to fall back into my old patterns.<br/>
<br/>
But there was no way I would allow him (or anyone else for that<br/>
matter) to come in and<br/>
destroy things in our house. <br/>
<br/>
~ I recently read a post by Pam S on the &#39;setting limits again&#39; thread:<br/>
Don&#39;t let them be too rough with you or name call, without saying,<br/>
&quot;Hey, NOT okay. Stop it now.&quot; And put space between you and them so<br/>
they can&#39;t hurt you. Don&#39;t just let them do it. But that&#39;s all you<br/>
need to do - that IS the consequence, that you won&#39;t allow it to happen.<br/>
~This was a big wake up call to me.  The next time my dd started<br/>
calling me names I said, &quot;NOT ok.&quot;  Well, that&#39;s when the problems<br/>
with dd started to escalate and get more destructive.  Before that it<br/>
was just verbal and I could let that roll off my shoulder.  It was<br/>
just embarassing in front of others, especially my mom who is really<br/>
trying to understand.<br/>
 <br/>
She apologized on her own, and you told basically told her it wasn&#39;t<br/>
the right thing to do. That&#39;s similar to saying &quot;that&#39;s ok&quot; when<br/>
someone apologizes. It&#39;s NOT ok. Say &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;I appreciate<br/>
your apology&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
~Gulp.  This one felt wrong when I was writing it.  It felt very<br/>
vulnerable to admit.  At the time I thought I didn&#39;t want to make her<br/>
feel guilty.  the shaming thing.  I do enough of that as it is and I<br/>
am really trying hard to notice when I do and change it.  You&#39;re<br/>
right, I was telling her it was OK, essentially giving her permission<br/>
to do it again.  I wasn&#39;t trying to guilt her into apologizing.  On<br/>
the other hand, I&#39;m not sure her apology was sincere.  In retrospect<br/>
it was manipulative to get me to let down my guard so she could<br/>
further destroy my bed.  I&#39;m gonna go with, &quot;thank you&quot; from now on. <br/>
Maybe that won&#39;t seem so spineless.<br/>
<br/>
he would have heard, &quot;you don&#39;t know any better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~Yikes!  I never thought about it like that.  I guess I am telling her<br/>
that she can&#39;t do it.  I don&#39;t expect her to do it, so she never will.<br/>
 So I just need to tell her that she can find a solution.  Empower her<br/>
&lt;lightbulb goes on!&gt;.  aargh.  I know this stuff!  I&#39;ve read it so<br/>
many times.  Why didn&#39;t I see it?  <br/>
<br/>
Would it be wrong to let her know that what she is doing is<br/>
making you angry/upset/ tired or [insert emotion here]? Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
better to be more realistic here, than to try and be &quot;nice&quot;. That&#39;s a<br/>
question I have as well.<br/>
<br/>
~That makes sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Ask HER what sort of helps she wants.<br/>
<br/>
~This is where I think we are both stuck.  I have told her she needs<br/>
my help, so she doesn&#39;t know what sort of help she wants.  I bet she<br/>
can come up with some great solutions if I just give her a little<br/>
trust and encouragment.<br/>
<br/>
I like Ren&#39;s idea of having a safe place to retreat to and get some<br/>
anger and energy out. She sounds FULL of it! <br/>
<br/>
~We have these things, but they are spread out all over the house.  I<br/>
like the idea of consolidating them so her has a retreat.<br/>
<br/>
These are just things I have found myself doing with my highly<br/>
physical son. He&#39;s 9 now, much better with his emotions, and a<br/>
wrestler on a team instead of with his mom. <br/>
<br/>
~I would love to find something like this for my son.  Can I email you<br/>
off list with some questions?  Unless you think everyone would like to<br/>
hear more about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wondering why you feel that it&#39;s not ok for you to be angry?<br/>
How could your child possibly<br/>
learn to deal with her anger if you aren&#39;t dealing with yours? <br/>
<br/>
~The verbal things did not make me angry.  They rarely happened in<br/>
public.  She is usually only like this at home.  I just felt sad for<br/>
her when she said mean things to me.  You know the old saying no one<br/>
can hurt you unless you let them.  I took that power away from her by<br/>
not letting her words/actions make me angry.  After all they are just<br/>
things and she is more important.  It&#39;s the threats on personal safety<br/>
that concern me.  She&#39;s never actually done anything physically<br/>
harmful, but she threatens.  I think if push came to shove she would<br/>
not jeopardize anyone&#39;s safety.  She would be hesitant, but if she<br/>
thought I was OK with it, she would definitely try it.  So I also need<br/>
to be very clear about my words.  I do get angry when they fight with<br/>
each other.  She does see me handle my anger then.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been so helpful.  No only to mull around new ideas in my<br/>
head, but to put it all in writing.  Thank you.</div>

 This girl needs her purpose spelled out for her (which<br/>
you&#39;ll have to invent, but that is ok) so she has something to focus<br/>
on. Human psychology teaches us that for us to be happy, stable, and<br/>

=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I can seem to comprehend your posts. Maybe it&#39;s some <br/>
of the lingo.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT purpose? What do you mean by &quot;purpose&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How do you &quot;invent&quot; someone else&#39;s purpose?<br/>
<br/>
And why do we &quot;need to think we have a lifelong purpose&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I am really not understanding. Are others as confused as I am?<br/>
<br/>
I have daily and weekly and monthly &quot;To Do&quot; lists, but I don&#39;t think I <br/>
have a daily, weekly or monthly *purpose*. I certainly don&#39;t have a <br/>
&quot;lifelong purpose&quot;---unless you know something I don&#39;t.&lt;:-P<br/>
<br/>
I know Steve Martin had a &quot;special purpose&quot; in The Jerk, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think that&#39;s what you mean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean &quot;goals&quot;? Goals are good. But others can&#39;t invent or set our <br/>
goals for us.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;purpose&quot; is really throwing me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708904270">I, too, have difficulty understanding this, but not because I don&#39;t  <br/>
get &quot;purpose&quot; &lt;g&gt;.  Many people think that having a lifelong purpose  <br/>
(e.g. healing people or animals, changing society, bringing the  <br/>
message of unschooling to others &lt;g&gt; etc.) is an important part of  <br/>
their lives – an overall guide to what they do and how they live in  <br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t get is the &quot;invent your child&#39;s purpose for her, then  <br/>
spell it out so she has something to focus on&quot; part. You, as a parent,  <br/>
can facilitate your child&#39;s understanding of their own purpose (should  <br/>
they, indeed, want to discover it), but you can&#39;t *make* them have  <br/>
one. It&#39;s antithetical to unschooling to do so.<br/>

P.S. Brad, tell us about your family and how unschooling works in your  <br/>

This girl needs her purpose spelled out for her (which<br/>
you&#39;ll have to invent, but that is ok) so she has something to focus<br/>
on. Human psychology teaches us that for us to be happy, stable, and<br/>
balanced, we simply need to think we have a lifelong purpose and have<br/>
the ability and tools to direct our focus on it.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I can seem to comprehend your posts. Maybe it&#39;s some <br/>
of the lingo.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT purpose? What do you mean by &quot;purpose&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How do you &quot;invent&quot; someone else&#39;s purpose?<br/>
<br/>
And why do we &quot;need to think we have a lifelong purpose&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I am really not understanding. Are others as confused as I am?<br/>
<br/>
I have daily and weekly and monthly &quot;To Do&quot; lists, but I don&#39;t think I <br/>
have a daily, weekly or monthly *purpose*. I certainly don&#39;t have a <br/>
&quot;lifelong purpose&quot;---unless you know something I don&#39;t.&lt;:-P<br/>
<br/>
I know Steve Martin had a &quot;special purpose&quot; in The Jerk, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think that&#39;s what you mean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean &quot;goals&quot;? Goals are good. But others can&#39;t invent or set our <br/>
goals for us.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;purpose&quot; is really throwing me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541590507">And here&#39;s another radical idea.  What is our &quot;purpose&quot; is just that - OURS?<br/>
One that WE decide and WE choose and WE follow because we want to?  Near the<br/>

  No I have not invented a purpose for my children yet since fortunately I do not have a red-zone child, she does not destroy my things in fits of rage. Folks, I&#39;m only suggesting this idea for a red-zone case, I am not suggesting it for people who are not in this situation and for people who are starting from scratch....<br/>

  I am suggesting it because most suggestions I&#39;m hearing here so far tend to enable the behaviour that this child is displaying. I&#39;m not a big believer in enabling undesirable behaviours.

What I don&#39;t get is the &quot;invent your child&#39;s purpose for her, then <br/>

can facilitate your child&#39;s understanding of their own purpose (should <br/>

No.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of it (uh...not that I&#39;ve heard of everything! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just never heard that phrase. And I don&#39;t believe that I serve any <br/>
certain lifelong purpose. My goals has changed as I&#39;ve aged. They <br/>
change every day.<br/>

Ten scoops of mushroom compost arrived today, so my &quot;purpose&quot; for <br/>
tomorrow has increased dramatically. &lt;g&gt; My &quot;purpose&quot; is to distribute <br/>
a half-ton of compost into the new 16X20 raised bed and on the lawn. <br/>

Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Below is the list I usually send to folks questioning unschooling in SC <br/>
(with a few additions). Long book list as well as elists, websites, and <br/>
conferences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>
on<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>
in the<br/>
70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>
popular<br/>
books are _How Children Fail_, _How Children Learn_, _Teach Your Own_, <br/>
and _Learning<br/>
All the Time_.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>
finally<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>
unschooling (although a little anti-TV and -gaming). His two big books <br/>
are _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground<br/>
History of American Education_.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called _The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting_ that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>
school. He<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a purpose. GREAT for dads!!<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s _Punished by Rewards_ shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>
motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>
and<br/>
Get a REAL Education)_ is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great <br/>
read for<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>
little<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>
in<br/>
the early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>
and share<br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books, _The Homeschooling Handbook_ and _The <br/>
Unschooling<br/>
Handbook_. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>
documenting<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very<br/>
helpful. But _The Unschooling Handbook_ is THE handbook for new <br/>
unschoolers. In it she<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>
Convinced my<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mark Prenky (not an unschooler) has several books---anything by him <br/>
would be worthwhile. But his _Don&#39;t Bother Me , Mom! I&#39;m Learning!_ is <br/>
a great introduction to understanding gaming and the 21st century.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel Pink---also not an unschooler---has written several books on how <br/>
traditional schooling/education is failing the modern human. _A Whole <br/>
New Mind_ is a good read.<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: _And the Skylark Sings with Me_ and <br/>
_Homeschooling and the<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery_. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a book that I highly recommend: _The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School_. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>
daughter, Laurie.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle_---a collection of essays. Most can be <br/>
found online and at her site, but it&#39;s nice to have them bound---all in <br/>
one place.<br/>
<br/>
My absolute favorite of all time is Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free <br/>
Child; An Unschooled Life_. It WILL change your life! Worth its weight <br/>
in gold!<br/>
<br/>
Magazines:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Connections&quot; e-zine ---online magazine<br/>
&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>
&quot;Live Free Learn Free&quot;<br/>
&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer <br/>
in<br/>
production, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from <br/>
FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
_www.unschooling.info_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/)">http://www.unschooling.info/)</a> There are other <br/>
lists<br/>
that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are<br/>
talking about. There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely <br/>
read first.<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have<br/>
questions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>
have been<br/>
explained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>
of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
*note: this has become a rather quiet board---not that *you* can&#39;t make <br/>
it lively again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

you prefer<br/>

core, or just prefer your lists this way, I&#39;d recommend the message <br/>

stories<br/>
about unschooling. It&#39;s a great place to start. <br/>
