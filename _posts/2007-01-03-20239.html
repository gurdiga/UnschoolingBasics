<div id="ygrps-yiv-820470561">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
When we pulled our children out of school almost 3 years ago, I was aware of<br/>
&#39;deschooling&#39;, so we decided to give it 6 months and see how it went.  Well,<br/>
it ended up taking about a year before both girls got into the groove of<br/>
homeschooling and then a little longer for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As a parent I think I still find myself needing to deschool on certain<br/>
issues.  I read a lot about unschooling, mindfulness and parenting and am<br/>
going through a huge learning/growth spurt.  Sometimes it can feel very<br/>
overwhelming and uncomfortable, other days invigorating. I am still<br/>
astounded at how conditioned I had been by the educational system.<br/>
<br/>
My girls had been in school for 2 years and the eldest 4 years, and the<br/>
eldest did take the longest to &#39;deschool&#39; but I also think that is a<br/>
personality issue.<br/>

records and that I was going to log in a weekly calendar each days<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838920836">I am so glad I joined this group! I have been so worried about my 7yr.old  <br/>
daughter. I have been homeschooling since Sept. and I had no idea that  <br/>
deschooling was an option. I started out with typical school workbooks  etc. it did <br/>
not work for me or my daughter.  I know that unschooling is the  method for us <br/>
but I had so many unanswered questions. So I&#39;ve been giving  myself,and her, <br/>
time to adjust. I realize now that I need to trust my own  instincts. I know <br/>
what is right for me and my daughter and it&#39;s great to know  that others share <br/>
the same views. I too am amazed at how conditioned I am by the  educational <br/>
system. Even though I have worked in Motessori classrooms for  years, I still have <br/>
a hard time trusting. Thank you for sharing. <br/>

What are you doing to keep track of your teenagers progress?  I am<br/>
de-schooling and we will be entering the high school years next year.  I<br/>
really want to record their progress well but am unsure how to it as an<br/>
unschooler.<br/>

In the Plus edition of homeschool tracker, you can create your<br/>
own courses under subject headings so for instance my DS loves<br/>
anime books and he is learning to draw so he can create his own.<br/>
I see several things for his transcript here.<br/>
Subject-Art<br/>
Course- Art Through Comics<br/>
Coursework- Reading comic history, reading anime books,<br/>
watching anime movies (he has one in Japanese), drawing.<br/>
Subject-English<br/>
Course- Reading<br/>
Coursework- Reading the books<br/>
Course- Spelling<br/>
Coursework reading<br/>
Etc. for English<br/>
<br/>
Subject- Social Studies<br/>
Course - Effects of media on society<br/>
Coursework- Reading and watching movies, t.v., etc.<br/>
and discussing the ideas that interest him (ad nauseum, lol)<br/>
<br/>
I simply stay alert to what they are doing, and find ways <br/>
to give them course credits.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

REMINDER:<br/>
<br/>
This list is to help people understand UNschooling. This is not a list<br/>
to discuss grading or other schoolish methods. If you want advice on<br/>
how to keep records AND unschool, we can help with that. If you want<br/>
advice on grading, textbooks etc...then it needs to be discussed<br/>
elsewhere. We&#39;re here to help people move beyond that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184395779">No a&#39;am, this is just to keep records of what they<br/>
are doing and put it into educationalese.<br/>
For now it proves to them that they are doing <br/>
something of value even if it seems like<br/>
goofing off. <br/>
The reward has been that two very intelligent <br/>
but stressed out teens have become more open,<br/>
affectionate, and honest. <br/>
A few weeks ago my DS hugged me for the first<br/>
time in years (a real hold on to mom type hug),<br/>
that&#39;s progress.<br/>

nothing to do with Unschooling Voices. Thanks!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830862984">Joanne forgot to post the topic, but I&#39;m such a fan, I looked it up:<br/>

How has unschooling changed YOU? Yes, itâs about the kids, but is it <br/>
ONLY about the kids? I sometimes think unschooling has changed me more <br/>
than them. What are your thoughts? Also, here another short, just-for-<br/>
fun question this month; share two photos that show what unschooling <br/>
currently looks like in your house at this time. You can also tag them <br/>
at flickr with our new (thanks Mandy) Unschooling Voices Flickr tag.<br/>
<br/>
I see the tag isn&#39;t coming through, but here&#39;s the link to the main <br/>
page again:<br/>
