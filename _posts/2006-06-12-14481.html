<div id="ygrps-yiv-849434983">I have to file for the first time this year in MA since my daugter is <br/>
now 6.  I was looking for a sample ed plan for unschoolers.  I think <br/>
someone on this site posted a link to one a few weeks ago, but I can&#39;t <br/>
find it.  I was woundering if someeone could send me a sample ed plan <br/>
that they have used so I can know where to begin as I write mine.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hi Jen,<br/>
I&#39;m in MA too, this is our first year, dd is 13.  My ed plan is a lot <br/>
like the one on the ahem.info site.   It&#39;s for middle school but I&#39;d <br/>
be happy to email it to you if you want to take a look at it!<br/>
