1)no  running in the house, and<br/>
2) no jumping on the  bed.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
If it were me I would try to identify why I needed these rules in the  first <br/>
place.  Is it because I don&#39;t want someone to trip on the rug or  don&#39;t want <br/>
my antique lamp to be knocked over etc.  I would also find out  why they do <br/>
want to run in the house.  Then I we would work together to see  that both needs <br/>
are met in a way that everyone is happy.  Just an example  but would they be <br/>
happy if we go to the park every day so they can run in the  field over there, <br/>
or if I play and run with them outside.  Is it the  physical activity they <br/>
like while they are thinking (that is my son...LOL) would  a mini trampoline <br/>
satisfy that need for movement.  Could I move the things  that I am afraid they <br/>
would knock over to a higher place, or tape down the  rug.  Could we &quot;run proof&quot; <br/>
one room in the house. etc etc.  I think  you get the point, that I would <br/>
examine why we feel we need the rule and talk it  all over to come to a solution <br/>
that is workable, there are probably a lot more  solutions but you see what I <br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Same for jumping on the bed.  Probably you are  thinking that they could fall <br/>
off the bed and be hurt or could damage the bed by  jumping on it, so what <br/>
about putting the mattress on the floor.  Finding an  old mattress for them to <br/>
jump on, or a mini trampoline that would give the same  effect but not so high <br/>
up.  Or my parents took an old couch that still had  some bounce in it and put <br/>
it in our basement where there were no other BIG  objects to fall on.  etc.  <br/>
Lots of solutions there so that everyone  would be safe, the furniture would <br/>
be OK and the need for jumping would be  met.  <br/>
 <br/>
But my suggestion would be to start thinking about why  you have the rule in <br/>
the first place/<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

Thank you for your thoughts Pam.  I really appreciate it~!  I hadn&#39;t even<br/>
thought about a mini trampoline~! My grandparents had one at their house and<br/>
we loved it.  I&#39;ll definitely have to check into that.  I responded earlier<br/>
to Kelly about the way our house is set up: basically small house + large<br/>
furniture = mom&#39;s anxiety of an ER visit. lol.<br/>
