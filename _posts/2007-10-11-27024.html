<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351773084">I find this video hilarious because it does remind me of my life. While<br/>
I have never said all these phrases in one day, I&#39;ve certainly used many<br/>
of them.  My tween no longer gets up without my wake up call, as she<br/>
used to when she was younger.  Like many teens, her body naturally wants<br/>
to keep her awake at night and asleep in the morning.  However, she has<br/>
to wake up at 8am, not 11am, to fulfill her commitments.  My son doesn&#39;t<br/>
brush his teeth without my reminder.<br/>
<br/>
I often have to teach and remind my kids to wake up, dress appropriately<br/>
for the weather, clean up, eat the food on the plate, use decent table<br/>
manners, be fair to others, treat their siblings well, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really surprised to find that there are moms who never have to teach<br/>
and remind their kids to do any of these things.  I would love to learn<br/>
how to get the kids to do these things without my coaxing.<br/>

phrases together for an audience of ex-slaves.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s funny because lots of us grew up hearing those.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s disturbing -- though expectedly so -- because the women  <br/>
are certain that&#39;s how their lives with their own kids need to be.<br/>
<br/>
Comedians are funny when they hold an old practice up to a new light  <br/>
to give insight. Like gets done here (though we don&#39;t get many yuks  <br/>
so we fail as comedians! Except for Deb ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It would have been cool if the mothers could have said &quot;Oh, my  <br/>
goodness, is that what I sound like? Is that what it feels like? I  <br/>
need something better!&quot; But the laughter shared undoubtedly convinced  <br/>
them even further that that&#39;s the way life needs to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904093337">Many times it is about HOW you communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Communicating with kids is one things, giving orders is another.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just saying nothing, and waiting for them to figure out that <br/>
whatever it is is important for them to do. When it is important to <br/>
THEM, they will do it.<br/>
<br/>
If it is something you feel is important to YOU and you must say <br/>
something about it, then you can say it in a respectful, giving <br/>
information kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have arranged a morning activity(their choice)- I knock on <br/>
their doors and ask- &quot;do you want to get up to go to such and such? They <br/>
say yes and get up, because they want to. If they don&#39;t want to they can <br/>
stay in bed. If my daughter doesn&#39;t want to get up to go to something my <br/>
son has arranged, then I ask her what she would like to do - go to the <br/>
craft store or out to breakfast, for example, then she wants to get up, too.<br/>
<br/>
I will inform them that it is colder today than it has been, and if they <br/>
don&#39;t want to wear a coat, I&#39;ll throw one in the car for them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids brush their teeth because their mouths feel better when they do.<br/>
<br/>
They eat the food on their plate usually because they chose what to put <br/>
on it. If not, then someone else will eat it, or we can put it away for <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are treating each other poorly- it is because of how they <br/>
are feeling, so I make sure they  are each safe and attempt to validate <br/>
their feelings and I might talk about how I feel when I see them <br/>
treating each other that way.<br/>
<br/>
You may not &quot;get&quot; your kids to do the things you want them to do, but <br/>
they will learn to care for themselves and be respectful if you are <br/>
respectful and care for them and yourself and give them needed real <br/>
information.<br/>

You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;, you choose to. They don&#39;t need to be taught at<br/>
all actually, but they will learn just fine.  Reminders are one thing,<br/>
being prodded and coerced is entirely different.<br/>

often, &quot;He&#39;s a man,&quot; as if gender makes one incompetent and stupid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287993711">I&#39;m definitely receiving a new perspective from this thread, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;m ready to be completely hands off.  I&#39;ve always modeled and<br/>
encouraged being respectful of other peoples&#39; feelings.  However, one of<br/>
the reasons this video strikes a chord is due to what the comedian<br/>
describes as the &#39;cosmic Groundhog Day&#39; where moms (and dads) often find<br/>
themselves saying the same things over & over.<br/>
<br/>
While I do try to let the kids be more independent, they are still kids<br/>
and members of a family that cares for each other.  They count on me to<br/>
give them reminders or to point out things that are obvious to an adult,<br/>
but not to them.  For example, my daughter counts on Mommy&#39;s wake up<br/>
call, just as I count on the morning cup of coffee my husband provides. <br/>
These aren&#39;t necessary, but the morning doesn&#39;t go as well when they are<br/>
missing.  My 8-year-old son doesn&#39;t always remember to brush his teeth,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t notice any difference in how his mouth feels.  I notice his<br/>
bad breath when we work together.  Of course, I kindly remind him to<br/>
brush his teeth.  Still, in route to the upstairs bathroom, he forgets<br/>
why he went upstairs.  So, again I remind him to please brush his teeth.<br/>
Sometimes, this happens several times.  I suppose I could give up on<br/>
working with him and wait a few days until his grungy mouth bothers him<br/>
as well.  I&#39;m not too fond of that solution.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I&#39;ve tried to persuade the children to do what is necessary<br/>
because it is important to them personally or to our family.  In light<br/>
of this discussion, I will think about whether my requests or reminders<br/>
can be perceived as authoritarian orders.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the food for thought!  Sandra, LivingByLearning<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487662675">-=- I&#39;m definitely receiving a new perspective from this thread, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to be completely hands off. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sandra! I don&#39;t think anyone here is saying &quot;hands off&quot;. When rules<br/>
and arbitrary limits and authoritarian demands are removed and we<br/>
choose to take children seriously we are, in fact, committing<br/>
ourselves to be *more* aware and engaged than traditional parenting<br/>
models call for. Unschooling and respectful parenting is so much more<br/>
*hands on* than conventional approaches, imo. It&#39;s not about giving a<br/>
command and expecting immediate compliance or making a set of rules<br/>
and then considering my job finished (unless one of the rules is<br/>
broken).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s working *with* our children, being present to their needs,<br/>
emotions, experiences, and curiosities. Modeling, guidance,<br/>
suggestions, and feedback are all used by families here - it&#39;s just<br/>
done respectfully and gently. Parents *partner* with their children.<br/>
They collaborate, brainstorm, and come up with creative solutions to<br/>
get needs met.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Of course, I kindly remind him to brush his teeth.  Still, in<br/>
route to the upstairs bathroom, he forgets why he went upstairs.  So,<br/>
again I remind him to please brush his teeth. Sometimes, this happens<br/>
several times.  I suppose I could give up on working with him and wait<br/>
a few days until his grungy mouth bothers him as well.  I&#39;m not too<br/>
fond of that solution. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes! My son frequently forgets where he was headed / what he was<br/>
going to do and it happens with teeth brushing, too. There is much<br/>
less stress if we go to do it together. I give him a piggyback ride to<br/>
the bathroom, sometimes he brushes his teeth and sometimes he wants me<br/>
to do it. I don&#39;t mind helping him brush at all, I think it helps him<br/>
figure out the sensations and movements of what a good teeth brushing<br/>
feels like. We talk about each part of his mouth and he asks<br/>
questions, etc. Since he&#39;s fiercely independent in many ways, it&#39;s a<br/>
treat for me to be able to do something *for* him. We pause to<br/>
chit-chat and giggle. Sometimes we&#39;ll brush our teeth together or<br/>
he&#39;ll want to brush mine for me.<br/>
<br/>
If told him to go do it he&#39;d make it halfway down the hallway and<br/>
start playing. I&#39;d get frustrated, remind him again, direct him toward<br/>
the bathroom, spot him in the living room a few moments later and<br/>
discover he still hadn&#39;t brushed his teeth. I&#39;d send him down the<br/>
hallway again with my patience rapidly decreasing, and so on until<br/>
eventually I was close to yelling and all but dragging him into the<br/>
bathroom or on the verge of making threats like &quot;no bedtime story&quot;<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is a principal behind the act of teeth brushing - taking care of<br/>
ourselves so we stay healthy. Both ways are trying to meet this goal.<br/>
One way tries to figure out how to make it happen in the most joyful,<br/>
non-coercive way. There are no commands, rules or punishments<br/>
involved. It does, however, require me to be *present* and actively<br/>
engaged with him to accomplish the brushing of teeth.<br/>
<br/>
The other way is the opposite. It starts with me thinking I can issue<br/>
a command and have it obeyed and that should be the extent of my<br/>
involvement. Every time he needs redirecting my frustration level<br/>
grows because I&#39;m not suppose to have to intervene - I said &quot;do it&quot;<br/>
and that should have been it. I choose to turn it into a battle of<br/>
wills and to take his inability to complete the task on my timetable<br/>
as a sign of disrespect.<br/>
<br/>
Which way is respectful towards the child and is more pleasant for<br/>
both of us? Which way is ultimately more hands-on? Which way honors<br/>
the relationship?<br/>

aged, but not sure exactly what age), he was a major dawdler, serious<br/>
absent-minded professor syndrome (he still has some of that, but not<br/>
nearly as much, I think), and I once asked him to go get some socks on<br/>
in preparation for heading out somewhere.  (I had factored in my usual<br/>
dawdle time.)  20 minutes later, I went to see what was taking him so<br/>
long.  There he was, sitting on the floor in his pj&#39;s, playing.  He<br/>
said he had one sock on, one off, couldn&#39;t remember what he was there<br/>
for, and figured he must have been getting ready for bed.... I still<br/>
smile when I think of that!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I just played the video with him here, and asked him if that is<br/>
what he hears from me - nope.  But he still thought it was funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549595313">Whew!  You&#39;re right.  This approach is the complete opposite of <br/>
&quot;hands-off.&quot;  My first impression of your response was that it must be<br/>
incredibly time consuming to have to participate in every one of my<br/>
son&#39;s activities (assuming that teeth-brushing should by an independent<br/>
8-year-old activity.)  Then, I realized that much time & (potentially<br/>
negative) energy goes into asking & following up on whether my son<br/>
brushes his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
BTW- I just asked my son if I could help him brush his teeth.  He<br/>
laughed & said &quot;No, thank you&quot; but it&#39;s ok if I watch.   Also, both kids<br/>
have laughed through multiple viewing of the mom video.   Woohoo!  I<br/>
just asked my son why he thinks the video is funny.  His response,<br/>
&quot;because she says things you never say.&quot;  Maybe I just feel like I&#39;m<br/>
saying these things all the time.<br/>

idea of what&#39;s going on with our kids and don&#39;t see what&#39;s *really* <br/>
going on. More connection and communication is what&#39;s needed - real <br/>
communication, not just parents running our mouths off bc we&#39;re too <br/>
caught up in our own stuff to look any further. I use repetition as <br/>
a sort of &quot;red flag&quot; in my mind - if I hear myself saying the same <br/>
darn thing more than a couple times Woah-up there, Momma! Time to <br/>
stop whatever I think I&#39;m doing and pay attention to the real kin in <br/>
front of me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and members of a family that cares for each other. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a little bit of unschooling jargon for ya: &quot;autonomy&quot; is a <br/>
different thing that independence. From an unschooling standpoint, <br/>
its the ability to get needs and desires met. For very young <br/>
children/babies, we facilitate autonomy mainly by meeting their <br/>
needs directly - nursing, diaper changing, picking them up, holding <br/>
them, swinging.... all that stuff. <br/>
<br/>
As kids get older they become more able to get their needs <br/>
met &quot;independently&quot; but not all of them all the time - and they <br/>
don&#39;t want to *have* to do it by themselves all the time. So there&#39;s <br/>
a loooooooooong transitional period where supporting a kid&#39;s <br/>
autonomy is about making space for that kid to do things <br/>
independently, while still being available to help - even with <br/>
things that child *can do already*. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something that can continue right on up to adulthood - think <br/>
about it, how often do you ask another adult for help with something <br/>
you are perfectly capable of doing? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For example, my daughter counts on Mommy&#39;s wake up<br/>
&gt; call, just as I count on the morning cup of coffee my husband <br/>
&gt;provides. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, exactly. Its not about pushing independence at all costs <br/>
(eegads!).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 8-year-old son doesn&#39;t always remember to brush his teeth,<br/>
&gt; and doesn&#39;t notice any difference in how his mouth feels.  I <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bad breath when we work together.  Of course, I kindly remind him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; brush his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One alternative would be to talk about his breath without going <br/>
straight to the solution - I forget that myself and tend to go <br/>
straight to solutions. After all, my solutions are fabulous! Why <br/>
wouldn&#39;t anyone just want me to tell them what to.... oh, oops. <br/>
<br/>
Part of supporting autonomy is giving our kids the space to think of <br/>
some of those fabulous solutions on their own - the other part is <br/>
then being willing to help them problem-solve if those &quot;solutions&quot; <br/>
aren&#39;t exactly what they hoped. To use a montessori truism: &quot;kids <br/>
learn to make decisions by making decisions&quot; and that includes less <br/>
than sucessful decisions, so they can experience the whole process <br/>
*with our support* backing them up, and helping them figure out <br/>
the &quot;what now&quot;? parts. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Of course, I kindly remind him to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes, this happens several times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try starting the conversation in a different place - hey, guy, your <br/>
breath is pretty stinky in the morning, but toothbrushing seems to <br/>
be a hassle for you... can we find a better solution? If he&#39;s not <br/>
used to this kind of problem solving (if mom jumps to solutions, why <br/>
should he be?) he might need some prompting. Can you set up the <br/>
toothbrushing somewhere different? Can y&#39;all look into mouth rinses <br/>
for first thing in the morning? Gum? A tongue scraper? Maybe y&#39;all <br/>
could look into some of the causes of bad-breath together and find <br/>
yet more possibilities - like a change of night-time snacks, or more <br/>
humidity in the bedroom or a nasal rinse?  There are dozens of <br/>
possible solutions to morning breath and creating a healthier mouth <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I suppose I could give up on<br/>
&gt; working with him <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes a break *is* a valuble solution to explore. Its good <br/>
to &quot;red flag&quot; situations where you seem to come up with only two <br/>
options, though. That&#39;s often a good sign that you&#39;ve gotten stuck <br/>
in your thinking - and a good opportunity to go to your kids and <br/>
say &quot;hey, I can&#39;t figure this one out, lets put our heads together&quot;. <br/>
And if that doesn&#39;t work, well, that&#39;s one of the things these <br/>
boards are great for - seeing a bunch of different perspectives and <br/>
possibilities. <br/>

It can be time consuming to help kids figure out this life thing <br/>
(its complicated) - but its not really any more time consuming in <br/>
the long run than all the pushing and prodding and follow-up and <br/>
whatnot. And its soooooo much less stressful, once you get the hang <br/>
of it (yes, there is a learning curve!). It pays for itself in <br/>
happiness. <br/>
<br/>
I would far far far rather bring Mo several plates of bite-sized <br/>
munchies throughout the day (just as an example) *and* clean up the <br/>
occasional spills from her getting her own snacks than have the kind <br/>
of hassle I see my gf go through with her dd - &quot;its time to eat, put <br/>
that away so we can eat, do it now, eat all of it, three more bites, <br/>
that was half a bite so still three more, no I didn&#39;t bring a snack, <br/>
why didn&#39;t you eat more at lunch?&quot; Yikes. <br/>
<br/>
And yet I still get the company of my kid at dinner - even if she&#39;s <br/>
not hungry she wants to sit with us and be friendly. Why wouldn&#39;t <br/>
she? We haven&#39;t made eating together a chore to be slogged through <br/>
every day so its something to look forward to. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m starting to sound like an advertising slogan, so I&#39;ll <br/>
stop ;) <br/>
