<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760672001">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My oldest, Christian/11, has been &#39;regressing&#39; some with his rages <br/>
lately. Since we&#39;ve taken on this unschooling lifestyle, we had seen <br/>
less and less of these episodes. For the past two weeks or so, he&#39;s <br/>
been digging his heels in, argumentative, and tough to be around ~ <br/>
When he&#39;s in &#39;a mood&#39;. I&#39;ve been giving him choices, setting him <br/>
free from the expectations we used to have, and remaining calm. The <br/>
only thing I&#39;m taking up with him is that it&#39;s not ok to be nasty to <br/>
his brother (demeaning, insulting, etc) or anyone else. Once the <br/>
episode has passed and he&#39;s back to himself, he apologizes profusely <br/>
and will say &quot;I don&#39;t know why I acted that way. I&#39;m sorry&quot; <br/>
<br/>
.. I&#39;m getting to my point here... <br/>
Today, we went to a good friend&#39;s birthday party. Christian had <br/>
decided to go and there were lots of friends of this girl and her <br/>
cousins there. Christian stayed back and to himself while I was <br/>
watching the kids in the pool. It was wild, rambunctious play and <br/>
he&#39;s not always comfortable in those types of intense situations. He <br/>
then came up to the pool, watched what was going on and decided he <br/>
wanted in! I was kind of surprised, briefed him on what may happen <br/>
when he&#39;s in the pool, he was ok with that and he joined in. <br/>
<br/>
Long story .. ok, LONG.. LOL he had a great day with little, if any, <br/>
altercations and he didn&#39;t lose his cool. Lots of times he&#39;ll feel <br/>
the play very personal and then turn it into a vendetta type thing <br/>
and he feels very unreachable to me then. That didn&#39;t happen. He had <br/>
a wonderful day, interacted and enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
He did fall apart a little on the way home but it was short lived, <br/>
he apologized and we were home in no time to fix the situation (he <br/>
was very upset to have to sit in a wet bathing suit for the 5 minute <br/>
ride home)<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting at is that it&#39;s nice to watch this lifestyle in <br/>
action, working. Tomorrow, we&#39;re going to the RI shore with friends <br/>
and we are all looking forward to it. Just a note: He apologizes on <br/>
his own. There&#39;s no guilting or expectation of an apology.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
Tonya</div>

Sometimes I have found that when my kids seem off-kilter and argumentative<br/>
or difficult that they are going through some kind of transition and as<br/>
difficult as they seem, they need more touch and hugs, attention and<br/>
understanding.  That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s ok to treat people badly, but if<br/>
I can step back and see what&#39;s really going on and try to infuse that child<br/>
with a lot of love and attention for a while (after setting things right<br/>
with the child that was wronged first) that it helps to avoid further<br/>
conflict.  Perhaps when you sense he&#39;s getting like that you can try to<br/>
spend a lot of time with him and give lots of hugs etc. Acknowledging that<br/>
it can be difficult to be them sometimes helps too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Angela, that is so very insightful.  It&#39;s SO much like when our babies<br/>
were babies and they would have a &quot;fussy crying irritable nothing<br/>
pacifies them but the breast (maybe)&quot; sort of day.  This was usually<br/>
followed by some profound developmental change - a word comprehension,<br/>
crawling, sitting up, walking, a motor skill refinement, etc.  It<br/>
seems logical that this would continue into &quot;kidhood&quot; and &quot;teendom&quot; as<br/>
well.   I&#39;ve seen it often in Emily, who as a baby was the one that<br/>
had the most &quot;off kilter&quot; days.  AS a teen she will have days where<br/>
she just seems totally irritable and inconsolable.  Seems like the<br/>
following day she has made some leap in maturity or some philosophical<br/>
epiphany.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Angela, for this. I was just reminding a friend of mine <br/>
this the other day! Funny how other people can see in clearer than you <br/>
can see within. He&#39;s still very much all over the radar with emotions <br/>
lately. I&#39;m going to make more of an effort to Be with him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
