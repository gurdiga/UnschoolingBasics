<div id="ygrps-yiv-310967906">I haven&#39;t posted on here before, but I wanted to jump in on this thread. I agree with the person who said that your DD might not be ready for playgroups. In my experience, kids that are hitting other kids are feeling anxious about the situation. A book I would recommend is Magical Parent; Magical Child. The author states that kids really don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; playmates until around age 7, I think. I believe that same age playgroups are about the same as same age classrooms-ii is unnatural. This is probably why your DD is ok in a group of older children. <br/>
<br/>
As far as hitting your DH, I would tend to think that she is angry with him. I would try to discover why this is. Did she agree to have him finish brushing her teeth?Maybe she felt she didn&#39;t have a choice, so her way of letting him know was to hit him? I would help her with feeling words to describe what is going on. Alot of observation on your part will probably help too. Personally, I would stop the playdates with same age kids, and try to get your need for adult stimulation met in another way for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
hope this helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d guess he&#39;s big and strong and just picks her up and does things  <br/>
to her, like brush her teeth. I wouldn&#39;t like it, either - I&#39;d be  <br/>
hitting and screaming, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are physically controlled, or ordered around, become either  <br/>
apathetic or resistant --- not cooperative or competent. Sounds like  <br/>
she&#39;s a &quot;resister&quot; -- good for her. It is a challenge to your husband  <br/>
to find other ways of being with her.<br/>
<br/>
WHILE figuring that out, if I was him, I wouldn&#39;t let her hit me at  <br/>
all. He should probably just remove himself from the situation the  <br/>
minute she hits - hitting ends the game, hitting ends the activity,  <br/>
whatever it is. He could very gently and kindly get up and walk a few  <br/>
steps away.  Something simple like that - interrupt the flow. I think  <br/>
when a kid is being physically aggressive TO another person, even a  <br/>
parent, it is good to put some space between you - to stop the  <br/>
physicality right away, before engaging with words. You can move  <br/>
right back with a hug - but I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to just  <br/>
sit there and &quot;take it&quot; while trying to communicate with words.<br/>
