<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438656399">&quot;How do I sell Pensacola to a<br/>
guy who hates humidity?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well first of all, it ISN&#39;T very humid in October at all. It&#39;s a <br/>
rather pleasant humidity, with balmy 75 degree days and cooler 55-60 <br/>
degree nights (typically).<br/>
Bugs are a non-issue at the beach, where the conference will be <br/>
held. I&#39;ve never been bit by a mosquito down there. Now my backyard <br/>
with the marsh behind it? That&#39;s a different story.:)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the conference is held indoors, with AC!! No humidity <br/>
there. I guess even October would seem humid to a guy that likes <br/>
desert DRY...yucky for me. His skin will look a lot nicer <br/>
here...yeah, tell him that, I bet that would sell a guy. lol<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, there aren&#39;t many places in the world I&#39;d rather be <br/>
in October, than Pensacola FL. The weather is SO ideal and the ocean <br/>
still swimable. There&#39;s a lot to do and the beaches here are SO nice.<br/>
If the conference itself can&#39;t overcome his hesitations though, I <br/>
don&#39;t know what else to say. Meeting over 300 unschoolers is reason <br/>
enough for me.<br/>
