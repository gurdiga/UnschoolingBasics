<div id="ygrps-yiv-685271183">During the last Unschooling Carnival (a carnival is a collection of <br/>
blog posts from different bloggers on one topic), two questions were <br/>
asked:<br/>
<br/>
1. Unschooling feels, sounds or appears like a good philosophy to <br/>
follow, but ________ prevent me (or make me hesitant to) follow <br/>
through with it. <br/>
<br/>
2. Unschooling my child(ren) has enabled me to see ________ <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I answered. I&#39;d love to hear what all of you would <br/>
answer to one or both of these questions. I didn&#39;t answer the first <br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
I changed the wording from &quot;has enabled&quot; to &quot;is enabling&quot; because it <br/>
seems to fit me better. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling my children is enabling me to see that learning is <br/>
everywhere. The more they are out of school, the more I see the <br/>
curiosity and spark in their eyes. <br/>
Unschooling my children is enabling me to see that learning is fun <br/>
and enjoyable. Learning is not filling in a bubble on a test. <br/>
Learning is not being told to memorize a bunch of facts that they <br/>
could very easily find, in a matter of minutes, online or in a book. <br/>
Unschooling my children is enabling me to see that their interests <br/>
and passions are valid and important. <br/>
Unschooling my children is enabling me to see them...for all they <br/>
are and all they can become.<br/>
Unschooling my children his enabling me to see that life really is <br/>
for living and exploring and singing and creating and discovering <br/>
and trying and doing and being. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>2. Unschooling my children has enabled me to see my children for Who They Are right NOW rather than focusing on who I need to mold them into for the future. It has enabled me to live in the moment with my family without fear. I can appreciate the beauty of what my children *do* know, while still helping them experience the things that are new for them. Unschooling has empowered me to question the answers instead of only answering the questions. It has enabled me to learn from every experience without being afraid of failing. There is no failure in unschooling. There is only learning from any misteps and moving forward. Unschooling is the journey, not the destination.<br/>

green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713413808">Well I&#39;m a newbie but what the heck...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is sitting back and watching the movie... to watch what<br/>
will happen without deliberate teaching or scheduling of lessons, or<br/>
even propososition of topics.<br/>
<br/>
It means spending your money on a home library and art supplies<br/>
instead of textbooks and tuition.<br/>
<br/>
It means giving your kids the freedom to make their own decisions.<br/>
They will make mistakes that will provide much better lessons than any<br/>
lecture, and they will gain a sense of empowerment unlike any external<br/>
acknowledgment.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really what you want isn&#39;t it?  To see your children grow up to<br/>
have the ability to confidently decide what is best, to seek out<br/>
knowledge independently, and to work toward goals that will allow them<br/>
the lifestyles they desire.  Just consider yourself along for the<br/>
ride, on a train if you like, but not as the driver.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to be the one for young minds to bounce their questions<br/>
off of, to listen as they make observations about the world, to be by<br/>
their sides as they surpass your skills and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me recently if I intended to put my kids in school &#39;some<br/>
day&#39; - I responded by saying &quot;Never Ever&quot;  This experience is too<br/>
rewarding to give away.  But, I&#39;ll tell you, during a recent round of<br/>
&quot;I want to go to school&quot;, I finally consented and gave full<br/>
unconditional permission for them to explore this fantasy they<br/>
imagine.  After several days, my son came back and announced that he<br/>
would prefer to homeschool.   I was so sad to have given this<br/>
permission, but so empowered when the decision to continue came from<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Salam,<br/>
