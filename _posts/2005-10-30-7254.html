<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528779407">I prefer to be a little more &quot;in your face&quot; about being an <br/>
unschooler; not that I am rude or anything, just bold.  I love that <br/>
quote: Well behaved women never made history.  I believe that I can <br/>
make the most change in the world by being outspoken about it, it <br/>
gives people food for thought.  That is just my personality though, <br/>
more than anything.  I also now have the back of my van COVERED with <br/>
bumper stickers that give people food for thought, at least some of <br/>
them probably go home and google unschooling!  I have actually had a <br/>
lot of people move toward unschooling because I am so loud about it <br/>
and that is the greatest thing!!!!!  One of my older friends (in her <br/>
70&#39;s), whose husband was a college professer, says that he used to <br/>
complain about how we coerce kids to &quot;learn&quot; when there is never <br/>
really any learning to be had, he would tell her how kids REALLY <br/>
learned and she said he was basically describing unschooling.  She <br/>
is always telling me how lucky my kids are!  I am also lucky because <br/>
I live in Alaska (for 7 more weeks anyway) and there are no <br/>
homeschool laws so no one really cares what you do, and there are <br/>
TONS of very relaxed homeschoolers so unschooling isn&#39;t too far of a <br/>
reach for most people.  When I do get raised eyebrows I always have <br/>
a come-back and a fierce argument for the pros of unschooling so <br/>
most people give up fairly quickly.  Last week, after a heated <br/>
unschooling v. public schooling debate, the conversation drifted <br/>
towards the school schedule and testing.  The comment was made that <br/>
the schedule was changed so that all testing could be done before <br/>
Christmas so that the kids wouldn&#39;t forget what they had &quot;learned&quot; <br/>
before testing.  I just piped up and said &quot;Well that pretty much <br/>
cements my argument because they didn&#39;t really LEARN it in the first <br/>
place then, did they?&quot;  The entire room was REALLY quiet (you could <br/>
have heard crickets chirping if we had any around) and I kind of <br/>
think that they won&#39;t argue with me about unschooling anymore. I am <br/>
always very nice about it though, I just give people my <br/>
thoughts :) :)  I have inspired a number of people to research <br/>
unschooling farther and a few have made the transition  and those <br/>
that didn&#39;t are at least a little more open minded about it, those <br/>
are the greatest moments for me!  I completely understand the closet <br/>
thing though because it can sometimes exhaust a person to explain, <br/>
every time, why you do things different; it is always a few hour <br/>
conversation, ya know!?  Don&#39;t forget to set clocks back one hour!!<br/>

LOL... I just had 2 old college friends email me and ask me, among other  <br/>
&quot;how are you&#39;s&quot;, how homeschooling was going. Now, everytime people ask this,  <br/>
especially the ones I know that are a bit &quot;ignorant&quot; of it, I cringe. But, this  <br/>
time, instead of answering a typical &quot;fine&quot;, I went into a somewhat elaborate <br/>
 discussion about &quot;unschooling&quot; (without calling it unschooling) and how I <br/>
was  enjoying watching my son&#39;s reading ability flourish on it&#39;s own, and how my <br/>
 daughter&#39;s artwork is becoming more and more detailed and how the baby is  <br/>
picking up on vocabulary and learning her boundaries of herself.... <br/>
DH was laughing at me doing that. One friend is a mother of one girl, that  <br/>
is in between my oldest 2 in age, and thinks she is the ultimate  &quot;expert&quot; on <br/>
parenting, and tries to &quot;tsk tsk&quot; me. My other friend is marrying a  man with 2 <br/>
pre-teen daughters and has suddenly become the biggest &quot;mommy expert&quot;  as <br/>
well. Both are very structured people, so me homeschooling period, is &quot;weird&quot;  to <br/>
them.<br/>
But, I  had fun with my emails to them! LOL  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632941215">Well, I usually don&#39;t get questions quite that broad, usually they <br/>
will make a &quot;schooly&quot; comment and I will have a comeback to make <br/>
them think about their statement and then it seems to drift to the <br/>
unschooling philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
I usually always start by telling them that kids naturally want to <br/>
learn about the world around them but when we force or coerce them <br/>
they lose that natural curiousity and desire to learn.  They learned <br/>
how to crawl, walk, talk without coercing (in most cases), why <br/>
wouldn&#39;t they learn other things the same way?  <br/>
<br/>
I also ask people how much they remember from what they learned in <br/>
school?  I usually get blank stares and &quot;Not much&quot; or they will only <br/>
remember the things they were interested in, that usually gets them <br/>
thinking.  Sometimes with homeschoolers I will hear things about <br/>
them getting tutors for higher math and such and I will ask &quot;Well, <br/>
if you learned it in school then why can&#39;t you teach them?&quot;  And I <br/>
will get a reply like &quot;Well, I don&#39;t remember that stuff.&quot;  Exactly <br/>
my point, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
You can read the little blurb I have on my website about <br/>
unschooling, let me know what you think www.5freebirds.com , click <br/>
on about us tab.  Most people I talk to want to learn more about <br/>
unschooling, which is really cool.  I have only talked to a handful <br/>
of people that think I am just weird and ruining my kids.  Anyone <br/>
that knows my kids though don&#39;t worry too much.  I have almost all <br/>
of my unschooling books loaned out because so many people are <br/>
curious and I think that is wonderful!  <br/>

of my van.  Not all my bumper stickers are unschooling ones but they <br/>
mirror the philosophy in some way.  I get lots of stares and people <br/>
pulling close to my van to read!<br/>

trim. I was sitting nearby in case anything needed clarification (how <br/>
much to remove, etc). The beautician asked DS how old he was so he <br/>
answered 7. Then the obvious next question What grade are you in? He <br/>
said &quot;we homeschool&quot; as if that sums it all up. So she turned to me <br/>
(as we had been chatting here and there) and said &quot;So you teach him?&quot; <br/>
and I said (pleasant smile on my face, wicked grin in my mind) &quot;Nope&quot; <br/>
and she said &quot;Oh&quot; and went back to cutting hair (I could tell she was <br/>
confused). In other times and other places this usually leads to more <br/>
discussion but there just wasn&#39;t the time or interest this time.<br/>

and, as I got to the doorway, his teacher was telling another little <br/>
boy that DS is homeschooled and that his Daddy teaches him. DS <br/>
said &quot;Well, that&#39;s not exactly what we do. I teach myself by doing <br/>
stuff.&quot; Then he noticed me and headed out of the room. As he dashed by <br/>
me to get downstairs to &quot;our spot&quot; I told his teacher He&#39;s exactly <br/>
right, we don&#39;t do schooltime or anything. And then headed down to sit <br/>
with DS. I told DS that he explained that quite well.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, DS is probably a better spokesperson for unschooling than <br/>
us adults in some ways.<br/>
