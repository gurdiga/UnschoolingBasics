<div id="ygrps-yiv-799365239">&quot;I&#39;ve just registered www.livefreelearnfree.com. It should be online<br/>
within the next few days. If all goes as planned, you should be<br/>
able to subscribe through the website, as well as order single<br/>
issues, email submissions, find out more about the goals of the<br/>
magazine, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your timing is absolutely beautiful Shana! I could just kiss you!!:)<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to send something in or support the magazine in <br/>
whatever way I can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the kind words!  :o)  What we need most, right now, are <br/>
submissions.  The more, the merrier.  :o)  If you don&#39;t have <br/>
anything to say about socialization (the theme of the first issue), <br/>
don&#39;t worry.  Part of the magazine will be devoted to what works or <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for unschoolers, and I&#39;m treating that as a very broad <br/>
category: typical day, resources, learning styles, etc., etc., etc.  <br/>
And, if anyone you know likes to write, pass this on.  It&#39;s starting <br/>
to take off and it&#39;s looking like everyone&#39;s going to have a lot to <br/>
say in the first issue!<br/>
