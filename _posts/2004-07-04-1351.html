<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312130784">I&#39;d like to announce that our third child was born this Monday!  He <br/>
is a welcome addition to our family and the girls (3 & 5yo) just love <br/>
him.  We are recovering, resting and adjusting.  I have been <br/>
surprised at how well big sisters are doing.  They have been very <br/>
accepting and understanding (almost ambivalent!) to the amount of <br/>
time I am devoting to the baby&#39;s needs.  <br/>
<br/>
We are slowing moving toward a new daily routines, and today it <br/>
crossed my mind that right now is indeed a test run of the <br/>
unschooling life for us!  The girls have had more freedom than ever <br/>
this week, and I have been experiencing some separation anxiety of <br/>
sorts, I think.  Younger dd has been playing on her own and doing <br/>
things I didn&#39;t know she could.  She put herself to sleep, naked<br/>
on the couch at 11pm (gasp!) the other night. That same night, older <br/>
dd watched unlimited videos (gasp!) and pretended to be an exotic <br/>
animal she saw on Zoobomafoo eating bugs out of the dirt for over two <br/>
hours  They have been eating when they want, if they want, and <br/>
playing in the fenced backyard at will, wearing what they want.  And <br/>
everyone is happy but me  I have been feeling so out of sync and <br/>
almost unneeded!<br/>
<br/>
Ethan seems to be much needier than the girls were.  He is very sweet <br/>
but not content unless he is nursing.  If his eyes are open, he wants <br/>
to be in my arms and on the breast or he vehemently complains!  He <br/>
seems to need much comforting, and it is quite different for us in <br/>
this respect, as dds were very laid back and content.  They would <br/>
nurse and be happy to hang out in the bouncer or swing when <br/>
necessary.  They also slept well in the crib, which brother will have <br/>
no part of!  He has been in our bed from day one, which is fine other <br/>
than that our bed is only a full size.  He is sleeping well at night, <br/>
thank goodness, or I would really be struggling.  It has been <br/>
draining to keep up with the nursing to say the least.  I am sure <br/>
that my milk is in and flowing.  He is swallowing and passing lots of <br/>
stool.  I am wondering if this neediness is temperament or a phase?  <br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear how others have fared on their journeys as their <br/>
families have grown. <br/>

I ordered one online last night!  I have one that i bought for my <br/>

try another kind.  Hope I can get the baby positioned in there easier!<br/>

What you wrote above described my DS and he was my firstborn.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t already have a sling order one online today!  :)  It saved my <br/>
sanity and it kept him content and peaceful.  I bought a Maya Wrap <br/>
sling <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayawrap.com">http://www.mayawrap.com</a> and LOVED it.  I used it around the house <br/>
while doing dishes, vacuuming, etc.;  on outings and vacations it was a <br/>
&quot;must&quot; for me -- can&#39;t walk wooded trails or sandy beaches or explore <br/>
caves with a stroller!  Also, grocery shopping with a newborn is very <br/>
cumbersome if you bring in the &quot;baby bucket&quot; car seat -- then you have <br/>
no room for your groceries!  LOL  What I&#39;m saying is that it was a <br/>
valuable tool and I recommend them to all Mamas with wee ones because <br/>
it keeps your arms free, baby is safe/secure/content and they can nurse <br/>
any ol&#39; time they want because they&#39;re already there -- just lift your <br/>
top a little and voila!  :)<br/>
<br/>
As far as his neediness being a phase....could be, but I think you <br/>
&quot;know&quot; your baby right from the beginning.  ;)  My DS was like that and <br/>
at 5yo still is more needy of me than my 3yo DD.  HTH<br/>
<br/>
Congrats again!<br/>

<br/>
Hi Melissa.  Blessings to you and your new, improved family!<br/>
<br/>
Your sweet post brought me right back to the day when I went into labor for my second child.  My oldest child, Jake (then 3) was sleeping in bed, and I went in and laid by him, held him, and cried my eyes out.  I knew our relationship would forever be changed.  Not necessarily in a bad way, but things would definitely be different in the morning when he had a new brother.<br/>
<br/>
***And everyone is happy but me - I have been feeling so out of sync and almost unneeded!***<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely let everyone else know that you miss them and that you would love to be by them!  Ask them to bring a book that you can snuggle up and read together while nursing the new babe...find other snuggly, connecting things to do where the focus is not on the new baby, but on your connection with your older children (even just snuggling next to each other, watching TV, whispering secrets, taking turns drawing silly things on a sketch pad...).<br/>
<br/>
***Ethan seems to be much needier than the girls were.  He is very sweet <br/>
but not content unless he is nursing.  If his eyes are open, he wants <br/>
to be in my arms and on the breast or he vehemently complains!  He <br/>
seems to need much comforting***<br/>
<br/>
This was my first-born.  <br/>
<br/>
With Jake it was his intense awareness of the world that made him *needy*...he is highly sensitive and it&#39;s a lot for a little infant to handle, being born into this world and all (;-)!  The sensory issues that the outside world carried were too much for him, and he needed to retreat to the safe reassurance of his loving mother&#39;s breast much of the time.<br/>
<br/>
We respected and honored his requests and gave him what he needed...and because of this, it was him that introduced us to unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
He definitely required more energy than my second child, Sam, but giving him what he needed and required in life allowed him to feel valid and to learn to feel safe in asking for what he needed.<br/>
<br/>
***They also slept well in the crib, which brother will have no part of!***<br/>
<br/>
Jake always slept with us.  Sam never had a crib, and when we would go to those baby stores, he would ask to get into the crib...he would lay there and look at the mobile...it was so funny!<br/>
<br/>
But we all shared a bed...in our old home we had one L-O-N-G bedroom with a double and two twins pushed together.  When we built our new house, I still slept with Sam because he wasn&#39;t ready to be on his own...he&#39;s 10 now and sleeping well on his own, but we still love to cuddle together once in awhile!<br/>
<br/>
***It has been draining to keep up with the nursing to say the least.***<br/>
<br/>
It is exhausting, isn&#39;t it?  But oh, so worth it.  He is still so very new to the world, and it&#39;s all so overwhelming for him.  He feels safe and secure on your breast and when he&#39;s ready to emerge and check out the rest of the world, he will, as long as he knows he can retreat back to his safe place when he needs it!  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you all ~<br/>
Anne<br/>

    My fourth was very much like your third.  He was and is still (1.5) so<br/>
much more needy than the others.  He didn&#39;t want to breast feed for longer<br/>
than 1 year, but still insists on squeezing my boobs like he&#39;s testing<br/>
melons for freshness before he can go to sleep.  Try to enjoy it.  The<br/>
closeness I mean.  Sometimes you can feel as if all you are is a source of<br/>
nourishment, which is an important, but sometimes you feel lost in it all.<br/>
It passes and becomes less overwhelming in a very short amount of time.  I<br/>
just had to keep reminding my self to eat well and to remember my other kids<br/>
especially my third.  My third son is such a loving gentle soul that he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t say anything even if he was getting left out.  I needed to be sure<br/>
to pick up on the slightest of clues and give him the extra time he needed.<br/>
    Congratulations on your third.  It&#39;s great having many little ones<br/>
around.  I honestly don&#39;t know if I am done having kids yet or not.<br/>

the baby being more needy than his siblings.  The thought came to mind that<br/>
maybe he would benefit from omega 3 fatty acids.  There is a lot of research<br/>
being done about how it effects transmitters in the brain.  It was just a<br/>
thought, but I attached it to the wrong e-mail.<br/>

Interesting you bring this up.  My midwife just recommended that I <br/>
take a supplement with omega 3 fatty acids while I am breastfeeding...<br/>
