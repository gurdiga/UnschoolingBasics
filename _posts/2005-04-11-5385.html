<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163350948">&quot;Kids forget <br/>
how to be kids. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or aren&#39;t allowed to act naturally, as children know how to do.<br/>
Then they come to me as adults, asking how to bring more creativity <br/>
into their lives, how to tap into that childlike way of being....and <br/>
I charge them money and they can re-learn what they really knew all <br/>
along at a creativity course!! <br/>
<br/>
As much as it brings me joy to help people re-claim their creative <br/>
genius selves, it saddens me to think that it was there all along <br/>
and our society does such an amazing job of making people feel like <br/>
poor artists, &quot;bad&quot; in math etc....<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are giving their children the chance to avoid all that <br/>
baggage and just BE. How beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I decided a long time ago, that if ALL my children get out of this <br/>
homeschooling thing is the ability to love learning, the ability to <br/>
really be comfortable in their own skin, then it was exactly the <br/>
lifestyle for us. I didn&#39;t care if they learned one BIT of &quot;math&quot; as <br/>
long as they knew they COULD learn it at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? They do learn mathy stuff all the time. They don&#39;t have <br/>
labels for all their bits of learning, it&#39;s just stuff they&#39;re <br/>
interested in. They shock me constantly with knowing things I don&#39;t <br/>
know, or showing me new ways to look at things.....I suppose I <br/>
should be used to it, but my schooled mind is still amazed at how <br/>
incredible learning unfolds without a SINGLE lesson.<br/>
<br/>
As to the baseball analogy, I wasn&#39;t the person that originally came <br/>
up with the example...though I probably used it at some point.:)<br/>
<br/>
Was that you Pam?<br/>
<br/>
Hearing how they really are &quot;teaching&quot; baseball in school now makes <br/>
me want to laugh and cry at the same time. What&#39;s next, bike riding? <br/>
They&#39;ll find a way to suck joy out of anything, won&#39;t they?<br/>

Thanks for this thought Ren, yet another way to describe what I&#39;m <br/>
discovering about unschooling..... put into words that aren&#39;t ready <br/>
(yet) to flow out of my brain on their own.....<br/>
