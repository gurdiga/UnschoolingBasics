<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011198267">I love TV.  <br/>
<br/>
I really liked Sesame street and Reading Rainbow when Dylan was little<br/>
but Dylan wasn&#39;t interested in them.  When he was three or so he finally<br/>
told me he really thought Sesame Street was just for babies.   I still<br/>
watched it and sometimes if I&#39;m flipping through the channels and come<br/>
across Sesame Street I watch even now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Though I had the TV on a lot in the days when he was little he didn&#39;t<br/>
watch.  It was his choice, he just wasn&#39;t interested.  But when he was<br/>
nearly four and had a fast growing love of dinosaurs TNT came out with<br/>
&quot;Monster Vision&quot; and Dylan discovered Godzilla!  Ah.  He was in heaven.  <br/>
Godzilla movies lead to other monster movies.  By the time he was six or<br/>
so he&#39;d seen every terrible old Japanese and Korean monster movie we<br/>
could lay our hands on. <br/>
<br/>
He also watched Lost in Space, on the Sci-fi channel and old episodes of<br/>
Star Trek.  He watched Next Generation and Deep Space Nine and Voyager<br/>
for the one season we were able to get it.  <br/>
<br/>
Science fiction lead to old horror movies and he started a collection of<br/>
Werewolf and Vampire and Mummy videos.   He loved horror and read his<br/>
first Stephen King stories when he was seven or eight. <br/>
<br/>
I had more than one talk with our librarian and the lady at the video<br/>
store about what he was &quot;allowed&quot; to check out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He has always been free to choose what he wanted to watch and *if* he<br/>
wanted to watch and I&#39;ve never known him to watch something just because<br/>
it was on.  He leaves the room if someone is watching something he&#39;s not<br/>
interested in.   He has rented movies and turned them off when they<br/>
weren&#39;t what he thought they were.  He absolutely knows what he wants to<br/>
see and what he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time when he was little that he believed every advertisement<br/>
he saw on TV.  We used to joke that if he ever found the shopping channel<br/>
we&#39;d have to hide the credit cards. &lt;g&gt;  He would excitedly tell us we<br/>
needed the Downey Ball or some gizmo or fantastic cleaner.  During the<br/>
time he was discovering advertising we talked about the products.  Why we<br/>
did or didn&#39;t need them.  We did try some things that were advertised and<br/>
found them not to be as appealing as they&#39;d been portrayed in the ads.  <br/>
Some things we liked a lot but some really were a waste of money. <br/>
<br/>
He saw the Hot Wheels Volcano Blowout race track set advertised on TV. <br/>
He wanted one so badly and we found out they were over fifty dollars.  We<br/>
saved for it and he put away some of his own money until he had enough<br/>
and we drove the eighty something miles to the store and he brought it<br/>
home.  It broke within the first few days.  The little pegs that held the<br/>
volcano together snapped off and the track and volcano would come apart<br/>
every time a car went through.   It was heartbreaking.   But we wrote our<br/>
complaint to the company and though it took quite a long time he was<br/>
satisfied with the way they resolved the issue. <br/>
<br/>
His discovery of and understanding of advertising came about really<br/>
naturally through exposure and experience.  The same way he learned to<br/>
tie his shoes and read, he learned about advertising.   Not in some<br/>
vacuum of TV land but in his home, with his mom and dad answering<br/>
questions and offering help and ideas.  He understood the psychology<br/>
behind advertising at a very young age and he understood the reason for<br/>
advertising and more importantly he understood he wasn&#39;t the victim of<br/>
anyone or anything but that he had the power to assess the information<br/>
and examine a product and *return* a product if it didn&#39;t meet his<br/>
expectation.    He&#39;s been an empowered, informed consumer for over half<br/>
his life now and I know some adults who aren&#39;t there yet.   I believe<br/>
it&#39;s because he had the freedom to explore this important topic early on<br/>
with the help of his parents.  I believe it&#39;s because understanding is a<br/>
process and we didn&#39;t try to hurry it and we didn&#39;t shut it down, by<br/>
limiting TV,  when it didn&#39;t happen immediately. <br/>
<br/>
Like riding a bike or going potty on the toilet or anything else our<br/>
children learn, learning the ways of the economy and consumerism comes to<br/>
people gradually through experience.  I feel it&#39;s much better that Dylan<br/>
had the opportunity to learn these things while he was home with us and<br/>
where spending his life savings on something which turned out to be a<br/>
disappointment was a matter of fifty dollars instead of fifty thousand.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dylan is twelve now but has always had the freedom to watch anything he<br/>
wanted.  That doesn&#39;t mean we left him alone in the room with the TV and<br/>
left him to work things out on his own.  We helped him.  We explained<br/>
that movies weren&#39;t real, that people were pretending to but hurt or sick<br/>
or mean and that it was like a game and no one really got injured.  We<br/>
acted some things out ourselves.  We watched video about the making of<br/>
movies so he could see how some things were made to look realistic.    We<br/>
talked about  the characters and why someone would act mean or why<br/>
someone would steal or hurt others.  We talked about what makes a story<br/>
good and interesting and why we like certain characters even if they<br/>
don&#39;t seem very nice. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan can recognize formulas in moves and TV programs and predict what<br/>
will occur with astounding accuracy.  He can tell you which characters<br/>
have to die in the end and why.  He is almost never surprised by movies<br/>
but he loves them and loves to analyze them.  He recognizes plot lines<br/>
he&#39;s seen before and saw very early on how many of the old Star Trek<br/>
episode were based on Shakespeare plays.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to say this about putting parental fears about TV into<br/>
perspective.  I came to realize that the people my son talked to<br/>
everyday, the real people in his life were capable of saying  and doing<br/>
things that were far more hurtful and damaging than anything an actor<br/>
pretending on TV could say or do.  Dylan understood the reason actors did<br/>
what they did, to earn a pay check, to tell a story, etc.  But it was<br/>
often harder to tell him why his Grandfather was mean or why his friend<br/>
was being hit by his mom.   The woman across the street who locked her<br/>
kids out of the house after school so they wouldn&#39;t eat all the food was<br/>
a bigger concern to me than any pretend scenario involving a chain saw in<br/>
the movies.   Real world things are troubling and have no easy answers<br/>
but pretend is just pretend.  I&#39;m still more concerned about the damage<br/>
my mother can do with her thoughtless comments about how terrible men are<br/>
than I will ever be about a werewolf attack or a Mafia hit or a car crash<br/>
on TV.  <br/>
<br/>
And here it gets bigger.  I&#39;m more concerned with the damage *I* can do<br/>
by not respecting my son&#39;s ability to learn and grow and process<br/>
information.  I&#39;m more concerned with the damage I can do by not<br/>
respecting his choices and his abilities.   I&#39;m here to help him live in<br/>
the world of humans and that word includes TV and advertising and rotten<br/>
neighbors and warped old grannies.  I can help him be empowered or I can<br/>
make him afraid and small and I fear making him afraid or paranoid or<br/>
small more than I&#39;ll ever fear a movie about pretend bad guys doing<br/>
pretend bad things. <br/>

PAM PUT THIS ON THE HIGHLIGHTS PLEASE!!!!!  -smile-<br/>
<br/>
This is a wonderful summation of the benefits, not just of media freedom,<br/>
but of all the freedoms living in the real world give.  Thank you for<br/>
sharing it.<br/>
