it does anger me, but it&#39;s not a good way to make a point.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it is fine to point out that downloading pirated movies is<br/>
&gt; illegal,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The even bigger issue wrapped around the illegality is that piracy  <br/>
has become so easy and common place that it&#39;s taken on a feeling that  <br/>
it must be okay. But it&#39;s not. It is stealing regardless of how easy  <br/>
and common it is. If people are going to choose to steal, they should  <br/>
at least be making a conscious choice to do so!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but it is also illegal to lend someone a dvd.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not. You can&#39;t show it in your home and charge people to  <br/>
watch it. You can&#39;t make copies (with some exceptions) and definitely  <br/>
can&#39;t give those copies, even when it&#39;s okay to copy for your own  <br/>
use, to others. But you can lend it out. Libraries would be out of  <br/>
business if they couldn&#39;t lend copyrighted material!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know I can&#39;t throw any stones.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one should be throwing stones even at spankers on a list dedicated  <br/>
to peaceful parenting. But it makes the issue a lot clearer to point  <br/>
out that spanking is hitting. It&#39;s a large person hitting a small  <br/>
person. And it makes the issue clearer to point out that these sites  <br/>
aren&#39;t for free movie watching. They&#39;re for letting people steal  <br/>
other&#39;s property.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ideas of undermining<br/>
&gt; corporate  acquisition and division of wealth don&#39;t seem so out of<br/>
&gt; line to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when we compromise our own principles to reach a goal, it  <br/>
diminishes the meaning of those principles. Stealing because someone  <br/>
disagrees with corporate morality is still stealing. Does that mean  <br/>
no one should ever question whether it&#39;s appropriate to let a  <br/>
principle go to reach a goal? It will totally be up to the  <br/>
individual. But they should at least be aware of and honest about  <br/>
what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
