<div id="ygrps-yiv-287876341">Hello, all. Something I read the other day from Sandra Dodd (I think) has been worrying me-- about how all learning is making connections but if your child is unhappy or angry then that&#39;s what she&#39;s connecting with (to loosely and badly paraphrase ;-)). Well, my daughter gets angry and unhappy a LOT, and I&#39;ve been kind of slogging through the days and trying to remain patient. But I don&#39;t want to go on like this if there&#39;s something I can do to make my daughter&#39;s life happier. She&#39;s seven, so I try to tell myself it&#39;s an age thing; but it&#39;s always been like this to some degree. We live in a fairly rural area, but have museums, etc. not too far away. My daughter has tried and quit many sports and arts activities, and doesn&#39;t like anyone in our local homeschool group. We have videogame systems, lots of books and toys, pets, and my daughter has my attention all day and then all night too because she likes to sleep with me. At one time I thought she&#39;d be happier if she had some time to herself, but if she doesn&#39;t have my full attention at all times she gets super upset and really acts out. Sorry to run on, but the point is, what more can I offer or change? I&#39;m willing to do anything-- the years fly by so fast and I&#39;d like her to have a happy childhood but it feels like time is running out. Any suggestions would be considered and appreciated. Thanks!</div>

<br/>
There are kids who find childhood itself very hard and don&#39;t enjoy being children much. That&#39;s an idea that runs contrary to a common expectation that childhood &quot;should&quot; be happy and carefree. <br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t to say you should just shrug your shoulders and say &quot;oh well&quot; ;) It&#39;s good to look for what more you can do to make her life easier and more pleasant. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; if she doesn&#39;t have my full attention at all times she gets super upset and really acts out.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Giving her more attention would be a Really good idea! <br/>
<br/>
My stepson needed a Huge amount of attention when he was younger - it seemed overwhelming and excessive to pretty much everyone around him right up until I actually started giving him as much attention as he wanted. And then he only need a Lot of attention ;) But until he was getting enough on a regular basis he would soak up every tiny bit of attention and clamor for more. <br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way - if you&#39;re wet and it&#39;s uncomfortable and you can only get 3/4 of the way dry, you&#39;re still wet and uncomfortable. Similarly, if you need eight hours of sleep and get six, you&#39;ll still be tired - and if you get six on a regular basis you&#39;ll be overtired and cranky on a regular basis. That&#39;s how it feels to get not-quite-enough attention. <br/>
<br/>
Lavish her with your time and care. If she likes your company, do nearly everything with her. If she likes to talk, talk to her for hours on end. It sounds like a lot, but I can tell you from personal experience that it *isn&#39;t* more work to meet a big need proactively - its not more work than dealing with all those meltdowns and quarrels that come from the need not getting met! If anything, once you get used to it its so much less stressful to meet that big need proactively that it Feels like less work. You get some of your energy back in the reduction of strife in your family. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734687353">This is interesting and good to hear. I do give her all my attention unless I need to briefly pay bills or do an un-ignoreable chore, but she&#39;s very resentful of even those brief times. Companionship isn&#39;t enough; she wants the focus on her. And everyone in my &#39;real world&#39; who has an opinion believes that the attention is the problem: not the lack of it. But it hurts me to deny her (especially since I enjoy her and WANT to be doing what she&#39;s doing), so I don&#39;t. And it&#39;s nice to hear &quot;give her more&quot; rather than &quot;give her less,&quot; for once. :-)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is cognitive psychology to back this up, btw, which I&#39;m happy to <br/>
lavish on anyone with an outsized &quot;need&quot; for reassurance to help move <br/>
past her doubts and worries. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Maslow&#39;s Needs Hierarchy of human needs (or Ladder of Needs) is perhaps <br/>
the most famous. Picture basic physical survival needs like water,food, <br/>
sleep, breathing on the bottom rung so that you can&#39;t skip over it <br/>
easily to care about satisfying higher needs (social interaction, <br/>
curiosity, understanding the world) until you feel physically satisfied <br/>
and reasonably confident that you can turn attention upward to other <br/>
needs. This will take whatever it takes and however long it takes, <br/>
differing by person. And it&#39;s a two-way ladder, not straight up. You <br/>
have to keep stepping back down to the lowest rung where a critical need <br/>
recurs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking what the bottom rung feels like for a child with asthma, <br/>
for example. (Or the day my 13-month-old almost drowned -- nothing else <br/>
mattered that day or for a long time after that, to us, except that he <br/>
keep breathing.)<br/>
<br/>
So traditional parenting and schooling and churching manipulates how <br/>
kids climb their own needs ladder, on purpose and thinking it&#39;s for <br/>
their own good -- we set up competitions from birth (first steps <br/>
literally, potty training, bedtime s, eating vegetables) and standardize <br/>
all sorts of little tricks for them to perform on schedule and for us to <br/>
&quot;judge&quot; and score, demanding that even &quot;late climbers&quot; learn to hop <br/>
around on the rungs to impress adults, pass tests, get into presitigious <br/>
programs . . .<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s counterproductive, because in Maslow&#39;s theory, a need left <br/>
only party fulfilled creates and imprints the individual with anxiety <br/>
surrounding that need. This is Maslow&#39;s definition of &quot;neurosis&quot; -- <br/>
fixating on an unmet need -- and the the problem is that filling such a <br/>
need later will be pretty much impossible, once the ladder-climber has <br/>
learned from experience to fear rather than feel confident about <br/>
satisfying that need.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;If you have significant problems along your development -- a period of <br/>
extreme insecurity or hunger as a child, or the loss of a family member <br/>
through death or divorce, or significant neglect or abuse -- you may <br/>
“fixate” on that set of needs for the rest of your life.&quot;</div>

In fact there is anger and resentment from the 11yr old towards the 7 year old. It feels like I am in the middle at times. M y husband works long hours so  If I wanted to take the 11 year old out then the 7 yr old would be wishing to join and then it turns into a fight and she (7 yr old) feels hurt. The competition between the 11 and 7 yr old has become an issue. Any suggestions? <br/>

cause discomfort--not hives, or life-threatening.  I have a friend who says<br/>
&quot;peppers&quot; disagree with her.  It isnt an allergy-but when she eats them she<br/>
bloats up and feels an &quot;upset&quot; tummy.<br/>
Ask your daughter how she feels.  Look at what she ate, how she slept, and<br/>
even what she is wearing.  Some kids hate labels, certain textures, or the<br/>
feel of certain seams.<br/>

Meet her where she, but maybe try to avoid cheering her up.  Just offer<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003115500">Well, it seems to be just a big general discontent with life in general. And as I mentioned, it&#39;s not a new thing. (And I don&#39;t mean it to sound as if the anger is a problem for us, the parents. It&#39;s just how she expresses sadness, and that&#39;s okay.)  For example, she often turns down new things or experiences because (she says) she knows they won&#39;t measure up to her imagination. She used to believe that if she thought about things hard enough, they would manifest (we would spend hours driving around, per her directions, to find the toy store that was taller than the sky). She even had an imaginary mother who was blond and fashionable. ;-) I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining this well: I know everyone wants what they can&#39;t have and longs for ideal things, but she seems to take it so hard. And many days that seems to spill over and color every activity. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you or do you believe that if she thought hard enough about something it <br/>
would happen? Did you support her in a believing that a giant toy store, taller <br/>
than the sky (which is mighty tall) would suddenly come into being if she wished <br/>
for it? That could lead to lots of frustrations. Make believe is a cool thing to <br/>
play around with, being a cat for days, imagining what it would be like to have <br/>
different parents, picturing yourself as a baby swapped at birth, for example. <br/>
But what was your goal when you would drive around, following her directions, <br/>
looking for a toy store you couldn&#39;t believe existed? Did you believe that she <br/>
was so powerful that she could create a toy store that reached into outer space? <br/>
If so, your world view is radically different than mine. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of how I would have handled it if Simon or Linnaea had come to me <br/>
with a toy store taller than the sky in mind. I would have talked about how you <br/>
would have to use oxygen on the higher floors and giggled with them picturing <br/>
toy store shopping astronauts. Or about how big the base of it would have to be <br/>
to support such a giant structure. And talked about how much the wind can move a <br/>
building that&#39;s as tall as the twin towers were, no less above the sky. There is <br/>
a dvd I watched recently about Philippe Petit&#39;s high-wire crossing of the space <br/>
between the two towers and how in training for it his friends would swing and <br/>
hang from the wires of his much lower wire set to see if he could withstand the <br/>
wind. I would have played with the idea with them, but I wouldn&#39;t have supported <br/>
it as a possible fact. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that is really why she doesn&#39;t want to do something, and she isn&#39;t looking <br/>
for an excuse not to do stuff, can you do stuff that is not planned? Does she <br/>
like surprises? Or will they also be a let down? How does she do with her <br/>
birthday? Or holiday gifts? Maybe you can talk with her about enjoying what is, <br/>
sitting outside in the sun and just enjoying the sounds and the feel of <br/>
something. Today was so windy, so very, very windy, like riding in a convertible <br/>
with the top down windy. My hair got so fabulously tangled. I couldn&#39;t have <br/>
imagined the way it felt with the warm air being moderated by cooler undertones. <br/>
Or how exciting it was to run from cows. Details would escape me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if she doesn&#39;t want to go somewhere or do something, don&#39;t go. Find cool <br/>
things to do at home. Help her to find things to enjoy where she is. Feed her <br/>
often. 7 is beginning to have physiological changes as she gets ready for <br/>
menstruation. Changing hormones. Linnaea had a much shorter fuse when she was 7. <br/>
She got upset pretty often. The best response I had was to give her attention <br/>
and love and food and attention and love and food and cuddles and hanging out <br/>
together and holding her when she was upset and loving her and feeding her.  It <br/>
still is the best response. <br/>

If we are patient with others, they are patient with us. Or at least relieved. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Simply wishing (or UGH...&quot;manifesting&quot;)---no matter how hard---won&#39;t make us Ferrari owners.<br/>

The reality is: some things are very expensive. Some things simply AREN&#39;T---like a store taller than the sky. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how seriously you play along with her fantasies: it seems very seriously. I think that, especially if my child believed things so much more deeply than most kids, I&#39;d try to be a little more realistic than fantastic when interacting with her.

<br/>
Last night I thought about this sentence in the post I replied to: &quot;I know <br/>
everyone wants what they can&#39;t have and longs for ideal things&quot; and I thought <br/>
about how much that doesn&#39;t play out in our day to day. Simon and Linnaea and <br/>
David and I all seem fairly happy with what is. When there is something that we <br/>
want we work to make it happen. As long as it is within the realm of the <br/>
possible. When it isn&#39;t in the realm of the possible, imagining it is usually <br/>
enough, and it often turns comically dark. For example we were talking about a <br/>
toy store that reached the sky and where I had astronauts, Linnaea had <br/>
asphyxiated children, laughter ensued. And usually once begun down a path of <br/>
imagining it goes to unexpected places, little conversational meanderings. If it <br/>
is in the realm of the possible, but due to finances or time may mean a delay <br/>
between desire and action, there is a joy in anticipation, mostly. Sometimes the <br/>
waiting is harder than others, sometimes waiting makes it something that is no <br/>
longer desired. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am often overwhelmed by Simon&#39;s and/or Linnaea&#39;s lack of neediness. I can <br/>
remember being offered to buy something, anything and almost never turning the <br/>
offer down. I still feel that way, a bit, from time to time. Looking for <br/>
something more in a gift then the item itself, maybe. As a teenager I was <br/>
hopeful that the things advertised in Seventeen Magazine would make me beautful, <br/>
would make me better, would make me more than I already was. I&#39;ve never seen <br/>
Simon or Linnaea experience the world that way. Both of them wanted more when <br/>
they were younger than they do now. Although what they get now costs more per <br/>
item, typically, what they wanted then was quantity. Linnaea wanted stuffed <br/>
animals, Simon wanted pokemon figures and action figures and pokemon games and <br/>
pokemon electronics. But now, mostly, they want little and if I offer them <br/>
something they will turn it down. They have no sense, as far as I can tell, that <br/>
a purchase could improve who they are. Simon is interested in the idea of <br/>
playing an upright bass at the moment. He and his dad are almost done with <br/>
building a bottle bass guitar. My mom offered to buy him an upright bass and he <br/>
turned her down. He said he didn&#39;t know that he was interested in it enough and <br/>
that he wanted to play with the bottle bass and see if he enjoyed that. I can&#39;t <br/>
even imagine being 14 and turning down such an offer. Simon did it kindly and <br/>
easily. Mom made sure he knew that he could change his mind. It was a generous <br/>
and measured moment on both their parts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wanting something to be ideal is a different thing to wanting something you <br/>
can&#39;t have. Is your daughter becoming jaded? I think it is absolutely possible <br/>
to move from a phase of feeling that nothing can be truly as good as you hope it <br/>
will be to a phase where things are wonderous as they are. It just takes time <br/>
and support and experience. Looking for pleasure in small moments makes a big <br/>
difference to how my life is, to how each of our lives are. Yesterday Linnaea <br/>
spent some small part of her day fascinated by a spider. Simon enjoyed the <br/>
cruelty of his cat&#39;s claws. It wasn&#39;t a looking forward to or a loss through <br/>
achievement. Although that can be a part of the disappointment. Sometimes the <br/>
excitement of something is mostly in the looking forward to it, the <br/>
anticipation. And when you achieve it, when you have the thing that you were so <br/>
excited about, it is not nearly as much, not nearly as fulfilling as it might <br/>
have been. That&#39;s a hard thing to learn. Some folks don&#39;t ever figure out the <br/>
balance or that sometimes anticipation is in itself a pleasure. At 7 your <br/>
daughter probably just needs commiseration and support and things to enjoy that <br/>
don&#39;t pale. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627608528">Are there things in your home that you can set up that your 7 year old daughter <br/>
would like to do for a bit so that you can do something with your 11 year old? <br/>
Can you get someone to come over to play with your 7 year old so that you can <br/>

Take them out to places where the engagement in the activity, the environment <br/>

acknowledgement that goes some way to filling the gap. <br/>

<br/>
In our house my middle child (11 yrs today actually) is the angry child and I <br/>
understand that he need more time but it is so difficult with my other two <br/>
children 12yrs and 7 yrs. In fact there is anger and resentment from the 11yr <br/>
old towards the 7 year old. It feels like I am in the middle at times. M y <br/>
husband works long hours so  If I wanted to take the 11 year old out then the 7 <br/>
yr old would be wishing to join and then it turns into a fight and she (7 yr <br/>
old) feels hurt. The competition between the 11 and 7 yr old has become an <br/>
issue. Any suggestions? <br/>

In management studies with adults at work, the very act of trying to make things better for employees who spent all day in the office was what worked. It didn&#39;t matter if it were green plants, different lighting or paint color on the walls etc. Anything made a positive difference because showing the intent and effort was the key to improving morale.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842892452">Well, her response to fantasies turning out not to be real and to real life not living up to the childhood hype is not completely unrealistic. Take Santa Claus, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s a girl. Girls are expected to be chirpy and happy and giggly and silly. All the friggin&#39; time! <br/>
<br/>
Now, my just-5-year-old Dear Nephew has had to remind me, and especially DH (his Uncle), about reality a few times. We will be playing something -- usually involving dismantling one of his toys or an old piece of electronic something -- and using the parts to build something else. But at some point the &quot;car wash&quot; is not really a working car wash. And he has grasped that idea -- that there is pretend and there is real. (And the closer we can get to blurring that line -- like incorporating real water in a car wash -- whoopee! the better the thing is!) But he has to remind his elders that sometimes it is just pretend. He gets kind of stern with us about it. <br/>
<br/>
And the whole time he&#39;s working on a project, he may not appear to be happy. Not in the laugh-out-loud or even smiling way. He is concentrating and struggling and working hard! All very fulfilling but not, on the surface, giddy happiness.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, there my now-18-year-old, almost always unschooled DS. He has almost always been a bit of a cynic. He is extremely smart. One of our favorite conversations, at about your daughter&#39;s age, was dismantling TV commercials -- noticing how untrue they were, how the picture did not match the product once we got it home, etc. <br/>
<br/>
And he is not one to play along, unless he wants to (which usually means there&#39;s a girl somewhere in the picture), with all the social outings and family gatherings and other smile fests he might be asked to attend. So he just doesn&#39;t go if he doesn&#39;t want to. If he&#39;s in the mood, he&#39;s charming. But if an occasion leaves him cold, he doesn&#39;t go and smile through it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if he is happy sometimes -- I&#39;m his Mom, it&#39;s OK if I worry about him :) -- but then I talk to him. Have an actual conversation. And he isn&#39;t unhappy. He has just been studying something or learning something new or playing or busy. And he&#39;ll usually tell me about it and it&#39;s clear he is a happy guy! But if you just looked at him, sitting there seriously reading something online, maybe you wouldn&#39;t know that. And I don&#39;t think he really cares if you know it. That&#39;s the thing. He&#39;s not trying to perform for me or anyone else and look happy. He&#39;s just being himself and that doesn&#39;t mean being silly. (Unless he is being silly -- he and his sister get going sometimes. . . :) ) <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m saying it right. But happy doesn&#39;t look like the ads on TV showing Christmas morning with puppy dogs and rainbows. Sometimes it&#39;s OK not to be so happy. And sometimes happy just doesn&#39;t show. <br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter sounds like a very bright young lady who is figuring out that the real world isn&#39;t as sparkly as she imagined. Tough for her to realize and tough for you to see her realize. But, really, the world isn&#39;t always all that sparkly. It can be great but it doesn&#39;t have to include Santa Claus long after we stop believing, just to make the grownups comfortable. Grandparents seem to take this change hard sometimes. <br/>

&gt; Well, it seems to be just a big general discontent with life in general. And as I mentioned, it&#39;s not a new thing. (And I don&#39;t mean it to sound as if the anger is a problem for us, the parents. It&#39;s just how she expresses sadness, and that&#39;s okay.)  For example, she often turns down new things or experiences because (she says) she knows they won&#39;t measure up to her imagination. She used to believe that if she thought about things hard enough, they would manifest (we would spend hours driving around, per her directions, to find the toy store that was taller than the sky). She even had an imaginary mother who was blond and fashionable. ;-) I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining this well: I know everyone wants what they can&#39;t have and longs for ideal things, but she seems to take it so hard. And many days that seems to spill over and color every activity. <br/>
