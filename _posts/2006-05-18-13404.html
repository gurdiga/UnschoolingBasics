&gt;&gt;because she still has a need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;m trying to look at things in a more positive light, and maybe that<br/>
is true some or most of the time.  (There still seems like there are times<br/>
she&#39;s hitting just to hit, maybe to get a reaction.)  However, most of the<br/>
time she does something with me, it&#39;s because she wants my attention.  I<br/>
feel like she wants my attention 24/7 and I&#39;m getting frustrated trying to<br/>
give it to her.  Sometimes I just need a break to cook dinner or just have a<br/>
minute to myself.  Someone in an earlier response asked if dad was the<br/>
caretaker and that was he gave the baths.  I didn&#39;t respond, but dad gives<br/>
her baths to have some special time with her, and so I can have some time<br/>
alone.  But, lately I&#39;ve been giving her baths, b/c she&#39;s screaming for me<br/>
from the moment I leave.  I love my daughter very much and usually I&#39;m<br/>
pleased to spend time with her, but this mom needs a break.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You seem bent on hanging onto the idea that she is being vindictive,<br/>
&gt;&gt;rather than examining yourself and whether there is something<br/>
&gt;&gt;triggering her behavior that YOU could change. You&#39;re so focused on<br/>
&gt;&gt;getting HER to change behavior, what about you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am trying very hard to look at things from a different perspective, but am<br/>
finding a need for a word to describe her actions.  Not necessarily<br/>
something I say to her, but for now a word that can take the place of<br/>
malicious or vindictive in my mind.  For example yesterday we went to the<br/>
park and she was happily playing in the sandbox with some other, older<br/>
girls.  One of the girls had a younger sister, maybe 5 that wanted Rachel&#39;s<br/>
shovel.  The girl kept asking and even trying to take it from dd.  I asked<br/>
her if she&#39;d be willing to share her shovel with the girl, but clearly she<br/>
wasn&#39;t.  She eventually started offering the shovel to other girls there,<br/>
but not the one girl.  (This is one of those things that screams vindictive<br/>
in my mind, that I&#39;m trying to shed.)  I explained to her that if she isn&#39;t<br/>
willing to share her toy with one girl it isn&#39;t nice to offer it to someone<br/>
else.  I know I need to change my thought process, wisdom please.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now THIS is something I can totally relate to. My dd Qacei was just like this. She was bright and inquisitive and sensitive and spirited and wanted ME. I was mentally exhausted so many different times. It seemed like it would never stop, but you know what? It did. Not all at once, but over time. She grew and matured. She got more used to Dad and let him help her more and more. We were patient and understanding and things mellowed out.<br/>
<br/>
Qacei is 12 now. She&#39;s still  bright and inquisitive and sensitive and spirited. She still wants my attention a lot and I&#39;m happy to give it to her. As puberty descends I&#39;m happy we have kept that kind of close relationship. What has also developed is her sense of self. She is calm, mature, confident and independent.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to breathe and know that 99% of parenting is getting through the stages. Wait it out with patience and love and you&#39;ll see the next stage start to blossom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Makes me smile a bit, and feel sorry for my mother.  I was a needy <br/>
child (I had a lot of ear abcesses as an infant and earaches -- most <br/>
of which we now realize were probably TMJ related -- as a child), <br/>
painfully shy, and used to literally hang on my mother&#39;s leg.  She <br/>
said that she couldn&#39;t even go to the bathroom alone.  I will tell <br/>
you -- I haven&#39;t hung on to her leg in a looooong time now!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought -- does she still nap?  Can you grab a minute for <br/>
yourself when she does (if she does) or do a little prep -- and then <br/>
include her as much as you can when you prepare dinner?  She might <br/>
start to view cooking as a special Mommy and me time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for giving me a different perspective on my own mother!<br/>

  Ben used to ask (insert whining voice here!) , &quot;All he screams is <br/>
&#39;Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!&#39; When will he ever want &#39;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy???&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 *I* knew it wouldn&#39;t last! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Somewhere around 10, I lost both my boys to their dad and more <br/>
&quot;boyish&quot; stuff. I *could* be sad about that, but I also know I&#39;ll get <br/>
them back in a few more years! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cam and I spent all evening together. We went to an art opening <br/>
(Christian Thee for those of you who know/met him at the conferences in <br/>
SC), and then to Mac&#39;s on Main, a blues bar where Cameron sat in on <br/>
three songs. The band leader, &quot;Fatback&quot; asked Cameron to join the band <br/>
as his regular drummer !!! &lt;BWG&gt; He&#39;ll be the &quot;groove band&quot; part of <br/>
&quot;Fatback and the Groove Band.&quot; Then we were in Five Points for a local <br/>
rock band outdoor concert---just to watch. Then we stopped by <br/>
Hunter-Gatherer so that Cameron could play with Skipp Pearson&#39;s jazz <br/>
group for four songs. We just got in at midnight. Cameron wasn&#39;t at all <br/>
embarrassed or uncomfortable being seen with his &quot;old&quot; mom! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Everything&#39;s a phase. Nothing lasts. Enjoy each stage as much as you <br/>

What an awesome evening!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what Cameron said this morning on his way out the door to work!<br/>
<br/>
It really was fun to spend that time with him.<br/>
<br/>
He knows *everybody* *everywhere*, so he kept introducing me to....half <br/>
the city! &lt;g&gt; He&#39;d put his arm around me and say, &quot;This is my mom, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141316381">Me me me... ds wants me.  I can so relate.  :)  Despite all the cruddy<br/>
advice to the contrary, we continue to nurse.  It gets a bit much for<br/>
me at times but I know when ds finally weans I&#39;ll miss the whole thing<br/>
very much.  I&#39;m starting to miss it already and I try not to think too<br/>
much about it being done with.  I feel quite miffed and stifled and<br/>
even angrily protective whenever people take it upon themselves to<br/>
tell me &quot;what for&quot; about it.  Lately I&#39;ve gotten really good at mildly<br/>
saying, &quot;we like it and I wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d care.&quot;  We have had<br/>
such a wonderful closeness because of it.  Still I could really use a<br/>
break.  Really.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
But these are precious moments.  Sliding by at lightspeed.  While<br/>
we&#39;re anticipating that next stage and gasping for breaks, this moment<br/>
too shall pass.  And be sorely missed.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of the day your child no longer wants your help with baths.  I<br/>
like what Ren said about being peeved while doing laundry for her mom<br/>
until she realized that all too soon her mom wasn&#39;t going to be there<br/>
to do laundry for.  <br/>
<br/>
Cherish.  That word comes to mind.  Even when you&#39;re so tired and need<br/>
a moment.  Cherish the one you have.  Breathers are good.  Have a<br/>
break (even if it&#39;s just a second or two mid-scream), then go be with<br/>
and cherish.  ;)<br/>
