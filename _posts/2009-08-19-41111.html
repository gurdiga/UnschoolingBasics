<div id="ygrps-yiv-550278020">I agree with Meredith&#39;s comments here, I just wanted to add that sometimes it helps when you join them in the hitting. Not that I suggest you hit him back but if you try to match his level of emotion and hit a pillow and/or scream (if he&#39;s screaming) sometimes this really helps him feel connected and let out what&#39;s bothering him without hitting you and it could leave you both feeling more connected. Playful Parenting by Lawrence Cohen was a very fun read and had a lot of great ideas, especially when verbal responses are not enough. <br/>
