<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675543613">Don&#39;t forget to get your blog posts submmitted to the 11th edition <br/>
of Unschooling Voices, the monthly unschooling blog carnival. The <br/>
deadline is the last day of the month. Here&#39;s the main link for <br/>
details and past editions:<br/>

(If the link doesn&#39;t click, copy and paste it into your browser)<br/>
<br/>
The optional question for this month is:<br/>
Unschooling through the ages: How, if at all, does unschooling look <br/>
different as your child ages and grows. Is it different now than it <br/>
was a few years back? What role does age play in unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
Last edition there were 32 posts submitted (32!!!) from unschoolers <br/>
at different stages of their unschooling journey. Lots of visitors <br/>
found new blogs to read and were inspired to move forward and reach <br/>
out and help someone who needed some words of wisdom. <br/>
<br/>
Come join us!<br/>
