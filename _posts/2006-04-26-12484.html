<div id="ygrps-yiv-586849948">...by Alfie Kohn is being discussed over at the Always Unschooled<br/>
list.    <br/>
Since I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about punishment and how it is<br/>
detrimental to unschooling, I decided to swipe this wonderful critique<br/>
and share it with you all.<br/>
<br/>
Just as punishment is harmful, so can the wrong kind of praise/rewards<br/>
be harmful. The following was written by Cathy over at AU:<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go first...<br/>
<br/>
This is the first book that I wrote in and made little notes in the<br/>
margins since I got my masters.  I really love the way Kohn writes,<br/>
he makes this kind of confronting information so accessible, he<br/>
comforts you through the paradigm shift if you let him, kwim?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here are a few of the things that I really liked, which I<br/>
actually wrote on a peice of card stock so I could put them on my<br/>
fridge (since that, and not sharing, was the intent I didn&#39;t write<br/>
down the page numbers -- sorry!).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children are more likely to grow into caring people if they<br/>
themselves are cared about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If children feel safe, they can take risks, ask questions, make<br/>
mistakes, learnt trust, share their feelings, and grow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If they are taken seriously they can respect others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If their emotional needs are met, they have the luxury of being<br/>
able to meet other people&#39;s needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then his little list of things to think about when using praise:<br/>
<br/>
1) &quot;Don&#39;t praise people, only what people do.&quot;<br/>
2) &quot;Make praise as specific as possible.&quot;<br/>
3) &quot;Avoid phony praise.&quot;<br/>
4) &quot;Avoid praise that sets up a competition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He refers to praise at one point as something that becomes like a<br/>
nervous tick, the automatic &quot;good job&quot; (I think he talks about this<br/>
in both PBR and UC) -- this really struck home for me when I first<br/>
read UC about 9 months ago, and PBR just drove home the point even<br/>
more.  I find, for myself, that I have to be REALLY MINDFUL when I<br/>
start to praise my children, I have had to strive to break the<br/>
praise habit so to speak.  At first, I really wanted to disregard<br/>
what he was saying, because &#39;how could praise be bad&#39;?  And of<br/>
course he clarifies this point, it isn&#39;t praise in and of itselfthat<br/>
is bad, it is how praise is used -- this is where the mindfulness<br/>
comes in, I have become conscious of not only what I praise and how<br/>
I phrase it, but also of why I am praising.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I find myself backpedalling on praise, something I never<br/>
would have done before, because as the words come out of my mouth I<br/>
realize that I am not just acknowledging, for example, that<br/>
they &quot;took the laundry out the laundry machine and brought the<br/>
basket upstairs all by themselves for the first time&quot; -- there is a<br/>
hidden agenda in the praise.  So, then I go back over the words, try<br/>
to rephrase to say something else to remove the agenda.  I might<br/>
follow that other statement with something like &quot;thanks for doing<br/>
that today&quot; because I want to thank them for being helpful but I<br/>
really want to remove that hidden agenda of maybe they will do it<br/>
again, so that is why I add the today, trying to let them know that<br/>
it is perfectly okay if it never happens again.  I am sure that<br/>
there are better ways to do this, but I find that, as with all<br/>
things RU, I just have to keep working on it, being and becoming<br/>
more conscious of how my words are heard.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I really credit Kohn for generating my paradigm shift<br/>
from &quot;pop&quot; parenting as he calls it to unschooling.  Unconditional<br/>
Parenting, his latest book, brought all that I had read about<br/>
unschooling into perspective -- it gave me not just an idea that it<br/>
might be the way to go, but some good concrete evidence in the form<br/>
of studies and documentation that pushed me through that rough spot<br/>
(you know, the one where you think that maybe you can pick and<br/>
choose instead of fully embracing) and got me to really give up on<br/>
the &quot;pop&quot; parenting and take on radical unschooling.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960291504">I loved that book -- really resonated with me on a few levels.  And it <br/>
helped me understand the rapid decrease in my son&#39;s reading (not level, <br/>
but amount.)  He used to love to read -- but two things happened: <br/>
reading requirements and reading incentive programs.  Both of those <br/>
killed his love of reading, or at least made it seriously sick.  Now, I <br/>
try to help him find books he will enjoy (he has somewhat specific <br/>
reading tastes -- and how many books involving codes and such are <br/>
there?  But Digital Fortress let me know that he can still get <br/>
engrossed in a book, that his reading level hasn&#39;t suffered, and that <br/>
if we find the right book, he loves to read.)<br/>
<br/>
I have recommended this book to many people in all three states I&#39;ve <br/>
homeschooled in.<br/>
