<div id="ygrps-yiv-929312448">Hello,<br/>
Tonight my husband and I were talking, as we do whenever were pretty<br/>
much together. He was telling me about his day, and I was talking<br/>
about this book I just finished reading (which I think I should post<br/>
about it). Then he says to me &quot;I really don&#39;t get unschooling, but<br/>
it&#39;s working.&quot; I cried. (I&#39;m a big whimp) Because some days when I<br/>
make a suggestion on what would should change, to be better people and<br/>
better parents, usually are met with a HUGE NO. He goes on to tell me,<br/>
how much better our lives are, and more importantly our son is<br/>
happier. My husband may not understand, but with little bites, and<br/>
some times many different presentations, he changes, and he does get it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775609930">Hi Danie - I know how you feel.  It&#39;s taken my husband a while to get it to (and we&#39;re both still learning).  We both completely understand the notion of &quot;academic unschooling&quot;.  Now we are working on applying that to our lives - and for ourselves too!  It may take him more time, but I definitely believe he&#39;ll understand more as he sees it unfolding.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798502945">I think I need to clarify. We had no problem with<br/>
letting go of school things. Before I even found<br/>
unschooling we had an incident that cleared that up<br/>
real quick. It&#39;s the radical unschooling that we<br/>
embrace, but we do it with much difficulty. I admit<br/>
sometimes when I first hear of a different way to do<br/>
something, that has us embrace this further, I say,<br/>
THEY ARE NUTS. And then the seed that Ren, Deb, Joyce,<br/>
Sandra, etc have dropped my way finds a way to grow in<br/>
me. Then I talk to my husband who, really doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do anything more new and uncomfortable, but slowly<br/>
we find a little plantlet. I love this little garden,<br/>
it&#39;s a more peaceful place to live. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we took a holiday... Took some time to celebrate... Just one day out of life... It would be so nice...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943141605">Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is now starting to warm to the idea. It&#39;s tough for him because <br/>
he&#39;s looking for more tools for day-to-day parenting - like alternatives for <br/>
the old things he used to say (like &quot;no ____&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to have to take <br/>
that away from you if you do it again&quot;, etc., etc.). Since he&#39;s working <br/>
during most days he doesn&#39;t get to see that I also stumble many times in how <br/>
to step back and see how best to approach a situation.<br/>
<br/>
What works best for him is me reading books (I just finished Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>
book and am in the middle of Alfie Kohn&#39;s Unconditional Parenting) and <br/>
choosing really poignant statements to read to him while we&#39;re lying in bed. <br/>
I just know the ones he&#39;s going to grab onto and I make sure to point them <br/>
out. He likes what he hears so far. I chose not to read any comments from <br/>
Rue&#39;s book because every page had something on it! I just suggested he read <br/>
it himself which he is starting tonight. I love the way it&#39;s written in <br/>
short issue/answer styles. I know he&#39;ll like that, too.<br/>
<br/>
A really big thing that helped him warm to the no school or organic learning <br/>
idea was watching the trailer for that Sudbury school documentary (American <br/>
Schoolhouse? Can&#39;t remember the exact title at the moment). He was blown <br/>
away by that - plus, he makes movie trailers for a living and I knew he&#39;d <br/>
like that one :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742419747">I also feed my husband bits and pieces and he is starting to get it. Rue&#39;s <br/>
book is great to just lay it around and let them read it. My husband works <br/>
many, many hours and does not have time to read but has picked up Rue&#39;s book <br/>
and read some. I have read many bits and pieces of Jphn Holt to him and that <br/>
has really helpd also.<br/>
The other day my cousin came to visit and her 9 yo dd started to ask about <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
She asked if we had a curriculum , my husband was walking by and said. &quot; No <br/>
we just let him decided and when he is interested in something we just pick <br/>
up and run with it&quot;! ( I thought was pretty good answer ! and can you tell <br/>
he is a sports fan LOL)<br/>
I can see he is starting to get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67121924">My husband doesn&#39;t say much, but I know he&#39;s amazed at what the kids are dojng and learning and knows that we&#39;re &quot;different&quot;.....So, I was thrilled to hear him explaining unschooling to an interested friend at an July 4th party.  He looked at me for support (as in, is this right??) and I just gave him a BIG SMILE, nodded, and walked away.....he was doing great!  It&#39;s so fun to see the whole family growing!!<br/>
  Peace, <br/>
