<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162660380">Hi my name is Elaina. I&#39;m 26 and have a 7 year old DD, 5 year old DS, <br/>
and 3 year old DD. This has been our first year homeschooling. I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed over the past few months that we follow a more unschool <br/>
approach. So I&#39;m looking more into just what the unschool philosphy <br/>
is, what works for different families and just how do you get over <br/>
your own self doubts. Right now we are with a charter school but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure if I want to use a charter school again next year. Mostly <br/>
since my DS likes to do the majority of his learning through watching <br/>
and talking about what he sees and the charter school makes you tuen <br/>
in worksheets as proof of schooling. My son would rather die than sit <br/>
still and do a worksheet. But then I come full circle back to my own <br/>
self doubts and think how can he learn if he isn&#39;t sitting down doing <br/>
any actual lessons. I look forward to hearing what everyone has to say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You already answered your own question.   For your son he learns <br/>
best through watching and talking.  The first thing that I had to <br/>
get over was the idea that my kids had to be &quot;on grade level.&quot;  You <br/>
have to decide if being &quot;on grade level&quot; is an appropriate standard <br/>
to measure your children.  We pulled our children from school for <br/>
many reasons, but many of us did so because we saw the school <br/>
systems failing our children (not letter grades, but letting them <br/>
down.)  They were bored, uninterested, antsy, labelled, humiliated, <br/>
held back (either grade wise or learning wise), test-driven, etc.  <br/>
What does it really mean to read on a second grade level?  It&#39;s an <br/>
arbitrary list of words that some committee (that probably doesn&#39;t <br/>
know children well at all) came up with that they think children <br/>
should be able to read.  What if you have a child who isn&#39;t <br/>
physically and emotionally ready to read?  I think many children are <br/>
hindered when it comes to reading because they aren&#39;t ready and are <br/>
made to feel stupid.  They have to be in &quot;reading group 1&quot; which <br/>
everyone knows is where the &quot;stupid&quot; kids are.  Or they are sent <br/>
to &quot;remedial reading.&quot;  UGH!!!  Letting go of the entire &quot;my kids <br/>
need to know X by Y&quot; is a big step, but if you trust that your <br/>
children are experiencing life and thusly learning through those <br/>
experiences, then you will be on the road to learning freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
So your son learns best from watching and talking.  Sounds like a <br/>
great place to talk about what he is interested in.  <br/>
