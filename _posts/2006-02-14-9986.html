<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914462091">&quot; This is corny but I was folding laundry yesterday and <br/>
looking at all of my two year old&#39;s tiny little dresses and sweet<br/>
clothes I  was able to actually enjoy folding them and realize how<br/>
short a time they are  going to be this small. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s  not corny at all!! It&#39;s wonderful and hugely important.:)<br/>
<br/>
I had a laundry epiphany too....several years ago I was in Alaska<br/>
caring for my mother, who had cancer but was still doing fairly well.<br/>
She&#39;d broken her hip though, and I had stayed up North to help out<br/>
until the rest of the family could re-arrange their schedules to fill<br/>
in when I left.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the basement one night (forgive me if you&#39;ve already read<br/>
this 100x, as I&#39;ve shared this story a lot), feeling very tired and<br/>
overwhelmed. My kids really needed some clean clothes so I was doing<br/>
laundry.<br/>
As I sat there feeling a bit negative and grumpy about the laundry I<br/>
&quot;had to&quot; do, I started folding my Mums clothing. I sat there and<br/>
realized suddenly, how VERY blessed I was to be able to fold her<br/>
clothes and care for her, because she wasn&#39;t always going to be there. <br/>
Then I looked at my childrens clothing and thought how very grateful I<br/>
was for their health and how I would feel about doing their laundry if<br/>
one of them was in a casket.<br/>
<br/>
I folded each piece with care, holding my love for them in my mind as<br/>
I handled the clothing. I really felt such an overwhelming sense of<br/>
gratitude and to this day, I remember the color of my mothers clothes<br/>
I folded that night, because I knew I might not get another<br/>
opportunity to do that.<br/>
<br/>
She died four years ago. I&#39;m so thankful I got to fold her laundry and<br/>
feel a sense of gratitude while doing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914877198">OMG...that just put some conviction in this moms soul.<br/>
 Ren, I&#39;ve never seen this before and all I can say is<br/>
thank you for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m so sorry for the woman&#39;s whose daughter has<br/>
leukemia.  Your words as well as others here really<br/>
make me change my perspective on things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890185331">Ren, <br/>
I never heard that story about you and your Mom&#39;s laundry. I&#39;m glad you wrote <br/>
it, even if you have written it a lot before. I was a real nice story.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom died of cancer also, it was a pretty rare kind at the time. She had it <br/>
for 91/2 yrs., it returned each year, big tumors, worse than the year before <br/>
and we watched the cancer take more and more of her each time. A very long and <br/>
sad story. She was this tiny, soft spoken, petite thing, but inside, as I <br/>
learned more over time, she was a rock, the one who pretty much held our family <br/>
together the most in hard times. <br/>
<br/>
I can soooo relate to you. We used to stay with her in the hospital around <br/>
the clock taking shifts between my Dad, my sister and me. One time I had been at <br/>
my in-laws home and half of my dh&#39;s family (not my dh, he&#39;s so darn easy <br/>
going, not much gets to him) but most of the rest of the family that was there was <br/>
arguing about something stupid, don&#39;t even remember what it was. I was taking <br/>
the midnight shift at the time and not really having to leave that early, I <br/>
decided to any way. I got the heck out of there early to stay with her. When I <br/>
got there, I peeked into her room and there she was sitting there all alone <br/>
staring into space, (my sister had gone to get her something) when she looked up <br/>
and saw me, her face lit up with this huge smile. I couldn&#39;t believe how <br/>
someone so sick could be so happy and all of the people (family!) I had just left <br/>
were being so nasty to each other. I crawled beside her on the bed and we just <br/>
laid there and talked like we did every night. It was so peaceful there with <br/>
her. Even in the middle of all that pain and suffering, she still had so much <br/>
to give and did so happily and freely. There were many wonderful things that <br/>
happened like that with her that I really won&#39;t ever forget, being reminded of <br/>
those times is always such a comfort. You just reminded me of that time. All <br/>
of this mess around here, the dog hair, kids messes, laundry, dishes <br/>
etc......is really not that bad of a thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and you can share your stories any time with me,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After our little son died,when the very last of his laundry came out <br/>
of the dryer and I folded it and put it away I cried and cried.  There <br/>
really is something about doing for the ones you love that makes it a <br/>
blessing instead of just a chore.  I was thinking about this thread <br/>
this morning while I was cleaning the cats litter boxes...why do I go <br/>
and scrape up their leavings every week???  Because I love my <br/>
cats. :)  Why then, do I get after my kids when I have to pick up <br/>
after them, I love them so infinitely much more than the cats. ;)  It <br/>
all comes down to if I am feeling like I am having time for myself...I <br/>
have to make &quot;me time&quot;, but everyone benefits from it, in the long run.<br/>
