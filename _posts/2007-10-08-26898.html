<h4>Tequitia Andrews</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480911367">Wanted to say hello and introduce myself because I am sure to have <br/>
loads of questions about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
My name is Tequitia, we live in Virginia.  We have four children ages <br/>
9,7,3, and 1.  For the past four years I&#39;ve been homeschooling with a <br/>
curriculum (mostly Sonlight).  I&#39;ve read about most methods to <br/>
do &quot;school at home&quot; then I read about unschooling.  At first I was <br/>
all for it and then I worried about what would happen if they went <br/>
into public schools, college, what would relatives think, and talked <br/>
myself out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week we were on a break from &quot;school work&quot; to allow them some <br/>
down time and give me an opportunity to evaluate our progress when I <br/>
came across the subject of unschooling again.  It seemed like the <br/>
answer to our problem with homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest two give me so much resistance to doing school work and <br/>
often led to battles, arguments, and hurt feelings.  The two younger <br/>
ones would want to be involved somehow even if that meant by ripping <br/>
our workbooks and stealing pencils.  Unschooling seemed like the <br/>
perfect solution to all of the problems I was having with &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot;. So much so that I&#39;ve put aside the curriculum to see where <br/>
their interest will lead us. <br/>
<br/>
I must admit that this is scary for me,but I am excited as well.</div>
