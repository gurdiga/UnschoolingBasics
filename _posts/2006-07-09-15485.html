<div id="ygrps-yiv-545275340">I&#39;ve been disturbed at the recent number of posts that have gone <br/>
through and have caused turmoil here at U-B.<br/>
<br/>
  Although the topics are almost always good fodder for discussion, <br/>
often the original poster gets her feelings hurt because *everyone* is <br/>
attacking her and her ideas.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve chatted with Ren and our moderators, Deb L & Rue, about what <br/>
changes we can make to soften this up a bit.<br/>
<br/>
  We keep new members on moderation mostly to avoid spam. But we also <br/>
keep new members on moderation just to make sure things don&#39;t go too <br/>
haywire with their first few posts. We&#39;ve been letting posts through on <br/>
a regular basis though lately, and things have gotten out of hand <br/>
because the posters weren&#39;t prepared for the responses they would get. <br/>
Then they either decide to leave (which is uncommon)---or more often <br/>
simply quit posting. The deal IS that this is a beginners&#39; list. We <br/>
actually *want* newbie questions! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Another (maybe bigger?) problem I&#39;ve seen is that newbies give <br/>
&quot;advice&quot; that is counter to unchooling/peaceful-mindful parenting <br/>
advice. Then they get angry when we disagree with them. It IS just <br/>
their opinion, after all. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t help others get to <br/>
unschooling to hear traditional/conventional parenting advice. Well, it <br/>
sometimes *does* in a round-about way, but at the expense of the <br/>
original posters&#39; feelings.<br/>
<br/>
  Note: no one is being attacked personally: we&#39;re just responding to <br/>
your *words*---to the discussion of *ideas*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 SO, to help with all this, I&#39;m suggesting:<br/>
<br/>
  If you are a newbie on moderation, we will still be moderating your <br/>
posts. If you write something that we, as listowners/moderators, feel <br/>
will get slammed, we will write you back and suggest that maybe *we* <br/>
post your comments under one of *our* names, so that you can express <br/>
what you&#39;d like, but not have to be &quot;outed&quot; or feel blasted as an <br/>
individual. We might suggest you change some language or delete a <br/>
phrase or two to keep from getting others&#39; hackles up. We&#39;ll work <br/>
*with* you to help increase your understanding.<br/>
<br/>
  If you are no longer on moderation, but would like to participate <br/>
thusly, we&#39;d be happy to slip you back onto moderation so that you can <br/>
post this way. All you&#39;ll need to do is to *offlist* ask me or Ren or <br/>
Deb or Rue to put you back on moderation. Then, when you feel that <br/>
you&#39;re &quot;ready&quot; to tackle hot topics on your own, we&#39;ll happily take you <br/>
off moderation.<br/>
<br/>
  I personally hate moderation, but I understand the need for it. I just <br/>
never wanted this list to be heavily moderated---or moderated at *all* <br/>
except for spammers. (Oh, well...)<br/>
<br/>
  We deeply want this to be a place where you feel you *can* ask <br/>
questions openly. This will be a little more work for *us*, but maybe <br/>
it&#39;ll help the newbies to feel &quot;safe&quot; enough to post.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ll have Ren add this to the list guidelines for newbies.<br/>

I&#39;ve been disturbed at the recent number of posts that have gone <br/>
through and have caused turmoil here at U-B.<br/>
<br/>
  Although the topics are almost always good fodder for discussion, <br/>

<br/>
*** I&#39;m glad to see that you guys are concerned about this :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 SO, to help with all this, I&#39;m suggesting:<br/>

  If you are a newbie on moderation, we will still be moderating your <br/>

<br/>
*** Why not moderate those who tend to &quot;slam&quot; newbies and give suggestions<br/>
for nicing up their responses?  I&#39;m not sure who that would be (haven&#39;t been<br/>
paying that close of attention) but since this is a newbie list it seems<br/>
people should be able to ask what they want (assuming they&#39;re not a troll)<br/>
and get respectful answers.  It seems to me most answers are usually<br/>
respectful but there are usually one or two that assume the worst for the<br/>
sake of discussion without regard to the feelings of the newbie. Maybe<br/>
people could save that kind of discussion for other lists.<br/>
<br/>
It would be easier for you guys as well.<br/>

<br/>
That was not posted with the intent of beginning a discussion about<br/>
how the list is run. I&#39;m not here to tell each person how to post, the<br/>
whole point was giving new folks a chance to understand the &quot;culture&quot;<br/>
and intent of the list, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not here to change what UB IS. Everyone has a free choice to be<br/>
here or not. What a few folks are complaining about, a LOT of people<br/>
find helpful. Nobody is forcing anyone to be here or read anything. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking new folks to post differently, we&#39;re just using the<br/>
moderation as a chance to help them learn what the list IS about<br/>
before it feels like something personal. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel that advice should be offered a certain way, then offer it<br/>
that way and let other voices be what they are. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so<br/>
great to have many different posting styles. Pick and choose what<br/>
helps you the most.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t here to coach people on how to post, other than posts that<br/>
are against the list guidelines....which brings me to my next point. A<br/>
discussion about the discussions is against the guidelines and this<br/>
conversation needs to get back to unschooling now.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794884178">***Why not moderate those who tend to &quot;slam&quot; newbies*** <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re suggesting we psychically determine who is slamming newbies.  <br/>
Seldom do posters say, &quot;Ok, now, I&#39;m slamming you here.&quot;     What<br/>
generally happens is a poster will respond in a clear and honest way out<br/>
of a desire to help and a sensitive reader perceives a &quot;tone&quot;  and feels<br/>
hurt.    I&#39;m neither prepared nor qualified to read the minds of posters<br/>
to determine who typed with a &quot;tone&quot; or who meant to hurt a newbies<br/>
feelings or which newbies are so sensitive they are not able to engage in<br/>
a discussion they came to of their own free will.   <br/>
<br/>
What I can do is judge from my experience which posts coming through the<br/>
queue are likely to get responses that *other* new people expressed<br/>
surprise at receiving and send a caution or an &quot;are you sure you want to<br/>
post this?&quot; to the newbie.  <br/>
<br/>
***and give suggestions<br/>
for nicing up their responses? ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to tell writers how to write.   I&#39;m not going to assume the<br/>
worst about people who give up time with their families to try to help<br/>
new people understand unschooling.   I promise you if anyone on this list<br/>
calls a newbie a stupid bitch or a fatty booger head, one of the owners<br/>
or moderators will put that poster on moderation and probably send a side<br/>
note explaining why they feel that isn&#39;t helpful on an unschooling list.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
If list members think a post requires a certain kind of response, give<br/>
that response.   Set the tone you believe should exist.  <br/>

bit<br/>
rough to newbies at times, I am glad to see that you &quot;oldtimers&quot;;-) are<br/>
seeing that this can be a real issue. ***<br/>
<br/>
*Everyone* who&#39;s been on these kinds of lists knows new people can feel<br/>
hurt or confused when they&#39;re presented with new and startling<br/>
information.   No one wants others to feel hurt, we&#39;re all sorry to see<br/>
it happen when it does.  <br/>
<br/>
But if people have those kinds of feeling those are their *personal*<br/>
issues, not issues for this list.   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re volunteering to help people learn about unschooling.   People come<br/>
to us.  We&#39;re not going door to door, not calling on the phone during<br/>
dinner, not sending unsolicited mail to people&#39;s homes.   People come<br/>
here, presumably after deciding they want to find out more about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a counseling center.   We provide unschooling information and<br/>
ideas.  We provide support for people moving toward unschooling.  We<br/>
provide some peaceful parenting ideas.   We provide some silly chatter.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it guys.   Don&#39;t expect this list to be everything you need. <br/>
<br/>
***I had decided to not voice my opinion anymore when I<br/>
thought someone was being &quot;beaten down&quot; because people misinterpreted my<br/>
concerns and it just seemed to cause more havoc. ***<br/>
<br/>
Asking questions about learning or unschooling or parenting won&#39;t get a<br/>
person put on moderation on this list but continuing to engage in meta<br/>
discussion absolutely will.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants a different kind of list, please go make that list now.  <br/>
More lists mean more choices for new unschoolers.  That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
*** I have had SO many questions which I have been afraid to ask<br/>
but have tried to look in vain on this list and others and different<br/>
websites for the answers---sometimes successfully, sometimes not. ***<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever been put on moderation for asking questions about<br/>
unschooling or learning.   No one has been told questions about<br/>
unschooling or learning are not welcome on this list.  If you came to<br/>
that conclusion you did so in error.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the most patient moderator here.  I&#39;m the most likely to put a<br/>
member on moderation and in two years I have done so only twice after<br/>
continuous complaints about the list.   Not because those members had<br/>
questions about learning or unschooling but because they couldn&#39;t<br/>
contribute in a positive way to this list.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also the most likely to reject pending messages and the list owners<br/>
have been very patient with this conversation even though every new<br/>
member received the guideline stating meta discussion is not appropriate<br/>
for this list.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many ways there are to say it.  Don&#39;t post about this<br/>
list.   Post about unschooling or learning or parenting.<br/>
<br/>
The next post about this list will be rejected or if that member isn&#39;t on<br/>
moderation s/he will but put on moderation.  I&#39;m happy to discuss this<br/>
off list if that would help anyone.       <br/>
