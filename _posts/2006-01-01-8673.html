<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738218983">Hi,<br/>
  I have to work outside the home right now.  I feel guilty for working, but it is necessary, at least for the time being.<br/>
   <br/>
  So, time is valuable.  I&#39;m off one day during the week and Sundays.  The younger kids are who I worry about most.  Of course I get the regular comments, &quot;when do you find time to home school?&quot;  MIL is the worst. <br/>
   <br/>
  I actually work two jobs right now.  I&#39;m putting in a two week notice to one job really soon.<br/>
   <br/>
  Like I said time is very valuable for us.<br/>
   <br/>
  There have been wonderful ideas about strewing recently.  How about strewing when a mom isn&#39;t home during the day??  Do I leave lists?<br/>
   <br/>
  My New Year&#39;s resolution is to really spend quality time with my children when I&#39;m available.<br/>
   <br/>
  Be it, watching tv with them, their games, sitting with them in their rooms.  One daughter has specifically asked if I would visit her in her room.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d like to be able to buy time....<br/>
   <br/>
  It may be possible to only work three days a week soon.  I will jump on that if I can.<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085846368">&quot;How about strewing<br/>
when a mom isn&#39;t home during the day?? Do I leave lists?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about some interesting items from an import store...some fun <br/>
foods, that sort of thing? My boys don&#39;t read for pleasure much, but <br/>
they LOVE the Guiness Book of World Records, or any of the Ripley&#39;s <br/>
Believe it or Not books.  They&#39;ll positively chat my ear off about <br/>
those kind of interesting factoids.<br/>
<br/>
I like idea lists. I&#39;m a big list person...though totally <br/>
disorganized in many way, and not a very structured person, I adore <br/>
lists. Maybe it&#39;s the disorganized persons way to organize.;)<br/>
Our idea lists were started when I went back to work, it was just an <br/>
ongoing list of fun stuff to do around town, at home and <br/>
helpful &quot;hints&quot; of things that I appreciated (take out the garbage, <br/>
rinse a few dishes etc...)<br/>
I also had a whole list for the wee man. It was ideas of ways the <br/>
older kids and Markus could entertain him. I actually found it <br/>
useful too, when I was not particluarly inspired.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you could type up a list of tv shows you think they&#39;d like <br/>
too....the channels and times the shows would be on, stuff like that.<br/>
