<div id="ygrps-yiv-330687679">I&#39;ve just been reading over the past few days&#39; posts.  I&#39;m usually <br/>
just a lurker, but have to respond to the dialog that&#39;s been going <br/>
on here about this group, it&#39;s purpose and &quot;freedom of choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So my reply is this:<br/>
We had a great holiday!  I pulled my boys out of pre-school (my <br/>
oldest was in Jr Kindergarten and my youngest in a 2 yr old room) <br/>
before Christmas and we are trying to find our rhythm.  Christmas <br/>
day was lovely with lots of playing, video games and painting.  We <br/>
get to snuggle in bed again in the morning (like we only used to be <br/>
able to do on the weekends!), sometimes with the Doodlebops, but <br/>
usually just with some playful wrestling and giggling.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to the library and got library cards (yes, I had never <br/>
actually been to our local library!) and my oldest (5 yrs) was <br/>
amazed and picked up a book off the shelf and started reading it to <br/>
his little brother (just turned 3).  They both just &quot;fit&quot; so well <br/>
there.  They were very comfortable and it was a very nice time.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking we&#39;ll go there once a week (so we can return the other <br/>
books and get new ones, etc.)  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we went to the park (it was a balmy 60 - and this is why I <br/>
don&#39;t live in Maine! LOL) and tromped through the leaves and climbed <br/>
and talked about the sky.  I know I didn&#39;t actively teach anything.  <br/>
I just answered their questions.  But I&#39;m guessing what we did <br/>
achieve is learning that this is how it&#39;s going to be... time with <br/>
mom, time to ask questions and time for me to listen.<br/>
<br/>
So for those of you for whom that was too subtle, I choose not to <br/>
throw two more cents into the fray.  I have already gained a bit of <br/>
insight from this group.  I joined for that reason.  If I find that <br/>
I&#39;m not getting anything, I&#39;ll unsub.  So, dear moderators, keep up <br/>
the good work.  I appreciate your efforts and hope to be a great <br/>
unschooling mom!<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone has a prosperous New Year (by prosperous, I don&#39;t <br/>
refer to things financial, but things like time, joy and moments to <br/>
cherish that which is important to you).<br/>

        Thanks for the great post. We&#39;ve been to the park several times in <br/>
the past few days also. My older son rode his trike (that was a Christmas <br/>
present). He toppled over several times, usually when trying to turn too <br/>
sharply, then would hop up, say &quot;I&#39;m okay&quot;, and get right back on. I love <br/>
it! He even let little brother ride on the steps in the back. Little <br/>
brother figured out that he needed to hold his feet up. I have so much fun <br/>
not teaching them stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044009367">I really liked your post!  I am with you!  I think I would prefer to be part of a group that challenges me to think beyond my own limitations rather than be validated in doing something that may or may not be what is in the best interests for my family.  One thing about this group is that I am always thinking about various posts and trying to see if what those who trust the process fully is really true.  I feel that as a result of people challenging what I have posted as well as others I am a better mother and person in general.<br/>
<br/>
Pamedalah, I don&#39;t know what your experience has been with children at home but I want to say that I have at times felt at a lost, as a matter of fact still do some days, as to what we are to do.  Staying at home is the paradigm within which I was raised.  Neither is hsing and definitely not unschooling so I am just clueless some days.  But, like you have described, it feels so right and we will take it one moment at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and thanks for sharing as you have stated what I had not yet been able to articulate with respect to the recent thread that took place.<br/>
<br/>
much love to ALL<br/>
Tyra Olufemi<br/>

&quot;PS I would love to run an unschool daycare and kind of do, but there are regulations I need to follow to be licensed so running a true unschooling daycare wouldn&#39;t be possible.  If anyone wants to chat more about this off list feel free to contact me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you see in this statement where you closed off the possibility of an unschool daycare?  What regulations HAVE to be followed that will prevent you from running it unschooly?<br/>

 <br/>
Not to get into a big long tread about this, but the regs for daycare are much like regs for school.  This is an industry dictated by bureaucracy so there are lots of standards, limits and things you have to do.  Like school the more the state regulates what we are doing the easier it is to monitor and control it.  If people are interested in reading the regs just Google Early Education and Care and you&#39;ll find the link.   Unfortunately the regulations are in the process of changing and are getting stricter.  They are trying to make family daycare more like school.   In my own way I try to make it unschooly, but I doubt it could ever truly be unschooly.  I am not trying to be negative just realistic.  I was actually thinking today that the perfect unschooly daycare would be a place like a childrens museum.  Kids could be dropped off in this big cool building full of fun things and roam around all day playing.  Actually I think that<br/>
 is how school should be.  How much fun and how much do kids learn at these types of places.  <br/>
 <br/>
Got to run, I kept Anna home today and it is gorgeous out so I want to go do fun stuff with them!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
