<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200442368">It&#39;s sort of on topic because it&#39;s related to Our Unschooled Life.<br/>
 <br/>
Every year everyone in our immediate family (Beth, Julian, and I) makes a  <br/>
gift for each other, then we open them Christmas eve. It&#39;s sometimes harder as  <br/>
Julian gets older to think of something, but I was SOO happy with what I made  <br/>
for him, and he loved it, so I wanted to share.<br/>
 <br/>
Salad Fingers is a weird online video series. He&#39;s creepy and has an  <br/>
interesting little voice that Julian can copy extremely well. You can see him  here: <br/>

Anyway, I made Julian a Salad Fingers doll on the knitting looms. The  <br/>
picture is on my knitting loom lens here:  _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/_">http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/)">http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/)</a>    It&#39;s with the other pictures near the bottom.<br/>
 <br/>
Julian made me a great duct tape crochet hook holder and Beth a duct tape  <br/>
wallet. I made Beth a melted bead bowl. Beth knitted me a gorgeous bamboo yarn  <br/>
shawl, and made Julian a collage about the marriage equality fight that he  <br/>
worked so hard for.<br/>
 <br/>
It was a really nice Christmas eve.<br/>
