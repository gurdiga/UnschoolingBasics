<div id="ygrps-yiv-313958889">Some of you may have heard that the Allen family from Orlando Fl suffered a house fire this past week. (Robin is a member of RUN). They are all physically ok, but they lost their sweet, sweet dog and 3 kitties.<br/>
<br/>
Robin has told me how amazing her community support has been and she is finding many blessings in this tragedy. However, as the week has progressed they have been able to take stock of their belongings. It is pretty bleak. They are only able to salvage their clothes and 2 dressers.<br/>
<br/>
In an email this morning Robin told me the neighbors are having a hard time understanding their priorities after they threw away their flat screen tv, but spent 8 hours trying to save the polly pockets the girls have spent 6 years collecting! Unfortunately, they were unable to get rid of the odor and had to toss the collection.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Robin is holding it all together way better than I could imagine, I know she is hurting for her kids&#39; losses.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard, in the past, of unschoolers getting together to help each other out and thought that this might be an idea for the Allens. I&#39;m not exactly sure how to organize, or what exactly we can do...but would love to hear from you with ideas or insight.<br/>
<br/>
When asked, Robin told me that the things the kids will miss the most are:<br/>
Makeup and cosmetic supplies for Melissa (age 12)<br/>
Bakugan and Yugioh binders/protectors for Sam (age 10)<br/>
and Polly Pockets and accessories for Maddie (age 6)<br/>
<br/>
They already have a place to live starting next week, so that is good. Until then a hotel is generously letting them stay in a suite.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have anything to contribute to the Allens, or this conversation, let me know. I will do as much organizing and help as I possibly can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
