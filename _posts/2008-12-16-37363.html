A WISDOM STORY... THE 3 HAIRS<br/>
<br/>
There once was a woman who woke up one morning, looked in the mirror, and noticed she had only three hairs on her head. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I&#39;ll braid my hair today.&quot; So she did and she had a wonderful day. <br/>
<br/>
The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and saw that she had only two hairs on her head. &quot;H-M-M,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I&#39;ll part my hair down the middle today.&quot; So she did and she had a grand day. <br/>
<br/>
The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and noticed that she had only one hair on her head. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;Today I&#39;m going to wear my hair in a pony tail.&quot; So she did, and she had a fun, fun day. <br/>
<br/>
The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and noticed that there wasn&#39;t a single hair on her head. &quot;YAY!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t have to fix my hair today!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Attitude is everything. Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle. Live simply, Love generously, Care deeply, Speak kindly. <br/>
<br/>
Life isn&#39;t about waiting for the storm to pass... It&#39;s about learning to dance in the rain. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649119329">I love this story, thank you for sharing.  It came just in time to make me stop to appreciate all that I do have and not worry about what I don&#39;t have.  I hope you don&#39;t mind but I&#39;m going to pass it on to some others I know that need this in their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521412727">I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s from Jeff McBride. It doesn&#39;t seem like a direct?part of the story---kind of an add-on---and probably added?by Jeff.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are unfamiliar with Jeff&#39;s act, please check him out:<br/>
