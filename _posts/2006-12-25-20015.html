<div id="ygrps-yiv-185269060">Hello, I just joined your group with hopes my 11 yr old daughter and <br/>
I can feel at home. I&#39;ve been homeschoohing her for the last 2 <br/>
years, and not much has seemed to help her really get into it. I <br/>
have gone thru a cambit of feelings along with this. Feelings of <br/>
hopelesness, dispair, anger, rejection, and shame. I had to get back <br/>
online insearch of a support group that would help us. Since I&#39;ve <br/>
taking my daughter out of the public school system, she has been <br/>
tested for disabilites, and have found she has several. She is a <br/>
very smart girl, one beyond her years, but I still don&#39;t know how to <br/>
get her to focus on everyday, reading, math or anything else for <br/>
that matter. I have seen her grow into a beautiful young lady, one <br/>
that has many many talents. Also since I&quot;ve been homeschooling, I <br/>
have become disabiled. And if it wasn&#39;t for my daughters help, I <br/>
don&#39;t know what I would have done. She has taken over and helped me <br/>
when there was no one else. We really need some outside help and <br/>
support to get her going. She has no friends, because no one <br/>
understands her, and with her disabilities it makes it hard for her <br/>
to keep friends. She is a real Angel in more ways then one, and she <br/>
is my life. If there is anyone out there that can help, or has a <br/>
daughter that is in the same situation that would like to have a <br/>
online friend, we welcome it. Thanks for reading!..... <br/>

  What does you daughter like to do?  What is she good at?  What are her interests? What are her talents?<br/>
  Turn those interests into learning.......real life learning.  Read to her, bake together, take a drive together, etc.  Those are all real learning experiences.  I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will pop up with advice.<br/>
