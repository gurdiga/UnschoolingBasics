  My question is more for my 5 yo son he is a very special child (<br/>
  aren&#39;t they all though :) ) he had brain surgery last year and is<br/>
  somewhat stuck I am trying my best to get him caught up I was just<br/>
  wondering does any one have any ideas about grasping and writing as he<br/>
  is having a hard time with that plus his memory isn&#39;t that great<br/>

<br/>
  *******<br/>
<br/>
  My son does not do &quot;rote&quot; memorization at all. Neither does my husband, and <br/>
  he just works around it. Both have other strong memorization skills, but <br/>
  for my son it looks sometimes like it takes him a really, really long time to <br/>
  learn some things.<br/>
<br/>
  But no one is there telling him or quizzing him or setting him up to fail. <br/>
  He learns and remembers at his own pace (slow!) and he is a happy kid. <br/>
  Unschooling is great for &quot;different&quot; learners because there is no stress involved <br/>
  other than what they put on themselves. They aren&#39;t trying to please someone <br/>
  or get a grade or compete.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, they develop other skills to make up for areas where they aren&#39;t <br/>
  strong. Just like a bad speller can learn to use spell check, my husband has <br/>
  developed his own ways of remembering things.<br/>
<br/>
  By the way, my son went to a museum today with a great dinosaur exhibit. I <br/>
  told him it was a t-rex and he said &quot;No!! it has three toes and t-rex has <br/>
  two!&quot;. He was right, it was argentinasaurus. I am a great rote learner and I <br/>
  probably would have never picked up on that. :)<br/>
<br/>
  Have fun!<br/>

My almost 5 yo son has not had brain surgery. He did<br/>
not know any letters till a couple months ago. He has<br/>
just recently started to hold a pencil with a good<br/>
writing grip. The OT should be able to suggest<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389917817">I have several &#39;special&#39; children myself. We&#39;ve only been unschooling  <br/>
a short while(whohoo! approaching a year now!), but letting go of  <br/>
those expectations that public schools say are important was the  <br/>
biggest and best step that we have taken to help our children. He  <br/>
might be stuck because he&#39;s being pushed to a place he&#39;s not ready to  <br/>
go. He might feel that if he doesn&#39;t succeed then he&#39;s letting  <br/>
someone down who&#39;s depending on him to prove he&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Let it slip. We&#39;ve been told so often by PSA that earlier is  <br/>
better, push push push to achieve, that kids can&#39;t do it alone  <br/>
(whatever *it* is). They can do it, when they are ready, and with the  <br/>
support of people who can let them be successful where they are at,  <br/>
rather than where someone thinks they should be.<br/>
<br/>
It just breaks my heart because I see what&#39;s happened to Breanna  <br/>
after five years of us (parents, schools, therapists) pushing her to  <br/>
be &#39;where she should be&#39;. Kids may &#39;learn&#39;, but what they are  <br/>
learning is at a cost to their own selves.<br/>

<br/>
Many many 5yo have difficulty with grasping and writing and<br/>
remembering things.  My middle child at 5yo couldn&#39;t write her name<br/>
and coloring wasn&#39;t something that was fun but something that was a<br/>
chore.  She didn&#39;t learn her ABC&#39;s until she was closer to 8 (not that<br/>
I now value learning one&#39;s ABC&#39;s as a necessary thing, but at the time<br/>
she just couldn&#39;t remember something that I viewed as &quot;simple&quot; as<br/>
ABC&#39;s!)  There is no &quot;catching up&quot; in unschooling.  Let him be where<br/>
he is.  He will be where he needs to be when he gets there.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - who is so glad she didn&#39;t force her child to learn those<br/>
blasted ABC&#39;s before she was ready! </span></blockquote></div>

things, are 5 or 6 yr olds tested? What &quot;levels&quot; on standardized <br/>
tests are required? What &quot;accommodations&quot; are made in special <br/>
situations such as his? Is a 6 yr old even required to be registered <br/>
as a homeschooler? (often the compulsory attendance age isn&#39;t until <br/>
age 7 or 8, with waivers and such from 5 to 7 or 8)? And so on - <br/>
really know the laws in detail, not just &quot;they have to be tested&quot; <br/>
but how, when, where, and so on - can you use something like <br/>
the &quot;PASS&quot; test which is designed to do at home? Does it have to be <br/>
at a certain grade level (check the law!) or just &quot;show progress&quot;?<br/>

to be easier with unschooling than testing.  I know here in Florida<br/>
where one needs a yearly review from a certified teacher (if they<br/>
aren&#39;t using a cover school - which we use), networking with other<br/>
unschoolers will help you find unschooling friendly reviewers.  One of<br/>
our families uses a lady who comes over and has milk and cookies with<br/>
the kids every spring and then writes up a report about how lively and<br/>
active and how they are progressing beautifully.  Another option is to<br/>
read through your law for *all* loopholes.  If your son has had brain<br/>
surgery at a young age, when is he required to attend school?  Is it<br/>
at the ok of his doctor first?  If so get your doctor on your side.<br/>
Some states do not require children with severe disabilities to attend<br/>
school at all (hoping that isn&#39;t your case).  Some states have minimum<br/>
age of 9 yo at which time you can declare what grade the child is in<br/>
(9yo kindergardener :-)  )  Don&#39;t just look at laws related to<br/>
homeschooling.  Look at the laws that pertain to schooling in general<br/>
and all the exceptions, loopholes and diversions!<br/>
