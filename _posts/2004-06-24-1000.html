<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906542891">&quot;What can I say.  My daughter has &quot;ADHD&quot; and &quot;ODD&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Mood Disorder&quot;  <br/>
according to<br/>
the medical labels, and her needs are different.  We&#39;re arguing about a  <br/>
kid that nobody has<br/>
even met and knows nothing about. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think another great unschooling discussion, is how we can support unique challenges without the above damaging labels.<br/>
<br/>
No, we don&#39;t know your dd personally. But when a parent says a child is &quot;balking&quot;, that&#39;s a red flag and usually that gets questioned.<br/>
<br/>
Are you assuming that because we don&#39;t know your particular child, we don&#39;t understand the challenges you just listed?<br/>
I could tell you a little bit about ADD, having lived with the characteristics my brother possessed for many, many years. I myself, would probably be labeled ADD in school these days.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents here are facing those challenges and unschooling without coercion. So I think it&#39;s a great thing to discuss...if people can stick to the ideas, not feel bent out of shape over being questioned.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe asking for ideas on how to help her cue in to her own body, while dealing with her unique character traits would be more useful than getting mad at people for asking why she needs to be forced to bed at 10pm. Just an idea.<br/>

I&#39;m relatively new to this list but Ren&#39;s statement above, admittedly taken<br/>
out of context, pinpointed a nagging question I&#39;ve been thinking about since<br/>
I joined.  Is this list primarily a discussion list for *unschooling without<br/>
coercion*?  Are there people on this list who believe that the two are<br/>
inseparable?  I mean, I&#39;ve gotten the feeling that there are at least a few<br/>
vocal posters who might believe that it isn&#39;t unschooling unless there is no<br/>
coercion whatsoever.  Is this the focus of this particular list?  I&#39;m not<br/>
asking to trigger a debate, I just need to understand the premise of this<br/>
list.  Maybe I&#39;ll go back and re-read the description on the website.<br/>

<br/>
I love nagging questions - for me they are always an area of personal growth<br/>
waiting to happen.<br/>
<br/>
It is astonishing to me that anyone would want to include coercion as one of<br/>
the tools for getting children to learn specific things, or more accurately<br/>
*appear* to learn things by completing a certain amount of schoolwork. Yet<br/>
it happens all the time in schooling situations. I would consider it as the<br/>
opposite of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Or are you meaning coercion relative to other behavior/areas of life than<br/>
the &quot;educational component&quot; of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Coercion comes from an absence of trust. If a person feels like they have to<br/>
use coercion to achieve some goals about their child&#39;s behavior or activity,<br/>
and say so here, they are likely to be invited to rethink those goals, the<br/>
assumptions behind the goals, as well as offered alternative strategies that<br/>
are more in keeping with one of the most fundamental principles of<br/>
Unschooling - trusting in our children and promoting their trust in us.<br/>
<br/>
So now some musings:<br/>
<br/>
People seem to come to &quot;whole life&quot; Unschooling from two directions. Many<br/>
will say in their introductions that Unschooling seemed a natural<br/>
progression from attachment parenting and the gamut of gentle child rearing<br/>
practices. That is how we came to it. We already had complete freedom around<br/>
food (I didn&#39;t make candy available to my infant btw, but she sure liked<br/>
apple sauce), encouraged computer use, had no bedtime (she just went with<br/>
us), allowed potty learning to just happen, and had made an inviolable<br/>
commitment to not spanking or punishing - including imposed &quot;consequences&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Honesty compels me to admit that TV freedom I wondered about having read<br/>
some of those goofy studies done about brain development. It was causing me<br/>
a crisis of integrity because I love the television - not every show on it -<br/>
and wanted to be free to watch it. It is very ironic that Jayn is the one<br/>
wanting it turned off, and I get to watch way less as she gets older!<br/>
<br/>
I was very happy to find Unschooling, having already concluded that we would<br/>
be really, really, really relaxed homeschoolers. It meant that we could live<br/>
Jayn&#39;s education process in the same way as the rest of our life -<br/>
seamlessly. For me and dh the non-coercion came first, and the journey has<br/>
been about recognizing/stopping if we use manipulation, and finding better<br/>
strategies for problem solving - identifying and elucidating the Principles<br/>
instead of Rules (not that we had any - rules that is), chucking away the<br/>
baggage of our childhoods and educations instead of constantly opening the<br/>
bags and getting stuff out of them to use. Generally just trying to better<br/>
grasp what Jayn is communicating and meet those needs.<br/>
<br/>
Other people come to Unschooling from another educational system, living a<br/>
life accustomed to regular household rules, and start their journey to<br/>
freedom with trusting children to learn whatever they like. Slowly they<br/>
renounce schoolish language and thinking (which is often inherently<br/>
coercive) and start to see their children blossom again.<br/>
<br/>
Then it often spreads like osmosis to other areas of life, gradually as the<br/>
comfort level of each family is challenged. Sometimes people post the same<br/>
kind of astounded rush of relief and release of the pressure about &quot;we have<br/>
let go of XXXX restrictions and we are all so much happier&quot;, as they did<br/>
when they first pulled their kid out of public or private school - &quot;I only<br/>
wish we had done it sooner&quot; is the number one sentiment expressed on line.<br/>
<br/>
Probably no one on this kind of list wants to be thought of as using<br/>
coercion. They use other language from the parenting arsenal like &quot;sensible<br/>
limits&quot; or &quot;concern for their safety&quot; or &quot;all living together comfortably&quot;.<br/>
It is only by talking about people&#39;s actual practices, what they *do* and<br/>
say to their children in any situation that the full range of what these<br/>
phrases really mean comes out. <br/>
<br/>
One person&#39;s &quot;sensible limits&quot; means that they don&#39;t leave power tools<br/>
unattended with a 2 year old and take time to explain that these are<br/>
dangerous - perhaps they help them examine all the buttons with the plug out<br/>
and show them what the plug looks like. They get them some play tools and<br/>
safety goggles. They let them bang a mallet on some spare wood. When they<br/>
see their child heading for the workshop door, they go with them or make an<br/>
appointment to do some more banging after lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Another&#39;s means that they forbid their 2 year old to enter the workshop,<br/>
explaining seriously but kindly that it is dangerous in there, then grab the<br/>
kid and make them stand in a time out corner if they have gone into the<br/>
enticingly mysterious doorway. I have read on line mothers actually<br/>
believing that their children (of various ages) spend their time outs<br/>
carefully contemplating the crime they committed for which they are being<br/>
punished/given consequences. I&#39;m dubious (based on my recollections of my<br/>
childhood) that they are making an entirely accurate prediction of their<br/>
kids&#39; thoughts at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the phrase &quot;all living together comfortably&quot;, and its close cousin<br/>
&quot;they live here too&quot;, have the unspoken assumption that what is comfortable<br/>
for the parents is either commensurate with, or takes precedence over, what<br/>
is comfortable for the child. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No coercion whatsoever&quot; is a marvelous goal to have, a true gift to your<br/>
children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
It actually would be very helpful to me if I could find ways to <br/>
describe the clinical terms &quot;ADHD, ODD, MD&quot; without going through all <br/>
my daughter&#39;s symptomatic stuff, which feels more like I&#39;m assessing <br/>
her naked in front of a crowd.  I&#39;ve thought about this for a long <br/>
time.  I can&#39;t stand the labels either, but I want to communicate <br/>
what&#39;s going on with her without extolling a lot of verbiage.<br/>
<br/>
If I start telling you all the history, we end up off topic and <br/>
questioning how these &quot;conditions&quot; get evaluated, which in itself is a <br/>
huge enigma to many of us.   If we&#39;re talking about brain chemistry and <br/>
how it regulates our emotional responses and social interactions, how <br/>
do I simplify or demystify all that neuroscience?  Also, how do I put <br/>
the &quot;severity&quot; of something of this nature into context for you without <br/>
sounding, again, like I&#39;m assessing?<br/>
<br/>
I feel a pang of discomfort inside my own body every time I use these <br/>
an-acronyms.  I welcome an alternative way to describe what she <br/>
experiences and exhibits without all the labels.<br/>
<br/>
What do you recommend?<br/>

As Pam mentioned, I think it&#39;s more useful to discuss unschooling than<br/>
unschoolers. (Or discuss what people who call themselves unschoolers do<br/>
since what they do isn&#39;t always about applying the philosophy of unschooling<br/>

think it&#39;s for discussion of unschooling. But some people extend the<br/>
unschooling philosophy into parenting so for them they would still be<br/>
discussion unschooling when they&#39;re discussing parenting issues.<br/>
<br/>
But for those who don&#39;t extend the philosophy of unschooling into parenting,<br/>
it&#39;s not discussing unschooling to discuss parenting. If that makes sense?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Visiting the Special Needs folder on the www.unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
Indeed all the folders.<br/>
<br/>
Reading anything you can by Anne Ohman and Mary Gold, unschooling mothers.<br/>
One link is:  http://sandradodd.com/specialunschooling<br/>
<br/>
Working really hard to change your language use, so that instead of seeing<br/>
behaviors as symptomatic of something else, you describe them in simple<br/>
observational terms. An example being instead of saying &quot;having a tantrum&quot;<br/>
one might describe &quot;he is crying and stamping his feet.&quot; This is another<br/>
idea from the wonderful toolbox of Non-Violent Communication. <br/>
<br/>
Quit using clinical words like &quot;exhibits&quot;, unless you are talking about her<br/>
art work. Maybe talk about how she seems to be feeling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The danger of assessments and labeling is that they are insidious, and worm<br/>
their way into our communicating against our will sometimes. If we desire to<br/>
be free of that worm (not everyone does), it takes pro-active effort to<br/>
evict that language from our thinking, just like schoolish language. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m about to go get my kids out of bed and coerce them. I see it as <br/>
coercion and am not denying it because it is what I&#39;m going to do.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are generally cooperative and even take initiative in helping <br/>
around the house - and will wash the dishes or do laundry once in a <br/>
while just because they notice it needs doing. They&#39;re also extremely <br/>
messy - leave stuff all over - trash, dirty dishes, toys, dirty <br/>
clothes, books, etc. A LOT of clutter everywhere - a LOT LOT!!<br/>
<br/>
But today I&#39;m going to get them up and insist that we all do housework <br/>
together for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Then we&#39;re going off to the beach with lots of friends and we&#39;ll be <br/>
there for TEN hours - campfire, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t help and the house isn&#39;t straightened up and cleaned up <br/>
significantly, I really don&#39;t want to go to spend the whole day and <br/>
evening at the beach, I want to stay home and clean the house. I have <br/>
VERY low standards and we&#39;ve fallen below my low standards - dirty <br/>
smelly dishes, no clean clothes, a thick layer of dust, grubby <br/>
bathroom, and so much clutter everywhere that we can&#39;t walk safely <br/>
through the house. We have been very busy - out of the house all day <br/>
and evening for days in a row. (You&#39;d think the house would not get so <br/>
messy when we&#39;re so seldom home, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;ll just do it when I ask - so maybe I won&#39;t have to feel <br/>
like I&#39;m coercing them. They see the need and will want it done, too. <br/>
They&#39;ll comply with my request.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it isn&#39;t coercion - but, truth is, I intend for them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
So - we haven&#39;t fully come around to no coercion in the housework area.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE the stuff people post about it - and it has helped me <br/>
tremendously to get perspective.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were littler, if I was starting earlier, I&#39;d change the way <br/>
we&#39;ve dealt with housework.<br/>
<br/>
But, right now, I just want to go to the beach and have fun and then <br/>
NOT come home to a stinky, messy, gross house.<br/>

<br/>
This is real life - there is a real life fun opportunity that would be<br/>
delayed if you were left to do all this stuff by yourself. Your kids are<br/>
also reasonable people who are presumably not carrying around a bunch of<br/>
resentments from any time long in the past when chores were mandatory and<br/>
there were parent imposed consequences. This is a case where the parent<br/>
attitude - I really need your help and will be grateful - makes all the<br/>
difference, so the child attitude is not - Do I HAVE to? Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
I think when a family is in the process of moving from &quot;chores&quot; to not,<br/>
there is likely to be a period of time, not unlike deschooling, when *any*<br/>
request, no matter how reasonable, is likely to be looked at with suspicion.<br/>
Testing of the parent&#39;s real resolve might occur for a while with kids<br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; just to see if they can.<br/>
<br/>
In your household, I expect that if any of them said &quot;no&quot;, there would be a<br/>
genuine and important reason behind it, and there would be discussion and<br/>
brainstorming.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If my kids were littler, if I was starting earlier, I&#39;d change the way <br/>
we&#39;ve dealt with housework.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since my kid is little, and our home is a shambles, I&#39;m extremely interested<br/>
to know what you&#39;d do differently if you had a time machine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, are you looking in our window?? That&#39;s where we are and it&#39;s <br/>
really tough, esp. when other people are around. They see us asking <br/>
nicely and Mikey being really grumpy in return and us not &quot;making him <br/>
behave.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain it&#39;s a process. Heck, it&#39;s hard to remember it&#39;s <br/>
a process!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028848586">&quot; We had a great weekend watching tv together and it <br/>
sparked a lot of discussion and I think we both learned a lot. &quot;<br/>
<br/>

Once you start questioning and letting go of controls, it seems to be infectious.:) Now that you&#39;re aware of the subtle mind control adults tend to place over children, it will help every choice in the future.<br/>
So even if you&#39;re not all the way &quot;there&quot; (wherever there is), it&#39;s a step towards trust. Good.<br/>
