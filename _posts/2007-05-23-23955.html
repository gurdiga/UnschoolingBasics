<br/>
suggestions would be nice from people who HAVE had a raging child and how <br/>
they handle it<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Figure out the what the child&#39;s needs are and ignore the behavior.  That has <br/>
worked for my frustrated children.  Rather than focusing on the rage or <br/>
labeling your children raging kids, figure out why they&#39;re frustrated enough to <br/>
throw the crayons, hit others or whatever it is that you&#39;re calling rage.  <br/>
 <br/>
For those who send their kids to their rooms (or ask their kids who have been <br/>
trained to excuse themselves when they lose control), or put them in time out <br/>
do you follow up after they&#39;ve calmed themselves?  Do you help figure out <br/>
what their unmet needs were that sent them into the rage? If you train yourself <br/>
to look for signs and cues before the child becomes enraged you can avoid the <br/>
rages and meet the needs before things get thrown or anyone gets hit.  I&#39;m not <br/>
talking about hypoglycemia, hormones, terrible twos or other excuses people <br/>
offer up on behalf of their frustrated kids; I&#39;m talking about not being heard <br/>
by the one person who the kid expects to hear them -- their Mommy.  I&#39;m talking <br/>
about the gumball that big brother got from the neighbor but that 2 year old <br/>
Tommy missed out on and he is MAD about the unfairness of it so he&#39;s hitting <br/>
his brother, his mother and the dog.  I&#39;m talking about the teenager who really <br/>
wanted to wear the spaghetti strap shirt but the mom refused to let her <br/>
because she felt it was inappropriate and the teen has shut herself in her room and <br/>
is swearing at her mother and mad at the world over the shirt.  Mainstream <br/>
parents might address the swearing and the rage, bring Dad in to discuss <br/>
parental respect and other BS but ignore the cause.  Mindful parents find a solution <br/>
whether it be to go shopping for a shirt they both agree is perfect to wear or <br/>
discuss why the mother feels spaghetti straps make the child look cheap and <br/>
discuss the mother&#39;s feelings of insecurity about people thinking she&#39;s not <br/>
doing a good job because she allows her daughter to dress that way.  The part of <br/>
this that makes people so uncomfortable is the self exploration that goes <br/>
along with being mindful.  It&#39;s A LOT easier to blame hormones or food allergies <br/>
than it is to change ourselves, our expectations and our reactions.  My <br/>
favorite label is the *fussy* or *colicky* baby.  The baby clearly has needs that are <br/>
not being met, whether its movement or feeding or whatever the cause, people <br/>
(doctors included) label the baby as colicky and therefore give him the excuse <br/>
to be crying all the time.  People bounce, rock, feed, drive around and do <br/>
anything and everything to get the baby to stop crying.  That&#39;s what we need to <br/>
do with teenagers, too. You don&#39;t have to try everything with teens though <br/>
because they can express themselves orally and usually discuss their problems.  <br/>
Sometimes we have to help them figure it out and find solutions together and be <br/>
really creative like when they were crying babies.  The ultimate goal being <br/>
to help them stop crying/raging by meeting their needs.<br/>
 <br/>
Lastly, we&#39;re all hormonal beings throughout our lives so forget about it and <br/>
get on with it!  Its no excuse to mistreat people or to be mistreated.  <br/>
Sometimes people just need to vent, too.  Why is it okay in our society for adults <br/>
to become enraged but kids and teens earn negative labels for doing the same?  <br/>
Sometimes events (like war) and people (who do stupid stuff) enrage me, and <br/>
my husband *tries* to help me find solutions to end my rage.  Sometimes he just <br/>
reminds me to breathe.<br/>
 <br/>

Unless they&#39;ve been shut down when younger. Many teens will *not* talk <br/>
to their parents anymore because they know they won&#39;t be heard. It&#39;s <br/>
important when they are younger to take their needs and wants seriously.<br/>
