<div id="ygrps-yiv-688161169">Hi everyone! My name is Jolene. I am going to be homeschooling my 2 <br/>
children in the fall. They are 3 and 4. I am not really sure what I am <br/>
going to be doing yet although I know it wont be worksheets and books. <br/>
My 4 yr old has been to preschool this yr and I had some problems and <br/>
donot want my children attending a public school. Im not sure what I am <br/>
going to do beacuse it is illegal to unschool in my state. But I am <br/>
pretty sure that I dont have to show work until the 5th grade so I will <br/>
be letting my children learn how I want them to learn and that is <br/>
learning through fun and amazing ways and enjoying childhood as much as <br/>
they can while they are young.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jolene</div>

There are unschoolers in every single state, who are meeting the laws<br/>
of that state. If you tell us where you live, you might get some<br/>
locals there to give you advice.<br/>
<br/>
Keep living with them, keep trusting their inclinations and<br/>
fascinations....nothing need change just because you declare &quot;we&#39;re<br/>
unschooling&quot;.:)  That&#39;s the whole point with unschooling, to simply<br/>
live as though school doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059739962">I live in NY too and although my son is still too young to be considered &quot;unschooled&quot; (we <br/>
are planning on it though) just wanted to pass along that I know at least 4 other people <br/>
here in NY (we&#39;re in NYC) who are unschooling.  I believe its all how you word the letters <br/>
and such to the state.  Again, not sure of all the details since we haven&#39;t experienced it all <br/>
yet.<br/>

Just wanted to let you know that you&#39;re not alone in NY!<br/>
