So  when the boys <br/>
are able to talk it out and work a conflict out without  violence, I <br/>
should comment on it and give attention for that. However, I  <br/>
struggle with not giving any attention when in a fight, because I  <br/>
usually need to intervene to stop the violence! I also wonder if <br/>
they  would learn how to resolve conflicts if I am not guiding them <br/>
and telling  them to use their words,  etc&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I think that my boys learn how to deal with conflict by  watching <br/>
me deal with conflict and by me helping them deal with conflict.   I think <br/>
for them to have more useful tools to use when conflict arises they need  help <br/>
when conflict arises.  I don&#39;t think I can expect my boys to just  &quot;work it <br/>
out&quot; if they don&#39;t know how, have never done it.  Each time I  helped them when <br/>
they needed me they progressed to a point where they now work  most things out <br/>
on their own now.  If I had not shown them a better way  they would be hitting <br/>
each other as they did when they were much younger.   And of course they <br/>
would work it out, the more powerful person would get their  way.  <br/>
 <br/>
A think a more useful tool to guide them might be to show them how to use  <br/>
their words.  Help them put their feelings into words, and their needs into  <br/>
words.  Get in there when conflict arises and help them through the  process.  It <br/>
was so powerful for my boys to *see* it work.  And  getting in there before <br/>
it comes to violence works best.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a couple of thoughts,<br/>

My father&#39;s really LOUSY comment when my brother (15 monhs younger) <br/>
Johnny and I would fight was, &quot;Kelly, one day he&#39;s going to be bigger <br/>
than you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One day he WAS. And indeed, it was all about the bigger/more powerful <br/>
person getting his/her way.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my brother and I would both get the belt for fighting with <br/>
each other and bickering.<br/>
<br/>
That healing is a tough process.<br/>

beat my sister. She&#39;s 4 years younger, but it was obvious that I had  <br/>
gotten &quot;Chilean&quot; genes of small people and my sister had gotten the  <br/>
&quot;German&quot; genes for being tall. In Fact, she&#39;s a head bigger than I am  <br/>
(can you say that in English??).<br/>
<br/>
She never used that &quot;power&quot; when she was bigger - but I stopped back  <br/>
then hitting her, really being afraid of that ;-) I realized it was  <br/>
true.<br/>
