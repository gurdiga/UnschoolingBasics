<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352127767">Greetings!<br/>
I am actually becoming a doula in order to help with this type of<br/>
misinformation about downplaying the dangers of cesarian sections.<br/>
There is actually more damage and potential damage to any and all organs<br/>
with a c-section.  There are innumerable examples of surgeons nicking<br/>
bladder, bowel, ovaries, even baby with the scalpels.  A natural birth<br/>
may give a tear (tiny compared to one with an episiotomy), but that is<br/>
nothing to the number of incredibly dangerous and sometimes fatal<br/>
infections in a hospital setting.  I had an 8lb baby with only some skid<br/>
marks and no tearing.  My friend had a 9lb, 4oz baby with no tearing -<br/>
thank you midwives!<br/>
 <br/>
This is one of my small number of soapboxes - I&#39;ll step down with two<br/>
things: one is that obs/surgeons are great at the 1-5% of all births<br/>
which truly need a c-section, but lousy at the 95%+ of normal births.<br/>
The midwives who help ladies give birth outside of hospital settings are<br/>
usually in the 0.7-1% rate for c-sections.  In hospital sections number<br/>
in the 25-50% because surgeries are more expensive (more money for<br/>
hospitals) and much more prestigious. Nothing like waiting 12-24 hours<br/>
for a doctor to do nothing.<br/>
The second thing is that birth is the most incredible high a person can<br/>
experience.  This incredible release of a cocktail of hormones (with<br/>
oxytocin leading the list) helps to decrease pain and increase bonding<br/>
for the mom, and bring her powerfully in the biological line of going<br/>
from a singular woman to a multiple focused mother.  Animals who have<br/>
had sections do not bond with their babies, and the babies die.  <br/>
I could go on, but if you are considering a section simply to comply<br/>
with your doc or your scedule, don&#39;t listen to me, just watch &quot;the<br/>
business of being born&quot; made by Ricky Lake after her hospital birth, or<br/>
talk to a doula.  You may be surprized at how incredible this experience<br/>
is!  And yes, I have two kids birthed with midwives out of a hospital<br/>
setting, without meds.  These were the most trying and powerfully<br/>
satisfying experiences of my life.<br/>
 <br/>
We unschool or homeschool our kids to help them grow.  Take a look at<br/>
options for birthing, too!  They say in the video that people spend more<br/>
time researching what kind of car to buy than researching where to have<br/>
a baby.  Hm, infant mortality rates are higher in the USA than ANY<br/>
industrialized nation in the world.  What&#39;s up with that?<br/>
 <br/>
blessings and peace,<br/>
Quinn<br/>
