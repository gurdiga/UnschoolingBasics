<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143870745">&quot;Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a<br/>
precursor of a new entertainment wave.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I realize this was a funny, BUT, did you know that novels were<br/>
considered &#39;trash&#39; at one time? Books and novels are revered almost to<br/>
a ridiculous point in today&#39;s world.<br/>
Fear about film and television abound.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we can embrace and use any and all media without the<br/>
judgement heaped upon it.<br/>
I can&#39;t SEE what Africa looks like from a book, not the way I can see<br/>
it on a show.<br/>
