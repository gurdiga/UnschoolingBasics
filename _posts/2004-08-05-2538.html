<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715904579">I&#39;ve been wanting to relay this story for a bit and finally I have a few<br/>
minutes!  I should preface by saying that my daughter led me by the nose<br/>
into unschooling.  She has always been allergic to following anybody elses&#39;s<br/>
schedule or doing scheduled activities or being given even the mildest<br/>
suggestions about something she is trying to do unless she asks for them.<br/>
She really has shown me how important it is to her to get that joy from<br/>
figuring things out herself, no matter what form that takes, and I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
great joy from learning to respect that and watch her go.<br/>
<br/>
Given the above, it never made sense to me to even bother to suggest<br/>
swimming lessons for her.  I&#39;m not against them by any stretch, but when I<br/>
reflect on my daughter&#39;s reactions to being suggested to try something, to<br/>
doing anything like lessons on a schedule, and to being &quot;shown how to do<br/>
something&quot;...well, it didn&#39;t take too long to do the math on that one.  So<br/>
Aline&#39;s swimming history has gone like this.  When she was around the age of<br/>
4 she watched a Caillou episode on trying new things where Calliou&#39;s Daddy<br/>
&quot;teaches him how to swim&quot;.  She was in the midst of a real &quot;trying new<br/>
things phase&quot; herself, and immediately begged me to &quot;teach me how to swim,<br/>
Mom&quot; which I interpreted as wanting to do what Caillou was doing.  We headed<br/>
to the nearest pool.  She asked me to &quot;show her how&quot;.  I explained what the<br/>
swimming aids were for and she strapped one on.  I pointed out what other<br/>
people were doing.  She went in the water in my arms and we just had fun,<br/>
blowing bubbles, swirling around, dipping in.  Within two weeks, without any<br/>
real instruction on my part, she was swimming no her own with the aid on.<br/>
The following summer (this would be last summer) when she was 4 and a half<br/>
she figured out how to snorkel.  This summer at 5 and a half her big thing<br/>
has been swimming all by herself without the aid.  My sister keeps trying to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; her strokes (we are usually at their pool).  I just get in the pool<br/>
with her, ask her where she wants me to stand, and let her try her best to<br/>
swim to me without any floating aid.  If she asks questions I answer them.<br/>
Otherwise I don&#39;t say anything other than offer encouragement and smile a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
One day recently, she saw another little girl swim under water at my<br/>
sister&#39;s pool.  &quot;Mom, I want to try that!&quot; she shouted.  I got in the pool<br/>
and in minutes she was doing it.  Her body naturally became horizontal<br/>
underwater, the thing she&#39;d been struggling with in swimming too far without<br/>
the swimming vest on.  She came up and cried &quot;Mom, I LOVE being<br/>
underwater!!&quot;  She continued staying pretty close to the stairs to the pool,<br/>
figured out how to turn underwater, started to do sommersaults under there.<br/>
I said, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve noticed when you swim underwater, your body gets<br/>
flat like you&#39;ve been trying to do above water.  I bet you could swim across<br/>
the pool now (the short way).&quot;  She decided to try it with me beside her,<br/>
and by gum, she did it.  Five times in a row.  Needed no help.  But she<br/>
wasn&#39;t so interested in pursuing that further, because what was more<br/>
interesting to her was diving down.  She figured out how to turn herself<br/>
upside down and go down to the bottom (my sister has a porch pool that is<br/>
only 3 feet deep for the whole pool).  We got diving toys for her to<br/>
retrieve.  Next visit my sister said &quot;I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s a five year<br/>
old diving in my pool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Best thing was at my sister&#39;s birthday pool party for her daughter who<br/>
turned five last week.  We were there with a bunch of 4 through 6 year olds.<br/>
Mothers all talking about swimming lessons.  This lady watched my daughter<br/>
and turned to me to say &quot;Gosh, how early did you have her in lessons?&quot;<br/>
implying that from how she was doing, must have been practically prenatal.<br/>
I said &quot;She&#39;s never had any lessons.  She got interested from watching<br/>
Caillou swim and figured it all out herself.  Isn&#39;t it amazing what kids can<br/>
do?&quot;  I wish I had a polaroid of the look on her face.  I think I completely<br/>
burst her &quot;kids are empty vessels that need to be filled up with knowledge<br/>
and lessons&quot; bubble.  It was so great.  (Of course what would be greater<br/>
would be for people not to have that mentality but since she did, it sure<br/>
was fun bursting her bubble).<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else got any &quot;burst the bubble&quot; stories?<br/>
