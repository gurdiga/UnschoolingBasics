<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415232373">Simon and Linnaea get a weekly allowance of Linnaea&#39;s age in pounds. So now it is 7 pounds a week. But that doesn&#39;t mean David and I don&#39;t still buy things for them. It depends on the thing and the money and our mood. It means, though, that they have their own money to offset the days when David or I are feeling like things are too tight to buy more things. It gives them power over things to choose. Just now Simon and I were discussing a purchase he made yesterday. He got Mario Galaxy but because I wasn&#39;t sure how much money he had, when we got home I discovered that he had less money than the ticket price. I offered to cover the overspend, but he said he&#39;d rather be in the hole to me for 2 weeks. <br/>
<br/>
With candy, which seems a separate thing &#39;cause it&#39;s food, I try to buy enough candy when we go grocery shopping to cover them for a week (or more, really, candy disappears fairly slowly, depending on the candy and the season--I eat more chocolate in winter, nad the number of people sleeping over that week). If we are out and they want some I usually buy it, just as I would a sandwich or some french fries or a giant pretzel or whatever. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304199674">If it is at all in the budget, I buy it. If something<br/>
is really very expensive and I don&#39;t have it right<br/>
now, I tell them if it is important to them, then we<br/>
will try to acquire it at a later time, and if they<br/>
still want it then, I buy it. So, we have a LOT of<br/>
toys, and animals, and books and are starting to get<br/>
some video games as well - . Often times they don&#39;t<br/>
even ask, if I see something they might like ( a toy,<br/>
game book, food, whatever) I will buy it anyways. <br/>
They are truly living in abundance, and since they<br/>
know they can basically have whatever they want, they<br/>
often don&#39;t want anything, or what they desire is very<br/>
small. For example we have frequented the Lego store a<br/>
lot last summer, buying quite a good amount of sets.<br/>
Recently, my ds (6) wanted to go just to buy an<br/>
Emperor key chain. <br/>
One time at the library ds (3) liked one of the<br/>
dinosaurs so much he wanted to take it home.  That not<br/>
being an option I offered to go to a toy store to look<br/>
for one just like it. He was also hungry, so we<br/>
decided together to go home, eat something, look<br/>
through his box of dinosaurs to see if he would still<br/>
like the other one, and if he feels a strong need to<br/>
go out and buy one, we will. Once home, he decided he<br/>
liked the ones he has and did not need to go out to<br/>
buy the other one. <br/>
Both boys are very generous with their toys and<br/>
things, they have no trouble sharing most of them and<br/>
have given things to friends as gifts.<br/>
To explain our frequent visits to the lego store in<br/>
the summer, I told an employee that we are doing Lego<br/>
camp at home. Had they gone to a summer camp somewhere<br/>
it probably would have cost even more -<br/>
Often times, when something was very expensive, I was<br/>
able to find it second hand, ebay, etc. <br/>
All the best,<br/>
