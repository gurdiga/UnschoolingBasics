<div id="ygrps-yiv-85911354">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
I just read all the posts and responses about the mom (forgive me, please, I think it was Gayle?)who was feeling alone, and controlling with the stamp kit post....and IT WAS WONDERFUL!!! Thats me! Thats Me! I feel that way, she spoke for me, I&#39;m new and you answered her BUT you answered me too and I&#39;m so grateful and thankful and glad to be here!!<br/>
I posted at AlwaysLearning (i think) and it was aboput principles vs rules and how I needed more guidance and my &quot;delicate sanity&quot; but I think the &quot;control issue&quot; part of these posts was really the meat of what was going on with me and (fate/something/?/i need a better word) intervened and I&#39;m just relieved. So,gayle, by posting and really giving where you were , you gave me the words to where I was, and all the rest of you who responded to her, you helped me , too. It sounds really sappy as I re-read it, but, its what I&#39;m feeling and I&#39;m posting it.........<br/>

No, it doesn&#39;t sound sappy, at all :-)  I often find when I follow a <br/>
thread that it applies to me (in some aspect), as well as the original <br/>
poster.  It makes me think, ponder, and grow.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you here.  Happy that you were heartened by the <br/>
conversation.<br/>
