Aside from all the other points about all the issues involved in parenting and unschooling and lists and support that you bring up, some of which I have felt, some of which I don&#39;t see, this one comment stuck out for me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know it&#39;s hard. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re struggling. If I was your neighbor I&#39;d <br/>
come get your kids so you could sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have anyone you could call on for a recuperative break? It is OK to need a break. That IS one of the benefits of being in a two-parent household. <br/>
<br/>
Who can you call for a helping hand? So you can enjoy the guilty pleasure of sleep and maybe a bath in peace. . . :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi nance-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing. I moved into a community house a year ago for <br/>
this reason. Well, not JUST for this reason, I believe <br/>
philosophically in communal living too. I live in a house owned by a <br/>
land trust, and it is part of a community of 7 other houses. The <br/>
biggest problem is that we aren&#39;t a community of intention in that <br/>
since the original charter for this house was drawn up 13 years ago, <br/>
replacements room by room have meant we are currently a community of <br/>
strangers. So the support on the parenting front has been really <br/>
sporadic. Two folks moved in recently who are turning the tide, and <br/>
the support has increased exponentially. We are discussing the long <br/>
term implications of making a commitment to each other. <br/>
Right now, my kids dad is here way mre than I like, or is emotionally <br/>
healthy for me, and he offers support in certain ways and actually <br/>
taxes me in many others. But the kids are very attached to him, and <br/>
that isn&#39;t something I want to mess with in any way at all. Because <br/>
of his issues, I am still reticent to give him too much unsupervised <br/>
visitation. <br/>
So it is hard mostly because many of my friends are busy with their <br/>
own kids, and if they have no kids, hanging with mine isn&#39;t a high <br/>
priority. Having two really changes the willingness of most to do <br/>
childcare for me because it feels so overwhelming. Especially since <br/>
one is pre-verbal and wears diapers &gt;G&lt;. Still, in the last several <br/>
weeks I have felt a real lightening of the pressure and overload as <br/>
Gaelin has reached some developmental milestones that have made life <br/>
generally easier. <br/>
I look at how I have adapted my parenting to cope, and recognize that <br/>
it is often an hour to hour kind of existence. We all get in the tub <br/>
together which helps, we used to get out a lot and that helped. As <br/>
far as I can tell, the kind of survival mode I feel is just how it is <br/>
until they get older. I used to put a lot of energy into trying to <br/>
make it be different, but now I have really just accepted where it is <br/>
and moved into handling each day. <br/>
The comment I made about drinking alcoholically was in hindsight a <br/>
bad idea, because it has become such an inside joke within my <br/>
community it slipped out without a context so for that I apologize. <br/>
It comes from the summer after we moved, when my husband was <br/>
hospitalized, the baby was 5 months old and I was bewildered and <br/>
visiting friends, all of whom had two or more kids and a few recently <br/>
divorced. One friend gave me a gift, and it was these wine glass <br/>
charms that are supposed to help you identify your wine glass at a <br/>
party. So I said to her &quot;You know I never drink!&quot; and she laughed and <br/>
said &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, you will be soon.&quot; and then we all laughed and <br/>
she told me they were actually for tea cups, because the other joke <br/>
is I am always making tea. So now, the joke is of course that I can <br/>
gage the kid of day I am having by how badly I feel like I need to <br/>
drink, and for two of my friends it has presented a way for us to be <br/>
able to talk about what is a concerning habit, without defensiveness <br/>
and hiding it. <br/>
Ido notice a lot of other ways that I am apt to check out, dissociate <br/>
or otherwise use non- substances to be unpresent due to overwhelm, <br/>
stress and so forth which is why I said that I could understand. Not <br/>
that it&#39;s &quot;OK&quot;, just that it is what it is.<br/>
