<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422571069">Some of you have asked me about this and others of you have never heard of this, but if I&#39;m sending you this, it means I suspect you might be interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, I answer questions for ChaCha in my spare time and for some time now they have not been hiring new people. Well they just emailed me and said they are now hiring again and anyone that they hire that enters my email address as a referral will earn me extra money. <br/>
<br/>
So sign up to make yourself some extra money in your spare time and me also.<br/>
