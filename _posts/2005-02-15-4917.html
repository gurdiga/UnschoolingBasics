<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117955353">Good evening...<br/>
<br/>
I joined recently and wanted to quickly introduce myself before I <br/>
continue reading. <br/>
I just removed two of my three children from public school (my 9 yr. <br/>
old daughter in December & my 12 year old son last month) and have <br/>
another still in public school, my 6 yr. old daughter in the 1st <br/>
grade. We&#39;ll be removing her when this school year is finished. <br/>
We&#39;re (my husband & I) new parents to our children...we adopted them <br/>
(all three at once, they&#39;re biological siblings) 15 months ago. <br/>
Our main reason for removing them (and soon our younger one) is for <br/>
bonding reasons. Having them in school 30-35 hours a week was leaving <br/>
little time to bond as a family and to work through important issues.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s us in a nutshell. LOL I&#39;m Joanne, a New Yorker, recently moved <br/>
to Central Florida and not missing the snow. LOL</div>
