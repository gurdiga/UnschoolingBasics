complete and restful sleep.<br/>
    Ferber/Brazelton and many other &quot;experts&quot; don&#39;t  know crap!<br/>

    That&#39;s the episode.  I sometimes think that I broke my daughters heart<br/>
and she is just starting to forgive me.  We have a family bed, (I should say<br/>
mattresses lined up on the floor), now and no one is or ever will be<br/>
excluded.  She&#39;s finally, and she&#39;s 11, becoming more comfortable with sleep<br/>
issues.  I can&#39;t look back at her very young childhood and feel good about<br/>
anything I put her through, and when I ask myself why all I get for an<br/>
answer is that it was all out of my own selfishness.  My butt is black and<br/>
blue from kicking myself.<br/>

   My oldest boy was 20 months when I delivered his brother.  We had luckily<br/>
decided to Home school by then and Unschooling was fast becoming a part of<br/>
our lives.  The beauty about having them so close was that group cuddling<br/>
was still an option.  While Kayden was breastfeeding, Keegan could still be<br/>
right there with me, reading or just soaking up moms attention.  I was<br/>
adamant about allowing Keegan to still feel like the little kid he was.  No<br/>
instant potty training or sleeping through the night etc...  We decided to<br/>
try having a family bed and haven&#39;t ever looked back.  It just worked out so<br/>
good for us.  Everyone&#39;s needs seem to be met.<br/>
    Try not thinking of your childs age.  Just keep in mind that this is a<br/>
person in my life and I need to stay in tuned to what he/she needs.  No age<br/>
required.<br/>
   Sorry if this isn&#39;t much help, but if you have specific questions I can<br/>
do my best to tell you what happened in my case.<br/>
   Just the other day I was looking at our photo albums and said to my<br/>
husband: &quot;I didn&#39;t realize that Keegan was such a baby when we had Kayden&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t rush him and he doesn&#39;t seem to have any ill feelings<br/>
towards Kayden either which I think says a lot about how we handled it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433189057">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will make you feel any better or not.  My son <br/>
was 14 months old when my daughter was born.  During my pregnancy I <br/>
had some bed rest and I wasn&#39;t suppose to lift anything more than 10 <br/>
lbs.  Needless to say I did a lot of walking holding his hands and <br/>
helping him walk since I couldn&#39;t lift him.  He took his first steps <br/>
at 9 1/2 months and was really walking at 10 months.  I have always <br/>
felt that we kind of made him grow up fast in those ways you are <br/>
suppose to enjoy all the firsts especialy with your first child.  I <br/>
was also working full time.  The first two years of his life are very <br/>
blurry and I feel very guilty about not remembering a lot without <br/>
looking at pictures and rereading my sparse journal. I try not to <br/>
focus so much on that time, but to put more energy into the here and <br/>
now.  Today my children are 4 1/2 and 5 1/2.  They are very close and <br/>
miss each other when the other is not around.  I try to think that it <br/>
was the best thing that I could do for them was to give them each <br/>
other.  I have always tried not to say you&#39;re the big brother so you <br/>
have to do this or know better. Occasionally now I will ask him to <br/>
help her tie her shoe etc., because I think 1)it gives him great <br/>
pride to do it, 2)it is helpful to me, and 3) she wants to learn and <br/>
he loves to teach her things because it makes him feel bigger.  I <br/>
also give him some special time with me.  I let him stay up later <br/>
sometimes and he can attend events that she can&#39;t because of his <br/>
age.  They are so close in age that I normally don&#39;t think of them <br/>
any differently.  They both have &quot;jobs&quot; to do around the house and <br/>
before she was even old enough to understand I would give her &quot;time <br/>
outs&quot; when she  &quot;misbehaved&quot; to show him that they were both being <br/>
treated equally.  Although it was very difficult those first three <br/>
years, I can&#39;t imagine having done it any differently now.  I am now <br/>
a stay at home mom and I realize that my son is just fine.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be hurt at all by having only had me to himself for <br/>
14 months.  Your children will be just fine also.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228091089">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I might be pregnant and am absolutely freaking about how young<br/>
Caroline is (18 mo) and how she needs more time to be the baby. I<br/>
know I have 9 months, but I just remember how we pushed Mikey too<br/>
hard at 2 (when C was born) to be more grown up than he was ready<br/>
for. And family and friends will start in on how Mikey should go to<br/>
pre-school/kindergarden, etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say I have SO been there.  My daughter, now 5.8, was 18<br/>
months when I got &quot;oops&quot; pregnant with my son, now 3.5.  I freaked out a lot<br/>
about what this was going to do to our relationship.  My observation of my<br/>
own and others experiences is that how difficult this will feel to Caroline<br/>
will likely have a lot to do with both her temperment (easy going / medium /<br/>
spirited?) and the temperment of your new baby.  If your baby is easy going,<br/>
the baby might not have too much of an impact on Caroline until s/he starts<br/>
crawling over and grabbing her toys, by which time she&#39;ll be 3.  Even if you<br/>
are extremely unlucky, like me, and you have a spirited toddler and you get<br/>
a high need baby I have some good news for you - even though the first year<br/>
will be rough (I hope you have a support system closeby in this event), the<br/>
closeness of age will pay off hugely.  My daughter had a really difficult<br/>
time with her brother and it took us 8 months to get to the point where I<br/>
felt she had accepted his existence in our lives.  Now they are best of<br/>
friends, play so well together and share interests, calls him her &quot;bestest<br/>
brother&quot;, protects him fiercely and she cannot possibly imagine life without<br/>
him.  There is so much love there it is just an awesome sight.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I never told my daughter that she should act or be any<br/>
differently now that she had a brother.  I accepted where she was at and<br/>
tried to give her as much as I could while giving the baby what he needed.<br/>
Her needs didn&#39;t always get met when she wanted them to be, but I never gave<br/>
her the message she was too big to have them and I think that was a good<br/>
thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992707185"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;No, it&#39;s all about convenience for the parents actually...it has<br/>
&gt;absolutely nothing to do with meeting the child&#39;s needs.<br/>
&gt;Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting, because this is so far from what I got from reading his<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, the idea of &quot;crying it out&quot; is against unschooling ideas, yes, but<br/>
the book is about so much more than that.  Crying it out isn&#39;t even a good<br/>
description of what the method talks about.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the best thing I got from the book was how it talked about the<br/>
process of falling asleep and how it works for ALL of us, young and old.<br/>
And about learning your own bodies process.  And that the job of the parent<br/>
was to help the child recognize the signs of that process.<br/>
<br/>
ANd that can be done without the crying.  We probably all do it.  &quot;Hey, you<br/>
are getting kind of cranky and having trouble remembering ways to play<br/>
nicely.  Would you like to sit quietly with me and listen to music for a<br/>
while?  Yes, that&#39;s great.  Hey you are closing your eyes a lot, how about<br/>
we lay down in bed.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, how the &quot;method&#39; gets applied........-sigh-<br/>
