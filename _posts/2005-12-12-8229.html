<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847112362">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it lead to think of your parents as your personal<br/>
servants and to treat them with a sort of &quot;I snap my fingers and you<br/>
jump&quot; kind of attitude?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only if YOU act that way.:)<br/>
I don&#39;t jump when someone snaps their fingers at me...but I respond <br/>
very quickly when a child makes a request. There&#39;s a difference. I <br/>
expect to be treated decently, from adults and children. <br/>
Children don&#39;t have the same skill level, but if Jalen is screeching <br/>
at me and being generally loud and demanding, I might say &quot;hey, if <br/>
you just ask me in a soft voice, I can help you better&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gentle nudges, gentle nudges.<br/>
<br/>
When I clean Sierra&#39;s room, I DO ask her to help...if she&#39;s busy <br/>
that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m not just running around all day cleaning up and <br/>
never asking for assistance.  I also let them know when I&#39;m <br/>
exhausted and what will help me have a better day or night.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different when they&#39;re little, they love to help but most of <br/>
their help only makes tasks take longer for you....that&#39;s part of <br/>
setting up a partnership between you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
Have you noticed your 4y.o. loving to be in the middle of household <br/>
tasks, wanting to try everything and &quot;help&quot;?<br/>
That&#39;s the sweet involvement we&#39;re perpetuating. Each child, that is <br/>
being honored for the different ways they help, continue to see <br/>
themselves as a valuable part of a family unit.<br/>
<br/>
The families where the mother plays martyr, usually have control <br/>
issues too. The ones I&#39;ve known, the mother doesn&#39;t WANT outside <br/>
help, she&#39;ll stop them from doing it because she wants it done a <br/>
certain way, but she&#39;ll moan about all the hard work she does. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
If you appreciate whatever form of help they give, show them new <br/>
skills as they get older and make a partnership of these tasks, <br/>
you&#39;ll get a whole different result. It takes a lot of letting go to <br/>
get there....<br/>
