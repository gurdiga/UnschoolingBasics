<div id="ygrps-yiv-685902894">Hi I just wanted to jump in here on this topic ­ hope no one minds. My mom<br/>
always loves to tell me how she took the day off work (as a teacher) to take<br/>
me to see Bambi when it came out when I was little (1974/75) not sure if we<br/>
were in Mexico or the US then. My father was in Med School in Mexico when I<br/>
was born. Anyway we didn¹t last past Bambi¹s Mother being Shot ­ I didn¹t<br/>
like it at all. When I was in HS our Church Youth Group had that movie one<br/>
night and I still wouldn¹t watch the beginning (I came in When Bambi &<br/>
Thumper Meet). It wasn¹t until my DD got the DVD that I actually watched the<br/>
beginning and I still don¹t like too, but my girls put it to me this way ­<br/>
Bambi¹s Mommy went to heaven so she can now watch him ALL the time and now<br/>
he can&#39;t get away with NOTHIN¹. LOL Now my girls also have watched the Mummy<br/>
& Mummy Returns along with other classic (1940¹s and on) movies and the 3 yo<br/>
LOVES them ­ the 9yo likes to watch the How Did They Do That parts of DVDs<br/>
or look it up on the net. The 2 yo I am trying to keep her away from her<br/>
sisters choices of movies even though she LOVES Zathura and the Thing From<br/>
Outer Space  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337819380">HI ,<br/>
   <br/>
  Really needing some answers on this question. My youngest daughter is at the Waldorf school in kindergarten and is finishing the year off there, and then unschooling all 4 children.<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyways ran into a person I knew and told her what I was planning, and she shared with me that she almost went  the unschooloing path but decided against it , and thought Waldorf was a abettor choice.<br/>
   <br/>
  She then went onto tell me that she met one of the pioneer adult children of ((greenburg?)unschooling and that made her know and realize the area that can create real problems .<br/>
   <br/>
   I asked what was that,  she said when talking to him it was constantly  I, <br/>
  I, I ,me me and was not particularly interested  in being of service to anyone else because his whole life was based on his needs.<br/>
   <br/>
  She then went on to tell me of the antrposophical theorys through Waldorf that a child&#39;s ego doesn&#39;t develop till later and that all this self lead can create real narcissistic people.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have to admit I started  to deflate a little, and yet I though o.k. this is good shes only mirroring your own fear. <br/>
   <br/>
  She went on to say that she new her son well enough to know that all he ever would have done was spent his time on a computer and would have never had the opportunity o move his body and experience art the way Waldorf had taught him.<br/>
   <br/>
  I need some feedback my own doubts starting coming in, and I feel a little lost???<br/>
   <br/>
  She said meeting this man that could not think much beyond himself and very self absorbed, it actually turnded her off completly from Unschooling. Until then she thought it was great. <br/>
  Shes works with children as a Art therapist and has been in many differnt learning enviorements and communties of schooling<br/>
  She could biase as well and I wasnt about to defend my point, but I doint think I had one since Im new to all this, other than my intuition and heart which has always lead , but I have tended to leave out discerment??<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks ...................Sandy<br/>

<br/>
Hi Sandy, I&#39;m Sandy :-)  The first thing that I noticed here is the<br/>
word &quot;one&quot;.  She met &quot;one&quot; person.  Now say it was two or three or<br/>
four, five 10, heck even 1000!  Isn&#39;t it probably safe to say that<br/>
there are &#39;me, me, me&#39; types in every part of society...including<br/>
Waldorf kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;   She said meeting this man that could not think much beyond<br/>
 </span></blockquote>himself and very self absorbed, it actually turnded her off completly<br/>
from Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I *know* what she means, however, who is she to say that being<br/>
self-absorbed is wrong?  As long as someone isn&#39;t violating me or my<br/>
family and they aren&#39;t harming me, who am I to look down on others for<br/>
not meeting my standards?  Who am I to say that it&#39;s wrong to be<br/>
self-absorbed?  Same question for your friend, who is she to say that<br/>
being self-absorbed is wrong?  It&#39;s her personal opinion, there is no<br/>
law anywhere saying that it&#39;s wrong to be self-absorbed.<br/>
<br/>
Again, there are &#39;self-absorbed&#39; people in all walks of life...so<br/>
what? &lt;shrug&gt;  If she met an unschooler who worked 20 charities a week<br/>
and made a positive opinion on unschoolers based on that unschooler,<br/>
she still wouldn&#39;t have made a fair and balanced judgement.  KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would wonder if she knows her son as well as she things she does :)  My<br/>
narcissistic children are outside picking dewberries because they know that<br/>
I like dewberries and want to pick enough for me to make a small cobbler.<br/>
Here&#39;s the part where you know they are truly narcissistic.  None of them<br/>
likes dewberries!  They are picking them for ME because they want ME to be<br/>
happy.  Not because it will get them anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
My son is growing brussel sprouts in his garden because his daddy likes<br/>
brussel sprouts.  One of my daughters wants her friend to come live with us<br/>
because she knows how unhappy her friend is in her current family<br/>
situation.  My other daughter has been helping me the past few weeks in<br/>
coordinating and cooking meals for a family in our unschool group who has<br/>
had several members in a horrible accident.  Narcissists everyone of them :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, I have not found children who are unschooled to be<br/>
narcissistic.  It may be that this person your friend ran into would be<br/>
narcissists in any environment he was raised.  Or he may have had something<br/>
in his earliest childhood (or in his adult life) that caused him to be<br/>
narcissistic.  More and more often as I start looking at teens who are<br/>
unschooled I&#39;m seeing them involved in all kinds of unusual service related<br/>
activities.  I say unusual because they are things that you wouldn&#39;t see a<br/>
&quot;regular&quot; kid involved in.  Volunteering at hospice centers, organizing pet<br/>
adoptions, volunteering with literacy programs and going on religious<br/>
missions to build houses or dig water wells in third world countries.  All<br/>
very giving and compassionate activities.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to dismiss the unschooling lifestyle <br/>
because of meeting one person that didn&#39;t impress you.  I&#39;ve met <br/>
people just like that boy your friend mentioned, but they went to <br/>
public school.  So, who or what do we blame then?  I guess if you see <br/>
her again and she finds out you still plan to unschool and tries to <br/>
persuade you not to, just be honest.  Tell her you gave it some <br/>
thought but didn&#39;t feel that knowing one bad apple should spoil the <br/>
whole bunch.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t see unschooling as a Me, Me kind of thing at all.  <br/>
It&#39;s more of an Us, Us thing.  We&#39;re a family and our very lifestyle <br/>
encompasses all of us, not catering to just one person at a time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of service to others was this woman expecting to see in this one meeting?<br/>
<br/>
I can only give you my experience. I don&#39;t know any adult unschoolers but the numerous teen unschoolers I have met are delightful to be around. They are compassionate, caring, helpful to each other and friendly to adults and smaller kids. They are passionate about their interests in a way I wish I could have been at their age.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are many different reasons to help others. For some it is innate. (I&#39;m thinking Howard Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences.) My daughter Qacei has been raising money for charity since she was 8.  My son Conor will often buy treats for his buddies or offer to pay a friend&#39;s way somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
For others it&#39;s having a giving nature modeled for them. They&#39;ve both helped me gather food for foodbanks, items for the homeless shelter or toys for a Christmas Toys for Tots program.  <br/>
None of this makes them better than people who may not immediately do this, it&#39;s just part of who they are and how they&#39;ve lived. And in fact, it&#39;s a part that can sometimes hurt them as they feel things so deeply and care almost too much. <br/>
<br/>
Another reason to help comes from a sense of guilt, I think. Being told you&#39;re supposed to feel a certain way or &quot;give back&quot; a certain amount. I suppose that has its place. But I don&#39;t think any one philosophy or teaching method is going to instill a natural inclination to reach out to others though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah Waldorf claims a lot of things about Anthroposophy. Do you know much about it? If not, I&#39;d suggest you do some reasearch. I&#39;m not a fan.<br/>

You mean her son has *acces* to a computer through Waldorf???<br/>
<br/>
Is this a New Order Waldorf? A progressive one???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad she thinks that she couldn&#39;t offer her child anything <br/>

enroll him in a school---that doesn&#39;t even allow the kids on computers. <br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s assuming we have not, right?<br/>
<br/>
Control freak. You almost have to be to adhere to the Waldorf plan. <br/>
Unless the child is naturally drawn to Waldorf, it&#39;ll be a horrible <br/>
fit. A computer geek would have to wait until he&#39;s in high school to <br/>
work with a computer. It&#39;s a shame she did that to her child.<br/>

<br/>
So---what&#39;s your problem with unschooling? Just defending it?<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s basing her opinion on a meeting with one grown teen (whom <br/>
none of us have heard of), I wouldn&#39;t be running away from unschooling <br/>
too fast. Seriously: if you&#39;re looking for unschoolers---teens, in <br/>
particular---we can find someone within a short drive. But the <br/>
conference will have hundreds of children of all ages to gawk at and <br/>
interrogate.<br/>

Odd. I have an always-schooled doctor brother-in-law who is *just* like <br/>
this!<br/>

a child&#39;s ego doesn&#39;t develop till later and that all this self lead <br/>
can create<br/>
real narcissistic people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think all that&#39;s crap---no basis for reality. But, different strokes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She went on to say that she new her son well enough to know that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>all he ever<br/>
would have done was spent his time on a computer and would have never <br/>
had the<br/>
opportunity o move his body and experience art the way Waldorf had <br/>
taught him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
You mean her son has *acces* to a computer through Waldorf???<br/>
<br/>
Is this a New Order Waldorf? A progressive one???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad she thinks that she couldn&#39;t offer her child anything <br/>
interesting enough to pull him away from the computer. She had to <br/>
enroll him in a school---that doesn&#39;t even allow the kids on computers. <br/>
BumMER!.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She said meeting this man that could not think much beyond himself <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and very<br/>
self absorbed, it actually turnded her off completly from Unschooling. <br/>
Until<br/>
then she thought it was great.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again---my brother-in-law...<br/>
<br/>
She must not have researched very hard then. ANd she must have been <br/>
looking for a way OUT of unschooling. Easy out!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shes works with children as a Art therapist and has been in many <br/>
 </span></blockquote>differnt<br/>
learning enviorements and communties of schooling<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s assuming we have not, right?<br/>
<br/>
Control freak. You almost have to be to adhere to the Waldorf plan. <br/>
Unless the child is naturally drawn to Waldorf, it&#39;ll be a horrible <br/>
fit. A computer geek would have to wait until he&#39;s in high school to <br/>
work with a computer. It&#39;s a shame she did that to her child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She could biase as well and I wasnt about to defend my point, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I doint<br/>
think I had one since Im new to all this, other than my intuition and <br/>
heart<br/>
which has always lead , but I have tended to leave out discerment??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So---what&#39;s your problem with unschooling? Just defending it?<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s basing her opinion on a meeting with one grown teen (whom <br/>
none of us have heard of), I wouldn&#39;t be running away from unschooling <br/>
too fast. Seriously: if you&#39;re looking for unschoolers---teens, in <br/>
particular---we can find someone within a short drive. But the <br/>
conference will have hundreds of children of all ages to gawk at and <br/>
interrogate.<br/>

***** I have a sil that sent her kids to Waldorf until middle school yrs and <br/>
SHE is exactly like this!!!!!! It&#39;s ALWAYS all about HER, HER, HER and her <br/>
kids are becoming the same way.  Poor hubby, he&#39;s a gem.<br/>
<br/>
They live out of state and whenever we talk to her *we* have to ask about the <br/>
kids and dh or the whole conversation ends up all about her, what SHE&#39;S up <br/>
to, her whining, her politics, her job, her views, her her her. (It makes ya <br/>
ready for the snore shelf &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
She went to India for 3 weeks by herself  last summer (again, it was all just <br/>
about her) the dh stayed home and worked and her kids stayed with us for a <br/>
week and then other relatives the rest of the time. (it was the week from hell I <br/>
might add) We never even got a phone call saying &quot;Hi I had a great time in <br/>
India, *thanks* for keeping the kids for so long. How did it go?&quot; Nothing. When <br/>
*we* did finally call her, she never even mentioned the kids or our visit or <br/>
anything, it was again, all about her. How boring. This is my dh sister, I <br/>
cannot believe they come from the same family, my dh is completely opposite of her <br/>
and LOVES unschooling. They both went to ps and she is a firm believer in the <br/>
Waldorf beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, I LOVED your responses about this &quot;waldorf friend&#39;s opinion&quot; on <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s easy to see that you are very knowledgeable about Waldorf in your <br/>
response, too bad the Waldorf friend didn&#39;t do her homework about unschoolers <br/>
before she shot her mouth off about us. I&#39;d say she needs to do more research <br/>
than just talking to one guy!****<br/>
