 </span></blockquote>Sandy, I&#39;ve been heavily involved in the SCA, including the one here in<br/>
Pensacola.  What I can say is that our experience here in Pensacola was not<br/>
the best.  The attitude here in this area of the country is &quot;stick jocks<br/>
rule&quot; or &quot;if there is no fighting what good is it?&quot;  The SCA group here<br/>
revolves around fighting.  The arts and science are what are done to get to<br/>
do the fighting.  Young kids (especially boys) are pushed into fighting at<br/>
an early age and if they express an interest in other activites (such as<br/>
archery or (gasp) costuming) they are made to feel less manly or that those<br/>
interests are less worthy!  That is NOT the message I want my children to<br/>
hear!   And this group does not provide things for the children to do and<br/>
most of the time would prefer if the children were not involved.<br/>
<br/>
We moved from Oregon where we were very involved.  We hold some titles that<br/>
we worked hard for.  Oregon has a totally different SCA.  There is heavy<br/>
emphasis on the arts and science.  Because of the weather there are two<br/>
seasons.  The late spring, summer and early fall is considered &quot;tourney<br/>
season&quot; and there are lots of battles, wars, tournaments and other &quot;manly<br/>
sports&quot; played.  The rest of the year is &quot;feast season&quot; when there are arts<br/>
and science competitions and classes, feasts, masqued balls, dance and<br/>
heraldry symposiums, etc.  Even during the summer when it is &quot;tourney<br/>
season&quot; there will be arts and science related activities and activities for<br/>
children.  And there are tournaments during feast season, but smaller and<br/>
with less emphasis.  (I mean who really wants to go out and fight when it is<br/>
sleeting? Although I could ask the opposite of the fighters down here - who<br/>
really wants to go out and fight when it is 100° with 100% humidity?)<br/>
<br/>
When we moved back down here we were greatly shocked at the difference.  The<br/>
costuming was mostly sloppy (do the least that you need to get by), little<br/>
attention was paid to detail, tournaments were the thing to do and don&#39;t<br/>
expect any arts.  Feasts have been greatly lacking as they try to disguise<br/>
modern food to appear (or be named like) something that could be medieval<br/>
(Hello, Rice a Roni is NOT period!)  We tried to implement some changes, but<br/>
it just didn&#39;t take.  I ended up being the only one who was seriously doing<br/>
cooking, sewing, weaving, music, dance, and heraldry.  Also with little ones<br/>
running around with nothing to do we found ourselves not doing SCA but doing<br/>
camping in funny clothes chasing after kids.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve thought recently about getting back involved.  Everytime we do we see<br/>
this group of SCAers at outdoor gatherings (like Festival on the Green or<br/>
the Ren Faire) and &quot;back away slowly.&quot;  We miss being involved *a lot* and<br/>
have thought maybe doing one of two things.  1.  Go to events that are not<br/>
in our area and not get involved at all locally or 2.  get involved but do<br/>
our own thing and pffft on anyone who poo-poos us.  The problem with 1 is<br/>
that we enjoyed our local group in Oregon and had a lot of fun doing the<br/>
things that we did.  The problem with 2 is sort of complicated since I was<br/>
one of the forcing factors that caused this group to go from being a Barony<br/>
back to a Shire (big group with status and titles to a small group with no<br/>
titles) so my presence with some of the people who still have a lot of pull<br/>
(namely the former Baron and Baroness) is not very well appreciated.  It&#39;s<br/>
complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Call me if you want to talk about it.  I have lots of pictures from my time<br/>
in the SCA as well as tons of books on costuming and heraldry and cooking.<br/>
I also play recorder and have done a lot of medieval singing.  Although, if<br/>
we got enough of us whacky unschoolers together and made ourselves look<br/>
really spiffy and went and started doing our own thing (with or<br/>
independently from the local group) that could be fun and we would know that<br/>
the kids had something to do!  :)<br/>

didn&#39;t mean to say that the only thing being done in this part of the<br/>
country was fighting.  It is mostly this one group that is so stick jock<br/>
oriented.  It&#39;s really sad because when I lived here in the 80&#39;s there were<br/>
nights for dancing, costuming, armoring, music, and heraldry.  There was<br/>
something going on several nights a month.  So when we moved and found out<br/>
that they had become a barony it didn&#39;t surprise us as they had been moving<br/>
positively in that area.  When we moved back and saw that the barony was<br/>
doing none of those things anymore, had no guilds or interest nights, was<br/>
only doing fighting, did not give a good representation of the SCA when in<br/>
public and were not filing reports (much less on time) we were shocked!  I<br/>
knew the crown princess at the time and had a long talk with her about what<br/>
was (not) happening in the group.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there are no other medieval recreation groups in our area.<br/>
The Adrian Empire has several groups in mid and south Florida but nothing<br/>
close at all to us.  There is a Confederate War group as well as a<br/>
Revolutionary War group here.  Their gowns are SO pretty but SO expensive to<br/>
do correctly.  There used to be a Sherlock gathering here but that was<br/>
20-odd years ago and I haven&#39;t seen the guy who used to do that in probably<br/>
10.  That was fun (but also SO expensive to costume for!)<br/>
<br/>
Sandy, call me if you want to talk more about the SCA or come over sometime<br/>
and look at my books.  All my costumes are in storage, but I do have photos<br/>
and miscellaneous jewelry and regalia from when we were involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686263956">On the topic of the SCA, I could write for days! But...I&#39;d really hate <br/>
to have this one person&#39;s negative experience influence your decision.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in and out of the SCA for about 13 years, and the last 5 my <br/>
husband and I have put most of our time into creating a group from <br/>
scratch in our area. We&#39;ve been through soooooooooo many different <br/>
situations and people in that time, and we&#39;ve had people complain that <br/>
there&#39;s not enough of this or that. Actually, non-fighters sometimes <br/>
complain about the whole structure of the SCA in general, because it&#39;s <br/>
combat oriented. They seem to forget what age we&#39;re recreating- combat <br/>
was a large part of life at that time. I myself am not a fighter, so I&#39;m <br/>
not speaking from a stick-jock point of view at all, at all. BUT... the <br/>
one thing I can say is that the SCA is what you make of it. The people <br/>
who are doing the fighting, decided they wanted to fight, and they <br/>
pursued their interest. Anything A&S oriented (or whatever your <br/>
interests are) has to be started by someone. If it&#39;s your interest, and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t seem to exist, then there&#39;s your niche! Just go for it. I get <br/>
irked when people seem to think that all activities/ interests/ pursuits <br/>
need to be provided for them. If I&#39;m not interested in something, I&#39;m <br/>
not likely to get behind making sure it happens- there is, particularly <br/>
in a small group, plenty of work that already has to be done just to <br/>
keep it running, and that takes most of my time already. I have enough <br/>
of a hard time finding a chance to pursue my own interests in any depth, <br/>
let alone try to surmise what others might want out of the SCA and try <br/>
to provide it for them. The SCA is volunteer based, so any activities <br/>
that happen have been planned and organized by some other member. If you <br/>
want to see something happen, then make it happen-otherwise you have no <br/>
one to blame but yourself. Talking with the royalty is a good start, but <br/>
not by any means the only or even necessarily the best way to get things <br/>
done. Forgive me if I sound harsh, but this sounds uncannily similar to <br/>
so many other complaints I&#39;ve heard over the years, from people who want <br/>
certain things to happen, but don&#39;t want to expend any effort to make it <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, like I said, I could write all day, and maybe I&#39;ve gotten the <br/>
wrong impression, but you sort of hit a nerve there!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Breezy, I am currently in Meridies (say that with a STRONG southern (or as<br/>
they say Meridian) accent.)  I started the SCA in the Midrealm, moved here,<br/>
then a short time in Calafia in Caid and then up to An Tir.  An Tir is where<br/>
my heart is!<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the SCA isn&#39;t supposed to cater to you and that you get out of<br/>
it what you put into it.  And while fighting was a big part of the middle<br/>
ages, there was SO much more.  People were living which means that they were<br/>
cooking, making clothes, building houses, raising children, growing food,<br/>
tending animals, and entertaining themselves.  All the things that fighters<br/>
did when they weren&#39;t fighting.  We have &quot;weekend warriors&quot; and that tends<br/>
to be all they want to do.  The problem I had with the group here is that<br/>
it&#39;s hard to get something started when you don&#39;t have the support of the<br/>
group leader (in this case a baron who hated dancing, only wore garb because<br/>
he had to, took no effort in doing anything medieval - not sure why he is<br/>
even in the SCA - oh yeah, he gets to hit people with stick and feel<br/>
powerful.)  It&#39;s no fun to cook by yourself or explore naming practices of<br/>
the Scandinavian people or make music and especially dance.  It&#39;s a LONG<br/>
story LOL!!  Anyway, as for talking to royalty as I said she was a friend<br/>
and our conversation started off with, &quot;Tell me, honestly, what is happening<br/>
in your barony.&quot;   And at the time I was the seneschale.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946750021">I bookmarked this thread to go back to, and even though it&#39;s a bit old<br/>
I did want to share my BRIEF experience with the SCA.  We ran into the<br/>
SCA in Germany (dad was in the Army).  I became extraordinarily<br/>
interested and started designing coat of arms for the family and the<br/>
like (an ongoing, currently stalled project).  Mom and dad took me to<br/>
one meeting with one participant (not even a group meeting) and when<br/>
we left the meeting they told me they didn&#39;t want me to get involved<br/>
because they were concerned that I would &quot;become obsessed&quot; with it. <br/>
:(<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to include everything I have had an abiding interest in...<br/>
seeing the world through a different point of view (my quick way of<br/>
seeing if I&#39;d be interested in something is if this is an aspect of<br/>
it), medieval lifestyle, chivalry, knights, horesback riding,<br/>
falconry, arts and crafts, the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since that brief meeting over ten years ago, I&#39;ve been interested<br/>
in joining.  But now my life is a bit too complicated and funds too<br/>
tight for me to take the steps necessary... but if I&#39;m honest with<br/>
myself, it&#39;s also probably a little bit of my &quot;good girl&quot; trying to<br/>
avoid getting in trouble with my parents by doing something they<br/>
disapproved of.<br/>

&gt; tight for me to take the steps necessary... but if I&#39;m honest with<br/>
&gt; myself, it&#39;s also probably a little bit of my &quot;good girl&quot; trying to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You will find that most people in the SCA have &quot;tight funds&quot;  :)  I&#39;ve known<br/>
several kings and queens and their first warning to anyone who has the<br/>
desire to fight in the crown list is to either be independently wealthy or<br/>
take out a loan.  Being king is expensive :)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many of us still do (or don&#39;t do) things because of our concern<br/>
of how our own parents might view our actions.<br/>

<br/>
YEP!! We were pretty limited that way when we were dabbling with it.<br/>
<br/>
My first garb was a very inexpensive swath of material I bought, took<br/>
over to a members house and she showed me how to make a simple dress.<br/>
It took one afternoon and very few dollars.<br/>
Most members are REALLY willing to help new folks get set up, many of<br/>
them gave us stuff we could use.<br/>
<br/>
I bought all of our feast gear at places like thrift stores. Some<br/>
simple wooden bowls and pewter mugs. You might even find some good<br/>
candlesticks in your home, I was surprised at how much we could use<br/>
that we already had.<br/>
<br/>
At the big feast in Pensacola (Arabian Nights) they actually kept a<br/>
box of garb for newcomers so you could be dressed appropriately by<br/>
borrowing.  They WANT folks to check it out and get involved. Don&#39;t<br/>
let money hold you back!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sca.org">http://www.sca.org</a>  From there you can find groups.  I believe there<br/>
is a zipcode finder or at least a state finder.  From there you can go to<br/>
your Kingdom webpage and find out what local groups are near you.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t have a local group don&#39;t let that stop you from going to events<br/>
(general term for feasts, wars, battles, tournaments, classes, etc.) that<br/>
are near you.  Near is also a relative term in the SCA.  A &quot;near&quot; event can<br/>
be something that is 3 hours away or it could be something that is 6 hours<br/>
away, depending on who you talk to and what part of the country you are from<br/>
LOL!!  Virginia isn&#39;t as spread out of a state as somewhere like, say,<br/>
Florida.  I am SO glad that our area of Florida is actually a part of<br/>
Meridies rather than Trimaris as I would end up going to Meridian events<br/>
more than Trimarian events.  You DO NOT have to join your local group nor<br/>
only go to events that are in your kingdom.  It&#39;s fun to go to other<br/>
kingdoms and see different kingdoms&#39; pageantry!  I believe that Virginiai n<br/>
Atlantia and they have a wonderful resource guide for costuming.  It&#39;s even<br/>
bookmarked LOL!<br/>

Even if you aren&#39;t in Atlantia it is still an excellent resource!<br/>
<br/>
As Ren said beginner (or newbie) garb is easy to make and can be done with<br/>
about 4 yards of fabric for an adult and under 2 for a child.  The key is to<br/>
make layers (so you can start with a basic &quot;t-tunic&quot; that you later put<br/>
something under or over)  After a while you will be surprised that you are<br/>
haunting fabric stores for sales and mill ends. Some fabric stores offer<br/>
discounts if you are buying a whole or a remainder of a bolt of fabric. I<br/>
got an estra 10% savings not long ago because I threw a bolt of cloth on the<br/>
counter and said, &quot;I want what&#39;s here.&quot;  So I got 40% off for it being on<br/>
sale and then an additional 10% off for taking the rest of a bolt.  They<br/>
like to do that more than having small pieces that they have to put as<br/>
remants.  Remnants are also great places to pick up small pieces of<br/>
expensive fabrics for things such as bags, pouches, coifs, hats, headwear,<br/>
veils, etc. I got some lovely $12 a yard silk that was not quite a yard and<br/>
it was marked down from $10 to $4!  So now I have fabric for a beautiful<br/>
lightweight veil. Oh and if you have a Jo Ann&#39;s fabric near you, they had 2<br/>
coupons for 50% off one item this coming Friday and Saturday (one for each<br/>
day)  And yes, their % off coupons can be used on fabric, just make sure to<br/>
give it to the person who is cutting your fabric at the time.  I have 4<br/>
coupons (2 for each day and from different sources - one from the mail one<br/>
from the paper) so I&#39;m planning on picking up something lovely for myself<br/>
this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Feast gear is easy to come by.  I don&#39;t like pewter as it puts a funny taste<br/>
in your mouth and can also leach lead (not a good thing).  I tend to stick<br/>
more with wooden or bamboo (for longevity&#39;s sake).  Pampered Chef has these<br/>
really cool bamboo serving spoons that are great for soups and make great<br/>
feastware!  I&#39;ve sold quite a few to SCA folks (not that I&#39;m hawking my<br/>
wares, just showing you the variety of places you can find cheap<br/>
feastware).  Wooden handled knives and two prong forks are also great for<br/>
feastware.  Thrift stores and resale shops are great for these kinds of<br/>
things.  POttery is also a great feastware and I&#39;ve found tons of &quot;first<br/>
pots&quot; bowls, plates and mugs that first year pottery students have made that<br/>
are perfect for feast ware.  A simple tablecloth (white usually) a pair of<br/>
brass candlesticks (if they allow open flame) a plate, mug and spoon and<br/>
knife and you are set (don&#39;t forget a napkin!  LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Old sheets and blankets are great for making garb (costumes) with.  The<br/>
cotten woven blankets that have cording running through them look very<br/>
period!  And sheets from thrift stores are great because you can get LARGE<br/>
amounts of fabric for a little bit of money.  Also old curtains as long as<br/>
they don&#39;t have rubberized linings are great for making fancier gowns,<br/>
tunics, and bodices (if you go late period).  I would try to stay away from<br/>
most pattern companies&#39; &quot;historic costumes&quot; for the middle ages.  It was<br/>
simply put together.  I think that their historic costume patterns for more<br/>
recent periods (such as Revolutionary and Civil war era) are more accurate<br/>
(or at least look that way from someone who has only studied that period on<br/>
the periphery).<br/>
<br/>
The SCA can be as expensive or as frugal as you choose it to be.  YOu can do<br/>
high Elizabethan down to the gold earrings and platform shoes with a period<br/>
pavillion with your arms painted on the roof or you can go peasant with<br/>
simple garb and a dome tent.<br/>
