<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107806531">Since reading this list obsessively for a few weeks, I just keep having the<br/>
same image come to mind and now I realize it has always been there. I am not<br/>
sure if I can articulate it very clearly, though.<br/>
<br/>
A child in my home has generally been extremely malleable--- meaning that he<br/>
responded well to behavior modification. DH and I were totally<br/>
congratulating ourselves at having trained him well. He does as he is told<br/>
on a regular basis with little grumbling. I think he even understands that<br/>
in our household (the way it has been) that doing as he is told or asked is<br/>
the very best way to get exactly what he wants.  But I knew that just wasn&#39;t<br/>
right!  There was a dark cloud lurking in my subconscious-indeed the very<br/>
one that led me here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I kept seeing this vague vision of pushing, pushing, pushing and then hoping<br/>
that my child makes it to adulthood before all the pushing makes him crack!<br/>
Working him like a piece of dough, rolling him out, fortifying him, rolling<br/>
him out and hoping I wouldn&#39;t do that one little extra whatever that would<br/>
cause him to no longer be malleable.  All the time really hating &quot;breaking&quot;<br/>
him at all. It all seemed so damn manipulative. (it is!!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just knew that as long as the kids are buying what I&#39;m selling, as long as<br/>
they believe me, they will respond well to my so-called guidance. But I also<br/>
quite clearly remember (and harbor to this day) the evil glee and abject<br/>
terror that I felt when I realized that my parent was not infallible, was<br/>
not right most of the time in fact, and that I could *and did* fool that<br/>
parent on a regular basis. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was living in dread of the day when my kids would see through me and know<br/>
that really, they only have to do what they want to do. And how would I<br/>
counter that? Sheer force? Brutality? Benign neglect? I realized that I<br/>
don&#39;t want to control them! I don&#39;t want to impose a set of rules that is<br/>
supposed to apply to everything so that they can get by in life. I want them<br/>
to question, to find the best solution, to be open-minded, to love and<br/>
respect themselves. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have known people that grew up &quot;right&quot; i.e. they did what was expected of<br/>
them through High School, only to have a major crisis surrounding the fact<br/>
that the only truth is that they were always free, or should have been. Then<br/>
there were the kids who knew they were free and were labeled problem<br/>
children/teens. These are the kids who on some level see rules as arbitrary,<br/>
who see doing anything they don&#39;t want to do as a waste of their time. These<br/>
ideas are not okay in our society for kids or anyone else to have! But y&#39;all<br/>
know that. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think I have essentially one of each type of child in my home and<br/>
I would much rather not ride them until they are broken, not GAMBLE on the<br/>
timing of the eventual breakdown that will ensue that will take them out<br/>
from under my control.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a better analogy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It just feels so natural to surrender to their sovereignty and to claim my<br/>
own and to respect both realities.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just keep having this vision and lately keep sighing a breath of relief<br/>
that I don&#39;t have to gamble on this anymore. I can treat these kids like<br/>
people and do my best and assume they are doing their best and fill them up<br/>
with love and power instead of breaking them down so that I can control<br/>
them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833882442">Beautifully put. Thank you for describing your thought processes. You  <br/>
should consider putting that all down in an article for publication!<br/>
