<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570649465">One statistic you could use is how many unschooling conferences there are,<br/>
and their respective historical attendance.  Even though the # of<br/>
unschoolers can&#39;t be known precisely, it may be interesting to also note how<br/>
many people are checking it out.  I know the RE conference has had 11 years<br/>
now.  Don&#39;t know if they kept a record of attendance, but possibly.  If so,<br/>
that could provide an interesting addition.<br/>

<br/>
We had 154 families attend the Live and Learn Unchooling Conference <br/>
last weekend. But we have 567 famlies that are *members* of the elist. <br/>
So that is how many have attended in the past or want to attend in the <br/>
future. And that&#39;s just *this* conference. I&#39;m sure that LIFEisGood <br/>
Unschooling Conference, NEUnschooling Conference, Living Joyfully <br/>
Unschooling Conference, as well as Aero and Rethinking Education all <br/>
have folks that are not on my list.<br/>
<br/>
THat&#39;s the best start I can think of. You won&#39;t find a more accurate <br/>
*start*. But there are plenty of folks who have no use for conferences <br/>
or who can&#39;t afford them or who are just too far away to bother joining <br/>
the list---plus so many that don&#39;t even know they exist.<br/>
<br/>
UnschoolingBasics has over 1600 members. AlwaysLearning, over 1400. <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled has over 1800, SHINEwithUnschooling has over 700, and <br/>
RUL, over 950. I don&#39;t know how many UnschoolingDiscussion has on <br/>
Googlegroups, but before the move it was over 1600. YOU have 166 at <br/>
Unerzogen! I&#39;m sure there are groups in Australia and Great Britain <br/>
that I don&#39;t even know about. I DO know that there is an annual <br/>
unschooling gathering in England--I can&#39;t remember the name <br/>
though---anyone? anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Then there is Not Back To School Camp and Quo Vadis--more numbers there.<br/>
<br/>
Granted: many of us are on more than one list. But many people choose <br/>
only one or two lists to join. Some never join *any* list---they just <br/>
do what they do. Many fly under the radar.<br/>
<br/>
I *will* guesstimate thousands of families unschool in the <br/>
industrialized countries. (Many, many more, if not almost everyone in <br/>
under-developed and developing countries---so that&#39;s a LOT! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If you want numbers of *children*, then you can multiply the above <br/>
numbers a bit &#39;cause usually it&#39;s just one parent who reads.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry there&#39;s no database of unschoolers---that&#39;s just not going to <br/>
happen! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
