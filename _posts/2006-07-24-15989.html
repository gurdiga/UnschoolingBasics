<div id="ygrps-yiv-668521992">I was wondering how radical unschoolers handle the transition <br/>

Cameron turned 18 this year, and his former classmates and many of his <br/>
friends graduated high school. We gave him the option to have a <br/>
&#39;celebratory-anything-he-wanted&#39;, but he declined. He figured he&#39;d just <br/>
keep on keepin&#39; on.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, the day his girlfriend graduated high school, he signed a <br/>
contract for a year-long commitment with a local, extablished R&B band. <br/>
And his own garage band is upstairs now practicing for their first <br/>
paying gig this Thursday night. They are pumped!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s making money doing what he loves.<br/>
<br/>
He still has the option for some kind of ceremony or party or <br/>
something. Maybe he will decide on some coming of age gig---maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
But his &#39;adulthood&#39; has just kind of eased up on him and us naturally, <br/>
and he&#39;s ok with that.<br/>

I think it depends on the kid. Some might like the opportunity to have a  big <br/>
party, maybe even a ritual, that marks the transition from &quot;kid&quot; to  &quot;adult.&quot; <br/>
 Others might hate that.  I would tend not to call it a  &quot;graduation&quot; unless <br/>
the honored person really liked that, but parties are really  good, and <br/>
something ritualized could be really nice. And of course there could  be <br/>
presents.... <br/>
 <br/>
I think it also depends on &quot;what&#39;s next&quot; for the individual. If someone is  <br/>
planning college or something, maybe they&#39;d like something more traditional -- <br/>
I  don&#39;t know. <br/>
 <br/>
The cool thing about all this is that it can look any way appropriate for  <br/>
the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508494023">I think a coming of age party would be awesome. We had planned  <br/>
something similar for our kids even when in school, and after reading  <br/>
these posts, I see it is even more needful in the eyes of family.  I  <br/>
bought dh a book one year for father&#39;s day &quot;Boys&#39; Passage, Man&#39;s  <br/>
Journey&quot;, It is a Christian based book, but it speaks very distinctly  <br/>
about how children in our society don&#39;t have the benefit that many  <br/>
other societies have, of having a delineated passage into man (and  <br/>
woman-) hood. One of those take what you need books. There are surely  <br/>
many books on what, why and how.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466681825">My wonderful sister realized that all the other cousins were getting  <br/>
&quot;graduation&quot; presents and that my kids weren&#39;t. So she started giving  <br/>
them occasional little cash gifts for different reasons - she just  <br/>
gave Rosie a really nice congratulations card with a $20 bill in it,  <br/>
for earning her Girl Scout Silver Award.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible time to have a big shindig for kids, in place of a  <br/>
graduation gift, is a big going-away bash if they decide to go  <br/>
somewhere else - traveling or living for a while. We did that for  <br/>
Roya - had a huge beach party and bonfire and invited lots of people.  <br/>
She went off and traveled for a few months and then came back - she  <br/>
had been planning on staying away for a year, but it didn&#39;t work out  <br/>
that way. Still the going-away party was awesome. I used Sandra&#39;s  <br/>
Certificate of Empowerment which she modified to be given to a young  <br/>
adult - framed it and read it aloud around the bonfire and gave it to  <br/>
Roya.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485621679">After responding to this topic yesterday, I spoke to Julian with an idea he  <br/>
loved.<br/>
 <br/>
Julian is planning to apply to Berklee School of Music in Boston. What  <br/>
occurred to me, which he loved, was for him to present a concert to his family  and <br/>
friends, maybe some words in there. He can invite other important musicians  <br/>
in his life to do some songs with him as well, then finish up with a big <br/>
party. <br/>
 <br/>
We have lots of time to plan, and he wants to do this (at least right now),  <br/>
and I think it could be really cool.<br/>
