&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Something I do for public talks, is a quiz. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t find a<br/>
&gt; copy of it in my conference notes, I&#39;ll post it verbatim if I have it<br/>
&gt; with me.<br/>
&gt; Basically, the quiz asks people to list their interests, hobbies, what<br/>
&gt; they do to earn money etc.... In the right hand column they make a<br/>
&gt; mark for each of those topics they learned to be capable at while in<br/>
&gt; school. The average is 1-3 out of 13-25. And once we hone in on what<br/>
&gt; those learned in school are, they realize it would have been an easy<br/>
&gt; thing to learn outside of school. It loosens people up and makes them<br/>
&gt; realize how schooling hasn&#39;t contributed much at ALL to their<br/>
&gt; learning.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Ren, that sounds like a great tool (and nice to hear from you at<br/>
&gt; the conference...I&#39;m try to not be depressed!).  If you happen to have<br/>
&gt; it with you that would be great.   The info night isn&#39;t until next Thur<br/>
