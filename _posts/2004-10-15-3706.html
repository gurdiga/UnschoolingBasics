<div id="ygrps-yiv-374086897">Does anyone have any ideas to stop thumb sucking?  My daughter will <br/>
be five in a couple of months and she is still sucking her thumb.  It <br/>
has already given her an open bite, but the dentist told us if she <br/>
stops before age 6(around the time permanent teeth will start to come <br/>
in)it can correct itself.  I know I have probably more than a year, <br/>
but that is how I felt two years ago and we haven&#39;t made any <br/>
progress.  She is okay wih wearing a bandaid during the day and this <br/>
stops her, but she needs her thumb at night.  Dh is trying to enforce <br/>
too much at once.  He basically is trying to make her go cold turkey <br/>
and I don&#39;t think this will work. Ds had a pacifier until 17 months <br/>
when I put him in daycare for 7 months. They suggested I try to get <br/>
him to give it up, due to other children possibly sharing it with <br/>
him. I took the pacifier away cold turkey and he proceeded to bite <br/>
his finger nails for two years.<br/>
<br/>
I should mention that because she sucks her thumb she also seems to <br/>
get sick more often.  We try to wash her hands often to avoid this <br/>
transfer of germs, but sometimes we are not quick enough.  She is <br/>
prone to respiratory problems, which often include a trip to the ER, <br/>
when she gets sick.  So this issue is also for her health as well as <br/>
dental care.  <br/>
<br/>
Please help,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thumbsucking doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with illness.  She is exposed to the germs that are around her 24/7 sticking her thumb in her mouth isn&#39;t going to make the germs any less there.  The human mouth is a filthy thing in its own right.  Kids are sticking things in their mouths all the time, not just their thumbs.  Most respiratory illnesses are passed through airborne bacteri and virii.<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked to her in a nonsensical manner about why thumbsucking can cause her teeth to shift?  Some kids react well to just knowing *why* they should or shouldn&#39;t do something.  For instance handwashing after one goes potty never sunk in with my middle child until we talked about (in a very scientific manner) the kinds of germs and waste that she was exposed to when she went potty.  Also, what are the chances that she would need braces anyway?  Did you or her father need braces?  Could her thumbsucking be coincidental to what her teeth would do anyway?  I&#39;m not saying just let her suck her thumb and deal with the consequences later, but it may be a moot point if she is a candidate for braces anyway.  Another thought is that I have known quite a few kids who just naturally stopped sucking their thumbs when their front teeth started becoming loose.  It was too uncomfortable and by the time those front four teeth had finally all come out they were out of the habit.<br/>
<br/>
Just food for thought<br/>

<br/>
You aren&#39;t listening to the &quot;experts&quot; that say your child should be <br/>
in school, but you&#39;re going to trust a dentist over your child?<br/>
It&#39;s HER body. It&#39;s an abuse to force someone to stop doing that <br/>
which comforts them.<br/>
Worst case, you have to pay for some orthodontia later in life, <br/>
isn&#39;t that preferable to counseling? Children are SO disrespected in <br/>
this society, and this is one of the issues that really, really <br/>
bothers me.<br/>
Taking away a form of comfort is coldhearted at best.<br/>
Dentists often blame thumb sucking when that same child would have <br/>
had the EXACT same problems had they never sucked their thumbs.<br/>
<br/>
My sister sucked her thumb until she was 12 y.o. and has PERFECT <br/>
teeth. My oldest ds sucked his thumb until around 11y.o. and has <br/>
beautiful teeth, probably won&#39;t need braces ever. <br/>
I stopped sucking fairly early and had braces for two years. So the <br/>
dentists don&#39;t know as much as they think they do.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to your child, not some expert. You are hurting her by trying <br/>
to control her body. You are only going to harm your relationship <br/>
with her in the end, she WILL suck her thumb, but instead of feeling <br/>
comfortable, she&#39;ll feel shame. You can&#39;t control another human <br/>
being, only make them ACT like they&#39;re doing what you want. Behind <br/>
your back she&#39;ll continue to suck her thumb.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to know of an adult that is 34 years old, was shamed for <br/>
sucking her thumb so does it in secret to this day. Forcing children <br/>
to give up things before they are ready on their own, can cause <br/>
neurotic behavior later. yucky.<br/>
<br/>
Thumb sucking is perfectly normal at that age and well beyond. Trust <br/>
your child....she knows exactly what she needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012642375">HI Kerry!<br/>
  I did the thumb thing til I was 6, and just quit on my own.  My <br/>
teeth are all ok, but I can still remember people giving me such a <br/>
hard time about it and not understanding WHY they did that bothered <br/>
me.<br/>
  And this is off topic, but you mentioned you daughter getting sick <br/>
alot.  I just have to ask if she has been checked for asthma?  My DS <br/>
was 5 or 6 before I finally asked the doctor if that was what was <br/>
going on with him.  Trips to ER from illness every winter.  <br/>
Especially after being around his triggers.  Something I didn&#39;t even <br/>
realize was going on!  His symptoms were so minor, and no one at the <br/>
hospital ever said or asked or diagnosed him with asthma. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668203031">Hi Syndi,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have been told that she gets asthma when she gets a cold.  My <br/>
son was just in the hospital for two days with this same ailment, his <br/>
first episode.  We were vacationing out of state, when I recognized <br/>
the symptoms.  I only was aware of them because of my daughter&#39;s <br/>
symptoms.  The doctors in the ER told us that it is asthma-like and <br/>
not asthma, because they are too young to be diagnosed with asthma.  <br/>
They then referred to it as a respiratory disorder.  So you can seen <br/>
with them both being prone to it I now want to avoid as many cold <br/>
virus&#39; as possible.  This episode with my son was vey scary.  We were <br/>
transported from his doctor&#39;s office via ambulance to the hospital.  <br/>
We were told they could outgrow these episodes.  That&#39;s what we are <br/>
hoping for as ds already has a severe nut allergy and we already <br/>
worry about not outgrowing that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143334146">I know that in cities, asthma rates were becoming so high as to be<br/>
alarming, especially in infants and children, and pollution was<br/>
assumed to be the cause.  15 years ago, parents were becoming more<br/>
active in trying to eradicate things like city driving (at least here<br/>
in Toronto) in favour of public transit, bike programs, etc.  They<br/>
even talked about shutting down main streets like Queen St W, to be<br/>
used for foot traffic only, or at least, make it a one way.<br/>
<br/>
Now doctors will NOT diagnose it in children at all, even if they are<br/>
experencing all symptoms.  My son, child of 2 asthmatic parents,<br/>
showed many symtoms, and gets wheezy whenever the pollution index is<br/>
high.  He&#39;s been prescribed various bronchio-dilators, including<br/>
becloforte(?) and ventolin, but the doctor will only say &quot;asthma-like<br/>
symptoms&quot; and is very careful to not say &quot;asthma&quot;.  He cannot heal<br/>
fully from a cold without the aid of these drugs, yet he is &quot;not<br/>
asthmatic&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(20 years ago, whenever I told a doctor I had asthma, the next<br/>
question was how often to you take ventolin)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how connected these things are, and whether in a few years<br/>
they&#39;ll announce how asthma is &quot;barely existant any more, so please be<br/>
assured, pollution is not a problem.&quot;  Perhaps eradicating asthma<br/>
itself is easier than addressing the root cause. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, but then, I&#39;m prone to paranoia.<br/>

told me, like they told you, that it would be brought on by colds.  <br/>
Then as he got older, turns out September is a very very bad month <br/>
for colds/asthma.  <br/>
  Kaleb is now 11.5 years old. And even tough this September we went <br/>
thru it all again, he made it thru without the hospital !  This is <br/>
the 1st year he&#39;s been able to do that, and got thru it without all <br/>
the meds. Ohh, I take that one back, we did have to do a round of <br/>
prednisone.  Hopefully in a few more years he won&#39;t have any of it.<br/>

had to take medication for a few years, cut the medication at about 5 <br/>
years old and used an inhaler occasionally and got nebulizer treatments <br/>
a few times when things got bad (after a cold). By 12 it was gone. <br/>
She&#39;s 19 now - no sign of asthma for years. Several pediatricians told <br/>
me that they were just referring to it as being &quot;asthma-like&quot; so that <br/>
would justify the treatment, but not label her as &quot;asthmatic&quot; because <br/>
they thought she might grow out of it (as she did) and we would not <br/>
want that label in her medical records forever.<br/>

Does  anyone have any ideas to stop thumb sucking?  My daughter will <br/>
be  five in a couple of months and she is still sucking her thumb.  It  <br/>
has already given her an open bite, but the dentist told us if she  <br/>
stops before age 6(around the time permanent teeth will start to come  <br/>
in)it can correct itself.  I know I have probably more than a year,  <br/>
but that is how I felt two years ago and we haven&#39;t made any  <br/>
progress. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No ideas---nor do I think it&#39;s a problem. I sucked my thumb until I was at  <br/>
least 11----maybe 12. I have a slight overbite, but so does my mother, and she  <br/>
never sucked her thumb. My overbite never required braces----in fact, my <br/>
teeth  look really good for someone who never had braces. Neither of my boys <br/>
sucked  their thumbs, and their overbites are minor. No braces there either! Genes <br/>
are  amazing!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She is okay wih wearing a bandaid during the day  and this <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stops her, but she needs her thumb at night.  Dh is trying  to enforce <br/>
too much at once.  He basically is trying to make her go  cold turkey <br/>
and I don&#39;t think this will work.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Then I&#39;m guessing she needs that comfort at night. And if she&#39;s dealing  with <br/>
the stress during the day withOUT thumb-sucking, she may need it MUCH more  <br/>
at night. Why deny this? And why make her MORE distrustful and unhappy?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ds had a pacifier until 17 months <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when I put him in  daycare for 7 months. They suggested I try to get <br/>
him to give it up, due  to other children possibly sharing it with <br/>
him. I took the pacifier away  cold turkey and he proceeded to bite <br/>
his finger nails for two  years.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Poor little guy---his only form of self-comfort was forceably taken away,  so <br/>
he relieved stress with nail-biting.<br/>
 <br/>
The day care was denying ALL those little kids a natural (well, an  <br/>
artificial substitute!&lt;g&gt;) stress reliever: sucking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I should mention that because she sucks her thumb she  also seems to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get sick more often.  We try to wash her hands often to  avoid this <br/>
transfer of germs, but sometimes we are not quick enough.   She is <br/>
prone to respiratory problems, which often include a trip to the ER,  <br/>
when she gets sick.  So this issue is also for her health as well as  <br/>
dental care.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I doubt the illness is caused by the thumb-sucking. I&#39;d bet that it&#39;s  caused <br/>
by a depressed immune system caused by the stress of being forced to give  up <br/>
her thumb.<br/>
 <br/>
Back off----cold turkey----and let her have her thumb. When she feels  <br/>
confident and happy and content, I bet she&#39;ll give it up all on her own----and  the <br/>
illness will disappear as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Do more research on thumb-sucking and dental health---and change  dentists!<br/>

other children possibly sharing it with him. I took the pacifier <br/>
away  cold turkey and he proceeded to bite his finger nails for two  <br/>
years.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
DS had a pacifier to use sometimes (like when we were stuck behind a <br/>
hay convey on a tiny two laner in the boonies of Oklahoma with no <br/>
place to pull off to nurse him in sight - longest 15 minutes of my <br/>
life!) Anyhow, once he got his first 4 teeth (front, upper and <br/>
lower) he just spit it out and never looked back. Now he&#39;s 6 and <br/>
sometimes sucks his fingers (one or several). If they start looking <br/>
soggy, I&#39;ll gently take them and dry them - he can then put them <br/>
back or move on to something else. Sometimes he&#39;ll just pop them <br/>
out, &quot;hand&quot; them to me and ask to have them dried. When I see that I <br/>
know to check out the situation because something is getting to him -<br/>
 stress, boredom, something and if I can use the little gap while <br/>
he&#39;s sucking his fingers to come up with a plan of action, we can <br/>
usually avoid unpleasant meltdowns.</div>
