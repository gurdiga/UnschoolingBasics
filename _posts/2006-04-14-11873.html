<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722278830">&quot; &quot;Quit asking what Zak is learning and just trust that he is<br/>
getting what he needs for the day?  When we keep asking him what he&#39;s<br/>
learning, it makes him feel as if he needs to live up to OUR<br/>
standards.&quot; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could just ask &quot;how was your day?&quot; or &quot;what was the best part<br/>
about your day?&quot; if Zak wouldn&#39;t mind that.<br/>
Then he could feel informed without having Zak feel quizzed. Or maybe<br/>
you could just joyfully spew about the day before he gets a chance to<br/>
ask!! That worked well for Markus in the earlier days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531907239">Thats a great idea!  I was a little tough on my dh only because,<br/>
without meaning too, he&#39;s sort of scared Zak off of from telling him<br/>
anything.  For instance; two weeks ago Zak had learned on his own<br/>
volition about how to find the radius of a circle.  He was all excited<br/>
and couldn&#39;t wait to tell Donnie all about it...Well, long story<br/>
short, Zak told him and Donnie was like, &quot;Oh, ah-huh, good job Zak.&quot; <br/>
HE then proceeds to give Zak lessons on finding the area of a<br/>
rectangle and how to figure out how much a cylinder can hold.  Poor<br/>
Zak just followed him around the house looking all pathetic, while he<br/>
was taken to websites for formulas and everything.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking, he ONLY wanted to show you one thing.  Well, it was just<br/>
yesterday when Zak picked up the book again because he was worried dad<br/>
would make him do all this other stuff.  LOL  He&#39;s now hesitant to<br/>
share his passions with Donnie.  <br/>
