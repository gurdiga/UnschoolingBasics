<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067560742">All true.  I have to step back and remember not to be defensive that there is no reason for it.  sometimes I am just &quot;to emotional&quot; or something.  I agree that this whole community has had great advice!!  <br/>

&gt;    I&#39;ve been following this conversation and I sent Jennifer a personal<br/>
<br/>
&gt; e-mail even! When I seen your name I had to open the post.  You are<br/>
<br/>
&gt; wonderful and encouraging someone.  I think that helping her step through<br/>
<br/>
&gt; her obstacles is what she was asking for and some of us were not as<br/>
<br/>
&gt; encourgaging.  I just wanted to personally thank you -- you are one that has<br/>
<br/>
&gt; always had great ways to help me through hang ups and dilemmas I have had<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and do have through out my unschooling path.  thank you for your light.<br/>

Thank you very much. I am happy to know that my journey has helped another<br/>
<br/>
full and connect more fully with her child/ren. As flattering as that is, I<br/>
<br/>
do believe that everyone on here is offering encouragement in the form of<br/>
<br/>
helpful advice. Each person needs are different and what you or I may think<br/>
<br/>
is harsh another harsh another person may find to be exactly what they need.<br/>
<br/>
I personally love a direct kick in the butt style. I have been practicing<br/>
<br/>
kindness more since Meredith wrote that amazing post a few weeks ago and I<br/>
<br/>
hope that is reflected more in my writing style.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love this list for what it is, a huge community of folks helping one<br/>
<br/>
another their own way. Each of us comes with our own different way.Whatever<br/>
<br/>
helps people grow on the unschooling journey is wonderful :-)<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that if you read something that offends you first try to<br/>
<br/>
figure out why. Dig deep. Challenge yourself. And if you don&#39;t need it or it<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t resonate let it go and accept that it likely helped someone else.<br/>
