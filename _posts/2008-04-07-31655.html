<div id="ygrps-yiv-150791493"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; is there any time<br/>
&gt; in your kid&#39;s life when you noticing them WANTING to sit down for a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>meal<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with the adults?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For years I made sit-down meals for my DH and DS. when my son got a little<br/>
older, he would have something else b/c he is not much of a meat eater. When<br/>
my DH went on his current job, I didn&#39;t make sit-down meals when he wasn&#39;t<br/>
there, and my son loved it. He&#39;s just snack (good stuff, he eats healthier<br/>
than  I do!) all day. Then about six months ago, he wanted sit-down meals,<br/>
even if it&#39;s only me and him.He was 16, is 17 now.<br/>
<br/>
Hope his makes sense, I have a bad cold and headache. : )<br/>
