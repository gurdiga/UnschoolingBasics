  Thanks for your interest.My point was that my husband spent very <br/>
little time at school.But-he did learn auto mechanics from his father <br/>
and has a career doing that(he never did get his h/s diploma)which is <br/>
good!<br/>
  I know the school system let him down as it does many but what do <br/>
you do when your child wants to go to college and can hardly spell or <br/>
things like that because he never cared to learn?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aha - I see your point &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
Kids who go to school are so turned off to learning that it is actually <br/>
POSSIBLE to think they might never care to learn things that are <br/>
important for them to achieve the things they want to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
That is hard to even imagine - for unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I now have THREE kids going to college. Yep - number 3 just signed up <br/>
for her first two college courses - a beginning voice class and a <br/>
musical theater techniques class. My oldest is starting at the <br/>
university - as a junior and my second is continuing at the community <br/>
college - this is her 4th year taking courses there. All are &quot;A&quot; <br/>
students. They have not done any school work - no assignments, no <br/>
tests, no grades, no essays, no worksheets, no textbooks --- absolutely <br/>
nothing like that.<br/>
<br/>
My goal has been to nurture their love of learning - not worrying much <br/>
about what they were learning, just that the interests they had were <br/>
supported and that I filled their lives with opportunities to satisfy <br/>
their natural desire to expand their knowledge base.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve learned. Not exactly what the schools claim they &quot;should&quot; learn <br/>
- much more and much less. More about the things they&#39;re interested in <br/>
and a lot less than what you&#39;d see on the lists of school standards. <br/>
But, not even the top students in school really learn all that stuff - <br/>
they just memorize and spit it out on tests and forget it. What bits <br/>
stay stuck in their heads are useless fragments - not helpful in really <br/>
being able to THINK about things.<br/>

<br/>
You seem really worried about the future Jeanne....some of that is <br/>
normal parent stuff, but a lot of it is school fears seeping in.<br/>
Who says they need college?<br/>
If the child chooses college, who says they need to be great <br/>
spellers? Lots of people never become great spellers, luckily not <br/>
everyone needs to be in order to succeed!<br/>
A child that really WANTS college, will practice the things they <br/>
need in order to embrace that part of their journey, or they&#39;ll <br/>
decide that college is not their cuppa.<br/>
How do you think forced lessons turn someone into great spellers? At <br/>
what cost do they become great spellers?<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t trade curiosity, joy or love of learning for good <br/>
spelling....neither will prospective employers!! Unless they&#39;re <br/>
going to be editors or something...:)<br/>
<br/>
If the child never cared to learn spelling (which is picked up very <br/>
naturally as a person reads, ask questions and such...just like math <br/>
and everything else in the whole wide world) and find a need for it, <br/>
they&#39;ll learn it. Or they won&#39;t. Why spend one second today, worried <br/>
about a future that probably won&#39;t happen anyway?<br/>
<br/>
My bil isn&#39;t a very good speller. He makes over $100k per year, so <br/>
it certainly hasn&#39;t affected his income potential. On the other <br/>
hand, he has a lot of fear about leaving a high paying job to do <br/>
something he really LOVES, I consider that a much bigger deficit.<br/>

 <br/>
OK----Where in the world did you hear that there was ever an unschooling  <br/>
child who wants to go to college but can&#39;t hardly spell because he never cared  <br/>
to learn?? How in the world can you be interested in unschooling---even  <br/>
fleetingly---and think a child won&#39;t want to learn?<br/>
 <br/>
Tenet ONE of unschooling: Humans are hard-wired to learn. We CRAVE  <br/>
learning.We NEED to learn. It&#39;s part of our make-up.That&#39;s how we invented  spaceships <br/>
and bulldozers and cameras and the cotton gin and pencils and  LANGUAGE! We <br/>
need to know more about our environment and how things work and how  to make <br/>
them work better. How to communicate and get places faster and heal  ourselves. <br/>
This is what we DO.<br/>
 <br/>
A child who wants to go to college will prepare himself to go. If he wants  <br/>
to learn to spell better, he will. If he wants to build skyscrapers or be a  <br/>
horse whisperer, he&#39;ll do what&#39;s needed to reach that goal. It&#39;s what we  DO.<br/>
 <br/>
What are your passions? What do you love to do most? How did you learn it?  <br/>
Why? Who helped you learn it? What could have stopped you from  learning it?<br/>
 <br/>
Our goal in unschooling is to have children who LOVE TO LEARN. Who can find  <br/>
the answers to their questions.Who think of themselves as  <br/>
life-learners/doers/experimenters/ Who have happy, rich, fulfilled lives. Who  know they are <br/>
capable.<br/>
 <br/>
The goal is not a good college and a well-paying job (although both  are <br/>
quite possible and quite common). But neither of those is a guarantee of  anything.<br/>
 <br/>
That &quot;never cared to learn&quot; statement is the one that&#39;s bugging me  most. I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to get it out of my head.<br/>
 <br/>
I watched bright, eager children go into school at four years old as  <br/>
sponges----THRILLED to be at school. I watched them year after year after year  get <br/>
more and more disillusioned. Many eventually learned to hate learning.  (I&#39;m <br/>
not the only one to have seen this; ask around. YOU seem like one of these  <br/>
kids!) My child, at 12 was almost completely turned off to learning. He healed.  <br/>
So can you.<br/>
 <br/>
Try to keep your child from walking. Talking. Asking questions. Try it. You  <br/>
*can* do it! Schools do it all the time. It&#39;s their specialty. But put that <br/>
same  child in a rich environment where he can explore and ask questions---where <br/>
he&#39;s  ENCOURAGED to learn. He won&#39;t be able to help it. He&#39;s hard-wired that  <br/>
way.<br/>
 <br/>
You need to do some more reading about unschooling. Hell, no you don&#39;t! You  <br/>
NEED to look at your child! He&#39;s the expert! Just look at HIM!<br/>

<br/>
I want to add a caution here....<br/>
I think parents new to unschooling sometimes expect a child that is <br/>
suddenly given freedom to do all these academic things. All those <br/>
unschoolers said that children are hard wired to LEARN afterall!!<br/>
<br/>
But part of unschooling being able to unfold the way we&#39;re <br/>
describing it (99% of the equation really) is for the parent to SEE <br/>
things differently. An unschooling parent really must SEE the <br/>
learning in absolutely everything. When spongebob or fairies or <br/>
legos or playdough is honored as much as Greece or 5x2 or lifecycles <br/>
of butterflies, only then can unschooling really work.<br/>
<br/>
It is we, the parents, that need to change. A child is a PERFECT <br/>
unschooler from birth. If we can trust that exploring fairies for <br/>
many years (in my case, Jared has been obsessed with Dragons since <br/>
he was four years old...he&#39;s now 11) is completely worthy, and help <br/>
that child explore that interest as much as they wish, learning WILL <br/>
happen beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, Sierra and I learned all about an island in maine, rolling <br/>
pins and history just from interest in one little old fairy movie <br/>
this last week. Plus, we bought a couple blueberry bushes to plant, <br/>
inspired by the movie and a book titled &quot;Blueberry Shoe&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is everywhere Jeanne. YOU just have to see it, your <br/>
children already know the way.<br/>

to to worry about whether she&#39;s learning first grade skills while in <br/>
first grade. But if you are unschooling, it doesn&#39;t matter that some <br/>
of those skills were learned at various points between the ages of 4 <br/>
and 9! Drilling skills might make a parent/teacher feel like learning <br/>
is taking place daily, but the reality is different. <br/>
<br/>
I feel so much more relaxed and in tune with my kids as they actually <br/>
are these days. I see lots of learning sometimes and not much other <br/>
times. Feels right--tho&#39; it took some getting used to!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767572831">I see this all the time with DS - but since my desk often resembles <br/>
Daniel&#39;s (I&#39;m guessing lol) - I prefer to think of it as a buffet. <br/>
All the &quot;food&quot; is spread out there waiting for you to pick up a <br/>
plate and utensils. You can take whole plates of one thing or sample <br/>
bits of several things. You might come back for more of this or that <br/>
right away. You may decide that this other is just not for you right <br/>
now - or maybe ever. At some point, you&#39;ll probably feel full and <br/>
lounge back in your seat and relax a bit. Doesn&#39;t look like much is <br/>
happening compared to the active stuff of choosing and eating. But, <br/>
this is the important part - the part where you are digesting what <br/>
you ate and it is becoming part of you, nourishing and nurturing <br/>
growth. When you are ready, you go back for more - maybe some <br/>
familiar items, maybe some new items, probably a mix and maybe now <br/>
that you decided fish is not awful, you&#39;ll try a new type of fish <br/>
and branch out that way or maybe even try sushi and fall in love <br/>
with Asian cuisine. The possibilities are endless.</div>

Thank  you!  Thank you! Thank you!  I  really needed to hear this  today!<br/>
I just hopped on this list to read(and do  my usual lurking - I  am new<br/>
to the group)but was going to write today about  my concerns  with my<br/>
son (that I just found out happen to be very similar to  what  you went<br/>
through).  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome,  Kim!<br/>
<br/>
I seems I get the most fan mail when I say how tough it was!   &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************************<br/>
I often lead a parenting workshop through churches I work at. One of  the <br/>
most powerful experiences of it is when parents start telling the truth  about <br/>
how hard it is sometimes. Typically people talk about the successes they  have, <br/>
so when other parents you really respect say, &quot;Yeah, this has been really  <br/>
hard for me,&quot; it can be liberating.<br/>
 <br/>
When we started looking seriously at homeschooling, I got books. One of  them <br/>
was Nancy Wallace&#39;s Better Than School. Great book, really inspirational.  <br/>
Vita and Ishmael spent hours writing operas, becoming musical prodigies, raising <br/>
 livestock. They never seemed to argue with each other or their parents. It  <br/>
sounded really cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, I admit I have an easy kid. He doesn&#39;t have any health issues or  <br/>
learning disabilities, is easy to get along with, etc. I am VERY aware that this  is <br/>
just his personality and has nothing to do with my superior parenting skills. <br/>
 But he&#39;s no Ishmael and Vita. <br/>
 <br/>
I doubt they are. I&#39;m sure Nancy had days when she wanted them to just  leave <br/>
the damned violins alone and be quiet. <br/>
 <br/>
It does help when we share the hard times as well as the amazing ones.  <br/>
Because relationships are messy, and sometimes we (and the kids) are just cranky  <br/>
and obnoxious. Our houses might be messy (well, maybe that&#39;s just me) and the  <br/>
music the kids like is no longer the stuff you like, and that dish has been  <br/>
under the desk for a week. (Why don&#39;t I just pick it up? I don&#39;t know. Lazy,  <br/>
crampy, and cranky.) The really cute kitten keeps biting and it&#39;s annoying. And <br/>
 Beth is a crappy painter and there are drips all over the floor of the  <br/>
bathroom.<br/>
 <br/>
But most of the time I don&#39;t care if the house is messy, I&#39;m starting to  <br/>
like some of Julian&#39;s music (although some of it is just truly awful, I am not  <br/>
their demographic. I&#39;ve never been a 15 year old boy), someone seems to have  <br/>
picked up the dish (or it went deeper, and is no longer visible). The kitten is <br/>
 totally sweet despite the biting, and likes to cuddle. And Beth DID paint <br/>
the  bathroom, and is looks awesome despite the drips.<br/>
 <br/>
Knowing we&#39;re not the only ones who sometimes struggle makes it feel less  <br/>
lonely and scary. It also helps us trust that it&#39;ll be okay. If Kelly could have <br/>
 gome through this, there&#39;s hope for all of us.<br/>
