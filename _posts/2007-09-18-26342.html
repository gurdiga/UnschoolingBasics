<div id="ygrps-yiv-273199155">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I had the time to re-read some discussions and some of your websites <br/>
and it gave me some precious &quot;food for thought&quot; about <br/>
using &quot;curriculum&quot; material. <br/>
<br/>
There is some material that I find very attractive, so I&#39;ll try to <br/>
see if my kids share my enthusiasm about it. <br/>
<br/>
I still would like to know what you think about doing some &quot;formal&quot; <br/>
learning, in order to pass the test at the end of the year (though I <br/>
try not to focus too much about it - if he fails, he fails and we&#39;ll <br/>
figure out what to do at that moment, but still, I can&#39;t totally let <br/>
go).<br/>
<br/>
I have another question :) My son would like to learn English. <br/>
Actually, he&#39;d like to learn English, German and Spanish. This year, <br/>
I wont be able to register him to a real &quot;English course&quot; - and I&#39;m <br/>
not totally convinced about them anyway. What else can he do to learn <br/>
a foreign language he&#39;s interested in (apart from going in a foreign <br/>
country) ? Any ideas, suggestions ?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance<br/>
Helen, from Geneva, mother of Sylvain, Cyrielle et Circ√©</div>

The only way to truly learn a language fluently is to be immersed.<br/>
BUT, before you can get to the immersion part it&#39;s fun to play around<br/>
with it and let it become familiar. I think songs are a great way to<br/>
learn words and phrases, much more fun and easy to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
We listen to tapes sometimes or CD&#39;s of Spanish songs. Allows the<br/>
language to become more familiar even though I realize we&#39;ll need to<br/>
head south of the border to truly learn spanish.<br/>

When he was younger, we didn&#39;t have any DVD player, so we watched <br/>
videotapes and they were only in English and he liked them anyway. We <br/>
knew them by heart, he watched his favorite ones hundred times, but <br/>
then we received a DVD player and he preferred to understand what the <br/>
characters were saying ;p <br/>
<br/>
I am actually looking for creative ways to &quot;play around with <br/>
English&quot;. I&#39;ve called one of the English bookstore of Geneva, they <br/>
told me they had plenty of books and CD with songs for kids. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure books would be good, though. But maybe the songs ... ? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037740472">Put on the subtitles and use alternate language tracks when available on<br/>
DVDs - put the sound in French and the subtitles in English then switch<br/>
it to sound in English to be able to hear the cadence with subtitles in<br/>
French to follow the story. And so on - we&#39;ve taken really familiar<br/>
material (like M*A*S*H TV show episodes) and had the subtitles in<br/>

How old are your son? We live part of the year in a foreign country <br/>
(Italy). My kids are bilingual (3 and 6 yrs). It is true that the <br/>
only sure way to learn it well is being immersed. Is your first <br/>
language English? If not, do you have any English speaking friends <br/>
where it is their mother language? One way many kids in Italy learn <br/>
English, is by having an English speaking nanny. I was not a nanny <br/>
but &quot;taught&quot; English to 3 kids by just being with them and playing <br/>
with them only in English for 3 hrs a day. If you could find someone <br/>
(especially good if around your child&#39;s age) that could come and <br/>
play with him in English..this would be the best way!!!<br/>
Of course...this would only be for speaking English. If he wants to <br/>
learn to read and write..that is different...and if he is motivated <br/>
and sounds like he is, then some kind of reading/writing cirriculum <br/>
later may be the best for this.<br/>

get hysterical when they yell &quot;cow!&quot; in French. It&#39;s not like the plot is<br/>
that hard to follow if you don&#39;t fully understand the language : )<br/>
