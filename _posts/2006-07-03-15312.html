<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898685995">~That makes more sense to me now Pat. Thank you for the insight.<br/>
I guess I just tdon&#39;t like a lot of the history surrounding him (Osho).~<br/>
<br/>
Putting it all into context helps, but like anything, take what works<br/>
for you and leave the rest.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to share some parts I like (Osho&#39;s writings are in quotes):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In Zen, and only in Zen, somethign of great import has happened. <br/>
That is, there isn&#39;t any distinction between ordinary life and<br/>
religious life; rather, it has bridged them both.  And Zen uses<br/>
ordinary skills and methods for meditation. That is something of<br/>
tremendous import.  Because if you don&#39;t use ordinary life as a method<br/>
to meditation, your meditation is bound to become something of an escape.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ren:<br/>
I talk a lot about making your daily life, your daily interactions<br/>
your PRACTICE. People are always trying to clear away clutter, or take<br/>
care of something BEFORE getting to their mediation/practice. But if<br/>
day to day life IS your practice, then it turns the ordinary into art,<br/>
the mundane into sacred.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This happens; this unlearning happens.  Unlearning is the process of<br/>
becoming enlightened.  Because you have learned wrong ways, and those<br/>
wrong ways are the barriers, they have to be unlearned.  You are born<br/>
enlightened, and then you are forced into unenlightenment.  You are<br/>
conditioned for an insance society.  Then you are forced to adjust to<br/>
an insane society.  If you remain miserable there is no wonder in it.<br/>
 You will remain miserable because this is not your real nature.  This<br/>
is not the flowering of your being.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschoolers and mindful parents are trying to skip the part <br/>
of their children learning &quot;wrong ways&quot; and becoming unenlightened!:)<br/>
We WANT our children to know themselves, for their being to flower in<br/>
it&#39;s own way and time. Beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The original eye is perfect in itself.  Each child is born with that<br/>
original eye--it is perfect--that innocent eye.  It is perfect!  It<br/>
needs no improvement!  And the effort of all the masters down through<br/>
the ages has been one;  whatesoever the society has done, they have to<br/>
undo.  Whatsoever the society has put into your mind, they have to<br/>
take away.  They have to dehypnotize you, they have to unconditioni<br/>
you.  They have to make your childhood again available to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read this at my talk in Peabody titled, &quot;The Zen of Unschooling&quot;.<br/>
It speaks for itself!:)<br/>
