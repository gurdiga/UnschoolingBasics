<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472540262">&quot;Do I want my kids to just remember me being a grump<br/>
about dishes and laundry and toys, or do I want them to say my mom<br/>
was my mentor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s my main thing. If we&#39;re being grumpy about doing<br/>
something, why would our children WANT to join in? Duh.<br/>
If we&#39;re joyfully caring for our homes, with gratefulness in our<br/>
hearts, that&#39;s a MUCH better invitation to helpers.:)<br/>
