<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106130677">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need your advice/suggestions.  I&#39;m wondering how you balance reading these <br/>
lists & interacting w/your children?  I&#39;ve already gone on the digest versions <br/>
and pared down to just the bare bones, &#39;most valuable&#39; ones to me <br/>
(ShineWithUnschooling, UnschoolingBasics, AlwaysUnschooled), but I am still not doing a <br/>
good job balancing reading/responding to them w/ my daughter needing time w/me. <br/>
 I think I&#39;m becoming addicted to you guys and these conversations!! : )<br/>
<br/>
Emma (5) told me yesterday that she wanted me to get off the computer, that <br/>
it seems like I&#39;m ALWAYS on the computer lately and &quot;let&#39;s go play or DO <br/>
something&quot;...so I shut it down and off we went!  Now, I have to say that we are <br/>
pretty active going out on field trips and exploring, etc....and while we&#39;re home, <br/>
I play a LOT of barbies, my little pony, Polly pockets, and do crafts and <br/>
watch movies, etc.  But I have to agree with her and admit that these lists are <br/>
taking up WAY too much of my/her time.  It&#39;s just that I am getting SO much out <br/>
of them and they (YOU) have been (and continue to be) so inspiring and <br/>
helpful in making our lives better/more joyful....except for the time reading them <br/>
requires :)<br/>
<br/>
How DO you do it?  Is it harder because Em is only 5?  Because she&#39;s an only <br/>
child and I am her sole playmate most of the time?  Do you set a timer for <br/>
yourself/only allot a certain amount of time daily to the lists?  Go online only <br/>
after everyone else has gone to sleep at night?  Make it a point to only lurk <br/>
and not respond?  I&#39;m afraid if I cannot figure out a workable system, I&#39;ll <br/>
have to unsubscribe or in the least, go on &#39;no mail&#39;...and I&#39;m just not ready to <br/>
give you all up just yet! : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792395436">Hi Denise,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like these lists are helping you to be the<br/>
kind of mom you would like to be. yes?<br/>
<br/>
If so, yes, find a way to continue.  Having something<br/>
for yourself will definitely give you more energy to be<br/>
with your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I&#39;ve ever heard about &quot;overwhelm&quot; that<br/>
ALWAYS helps me is to ask yourself, &quot;Am I doing this<br/>
because I CAN or because it is truly Joyful to me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, just because we CAN do something doesn&#39;t<br/>
always mean we &quot;should.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Happy Balancing to you! :))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243066507">Just a practical answer to your question:<br/>
<br/>
When I first found the lists it was overwhelming to me too, but I <br/>
enjoyed them so much. I was on the computer several times a day to <br/>
keep up with it. That was TOO much for me and the kids. So... I went <br/>
no mail and check them at the site each day - once. Sometimes I even <br/>
skip days. I usually do it after everyone is in bed, and I mostly <br/>
lurk...with an occasional post or question when really needed. Just <br/>
how I handle it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756564887">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I need your advice/suggestions.  I&#39;m wondering how you balance reading<br/>

w/me. <br/>
 I think I&#39;m becoming addicted to you guys and these conversations!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The person who has the most problem with the time I spend online is my dh.<br/>
He feels that it cuts into the time I should be spending with him, or<br/>
attending to his errands and the housework. I am still working on this, and<br/>
it has gotten a lot better since I started sending him some of the longer<br/>
posts I have made. Recently he got onto two dads&#39; lists, and was remarking<br/>
with astonishment about the volume (35 posts in one WEEK - he thinks that&#39;s<br/>
a lot) and how the posts seem to draw him in and need lengthy and thoughtful<br/>
responses. Welcome to my world! <br/>
<br/>
I generally get my emailing done in disjointed snatches. I am on four busy<br/>
lists that I receive mail on: Basics, U/D, AlwaysUnschooled and<br/>
AlwaysLearning. In addition I am on my local group list, which is more along<br/>
the lines of announcements most of the time. Sometimes I mix up which list I<br/>
am replying to, and this is not always a good thing. Most of the time I am<br/>
sitting down to the computer when Jayn is busy or sleeping, and dh is out or<br/>
sleeping. Of course it is way faster without distractions. Sometimes<br/>
something will be preying on my mind and I can&#39;t sleep until I have replied<br/>
- even if I don&#39;t immediately send the reply. Also I have a laptop and there<br/>
are times when Jayn is playing next to me on the floor, or I can take my<br/>
computer to be next to where she is working on computer or with her art<br/>
stuff. These multitasking moments are rare and treasured.<br/>
<br/>
I make these lists the foundation of my parenting journey. They have made me<br/>
a better parent, and I find that the really time and energy consuming part<br/>
is the thinking of replies rather than the actual reading. <br/>
<br/>
When the lists are very active, I tend to skim over the threads that are<br/>
specifically about teens, computer games or books older kids are reading.<br/>
There are individuals whose writing I would pause to read if they were<br/>
writing out their grocery list, regardless of topic, whose insights are<br/>
valuable no matter what. Rarely there are individuals who I usually skip<br/>
altogether if experience has shown me a lack of simpatico. For these reasons<br/>
I just can&#39;t imagine finding digests simpler, but as someone has mentioned,<br/>
I&#39;m also on a cable modem, not a dial up or timed system.<br/>
<br/>
I move items that may require a reply to my follow up folder and do all my<br/>
replying after I have read most of the days&#39; posts, rather than merely<br/>
reiterate what someone else may have already posted (unless I feel it is so<br/>
important that an extra supportive voice is helpful) or conversely it&#39;s<br/>
something really quick. When replying I think hard about whether I have the<br/>
credibility to speak to an issue. For example it is largely futile for me to<br/>
talk about teenagers or sibling issues, although if no-one is answering in a<br/>
timely manner I might refer to stories others have told in the past. I have<br/>
learnt that posting about my direct experiences in unambiguous language is<br/>
the best way to illustrate the principles of joyously living unschooling. I<br/>
try to ask myself &quot;will this help anyone?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In the past when I have had some kind of deadline, I have gone no-mail<br/>
temporarily. The topics really are cyclic. I wouldn&#39;t feel right doing that<br/>
with the list I am a co-owner on however!<br/>
<br/>
Still there are times when Jayn is calling me, and I am sometimes distracted<br/>
and don&#39;t respond at once, sometimes momentarily frustrated that I am being<br/>
called for &quot;again&quot;. However I think about Valerie and her great example, and<br/>
am getting a lot better at just stopping and walking away from the computer<br/>
or closing the lid for a while. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that has helped me mentally/emotionally. If there are messages <br/>
in my inbox, they are pressuring me to deal with them! Messages on a <br/>
web site are much more benign and can be dealt with on my terms and <br/>
ignored at will. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an expand message feature that puts a bunch of messages on <br/>
one screen, which makes it really easy to skim through. Sometimes <br/>
certain messages don&#39;t wrap and it&#39;s easy to forget which message you <br/>
read last, so YMMV. <br/>
<br/>
I realized last week that I have been spending too much time on the <br/>
computer. Between a couple parenting lists, 3 u/s lists and reading <br/>
political blogs...eek, it was too much. The kids seemed happy playing <br/>
without me and watching tv, but they were starting to fight a little <br/>
more and I realized we had been reading almost no books lately. I&#39;d <br/>
started to think &quot;if they are watching tv, I&#39;m free to be on the <br/>
computer&quot; instead of sitting down with them or being available down <br/>
on the floor as soon as a show ended.<br/>
<br/>
I always feel rushed when posting if dd is awake, because she wants <br/>
to play with the keyboard. I can usually read and interact with the <br/>
kids at the same time, but as soon as I open the keyboard drawer, <br/>
it&#39;s a signal to them that mom is not really paying attention, so <br/>
they&#39;d better come over!<br/>
<br/>
Reading about unschooling and parenting issues do help me tons, so I <br/>
don&#39;t want to give it up. As time goes by and I get more comfortable <br/>
with a subject, I don&#39;t feel the need to post as much. Writing <br/>
REALLY, REALLY helps me sort my thoughts out, so I get a lot out of <br/>
responding to others&#39; questions. And hopefully occasionally it helps <br/>
someone else, lol.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YOu learn after a while what to read and what to skim and what to skip.  My kids have grown up with me on the computer (at least the younger two) and I have heard the exact comment from each of them.  :-)  What I found when they were younger (and still do to a point) is that I generally was up before them and would drink my first cup of tea and munch my toast while checking my e-mail.  My poor son used to think that he had two &quot;nursie chairs&quot;  One in the living room and one in front of the computer :-)  I would nak a lot (nurse at keyboard)!  Naptime was another time that I would get on the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on more than just unschooling lists.  I have lots of LLL Leader related lists, spirituality lists, Pampered Chef lists, Disney lists as well as un/homeschooling lists.  One of my Disney lists alone can generate over 300 messages a day (I don&#39;t read them all even though I am on the staff for that list!)<br/>
<br/>
You will find your balance.  Just give yourself time.  Perhaps your dd would agree to letting you set a timer or let you be on the computer while she watches a video.  Does she get time on the compter?  Maybe she is jealous.  Maybe if you traded time on the computer she would be more content when she sees why you want to be on the computer &quot;all the time.&quot;<br/>
