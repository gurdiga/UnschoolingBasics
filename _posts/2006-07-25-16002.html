<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957813873">&quot;Unfortunately, we have lost quite a few of our unschooling families<br/>
because they dared to MOVE AWAY or the just DON&#39;T COME anymore (you<br/>
know who you are! LOL!) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hehe....I remember ducking and running when the whole &quot;funschool&quot;<br/>
thing came up because I KNEW the families joining it just didn&#39;t get<br/>
my views at ALL!! (with the exception of a few of course:)<br/>
I figured if the unschoolers wanted to get together for sharing an<br/>
interest, that could happen without the whole organization thing.<br/>
<br/>
SO.....with that off my chest, have you checked the Live and Learn<br/>
website? Full of really cool stuff! Liveandlearnconference.org is the<br/>
place to go.<br/>
Also, check out the ReThinking Education website for more fun and<br/>
awesome ideas, and the HSC (in California) site:<br/>
