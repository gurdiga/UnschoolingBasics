Your dh is right.  Relax.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your toddler is an active bud and you probably have been<br/>
going back and forth between rooms and kids for many things in recent months<br/>
so its NOT JUST THE TV - yes?  Also - if your dd is anything like most,<br/>
she&#39;ll probably watch the video over and over and over and over again giving<br/>
you plenty of opportunity to know the story well as you move in and out of<br/>
the room.you just won&#39;t necessarily watch it start to finish.unless your<br/>
toddler naps &lt;g&gt;.  You have so many years ahead of you,trust you&#39;ll have<br/>
plenty of time to cuddle and watch shows together.  Being uptight is a lot<br/>
less fun than enjoying the process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924867314">-I asked our eye Dr about kids standing too close to the TV because my<br/>
youngest daughter who has autism used to stand in front of the tv<br/>
close enough to tap the screen as the program played... I was sure she<br/>
was going to go blind!    He said that when kids are little their eyes<br/>
are capable of focusing WAY up close (ours eyes lose that ability as<br/>
we age) so that it&#39;s more harmful for us as adults to sit too close<br/>
than for children because their eye can adjust and not be under strain<br/>
the way ours would be.    He said however he didn&#39;t recommend<br/>
encouraging that particular habit but that it wasn&#39;t necessarily going<br/>
to damage their vision.   <br/>
<br/>
I would say right now he is probably standing that close because the<br/>
tv is a novelty ... he will move on quickly most likely.  I have a<br/>
child like your little one too (he&#39;s 6 now so they do survive contrary<br/>
to what you may feel right now... ok we won&#39;t talk about his ER visit<br/>
last week...)  As long as you are present (in tune even if you aren&#39;t<br/>
in the room)  while your child is watching tv I think you will be<br/>
ok...that is assuming you are worried about her possibly viewing<br/>
something that may frighten or disturb her... you can be there in<br/>
seconds to comfort or explain.   <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the little fireball he will be big and independent before you<br/>
know it!  I wish I could say the crashing would stop!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467508218"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;letting go of the &quot;TV causes ADD&quot; thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry if this is a soap box moment and is directed not at you directly <br/>
Kendrah but to the general world as ADD is so misunderstood.:)!<br/>
<br/>
I think ADD is a fear that has been totally manufactured. ADD is an <br/>
overblown misused label used by schools et al to describe a very normal <br/>
person who probably has a visual spatial thinking and learning <br/>
style.This may or may not be coupled with hyperactivity hence ADHD. IMHO <br/>
This labeling has caused a mass hysteria that someone is broken or <br/>
defective if labeled ADD. When usually just means that they don&#39;t fit <br/>
the classic sit quietly in class do as your told school atmosphere, or a <br/>
slew of other personalty traits that are not conducive to a classroom.. <br/>
In an unschooling setting the label (as all disablilty labels)  is a non <br/>
issue as the child is in charge of how he/she learns and as the parent <br/>
you foster the individuals needs accordingly.  The so called ADD child <br/>
is not necessarily bored or hyper because he/she is engaged in something <br/>
that is fulfilling his need or desire. If they are bored and hyper you <br/>
are trying your darndest to figure out what they need not medicate or <br/>
punish. I do not believe that anything can cause ADD particularly <br/>
watching too much TV. Certainly not getting needs met in certain <br/>
atmospheres can exacerbate someone who happens to have that style of <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
So bottom line to the apprehensive TV people, please do not think that <br/>
you can make your children have ADD. My guess that most of the children <br/>
in those studies are schooled children with not a lot of present <br/>
parenting ;-) . I have spent the last two years researching and <br/>
understanding this as my son Jake (9) was &quot;labeled&quot; Dyslexic and I have <br/>
come full circle trying to help him overcome his &quot;disability&quot; and have <br/>
learned that there is NO disability. He has blossomed with self directed <br/>
organic learning and I let go more and more of my preconceived notion <br/>
that he should be doing xyz.  Jake has loved TV since he could crawl <br/>
over to it. My other ds&#39;s (ages 3 and 6) never paid it much attention <br/>
until they were about 2. Jake is visual loves documentaries and loves to <br/>
be read to and is an encyclopedia about many topics but just don&#39;t ask <br/>
him to read or write about it. DS 6 a reading fiend. In a classroom Jake <br/>
spaces off the topic at hand if it is not of interest. (Conferences: he <br/>
won&#39;t pay attention he must be add) Now he is home and free to pursue <br/>
whatever strikes his fancy. Some days this is TV and someday not. I <br/>
trust him to make his own choice.<br/>
<br/>
Being a mother of more than one child is hard and I completely empathize <br/>
with you,  always pulled in different direction. Not feeling like you <br/>
are meeting everyones needs but I have to agree with your husband, you <br/>
sound like you are doing a great job!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a myth- standing close to the tv will not harm your child <br/>
and they probably won&#39;t want to do it long anyway because it <br/>
distorts the image- Your eyesight is heriditary- you ether have the <br/>
genes or you do not.<br/>

 I&quot;m also  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; having trouble letting go of the &quot;TV causes ADD&quot; thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ADD is also genetic- the brains of children who have ADD are <br/>
different than kids who are just hyper and high energy. Only about <br/>
10% of the entire population should have true ADD. <br/>
<br/>
TV can lead to creative play as they watch the shows and get ideas- <br/>
my son would never finish a movie because he wanted to go play what <br/>
he was watching.<br/>

&gt; Kendrah:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Listen to your husband- lol-- you do not need to be right there <br/>
watching every minute with your daughter. She will understand that <br/>
you have to keep an eye on brother. Leaving kids alone with the tv <br/>
is not harmful and you have dvd&#39;s so you already know what she is <br/>
watching- invite her to tell you what she watched or ask her what <br/>
you missed. When brother is taking a nap or in bed you will have <br/>
time to sit and watch with her- and little one will get older and so <br/>
when she is watching other things you will be able to sit more.</div>

Like multi-tasking. Several people I know who were diagnosed with <br/>
ADD as kids are natural whizzes at multi-tasking. In school, multi-<br/>
tasking is generally considered &quot;not paying attention&quot;. Pbbbbttt.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, what occurred to me, thinking about this in terms of tv, is <br/>
that many unschoolers describe their kids as doing lots of other <br/>
things while also watching tv. So maybe &lt;nudge, nudge, wink, wink&gt; <br/>
having unlimited tv *does* cause &quot;ADD&quot; in that sense - it allows <br/>
kids the opportunity to become fabulous multi-taskers at an eary <br/>
age. <br/>
