Seriously. Your guess is probably darn close and, if you&#39;re wrong,  <br/>
your child will indicate that, most likely. Guessing can get you  <br/>
started communicating. You can even say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m just guessing that  <br/>
you....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recommended this book a lot, because I got a lot out of it when  <br/>
my kids were younger and I had one who was explosive, back then - and  <br/>
I think it would be great to discuss it with unschooling in mind.<br/>

with him while he sulked,but I felt very frustrated that we  were not <br/>
doing anything discussion wise. Today I can see just having somebody <br/>
sit with him was probably just the kind of empathy he needed then,but <br/>
I couldn&#39;t see that yesterday. I was too worked up and I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to sit with him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to bring it up again for discussion with him though. I have <br/>
a tendency to let it pass now that the storm is over and so things go <br/>
unresolved. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll need more help with this as we work on it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t quiz him! Make a guess -- *if* it doesn&#39;t upset him -- to put a  <br/>
label on something he might not have a word for, but you want to get  <br/>
to some form of &quot;That&#39;s no fun when that happens&quot; that speaks to him  <br/>
(*not* followed by a &quot;but&quot;) or, as you say ...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a physical way of saying it.<br/>
<br/>
Way more useful to look at his needs than what a book says are his  <br/>
needs! Books (and advice here) are great starting points when we&#39;re  <br/>
stuck, but then we need to look at what the child&#39;s telling us he  <br/>
needs not try to impose the advice on the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d like to bring it up again for discussion with him though.<br/>

<br/>
Rather than focus on him, maybe focus on what you can do better to  <br/>
help. (It&#39;s okay if he doesn&#39;t know.) He might be someone who wants  <br/>
to work things out on his own and you offering to delve into it with  <br/>
him might be irritating. You may just need to let him know you&#39;re  <br/>
there for him.<br/>
