<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074378576">Hi all.  I am Elena, adoptive mama to 8 mo. old<br/>
Xavier.  Since Xavi came home to us at 2 1/2 mo. of<br/>
age, we have been operating as a RU family with the<br/>
intention of continuing.  <br/>
<br/>
I am writing because yesterday and today, the LA Times<br/>
featured on its front page a two-part story about open<br/>
adoption.<br/>
<br/>
The story discusses (among other things):<br/>
That 41% of adopted children have seen a counselor for<br/>
emotional or behavioral problems, compared with 18% of<br/>
their non-adopted peers.<br/>
The adopted child featured in the story who struggled<br/>
for most of her childhood with anxiety about whether<br/>
or not her adoptive parents would abandon her like her<br/>
birth parents had.<br/>
How the child regularly tested her adoptive parents<br/>
with &quot;very bad behavior&quot; to test their commitment to<br/>
her.<br/>
How different the little girl felt in comparison to<br/>
her adoptive parents.<br/>
How the little girl grew up to have drug problems,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about taking all my fears and anxieties and<br/>
punching me in the stomach with them.  Our son is<br/>
likely to feel different from us as he is<br/>
African-American while I am a light-skinned hispanic<br/>
and his papa is a &quot;gringo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Xavi&#39;s birthmom and I have a lovely relationship, but<br/>
she is 15.  I am unsure as to what to expect from her<br/>
in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The story is long, but if any of you have read it--or<br/>
if any of you are interested in reading it--and<br/>
commenting on it from an unschooling perspective, I<br/>
would appreciate it.  I am also going to post this on<br/>
the &quot;Always Unschooled&quot; list as I know that there are<br/>
parents there with very young children.  I apologize<br/>
in advance to those of you who are on both lists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95164740">Quick, gut reaction - all I have time for - is that your unschooling  <br/>
approach will easily allow more communication and open understanding and mutual  <br/>
respect and value for each other as individuals and as a family unit. Your child  <br/>
will hopefully not only be able to express himself more, and his fears and his <br/>
 great feelings (and be heard by you and your DH), but also in turn, your <br/>
ability  to feel his issues and respond accordingly will be a part of the package <br/>
in your  adoption. <br/>
 <br/>
And congratulations to you and your family! <br/>
 <br/>
Love!<br/>
Karen <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656312886">Have you read Unconditional Parenting from Alfie Kohn?? It will make you understand why kids don&#39;t feel loved.<br/>
  I personally know adoptive parents who &quot;Ferberized &quot; their adopted kids when they where months old.<br/>
  I am sure things like that would make any kid fell abandonment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053065838">I have 5 adopted children. The oldest three came to us after abuse and  <br/>
neglect so their are issues there. The oldest is 14 and there is constant  battle. <br/>
She tests us constantly, we just continue to love her. I told her one  day <br/>
that no matter what she did I would still love her and there&#39;s no way she  can <br/>
make me stop loving her. Our 12 yr. old is developmentally challenged,  bipolar <br/>
and has reactional attachment disorder. It is a constant struggle with  him. <br/>
We were the 13th home he was placed in. He may never completely trust  anyone. <br/>
Our 10 yr. old we have had since she was 5 is just now starting to feel  <br/>
really safe. <br/>
 <br/>
My youngest two were adopted as infants. They are very attached to us and  <br/>
though the 8 year old knows he&#39;s adopted, he is so attached to us. He recently  <br/>
met his birth parents and didn&#39;t really want to have much to do with them. The <br/>
 youngest is 2.5 and she is a mommas girl. I have co-slept with both of them, <br/>
 practiced complete AP parenting and I do not foresee any major problems.<br/>
 <br/>
Congratulations on your adoption. Enjoy!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Elena, I read the whole article and it bugged me. It<br/>
bugged me because they took one worst-case family and<br/>
then quoted some statistics. That makes people fear<br/>
that their children are going to do drugs, whereas<br/>
most problems are probably milder.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s statistics and then there are our individual<br/>
children. Don&#39;t let the fear of statistics take away<br/>
from looking at and connecting with your child.<br/>
That statistics does not look at unschooled children.<br/>
A lot of the problems are school-related problems.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 adopted children - Supriya is 8 and Aseem is<br/>
5. I don&#39;t know much about open adoptions, except that<br/>
I know I would not be able to handle as much contact<br/>
as the family in the story seemed to have.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that we as adoptive parents have to be aware<br/>
of is that our kids are not like us. We have to modify<br/>
our expectations to fit the child. Okay, that applies<br/>
to all parents, not just adoptive parents, but it&#39;s<br/>
doubly true for adoptive parents. For example, I&#39;m a<br/>
geek. I and dh always did well in school, went to<br/>
top-rated university and onto graduate school etc. I<br/>
can sit and read for hours. My kids are very active<br/>
and not particularly interested in books. They&#39;re both<br/>
very athletic - something I&#39;m not. <br/>
<br/>
My sisters and my college friends (who are similar to<br/>
me) expect their children to excel in school. I think<br/>
if my children were in school, it would&#39;ve opened the<br/>
gates for unfavorable comparisons. The comparisons<br/>
don&#39;t even have to be explicit. I would&#39;ve struggled<br/>
more with my own expectations with grades and homework<br/>
constantly hanging in the air. Unschooling lets my<br/>
kids shine in their own way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518693594">Elena,<br/>
<br/>
We adopted my little brother when he was 4 turning 5<br/>
from Korea.  That was back in 1975.  <br/>
<br/>
He came from an orphanage, where he says he was beat,<br/>
and the rats bit him.  <br/>
<br/>
Since he became a part of our family, he hasn&#39;t seen<br/>
any councelors, or shown any bad behavior or anything.<br/>
 I know this is probably a little different from your<br/>
situation, but I thought it might help to know of<br/>
other people&#39;s stories.<br/>
<br/>
I am proud to say that he graduated high school and<br/>
college, and has been proudly serving in the Army, for<br/>
at least 17 years.  He has raised a beautiful family,<br/>
and is currently waiting to be sent abroad again.  He<br/>
has been in Afghanistan, during the war, and has come<br/>
home safe.<br/>
<br/>
I think your little boy with be just fine.  We are<br/>
white, and he is Korean.  There is a difference in<br/>
skin color only.  I think the biggest thing a child<br/>
needs is a lot of love and understanding.  There are<br/>
children out there that have had it worse than my<br/>
little brother.  He was abandoned at a train station. <br/>
So he has had to deal with the feeling of not being<br/>
wanted, but he is definately loved alot by all of us<br/>
in our family.  I hope this helps in some way.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and I hope all turns out well for you. <br/>
Sometimes just one horrible thing that has happened to<br/>
a child can scare everyone.  I think it depends on the<br/>
situation, and how the child is raised.  <br/>
