Hello  there. I&#39;m new  to the list and I&#39;m having a wee bit of trouble  <br/>
deciphering the abv. you guys use. Would someone be so kind as to list a few  of <br/>
them for me. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Was this answered? It was still in my mailbox...<br/>
 <br/>
DH---dear husband<br/>
DS---dear son<br/>
DD---dear daughter<br/>
LLL---La Leche League<br/>
AP---attachment parenting<br/>
LOL----laugh out loud<br/>
&lt;g&gt;---grinning<br/>
 <br/>
Those are the most common here, I guess. Any others you&#39;re struggling  with?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also do any of you have older children who  aren&#39;t reading or doing math <br/>
 </span></blockquote>up to what ever standard? My daughter is 10 and  isn&#39;t doing either and her <br/>
peers are. (Peers that are in public school mind  you). It doesn&#39;t bother me for <br/>
the most part but it would be nice to know I&#39;m  not alone because sometimes I <br/>
certainly feel  it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have two boys, eight and 16.They do math below AND above what&#39;s  considered <br/>
&quot;standard&quot;. Unschooling is a more &quot;organic&quot; approach to  learning. If she&#39;s <br/>
not where her peers are, it&#39;s because *she* doesn&#39;t need to  be where they are. <br/>
She&#39;s pursuing other learning. Chances are, when her peers  are floundering <br/>
in school, hating it and hating learning, THAT&#39;s when  she&#39;ll be head and <br/>
shoulders above them. At the MINIMUM, she will still  love to learn and actively <br/>
seek out questions and answers. Her peers will  be avoiding both. <br/>
 <br/>
Ten is very young. Unschooling is very different.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d relax and enjoy your daughter. She has a lifetime to learn all she  needs <br/>
to learn. Seriously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174759657">I&#39;ve been fairly quite about this because I didn&#39;t feel I had anything else to add. You guys have posted such interesting things. I&#39;m probably going to say the same things most of you have already said only different. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where most of you stand in your faith but I am a Christian. While reading my bible a while back I came across a verse that said (paraphrased by me)  &quot;knowledge alone puffs you up&quot;. Also it separates knowledge and wisdom as two separate things. <br/>
<br/>
After meditating on that I began to see unschooling in a different light for my daughter and I. As a mother I am to raise her up be a wise woman, not cram her head full of data. Wisdom comes from life experience. Making wrong choices and learning etc.. While knowledge is very important it for us, it will not be an idol. By idol I mean knowledge in that cramming facts, regurgitating data type knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
It freed me a great deal. <br/>
<br/>
Oh....I wanted to say how much this email list has encouraged me as well. I am one of the few unschoolers in my area and I get a lot of the comments where the undertones are something along the line of  &quot;this is great Cheyenne but when are you going to start school&quot;. As a single mom I am finding my insperation to keep going in what I feel is right as far as unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
So Thanks<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for sharing this, Cheyenne.  Lovely.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a thought that maybe knowledge was important for a brief time in  <br/>
human history when we didn&#39;t have a whole world of facts at our  fingertips.  <br/>
Before the information age, we had to put the information in  our head, acquire <br/>
knowlegde.  Now we are freer to think and be (acquire  wisdom) and jump on the <br/>
computer when we need a fact.<br/>

<br/>
I am also a Christian, and recently had a &quot;revelation&quot; of the same <br/>
sort, that has quieted much of my unschooling anxiety.  I was praying <br/>
for guidance; to be shown what my children need to know, and what my <br/>
role should be as they learn and grow.  It came to me that all that <br/>
is required by God is what it says in the Bible.  I am to raise my <br/>
children to know and love the Lord, to walk in His ways, and follow <br/>
His will for their lives.  It is my responsiblity to lead them down <br/>
this path and all else is secondary.  So our homeschooling <br/>
&#39;curriculum&#39; is church, spending time in the Bible, and sharing <br/>
devotions, and anything else the kids are interested in.  Our girls <br/>
(3 & 5yo) are very independant but are really open to this, and it is <br/>
proving to be quite freeing for our family.</div>

Hey Cheyenne,<br/>
<br/>
No, not me personally, but I&#39;ve been interested in this for a while as well <br/>
and have collected a few books on the subject.  I eventually want to build <br/>
something out in our woods off the Trace.  I&#39;ve just started researching what kind <br/>
would be best to do in our Louisiana climate...so I&#39;d love to talk w/you more <br/>
about this!  Are you going to the Learning Garden Park Days in Covington?  We <br/>
could talk there or you can give me a call!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Denise<br/>
