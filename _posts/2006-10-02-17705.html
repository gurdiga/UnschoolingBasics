<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460749310">We had a thread like this a few months ago and it was nice reading <br/>
about all the cool stuff our kids were interested in and what they <br/>
were doing because of those interests. Feel free to add on to this <br/>
and give us the latest on what your unschoolers have been up to. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My youngest had a birthday last month and just turned 8. She <br/>
passionate about astronomy and all things space related. She enjoys <br/>
reading and watching videos about early astronomers and the solar <br/>
system. We bought a telescope for Christmas but ended up returning <br/>
it because it just wasn&#39;t as good as we thought. We&#39;re in the market <br/>
for another one. She&#39;s looking forward to that. :-) We took a two <br/>
day trip to the Kennedy Space Center and she had a blast!! (pun <br/>
intended. lol) She got to meet an astronaut (John Blaha) and talk to <br/>
him for a while. <br/>
<br/>
I just posted about my middle daughter and how her love for horses <br/>
and led her in many directions and in the path of many people. <br/>
She&#39;s also involved with Storytelling and has joined (for the second <br/>
time) a storytelling workshop. It ends in January, with her telling <br/>
her story at the Storytelling Festival. :-) My son participated last <br/>
time also but opted out this time around. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s heavily into Yu-Gi-Oh and attends a duel every Saturday. He&#39;s <br/>
met a lot of cool kids through it and has a pretty nice collection <br/>
of cards. He even showed his younger sister how to battle. :-) <br/>
He&#39;s also VERY into auto racing and my husband & he have been to <br/>
Daytona several times. We have a local short track nearby and he <br/>
enjoys going there to watch them practice.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell us about your kids..... :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711398108">Good Idea Joanne! All the kids just spent the weekend camping with  <br/>
their dad, I was at home with Avari. They love to camp at the  <br/>
wildlife reserve, it&#39;s a totally different atmosphere than most other  <br/>
campsites, very quiet and respectful. Josh is planning two more  <br/>
campouts this month, the girls want one of their own. SO we&#39;re  <br/>
working on.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, Josh is still very much the gamer, nearly every spare  <br/>
second is spent playing video games (Tony Hawk or Animal Crossing),  <br/>
those that aren&#39;t are spent planning how to make more money to buy  <br/>
the Wii. He has saved nearly $230, so he&#39;s $20 shy of the expected  <br/>
cost at release, and he&#39;s figuring out more ways to do that. He&#39;s  <br/>
also trying to sell scout popcorn so that he has enough to pay for  <br/>
camp next summer as well as put a sizeable downpayment on the scout  <br/>
exchange to Australia which should happen when he hits 14 (min age  <br/>
for the exchange). He&#39;s finally gotten to the trumpet lessons that  <br/>
are fun, which I&#39;m thankful for because he was about to quit. He just  <br/>
built a bridge in the backyard and is now designing his own catapults  <br/>
so that the next time it rains they can have a mudball war over the  <br/>
creek. He&#39;s also training for his first overnight hike, it&#39;s a 14  <br/>
mile hike and he&#39;s the grubmaster as well, which is just insanity but  <br/>
we&#39;re trying to figure it out. He&#39;s also lately been really into  <br/>
launching his rockets, he&#39;s had them for years and just the past week  <br/>
has spent every evening out blasting one after another (and has only  <br/>
lost one!) Now he&#39;s figured out that he wants to put his name and  <br/>
number on so maybe he can make some new friends when they get lost.<br/>
<br/>
Breanna just shaved her head completely over to about an inch and  <br/>
wants it dyed green. She spends most of her time drawing pictures of  <br/>
Garfield characters and Scooby Doo, which she watches a lot. In her  <br/>
spare time she scratches out designs in our copious dirtfarm. She  <br/>
changes clothes alot and looks in the mirror, since she&#39;s nonverbal I  <br/>
think that&#39;s her way of saying that she has a closet full of nothing  <br/>
to wear. I think next week I&#39;m going to take her out to dinner and  <br/>
maybe to Hot Topic, her favorite store.<br/>
<br/>
Emily just found a halfpipe for sale and she&#39;s trying to figure out  <br/>
how she can get her paws on $350. We can afford maybe $100 to help  <br/>
her right now. I told her if she wanted we could build one, and so  <br/>
she spent most of the day she had at home, online looking for designs  <br/>
that lend themselves to affordability and ease of build. She&#39;s riding  <br/>
her bike a lot and trying to figure out how to do the tricks she saw  <br/>
on espn xtreme sports.  She&#39;s really into animal crossing as well,  <br/>
her and Rachel spend a good deal of time hanging out and trying to  <br/>
find fun &#39;stuff&#39; to do.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel is busy designing everyone&#39;s costumes for halloween, She wants  <br/>
Dan to be a squirrel so she&#39;s spending hours every day out scouring  <br/>
the neighborhood for acorns. Her and Emily have designated one house  <br/>
&quot;acorn city&quot; because they  have several oak trees and they have about  <br/>
seven gallon size ziplock bags full of them. She&#39;s riding her bike a  <br/>
lot, and has figured out how to do several tricks on her scooter. She  <br/>
loves to draw, and has books full of pictures and stories that she&#39;s  <br/>
illustrated. She&#39;s figured out how to read, and so she&#39;s reading all  <br/>
of Emily&#39;s books that are laying around.<br/>
<br/>
Sam is so amazing to me...he&#39;s a natural born story teller, and he&#39;s  <br/>
got a million of them. They all follow a very mythological bent, &quot;The  <br/>
Golden _____&quot;  He lowers his voice dramatically and softens his &quot;R&#39;s&quot;  <br/>
so that he sounds like the narrator on some of the movie&#39;s he loves.  <br/>
He&#39;s watching Jason and the Argonauts, as well as Clash of the  <br/>
Titans. He&#39;s trying to figure out what kind of training he needs to  <br/>
be a true knight. He&#39;s really trying to cook, and often I&#39;ll walk  <br/>
into the kitchen to find him mixing various ingredients together,  <br/>
always consisting of at least ketchup, a raw egg, and some vinegar.  <br/>
Sometimes rice flour, but mostly corn meal. There are some  <br/>
variations. He&#39;s figured out that making up stuff isn&#39;t working for  <br/>
him right now, so he&#39;s asking my help to follow recipe cards. I&#39;m  <br/>
hoping he&#39;ll keep his love of adventure around for cooking...his  <br/>
dad&#39;s a good cook!<br/>
<br/>
Dan&#39;s interests are pretty basic, he&#39;s very sporty, loves to throw  <br/>
and kick balls. He mostly follows Sam around and tries to get him to  <br/>
wrestle. Sam was really not into that until I mentioned that it might  <br/>
be pretty good knight training. Now he&#39;s stopping Dan, telling him to  <br/>
look at their positions and see if they&#39;re &#39;ausentic&#39;. He&#39;s loving  <br/>
helping me cook, and Sam is the head chef while Dan is his minion..I  <br/>
mean, helper.<br/>
<br/>
Avari is a rockin lil gal, she loves music and will toddle over to  <br/>
the counter and bang until we turn the radio on. She has all kinds of  <br/>
instruments, maraca&#39;s are her favorite, but pots and spoons do in a  <br/>
pinch. She&#39;s figured out how to go down the stairs, so she now has  <br/>
free reign of the house. IF she&#39;s not in the mood, she&#39;ll stand there  <br/>
and scream til someone carries her up or down. Not bad for ten months  <br/>
old. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023021355">My kids have been really into music lately.<br/>
<br/>
We found a guy who just moved here and in getting his doctorate in music. <br/>
His wife is from India and is a chef, they have twin 2 year old boys. So <br/>
anyway, he agreed to give us unstructured lessons. We bring our guitars, one <br/>
electric and one acoustic, our violin, and a few small things like a finger <br/>
piano and a whistle harmonica thing.<br/>
<br/>
He taught us some basics and lets us just do whatever while guiding us when <br/>
we ask. He also has a piano and a drum set that we have all played on.<br/>
<br/>
His wife and children have started to know us better so we have just sat <br/>
around and talked and played. It has been great. I have learned so much <br/>
about her culture and even tasted some of her wonderful meals. He is from <br/>
Oklahoma and has never been exposed to homeschooling, unschooling or the <br/>
likes. But he has started asking myself and my girls all kinds of questions. <br/>
It has been a nice barter of information! He also is planning on becoming <br/>
self employed with his music and is very interested in how my husband became <br/>
self employed by following his passion, but that is just what he wants to <br/>
do. They have different passions, but the same big picture in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081183426">I&#39;m so far behind in emails that I don&#39;t even know if this is being  <br/>
discussed anymore. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Accalia (7) has started a new session of dance at the studio where  <br/>
she&#39;s been dancing since age 4. She&#39;s so excited about learning a new  <br/>
routine for the recital next May. She is, however, a little  <br/>
disappointed that they won&#39;t be using their tap shoes. Lately she&#39;s  <br/>
also been fascinated by anything to do with Chinese culture - pandas,  <br/>
the Great Wall and architecture right now. We didn&#39;t realize the  <br/>
Harvest Moon Festival was coming up this past Thursday, otherwise we  <br/>
would prepared for that, especially making or buying the Harvest Moon  <br/>
cakes. We are planning to celebrate the Chinese New Year, though.  <br/>
She&#39;s also been playing a lot of computer games lately (goes in waves  <br/>
with that). One of her favorites is www.dressupgames.com<br/>
<br/>
Cole (4) has recently become very interested in computer games as  <br/>
well and has been playing a Putt Putt game much of the time ever  <br/>
since we picked one up at a garage sale last Friday. His favorite  <br/>
toys include his Spiderman action figures and Imaginext castle set.  <br/>
If he can do something with his hands - playing in the dirt or sand,  <br/>
playing with playdough, mixing concoctions with food and liquids,  <br/>
etc. - then he&#39;s perfectly content.<br/>
<br/>
Ella (11 months) is so close to walking and therefore spends as much  <br/>
time as possible on her two feet walking around furniture or people.  <br/>
She&#39;s also perfecting the skill of opening and closing anything -  <br/>
doors, books, cabinets, etc. She&#39;s a big fan of dancing around in the  <br/>
living room or kitchen, too, and loves to help me unload the dishwasher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593992381">I finally have a few minutes that I can think about what the kids are<br/>
doing (rather than going and doing with them :) )<br/>
<br/>
Emily is &quot;all things Japanese&quot; right now.  Language, culture,<br/>
literature, movies, books, art, origami, dress, tea, etc etc etc.<br/>
There is a row of origami cranes hanging from the kitchen threshold<br/>
and the phone is currently answered with &quot;moshi moshi&quot; (sp?)  I love<br/>
to see her strewing her own interests around in front of me!  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Mary Elayne is doing great in gymnastics.  Really loving it.  Trying<br/>
to perfect her handstand and headstand so she can go for the next<br/>
level.  She is also taking ballroom dance classes, although she is<br/>
having problems with actually dancing *with* someone.  The teachers<br/>
are great though and have let her come to the studio anytime they<br/>
dont&#39; have a class going on (individual lessons are fine) so that she<br/>
can get used to being there and perhaps she may actually dance with<br/>
the female instructor some day soon.<br/>
<br/>
Keon is mastering the new Star Wars Lego game.  It&#39;s his main focus<br/>
right now.  Although yesterday he happily spent a few hours at the<br/>
bookstore with his father (not the one I work at) which was odd as<br/>
usually he is very much the &quot;hunt it, shoot it, drag it home) kind of<br/>
shopper.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a delightful visit from one of our annual unschooling<br/>
families who rents a beach house for the month of September and had<br/>
many pleasant visits with them.  I sometimes wish they lived here.<br/>
We&#39;ve been to the beach and to the Naval Aviation Museum.  Lots of fun<br/>
at both.  We *finally* had an opporunity to walk through the hands on<br/>
display &quot;for educational purposes&quot; and while the kids couldn&#39;t do as<br/>
much as they would have liked and were bored silly by the power point<br/>
display we have great hopes that we can now have longer access to the<br/>
hands on area since we proved that our kids are not a bunch of<br/>
ruffians.  Oh, that&#39;s something else they got to do.  The kids were<br/>
able to fly in the flight simulators that the pilot students use in<br/>
flight school.  Very fun and Mary Elayne did the best landing ever!<br/>
The boys thought it was great fun to &quot;crash&quot; a mulit-million dollar<br/>
airplane, but Mary Elayne&#39;s goal was perfection.  She had to do<br/>
everything just right.  She was very serious the whole time and really<br/>
enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
OK, would love to chat some more about my wonderful kids and their<br/>
ever expanding worlds, but work calls.<br/>
