<div id="ygrps-yiv-196818793">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 4 and she just requested her own oven so that she could bake herself.  I immediately thought of an Easy Bake Oven, but I read a lot of reviews and had the idea to maybe get her a Hello Kitty toaster oven, a real kitchen appliance.  I never had an Easy Bake and think I only ever came into contact with one once as a kid, but the tiny results sounded like they might be less than what she&#39;s hoping for.  Whereby the toaster oven, may seem a bit more &quot;real&quot; and produce regular sized cupcakes, if only 4 or so at a time, if I get some individual silicon shapes or 2 small round pans, 1 rectangle, etc.  And I can prepackage cake mix for her in pretty packaging for what she wants to make. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious what kind of ideas and experiences others have had in trying to help making the desire &quot;to have a real oven&quot; at this age a reality.  And what Easy Bake Oven experiences you&#39;ve had.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Dina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789562954">My nephew had an Easy Bake oven and he loved it. He was older than four and<br/>
could make the (homemade) mixes himself and get a snack size treat. The<br/>
small size of the baked stuff is cute and I think kids like it but ask your<br/>
daughter if she realizes how small her cakes and cookies will be. If you do<br/>
get her an Easy Bake there are a lot of recipes online that are much<br/>
cheaper and don&#39;t have a bunch of chemicals in them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563849889">You can get the mixes and make them in a regular oven so she can see  <br/>
how big they are.<br/>
<br/>
(You can also make your own mixes. Just Google &quot;easy bake oven recipes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The Hello Kitty toaster oven sounds cute. And is practical since you&#39;d  <br/>
be able to use it if she decided she&#39;d rather have the oven.<br/>
<br/>
Not only can you make the mixes, you can make the oven. It&#39;s basically  <br/>
just a 100 watt bulb in a box:<br/>
<br/>
Get a cardboard box. Duct tape in a wire rack for the trays to rest  <br/>
on. (Position it a few inches above the top of the lightbulb.)  Line  <br/>
the inside of the box with foil (to reflect heat.)<br/>
<br/>
You can buy a stand-alone light socket (get one with a flat bottomed  <br/>
ceramic base) at the hardware store. You can attach an electrical cord  <br/>
and plug to plug it into the wall. (There are two screws on the base  <br/>
of the socket and you just wrap the ends of the wires around them. You  <br/>
can ask someone at the store or Google directions. It&#39;s very easy. And  <br/>
there are clip-on plugs that just clamp onto the end of the wire so  <br/>
you don&#39;t need to fuss with wrapping.)<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m sure direction for the oven are online too.)<br/>

Around here there are always brand new or little used complete sets of Easy bake ovens on goodwill for as little as a dollar.<br/>
That is how I got mine and several friends of mine did too. Worth looking around.<br/>

<br/>
More than anything else, Mo likes to cook in the microwave. You can make cakes and cupcakes in them, just not in metal pans! But nowadays you can find all sorts of silicon bakeware and that&#39;s great for the microwave. You can find mixes or recipes for all sorts of baked goods for the microwave. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here.  We got one last Christmas.  Forget Dmitri, *I* was really excited to have one again, but I found the tiny amounts not as satisfying as I anticipated.  The kids like it, but I think they&#39;re happier helping me with full-size batches of things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45140705">Google 5 Minute Mug cake - use a big ceramic coffee mug and you&#39;ve got a single serving cake in under 5 minutes (it takes 2 minutes to mix and 3 to bake, thus &quot;5 minute&quot; mug cake). Also, I think Pampered Chef used to have a recipe for making a chocolate cake in their Classic Batter Bowl (heavy glass measuring/mixing bowl) using the microwave. Currently, they have a yummy recipe for a Rocky Road Brownie Cake that uses stoneware in the microwave, nothing in the oven at all. I guess, what I&#39;m mostly thinking is that there are ways to meet baking interest without buying &quot;kid&quot; products but rather using regular kitchen implements and appliances with care (even an Easy Bake oven requires care to avoid burns KWIM?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And maybe -- as I&#39;m remembering back to my own Easy Bake Oven days --  <br/>
what she&#39;s wanting may be the ability to create it herself. (Or as  <br/>
much as she can at 4.)<br/>
<br/>
So if you do a mug cake or something small like that, you may want to  <br/>
make some mixes up with her. Something simple that she could pour into  <br/>
a mug and put into the microwave to create something real (mostly) all  <br/>
by herself. I remembering that being the big draw of the Easy Bake  <br/>
Oven. I too didn&#39;t use it more than a few times because what it made  <br/>
wasn&#39;t all that great, but I had fond memories of it because it  <br/>
allowed me to do real things not just pretend.<br/>
