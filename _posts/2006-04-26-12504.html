<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827394934">&lt;&lt;Unschooling is a philosophy that in part reveals the personal nature of<br/>
learning.  Personal, individual, natural.  What is natural for you is not<br/>
necessarily natural for your son.   Don&#39;t spend so much time looking at<br/>
the ways he&#39;s different that you fail to see that he is learning and<br/>
growing in the way that is just right for him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh....finally....something that you said that just resonated in my soul!  LOL  Seriously - thank you for all of your input.  My virgo nature (add that to me thinking I&#39;m right all the time) has a hard time with someone giving me suggestions - I admit it!  I admit it!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Traditional parenting has two answers to most questions about raising  <br/>
kids: 1) Teach them they can&#39;t and 2) Protect them from harm.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gosh - I have to figure out a way to deal with that.  I know I think that way most of the time.  Wait, maybe I don&#39;t need to figure it out.  Maybe I&#39;m thinking too much???  So how do I let go and &#39;let life&#39;?  Suggestions?   I should go back and re-read the Celestine Prophecy, the Tenth Insight, and Seat of the Soul.  Other books?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes I think we project our kids<br/>
into the future as they are now, but they will be different people in ten<br/>
years, in twenty.  They will want different things for themselves.  They<br/>
will move on from where they are today, like all of us will. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SURE I do this.  And to think: I hate it when my mother does it to me!  And she still does!!!  I&#39;m working hard to release myself from the burden of &quot;if my kids don&#39;t do/learn this now, they&#39;ll be in xyz position when they grow up.&quot;  I have no idea what their life path is.  I&#39;m *just* a guide, someone to help them navigate life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Respecting Dakari&#39;s feelings is also a way to show love. <br/>
There are other ways to be intimate and close. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, I never thought of it that way.  And today, I asked him if he wanted a hug, and he said no.  I said &#39;okay&#39;, and he came and gave me one anyway.  I guess he wants to hug me on his terms.  I have no problem with that.  His body, his decision.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s exhausting to cast ourselves in the role of Problem Solver and  <br/>
Child Protector! It removes a lot of weight to see ourselves as their  <br/>
partners.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just addressed this, but I can say that dh is still very entrenched in this phase.  He believes in shaming, punishment, authoritarianism, etc.  It&#39;s been a bit rough trying to get him to see things a bit differently.  But you guys give me hope that even if he&#39;s not as gung ho as I am about ru, that he will at least trust me and trust the process.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>
