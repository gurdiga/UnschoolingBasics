<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097894431">I just joined this group and I wanted to let you know how much it has helped <br/>
me already!  I am in my second year of unschooling and was starting to feel <br/>
like I needed some sort of curriculum (math, of course!)  After reading through <br/>
many of the messages my confidence was restored and I&#39;m comfortable <br/>
trusting my children to continue to lead the way.   Thank you!  This is just what <br/>
I needed.  Namaste&#39;  Rose</div>
