<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829624183">Just a note to warn about this GRouply site. If you have contacted<br/>
me directly before via email, this means you&#39;ll be on my Yahoo<br/>
contact list. So if you get any invite to join this Grouply thing,<br/>
seemingly coming from me lyeping2607@..., PLEASE IGNORE IT!!!<br/>
<br/>
IT DIDN&#39;T COME FROM ME!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am getting very stressed out of this whole incident. I thought <br/>
I&#39;ve posted this warning on unschoolingbasic this afternoon but I <br/>
can&#39;t see it here so I&#39;m re-posting it again. So please bear with me <br/>
if this is a double posting. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone on this list had contacted me via email, chances are <br/>
you&#39;ll be in my inbox contact list. Please ignore any Grouply invite <br/>
that turns up on your inbox presumbly sent by me under my previous <br/>
Yahoo ID <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lyeping2607@...">lyeping2607@...</a>. I didn&#39;t send this. <br/>
<br/>
I was sent an invite to join this Grouply thing s few days ago from<br/>
someone in this group, needless to say, I really thought it was a<br/>
genuine invite, but it turn out to be not, as the same must have<br/>
happened to her too. I was advised to quickly unregister from<br/>
Grouply, and change my yahoo password, which I did. And now, I<br/>
can&#39;t get back into my yahoo mail box. It doesn&#39;t recognised my new<br/>
password, nor the old one. After numerous attempt, I&#39;m totally<br/>
logged out of my yahoo account for 24 hours, twice in a row !!!!<br/>
AAArrrrrggg!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even retrive my password for yahoo seems to not recognised<br/>
my answer to the name of my pet!!!<br/>
<br/>
Very frustrating. I have to get a new yahoo account, and I&#39;ve lost<br/>
all my contact list. Yes, very very frustrating!!!<br/>

yahoo id didn&#39;t exist. Seems like something has deleted me off <br/>
yahoo&#39;s list LOL!!</div>
