<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745858372">Hi I am new to the group, but I do not think we are really new to <br/>
unschooling, just thought we did things our way, yet not totally <br/>
unschooling either....here is what we do, tell me what ya think.<br/>
<br/>
Ok our jouney started in the 3rd grade (our son, now 12.5 went to a <br/>
private school), we started schooling at night on things that he had <br/>
an interest in and they were not teaching him.  4th grade we went to <br/>
homeschooling completely, but we used a prepackaged curricula for <br/>
about the first 12 weeks and chucked it, then we went to a &quot;gentle <br/>
approach&quot; for schooling.  From 4-6 we used this, in 7th we switched <br/>
to a classical curricula, and have used that for 7tha nd 8th (we <br/>
tried the schoolbook approach and hated it).  I guess we have always <br/>
been child centered learning, if he doesn&#39;t like something we toss it <br/>
aside and move on, if he does we stick to it (even if my &quot;lesson <br/>
plans&quot; say otherwise).  Ok so now I guess I have gotten even <br/>
more &quot;relaxed&quot; as my dear husband says.  I allow our son to study <br/>
what he wants, he has read every magna he can get his hands on, he <br/>
has designed his own video games, and he is currently working on <br/>
making claymation movies.  <br/>
Now I am fine with this, feel that he is learning so well, we are <br/>
also switching to organic foods, so he has been looking up what foods <br/>
contain the most chemicals.<br/>
My husband does like to see things like spelling test and math <br/>
worksheets.  He also like to throw in a good book or two for him to <br/>
read, but does not require any reports, he says just tell dad about <br/>
it.  Right now he is to read The Hounds Of Baskerville.  <br/>
We have never tested formally in our school work, as we do not <br/>
believe in testing, yet our state does require some type of test <br/>
scores or teacher thing at the end of the year (Ohio) so we use the <br/>
CAT/Survey test through Seton Home School.  I do not time him though, <br/>
I feel that it puts stress where it is not needed (I do glance at the <br/>
time, and he is well within the time limit).  He scores very well on <br/>
these test, so I really am not worried.<br/>
<br/>
Ok now here are my questions.......<br/>
<br/>
Should we use a spelling text and vocabulary, he loves learning new <br/>
words?<br/>
<br/>
Should we use a math book, we have been studying algebra, he hates <br/>
it, we are moving on the geometry I think, just not sure what books <br/>
to pull from (he loves geometry)?<br/>
<br/>
How should we do English?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for all of your help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009814501">Those are easy questions. The answer is &quot;No, don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to, and you risk damaging his love of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Go even further in supporting his interests - think about how you can  <br/>
help him get even more in-depth into the things he is interested in  <br/>
and think about how those might connect to other things in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet - forget all about what he is &quot;learning&quot; and let it take  <br/>
care of itself because....it will take care of itself if you live a  <br/>
joyful life together.<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re stuck in the schoolish mindset.  You&#39;re still looking <br/>
at subjects and categories as something that needs to be tackled <br/>
individually and in a certain way.  Relaxed homeschooling is <br/>
definitely better than strict, forced homeschooling.  However, <br/>
relaxed homeschooling is not unschooling.  My son is 11.5 and has <br/>
sort of done the same thing as your son as we have transitioned from <br/>
relaxed homeschooling to unschooling.  There were subjects he liked <br/>
better than other subjects when we were doing schoolwork at home.  <br/>
He was happy to drop the disliked subjects but wanted to keep the <br/>
interesting subjects.  In his mind, that was his idea of his choice, <br/>
choosing what schoolish subjects to study.  I have helped him <br/>
understand that he&#39;s really free to choose to do or not do any <br/>
studies at all.  And he&#39;s not asked to do those subjects one time <br/>
since we&#39;ve been unschooling.  He&#39;s still interested in History and <br/>
Science but he does them in his own way, totally and completely.<br/>
<br/>
No, you don&#39;t *need* to do any particular subject.  <br/>
