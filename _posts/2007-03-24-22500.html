<div id="ygrps-yiv-385424901">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a member for a while and am trying to learn each day and <br/>
am on this unschooling journey. I&#39;ve been wondering what you <br/>
seasoned unschoolers would do/ do in the situation I&#39;m in right now.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest, Christian (11 1/2), caught a strep infection. It ended up <br/>
in a lymph node on the right side of his face/neck area. Tuesday, he <br/>
went to the dr, rapid test for strep came back neg/ rest ,etc etc <br/>
was the instructions. By Wed, the swelling and discomfort was much <br/>
worse so I called in and they put him on antibiotics. Thurs the <br/>
extended test finally came back and was positive. By Friday, <br/>
Christian looked like he was growing another head on the right side <br/>
so he went back to the dr. They sent him (with my husband) to the <br/>
ER. I finally got out of work and was there with him at 7.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on with the crazy experience we had but my bottom <br/>
line  question is this. How do seasoned unschoolers handle situation <br/>
like this? I thought about all of you when Christian was fretting <br/>
about getting an IV put in. Also when he had to have a CT scan (at <br/>
least it was the open kind and I stood in the room w/him) When he <br/>
was being admitted. Etc etc.. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s on the mend now, just to make sure I add that!, but it looks <br/>
like he won&#39;t be able to come home until 48 hrs worth of IV <br/>
antibiotics are administered which brings us to Mon am. He&#39;s VERY <br/>
unhappy with that but, like they said, it&#39;s important to make sure <br/>
it&#39;s totally under control before he leaves. ( I had a strep <br/>
infection in my finger about 3 yrs ago and it VERY QUICKLY got <br/>
serious and I landed in the hospital for two and a half days! Argh!)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s doing MUCH better, it isn&#39;t an abcess, like they feared, and <br/>
he&#39;s much closer to &#39;himself&#39; than he has been in DAYS so we are <br/>
very thankful BUT he had to go through many things he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to, that he didn&#39;t feel comfortable about. He did them all, though. <br/>
There was no traumatic struggle or anything like that. I listened to <br/>
him and tried to comfort him. I was with him the whole time (besides <br/>
tonight, when my husband is there b/c I&#39;ve not had much sleep in two <br/>
days with all of this and don&#39;t want to land in the hospital <br/>
myself). I stayed until I knew he was doing better and all the <br/>
results were in. I couldn&#39;t leave before that. And, for the record, <br/>
he&#39;s totally fine with my husband staying in place of me.<br/>
<br/>
So, there are procedures that one has to go through. How does a <br/>
parent respect and honor the child but still make &#39;the executive <br/>
decision&#39; for them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
