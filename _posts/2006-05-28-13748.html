<div id="ygrps-yiv-150596806">I&#39;ve used these kits before.  We had absolutely no problems and all of our caterpillars turned into beautiful monarchs. <br/>
   <br/>
  I live in Hawaii and kept mine indoors even though it was obviously hot enough to keep them outside.  I wanted them where the kids could see them all the time when they wanted- day or night. In PA, I&#39;d keep them inside for access and for warmth concerns.  Just stick them near a window for natural light source. <br/>
   <br/>
  If they&#39;re monarchs, you need crown flower leaves to feed them.  I think crown flower is the same as milkweed?  We kept our leaves in the fridge salad bin and they stayed fresh.  We kept our caterpillars in one of the big (quart?) sized mason jars with a screen screwed down with the jar collar. We cleaned it out every couple days- basically moved the caterpillars and leaves to a new mason jar and washed out the other one.  They pooh a lot ;)<br/>
   <br/>
  My ds (8) asked me to go to the local nursery and buy him a crown flower plant.  We did, and it is now taller than I am- it&#39;s about 5.5 ft tall at this point.  DS also asked to purchase some butterfly plants to attract the monarchs to the crown flower.  We bought lantana.  Now, we constantly have monarchs landing and caterpillars hatching on the crown flowers.  Ds checks the plant daily. <br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t know how well crown flower or lantana/other butterfly attractors will do in PA... whether they are perennial or annual.  Planting some to attract the butterflies might be pretty cool, though. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just did it and it was super easy!  The caterpillars come with their <br/>
own food in a container that you don&#39;t even have to open until they turn <br/>
into chrysalids.  All you do is watch them - very, very easy.  Then you <br/>
move the chrysalids to the butterfly pavilion and in a week, voila!  <br/>
butterflies.  The butterflies drink sugar water dripped on flowers until <br/>
you feel the urge to let them go.  I think as long as they are out of <br/>
the direct sunlight and the temp doesn&#39;t dip below 55, outside should be <br/>
fine.  I think I had more fun with this whole thing than my kids, but <br/>
what the hey!  I like bugs!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where do you live? We&#39;ve successfully found our own caterpillars or <br/>
chrysallises/ chrysalli (what would be the plural of that word?) and <br/>
brought them inside to &quot;hatch out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used a variety of methods from making our own butterfly pavilion <br/>
to a reused plastic container (wouldn&#39;t recommend this one) to just <br/>
leaving them loose and letting them hatch freely.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to hear more about it how we did it or where we found <br/>
them, I&#39;d be happy to talk more.<br/>
