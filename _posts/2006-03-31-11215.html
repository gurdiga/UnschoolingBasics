Dear Friends,<br/>
 <br/>
Well the campaign against Amazon is in full swing! Thanks to everyone<br/>
who wrote them last week, asking them to remove 4 baby-whipping books<br/>
from their website. Let&#39;s keep the pressure on!<br/>
 <br/>
Please call them at (800) 201-7575 within the US, or<br/>
(877) 586-3230 for Canada, or<br/>
0800 279 6629, United Kingdom.<br/>
 <br/>
Politely say &quot;Please stop selling baby-whipping books. Making money by<br/>
selling books such as &#39;To Train Up a Child&#39; by Pearl, &#39;Shepherding a<br/>
Child&#39;s Heart&#39; by Tripp, &#39;What the Bible Says About Child Training&#39; by<br/>
Fugate, and &#39;Child Training Tips&#39; by Bradley is unethical and only<br/>
encourages blatant child abuse. All 4 of these books recommend hitting<br/>
infants under 1 year of age, with sticks and whips. Following the advice<br/>
in these books has resulted in serious charges of child abuse. Until you<br/>
stop selling these child abuse manuals, I will not purchase items from<br/>
Amazon.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You can also complain about these books by writing a comment in the box<br/>
at the bottom of this page (scroll down to *Comments or Examples* ):<br/>

10?%5Fencoding=UTF8<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe someone bought it to keep it out of the hands of someone who might<br/>
just use it.  I used to have a friend who would go to the used bookstores in<br/>
town and purchase all the Babywise and GKGW and Pearl books and then shred<br/>
them and put them in her compost bin!  She said at least they were going to<br/>
some good now.  So maybe it was someone like her who bought it.  :)<br/>

read any of these books or read anything about them until this recent <br/>
incident about them.  I have read excerpts from most of them now, and <br/>
I have to say, they turn my stomach.  I will be on the lookout for <br/>
them now, too, and dispose of them properly.  <br/>
Thanks for the encouragement...I needed it.<br/>
