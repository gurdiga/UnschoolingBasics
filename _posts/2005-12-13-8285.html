<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937013894">Hello<br/>
I am new to the group and just thought I would send in a little intro. <br/>
I am new to unschooling, though have been homeschooling since my <br/>
oldest, now 8, was born. We have always been very free parents and <br/>
having the mindset of what I have come to call Attachment parenting <br/>
though we didnt know the &quot;name&quot; at the start. Our childrens names are <br/>
Tyler (8), Ashleigh(5) and Heather(3), we are also expecing baby #4 <br/>
sometime in March. This is our first &quot;real&quot; year of unschooling. We <br/>
have dipped our toes in it before but never really jumped right in. <br/>
Though my kids are a ok with everything, I am very much still <br/>
deschooling. Those that have deschooled, did you ever have, what I can <br/>
only call, Panic days? and how do you deal with them? <br/>
Also how do you deal with neighbours who don&#39;t think your kids should <br/>
be outside between the hours of 8-4 ? *rolls eyes*<br/>
<br/>
THANKS<br/>

Welcome!<br/>
 <br/>
I call it PUP, periodic unschooling panic!  I still get it and usually  over <br/>
the slightest of things  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I deal with it several ways.  I have an unschooling friend that I call  and <br/>
we have a good laugh about it.  Or I get on these lists and read  archives or <br/>
get on Joyce&#39;s list and read.  Print out some &quot;inspiration&quot; and  keep them <br/>
handy.<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps the best thing is to stop what you are doing and go sit with your  <br/>
kids.  See them through the eyes of unconditional love, not as the &quot;sole  source <br/>
of their education&quot;.  Relax and have fun.  Go someplace new or  watch a <br/>
video.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and Kelly would say &quot;go to the Live and Learn Conference next  year&quot;.  :)<br/>
