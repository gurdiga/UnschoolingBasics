<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058825739">&quot;He isn&#39;t speaking many words yet and has a limited vocabulary . He <br/>
hasn&#39;t put words togetther to make a sentence. Nancy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What is his age?<br/>
I would research exactly what that kind of therapy offers and do it myself at home....or WAIT.<br/>
The &quot;specialists&quot; often cause more harm than good, and you&#39;re opening yourself up to pressure for putting him in school. It&#39;s beyond me why anyone thinks school is a good place for children with challenges, but I&#39;ve seen parents&#39; courage shrink from that pressure and do a lot of damage.<br/>
There are so few things I would seek out an &quot;expert&quot; or therapy over.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that Einstein didn&#39;t really talk much until he was four or five? I&#39;d get the  child&#39;s hearing checked before I did anything else and then look into ways to help them at home if they really do have a challenge.<br/>
If you&#39;re child is young (2,3, 4ish) I think  wait-and-see is the best approach.<br/>
