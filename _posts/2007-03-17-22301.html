<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675483003">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I joined the list a few weeks ago (Hi Katharine!) and I&#39;ve been  <br/>
soaking it all in (as well as Rue Kream&#39;s book - wow, it&#39;s great!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Leslie, and I have 2 daughters - Tess (7) and Paige (4), and a dh  <br/>
(Tim).  We live in Central NJ.  We became interested in HSing when  <br/>
Tess was a toddler, but I found it very, very hard to make the jump  <br/>
to it.  I was terrified (of all the typical stuff new HSers are  <br/>
scared of), but intrigued.  I was especially worried about other&#39;s  <br/>
opinions of me (which I still struggle with, but years of extended  <br/>
breastfeeding, family bed, attachment parenting, and now HSing has  <br/>
helped me to get over that for the most part!).<br/>
<br/>
Tess started school at an early 5 years old (Kindergarten) at our  <br/>
local public school (one of the &quot;best&quot; school systems in NJ, and we  <br/>
moved to the town for it - LOL) and all was well for awhile (except  <br/>
for that pesky feeling that what I really wanted to do was HS!).   <br/>
About 2 months in, she melted down, and became hysterical every day.   <br/>
We were so stressed out, that we really could not see clearly, and I  <br/>
am so sad to say that we kept her going to school - thinking that she  <br/>
would &quot;turn the corner&quot; (and being told that by the teacher and  <br/>
principal over and over).  Anyway, we finally came to our senses and  <br/>
took her out of school over the winter break.  Within a few months of  <br/>
that we could see that the &quot;nervous habits&quot; (and big anxieties) that  <br/>
she had always had (since about 3 years old) were actually tics (or  <br/>
anxieties from feeling them).  They became worse and worse, and we  <br/>
realized that she has Tourette&#39;s Syndrome (TS).  It&#39;s interesting  <br/>
that we couldn&#39;t see it earlier given our backgrounds (both my  <br/>
husband and I have PhD&#39;s in biochemistry, with emphasis on  <br/>
neuroscience, and I have tics in my family (including a distant  <br/>
cousin with TS), as well as having tics myself (which I didn&#39;t  <br/>
realize were tics until we realize Tess had TS)).  It&#39;s a good  <br/>
example of how it is sometimes hard to see your own life clearly.<br/>
<br/>
For HSing, I&#39;ve been doing a mixture of structured (mostly Waldorf  <br/>
stuff) and unstructured learning.  All the time, though, I&#39;ve been  <br/>
reading about unschooling, which calls to my heart, but not being  <br/>
totally able to make what I often called a &quot;leap of faith&quot; (which I  <br/>
think less and less now).  Knowing Katharine (who&#39;s been very patient  <br/>
with me!), reading a bunch of great unschooling books, and joining  <br/>
this group have all helped me to move along in this journey.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
realized that Tess has does not have a full sense of control of her  <br/>
body and feelings (through her tics, major anxieties, etc).  Because  <br/>
of this, I&#39;ve seen her as always seeking control, which I have  <br/>
reacted to pretty negatively.  Over time, I lost a lot of my  <br/>
attachment parenting skills, and become more micromanaging, nit- <br/>
picky, etc.  I think I was trying to make her what she had been  <br/>
before the TS started.  Paige has started to show a lot of anxieties,  <br/>
and some tic-like behavior, over the past few months (similar timing  <br/>
to Tess).  This has sent me for a loop, and set my parenting back  <br/>
another notch (I would say the same for my dh).  We are starting to  <br/>
come out of it now.  What we didn&#39;t realize until very recently is  <br/>
how much we&#39;ve turned to seeking control (which is all that was  <br/>
modeled for us by both of our parents), rather than on joy.  We are  <br/>
becoming more unschool-ish as time goes on, and I&#39;m trying to focus  <br/>
on joy more and more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have lots of questions as time goes on (I do have one  <br/>
that I will post separately).  Looking forward to learning more and  <br/>
more!  I&#39;m also hoping to go to the conference in September!<br/>
