<div id="ygrps-yiv-710573265">I just witnessed my 12-YO son kick his 10-YO brother who was on the <br/>
ground.  My boys were playing the Playstation II very nicely <br/>
together.  I received a phone call and went upstairs to my bedroom to <br/>
get some information.  When I came back down within 5 minutes, my <br/>
older son was laying on top of his younger brother holding him down <br/>
in a tight grip and looking very angry.  I told him to get off his <br/>
brother and he said &quot;no&quot; and that his younger brother would attack <br/>
him.  I said that he wouldn&#39;t and neither of them should hurt each <br/>
other and repeated for him to get off of him.  He did get up and my <br/>
younger son didn&#39;t do anything--just continued lying on the ground.  <br/>
But my older son pushed on him hard as he got up and then kicked him <br/>
once he stood up before he walked away.  I said that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe he just did that and he said that his younger brother had <br/>
attacked him earlier.  My younger son replied that he attacked him <br/>
because he was saying very mean things and couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  <br/>
My younger son wants me to punish older bro for kicking him, <br/>
especially since I was standing right there and told them not to hurt <br/>
each other.  I am not sure what to do if I can&#39;t use punishment. I <br/>
posted about this earlier and it was suggested that I watch them <br/>
closer.  I have been doing this, but I can&#39;t watch them every second. <br/>
We have a 3-story house. In the past, I have punished both boys for <br/>
hitting by having them write 10 sentences or doing something nice for <br/>
other brother as retribution.  Now I try to talk to them about how <br/>
it&#39;s not okay to hurt people and that if they behave this way as <br/>
adults, they will be punished or in jail.  I don&#39;t want my older son <br/>
thinking he can get away with hurting his little brother whenever he <br/>
is annoyed.  He acts like a bully at times.  I have been poring over <br/>
books trying to find answers, but haven&#39;t found a whole lot.  Sibling <br/>
Rivalry says to give attention to the victim and ignore the <br/>
aggressor.  It also says to make a comment like &quot;hit a pillow when <br/>
your angry not your brother&quot;.  I do try to be there to intervene, but <br/>
now that my older son realizes he is not going to be punished, he is <br/>
blatantly pushing, hitting, and kicking younger brother even when I <br/>
am standing right there.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks,<br/>
Beth</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178345748">Hi Beth, <br/>
	I have three teen boys (18,16, and 14) the pre-teens are the hardest<br/>
time for boys. At the time my eldest was going thought it, I pretty<br/>
much went though it alone. Been divorced  since my eldest was five at<br/>
the time. Personally I don&#39;t call it rivalry, I call it the little<br/>
bull syndrome. I don&#39;t know if you know much about cattle, and being<br/>
raise with animals I remember watching the same behavior with the<br/>
young bulls. If you ever watch little bulls bunting their heads<br/>
together and driving the other back. This is to deter mend the <br/>
pecking order. when my eldest is beginning to get the hormones he was<br/>
angry and the tears would flow(the poor kid). He didn&#39;t realize what<br/>
is going on with himself. I would send him into his room and calm the<br/>
other boys. I had three of them and it is really hard for them all.<br/>
The younger ones didn&#39;t understand either. Then when everything was<br/>
calm i would go and talk to the eldest by himself. I would ask him<br/>
what going on and they will go though the blame game. But in time you<br/>
will get to the problem. I really got good at reading his body for<br/>
stress. In time with working with him and the others I got them to say<br/>
&quot;I need to talk to you&quot;. <br/>
	Yes I have read books on rivalry and different issue on raising<br/>
children. Then in the end I went with what felt right when working<br/>
with my boys. I never really punish the boys by making them write or<br/>
to sit in the corner till they come down. When i did try to put them<br/>
in the corner i would give them a book such as the Britannica. Then<br/>
the boys would ask me questions about things in the book and before <br/>
you knew it, i was in time out having a great time with the boys<br/>
looking at the books. All this pretty much told me, was that i wasn&#39;t<br/>
giving the boy what they needed.<br/>
	Then my second you was creeping into the age but he would take the<br/>
next step up to grabbing any thing that was handy to give a good<br/>
wallop to the boy that was bothering him. So hammers and any thing<br/>
that could do real damage was moved doing his cycle. He was a very<br/>
angry boy. When the two eldest would start hitting each other I would<br/>
step out of the way or tell them to take it out side. Either way they<br/>
would come back to earth and I would ask them if it was fun? That<br/>
would startle them. Both of them would say &quot;no&quot; and I would ask if it<br/>
&quot;was worth it?&quot; then they would shake their heads and admit that it<br/>
was stupid.<br/>
	 Third son well he is different to he turned into a hermit. He<br/>
watched what was going through with his elder brothers. He didn&#39;t give<br/>
into the emotional conflict. He was in the school system and refused<br/>
to do home work. He stayed back one year and they same crap was going<br/>
on the second year and i pulled him. This boy would skip school and go<br/>
to the local library to read <br/>
	Today I&#39;m happy to admit that most of the spats are gone maybe we<br/>
have one or two in a year. I truly I believe it is bases on<br/>
communication. I want my boys to argue with me this is how they learn<br/>
to debate and too have their own voice.  If they can hold their own<br/>
with you, they can hold their own with others. If they know that they<br/>
have a strong un-abusive way to express them selves   the fist will be<br/>
left behind.  The key is to stay calm. If you lose control of yourself<br/>
you will be losing the effect. Then again this is what worked for me.<br/>
And people always told me that I don&#39;t think like the normal person.<br/>
Re member we have our children for only a short time.  We are not<br/>
given things in our life that we can&#39;t handle.</div>

 <br/>
No, but my boys have never been punished.  I would think that in a  household <br/>
where punishments have taken place it would take time to unwind that  tape.  <br/>
I would explain that in thinking about it you can see that  punishments do not <br/>
help them in meeting their needs.  That you can see that  all the things <br/>
going on are just reactions to a feeling or problem and you want  more than <br/>
anything to help in any way you can.  Punishments may put an end  to the immediate <br/>
fighting or arguing but don&#39;t move toward problem solving and  mutual solutions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246755303">To Pam and everyone who has helped me struggle with this issue, I do <br/>
appreciate your insights.  All of the discussion on this, is helping <br/>
me to think clearer about it all.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember now quite a few years ago reading about extinction to <br/>
lessen undesired behaviors.  Basically, parents don&#39;t give any <br/>
attention to the child when he/she does an inappropriate behavior.  <br/>
They give lots of attention for desired behavior.  So when the boys <br/>
are able to talk it out and work a conflict out without violence, I <br/>
should comment on it and give attention for that.  However, I <br/>
struggle with not giving any attention when in a fight, because I <br/>
usually need to intervene to stop the violence!  I also wonder if <br/>
they would learn how to resolve conflicts if I am not guiding them <br/>
and telling them to use their words, etc.  I may give it a trial of <br/>
just trying to stay out of it and if older hurts younger sib, I give <br/>
small amount of attention to victim and not say anything to older <br/>
one.  I don&#39;t want younger sib provoking older sib subtlety to do <br/>
unwanted behaviors to get him rewards or positive attention.  I think <br/>
I will try using extinction and not give any attention to older sib <br/>
when he is in this mode and let you all know how it goes~I definitely <br/>
am going to try to not use punishment, but will be hard as I had <br/>
never heard of not using punishment ever as a parent until I joined <br/>
this list.<br/>

Thanks to all<br/>

It sounds as if you&#39;re planning to do a psychology experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than that, can you just *BE* there and stop the escalation <br/>
BEFORE it even starts? BE there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990600353">Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to sound like a psychology experiment.  I was <br/>
sort of thinking out loud and wondering about not giving so much <br/>
negative attention to older sib when he does something wrong and <br/>
focus more on when he gets something right.  It is hard to get away <br/>
from labels and I have read so many books on dealing with special <br/>
needs.  He has been diagnosed Aspergers, Tourette&#39;s, PDD-NOS, ADHD; <br/>
it makes my head spin.  Basically, he has an autistic trait of <br/>
handflapping while jumping up and down and making loud animal <br/>
noises.  The doctors don&#39;t really know what box he fits in.  He does <br/>
the handflapping alot and this particular behavior is discussed <br/>
extensively in Sensory Integration Disorder books as well.  However, <br/>
when he&#39;s not doing this behavior, he is articulate, normal eye <br/>
contact and mannerisms.  His peers don&#39;t realize anything until they <br/>
spot him in another room handflapping and jumping in a corner.  He <br/>
has gotten better control of this behavior around his peers as he&#39;s <br/>
gotten older.  But he doesn&#39;t try to control it with family members <br/>
so he does it alot at home.  Anyway, I just wanted to explain a bit <br/>
about my son.  I also try to forget the labels and figure out how <br/>
best to make him happy and not stressed (he gets stressed very <br/>
easily).  I am doing some biomedical interventions and it is time-<br/>
consuming.  I try to be there for my boys, but I can&#39;t always be <br/>
there 24/7.  The only way is if I made them follow me up and down <br/>
different levels of the house.  My bedroom is upstairs and the <br/>
basement has exercise equipment and I try to do a short work-out <br/>
because it helps me mentally.  They don&#39;t want to exercise and they <br/>
don&#39;t ever want to take a walk.  They usually just want to sit in the <br/>
living room and watch TV and there are times when I need to be on a <br/>
different level of the house.  The computer is upstairs in the office <br/>
as well.   <br/>
<br/>
But I want you to know I do appreciate your advice and I have learned <br/>
much from you.  I was wondering if I could ask you something on a <br/>
different topic.  My older son has chosen to take several classes at <br/>
the Jr. High this year.  I think the main reason was because he loves <br/>
the Ned Declassified tv show about junior high and he wanted to give <br/>
it a try.  Now he is telling me that he hates the computer class he <br/>
is taking.  He says it is boring.  I have seen the hand-outs and I <br/>
wholeheartedly agree.  He also says he can&#39;t seem to listen to the <br/>
teacher.  He told me this morning, &quot;I think it&#39;s my Asperger&#39;s mom, <br/>
because I have this block and I can&#39;t follow what he is saying&quot;.  He <br/>
struggles alot with attention and much of his energy is just focusing <br/>
on not flapping and sitting still in the desk.  There is an <br/>
Asperger&#39;s book called &quot;Pretending to be Normal&quot;, and that is the <br/>
story of Mark&#39;s life.  He wants to be &quot;normal&quot; and fit in and be <br/>
popular and even have a girlfriend.  Anyway, I digress again, sorry.  <br/>
I told him that he can choose to quit the class, but the school has <br/>
told me that he will receive an F.  He is enjoying the PE class <br/>
there.  Is it a big deal that he gets an F?  He asked me what it <br/>
means to get an F.  I think he will probably continue taking various <br/>
classes at the school, but am not sure how good it will be to be <br/>
dropping some of them and getting Fs.  I was wondering what your <br/>
thoughts were.  At this point, he says he wants to go to college and <br/>
I wonder if some Fs would affect his being able to go to the school <br/>
he wanted.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Beth  <br/>

My heart goes out to you Beth. This is such a difficult<br/>
position, and so common. It really tests our commitment to attentive, respective<br/>
guidance. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best resolution would be to really understand<br/>
what�s going on in your older son. I doubt that he �knows� himself in the sense<br/>
of being able to put it in words. Some very attentive listening to him when his<br/>
younger brother isn�t around, seeking to understand, without evaluation or<br/>
suggestion, might draw him out. Having a really good listener who accepts us<br/>
unconditionally and who we trust, can allow us to greatly clarify our thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since you are a reader, I recommend a couple of books I�ve<br/>
found very helpful:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
�How to Talk So Kids will Listen & Listen So Kids Will<br/>
Talk� by Adel Faber & Elaine Mazlish.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
�Kids Are Worth It� by Barbara Coloroso. Also, her �The<br/>
Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From preschool to high school�how parents<br/>
and teachers can help break the cycle of violence� <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These suggestions are offered in humility as I could be<br/>
missing the mark.<br/>
