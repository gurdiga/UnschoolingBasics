<div id="ygrps-yiv-345446236">I have noticed several people apologize in advance for cross posting to several groups. Is this considered bad netiquette? I belong to several groups and if I have a question, I post to most or all of them. If I get a cross post, I just read the first one and delete the rest.<br/>
 <br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

Baa-baa.  I&#39;m just a sheeple sometimes, doing what everyone else was doing.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing some don&#39;t like the duplicates, but IMO, that&#39;s the risk of<br/>
subscribing to multiple groups of similar theme.<br/>
