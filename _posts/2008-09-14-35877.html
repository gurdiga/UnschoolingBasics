<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760438979">I had a friend turn me on to using dry erase pens on my (at the time)<br/>
white car. <br/>
It worked really well and I could put whatever drawings, messages,<br/>
whatever all over my car. <br/>
The dry erase markers would hold up even in the rain, yet they wipe<br/>
off with a swipe of your hand. <br/>
REALLY fun. I think it would work on any light colored car too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180180482">That Crooked Brains site is amazing Joyce!  I could stay on it for  <br/>
the whole day.  I am discussing the possiblity of an unschooling  <br/>
friendly community in the warm weather down here with a friend I met  <br/>
on couchsurfing and maybe the Zero house that we found on Crooked  <br/>
Brains would be a great place to live in the beginning!   <br/>
