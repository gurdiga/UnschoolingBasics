<div id="ygrps-yiv-167816337">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the &quot;putting up kids&#39; bikes&quot; thread and the response yesterday that the person who puts up the bikes could be the one who gets to see the pretty shadows or the animal slithering away from the shed.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, *I* got to be the one with the payoff. <br/>
<br/>
Our ancient dog started barking at 1:30 AM. Usually, my husband gets up with her, but this time I volunteered so that he could sleep uninterrupted. <br/>
<br/>
It was a very still, silent, warm night after days of thunderstorms. While I was waiting for the dog to finish her business, I heard a screech owl calling from a nearby tree (yes, I thought of you, Meredith!). My girls were still up, so they came out to join me to listen to the owl. Then, by some uncanny coincidence, my son and husband woke up and walked outside, too. We all stood under the tree and listened to our owl calling back and forth with another screech owl doing a hunting call around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
With my husband&#39;s job, 2 tween girls, a home business, and very different personalities, we rarely get that kind of peaceful, silent, *togetherness* as a family. It was so rejuvenating!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that I *spoiled* my husband today!<br/>
