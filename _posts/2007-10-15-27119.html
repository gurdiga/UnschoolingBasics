<div id="ygrps-yiv-549333548">Regarding the screaming, hitting, kicking, spitting...<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind I&#39;ve never adopted.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s avoidable---pent-up anger and frustration <br/>
and---lordknowswhatelse---is bound to be released as soon as the child <br/>
feels &quot;safe&quot; enough to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would learn a few phrases in his cantonese dialect (and learn <br/>
them really, REALLY well---NO mistakes!) that might help him through <br/>
it. Like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m here to help.&quot; &quot;I <br/>
know how angry you must feel.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll never go back there.&quot; I&#39;m here <br/>
for you.&quot; &quot;How can I make it better?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll have to feel him out to see what comforts him the <br/>
most---hugging? alone time? massage? stroking? sitting close, but not <br/>
touching? foot rub? brow rub? holding hands?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be distrustful---I can&#39;t imagine that he would arrive <br/>
trustful of anyone or anything. But working at establishing that right <br/>
away would be *my* top priority.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt; Maybe stocking up on arnica (for the potential bruises), ear plugs <br/>
(for the potential screaming), and handy-wipes (for potential spit) <br/>
would be a good start? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck! We&#39;re pulling for you!<br/>

And some Rescue Remedy! I just saw they come in little pastilles you<br/>
can suck on. Probably tastes better than the liquid. You can slip a<br/>
few drops of the liquid into water for intense moments too...or even<br/>
just touch it to the temples.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152900331">My friend has adopted two boys from over there...similar situation.   <br/>
She hasn&#39;t had any trouble with what you&#39;ve mentioned, hitting,  <br/>
kicking, spitting...they both latched on to her pretty quickly and  <br/>
absorbed every bit of affection they could get. There was some  <br/>
&#39;testing&#39;, for lack of a better word. Eyeing her and throwing a toy  <br/>
to see her reaction, a little bit of screaming (and most of that in  <br/>
frustration because she didn&#39;t speak their language) Anyway, maybe  <br/>
just saying that you don&#39;t necessarily have to expect the anger  <br/>
issues, be prepared, but there are many people who adopt that don&#39;t  <br/>
have that problem.<br/>
<br/>
Sign language is meant to be visual, and most of the signs are very  <br/>
obvious. We&#39;ve used signing times (my friend watched it a LOT and her  <br/>
son was very proficient at signing before age one) and it is a good  <br/>
program. I think it would be wonderful to get now and start using. I  <br/>
like Kelly&#39;s idea of learning a few phrases. It seems to me that the  <br/>
tone of your voice, as well as your gentle presence, will make all  <br/>
the difference in the beginning. He&#39;ll pick up English quickly  <br/>
quickly. If attachment disorders are present, then take that one step  <br/>
at a time, because his needs will be different than other children  <br/>
with AD, and to me unschooling as about filling needs. That&#39;s why it  <br/>
is so wonderful with children who have different abilities,  <br/>
expectations, etc. It&#39;s worked wonderfully for all my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023749977">Well as for learning a few phrases, no one talks to my daughter.  She<br/>
responds to the commands given the whole group.  She has no language or so<br/>
it seems.  And addtionally, the dialect the ayis use is regional so there is<br/>
no way for me to learn that dialect.  So that&#39;s not going to help.  Were she<br/>
older she would be learning some Mandarin which I&#39;m mildly proficient at.<br/>
This is why I was thinking the signing would be good, but I&#39;ve got a friend<br/>
that works with Special Ed teachers and she&#39;s going to make me a book of<br/>
pictures for things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.<br/>

Karen, i have access to many chinese friends perhaps they can lead me to  <br/>
this dialect, you never know. but i looked up &quot;ayis&quot; and it means &quot;maid&quot; from  <br/>
what i&#39;ve seen, and i can&#39;t find reference to it being a dialect. maybe i am  <br/>
misunderstanding you. let me know, ok? if i can get some phrases for you, i&#39;d be <br/>
 very happy to do so! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717452879">ayis are the &quot;nannies&quot; that work at the SWIs they tend to be very poor<br/>
women.  Xian Yi (SHEN yee) is living in Guangdong province, Foshan City.<br/>
This is southern China hence Cantonese.  Although when I say Xian Yi I say<br/>
it in Mandarin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be very appreciative of some phrases if you could.<br/>
