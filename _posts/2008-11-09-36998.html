<div id="ygrps-yiv-955954438">I am very excited  about this year&#39;s hotel. We have more space than ever, <br/>
which will allow us to  have both an art room and a gaming room in addition to <br/>
out program space. The  hotel has a full health club with an Olympic size pool. <br/>
There are hiking trails  right nearby. We have negotiated with the hotel so <br/>
there will be free internet  access in all conference attendee rooms (normally <br/>
$10/night). It&#39;s very handy to  Boston with a  free shuttle to the commuter <br/>
rail in case you want to explore without worrying  about parking your car. <br/>
I urge you to reserve  rooms as soon as you can. We have run out of rooms at <br/>
past  conferences. <br/>
I&#39;ll have more details  about presenters and funshops and other things soon, <br/>
and I&#39;m still taking  proposals.  <br/>
