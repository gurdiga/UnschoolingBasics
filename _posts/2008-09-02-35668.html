<br/>
Lots of entries again and some really interesting perspectives on the<br/>
baggage of defining a person&#39;s learning within subject boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone can join in!! You don&#39;t have to be a member of the Radical<br/>
Unschoolers Network. If you&#39;d like to participate just read up on the<br/>
current topic and email me a link to any post you  want to share.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t have to be a new post either.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;ll join in the October topic all about unschoolers finding<br/>
their community and support networks.:)<br/>
