<div id="ygrps-yiv-525197416">Ok so I&#39;ve decided to Unschool Jio and I plan to send out the letter to <br/>
the school tommorrow. So what do I tell my son. Though he said he <br/>
wanted to be HS&#39;ed...I know he&#39;s going to say,&quot;I don&#39;t have to go to <br/>
school! Yeah!!!&quot; &quot;you mean I can play video games all day and no more <br/>
work?!&quot; So what do I say to him? I was thinking just to say something <br/>
like:&quot;I&#39;ve decided that you will learn better out of the school <br/>
environment esp. since you have not wanted to go&quot; &quot;You can learn in all <br/>
different ways such as when your cooking (he likes to cook), taking a <br/>
walk outside, going to a park or museum, etc&quot;<br/>
Does that sound appropiate? How about TV and video games? What did you <br/>
do just let them veg out til they got bored of it even if it was months <br/>
down the line? Is that what de-schooling could consist of? Alot of <br/>
questions I know LOL<br/>
I have to de-school myself....I went to school from K-12 grade and two <br/>
years of college. My mom is a teacher too. Its hard to re-train your <br/>
brain, YKWIM.<br/>
Thanx<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d just tell him you&#39;re going to take a complete school break for awhile and then do it. When you first take a child out of school it takes awhile for everyone to get used to this new way of living. There&#39;s more time together, less scheduling, altered sleep and wake times. I&#39;d let him know that you just want him to decompress for awhile. Get the school stuff far enough away to begin your new homeschooling journey fresh. Tell him it&#39;s going to look different than school and that&#39;s the whole point. Then tell him you&#39;re so happy he&#39;s home. :o)<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t bother with all of that. I&#39;d just tell him I think he needs a break. Tell him you&#39;re going to learn more about unschooling while he recuperates and then give him some breathing room. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d let him explore whatever it is that he wants to explore. If that&#39;s TV and video games, then so be it. I&#39;d watch with him if he&#39;d like it and support his interests. I&#39;d offer alternatives and then be prepared to be turned down for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
The deschooling process really is necessary or else you tend to still stay on the school treadmill, just in a different location.<br/>

I think you say &quot;let&#39;s take a break from school for awhile and do lots of  <br/>
fun stuff!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It can be stressful to some kids to all of a sudden be &quot;responsible&quot; for  <br/>
their education.<br/>
 <br/>
Deschooling can take many forms.  Yes, most kids just veg out.   They need <br/>
time to decompress, they need time to start trusting themselves....and  You!  <br/>
You were the one that sent him to school!  LOL!  Many  people here say they pick <br/>
up their own projects, you have just shown your child  the biggest <br/>
unschooling lesson.  I want to learn something so I&#39;m going to  just do it.<br/>
 <br/>
Your assignments are to let your child have fun and let the day lead  it <br/>
where it will, and you read, read, read about unschooling.  Enjoy your  child.  <br/>
 <br/>
Check back in with other questions.  It is hard to change your whole  idea <br/>
about school!<br/>
