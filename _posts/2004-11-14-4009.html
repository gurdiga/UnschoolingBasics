<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003298016">&quot;I&#39;m very interested in talking with<br/>
other moms who&#39;ve US from the start of the &quot;schooling&quot; years and<br/>
particularly anyone with kids the same ages.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were relaxed/eclectic until four years ago, so my younger <br/>
children never had the effect of schooling inflicted upon them, due <br/>
to the fact that I didn&#39;t push anything until around 8 or 9 years of <br/>
age.<br/>
My oldest guy, Trevor (almost 15) had preschool, a year of <br/>
kindergarten and a few years of a pushy Mum...poor guy. The rest of <br/>
them escaped it.<br/>
I would say Jared (11) felt the effects of my much stricter <br/>
parenting methods, but escaped the schoolish stuff...the other two, <br/>
Sierra (7) and Jalen (3) have never known anything but radical <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any specific questions about unschooling from the <br/>
beginning?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41749991">Sorry about the empty email. Don&#39;t know how I did that one. And yet some how it doesn&#39;t really suprise me that I did ;&gt;) <br/>
 <br/>
Okay what I meant to write is can anyone give me an example of some ways to log everyday activities into educationese. I saw the other post about it and thought I&#39;d like to try it for awhile. It would be nice to do that so when well meaning friends and realitives questioning what we did or didn&#39;t do is more like it, I can make the fact that my 10 yr old dd spent the entire day making up a dance &quot;sound&quot; really educational. I think it would be a confident booster to me as well. <br/>
Here&#39;s one we could try, on Tuesday a friend and I are being hair models for color and I made dd an appointment for a style then were going to hit the town as 3 hot looking women. Surely there&#39;s some creative way to put that into the lingo? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116030411">Here&#39;s another note on the Shrek issue:<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up I would watch movies over and over and over again until I had the part memorized then I would act it out in my room, no one watching of course because that would have been embarrising. Later on in life, (teen years) I joined the high school drama club and found I had a natural knack for the performing arts... dance and theatre. When I was 30 my dd and I went to Australia to study movie and documentary making for 6 months.  <br/>
<br/>
All that to say, I don&#39;t see any harm in watching the movies repeatly it may be a sign of theatical giftings or maybe it just means that they really enjoyed the movie. <br/>

what we&#39;re doing is &quot;educational&quot;.  I know it is, I see my children <br/>
learning all the time, and I don&#39;t have to get their approval.  <br/>
However, if you want to journal or make scrapbooks for your own <br/>
enjoyment . . . that&#39;s cool.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My &quot;well-meaning relatives&quot; also wouldn&#39;t get it.  I hear constantly from my mom, &quot;Your children are so smart.  They would do so well in school!&quot;  So many people see school as the only way to determine intelligence.  My mother has also said of my xh, &quot;It&#39;s too bad he never went to college.  Just think where he could be today!&quot;  Well, if he had gone to college he would still be where he is today financially.  He&#39;s checked the statistics and looked for jobs in parts of the country (and outside the country) to see where he would be and he is at the top for his field and he *likes* this field.  He&#39;s a programmer and network administrator and it&#39;s his passion.  All self-learned.  Even if he had a degree in computers or programming he still wouldn&#39;t be making much more than he is now.  However, to my mom (who has three degrees) this doesn&#39;t equate to learning.  :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016123417">Anyone remember the movie Cloak and Dagger? The little<br/>
boy (and the girl sidekick) who found some spy stuff<br/>
in a video game? <br/>
<br/>
I had a male friend who I used to act out that movie<br/>
with all the time, taking turns being the lead<br/>
character. <br/>
<br/>
Labyrinth was also another good one to act out.<br/>
