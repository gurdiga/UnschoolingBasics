My 3.5 year old was attacked by a pit bull on Monday night.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m sooo sorry! I hope she heals fast---physically and emotionally!<br/>
<br/>
  My sister-in-law, the pediatric oncology nurse, recommended this to me <br/>
when I asked about Hannah Jenner&#39;s meds being so awful:<br/>
<br/>
  Get Skittles and warm them in your hands. When they are soft enough to <br/>
flatten, then put the meds inside and wrap the flattened Skittle around <br/>
it. *Don&#39;t* do this surreptitiously! Let her know what you&#39;re doing so <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t bite down on it accidentally. But that way she can eat <br/>
a few, swallow one whole, and then chew a few more.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
