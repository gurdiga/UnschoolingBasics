<div id="ygrps-yiv-23485737">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just found out about this group today and have been reading <br/>
through some of the past posts.  We are new to the endeavor of <br/>
unschooling.  All though I have been drawn to it for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
We have two children Wheatley(7) and Veronica will be two tomorrow.  <br/>
We had been loosely following the Well trained mind and <br/>
doing &quot;school at home&quot;.  Not going very well.  I was really stressed <br/>
if we didn&#39;t start on time and about getting everything done.  <br/>
<br/>
I had been soul searching lately on things regarding DD - she has <br/>
Down syndrome and I was tired of the system.  So yesterday we <br/>
dropped all but one of her therapists from early intervention.  <br/>
Again they were all just causing me stress.  Causing me not to see <br/>
my beautiful daughter for who she is.  I also just joined the <br/>
Shinewithunschooling group.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to be having some trouble getting the whole picture of how <br/>
this done.  DS asks &quot;What are we learning about now?&quot;  He is a very <br/>
beginning reader(Bob books) and would usually choose TV over a <br/>
book.  But if I just start reading to DD he will usually join in to <br/>
listen.<br/>
<br/>
Any good tips for getting a kid like him out of the &quot;school - <br/>
teaching&quot; mindset?  He has been playing, building legos, making his <br/>
own choices, doing art projects, and the like.  I know he is <br/>
learning but I don&#39;t know how to get him interested in something.  <br/>
He has never been consumed with anything or one interest.  We are <br/>
going to check out some magazines at the library tomorrow.  He was <br/>
interested in dragons but not that much.  He rolled his eyes when I <br/>
showed him another dragon book from the library and he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to do any &quot;project&quot; type stuff with them.<br/>
<br/>
We also have the challenge of having a very delayed little one in <br/>
the house.  We also only have one vehicle.  <br/>
<br/>
That is enough for now.  Sorry for yammering on.  I would love some <br/>
ideas to get things rolling.  DH is having second thoughts about <br/>
this &quot;free schoooling&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and I look forward to sharing with you all and learning from <br/>
your experience.<br/>
<br/>

Sounds like he&#39;s doing just fine!  :)  I would suggest that it&#39;s you <br/>
and your husband who are the ones that are in need of dropping the <br/>
&quot;school - teaching mindset&quot; though.  Let me direct you over to Sandra <br/>
Dodd&#39;s web site to read two things:<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling for Parents<br/>

<br/>
Christi, you just listed a bunch of things that he&#39;s obviously <br/>
interested in doing.  :)  Legos, arts and crafts, playing, etc.  For <br/>
children, play = learning.  That&#39;s how humans are &#39;wired&#39;.   Again, <br/>
over to Sandra&#39;s site to read about playing.  :)  <br/>

<br/>
-=-He has never been consumed with anything or one interest.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This made my smile because I can&#39;t COUNT how many times I&#39;ve read <br/>
parents lamenting the *opposite* of this.  They&#39;re so worried about <br/>
their child not &quot;broadening their interests&quot; because they&#39;re so <br/>
passionate about 1 or 2 things.  Either way is just fine.  Having <br/>
passions or having a wide range of interests are equally &#39;good&#39;.  <br/>
Follow your son&#39;s lead, Christi, he&#39;s showing you his interests <br/>
already.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-=-We are going to check out some magazines at the library tomorrow.<br/>
He was interested in dragons but not that much.  He rolled his eyes<br/>
when I showed him another dragon book from the library and he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to do any &quot;project&quot; type stuff with them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither would I!  LOL  Why do you think he *should* to a project?  <br/>
You&#39;re going to shut down any love of learning he has if he&#39;s afraid <br/>
that if he seems interested in *anything* that you&#39;re going to load him <br/>
down with projects and books and magazines.  Try to just let him BE.  <br/>
Let *HIM* dictate his interests and the level of his interest.  Don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;assign&quot; reading materials or projects or reports or anything.  Let <br/>
your son guide his own path.  You just be the facilitator that gets him <br/>
from home to ____ (library, museum, nature, etc.).  Be his chauffeur <br/>
and act as if he&#39;s a welcome guest visiting your area and you let him <br/>
know about cool local things.  But let your &quot;guest&quot; decide what (if <br/>
anything) they&#39;d like to check out or do.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
-Tracy-<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;Peace *will* enter your life, but you<br/>
	need to clear a spot for her to sit down.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ASk him what he wants to learn about?  Tell him you are on spring <br/>
break and that means you don&#39;t have to &quot;learn&quot; anything.  :-)  Just <br/>
like a child that has been in school and is pulled out your children <br/>
will have to go through a period of &quot;deschooling&quot; in order <br/>
to &quot;unschool.&quot;  I highly recommend following some of the links in <br/>
the &quot;Links&quot; section at the yahoogroup and read some of the &quot;how to <br/>
deschool&quot; and &quot;what unschooling is all about&quot; articles.  <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t worry about the reading.  Trust me they get plenty of <br/>
reading time by watching television and playing video games.  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing to watch my son reading really long words that I didn&#39;t <br/>
teach him to read!  We also do lots of oral reading here, especially <br/>
on car trips. Everyone enjoys it even my oldest who is an excellent <br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see you here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480843513">Hi!~ So glad you are here. I too am fairly new to unschooling. It <br/>
does take time to let go of the schooly thoughts (I was a teacher). <br/>
The hubby thing can be challening. All change takes time...this is a <br/>
big change for your family. Just keep doing the next right thing and <br/>
your hubby will follow. Try not to worry, and always remember he to <br/>
needs to deschool. Take care and you are at the right place. <br/>
Love and Peace ~ Tracy in Sc<br/>
