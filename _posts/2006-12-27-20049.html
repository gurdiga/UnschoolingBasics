<div id="ygrps-yiv-414536057">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here.  I posted a question a couple of weeks ago, and received wonderful advice. <br/>
For the past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been scanning/reading thru the archives (I&#39;m up to <br/>
2335!).  I came across the concept of US a year ago and planned on taking that approach <br/>
with my children&#39;s education. What I wasn&#39;t familiar with is the idea of US as a way of life <br/>
rather than just an educational approach. Well, I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time on Sandra <br/>
Dodd&#39;s site and what I&#39;ve been reading has really challenged my previously held beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
I think...I have been a VERY controlling mom. I&#39;m still trying to take in and digest all that <br/>
I&#39;ve read, because I&#39;ve always felt &quot;there HAS to be a better way!&quot; and a lot of the mindful <br/>
parenting (or whatever you call it) is REALLY starting to appeal to me.  But boy, is it hard to <br/>
change! I keep telling myself that this is a journey, not a destination and that I can&#39;t expect <br/>
myself to change all at once. So, I decided to write down when I&#39;ve done a good job at <br/>
being mindful of my actions/reactions/interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday....<br/>
<br/>
I let my son wear a dirty shirt! He really, really wanted to wear a shirt his brother had worn <br/>
several days before.  I tried being calm and explaining to him it was dirty.  He wanted me <br/>
to wash it right then.  I explained that even if I put it in the washer that moment, it would <br/>
not be ready before we had to leave.  Didn&#39;t matter.  So, I gave in and said he could wear it <br/>
dirty. (This was big for me).  But that still wasn&#39;t good enough.  He wanted to wear it right <br/>
that moment and he also wanted it clean that moment. I started to get very frustrated and <br/>
was about to yell, because I felt I had been pretty patient. But then I stopped,took the shirt <br/>
to the laundry room, Fabreezed it and told him it was now clean enough to wear.  That <br/>
satisfied him.  Why didn&#39;t I just do this to begin with?  And you know what, wearing a dirty <br/>
shirt didn&#39;t hurt him or me.  Imagine that....!<br/>
<br/>
Also, my 2 yo dd was playing in the sink as I was trying to get us all ready to go. I tried to <br/>
make her leave the bathroom, tried to get her interested in other things, tried to keep in <br/>
mind all that i&#39;ve read...but to no avail.  Once again, I was getting frustrated and very <br/>
tempted to just grab her and carry her out of the bathroom, but for some reason, I just <br/>
stopped and stared at the water she was playing in.  Then I looked at her and said, &quot;Wow! <br/>
Sabrina, that looks like so much fun!&quot; She lifted her head up from the sink and gave me <br/>
this huge smile.  Her eyes lit up...her whole face lit up...and it was like, &quot;Wow! Mommy <br/>
finally got it!&quot; Less than 5 minutes later, she came out and told me she was all done.<br/>
<br/>
Today...<br/>
<br/>
My husbands gone for the evening.  The 3 kids and I ate dinner around their &quot;kid&quot; table, in <br/>
front of the TV, watching Dumbo.  This is HUGE for me, because previously I had limited <br/>
TV to roughly one, maybe two, hours per day. I grew up eating dinner in front of the tV <br/>
and I said I would NEVER do this with my kids.  But...we had a great meal, the kids had fun, <br/>
and we didn&#39;t miss Daddy quite so much that way. And as I sat there with them, I looked at <br/>
them and thought, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t trade this for anything&quot;. (Also huge for me, because I so <br/>
often crave time alone and feel such a need to get away...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought I would share this. I&#39;ve really enjoyed reading the archives and I feel like <br/>
I&#39;m learning a lot.  I have a looonng way to go, but at least I&#39;m starting to become AWARE, <br/>
and i think that&#39;s a good starting point...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all,<br/>
Tami</div>

<br/>
I enjoyed your post. Yes, it&#39;s a journey, I feel that way also. Keep <br/>
reading the older threads and Sandra&#39;s site. You should start a blog <br/>
and journal your days. :-)<br/>

Very nice post and that awareness that you&#39;re talking about can just grow  <br/>
and grow.  It&#39;s an amazing transformation and you&#39;ll see more and more of  those <br/>
smiles on your children&#39;s faces.  I was also a very controlling mom  and what <br/>
worked for me is exactly what you are doing.  I read and read and  as I began <br/>
that process of evaluating my  parenting, amazing discoveries took place in <br/>
all of our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re in for a great journey.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s really great to be ok with where you&#39;re at and still be<br/>
learning and growing at the same time.:) I know there are a lot of<br/>
things I can do better, but it&#39;s nice to not beat myself up all the<br/>
time too....being ok with not being a fabulous parent every moment has<br/>
been very freeing.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed your whole post and the &quot;aha&quot; moments. It&#39;s all about<br/>
seeing more possibilities, more options than before isn&#39;t it? Creative<br/>
approaches really assist the mindful parent in this journey. Usually<br/>
when I feel stressed I just haven&#39;t stopped to look at other options.<br/>
