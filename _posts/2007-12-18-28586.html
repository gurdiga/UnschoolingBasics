I don&#39;t know of any groups, but *I* am a divoreced Mama, and it effects the <br/>
unschooling in varying degrees. I struggle a lot with my former DH and our <br/>
daughter, who is 15. He is ultra uber seriously conventional and doesn&#39;t trust <br/>
himself or young adults (in a learning sense that is) and I&#39;m the polar opposite. <br/>
If you&#39;d like, email me if you&#39;d like, if you&#39;d like to talk more. It&#39;s been <br/>
tough, as Grace just began homeschooling (I term it that for him, and we are <br/>
actually ecclectic, as he&#39;s not ok with deschooling at this point...THAT is one <br/>
of the issues at hand, as you may have read here - I post and ask for help a <br/>
lot, lol!) and really needs to deschool, but the pressure to see her work is <br/>
fierce to say the least. So it&#39;s a daily issue and a daily struggle as a <br/>
result. <br/>
<br/>
You know what I just got out of this reply to you? *I* need a grtoup too! <br/>
lol! And yes, not to complain, but to gather more ideas and info and how to make <br/>
things smooth as possible. So, lol, if you find one and you care to, let me <br/>
know too, ok? :) <br/>

Last year&#39;s Live and Learn Conference, a single-parents group <br/>
developed. They met a few times during the conference, and they *may* <br/>
have formed an elist.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
Not all were divorced. But all were parenting solo. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If no one responds with info, I&#39;ll do some research.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243089089">Hi, first of all I&#39;m sorry last time I forgot to trim my post - I remembered as I was clicking send, oops :o).<br/>
   <br/>
  I wanted to add to what I said about unschooling encompassing everything (so I&#39;m learning!).  One thing I did this morning in support of us is to unscubscribe from all those &#39;helpful&#39; newsletters and e-stuff like BabyZone, etc.  These are things I signed up for when I was pregnant because I thought everyone did and there would be good information there.  Yes, there is sometimes good information, but it mostly doesn&#39;t support what our family is all about.  I&#39;ve struggled for a long time with what I see most other parents doing being SO different than what feels right for me.  I say me right now because dh is coming along, but is still thinking quite traditionally and he still believes there is nothing wrong with public school (argh! :o)).  I remember hearing SO much about babies not being able to soothe themselves if I didn&#39;t let them cry it out, so I even bought into that wacked out thinking and tried that (for a very short time until my common sense and my intuition<br/>
 kicked in), and it&#39;s something I will always regret doing.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d love to hear more from people whose co-parent isn&#39;t quite on the same page yet and what helped you be cohesive in unschooling.  I thought it would be a breeze because he&#39;s at work all day and we would unschool during school hours (how funny is that!), but I&#39;m quickly seeing it&#39;s so much more than that, and I really want to see the flow that is happening with the girls and I during the day continue seamlessly after dh gets home from work.<br/>
   <br/>
  As always, suggestions most welcome!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for listening :o)<br/>
  Jodi <br/>

addy. I&#39;m sure there are a lot of divorced people on that list that<br/>
could understand the unique challenges of that situation.<br/>
