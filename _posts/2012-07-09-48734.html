<div id="ygrps-yiv-874402390">Hi group I have a question for you all. My husband and I live in a semi-rural area outside a major city center-more of a bedroom community. Two of my kids are learning at home and one is in high school. I would like to move closer to the city so the kids can have more access to culture and activities that they can&#39;t find where we live. My dilemma is that my son who is in school really doesn&#39;t want to move and either does my daughter as all her friends live in the neighbourhood (all schooled). My other son would like to move closer to the city. It&#39;s quite a difficult decision to make and any alternative view points would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Joanne</div>

What sorts of things do your kids want to do in the city? Can you plan day trips and even overnights? Are there any groups of homeschoolers you can connect with so you have people to visit? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty extreme to uproot people from their community and established friendships - and cities aren&#39;t necessarily welcoming places. If your kids have a comfortable social group to move To, then they might feel better about visiting older friends in the country on weekends.<br/>
