Pam said, &quot;Don&#39;t GO to restaurants with her<br/>
anymore....Going to a restaurant with grandma might be<br/>
reserved for a time when only one child goes ....&quot;<br/>
---If one child went, the others would want to go too.<br/>
 (We don&#39;t eat out that often and they all would be so<br/>
excited to go.)  <br/>
---As far as getting together at the park where they<br/>
could be rambunctious, that sounds great, but our<br/>
family is visiting from another state (and staying<br/>
with us) and we live in Maine (brrrrr!) and lately it<br/>
is too cold for parks.  With some of my relatives we<br/>
can go ice skating together or to the YMCA playgym,<br/>
but it is those at home times when the kids get all<br/>
riled up.  We&#39;ve been having lots of home time lately.<br/>
 <br/>
--The kids ages are 2, 6 and 10.  <br/>
---I guess this is really all about me...I want to<br/>
feel like others think I am a good parent.  And I want<br/>
to model being respectful of kids and questioning<br/>
assumptions based on our culture because I believe in<br/>
doing that.  But when it looks like my way is not very<br/>
good I feel disheartened.  Did I mention that my 6yr<br/>
old is very needy ...maybe what people would call<br/>
spirited.  It is quite a challenge to meet his needs<br/>
and everyone else&#39;s.      <br/>
<br/>
Pam said, &quot;If you have them in your living room where <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866737562">The point was to give you ideas for ways you might make things work  <br/>
better, not to give you exactly how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you go back and reread your response, you might be able to  <br/>
see how you are shutting yourself off from possibilities by looking at  <br/>
why ideas won&#39;t work, rather than as jumping-off points for finding  <br/>
something that will work.<br/>
<br/>
For example (and, again, just an example, don&#39;t immediately tell us  <br/>
why this won&#39;t work), you said that spending more time outdoors won&#39;t  <br/>
work. But, instead, you might have thought, &quot;Maybe I can find a way to  <br/>
not HAVE family visits during the cold months.&quot; I&#39;ve spent time in  <br/>
Maine and know how absolutely beautiful the outdoors is - have them  <br/>
there when you CAN spend more time outside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you were hoping we could give you ideas for ways to  <br/>
change your visitors, to convince THEM to see things differently?  <br/>
Magic words that would get them to see your children the way you see  <br/>
them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077556674">Yes Pam!  That totally makes sense!  I probably need to think about <br/>
not having guests come in December or when I know my kids are having <br/>
difficult times.  (It has been SO difficult since like Halloween time <br/>
with my ds).  I guess I need to think about our family&#39;s needs and not <br/>
always saying yes, come anytime.  <br/>

Yes, I guess I would love for those magic words.  But I know that is <br/>
not possible.  Maybe that is what makes parents so special...how much <br/>
good we can see in our children and the trust that we have in them and <br/>
their processes.  Thanks.  Laurie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944040952">This is something I have struggled with, as well, and what has helped the most is making a conscious choice to *let it go.* You said,&quot; But I can&#39;t change the way people &#39;see&#39; my children&#39;s behavior,&quot; and you&#39;re right. When I start worrying about what people are thinking of me, my parenting, and my kids, I take a deep breath and remind myself that even though these people may disagree with my parenting, it doesn&#39;t make them right. I made an informed decision about how I want to parent my kids after doing a ton of research. My mother&#39;s/sister&#39;s/aunt&#39;s disapproval doesn&#39;t change that. <br/>
 <br/>
In the moment, if my kids are getting loud and rambunctious and I have disapproving relatives or friends about, I just try to engage the kids. Sometimes suggesting a game or video will work, or we&#39;ll decide to go outside so the kids can play and the adults can visit, or I&#39;ll pull out a board game the 4-year-olds like. -Meghan, mama to Ava (4), Genevieve (4), and Liam (22 months) Visit us at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.planetpawlowski.blogspot.com">http://www.planetpawlowski.blogspot.com</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411536808">Hi Laurie,<br/>
I understand how you feel. I am the kind of person that does not really care what others think but even I sometimes want to prove my way is the right way. You know what ? You cannot! You cannot change eoples mind if they are not open to it.<br/>
You have to believe, deep down , that what you are doing is right for your family.<br/>
Radical Unschooling is not about the outcome but the journey.<br/>
You really have to be in your kids side. If they are jumping around, being loud in your home and just being kids and you are trying to make them be who they are not in front of other people will just make those people feel you are not very comfortable with your kids being that way and you also must not approve or you would not be responding to them that way.<br/>
Trying too find a way to not set your kids up to failure is great ( like Pam said).<br/>
But just accept that no matter what you parents will see your kids they way THEY choose to see it. No matter what you do. Help them see the good side of being a kid . Help them see your kids liek you trully do.<br/>
IF your kids are jumping  on top of the couch and they are normally allowed to ( mine are- I have an older couch)and you say:<br/>
&quot; Kids Could you all please stop jumping on the couch&quot;  IT would seem to your parents that they are being wild even for you.<br/>
If you say:<br/>
&quot; Hey guys you are all sooo excited about Grandma and Grandpa being here. &quot; Turn to them and say;&quot; Isn&#39;t it wonderful to have such energy, joy and be healthy ! Kids are so much fun&quot;and look at your kids with pride.<br/>
That will look like a mom that is proud of her kids and comfortable about them being kids.<br/>
 <br/>
Got to go. Ds wants me. Hope I was clear.<br/>
Alex<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you can&#39;t change the way others see your children&#39;s behavior --<br/>
but you can step in and comment (politely) that your parenting<br/>
choices, and your children&#39;s behavior, is not up for discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could, when you see one of Those Relatives raise an<br/>
eyebrow or swap glances with another, step in and simply say *to the<br/>
relatives* &quot;This level of noise is okay with me. If it bothers you,<br/>
why don&#39;t we sit in the kitchen?&quot; (or whatever)  When someone<br/>
questions the way I am parenting my kids, (read: I&#39;m &quot;not doing<br/>
anything&quot; about the fact that my 4 year olds are acting like . . .<br/>
well . . . 4 year olds!), I say, quite matter-of-factly, that what<br/>
they&#39;re doing is okay with me.  Then I change the subject.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are still working on holding others&#39; perceptions of<br/>
you at arms length.  It takes practice, and patience, and as long as<br/>
you keep at it, you&#39;ll feel more and more comfortable against those<br/>
criticisms.  In the meantime, see if there is any way that some of the<br/>
suggestions people have given can be implemented.  I know that there<br/>
in MA, there are many indoor playgrounds.  Often, if we&#39;ve been cooped<br/>
up by bad weather, I let my guests know what we plan to do, and invite<br/>
them to come along.  Most people are interested to see what an indoor<br/>
playground looks like, and since adults are usually free, it&#39;s a good<br/>
option.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136853332">Alex, I was sometimes responding to the kids differently than I <br/>
would have otherwise, even sometimes with just my thoughts..perhaps <br/>
mostly with thoughts.  Responding aloud to my exuberant ds in a more <br/>
positive way might be something to embrace.  I will try to remember <br/>
that. Thanks!  Laurie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808475676">Honestly there isn&#39;t a lot you can do, except wait for your children to age. With young children, however they are parented, there are always going to be moments when their needs sweep away their good moods. And people who aren&#39;t used to being around young children will have a hard time with the noise, the activity, the seeming chaos. My step-father has a really hard time when we come to visit. He has ascribed malicious intent to Simon picking a plant to use as a sword. He felt like Simon was attacking him through his garden. I think he must have been really stressed out by us visiting. What helps is for us to get out as much as possible. When they come to visit us we try and schedule as many cool activities as we can. Go to museums or to the zoo or local botanic gardens or parks or to the movies or the beach or whatever cool local thing you can do. And if the kids aren&#39;t up to it, try and get your family out doing something without you. Get a heap of<br/>
 brochures from places and put them on the dresser in their bedroom just like in a hotel so they can decide where they&#39;d like to go. Try and be with your kids as much as possible. It is easy to get swept up in the joys of conversing with family so much that you don&#39;t sit down and build with lego or hama beads or color or whatever it is that you would normally be doing with your kiddos. See if you can come up with games that more people can play. My dad and Simon will play yu-gi-oh together whenever we are with them. My dad makes a point of buying cards for Simon, he loves that connection so. Or get videos that people will enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
You are going to have to remember that people aren&#39;t always used to a house filled with children and children&#39;s noises. I have a hard time when we go to my in-laws. Their house is so quiet and so regimented, there is a whole room that we aren&#39;t allowed to go into. I get so tense with the knowledge that we are somehow disturbing their lives, that we are making them more tense than they already are, that I end up losing my temper at some point during the visit. It isn&#39;t a good approach at all. I need to be better at relaxing into the environment, and making sure that there are fun things that we can do. As Simon and Linnaea get older they get better at engaging with their grandparents in less rambunctious ways, better able to talk with them. Depending on David&#39;s parent&#39;s mood, they quite like Simon and Linnaea. If they are feeling tense or anxious about things, they have a hard time enjoying anything. And sometimes just having guests is enough to make them<br/>
 tense and anxious. <br/>

Pam said, &quot;If you have them in your living room where <br/>
your own kids are used to doing things their way,<br/>
don&#39;t expect the kids to behave according to someone<br/>
else&#39;s expectations. That&#39;s kind of a set up for the<br/>
kids coming off looking bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-- But I can&#39;t change the way people &quot;see&quot; my<br/>
children&#39;s behavior.  I can&#39;t affect how they view<br/>
them...the kids will come off looking bad to someone<br/>
who thinks they should be quieter and have more<br/>
patience. (specifically I am speaking of my 6 yr old<br/>
ds)  &quot;I&quot; know that he will likely be able to do that<br/>
down the road and &quot;I&quot; accept him for who he is now. <br/>
But I hate how I think &quot;my parents&quot; see him and me. <br/>
Again, I guess I am concerned at how others perceive<br/>
me and my parenting choices.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367702790">You said,&quot; But I can&#39;t change the way people &#39;see&#39; my children&#39;s behavior,&quot; and you&#39;re right. When I start worrying about what people are thinking of me, my parenting, and my kids, I take a deep breath and remind myself that even though these people may disagree with my parenting, it doesn&#39;t make them right. I made an informed decision about how I want to parent my kids after doing a ton of research. My mother&#39;s/sister&#39; s/aunt&#39;s disapproval doesn&#39;t change that. <br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  What you can change is the way you see/think about your relatives&#39; behavior towards you.  You can embrace your own choices and see that your relatives don&#39;t get to tell you how to parent your kids.  Their opinion is only that, and if they can discount your opinion then you can discount theirs. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

I&#39;ve had this problem too and one of the things that helped was realizing<br/>
that I was behaving differently when there were guests (or when we were<br/>
guests) and my kids,  especially my 7yo, were getting stressed out by *my*<br/>
behavior changes.  Trying to please others and putting my own (and most<br/>
importantly my childrens&#39;) needs off just a little would cause stress for<br/>
her and she just would not be at ease.  Once I realized I was doing this I<br/>
decided to plan extra time and energy to be nice and accommodating to my<br/>
little one early on in the visit.  I planned more rather than less time for<br/>
her to go to the park and play or to snuggle with me in the bed.  Usually<br/>
these little things would be forgotten in the hubbub of  a visit but this<br/>
time I planned for her to burn off energy and have fun.  It worked so well I<br/>
can&#39;t believe it took me so long to figure it out. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also an unexpected benefit of getting her out and scheduling in her<br/>
important stuff was that her grandparents and aunts and uncles saw her going<br/>
out and doing her thing and it really helped them regard her as an<br/>
individual ifykwim instead of just noticing her when she was having a melt<br/>
down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071397630">This reminds me of something I read in a self-help book quite some<br/>
time ago.  I don&#39;t remember the title, or anything else, but what<br/>
stuck with me is a section on dealing with parents who don&#39;t seem to<br/>
trust their grown children.  One suggestion was to ask your mom/dad if<br/>
they trust you to make sound decisions, and to step them through the<br/>
logic that if they trust you to do so, then it&#39;s time to step back and<br/>
stop saying/doing things that indicate otherwise.  (And if they<br/>
respond that they *don&#39;t* trust you to do so, then what does that say<br/>
about their opinion of themselves as parents?)  Looking at my mom&#39;s<br/>
tendency to second-guess me as an indication of her insecurity instead<br/>
of a reflection of myself has helped me brush things aside more easily.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604111347">I am catching up on some list reading, and just wanted to say here <br/>
though I haven&#39;t read the entire thread yet, that this exact thing has <br/>
happened for us. My grandmother, who had a really difficult time <br/>
especially understanding my son&#39;s temperament and behavior and our <br/>
parenting when he was young, has said to me on several occasions more <br/>
recently that she thinks my husband and I are great parents, and that he <br/>
has &quot;turned out&quot; very well. (He is 14 now.) I am  impressed actually by <br/>
how well HE tolerates HER- she has the knack of asking uncomfortable <br/>
questions.<br/>
