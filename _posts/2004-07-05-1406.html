<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371536661">I wonder if we have problems relating to others who don&#39;t share our belief  <br/>
system or our life/unschooling/gentle parenting philosophies because we are  <br/>
being too judgemental.<br/>
 <br/>
If you would have seen me 5 years ago as the president of my kids PTO, what  <br/>
would you have thought?<br/>
 <br/>
People generally need to find their own way to something.  Just as we  <br/>
believe we don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot; our children and they will learn what they need  <br/>
when they need it - perhaps we need to extend that same philosophy and  <br/>
gentleness to the world.<br/>
 <br/>
I know of few circumstances where my judgemental attitude was helpful to  <br/>
anyone, and kharmacally (sp???) speaking, it wasn&#39;t good for me either.<br/>
 <br/>
Instead of saying, &quot;wow, what a loser&quot;, how about a deep breath and  a silent <br/>
wish for them to find peace for themselves and their  children?<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

But it is watching the kids, lined up and barked at and all that, which <br/>
is sad.<br/>
<br/>
And - when we are spending time around parents who really do spend so <br/>
MUCH time complaining about their kids&#39; schools - that is sad too. I <br/>
was at a restaurant with about 10 parents of other soccer kids - and <br/>
every single one of those parents complained a LOT about the teachers <br/>
at their kids&#39; schools - particularly the math teachers. On and on and <br/>
on -throughout the entire meal. They all have hired tutors for these <br/>
girls - the girls are 12 to 14 years old - the parents are panicking <br/>
because these girls were good students before, but now they have <br/>
algebra and they&#39;re getting low grades. DUH DUH DUH - they&#39;re too YOUNG <br/>
for algebra - they don&#39;t have the cognitive brain development yet. They <br/>
want to talk to me - they know I teach math (statistics) and do a lot <br/>
of math and have tutored in math, etc. But there is nothing i can say - <br/>
they&#39;re stuck in a terrible place. The ONLY option is to take the kids <br/>
out of school. If they stay there, they have to do algebra now, and <br/>
that means their girls are developing math phobias and anxieties. The <br/>
parents were talking constantly about how their daughter used to be so <br/>
good at math and now HATES it and thinks she&#39;s stupid and that even <br/>
with the tutor she can memorize how to do something, but she still <br/>
feels dumb and doesn&#39;t understand what she&#39;s doing. They are paying $30 <br/>
to $50 per hour - multiple hours per week - to force the girls to <br/>
memorize stuff in order not to get bad grades because they think <br/>
that&#39;ll ruin their college chances and so on. But what they&#39;re doing is <br/>
creating math phobia. And they know it. And they don&#39;t know what else <br/>
to DO. And I don&#39;t know what to tell them. I sympathize.<br/>
<br/>
To you, here, on this list, I say that I hope you&#39;ll not force math on <br/>
your kids - better that they learn NOTHING now than that they develop <br/>
anxieties and phobias about it. If they&#39;re comfortable with themselves, <br/>
if they know how to learn, if they have experienced learning what they <br/>
want to learn - then they can learn all of arithmetic in a few months - <br/>
everything kids are &quot;taught&quot; from kindergarten to middle school.  And <br/>
that&#39;s because they WILL have learned and understood the concepts just <br/>
as they go about their lives - putting it all together in a formal <br/>
notational way will come relatively easily, later.<br/>
<br/>
They can learn later IF they haven&#39;t developed anxieties and phobias <br/>
that make learning SO much more difficult. Forcing early learning upon <br/>
kids who are resistant is such a huge gigantic risk - some people <br/>
(claim to have) come through it unscathed (I have my doubts), but why <br/>
take such a great risk with our children?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not feeling all that judgmental about these school parents, by the <br/>
way - I was there once, too - PTA board member, etc. Heck, I was - get <br/>
this - the &quot;Parent Education&quot; writer for our PTA council- I wrote a <br/>
column once a month about how to help your kid with their homework, <br/>
build their self-esteem, and make sure your kindergartner is being <br/>
adequately prepared for college &lt;BEG&gt;. I was even our PTA&#39;s <br/>
representative to the state PTA convention. Wow. What an experience <br/>

   I was also highly involved in school.  Since my boy&#39;s were born I haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to volunteer as much time, but still managed to hold an officers<br/>
position in the PTA, volunteer and run around raising money and  gifts for<br/>
teacher appreciation day.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so surprising to me how much I&#39;ve<br/>
changed.  These people haven&#39;t changed; it&#39;s definitely me.  I think for the<br/>
better, but they don&#39;t and that on some level bothers me.  Makes me feel<br/>
isolated, like I&#39;m the only one thinking the things that I think.  Even my<br/>
close friends don&#39;t get it.  Making me think that I would be better off<br/>
finding new friends rather than rehashing the same old explanations over and<br/>
over again.  I get questions like; why do you spend so much time with your<br/>
kids? and Wouldn&#39;t sending them to preschool help them to live more<br/>
independently so that you could get out once in awhile? huh I got that one<br/>
today!<br/>
Why don&#39;t these people get that I LOVE being with my kids.  They are awesome<br/>
people that I CHOOSE to be with.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t really say or think they are losers, but I can&#39;t help but feel a<br/>
great deal of sorrow for those poor kids.  It starts out as a pang of<br/>
sadness and ends in frustration at their lack of respect for that little<br/>
individual.  Why don&#39;t people see that screaming at kids doesn&#39;t work or<br/>
spanking or belittling for that matter.  Why do they need these kids to<br/>
stand in line and conform so rigidly.  The kids didn&#39;t care one iota if my<br/>
kid went in line where he wasn&#39;t supposed to.  The only one objecting was<br/>
the mom.<br/>
   I could have tolerated her ignorance on parenting issues if she hadn&#39;t of<br/>
burdened my child with her foolish expectations.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think that there is a sticky age---like 9-14 or there-abouts----when  <br/>
unschooling kids can be VERY uncomfortable in situations like this. But by 15,  <br/>
they have SO much on the ball that their schooled friends just can&#39;t keep  up.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron, who was practically a vegetable from 12-14, suddenly burst forth  <br/>
with so much creativity and so many interests that we couldn&#39;t keep his schedule <br/>
 straight. His unfortunate friends were too busy with school and homework <br/>
that  they couldn&#39;t even share his new fun.<br/>
 <br/>
*He* found that he knew many more things than his friends----and that he  was <br/>
more &quot;at peace&quot; with himself and his family than any of his schooled  <br/>
friends. He was &quot;behind&quot; some of them in some things and &quot;ahead&quot; of others in  other <br/>
things----just like it should be.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s mature enough to understand this now---and it&#39;s POWERFUL!<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s what *I* think. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; think?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could happen. We live in a society where learning is &quot;hard&quot; and math is <br/>
the hardest kind of learning.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I think kids have to understand what we&#39;re doing - we have <br/>
to talk about unschooling and we have to tell them that we understand <br/>
&quot;how people learn&quot; better than school people do. Maybe some kids are <br/>
immune to outside pressures, etc., but I think most will need a <br/>
defensive dose of unschooling information and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
When my 13 yo daughter learned how to do long division (about 30 <br/>
minutes from start to full adeptness) - she didn&#39;t know what it was <br/>
called. When I said, &quot;Oh yeah, that is called &#39;long division,&#39;&quot; she <br/>
looked up in shock and said, &quot;But it is so cool - why do people always <br/>
say how much they hate long division?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because they were forced to learn it when they had no reason to, and <br/>
they had to take 30 hours to learn it (the amount of time California <br/>
elementary schools are supposed to spend on it).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom, how could they take 30 hours to learn it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because they broke it down into little bitty steps and only taught <br/>
those little bitty steps one at a time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Didn&#39;t that make it hard to understand what they were doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes. That&#39;s one of the reasons it took them 30 hours instead of 30 <br/>
minutes. And lots of them didn&#39;t remember it the next year, anyway, <br/>
after all that work.&quot;<br/>

Makes me  feel<br/>
isolated, like I&#39;m the only one thinking the things that I  think.  Even my<br/>
close friends don&#39;t get it.  Making me think that  I would be better off<br/>
finding new friends rather than rehashing the same  old explanations over and<br/>
over again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Jumping off from here...<br/>
 <br/>
I have the same frustration, especially now that we&#39;re meeting new people  <br/>
all the time, having just moved, and getting to know each other better.  I  am <br/>
very aware that an unschooling and respectful, gentle parenting attitude can  <br/>
come off as snobish or arrogant.  <br/>
 <br/>
I make jokes about it.  People have asked why Will is so calm when  he&#39;s <br/>
pitching in a baseball game.  He is a really good pitcher (I  don&#39;t take credit at <br/>
all, he&#39;s a natural), and when he&#39;s called in to close a  game he usually <br/>
just throws strikes and you can see that he&#39;s not feeling any  pressure at all.  <br/>
He&#39;s as &quot;cool as a cucumber&quot; so that even the umpires  notice and comment.  <br/>
He&#39;s only 10, so that impresses people in  baseball.  <br/>
 <br/>
I joke around with people who comment and who know he doesn&#39;t go to  school.  <br/>
I say, &quot;He lives the life of Riley!&quot;  What pressure could he  possibly have <br/>
if he doesn&#39;t have to get up in the morning and go to school!?  yada yada&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
But those people also see me act lovingly toward him off the field, and I  <br/>
don&#39;t lecture him about how to pitch or hit and I don&#39;t scream at him from the  <br/>
sidelines (except when he&#39;s pitching a few too many balls I might remind him <br/>
to  breath out on the throw).  I barely even mention his performance except to  <br/>
ask him if he had fun.  His father, who is the coach, doesn&#39;t lecture him  <br/>
either.  (Coaching is a different thing from lecturing, and it can be done  <br/>
respectfully, as well).<br/>
 <br/>
In the same way that I demonstrate (do) gentle parenting to other people  <br/>
with my own child, I try to demonstrate it with theirs as well.  There&#39;s a  <br/>
little boy named Kyle.  He&#39;s only about 6 or 7 and he&#39;s the younger brother  of <br/>
Will&#39;s teammate.  I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with their parents, and it&#39;s  clear <br/>
that Kyle is the &quot;bad son&quot; to them.  They joke about how difficult  and busy he <br/>
is, and I know they love him.  But it&#39;s clear to me that it&#39;s  going to become <br/>
self-fulfilling and they don&#39;t even realize it.  So, I take  every chance I <br/>
get to say positive things about him to his parents, and to tell  him how sweet <br/>
I think he is.  (He is sweet, really.  These parents  don&#39;t really have a <br/>
clue what a difficult child is.)  I try to sympathize  with them and point out <br/>
how normal Kyle is.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t get an opportunity to talk about unschooling with these public  <br/>
school parents at baseball games.  I probably wouldn&#39;t take it anyway,  because I <br/>
have to live in this small community and I can&#39;t afford to be  ostrasized for <br/>
my beliefs.  But to help allieve my frustration at not being  able to talk <br/>
about it, I can do things differently and say things differently  and offer calm <br/>
and peace and contentment in my visible parenting.  Lots of  them have already <br/>
noticed.<br/>

didn&#39;t work and can you believe that just taking a leap of faith and <br/>
trusting Mikey and not controling makes for this sweet boy <br/>
who&#39;s &quot;eating well&quot; and is nice most of the time. It may be hard to <br/>
pull him close when he&#39;s acting out or whining or whatever, but it&#39;s <br/>
working so well for us.<br/>
<br/>
And then I go play with the kids...<br/>
