<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003087898">I am very nervous about my own parents&#39; upcoming visit, and am all too aware that if  they are determined to see the negatives that&#39;s what they will see.  Still, for a short visit maybe you could plan to avoid activities that worsen the conflict and try to identify one or more activities that all can enjoy with little conflict. For example we do well with a visit to a park or a mountain trail, and poorly with a shopping trip. Just a thought... Cameron<br/>

I am very nervous as my mother-in-law is visiting this weekend. She is<br/>
of the &quot;children must mind&quot; mold and tends to think homeschooling<br/>
produces unsocialized kids with strange behaviors. She&#39;s the Deaf<br/>
grandma and we love her and her strong opinions, but I am very<br/>
nervous.  I don&#39;t have the luxury of a husband to help smooth things<br/>
over this time. Any suggestions to help the (short one-nighter) visit<br/>
go well?<br/>

Mother-in-law is visiting when her son is out of town? Yuck! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d make sure the house is clean and that all the food is *very* <br/>
kid-friendly (so you don&#39;t have to field concerns over their not <br/>
eating). Better would be to eat out somewhere where the kids would be <br/>
happy and easily pleased---*IF* they handle restaurants well. For us, <br/>
Panera is very family-friendly---casual enough for the kids (and mine <br/>
like the food), yet &quot;fancy&quot; enough for the adults (at least it&#39;s not <br/>
Chuck E Cheese! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try to stay out of the house as much as possible---like a trip to <br/>
the zoo or a museum the kids like. Something she would consider <br/>
&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I would be sure she knew you only have to &quot;school&quot; 180 days <br/>
out of the year, so this is one of the 185 you DON&#39;T have to &quot;do <br/>
school.&quot; She&#39;s *visiting* after all! It&#39;s a *vacation&quot; day! &quot;School&quot; <br/>
can be &quot;put on hold&quot; while grandma&#39;s in town.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids can make a cute card or other crafty-something for her that <br/>
would be nice. Or make breakfast in bed for her with flowers from the <br/>
garden. Muffins and cut up fruit with coffee---or an omelette.<br/>
<br/>
Do they like to put on plays or puppet shows? Grands like that kind of <br/>
thing---plus, it looks &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe set up a craft everyone can do together---grandma too.<br/>
<br/>
The busier everyone is, the better---for us, anyway. Less &quot;downtime&quot; <br/>
for serious discussions to begin. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whirlwind her in and out, and she won&#39;t have time to judge or complain. <br/>
*That* can come after she&#39;s back in her own home. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839851768">Teehee!  on the pillow.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, my own MIL was amazing and awesome, and unfortunately passed before we <br/>
started unschooling. My own parents are the scary ones, my dad is mostly okay with <br/>
unschooling, but I got the hint yesterday that he is not okay with the radical part. Mostly in <br/>
an obscure discussion about manners. &lt;shrug&gt; <br/>
<br/>
In addition to Diana&#39;s lovely mantra, I like to pull out Kelly&#39;s &quot;You raised your children, now <br/>
let me raise mine&quot;<br/>
