<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720979881">Hi am wondering if anyone has any unschooling books they would be<br/>
willing to sell? I am new to the concept and need some inspiration and<br/>
guidance!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610936933">hi Laura,<br/>
<br/>
we dont have books to sell and are in australia anyway... but i was a  <br/>
big book worm in my unschooling transition (took a lot to shift my  <br/>
slow, old brain!) � so i thought id mention a few titles for you to  <br/>
look out for � some would definitely be available via your library or  <br/>
second hand on amazon.<br/>
<br/>
if you are on a limited budget, which im guessing you are with the  <br/>
second hand angle... my personal suggestion would be to invest in two  <br/>
things:<br/>
	1. Rue Kreams book<br/>
	2. A subscription to Connections<br/>
<br/>
then number 3, if you really wanted to get a quick very basic  <br/>
overview would be Mary Griffith&#39;s book... but that is probably the  <br/>
sort of thing available in your library ... and once you get the  <br/>
concepts maybe not something you keep going back to like Rue Kreams  <br/>
book, or even Holt etc..<br/>
<br/>
anyway... heres &quot;the list&quot;, probably incomplete... plus my very  <br/>
subjective, very personal (ie. you might not agree at all) view on them.<br/>
<br/>
oh yes, ive also mentioned some mags at the bottom...<br/>

BOOKS<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Parenting A Free Child&quot; by Rue Kream.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>through questions & answers this book covers a lot and gives you a  <br/>
great sense of one families approach to radical unschooling and a  <br/>
really compassionate outlook on life and her family. This book has  <br/>
made a massive impact on many people that we know. Definitely dont  <br/>
borrow it... make sure you buy a copy. You can order a copy at  <br/>
www.freechild.info. hard to get anywhere else...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A very basic and very broad primer, not really straying overly into  <br/>
radical unschooling but great for people who are very new to the  <br/>
concepts. Might be what you are looking for as a basic introduction  <br/>
but if you hang out on this list for a month or two you will probably  <br/>
find it not as useful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i found this relatively dense and in all honesty have not finished  <br/>
it. But friends rave about it still. I guess i dont have the  <br/>
attention span of a teenager??? (its pitched at teenagers).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this was written a while ago now and the child in the book (Laurie)  <br/>
has now grown up and writes a column for Connections online magazine.  <br/>
While not everything Valerie did clicked with me i loved having a  <br/>
book written by someone whose child had &quot;come out the other end&quot; so  <br/>
to speak ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Anything by John Holt...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most unschoolers i know rave about John Holt. He is the guy that came  <br/>
up with the term &quot;unschooling&quot; (although he initially meant  <br/>
homeschooling by it) and his astute observations on how children  <br/>
learn and what was happening in schools have inspired many. I read  <br/>
this as my first intro to homeschooling years ago and really need to  <br/>
go back to it with less &quot;shit this is crazy&quot; eyes (which is what i  <br/>
had at time) ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Not Unschooling books but Authors of Note.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People also talk a lot about John Taylor Gatto � from my perspective  <br/>
he is good on critiquing school rather than presenting unschooling,  <br/>
although it sort of happens inadvertently. Then there are all the  <br/>
alternative parenting bods who are often far from unschooling  <br/>
specific but might contribute to some unschooling famiies approach to  <br/>
parenting like Alfie Kohn (unconditional parenting), Thomas Gordon  <br/>
(PET), Marshal Rosenburg (NVC), Pam Leo, Naomi Aldort etc etc...<br/>

MAGAZINES<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Connections ezine  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>
 </span></blockquote>only $10 for a year and gets sent to your inbox. Edited by Danielle  <br/>
who is pretty prolific on these lists, especially &quot;Always  <br/>
Unschooled&quot;. I think the online format gives her a certain leeway  <br/>
that the other mags dont have. Even her summary of some of the RU  <br/>
elists is worth the subscription alone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Life Learning mag <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com</a><br/>
 </span></blockquote>i like this mag. It is not particularly RU but has some interesting  <br/>
stuff around mindfulness and learning all the time. Some of the  <br/>
articles do not click with me but over all i do really like it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Live Free & Learn Free mag  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livefreelearnfree.com">http://www.livefreelearnfree.com</a><br/>
 </span></blockquote>ive heard about this but am yet to get a copy... probably get around  <br/>
to it if i didnt have kids to keep pestering me � lol!<br/>
<br/>
good luck in your exploration...<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
arun<br/>
