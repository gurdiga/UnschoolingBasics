<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574250752">I have a question..  My son tends to sometimes run around himself and<br/>
talk to himself. It looks a little like autistic behavior. He is like<br/>
that all of his life. Now mom in law blames it on  unschooling. She<br/>
says she has over 70 grandchildren and nobody of them is doing this.<br/>
She claims if he was with other kids in school he won&#39;t do it. But I<br/>
remember when he was in school he always did it sometimes.  My son<br/>
plays with friends well.  This is frustrating that my husbnd &#39;s mom is<br/>
trying to find &#39;reasons&#39; for worry and trying to influence my husband<br/>
&#39;s mind and making him afraid of homeschooling. <br/>
My husband is doubtfull and says I don&#39;t know if you can manage<br/>
homeschooling. its so hard. you have to take him to friends and places<br/>
everyday, and manage housework, and laundry.  I see it clearly that<br/>
his mom is influencing his mind too much!! And that my husband is<br/>
trying to find &#39;reasons&#39; to back off unschooling.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149638082">Hi Sara<br/>
   <br/>
  First of all, congratulations on making the decision to homeschool. I think it is the best thing you can do for your kid. <br/>
  I have a few questions for you. How long has your son been behaving this way?<br/>
  Has your husband supported you in the beginning? If yes, what was his reasoning behind that? Remind him of those original views he had.<br/>
  I know it is hard having to listen to a family member, specially a mother-in-law, who undermines your decision. Mine told me a few years ago, that once my children hit high school -age, I would not be smart enough to homeschool.<br/>
  I am a college educated woman, a ordained minister, with my own business, and speak four languages, so you can see, that statements from others are not based on  facts, or your truth, but more from the fact, that they are defending their own truth. Go with your gut feeling. Do you feel, that your son is going through a stage? Do you feel there is something wrong with him? Quiet yourself for a moment, and see to what conclusion your intuition brings you.<br/>
  If you want, you can e-mail me privately, and I can answer some of your questions in more detail. But most importantly, believe in yourself. I believe in you.<br/>
   <br/>
  Have a blessed day.<br/>

Yeah---I&#39;m a regular walkie-talkie! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have long and involved conversations with myself about all sorts of <br/>
things. I play *both* roles (sometimes three or four, depending on the <br/>
conversation! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a way for me to work out what I&#39;m thinking about. I examine things <br/>
better when I can see it in my own handwriting and when I can hear my <br/>
voice. So I write and talk a LOT! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m with my animals (and years ago when I was with my babies), <br/>
it&#39;s easy to claim that I&#39;m just talking to them. &lt;g&gt; But mostly, it&#39;s <br/>
just *me*!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask your son what he&#39;s talking about. He may (or may not) have a <br/>
direct answer for you. But it helps me to concentrate and not lose my <br/>
train of thought. Keeps the &quot;voices&quot; clear! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352054776">Your son could be on the autistic spectrum... but that<br/>
has nothing to do with homeschooling. Sometimes people<br/>
look for something to complain about when things don&#39;t<br/>
go as they wish. You MIL obviously doesn&#39;t want you to<br/>
unschool (or homeschool at all), so she&#39;s found<br/>
something to nitpick and raise a fuss about. I&#39;m sorry<br/>
to hear that it&#39;s influencing your husband.<br/>
