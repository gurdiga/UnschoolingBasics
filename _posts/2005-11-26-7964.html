<div id="ygrps-yiv-683075290">My last post reminded me of a question I have really been wanting to <br/>
ask.  As I mentioned we have two in PS.  Amie will be 16 in March <br/>
and is in 10th grade.  Andrew just turned 14 and is in 8th grade.  <br/>
Like I previously stated we are very seriously considering bringing <br/>
Amie home at Christmas break.  This will inevitably lead to the <br/>
decision of bringing Andrew home after this school year.  <br/>
<br/>
This is where my question starts.  All of Andrew&#39;s life all he has <br/>
wanted to do is graduate high school and go straight in the <br/>
military.  He wants the service to be his career.  He has no desire <br/>
to do anything else.  I&#39;ve never seen anyone SO serious about <br/>
anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, once upon a time I read that it is difficult for homeschoolers <br/>
to get into the military.  Do any of you have any experience in this <br/>
department?  Would I be doing him a disservice by removing him from <br/>
school in light of his carrer goals?  Mind you, it has always been <br/>
my dream, and that of the kids, for the three of them to all be <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice, experience or resources in this department are much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys - Tina</div>

Hi, Tina.  I know a couple of Marine recruiters and they tend to like  the <br/>
homeschoolers from what I have heard.<br/>
 <br/>
You might want to contact your local recruiter and see what they will need  <br/>
from him so you can prepare accordingly.  You might be able to find it  online. <br/>
 It might just be a GED or something, depending on the  service.  <br/>
 <br/>
I would recommend your son eventually look for the standardized test  study <br/>
guide that the military gives when one first enlists.  The higher the  score, <br/>
the more and better choices available for jobs.<br/>
 <br/>
From experience, my advise FWIW would be to get an easy college degree  and <br/>
go in as an officer.  Way, way, way, way more money and  perks.  <br/>
 <br/>
My husband just called (coincidence!) and he said if your son was  interested <br/>
in becoming an officer, you could contact a local university and  there <br/>
should be some sort of military liason or ROTC person to give you  information.  He <br/>
would probably need recommendations in addition to other  records.  Your son <br/>
could even get through earlier if he went to community  college for &quot;high <br/>
school&quot; and then finishes up a bachelor&#39;s.<br/>
 <br/>
But, no, homeschooling shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990651750">There&#39;s a homeschooling family at our church whose eldest is in the military.  He tried to get<br/>
into the USAF, and scored really high on the ASVAPs (or whatever the test acronym is) but was put<br/>
into the GED group of recruits, lessening his chance of being accepted.  (Wasn&#39;t it in the old<br/>
days if you dropped out of school you went into the military???)  He&#39;s at basic training right<br/>
now; I&#39;m not sure which branch he finally got into.<br/>
<br/>
My bil&#39;s family is a military homeschooling family.  Bil is a recruiter.  He says that<br/>
homeschoolers are being put in with the GED recruits, and it is a strike against them.  He would<br/>
like to see that changed in the next few years, because he sees homeschooled kids who do better on<br/>
the tests than the ps kids who get preferential treatment.  So right now, it is harder to enlist<br/>
as a homeschooler, but maybe that will change as the sheer number of homeschoolers increases. <br/>
Hopefully within 4 years, right?<br/>
<br/>
Anastasia<br/>
<br/>
On a side note - how do unschoolers wind up wanting to be controlled and forced to conform when<br/>
they were raised with freedom and without being coerced or pressured to be like everyone else? <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be rude - just curious.  (I can see my ds8 wanting to enter the service just for<br/>
the opportunity to experience the big weapons and machines, but I&#39;d guess he&#39;d really struggle<br/>
with the control/conformity aspect.  He doesn&#39;t even want to get his hair cut!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123077446">FYI -- each state has different legalities regarding homeschooling.  <br/>
In quite a few states, homeschoolers are actually &quot;private schools&quot;  <br/>
and they can apply to college or join the military in the same way  <br/>
any other high school graduate from a private school does.<br/>
<br/>
Tier 1 is usually for those who&#39;ve graduated from attendance-based  <br/>
local schools. This would include private schools and that includes  <br/>
homeschoolers in states like California where homeschools are LEGALLY  <br/>
private schools.<br/>
<br/>
  Tier 2 includes alternatives schools such as distance-ed, non- <br/>
attendance based enrollment, correspondence schools, etc.  <br/>
Homeschoolers usually fall in this category in states that have  <br/>
homeschool laws. Some states have private school AND homeschool  <br/>
options, like Florida, and for those wanting to join the military, it  <br/>
might be advantageous to choose the private school route.<br/>
<br/>
Tier 3 is dropouts - including those who attended high school and got  <br/>
a certificate of completion but didn&#39;t pass the high school exit exam  <br/>
and so didn&#39;t get a real diploma.<br/>
<br/>
The military recruiter will be most satisfied with paperwork that  <br/>
shows high school graduation from a public or private school that can  <br/>
put the kid into Tier 1.<br/>
<br/>
For homeschoolers, another really good option is to take 15 units of  <br/>
college work at a community college, &quot;COLLEGE&quot;&#39; distance ed, etc.  <br/>
This puts the recruit into Tier 1 status.<br/>

I think it has more to do with personality than with schooling.  Some people really thrive on structure.  My oldest dd is extremely traditional in how she does pretty much everything.  My dh works at a company that seems almost Nazi in its rules to me.  He loves it.  The rules are pretty much how he would conduct himself anyway (must wear jacket and long sleeves, must wear jacket into building, must donate so much money and volunteer so many hours)so he doesn&#39;t have much of an issue with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281755452">I guess that&#39;s why I don&#39;t relate to someone wanting to enter the military.  My personality<br/>
wouldn&#39;t tolerate it.  I tend to assume everyone is like me, but very few people share my<br/>
personality type.  I would be sooo in trouble in the service!  In my mind&#39;s eye, I still have<br/>
trouble picturing someone who was raised thinking for themselves wanting to enter into an<br/>
environment where all the thinking is done for you and everything has to be perfectly their way. <br/>
But I can also see where the need to be of service to our country or learn a skill that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be learned anywhere else could over-ride anything else that  the person didn&#39;t like about the<br/>
military.  I&#39;ve had jobs I stuck with for one certain aspect of it because I enjoyed it, e.g.<br/>
travel.  I could only do it for so long before the rest of the job got to me, but I don&#39;t regret<br/>
the experience.  So, I guess, my comment was in ignorance.  I&#39;m full of it sometimes!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279070857">I&#39;m having a little problem, that isn&#39;t stickly unschooling, but it is affecting my family, and I&#39;m hoping that some may be able to offer some insight or solutions.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have 3 boys (7, 4 and 14 months) I&#39;m 28 and I have a little brother who is 12.<br/>
   <br/>
  The issue is with my brother. He lives with my mom and stepdad and they are VERY against homeschooling, I don&#39;t even bother with trying to explain what we do anymore. My mom works in the public school system, she said so that she could spend time with my little bro, but she&#39;s so tired after work that she goes to her room and he&#39;s left to himself. He is soooo smart, he&#39;s really into computers and web design. He has won some award(or something I&#39;m not sure, my mom didn&#39;t know what it was) on Neopets for things he&#39;s done. He is learning the guitar and drums. He takes amazing photos and has won photo compitions he&#39;s entered. His dad is a jock and harps on him constantly about being on the computer and not playing sports. (He-stepdad- is a photographer and musician also but criticizes what his son does more than incouraging him.) <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve noticed that Miles(LB) has started to pull away from his dad, and our mom-more dad than mom- but I can see it comeing.<br/>
   <br/>
  I want to reach out to him, but I&#39;m not sure what or how to do it. We used to be VERY close when he was little. I was the first to hold him the day he was born and I took care of him almost every day until Jaiden(ds1) was born then I still cared for him on the weekends. We moved and as he has grown older he&#39;s pulled away from me, and everyone. <br/>
   <br/>
  I wish I could convince my mom to bring him home, but really, until this year he loved school and always did well. Things are getting harder for him. My mom will not bring him home. She see&#39;s that he is retreating, chalks it up to age, but has asked me to try to talk to him.<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m sorry if this is OT, but I love my brother and I miss seeing him smile. Any ideas? <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanx in advace :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481895148">Not all people who are in the military thrive on structure.  My <br/>
husband is in the Air Force, and he is a very analytical <br/>
freethinker.  He was in college for a few years and couldn&#39;t decide <br/>
on a path, so he decided on the military.  There have been times <br/>
when he questioned that decision, but there are certain things he <br/>
enjoys about his job as well.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was also in the Air Force.  He joined to get away from a too <br/>
controlling mother who had his whole life planned out for him, but <br/>
he ended up enjoying it.  Many people join up to get scholarships <br/>
for college or for travel opportunities.  I know that we have been a <br/>
lot of places that we never would have seen otherwise.  Also, there <br/>
are certainly jobs that are unique to the military.  Dh has a high <br/>
security clearance and has access to top secret information.  He has <br/>
always been interested in history and warfare, and he really enjoys <br/>
this part of his job.  For some people, a job like this makes the <br/>
controlling aspects of the military life tolerable.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh is very realistic about it.  He doesn&#39;t agree with a lot of <br/>
things that are happening in the world involving the military, and <br/>
he has no gung ho illusions about fighting and dying for his <br/>
country.  He chose the Air Force because he thought there would be <br/>
more interesting jobs and not as much chance of being in harm&#39;s way <br/>
as there might have been in another branch of the service.  But he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to cut his hair either - LOL!  He likes having short <br/>
hair now, but he still doesn&#39;t shave on weekends or when he is on <br/>
vacation :) <br/>

&gt; &gt; I think it has more to do with personality than with schooling.  <br/>
