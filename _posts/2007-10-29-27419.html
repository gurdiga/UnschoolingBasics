Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids? That would be an important factor in this<br/>
situation. If they&#39;re real young, maybe just some redirection would work<br/>
in the heat of the moment and then talking about it later on when the<br/>
moment has passed and everyone is calm.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are older so when they have a conflict, I help them through it<br/>
if they can&#39;t come to a solution. In the beginning when we first adopted<br/>
them they had poor problem solving skills so I was there, helping them<br/>
work things out, but they&#39;re able to do more and more of that on their<br/>
own now,  using skills they&#39;ve  learned over the last four years with<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
Also...a big realization for me was what I was modeling. I really looked<br/>
at how my husband & I handled conflict and we made some changes there<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
To expect a child to know how to work out conflict without help is<br/>
unrealistic. Even those of us who know how to do it sometimes need help.<br/>
You said that you feel like you make it worse. Maybe you could try a<br/>
different approach. Don&#39;t look at it as &quot;interfering&quot;. Look at it as<br/>
being involved and connecting with your kids. Maybe tell that what<br/>
worked for you in that situation. Maybe validate more and try to fix<br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
