outside, enjoying life (is he getting *nothing* from television?), and<br/>
relaxing.  His brain is still on a holiday after only 2 weeks.  The<br/>
*average* turnaround time for children who have been in &quot;the system&quot; is<br/>
usually 1 month for every year of school they were in.  That means if your<br/>
child was in school for 3 years it would be a minimum of 3 *months* before<br/>
he feels safe enough to start venturing into some of his own ideas.  For<br/>
some children it is quicker as they are excited about being able to pursue<br/>
their own interests.  For others it is longer as it takes time to get the<br/>
school mentality out of their system.  And he is pursuing his own<br/>
interests.  It will build.  Give him time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278533867">Sounds like he&#39;s deschooling -- perfectly natural and to be expected when you first bring a child home from school.  A general guideline I&#39;ve seen is to allow one month of deschooling for every year spent in school.  Your son was in the 4th or 5th grade, so at least 5 or 6 months of time for him.  And how long were you in school?  Probably the usual 12 to 16, right?  So allow a year or more for yourself to get the hang of this whole unschooling life.<br/>
   <br/>
  For today -- and the rest of your days?  Breathe.  Read all you can here an at the favorite unschooling websites -- there are a bunch of links at this group&#39;s homepage.  Read at Sandra&#39;s site, and Joyce&#39;s, and Ren&#39;s and Danielle&#39;s.  See if you can get a copy of Rue&#39;s book, or Sandra&#39;s book.  Stay up late. Sleep late. Make a big, fun breakfast together. Watch your son ride his bike or play basketball.  Just for fun -- not to see if he&#39;s improved, or if he&#39;s &#39;had enough&#39; fun.  Go to the zoo, or the park, or anywhere he wants to go.  Learn to play his favorite video game with him. Read. Be silly.  Explore the real world around you.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Read about and consider attending the upcoming Live & Learn conference in Albuquerque. We&#39;ll be there (we live in Abq) with our 10 year old son this September.  It&#39;s at www.liveandlearnconference.org. Or find your way to the L&L conf yahoo group.  There&#39;s probably a link for that at the homepage, too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is doing exactly what he needs to be doing. He&#39;s &#39;detoxing&#39; from <br/>
school also sometimes called &#39;deschooling&#39; - and you need to as well <br/>
(after all, you were in school longer than he was). <br/>
<br/>
Imagine you were kept in a cage all day every day for years. One <br/>
day, someone opened your cage and let you out. Wouldn&#39;t you run as <br/>
fast and far as you could, and jump and twirl and smell the flowers <br/>
and watch the clouds and all those things that you couldn&#39;t do (or <br/>
had very limited access to) all those years? And, too, wouldn&#39;t you <br/>
avoid ANYTHING that looked like the things from the cage, even if <br/>
some of it might be fun-looking? You&#39;d suspect it was bait to trap <br/>
you again most likely. That&#39;s precisely what he&#39;s doing. He *is* <br/>
exploring things - dirt bike, baseball, basketball, playstation, TV. <br/>
What you were expecting was not exploring but rather &#39;exploring <br/>
things in ways that look like school&#39;. That may never happen. If you <br/>
keep looking for him to suddenly decide to do things that look like <br/>
school, you may end up getting really disappointed and nervous. So <br/>
stop looking for things that look like school. Start, instead, <br/>
looking for stuff that looks like fun. Watch TV together, get out <br/>
there and see if ole Mom can still hit a free throw, find some cool <br/>
dirt bike magazines to leave in the bathroom magazine rack for him. <br/>
And, to some extent, start doing things -you- want to do (balance <br/>
spending time with him with doing your own stuff). If you are <br/>
picking up a hobby that&#39;s been sitting neglected or finding one <br/>
you&#39;ve always wanted to do, you&#39;ll have less sitting and looking and <br/>
more living going on. If it helps, consider this an extended <br/>
vacation time. Do you expect him to pick up projects and such on <br/>
weekends and holidays? Become a student of your son and look for <br/>
ways to help him do what -he- is choosing to do - whether it&#39;s <br/>
driving him to the videogame store or getting tickets to a motocross <br/>
event or setting reminder timers/VCR record timers for his favorite <br/>
programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663501782">I&#39;d say it&#39;s too soon. We pulled our kids out last May, and they are  <br/>
still recovering ;-) Of course, the little ones were really involved  <br/>
in school since they were born, because Emily was 20 months and  <br/>
Rachel was 6months  when Josh and Bre started school. We were up  <br/>
there every day, all day sometimes. So even the younger ones had to  <br/>
adjust to not having this big idea of school in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Some days are really full of crafts and projects, but many of them  <br/>
are TV, video games and laying around in the dirt. Still helpful,  <br/>
still good for the soul. Kids need to move alot to learn anyway, and  <br/>
that is probably how your son learns!<br/>
<br/>
Some kids just take longer anyway, depending on their personality. I  <br/>
found in my own family, that the kids who did &#39;better&#39; in school (ie  <br/>
more compliant and better grades) had more trouble adjusting to the  <br/>
real world. Josh in particular would just ask me to assign work so he  <br/>
could feel good about accomplishing something. But Breanna and Rachel  <br/>
(both more independent thinkers, want to do their own things)  <br/>
recovered faster and started back on their own stuff. Josh and Emily  <br/>
are different, not sure how to put it.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is go to Borders or Barnes and Noble, sometimes Toys R Us  <br/>
and hobby lobby, they have a bunch of fun kits on clearance, we have  <br/>
places all over the house where we store craft stuff and the kits,  <br/>
and they just do it whenever they want. And I do my fun stuff too, so  <br/>
that they can see me doing stuff I like. modeling clay, decoupage,  <br/>
paper mache. I started a bunch of projects and they take over. Gotta  <br/>
go, itchy kids!<br/>

I keep meaning to get input on this and don&#39;t respond.  We have been  at home <br/>
for a yr and half.  My almost 7 yr old did a yr of preschool in a  play to <br/>
learn environment and 2 months in PS kindergarten.  He De schooled  very quickly <br/>
and its just soaking up everything and loves unschooling and all it  entails. <br/>
 My 8 and half yr old daughter on the other hand started in  preschool at age <br/>
3 in the same preschool as my son (which is run in the PS) but  received <br/>
speech physical therapy and ot.  Hindsight is of course 20/20 I  know and sick at <br/>
thinking I sent this amazing 3 yr old to school FULL TIME prek  here starts at <br/>
3 if you qualify and is mon-fri from 9-3 school bus  included.  She then did <br/>
full year of kindergarten and half a yr of 1st  grade.  Upon pulling her she <br/>
was getting migraines and vomiting every day  before school.  That being said  <br/>
a yr and half later even the thought  of anything stressful sends her into <br/>
panic  if anything gets hard she&#39;s in  tears  if something she is doing presents <br/>
any kind of challenge she gets  horrible headaches.  Any input? Normally id <br/>
just flow with it  but its  starting to be frustrating to her  she says mom im <br/>

Even me reading to  her  will sometimes trigger these meltdowns.  Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you tried books on tape? That way you can sit together and <br/>
listen without that immediacy of &quot;will she make me read the next <br/>
page/paragraph/word?&quot; since you&#39;ll just be listening too (maybe <br/>
start off listening in the car for instance where she *knows* you <br/>
aren&#39;t about to pull out a book). Libraries often have books on tape <br/>
available. And Cracker Barrel restaurants have books on tape <br/>
rentals. See if you can find a favorite author or genre or something <br/>
to start off with. Odds are, she doesn&#39;t twinge about watching a <br/>
movie (even one based on a book, like the Narnia movie which is out <br/>
on DVD now). Also, maybe try to get specific on &quot;sad and hurtful&quot; <br/>
sometime aside from the immediate situation - is it an emotional <br/>
sadness left over from being forced to read in school (with the <br/>
attendant feelings of inadequacy possibly and definitely stress) or <br/>
is it a physical eyestrain, headachy type feeling which could <br/>
indicate vision problems? And, too, maybe take the emphasis off <br/>
reading *books* for a while. Reading is everywhere - TV listings, <br/>
cereal boxes, recipes, gardening info (when, where, and how to plant <br/>
seeds on the seed packets for example), grocery lists and circulars, <br/>
etc. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was going to suggest the same thing.  Our public library has tons of books<br/>
on tape for both adults and children.  The children&#39;s ones come with the<br/>
book included most of the time so they can read along if they like (or if it<br/>
is picture books just look at the pictures.)  One of our favorite books on<br/>
tape was to The Gardner.  It&#39;s about a girl during the great depression who<br/>
goes to live with family members because her parents are going through a<br/>
rough time (financially).  It&#39;s a lovely book and always makes me smile!<br/>
The voice on the tape is soothing and sweet.  Some children&#39;s books on tape<br/>
are annoying because of the person reading the book sounds like they are<br/>
reading down to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
And there is nothing wrong with watching video adaptations of books either.<br/>
As much as I love the written word, I enjoy movies as well!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to say that your son&#39;s current activities sound like unschooling to me!  If you want him to read, it needs to be something about his interests.  And he is already &quot;exploring things&quot; and &quot;taking on projects.&quot;  I wonder if you expected him to decide to study something more school-ish.  Maybe take on a project like building his own Egyptian pyramid from card board.  I know there are kids that are way into ancient Egypt, but it sounds like your kid is the more physical type.  And he is developing the interests that are important to him.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to make sure you understand that unschooling is going to look a lot like what you are seeing right now.  This is your son without school.  You don&#39;t have a bookish kid.  You have your son, and he sounds fabulous just the way he is!!  <br/>
<br/>
To unschool, you take those interests that you listed, and make sure he has what he needs to persue those interests--like other people that are also interested in those things.   <br/>
<br/>
I am always late on adding to the discussion here, but I really want to point out that other replies to this topic make it sound like after your son is finished deschooling, then he will do more things that look like what you were expecting.   Instead, I think he will continue to be himself only better:  he won&#39;t have school.  <br/>

Are you pursuing your interests?  Do they see you pursuing your interests?<br/>
What are your interests?  Do you knit, stamp, scrapbook, cook, garden, play<br/>

those interests?  Do you get involved in their interests?  Do you play xbox<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can really relate to you. (sorry if this is a bit long but I feel for you!) <br/>
I was the same way when we first started. Our dd&#39;s are 11 & 12, we pulled <br/>
them out of school 17 months ago. (one was in 4th & one in 5th grade) We had <br/>
intended on doing curriculum initially, decided to let them DEschool for a while <br/>
and soon after that I got a bit freaked out that they weren&#39;t learning anything <br/>
and began taking them on a lot of field trips with hs groups and by <br/>
ourselves. They very quickly began hating to go any where! I was so surprised! I <br/>
figured that they would want to get out and about but they were soooo drained from <br/>
all those yrs. in school. I think they were &quot;tired&quot; and their brains were <br/>
&quot;tired&quot; so we quit &quot;doing and going&quot; and we just let them &quot;be and do&quot; on their own <br/>
and I watched them slowly start coming around. They seemed more relaxed and <br/>
happier as time went on. At the same time I had been reading more about <br/>
unschooling and I could see that that was exactly what we needed in our lives and from <br/>
then on, we never looked back.<br/>
<br/>
You are definitely expecting too much, but I don&#39;t think you should kick <br/>
yourself for wondering if you are, it&#39;s hard not to at first and I think it&#39;s all <br/>
a part of &quot;your&quot; learning and growing right a long with your son. (which, for <br/>
me, was such a wonderful reality!:o) It can be sort of scary pulling your kid <br/>
out and just letting him go, but we (and so many others here) are living proof <br/>
that it DOES work and all will be &quot;ok&quot;! <br/>
<br/>
My kids still sit at the computer a lot, watch tv a lot and play outside a <br/>
lot, BUT, that is not all they do now! They are into 4-H with their <br/>
animals....dog obedience classes, horse shows and clinics, volunteering with their club, <br/>
(all this is LOTS of learning, but they are doing it on their terms, nothing <br/>
wrong with that, that&#39;s how I learn best too:o) They have just started their own <br/>
business selling eggs from their chickens. They are raising some new chicks <br/>
that they bought right now and are planning on mating one of last yrs. hens <br/>
with their new rooster so that they can hatch some out themselves in the <br/>
incubator and also have one of the hens hatch a few. All of this will require that <br/>
they learn about how to do it, again they are doing it on their own and it&#39;s all <br/>
pretty much things they probably wouldn&#39;t have done when they were in school, <br/>
they would have been too tired, busy with school work and so turned off at <br/>
learning anything after sitting in a class rm. all day being forced) They are <br/>
also into figure skating and are able to do it way more now than if they were in <br/>
school. (they & their coach love going during the school day, they have the <br/>
place to themselves:o) They read books & magazines that &quot;they want&quot; to read, <br/>
when they feel like it, which, for them is a lot, they both happen to like <br/>
reading, but hated forced reading in school and who doesn&#39;t! Our oldest was told in <br/>
the 3rd grade by a teacher that &quot;she just wasn&#39;t good at math and that she <br/>
better study a lot harder or she wouldn&#39;t be able to make it once she got up to <br/>
the 5th grade&quot; She always did great in school, but had a bit of trouble in <br/>
math. Ya know what that did to her? In her eyes it told her that she was dumb, <br/>
that she just wasn&#39;t capable of learning math, so, she ended up HATING math and <br/>
all of her other grades went down hill that yr. Since unschooling, there are no <br/>
grades and we have never forced anything on them, including math and the <br/>
other day, my Katie, the one who fought me tooth and nail about doing math when <br/>
she was in school said &quot;Ya know what Mom? I actually like math now, it&#39;s fun!&quot; <br/>
(of course I about fell over) and she continued with,  &quot;I am good at it and I <br/>
know I always could have been.&quot; (she said that with a grin) &quot;I just didn&#39;t want <br/>
to do it when I was in school. I was just like that because if I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand  something in math I always felt like they thought I was stupid. I hated <br/>
being embarrassed about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think at the beginning our kids had this huge & overwhelming feeling of <br/>
relief, they needed that time to just &quot;be&quot; without any pressures from anything or <br/>
anyone.... what a liberating feeling that must have been for them. &lt;g&gt; You <br/>
are doing such a great thing for your son and he will thank you for it and you <br/>
will thank yourself. Our whole family has benefited from unschooling. Our <br/>
family is closer and we seem to have this unique bond between us now that I think <br/>
schooled families unfortunately cannot obtain.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you on your journey, it is a fun one!<br/>

My DS,  10, has only been out of PS for 2 weeks. I am pleased having<br/>
him home and  he seems very happy. I think that I had this vision of<br/>
him taking on  projects, reading on his own, exploring things, etc. and<br/>
it&#39;s just not  happening. Am I expecting too much, too soon? All he&#39;s<br/>
doing right now is  riding his dirt bike, playing playstation, watching<br/>
TV, and playing  basketball and baseball. Reassure me that it&#39;s all<br/>
going to be OK.  <br/>

Betsy, I promise, promise it&#39;s going to be okay. Actually, it&#39;s only been  <br/>
two weeks and he&#39;s doing all that? You&#39;re golden, babe!<br/>
 <br/>
When we first started, Julian had been in school through the third grade.  We <br/>
had some glorious ideas of the things he would do. We&#39;d read the book Better  <br/>
Than School, by Nancy Wallace, and expected that Julian, who was also <br/>
interested  in music, would be writing operas, doing scientific exploration, etc. <br/>
Nah....  But Julian has actually turned out quite well, and he&#39;s 16 and I almost <br/>
never  panic that I&#39;ve messed up his life forever. ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Relax. He has some time and freedom to play and be outside during the  <br/>
daylight for the first time in a long time. He sounds like he&#39;s having a really  <br/>
healthy deschooling process and that he&#39;s really happy. Just keep an eye out for  <br/>
when he might like to go or do something cool. And play with him. It&#39;s gonna <br/>
be  okay...it already is.<br/>

I am serious folks!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They are &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing what makes sense for each of them and for your family. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m serious too! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Your part in all of this is to bring interesting things and ideas into their lives. Give them possibilities. Offer them books, movies, games, activities, friends, conversation, art, music, etc. Offer them the world! Then follow their lead. They&#39;ll choose what sparks an interest for them. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, LOTS of times a kid just needs to roll in the dirt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Have they asked to arts and crafts or other things?  What are YOU doing?<br/>
Are you pursuing your interests?  Do they see you pursuing your interests?<br/>
What are your interests?  Do you knit, stamp, scrapbook, cook, garden, play<br/>
games, take leisure classes, build models, sew, etc?  Do you include them in<br/>
those interests?  Do you get involved in their interests?  Do you play xbox<br/>
or go outside and roll in the dirt (although I will admit that I would have<br/>
problems with that one myself - a tad outside my comfort zone due to really<br/>
bad childhood memories LOL!)  Get into their world and invite them into<br/>
yours.  Deschooling does look a whole lot like unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
On March 18, 2003, two days before her son launched the<br/>
invasion of Iraq, Barbara Bush appeared on Good Morning<br/>
America. Our nation&#39;s &quot;First Mother&quot; asked Diane<br/>
Sawyer, &quot;Why should we hear about body bags and death <br/>
and how many? . . . Oh, I mean, it&#39;s not relevant. So<br/>
why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like<br/>
that.&quot; <br/>
Like mother, like son.<br/>
