hi!  Im Shell, 36yo mama to two mega busy boys  Drew is 8.5 and Josh is<br/>
4.5.  We live in Orange County, California with hubby/dad Eric who works in<br/>
the video gaming industry.  Weve been homeschooling since Drew was brought<br/>
home from Kindergarten about ¾ of the way through the year.  That was 3<br/>
years ago and we adore being together (nearly) all the time.  The past 2<br/>
years wed been with a public charter who provided a very strict curriculum.<br/>
Drew is Autistic, and craves structure, so I assumed that a regulated school<br/>
experience would be best, even though my heart has always been freedom<br/>
loving.  How wrong I was!  The arguments, tears, disgust and stress were a<br/>
weekly experience.  This year we are with a more open public charter, and<br/>
started the year with a more eclectic approach.  That worked really well,<br/>
but still too much coercion and unhappiness.  For the past few weeks, weve<br/>
embraced the unschooling life and are much MUCH happier!  Were not 100% on<br/>
board, but Im not approaching this with a checklist in hand, trying to be a<br/>
perfect unschooler.  Were just saying yes a ton, doing activities we enjoy<br/>
and not requiring anyone to do schoolish work.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ill admit to being a bit on edge some days, not seeing the schoolish<br/>
learning that Im accustomed to.  Even though I truly believe in natural,<br/>
self-driven learning!  How brainwashed we become, how against our inner<br/>
wisdom we can go in our society.  So the next little while is much more<br/>
about ME letting go and freeing us all to be ourselves than it is about the<br/>
kids figuring it out.  Theyre happy and having a great time being kids. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644727123">Hi.<br/>
I&#39;ve got some spectrumy that we&#39;re unschooling as well. It has been a  <br/>
wonderful ride, and it&#39;s funny to see conventional belief about the  <br/>
kids turned on it&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling late and so also did a lot of the PARENTS  <br/>
letting go. Kids did fine ;-)<br/>
Wecome to the group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768103826">Hi Shell,<br/>
   <br/>
  I am new to this group as well, but have embraced the unschooling approach for about three years. I have 2 daughters at home still, ages (almost) 15 and (just turned) 10. I also have older children who are either married and/or on their own. I was widowed nearly 3 years ago, which was a precedent to my discovery of unschooling and putting in to practice what I knew would be best for my kiddos. <br/>
   <br/>
  You sound like you are doing a great job, definitely moving in the &quot;right&quot; direction. <br/>
  Have fun with your new adventure, and enjoy those kiddos. They grow up way too fast.<br/>
  Also, I have to say that I love the John Irving quote you used in your signature; it is so true!<br/>
   <br/>
