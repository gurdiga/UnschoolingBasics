<div id="ygrps-yiv-611676848">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Shannon and am new to the list but not to unschooling.  My four kids<br/>
have always been unschooled and they are 11, 9, 6, and 4.  We have no doubts<br/>
about the value of unschooling, and no fears our kids aren&#39;t going to learn<br/>
through unschooling.  They are insatiably curious, have never been pushed<br/>
toward anything but have had the freedom to follow their bliss.  We are all<br/>
drawn to nature and celebrating the seasons and were part of a<br/>
nature-inspired group before we moved last month.  Through this group the<br/>
kids encountered some Waldorf-inspired friends and we have blended in the<br/>
aspects they are interested in, while keeping to our unschooling life.  They<br/>
love to knit, for example, and make candles and apple sauce and explore the<br/>
earth.  We are committed to having fun and enjoying each other.  We even<br/>
have a list of fun ways the kids have come up with to clean house together<br/>
(when we feel like cleaning together).  Sometimes it looks like crazy people<br/>
chasing each other through the house cackling, and sometimes we empty a<br/>
room, smudge it, and put back only the things we want to stay in that room.<br/>
Sometimes they create a store, with their toy cash register, and shoppers<br/>
bring bags of &quot;room debris&quot; to buy at the checkout counter.  <br/>
<br/>
We consider ourselves from Austin, but have spent the past 7-1/2 years in<br/>
the SF Bay Area and last month moved down to San Diego.  So, we&#39;re beginning<br/>
a new journey down here and enjoying the local unschooling group&#39;s beach<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be here,<br/>
Shannon<br/>
