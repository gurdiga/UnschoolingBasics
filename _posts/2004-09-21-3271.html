<div id="ygrps-yiv-260070650">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Chris. Dd (6-3/4 ya know how important that 3/4 is to someone her<br/>
age) and ds (13) and I have been homeschooling from the beginning, relaxed<br/>
homeschooling for about 12 of those years and really unschooling for the<br/>
past 6 months or so.  Dd is an artist, loves pokemon, yu-gi-oh, yoga,<br/>
soccer, polly pockets, barbies, Harry Potter and most of all medieval<br/>
imaginary play.  Ds is a musician, loves fantasy role-playing video games,<br/>
DDR, a voracious reader and has a tender, gentle heart.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my question: I would very much like to turn ds loose researching his<br/>
interests on the internet but I don&#39;t know how to protect him from the<br/>
images and ideas that would scar his tender heart and brain should he<br/>
stumble across them.  Is there any safe way for him to surf to his heart&#39;s<br/>
content without fear of coming across explicit material?  If it matters, we<br/>
are all Apple computers in this house. What do you do?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073734090">I do nothing at all and my 14yo does not appear to suffer for it. If<br/>
this does not appeal to you there are any number of products on the<br/>
market, but I can tell you from my work experience that your son may<br/>
well be blocked from searches such as<br/>
<br/>
breast cancer<br/>
Salem witches<br/>
&quot;the great Satan&quot; (Khomeini&#39;s opinion of the US, remember?)<br/>

You may not think that this is such a bad thing, and that is the<br/>
beauty of homeschooling, you do yours and I do mine. But I just<br/>
thought I would point out the downside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718980737">Hi Chris-<br/>
Welcome! Your username caught my attention because I am Sandra and <br/>
dh is Andrew and family calls us &quot;Sandrew&quot;!<br/>
Anyway, I understand your concerns re: pop-ups etc on Internet. My <br/>
dh installed &quot;parental controls&quot; through Yahoo - I think it asks you <br/>
to specify the types of things you would like to have screened, etc?<br/>
I can get more info if you like.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
Go to Google. Click on Preferences on the right. Scroll down a bit and you<br/>
get 3 choices:<br/>
<br/>
* Use strict filtering (Filter both explicit text and explicit images)<br/>
* Use moderate filtering (Filter explicit images only - default behavior)<br/>
* Do not filter my search results.<br/>
<br/>
Which ever you choose will be the default each time you use Google.<br/>

Thanks Joyce, for the info on google&#39;s safe search. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I have a question I hope someone can help with.  I was playing with those<br/>
features.  I selected safe search and then I proceeded to type in some racy<br/>
words into google.  Now, whenever I start to type something in google it<br/>
comes up with my memorized searches(if they start with the same letter) and<br/>
those words pop up.  LOL!  I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to delete them.<br/>
This isn&#39;t just the history, I already deleted that.  Can anyone help me?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

In the personal information section you will find a button labeled<br/>
&quot;Autocomplete...&quot;  click it and it will let you clear it out as well<br/>
as set a few preferences to keep that from happening in the future.<br/>

controls before they were way too restrictive.  I think that they were only<br/>
allowing access to previewed and approved websites and we were rarely able<br/>
to access anything of interest to us -=-<br/>

My married name is Sanders; maiden name is Andrews so Sandrew is a<br/>
combination of the two.  Dh and I dated in high school and I used to play<br/>
name games -- Put an &quot;S&quot; in front of the &quot;A&quot;, transpose the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;e&quot; and<br/>
drop the &quot;w&quot; turns Andrews into Sanders -- silly teen stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Yahoo parental control info.  I had no idea.  I&#39;ll look into<br/>
it. -=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632771483">you didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  A cookie is a little piece of code that<br/>
keeps track of stuff relating to websites you visit.  Google uses a<br/>
cookie to remember that you prefer safe searches.  the problem with<br/>
cookies is that they can be used to track all sorts of things you do<br/>
in websites.  They can also tell the website owner what you have been<br/>
doing (visited websites, etc...).  You can change your cookie settings<br/>
in Internet explorer by clicking on tools, choosing options and then<br/>
going to the Privacy option.  This lets you set all sorts of options<br/>
for how your computer handles cookies.  First, there should be a bar<br/>
on the screen that lets you set your privacy levels - block all<br/>
cookies is the highest, allow all cookies is the lowest.<br/>
<br/>
You also have an import button, an advanced button (I wouldn&#39;t use it,<br/>
but that&#39;s just me), a default button and an edit button.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you what you want to set your cookies at, but that is<br/>
where you would set them.<br/>
