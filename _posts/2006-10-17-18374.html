<div id="ygrps-yiv-335089510">With the upcoming elections I would really like to be informed.  Would <br/>
any of you be willing to share with me where you get your <br/>
information?  How do you educate yourself on the issues and the <br/>
politicians in order to make your voting decisions? <br/>
<br/>
Politics aside, I would just like to learn where to find credible <br/>
information.  You can email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:zoocrew@...">zoocrew@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks a ton - Tina</div>

by proponents of the various sides. I guess there are local chapters  <br/>
so maybe they don&#39;t send out information everywhere.<br/>

I was just at the library today and discovered a paper put out by <br/>
League of Women Voters.  I have never received anything in the mail <br/>
before, but I am glad to know of the resource.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your idea...<br/>
