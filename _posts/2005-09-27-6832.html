<div id="ygrps-yiv-609588053">&quot;When it&#39;s too late, it&#39;s too late. Do it now. Do it soon. And add to<br/>
it as they <br/>
grow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is really good advice.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a video camera...sadly, mine was destroyed in an<br/>
accident, but I DO write about our lives.<br/>
Journals or blogs are another way to capture moments and memories for<br/>
your children. I really, really wish my Mum had kept more personal<br/>
writing..she only wrote for classes most of the time. Sad.<br/>
<br/>
I have SO many questions for her now, and it&#39;s too late. You always<br/>
think you&#39;re going to get a bit more time.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, she had an active, interesting life while living<br/>
with breast cancer for 12 years. I really believe there are a lot of<br/>
great alternative therapies now, and combined with modern medicine,<br/>
there is MUCH hope for cancer patients.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking about you Holly.<br/>
