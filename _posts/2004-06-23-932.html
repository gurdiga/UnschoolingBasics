I just wanted to say thank you for sharing your experience.  You have<br/>
motivated me to do something I have thought about but never followed through<br/>
with.  My fil owns a manufacturing plant.  They make musical instruments.  I<br/>
have never taken a tour there.  I have had relatives who did and my best<br/>
friends family did on a recent trip but neither I nor my four year old have.<br/>
It&#39;s funny because Mark is the tour guide.  Anyway, I am going to schedule a<br/>
tour in the near future.  Thanks again.  It was fun looking at the website<br/>
too.<br/>
