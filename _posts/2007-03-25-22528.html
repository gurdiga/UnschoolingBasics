<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378531381">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so here&#39;s my 2nd problem for group discussion.  (Katharine is  <br/>
probably laughing her head off that I am posting this problem to yet  <br/>
another group!)<br/>
<br/>
We have a wonderful cat - she is tolerant, friendly, and playful.   <br/>
Paige (who is 4) adores her (as we all do) and shows her this love by  <br/>
picking her up constantly, laying on top of her, carrying her around  <br/>
(sometime slinging her over her shoulders), holding her even if the  <br/>
cat is struggling, and a variety of other things that are both  <br/>
irritating to the cat, and very difficult for me to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Because the cat is sooooo tolerant, she mostly sits there with either  <br/>
a blank expression on her face, or one that looks like she&#39;s thinking  <br/>
&quot;help me please&quot;.  She will sometimes back away from Paige, but it&#39;s  <br/>
very slow and rarely quickly enough to run away.  She even comes up  <br/>
to Paige several times a day, looking for Paige to pet her, which  <br/>
shows that she still likes her.  A good thing is that she rarely  <br/>
bites or scratches (or if she does it&#39;s very gentle biting or  <br/>
scratching).  But, when she does finally decide to bite, Paige is  <br/>
totally incensed.<br/>
<br/>
I have a varied response to this (which I&#39;m sure is part of the  <br/>
problem!).  Sometimes I think that the cat can take care of herself  <br/>
and I let it go.  But, then I&#39;ll see Paige so something like go into  <br/>
my bedroom, close the door and I walk in to find her laying on top of  <br/>
the cat.  Or, I&#39;ll see Paige run out of the room with the cat slung  <br/>
over her shoulders.  At those times I see it as an animal welfare  <br/>
issue and I intervene.  Mostly I try to help Paige to recognize  <br/>
Monty&#39;s signals (squirming, meowing, etc), or encourage her to play  <br/>
in ways that the cat really likes.  But, overall, the whole thing has  <br/>
become a difficult issue between Paige and I.  She gets really mad at  <br/>
me for intervening, or feels really sad when I do.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is normal behavior for a 4 year old.  I also know  <br/>
that some of it is that she is looking for my attention, so I have  <br/>
been trying to focus on having more time alone with Paige and doing  <br/>
things she really enjoys - working toward repairing whatever might be  <br/>
missing in our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
So, overall I think that letting her and the cat work it out, and  <br/>
looking for ways to help Paige feel less desirous to use the cat to  <br/>
get my attention is what I want to do.  It&#39;s when I see it as animal  <br/>
mistreatment that I have a problem -  that&#39;s the part I really get  <br/>
stuck on.  I don&#39;t want to see Monty being mistreated, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
want either Paige or Tess to think that I think it&#39;s okay to do  <br/>
that.  So, overall I don&#39;t know how to present a balanced approach to  <br/>
this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Again, probably not one of the more difficult problems in the world,  <br/>
but another good example of struggles that stymie me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
