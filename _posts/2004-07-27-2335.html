<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651414963">I have a question that has been lingering for a while. A friend asked me the <br/>
same question the other day so here goes.....<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids ages 12 to 3 mo.. Of all of them my 2 yr. old is the most <br/>
challenging for me emotionally. He has an ear ringing scream that he knows rocks <br/>
every ones world and usually has a smile on his face when he does it. I get it <br/>
and can deal with his new stand in the house but....... <br/>
<br/>
My stress-ER is that he often wants what the 4 yr. old has. We have a cycle I <br/>
cant seem to change in our home. He sees a toy or item she has, she spots his <br/>
eyes looking, she packs up and runs, screaming begins. Now she is yelling and <br/>
he is crying/screaming and sometimes hits her. After the 12 yr. olds <br/>
neighborhood worries (long story, scary neighbor, maybe later I&#39;ll ask that question) <br/>
and not eating/meetting my needs when I need to bc I am with a newborn who <br/>
nurses for comfort and about the 5th time in a day that they have fought I have <br/>
had enough.  What do you do? <br/>
<br/>
The problem is four kids is different from 2 or 3. I have a friend with 4 <br/>
also and she agrees its just different. I have told her that what I try to do is <br/>
keep reassuring them, doling out the item or *asking one to share with the <br/>
other.  My son is just 2 and understands what most of my words are but he&#39;s not <br/>
one I can reason with.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface it seems like an easy fix but in the end they are fine in <br/>
minutes but I am left feeling like a train wreck. Its not like this every day but <br/>
the days that they get to each other im raising my voice more then I care to. <br/>
My husband works all day so its mostly me that has the bulk of the hours with <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions/advice unschooling/parenting in a large family anyone?<br/>

    I have 4 kids 11, 5, 3.5 & 1.  I have several of the same things<br/>
happening in my house and truthfully haven&#39;t found the answer yet, but it is<br/>
getting a little better.  My 11 and 5 year old do not really get along very<br/>
well.  They both have outgoing personalities and love to be the leader, so<br/>
you can imagine this could cause some problems.  My sons 5 & 3.5 love to get<br/>
each other going.  5 year old sees a toy that 3.5 year old is using and will<br/>
find some way to take it from him or relentlessly ask him for it over and<br/>
over again just to bug him.  My 3.5 year old has a great high pitched scream<br/>
as well.  Whenever my 1 year old hears these arguments he has an interesting<br/>
reaction.  He often yells really loud until his siblings look at him or he<br/>
runs up to them and bites them.  Oddly enough when they see him coming they<br/>
break up the argument and that&#39;s the end of it for at least the next 5<br/>
minutes or so.  I tell them that they&#39;re arguing is frustrating him and he&#39;s<br/>
just telling you all to be quiet, but they seem to think it&#39;s funny.<br/>
    I do notice that most of the time when this happens a change of scenery<br/>
is all that&#39;s needed.  They rarely argue outside.  My husband has a much<br/>
lower threshold for the bickering than I do.  Sometimes when they are all<br/>
running around like banshees at our dinner time ( my husband and I like to<br/>
eat at a certain time, but the kids don&#39;t have a schedule) he asks me if he<br/>
can turn one of our rooms in to a padded room and lock them in. He says this<br/>
in jest of course.  I kind of agree with the padded room though, wouldn&#39;t<br/>
that be a blast!  Not locked in of course.<br/>
    Anyway all this might not sound very reassuring, but I really do see<br/>
progress.  They have been finding subtle ways of working it out on their own<br/>
sometimes.  When they do I just casually let them know that I&#39;m glad they<br/>
worked it out and we just naturally move on.<br/>

<br/>
I have no amazing advice for you right now, it&#39;s just too early for <br/>
me.  (That&#39;s another story.)  BUT, I wanted to support you in this <br/>
statement.  We have seven children, and somehow having many children <br/>
makes you a magnet for other large families.  I have talked with <br/>
plenty of other mothers that can attest to this as well.  There is <br/>
just something about when you cross the threshold from 3 children to <br/>
four or more.  The dynamics really change.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get some great advice from the group about your <br/>
situation.  I can see how it must be very stressful for you.  If I <br/>
think of something later I&#39;ll be sure to post.<br/>

&quot;The  problem is four kids is different from 2 or 3. I have a friend <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
*************************<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
As mom to 5, ages 9 to 25, I can say I agree with the numbers  quotient.  <br/>
Everything changes after 3.  With that said:<br/>
 <br/>
You cannot change your children or their personalities.  You can  change your <br/>
perception of their situation.  Their dynamics are known only  to the <br/>
individual child.  You can &quot;try&quot; to help them find coping  strategies, but since the <br/>
dynamics and their needs change from day to day or  moment by moment, that&#39;s <br/>
like spinning your wheels in most cases too.<br/>
 <br/>
It is often our discomfort at the noise or the tears or the day to day life  <br/>
with that many personalities under one roof that leads us to search for  <br/>
&quot;solutions&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are the things I&#39;ve tried to keep in mind, while mindfully  parenting:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
1)  Each of your children is learning something valuable from the  others. <br/>
 <br/>
2)  You cannot be all things to all of your children at all  moments.<br/>
 <br/>
3)  Each of your children was an infant that needed you totally at one  time <br/>
- they&#39;ve all ready had that and sometimes they need to &quot;wait&quot;. Now it is  <br/>
this baby&#39;s turn and any subsequent babies after this one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
4)  The less you try to referee now, the more able they will become in  <br/>
solving their own issues.<br/>
 <br/>
5)  They may grow up to be best friends without your  interference.<br/>
 <br/>
It is hard to watch our children when we perceive them to be needing or  <br/>
hurting, but remember - they are your perceptions and vast amounts will be  <br/>
learned if you lovingly support, offer kindness and gentleness and let them  chart <br/>
their own way.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I do not have this situation but I read a great book on siblings.  <br/>
It has some good suggestions as to help the kids get along and lots <br/>
of other advice.  The book is &quot;Siblings without rivalry&quot; by Adele <br/>

singsongy school voice. <br/>
 <br/>

good memories for me.  Well at least the finger pointing torture does.  I<br/>
was the champ of ignoring that certain torture that my brother did to me.  I<br/>
was so proud of myself when until he decided that something more aggressive<br/>
needed to be devised.  He finally tried what he liked to call water torture.<br/>
He would pin my arms down with his knees and let this huge line of spit come<br/>
out of his mouth until it practically touched my nose and then he would<br/>
slurp it back in.  I know that this stuff may sound just awful to some of<br/>
you, but we both look back at these times and laugh.  At the time, however I<br/>

     The older they are the more creative they get about the picking.  Did<br/>
you have siblings?  I had four older brothers and I see my most annoying<br/>
brother in my daughter sometimes.  You also need to consider that sometimes<br/>
they annoy each other and then seem to have fun with it all.  So I guess my<br/>
question to you is; what if STOP IT isn&#39;t enough?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603200543">LOL, Same here! ive even thought after seeing that commercial that I have no <br/>
patience because there is no way I could pretend that&#39;s not happening. When I <br/>
see that I see my kids. He does do that and she yells out its maddening. He <br/>
stops when I ask but he just gets more creative.  They are quiet shy kids to <br/>
other people though. <br/>
<br/>
After I posted that the younger two were up stairs playing. The screaming <br/>
begins when the 4yr old packs up stuff to take to her room/play with or hide. I <br/>
explained to her that when she makes eye contact with him, hides it then runs <br/>
from the room it only increases his interest in the cat and mouse game. So she <br/>
knows what he will do and he knows what see with do but neither want to budge. <br/>
In the end they both survive the battle but I am left feeling tired and an <br/>
aching head not to mention an awake baby. <br/>

Now that Nicholas is getting older and figuring out the buttons to push he <br/>
sees that touching her in any way sends her screaming he does it but the change <br/>
is that she knows she can push him and he cant catch her.. Its a cycle I wish <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761035698">I only have one child so I can&#39;t speak to this juggling. But when I <br/>
read the post I felt that the mother&#39;s attention went to what she <br/>
deemed the most important need. But, if I were the child needing mom, <br/>
I would choose to escalate my needs to get her attention. <br/>
Unfortunately for the older children, it sounds like the baby is the <br/>
one getting all the attention. How would you feel if your parent <br/>
seemed to knowingly give all the attention to the baby repeatedly? <br/>
<br/>
A question I ask myself when my child appears to be vying for my <br/>
attention is &#39;what need is he trying to meet?&#39;. If it is for an <br/>
adult&#39;s attention perhaps enriching the environment for these older <br/>
children inside or outside of the home with other adults might help.<br/>
<br/>
We had a couple of children and their dad over yesterday to play. <br/>
Each of the dad&#39;s children kept trying to tattle, pick at the other, <br/>
and engage me or their dad. He was busy trying to work on something. <br/>
I willingly was able to give each a share of my direct attention and <br/>
their requests for my attention became much more specific and <br/>
constructive nearly immediately. Only then were they able to play <br/>
more independently, but kept checking back for more.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps having an older person (16-75 years old) who can provide the <br/>
adult attention that they are seeking over might help meet these <br/>
needs. Another thing I have noticed with my friend who just had her <br/>
fourth baby is that the older children need to be with others their <br/>
age, but are homebound because of the new baby. For nearly a month <br/>
before the baby and now the baby is 8 weeks old they haven&#39;t been to <br/>
park days, friends houses, etc. because the baby is so much work and <br/>
mom doesn&#39;t have the energy. The baby isn&#39;t the only one in the <br/>
family with needs. The older boys have been invited out but <br/>
are &quot;needed&quot; to help with the third child, so they aren&#39;t able yet.<br/>
For three months now, that is a long time to a 10 year old. Not long <br/>
to a 20 or 30 or 40 year old. <br/>
<br/>
There is a book called Siblings Without Rivalry by Adele Faber and <br/>
Elaine Mazlish. It talks about the older child&#39;s point of view of <br/>
being invaded by the new baby and how to prevent rivalry and how to <br/>
continue to meet the needs of the older child creatively without <br/>
relying on them to help parent the younger child. Allowing them to <br/>
remain the child they are. Basically, if the child could meet his <br/>
needs he would. I know when my child doesn&#39;t, it is because he needs <br/>
help. I try to facilitate his needs. &quot;Waiting&quot; is only tolerated for <br/>
a while, then one must escalate their needs to be heard. <br/>
<br/>
I disagree that it only our perception when our children appear to be <br/>
hurting or needing. It is listening to our child&#39;s call for help. Why <br/>
would a child only appear to be hurt or needing unless they were. I <br/>
too provide my son with loving support, offer kindness and gentleness <br/>
but I don&#39;t expect to leave him to chart his own way when he is <br/>
calling for help and attention.  <br/>
<br/>
I am sure it is different for children with siblings, but can their <br/>
needs not still be heard and facilitated? Nurturing a child can not <br/>
be done alone forever. Only when a baby is a baby can a mother feel <br/>
like she alone can meet her child&#39;s needs. I see many women acting <br/>
like the baby needs them most, so once the next baby comes along the <br/>
other child&#39;s needs must diminish. I think the older child&#39;s needs <br/>
must actually increase due to the new challenges. Relying on others <br/>
to continue to help meet the needs of the older children becomes <br/>
necessary. Relying on the children to try to meet each other&#39;s needs <br/>
isn&#39;t facilitating. They still need adults to listen and help, they <br/>
are telling you so themselves.<br/>

&gt; &quot;The  problem is four kids is different from 2 or 3. I have a <br/>
friend <br/>
&gt; with 4 also  and she agrees its just different.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; As mom to 5, ages 9 to 25, I can say I agree with the numbers  <br/>
quotient.  <br/>
&gt; Everything changes after 3.  With that said:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You cannot change your children or their personalities.  You can  <br/>
change your <br/>
&gt; perception of their situation.  Their dynamics are known only  to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; individual child.  You can &quot;try&quot; to help them find coping  <br/>
strategies, but since the <br/>
&gt; dynamics and their needs change from day to day or  moment by <br/>
moment, that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; like spinning your wheels in most cases too.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is often our discomfort at the noise or the tears or the day to <br/>
day life  <br/>
&gt; with that many personalities under one roof that leads us to search <br/>
for  <br/>
&gt; &quot;solutions&quot;.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Here are the things I&#39;ve tried to keep in mind, while mindfully  <br/>
parenting:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 1)  Each of your children is learning something valuable from the  <br/>
others. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 2)  You cannot be all things to all of your children at all  <br/>
moments.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 3)  Each of your children was an infant that needed you totally at <br/>
one  time <br/>
&gt; - they&#39;ve all ready had that and sometimes they need to &quot;wait&quot;. Now <br/>
it is  <br/>
&gt; this baby&#39;s turn and any subsequent babies after this one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 4)  The less you try to referee now, the more able they will become <br/>
in  <br/>
&gt; solving their own issues.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 5)  They may grow up to be best friends without your  interference.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is hard to watch our children when we perceive them to be <br/>
needing or  <br/>
&gt; hurting, but remember - they are your perceptions and vast amounts <br/>
will be  <br/>
&gt; learned if you lovingly support, offer kindness and gentleness and <br/>
let them  chart <br/>
&gt; their own way.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
The older they are the more creative they  get about the picking.  Did<br/>
you have siblings?  I had four older  brothers and I see my most annoying<br/>
brother in my daughter sometimes.   You also need to consider that sometimes<br/>
they annoy each other and then  seem to have fun with it all.  So I guess my<br/>
question to you is; what  if STOP IT isn&#39;t enough?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have a brother. Fifteen months younger. We fought like cats and  dogs---no, <br/>
worse! My dogs and cats get along wonderfully! My brother and I still  get by <br/>
just fine without seeing each other or speaking for months/years at a  time. <br/>
I know all about bickering.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d put a stop to ALL annoyances. ALL. I hated it then and I hate it now.  <br/>
It&#39;s NOT fun if everybody&#39;s not playing, and it&#39;s not a game if someone&#39;s not  <br/>
having fun. It&#39;s YOUR job to keep it from happening. Didn&#39;t you ever wish your  <br/>
mother would just step in and stop them?<br/>
 <br/>
I would sit them down and tell them how I felt about it. Seriously. And  tell <br/>
them how I felt when Johnny did things to me. How he may have felt when I  <br/>
did things to him (always in retaliation). I&#39;d tell them how I feel now when I  <br/>
see them doing things to hurt or annoy or insult or *anything* their siblings. <br/>
 I&#39;d tell them it WILL not happen anymore because that is my job: to protect <br/>
each  and every one of them----even if it&#39;s from the other sibling. It WILL <br/>
NOT happen  anymore. Stop it and Don&#39;t do it again. <br/>
 <br/>
We have a principle here: Be Kind.   If what you&#39;re doing is  unkind----in <br/>
ANY way---stop what you&#39;re doing NOW. That includes me and Ben as  well.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t have any problems with it in our famiily, but when friends come  <br/>
over, it&#39;s common. I hate having siblings visit, but that happens a lot  <br/>
(Duncan&#39;s best friends are two sets of siblings; they come in pairs) .  They tease and <br/>
annoy and are often just plain mean. I put a stop to that as soon  as I see <br/>
it---and lately before it even starts, because I know it&#39;s coming: I  try to <br/>
head it off at the pass.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t do it here; I&#39;ll take you home. One chance and one chance only. Don&#39;t  <br/>
do it.<br/>
 <br/>
I lived with it as a child---and purposefully have two &quot;onlies&quot;, eight  years <br/>
apart. I couldn&#39;t handle that meaness. I used to tell Ben (my  husband) that <br/>
HE was the thirty-three year old and that he should act like the  adult when <br/>
he and Cameron used to get into it. I told Cameron, when he was 13,  to <br/>
remember that Duncan was just five. Cameron (and Ben) had more control  over their <br/>
emotions and actions than the littler one. Be responsible for  your actions. <br/>
Quit being mean. Just quit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536322215">&quot;That is exactly my problem here as well. I truthfully find the 11 & <br/>
5 year old bickering situation much more annoying than the 3 and 5 <br/>
one. I don&#39;t know why, but I do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to wonder if there&#39;s something about the six year age <br/>
gap.  It&#39;s been on my mind for a while.  My 16 year old is always <br/>
bickering and competing with my 10 year old.  Hmmm...<br/>

I have had these conversations with my children several times.  They <br/>
are 18, 18, 16, 16, 14, 12 and 10.  Despite my attempts they are <br/>
still rude to each other, mean to be mean and just plain get on each <br/>
other&#39;s nerves.  It&#39;s a little ridiculous in my perspective.  I&#39;ve <br/>
done the whole, &quot;Stop it, and don&#39;t do it again&quot; routine.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be working for me.  Before I got to that stage I did try to <br/>
let them handle it on their own.  I tried that for a long time.  <br/>
Recently I have resorted to me saying something because it just makes <br/>
me sick to hear the rudeness.  We have the &quot;Be kind&quot; principle, and <br/>
it&#39;s great in theory, but no one takes it seriously.  It&#39;s very <br/>
frustrating...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in hearing how others make this work in their home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843582967">I hear you point and though this may be valid in some families I can tell you <br/>
its not how my unschooling family functions. The baby is 3 months and nursing <br/>
so he is often connected to me. I may not move as fast but I go, do and move <br/>
the baby isn&#39;t the only one getting the attention. <br/>
<br/>
 All I can say is that ive had 1, 2 and 3 kids and they all had their <br/>
challenges esp 1 being so alone.  I do not attend playgroups bc I haven&#39;t found one <br/>
that isn&#39;t full of traditional HS moms/beleifs that I dont agree with like <br/>
spanking and socialization which isn&#39;t an issue for us.<br/>
<br/>
I love my family and love having four kids so please dont get me wrong &lt; I <br/>
was looking for a solution to the picking and I know &quot;most&quot; familles have seen <br/>
it on one end or another. It could be worse I just dont want it to get there. I <br/>
dont agree with it and I do intervene when it happens and I do talk to them <br/>
about it. Its not ignored and STOP IT works BUT I dont want to have to keep <br/>
saying STOP IT I dont want to need to get to that point. <br/>
<br/>
My son is 12 (13 in sept&gt;). He has a group of 12 friends in the neighborhood. <br/>
He comes and goes as he pleases and is not asked to care for the younger ones <br/>
all I ask is that he checks in.<br/>
<br/>
I dont feel as if im not meeting their needs I know I am. If it was rare that <br/>
children pick and fight id feel like dirt but the fact is that I have four <br/>
kids ages 3 mo to 12 and in such a mix its bound to happen. Im trying find a <br/>
communication that helps us all live more peaceful with a lil less.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Some may feel we have to much going on <br/>
but there is a lota love in our home. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.&quot; LLD<br/>

other child&#39;s needs must diminish. I think the older child&#39;s needs <br/>
must actually increase due to the new challenges. Relying on others <br/>
to continue to help meet the needs of the older children becomes <br/>
necessary. Relying on the children to try to meet each other&#39;s needs <br/>
isn&#39;t facilitating. They still need adults to listen and help, they <br/>
are telling you so themselves.<br/>

Despite  my attempts they are <br/>
still rude to each other, mean to be mean and just  plain get on each <br/>
other&#39;s nerves.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
WHY do they do it? I mean, there are always times when someone will get on  <br/>
our nerves. Duncan was jumping up and down on my last nerve yesterday. BUT he  <br/>
didn&#39;t MEAN to. He was just being Duncan, and I had had a hard day. He would  <br/>
never so it just to BE mean to me. Why is it allowed? And why would they WANT <br/>
to  hurt each other?<br/>

seem to be working for  me.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For me, it&#39;s a one time deal. I mean: don&#39;t do it again PERIOD. Do your  <br/>
children understand what you&#39;re saying? I don&#39;t mean stop just this time and  next <br/>
time it&#39;s fine. I mean stop being mean to your sibling forever!<br/>

This may be the key. I&#39;m responsible for each child&#39;s safety. I wouldn&#39;t  let <br/>
them &quot;handle it on their own&quot;. The bigger, stronger, older, or smarter  kid <br/>
would always win out. I wouldn&#39;t put either of them in that position.<br/>

I&#39;m  beginning to wonder if there&#39;s something about the six year age <br/>

I was about to say the same thing.  Mine are 12 and 4 and they fight  just as <br/>

<br/>
This is exactly our theory, but it doesn&#39;t stop the bickering any.  If you<br/>
look in their eyes when they&#39;re doing it, it&#39;s almost as if they think it&#39;s<br/>
fun.  More annoying to me than them.  My 5 year old WON&#39;T leave it alone and<br/>
my three year old searches through the house looking for the 5 year old when<br/>
they&#39;re not in the same room.  They love to be with each other.<br/>
   I don&#39;t remember wanting my mom to step in when I was little. I had 4<br/>
older brothers so maybe I thought it was a lost cause.  My mom couldn&#39;t<br/>
possibly have that many eyes.  I don&#39;t remember.  I just know that NOW we<br/>
laugh about it and I don&#39;t hold any ill will towards any of them for what<br/>
they did.<br/>
   Your lucky that they quite when you ask them to, but I still wonder what<br/>
would happen if they didn&#39;t quit.  My 5 year old is VERY energetic/spirited<br/>
and doesn&#39;t seem to get that &quot;stop it&quot; philosophy.  Lately I have been<br/>
telling him that it is my job to keep this family safe and if he&#39;s not going<br/>
to help me do that than he&#39;s going to need to leave the room or find a<br/>
different activity elsewhere.  It&#39;s the only thing that I have found to<br/>
break the cycle of bickering, and only that is for a short time....<br/>

  Kelly,<br/>
  The older they are the more creative they  get about the picking.  Did<br/>
  you have siblings?  I had four older  brothers and I see my most annoying<br/>
  brother in my daughter sometimes.   You also need to consider that<br/>
sometimes<br/>
  they annoy each other and then  seem to have fun with it all.  So I guess<br/>
my<br/>
  question to you is; what  if STOP IT isn&#39;t enough?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have a brother. Fifteen months younger. We fought like cats and<br/>
dogs---no,<br/>
  worse! My dogs and cats get along wonderfully! My brother and I still  get<br/>
by<br/>
  just fine without seeing each other or speaking for months/years at a<br/>
time.<br/>
  I know all about bickering.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d put a stop to ALL annoyances. ALL. I hated it then and I hate it now.<br/>
  It&#39;s NOT fun if everybody&#39;s not playing, and it&#39;s not a game if someone&#39;s<br/>
not<br/>
  having fun. It&#39;s YOUR job to keep it from happening. Didn&#39;t you ever wish<br/>
your<br/>
  mother would just step in and stop them?<br/>
<br/>
  I would sit them down and tell them how I felt about it. Seriously. And<br/>
tell<br/>
  them how I felt when Johnny did things to me. How he may have felt when I<br/>
  did things to him (always in retaliation). I&#39;d tell them how I feel now<br/>
when I<br/>
  see them doing things to hurt or annoy or insult or *anything* their<br/>
siblings.<br/>
  I&#39;d tell them it WILL not happen anymore because that is my job: to<br/>
protect<br/>
  each  and every one of them----even if it&#39;s from the other sibling. It<br/>
WILL<br/>
  NOT happen  anymore. Stop it and Don&#39;t do it again.<br/>
<br/>
  We have a principle here: Be Kind.   If what you&#39;re doing is  unkind----in<br/>
  ANY way---stop what you&#39;re doing NOW. That includes me and Ben as  well.<br/>
<br/>
  We don&#39;t have any problems with it in our famiily, but when friends come<br/>
  over, it&#39;s common. I hate having siblings visit, but that happens a lot<br/>
  (Duncan&#39;s best friends are two sets of siblings; they come in pairs) .<br/>
They tease and<br/>
  annoy and are often just plain mean. I put a stop to that as soon  as I<br/>
see<br/>
  it---and lately before it even starts, because I know it&#39;s coming: I  try<br/>
to<br/>
  head it off at the pass.<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t do it here; I&#39;ll take you home. One chance and one chance only.<br/>
Don&#39;t<br/>
  do it.<br/>
<br/>
  I lived with it as a child---and purposefully have two &quot;onlies&quot;, eight<br/>
years<br/>
  apart. I couldn&#39;t handle that meaness. I used to tell Ben (my  husband)<br/>
that<br/>
  HE was the thirty-three year old and that he should act like the  adult<br/>
when<br/>
  he and Cameron used to get into it. I told Cameron, when he was 13,  to<br/>
  remember that Duncan was just five. Cameron (and Ben) had more control<br/>
over their<br/>
  emotions and actions than the littler one. Be responsible for  your<br/>
actions.<br/>
  Quit being mean. Just quit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817498205">Another eye-opening book is Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary <br/>
Sheedy Kurcinka. It helped me to learn how to communicate about my <br/>
very physical child&#39;s needs with him. It describes the very different <br/>
temperments people have and how their individual needs can be <br/>
positively channeled to avoid frustrations for all around. The <br/>
authors provide vocabulary and perspectives to share with each other <br/>
about our needs. It is a very practical &quot;how to&quot; book with examples <br/>
and suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608487556">Is this a &quot;keep the family safe&quot; issue or you don&#39;t like the way they <br/>
are choosing to have fun? It is important for them to be able to set <br/>
limits for themselves and this is an opportunity for them to practice <br/>
in a safe place. It is a game until one chooses to stop it. THEN it <br/>
needs to stop. <br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s three year old was playing &quot;trolls&quot; (some made up &quot;get-<br/>
you&quot; type game) with his older brothers. They were all having fun. It <br/>
was getting rowdy so she told them to stop. Why? They were all <br/>
disappointed. She said she didn&#39;t want it to go any further. Perhaps <br/>
wanting the behavior to stop is actually yourself as a child wanting <br/>
someone to rescue you. That is your history and baggage. <br/>
<br/>
BUT, you ARE there for them. There is no &quot;lost cause&quot; for them IF <br/>
they ask for your help. Their life is different. It sounds like you <br/>
are sensitive to this fear of it going too far and it becoming <br/>
a &quot;lost cause&quot;. Perhaps, use that sensitivity for listening to them <br/>
rather than stepping in unless it IS a family safety issue. Share <br/>
your experiences and feeling about the issues of not feeling heard. <br/>
Reassure them that you are available when they ask for help. Perhaps <br/>
you could share some phrases on how to ask for the play to be &#39;more <br/>
gentle&#39;, &#39;slow down&#39; or &#39;quit&#39;, &#39;it&#39;s not fun&#39;, &#39;I want to stop&#39;, IF <br/>
THEY WANT IT TO CHANGE. These are empowering tools that can be <br/>
carried with them even when you are not with them directly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t interfere when my son is playing. I try to empower him to use <br/>
his words, leave the situation or ask for help. He knows that I will <br/>
be available whenever he needs me. I want to be a trusted advisor and <br/>
resource, not the one in charge. <br/>

   It definitely is not my issue or some residual hurt left over from my<br/>
childhood coming in to play here.  I don&#39;t recall any situations with my<br/>
brothers that would cause me to be paranoid about their bickering situation.<br/>
I ONLY interfere when there is pain whether it be physical or mental<br/>
involved.  I do everything that you suggested in your post.  It is not my<br/>
misinterpretation of events.  I have read the Spirited Child and it had some<br/>
helpful suggestions. I definitely know the difference between play and<br/>
cruelty.  Sometimes siblings are cruel to each other, heck sometimes<br/>
siblings don&#39;t even like each other.  My choice is to remove the aggressor<br/>
from the situation and to do everything that I can to avoid the conflict if<br/>
I see it arising.  This is a family plan that has been talked about with the<br/>
kids and enforced every time.  Still it continues.  I have seen very little<br/>
progress toward everyone walking around in total peace and happiness.  All I<br/>
expect is that everyone in this family is safe to be the person they can be<br/>
without someone picking on them relentlessly or smacking them in the head<br/>
when they don&#39;t like what they have to say.<br/>
  My point about the lost cause was that I don&#39;t remember feeling like I<br/>
needed help to stop my brothers.  It (the picking) just didn&#39;t seem so bad.<br/>
I guess I was musing about how I might have felt before I remember existing<br/>
in this world.  You know those lost memories of childhood.  My brothers<br/>
picked on me I picked plenty back and my mother would intervene only if it<br/>
was getting serious, which it practically never did.  My parents were such a<br/>
wreck that I think my brothers and I just bonded better than most other<br/>
siblings did.  We made each other laugh I guess.  Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>
confusing to me about my own children bickering.  They don&#39;t laugh so much<br/>
as scream and get frustrated.<br/>
    My theory is time will work this out.  I will try different things and<br/>
sometimes they&#39;ll work and sometimes they won&#39;t.<br/>

  Is this a &quot;keep the family safe&quot; issue or you don&#39;t like the way they<br/>
  are choosing to have fun? It is important for them to be able to set<br/>
  limits for themselves and this is an opportunity for them to practice<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476252862">Okay, I don&#39;t know if this will help at all, but I find myself <br/>
wondering what the older kids think of the younger kids--at a deep <br/>
level...like do they see them as the same species?!<br/>
<br/>
I noticed today that while my 1.5 y o dd has taken a big step forward <br/>
in communicating with actual words, my 3.5 y o ds hasn&#39;t noticed that <br/>
she&#39;s trying to talk to him. He claims she can only say a few words. <br/>
I mentioned something about her being a toddler and he was suprised <br/>
that she&#39;s not a baby anymore. He knows she listens to him--he&#39;s <br/>
always aware of audience members, lol! <br/>
<br/>
Anywho, just wondering outloud about how they might see the younger <br/>
ones differently. Mikey is a great conversationalist with everyone <br/>
else, so I know he&#39;ll eventually notice she&#39;s talking to him, but <br/>
right now, he thinks he talks to her and she can&#39;t talk back...and <br/>
I&#39;m sure that has some influence on their relationship. Eek, esp. <br/>
when she isn&#39;t being heard and then gets mad...<br/>

<br/>
All of our day is not fighting and endless squabbles.  You are just getting<br/>
the worse case scenario at least from me.  In reality though, My daughter<br/>
REALLY wanted a little sister and she got 3 brothers instead.  This has<br/>
really annoyed her, but what she doesn&#39;t realize is that a baby sister would<br/>
have been the same way.  Many siblings don&#39;t really get along in the younger<br/>
years due to developmental differences and the lack of understanding that<br/>
they actually have developmental differences.  (Dana from Montana is<br/>
certainly the exception not the rule - she has great kids by the sounds of<br/>
it which never fight- lucky)<br/>
So, in regards to feelings when the new baby actually gets here; yes we did<br/>
see a big change with Priscilla.  She was really great towards her brother&#39;s<br/>
when they were infants, but once they became mobile and opinionated she<br/>
began not to like it so much.  However, she did ask me the other day if I<br/>
would have another baby...Hmmmm  - Go figure.<br/>

Sibling squabbles definitely happen.  But I have been wanting to post  again <br/>
and say that it&#39;s NOT ALL the time.  As a matter of fact, I  think it&#39;s neat <br/>
how my boys can sense when it&#39;s really important to me that they  get along, <br/>
like if I&#39;m really tired (I work night shift).  And it&#39;s sweet  when Nat 12 <br/>
cooks lunch for Joel 4, or reads him a bedtime story.  And they  do play together <br/>
even with the age difference, I guess if they ignored each  other they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have anything to fight about.  I&#39;m very glad that they  have each other.  <br/>
I&#39;ve actually been lobbying dh for one more (so far  unsuccessfully). &#39;<br/>
 <br/>
I was an only child until I was twelve, and with that big of an age  <br/>
difference I felt more like another mother to my sister than a sister.  I  wanted my <br/>
two to be closer then they are but this is just how it worked  out.  And I <br/>
guess it is working out:-) They do love each other.  <br/>
