<div id="ygrps-yiv-509170418">Well, I have a 6, 4, and 1 year old and less energy<br/>
than most people. Trips to the kids&#39; museum and things<br/>
like that have to be on a day when my husband is home<br/>
from work.<br/>
<br/>
I am very very lucky that I have an unschooler friend<br/>
who takes my two oldest for a day almost every week.<br/>
They run errands together, hang out at her house, go<br/>
to the pool, have lunch at Chik-Fil-A. So they have a<br/>
great time, and I get to spend time with the baby,<br/>
relax a bit, and catch up on laundry and bill-paying.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bit of a challenge. For example, a new place<br/>
opened up called The Coffee Park, with a play area for<br/>
kids. I wanted to go, but was told my 6 year old could<br/>
not enter the play area. Okay ... so I guess we won&#39;t<br/>
go at all then.<br/>
<br/>
We go to a Bible Study every Wednesday morning. They<br/>
don&#39;t have classes for kids over five. They&#39;re letting<br/>
my six year old go to her sister&#39;s class this year,<br/>
which seems to be working okay for everyone, but next<br/>
year we&#39;ll have to find another option.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the type of person who would love to stay home,<br/>
completely alone, for 2-3 days straight and just read<br/>
and cross-stitch and scrapbook and play the piano. But<br/>
since I&#39;m NOT completely alone, it helps to get out<br/>
pretty much every day. <br/>
<br/>
I often worry that I&#39;m not &quot;doing enough.&quot; Not enough<br/>
other kids around as playmates, not enough craft<br/>
projects, not enough great outings, not enough cakes<br/>
shaped like pumpkins ... but ya know, they probably<br/>
are pretty happy to play together and go to the park<br/>
here and there, and read aloud with me, and watch TV,<br/>
and whatever. Yesterday evening my four year old had a<br/>
ball because she suddenly asked to scrub all the<br/>
dinner dishes and pots. It was great!<br/>
<br/>
When I had only two kids, I used to walk A LOT with<br/>
the double stroller ... to Target, the library, the<br/>
post office, whatever. Unfortunately that is hard for<br/>
me to do with three kids. The six year old is too big<br/>
for a stroller, but also too little to walk for three<br/>
miles.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818987096">Hey Jenny,<br/>
  I relate to a lot of what you say... feel like I&#39;m not doing enough with them (the kids) - I have a daughter 5, and a daughter 1.5 (also stepdaughter 11, some of the time with us).  I have so much to do and never enough time to do it.  Plus, we are out here on this sandbar and haven&#39;t found any unschoolers at all.  It can be isolating.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m glad to hear you have that &quot;unschooling friend&quot; to support you. <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for your post!<br/>
  Janna<br/>
