<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365090378">Evening all,<br/>
Ok so I am still new to all of this.  To sum up the situation we are <br/>
a military family and my husband and I were raised in the deep <br/>
south.  We live near my family at the moment and my parents have <br/>
always had a hand per say in helping with the kids when we are over <br/>
there.  In the past I&#39;ve never had a problem with it.........ok I&#39;m <br/>
jumping the gun sorry.  My dh is gone a lot, in fact he is on the <br/>
other side of the country andhas been since the end of Dec.  We <br/>
pulled our son (who just turned 6 in Jan) out of public school back <br/>
during the holidays.  So this whole home/unschooling thing has <br/>
transpired since dh has been gone.  Now he comes back in 10 days.  I <br/>
have been keeping him abreast of all the changes in the family <br/>
dynamics.  See I realized that we were very demanding and controlling <br/>
of our kids (our dd is 3) and I was feeling like a tyrant always <br/>
screaming at the kids.  Not to mention everyone in the family always <br/>
seemed completely stressed out and miserable!  So things have done a <br/>
complete 180 here at home and I love the difference in our family.  I <br/>
truly believe that to unschool is the best decision for our family.<br/>
Ok now on to my questions/problems........see when dh is gone we are <br/>
over at my parents house maybe 2-4 days a week.  After I explained <br/>
how my family talks to each other, how it&#39;s all about respect (both <br/>
ways), and how I don&#39;t want us to raise our voices at the kids all <br/>
was going well.  Then today the kids stayed over at my parents house <br/>
for the day and when I picked them up my son said something that <br/>
really bothered me....&quot;Mimi told me that there are snakes and spiders <br/>
behind her flower bushes that will eat me!!!&quot;  He was truly worried <br/>
and rightly so.  I asked my step-mom why she said this and was told <br/>
because he wouldn&#39;t stay from behind them and kept asking why should <br/>
I?  She got frustrated that he was questioning her so she told him <br/>
this story.  I explained to ds that he can not go back there bc Mimi <br/>
doesn&#39;t want him trampling through her garden.  &quot;Oh&quot; he said and then <br/>
apologized to Mimi for doing it.  Yes I did explain to him that <br/>
Mimi&#39;s story was jut that lol  So how do I handle this without <br/>
upsetting my parents???  I have learned to stand up to my Dad about <br/>
the whole &quot;non traditional&quot; learning we do but I don&#39;t want my kids <br/>
to be confused by what is going on &quot;discipline&quot; wise.  Any <br/>
suggestions?????<br/>
Also since dh IS coming home in less than 2 weeks how do him and I <br/>
handle (what I know i going to be) a major culture shock for him??  <br/>
He is very much a &quot;do what I say bc I said so&quot; type of person.  He <br/>
gets frustrated when the kids would ask &quot;to many questions&quot; and I <br/>
used to as well.  I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s a good thing and I encourage <br/>
both kids to ask questions all the time.  I always tell the kids &quot;If <br/>
you are told something or if something doesn&#39;t make sense to you then <br/>
please ask questions baby.&quot;  Anyone have to deal with this before?  <br/>
DH is totally on board with all of this bc he has noticed a <br/>
difference in the kids over the phone, for the better, so he <br/>
says &quot;you&#39;re on to something and I like the were it&#39;s going :)&quot;  I <br/>
jut don&#39;t want to make the homecoming adjustment anymore difficult <br/>
than it already will be.<br/>
Sorry everyone I realize this was a lot longer than I thought it <br/>
would be :p  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, in advance, for all of your help,<br/>
Christian</div>

Well, it sounds as if he&#39;s on board philosophically. He just needs to <br/>
figure out how to do it practically (which is the harder thing!).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask him to take a deep breath before he says anything. Think <br/>
*just* a second (during that breath) whether he would speak like that <br/>
to you or his best friend or his CO. If not, then it&#39;s not the way to <br/>
speak to his kids either.<br/>
<br/>
Know that it IS possible! &lt;g&gt; Ben, my husband, went to the Citadel, <br/>
retired from the Air Force, and is now a LtCol in the Air National <br/>
Guard. Talk about controlling! &lt;bwg&gt; He&#39;s got it now!<br/>
<br/>
You can ask him to join the dads&#39; yahoogroups:<br/>

It&#39;s not a very active list, but the guys will answer any question <br/>
posed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re back in the South? Have you considered the Live and <br/>
Learn Unschooling Conference in Asheville, NC this September?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>
<br/>
A great long weekend where you all can see hundreds and hundreds of <br/>
other unschooling families on the journey. The best part is watching, <br/>
talking with, and interacting with the teens and young adults---and <br/>
seeing that they are whole and respectful and trustworthy! And sooo <br/>
flippin&#39; COOL! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
he is on board but i think he just wants to see it in action per say <br/>
lol.............*just* breath that&#39;s a great suggestion <br/>
thanks :).........i&#39;ll check out the conference thank you but that is <br/>
right about the time we may be heading to iowa so i don&#39;t know.  the <br/>
funny thing is that my dh and i met a young man (he was 17) and his <br/>
sister (14) on black friday at circuit city and they were both <br/>
unschooled growing up and dh and i were just thoroughly impressed by <br/>
these children.  they were so open minded, polite and caring and <br/>
bright young people!  they were just beaming with pride about their <br/>
family and it seemed like their family.  i wanted that!  dh and i <br/>
always said that we wanted better and more loving than our home life <br/>
was growing up (oh don&#39;t get me wrong mine wasn&#39;t that bad).  these <br/>
kids were so cool and through them i met a local group of unschoolers <br/>
and they are ALL amazing people.  so i guess what i am getting at is <br/>
that conference might be a great thing for us all :D<br/>
<br/>
thank you so much,<br/>

<br/>
You could try saying something like, &quot;Yeah, I did turn out fine.  There are lots of things about your parenting that I really appreciate (specify).  At the same time, there are things I&#39;d like to try doing differently.  I bet you didn&#39;t parent me exactly the way Grandma and Grandpa raised you!  I&#39;m looking for the things that help my family to be the best they can be, and I really find that the children are so much more helpful, cooperative, joyful (whatever your dad will most identify with:-) since we&#39;ve started doing X.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Easier for me to type than to say, I&#39;m sure:-)  But also remember, your Dad and Step-mom have 20-40 years more ingrained patterns than you do even.  It&#39;s a learning curve and they&#39;re going to fall back on their old behaviors when they don&#39;t know what else to do.  Depending on how concerned you are, it may mean not leaving your kids (or at least not more than one at a time) alone with them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My mother told me the same thing about spankings. &quot;You turned out just <br/>
fine!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Crap.<br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to be better than just fine. Lying to them will <br/>
encourage their lying to you. What do they suggest you do when the kids <br/>
lie back? Beat &#39;em?<br/>
<br/>
We parent by modelling as much as can. If they see me lie or hit them, <br/>
what&#39;s stopping them from doing the same? And what good comes out of <br/>
it? *WHY* would you *want* to lie to or hit a child???<br/>
<br/>
So, in his opinion, upsetting your mother is a bigger wrong than <br/>
upsetting a CHILD?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d be upsetting her a LOT then.<br/>
