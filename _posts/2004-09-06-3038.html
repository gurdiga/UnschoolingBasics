<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073604374">This is an old thread but having just returned from 2004 Live and <br/>
Learn, I just wanted to bring it up again. . . . <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My son, Adrian, is 10. He has always been like this. He&#39;s much <br/>
more content to play by himself or with one or two other friends. <br/>
That&#39;s about it. It took my until this year to figure out the whole <br/>
one or two friend thing. It&#39;s just his personality. He told me just a<br/>
couple of weeks ago that he does not like parties. I don&#39;t know why<br/>
I didn&#39;t figure it out sooner, but the signs were there. At least<br/>
he&#39;s in tune with himself enough to know. Large groups of people<br/>
just stress him out.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to not fret over it. Let your son lead the way. He<br/>
knows where his comfort level is. It used to really bother me that<br/>
Adrian wasn&#39;t more active in groups, but it&#39;s just not his bag. I&#39;m<br/>
okay with that now. I should have learned from myself. Once I paid<br/>
attention I realized that I&#39;m very similar to his personality, just<br/>
not quite as extreme. BUT, I don&#39;t like parties either...  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

The part that jumped out at me was this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  At least he&#39;s in tune with himself enough to know.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the beauty of unschooling.  Here is a 10yo who is in tune <br/>
with himself enough to know.<br/>
<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t be in tune if his Mom made his choices about<br/>
socializing, (or TV or math or chores . . . .)<br/>
<br/>
Lucky kid - that.  In tune with himself at 10.<br/>

NOT being in tune with herself was affecting her relationships</div>
