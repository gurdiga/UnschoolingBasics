<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830552716">I&#39;m the mother of five children aged 2 months up to age 7.  We <br/>
homeschool and are quite unschoolerish.  My 7 year old dd has <br/>
asperger&#39;s  (a genius) and the 2 month old is legally blind.  The <br/>
ones in the middle have the easier issues of food allergies and near-<br/>
sightedness.  <br/>
<br/>
In the preschool years I have witnessed my children learn far more <br/>
than their actual preschooled (meaning they go to preschool) peers.  <br/>
My 4 year old ds could pass kindergarten math even though I have <br/>
avoided teaching him anything.  He has also recently asked to read <br/>
(previous;y not even knowing the alphabet) and he&#39;s doing great at <br/>
reading lessons.  My second child is one of those high achievers who <br/>
always wants to be first and therefore learned to read by age 4.  <br/>
People think I&#39;m some sort of rigorous homeschooler to have my youg <br/>
kids reading and doing math.  That&#39;s all well and good, but as they <br/>
enter school-age they just want to play or color.  My Early reading <br/>
child is now 5 and hasn&#39;t seemed t progress in her reading skills.  <br/>
She still reads as fast as she can, mumbling through the big words <br/>
and skipping the small one so that her comprehension is pretty low.  <br/>
My 7 year old just wants to play outside and color pictures.  I worry <br/>
about my 7 year old who is highly creative.  I&#39;m sure she will go far <br/>
with her artistic talents, but she is also highly creative with her <br/>
spelling.  She is an avid reader.  She demonstrated today a magic <br/>
trick she read about in a book.  Will reading enough really teach her <br/>
how to spell?  Can we do nothing in particular and still have my kids <br/>
do well on those college entrance tests?  Will it really be easy to <br/>
catch up on history, science, and math when the children are high <br/>
school age?  How will they ever learn to write the different types of <br/>
essays so that they can be succesful in college?  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone homeschool a special needs kids such as one who is blind?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone unschool a large family?<br/>
<br/>
Do you lead your children in any way or just let them do whatever <br/>
they want all the time?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone unschool until a certain age such as 12 and then change <br/>
over to something more classical?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will help you understand naturally learning if you see that he was  <br/>
developmentally ready to understand the written word and that&#39;s what  <br/>
drove him to figure our reading *not* the other  way around.<br/>
<br/>
All the effort in the world won&#39;t get a child to read who isn&#39;t  <br/>
developmentally ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
Development isn&#39;t something that the child or parents or teachers can  <br/>
speed up. It just happens when the body&#39;s biology causes it to  <br/>
happen. Like a growth spurt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s all well and good, but as they<br/>
&gt; enter school-age they just want to play or color.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Playing is how kids make sense of the world. Though they were doing  <br/>
what looked academic, what looked like something they&#39;d be made to do  <br/>
in school, they were still playing. Kids need support in exploring  <br/>
what interests *them* not in pursuing what makes parents comfortable  <br/>
or proud. That can be a hard part of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My Early reading<br/>
&gt; child is now 5 and hasn&#39;t seemed t progress in her reading skills.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the most helpful things someone attempting unschooling can do  <br/>
is look at the delight their child is finding in what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
and not even look at school.<br/>
<br/>
Live as though school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
If school didn&#39;t exist, would you be worried about progress? And who  <br/>
would be determining what is progress?<br/>
<br/>
It feels good to have kids who are shining stars against some  <br/>
standard. It feels like an indication of how well we&#39;re doing as  <br/>
parents. But if that standard isn&#39;t useful for the child, then we do  <br/>
our children way more harm than good.<br/>
<br/>
While schools want every child reading independently by 4th grade no  <br/>
child needs to read by 4th grade in order to be a better 9 yo. What  <br/>
they need to be the best *person* they are is access to what  <br/>
interests them, access to potential new interests, a supportive  <br/>
environment and parents who have their own passions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sure she will go far<br/>
&gt; with her artistic talents,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if she doesn&#39;t live up to your expectation and vision of her?  <br/>
What if she decides to be an auto mechanic?<br/>
<br/>
(You don&#39;t need to answer. It&#39;s something to think about.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but she is also highly creative with her<br/>
&gt; spelling. ... Will reading enough really teach her<br/>
&gt; how to spell?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not usually. What helps kids spell better is wanting to communicate  <br/>
and *wanting* to spell better. It&#39;s not something you can rush and  <br/>
more than your husband could rush you to figure out how to rebuild a  <br/>
carburetor ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can we do nothing in particular and still have my kids<br/>
&gt; do well on those college entrance tests?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they want to take college entrance exams? ;-) It&#39;s not something  <br/>
that kids need 12 years to prepare for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Will it really be easy to<br/>
&gt; catch up on history, science, and math when the children are high<br/>
&gt; school age?  How will they ever learn to write the different types of<br/>
&gt; essays so that they can be succesful in college?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There aren&#39;t quick answers that will satisfy you while you&#39;re still  <br/>
trying to see learning in school terms. Unschooling approaches  <br/>
learning from a totally different direction. Kids learn what they  <br/>
need to pursue their interests and absorb everything else as a side  <br/>
effect. With school the side effect stuff is stuffed into them in  <br/>
case they need it. If someone is thinking in school terms of how to  <br/>
get all that school stuff in, unschooling doesn&#39;t seem to make much  <br/>
sense. (And yet it works anyway ;-)<br/>

will help you turn your thinking around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you lead your children in any way or just let them do whatever<br/>
&gt; they want all the time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s more that we&#39;re living life together. We&#39;re not putting stuff in  <br/>
front of them that will lead them in a direction we feel would be  <br/>
good for them. We&#39;re helping them find parts of the world we think  <br/>
they&#39;d be interested in exploring. It&#39;s the difference between  <br/>
pushing stuff in and a child reaching out and pulling it in because  <br/>
they find it fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
If you saw a book at the library or a TV show coming up or a favorite  <br/>
personage coming to town that your husband might be interested in,  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t you pick it up, record it or mention it to him? Unschooling  <br/>
is like that except more so since kids aren&#39;t living independently  <br/>
yet. They depend on us to filter out the boring stuff from the  <br/>
interesting stuff and run the interesting stuff by them so they can  <br/>
pick it up or not as interest strikes them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone unschool until a certain age such as 12 and then change<br/>
&gt; over to something more classical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people undoubtedly. But if they do then they don&#39;t trust and  <br/>
don&#39;t understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What you do is up to you. The list is here to help people who want to  <br/>
figure out how to do unschooling, how to figure out how to keep going  <br/>
after age 12 (or 6 or 14 or whatever). Sorry that&#39;s unfortunately  <br/>
sounding rude. What I mean is if someone asks &quot;Do some people learn  <br/>
to knit but go no further than scarves?&quot;, the answer is yes, of  <br/>
course. But the purpose of a knitting list isn&#39;t to help people feel  <br/>
good about stopping at scarves. It&#39;s to help people figure out how to  <br/>
knit! :-)<br/>

<p><small><time>13 Apr 2007, at  3:07pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626100267">i grew up going to public school, then a charter school, started attending<br/>
college at 13, graduated high school at 15, had my first degree by 18, and i<br/>
can&#39;t say i really learned much of anything in school.  i did well in<br/>
school, graduated salutatorian (not valedictorian because of my math<br/>
grades)  even though i only attended a third of the year my junior and<br/>
senior years because i had already covered all of the material on my own<br/>
before i even knew what we were studying...because i liked to read.  like to<br/>
read.  i was a voracious reader from 4 on and i read constantly.  i read<br/>
through every class i had, sometimes hidden and sometimes in the open.  i<br/>
never read a textbook from junior high on.  i read several books every day.<br/>
i would do my required homework without even thinking about it, write<br/>
10-page essays a couple of hours before they were due, and basically from<br/>
8th grade on just showed up for tests and spent the rest of the time in the<br/>
park reading on my own, which i got away with because i was a good kid other<br/>
than my chronic truancy and i always got As and nobody told my parents<br/>
because they knew my family was abusive.  in college, i rarely attended<br/>
classes, just showed up for tests (not even that very often since starting<br/>
my sophomore year most of the tests were online).  i bet i attended less<br/>
than 5% of my classes in college.  i was a double pre-med major, so i always<br/>
went to my labs, because i liked them, but other than that, i never read the<br/>
textbook, rarely went to class.  i did my assignments in advance, often<br/>
before the semester even started, and always got good grades.  in 10th grade<br/>
i had a very excellent business venture of writing essays for students at my<br/>
university for $500-$1000 a pop.  i guaranteed an A or they didn&#39;t have to<br/>
pay me.  i never did one without getting paid.  i&#39;d crank out five to ten<br/>
essays a week.  i gave it up because my parents noticed how much money was<br/>
going into my account and thought i was dealing drugs.  (i&#39;m more ethical<br/>
than this now.)  i&#39;m really not saying this to brag, but to explain that<br/>
it&#39;s because everything i did, everything i knew, i learned from books that<br/>
i read on my own, that i feel confident letting my kids unschool.  i learned<br/>
next to nothing in school.  i guess i learned some basic math skills.  i<br/>
went through higher math because it was necessary in pre-med, but i don&#39;t<br/>
remember an ounce of it.  i can barely subtract well.  and why is that?<br/>
because it BORES me.  it&#39;s extremely difficult for me to learn something i&#39;m<br/>
not interested in, and impossible for me to retain it.  i learned enough to<br/>
pass the tests, and then promptly forgot it...which is EXACTLY what public<br/>
school teaches kids to do with EVERYTHING they &quot;learn.&quot;  i was a lucky one<br/>
because i loved to read and i was voracious for information and knowledge<br/>
about anything and everything that occurred to me to think about.  but i<br/>
think that&#39;s pretty rare amongst kids who are public-schooled.<br/>
<br/>
oh, and everything i know about grammar, spelling, etc., i learned from<br/>
reading.  (this whole not-using-capitals thing is just a quirk, not because<br/>
i don&#39;t know how to use them.  :)  )  from 1st grade on my teachers didn&#39;t<br/>
even bother trying to get me to do reading/spelling worksheets.  i went to<br/>
reading classes with the 6th graders and let them copy off me.  so i<br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry about your daughter.  sounds to me like she knows what she&#39;s<br/>
doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310289838">Bwahahaha! We&#39;re still early in the game, but I consider us a &#39;success story&#39;. If you *want* a <br/>
list of credentials<br/>
1) Two with autism diagnosis<br/>
2) Three more younger ones who *could* get a dx if we thought we needed it, adhd, sad, <br/>
and asd<br/>
3) Food allergies to wheat, corn and milk<br/>
4) seven kids all together<br/>
5) Recovery from five years of school in hell<br/>
<br/>
After two years out of school, I&#39;ve seen so much success in my kids. Perhaps not as <br/>
mainstreamers would see it, but I&#39;ve seen my kids become more confident, self-<br/>
knowledgable, relaxed, and able to participate in life. They can be who they are, and <br/>
succeed at that. If I felt I had to prove anything to mainstream homeschoolers, I&#39;ve seen <br/>
two kids learn to read by themselves, I&#39;ve witnessed five kids figure out multiplication and <br/>
division on their own, and I&#39;ve heard all kinds of wisdom and knowledge concerning arts, <br/>
history, social studies, etc. <br/>
It&#39;s really not as black and white as &#39;leading&#39; the kids vs letting them do &#39;whatever&#39;. Really <br/>
we work together as a team. I am on my toes all the time observing them, being involved, <br/>
keeping an eye out for their interests and their abilities so that I can support them in that <br/>
without them needing to verbalize all needs to me. <br/>
My oldest is 12. He and I just talked recently about preparing for college. He has an <br/>
unschooled friend in his scout patrol who, when he turned 14 decided he wanted to go to <br/>
college and asked his parents to help him prepare for testing and basic classes. He is fairly <br/>
prepared as far as I can observe, in that he&#39;s intelligent, well-read and mature, which <br/>
probably puts him above 3/4 of high school graduates. I&#39;m not going to push any type of <br/>
curriculum or learning that *I* feel is important for adulthood, because I&#39;ve seen all of my <br/>
kids seek out information and be willing to expand on it. I can only imagine that as they <br/>
get older, that knowledge will encompass more of the world than it does now. <br/>
Anyway, nice to see you at the group, it&#39;s really helped me a lot in the past year or two.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have any particular expectations, other than I really hope my<br/>
kids turn out better than my husband.  It isn&#39;t that my husband is a<br/>
terrible person or anything.  He is brilliant in math and sciences,<br/>
but he went to public school and hated everything but math and<br/>
science.  He didn&#39;t do homework except a little in calculus because he<br/>
thought it was fun.  He did really really well on the SAT and yet he<br/>
barely (as in right at 2.0 I believe) graduated from high school.  He<br/>
had no interest in college- except for his math classes and musical<br/>
organizations.  He dropped out of college with no intent to go back. <br/>
It wasn&#39;t until we were married, had a baby, and were living poorly<br/>
off of his walmart income that he decided to go to college.  Still he<br/>
was thinking of how to get a high paying job quickly, so he went into<br/>
computers.  It was five years later that he got a walmart computer<br/>
job.  Two years later and he&#39;s got a computer job with another company<br/>
that doesn&#39;t pay much better and the hours are aweful.  Yet, my<br/>
husband is brilliant!  He wants a better job, earning more money and<br/>
working normal hours so that we can have normal family relationships.<br/>
 (It is very hard to have any kind of together time when he&#39;s asleep<br/>
when I&#39;m awake and vice versa.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I would like my boys to get good educations so that they can go<br/>
into whatever field they want and make enough money to support however<br/>
people are in his family (be it 1 or 12).  I want my daughters to be<br/>
able to have the education they need to do what they want to do in<br/>
life.  I want them to have this education even if they plan to be<br/>
homemakers just like me.  (In case marriage doesn&#39;t happen, fails, or<br/>
their spouse dies, or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all.  If my artistic child wants to be an auto mechanic that is<br/>
fine.  If my performer son wants to be a florist he can go ahead.  I<br/>
just don&#39;t want them stuck in jobs that don&#39;t pay the bills because<br/>
they haven&#39;t got the education or skills for anything better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136359819">I<br/>
just don&#39;t want them stuck in jobs that don&#39;t pay the bills because<br/>
they haven&#39;t got the education or skills for anything better.<br/>
<br/>
this is funny, because my main concern is my kids being stuck in a job just<br/>
because it pays the bills...like my parents.  my dad is brilliant with math,<br/>
science, etc., like a friggin&#39; genius, but he got married very young and<br/>
then had to support me.  so he became a machinist.  sure, he was using math<br/>
on a daily basis, and making excellent money, but he hated his job.  when i<br/>
was almost out of school he cut off his thumb at work, lost his job, and<br/>
basically had a midlife crisis a little early.  he went back to school to<br/>
work in computers because that was what was *hot*, and that&#39;s what he does<br/>
now...and he hates it.  imagine if he had just suffered living in poverty<br/>
for a few years so he could do what he *really* would have loved, like<br/>
architecture or physics.  maybe that sounds selfish, but my husband and i<br/>
lived far, far below the poverty line our first few years of marriage, and<br/>
while it was hard, it was always worth it.  making lots of money is not our<br/>
intent.  in fact, we&#39;re sort of going out of our way NOT to make so much<br/>
money that we have more than we need.  having *just enough* is our goal, and<br/>
we&#39;re very lucky to both be pursuing careers that we absolutely adore, even<br/>
if we won&#39;t make buckets of money doing it, and even if we have to<br/>
struggle.  our kids have never been without clothing, healthy food, a good<br/>
home, and most importantly, happy parents, and that&#39;s all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
besides, nowadays the idea that college equals &quot;a good education&quot; that will<br/>
guarantee a good job and hence good money is really quite outdated.  in<br/>
certain professions, sure.  but i know just as many people who have very<br/>
high degrees who are working at telemarketing companies because there&#39;s just<br/>
no demand for their field.  and i know other people who never even graduated<br/>
from high school who may not be making lots of money but they are doing what<br/>
they love.  there are literally millions of trade schools all over the world<br/>
that teach people of all ages how to do what they love.  i&#39;m attending one<br/>
right now, and wondering why i&#39;m going to be in debt for the next 50 years<br/>
from my pre-med education when i&#39;m pursuing naturopathy now, something much<br/>
more suited to *me* if not widely accepted amongst the &quot;old-schoolers&quot; who<br/>
think it&#39;s not a &quot;real&quot; career.  it took a long time for me to confront the<br/>
idea that having a bunch of letters after my name,and being the recipient of<br/>
ever higher degrees, did not make me a more worthwhile person, just as it<br/>
took my husband a long time to realize that, even though he could have made<br/>
$120,000 a year as a mandarin-speaking chemical engineer, he really wanted<br/>
to be a teacher.  (i remember being ten years old telling my parents, &quot;i&#39;m<br/>
going to be a ph.d&quot;, to which they responded, &quot;in what?&quot;  &quot;i don&#39;t know.  i<br/>
just want to be a ph.d.&quot;  wonder what my focus was?)  more than anything<br/>
else i don&#39;t want my kids to be locked in to *anything* because it seems<br/>
more appopriate to someone else...like my grandparents who said, why not<br/>
nursing school? when i was a student midwife, and who say now, why not going<br/>
back to medical school? now that i&#39;m studying to be a naturopath.  sigh.<br/>

<br/>

those who &quot;objectively&quot; have plenty don&#39;t see or feel that. Schools <br/>
encourage that mentality by rating everything - are you good enough? <br/>
What&#39;s your score? Part of unschooling is stepping away from those <br/>
ratings and comparisons and cultivating a sense of plenty. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a wonderful opportunity for you to connect with them, to fill <br/>
up their &quot;cup of love&quot;, as it were, and support them for Who They <br/>
Are right now. Interests very often come and go and kids (and adults <br/>
too) often learn things in &quot;spurts&quot;. My now 5.5yo went through a <br/>
phase about a year ago where she was drawn to reading and ready to <br/>
do it. Once she could read to her level of understanding, she <br/>
stopped being interested. She&#39;ll read something for information, or <br/>
read a story to another child, but doesn&#39;t read for her own pleasure <br/>
at the moment. Now she&#39;s in the midst of a passion for drawing and <br/>
(since its spring here) mud. If I were to coax her to try to read <br/>
more, she wouldn&#39;t necessarily &quot;progress&quot; - but she would almost <br/>
certainly feel lacking. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 7 year old just wants to play outside and color pictures.<br/>

complex behavior, filled with learning and exploration. Connect with <br/>
her play and *see* what she&#39;s learning and exploring. Same with her <br/>
coloring - is she exploring color? experimenting with materials? <br/>
revelling in the motions and smells? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you lead your children in any way or just let them do whatever <br/>

how they approach different situations, where their strengths and <br/>
passions lie. Based on those observations I may offer a toy or game <br/>
or activity or idea, but its always an offer, never a requirement. <br/>
Observing my kids I can see that &quot;doing what they want&quot; often leads <br/>
them to amazing things that *I* would never have considered on my <br/>
own - like my stepson learning about market fluxuations and exchange <br/>
rates playing a computer game involving dragons and magic. Or my dd <br/>
learning about the structure of DNA molecules from wondering what <br/>

school until this past fall, when he moved in with us and started <br/>
unschooling. He&#39;s 13. Is he &quot;more successful&quot; at home than he was at <br/>
school? He&#39;s a wonderfully introspective young person who enjoys <br/>
learning from other people. At school that was spelled &quot;Disruptive&quot;. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The thing is that my husband is unhappy with his job.  He wants more<br/>
education, but since he needs to support a family of 7 he has to work<br/>
full time and therefore we have no time or money for him to get the<br/>
education he needs and wants.  We already wasted money on some &quot;get<br/>
education quick&quot; scheme that he failed at.  He never got anything out<br/>
of it.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not looking for them to have overabundance.  I don&#39;t want it<br/>
either.  I don&#39;t want my kids to have kids on medicaid (like us) or<br/>
rely on wic as a source of food (they don&#39;t give you enough to live<br/>
on, especially if the kids are allergic to milk and peanuts).  Sure<br/>
penny pinching, living frugally, learning to cook from scratch, and<br/>
cloth diapering are all worthwhile things to learn and experience. <br/>
Even humbling oneself to accept aid for a short time is okay.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want them living bummer lives, being unhappy because they don&#39;t have<br/>
sufficient means to support themselves and/or a family.  Neither do I<br/>
want them to make welfare a way of life.  I also don&#39;t want them<br/>
living off of me (like my younger brother), nor do I want them to<br/>
spend their money unwisely so that they have none (as dh&#39;s siblings do<br/>
and dh would do if he did not have me).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of the things that hampers so many people is a terribly feeling <br/>

hungry and complain every night that they hate beans. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dd has asperger&#39;s.  Her brain is wired differently than others. <br/>
Her play is always quite similar to whatever she did in days past. <br/>
Sge used to play a game she titled &quot;pegasus, pegasus fly away&quot;.  Now<br/>
she plays one called &quot;Peter Pan, Peter Pan fly away&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
what she actually does. She does collect bugs and she will read books<br/>
about them if I get the book from the library.  She never decides she<br/>
wants any sort of book.  She never asks &quot;Why?&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old is one of those competitive children who is really only<br/>
interested in being better than everyone else.  She has no real<br/>
interests of her own.  7 year old is obsessed with Peter Pan, readimg,<br/>
strings, and loves bugs and horses.  She is interested enough that she<br/>
will read books about them if the books are at our house.  5 year old<br/>
will read a book if older sister has read it.  7 year old plays with<br/>
horses (the plastic kind).  5 year old will play horses with her.  The<br/>
only time 5 year old draws the line in doing what older sister does is<br/>
when she plays trains.  Then 5 year old goes and plays dolls with 2<br/>
year old sister.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that with 4 kids aged 2-7 and a small baby with a<br/>
house and an unhelping husband (as well as kids) I just don&#39;t have the<br/>
time to do a whole lot with the kids.  My house is no where near<br/>
spotless either.  In fact others would call it a pig stye.  I&#39;m<br/>
drowning in laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning, everything...  I still<br/>
have Thank You notes to write...  I wish my kids would help out<br/>
without me having to yell at them.  (I don&#39;t like yelling, so they<br/>
don&#39;t help.)<br/>

&gt; or activity or idea, but its always an offer, never a requirement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recently taught them a new card game because they love games and I<br/>
hate having pieces all over the floor.  They love the card game and it<br/>
happens to deal with numbers and which one is more (War).  That is<br/>
okay to do then?  I also taught them a new drawing technique (drawing<br/>
cubes).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason I ask is because A Thomas Jefferson Education seems to do<br/>
that.  I&#39;m still not quite sure because you have to buy their books to<br/>
find out more.  Every time I ask the TJeders a question they tell me<br/>
to read some book or pamphlet which the public library doesn&#39;t own.<br/>
<br/>
I also have issues with family members always wanting updates and<br/>
such.  They tell me I&#39;m ruining my kids just by homeschooling (and<br/>
they all believe I make them do &quot;school&quot; every day too.)  I&#39;m failing<br/>
my dd with asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;m sure my blind son will be at an extreme<br/>
disadvantage too.  Whenever my mother visits she likes to tell the<br/>
kids they need to do their schoolwork before they can play.  (What<br/>
schoolwork?)  Of course, my mom being a teacher only visits when her<br/>
school is on break.  I don&#39;t know why homeschoolers don&#39;t deserve such<br/>
breaks.<br/>

<br/>
 I don&#39;t have any particular expectations, other than I really hope my<br/>
 kids turn out better than my husband. It isn&#39;t that my husband is a<br/>
 terrible person or anything. He is brilliant in math and sciences,<br/>
 but he went to public school and hated everything but math and<br/>
 science. He didn&#39;t do homework except a little in calculus because he<br/>
 thought it was fun. He did really really well on the SAT and yet he<br/>
 barely (as in right at 2.0 I believe) graduated from high school. He<br/>
 had no interest in college- except for his math classes and musical<br/>
 organizations. He dropped out of college with no intent to go back.<br/>
 It wasn&#39;t until we were married, had a baby, and were living poorly<br/>
 off of his walmart income that he decided to go to college. Still he<br/>
 was thinking of how to get a high paying job quickly, so he went into<br/>
 computers. It was five years later that he got a walmart computer<br/>
 job. Two years later and he&#39;s got a computer job with another company<br/>
 that doesn&#39;t pay much better and the hours are aweful. Yet, my<br/>
 husband is brilliant! He wants a better job, earning more money and<br/>
 working normal hours so that we can have normal family relationships.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  He went to school though. He bought into the grades thang. He believed <br/>
what school folks told him.<br/>
<br/>
  He wasn&#39;t thinking at ALL about what he loved. What DOES he love? If <br/>
money were no object, what would he do for fun?<br/>
<br/>
  If you give your children that gift: to know that they can do what <br/>
they love and the money will follow (and it DOES!), they will have all <br/>
they need.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So, I would like my boys to get good educations so that they can go<br/>
 into whatever field they want and make enough money to support however<br/>
 people are in his family (be it 1 or 12). I want my daughters to be<br/>
 able to have the education they need to do what they want to do in<br/>
 life. I want them to have this education even if they plan to be<br/>
 homemakers just like me.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 If you want them to be school-educated, send them to school.<br/>
<br/>
  If you believe in the philosophy of unschooling: that people are <br/>
hard-wired to learn, they will get all that and more.<br/>
<br/>
  But if you don&#39;t believe that, if you think that school is the best <br/>
route for your kids, send them to school. That mentality will sabotage <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 That&#39;s all. If my artistic child wants to be an auto mechanic that is<br/>
 fine. If my performer son wants to be a florist he can go ahead. I<br/>
 just don&#39;t want them stuck in jobs that don&#39;t pay the bills because<br/>
 they haven&#39;t got the education or skills for anything better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Through unschooling, a child learns that he can learn anything at any <br/>
time. He learns that he is NOT stuck---ever. He learns that he can <br/>
master whatever he needs to get what he wants.<br/>

children to school until they are ready for college or trade-school or<br/>
whatever higher education they want.  The trouble is deciding on how<br/>
to homeschool.  I&#39;ve been hanging about on a homeschooling message<br/>
board for years.  When I ask for ideas on how to teach something or<br/>
other people tend to give me some curriculum I ought to use to teach<br/>
my childrem.  One lady is very much against teaching math without a<br/>
curriculum because apparently you have to teach it in a certain order<br/>
so that the child won&#39;t become confused later on.  Many ladies<br/>
recommend looking at the worldbook website to determine what the<br/>
children should be learning in each grade.  One lady is against<br/>
children reading young because it will mess up their eyes.  (I&#39;d hate<br/>
to keep my children from reading when it is something they want,<br/>
though.)  I&#39;m just bombarded with curriculums, structured, life, and<br/>
all of that.  There was an unschooler on this board for about a week<br/>
before she had been attacked to death and decided to leave.  The<br/>
curriculum users have good points and so do the unschoolers.  It is<br/>
difficult to decide.<br/>
<br/>
I might also mention that I&#39;m halfway to being crunchy and, well, I<br/>
want to make my decisions based one what I believe to be right, not<br/>
just because it fits with my newly crunchy life.  (Homeschooling,<br/>
cooking from scratch, breastfeeding, cloth diapering, baby wearing,<br/>
delaying and very selectively vaccinating- perhaps non-vaxing,<br/>
homebirthing, and having a slew of kids...If only I had money I&#39;d go<br/>
organic too.)  So, I am trying to sort out what is right.  Please<br/>
don&#39;t attack me as if I&#39;m anti unschooling.  I am looking for<br/>
information and trying to figure out what is right.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The lady in question would undoubtedly be insulted if she saw this,<br/>
but I have to suggest that while she may be very competent in<br/>
textbook-style arithmetic and balancing her checkbook, I doubt she<br/>
really understands mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
If you view math as learning a series of algorithms (add the first<br/>
column, carry the one, etc.) then she might be right -- everything has<br/>
to be learned in a certain order.  However, that&#39;s not math!  Math is<br/>
playing with value and relationships and patterns and figuring out new<br/>
ways to solve problems.  And that is better learned without a textbook!  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t *have* to add a column of numbers from right to left -- you<br/>
can come up with an equally valid (and actually more sensible)<br/>
algorithm working from left to right.  (More sensible because errors<br/>
are more likely to be with the smaller place values -- an error in the<br/>
ones instead of the thousands:-)  Or you can round up or down in your<br/>
head and then compensate at the end as my kids usually do.  (For<br/>
example -- 53+88=50+90+1.)  You&#39;ll be *amazed* at what your kids will<br/>
figure out for themselves and how they&#39;ll approach math. They may even<br/>
think that having mom call out, &quot;What&#39;s 2/3 of 117?&quot; is a fun way to<br/>
pass the time on a long drive!  (I wasn&#39;t trying to squeeze some math<br/>
in, honest, it was just a desperate attempt to entertain the masses!)<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but my husband is about finished reading to the boys<br/>
and my attention will be needed again:-)<br/>

understand being pleased just to make it month to month, we have nine mouths to feed. <br/>
Believing in abundance is hard if you are eating beans every night. Have you read this <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://largefamilylogistics.lifewithchrist.org/">http://largefamilylogistics.lifewithchrist.org/</a><br/>
While it is a Christian blog, the woman is amazing with recipes for feeding large families <br/>
on a small budget. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dd has asperger&#39;s.  Her brain is wired differently than others. <br/>
&gt; Her play is always quite similar to whatever she did in days past. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son also has aspergers. Can you believe that it does get better? By allowing my son the <br/>
space and time he needed to do the same thing &#39;over and over&#39;, he was able to branch out <br/>
in a way that was comfortable for him. I was there to provide support and help him find <br/>
those little branches. He still tends to immerse himself, and I love it. Now that he&#39;s 12, he&#39;s <br/>
immersed in computer programming. It&#39;s what he loves to do and he *could* support <br/>
himself doing that if he wanted to as an adult. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sge used to play a game she titled &quot;pegasus, pegasus fly away&quot;.  Now<br/>
&gt; she plays one called &quot;Peter Pan, Peter Pan fly away&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; what she actually does. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t know what she does, get out there and play it with her. It may seem tedious, <br/>
but it&#39;s worth the time. It&#39;s worth the energy. Not only are you learning more about her, <br/>
she is learning that you are there for her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She does collect bugs and she will read books<br/>
&gt; about them if I get the book from the library.  She never decides she<br/>
&gt; wants any sort of book.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she reads them if you get them, then that&#39;s great. Keep getting them. As unschoolers it&#39;s <br/>
our job to find those things for them.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 5 year old is one of those competitive children who is really only<br/>

stuff as she goes along that is cool, and she&#39;ll want to stick longer with it. She&#39;s only five <br/>
and still exploring the world. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to admit that with 4 kids aged 2-7 and a small baby with a<br/>
&gt; house and an unhelping husband (as well as kids) I just don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; time to do a whole lot with the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Said in compassion...you DO have the time. We all have 24 hours in the day. Our choice is <br/>
what to do with it. I have seven kids, ages 12 to 17 months. They are all less than two <br/>
years apart. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My house is no where near<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>drop the laundry for a while, use paper dishes, sweep everything under the rug (I just <br/>
heard the funniest story about my MIL actually doing that when my dh was small! I thought <br/>
it was a figure of speech). Forget the thank you notes. A quick phone call saying &quot;You <br/>
know, I was going to write a note to thank you for blahblah, but wanted to take the time <br/>
instead to tell you personally how wonderful blah was.&quot; You could even do it while pushing <br/>
a baby in the swing, or changing laundry loads, or bathing children. If you really want <br/>
paper notes, buy some cards from walmart that say thank you on front, sign your name <br/>
and let it go. You&#39;re tying yourself down with perceived notions of &#39;must&#39;.<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t help.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always say &quot;Emily, I need so much help. Would you mind taking this basket to the laundry <br/>
room?&quot; or &quot;Josh, I am late starting dinner, when you get a break would you chop the <br/>
veggies?&quot; or &quot;Rachel, I&#39;m worried someone might get hurt on the hotwheels, would you <br/>
throw them back in the bin?&quot; or my favorite from today &quot;Sam! Your dirty underwear really <br/>
doesn&#39;t belong in the kitchen floor. Would you find a better place for them?&quot; It&#39;s not all <br/>
day, it&#39;s not constant and it&#39;s always okay for them to say not right now, or i&#39;m busy, or <br/>
something like that. At which point I&#39;ll holler, &quot;I NEED SOME HELP FROM ANYONE <br/>
AVAILABLE! I&#39;M MAKING CHOCOLATE COOKIES!&quot; And we do. and let the rest go. But <br/>
because it&#39;s low key, and I&#39;m not complaining or stressed about it, then they are very <br/>
willing to help. Sam is five, Dan is three, they love to help. I have the cleanest windows <br/>
EVER because they love to help ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have issues with family members always wanting updates and<br/>
&gt; such.  They tell me I&#39;m ruining my kids just by homeschooling (and<br/>
&gt; they all believe I make them do &quot;school&quot; every day too.)  I&#39;m failing<br/>
&gt; my dd with asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;m sure my blind son will be at an extreme<br/>
&gt; disadvantage too.  Whenever my mother visits she likes to tell the<br/>
&gt; kids they need to do their schoolwork before they can play.  (What<br/>
&gt; schoolwork?)  Of course, my mom being a teacher only visits when her<br/>
&gt; school is on break.  I don&#39;t know why homeschoolers don&#39;t deserve such<br/>
&gt; breaks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t let her come over. Put a note on the door saying you&#39;re busy. Make plans to go to <br/>
the park. Go to the library. Tell her the kids are busy learning. She has no right to visit and <br/>
tell the kids what to do. They don&#39;t &#39;deserve&#39; an update, and certainly not details. Leave it <br/>
at we&#39;re doing fine. I learned some time ago to never tell family our struggles, because <br/>
they don&#39;t understand, and don&#39;t care too. They&#39;re stuck in mainstream and won&#39;t let go. <br/>
I&#39;m sorry for them that they are missing out on a terrific life. None of your kids are at a <br/>
disadvantage...unless you insist on seeing it that way.<br/>

he is supporting his family, after all. No mean feat for a family of <br/>
7, especially homeschoolers. Do you let him know on a regular basis <br/>
how much you appreciate that? That&#39;s really really important. He <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I definately know that feeling. I&#39;ve been there. Cultivating a sense <br/>
of abundance is vital, though. Right now, your sense of lack is <br/>
standing between you and your family. Its preventing you from <br/>
discovering alternatives and solutions. Its part of why you aren&#39;t <br/>
connecting with your kids. Its part of why your dh hates his job.<br/>

I&#39;m not trying to point a finger and say &quot;its all your fault&quot; - not <br/>

solutions exist, you won&#39;t look for them. If you don&#39;t believe you <br/>
can understand your 7yo, you won&#39;t connect with her. If you don&#39;t <br/>
believe anything is possible for your son, you will offer him <br/>
barriers, not opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
You sound stuck. At this point, it may take a leap of faith on your <br/>
part to trust that there is enough time, energy, resources, love, <br/>
happiness for each and every member of your family (including <br/>
yourself!). Hopefully some of the stories on this board will help <br/>
you take that leap.<br/>
<br/>
Make yourself a big sign that says &quot;MY FAMILY IS A SUCCESS&quot; and post <br/>
it somewhere you&#39;ll see it a dozen times a day. Start looking for <br/>
ways to let your brilliant, successful family SHINE every day.<br/>

<br/>
I am the mother of nine, two being grown, seven still hanging out <br/>
here. They youngest seven would all qualify is someones book as <br/>
special needs. NOT MINE THOUGH&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We unschool and live life to the fullest each day. We party. <br/>
Sometimes we do it with a chunk of change and sometimes we do it <br/>
broke, but a party can be an afternoon exploring a new park or <br/>
dancing to the radio. <br/>
<br/>
Just FYI I have a seventeen year old daughter, unschooler who is <br/>
going to nursing school this winter. She is currently working as a <br/>
nurses aid and loving being self sufficient.  My fifteen year old <br/>
son plays guitar, plays video games, reads fantasy books and is <br/>
taking some courses. My thirteen year old just hired on to fix an <br/>
old motorhome up to sell. He is a handy capable person, who public <br/>
school put in fulltime special ed. My 12 year old loves gaming and <br/>
drawing. He is currently learning piano and wants to find someone to <br/>
teach him blacksmithing. He got kicked out of first grade, literally.<br/>
<br/>
My eleven year old daughter sings, dances and does art almost all <br/>
day long. That sounds pretty successful.<br/>
<br/>
My eight year old son, who lived in a residential treatment center <br/>
before he became ours is one of the smartest, most talented kids I <br/>
have met. He keeps up every inch with his brothers and sisters. He <br/>
is currently playing on the floor with our dogs, kissing their heads <br/>
and singing them a little song.<br/>
<br/>
My six year old is the most full of love person. She loves animals <br/>
and people. If she would have ever entered school it would have been <br/>
damaging beyond words for her whole self. She lives in imagination <br/>
and delight every second.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I think unschooling is the key to success for us. <br/>

The thing is that my husband is unhappy with his job.  He wants more<br/>
education, but since he needs to support a family of 7 he has to work<br/>
full time and therefore we have no time or money for him to get the<br/>
education he needs and wants.  We already wasted money on some &quot;get<br/>
education quick&quot; scheme that he failed at.  He never got anything out<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;get education&quot;---&quot;quick&quot; or otherwise. It&#39;s a process. And <br/>
it never ends. He&#39;s learning NOW, but maybe he&#39;s not ready to see that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for them to have overabundance.  I don&#39;t want it<br/>
either.  I don&#39;t want my kids to have kids on medicaid (like us) or<br/>
rely on wic as a source of food (they don&#39;t give you enough to live<br/>
on, especially if the kids are allergic to milk and peanuts).  Sure<br/>
penny pinching, living frugally, learning to cook from scratch, and<br/>
cloth diapering are all worthwhile things to learn and experience.<br/>
Even humbling oneself to accept aid for a short time is okay.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want them living bummer lives, being unhappy because they don&#39;t have<br/>
sufficient means to support themselves and/or a family.  Neither do I<br/>
want them to make welfare a way of life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then enable them to see that they need to pursue what they love. Help <br/>
them know that the ability to learn is what will make them marketable.<br/>
<br/>
Show them that you *can* be grateful for even the smallest thing.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your situation---no matter how horrible---it&#39;s not as bad as <br/>
you think. It *could* get worse. Really and truly be grateful for what <br/>
you do have. And I don&#39;t mean that in a &quot;Pursuit of Happyness&quot; way <br/>
(depressing movie, if you ask me!)----but that there are others <br/>
slugging through worse (several families on this list!). Be <br/>
grateful---really.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I also don&#39;t want them living off of me (like my younger brother), nor <br/>
do I want them to<br/>
spend their money unwisely so that they have none (as dh&#39;s siblings do<br/>
and dh would do if he did not have me).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All of you went to school, right?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It is hard to cultivate a sense of plenty when the kids and the dh are<br/>
hungry and complain every night that they hate beans.<br/>

-=-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Many of us understand *exactly* what you&#39;re talking about. But simply <br/>
changing the way *you* approach supper could change the way they <br/>
approach it.<br/>

<br/>
My dd has asperger&#39;s.  Her brain is wired differently than others.<br/>
Her play is always quite similar to whatever she did in days past.<br/>
Sge used to play a game she titled &quot;pegasus, pegasus fly away&quot;.  Now<br/>
she plays one called &quot;Peter Pan, Peter Pan fly away&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
what she actually does. She does collect bugs and she will read books<br/>
about them if I get the book from the library.  She never decides she<br/>
wants any sort of book.  She never asks &quot;Why?&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are so many Aspie kids who are unschooled. Why not ask specific <br/>
questions of parents with Aspie kids?<br/>
<br/>
Get her books---all sorts. She may find others she likes.<br/>
<br/>
Just because she doesn&#39;t *ask* doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not working through <br/>
that in her own mind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old is one of those competitive children who is really only<br/>
interested in being better than everyone else.  She has no real<br/>
interests of her own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
God, I hope you&#39;re not saying that in front her her.<br/>
<br/>
I bet she DOES. Maybe she&#39;s not willing to share them with you for some <br/>
reason. In order to actually BE competitive, she needs to be interested <br/>
in that one thing for at least a little while!<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 7 year old is obsessed with Peter Pan, readimg,<br/>
strings, and loves bugs and horses.  She is interested enough that she<br/>
will read books about them if the books are at our house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe back off the &quot;obsessed&quot; label. Let&#39;s just say she really likes <br/>
Peter Pan.<br/>
<br/>
And if she will read then stock the house with books! What&#39;s the <br/>
problem?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 5 year old will read a book if older sister has read it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
Cool. So she&#39;s interested in books.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
7 year old plays with horses (the plastic kind).  5 year old will play <br/>
horses with her.  The<br/>
only time 5 year old draws the line in doing what older sister does is<br/>
when she plays trains.  Then 5 year old goes and plays dolls with 2<br/>
year old sister.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So she&#39;s also into horses and dolls, but not trains.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that with 4 kids aged 2-7 and a small baby with a<br/>
house and an unhelping husband (as well as kids) I just don&#39;t have the<br/>
time to do a whole lot with the kids.  My house is no where near<br/>
spotless either.  In fact others would call it a pig stye.  I&#39;m<br/>
drowning in laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning, everything...  I still<br/>
have Thank You notes to write...  I wish my kids would help out<br/>
without me having to yell at them.  (I don&#39;t like yelling, so they<br/>
don&#39;t help.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I recently taught them a new card game because they love games and I<br/>
hate having pieces all over the floor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get over that. Seriously. It&#39;s great that they have a new card game, <br/>
but could you have possibly shown them the card game just to show them <br/>
something new and fun and not because of your negative view of game <br/>
pieces???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They love the card game and it happens to deal with numbers and which <br/>
one is more (War).  That is<br/>
okay to do then?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure it&#39;s OK. But it would help your relationship if you did it because <br/>
you wanted to share a fun game, not because it has to do with numbers <br/>
or fewer game pieces on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is because A Thomas Jefferson Education seems to do<br/>
that.  I&#39;m still not quite sure because you have to buy their books to<br/>
find out more.  Every time I ask the TJeders a question they tell me<br/>
to read some book or pamphlet which the public library doesn&#39;t own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of curricula out there available for purchase. No <br/>
one&#39;s selling anything here but a wonderful life with children. We <br/>
won&#39;t make you buy a thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I also have issues with family members always wanting updates and<br/>
such.  They tell me I&#39;m ruining my kids just by homeschooling (and<br/>
they all believe I make them do &quot;school&quot; every day too.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You owe them nothing. They don&#39;t need &quot;updates.&quot; Just tell everyone <br/>
that all is well in your world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m failing my dd with asperger&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How? And, if so, what are you willing to do to change that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m sure my blind son will be at an extreme disadvantage too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure a lot of parents think that, but the blind are AMAZING! <br/>
Blindness is only a disadvantage if he thinks it is. Really, it&#39;s just <br/>
a hindrance to some things. He can do BRILLIANT things! I&#39;ve known many <br/>
blind people (I&#39;ve raised two guide dogs, so we&#39;re active in the <br/>
community.), and they are just wonderful and can do so many different <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Whenever my mother visits she likes to tell the<br/>
kids they need to do their schoolwork before they can play.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANd what do you say back? I&#39;d say, &quot;NO they don&#39;t! Play IS their <br/>
schoolwork! If you&#39;d like to come over and enjoy your grandchildren, <br/>
fine. But don&#39;t tell them or me what they must or muct not do in their <br/>
own house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my mom being a teacher only visits when her school is on <br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I believe I&#39;d be conveniently out of the house on &quot;break&quot; days.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know why homeschoolers don&#39;t deserve such breaks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand this at all. A break from what? What kind of <br/>
break are you looking for? Our whole unschooling lives are one big <br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand unschooling? I mean, other than not pushing a <br/>
curriculum, have you read much about the philosophy? About natural <br/>
learning?<br/>

I would like to make it very clear- I do not intend to send my<br/>
children to school until they are ready for college or trade-school or<br/>
whatever higher education they want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The trouble is deciding on how to homeschool.<br/>
I&#39;ve been hanging about on a homeschooling message<br/>
board for years.  When I ask for ideas on how to teach something or<br/>
other people tend to give me some curriculum I ought to use to teach<br/>
my childrem.  One lady is very much against teaching math without a<br/>
curriculum because apparently you have to teach it in a certain order<br/>
so that the child won&#39;t become confused later on.  Many ladies<br/>
recommend looking at the worldbook website to determine what the<br/>
children should be learning in each grade.  One lady is against<br/>
children reading young because it will mess up their eyes.  (I&#39;d hate<br/>
to keep my children from reading when it is something they want,<br/>
though.)  I&#39;m just bombarded with curriculums, structured, life, and<br/>
all of that.  There was an unschooler on this board for about a week<br/>
before she had been attacked to death and decided to leave.  The<br/>
curriculum users have good points and so do the unschoolers.  It is<br/>
difficult to decide.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What good points did the curriculum users have?<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind. That would bog this list down.<br/>
<br/>
How do *YOU* think people learn best?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I might also mention that I&#39;m halfway to being crunchy and, well, I<br/>
want to make my decisions based one what I believe to be right, not<br/>
just because it fits with my newly crunchy life.  (Homeschooling,<br/>
cooking from scratch, breastfeeding, cloth diapering, baby wearing,<br/>
delaying and very selectively vaccinating- perhaps non-vaxing,<br/>
homebirthing, and having a slew of kids...If only I had money I&#39;d go<br/>
organic too.)  So, I am trying to sort out what is right.  Please<br/>
don&#39;t attack me as if I&#39;m anti unschooling.  I am looking for<br/>
information and trying to figure out what is right.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not crunchy at all, yet I unschool. I can&#39;t think of *anything* <br/>
&quot;righter&quot; than unschooling. It just makes too much sense. I watch my <br/>
sons eagerly learn so many things. (And when my older son was in <br/>
school, I watched him learn to hate to learn---YUCK!) They grow and <br/>
learn---it just happens! It&#39;s natural. It&#39;s organic. It&#39;s how learning <br/>
works!<br/>
<br/>
To keep from being attacked, I will suggest watching how you (a generic <br/>
you, not you specifically) ask questions. Also...seeing your children <br/>
in the best light possible---not &quot;he&#39;s a failure&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s <br/>
lazy&quot;---those kinds of statements tend to ignite this crowd.<br/>

It is hard. We lived that life (and alternatively live it now) for many years. I certainly <br/>
understand being pleased just to make it month to month, we have nine mouths to feed. <br/>
Believing in abundance is hard if you are eating beans every night. Have you read this <br/>

 <br/>
*****  How about homeschooling with what *you* feel is good for your<br/>
family?  Having a rigid box that you need to stay in will not make your<br/>
big family happy all the time.  Having different ressources for<br/>
different kids is what will work for you.  If your blind child wants to<br/>
learn specific things and he needs specific tools, why not make them/<br/>
buy them for him?  If your kids love to read, bring them to the library<br/>
more often.  I have friends who say &quot;I can&#39;t unschool since I&#39;m not<br/>
comfortable doing this or that&quot;, but I know, watching them, that they<br/>
are unschoolers, but they don&#39;t listen to themselves, they listen to<br/>
that stiff box where you can&#39;t get out unless...  One day, they&#39;ll find<br/>
the crack in their box and find out the real unschooler in them :-)  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Live for the simple pleasures of life, and make your children live it<br/>
with you.  Answer their questions, initiate fun stuff.  Make a garden,<br/>
it&#39;ll be food for the family,  a way of having children close by, and<br/>
even find a passion for your 5 yo.  All kids love to play in a garden,<br/>
for some it&#39;s watering the plants, for others it&#39;s watching the carrots<br/>
grow, others it&#39;s picking the ripe veggies, digging and planting,<br/>
collecting seeds.  Different kids.  Make a smell and touch garden for<br/>
your blind child.   Build a tee-pee with branches found on in your yard<br/>
or in a nearby forest.  If all the kids participate, great!  If no-one<br/>
helps make it but they love play in it, the goal is attained too!<br/>
Make *your* life fun, their&#39;s will follow.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646917636">There&#39;s this trend here in Quebec that uses a method for maths that<br/>
start with learning &lt; &gt; =  and then roots, squares, multiplications, and<br/>
them you learn to add and substract.  So, every method has it&#39;s good and<br/>
bad.  It&#39;s like parenting books, you&#39;ll find one for your style whether<br/>
your really unschoolish, or you want one to justify the strap.  There&#39;s<br/>
one for everyone.  Everyone is different and some methods are better for<br/>
some people than another method.  Go with what you feel is good for your<br/>
children.!!!<br/>

The lady in question would undoubtedly be insulted if she saw this,<br/>
but I have to suggest that while she may be very competent in<br/>
textbook-style arithmetic and balancing her checkbook, I doubt she<br/>
really understands mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
If you view math as learning a series of algorithms (add the first<br/>
column, carry the one, etc.) then she might be right -- everything has<br/>
to be learned in a certain order. However, that&#39;s not math! Math is<br/>
playing with value and relationships and patterns and figuring out new<br/>
ways to solve problems. And that is better learned without a textbook<br/>
