<div id="ygrps-yiv-9989902">&quot; Not.... &quot;well, all laws are stupid and they don&#39;t apply to us.&quot;<br/>
This is where we show them the difference between democracy and other<br/>
forms of government... where we show them the prices paid for freedom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Weeelllll.....this is where critical thinking comes into play. Laws<br/>
are not all about protecting people and for the good of the people. A<br/>
lot of laws are about power/control and money.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, our government is not a democratic system. <br/>
And did we really pay some &quot;price for freedom&quot;? England is free as far<br/>
as I can tell. We&#39;d be under English government today if the<br/>
Revolution hadn&#39;t happened, but we&#39;d still be a free country.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just for fun, did you know that George Washington was not the<br/>
first president?  Boy, the lies they told us in school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183005862">Raw milk is only legal in 28 of the 50 states. It&#39;s a damn shame too.<br/>
I remember buying raw milk (both goat and cow) at the local health<br/>
food store in Portland many years ago. <br/>
Then came the huge warning labels, then it disappeared entirely.<br/>
<br/>
In Pensacola, right before we moved, the local health food co-op<br/>
started selling raw milk labeled &quot;for animal consumption only&quot;. So<br/>
folks are finding ways around the laws.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some info. on it, and links to places where you can find raw milk:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.realmilk.com/happening.html">http://www.realmilk.com/happening.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I think these kinds of issues are WAY beyond what government should<br/>
control. It&#39;s my own choice to drink raw milk or not, what business<br/>
does the government have in that? Another law I will ignore at will.<br/>
