<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188369265">I saw a process of unschooling this weekend and it was heartwarming. My 4 d&#39;s- unskilled at sewing -saw the appeal for Katrina dolls from a unschoolers blog. They wanted to make some and gathered all the resources themselves, bought fabric pieces and decided what message to write on each one.  After making 3 by hand, which took all afternoon and the best part of one evening, they decided off their own backs they needed to use my sewing machine and set about working it out. We have had a great weekend sewing and they have learnt skills they had no interest in until this Friday night. After 4 years unschooling you would think I didn&#39; t need stuff like this to see how it works but sewing was such a no,no to them I was amazed.<br/>
