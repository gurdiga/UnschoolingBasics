<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246016332">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re aware of what radical unschooling is.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
include curriculum for a lot of reasons that can be gone into on a new<br/>
thread like the one you&#39;ve started but you could simply do what I did and<br/>
read.  Here:<br/>
<br/>
First things first:  Deschooling-- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a> --<br/>
Deschooling is about relaxing into the unschooling mode after leaving school<br/>
and mostly it involves parents, though children who have been to school seem<br/>
to need it as well.  Just be forewarned that parents seem to need to<br/>
deschool longer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994177549">Hi Josie and Stephanie<br/>
My daughter lizzy is also 15 and left school ayear and a half ago.  At <br/>
first she wanted me to give her assignments and she worked at ALgebra <br/>
from a text.  It was what she was used to so she felt kind of attatched <br/>
to the &quot;school&quot; way of doing things.  After awhile she just slept and <br/>
rested a lot.  Played games on the computer and watched tv.  Things <br/>
that for the most part rested her mind.  The she went to Not back to <br/>
School Camp in Vermont and met over a 100 other unschooling teenagers <br/>
along withthe really cool staff and Grace Llewellen.  During this past <br/>
year she has done so many things.  SHe has happily explored a bunch of <br/>
different things that interest her.  I think the most important thing <br/>
though is she knows herself.  She has a clear idea of what she thinks <br/>
and believes and who she wants to be friends with.  I may not always <br/>
agree with all her decisions but I have peace of mind that she can make <br/>
her own decisions and not be led by anyone she does not respect.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to take a good long break.  Any &quot;catching up&quot; you may <br/>
feel the need for really will take care of itself when you are ready.  <br/>
Do what you want to do not what you think you should do.  If you allow <br/>
yourselves a year to just be free I am very confident you will both be <br/>
better prepared for whatever you choose to do next.  I can&#39;t even begin <br/>
to tell you the changes in Lizzy and myself from ayear ago.  We are <br/>
both more confident and comfortable with ourselves.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660192562">Hey Kelly ...<br/>
   Thanks so much for your kind and knowledgeable words ...I see where your coming from ...its a little confusing to see how it all works after this many years of &quot;schooling&quot;  and doing what the government said I had to do for my kids ....It just seems so wonderful ...cause there are so many useless things kids learn in school ...Stephanie and I are very excited ...and we have talked of many things to do and places to go and things to see and learn ...Only now it will be without fear and torment so she can actually learn something and not just remember it until a bloody test is given ......I know it is going to be hard to get out of the old school habits ...but we are both ready and willing to try ...<br/>
   I will probably be asking alot of trivial questions along the way as well... and i guess after I get going with it it will be as simple as I&#39;ve heard ...I just hope everyone can bare with me during this time ..<br/>
<br/>
   I just want her to be able to live and learn ...and understand that not everyone in the world will make that as difficult as public schooling has through out these years ....She is intelligent and earger to learn ...but its so hard when your fearful of your surroundings ....<br/>
     <br/>
   I suppose right now I am a bit confused on the keeping of a day planner or track of what we have done ....just the how to write it ....I guess ..I have looked around in hopes of finding a example ...but haven&#39;t yet ....We take alot of photos anywhere we go ...so thats a plus there cause I have heard others speak of <br/>
them being a very good way to show and remember ...but just writing it down ...where it makes since to anyone but me is the problem ....I dont want anyone to show up at my door asking for proof and I not have it legible if you know what I mean ....<br/>
   But please know that I do so appreciate any advice or ideas that you or anyone has to offer ....And if anyone has any thing they would like to send me that might get me through this my email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vampyr_mistress1@...">vampyr_mistress1@...</a> ....I look forward to keeping in touch with everyone on here ...thanks again ...Josie and Stephanie<br/>

Most of what is required for documentation depends on where you live.  <br/>
I found what was required in my state on th HSLDA site and then found <br/>
other home schoolers to help me get started.  For me doing a a <br/>
progress report was too hard the first year becuase as I said she just <br/>
needed to rest.  So instead she took the CAT and I sent in the <br/>
results.  This year I found it very easy to write a progress note.  <br/>
First I wrote a list of all the things we did this year and just <br/>
started writing without trying to put it into subject boxes.  I <br/>
suprised myself by writting 2 1/2 pages.  I will send you a copy off <br/>
list just to give you an idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Taking the less trodden path is not always the easier way but is often <br/>
more pleasant.  That&#39;s where most of the flowers are : )<br/>

know<br/>
what I mean ....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For out-of-staters: in SC we are required to keep a daily <br/>
log/planner/journal/blog of the activities and learning that we engage <br/>
in/pursue with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a daytimer i which I write all that we do. A LOT in advance, <br/>
because if I don&#39;t write it down, I&#39;ll forget (like park days or trips <br/>
somewhere or classes we take or whatever). So, it&#39;s an &quot;appointment <br/>
book.&quot; I also write things down *after* the fact, because a lot of <br/>
learning *happens* withOUT an appointment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I write down snippets of conversations that we have---like during a <br/>
movie or in the car. Many people disregard conversations: they are <br/>
probably THE most important activity we engage in as far as our <br/>
learning goes. So, after a political ad, we may discuss the candidates: <br/>
political science. When the puppy ran by with a tampon in her mouth: a <br/>
brief conversation about health & hygiene. &lt;g&gt; Or---recently a history <br/>
moment: &quot;Jim Crow&quot; was mentioned somewhere (probably Family Guy! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
It fueled a 20-30 minute chat about the Civil War and racial tension <br/>
and caste systems abroad and how I remember  (but barely) some of the <br/>
Jim Crow signs and the race riots as a small child (I was born in <br/>
1960)...and all sorts of related things. Chances are that the boys will <br/>
remember that way better than a chapter in a US history book. They may <br/>
not be able to recite a litany of facts, but the *idea* of Jim Crow is <br/>
there---they will make further connections as they learn and grow.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t discount *small* a-ha moments of learning!!! They *count*!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and if you don&#39;t know---look it up! Don&#39;t be shy about not knowing <br/>
an answer! We found out more about Jim Crow Laws by googling it.<br/>
<br/>
In school, kids are often isolated from REAL conversations. They spend <br/>
a LOT of their time *answering* questions---when what they want and <br/>
need is to ASK questions and get good, helpful answers. Often their <br/>
conversation at home revolve around &quot;what&#39;s on the test&quot; schoolwork and <br/>
homework and eating and sleeping and soccer/piano practice. They don&#39;t <br/>
get to *share* and ask/have answered questions that are meaningful *to <br/>
them*.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling allows a LOT of time for that kind of shared learning. It <br/>
allows a LOT of time for questions and ponderings. They&#39;re IMPORTANT. <br/>
Include them in your documentation!<br/>

I just want her to be able to live and learn ...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What a WONDERFUL name for a conference!<br/>
<br/>
www.LiveandLearnCon ference.org<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I suppose right now I am a bit confused on the keeping of a day <br/>
planner or<br/>
track of what we have done ....just the how to write it ....I guess ..I <br/>
have<br/>
looked around in hopes of finding a example ...but haven&#39;t yet ....We <br/>
take alot<br/>
of photos anywhere we go ...so thats a plus there cause I have heard <br/>
others<br/>
speak of them being a very good way to show and remember ...but just <br/>
writing it down<br/>
...where it makes since to anyone but me is the problem ....I dont want <br/>
anyone<br/>
to show up at my door asking for proof and I not have it legible if you <br/>
know<br/>
what I mean ....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For out-of-staters: in SC we are required to keep a daily <br/>
log/planner/ journal/blog of the activities and learning that we engage <br/>
in/pursue with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a daytimer i which I write all that we do. A LOT in advance, <br/>
because if I don&#39;t write it down, I&#39;ll forget (like park days or trips <br/>
somewhere or classes we take or whatever). So, it&#39;s an &quot;appointment <br/>
book.&quot; I also write things down *after* the fact, because a lot of <br/>
learning *happens* withOUT an appointment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I write down snippets of conversations that we have---like during a <br/>
movie or in the car. Many people disregard conversations: they are <br/>
probably THE most important activity we engage in as far as our <br/>
learning goes. So, after a political ad, we may discuss the candidates: <br/>
political science. When the puppy ran by with a tampon in her mouth: a <br/>
brief conversation about health & hygiene. &lt;g&gt; Or---recently a history <br/>
moment: &quot;Jim Crow&quot; was mentioned somewhere (probably Family Guy! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
It fueled a 20-30 minute chat about the Civil War and racial tension <br/>
and caste systems abroad and how I remember  (but barely) some of the <br/>
Jim Crow signs and the race riots as a small child (I was born in <br/>
1960)...and all sorts of related things. Chances are that the boys will <br/>
remember that way better than a chapter in a US history book. They may <br/>
not be able to recite a litany of facts, but the *idea* of Jim Crow is <br/>
there---they will make further connections as they learn and grow.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t discount *small* a-ha moments of learning!!! They *count*!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and if you don&#39;t know---look it up! Don&#39;t be shy about not knowing <br/>
an answer! We found out more about Jim Crow Laws by googling it.<br/>
<br/>
In school, kids are often isolated from REAL conversations. They spend <br/>
a LOT of their time *answering* questions--- when what they want and <br/>
need is to ASK questions and get good, helpful answers. Often their <br/>
conversation at home revolve around &quot;what&#39;s on the test&quot; schoolwork and <br/>
homework and eating and sleeping and soccer/piano practice. They don&#39;t <br/>
get to *share* and ask/have answered questions that are meaningful *to <br/>
them*.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling allows a LOT of time for that kind of shared learning. It <br/>
allows a LOT of time for questions and ponderings. They&#39;re IMPORTANT. <br/>
Include them in your documentation!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148932695">Hi Josie and Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been home schooling my son since 2nd grade. He is in 6th grade<br/>
this year. Last year was my first year &quot;Un-schooling&quot; And we still do<br/>
a lot of schoolish things... <br/>
But my basic approach was to give my son a copy of the state laws<br/>
concerning home schooling and a little talk. <br/>
<br/>
The talk included the fact that I believe the best learning is self<br/>
learning and that he is in charge of what to learn and how to learn<br/>
it, but in order to comply with the laws he must learn something about<br/>
each of the 5 basic subjects. I also talked to him about the state<br/>
laws and what would be required of us should DSS come knocking on our<br/>
door. I then put him in charge of his daily plan-book/diary, and<br/>
attendance chart. <br/>
<br/>
We made this agreement. He is to keep up with the plan book and I am<br/>
to approve it at the end of each day. We decided to continue using the<br/>
basic format that I started using when he was in 2nd grade. I used<br/>
Microsoft Word to create a file. Made a new  page for each day and<br/>
wrote a sentence about what we did for each subject that day. I print<br/>
out each page and put a paper copy in a large 3 ring binder. But the<br/>
same file gets passed back and forth between us. Pretty simple. <br/>
<br/>
Each day DS e-mails me the file with what he has done in his words and<br/>
I e-mail it back with my suggestions. At first it was just 10<br/>
sentences like &quot;Mom, Today I did ___ to help me learn ___ about math.<br/>
Tomorrow I plan to ...&quot; and so forth. I always send a response back<br/>
&quot;Dear Son, That was a good idea what do you think of trying ___ for<br/>
Math tomorrow?&quot; So we passed this one file back and forth through<br/>
e-mail 180 times. <br/>
<br/>
As time has passed this file has grown to include embedded photos.<br/>
Links to resources he used online. Videos and mp3 clips of him<br/>
practicing banjo, biking, hiking etc. The best part about it is that<br/>
had I not given the responsibility of creating his own plan-book/diary<br/>
I would never have done that stuff. He did that all on his own. He<br/>
also decided that having an online course for math works best for him.<br/>
But playing Warcraft was the best reading course he could possibly<br/>
imagine because if you can&#39;t read or don&#39;t understand the words you<br/>
can&#39;t advance in that game.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, this might not work for you but we have grown closer because<br/>
of it. And it does satisfy the current state laws.<br/>

use their link to the actual sections of state statutes, you can get a <br/>
fairly good handle on things (and you&#39;ll have the statute section <br/>
numbers to go look up) but there are several cases I know of where the <br/>
maps and summaries were inaccurate for years, reflecting <br/>
their &quot;preference&quot; of what people do rather than what actual statute <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad this worked out for you. And I think it sounds  <br/>
commonsensical which is why I want to pull it out and say: It&#39;s not a  <br/>
good representation of putting trust and respect into practice, even  <br/>
though it looks like it on the surface. I suspect it worked for you  <br/>
because of your son&#39;s unique personality that is perhaps drawn to  <br/>
cataloging.<br/>
<br/>
If parents want to provide unschooling (or even homeschooling) as a  <br/>
gift to their kids, the parents shouldn&#39;t be placing contingencies on  <br/>
it. If unschooling is the best way we know to bring kids up, then  <br/>
it&#39;s up to us to figure out how to make it work, not up to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
That said -- and it depends on the kid -- there isn&#39;t a problem in  <br/>
giving kids information on what we need for the state but the burden  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be handed to them. It&#39;s just information.<br/>
<br/>
To help unschooling flourish, it&#39;s much better to find ways to  <br/>
interpret what they&#39;re doing naturally into schoolish terminology  <br/>
rather than telling them they need to do something we can report to  <br/>
the state. Unschooling doesn&#39;t need compromised for the state. We  <br/>
just need to be clever enough to figure out how to translate life  <br/>
into educationese.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We made this agreement. He is to keep up with the plan book and I am<br/>
&gt; to approve it at the end of each day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or else what? He&#39;d be sent back to school? You&#39;d make him do school  <br/>
work? It wasn&#39;t an agreement if the consequences were in your control  <br/>
since power wasn&#39;t in balance.<br/>
<br/>
For a child who likes to write and catalog things, what you had him  <br/>
do might be fun. But in terms of unschooling, it&#39;s an unnecessary  <br/>
barrier between the child and learning. It&#39;s not necessary for  <br/>
learning. It&#39;s not necessary for the state. (Just the way you chose  <br/>
to comply.) Goodness, I&#39;ve tried journals and diaries since I was a  <br/>
kid, but keeping track of what I&#39;m doing, no matter what form I tried  <br/>
to use (even on the computer), just doesn&#39;t interest me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but in order to comply with the laws he must learn something about<br/>
&gt; each of the 5 basic subjects.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With unschooling there are no subjects, despite what a state says. My  <br/>
daughter playing video games is, though, using math (among other  <br/>
things). It&#39;s up to me to put that into words (strategy, percentages,  <br/>
mapping).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The best part about it is that<br/>
&gt; had I not given the responsibility of creating his own plan-book/diary<br/>
&gt; I would never have done that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can&#39;t give responsibility. We can dump a burden on someone. We can  <br/>
require that they comply with our wishes on how a task is accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
But responsibility is something we take on voluntarily, knowing that  <br/>
we can drop it whenever we choose, knowing that we can do it to  <br/>
whatever standards we desire. Try to think of any responsibility you  <br/>
have you can&#39;t do that with. You may be adamant that you wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
choose to drop it or lower certain standards, but the choice is still  <br/>
yours and you&#39;re choosing not to.<br/>
<br/>
That freedom scares people. Well, what if the child decides to drop  <br/>
the responsibility? Then they&#39;ll think they can drop anything. Not  <br/>
true (as unschoolers can testify from experience). When kids are  <br/>
growing up being respected with the philosophy of treating others  <br/>
with respect, they understand the implications of responsibility. And  <br/>
if they don&#39;t understand, then the responsibility was too much for  <br/>
them developmentally.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to flourish, offering them opportunities works great.  <br/>
Being there to help them as much as they need us to works great.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He<br/>
&gt; also decided that having an online course for math<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Showing kids who seem to enjoy such things that online (and in class)  <br/>
math courses exist can be part of unschooling. To me, math was a lot  <br/>
like doing puzzles. It was basically decide what kind of problem it  <br/>
is and figure out which solution that goes with that type of problem  <br/>
to use. And kids can get A&#39;s in that without actually understanding  <br/>
math. It&#39;s comforting for parents to see kids doing a math course,  <br/>
but textbook math is so far removed from actual real world math as to  <br/>
be a totally different creature.<br/>
<br/>
I took my good math grades from high school into college and even  <br/>
managed to get a degree in electrical engineering. When I first  <br/>
started unschooling it did baffle me how a child could get that kind  <br/>
of intense math through unschooling. Well, they can&#39;t ;-) But what  <br/>
they can get is even better. They build up a conceptual understanding  <br/>
of how numbers work. I came to realize as my daughter manipulated  <br/>
numbers and absorbed the meaning of &quot;percentage&quot; from encountering it  <br/>
in various real life contexts, that all those years of textbook math  <br/>
had not given me a conceptual understanding. I could do the problems  <br/>
just fine. But I didn&#39;t understand what lay beneath. I couldn&#39;t look  <br/>
at  a real life engineering problem and know where to begin.  <br/>
(Fortunately I found my forte was software engineering ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Now, after years of absorbing a conceptual understanding of how math  <br/>
works just by living life I do have a conceptual understanding. And  <br/>
my husband comes to me when there&#39;s a math problem he needs to teach  <br/>
in college that he can&#39;t figure out. I no longer look at the way the  <br/>
book is saying the problem is &quot;supposed&quot; to be done. I just think  <br/>
about it and turn it upside down and sideways. I simplify it and try  <br/>
to get a true picture of what&#39;s going on.<br/>

That&#39;s real math. It&#39;s what math course developers *hope* will come  <br/>
out of math courses but they can&#39;t teach that to kids. And they  <br/>
definitely can&#39;t test to see if kids understand. So the teach rotely  <br/>
-- basically teach only what they can test -- and hope for the best.  <br/>
(And some kids do grasp a conceptual understanding of math but I  <br/>
suspect it&#39;s more often despite the course than because of it.  <br/>
They&#39;re already wired to think mathematically. The course may have  <br/>
provided a pathway to explore it, but didn&#39;t cause them to be people  <br/>
who think mathematically.)<br/>
<br/>
While math courses can be fun -- I certain enjoyed them -- they don&#39;t  <br/>
teach what kids really need to learn about numbers. And in fact can  <br/>
give kids an illusion of being good at &quot;math&quot; when they&#39;re just good  <br/>
at memorizing patterns and matching solutions.<br/>

The older I get and the more I try out playing with numbers on my own, the<br/>
more I think about the underlying concepts that make them work.  And of<br/>
course at school there was nowhere near the daydream time available for that<br/>
kind of activity.  Math courses certainly were about doing &quot;steps&quot; rather<br/>
than seeing the structures that numbers can build.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking at why is it that zero multiples are always equal to zero.<br/>
What&#39;s the concept behind that?  I can&#39;t see it.  Maybe one day I&#39;ll get a<br/>
good picture or illustration of what&#39;s happening there.<br/>
<br/>
Memorizing steps, patterns and rules is not how my mind works, and that&#39;s<br/>
the biggest reason I had no interest in math at school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clear explanation of what&#39;s going on with math courses in<br/>
school and how it&#39;s the testing that provides the methods of teaching math,<br/>
not the math itself.  Math instructors choose to present math in order to<br/>
effectively show that it is being presented, not to present the concepts of<br/>
math effectively for others to understand them.  In school, if you can do<br/>
the steps, you can pass the course.<br/>
<br/>
How boring is that?  No wonder I hated math.  I love math now that it<br/>
belongs to me ... not those durned steppy exercises.<br/>

&gt; &gt; He also decided that having an online course for math<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Showing kids who seem to enjoy such things that online (and in class)<br/>
&gt; math courses exist can be part of unschooling. To me, math was a lot<br/>
&gt; like doing puzzles. It was basically decide what kind of problem it<br/>
&gt; is and figure out which solution that goes with that type of problem<br/>
&gt; to use. And kids can get A&#39;s in that without actually understanding<br/>
&gt; math. It&#39;s comforting for parents to see kids doing a math course,<br/>
&gt; but textbook math is so far removed from actual real world math as to<br/>
&gt; be a totally different creature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I took my good math grades from high school into college and even<br/>
&gt; managed to get a degree in electrical engineering. When I first<br/>
&gt; started unschooling it did baffle me how a child could get that kind<br/>
&gt; of intense math through unschooling. Well, they can&#39;t ;-) But what<br/>
&gt; they can get is even better. They build up a conceptual understanding<br/>
&gt; of how numbers work. I came to realize as my daughter manipulated<br/>
&gt; numbers and absorbed the meaning of &quot;percentage&quot; from encountering it<br/>
&gt; in various real life contexts, that all those years of textbook math<br/>
&gt; had not given me a conceptual understanding. I could do the problems<br/>
&gt; just fine. But I didn&#39;t understand what lay beneath. I couldn&#39;t look<br/>
&gt; at a real life engineering problem and know where to begin.<br/>
&gt; (Fortunately I found my forte was software engineering ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, after years of absorbing a conceptual understanding of how math<br/>
&gt; works just by living life I do have a conceptual understanding. And<br/>
&gt; my husband comes to me when there&#39;s a math problem he needs to teach<br/>
&gt; in college that he can&#39;t figure out. I no longer look at the way the<br/>
&gt; book is saying the problem is &quot;supposed&quot; to be done. I just think<br/>
&gt; about it and turn it upside down and sideways. I simplify it and try<br/>
&gt; to get a true picture of what&#39;s going on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s real math. It&#39;s what math course developers *hope* will come<br/>
&gt; out of math courses but they can&#39;t teach that to kids. And they<br/>
&gt; definitely can&#39;t test to see if kids understand. So the teach rotely<br/>
