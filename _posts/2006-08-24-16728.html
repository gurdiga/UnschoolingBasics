You said that in spite of the relaxed laws you felt a need to document<br/>
because of your family. You ARE going above and beyond the law if<br/>
you&#39;re worried about documenting everything. According to state law,<br/>
you only need to document certain subjects and there is NO oversight<br/>
or need to turn anything in.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, I would simply keep a nice memory journal documenting my<br/>
life. All of the things they do can be categorized if necessary, but<br/>
why worry if you don&#39;t even turn the records in? If it&#39;s just for your<br/>
family, I think it&#39;s time to get some space. The state doesn&#39;t even<br/>
want to see your records.<br/>

<br/>
My state requires it, but I look at it as both a challenge and as a <br/>
kick in the butt.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more apt to keep records for several reasons. I&#39;m kind of a high <br/>
profile unschooler in the state. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t need to get caught outside <br/>
the law! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a scrapbook for my boys. They can go back year to year and see <br/>
what happened to them and in the world. Kind of a &quot;yearbook&quot; without <br/>
having to go to school! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having to keep a portfolio (for the state) reminds me to slide that <br/>
&quot;Oklamhoma!&quot; playbill in Duncan&#39;s box tonight as we come in. To blog <br/>
every now & then (I&#39;m a bit slammed right now, but I have ---like six! <br/>
blog entries underway. Cam has my camera, so I can&#39;t add photos), which <br/>
is a great way to document---and it doesn&#39;t matter if there is a <br/>
computer crash because it&#39;s &quot;kept&quot; somewhere else. PLUS, grandparents <br/>
and in-laws can *see* and *read* how much you&#39;re doing. *That* may make <br/>
you blog more too! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What the boys will need in the future (higher education) really doesn&#39;t <br/>
play into it for me. BUT---keeping Cam&#39;s job schedule *might*. For me, <br/>
it&#39;s more of a memory thang.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353863298">Hi Tina,<br/>
I don&#39;t keep records either. I&#39;m just not organized enough and I don&#39;t like<br/>
blogging or scrapbooking so that&#39;s out....but here&#39;s what I do.....I have a<br/>
file for each of the kids. In it I put any 4-H awards, programs, ticket<br/>
stubs, anything they might write I copy or print off a second one and stick<br/>
in there, anything they bring home from their activities or community<br/>
classes. I do this so that if they need a portfolio or a transcript, I can<br/>
go through this and come up with what they&#39;ve done. Plus, they like to look<br/>
through the files and see their stuff. It&#39;s my compromise to a possible<br/>
future need without spending a lot of time and energy now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; military minded child?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Higher education&quot; only cares about the &quot;high school&quot; years - not <br/>
everything from age 5 on. So, once DS, who is now 8, reaches his <br/>
teens, I&#39;ll probably keep some kind of log, chart, portfolio, <br/>
folder, spreadsheet, something, that can (if needed) be turned into <br/>
the kind of records he would need to apply - IF it is required at <br/>
all by the time he might so choose to go to college. It might be <br/>
something as simple as grabbing a scope and sequence somewhere, <br/>
making a spreadsheet of it (line by line of the areas) and then <br/>
typing in what he did that fits that particular area and maybe a <br/>
folder in the file cabinet to keep printouts of stuff and other <br/>
mementos (playbills and the like). The military (not the service <br/>
academies, which fall into the colleges and universities enrollment <br/>
category, but just straight enlistment) doesn&#39;t, so far as I know, <br/>
check any kind of transcript, just whether or not you&#39;ve got a <br/>
diploma or GED and a pulse.<br/>
<br/>
And, too, our state just expanded the &#39;dual enrollment&#39; situation <br/>
with the community colleges. It is now possible for a teen to <br/>
graduate high school with an Associates degree. Once you&#39;ve got an <br/>
associates degree (or even a couple semesters of college <br/>
coursework), most colleges/universities (and the military) really <br/>
don&#39;t care much about high school records. Also, should DS (or <br/>
anyone else&#39;s kids) choose to postpone college for a few years, they <br/>
can then enroll as &#39;non-traditional&#39; students which is a whole other <br/>
ballgame - that&#39;s where life experience is a big factor, not what <br/>
classes you took in high school.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, there are way more ways around things than the <br/>
traditional route, so I don&#39;t see any need (since the state doesn&#39;t <br/>
require anything) to tie up time and energy into keeping records <br/>
that are of little use.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m another of those not so great at blogging, scrapbooking, etc <br/>
kind of people. DS&#39; baby book is barely touched, and he&#39;s already 8. <br/>
However, we do have a nice little notebook of stuff he&#39;s done, when <br/>
he started walking, talking, etc, because I email my mom chatty bits <br/>
here and there and she prints out stuff about DS and hole punches it <br/>
and keeps a nice notebook for each of her grandkids)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236818092">We live in New Jersey where no formal record keeping is required, but <br/>
our dream is to relocate to 1 of several states that do. In light of <br/>
that, and in case a portfolio of her work is ever needed, I had been <br/>
wracking my brain searching for a method to preserve my DD&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the educators&#39; discount most art supply/craft stores are <br/>
willing to give, I balked at the costs of &quot;professional-grade&quot; methods <br/>
of preservation. (Be sure to ask each store manager for a break.) I <br/>
finally decided to use large plastic tubs. The ones designed to store <br/>
legal sized files work well. If you&#39;re worried about time destroying <br/>
the paperwork, you can line the boxes with acid-free paper!<br/>
<br/>
My DD is only 6 years old & the prospect of storing huge boxes is <br/>
daunting. Currently, she feels the need to save every piece of paper.  <br/>
I imagine that soon she&#39;ll be able to cut down on the volume of things <br/>
that she must save!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616820545">For the past few years,  I have put anything that either child  does in a <br/>
large plastic drawer like box.  Pictures, playbills, tickets,  museum brochures, <br/>
places we travel, postcards, artwork etc.  I originally  thought I would <br/>
organize it into portfolios but I&#39;ve found that both kids love  rummaging through <br/>
the boxes occasionally.<br/>
 <br/>
Something came up this morning regarding a scholarship that Brenna is  <br/>
considering applying for.  She needed documentation of 75 hours of  community <br/>
service on an agency letterhead.  She knew immediately...&quot;In my  box, I have <br/>
documentation from the hours I volunteered for both Odyssey of the  Mind and a CAN DO <br/>
(a political  organization).&quot;    Cool.  We can get our hands on it  when she <br/>
needs it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m extremely organized with financial and household information but this  <br/>
box method seems to be working out for the kids information.  One day, they  <br/>
might want to just take the boxes with them when they have a place of their  own.<br/>
