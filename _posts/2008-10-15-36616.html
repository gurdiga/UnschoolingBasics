<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028072237">I&#39;m taking classes again (on-line so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the family)...I have<br/>
a paper to write for my Psychology of Adjustment class.  The professor is<br/>
being very liberal with sources for this paper.  So I was hoping to get some<br/>
of you experienced RU folks to chime in on my topic...because the way I feel<br/>
about these &quot;methods&quot; are very much RU driven.  So if you don&#39;t mind, and if<br/>
the list doesn&#39;t mind, please let me know how you feel about the following,<br/>
and if you care to answer more than just &quot;I agree&quot; that would be good for me<br/>
because I need sources.  You will of course be given credit for your answers<br/>
in APA style.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

OK: Topic is the use of coercion in treatment of attachment disordered<br/>
adopted children (I do not have my hypothesis written just yet.  I&#39;ll do<br/>
that today.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a an article from ATTACh about this practice (the entire text is<br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf">http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf</a> )<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this document is to set guidelines and standards for<br/>
ethically and clinically appropriate treatment for children with attachment<br/>
problems. This document is intended to provide guidance to parents and<br/>
therapists so that they avoid the use of coercive techniques. ATTACh<br/>
believes a<br/>
central focus of treatment for children with attachment problems is to<br/>
create an<br/>
environment in which the individual can safely work to integrate previously<br/>
unmanageable information and emotions related to early traumatic experiences<br/>
with caregivers. Those post-traumatic emotional reactions interfere with the<br/>
development of healthy relationships and may have serious negative effects<br/>
on a<br/>
child&#39;s overall development.<br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
OK so that&#39;s the focus...here is a brief description of what they are<br/>
talking about...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is important at the outset to clarify that a coercive treatment approach<br/>
is separate and<br/>
distinct from the occasional and judicious use of strategies such as logical<br/>
and reasonable<br/>
consequences, safety interventions, enforcement of limits and other<br/>
legitimate interventions in<br/>
the socialization of and provision of safety for children. Though these can<br/>
be defined as<br/>
&quot;coercive,&quot; they are not typically accompanied by fear and are a legitimate<br/>
part of a parenting<br/>
toolbox for parents of all children. When used in the context of a loving<br/>
parent child relationship,<br/>
the occasional and judicious use of such techniques is a constructive<br/>
intervention of parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Harmful and threatening forms of coercion have previously been used in<br/>
treatment with<br/>
children. Some of these practices were done in the name of attachment<br/>
therapy. Examples<br/>
include wrapping children in blankets and not allowing them to leave; poking<br/>
children during<br/>
therapy and strongly encouraging (even demanding) them to express anger at<br/>
previous abusers;<br/>
adults lying on children; and therapists forcing a child to carry out<br/>
explicit instructions for<br/>
behavior (e.g., sitting in a specific manner) as dictated by the therapist<br/>
or risk serious<br/>
consequences. These practices, and similar ones, fall in an area that is<br/>
clearly coercive. We<br/>
believe that the use of this type of coercion is not appropriate in<br/>
treatment for children.<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
Further...<br/>
<br/>
In addition, ATTACh supports<br/>
recommendations in the 2006 Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment<br/>
Therapy,<br/>
Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems. (Chaffin et al.,<br/>
2006) Specifically, we<br/>
agree with following recommendation:<br/>
�techniques involving physical coercion, psychologically or physically<br/>
enforced holding, physical restraint, physical domination, provoked<br/>
catharsis,<br/>
ventilation of rage, age regression, humiliation, withholding or forcing<br/>
food or<br/>
water intake, prolonged social isolation, or assuming exaggerated levels of<br/>
control<br/>
and domination over a child are contraindicated�.&quot; (Chaffin et al., 2006, p.<br/>
86)<br/>
Each of these statements condemns the use of coercion in treatment. However,<br/>
none<br/>
gives guidance about what distinguishes coercive interventions from<br/>
acceptable authoritative<br/>
practices. It is easy to distinguish between the extremes. However, a wide<br/>
continuum exists<br/>
between the endpoints. This is the area in which parents and therapists have<br/>
struggled to find<br/>
interventions that effectively address the population of children who have<br/>
experienced early life<br/>
maltreatment and their current challenging behaviors. ATTACh believes it is<br/>
important to give<br/>
usable guidance to those courageous enough to work with these children, even<br/>
if giving such<br/>
guidance is fraught with difficulties.<br/>
The therapeutic use of confrontation and directive therapeutic techniques is<br/>
widely<br/>
viewed as appropriate and beneficial when appropriately applied (Hammond,<br/>
Hepworth, &<br/>
Smith, 2002). The phrase &quot;confrontation&quot; is used in therapeutic literature<br/>
as a technique to help<br/>
the clients resolve maladaptive defenses. ATTACh believes the proper use of<br/>
therapeutic<br/>
confrontation and other directive techniques may be beneficial but must be<br/>
done in a<br/>
manner that promotes attunement, sensitivity, and developmental<br/>
appropriateness.<br/>

OK it&#39;s a long paper and there is more.  Specifically what I&#39;d like to see<br/>
from the RU perspective are feelings about this treatment and if you have<br/>
any real stories of RAD and treatment for it from an RU perspective that<br/>
would be perfect.  I want to contend that it&#39;s possible to treat a child<br/>
with RAD with dignity and respect and still foster an attachment, but I<br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right.  My daughter has attachment issues but not severe<br/>
ones.  Am I wrong about seriously disordered children?  Can RU work there<br/>
too?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help,<br/>
