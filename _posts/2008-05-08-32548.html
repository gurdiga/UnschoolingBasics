<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314718917">I&#39;m new to unschooling in a way... so perhaps i&#39;m not yet getting the idea<br/>
here.  So bear with me...<br/>
My now 5.5 year old son developed caviities at age 4.5.  We had respected<br/>
his need for brushing his teeth himself... i did not realize that he had a<br/>
cavitiy till the morning he awoke with tooth pain.  We had to get 2 molars<br/>
extracted almost asap... as he had developed an infection in the gums (just<br/>
by waiting for 2 days for a good child-ped-dentist to give us an appt.)  He<br/>
had to undergo full body anesthetic as he could not have tolerated local<br/>
injections at that age.  etc... bad experience all around... made good only<br/>
by the fact that it put the fear of cavities in him... so he woudl brush his<br/>
teeth regularly and ask us to brush for him every other day... also woudl<br/>
chide us for not reminding him to brush on nights that he was too sleepy.<br/>
All this lasted about a month... then....<br/>
<br/>
Well ever since.... I have been ensuring that he rinses his mouth out after<br/>
meals/snacks.... becuase brushing so regularly has lost its charm/importance<br/>
etc.  Usually he will happily rinse his mouth out but will get annoyed by<br/>
the brushing suggestion.  So now his compromise wiht me (we have had several<br/>
discussions and have shown him his cavity ridden molars that were<br/>
extracted... to remind him of the ordeal... getting rid of food residue esp<br/>
every night is important) has been that i should brush his teeth every night<br/>
and he will brush them every morning.<br/>
<br/>
Also &#39;we&#39; have been brushing every night with him...all 3 of us (ds loves to<br/>
brush.. so she is always ready) whether we are done with dinner or not... so<br/>
we can support him.... as the dentist told us that his teeth seem to be<br/>
weaker... and to try adn protect his teeth until the adult teeth grow in...<br/>
as any more removed at this stage means he will need spacers so the teeth<br/>
do&#39;nt grow in awkward.<br/>
<br/>
and also dentist told us that his teeth seem to have a tendency to develop<br/>
cavities very quickly... i think true of any milk teeth... so at the very<br/>
least rinse after every snack (on the spot... no sink required... just slosh<br/>
water around teeth... kids love this ususally... and then swallow.)<br/>
<br/>
Well no questions in this post... but just that this was our experience wrt<br/>
milk teeth, brushing issues and yet staying out of the way.<br/>
Dh and I have even accepted that if ds is unable to keep to the<br/>
rinsing/brushing etc and he does develop cavities... we will be patient and<br/>
help him thru it.   I dont&#39; wnat my fear/issues with inconvenience to us<br/>
etc/cost etc.. to make me make him brush... wrong in so many ways....<br/>
<br/>
i wish i could have more time to write online... but thoguth i&#39;d say this to<br/>
those with kids with milk teeth<br/>
