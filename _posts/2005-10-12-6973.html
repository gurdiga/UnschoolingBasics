<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067791776">Hey!! Interestingly enough, I did a short version of my quiz at my <br/>
roundtable discussion with Kelly for newbies.<br/>
I don&#39;t have the actual quiz with me, but the version I used here was <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
1) List all of your hobbies and interests.<br/>
<br/>
2) List all of the ways you&#39;ve made money (your entire life, ANY <br/>
income produced)<br/>
<br/>
3) List all of the interests you have that you haven&#39;t pursued yet, <br/>
things you&#39;d like to learn before you die.<br/>
<br/>
So after they did a mental tally of all those items I simply asked <br/>
them to tally up how many of them they got proficient at by attending <br/>
school (public school, not college) or how many they COULD have <br/>
learned at school.<br/>
<br/>
The answers were zero, across the board this time. I&#39;ve had up to 2-3 <br/>
items, but after dissecting them we discovered school was unecessary <br/>
for those interests too.<br/>
<br/>
I also had something about what they learned in college and whether <br/>
they were using that in their career or income making potential now.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the short version. I&#39;ll find the original after we move. <br/>
<br/>
Ren, still at the conference site!!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Ren!   We look forward to it!   This is a help for my <br/>
first &quot;homeschool info night&quot; tomorrow!   I&#39;m not going to talk much <br/>
about unschooling, just a brief intro on how we came to homeschool, <br/>
as most people have no clue and I remember being in that same <br/>
audience 2 years ago!  But I will talk a little bit about unschooling <br/>
(and I remember some unschoolers being there, I had never heard about <br/>
it before!  it got me curious and I researched some more), we don&#39;t <br/>
have much time, I&#39;m just trying to come up with something short to <br/>
plant the seed and/or reach someone who may be in the same place I <br/>
was when I was sitting there 2 years ago.   Then there will be time <br/>
for the audience to ask questions.<br/>
