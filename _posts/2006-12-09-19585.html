<div id="ygrps-yiv-514702778">I loved the article!!<br/>
<br/>
I just have one question (not article related).<br/>
Does anyone (else) have problems with respect<br/>
or just plain being a nice kid from their unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for quite awhile now, and<br/>
my nine year old son has grown wonderfully accept<br/>
in his rudeness.  He has become very rude, to me,<br/>
my spouse, strangers....<br/>
<br/>
My spouse, son and I just spent eight days in the mountains<br/>
of GA, cleaning up grandma&#39;s house.  We let him do what he<br/>
wanted to keep busy, didn&#39;t make him help so he didn&#39;t.  We <br/>
took time off to go skiing, hiking, and exploring, so it wasn&#39;t all<br/>
work and no fun.<br/>
<br/>
We do expect a certain amount of decent behavior from him when <br/>
we must go into government buildings, the library, businesses, etc..<br/>
He slapped a stranger with his coat sleeves,  trashed the family room<br/>
before we left, whined insistently whenever asked to do anything,<br/>
and was just plain nasty unless doing exactly what he wanted<br/>
all the time.<br/>
<br/>
My spouse feels that even though learning works well with<br/>
unschooling, his behavior is asking for military style rules.<br/>
We are at a loss for how to continue to unschool.  <br/>
My son just read this post as I type it, and even said that<br/>
it sounds like him.  I want my nice son back.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it too much to ask that he behave?  <br/>
<br/>
Looking for your guidance,<br/>
Vicki<br/>

Is it too much to ask that he  behave? <br/>
<br/>
Looking for your  guidance,<br/>
Vicki<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my advice would be:<br/>
1. explain how this behavior will work (or not work) for  him later in life <br/>
with friends, dating, family, jobs, etc...<br/>
2. ask him what he would do if he were you and had this  kind of problem with <br/>
his child. does he think that the Military Discipline  is what would work? <br/>
How would he work with his child on these  things?<br/>
3. this is REALLY REALLY HARD to do, I don&#39;t know if I  could do it myself, <br/>
but when he is doing these things, do them right along  with him and see if <br/>
your mirroring his behavior makes him embarrassed. I  did this with my toddler <br/>
who was SCREAMING and flailing on the floor  at Target years ago and I got down <br/>
on the floor and did exactly what  she was doing, and it solved the problem <br/>
very quickly. <br/>
4. Lastly, I know this is going to SHOCK you because it  shocked the heck out <br/>
of me when it happened at our house, but nine is  basically a &quot;pre-teen&quot; and <br/>
he&#39;s starting all that rebellious bs! Can  you believe it? So some of it just <br/>
has to be ignored and seen as a  stage. The good news is that the earlier they <br/>
rebel, the sooner they  mature and start acting very responsibly so that <br/>
probably means your son  is super gifted. <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck. I&#39;ve been there before and it does get better  with a lot of love <br/>
and laughter. (and patience)<br/>

 <br/>
Yes, he was excited to be going (the only one!).  There was no TV, VCR, <br/>
DVD, nor technology of any kind, (killed me!)  But he is a voracious reader<br/>
and the place is a treasure trove of every role playing game ever created<br/>
(not kidding), every comic book (at least all first additions), tons and tons of books,<br/>
 and tons of other treasures.  He was NOT bored in the least!   We had the issue <br/>
of pulling him from away from the DS lite, games or books for things that required<br/>
doing.  We never interrupted him unless necessary.<br/>
<br/>
We took hikes he wanted (another punishing feat for me, lol), he was in<br/>
charge of the fire making since he wanted to do it, he had lots of options.<br/>
As for articulation, not a problem there, he is VERY articulate.  Nine in age,<br/>
but reads, talks and thinks above most adults.  He has been showing &#39;tween&#39;<br/>
signs for quite awhile.   The part that bugged me about trashing the room, was<br/>
that he &#39;told&#39; me what he did, knowing that it wasn&#39;t nice, with the &#39;hehehehee and<br/>
and you can&#39;t do anything about it as we are on the road home&#39;<br/>
(I had already cleaned it up before we left.)  But his attitude, is terrible.<br/>
<br/>
My spouse feels that he is abusing the freedom he has.  I have to say<br/>
that I&#39;m feeling that way too.<br/>
<br/>

  I have to agree with you on this one.<br/>
  My 16yo, never acted like this at all.<br/>
  I asked her and she agrees that she nor he (the 9yo)<br/>
  have anything to rebel against.<br/>
   <br/>
  I did have moments on the trip, wishing she had come.<br/>
  Neither my spouse nor I mentioned it around our son,<br/>
  but what differant kids!  The oldest one at a much younger <br/>
  age was such a helpful and mature child.<br/>
   <br/>
  We left her by her choice, (she;s almost 17) home to run <br/>
  our farm (feed animals and gm).  A back part of the woods<br/>
  caught on fire, and she called the fire dept, handled getting <br/>
  them where they needed to go, notifing us...  She never troubled our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853270198">Hi Vicki,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group.  I have a 9 year old boy as well. You might <br/>
find some interesting info in Waldorf books, specifically something <br/>
that &quot;they&quot; refered to as the nine year change.  This year can be a <br/>
big challenge for some.  It has been a while since I have read any <br/>
Waldorf stuff but I have had a few jaw dropping moments with my son <br/>
recently and I was able to step back say --oh yeah he is nine--.  <br/>
<br/>
GOod luck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353045354">What if the sensitive and gifted 9 year old is really<br/>
telling you, do you love me when I am like this?  And<br/>
what if he feels like the answer is no? What if he<br/>
laughs at you only for the self-protection? He may<br/>
feel that his feelings isn&#39;t valuated when they are<br/>
complicated, because you are falling into your own<br/>
diffidult feelings.<br/>
<br/>
If your spouse is thinking about &quot;military disipline&quot;;<br/>
 and even if this isn&#39;t mentioned around this<br/>
wonderful 9 year of yours, are you sure that the 9<br/>
year old isn&#39;t sensing this and picking it up?<br/>
Please look behind the outward behaving.<br/>
His sister isn&#39;t inside her brother and can&#39;t judge<br/>
what he has to rebel against. He may not even know<br/>
himself. But something IS bothering him, even though<br/>
he can&#39;t express it.<br/>
Please trust him, he may be in pain, but not trusting<br/>
you enough to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy for me as a grown up to express how I<br/>
feel about things that are bothering me. The only way<br/>
I can express myself is when I am totally trusted.<br/>
<br/>
You just may suceed in trusting him. Try again.<br/>

Great article. I love getting the unschooling word out to people. Good <br/>
for you! <br/>

My husband and I are starting an unschool in Iowa much like North Star <br/>

  I have to ask Michelle, why are you inviting such unrest into your life --- and your children&#39;s lives?  Is there not someone better suited to taking care of your kids for a week?  Not some way to take them along, or skip the trip?  A week with that Grandma would be hellish for my unschooling kids.  Andy did three solo visits with the grandparents, who are much like you describe your Mom -- he doesn&#39;t rebel, but goes with the flow out of respect that he is a guest in their home (I expect no less from our boys), but has decided the stress is just too much for him and he won&#39;t be visiting alone anymore.  Dan never has had any willingness to be alone with them in their home.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I think it&#39;s unreasonable for you to have your Mom keep your kids and encourage them to flout her rules, no matter how unreasonable you think the rules are. It is her home, and by having your kids there, she&#39;s doing you a favor.  The least you can all do is make the visit as pleasant as possible for everyone.  I think you&#39;re setting everyone for unnecessary hurt feelings.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  We&#39;ve raised our children with respect and we get that respect back. Not because we &quot;deserve&quot; or &quot;expect&quot; it but because we show it.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  Yet you&#39;re telling them they don&#39;t have to show Grandma any respect, that it&#39;s okay to disrespect her because you don&#39;t agree with her.   What you&#39;ll be showing them is that you don&#39;t have any respect for Grandma either.  Why put everyone thru this?<br/>

Well I have two teens that are &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;act responsibly&quot;  and<br/>
never rebeled. I don&#39;t believe in teen rebellion. My kids have  nothing<br/>
to rebel against so why would that be a natural  stage?<br/>
I think it is natural for some, maybe not for others,  but one certainly does <br/>
hear about it, especially during times when  children are trying to make a <br/>
statement about who they are/aren&#39;t. My son  at age 10 decided to rebel against <br/>
things that are part of  ME - like the kind of job I support my family with (I <br/>
work as the  music director at a Catholic Church and sing at Jazz gigs at <br/>
night) It  bothered him all of the sudden that people might think he could follow <br/>
in  my footsteps (since he is really musical) So, he decided to act out and  <br/>
speak in a way that would ensure that I (and others) NEVER in a  million years <br/>
would think he will &#39;choose to be like me  when he grows up.&#39; He tried to do <br/>
everything that is as &quot;uncatholic&quot; as  can be and also tried to distance <br/>
himself from music in every way he  could, including saying that he hated all <br/>
instruments, didn&#39;t want to  sing, blah blah. It lasted about 6 or 7 months and <br/>
though he still  talks the talk, he now isn&#39;t walking the walk and sits at the <br/>
piano and  plays, gets out his trumpet, prays at night, sings all the time while <br/>
he  is walking around the house, and talks about being thankful to God. I <br/>
have  to be very careful/respectful and never say &quot;that was a nice song you  were <br/>
humming&quot; or &quot;it was sweet that you asked God to make your brother  feel <br/>
better.&quot; If I wasn&#39;t aware of his rebellion, I couldn&#39;t be sensitive  enough to <br/>
pretend I don&#39;t notice these wonderful things in  him.<br/>
<br/>
And I totally disagree with getting down on the  floor and acting like<br/>
the child when they&#39;re having a meltdown or other  difficulty. That&#39;s<br/>
the last thing a person needs during a frustrating  moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I saw the lesson as life-saving. My daughter was trying  to see what she <br/>
could do to get me to change my mind and be ok with  her hiding inside the middle <br/>
of clothing racks where she could  get lost and abducted. I kept pulling her <br/>
out, she kept going in. It  wasn&#39;t a game I was ok with because I know of <br/>
someone who lost  (permanently) their child this way at Sears in CA. Not taking her <br/>
to the  store was not an option. I was on my own. Our mirrored antics and  <br/>
tantrums helped her to laugh at the situation. At 2 she had  that great of a <br/>
sense of humor and could see the silliness involved.  Since she&#39;s my child, I <br/>
know what works with her and understand how  sophisticated she has always been <br/>
when it comes to being able to  laugh at herself and whatever situation is going <br/>
on. We use humor and self  reflection a lot as methods of learning and <br/>

<br/>
I am new to the group. I have a 9 year old boy as well. You might <br/>
find some interesting info in Waldorf books, specifically something <br/>
that &quot;they&quot; refered to as the nine year change. This year can be a <br/>
big challenge for some. It has been a while since I have read any <br/>
Waldorf stuff but I have had a few jaw dropping moments with my son <br/>
recently and I was able to step back say --oh yeah he is nine--. <br/>
<br/>
GOod luck!!<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had the same experience with my (now) 3 year old daughter. Mirroring<br/>
her helped her to see the effect of her actions and she re-gained her<br/>
&quot;composure.&quot;  We now even have a name for it - &quot;melting,&quot; as in melt-down -<br/>
and sometimes we all just &quot;melt&quot; for the dramatic and playful fun of it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do think it depends on the nature of the child, though. Lila will<br/>
generally choose fun and laughter, given the chance, no matter how she feels<br/>
in any given moment. Sometimes we just have to help her see where that<br/>
opening is. I have no idea if my newborn will feel the same way when the<br/>
time comes; I wouldn&#39;t assume it. But isn&#39;t this the beauty of aware<br/>
parenting? And isn&#39;t this, the chance to really see our children, one of the<br/>
great things about unschooling? To have the freedom to do for one what works<br/>
for one, and do for another what works for them?<br/>

3. this is REALLY REALLY HARD to do, I don&#39;t know if I  could do it <br/>
myself,<br/>
but when he is doing these things, do them right along  with him and <br/>
see if<br/>
your mirroring his behavior makes him embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t seek to embarrass him. That happens too often naturall! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just talk wih him. He&#39;s not trying to be difficult. He&#39;s trying to <br/>
communicate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
4. Lastly, I know this is going to SHOCK you because it  shocked the <br/>
heck out<br/>
of me when it happened at our house, but nine is  basically a <br/>
&quot;pre-teen&quot; and<br/>
he&#39;s starting all that rebellious bs! Can  you believe it? So some of <br/>
it just<br/>
has to be ignored and seen as a  stage. The good news is that the <br/>
earlier they<br/>
rebel, the sooner they  mature and start acting very responsibly so <br/>
that<br/>
probably means your son  is super gifted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Although it may indeed be a stage, it&#39;s not to be ignored. He&#39;s asking <br/>
for help.<br/>
<br/>
Assume he&#39;s doing his best. His best at behavior, at communicating, at <br/>
being himself. We ALL want to be understood and appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago before unschooling, Cameron (9 or 10 at the time, I guess) <br/>
asked why all teenagers were rebellious. I said that was just the way <br/>
it was, and that all teens hate their parents. &lt;g&gt; He said, &quot;I could <br/>
*never* hate YOU!&quot; I said, &quot;Can I get that in writing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So he wrote a note that I still have displayed: &quot;I will never ever <br/>
never never ever ever never ever hate you! Cameron&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s never been the slightest bit rebellious. I credit unschooling and <br/>
mindful parenting with that. Had he stayed in school and had we <br/>
continued with the traditional parenting, chances are that we probably <br/>
would have had issues.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Super gifted&quot; is not a very good way to look at any behavior---unless <br/>
you&#39;re just trying to get the parent to be OK with what&#39;s happening <br/>
*now* in lieu of a better &quot;future&quot;---Let&#39;s look at him as struggling <br/>
through a difficult situation and in need of guidance and help and <br/>
understanding instead!<br/>

about it with some regularity. Saying things like &quot;Well, someday Simon and <br/>
Linnaea will start to be trouble.&quot; or &quot;All kids rebel from their parents, it <br/>
is an important act of separation.&quot; I think it is a very important notion <br/>
for her as I rebelled pretty radically (and some could argue that the fact <br/>
that I am choosing to be nothing like my parents are is an act of <br/>
rebellion--I&#39;d like to think of it more as an act of embracing) when I hit <br/>
about 13 (oddly the same time as she moved 200 miles away for a job). And my <br/>
brother still barely talks to her. There was never anything harsh about <br/>
that, just when he went to college he never came home again. If I were to <br/>
argue that it isn&#39;t inevitable I would be questioning her parenting. And <br/>
while I do question her parenting, I tend not to feel the need to question <br/>
it aloud.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t true. If the goal of the parent-child relationship is that <br/>

believe this with two children who haven&#39;t reached their teens yet. So I am <br/>
not speaking from experience. However I have watched 9 year olds and 4 year <br/>
olds and 6 year olds fight with their parents and had their parents fight <br/>
back in ways that haven&#39;t occured in our lives.<br/>

I&#39;m a single mom. I support myself and three children  and somehow manage to <br/>
home educate as well. Sometimes there is time  for play at a store. We&#39;ve done <br/>
that a good bit. Sometimes there  isn&#39;t because I have to be at a gig and <br/>
work so that we  have food on our table. I&#39;ve been on my own since my youngest <br/>
was a  baby. When I&#39;m at a store (which isn&#39;t often) I need to shop and focus on <br/>
 shopping and not loose my child to a child abductor. I did what  I needed to <br/>
do to protect my daughter. Also, I respect store  merchandise and do not feel <br/>
that people want children playing inside of  clothing racks with sticky <br/>
fingers from having just eaten a PB&J  sandwich or whatever. I don&#39;t want someone&#39;s <br/>
kid all over my  microphones, instruments and music equipment when I&#39;m at <br/>
work  and I don&#39;t want to be the kind of parent that allows that when we  are <br/>
somewhere in public. <br/>
If we consider the needs of the child first and  foremost, then it ends<br/>
most of the reasons for meltdowns. <br/>
Her most basic needs are to eat and have a roof over her  head. As her <br/>
provider I had to quickly get done with the shopping  and then go to work.  <br/>

LOL! That would be nice if we all had lives where  we could make a departure <br/>
to a park every time our child needs a park.  Maybe if I won the lottery or <br/>
something! There are times you need to  be in a store and your child has to <br/>
behave themselves! Luckily I have only  had a problem with that sort of thing less <br/>
than a handful of times because  my children and I are very close and they <br/>
understand when its  time to help so that we, as a family, can accomplish our <br/>
goal. I must  also say that even my friends who are stay at home moms, or aren&#39;t <br/>
widowed  or divorced and have plenty of support and family around them do NOT <br/>
 always have the luxury of taking off for the park when their child is  <br/>
feeling playful. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that doing something that ended in both of  us being in stitches <br/>
from laughter was disrespectful. I had to get my  shopping done and leave. I <br/>
could have chosen <br/>
1. to do what I did (which solved the problem, and again  ended in laughter <br/>
and hugs)<br/>
2. To leave her in the rack (dangerous for her,  and disrespectful to the <br/>
store owners)  <br/>
3. to strap her into a stroller (not cool at all with  me)<br/>
4. to hold her against her will (again, not the way I  like to treat her)<br/>
 <br/>
A park day wasn&#39;t possible. I can&#39;t imagine that the  choice I made harmed <br/>
her in any way.<br/>

fights.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go even further.<br/>
<br/>
*I* think that the rebellion comes in because the child (teen) is doing <br/>
EXACTLY what the parent has been pushing the child to do all along: Be <br/>
independent! Be curious! Go explore! Make your own decisions!<br/>
<br/>
But then, when the child DOES go out experimenting, the parent wants <br/>
that control BACK.<br/>
<br/>
Mom & Dad can&#39;t have it BOTH ways. It&#39;s unfair to the child.<br/>
<br/>
The child is SUPPOSED to leave home. He&#39;s expected to make <br/>
mistakes---that&#39;s a HUGE part of learning. Trying. Experimenting. <br/>
Stopping. Starting. Doing. Believing. Changing.<br/>
<br/>
But weirdly, parents want their kids &quot;perfect&quot; (according to the <br/>
parents) before they step out into the &quot;real world.&quot; That&#39;s not <br/>
possible. Of course, I think unschooling children have a distinct <br/>
advantage here, because they are already OUT in the real world, but <br/>
kids who&#39;ve had NO autonomy and who have NO experience making small <br/>
decisions/choices really have no legs to stand on.<br/>
<br/>
HAH! Like my last post! No *FOUNDATION* &lt;g&gt; to build on. We can use <br/>
that blow-up mattress thing here too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children who have been told how and when and with whom to do things <br/>
really have nothing to base future decisions on. They&#39;re missing the <br/>
WHY.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes the *why* can be explained---not often though. To me <br/>
*why* MUST be internal. There has to be a point ---a connection---or <br/>
better, a SERIES of connections for an individual to make sense of <br/>
*why*.<br/>
<br/>
Again, that&#39;s where the Rules vs. Principles thang comes in. Saying, <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t hit&quot; may get the person not to hit again right now. But knowing <br/>
*WHY* (which must be internalized) hurting others is unkind (or when it <br/>
IS appropriate) makes a huge difference in being able to function vs <br/>
following orders.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent allows the child to be exactly who he is at this <br/>
moment---and accept him and trust and respect him, there&#39;s no need to <br/>
fight ---well, what IS there to fight about???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Without exception, ALL of Cameron&#39;s traditionally-parented friends have <br/>
rebelled---and some quite hard. But *none* of his <br/>
unschooled/gently-parented ones have.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has never rebelled. He HAS experimented and tried things I <br/>
wished he hadn&#39;t. To me that&#39;s part of growing up and of learning about <br/>
one&#39;s own boundaries and limits. He&#39;s had a huge safety net in me, and <br/>
he knows I&#39;ll never kick him out for learning more about himself. He&#39;ll <br/>
be 19 next month.<br/>
<br/>
He has *ALWAYS* known that his safety is of utmost importance. And that <br/>
I am here for him no matter what. What&#39;s there to rebel against??<br/>

honoring all of their needs.....which often takes a large amount of<br/>

I agree - it is not a &quot;necessary&quot; thing at all (we aren&#39;t there yet but<br/>
by all reports we should be entering the prelim phase within the next<br/>
year or so as DS hits 9)<br/>
 <br/>
Even though &quot;homeschooling&quot; was rare and &quot;unschooling&quot; unheard of when I<br/>
was a kid, much less &quot;radical unschooling&quot; (except maybe for &quot;those<br/>
hippies living out there on communes&quot;), none of us (me or my siblings)<br/>
went through much, if any, rebellion. In fact, I got closer to my mother<br/>
the further into my teens I got (12-14 was a little rough more due to<br/>
physiological changes than any need to &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;separate&quot;). It wasn&#39;t<br/>
uncommon for me to just hang out in the kitchen after dinner to talk,<br/>
maybe dry the dishes while she washed them. Major life decisions<br/>
included my parents more often than my peers - I&#39;d take in what I saw<br/>
and heard from peers and then filter it through discussion with my<br/>
parents. I still value their input on big stuff. Curfews didn&#39;t exist<br/>
when we were teens - my parents saw no need for them, provided we let<br/>
them know where we would be and approximately when we&#39;d be home so they<br/>
knew we were safe (except for a 2 week period for my sister when she did<br/>
not call home when she was out late - not grounded, just had to be in by<br/>
a set time so my folks knew she was safe). While they didn&#39;t encourage<br/>
drinking (lots of alcoholism in the family), there was an explicit<br/>
understanding that if we or those we were with had been drinking we<br/>
could call home no questions asked for a safe ride. When we made<br/>
mistakes in our choices, they were there to back us up and help us pick<br/>
up the pieces, instead of &quot;I told you so&quot;. Yeah, there were &quot;Because I<br/>
said so&quot; times but by and large those were followed up with additional<br/>
information on why it was so important. Now, as grown and gone kids with<br/>
kids of our own, my siblings and I are still very close to each other<br/>
and to Mom and Dad.<br/>

Today his mom picked him up to take him into town. About an hour <br/>

car and walked back to our house. She&#39;d had an agenda that she <br/>

<br/>
I was so proud of George when he talked to Rayan, today. Rayan said <br/>
he didn&#39;t want to see his mom for awhile and George commented &quot;well, <br/>
maybe that&#39;s what you need right now.&quot; No judgement. No attempt to <br/>
convince him to give his mom another chance. He&#39;s willing for that <br/>
to be Rayan&#39;s decision. It was scary to think of Ray jumping out of <br/>
a moving vehical (I don&#39;t know how fast - on these back roads, not <br/>
very, I&#39;m sure, but still...) and walking three miles to get away. <br/>
Scary to think what he *might* do *if*. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad he felt safe enough here to come back.<br/>
