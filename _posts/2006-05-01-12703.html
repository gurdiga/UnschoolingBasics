<div id="ygrps-yiv-115554412">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
When we had our first daughter we could not imagine putting her to <br/>
bed whenever else did around 8:00 or 9:00 when my hubby did not even <br/>
get home until after 6:00pm.  So she would only see dad about three <br/>
hours.  So she always went to bed late with us and we slept in until <br/>
we felt like getting up.  I knew when she was born I was <br/>
homeschooling.  Sometimes her and I would be in bed still when my <br/>
hubby came home for lunch at 12:00pm.  It was so cool.  We were <br/>
never outside playing until after 1:00pm.  Then when she was a few <br/>
years old and until now she would always sleep 12 hours so her norm <br/>
on waking up was about 10:30am.  Now she is 6 and these past two <br/>
months her body changed her clock and started getting up 8:00 and <br/>
9:00am.  My youngest daughter she has been my early bird and does <br/>
not require as much sleep as my oldest.  But she has gone back and <br/>
forth on sleeping in because of myself and Jenna.  Its been amazing <br/>
watching them grow and see what happens naturally.  I think maybe <br/>
the &quot;bedtime&quot; was invented for all the kids that needed to go to <br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
One more thing I loved having some time with my girls before bed and <br/>
in the evening for the &quot;down&quot; time its my favorite part of our day.  <br/>
