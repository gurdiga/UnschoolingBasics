<div id="ygrps-yiv-103050228">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I thought I better post an introduction.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Amanda and my dh is Dan.  We have 5 children (ages 21yr <br/>
ds, 18yr dd, 15yr ds, 6 yr dd and 2 yr dd).  Our oldest graduated <br/>
from PS a few years ago.  He felt he was too far into high school <br/>
when we brough the other kids home.  We started out as &quot;school at <br/>
homers&quot;, which usually only last a few months before we gave up.  <br/>
Tried this for two years as I worked on figuring out what would work <br/>
better.  After reading a number of books, I took a deep breath and we <br/>
started unschooling.  The smartest move ever made. lol!  Now I have <br/>
the two little girls coming up and they too will be unschooled-though <br/>
my 6yr dd wants to &quot;so school work&quot;.  Just when I feel great about <br/>
unschooling, I get a child that wants school work.  She loves <br/>
workbooks and wants to &quot;do school&quot;, so we provide them for her to use <br/>
if she desires.  She gives us a lot of grief about wanting to go to <br/>
PS.  For some reason I just can&#39;t get her to understand that PS isn&#39;t <br/>
the best place for her.  All she sees are kids to play with, not what <br/>
PS really is about or like.  Let me tell you, she would not be able <br/>
to handle the strictness of PS.  This child does not like sitting <br/>
still and would be very head strong about her opinions which we all <br/>
know wouldn&#39;t go over well with the teachers.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
We live in a very rural setting in the middle of the woods with tons <br/>
of wild animals around us.  (A bear wiped out our bird feeders last <br/>
night!)  We also have a small farm with cows, chickens, a horse, <br/>
ducks and pigs---oh and rabbits, a cat and a fish and an incubator <br/>
full of eggs.  lol!  <br/>
<br/>
We try to live as back to basics as we can right now and are always <br/>
working at being more self sufficient.  We use natural healing and <br/>
herbals, we homebirth, attachment parent, and live simply.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know everyone here better and learn more <br/>
and more.  <br/>
<br/>
