<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533856544">Thanks for all your great responses.  Yes - I&#39;m on several homeschool and unschool lists and I&#39;m hoping to hear from someone in VT regarding state regulations and how to deal with all that.  The only reason I&#39;m still giving them &#39;assignments&#39; is because I&#39;m worried about the repercussions next year if they don&#39;t meet whatever &#39;state standards&#39; they have to.  Since I&#39;m new to all this I&#39;m not sure what to expect. <br/>
 <br/>
I totally agree that they would not CHOOSE to do &#39;bookwork&#39;.  The &#39;weekly&#39; outline that I gave them on the 19th is still not done - so I&#39;m being *really* lax about it.  I really  want to toss it all and let them go.  I just need to figure out how to deal with state regs first.  The LAST thing I want is to put them in the position of having to go back to ps because I screwed up dealing with the state.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are unschoolers around here and I&#39;m working the resource lists as I get them.  I just haven&#39;t gotten alot of info yet.<br/>
 <br/>
When I said &#39;semi-engaged&#39; I didn&#39;t mean it in a negative way.  I meant that I wanted to keep them communicating with me and each other and involved in daily life.  We stick pretty close as a family and I don&#39;t like the idea of them totally disengaging.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s one of those things we will work through over time though.  I remember as a teenager when I played video games for hours on end.  I still enjoy it - but I worry that we don&#39;t leave ourselves open to each other if we are absorbed in a game for a long time.  For me it was an escape, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for them, and I understand that&#39;s the point your making [regarding time to heal, etc] so it&#39;s something I&#39;m open to.  I guess it&#39;s just that I&#39;m so new to all this and I don&#39;t want to make any more mistakes - like I did leaving them in the public school system for 8 years even though I felt compelled to remove them after 2.<br/>
 <br/>
I DO feel this *urge* to &#39;guide&#39; them into &#39;studying&#39; stuff they are interested in - a la unit studies - I&#39;m fighting that urge - really.<br/>
 <br/>
My progression has been this:<br/>
The first day of &#39;homeschool&#39; was full-blown school at home,&quot; schedule, gotta get every little thing done today, by the book, verbatim.&quot;  I didn&#39;t have fun at all, they did ok but only because it was new.  Day two - my eldest did all his work by noon, the youngest cried from lunch til dinner.  Day three - the youngest went on a work strike - I made him sit at the work table all day but he refused to do anything, just sat there and cried - it felt like child abuse.  It was about that time that I realized this whole &#39;school at home&#39; thing was not for us; but I KNOW they will not thrive in the public schools.  That&#39;s when I started reading a LOT more about this &#39;unschooing&#39; thing that was popping up here and there in various resources that I&#39;ve been reading.  So you can see - I&#39;ve only been following this for about a month.  <br/>
 <br/>
I may not phrase things right but my heart is for my children to learn what they love and pursue it - not to make them miserable.  I think I really am in the middle of a paradigm shift (I HATE that term - lol - it&#39;s such a &#39;catch phrase): shifting from &quot;learning&quot; (i.e. educating in a tangible way) to &quot;experiencing life&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again for being such a great resource and sounding board.  I think you will all hear alot from me over the coming months.  Please be patient, I&#39;m learning.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121934046">Amber, <br/>
<br/>
You are not alone, I&#39;m still in a shift too. <br/>
Yesterday my sister called and asked if I would scan<br/>
and email Brooke&#39;s handwriting from when she was 4-5,<br/>
so that she could &quot;brag&quot; about her neice.  Well, sadly<br/>
the information was stored on a computer to which we<br/>
lost everything and I know longer have her<br/>
handwriting.  She had beautiful cursive, textbook<br/>
cursive.  Well, since not sticking with it for the<br/>
past year or so her handwriting is no longer like that<br/>
at all. Ashamedly, I admit, I asked Brooke to<br/>
handwrite something to Aunt Kim.  Needless to say, my<br/>
heart sank because she wrote beautiful at age 4-5 and<br/>
now, you&#39;d hardly know that she ever wrote cursive.  I<br/>
was at a loss and it still bothers me.  Instead of<br/>
improving, she&#39;s went downhill and &quot;I AM&quot; having a<br/>
problem getting over it.  I think that &quot;I AM&quot; having a<br/>
problem with pride, because instead of not caring, I<br/>
do care.  I care about what is thought about me as her<br/>
mom and I care about what people think about her<br/>
handwriting going downhill.  However, I DO NOT WANT TO<br/>
FEEL THIS WAY, I know that my attitude about it stinks<br/>
and that it NEEDS to be changed. <br/>
<br/>
I should have never asked Brooke to write and she<br/>
looked sad when I asked her too, so I told her that<br/>
she didn&#39;t have to.  Also, I said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Brookey,<br/>
it was wrong of me to ask you to do that.&quot;  She didn&#39;t<br/>
know my disappointment because I didn&#39;t show it.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my attitude was wrong, but just wanted you to<br/>
know that you are not alone.  I&#39;m new to radical<br/>
unschooling myself.  For awhile, I&#39;m happy and excited<br/>
and committed, and then with one foul swoop, I LET<br/>
myself get intimidated into thinking it&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m<br/>
scared that my husband will be pissed off that our<br/>
daughter no longer writes neatly and that he will not<br/>
let this unschooling continue.  He won&#39;t beat me or<br/>
anything...LOL, but he won&#39;t see unschooling as<br/>
positive if something was once good but has now gone<br/>
down hill.  Guess we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come<br/>
to it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138186592">You live in Vermont so you have to deal with a local school  <br/>
superintendent and, to be honest, I&#39;d worry about repercussions, too.  <br/>
They have a LOT of authority over you, more than in almost any other  <br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
Which means that a national level email list is not the best place  <br/>
for information about how to handle your particular state-level  <br/>
situation. We can talk about unschooling and we might just happen to  <br/>
offer a few ideas that turn out to be useful to you in meeting your  <br/>
state requirements, but what you really need is to get in touch with  <br/>
people in your own state. You could start with the Vermont  <br/>
Association of Home Educators: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vermonthomeschool.org/">http://www.vermonthomeschool.org/</a>&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
Check out the site Pam just posted.  I agree that you need to get <br/>
more support from local unschoolers and figure out what you need to <br/>
do to meet the requirements of your state.  Once you do, you&#39;ll be <br/>
able to move forward and figure out how that&#39;s going to look in your <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, please don&#39;t feel that you can&#39;t talk about unschooling here!!  <br/>
I know that for me, I was VERY concerned about how my town was going <br/>
to be when I submitted my letter of intent, and until I actually did <br/>
it and got my approval letter back, I worried about it alot.   In the <br/>
meantime, I continued to read, post, etc etc, working on MY way of <br/>
thinking about unschooling, learning as much as I could.   I only <br/>
have one child, so I can imagine it&#39;s even more difficult when you <br/>
have more than one to try to find the right balance and comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling?">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling?</a>   Lots of <br/>
words of wisdom in helping you with your paradigm shift!   <br/>
<br/>

leaving them in the public school system for 8 years even though I <br/>
felt compelled to remove them after 2.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try to be patient, not only with them but with yourself!   It&#39;s going <br/>
to take time, and again, you won&#39;t be able to really focus on it <br/>
until you get the issues regarding your state requirements figured <br/>
out (OK, I&#39;m repeating myself here! Sorry!)<br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
This is the place to work it all out, there are plenty of people here <br/>
who will challenge you, not to harm, but to help you sort out the <br/>
confusion in your mind.   You need to continue to be open to new <br/>
ideas and, sometimes, really radical ways of looking at &quot;education&quot;.<br/>

Amber, you&#39;re doing just fine!  Keep posting those thoughts and <br/>
questions but also make sure you read some of the resources listed <br/>
ont he links, books etc that I&#39;ve mentioned before.   That&#39;s what <br/>
helped me truly &quot;get it&quot;.    Be gentle to yourself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039646957">Thank you Pamela.  I have not read any unschooling<br/>
books at all, although, I&#39;ve been to numerous<br/>
websites.  I DO want to be carefree about this,it is<br/>
an attitude I want to carry all the time, even when<br/>
confronted.  The &quot;will&quot; is there, just not all the way<br/>
there yet.<br/>

That&#39;s great that you use them all the time! (really! what do you do?)  <br/>
My dd, because of her learning style, has had a hard time learning them <br/>
in the way the school wanted her to, to be able to spit out the answers <br/>
like a machine, and as far as I&#39;m concerned, I don&#39;t care if she EVER <br/>
has them down cold (I have to stop and think about them sometimes, but <br/>
I don&#39;t have a use for them often.  I like my calculator).<br/>
<br/>
Kids will learn things they NEED when the time presents itself.   I IS <br/>
really hard to wrap yourself around, I&#39;m still really new to this, but <br/>
I&#39;m trusting that this is the best thing for my 13 yo (I can SEE the <br/>
benefits of her being out of the public school environment, and she&#39;s <br/>
learning all the time, it just doesn&#39;t look like &quot;traditional school&quot; <br/>
and I think that&#39;s what a lot of people have a hard time with).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d have learned them anyway because they were useful.<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots and lots of kids learn them well enough to pass a test  <br/>
(fool the teacher), but don&#39;t remember them later. Lots of others  <br/>
learn them and remember them, but they ALSO remember the discomfort  <br/>
and misery or boredom and they associate that with mathematics and  <br/>
steer themselves clear of it in the future, if at al possible. Some  <br/>
of us learned them relatively painlessly and remember them (because  <br/>
we used them) and might have more trouble understanding what the  <br/>
problem is.<br/>
<br/>
We have a country filled with people with severe math anxiety, even  <br/>
phobia. Most of them &quot;learned&quot; multiplication facts sometime around 8  <br/>
to 10 years old. Most of them can&#39;t use those facts in real life  <br/>
because they&#39;re so math anxious that their brains freeze when faced  <br/>
with any kind of naturally mathematical situation.<br/>
<br/>
If a child memorizes multiplication facts and can spout them off, I  <br/>
would consider that ALSO not particularly valuable - any cheap  <br/>
calculator can do that, and a lot more, and probably faster and more  <br/>
accurately. Sometimes it is fun to learn them - then fine, I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to say kids should be PREVENTED from learning them &lt;G&gt;. But I&#39;m  <br/>
not at all impressed if they do - I&#39;m more impressed by the kid who  <br/>
points out to me, &quot;If you keep moving halfway to the wall, in theory  <br/>
you&#39;ll never get there, because you are always only moving halfway  <br/>
there. But, if you TRY it, you&#39;ll actually bump into the wall.&quot; Now  <br/>
THAT is some interesting valuable mathematical thinking!<br/>
