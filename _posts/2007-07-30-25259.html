  I also know many people who work on these nature programmes. My <br/>
husband and most of the people we know work in the film and <br/>
television industry. These shows start with a storyline and script <br/>
much like reality tv shows. Then they try to get the shots to fit <br/>
with the script. Sometimes they need to use food or some other <br/>
stimuli or action to get the animals to perform their role. The <br/>
original nature shows from disney in the sixties had the plots <br/>
patterned after typical disney stories. I grew up on these and Wild <br/>
Kingdom -another travesty to science.<br/>
It is not a conspiracy. It is just giving the viewer something <br/>
palatable. It is about ratings not science. Have you ever been <br/>
interviewed by a news show?  I have been quite a few times. They <br/>
write the story then look for quotes to fit in to the story. They ask <br/>
you really leading questions and then they edit your answers to match <br/>
what they want. It is not information gathering, it is news. Two <br/>
different things.<br/>
