<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891041981">unschoolingbasicsWow. This is the second time this week that I have seen a mean spirit hiding behind &quot;Christian values.&quot; I&#39;m not a Christian, but I know there are good, loving lessons that religion can bring into a life. Too bad it is used as an excuse for cruelty, too. <br/>
