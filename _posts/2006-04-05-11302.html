<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241895352">&quot;Why does this country have to make things so difficult for people to<br/>
be educated in areas of interest only, meaning they can still be<br/>
self-learned but if they WANT to go higher in just one area, WHY do<br/>
they HAVE to know a little about everything else?  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes, archaic ideas that need to die out.<br/>
In reality, those that specialize are in DEMAND! I don&#39;t know that<br/>
I&#39;ll ever specialize much in life, being a dabbler is more my style.:)<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing this at work a couple days ago. Some of the MAC<br/>
artists and I were talking about how lame it would be to attend any<br/>
college makeup artistry courses, because what we want is makeup<br/>
artistry courses ONLY.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be forced to take English and Math to learn artistry<br/>
skills. Dumb.  The whole idea of &quot;well rounded&quot; is ridiculous. The<br/>
parts they want to &quot;round out&quot; are only in certain subjects. Subjects<br/>
that you pick up naturally anyway by LIVING!!<br/>
<br/>
People are naturally prone to being more focused OR being dabblers (or<br/>
anything in between). There&#39;s a lot of genetics at work there. If<br/>
someone is interested in a topic, it&#39;s absolutely imperative to delve<br/>
into that topic until the interest is satisfied (and maybe it never<br/>
will be).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get to be a good makeup artist by being coerced into taking a<br/>
bunch of crap to make me &quot;well rounded&quot;. I got good at it by<br/>
constantly learning new skills, reading, attending classes, working in<br/>
the industry and asking questions of those more skilled than I.<br/>
I continue to do these things (also called Learning) in order to gain<br/>
more skills as the years pass.  I don&#39;t need someone else deciding<br/>
what *I* need to be &quot;well rounded&quot;. I will round myself out quite<br/>
nicely thank you.....hopefully not too round as I enjoy hiking,<br/>
running and biking.;)<br/>

 <br/>
I love when this conversation comes around.  I know I was raised with  this <br/>
brainwashing, and I believed it for a very long time.<br/>
 <br/>
The more people I&#39;ve met, the one thing I can say is that even though this  <br/>
idea has been forced on nearly everyone......hardly anyone is truly  <br/>
well-rounded!  Most people have a couple of areas where they excel and some  where they <br/>
are nearly useless.  If you happen to be useless in language  skills, it is <br/>
very difficult to get through the school system or college.<br/>
 <br/>
Most people (outside of unschooling circles, of course) are pretty darn  <br/>
boring.....maybe that&#39;s being well-rounded in dullness.....except those few that  <br/>
have a passion for something.  I&#39;m boring, unless I&#39;m talking about  <br/>
unschooling.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My husband is military, so we have a forced social circle.  The  gatherings <br/>
are wild because people drink excessively.  I think it is  because they are so <br/>
bored with each other, it is the only way to make the time  together bearable. <br/>
 They all seem to be having so much fun, but nothing is  truly discussed or <br/>
learned.  Most of these people have been to college, the  men are mostly the <br/>
elite (smartest, best of their military class) of the  military and even then, <br/>
they are painfully boring.  We have one guy that is  interesting, he is a <br/>
sculptor and was a fine arts major in college.....different  from the usual <br/>
physical education majors the military seems to be full of.   :)  But maybe he is <br/>
interesting because he is different, not a truly  interesting person filled with <br/>
passion.<br/>

<br/>
When I was a kid, I moved one time too many, and had a huge gap in my <br/>
knowledge of history -- got Civil War reconstruction, then next was <br/>
Bay of Pigs.  That&#39;s a pretty big gap.  Believe it or not, I <br/>
functioned in society without that knowledge (other than what you pick <br/>
up in life -- it&#39;s hard to grow up in the &#39;60&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s without <br/>
knowing SOMETHING about WWII!) until this year.  Then, when my son <br/>
asked to learn about WWII, we did -- and I learned a ton.  (And <br/>
enjoyed it a lot more than I would have in my school days.)  Then we <br/>
learned about the Cold War, and now are on WWI, something that I know <br/>
happened, but that is about it.<br/>
<br/>
I was a total failure when it came to anything with fine-motor <br/>
coordination.  I would LOVE to have been able to create works of art --<br/>
 it was in my heart but not my hands.  I turned to writing to express <br/>
myeself, and in high school, decided not to take a class on jewelry <br/>
making, because I didn&#39;t want to mess up my GPA.  Later in life -- I <br/>
ended up making (and selling some) jewelry.  I made things out of <br/>
polymer clay.  I&#39;ve done a lot of things that, if I had gone with my <br/>
original view of myself, I couldn&#39;t possibly ever do.  I am blooming a <br/>
bit late. (Hey, I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s!)<br/>
<br/>
So, even someone thinks they are useless at some particular thing, <br/>
they may just be on a different time schedule!<br/>
