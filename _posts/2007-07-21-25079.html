Both my kids have been liking Higglytown Heroes. There&#39;s a character  <br/>
who&#39;s very patronizing of children, which bugs me, but they like the  <br/>
show.<br/>

My kids both love Little Mammoth Videos: The Big Park, The Big Plane  <br/>

Very high-quality non-fiction videos.<br/>

&gt; occasionally watches videos (usually of cats) on Youtube and we have  <br/>
&gt; one DVD of a Care Bears cartoon that she requests sometimes to watch  <br/>

&gt; wasn&#39;t interested in going with) and realized I&#39;m so out of the  <br/>
&gt; entertainment loop I didn&#39;t even know what to get her to watch. Is  <br/>
&gt; their a certain cartoon or movie that a 4 y/o girl may enjoy? I ended  <br/>
&gt; up getting a cartoon called Miss Spider&#39;s sunny patch kids. Not sure  <br/>
&gt; if this would be of interest to a 4 y/o but the cover looked cute,  <br/>
&gt; lol! I know each child is different but  I figure their have to be  <br/>

They&#39;re not overtly selling their kind of faith, some *really* funny spins<br/>
on Old Testament folklore mixed in with some non-biblical morality (Madame<br/>
Blueberry&#39;s episode is about Stuff Mart, and another about Fear/Faith).<br/>
Between the episodes, there&#39;s a hilarious little break with Larry the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285431227">Our dd now 5 yrs old has loved watching the Wiggles, Hi 5 (both oz  <br/>
shows) plus Angelina Ballerina, Elmo stuff, Bob the Builder, Fireman  <br/>
Sam, Postman Pat... and has loved some movies such as Charlie & the  <br/>
Chocolate Factory, Monsters Inc and Hoodwinked.<br/>
<br/>
For the record my personal favourites are the movies mentioned above  <br/>
(especially Hoodwinked), Bob the Builder (love the one where he  <br/>
builds an entire eco village) and the Wiggles Movie with Wally the  <br/>
Magician (its a classic and really lets Dorothy the Dinosaur play a  <br/>
full range of emotions... although Space Wiggles also has some great  <br/>
plot points and character insights...hmmmmm, so hard to choose!)    ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696617784">Julian will be 5 in September. He likes a lot of shows, and most are  <br/>
available for rentals I think...<br/>
 <br/>
Fetch With Ruff Ruffman and Maya and Miguel - both are aimed at older kids,  <br/>
like 8+ I think, but he loves them, so I thought I&#39;d add that in there. <br/>
 <br/>
Little Bear, I agree is very unschooly. We also love that show! <br/>
 <br/>
Schooly ones he likes are Franklin and The Berenstain Bears and Cailliou. <br/>
 <br/>
Blue&#39;s Clues is one he and his little sister like (she actually is the  <br/>
biggest Caillou fan I&#39;ve seen, lol), and I like it because Blue is a girl, Mr.  <br/>
Salt and Mrs. Pepper are a great couple and there are other little do-dads that  <br/>
are non gender specific which I like :) <br/>
 <br/>
We like Mr. Rogers, too. Julian is just starting to really enjoy it. <br/>
 <br/>
Oobie. Wow, at first I thought it was odd, but I am now so in love with  that <br/>
show! Bare-handed puppets with simple language. &quot;Granpoo&quot; is DEF. a hippy  in <br/>
disguise ;) His respect towards the musicians is apparent in his tone and the <br/>
 sad way he shakes his head at the business person makes me laugh each time. <br/>
We  all love that show here, lol...<br/>
 <br/>
Basically, we spend most of our TV time with Noggin when it comes to kid  <br/>
shos. No toy commercials- I love that. Even less than what PBS does, they have  <br/>
sponsers with non-adds, lol, but Noggin&#39;s are fewer, and this is an important  <br/>
factor to me - though I know this is for a TV free family, I just wanted to  <br/>
mention that. We also watch selected programs about space and weather, as <br/>
Julian  is really interested in those things and we also watch many of the cooking <br/>
shows  on FoodNetwork. I&#39;d bet that there are cooking shows rentable, perhaps <br/>
even  aimed at kids. Alton Brown is a HUGE hit for the most part (Julian gets <br/>
scared  of the costuming that goes on at times), but his favorite is Rachel <br/>
Ray, lol! <br/>
 <br/>
anyway...lol...um yeah, so those are my suggestions ;) <br/>

What&#39;s the difference? I mean the &quot;real being&quot; part. Children can see <br/>
and feel Barney and Elmo. They can buy small replicas of them in the <br/>
toy department and hug and talk to them. What makes God more real to <br/>
children? How does a child *know* that God loves him but question <br/>
Barney&#39;s love? I don&#39;t get that.<br/>

I think that&#39;s EXACTLY what they are doing. Hell...and even if they <br/>

(Maybe for children is not obvious, but to me it&#39;s blatant.)<br/>

There&#39;s only one person in the world like you. And I happen to like you  just <br/>

 <br/>
I think I have that right - it might be slightly off. Also, his You Are  <br/>
Special song is awfully. Nice. <br/>
 <br/>
Barney makes my teeth hurt with sweetness and the homogenous atmosphere and  <br/>
Veggie Tales have a Christian slant - we are not Christian. But to each their  <br/>
own! :) <br/>

Those two statement above are contradictory. <br/>
<br/>
None of my kids had ANY problem knowing that Elmo and Barney and<br/>

Big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I think Veggie Tales is extremely Christian and being NON-Christian in<br/>
every way myself it is annoying. Some other parents might find the<br/>
indoctrination aspects annoying also. I have no doubt that my kids can<br/>
watch and enjoy them and still decide for themselves on these issues,<br/>
but I certainly am not giving my money to the videos unless one of my<br/>
children were intensely interested.<br/>
<br/>
My kids can SEE Barney and Elmo and Mr. Rogers (who was a very real<br/>
live person that loved children) but God? Nope.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many great videos for kids that don&#39;t try to preach to<br/>
them. I can&#39;t STAND the moralizing factor, as though children can&#39;t<br/>
learn through living but need some kind of &quot;lesson&quot; disguised as a<br/>
cute video. Yuck.<br/>

gentle characters. I love Miss Spiders Sunny Patch. My daughter loves<br/>
Caillou, but I&#39;m sorry we ever let the little monster into the house. She<br/>
learned 3 things from Caillou: how to whine in earnest; how to get under<br/>

scared of many VeggieTales videos ... other than that, both of them got <br/>
bored by the ones that tell a story. They did the VT Sing-a-Longs, <br/>
especially the younger girl.<br/>
<br/>
The both loved several Disney Sing-a-Long song videos. They have a <br/>
Travel channel video about Disney World that they like.<br/>
<br/>
They love Caillou. Barney and the Wiggles have been very popular. <br/>
Lately the discoved Electric Company, but I don&#39;t think they like it <br/>
quite as much as I do. :)<br/>
<br/>
They also like a show they&#39;ve seen at my parents&#39; (we don&#39;t have cable <br/>

Diego, Dora, Franklin, Little Bear... he also likes the Wonder Pets<br/>
and some old standards like Sesame Street.   <br/>
<br/>
Someone was talking about schooly shows... Jack LOVES to watch some of<br/>
the Nick and Disney series that have a strong school focus like That&#39;s<br/>
So Raven,  Drake and Josh,  Wayside School,  and his current favorite<br/>
is some show with a guy named Ned Bigby something about school<br/>
classified.. basically the kid is writing a guide to survive school<br/>
(how to deal with bullies, mean teachers etc )  Anyway these shows <br/>
fascinate him.. he has never been to school obviously so it&#39;s funny to<br/>
see him watch those and then he ALWAYS says he NEVER wants to go to<br/>
school!    He is learning alot of vocabulary though since he is always<br/>
asking what certain things mean like &quot;skipping class&quot;  , &quot;teacher&#39;s<br/>
pet&quot; , &quot;detention&quot; !  <br/>
<br/>
Our current giggle as a family is the cartoon &quot;My Gym Partner is a<br/>
Monkey&quot;  where a little boy&#39;s last name is Lyon and gets changed in<br/>
the school system computer to &quot;Lion&quot; so he has to transfer to the<br/>
Animal school... whomever writes that one has one sick sense of humor<br/>
(and gee we enjoy it so much ! HA!)   Of course our old standby to<br/>
mindless giggles is Spongebob.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414154136">Back when we just had videos/dvds and no reception we discovered alot <br/>
of other movies and shows by watching the trailers. We would never <br/>
have considered *Home on the Range* otherwise - no one we knew had <br/>
seen it, but oh, boy was that a hoot. Yodelling cattle rustlers and <br/>
dairy cows to the rescue!<br/>
<br/>
Another option, if you can afford it, is a dvd service like netflix or <br/>
blockbuster - they have an option where you rate movies you&#39;ve seen <br/>
already and they use those ratings to form a &quot;recommended&quot; list for <br/>
you. That was really handy for us.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have a vcr as well as dvd player, dollar stores often <br/>
have lots of kid videos for cheap. Personally, I tend to rack up fines <br/>
at libraries, so buying or renting from a service is cheaper for me <br/>
than borrowing!<br/>

And of course, Spongebob can also be thought of as not mindless.  Just 5 minutes ago a medieval Spongebob episode came on.  I love this episode &lt;g&gt;  the kids and I have discussed a lot of history and related info based on cartoons.  Another cartoon that comes to mind as sometimes thought of as mindless is Fairly Oddparents, but yet we actually learned history from that too.  Does everyone know that George Washington never had wooden teeth?   When we were in Washington DC going through Mount Vernon I heard someone say, &quot;hey, lets go see George Washingtons wooden teeth&quot;,  well, I was able to tell him that that is a myth.  And I learned it from Fairly Oddparents :)<br/>

Ahh,, but I don&#39;t think TV shows will drain your brain.  ;)   It all counts.  You can make amazing connections with all sorts of media -- from newspapers, and books to even Spongebob and Ed, Edd, and Eddy.  It&#39;s just fun joyous learning!<br/>

That&#39;s one of Mo&#39;s favorites - its the only school-based show she <br/>
watches, I think. She doesn&#39;t like any of the live-action school <br/>
shows, but Ray likes some of those, so she&#39;s watched a few. She <br/>
won&#39;t have anything to do with &quot;Wayside&quot;, which surprised me bc the <br/>
animation makes me think of &quot;Fosters&quot; and she loves that. The school <br/>

frantically for the remote if it comes on and she&#39;s not expecting <br/>

<br/>

satire...er, as it were. Some of the dialog is pretty sophisticated, <br/>
not to mention the undersea sight-gags. Its my favorite kind of <br/>
cartoon, actually - the kind that little kids and adults can watch <br/>
together and each get some fun out of it. Sometimes our whole family <br/>
watches Spongebob together - which is pretty impressive with the <br/>
differences in age and personality and sense of humor around here. <br/>
The only other show we all like to watch is Mythbusters. <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, same here.<br/>
<br/>
We have cable and lots to choose from. So whether I like it or not has<br/>
very little to do with anything.:) I have to admit I&#39;m glad nobody has<br/>
asked for Veggie Tales even though the boys enjoyed a few episodes at<br/>
a friends house when they were small.<br/>
<br/>
Current favorites are &quot;Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;Ed, Edd<br/>
and Eddy&quot; and &quot;Spongebob&quot;....anything on Cartoon Network really.:)<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s why I don&#39;t worry about purchasing videos. We&#39;ve rented<br/>
from the library in the past and we use Blockbuster a lot. That, plus<br/>
cable leaves us purchasing only movies we really want to watch over<br/>
and over. Harry Potter for instance or LOTR. If we didn&#39;t have the<br/>
tv/cable available I would probably try to buy or rent more.<br/>
<br/>
We had &quot;The Wiggles&quot; videos too (still have one or two around here)<br/>
which I find immensely aggravating but they brought a LOT of joy to my<br/>
younger two. They would clear the living room and dance with those for<br/>
hours. Very sweet. My baggage is definitely NOT their issue.:)<br/>
<br/>
I think after years of escaping a cult-like religion I have baggage<br/>
that may never go away. My kids can fortunately explore all options<br/>
without that load. phew.<br/>

few episodes in which Caillou was mean to his little sister. I&#39;ve heard others <br/>
 say the same withg about the whining, but not sir us, thank goodness. <br/>
Probably  one reason I can stand the show, is that I&#39;m not seeing any bad side <br/>
effects for  us. Knock wood! lol! I&#39;m sorry it was a negative thing for <br/>
ya&#39;ll...hopefully,  it&#39;ll have an interesting and easy turn around and the &quot;negative&quot; <br/>
will become a  &quot;positive.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Cyber  Chase is a math-centered cartoon meant for older<br/>
kids, but it is her latest  favorite, and she really is starting to<br/>
understand some of the math  concepts they present.<br/>
Yeah, Julian likes that too at times, but he&#39;s younger and - he is very  <br/>
apprehensive around high excitement and anything with an unknown thrill.<br/>

Have fun!<br/>
