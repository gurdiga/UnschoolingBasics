<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594773576">*This month�s topic is: Picking up the pieces.*<br/>
<br/>
It�s easy unschooling when everything�s going well, but what about when it�s<br/>
not? How do you maintain a sense of support and partnership when it seems<br/>
like things are falling down around your ears? Share tales of unschooling<br/>
through the rough stuff.<br/>
<br/>
*Some possible directions:*<br/>
<br/>
   - How do you pick up the pieces when you�ve fallen down or fallen apart?<br/>
   How do you rebuild trust and security between family members (kids and/or<br/>
   spouses).<br/>
   - How do you maintain a sense of abundance during �lean� times?<br/>
   - How has unschooling sustained you and your family during a crisis?<br/>
   - How do you get from feeling that your life is a shambles to confidence<br/>
   and contentment � on an emotional level, or when housework gets That bad.<br/>
   - What kind of support have you found helpful during harder times?<br/>
   Family? Friends? Strangers?<br/>
   - When have you been able to help someone else who is having a hard time?<br/>
   How has that informed your unschooling life?<br/>
