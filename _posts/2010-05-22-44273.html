<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654891237">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I am just wondering how you would handle this. I am currently on hols with my 4 year old dd and husband (and enjoying a rare few sunny days here in Ireland). Howver this is our problem. My dd dislikes the texture of suncream<br/>
so won&#39;t wear it. That&#39;s fine I understand this (she<br/>
has always struggled with textures - she goes<br/>
through phases where she hates the feel of<br/>
water). So to keep the sun off her I have plenty of long light trousers, and long sleeved tops. I have also asked her to wear a sunhat to keep the sun off her face. She had been doing it, but today she refused. She is fair skinned like me (has a touch of my red<br/>
hair), so I am worried she will burn (I am obsessed with sun cream for myself). I have<br/>
explained to her about her skin and that if not protected it burns easier than other peoples skin - like her Dad&#39;s for example. But she just<br/>
shuts down when I explain things like this.<br/>
Any ideas? Am I being over-protective? As a parent striving to respect my<br/>
daughter do I just leave her at it? I&#39;m confused as to what to do. I would appreciate ideas - might not be able to reply though depending on where we end up next (reception wise) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584004872">Time of sun exposure can make a big difference to the risk of sun burn. Instead of worrying too much about suncream you could work to be in during the high UV hours of 12 to 4 or so and to minimize the length of time you are outside in the sun. The Met Office has a UV forcast for the UK, I don&#39;t know which Ireland you are in, but maybe there is a better one for you. It says that Dublin was at 5 today, which is moderate UV risk with the warning to stay covered and out of the sun during the midday covered or not. Sunscreens, apparently, create a false sense of security about the risk of sun exposure. You should try to not stay out in the sun for too long with or without sunscreen. <br/>
<br/>
You could try going shopping for groovier hats, lots of hat options, capes, ponchos, fantastic skirts that twirl and land covering the legs. Linnaea would have loved going shopping for things like that. You could get one of those pop up tents that she could crawl in and out of during a morning at the beach or a parasol. In Japan I had a parasol that I would use to keep the sun off of me and off of Linnaea as she rode around in her pouch on my chest. They twirl and the colours are fun to look at. <br/>
<br/>
Hope something there sparks some ideas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711432581">One more thing to mention. My son has big time sensory issues and my daughter very sensitive skin so we use california baby and blue lizzard suncreen...it&#39;s non chemical and thicker than normal sunscreen. I rub a bit together in my hands to warm it up and they tolerate me putting a bit on their face....so maybe she would let you try that?<br/>
Also one last suggestion...my kids love making their own stuff so maybe she would enjoy getting a basic hat or visor then decorating it?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And what would happen if she burned?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good point. People fear sun exposure as though it were  <br/>
instant cancer. It takes *decades* of intense exposure that *might*  <br/>
result in cancer. (I&#39;d guess fair skinned people are more sensitive,  <br/>
but still ...)<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s resistant and doesn&#39;t like the alternatives, if you insist  <br/>
you run the risk of creating a war for control over the right to do  <br/>
what she wants to her body rather than a thoughtful decision about  <br/>
whether sunscreen is necessary this time.<br/>
<br/>
You have time. Make the information available to her (though the  <br/>
cancer bit can trickle in later naturally in conversation). The issue  <br/>
for her right now self is avoiding the pain of a burn but she may need  <br/>
to experience -- by her own choice -- a few burns before she decides  <br/>
the &quot;cure&quot; is better than the &quot;disease&quot;. Make it easy for her to  <br/>
choose sunscreen by helping her pick out something that might appeal  <br/>
to her. Make it easy to not be in the sun with a parasol or beach  <br/>
umbrella or scheduling being out at less intense times of the day and  <br/>
other ideas offered.<br/>

I live in Namibia where the sun not only provides nice cancer inducing UVA<br/>
rays and wonderful Vitamin D producing UVB but also quite harsh UVCs. The<br/>
sunblocker creams seem to only keep out the UVBs according to what I&#39;ve been<br/>
reading up in recent months. UVBs seem to be essential to all of us and can<br/>
only be had during times when the sun is high in the sky. I learned years<br/>
ago that only PURE silk keeps out UVC at 100% and PURE cotton keeps out UVC<br/>
at  80%. As soon as any artificial &#39;fibre&#39; is added to the textiles the<br/>
screening effect goes down to less than 20%. And then there is still the not<br/>
getting UVB for the Vitam D production all our bodies need soo much.<br/>
 <br/>
Dr Mercola and the Health Ranger at Naturalnews say to get just enough sun<br/>
exposure until the skins turns slightly pink.This is the time when the body<br/>
has produced just enough Vitam D for the day. It may be ten or 40 minutes,<br/>
depending on skin type. Darker skins need much more exposure! Afterwards<br/>
cover up in pure silk or cotton I suggest. Sunblocker creams are dubious at<br/>
best with all the unknown chemicals they contain. <br/>
 <br/>
Ulrike<br/>
from Namibia - somewhere in Africa where the sun burns everything. I wonder<br/>
if Aloe Vera wouldn&#39;t be an effective way to protect our skins from sunburn.<br/>
Aloes don&#39;t get sunburn. They seem to be the most healthy plants around.  <br/>
PS maybe your kid instinctively knows that she needs the sun for her health.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390574340"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am just wondering how you would handle this. I am currently on hols with my 4 year old dd and husband (and enjoying a rare few sunny days here in Ireland). Howver this is our problem. My dd dislikes the texture of suncream<br/>
&gt; so won&#39;t wear it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Body Shop used to have a spray-on sunscreen that was more liquidy than creamy. My husband hates the texture of most sunscreen but he quite liked that. It didn&#39;t have a really high SPF so it would need to be reapplied more frequently. I&#39;m not sure if they carry it anymore or not. <br/>
<br/>
KINeSYS makes a sunscreen that sprays on and dries quickly without rubbing it on. It&#39;s like a spritzer and your daughter may tolerate that better.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing we do at the beach is wear UV-proof sunsuits that cover the areas that are so  vulnerable - back, chest, upper arms. Like these: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nozone.ca/one_piece_ksuits_c.htm">http://www.nozone.ca/one_piece_ksuits_c.htm</a>&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m fair-skinned and had some very painful sunburns when I was a child. It&#39;s miserable and not at all fun. That would be the main reason I&#39;d try to figure out a solution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348416980">I second this opinion! :)  I have also noticed how the foods I eat effect my skin&#39;s reaction to the sun.  Our family follows a low-fat raw vegan diet and although I am still careful about my sun exposure, I have noticed we can stay in the sun much longer than before without getting pink and our recovery time from too much pink is really quick. :)  When we do use sun cream which is only rarely, we mostly cover up if on a canoe trip or something, we use this.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kabanaskincare.com/">http://www.kabanaskincare.com/</a>   We get the tinted stuff so it doesn&#39;t look that stark white but it does look a little like make-up, lol, not bad though, bot too noticeable.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689016427">Coppertone makes a spray-on one that is clear as well and doesn&#39;t require any rubbing. My kids love it! You just spray it on (they also like spraying it on themselves) and they&#39;re good to go! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081456156">My son hates(!!!) the texture and smell of sunscreen. It wasn&#39;t even worth fighting about. But he&#39;ll gladly wear a hat, if it&#39;s red.<br/>
We&#39;re in Australia. Friends of ours (Mum and 2 girls)have red hair/ fair skin - prime candidates for painful sunburn (including blisters) never mind any long term damage. Her solution was that they found lots of fun hats, and long sleeved clothes, and teamed these with longer dresses or pants. So the girls were playing dress ups to go out (and the bonus was that little of the sensitive skin was out). They often look rather eclectic, both girls have a strong sense of who they are and of the clothes they like. The 13 year old now chooses to wear the spaghetti strap dresses but in her own fashion, throws a long sleeve white t-shirt underneath. My friend also plans lots of fun outings to indoor venues when its a really high UV day. And we do our outdoor things together more often in winter.<br/>
On the days when there was a sunburn - lots of love and understanding. Cool yummy drinks (because they&#39;d get a headache too), a fan at night and a cold washer that could put on any sore spots.<br/>
<br/>
All the best<br/>

&gt; This is a good point. People fear sun exposure as though it were  <br/>

&gt; whether sunscreen is necessary this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have time. Make the information available to her (though the  <br/>
&gt; cancer bit can trickle in later naturally in conversation). The issue  <br/>
&gt; for her right now self is avoiding the pain of a burn but she may need  <br/>
&gt; to experience -- by her own choice -- a few burns before she decides  <br/>
&gt; the &quot;cure&quot; is better than the &quot;disease&quot;. Make it easy for her to  <br/>
&gt; choose sunscreen by helping her pick out something that might appeal  <br/>
&gt; to her. Make it easy to not be in the sun with a parasol or beach  <br/>
&gt; umbrella or scheduling being out at less intense times of the day and  <br/>
&gt; other ideas offered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258076696">DS loves having a cool rag wrung out in fresh brewed cooled tea gently<br/>
laid on when he&#39;s had sunburns. So, whenever we go on outings in the<br/>
summer, he makes sure we&#39;ve got some tea cooling for when we get home<br/>
(or that I pack some tea bags when we&#39;re going to be away). When he was<br/>
little, he had a book called &quot;I&#39;ll teach my dog 100 words&quot; and one of<br/>
the phrases was &quot;Mop the moose&quot; so we call dabbing sunburn with cool tea<br/>
&quot;mopping the moose&quot; LOL and we have a few soft cloths that are<br/>
permanently stained tea color brown/beige that we reserve for that use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466343036">Hey all<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say thanks for all the advice and posts. The crazy sunshine is gone again (that week of good weather was probably our summer lol!!!), so the issue isn&#39;t as pertinent, but I learned a lot from all the suggestions offered.<br/>
<br/>
Schuyler wrote: &quot;Time of sun exposure can make a big difference to the risk of sun burn. Instead<br/>
of worrying too much about suncream you could work to be in during the high UV<br/>
hours of 12 to 4 or so and to minimize the length of time you are outside in the<br/>
sun. The Met Office has a UV forcast for the UK, I don&#39;t know which Ireland you<br/>
are in, but maybe there is a better one for you. It says that Dublin was at 5<br/>
today, which is moderate UV risk with the warning to stay covered and out of the<br/>
sun during the midday covered or not. Sunscreens, apparently, create a false<br/>
sense of security about the risk of sun exposure. You should try to not stay out<br/>
in the sun for too long with or without sunscreen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Schuyler thanks for this info - I didn&#39;t actually realise this. The hat idea was great as well - we went shopping and bought her a Peppa Pig hat which has great cover and she is loving to wear and I feel well at least her face is covered. we have a couple of long sleeved tops as well she likes so I am using them a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of the pop up tent was great as well and I am currently trying to source one (they are actually quite difficult to find here) - it will be handy for the new baby as well (I am due in a few weeks).<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in FL and I know we are supposed to be slathered with some sort of sunblock<br/>
24/7 but reality happens and we&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we have the occasional sunburn.<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realised a lot of what was going on was my fears - &#39;omg what if she gets cancer and it&#39;s my fault for not making her put suncream on&#39; kindof thoughts. But I am aware that I got burnt myself as a child numerous times and I am still here. I also don&#39;t want her to get burnt because I don&#39;t know how she would cope with it. If she grazes herself she falls apart</div>

<br/>
I was trying to explain how my little one gets when something happens to her - she gets very very upset and I think part of me wants to protect her from this, I too had sunburn as a child and it was yucky - I&#39;m worried she would never want to go out in the sun again if she got burnt (she usually stops doing things if she gets hurt). <br/>
<br/>
I have relaxed a lot more on the issue since reading all the replies and getting all the great ideas <br/>

By posting here this is what I was trying to avoid. I said before I learn a lot from these sites and one of the things I try to do is say as little as possible these days if I meet resistance to something - so that we don&#39;t create a war for control. That is why I posted. Though I wasn&#39;t able to reply I was able to read all the emails and a. relax my own thoughts and let go a lot and b. come up with solutions (like the sunhat) that helped keep the sun off her and so not let her get burnt. The option of other types of creams did not work - she just does not want to put it on her full stop. <br/>
<br/>
So again thank you everyone - I really love how my parenting and my relationship with my dd is enhanced by reading and posting here and I appreciate everyone taking the time to reply<br/>
