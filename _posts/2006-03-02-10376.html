<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523641679">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
In anticipation of the May conference I have set up a yahoo group for the kids & teens.  My hope is some connections might be made even before the conference.<br/>
<br/>
This will be a safe place for the kids to send messages & post pictures if they choose.<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of safety (not control) all members will have to be approved by me & all areas are only open to members.  I hope this will make it so all the kids (and parents) no matter what age will feel comfortable here.<br/>
<br/>
Please pass along to anyone you know is coming or thinking about coming to the conference !!<br/>
