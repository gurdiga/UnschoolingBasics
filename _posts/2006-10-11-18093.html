<div id="ygrps-yiv-673616062"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschooltracker.com/">http://www.homeschooltracker.com/</a>  one of many tracking sites <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use it, but I had booked marked it as many say it is free and good.<br/>
I have a list of links about five or six pages long that I have been gathering from my homeschool/unschool/funschool groups.  They are divided pretty well between kids learning/fun sites and parent resources.  If you would like it, I could forward it directly to you so I don&#39;t fill up the group page.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure this has posted numerous time, but please pardon my request....<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; For a newbie who is pursing the world of unschooling and such, but am<br/>
&gt; nervous about record keeping, any links on samples or simplified ones?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in Missouri, and it really isn&#39;t that complicated to do it, but seeing<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; basic idea on keeping up on the 1000 hours on a log would be great.......<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551835085">I use homeschool tracker.  It isn&#39;t perfect, but it isn&#39;t hard,  <br/>
either....and you can&#39;t beat FREE!<br/>
 <br/>
I need it to look a little school-y for my state requirements, so it works  <br/>
for me.<br/>
