<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081582084">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone here is in Virginia?  I&#39;m just trying to figure <br/>
out how to meet the VA homeschooling requirements while unschooling. <br/>
There are a couple of unschooling lists for certain parts of VA, but not <br/>
one for the area where I live.  I tried to join one of the other groups, <br/>
but I&#39;ve not heard back from the moderator in a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Kristie</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m in the Hampton Roads area (near Norfolk and Va. Beach).  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure that we even have umbrella schools here.  I&#39;ll check out that option.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217050518">We used to live in northern VA.  You might ask on VAEclectic -- a <br/>
number of people there are also on NoVaUnschoolers, and might have some <br/>
good ideas.  There was once a thread about how to do the notice of <br/>
intent with as few words as possible.  Mine was quite succinct -- but I <br/>
didn&#39;t live there very long, just a bit over 4 months.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603909173">I second the VaEclectic recommendation.  Unless the law has changed in the<br/>
last 2 years, there are two options for filing, depending on whether you<br/>
have a bachelor&#39;s degree or not.  If you have a bachelor&#39;s degree, it&#39;s<br/>
simply a mater of filing your NOI (and a copy of your diploma) and obtaining<br/>
a portfolio review at the end of the year.  If not, there are more hoops to<br/>
jump through.  VaEclectic will have a wealth of information and<br/>
recommendations for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380485534">Hi Ladies,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on Va Eclectic.  I&#39;ll check them out.  In VA, we can <br/>
file under 4 options.  I do have a Masters, so I can file under that <br/>
option.  Most of the homeschoolers in my area use the California <br/>
Achievement Test, because it&#39;s the easiest route to go.  The School <br/>
Supers can&#39;t argue with the tests, but they can argue about a portfolio <br/>
or &quot;proof of progress.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517624610">When we lived in VA, I planned to do the portfolio review.  I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
expose the boys to standardized testing at 6 years old.  When we moved to<br/>
WV, the rules here aren&#39;t terribly different (though here, parents are not<br/>
allowed to administer testing to their own child) and I found a friend of a<br/>
neighbor who had met the boys at a party and was happy to review their<br/>
portfolios.  She&#39;s very laid back and I actually keep my blog mainly for<br/>
her, in lieu of putting together a binder every summer.  Very easy on the<br/>
boys, easy on me, and we&#39;ve never had word from the school board.  Being on<br/>
VaEclectic for a few years, I don&#39;t recall anyone reporting having a review<br/>
contested, but that might be a question to ask.<br/>
