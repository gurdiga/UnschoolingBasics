Speaking of ADHD/ADD my foster son has been labelled with having this<br/>
and is on medication for it. He is definately a touchy-feely kind of<br/>
learner. He has a one-on-one aide at school, thankfully, and can get up<br/>
and move around when ever he wants to - they even leave the class room.<br/>
I dont believe he would have gotten this help if it werent for state<br/>
intervention. The school would have pushed for more medications and<br/>
blame the parents. That is my experience anyway and one of the major<br/>
reasons why I unschool my two youngest boys.<br/>
I feel the same about the &quot;new label&quot; of bipolar. If a child holds it<br/>
together/squashes their feelings for the most part, then &quot;looses it&quot; and<br/>
become angry/rageful they are labelled bipolar and some people/adults<br/>
become happy that the problem is solved. I have a stubborn bold streak<br/>
and wouldnt take their label of one of my kids. After he was out of<br/>
school his symptoms completely disappeared. Imagine that. They had<br/>
wanted him on Lithium. Something in me was screaming &quot;no&quot; even with all<br/>
the pressure of the school people telling me he was a lost cause. They<br/>
also blamed me and told me I was a very bad mother. The shame overtook<br/>
me for awhile yet, I still knew in my gut that something was wrong with<br/>
the picture and was strong enough and courageous enough to follow my<br/>
instincts. Michele<br/>
