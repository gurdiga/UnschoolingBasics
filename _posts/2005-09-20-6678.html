<div id="ygrps-yiv-450714322">Hello,<br/>
I *see* some names here on the list that they are from the MHLA list. <br/>
I am from MA as well.<br/>
I have several questions about Unschooling. I will be open and blunt <br/>
since I want to learn all I can about Unschooling. <br/>
I have read several books on Unschooling, including the teenage <br/>
liberation hand book.<br/>
<br/>
Here is one of my questions(I hope it makes sense)..way back long <br/>
ago, there were lots of children who did not finish &quot;school&quot;. Dropped <br/>
out in 6th, 7th or 8th grade. I will assume that most of these <br/>
children went on to help around the home, or helping out in a family <br/>
situation. And you always here &quot;I only had an 8th grade <br/>
education&quot;....so isn&#39;t unschooling similar to those who never finshed <br/>
school? Does that make sense?? How can you get along in a doggy-dog <br/>
world like this one without a formal education?<br/>
<br/>
Here is the situation. I have a 12 yo that wants to do NOTHING, and I <br/>
mean NOTHING. She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read. All <br/>
she does is sits around and watches TV, listens to her CD&#39;s and talks <br/>
on the phone when her friends come home. She is in her second year at <br/>
home. I pulled teeth with her last year, and this year it is the same <br/>
thing. <br/>
She takes Dance class twice a week. That&#39;s it.<br/>
How in the world can this child unschool, if she is not interested in <br/>
doing anything? She thinks learning is a waste of time. She really <br/>
could care less.<br/>
We have gone from strict textbook approach, to unit studies, to <br/>
trying to to just watch educational videos and read alouds. Nope. She <br/>
sleeps until 11:00, and lays around. I am ready to send her back to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I WANT to believe in child led learning. But I cannot get it out of <br/>
my head that kids or adults who do not have an education, will not go <br/>
far in this world.  We do not live in an area that has many museums, <br/>
or artsy stuff, or educational things(unless we want to visit <br/>
Sturbridge village a million times)..I am not crafty, and barely got <br/>
out of high school myself.<br/>
<br/>
If someone can offer me a direction here and I would greatly <br/>
appreciate it. Thanks<br/>
Cindy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223118503">Hi Cindy, <br/>
I&#39;m on the mhla list as well and this is our first year <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.  My dd just finished 6th grade, turned 13 <br/>
on Monday and is deschooling BIG TIME!   We&#39;re in North Reading <br/>
(about 15 mins north of Boston).  Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
Have you gone back to the archives to read some of the posts on this <br/>
list?  I HIGHLY recommend it, there are a lot of experienced <br/>
unschoolers who are really good a writing what the whole concept is <br/>
about (and are very patient with us &quot;newbies&quot;!) (and it&#39;s not easily <br/>
summed up, you have to take it in chunks, I&#39;ve found!) There are also <br/>
a lot of great books listed in recent posts and the LINKS section of <br/>
this group that are great!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read. All <br/>
 </span></blockquote>she does is sits around and watches TV, listens to her CD&#39;s and talks <br/>
on the phone when her friends come home. She is in her second year at <br/>
home.&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds a lot like my dd!  REALLY! (And I LOVE math and LOVE to <br/>
read!)  (Go figure).   My dd is currently into World of Warcraft on <br/>
the computer (and, remember, deschooling BIG TIME!  It&#39;s VERY <br/>
important).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sturbridge village a million times)..I am not crafty, and barely <br/>
 </span></blockquote>got out of high school myself.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you live near Sturbridge?  We&#39;re going camping in Oakham (Pine <br/>
acres) Columbus Day weekend and plan to go there (never been!).   If <br/>
you DO live out that way, let me know, maybe we can connect!  <br/>
(seriously!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really got to get to bed as I&#39;m very tired today, but would love <br/>
to chat with you more.  Feel free to email me off list, and also in <br/>
the meantime, read past posts on this group.  I only heard about <br/>
unschooling about a year ago, started researching homeshooling 2+ yrs <br/>
ago (when I came across the word &quot;unschooling&quot; - I&#39;d never heard <br/>
about it before!).<br/>
<br/>
To be continued....<br/>

&gt; who never finshed <br/>
&gt; school? Does that make sense?? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  Unschooling isn&#39;t just not going to school or<br/>
just not finishing school.  Unschooling is an active<br/>
process.  Parents who unschool provide rich,<br/>
interesting environments for their children.  They are<br/>
constantly listening to their children, talking to<br/>
them, learning about them, providing for<br/>
them....parents who unschool are living joyful lives<br/>
with their children.<br/>
<br/>
So, if the person who doesn&#39;t finish school has an<br/>
environment like this, then yes, it can be similiar,<br/>
but generally, the person who didn&#39;t finish school<br/>
doesn&#39;t live a unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is the situation. I have a 12 yo that wants to<br/>
&gt; do NOTHING, and I <br/>
&gt; mean NOTHING. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I seriously doubt she literally does nothing -- but<br/>
since this is the way you see it, is it safe to say<br/>
that her choices are not pleasing to you?  Saying that<br/>
she is doing NOTHING is extremely negative, and I am<br/>
guessing that she knows you don&#39;t approve of her<br/>
&quot;nothing&quot; activities???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She HATES Math with a passion, she<br/>
&gt; HATES to read. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My guess is that she has either been in public school<br/>
or be doing school-at-home?  If so, I am not surprised<br/>
that she does hate these things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She takes Dance class twice a week. That&#39;s it.<br/>
&gt; How in the world can this child unschool, if she is<br/>
&gt; not interested in <br/>
&gt; doing anything? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But she is interested in things -- she takes dance,<br/>
she listens to CD&#39;s, she watches TV, she talks to her<br/>
friends about lots of things that interest her.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about finding so-called<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; things to do.  Unschooling is about<br/>
living a joyful life, with the freedom to pursue her<br/>
interests, regardless of whether they seem educational<br/>
or not.  Her interests right now may be just TV, CD&#39;s<br/>
and talking on the phone with friends.  There is<br/>
nothing wrong with that.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She thinks learning is a waste of<br/>
&gt; time. She really <br/>
&gt; could care less.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The teaching she has had forced on her has probably<br/>
been a waste of time and it makes sense that she could<br/>
care less.  I would too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have gone from strict textbook approach, to unit<br/>
&gt; studies, to <br/>

&gt; sleeps until 11:00, and lays around. I am ready to<br/>
&gt; send her back to <br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For unschooling to work for her, you -- as her parent<br/>
-- must learn as much as you can about how learning<br/>
works and about unschooling.  This list is a great<br/>
place to read and learn and there are several great<br/>
websites, such as: <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Way back when it was common -- especially out west -- to only go up  <br/>
to 4th grade or 8th grade or whatever. Those who went further were  <br/>
the ones who wanted to be teachers ;-) School wasn&#39;t seen as the  <br/>
passageway to success. It was a place to learn to read and learn  <br/>
arithmetic and get some other basic information about the world. Some  <br/>
teachers tried to give them more but it wasn&#39;t necessary information.<br/>
<br/>
Back then I&#39;d say that school was seen as one piece of learning. It  <br/>
was learning that was harder to get by living because not everyone  <br/>
had the skills or had access to books. That&#39;s no longer true today.  <br/>
We each have easy access to more information than they could have  <br/>
dreamed of back then. And schools are asked to take on the burden of  <br/>
cramming more information and skills into kids than they were  <br/>
designed to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so isn&#39;t unschooling similar to those who never finshed<br/>
&gt; school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only similar to those who have clarity of mind and recognize that  <br/>
school is a waste of time and they have better things to do and then  <br/>
go out and do them :-) But by and large people buy into the idea that:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can you get along in a doggy-dog<br/>
&gt; world like this one without a formal education?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so they feel demoralized if they don&#39;t succeed in school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not doing school. But it&#39;s a lot more than that. It&#39;s  <br/>
knowing that we learn a lot better by doing what we&#39;re interested in,  <br/>
by being exposed to the world than by being force fed information  <br/>
that experts tell us we&#39;ll need one day.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the way your daughter learned to speak English. It was  <br/>
a side effect of living. And it worked marvelously! School is the way  <br/>
kids &quot;learn&quot; Spanish in school. It&#39;s hard, it&#39;s boring and it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stick.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is the situation. I have a 12 yo that wants to do NOTHING, and I<br/>
&gt; mean NOTHING.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you mean she isn&#39;t doing anything that looks like school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling won&#39;t look like kids doing school work on their own. It  <br/>
looks like play.<br/>
<br/>
But what your daughter is doing right now isn&#39;t unschooling. It is  <br/>
*de*schooling. She needs downtime to recover from being forced to  <br/>
learn. Rule of thumb is 1 month for every month she was in school (or  <br/>
made to do school work). And, as Ren often points out, that resets if  <br/>
you breakdown and make her do some school work even for a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to feel down to her bones that she&#39;s free from restrictions  <br/>
and that you&#39;re happy that she&#39;s free and enjoying life. Celebrate  <br/>
life with her :-)<br/>
<br/>
If your husband had been insisting that you make German food for  <br/>
dinner every night of your marriage, and then he stopped how long  <br/>
would it take before you liked German food again? How long would it  <br/>
be before you didn&#39;t feel like he was going to start making you  <br/>
again? And if he slipped up and made you, what would that feel like?  <br/>
What if he didn&#39;t really want you to stop but heard if he gave you  <br/>
the choice that you&#39;d start making German food on your own? What if  <br/>
you knew he was watching and waiting for you to make a German meal  <br/>
and that everytime you made something else he was judging that you&#39;d  <br/>
come up short?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how your daughter feels. She needs to know that you aren&#39;t  <br/>
waiting for her to pick up a math book or pick up any book to read.<br/>
<br/>
Do things with her. Go to movies. Ask her if there&#39;s any music you  <br/>
should try. Read the lyrics and talk to her about them. Ask her what  <br/>
she likes about the groups. Go places that are not educational. Dog  <br/>
shows. Ethnic restaurants. Renaissance fair. Tractor pulls. Shopping  <br/>
in a town you&#39;ve never been to. Antique stores. Redecorate her room  <br/>
to *her* specifications. (Keep your mouth shut if she wants to paint  <br/>
the ceiling green. (I did when I was a teen :-) But set a budget and  <br/>
talk about it realistically.)<br/>
<br/>
The goal, of course, is to treat everything the same. A monster truck  <br/>
rally is no different than a Shakespeare play. it&#39;s either an  <br/>
interest or it&#39;s not. Rather than dividing the world into educational  <br/>
and play (or waste of time or fun), the world should be divided into  <br/>
&quot;of interest&quot; and &quot;not yet of interest&quot;. But she can&#39;t get there yet  <br/>
until she feels confident that everything that was in the &quot;waste of  <br/>
time&quot; category is just as important as everything that was in the  <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; category. To get there you need to be as happy that  <br/>
she&#39;s enjoying what she&#39;s doing right now as you&#39;d be if she was  <br/>
reading Shakespeare. Join her in her world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be she&#39;ll always hate those because they aren&#39;t natural  <br/>
interests. It could be that once she&#39;s confident she can learn  <br/>
something without it becoming a boring lesson, can stop when she  <br/>
likes, can pick it up when she likes and go no further than she  <br/>
wants, that she will like those. Right now you have to let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it like a broken leg on a world class runner. Wanting the  <br/>
runner to get back out running won&#39;t make the leg heal faster. It  <br/>
might in fact delay the healing because the runner would know she&#39;s  <br/>
disappointing you. And in fact she might start to feel that she&#39;s  <br/>
only worthwhile to you when she runs and if you can&#39;t see the worth  <br/>
in her without the running then maybe she doesn&#39;t want to run again  <br/>
ever.<br/>
<br/>
You need to see the worth in her right now. Appreciate the person she  <br/>
is right now. She needs to not feel that she&#39;ll only be worthwhile in  <br/>
your eyes when she&#39;s doing what you think is right.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband weighed and measured what you did  <br/>
against his own yardstick and you were only &quot;good&quot; when you did  <br/>
things he thought were worthwhile and you were disappointing when you  <br/>
did things he thought were wastes of time?<br/>
<br/>
A really good book for parents of teens is Parent/Teen Breakthrough:  <br/>
The relationship approach. Basically you can&#39;t influence her  <br/>
positively until she feels that her worth isn&#39;t tied to the choices  <br/>
she makes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She<br/>
&gt; sleeps until 11:00, and lays around. I am ready to send her back to<br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent the entire summer after my freshman year in college watching  <br/>
HBO. Hours and hours of movies. Often the same movie over and over  <br/>
since they had so few in rotation. It wouldn&#39;t have made me need to  <br/>
recover less if someone had decided I needed to go back to school to  <br/>
stop watching TV. I needed to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids or adults who do not have an education, will not go<br/>
&gt; far in this world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone has to believe that. We couldn&#39;t have forced ourselves to do  <br/>
what we did in school without going mad if we didn&#39;t stuff down the  <br/>
voices that said &quot;This is a ridiculous waste of time!&quot; and listened  <br/>
to the voices that said &quot;Experts know better. Just do what they say  <br/>
and everything will be fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We do not live in an area that has many museums,<br/>
&gt; or artsy stuff, or educational things(unless we want to visit<br/>
&gt; Sturbridge village a million times)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think so big. Look first at your daughter. Look at her  <br/>
interests and help her expand from there. Rather than trying to get  <br/>
stuff into her, help her reach out and pull in the things she wants.  <br/>
Be her partner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87246906">Joyce, that was a wonderful response.  I&#39;ve just been browsing your <br/>
site and I&#39;m going to send the address to my very own questioners and <br/>
doubters for reference.  Lots of great information!  <br/>
<br/>
We are also new to unschooling and I spend many late nights <br/>
researching different homeschool methods and whatnot and found that we <br/>
already were unschoolers by virtue of our lifestyle.  Our DS, 16, has <br/>
spend his deschooling time watching tv, playing runescape, fixing his <br/>
bike, doing electrical repairs on thrift store lamps(I had to have <br/>
them), watching The History Channel, staying up til ungodly hours, and <br/>
sometimes doing &quot;nothing&quot;, and we as a family couldn&#39;t be happier for <br/>
him.  This is a great learning experience for all of us as we had to <br/>
have trust and patience and open our minds and hearts and just let <br/>
him &quot;be&quot;.</div>

I know you from the MHLA list!! I live in Palmer, right outside of Sturbridge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read. All <br/>

home.&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds a lot like my dd!  REALLY! (And I LOVE math and LOVE to <br/>

you DO live out that way, let me know, maybe we can connect!  <br/>
(seriously!)<br/>
*We camped at PIne Acres all the time!! Oakham is only about 40 minutes from <br/>
here!! I would LOVE to try and connect!! It would be nice to have my dd talk <br/>
to another unschooler her age. I would LOVE to chat with you more!!! Please <br/>
email me off list if you want as well. I am sure you will see me on here quitre a <br/>
bit as I ask more questions and gather more information. I am curious though, <br/>
for those who live in MA, how you write an &quot;Unschool&quot; Ed Plan, and normally, <br/>
what method of evaluation one chooses when Unschooling. We had chosen to Test <br/>
these past two years, but I will assume that Unschoolers choose a Narrative <br/>
Report? Thanks for your help!!*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095740558">This was interesting..<br/>
I never thought of it the way you put it down below.<br/>
<br/>
Wondering, how do Unschoolers fare in College? How do they know upper level <br/>
Math if they never formally learned it?<br/>
What about upper level Sciences?<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there are some people on this list who can share what a <br/>
&quot;typical&quot; unschooling day looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Also..If I were decide to just &quot;let it go&quot; and just let my dd pursue her <br/>
interests. Do I mention this to her? What do I say to her? Nothing? Something? <br/>
What have all of you done when you decided to Unschool? DId you tell you children?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again<br/>
Cindy  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what your daughter is doing right now isn&#39;t unschooling. It is  <br/>
*de*schooling. She needs downtime to recover from being forced to  <br/>
learn. Rule of thumb is 1 month for every month she was in school (or  <br/>
made to do school work). And, as Ren often points out, that resets if  <br/>
you breakdown and make her do some school work even for a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to feel down to her bones that she&#39;s free from restrictions  <br/>
and that you&#39;re happy that she&#39;s free and enjoying life. Celebrate  <br/>
life with her :-)<br/>
<br/>
If your husband had been insisting that you make German food for  <br/>
dinner every night of your marriage, and then he stopped how long  <br/>
would it take before you liked German food again? How long would it  <br/>
be before you didn&#39;t feel like he was going to start making you  <br/>
again? And if he slipped up and made you, what would that feel like?  <br/>
What if he didn&#39;t really want you to stop but heard if he gave you  <br/>
the choice that you&#39;d start making German food on your own? What if  <br/>
you knew he was watching and waiting for you to make a German meal  <br/>
and that everytime you made something else he was judging that you&#39;d  <br/>
come up short?<br/>

From: shepelec2002 &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pscs@...">pscs@...</a>&gt;<br/>
 I will be open and blunt <br/>
since I want to learn all I can about Unschooling. <br/>
*********<br/>
 <br/>
You might see the same kinds of responses! Brace yourself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But we DO like to hang around people who &quot;want to learn all about unschooling!&quot;<br/>
*********<br/>
<br/>
I have read several books on Unschooling, including the teenage <br/>
liberation hand book.<br/>
 <br/>
*******<br/>
 <br/>
Please add the brand new _Parenting A Free Child: An Unschooled Life_ <br/>
by Rue Kream to your list. Rue&#39;s a moderator and a regular poster on this list. She&#39;s <br/>
compiled a bunch of questions that we&#39;ve read over and over and put them---with answers---in<br/>
a beautiful book. <br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_ should be on your list as well.<br/>
 <br/>
*******<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is one of my questions(I hope it makes sense)..way back long <br/>
ago, there were lots of children who did not finish &quot;school&quot;. Dropped <br/>
out in 6th, 7th or 8th grade. I will assume that most of these <br/>
children went on to help around the home, or helping out in a family <br/>
situation. And you always here &quot;I only had an 8th grade <br/>
education&quot;....so isn&#39;t unschooling similar to those who never finshed <br/>
school? Does that make sense??<br/>
*****<br/>
Hmmmm... *Can be*. Depends on the &quot;drop-out&#39;s&quot; attitude. If he leaves school and <br/>
thinks he&#39;s stupid and that learning sucks, well....no that&#39;s not the same thing. IF, <br/>
on the other hand, he leaves with his sense of self intact (often hard to do---all that<br/>
societal stigma of &quot;uneducated&quot;) and with a burning desire to learn more and do more and <br/>
BE more---well, he&#39;ll be just fine---in fact, probably *better* than the child who stays <br/>
in school--- struggling and suffering &#39;til the bitter end.<br/>
************<br/>
 How can you get along in a doggy-dog <br/>
world like this one without a formal education?<br/>
 <br/>
********<br/>
 <br/>
If you look at the world as &quot;dog-eat-dog,&quot; that could be an issue. We see the world as a place<br/>
FULL of wonderful, interesting, awe-inspiring things to be touched, viewed, poked, examined, <br/>
and enjoyed.<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
Here is the situation. I have a 12 yo that wants to do NOTHING, and I <br/>
mean NOTHING. She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read. All <br/>
she does is sits around and watches TV, listens to her CD&#39;s and talks <br/>
on the phone when her friends come home. She is in her second year at <br/>
home. I pulled teeth with her last year, and this year it is the same <br/>
thing. <br/>
*******<br/>
First question: What do *YOU* do?<br/>
Second question: What do 12 year olds DO? They are *very* interested in cultural/social <br/>
situations/interactions. They DO listen to music a lot. They DO watch a lot of tv. They DO <br/>
talk on the phone with their friends a lot. They DO want to hang out with peers. THAT&#39;S WHAT <br/>
12 YEAR OLDS DO! They do MORE of that when they are denied other things they want to do.<br/>
 <br/>
They are *just now* starting to be able to assert themselves. At 12, many are just about <br/>
as tall as their parents (if not taller!). They are old enough to know that they can use the <br/>
same tactics on *you* that were used on *them*! Think about that! <br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
She takes Dance class twice a week. That&#39;s it.<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
Well, that&#39;s MORE than CDs, tv, and phone time. <br/>
Can she take MORE dance classes?<br/>
*******<br/>
<br/>
How in the world can this child unschool, if she is not interested in <br/>
doing anything? She thinks learning is a waste of time. She really <br/>
could care less.<br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s NOT UNschooling. She&#39;s still DEschooling. This is the hardest time in the whole <br/>
process. She could stay in this funk for a long, long time. Hell, most schooled kids stay in <br/>
it their entire LIVES! They become adults with no interests other than tv and football. <br/>
Start ENJOYING her! Rent movies together---do a vertical of Johnny Depp. Rent Ferris Bueller&#39;s <br/>
Day Off---GREAT Unschooling movie! &lt;G&gt; Encourage her to stay in her pj&#39;s all day. Order pizza <br/>
for lunch and watch movies all day---WITH HER! Let her pick them out. No fair pushing <br/>
Shakespeare if she doesn&#39;t want that. Be prepared for a day of horror flicks! &lt;bwg&gt; Have FUN!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Paint each others&#39; nails and toes---even if you don&#39;t usually. Pretend that *YOU* are 12 <br/>
again!<br/>
 *********<br/>
We have gone from strict textbook approach, to unit studies, to trying to to just watch educational videos and read alouds. Nope. She sleeps until 11:00, and lays around. I am ready to send her back to school.<br/>
 <br/>
********<br/>
 <br/>
She doesn&#39;t trust you. THAT&#39;S what you need to work on now. Your relationship. Screw everything else! <br/>
 <br/>
OH! And all that sleeping? Two things: 1) she&#39;s healing---that&#39;s what happens when we sleep; our bodies heal themselves. and 2) she&#39;s growing---this is a time of HUGE growth---both physically and mentally. She NEEDS sleep---desperately! <br/>
 <br/>
*********<br/>
 <br/>
I WANT to believe in child led learning. But I cannot get it out of my head that kids or adults who do not have an education, will not go far in this world. <br/>
 <br/>
******<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s *your* problem that you&#39;ll have to come to terms with. *YOU* had an education. How far have *YOU* gone?<br/>
 <br/>
I find it hysterical that professional athletes and actors are always hollering, &quot;Stay in school!&quot; Right---the two professions MOST likely to have ditched school. Cracks me up!<br/>
 <br/>
Basically, the saying, &quot;Do what you love; the money will follow&quot; is spot on. Passions can take you much, much further than *ANY* curriculum!<br/>
 <br/>
*********<br/>
 <br/>
 We do not live in an area that has many museums, or artsy stuff, or educational things(unless we want to visit Sturbridge village a million times)..I am not crafty, and barely got out of high school myself.<br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
Whinewhinewhine. NO ONE lives in the perfect spot. Country people bitch about no culture. City folk bitch about no animals/nature. Suburbanites bitch about it all. Quit bitching and enjoy what you *have*! Plant a butterfly garden. Tile your bathroom. Volunteer at wildlife rescue.<br/>
 <br/>
MAKE your own museum! MAKE your own art (see the ATCs---Ren? a link? We have been having SOOO much fun with these lately! )! And hell---EVERYTHING is educational!<br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If someone can offer me a direction here and I would greatly appreciate it. <br/>
 <br/>
*******<br/>
 <br/>
We need to model for our children what we&#39;d like to see in them. BE fun. Be creative. BE interesting. DO things. She&#39;ll follow. Slowly, at first, but she&#39;ll follow. Then she&#39;ll spurt ahead of you so fast, you won&#39;t know what happened! Take pictures! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206529757">&lt;&lt;I want to believe in child led learning...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that you haven&#39;t seen it yet.  What you have been trying to do is have your child do &quot;adult led learning&quot; but on her own.  Child led learning looks very, very different than school.  In fact, it looks pretty much nothing like school ....at least until your child and you have thoroughly, thoroughly de-schooled yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
You posted that your child isn&#39;t interested in learning....tell her fine.  Blow it off.  Quit worrying about if learning is happening.  Just have fun, play, go to the beach, cook Indonesian food, spend time with older relatives hearing stories from their youth, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Many people ruin their attempts at unschooling because they keep trying to make sure learning is happening.  A child expresses an interest in horses and first thing you know, the parents have them hip-deep in documentaries, experiments, etc..  Sure fire way to quash an interest.<br/>
<br/>
Another big stumbling block is to take something fun...like the zoo and turn it into a lesson.  The schools do this with papers the kids must fill out about each exhibit.  Really, truly, quit worrying about the learning.  As long as the kids are having fun, they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
Now about getting a job without a diploma.....lots of jobs don&#39;t require a diploma, lots of others you can just go get a GED in a few months at most and take off.  You can do that to go to college.  <br/>
<br/>
You can spend 12 years in school, 4 in college and still not have a clue what you want to do.  I figure it is best to figure out what you want to do then do what you need to get the training to do that job.  It might be college, it might be technical school, it might be an apprenticeship, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I have a HS diploma and graduated college with honors.  I have a Master&#39;s degree in Clinical Psychology and have no interest in pursuing that field anymore.  (When I just wanted to say &quot;quit whining&quot; to a client, I figured it was time to move on &lt;grin&gt;).  I am looking into training as a massage therapist and midwife, neither of which require hs diploma both can be fairly lucrative.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945133676">&lt;&lt;pursuing her interests&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hold a big talk with your daughter about the joys of unschooling.  I would simply say &quot;yes&quot; to her as much as I could comfortably do and then I would quietly question myself about the extent of my comfort envelope.  I would strive to stretch it as far and wide as possible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;formal math&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids.  My oldest wants to go to college.  She is 14 and highly traditional.  She researched the college she wants to attend, looked at their admission policies in regards to homeschoolers and decided her best chance to go there was with a traditional transcript...so she started taking some classes with tutors.  She arranges it, makes sure her work is done, etc..  It is her deal.  It has nothing to do with me other than my giving moral support.  She is described by her tutors as a &quot;fantastic student&quot; even though she hasn&#39;t had any formal schooling since the age of 7.  It really isn&#39;t rocket science.<br/>
<br/>
I would be real surprised if any other of the kids wanted to go to college.  But they all understand the basics of algebra theory just by living life and none of them is over the age of 12.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;typical day&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We get up about 7:00... have breakfast... the kids feed their many, many animals...we check on the eggs in the incubator...I take Marsie to horseback riding...I check emails while Zach tries to figure out how to fry bologna for a sandwich...Dan and Michelle play on the trampoline while Adriane is finishing her Spanish lessons...we have lunch...Adriane and I clip hooves on the goats...a friend of Dan&#39;s comes over and they play Pokemon...Marsie makes cookies...Michelle and Zach help me in the garden...I take Adriane to gymnastics...the other kids watch a cartoon or two on tv...I milk the goats and we all help with dinner...dh is home and we go for a walk...I go get Adriane from gymnastics...the kids all have a massage and a bath and head off for bed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Remember Field of Dreams? &quot;If you build it they will come&quot; Well, If <br/>
they want it they will do it. IF (big IF) a person (child or adult) <br/>
wants for whatever reason OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING to explore algebra <br/>
or phyics or the life cycle of the Luna moth, they will do what it <br/>
takes to get there. An unschooled-from-birth young man who grew up <br/>
not far from me (I never met him, he was already in college before <br/>
DS was a toddler) graduated with flying colors from a private <br/>
university with a double major, worked a job, had an apartment in <br/>
Manhattan... sounds a lot more &#39;life-like&#39; than when I was in <br/>
college doing enough to pass and partying the weekends <br/>
away... &quot;upper level&quot; math and &quot;upper level&quot; science - I&#39;m guessing <br/>
you probably took them in high school. How much of it do you use? <br/>
How much do you even remember? (unless of course you are a working <br/>
professional engineer or something - then you probably use some and <br/>
LOOK UP a lot of it in tables and use a computer and/or calculator a <br/>
bunch). The point is, IF it is needed, the entire typical K-12 &#39;math <br/>
curriculum&#39; in the typical school district can be absorbed WHEN the <br/>
interest is there, in a summer. really. <br/>
<br/>
As far as what you should do - say Yes a lot. Can we go pick up all <br/>
Johnny Depp&#39;s movies? Yes - (as many as we can afford right now/as <br/>
many as they have in stock/as many as we can carry/whatever). To <br/>
the &#39;unspoken&#39; requests (like sleeping until noon), don&#39;t say <br/>
anything - find something to do yourself (quietly) and leave it be. <br/>
Teenagers (and preteens) NEED almost as much sleep as a newborn, <br/>
that&#39;s how much growth physically and developmentally is going on. <br/>
Coupled with a shift in melatonin production, their sleep schedules <br/>
shift around (thus the ability of college students to pull all-<br/>
nighters) often leaving them wide awake at 2 am and fast asleep at 2 <br/>
pm. Even *public schools* in many areas acknowldege this and are <br/>
trying to work out ways to shift the high school schedules a little <br/>
later in the day.<br/>
<br/>
DS is only 7 but here&#39;s roughly what a day looks like:<br/>
<br/>
I get up, feed the dog, and go to work (arriving at my desk between <br/>
7:30 and 8:00). DH is sometimes up when I leave, sometimes just <br/>
waking. DS is usually asleep still (but not always, this morning he <br/>
was up before I left). Typically, DH and DS will play a round of <br/>
computer/video games (currently Age of Empires and StarCraft are <br/>
big - network computer gaming - DS has a desktop and an old laptop <br/>
so he can be closer to wherever DH is with his nice new laptop - for <br/>
instance, this morning when I called around 9:30, DH was playing <br/>
against the computer in Age of Empires and DS was running the <br/>
terrain editor module which is used to design the playing field - <br/>
you can add mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, etc). Somewhere <br/>
between 9 and 10 roughly, they&#39;ll eat something. DS will head off to <br/>
watch TV or play while DH handles a household task (dishes, start <br/>
some laundry, whatever). Then they&#39;ll probably play some more - this <br/>
time maybe 007 Nightfire on the PS2. Additional household stuff <br/>
might happen - more loads of laundry if it&#39;s laundry day (DH does <br/>
the whole week&#39;s worth at one time so he can ignore it for the rest <br/>
of the week). They might go out to a park...or not. Fridays they <br/>
spend the afternoon at a homeschooling friend&#39;s house - their 3 boys <br/>
and DS go run around and play while DH and the mom play Scrabble and <br/>
Rummikub. So, generically, the afternoon is playing. I get home, <br/>
feed the dog (unless DS has already done it or wants to do it once <br/>
I&#39;m home), we have dinner. Sometimes DS eats at the table, sometimes <br/>
he chooses to take it to a stack table in the living room if he&#39;s <br/>
mid-stream of watching something. After dinner, we might watch a <br/>
movie together or they might play more and I&#39;ll read or watch a <br/>
movie. We might go out and run an errand of some sort. During the <br/>
summer, Friday nights were spent at the drive in near us (yup we&#39;re <br/>
lucky enough to have a double feature showing, 3 screen drive in <br/>
about 15 minutes away). Around 9:30 or 10, I head to bed. They&#39;ll <br/>
usually head that way soon after. We may read, watch TV, whatever as <br/>
the day winds down. I&#39;m usually first asleep and they finish the <br/>
game, movie, TV program and drift off to sleep. Sometimes DH and I <br/>
will both be mostly asleep and DS will go to his room to read or <br/>
draw or play on his desktop computer for a while before coming back <br/>
in to snuggle and fall asleep. It&#39;s about 50/50 whether I&#39;ll <br/>
actually wake up enough to walk him back to his bed later (odds are <br/>
higher in the sticky humid summer weather than in the cold winter - <br/>
he&#39;s a nice handy little space heater!) And so it goes. <br/>
<br/>
Did you note that he might go read? He&#39;s 7. Never been to school. <br/>
Never had a formal &#39;lesson&#39; or curriculum. Yet he reads. When we <br/>
were in the car the other day, he merrily spent time doubling <br/>
numbers - 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, then he got a little stuck so <br/>
I filled in 1600, he did 3200, then we were at our destination. He <br/>
can also determine whether something is odd or even. And so on -<br/>
 &quot;math stuff&quot; - again, without any formal &#39;schooling&#39; in any form. <br/>
Lots of questions, answers, discussions, explorations. We decided <br/>
pretty much when he was born that we&#39;d unschool. So we didn&#39;t <br/>
have &#39;transitional&#39; issues to deal with. We&#39;ve just lived life all <br/>
along.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634087990">You can spend 12 years in school, 4 in college and still not have a clue what <br/>
you want to do.  I figure it is best to figure out what you want to do then <br/>
do what you need to get the training to do that job.  It might be college, it <br/>
might be technical school, it might be an apprenticeship, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
*This is so true. I spent 12 years in school, and 1 year in College and hated <br/>
all of it.*<br/>

I remember this movie well. Actually, I just watched it a few weeks ago for <br/>
the first time. As far as any math&#39;s or sciences, I especially do not remember <br/>
any upper level Math because I hated it. Science, I do remember quite a bit, <br/>
because I enjoyed it. I do not use it, but I can remember it. BUT, that is <br/>
because it was my area of interest only. The more I read here, the more I am <br/>
realizing.*<br/>

Remember Field of Dreams? &quot;If you build it they will come&quot; Well, If <br/>
they want it they will do it. IF (big IF) a person (child or adult) <br/>
wants for whatever reason OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING to explore algebra <br/>
or phyics or the life cycle of the Luna moth, they will do what it <br/>
takes to get there. An unschooled-from-birth young man who grew up <br/>
not far from me (I never met him, he was already in college before <br/>
DS was a toddler) graduated with flying colors from a private <br/>
university with a double major, worked a job, had an apartment in <br/>
Manhattan... sounds a lot more &#39;life-like&#39; than when I was in <br/>
college doing enough to pass and partying the weekends <br/>
away... &quot;upper level&quot; math and &quot;upper level&quot; science - I&#39;m guessing <br/>
you probably took them in high school. How much of it do you use? <br/>
How much do you even remember? (unless of course you are a working <br/>
professional engineer or something - then you probably use some and <br/>
LOOK UP a lot of it in tables and use a computer and/or calculator a <br/>
bunch). The point is, IF it is needed, the entire typical K-12 &#39;math <br/>
curriculum&#39; in the typical school district can be absorbed WHEN the <br/>
interest is there, in a summer. really. <br/>
