<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729576929">Has anyone got any experience with patenting a game/puzzle concept? <br/>
My ds has an idea, made a prototype, and ultimately wants to market<br/>
this idea.  (I think it has possibilities.)  But I don&#39;t have any<br/>
experience in any of this sort of thing, and don&#39;t know how best to<br/>
guide him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575886018">I used to work as a Patent Examiner for the USPTO. My mother is still there. We were both in chemistry/biology so I can&#39;t help you with the technical side but applying is all the same. You can file an application yourself, which is much cheaper, but because of the atmosphere in the office you&#39;ll have way more luck getting a patent if you have an agent or attorney. Agenst are generally cheaper because they don&#39;t have law degrees and can&#39;t give legal advice. They&#39;ve put a lot of stuff online since I left. I think you can file all your papers electronically now. Check out their website. <br/>
   <br/>
  I can give you more practical info about the process and what you&#39;ll need to do to actually get a patent (which is a lot more complicated than just disclosing your invention).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182563274">Thanks for the insider view!  I relayed that to my ds (or rather,<br/>
showed him, as he is at the &#39;puter next to me!)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found some books at the library earlier today, which he curled<br/>
up with for a while.  Learning new things all the time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049640742">I believe it was Caren on this or another list that was asking about <br/>
patents and we emailed privately and I&#39;ll paste here what I emailed <br/>
her about.  I tried to email you this directly, but your email was <br/>
private...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing your patent question with my husband and had some <br/>
more insight.  The U.S. is a &quot;first to invent&quot; country with respect <br/>
to intellectual property.  Some other countries are &quot;first to file&quot;.  <br/>
In the ftf countries, your idea can get &quot;stolen&quot; by someone simply <br/>
beating you to the country&#39;s patent office.  This can&#39;t happen in the <br/>
U.S and other fti countries, as long as you do basic things to <br/>
protect your idea.<br/>
<br/>
The first is documentation.  If you have not already done so, write <br/>
down as explicitly as possible how and when you came up with this <br/>
idea.  Your &quot;priority date&quot; won&#39;t be that day that you &quot;invented&quot; the <br/>
idea, but the day you document it.  (As long as your priority date is <br/>
before anyone else claiming the same idea, you win out). Make the <br/>
document complete, sign it, and have someone (anyone who can <br/>
understand the idea) read over it and date and sign it too.  For <br/>
added oomph, you can have the document notarized.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is the issue of &quot;diligence&quot;.  This means that you can&#39;t <br/>
come up with an idea, document it, put it in a drawer and do nothing <br/>
for 10 years and sue someone who patents the same idea and makes <br/>
money later, even if you had an earlier priority date.  The purpose <br/>
of the U.S. patent system is to encourage innovation for the <br/>
production of products/services that will better our society, so you <br/>
get protection, but only on the condition you don&#39;t shelve it to look <br/>
for an opportunity to prey on someone who went beyond just thinking <br/>
about the idea.  Diligence means that you are regularly (not <br/>
necessarily exhaustively or constantly, but regularly) pursuing your <br/>
idea.  This could be by refining or making improvements, phone calls <br/>
to potential companies to market it, off shoots of the idea, business <br/>
contacts, etc.  You should document any time you make any forward <br/>
progress on the invention or the pursuit of its commercialization or <br/>
improvement and always date, sign and witness.  As long as you <br/>
practice original documentation of the idea and diligence your idea <br/>
is protected--until disclosure.<br/>
<br/>
Public disclosure means telling someone (especially an interested <br/>
company) about your idea without a non-disclosure agreement (which <br/>
would be private).  Most companies wouldn&#39;t sign a non-disclosure <br/>
agreement because of the legal hassle that would arise if they <br/>
previously had the same idea.  So, a company you approach may listen <br/>
to your idea, but not under a secrecy agreement.  Once a disclosure <br/>
of this nature occurs (or, in science you give a talk at a conference <br/>
or write a paper, which is the most common example of public <br/>
disclosure), you have ONE YEAR to file a patent.  This could be a <br/>
cheap short provisional patent filed by you, a patent agent (cheaper <br/>
than an attorney), or attorney.  After a provisional is filed, you <br/>
have one year to file a full patent that would be reviewed by the <br/>
USPTO.  Provisionals aren&#39;t reviewed by the USPTO, they are basically <br/>
a placeholder that sets a priority date and provides documentation of <br/>
the invention, but as I said above, less formal documentation is just <br/>
as powerful as long as you sign, date, and witness everything.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this all makes sense.  My husband and I would do the <br/>
following in your situation:<br/>
1.  Document your idea as clearly and completely as possible.  <br/>
Include dates and the reasoning and motivation behind the idea.  Date <br/>
the document (don&#39;t backdate it to when you had the idea--it would be <br/>
the first thing that would invalidate your protection if it ever <br/>
could be proven).  Sign and have a witness read, sign and date.  A <br/>
patent attorney would ask for any of this documentation if you were <br/>
to file anyways, so it&#39;ll save you trouble.<br/>
2.  Keep the idea a secret from everyone to avoid starting the <br/>
disclosure clock ticking.  You have one year to file a patent from <br/>
when you tell someone about it, although competitors and business <br/>
folks are the only ones you&#39;d really have to worry about, since they <br/>
would be the only ones that may try to invalidate your patent for <br/>
breaking that rule.<br/>
3.  Document all improvements, additions, changes to your idea as <br/>
well as dates of disclosure, meetings, any time you read something or <br/>
find more information.  The easiest thing to do is to have a kind <br/>
of &quot;lab notebook&quot; with permanently bound pages (not spiral) and don&#39;t <br/>
skip or tear out pages.  This proves dates, sequentiality, etc for <br/>
documentation.<br/>
<br/>
If you approach a company with your idea, as I said before, they <br/>
probably won&#39;t agree to secrecy, so that would start the one year <br/>
clock ticking FOR SURE.  Approaching the company with an idea for <br/>
their product is a reasonable idea and sometimes is fruitful.  Just <br/>
have all your documentation and make sure they know how diligent you <br/>
have been in your documentation and pursuit--simply be organized.  If <br/>
they love your idea, they may offer to &quot;buy&quot; it off you by helping <br/>
you patent it (where you are listed as an inventor and they are <br/>
listed as the owner) and then offering you payment or even a royalty <br/>
of x% of sales of the repackaged product.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is named as inventor on over a dozen patents.  He has lots <br/>
of experience, but we have learned a valuable lesson.  Running out to <br/>
file a patent before all else is a &quot;rookie mistake&quot; for inventors.  <br/>
99.5+% of all granted patents don&#39;t make any money (doesn&#39;t even <br/>
include ones filed and not pursued further or those rejected).  The <br/>
only people getting rich in the patent game are patent lawyers!  Most <br/>
people don&#39;t know any of the above and don&#39;t realize that appropriate <br/>
documentation and diligence give you just as much protection, without <br/>
having to go out on a personal financial limb for something that may <br/>
not be marketable or practical or of interest to anyone, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to a patent agent/lawyer, they are naturally going to tell <br/>
you to file a patent, their bread and butter.  If you take this <br/>
route, I wouldn&#39;t do more than a provisional before getting better <br/>
indications that there are companies interested.  You&#39;d then have a <br/>
year after a provisional to file a full patent and spend the big $$.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears the waters more than muddying them for you, <br/>
Julie M<br/>
