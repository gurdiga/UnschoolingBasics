I don&#39;t think working parents are bad,not at all. Been there,done that. In my initial comment I was stating that I found it sad that most people knew people who had put their kids in full time daycare from 6 months up. I just dont know anyone who did that. I work from home, I wish I could afford to work at a job outside the home! LOL<br/>
