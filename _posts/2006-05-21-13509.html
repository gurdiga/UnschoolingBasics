socialable and outgoing.  Often shares stuff but not always.  It&#39;s<br/>
just him.  Not many 2 year olds do that.  Naturally he always has<br/>

mellinia (particularly from Asia, Europe and the Middle East), children once<br/>
they became old enough to follow mom around became workers, especially in<br/>
the middle and lower classes.  Playtime was something that everyone did, not<br/>
just children and it was different from what we see as playtime today.<br/>
Before children could follow mom on their own they were worn or carried by<br/>
their mothers or older siblings or other family members or they were left<br/>
cradled (or worse swaddled).  Children as young as 2 or 3 years old were<br/>
already helping with tasks that they could do.  Modern children have far<br/>
more playtime than their ancient and medieval counterparts.  And when they<br/>
did play in groups the children in the group could vary in age from toddlers<br/>
to pre-teens. I stand by what I say that playgroups as we do them today are<br/>
unatural!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would be asking why the child didn&#39;t enjoy the activity.  And perhaps in a<br/>
child&#39;s eye, being home with mom is WAY more fun than playgroup.  Perhas the<br/>
child doesn&#39;t like being around lots of other people, despite seeming to<br/>
have a good time.  I have a child who really doesn&#39;t care for large groups.<br/>
She likes more intimate relationships with one or two people.  She always<br/>
only has one or two true friends which has been a problem in the past when a<br/>
friend has had to move away or gotten interests elsewhere and quit<br/>
socialising with her.  She&#39;ll go to our weekly playgroups and appears to<br/>
have a good time, but really would prefer if she could have a friend over to<br/>
her house or go over to a friend&#39;s house where it is just the two of them<br/>
than go to a place where there are tons of other people.  At 2.5 she may not<br/>
be able to voice why she does or doesn&#39;t like something.  I would give her<br/>
the option of whether to go or not.  &quot;It&#39;s playgroup day.  Do you want to go<br/>
or is there something else you would prefer to do?&quot;<br/>

Do they all want to be there? It&#39;s called making the best of things.  <br/>
It&#39;s a coping mechanism for when you don&#39;t have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked her beforehand if she wants to go? Do you give her the  <br/>
option of choosing when to leave, even if it&#39;s just five minutes? Did  <br/>
you ask her why she didn&#39;t have a good time? What she didn&#39;t like?  <br/>
Often kids assume they have to take the whole package deal and don&#39;t  <br/>
realize parts can be changed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son has always been like this.  He has trouble transitioning <br/>
between things.  It was much worse when he was below the age of 7 <br/>
years old.  No matter how much fun he had doing something, when it <br/>
was time to transition away, he&#39;d focus on that only and swear he <br/>
felt horrid the entire time.  Over the years we&#39;ve learned ways to <br/>
help.  He&#39;s almost 10 now, and one thing that is really helpful is <br/>
letting him know exactly what time something will begin and end.  He <br/>
loves facts and hates surprises.  That&#39;s just his personality <br/>
style.  I&#39;m a bit like that myself.  My mom used to tease me around <br/>
the holidays about my presents and it was sheer torture.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
believe me when I told her upsetting it was.  As an adult, I was <br/>
able to explain it better and she was genuinely surprised to hear <br/>
that I was really upset by that behavior.  Jeffrey is the same way.  <br/>
He gives me his wish list for Christmas or his birthday and then we <br/>
don&#39;t discuss it until the day he&#39;s opening gifts!  And he&#39;s happy <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
So while things may seem a bit strained now, hopefully they&#39;ll <br/>
improve as he grows older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944099148">I asked my father (a traditional parent)  this question and his<br/>
response was fairly enlightening, though the communication ability of<br/>
your child may make a difference in how effective his answer is.<br/>
First he said that if you just disregarded the physical signs and<br/>
followed the spoken answer you would be &quot;teaching the child a lesson.&quot;<br/>
 (Not something I think any of us would aim to do.)  Then he suggested<br/>
getting more detail from the child... &quot;do you remember when you were<br/>
laughing about...&quot;,  &quot;were you having a good time when you were...&quot;<br/>
type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
For my 23-month-old son at least, it&#39;s often difficult for him to<br/>
fully understand the implications of the questions we ask him.  Often<br/>
we get the same answer (yes or no) when we ask the question in the<br/>
opposite direction, which is our first step to making sure he<br/>
understood what we were asking (e.g. &quot;Do you want to go out?&quot;<br/>
followed by &quot;Do you want to stay home?&quot; or the like, whatever options<br/>
we see as being available).  Rewording the question (or looking for<br/>
more options) until we get a differentiation between the options is a<br/>
challenge, sometimes, but we don&#39;t feel we&#39;ve got a true answer until<br/>
we do get a differentiation in the answer (which may be the same<br/>
answer, but with a different tone... difficult to explain).<br/>
<br/>
Also, with our son, his way of saying yes, a very excited &quot;AH-ha&quot;, is<br/>
something we&#39;ve all at times found amusing.  His no&#39;s are more shaking<br/>
his head and a subtle &quot;uh-uh&quot;, used most often when we ask him to<br/>
bring something to us.  So, he will often &quot;say&quot; yes when he doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily mean it because he knows we love his manner of saying yes.<br/>
 So, we&#39;ve made it (by our early responses) more necessary to<br/>
double-check his answer to make sure he knows what we&#39;re asking.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that your child had a great time and it&#39;s possible they<br/>
truly didn&#39;t.  I&#39;d certainly want to explore the question more and not<br/>
leave it at one question/answer.<br/>

<br/>
  On the news last night (which I watched to find out the updates on <br/>
Barbaro!), one of the reporters was in Africa. With Bono.<br/>
<br/>
  He had footage (and this really sad voice) about a seven year old girl <br/>
who *had* to fix her family food every day---ground up meal made into a <br/>
dough and then fried. He made it out to be soooo terrible (not the <br/>
food, but the idea that the child cooked). That the child had &quot;old&quot; <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, she may have a terrible, terrible life. But all we got was that <br/>
one shot of her making supper. &quot;Just think,&quot; he said, &quot;of what <br/>
*American* girls at seven would be doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  But I was thinking that if *that* was the worst of it, it&#39;s not that <br/>
damned bad!<br/>
<br/>
  She was doing real work that made a difference in her life---and her <br/>
family&#39;s. She was certainly capable.<br/>
<br/>
  It just made me think about how we impose our western ideals and <br/>
lifestyles onto others. Children in other cultures often contribute to <br/>
the working household. They want to be a part of it and feel needed. To <br/>
*me* this child was making a difference. I bet she was proud of what <br/>
she did.<br/>
<br/>
 The reporter made it out to be horrible that she would have to!<br/>
<br/>
 Different cultures...<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 I would be asking why the child didn&#39;t enjoy the activity.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d ask the child why too. I&#39;d also ask whether she wanted to go <br/>
before I took her back again---and that could change each time. Offer <br/>
something equally enticing---see which one she picks.<br/>

cooking, bill preparing, getting ready for school and tending to her<br/>
alcoholic drug addicted mother.  My niece had a very tough childhood and by<br/>
age 7 was doing all the things her mother should have been doing.<br/>
Unfortunately, this is not uncommon!  Perhaps we could do a commercial that<br/>
shows the same going on right here in America and then show some children in<br/>

my relationship with my mentally ill mom (and alot like your  <br/>
niece...how I wish someone had saved me!) . However, my seven yo  <br/>
loves to cook. She makes everyone&#39;s breakfast if she gets up first.  <br/>
Nearly every day she makes a snack or dessert. Yesterday it was  <br/>
homemade nilla wafers and homemade banana pudding. She has so much  <br/>
joy when she can get in the kitchen and starting measuring and  <br/>
mixing! And lots of satisfaction when she gets to serve it to her  <br/>
friends and family. So stuff I resented doing (and still do today) is  <br/>
stuff that she begs to do!<br/>

&gt; Hmmm.  I can think of one girl who at 7 was doing all the  <br/>
&gt; housekeeping,<br/>
&gt; cooking, bill preparing, getting ready for school and tending to her<br/>
&gt; alcoholic drug addicted mother.  My niece had a very tough  <br/>
&gt; childhood and by<br/>
&gt; age 7 was doing all the things her mother should have been doing.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, this is not uncommon!  Perhaps we could do a  <br/>
&gt; commercial that<br/>
&gt; shows the same going on right here in America and then show some  <br/>
&gt; children in<br/>
&gt; Africa playing and having a good time. </span></blockquote></div>
