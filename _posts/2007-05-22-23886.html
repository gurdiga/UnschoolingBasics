think in terms of How can I get what I want without imposing on  <br/>
others, then it&#39;s not so much hard as requiring flexibility and  <br/>
creativity.<br/>
<br/>
As unschooling parents we provide our kids with the freedom to  <br/>
explore their interests. We aren&#39;t handing them the right to do  <br/>
whatever they please. As we help them explore ways to explore their  <br/>
interests, part of our help will be respecting the needs of others.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us probably grew up deprived of power. There was a promise  <br/>
(maybe sometimes spoken, sometimes unspoken) by our parents that we&#39;d  <br/>
get our turn to do what we wanted when we grew up but now it was  <br/>
their turn. (They, too, were victims of the same promise and were  <br/>
passing it on as a legacy.) The problem was it was a lie. We realize  <br/>
when we get to be adults that though we have the freedom to do what  <br/>
we want, we also take on a load of responsibilities which seems to  <br/>
eat into our freedom*. (We also unconsciously have filled our heads  <br/>
full of &quot;no&quot; scripts from our parents about things we thought we&#39;d be  <br/>
able to do when we were grown up: stay up all night, eat ice cream  <br/>
for breakfast, sing at the dinner table and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
(It helps a lot to see our responsibilities not as chains but as  <br/>
choices. We *could* drop every single one of our responsibilities at  <br/>
any point. We *choose* not to. We also choose the level and manner  <br/>
that we&#39;ll perform them. I think it&#39;s a very important, helpful --  <br/>
and freeing :-) -- mental shift.)<br/>
<br/>
Adults can end up feeling like our time belongs to our duties to our  <br/>
homes and duties to our kids and duties to any other responsibilities  <br/>
we have. When is it *our* turn -- our turn that was promised to us?<br/>
<br/>
So most adults, as did their parents, end up taking from their kids  <br/>
to meet their own needs to &quot;do what they want&quot;. They want to sing,  <br/>
they want to watch their TV show, they want to listen to their music  <br/>
on the radio in the car, tough on the kids. When kids ask for what  <br/>
feels like an extra burden: drive them to get the newest game release  <br/>
they&#39;ve been waiting for, but another toy, go to the waterpark, it  <br/>
just feels like it&#39;s more that&#39;s stolen from our non-existent freedom  <br/>
to &quot;do what we want&quot;. So parents retaliate -- though it feels like  <br/>
self protection -- by saying no.<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t need to continue that legacy. We can, as many suggest,  <br/>
nurture the deprived child in us by giving to our own children what  <br/>
was denied us. We can stop seeing living as a power struggle to get  <br/>
what we want and be our children&#39;s advocate in getting what they  <br/>
want. If they feel that someone places great importance on what they  <br/>
want, if they feel that they will get what they want in a timely  <br/>
manner, there&#39;s no reason to feel the need to step on others to get  <br/>
it. We&#39;re social creatures so we do want to get along with others.  <br/>
It&#39;s just that the natural instinct to cooperate when our own needs  <br/>
don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being met. We can help kids meet *both*  <br/>
needs: their spoken need and the unspoken need to get along with others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304707092">Just a note--I was interested in finding the book you mentioned. The title is &quot;Freedom: Not License!&quot; and can be found used on Amazon for next to nothing. It&#39;s quite an old book so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s out of print but seems easily available used. <br/>
