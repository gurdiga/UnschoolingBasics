Actually, SC does not require a DAILY log. If you are homeschooling  <br/>
under option 1, as I read it in the law, you have to present a system  <br/>
of maintaining records as evidence of regular instruction including  <br/>
some record of subjects taught, a portfolio, and a record of  <br/>
evaluations, with semiannual progress reports to be submitted. If what  <br/>
you&#39;re doing works for you, that&#39;s great (and sounds pretty easy too  <br/>
which is a bonus). But, there is no legal requirement to have a daily  <br/>
log.<br/>

Thanks, Deb.  Last year our Accountability Association told us about  trouble <br/>
with DSS involving parents not keeping daily records.  Perhaps that  is where <br/>
I got the daily.  Oh, and Kelly keeps a daily journal.<br/>
 <br/>
As we have to keep attendance, I just make sure I write down at least one  <br/>
activity down from at least one required subject for each day of &quot;school&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just covering the bases!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely - whatever works, works. I was just clarifying that there <br/>
are options involved for anyone who might be browsing through here. <br/>
The accountability association option seems to require &quot;a plan book <br/>
or other record of subjects taught and activities&quot; in addition to <br/>
portfolio and progress reports. So, whatever works for someone to <br/>
keep &quot;other records of subjects taught and activities&quot; works.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at all the options and requirements for SC makes me really <br/>
glad that we&#39;re up here in CT<br/>
