<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135344070">&quot;In our UU church, we have people who describe themselves as <br/>
agnostics, atheists, deists, hindu, christian, pagan, buddhist, <br/>
married, single, straight, gay, transgendered, bisexual....all <br/>
working together, respectfully, to make the world a better place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This part could just as easily describe Unity.<br/>
The difference between the two, is Unity considers itself a <br/>
Christian church and believes in the Christ in everyone that <br/>
is &quot;awake&quot; to their own beauty and wonder. You don&#39;t need to agree <br/>
with all of their more Christian slanted beliefs in order to feel <br/>
welcome though. <br/>
I&#39;m not a Christian, but I love many of the Christian hymns I grew <br/>
up with, so I attend Unity some. Most of the talks aren&#39;t about <br/>
anything in the Bible, it&#39;s more about self improvement (which I&#39;m <br/>
sure varies from church to church).<br/>
It&#39;s a very positive environment, supportive of all who wish to <br/>
explore their spirituality and open to all belief systems. If you <br/>
prefer something with a less Christian slant though, Unitarian is <br/>
better. I do sometimes get annoyed with that part, because it isn&#39;t <br/>
a reflection of where I am...but I take the parts I love and leave <br/>
the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I actually like both for different reasons. Unity is very into self <br/>
healing and more spiritually oriented, Unitarian seems more <br/>
intellectually oriented (at least the one here). Both are very <br/>
positive places to learn different things...I&#39;ve attended both, but <br/>
Unity is where I&#39;ve been going off and on. I think I&#39;d go to the <br/>
Unitarian church more, but it&#39;s a much longer drive.:)</div>
