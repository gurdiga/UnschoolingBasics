<div id="ygrps-yiv-684750462">Finally after nearly 7 months of deschooling/rad-unschooling I had <br/>
a &quot;I get it&quot; moment with my dd last evening.  We were watching the <br/>
movie &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; last night and they used terms that she <br/>
wasn&#39;t quite familiar with.  So during the movie she would ask me what <br/>
did they mean, what is that, etc?  I would explain it to her.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s done this in the past, but I never thought about the fact that <br/>
she was learning while we watched a movie.  Too Cool!  Had to share my <br/>
light bulb moment.<br/>

<br/>
Cool.<br/>
....she&#39;s learning while watching movies, while reading, while<br/>
bathing, while eating meals, while playing, while sleeping (yes, I<br/>
think we grow and learn while sleeping, even if it&#39;s just processing<br/>
the learning of the day), while jumping and running and just LIVING.:)<br/>
<br/>
Once you start to see the learning in everything, to value every<br/>
activity she chooses, you&#39;re really THERE.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you had the shift. Great learning moments happen in these<br/>
seemingly casual conversations and day to day activities.<br/>

And, after a while of consciously  and excitedly seeing the learning  <br/>
where you hadn&#39;t seen it, before, you&#39;ll stop even thinking about it  <br/>
because &quot;learning&quot; will be so clearly ever-present that you won&#39;t  <br/>
notice it any more than you notice the air you&#39;re breathing.<br/>

What is so awesome about this is that you are going to start having <br/>
those moments OFTEN, you start seeing the learning in everything.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158157357">Thanks guys, you are so right, she is learning all the time, but it <br/>
finally sank in for me the other night.  I guess I&#39;m a little thick <br/>
headed or it was 16 years of school that I had to deschool from.<br/>
<br/>
I really love watching her grow and learn, but sometimes the old tapes <br/>
in my head rear their ugly head.  Since April we haven&#39;t had any <br/>
formal or structured learning, but I still at times get these feelings <br/>
in my stomach.  You know the ones, OMG, she&#39;ll fall behind, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know her percentages very well, etc.  But I just stop and <br/>
think about all that I have read over these past 7 months, read on <br/>
this site and I tell myself to trust her, she will know what she needs <br/>
to learn and when to learn it.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that I&#39;m the one still deschooling, she has moved on and is <br/>
learning despite me, but the light is beginning to come through.<br/>
<br/>
YEA!   I love RUS<br/>
