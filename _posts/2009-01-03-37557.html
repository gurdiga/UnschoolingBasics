<div id="ygrps-yiv-35520672">Hey Patrick!  I always wonder when I write Horde of Unschoolers, if I  <br/>
should point out the (not-so?) obvious that it is horde characters.   <br/>
But my inner imp came out this time and said &quot;don&#39;t do it&quot;.   Glad  <br/>
you did.  ::::::scolds imp, to which it responds....Can&#39;t we all just  <br/>
get along...::::::::<br/>
