<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787623106">Gee, that  brings up many memories for me! I went to grade school during the <br/>
late 60`s.  Girls couldn`t wear any kind of pants no matter what the weather <br/>
was.If it was  winter we would wear pants under our dresses and take them off <br/>
THE MINUTE that  we got to school.I remember the school taking a vote to see <br/>
what girls would be  allowed to wear. The list had mini skirts, pant suits,etc. <br/>
All the boys voted  for mini skirts.Just goes to show that no matter how the <br/>
world changes, it still  stays the same!<br/>
                                                                              <br/>

But, in  younger years (1-6 grades), gym <br/>
was mostly for running and playing. Of  course, back in my grammar <br/>
school days, we&#39;d wear &#39;hot pants&#39; (boy am I  dating myself there lol!) <br/>
under our skirts so we could change for gym  easily and then change <br/>
back - jeans weren&#39;t allowed at all and I was in  5th grade by the <br/>
time &#39;pant suits&#39; were even  allowed.<br/>
