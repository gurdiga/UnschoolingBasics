<div id="ygrps-yiv-965998079">I&#39;m forwarding this for Jan Hunt (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.com/)">http://www.naturalchild.com/)</a>.  IMO a<br/>
reporter who thinks a photo of an unschooler in college would be a powerful<br/>
statement is powerfully missing the point &lt;G&gt;, but here&#39;s the info if<br/>
anyone&#39;s interested.  ~Rue<br/>

Hi Rue,<br/>
<br/>
The Sun-Times reporter, Rosalind Rossi, is still looking for more<br/>
families to interview and just sent this request:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Am still looking for an unschooled Chicago area student now in college,<br/>
or out of college, or a non-Chicago area student now in a Chicago area<br/>
college. Think a photo of an unschooled student now in college would be<br/>
very powerful statement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you ask on your lists for anyone interested to write to Rosalind<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rrossi@...">rrossi@...</a> or call her at 312 321 2553.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Jan</div>
