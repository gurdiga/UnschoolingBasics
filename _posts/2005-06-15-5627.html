I  want to thank you for your response; I have been unsure whether we <br/>
will  &quot;fit&quot; into the unschooling community as I have seen some pretty  <br/>
confrontational discussion on some other groups.  This has been part  <br/>
of my resistance, I think.  The way you responded was loving,  <br/>
positive and empowering.  Thank you!    <br/>

**********************************<br/>
There ARE other lists that are confrontational. And from what I have seen,  <br/>
when you are ready, some of those confrontational people will be the people you <br/>
 will say you&#39;ve learned the most from. It&#39;s just hard until you&#39;re ready for <br/>
 it.  Consider those places Masters and PhD level.    ;&gt;) <br/>

Thanks for posting this Kathryn.<br/>
I&#39;m new to homeschooling and especially unschooling (we&#39;re starting at <br/>
the end of the current school year, 6th grade).  I&#39;ve explored MANY <br/>
different homeschool and unschooling chat groups and found the same <br/>
thing.  I was turned off at first, especially since I&#39;m so new to the <br/>
concept of unschooling and felt snubbed.  I wanted to tap into the <br/>
wisdom, but have learned to just lurk and absorb.  Groups like this one <br/>
are perfect for newbies to ask those questions that the <br/>
veteran &quot;Masters and PhD&quot; groups don&#39;t want to deal with - I understand <br/>
better now why and no longer feel excluded.  We&#39;re just not there yet!<br/>
