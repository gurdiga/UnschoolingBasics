While driving, we solve all sorts of algebraic equations---many in a <br/>
split-second. Without pencils and paper and without formulae. I bet <br/>
some of you mathies could put the &quot;problems&quot; above iinto equations. We <br/>
don&#39;t *need* to to solve them that way. We do *that* every day, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26365336">Wow...thanks for that. My dd is going to do driver&#39;s ed/training soon and I was wondering what subject categores I could use for her records! <br/>
Any other ideas for &quot;educationese&quot; for drivers ed/training?<br/>

Figuring out how to optimize your fenced garden for minimal money? <br/>
The length of the edges/area inside for the garden (and if you have<br/>
rambunctious dogs, a fence may be critical!) is an algebraic equation.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention optimal yield in your garden.  (Planting fewer plants<br/>
with higher yields, vs more plants with lower yields per plant.)  <br/>
<br/>
Other physics -- playing with magnets (that is always a blast!),<br/>
tossing a ball up in the air and catching it, etc.<br/>

And if you play games, well, there you get probability.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585079744">Social situations can also thought of algebraically. Variables can <br/>
include the number of people in a situation, their ages, whether they <br/>
are introverts or extroverts (heck, the whole MBTI is a way of <br/>
describing personality types based on four variables), etc.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to think about the stressors in mine and my kids&#39; lives in terms <br/>
of variables that interact with each other. If x=time since protein, <br/>
y=amount of sleep and z=days to my period, how do we caluclate the <br/>
likelihood that Meredith will meltdown in the grocery store?<br/>

Yeah---but I never saw much difference between the two.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663992631">I use geometry while flying airplanes. I use known landmarks and draw trajectory lines in space from point to point, combining two or three trajectories to figure out angles where my next landmark should be located so I can then pick up a heading and fly it. I use landmarks off on the horizon, really &quot;big picture&quot; stuff. I was not taught to navigate this way. I made it up because it worked for me, and I struggled in Geometry in High School. I have never been lost in an airplane, either, but I have been lost in a car. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My carpenter says &quot;what the heck does she mean by an &#39;odd-angled&#39;<br/>
mitre? That&#39;s too vague.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
He learned the geometry formula for figuring out the unknown<br/>
measurement of one side of a triangle on the job. What he says about<br/>
building is that basic math skills are all you need unless you&#39;re<br/>
getting into extreme precision work (ie: detailed furniture or other<br/>
masterwork type building). Basic geometry is occasionally useful, but<br/>
any kind of regular construction can be done with plain-old-vanilla<br/>
basic arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
He worked in construction for almost 20 years and is one of the most<br/>
precise, careful and skilled builders I know and he just told me that<br/>
precision math is rather useless when working with wood because it<br/>
isn&#39;t a precision material.<br/>
<br/>
You can have a 2x4 that is 1 1/2 inches thick or one that is 1 9/16ths<br/>
thick. Most all the pieces vary slightly, you&#39;re dealing with<br/>
different grains etc...  Carpenters don&#39;t become great by sitting in a<br/>
math class and learning algebra. They learn to become great builders<br/>
by building. They pick up needed tools as they learn to build. If they<br/>
need a geometry formula, a more expert builder will show it to them at<br/>
the time they need it (as in dh&#39;s case).<br/>
<br/>
The best kind of learning comes from doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121806226">ok, maybe i&#39;m the only nerd who feels this way, but there IS a value to formalizing the <br/>
math, and not just knowing how to drive, or how to saw trim, or what-have-you. the <br/>
value, in my eyes anyways, is in knowing how to quickly solve NEW problems that you <br/>
haven&#39;t seen before, and in knowing how to solve problems like the driving thing exactly.<br/>
<br/>
driving a car is NOT the same as knowing algebra. driving a car is driving a car. knowing <br/>
algebra is being able to figure out any number of other calculations (a real life example <br/>
from recently: if my fabric is 4.9 meters long and is likely to shrink to 4.7m after washing, <br/>
and i want to cut it, prewashing, into a piece that, post-washing, will end up 3.2m, where <br/>
do i cut?) at will. driving a car, no matter how skilled i am at it, will not help me figure out <br/>
any other non-driving related problems. yes, you could formulate kelly&#39;s examples <br/>
algebraically and precisely, but you don&#39;t need to to drive and i&#39;d hazard a guess that <br/>
99.999 percent of people never do.<br/>
<br/>
so: school may suck in many ways, but numbers and x&#39;s and y&#39;s are GREAT at versatility; i <br/>
hope my kids choose to use and understand them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; geometry, trig., etc.  Heck, ask your local carpenter how he <br/>
&gt; figures<br/>
&gt; &gt; out odd-angle mitred corners. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since I happen to have a carpenter handy...he uses a tool. He makes <br/>
&gt; or buys a jig and does a bit of trial-and-error. I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
&gt; be obnoxious, but it really does help, when thinking about the way <br/>
&gt; people learn, to step away from the obvious a bit. There&#39;s as much <br/>
&gt; (and sometimes more) conceptual geometry involved in re-arranging <br/>
&gt; furniture as carpentry - the carpentry just has more numbers. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mathematics isn&#39;t really about numbers, its about relationships. The <br/>
&gt; relationship between up and down and sideways is so facinating to us <br/>
&gt; humans that several different kinds of mathematics exist to describe <br/>
&gt; those relationships - algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus <br/>
&gt; all deal with those relationships in different ways. The math isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; in memorizing the jargon and formulas, its in thinking about what <br/>
&gt; all that stuff is designed to express, and that can be done without <br/>
&gt; a single number. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The trouble that most people run into is having been taught that the <br/>
&gt; numbers and the jargon *are* the math - that&#39;s what makes a <br/>
&gt; carpenter using a jig &quot;look&quot; more mathematical than a mom trying to <br/>
&gt; get her kids home from the park before the traffic gets bad, even <br/>
&gt; though *he&#39;s* just doing what Bubbah showed him and *she&#39;s* juggling <br/>
&gt; fourteen different variables in her head. <br/>

  Um, if the size will be important to me post-washing, why not just cut it down then?  Is there something to be gained by cutting first, and washing second?  And if so, this sounds more like a fabric/sewing problem than a math problem.  Besides that, I have no faith in the objective measure of how much my washer and dryer (and can I stretch and use a clothesline instead of a dryer?) will shrink it.  I feel much safe just chucking the math and washing before I cut. <br/>

  I do almost all math in my head (have since I was a kid, as did/do my parents) and have figured out my own formulas for how to answer the math-kinda questions that come up in every day life (or like the fabric I answer them without using algebra, thru other practical methods) but I have no idea how that would look on paper. And yet, it still works for me.  However, if my kids choose never to figure out these tricks it won&#39;t bother me a bit!  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll fill their heads and minds with the life-coping skills they need in their own lives, not those I deem necessary.  After all, I don&#39;t get to live their lives!<br/>

formal math. I enjoy helping other people learn it, when they&#39;re  <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
My observation and experience has been that those who have LOTS and  <br/>
lots and lots of experience of all kinds, but little paper and pencil  <br/>
(or online, these days) formal structured math, are very capable of  <br/>
learning the formal math later, if and when they do have an interest  <br/>
or discover a need for it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because numbers and equations and geometry and measurement are,  <br/>
as you said, &quot;GREAT,&quot; kids will be drawn to them and will choose to  <br/>
use and understand them.<br/>
<br/>
But, that doesn&#39;t mean that parents need to act like schoolteachers  <br/>
and provide lessons. It can all happen completely naturally and even  <br/>
the formal stuff can arise out of genuine interests.<br/>

know. Some people don&#39;t solve problems via logic - my stepson is <br/>
one. It drives me and his dad batty sometimes because we&#39;re both <br/>
terribly logical thinkers (me especially). I&#39;ve found personality <br/>
and learning models like the MBTI and Gardner&#39;s theory of Multiple <br/>

some kind of lack on Ray&#39;s part - its a whole different way of <br/>
thinking. *I* need those formalized models to help me think about <br/>
him, but he doesn&#39;t need them to understand himself or his own <br/>
learning processes.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, its more important to ask yourself <br/>
what will happen if your kids *don&#39;t* either understand or choose to <br/>
use formalized mathematical notations as a means of problem solving. <br/>
Do you push them to do it bc you believe its &quot;good for them&quot;? Do you <br/>
drop the matter and hope it never comes up? Do you help your kids <br/>
find other, different ways of looking at situations and finding <br/>
solutions? <br/>

No, you aren&#39;t the only one.  The point I had been trying to make<br/>
earlier (and failed, I think - and I dropped it there) was that when<br/>
you make those judgements while driving, you are NOT doing an<br/>
equation.  I defy anyone judging when to apply the brakes to tell me<br/>
what variable they were solving for, what the distance between their<br/>
car and the one in front was, etc.  Real world estimating, sure, but<br/>
not equation solving.<br/>
<br/>
My son is finding math VERY useful -- he wants to be a programmer -<br/>
preferably game programner.  He is loving the calculus he is taking<br/>
this year, and knows that it, along with the physics he has had (and<br/>
probably will have in the future at college) will help him with his<br/>
goals.  <br/>
<br/>
Word problems try to be real-life sort of applications, which is why<br/>
they are so important.  Some things, yeah, you can jerry-rig them<br/>
without precise calculations.  Other things, though, you do want to<br/>
get right, or you may waste a lot of time and/or money.  <br/>
<br/>
(BTW, if anyone has a child who is trying to learn algebra word<br/>
problems and is having trouble, the book that was a HUGE help to my<br/>
son was How To Solve Algebra Word Problems.  Straight forward title,<br/>
eh?  We borrowed it from the library.)<br/>

abstractions should not be rejected as &quot;schoolish&quot;. i guess i think that if a kid wants to <br/>
build a slingshot, or a tree house, or likes to watch &quot;mythbusters&quot;, that part of the <br/>
discussion and part of what the parent would bring to the project would be the math <br/>
underlying it. not to press it on the kid, but if i&#39;m helping someone build a slingshot, i <br/>
might find it interesting myself to see how heavy of a weight it can lift, or how far it could <br/>
conceivably throw something and how i could make it throw farther (Etc).<br/>
<br/>
and something that&#39;s always driven me *nuts* about mythbusters is that, while i love many <br/>
of hte experiments they do, it sometimes frustrates me that they do all the experiments <br/>
and never discuss the math/physics/whatever underlying some of the myths that they&#39;re <br/>
trying to bust. and so sometimes their experiments work and they either bust or don&#39;t <br/>
bust the myth, which is fine, and satisfying as a &quot;proof by example&quot; or &quot;disproof by <br/>
counterexample&quot; or whatever, but sometimes they neither prove nor disprove with their <br/>
experiments and are left basically saying &quot;we dunno&quot;---those situations especially just <br/>
BEG for math. they had one on mirrors where they were trying to reflect hte light of the <br/>
sun onto a specific point to make a fire. that just BEGGED to me for a physics book and <br/>
some formulas---they could&#39;ve figured out just how many mirrors etc and whether it <br/>
would&#39;ve been physically possible, and THEN tried to build it to demonstrate...<br/>
<br/>
anyways, i think there are so many ways to make math a part of life. and not in a forcing <br/>
or &quot;you should learn this&quot; way, just in a providing-paths-for-exploring-your-child&#39;s-<br/>
interest way, just as we help our kids with anything (including reading). it seems like <br/>
there&#39;s a little &quot;equation phobia&quot; here (am i misreading?) where it&#39;s almost as though since <br/>
equations and abstractions are taught in school folks don&#39;t believe they should be part of <br/>
life or discussed at all. seems to me like they&#39;re as much a part of life as letters and books. <br/>
not something to be forced, but not something to be avoided either.<br/>

them in a text-rich environment in which reading is interesting and essential and relevant, <br/>
they simply WILL learn to read. i don&#39;t see how math is any different except that so many <br/>
parents are afraid of it or ignorant about it or do not use it themselves. obviously, those <br/>

just as it is my job to create a text-enriched environment, with magazines and papers and <br/>
mail and books and notes and etc, and just as it is my job to create an environment <br/>
enriched with movement, with swings and slides and climbing structures and bikes and <br/>
etc. it&#39;s part of creating a healthy place in which a complete person can develop, and <br/>
trusting them to develop fully. and yes, i&#39;d say being able to formulate and solve basic <br/>
algebra problems is part of developing fully. i dunno that i could argue the same about <br/>

  I have the ability -- I could do the math my way, and on paper just to keep track of the smaller numbers, but I doubt it would look like any algebra formula anyone ever wrote.  The two years I spent in high school algebra was the most frustrating experience of my entire life.  Really.  The teachers insisted on *showing work* so they could know you understood the formula being taught. No matter how I tried, those formulas made NO sense to me.  I could figure out the answer in my head -- and get it right -- but not using their formulas.  The just did not make sense to me.  My solution -- at my Mom&#39;s suggestion, since she had the same difference with math learning -- was to do the work my way, get the right answer, then plug my numbers into the required formula.  Math homework took twice as long as it should, and I NEVER learned the formula being taught.  Sure, I got a B in Algebra both years and got my credit, but it scared me away from math for many years.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Since then, I&#39;ve discovered that -- had anyone bothered to ask since no one really expected me to excel at math -- that I like have some degree of discalculia. While I was in high school, tho the answer was math for dumb girls and jocks. &lt;g&gt;  The actually made us waste a three- week block on something they called FOIL factoring.  I suspect it was a special form of math designed to keep the non-math students busy, because it took me no time at all to find a much faster method for solving those problems -- again leaving me to do the math twice.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sorry to have to say it, but no one can convince me that math -- as it&#39;s taught in high school -- is a useful endeavor at all.<br/>

  Honestly, if they digressed into a physics book, we&#39;d stop watching.  I don&#39;t care about all the details of every experiment, but many of them have prompted us to explore the science or math behind them.  As you said, if a child is watching mythbusters and they want to explore further that&#39;s an opportunity for adult and parent to do so -- along the way they&#39;ll find a physics book if they need one.<br/>
   <br/>
  I realize part of what bothers me about this topic is the assumption that math is somehow more important than other topics, for example history (I&#39;m a big history buff and find it very relevant to life in this world).  Sadly, history as it&#39;s taught in public schools is nothing more than propaganda, and it&#39;s taught in such a boring fashion that most people don&#39;t care about history by the time they hit college, when the real education on history is available to them. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a math head I do enjoy a good formula.<br/>
<br/>
But not everyone does. Just as not everyone enjoys a Jackson Pollock  <br/>
painting.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed an interesting phenomenon. I went through school  <br/>
sucking up the algebra process. I  enjoyed identifying the type of  <br/>
problem and finding the type of solution that went with it. It was  <br/>
like puzzles to me.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t truly understand the underlying concepts of what the  <br/>
formulas represented.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, though, I&#39;ve come to understand what lays beneath the  <br/>
math, how the numbers relate to one another. I *conceptually*  <br/>
understand what&#39;s going on even though I&#39;ve forgotten most of the  <br/>
formulas. I can *conceptually* figure out the area of a right  <br/>
triangle in a number of ways because I understand how all the pieces  <br/>
relate to each other.<br/>
<br/>
My husband teaches college math. He&#39;s become an expert at applying  <br/>
formulas to problems.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, as just one example, he was stuck on an algebra problem and  <br/>
asked me to help him see where he was stuck. He wanted to hand me the  <br/>
formula but I didn&#39;t want that. I want to see how the parts all  <br/>
worked together.<br/>
<br/>
I remember what it was and it&#39;s a good one for illustration.<br/>
<br/>
There are two inspectors working independently. A part passes  <br/>
inspection only if both inspectors pass it. If inspector A passes 80%  <br/>
and inspector B passes 60%, and the percentage of parts that both  <br/>
pass is 40%, how many parts are passed by only one inspector?<br/>
<br/>
There is a formula to calculate that.<br/>
<br/>
But the formula doesn&#39;t help you understand the underlying  <br/>
relationships. It&#39;s a short cut so you don&#39;t have to write out all  <br/>
the possibilities. I simplified the problem to 5 parts being  <br/>
inspected, drew a chart of possibilities and came up with not only  <br/>
the answer but the formula. I could see the underlying way things  <br/>
were working and I could see how the formula represented that.<br/>
<br/>
But my husband was stuck because he&#39;s so used to plugging numbers  <br/>
into a formula (and enjoys that part of math.) He doesn&#39;t need to  <br/>
understand what the formula represents. He just knows this problem  <br/>
uses this formula because that&#39;s how math is taught in school. (He&#39;s  <br/>
a smart guy and *could* figure it out and understood what I showed  <br/>
him. The point is that for school math he doesn&#39;t need to understand.  <br/>
He just needs to know how to recognize which problem gets which  <br/>
formula.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s an adjunct professor, by the way, not someone with a degree in  <br/>
math. His love of teaching math comes from a love of school math. I  <br/>
loved school math too. I got As in it but it&#39;s only after being away  <br/>
from it that I can see the underlying flaws in how it&#39;s taught. It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t teach what they hope it teaches.<br/>
<br/>
And *that&#39;s* where the argument lies. What people here are trying to  <br/>
point out is that unschooling is about understanding the underlying  <br/>
relationships: intuitively seeing how one thing relates to another.  <br/>
That&#39;s what carpenters do. That&#39;s what the ladies buying fabric do.  <br/>
There may be a formula that will give them an answer, but it&#39;s just a  <br/>
*representation* of what&#39;s going on underneath. What people are  <br/>
trying to point out is that once someone has the underlying  <br/>
understanding, seeing and understanding the representation (formula)  <br/>
is not that hard.<br/>
<br/>
No one. NO ONE, is saying avoid formulas just because that&#39;s what  <br/>
they do in school. What people are saying is until you can see how  <br/>
important an underlying understanding of what the formulas represent  <br/>
is, you&#39;re not going to be able to see what math really is. Until you  <br/>
can forget that huge reliance that schools have on formulas, you  <br/>
won&#39;t understand what their purpose really is. It took me *years* of  <br/>
letting go of formulas, *years* of seeing real understand of number  <br/>
relationships being applied without formulas to appreciate formulas  <br/>
and what their purpose is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; driving a car is NOT the same as knowing algebra.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t, but experiencing real life is how people build up a  <br/>
*conceptual* (feel it in the bones) understanding what the formulas  <br/>
are trying to represent.<br/>
<br/>
Schools hope that the conceptual understanding will come from the  <br/>
formulas. Mainly because they can&#39;t teach -- and more importantly  <br/>
can&#39;t test for -- conceptual understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it doesn&#39;t work. A few people who would have understood anyway  <br/>
do get it. Lots of people come out with lots of nifty formulas to  <br/>
solve book problems. (Lots of people  come out hating it.) I had  <br/>
nifty formulas after 4 years of engineering. What I experienced in  <br/>
real life were messy problems that didn&#39;t look like book problems! To  <br/>
solve the problems required an underlying understanding of what was  <br/>
going on. I didn&#39;t really have that. Once someone set the problem up  <br/>
I could do it, but setting it up is the real work and setting it up  <br/>
requires understanding what&#39;s really going on beneath the formula and  <br/>
numbers. A computer can solve it!<br/>
<br/>
Someone in college said that boys got physics (mechanics really)  <br/>
because they had spent the previous 17 years throwing, catching and  <br/>
*being* the ball. Their bodies understood the principles and all they  <br/>
needed was to see how the formula related to what they already  <br/>
understood. The girls needed to try to understand the underlying  <br/>
principles through the formula. It didn&#39;t work nearly as well for the  <br/>
girls as the boys!<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, that&#39;s a bit sexist but it was 30 years ago ;-) Though I do  <br/>
think it still tends to fall along testosterone lines: boys are more  <br/>
likely (though not exclusively!) to be asking &quot;Let&#39;s see what happens  <br/>
when I punch this really hard.&quot; ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there are a few different issues intertwined. Unschooling math <br/>
is ulitmately going to look different for kids who get to unschool <br/>
from a young age vs kids who leave school after a few years. Its <br/>
also going to be different with a kid who is pretty logically <br/>
inclined vs one who isn&#39;t. On top of that, unschooling math is going <br/>
to look different in families where the parents have some math <br/>
anxiety. Those are the reasons why I&#39;m doing the whole &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
need numbers and equations to learn math&quot; thing. <br/>
<br/>
In my own family I&#39;m saying a lot of &quot;you don&#39;t need formalized math <br/>
to figure things out&quot; to my stepson, who is pretty scarred by his <br/>
school experience *and* not terribly logical by nature - but is <br/>
getting interested in woodworking. But otoh, my 6yo dd and I spent <br/>
the afternoon playing with the properties of circles in some pretty <br/>
formal ways, yesterday, and had a blast - but then she&#39;s always been <br/>
unschooled and has a very logical approach to problem solving. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; okay, so i&#39;ve gotten wrapped up in my comparison of formalized <br/>
 </span></blockquote>math to reading. what if <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my kids *don&#39;t* choose to learn to read? i don&#39;t think that&#39;s <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids would not be growing up in a math-enriched environment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the sort of mis-understanding I want to address - the Math <br/>
is still there, even if mom doesn&#39;t see it. Its *not* like learning <br/>
to read - its not really necessary to provide a &quot;math rich <br/>
environment&quot; for people to learn about math. In order to remove the <br/>
math from daily life you&#39;d have to shut someone in a sensory <br/>
deprivation tank. Eating and drinking involve mathematical concepts. <br/>
Preparing food requires using them. Playing with any toy at all <br/>
involves mathematical concepts. Sharing toys with siblings or <br/>
friends requires using those concepts. Looking at a car involves <br/>
mathematical concepts - and driving one involves using them. <br/>
<br/>
So its not that anyone needs to create a &quot;math rich environment&quot; - <br/>
its impossible to have an environment that lacks math. Formalized <br/>
math is something else again. Its lovely - but its not something <br/>
most people use. If anything, many people learn to actively avoid <br/>
anything that looks like formal math in the same way that many <br/>
others learn to avoid organized sports (and for the same reasons). <br/>
Its possible to go one&#39;s whole life without playing American <br/>
football, and its equally possible to go without learning a single <br/>
theorem.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; interest way<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its totally possible to make formalized math a familiar part of <br/>
normal life, but its not necessary in the same way learning to play <br/>
baseball isn&#39;t necessary. Some kids will find it fun, others <br/>
baffling - or utterly dull. Yes, the opportunity *should* be <br/>
available, but parents without a lot of math skills need to know <br/>
that they don&#39;t have to talk about numbers and proofs and equations <br/>
for their kids to learn about math *and* parents with kids who <br/>
aren&#39;t very logical, or who have had an ugly time in school need to <br/>
know that their kids really will learn &quot;enough&quot; about math to do <br/>
what the want to do in their lives *without* the formal stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to discourage Anyone from sharing their love of <br/>
formalized math with their kids! Good grief, that would be like <br/>
saying &quot;read to your kids but avoid mentioning sonnets&quot; or &quot;play <br/>
with your kids, but don&#39;t say anything about soccer&quot;. That&#39;s not <br/>
what I&#39;m trying to say at all.<br/>

No, you aren&#39;t the only one.  The point I had been trying to make<br/>
earlier (and failed, I think - and I dropped it there) was that when<br/>
you make those judgements while driving, you are NOT doing an<br/>
equation.  I defy anyone judging when to apply the brakes to tell me<br/>
what variable they were solving for, what the distance between their<br/>
car and the one in front was, etc.  Real world estimating, sure, but<br/>
not equation solving.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
But understanding that variables are at work in that example can evolve <br/>
into an equation that would make sense if you were to want to give <br/>
values to the variables.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra made sense to me when I was riding race horses. I was learning <br/>
how to handicap a race. Algebra seemed worthless during high school but <br/>
was crystal clear in racing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
