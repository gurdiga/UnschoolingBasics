*sigh*  You know there couldn&#39;t be a blog written by a man about how<br/>
bitchy his wife is and how much he hates having to do anything for<br/>
her.  But it&#39;s OK to talk that way about men and children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156348540">Wow! You know what is the WORST thing about this? Not one person comments on how terrible all of that is. I read about the recess stuff. I can&#39;t even believe how mean her ideas on punishment were. Wow!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216050346">Yes I agree. But she is pretty clear about what you are going to read in her blog.<br/>
If you choose to read it you should not complain.<br/>
She is pretty honest of how she sees the world, motherhood and even her marriage.<br/>
I choose not to read stuff like that the same way I choose not to read people that are<br/>
like my mom, people who believe in fairies &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
I find those people wonderful but it is just too much  for my personality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182028490">Yuck. In her &quot;About Me&quot; section, she mentions that she writes for Cookie <br/>
magazine online...figures. I got a subscription to Cookie magazine for <br/>
free (one of our other magazines went under and they subbed Cookie) and <br/>
it&#39;s worthless. Last month they were gushing about how some actress <br/>
(model?) was such a great mom of four.....ummmm, her 11-ish yr old is <br/>
away at boarding school (for greater educational opportunities than <br/>
their island life could give) and the 9-ish is next..... yeah, give her <br/>
a mother of the year award. geesh.<br/>
<br/>
back to having fun with my boys ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155677380">I&#39;m sad my 13 year old DS is past wanting me around all the time. I can&#39;t imagine shipping him off! Summer camp and his travels with my mom (they are travel buddies since my dad doesn&#39;t want to leave his business) are hard enough. Why do people have kids if they don&#39;t want to parent them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077583317">Maybe Im just looking at the bright side of people, but I think shes<br/>
trying to be satirical and off-color on purpose.  You know, like Kathy<br/>
Griffin and the whole D-List thing.  I just have a hard time reconciling<br/>
her writings with the fact that she is actually that wayand raising a<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Personally its not my type of humor.  Not funny in the least.<br/>

&quot;You cannot find your soul with your mind, you must use your heart. You must<br/>
know what you are feeling. If you don&#39;t know what you are feeling, you will<br/>
create unconsciously. If you are unconscious of an aspect of yourself; if it<br/>
operates outside your field of awareness, that aspect has power over you.&quot;<br/>
