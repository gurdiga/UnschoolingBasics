<div id="ygrps-yiv-475897203">Im sorry this is nothing more than a vent but this is about the only <br/>
place i can vent about it as it seems everyone around here in real <br/>
life disagrees with my views. <br/>
<br/>
I went to my neighbors house to let Courtney and alyssa visit for a <br/>
little while ( loooong story but my kids are not allowed over there <br/>
unless supervised by me because of inappropriate behavior between <br/>
Courtney and her sons) <br/>
<br/>
So I get there and Ill call her M......M looks like she is ready to <br/>
pull her hair out.So I asked what was wrong and she said B came home <br/>
with a pink slip and showed me the pink slip. <br/>
So i read the pink slip .His offenses were not following <br/>
directions , not paying attention, and eating his cookie before he <br/>
ate his lunch. ( and thats a problem because........?)<br/>
 <br/>
Ok that in itself bothered me a lot . But what really bothered me is <br/>
she spanked him for it and wrote on his pink slip and underlines . I <br/>
do not want another one of these sent him Paddle Him! <br/>
She is not the only parent around here.<br/>
Out of all the states that still allow the barbaric practice of <br/>
hitting children with a board , Ms has the highest statistic with 1 <br/>
in every 10 children getting hit every year. Most of the other dont <br/>
reach 5%. <br/>
sorry nothing personal if anyone else lives here but I want to get <br/>
the heck out of Ms!<br/>

Come on up to TN...we&#39;re making the Johnson City area an unschooling<br/>
haven!  Well, it really is in a sense, because there were already<br/>
several relaxed/eclectic and unschooling families here before us...but<br/>
we&#39;re working on making it unschooling RICH. There&#39;s always room for<br/>
one more.:)<br/>
<br/>
It makes me ill to think of how many children are being hit every day.<br/>

herself about not being &quot;good&quot;. If she simply didn&#39;t want to do art, that <br/>

clear she wants to join in, and sometimes she does, but it almost always <br/>
ends up being a downer for her. She starts looking at mine and saying &quot;I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587280078">We really make it a point to let our kids know that art is an <br/>
individual expression of what&#39;s inside them.  If, for instance, you&#39;re <br/>
really happy, all pink might come out and your page is covered in <br/>
pink...wouldn&#39;t that be a wonderful painting to look at later and <br/>
think of how happy you were?  <br/>
We keep lots of art materials around, crayons, markers, pens, pencils, <br/>
chalk, colered and white papers, scissors, stamps, buttons, glue, <br/>
beads, wire, glitter, play dough, ect... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797401751">I had the same issue with my daughter. <br/>
She&#39;s 8 now. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some things that worked for me. <br/>
Sit down to color but tell her that today the rules<br/>
are that nothing can be in the lines! Color crazy!<br/>
Make the sky green and the grass blue and don&#39;t stay<br/>
in the lines. Gasp and make silly faces if she does<br/>
stay in the lines! <br/>
<br/>
Make crazy collages. Anything goes. The more textures<br/>
and layers and better. Nothing forming anything. Just<br/>
very freeform. Play some sillywilly music while you&#39;re<br/>
doing it.  She&#39;ll love it! <br/>
<br/>
Get out your watercolor based markers and let her<br/>
color the tops of her feet and her toenails. <br/>
<br/>
Basic idea here is make art fun. Make it so there are<br/>
no rules right now. See if this helps. After trying<br/>
this, I would offer you this book...Drawing with<br/>
Children by Mona Brookes. This book had much to teach<br/>
me. I hope I have offered something of help to you. If<br/>
you need more help, please be sure to ask!<br/>

My son went through this also, and he loves doing art.    When my son would<br/>
say things like this, I would not ignore it, but I also wouldn&#39;t go into<br/>
&quot;What are you talking about, you are a great artist!&quot;,   because I knew that<br/>
he would know I was &quot;boosting&quot; him up (he would see it as artificial).<br/>
Instead, I would mirror how he was feeling and not try to fix his feelings<br/>
about it.  &quot;I hear that you are feeling badly because you think your art is<br/>
not good, is that right?&quot;  &quot;I hear that you would like to become a better<br/>
artist, is that right?&quot;  After a lot of this, it would naturally  lead to<br/>
solutions that we would find together, like finding an artist to work with,<br/>
talking about art that he likes and pulling ideas from it, putting on music<br/>
and seeing how different music affects our art time etc.  and we would also<br/>
talk about art itself, why we want to do it etc.this helped him to see that<br/>
we don&#39;t do art so that we necessarily become great artists (though that<br/>
might happen!) but that we do it to express our feelings stories and to have<br/>
fun!<br/>

I can  see this in myself with any new form of<br/>
artistic impression that I try...  whether it be with ballet, art, poetry,<br/>
crochet, or sewing.  We are  our own worst critics, aren&#39;t we.<br/>

So true!  I have a very harsh critic that keeps me from trying much of  <br/>
anything. <br/>
 <br/>
I believe that our children&#39;s concerns about their art is probably  <br/>
developmental, that at some point they are seeing that there is a discrepancy  between <br/>
what is in their minds and what ends up on the paper.  But when I  see these <br/>
traits in my daughter, I wonder about perfectionism.  I used to  think my <br/>
perfectionism was created from my family and school, but I think that  perhaps it <br/>
is more of &quot;me&quot; than I previously thought.  Yes, those  influences had a huge <br/>
impact, but perhaps they just intensified what was already  there.  My daughter <br/>
has had very little of this type of imposed judgment,  but she can be such a <br/>
perfectionist!  It breaks my heart, sometimes.<br/>

Interesting topic to discuss!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124828690">Let me assure you, I am a recovering perfectionist.  This all or nothing<br/>
attitude I&#39;ve had all my life has only kept me idle.  In one way it can push<br/>
me to do better but it also has a way of crushing my spirit because I fell<br/>
less than when I don&#39;t do it right.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that it is a part of my personality... along with an overly<br/>
perfectionist mother that added to the mix.  So I know your struggles first<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
I do make sure that I don&#39;t impose those things onto my daughter (who has a<br/>
bit of it in her personality, too).  I certainly don&#39;t want her to feel like<br/>
I do know... that who I am isn&#39;t enough.  My goal is to raise a bright young<br/>
woman who knows deep down that who she is is most certainly enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119842490">These are the same sort-of things that you do in P.E.T. (parent<br/>
effectiveness training).  And you also express your view as &quot;I really like<br/>
that picture...&quot;  the view is yours and not a boosting.  It avoids telling<br/>
your child something that he may not believe himself, like... &quot;you are a<br/>
good artist&quot;... it will save your child the inner conflict that would happen<br/>
if he didn&#39;t believe he was a good artist.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend reading the books... you can probably find the P.E.T.<br/>
book at the library.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also one from the Christian POV... I highly recommended it over at<br/>
the RCU yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the amazon.com links...<br/>

<br/>
If you do a search for parent effectiveness training on amazon, you&#39;ll also<br/>
find other books that fit into the same theory of child/parent interaction.<br/>

My son went through this also, and he loves doing art.    When my son would<br/>
say things like this, I would not ignore it, but I also wouldn&#39;t go into<br/>
&quot;What are you talking about, you are a great artist!&quot;,   because I knew that<br/>
he would know I was &quot;boosting&quot; him up (he would see it as artificial).<br/>
Instead, I would mirror how he was feeling and not try to fix his feelings<br/>
about it.  &quot;I hear that you are feeling badly because you think your art is<br/>
not good, is that right?&quot;  &quot;I hear that you would like to become a better<br/>
artist, is that right?&quot;  After a lot of this, it would naturally  lead to<br/>
solutions that we would find together, like finding an artist to work with,<br/>
talking about art that he likes and pulling ideas from it, putting on music<br/>
and seeing how different music affects our art time etc.  and we would also<br/>
talk about art itself, why we want to do it etc.this helped him to see that<br/>
we don&#39;t do art so that we necessarily become great artists (though that<br/>
might happen!) but that we do it to express our feelings stories and to have<br/>
fun!<br/>
