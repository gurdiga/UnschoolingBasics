<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625790689">I have a 6 year old and almost 2 and a new baby and making dinner is a  rush <br/>
i have found that just about everything do is timed and the faster I can  <br/>
finish it the better. My new born cries a lot and lord knows we have tried to go  <br/>
places and  I feel like I could cry. Dont get me wrong there are days when  <br/>
all is well. It does seem like I am always catching up on chores that never get  <br/>
done. I send you all struggling with the same, happy mommy vibes and house <br/>
work  love.<br/>
