<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377563304"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I really love Rue Kream&#39;s book, Raising A Free Child. It is  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>insxpensive. It is in a very readable. Question and answer format. It <br/>
is  the book I always recommend to friends to read when discovering  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I received Dayna Martin&#39;s new book in the mail  yesterday and <br/>
&gt; finished it this evening, it is fantastic! It was honest,  <br/>
&gt; straightforward and connected with what I have been trying to do/  <br/>
&gt; change regarding my parenting these past few  months.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a reminder that BOTH Dayna and Rue (and lots of other cool people!)  <br/>
will be at the Northeast Unschooling Conference in August!  Check out the  <br/>
website for more information.<br/>
