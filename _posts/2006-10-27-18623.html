<div id="ygrps-yiv-42981140">I&#39;ve been homeschooling my son (9) for about 2 years now.  My <br/>
daughter (13) has been home for just over a year.  We have been, as <br/>
most new homeschoolers seem to do, using a more classical approach <br/>
to education.  I often squirm when my son says he might as well be <br/>
back in school when doing some of his lessons.  My daughter was in <br/>
school until the 7th grade so she has public school much more <br/>
ingrained than my son.  Plus, I have a senior in public high school <br/>
(will not be coming home...she&#39;s so near then end of school, she <br/>
wants to stick with it, plus it is all she&#39;s ever known) so we <br/>
always have public school topics in our home.  My kids do math, <br/>
grammar, spelling, literature, and writing every day.  We alternate <br/>
science and history and sometimes do art, Spanish and music.  It is <br/>
all so scheduled and predictable.  I often feel as if they should <br/>
just be in school if this is the best I can do.  Yesterday, I gave <br/>
them free reign to collect bugs and create habitats with large jars, <br/>
plants, soil, etc.  They both loved it even though they are so far <br/>
apart in age.  I want all learning to be this great, every day!!!  I <br/>
have been allowing more free time for personal interests, but it is <br/>
very hard to let go of those old p.s. standards, ya&#39; know?  I feel <br/>
they need to be producing something all the time to show dad, <br/>
grandpa, etc.  It&#39;s so &quot;staged&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love advice, help, whatever on how to get this going.  I think I <br/>
need a gradual breaking in period.  I&#39;m not sure my 13 yo will feel <br/>
comfortable being left to her own devices, my 9 yo would love it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839708178">Hi Robin...welcome. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My kids do math, grammar, spelling, literature, and writing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>every day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids do also, but I have a feeling it looks different in your <br/>
house. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;We alternate science and history and sometimes do art, Spanish <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and music.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What happens if someone wants to listen to a CD or paint a picture <br/>
on a day that music or art is not scheduled? ;-)<br/>
The beauty of unschooling is that ALL those things you listed (math, <br/>
writing, art, etc) are part of your day, everyday...because it&#39;s <br/>
part of life.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It is all so scheduled and predictable.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds it. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here looking for a better way. You&#39;re <br/>
one step closer than you were before. :-) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I often feel as if they should just be in school if this is the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>best I can do.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(((hugs))) Good for you for seeing that and wanting something <br/>
more...something better. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;but it is very hard to let go of those old p.s. standards, ya&#39; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do know. We all do. :-) It&#39;s not easy to change...but it can <br/>
be done. <br/>
<br/>
I believe, unschooling starts with you, the parent. You have to <br/>
deschool yourself first. You came to the right place. Start reading <br/>
some of the older topics. There&#39;s a lot of really good information <br/>
here. :-) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure my 13 yo will feel comfortable being left to her own <br/>
 </span></blockquote>devices, my 9 yo would love it!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not leaving your kids to figure out things on their <br/>
own or to learn by themselves. Use the time you would have used <br/>
on &quot;grammer&quot; and &quot;music&quot; to go to a museum, make a solar system <br/>
model, fly a kite, watch a movie together, play a game of molopoly <br/>
or dig for bugs in the yard. What are they interested in? Explore <br/>
that WITH THEM. :-)   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714050910">What we did when we broke away from school-at-home was just leaving  <br/>
it as fall break. Now is the time we started, a year ago. We just  <br/>
decided we were getting ready for the holidays, and did all that we  <br/>
would normally do then, start decorating, baking, planning trips and  <br/>
visiting, shopping and baking. And we spent a lot of time planning  <br/>
how we wanted this year to go...I was on bedrest and expecting any  <br/>
day, so we were all focused on that. We snuggled in bed together,  <br/>
watching our favorite movies, reading our favorite books, and playing  <br/>
our favorite games (and some new of each because after a few weeks  <br/>
of  our &#39;favorites&#39; we found they were losing their flavor!)<br/>
<br/>
After the hustle and bustle of the holidays, we slowly started doing  <br/>
the things we truly enjoyed, not the things that society tells us we  <br/>
need. As a facilitator rather than an instructor, I saw my children  <br/>
not only learning more than ever, but happier and more relaxed than  <br/>
ever. It will happen, trust trust trust!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378837370">I&#39;m sure everyone has different ideas, different philosophies, etc.  What works for one may not work for another, etc.  But for us I decided life was too short to stress my kids out over a bunch of stuff they did not want to do.  When I pulled my girls out of public school I decided that I was not going to recreate school at home.  I&#39;m taking the lead from them.  One of my daughters I could not get to read for nothing when she was in public school.......she was struggling and considered behind in reading, and a number of other areas.  Well she read two chapter books out loud to her Grandma this week because she wanted to, not because anyone asked her to.  When she was in public school we had nightly tears over Math.  Now she asks me to do Math worksheets, and all on her own because she wants to.......not because I or PS wants her to.  Life is so much nicer now, and so much less stress.  This group has been great at letting me see things in a whole new light.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6927121">Hi Robin,<br/>
<br/>
We have been homeschooling/unschooling now since the<br/>
beginning of this school year.  We chose to unschool,<br/>
because it was what felt right for us, and our<br/>
lifestyle.  We are still in the deschooling process.<br/>
(all 4 of us, my ds, dd, dh, and I).  It is still a<br/>
big adjustment.  I am loving this, because there is no<br/>
school work, only learning the natural way.  We have<br/>
done some  gardening, cooking, reading, watching lots<br/>
of movies, listening to music, and playing video<br/>
games.  We are relaxing, and loving it.<br/>
<br/>
Although sometimes my kids like their space, and need<br/>
alone time (which I totally understand), we are doing<br/>
just about everything together, except for dishes,<br/>
laundry, etc. LOL.  I am finding that I am learning<br/>
right along with them.  For our gardening, we dug up<br/>
our hostas, and discovered they have hard roots to dig<br/>
out, and that we don&#39;t want to have any more in the<br/>
flower garden. (the hostas were here, when we moved<br/>
in.).  We&#39;ve also went for lots of walks, and trips to<br/>
the store.  We&#39;ve done grocery shopping, and just<br/>
window shopping.  They know that money is tight, and<br/>
we can&#39;t afford alot of extra&#39;s right now, but it&#39;s<br/>
fun to look and see what is new.<br/>
<br/>
Just learning to relax was hard for me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>
letting go of the PS life.  My kids were in 3rd and<br/>
4th grade when we pulled them out, at the end of the<br/>
year.  Since then, we have been exploring what life is<br/>
like, and to learn life lessons, as we go.  We did go<br/>
to the air zoo at the end of last month, and we<br/>
discovered that we didn&#39;t like it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is so long, but learning is easier, if<br/>
there is no restrictions, and they are free to pick<br/>
subjects that they really are interested in.  Life<br/>
becomes easier, when you throw caution to the wind,<br/>
and just be.<br/>
