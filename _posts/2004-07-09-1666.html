It  <br/>
can also be a box of tools, it can be woodcarving tools and supplies,  <br/>
and workbooks for the ones that want to &quot;play&quot;  school.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If you don&#39;t call workbooks &quot;playing school,&quot; they can just be another  <br/>
&quot;tool&quot;. Get rid of &quot;schoolspeak&quot;!<br/>

There&#39;s nothing &quot;dreaded&quot; about television.<br/>
 <br/>
And it doesn&#39;t have to be on the National Geographic channel or Animal  <br/>
Planet to spark an interest.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re watching OLN right now for the Tour de France---lots of sparks there!  <br/>
Cartoon Network is Duncan&#39;s favorite channel---always a lot to talk about <br/>
there!  HGTV---house porn---LOTS of sparks flying when I watch that!<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t limit your TV to &quot;educational&quot; channels only. It&#39;s ALL  educational!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, it is &quot;the dreaded television&quot;, because when it is on, <br/>
nothing gets done and a farm doesn&#39;t run itself.  Too much time can <br/>
be lost on tv, if we aren&#39;t careful, but that is OUR lifestyle.  :)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be educational, but we avoid the channels like <br/>
cartoon network and even Nick, because of all the commercialism on <br/>
them.  I HATE the commercials on any channel, even Disney, so we are <br/>
careful what is watched in our house.  The tv seems to show the USA&#39;s <br/>
loss of morals. imho.<br/>
