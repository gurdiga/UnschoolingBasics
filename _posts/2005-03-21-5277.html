<div id="ygrps-yiv-350108331">Yesterday we got our Girl Scout cookies.  Last night I sat down an ate a<br/>
whole box of Samoas after the kids went to bed.  Halfway through the box, I<br/>
realized I didn&#39;t want to eat them anymore, but I finished the box anyway.<br/>
Why? I asked myself.  Because I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t get a chance to eat<br/>
them later.  That of course was very silly, because I am the only one in the<br/>
house who likes them.  That&#39;s when I &quot;got&quot; what food control does.  I am<br/>
still struggling with it, though.  I still find myself saying that they just<br/>
need to wait ten minutes until dinner is ready.  I&#39;m working on it.<br/>
<br/>
With bedtime, I got it yesterday when Lauren got tired for her nap.  I had<br/>
not made her take her nap because she didn&#39;t want to take one.  By 4:00 she<br/>
was exhausted and started throwing fits.  I picked her up, told ehr it was<br/>
obvious she was tired and let her choose where she wanted to nap, my bed or<br/>
hers.  She fought and fought, but I made her lay down anyway.  Five minutes<br/>
later, she was sound asleep.  So with bedtime, I think I went to the other<br/>
extreme.  I think I found the happy middle ground now in regard to sleep.  I<br/>
thought food would be first, but I guess not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And don&#39;t be surprised if you are struggling with it for years.  <br/>
When I moved out of the house on my own at 18 and had all my own <br/>
control over food, I still struggled with the fact that all the food <br/>
in the house was MINE and *I* could eat it ALL and at ANYTIME I <br/>
wanted.  When I was married and my xh didn&#39;t eat sweets I still <br/>
would &quot;hoard and hide&quot; food even though I knew he wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
eat the chocolate cake.  No one in my house eats Thin Mints, yet I <br/>
do the same as you did with the Samoas.  &quot;I better eat them all now <br/>
because I may not get any later!&quot;  Food is very controlling and the <br/>
eating habits we grew up with are very hard to get over.  For <br/>
instance right now even though I am not hungry, I am thinking about <br/>
finding something to eat.  I&#39;m trying hard to listen to that inner <br/>
voice that says, &quot;Why are you eating when you aren&#39;t even the <br/>
slightest bit hungry?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons I want to allow the kids to figure out the <br/>
food thing on their own.  I don&#39;t want them to have these hang ups.  <br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to feel like they are controlled by food rather <br/>
than controlling the food on their own.  The hardest part for me is <br/>
Keon as he does not self-regulate in many areas in his life.  Eating <br/>
is one of those things that he has a hard time with.  If you offer <br/>
him food he will eat it.  If he walks through the kitchen he will <br/>
stop and eat something.  Not because he is hungry but because he is <br/>
in the kitchen and his brain goes, &quot;Food!  Eat!&quot;  Even when he isn&#39;t <br/>
hungry.  I&#39;m trying to let his body figure it out, but it is so hard <br/>
when I know that his eating habits are horrible and that he is <br/>
overweight.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last night Rosie got wild and goofy - she started laughing at <br/>
everything, being really loud, just kind of over the top. It was fun <br/>
for a while, we were all laughing, too, and having a good time <br/>
together. BUT - being mom - I could tell there was an edge of hysteria <br/>
- a sort of loss of control - going on with her. I knew that I needed <br/>
to get her settled down or something was going to set her off in a <br/>
negative way and she was going to end up upset.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW this about her - having seen it repeatedly. When she&#39;s really <br/>
tired, she gets that way. Sometimes she gets really pesty - goes around <br/>
from person to person and does things that are sure to be irritating to <br/>
them - like leaning against the back of their chair and wiggling around <br/>
or tapping something, making a little persistent noise, close to them. <br/>
When I start to hear, &quot;Rosie, could you stop that, please,&quot; over and <br/>
over, I know she&#39;s worn out and that if I don&#39;t help her out, she&#39;ll <br/>
probably explode when somebody eventually snaps at her too strongly.<br/>
<br/>
So - this is pretty subtle - her dad doesn&#39;t see it coming. But last <br/>
night Roxana saw it coming and quietly said to me, &quot;Mom, maybe we <br/>
should go watch tv for a bit, help Rosie settle down.&quot;  She was right - <br/>
we put in an episode of West Wing on dvd (one we&#39;d watched already, <br/>
several times) and Rosie laid down on the couch and was asleep in about <br/>
45 seconds. The rest of us then turned the tv off and did other things.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make a kid lie down if she was fighting, Judy. I&#39;d find a <br/>
way to help her settle down. But sometimes this process has to start <br/>
early enough - if a kid gets too tired, it is harder for them to settle <br/>
down. So - instead of forcing her to lie down - try coming up with a <br/>
list of ways you have to help her settle down -- warm bath, warm milk, <br/>
soft music, lower the lights, cuddle up together to read aloud, listen <br/>
to a calm tape (see Jim Weiss&#39;s relaxing tapes), back rub, ride in the <br/>
car or stroller, nursing, watching tv, or whatever....try different <br/>
things. I do think the key is being alert to the signs of readiness to <br/>
sleep so that you can get started supporting her need before she&#39;s <br/>
overly tired, though. This is probably especially true for kids who <br/>
have been going to sleep on a schedule - they aren&#39;t all that in touch <br/>
with their own personal signals and might ignore or even fight it when <br/>
they need to sleep. Your goal might be to make sleeping something they <br/>
look forward to - something pleasant - think about how much nicer the <br/>
world looks to them when they wake up - sleep isn&#39;t something negative <br/>
to be fought - it is a GOOD thing.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids never liked to go to sleep alone.  My girls are now 8 and 10 and I<br/>
have always lain down with them while they&#39;ve gone to sleep.  Sometimes in<br/>
the past it has frustrated me occasionally, but for the most part, I&#39;ve<br/>
thoroughly enjoyed that time with them.  It is a time that they talk about<br/>
their days and ask thought provoking questions.  I only have two kids and<br/>
they shared a bedroom up until a month ago so it was fairly easy to do.<br/>
Going to bed has always been a relaxing thing to do at our house.  Time to<br/>
cuddle and share.  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest has always slept in her sister&#39;s room (when she didn&#39;t sleep in<br/>
mine) and she recently decided to move to her own room.  She&#39;s done it twice<br/>
before but it never lasted more than 2 nights so I wasn&#39;t sure how it would<br/>
go this time.  But this time she was determined and part of the reason for<br/>
that is that she wanted to make her room into a barn, complete with a horse<br/>
stall, and sleep in the barn every night.  :-)  I told her that her sister<br/>
isn&#39;t comfortable going to sleep alone and that she was welcome to move out,<br/>
but that I would still lay with her sister while she goes to sleep.  I told<br/>
her that I would spend some time with her in her bed each night talking and<br/>
cuddling and make sure she was comfortable but that then I would leave<br/>
because her sister just isn&#39;t ready to go to sleep alone. She said that was<br/>
fine.  <br/>
<br/>
She moved out and we started on her room.  We pulled off the old pooh bear<br/>
border and painted the walls.  Then she sponged horse shoe prints all over<br/>
the walls and we asked my dad if he&#39;d be willing to build her a stall in her<br/>
room.  He said he would.  She slept in there every night for a month (except<br/>
one really windy night) and I know she is there for good. She is going to<br/>
sleep alone now but she feels really good about it.  Her stall got built<br/>
today and it is really cool.  If anyone wants to see it, I&#39;ll send you<br/>
pictures privately.  Just let me know off list.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people forget that there are other options than leaving their<br/>
children to go to sleep alone.  This has worked for us.  It didn&#39;t create<br/>
overly dependent children. It just allowed them to transition to sleeping<br/>
alone at their own pace.  <br/>
<br/>
My older dd is by nature more sensitive/needy than most.  I have faith that<br/>
in her own time she too will be able to go to sleep with out me being beside<br/>
her.  (Actually, she fell asleep last night before I got to her room, but I<br/>
woke her and climbed in with her anyway because she cherished the time we<br/>
spend talking and cuddling.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s sweet that they were able to transition to sleeping alone when<br/>
they were ready.  <br/>

adjusted for the child&#39;s specific needs &quot;this time.&quot; Read a book, sing <br/>
a song, get a kiss, close your eyes, and go to sleep -- clearly THAT <br/>
didn&#39;t work this time, so you need to figure out something else.<br/>
<br/>
You say you &quot;had to&quot; put her in bed. NAH - not true. No more &quot;have <br/>
to/had to&quot; okay, Judy? Every single time &quot;have to&quot; enters your head, <br/>
come up with at least a couple of alternatives that are very different <br/>
than the one you think you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
Judy thinking: &quot;She won&#39;t stay on the couch, I&#39;ll have to put her in <br/>

Judy thinking: &quot;Okay - that&#39;s one option but I don&#39;t really &quot;have to&quot; - <br/>

on the floor with a tape player and some story tapes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OR  &quot;I could lie down with her and sing softly while I rub her back <br/>
until she falls asleep.&quot;</div>

<br/>
Didn&#39;t I read that your Lauren is two?  When my babes<br/>
were two, they would want up on my lap to nurse, and<br/>
if they were tired they would fall asleep, and if they<br/>
weren&#39;t they would just get their mama fix and then be<br/>
fine again.  I can&#39;t remember a time of ever fighting<br/>
over a nap, or a time of ever laying a kid down and<br/>
telling them when to sleep.  Naps were either in<br/>
mama&#39;s lap in a recliner, or in a bed with mama laying<br/>
next to, or in a sling being carried by mama...all<br/>
comfortable, safe places, where little ones didn&#39;t<br/>
have to feel like they were missing out on life. <br/>
About 2 years old the naps stopped, though--they moved<br/>
from falling asleep during the day to sleeping longer<br/>
in the morning.  Just be loving and flexible....<br/>
