<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367221557">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
now I need help again. We&#39;ve been unschooling for about a week  <br/>
now :-) I have had many positive experiences since then and I really  <br/>
want to continue doing this, because I believe in this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m EXTREMELY exhausted! I don&#39;t think it is that I have been saying  <br/>
&quot;yes&quot; too much and not taking into account my own needs, because I  <br/>
have, when I really needed it, and always kindly and as respectful as  <br/>
I can and I found that since she has been given freedom, she is so  <br/>
grateful that she helps more often than she did before and she  <br/>
accepts real &quot;nos&quot; without whining.<br/>
<br/>
But there is one need of ours which doesn&#39;t seem to be compatible  <br/>
with unschooling. That is relaxing without children (or with, but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t seem to work) and watching/doing things for &quot;adults&quot;.  <br/>
Formerly,  when the children where in bed, at *8.00 pm* :-) we had  <br/>
four hours for *just us*. We would watch movies, relax, talk, email,  <br/>
bathe together etc. After a long day of work and attention to our  <br/>
children we&#39;d be exhausted and could relax.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have no bedtimes. The first days she went to bed at 3, 4 in  <br/>
the morning, we were already in bed :-) I really want her to have  <br/>
that freedom and I don&#39;t mind at all this part of the fact. BUT *we*  <br/>
as a couple don&#39;t seem to have any peace at all. We haven&#39;t relaxed  <br/>
since monday, I&#39;m extremely exhausted, headache since yesterday, we  <br/>
havne&#39;t even been able to talk about unschooling or anything in  <br/>
relaxed mode to process all of this. I thought I was only lacking  <br/>
sleep but the last two days I wanted to go to bed early, and at 22:00  <br/>
I said I wanted to go to bed, and THEN *suddenly* she wanted to a  <br/>
million things: endless cuddling (I read somewhere we shouldn&#39;t let  <br/>
go off first), talking, show me something, show me another thing etc  <br/>
etc... well yesterday I managed to go to bed anyway early (for my  <br/>
standarts), but I still feel extremely exhausted. I dunno how to meet  <br/>
this need because I really just need NOBODY around me asking  <br/>
questions, making me do things etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do? Is it unschooling if we tell her she can play or do  <br/>
whatever meanwhile, but we need our time in the evenings to watch  <br/>
somethign and relax? or being alone? At least *sometimes* I&#39;m not  <br/>
even asking for EVERY evening, but just when we feel the urge? I  <br/>
guess not! So yesterday we tried watching TV anyway (to have our  <br/>
needs and passions respected as well) and then DS (1 yr) was crawling  <br/>
all over us all the time (he kind of understood we are unschooling as  <br/>
well ;-) and doesn&#39;t want to sleep at 8 either), and DD (7yr) started  <br/>
jumping around, said a million things in between, asked questions  <br/>
(which we answered), said it was boring etc etc. So we kind of didn&#39;t  <br/>
relax at all :-) And as exhausted as we go to bed now we will  <br/>
probably never have sex again ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know it will be hard at the beginning and that the child&#39;s needs  <br/>
are on top. But... How do you meet your own need to relax?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791090741">Not having an arbitrary bedtime doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t help your<br/>
children settled in for the night at a fairly regular time.  Are you only<br/>
kids 7 and 1?  My kids at those ages always happily settled into bed on a<br/>
fairly routine basis.  (Actually, they still do at  almost 10 and 11)We<br/>
didn&#39;t miss/cut short a special movie or the fireworks or stop a fun visit<br/>
somewhere JUST because it was 8 o&#39;clock, but they were still tired on a<br/>
regular basis and still went to bed at a pretty regular time.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This was not with tears because it&#39;s bedtime and I said so, but loving<br/>
cuddled beside mommy or daddy after our normal evening routine.  If dh and I<br/>
wanted time together afterwards I&#39;d get back up out of bed after the kids<br/>
fell asleep.  (Sometimes I&#39;d tell him to wake me in half an hour cause I<br/>
knew I&#39;d fall asleep) It didn&#39;t take long for them to fall asleep because<br/>
they were tired.  I didn&#39;t pick an arbitrary bedtime but followed their body<br/>
signals and we had a nice routine and we began that when they showed signs<br/>
of tiredness.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to find something that works for your family while being<br/>
respectful of your kids at the same time. <br/>

her body clues.  What clues can I help draw her attention to to help <br/>
her understand?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example.  It&#39;s getting late, nearing 10:00 or 10:30, dd <br/>
has been up since 7:30 - 8 in the morning with an 1.5hr nap around <br/>
1:30.  I can tell she&#39;s tired through her irritablity, but she <br/>
insists that she wants to stay up to watch more tv or very <br/>
occasionally play with us.  The playing with us part I understand, <br/>
dh got a new job about 2 months ago that requires him to work more <br/>
hours than before, the problem with this is that dh gets up at 6:00 <br/>
and is tired and needs to get to bed himself.  DD still nurses to <br/>
sleep inbtwn us in our bed.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas about how to make this smoother?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111655889">&lt;Any ideas about how to make this smoother?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My girls always wanted to be where I was, so when they showed signs of<br/>
tiredness, we began our bedtime routine and I went to bed with them.  I<br/>
always gave them plenty of warning time so they could prepare themselves<br/>
mentally.  Even know when my 9 yo starts to fall apart from over tiredness,<br/>
(she gets frustrated and down on herself)  I talk to her about how<br/>
everything seems worse when you are tired and how much better she&#39;ll feel in<br/>
the morning and I offer to lie down with her.  If we were playing a game or<br/>
doing something together, I promise to finish in the morning and then I do. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just keep reminding her of the clues and giving plenty of transition time<br/>
and then go to bed together.  My youngest is the first one to say when she&#39;s<br/>
tired now and she&#39;ll ask me to lie down with her if she&#39;s really tired.  My<br/>
older dd doesn&#39;t seem to need as much sleep as even I do (more like her dad)<br/>
although she still comes to bed when I go because she likes to be near me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn&#39;t say to a three year old that she can stay up as late<br/>
as she wants to.  Not having a bedtime by the clock doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>
don&#39;t watch for their tired clues and help them transition smoothly into<br/>
sleep.  It just means don&#39;t have an arbitrary bedtime.  &quot;It&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock,<br/>
it&#39;s bedtime.  I don&#39;t care that the other kids in the neighborhood are<br/>
staying up for the fireworks.  I don&#39;t care that there are Christmas<br/>
specials on tonight.  I don&#39;t care that you slept in this morning and you<br/>
aren&#39;t tired now.  It&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock, it&#39;s time for bed.&quot;  Some people do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709306711">***I&#39;ve noticed that lately dd (almost 3) as not been following her<br/>
body clues,***<br/>
<br/>
I think three is very young and she really can&#39;t be expected to understand <br/>
all those signals nor should she be expected to know exactly how to respond <br/>
to them.    Signals that we&#39;re tired can be different and can be responded <br/>
to differently.  Not all adults understand their own body signals so it <br/>
seems too much to expect of a little child.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we&#39;re tired a little snack and a sit down can rejuvenate us. <br/>
Sometimes a nap will do.  Sometimes we need hours of sleep.   Sometimes <br/>
little kids need mom to hold them for five or ten or thirty minutes. <br/>
Sometimes nursing and a five minute snooze is all they need and they&#39;re good <br/>
for a couple more hours.   She *is* processing all that.  She *is* becoming <br/>
aware of that but understanding might take years and years.  It&#39;s not as <br/>
easy as one signal for one kind of tired and one response.<br/>
<br/>
***and gets frustrated when we tell her she needs to go to<br/>
bed. ***<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to tell her.  You can begin to make her environment more <br/>
sleep friendly.   Turn down lights, turn down TV or music, get into your own <br/>
pj&#39;s.   Offer her pj&#39;s.   Hold her, rock her, lay down with her....   If <br/>
hearing you say &quot;time for bed&quot; makes her cranky then you can stop *saying* <br/>
it but take actions to move the household toward sleep.<br/>
<br/>
***What clues can I help draw her attention to to help<br/>
her understand?***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to draw her attention to her own body cues.   You can <br/>
talk about yourself though.  You can say when you feel tired and you can say <br/>
how good it feels to put on your jammies and snuggle on the sofa.    I <br/>
personally find it very irritating when other people tell me how I feel. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
As she gets older it might help her if you make an observation like,  &quot;you <br/>
seem tired&quot; or if you ask if she might be tired,  but she is still very <br/>
young and I think you won&#39;t help her awareness by pointing these things out <br/>
now.  I think time will help her awareness and your example of a person who <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like sleep is the end of something, the end of fun or the end <br/>
of play but just one more part of a day, like getting dressed or having <br/>
lunch.<br/>
<br/>
***but she<br/>
insists that she wants to stay up to watch more tv or very<br/>
occasionally play with us. ***<br/>
<br/>
Can your dh just go to bed when he needs to?  You could quiet the house and <br/>
ease your daughter toward sleep.  Can she fall asleep watching TV with you <br/>
and then be moved to the bed?    Can you and your daughter sleep in another <br/>
room where you might take more time talking or reading in bed and not <br/>
disturb your dh?<br/>
<br/>
Try to be flexible and creative.  Your daughter is changing and growing and <br/>
what will help her today might not help in two months.  If the goal is to <br/>
help her get to sleep and get the amount of sleep she needs you will have to <br/>
be the one watching her cues so that early on you can offer things that will <br/>
ease her toward sleep.   A warm bath, a little snack, cuddly jammies just <br/>
out of the dryer, a favorite blanket or stuffed toy offered to her when you <br/>
snuggle down on the sofa in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
We used to make a nest for Dylan, on the sofa or on the floor.  For awhile <br/>
he had a little tent we&#39;d put up in the living room and we&#39;d cozy it up and <br/>
he&#39;d snuggle in there and watch TV until he fell asleep or he&#39;d take some of <br/>
his little trains in there and play and fall asleep that way.   Sometimes <br/>
he&#39;d just go to bed with his dad.   Mostly he liked to be where we were and <br/>
if we were happily getting ready for bed he&#39;d join us.  Sometimes he&#39;d stay <br/>
awake longer than us but we got used to him there, playing quietly. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
(as much as one can get used to little feet scrambling and little fingers <br/>
poking and patting.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is a difference between having no bedtimes and helping a child relax<br/>
into sleep.  I used to think that my son Keon had a bedtime because he went<br/>
to bed at 8:05 everynight.  then I realized that it had nothing to do with a<br/>
bedtime.  He went to bed then because that was what his body needed.  Here I<br/>
have 2 girls who are up until past midnight most night and my son was going<br/>
to bed regularly at a &quot;normal&quot; bedtime.  It only looks normal because he was<br/>
being helped into sleep by us at a time when his body needed it.<br/>
<br/>
If your children aren&#39;t able to read their own body clues that they are<br/>
needing sleep, there is nothing wrong with helping them settle down.<br/>
Perhaps put on a movie and turn out the lights, spend some time reading a<br/>
story.  Express to them that they look tired.  &quot;You look sleepy, honey.  Do<br/>
you want me to go lie down with you for a while so you can rest?&quot;  or even<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m exhausted.  Will you curl up with me for a bit so I can close my eyes<br/>
for 40 winks?&quot;  Lack of bedtime does not mean neglecting helping your<br/>
children figure out their sleep patterns.<br/>
