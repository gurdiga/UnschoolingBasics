<div id="ygrps-yiv-396198764">PLAY - be a &quot;student&quot; of your kids. It doesn&#39;t need to look anything at<br/>
all like &quot;preschool&quot; or whatever. Spend an afternoon messing about in<br/>
the mud out in the backyard then have a blast in a nice warm bubble<br/>
bath. Kids are good at playing, grown ups tend to loose it. So, start<br/>
learning play all over again from your kids. Have fun. Relax. Live,<br/>
love, laugh together, the learning will happen, formal didactic type<br/>
stuff need never happen (unless one of the kids happens to be fascinated<br/>
by textbooks)<br/>
