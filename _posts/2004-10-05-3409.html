<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372083599">I just want to say that we attend Unity from time to time and I think it is wonderful as they are very accepting of diverse beliefs.  But what I (and my ds) like best about it is that at every service they sing &quot;Let there be Peace on Earth.&quot;  I just LOVE this and always get all tingly that so many folks are praying for peace.  Will says this is his favorite song and I agree.  Also, the &quot;readings&quot; aren&#39;t usually from the bible, but rather Gandhi, or Paramahansa Yogananda or some other great sage.  <br/>

PS Oh yeah, they sing the song differently than I heard it growing up:  &quot;With God as Creator, Family all are we....&quot;<br/>
