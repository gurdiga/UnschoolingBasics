<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993332984">Hi folks, <br/>
I have an ongoing situation I need a little input on. My ten year old<br/>
son, Solstice, has a friend, well, his best friend, actually, that has<br/>
some tendencies to sneak around, and basically try to &quot;get away&quot; with<br/>
stuff. When he and Solly get together, or talk on the phone, they<br/>
pretty much always have some sort of secret thing they&#39;re<br/>
planning,(which I normally would be fine with, in respecting my<br/>
Solly&#39;s right to his privacy and independence) but over the past year,<br/>
the things they are coming up with are increasingly ill advised and<br/>
dangerous. In December, the midst of a freezing Wisconsin winter, they<br/>
&quot;ran away&quot; together, at 10 pm, without enough warm stuff on, or a<br/>
destination. This is the only friend there is ever any sneakiness<br/>
with, Solly&#39;s general policy is full disclosure, to a fault!  :)<br/>
This is puzzling to me for two reasons. Number one is my relationship<br/>
with my son. He has high functioning Asperger&#39;s, and I have always<br/>
been his &quot;contact&quot; person, (or his &quot;advocate&quot; as they call it in the<br/>
public school system) and so he tends to choose to come to me with<br/>
whatever idea or plans he has and run them by me first. He knows that<br/>
I will help him to work towards whatever his goal is, without<br/>
trivializing his desires.(I know this because he does come to me with<br/>
 lots and lots of stuff.) <br/>
 He does have a great deal of independence, and usually prepares most<br/>
of his own food, uses his paints, clay, and other things that the<br/>
younger kids usually ask first about because he knows that he can do<br/>
these things on his own, and that they are things he feels confident<br/>
that I won&#39;t ask him to wait awhile, or do it differently (please take<br/>
the clay off of the couch and put it on a hard surface.) like I<br/>
frequently need to do with the younger kids. He will even ask<br/>
&#39;permission&#39; to use a swear word! (totally his idea, and, again, he is<br/>
looking more for guidance than permission) I have assumed that maybe<br/>
he is trying to branch out and gain some further independence with<br/>
making his own choices, but I also think that this other young man<br/>
encourages him to hide things and to disregard the general policy of<br/>
our household, which is to democratically decide things like when we<br/>
have friends over, what we are doing on the weekends, etc. Things<br/>
change a great deal in the way that Solly relates to others when this<br/>
friend is around.<br/>
Reason number two this is confusing, is that this other boy is also an<br/>
unschooler, and his mother also is very open in her communications<br/>
with him, and facilitating his needs and wants. So, it is puzzling to<br/>
me that he would have such a draw to secret plans and hiding things.<br/>
(not that this couldn&#39;t be a parental issue) <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m holding my Solly back, or saying *no* too much,<br/>
but I guess I should probably ask him what he thinks about being<br/>
secretive. He has already told me that he doesn&#39;t feel like he sees<br/>
this friend enough, and I know that is because over the course of the<br/>
last year, I have really grown to mistrust this boy, his judgment, and<br/>
his motivations, and therefore I do find excuses not to have him<br/>
around, which is probably only aggravating the situation. However,<br/>
this was all happening when we were roommates with this boy and his<br/>
mother, over the course of a year, and it has only been since April<br/>
that we haven&#39;t lived with them. <br/>
I guess I am just wondering about secrecy and kids in general. Is this<br/>
just a natural part of feeling like they are &quot;master of their own<br/>
destiny&quot;-just branching out? How would you handle this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

this kid? If he&#39;s ten, too, then he has the judgement of a ten year <br/>
old. A ten year old unschooler, sure, but its not a guarantee of <br/>

I&#39;d also be pretty frank with Ray about my feelings - that I was <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34730306">Those are a lot of really good points. I think I forgot to mention a<br/>
few things, like that the plans are often malicious toward the younger<br/>
kids around, and that he is generally sort of a bossy bull frog toward<br/>
the younger ones, and is sometimes downright bullyish. <br/>
<br/>
I have put some thought into the jealousy issue, and I think that,<br/>
yes, that may be a part of it, because I don&#39;t really have a great<br/>
relationship with him. Mainly it&#39;s because I find it hard to be<br/>
friends with a person of any age that is cruel to young children and<br/>
manipulative across the board. I just have a really hard time handling<br/>
a situation in which there is a person that does not come to adults<br/>
for help, treat us as though we were his equals, as we treat him,  but<br/>
rather, lies and sneaks so often that I find it hard to believe he is<br/>
being honest at all. And, so, we go out and do things as a family, and<br/>
he comes along, and before I know it they&#39;re off whispering, and then<br/>
suddenly a younger kid is crying with a mudpie in the face. Or, an<br/>
iceball filled with rocks is being hurled at a car that&#39;s driving past<br/>
and I&#39;m RIGHT THERE and it doesn&#39;t even matter. <br/>
<br/>
 I lived with this family for a year, and no matter how much I said<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; and played with them, and modeled the behavior of truthfulness,<br/>
working together, respecting other folks right to just *be* He just<br/>
has some issues with trusting adults, and, geez, how much can you<br/>
affect another person&#39;s behavior, and when is it time to just call it<br/>
quits? <br/>
<br/>
I think that one of my most major issues here is that in our family,<br/>
we have principles, not rules, that guide us. Kindness, patience,<br/>
gentleness, in our dealings with others. If a child is super<br/>
frustrated and just melting down, yelling at me and freaking out, I am<br/>
going to calmly ask, can we talk about this when you don&#39;t feel like<br/>
yelling anymore? I don&#39;t like to be yelled at. At their house, they<br/>
might just have a conversation screaming at the top of their lungs at<br/>
eachother, using mean and angry words. I think that with our maybe<br/>
admittedly idealistic lifestyle, I am just a bit sensitive to this. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to be screamed at, or manipulated, or lied to, and I know<br/>
that it may be impossible for a child who does not have a model of<br/>
peacefulness in his own home to be a peaceful person, but do I really<br/>
have to deal with it? There&#39;s always some decompression time after<br/>
they play together, during which we discuss Solly&#39;s behavior, not his,<br/>
and there&#39;s almost always a total communication breakdown for awhile,<br/>
where Solstice acts like I&#39;m the big bad enemy. It just sucks. <br/>
 <br/>
Especially because I endeavor always to find a way around &quot;no&quot;. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to say it, I want to find a way to do the things they want<br/>
to do. But, if they&#39;re running across the street to jump off of the<br/>
dumpsters in the parking lot, and I say no, no matter what else I<br/>
suggest, I&#39;m just the evil adult. It&#39;s ridiculous, because I KNOW that<br/>
sometimes the whatever it is that they want to do is not even a real<br/>
desire, but just a manipulation tactic to show my kids, &quot;see, I told<br/>
you she&#39;d say no.&quot; I&#39;ve heard him say it a million times. Well, you<br/>
know what, kids, no, you cannot burn the house down. No, you cannot<br/>
lock the 5 year old in the closet on a hot day and then go outside.<br/>
What the heck!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(all of this actually happened except for them trying to burn the<br/>
house down. :)<br/>
