<div id="ygrps-yiv-633115028">I know that there are homeschoolers, unschoolers out there that actually &quot;work&quot; from home.  I haven&#39;t worked in about 3 years, and my husband just got layed off from his job in June... with Christmas coming up, were desperate.  Does anyone know of leugitimate (spelling may be wrong) work at home companies where we can quickly get some income? we are almost 2 months behind on rent, and if we don&#39;t get caught up soon, well....I&#39;m not gonna go on an on.....these are hard times for everyone I know.</div>

There are a Gazillion &quot;work from home&quot; sites out there, but your best chance for quick income is through word of mouth. Anything else will have a process which may be time consuming or cost money or both. Plus the majority of &quot;work from home&quot; gigs are at best a back-up income, rather than something on which to rely. <br/>
