<br/>
Why I just don&#39;t know yet.. It was one of those things that swirl <br/>
around in your brain and need to get out.:)<br/>
<br/>
The trouble is, I&#39;m stuck on chocolate...I may never get back to the <br/>
whole unschooling connection. Having too much fun with the portal to <br/>
write about the learning stuff. Sigh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611957720">There are worse things to be stuck on than chocolate<br/>
<br/>
My personal favorite is dark chocolate - especially the semi-sweet morsels<br/>
you bake into cookies. I have a real problem keeping them long enough to be<br/>
baked. My Grandmother used to keep two bags - one up high in the pantry and<br/>
one in the door of the refrigerator that was unofficially specifically for<br/>
snacking on. The taste still brings back memories :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL last night we were having ice cream and NesQuik syrup. I <br/>
squeezed a bit directly into my mouth and DS (7) said &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
obsessed with chocolate!&quot; at which point DH and I started laughing <br/>
and I said &quot;Yes I am.&quot; But then they already knew that since I&#39;m <br/>
known to put chocolate chips on my Cheerios...and other cereals (the <br/>
fruity nutty types are especially good with chocolate chips) and <br/>
sherbet (DH thought I was nuts until we found that Edy&#39;s makes <br/>
orange sherbet with chocolate chips already in it!)<br/>
