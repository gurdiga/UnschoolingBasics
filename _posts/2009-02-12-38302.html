<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733485386">Welcome to the list Caroll!  This is a great place to start gaining <br/>
some insight about unschooling.  While your IRL (in real life) <br/>
community of unschoolers grows, you might find that virtually <br/>
connecting with tribe online is as powerful a contribution to your need <br/>
for connection with like minds as evolves your IRL connections.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the ride!<br/>

 <br/>
I live in Ohio (Cincinnati) but my brother lives in Florida.  We have 3 boys (8,5.5, and 3) and one girl (almost 2).  I would love to continue to get to know you and everyone else.  If we drive to Florida sometime, maybe we can detour and go through the Carolinas.  I am also in my thirties and a stay-at-home mom.  I help my husband with his business occassionally, but I am actually resigning from my &quot;paid&quot; position there at the end of this month.  <br/>
 <br/>
We love to travel, build and create anything out of everything, watch movies, play outside, and do things as a family.  If you ever want to email me off-line, feel free in order to get to know each other better.<br/>

You will find this group very committed to helping people find their way.  I have been learning so much about really loving life with my children and hubby!  <br/>

Off to California for 5 days!  Later!<br/>
