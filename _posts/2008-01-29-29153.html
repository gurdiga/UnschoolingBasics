<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436692411">My 13 year old dd has been developing a relationship online with a boy.  She has met him irl, <br/>

- they want to go to the movies as friends, first.  I&#39;m uneasy about this, not knowing him at <br/>
all.  She&#39;s feeling a lack of trust from me on this.  I&#39;ve suggested he come over just to hang <br/>
out, play rock band, etc (she&#39;s got two older brothers).  She says he&#39;s shy and doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
do this, or she doesn&#39;t want it, I&#39;m not sure.  I&#39;m looking for a win/win.  I&#39;d love some input.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about &quot;Can you help me feel more comfortable about this?&quot; And,  <br/>
rather than handing her a solution, brainstorm some possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Embrace your discomfort as your issue that you&#39;d like her help with  <br/>
rather than a barrier she needs to solve for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857327116">Hi Ann<br/>
I know with my 14yo dd I need to be able to let her know WHY I feel <br/>
uncomfortable with something.   This has been a big shift for me in my <br/>
parenting style and I have to really work at it but it is getting <br/>
easier.  once I am clear about why I feel uncomfortable and can <br/>
express it to her we can work on a solution together.  Sometimes I <br/>
realize it&#39;s not a big deal and can let it go, sometimes she can see <br/>
the validity of my reason and she lets it go and soemtimes we work out <br/>
a compromise.  I can see why you would be uncomfortable with letting <br/>
you daughter spend time with a boy when you have not met him and he <br/>
seems unwilling to hang out at your house.  That would feel like more <br/>
of a safety issue than a trust issue to me.  It&#39;s awesome you are <br/>
willing to really look at it and work it out with her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867205386">You might like to know that there is a movie available on DVD called &quot;The Man in the <br/>
Moon&quot; with Sam Waterston and Reese Witherspoon that has what might be called a <br/>
&quot;relevant moment&quot; in it where the 13-yr. old Reese Witherspoon has been frequently <br/>
seeing a local 16-yr. old young man at a nearby lake (they live in a very rural area, so the <br/>
young man is a neighbor). When the father Sam Waterston becomes aware of this, he asks <br/>
her to &quot;bring him around sometime ... let me get a look in his eyes&quot;. The scene is <br/>
wonderfully acted, portraying him as asserting his rights to play the role of guardian and <br/>
protector, without wanting to unneccessarily control or interfere with her, or <br/>
unneccessarily scare off the boy. Perhaps watching the scene would help you to better <br/>
identify what your own feelings are. And the movie is a very good one overall so worth <br/>
seeing anyway - check out the Amazon reviews.<br/>
