<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780110795">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Because of the recent discussion about pets, I thought I would ask a similar<br/>
question about my 5 year olds obsession with cats!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We had a cat when living in England, but decided to give it to my brother<br/>
because of traveling/quarantine, etc, when moving to the US, thinking we<br/>
could always visit him (the cat!) on our visits/return. Sadly after 4 months<br/>
of us leaving, the cat was run over and died.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At the time my son was 3 years old, yet still walks around with his soft toy<br/>
cat (of same colour and name as our previous real cat!) pretty much<br/>
permanently, and spends a great deal of time making &#39;cat homes&#39;, &#39;cat play<br/>
spaces&#39;, etc, etc. We have decided not to get another cat, as are thinking<br/>
of returning to Europe in the near future, and do not want to put any of the<br/>
family, particularly our son, through any similar emotional turmoil (plus<br/>
the cat!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So - I was wondering - does anyone please have any great ideas on how we can<br/>
&#39;stretch&#39; his cat interest?!!! We have played vets, made cat sticker books<br/>
and pictures, drawn houses and counted cats inside them, visited pet shops,<br/>
and even looked after a friend&#39;s cats when they were on holiday. He loved<br/>
all these activities, but I have to admit - I am running out of ideas!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any great books (particularly easy chapter books) we can<br/>
read to him, easy puzzles or board games involving cats, or just about<br/>
anything?!!!!!<br/>
<br/>

Looking forward to the replies! Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644614374">There is now a PETS passport system that eliminates much of the quarantine <br/>
period to the UK or the rest of the EU when coming from the U.S. You may <br/>
want to look into it. It requires having a rabies jab for your pet and then <br/>
having a blood titer drawn and sent to a lab in Kansas where they test for <br/>
rabies antibodies in the blood. If those are present than the quarantine <br/>
period counts down from the day of the titre being drawn to 6 months, so 3 <br/>
months after the titre is drawn, quarantine is 3 months, and at 6 months I <br/>
think it is only a brief stay in kennels on arriving.<br/>

I believe some James Herriot books have been written/re-written as <br/>
children&#39;s books and there&#39;s a cat book among them.  My girls enjoy <br/>

About a year and a half ago Mo and I started the *Warriors* series <br/>
by Erin Hunter. Not as easy a read as I&#39;d hoped, but she loved the <br/>
fact that it had maps and four different cat &quot;tribes&quot;. We ended up <br/>
making a set of cards, kind of like trading cards, with the <br/>
different cat-characters and cat-tribes. In the end, she played with <br/>
the cards and didn&#39;t want to hear the book anymore, but it was great <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also enjoyed renting the series &quot;Taruto&quot; - which is an anime-<br/>
esque series with cats who look a lot like people and who can do <br/>
magic. Its a little scary in places, and also a bit cutesie, but Mo <br/>
and I both loved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309424119">Oh, we just watched that. Its really good. Sailor Moon also has a talking <br/>
cat in it. One of Simon&#39;s favorite books for a while was Desmond Morris&#39; Cat <br/>
World: A Feline Encyclopedia. He also wrote a book called Catwatching, which <br/>
I haven&#39;t read, but it might be fun. Oh, and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas wrote <br/>
a book called The Tribe of Tiger: Cats and Their Culture which is a follow <br/>
up to her The Hidden Life of Dogs, and is pretty good as well.<br/>
<br/>
National Geograpic did a movie called Cats: Caressing the Tiger which looks <br/>
quite good: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shopngvideos.com/products/CatsCaressingtheTiger">http://shopngvideos.com/products/CatsCaressingtheTiger</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255726190">What if you took your son maybe once a week or so to a local animal shelter. You can call ahead to let them know youd like to volunteer. He can help feed and brush the cats and hold them as well.<br/>
   <br/>
  As you can also let him know that he is helping these cats get ready for a new home. It works out good for everyone :)<br/>

law is that under 16 needs accompanied by an adult.<br/>

(without me), hence the age restriction.   I&#39;ll check into it again and <br/>
perhaps she&#39;ll reconsider if it&#39;s the only way right now for her to <br/>
spend time with the animals!<br/>
