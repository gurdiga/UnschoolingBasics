<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369710802">Please excuse the cross-post, but I felt this needed to reach as many<br/>
homeschoolers as possible...  Guess I&#39;ll be relying on cable for the kids&#39;<br/>
educational TV from now on...<br/>

ATTENTION HOME SCHOOLERS! ACTION NEEDED!<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen any of the one minute WordGirl shorts throughout the PBS<br/>
KIDS GO! weekday programming or the two minute WordGirl episodes which air<br/>
after the very popular Maya & Miguel show on your local PBS station, please<br/>
take a moment to visit the PBS KIDS website to view the negative portrayal<br/>
of home schooled students that is being espoused in this programming. The<br/>
link to the website is: <br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pbskids.org/wordgirl/">http://pbskids.org/wordgirl/</a>&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Click on the left side &quot;Heroes, Villains & Mere Mortals&quot; then select the<br/>
character &quot;Tobey&quot;. Here&#39;s the character description from the website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tobey is a 10-year-old home schooled genius who causes serious property<br/>
damage in order to get WordGirl&#39;s attention, not that he&#39;d ever admit it.<br/>
He&#39;s a master of robotics, building giant robots to do his bidding. He&#39;s<br/>
constantly trying to prove that he is WordGirl&#39;s intellectual superior, and<br/>
that he isn&#39;t afraid of his mommy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In one episode, there is a comment about Tobey that &quot;he&#39;s so timid that he<br/>
has a hard time making friends.&quot; In the same episode, Tobey also acts very<br/>
rude and destructive. You can see this episode and others (they are all only<br/>
a minute or so long) by going to the same website link above and clicking on<br/>
&quot;Adventures of WordGirl&quot; on the left side of the webpage, and then when the<br/>
&quot;Choose a Character&quot; screen comes up, select &quot;Tobey&quot; and then click on the<br/>
first picture under &quot;Choose an Episode&quot; at the bottom of the screen (it&#39;s<br/>
the one with the robot picture).<br/>
<br/>
Scholastic&#39;s choice to portray this intelligent, yet socially inept and<br/>
deviant character as a home schooled student is a glaring attack on home<br/>
schooling and educational choice. Scholastic would not have dared to portray<br/>
this character as a racial minority or as a homosexual, yet they feel at<br/>
liberty to attack home schooled students and indirectly their parents who<br/>
they imply are making social misfits out of their children by teaching them<br/>
at home. This programming is seen by thousands of children every day and is<br/>
a means of influencing their attitudes toward home schooled students. As the<br/>
saying goes, &quot;If you say it loud enough and long enough, the people will<br/>
believe it.&quot; There is no evidence to support the socialization concern in<br/>
regards to home schooled students, yet the educational establishment<br/>
continues with this propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your children do not watch PBS, please contact Scholastic Media (the<br/>
creators of the WordGirl cartoon) and Scholastic Corporation (the owner of<br/>
Scholastic Media) and let them know your feelings about their choice to<br/>
portray this socially deviant &quot;villain&quot; as a home schooled student. We need<br/>
to stop the continued insinuations by the educational establishment that<br/>
home schooling results in a lack of social aptitude. Insist that Scholastic<br/>
Media stop making episodes with Tobey and also mention that you will not be<br/>
purchasing any more of Scholastic&#39;s educational books or products until you<br/>
see that they have removed this character from the WordGirl episodes. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, please contact your local PBS station and ask that they stop<br/>
airing the WordGirl episodes that involve Tobey and remove them from their<br/>
website. Emphasize that the portrayal of Tobey as a socially deviant home<br/>
schooled student is a direct attack on home schooled students and their<br/>
families. If you happen to be a financial supporter of your local PBS<br/>
station, make sure to mention this fact to them and tell them that you<br/>
cannot support a station that airs such programming. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a bit of a stretch.<br/>
<br/>
If the child in question had all those &quot;deviant&quot; qualities and was<br/>
public schooled, would public schooled parents be crying foul?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t choose to be a racial minority or homosexual, you CHOOSE to<br/>
homeschool so it&#39;s not the same. Yeah, we get the short end of the<br/>
stick sometimes but if we jump up and down about every time someone<br/>
portrays a homeschooler as inept, we aren&#39;t going to do much good.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an attack, maybe a bit of ignorance but then maybe not. Maybe<br/>
the writers know some homeschoolers like that and are having fun with<br/>
it. We ARE social misfits.;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a huge wide range of examples of public schooled kids so one  <br/>
socially inept one or one brilliant one doesn&#39;t seem to represent  <br/>
them all.<br/>
<br/>
Same with white males. There&#39;s a huge range of representations of  <br/>
white males from caring fathers to psychopaths that any  <br/>
representation seems to be about that particular character rather  <br/>
than saying anything about white males in general.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what choice has to do with it. Because someone chooses a  <br/>
philosophy or lifestyle, they have to accept stereotyping? That the  <br/>
reason stereotyping isn&#39;t acceptable is because someone can&#39;t choose  <br/>
to not be a race if they didn&#39;t like how they&#39;re treated?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree about the jumping up and down part. If someone responds in  <br/>
anger the one they&#39;re railing at is likely to feel justified in  <br/>
having portrayed them as unpleasant. Why would they want to create a  <br/>
pleasing image of someone who is acting unpleasant?<br/>
