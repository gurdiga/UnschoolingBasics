<div id="ygrps-yiv-758413965">&quot;Would you say it works the same for foreign language, then?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
If you have music in a foreign language, I&#39;ve found that children <br/>
pick up foreign words quite easily. I don&#39;t think making a foreign <br/>
language important in the early years is necessary. The only way to <br/>
truly learn a language is total immersion.<br/>
So unless you or your partner speak another language, your children <br/>
aren&#39;t going to get fluent anyway. Just treat foreign languages like <br/>
everything else, something to explore.<br/>
I think if they HEAR foreign sounds at a young age, it&#39;s easier to <br/>
pick it up if they choose to immerse themselves one day. <br/>
