<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114417357">Just wondering if there are any families out there in North West Oakland County, Michigan. We live in White Lake and are looking for families to hang with. We ecletic homeschool/unschool, gentle parenting and are just really down to earth people. My kids are 5 and 2- both boys. I&#39;ve just read many, many John Holt books and find him to be really inspirational. Stephanie</div>
