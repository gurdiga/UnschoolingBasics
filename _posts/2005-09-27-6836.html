I had a  friend recently telling me about someone becoming involved in <br/>
wedding planning  and one thing this lady was getting was a chocolate fountain. <br/>
Maybe worth  checking into as well.<br/>

Ooo, I&#39;ve seen one of those, smaller and priced lower, or in-home use...  Let <br/>
me see if they have it online... Yep, they do!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool! Looking at the picture it seems it would be pretty simple to <br/>
make a &#39;shell&#39; that would fit over the lower tiers to make it look <br/>
like a volcano. I&#39;d also suggest putting some holes or &#39;valleys&#39; or <br/>
something in any &#39;shell&#39; so that the chocolate can drip back into <br/>
the bottom catch tray which allows it to be recirculated (instead of <br/>
just running all over...can&#39;t let chocolate get wasted loL!) Or <br/>
maybe curl the base of the mountain a bit to create a chocolate <br/>
river that funnels the chocolate back into the drip tray area.<br/>
