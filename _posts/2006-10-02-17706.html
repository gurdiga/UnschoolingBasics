<div id="ygrps-yiv-867777871">...about telescopes? <br/>
<br/>
We bought one for Christmas but were unhappy with the quality and <br/>
returned it. My youngest daughter is very interested in space and all <br/>
things space related so this is something we&#39;ve been talking about <br/>
getting for a while. <br/>
<br/>
What should we look for in a telescope? Certain types or models? We <br/>
really don&#39;t know to much about them so anything anybody can tell us <br/>
would be a big help in our decision in what kind to buy. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have a Discovery Store near you?  They have a great line of<br/>
fairly affordable telescopes.  We, too, bought an inexpensive<br/>
telescope that didn&#39;t have a very good base.  Very unstable.  The wind<br/>
would make us lose what we were trying to focus on.  What we DO know<br/>
about telescopes is that it needs to be stable and the &quot;joints&quot; (all<br/>
the moving parts) should be fairly firm so that they don&#39;t jiggle very<br/>
much .  Try to find one that makes viewing comfortable.  So that you<br/>
can look through the eyepiece without having to need support or can<br/>
devise a way to give you the support you need.  We have a friend who<br/>
bought an old walker (the aluminium framed kind like that are use din<br/>
hospitals) to use as a support for themselves so that they could view<br/>
into the telescope without fearing to knock it over or anything.<br/>
<br/>
You can find a decent small telescope for under $100, but consider<br/>
spending between $200 and $400 for a nice telescope, especially if<br/>
your children are younger.  They get much better definition and are<br/>
generally easier to align and look through.  We&#39;ve had some fantastic<br/>
sightings with our scope.  We have viewed Mars, the rings of Saturn,<br/>
nebuli, a moon crossing in front of Jupiter, craters on the moon, all<br/>
kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
There are some great magazines available for amatuer sky watchers.  Go<br/>
to your bookstore and puruse those for different ideas.  Ask lots of<br/>
questions.  The way we found out scope was that we went out with a sky<br/>
watching group that meets every month through the college.  They have<br/>
nights that the public is invited.  They have all kinds of scopes that<br/>
we could look through and ask questions about.  It was like going to a<br/>
huge showroom.  Must have been around 20 scopes.  Call your local<br/>
college or planetarium and ask if there is such a group in your area<br/>
and then take a nap and go meet up with them!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions. :-) What brand do you have and would  <br/>
you recommend it? The one we bought was about $100 bucks, but we <br/>
were really disatisfied with it. <br/>
<br/>
More than likely, I&#39;ll have to buy one online because I odn&#39;t know <br/>
of a place nearby that sells them. Can anybody suggest a reputable <br/>
website?  <br/>
<br/>
We recently went to the Orlando Science Center where they had an <br/>
observatory. Jacqueline loved it! I blogged about it and took some <br/>
