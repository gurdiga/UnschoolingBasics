I&#39;m about to go get my kids out of bed and coerce them. I see it as <br/>
coercion and am not denying it because it is what I&#39;m going to do.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are generally cooperative and even take initiative in helping <br/>
around the house - and will wash the dishes or do laundry once in a <br/>
while just because they notice it needs doing. They&#39;re also extremely <br/>
messy - leave stuff all over - trash, dirty dishes, toys, dirty <br/>
clothes, books, etc. A LOT of clutter everywhere - a LOT LOT!!<br/>
<br/>
But today I&#39;m going to get them up and insist that we all do housework <br/>
together for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Then we&#39;re going off to the beach with lots of friends and we&#39;ll be <br/>
there for TEN hours - campfire, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t help and the house isn&#39;t straightened up and cleaned up <br/>
significantly, I really don&#39;t want to go to spend the whole day and <br/>
evening at the beach, I want to stay home and clean the house. I have <br/>
VERY low standards and we&#39;ve fallen below my low standards - dirty <br/>
smelly dishes, no clean clothes, a thick layer of dust, grubby <br/>
bathroom, and so much clutter everywhere that we can&#39;t walk safely <br/>
through the house. We have been very busy - out of the house all day <br/>
and evening for days in a row. (You&#39;d think the house would not get so <br/>
messy when we&#39;re so seldom home, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;ll just do it when I ask - so maybe I won&#39;t have to feel <br/>
like I&#39;m coercing them. They see the need and will want it done, too. <br/>
They&#39;ll comply with my request.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it isn&#39;t coercion - but, truth is, I intend for them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
So - we haven&#39;t fully come around to no coercion in the housework area.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE the stuff people post about it - and it has helped me <br/>
tremendously to get perspective.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were littler, if I was starting earlier, I&#39;d change the way <br/>
we&#39;ve dealt with housework.<br/>
<br/>
But, right now, I just want to go to the beach and have fun and then <br/>
NOT come home to a stinky, messy, gross house.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and NonCoercive Parenting are not one and the same thing. <br/>
******************************<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this stuff, trying to figure out whether we use or have <br/>
used coersion regularly (I&#39;m certain we have non-intentionally over the years.)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have bedtimes, and haven&#39;t for most of Julian&#39;s life (since we began <br/>
homeschooling.) We don&#39;t have assigned chores. <br/>
<br/>
But there HAVE been times we suggest strongly that he go to sleep, because <br/>
he&#39;s getting cranky and resisting it after too many days of short sleep. And he <br/>
always agrees.  We ask him to do stuff around the house, and he has never <br/>
refused. Sometimes it&#39;s not immediate, and sometimes he doesn&#39;t feel like it, but <br/>
he recognizes that we all hate it, and he never refuses. When he was little <br/>
never questioned bedtimes or toothbrushing or was a difficult eater. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;re subtly coersive. Maybe he&#39;s just remarkably compliant. Or maybe <br/>
we just work as a team and he trusts us enough to just do the things we ask him <br/>
to do, knowing that we&#39;ll always do the same for him.<br/>
<br/>
When we began unschooling, we realized we couldn&#39;t &quot;Unschool Julian.&quot; We <br/>
realized that the thing that drew us to this was that we all really valued <br/>
learning and empowering one another. We became an Unschooling Family, and the adults <br/>
spend as much time being learning and doing things we love as Julian does. We <br/>
try to make decisions that will strengthen all of us, individually and <br/>
together. Julian supports and empowers me and Beth as much as we do him.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was wrestling with an issue for the conference, and chatted with <br/>
Julian about it. He gave me an amazing idea I was missing entirely. Smart kid. <br/>
Good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know about the coersion thing at all. I can tell you he&#39;s <br/>
never &quot;disobeyed,&quot; because we don&#39;t tend to give orders. He doesn&#39;t always make <br/>
the choices I would make, or even the ones I would prefer he make.<br/>
<br/>
I bet that was clear as mud ;)<br/>

I have been enjoying these posts so much, they are really making me think<br/>
hard about some of these issues.  I guess what matters to me in my house is<br/>
that we do what feels good for all of us, no matter what &quot;label&quot; someone<br/>
else wants to apply to it.  In regards to &quot;Coersion&quot;, the way I view it is<br/>
that something coersive is something that is a demand, something forced.<br/>
Something non-coersive is a request - and my request or my children&#39;s<br/>
request to me can certainly carry with it explanation and persuasion and<br/>
persistance.  If I have a request that is really important to me and that I<br/>
feel is vital, I&#39;m going to say so, I&#39;m going to say it loudly, I&#39;m going to<br/>
say it often, I&#39;m going to express how important it is to me and how my mood<br/>
and willingness to help out as part of the family are affected if that need<br/>
doesn&#39;t find a way to get met.  My kids do the same to me and that helps me<br/>
know how important something is to them and why which often shifts me from<br/>
feeling too tired to help them with something tonight to choosing to put my<br/>
tiredness aside and do it because it&#39;s THAT important.  Just like my kids<br/>
do, I feel it is important to push hard sometimes, to indicate how important<br/>
this is to mom, so that my needs can get met.  We can be creative and fun<br/>
about it, I always want to incorporate their needs - whatever works for that<br/>
situation.  My going into a discussion or a request with a specific goal in<br/>
mind doesn&#39;t make it a demand to me.  It just means I have a focus.  I&#39;m<br/>
open to getting my need met differently than I may have in mind originally<br/>
if that helps all our needs get met.<br/>
<br/>
There may be a thin line at times between what is persuasion and what is<br/>
coersion.  I have only my own gut instinct and the reactions of my children<br/>
to tell me if I&#39;ve crossed the line.  I know in my own self I have a pretty<br/>
good sense of when someone has persuaded me - that is someone has explained<br/>
themselves and their needs to me and the importance of those needs so<br/>
clearly that I sense a shift in my own willingness to do something.  They<br/>
have persuaded me - that means I understand them better, I care about them<br/>
and I make a choice to change my position and help them willingly.  It feels<br/>
pretty clear to me when I feel forced or coerced or not given much of a real<br/>
choice to make.  I feel trapped and angry.  I think it&#39;s the same for my<br/>
kids and so I go by how their reactions as to whether I need a new tack on<br/>
how I&#39;m doing something.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t view Pam&#39;s situation as coersive the way she described it, but<br/>
even if she wants to call it coersive, I have done the same in my house and<br/>
not felt it to be forcing - and my children have not responded with feelings<br/>
of being forced.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if that makes the mud clearer, but those are my thoughts...<br/>

I love this! It is not just Jayn who is being liberated by Unschooling, but<br/>
our entire family. <br/>
<br/>
There is always further to go, and more realizations to have. Thanks.<br/>
