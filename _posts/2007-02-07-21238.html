<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127842481">In the light of the discussion of sharing problems on unschooling lists, here&#39;s one I&#39;d like input on:<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my 4yo received a belated birthday gift from the grandparents -- a wooden castle and set of figures (knights, horses, wizard, dragon).  To say that my 7yo, whose frustration threshold is extremely low, is beside himself with jealousy is a gross understatement.  Yesterday I had to call dh home from work to help because he was so furious (and it was lunchtime and I was expecting AAA to show up to tow the van any moment).  <br/>
<br/>
This morning while I was in the shower something happened, I don&#39;t know what, but dh sent 10yo to get me and when I went down 7yo was shredding newsprint, kicking and screaming at dh while 4yo was hovering anxiously over castle.  Now, an hour later, we&#39;ve put the castle in hiding although not before 7yo grabbed most of the figures (which he still has).  So far I&#39;ve said that 4yo can have the castle (since it was his gift) later when 7yo won&#39;t be here -- not to punish 7yo but to keep 4yo safe.  I also said that I want the castle to be something that brings joy and happiness and fun to our family and that we need to figure out how we can play with it so that that happens before we bring it back out.  I also spent a long time sitting with 7yo, comforting and offering kisses and lots of reflective listening.  <br/>
<br/>
At the moment I&#39;m thinking the castle simply has to be away unless an adult (or possibly only a mommy) is available to supervise, because safety is a priority.  But I&#39;d love any other or additional suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yes, we know we need additional help with 7yo&#39;s anger.  So far we&#39;ve seen two therapists, had phone consults with 2 others, talked with the ped and with a child psychologist who&#39;s done some preliminary screening.  We live 2-3 hours from any major city or even suburbs, so finding people we like who can actually see and work with our child and who go beyond behavioral reward systems is a challenge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511905807">Katherine,<br/>
I don&#39;t have much time to write, so I&#39;m going to make this quick, and <br/>
if I think of anything else, I&#39;ll post later.  Have you considered <br/>
food allergies?  I have had a similar experience with anger outbursts <br/>
(they were major...) from my now 11year old son when he was around <br/>
5.  I took him to the ped and tried everything I could think of, then <br/>
realized one day that I&#39;d been increasing dairy in his diet w/out <br/>
realizing it--and I knew he was sensitive when he was younger, but <br/>
the symptoms of too much dairy had changed, and before this I didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that allergies could affect behavior.  Anyway, after getting <br/>
all dairy out of his system (this took about 2 months) I noticed a <br/>
huge improvement.  Then periodically I would &quot;test&quot; to see if it <br/>
still affected him by giving him a little bit and seeing what would <br/>
happen.  We were able to figure out how much was &quot;too much&quot;.  <br/>
Eventually, he&#39;s been able to eat dairy again.  I had him allergy <br/>
tested when he was 9 or 10 and found out that it didn&#39;t show up as an <br/>
allergy anymore, but I personally think he still has a slight <br/>
sensitivity and as he gets older is more able to manage it.  Also, <br/>
the whole process was a real education about food choices for him at <br/>
a young age, as well as me!<br/>
Just something to think about... And remember that you know your <br/>
child better than anyone else.<br/>

Yes, I did validate and empathize -- even the parts about wanting to throw his brother down the stairs (although actually he didn&#39;t use that line today).<br/>
<br/>
I read Faber/Mazlish&#39;s books when I was in college and someone loaned a copy of one to my mom:-)  Actually, I lead a book group on Siblings without Rivalry a couple years ago -- at which point, although I did not claim any expertise, I did have two children who got along amazingly well.  Still do, but the younger pair are a different scene.<br/>
<br/>
Naomi and Jan are the two therapists I&#39;ve done phone consults with -- months with Naomi and a couple sessions with Jan.  Both have wonderful input to offer, but they can&#39;t work with my child (who won&#39;t even talk to grandparents he knows well on the phone).  I&#39;ve come to recognize he needs someone in addition to me to help him learn to manage frustration better and to help me recognize what his personal limitations and challenges are.  I can be part of the process, but I can&#39;t be the only one.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of Scott Noelle; I&#39;ll have to look him up.  Even if he can&#39;t meet my child, I&#39;ve definitely learned from all the different people I&#39;ve read and talked with, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll gain something.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really have ideas &quot;in the moment&quot; but thoughts about &quot;next <br/>
time&quot;. The first would be to talk with the grands and ask them not <br/>
to send anything at all to the kids without clearing it with the <br/>
parents first, or to send it to dad&#39;s workplace. That gives you a <br/>
wider range of options in terms of communicating with the kids <br/>
before-hand and looking for solutions proactively. That&#39;s something <br/>
you can generalize to other situations, too, not just gifts: giving <br/>
everyone in the family some advance notice of changes and talking <br/>
about the potential &quot;fallout&quot; from those changes.<br/>
<br/>
The other thought I have is more general - what do each of the kids <br/>
have to say? Not just about this particular instance, but are the 4 <br/>
and 10 yr olds interested in trying to help things go more smoothly <br/>
with their bro? I don&#39;t know your family situation, but my stepson <br/>
came to live with us from a household that was *much* more top-down <br/>
than our family, so I tend to approach these sorts of issues from <br/>
the perspective of &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot;. Rather than <br/>
saying &quot;how can we help your little sister?&quot; I start from &quot;lets see <br/>
if we can brainstorm some ideas so she&#39;s not driving you nuts&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I find involving Ray in the problem solving helps alot - his ideas <br/>
are sometimes better than mine, and he appreciates that he&#39;s being <br/>
treated as a partner in the process. *That* makes him willing <br/>
to &quot;put up&quot; with a bit more from a boistrous 5yr old when we can&#39;t <br/>
find any solutions in the moment. He at least feels like we&#39;re all <br/>
on the same team. <br/>
<br/>
Kids are different, and sometimes one kid in a family needs more <br/>
attention and energy than the others. Working towards an environment <br/>
where &quot;everyone&#39;s needs are valued&quot; can create a more peaceful <br/>
family than focussing on trying to be &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;balanced&quot;. That can <br/>
be a hard idea to get used to - most parenting advice tends toward <br/>
giving kids &quot;equal time&quot; or energy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478905757">Hi Elysia,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have considered food allergies/sensitivities.  We eliminated dairy beginning in December.  Things seem better, but not better enough -- and it&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;s the diet or other changes we&#39;ve made.  In any case it&#39;s not the drastic change I&#39;ve heard others talk about.   I&#39;ve been stocking up on gluten-free items, and need to figure out a gluten-free menu, and we&#39;ll try that elimination too after Valentine&#39;s I think.  If those don&#39;t do it, we&#39;ll probably try Feingold.  I&#39;d like to get him allergy tested, but at the moment that would involve serious coercion.  (The last time he had vaccinations required 5 nurses -- never again.)  <br/>
<br/>
I have become convinced that there&#39;s an organic basis of some sort to his anger and aggression.  I spent months questionning everything I&#39;d ever done as a parent, until I finally recognized that even friends with the sweetest children I know are not 100% consistent, compassionate, etc, and they all do things differently from one another.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this has gotten off-topic.  I really just meant to pose a conflict from our home life and see how other unschoolers would approach it.  The good news is, so far it seems they&#39;d do a lot of the same things I&#39;ve done:-)<br/>

process his anger, and I know how it feels to want to help with that <br/>
intense emotion but also be caught up in the intense protective emotion <br/>
of your own for your other children. It&#39;s a really heart-wrenching place <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your husband is really available and willing to help <br/>
out--that&#39;s wonderful! I know we do so much better when dh is really <br/>
around and available to spend time with Sam, and having that extra adult <br/>
is invaluable! (Although sometimes Jim adds his own layer of issues. *g*)<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to offer more details? Because at face value, <br/>
shredding newspaper doesn&#39;t sound like a bad thing to me; in fact, it&#39;s <br/>
a strategy we tried for a while to see if it helped release some of <br/>
Sam&#39;s anger. I know of other parents who&#39;ve successfully found a <br/>
&quot;breaking place&quot; where the child could go and smash things like old <br/>
china from garage sales or bang things with hammers.<br/>
<br/>
Those kinds of things have never really worked for Sam--he&#39;s just not <br/>
interested in redirecting his anger energy in that way. What we&#39;ve found <br/>
to be most successful is finding a safe place where he can simply vent <br/>
in his own in-the-moment way. I&#39;ve had to learn over the years how to be <br/>
present and calm for him while he&#39;s venting, allowing his anger to flow <br/>
around me without taking it personally or trying to stop it. I&#39;ve found <br/>
that when I directly engage his energy with my own, that the situation <br/>
escalates and spirals out of control.<br/>
<br/>
Visualization has worked really well as a tool for me. I try to sit, <br/>
close my eyes and imagine myself as a mountain of calm. Sam gets to a <br/>
space where verbalization--trying to talk to him, to rationalize with <br/>
him, to even validate him--is impossible. But, if I simply work at being <br/>
present without talking, without expecting resolution, just being a <br/>
calm, loving, available presence for him, he will move through his rage <br/>
and get to a place where he can begin to process it. And with several <br/>
years of doing this, and him trusting that I will be there and trusting <br/>
that I am his partner in his process, I can honestly see a *huge* <br/>
difference from where we were three years ago. Part of that, certainly, <br/>
is age, but there&#39;s a huge part of it that is Sam&#39;s trust in the process <br/>
and trust that he *can* handle the incredibly intense emotions raging <br/>
through his body, that *I* can handle those incredibly intense emotions.<br/>
<br/>
There are absolutely times when this gets *exhausting*, and it&#39;s really, <br/>
really important that I keep up my own personal reserves and energy to <br/>
be available to him.<br/>
<br/>
This, too, is only one side of the process--the part that has to do with <br/>
how to handle situations once they&#39;ve gotten to this stage. There&#39;s a <br/>
whole &#39;nother, larger part of the process that has to do with <br/>
*preventing* the escalation and *cultivating* calming and coping <br/>
strategies for dealing with and dissipating intense emotion as it&#39;s <br/>
mounting. I also highly recommend what I call an &quot;autonomy inventory,&quot; <br/>
which is an observational list of all the ways your guy is empowered/ <br/>
disempowered during his day. Not just the things he hears from you, but <br/>
the things the world hands him on his plate--too big, too small, too <br/>
weak, etc. What can&#39;t he reach, what can&#39;t he do, all the times reality <br/>
doesn&#39;t match the vision in his head, the weather, the time, etc., all <br/>
the things out of his control. That will both help you see the world <br/>
from his perspective and demonstrate the places where you can make <br/>
empowering changes for him.<br/>
<br/>
I may have a different perspective on this process than what you&#39;re <br/>
comfortable with, however, and certainly, I can&#39;t know to what extent <br/>
you&#39;re dealing with anger from this one post.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, am very opposed to outside intervention and therapists. <br/>
*deep sigh* I think they send the message that a child&#39;s emotions are <br/>
not only too big for him to deal with, but also too big for mom and <br/>
dad--that the child *himself* is too much for mom and dad. Sometimes the <br/>
intense emotions *are* too big for mom and dad, absolutely, but I don&#39;t <br/>
believe that added layer of labeling and intervention helps the child.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve done, instead, is to read as much as I can, to spend as much <br/>
time with my child, observing my child, and empowering myself as the <br/>
expert. I&#39;ve adapted lots of tools from books to our lives, and we&#39;ve <br/>
found them really helpful, but I&#39;ve been able to do this without Sam <br/>
feeling as if he&#39;s a &quot;problem.&quot; And, I think that&#39;s really crucial.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, this is long, and I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s been helpful or <br/>
not. I&#39;d be happy to talk about<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518627655">Can I ask a question (okay, a couple of questions)? What do you mean that the four year <br/>
old can play with it later &#39;when the seven year old isn&#39;t there&#39;? Is he gone regularly? What I <br/>
am reading is that the needs of the seven year old supercedes the needs of the rest of the <br/>
family, is that right? His jealousy is such that the 7yo wants to play with it without the 4yo <br/>
being involved? The 4yo doesn&#39;t want to share? The 4yo was anxious because he was <br/>
scared of the 7yo, or because he knew he was losing a new toy? The seven yo received lots <br/>
of attention and soothing, did the 4yo receive any as well? I&#39;m just not reading the entire <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
I ask not because I&#39;m trying to be snotty, but because it sounds familiar. We have a lot of <br/>
issues in our house as well, and it is hard to balance the needs of everyone. Our nine year <br/>
old has frequent outbursts and we&#39;ve had to work very hard to maintain normalcy for the <br/>
rest of the children. I&#39;ve also quite a bit of experience helping other families with extreme <br/>
behaviors, due to my position in the autism society. It sounds like you are doing a really <br/>
great job trying to find help for your whole family, and especially your seven year old son. <br/>
A lot of it does get better as they get older and get a lot of personal experience under <br/>
their belts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to find a good psychologist who will work with you on your terms, ours has been <br/>
a lifesaver. I wish you luck on that one. <br/>

&gt; In the light of the discussion of sharing problems on unschooling lists, here&#39;s one I&#39;d <br/>
like input on:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday my 4yo received a belated birthday gift from the grandparents -- a wooden <br/>
castle and set of figures (knights, horses, wizard, dragon).  To say that my 7yo, whose <br/>
frustration threshold is extremely low, is beside himself with jealousy is a gross <br/>
understatement.  Yesterday I had to call dh home from work to help because he was so <br/>
furious (and it was lunchtime and I was expecting AAA to show up to tow the van any <br/>
moment).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This morning while I was in the shower something happened, I don&#39;t know what, but dh <br/>
sent 10yo to get me and when I went down 7yo was shredding newsprint, kicking and <br/>
screaming at dh while 4yo was hovering anxiously over castle.  Now, an hour later, we&#39;ve <br/>
put the castle in hiding although not before 7yo grabbed most of the figures (which he still <br/>
has).  So far I&#39;ve said that 4yo can have the castle (since it was his gift) later when 7yo <br/>
won&#39;t be here -- not to punish 7yo but to keep 4yo safe.  I also said that I want the castle <br/>
to be something that brings joy and happiness and fun to our family and that we need to <br/>
figure out how we can play with it so that that happens before we bring it back out.  I also <br/>
spent a long time sitting with 7yo, comforting and offering kisses and lots of reflective <br/>
listening.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the moment I&#39;m thinking the castle simply has to be away unless an adult (or possibly <br/>
only a mommy) is available to supervise, because safety is a priority.  But I&#39;d love any other <br/>
or additional suggestions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and yes, we know we need additional help with 7yo&#39;s anger.  So far we&#39;ve seen two <br/>
therapists, had phone consults with 2 others, talked with the ped and with a child <br/>
psychologist who&#39;s done some preliminary screening.  We live 2-3 hours from any major <br/>
city or even suburbs, so finding people we like who can actually see and work with our <br/>
child and who go beyond behavioral reward systems is a challenge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734327122">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s off topic at all. Food allergies have made a big difference in our household. In <br/>
addition, finding replacements has been very important to us in terms of RU, because we <br/>
want our kids with allergies to have as many choices as our children without. We tried to have <br/>
an allergen free home, but that wasn&#39;t fair to our other kids. It&#39;s a crazy balance! We did a <br/>
total wheat-free and casein-free diet with our daughter, but in the long run, it was corn. Not <br/>
just corn syrup, but corn meal, corn starch, dextrose, any sweetner with a corn base. Lovely. <br/>
<br/>
But there are two different children in Breanna, one with corn and one without. They are <br/>
complete and total opposites, and for the most part, once she was used to living without corn <br/>
syrup, she is happy not to have it. We have learned a LOT , we make our own candy, suckers, <br/>
marshmallows and often our own soda because artificial sweeteners give me the heebies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110587351">Thanks Danielle for the links. <br/>
I wanted to point out that I also only suggest outside help for the parent and not the child. <br/>
I have never gotten counseling so I could change my children but for me to change how I was dealing with them ( the old records playing without me being able to stop them...). <br/>
When my brother was little all the schools believed he had some issues so mom ended up taking him to a child psychologist ( or some one like that) for a while. This was a bright, smart, loving and energetic child that hated school .  If it was today they sure would have put him on medication. He grew up thinking he had a problem and that was a burden his whole life. Nowadays my mom realizes what a mistake that was and if it was today she would have unschooled all of us. When I was growing up in Brazil homeschooling was not on the map.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058054143">Danielle&#39;s post was really great, and I have come to the same <br/>
conclusions with my daughter.  Darcy is 12 now, but those years <br/>
between 5 and 8 were really really tough.  We had some incidents <br/>
similar to the one you described, Katharine, and there were a few <br/>
memorable ones with cousins that were exacerbated by being in <br/>
someone else&#39;s house with other people&#39;s input etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that there are some 7 year olds that are open to discussing <br/>
their anger and how to prevent it or ways to control impulses, such <br/>
as counting or breathing.  And I suppose there are also some that <br/>
are willing to talk to a doctor about these things.  But knowing my <br/>
daughter, I knew that a doctor would be distinctly unhelpful and, as <br/>
Danielle suggested, send her wrong messages about herself.  When she <br/>
was 7, she was just not able to talk about her rages.  She just <br/>
could not access those feelings when they weren&#39;t there, and when <br/>
they were, she was so full of them that she could hardly talk at <br/>
all.  In those situations where she grabbed something, there was <br/>
just no time for her to think about what she was doing - it just <br/>
happened so fast.  Some people think that if you just &quot;teach&quot; a <br/>
child that grabbing is wrong, it will never happen again.  <br/>
<br/>
What helped the most was a lot like what Danielle does with Sam - <br/>
going to another room and just listening.  And after the storm <br/>
passed, validating and talking about ways to get what she wanted.  <br/>
Katharine, have you talked to your son about what he wants?  Does he <br/>
really want a toy like his brother has?  Does he get some sort of <br/>
allowance that he could possibly save up for something he wants?  Do <br/>
you ever just buy him a cool toy that he likes?  I mean, do you <br/>
think that it is really the toy itself that he wants?  <br/>
<br/>
It can be so hard to balance things when there is one explosive <br/>
child.  It isn&#39;t &quot;fair&quot; to the other child/children.  We certainly <br/>
have some issues in our family where everyone feels like they have <br/>
to walk on eggshells around Darcy.  It&#39;s really hard.<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful to explore the issue of food sensitivity, and <br/>
that&#39;s usually the first thing people will suggest, especially on <br/>
unschooling lists.  It might be helpful to talk to a therapist.  It <br/>
might also be helpful to accept where your son is right now and let <br/>
him know that you are there to help him and listen to what he wants <br/>
and try to find ways to get what he wants (without hurting his <br/>
brother).<br/>

do things workout with 4yo? Do you take away the 7yo&#39;s toy until the <br/>
4yo isnt around?<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you thought of maving closer to a city so that your son <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590349603">***At the moment I&#39;m thinking the castle simply has to be away unless an <br/>
adult (or<br/>
possibly only a mommy) is available to supervise, because safety is a <br/>
priority.<br/>
But I&#39;d love any other or additional suggestions.***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably already considered this but since it&#39;s the first thing that <br/>
came to mind I&#39;ll put it out there.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s less the castle and more that he&#39;s not the four year old.   If <br/>
he&#39;s seven and your little one is four then he was three when his life <br/>
changed forever because of a new sibling.   Is it possible he&#39;s angry <br/>
because his position as your baby was usurped?<br/>
<br/>
If he got cool stuff for his fourth birthday could you show him those <br/>
pictures?  Maybe pictures that don&#39;t include his baby sibling would be <br/>
better.<br/>
Maybe talk about when he turned four, what happened that day, how much fun <br/>
he had.<br/>
<br/>
Can you spend time with him alone, going places and doing things he loves? <br/>
Can you find some time to be with only him during the day, every day,  and <br/>
in that time talk about when he was born or when he was little and all the <br/>
cute things he did and how much you loved being with him?    It might help <br/>
him to know that his young life included being four years old and getting <br/>
cool birthday presents.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get him a castle too?   Or, if that&#39;s not possible, could you pull <br/>
the castle out at nights when the four year old is asleep, so there&#39;s no <br/>
competition, and just hang out with him and play with the castle and let him <br/>
be your baby?    I don&#39;t mean baby him, in the icky way some people think of <br/>
&quot;babying&quot;, I mean cuddle him and whisper sweet things to him and be focused <br/>
on him the way a mom focuses on a new baby.  Talk about special times with <br/>
him when he was little.  Tell him stories about his little self, funny <br/>
things he did or the way he said certain words.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s angry because his position in the family was usurped by a baby he <br/>
needs to feel all the love he thinks he missed out on when that new baby <br/>
came.  It&#39;s not that you didn&#39;t love him as much as before.  It&#39;s not that <br/>
you didn&#39;t show him that love, it&#39;s how *he felt* when a new baby came and <br/>
he wasn&#39;t the little one in your arms any more.<br/>
<br/>
It might be that he&#39;s feeling like his younger sibling gets all the <br/>
attention, all the love, all the cool toys.  Not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s <br/>
happening!  But from his point of view it might feel like that.   If he gets <br/>
told he can&#39;t do something because of the little one, or if he gets in <br/>
trouble when the little one bugs him to the point he lashes out, or if he <br/>
has to do more things for himself because he&#39;s a big boy and you&#39;re helping <br/>
the littler one, then that&#39;s a lot of sadness and resentment for one little <br/>
body.<br/>

<br/>
because his position as your baby was usurped?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Yup.  I think that&#39;s part of it.  There&#39;s no question that almost all of his anger is directed toward his younger brother, although he does have a low frustration level in general.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb:  If he got cool stuff for his fourth birthday could you show him those <br/>
<br/>
pictures? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:   Hadn&#39;t thought of that.  Might help, though I&#39;m pretty sure that in his mind the castle/knights are the coolest thing that any of them have ever gotten.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb:  Can you spend time with him alone, going places and doing things he loves?  Can you find some time to be with only him during the day, every day,  and <br/>
<br/>
in that time talk about when he was born or when he was little and all the <br/>
<br/>
cute things he did and how much you loved being with him? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:  We&#39;ve been trying to do more of this.  Doesn&#39;t sound very &quot;unschooly&quot; but we started having an afternoon &quot;Quiet Time&quot; a couple months ago, where each of the boys goes to a separate room with whatever toys he chooses and I cycle through and spend 20-30 minutes with each of them alone.  (Can&#39;t safely leave the younger two together unsupervised, so has to be each to his own space.)  The boys all love the time alone with me and the older two love the time by themselves as well; the younger one sometimes needs to come and play in the same  room when I&#39;m with the oldest.  We&#39;ve also been trying to have occasional &quot;dates&quot; with child and either dh or myself -- but the boys (including 7yo) also want to play D&D when dh is home so it&#39;s a bit of a balancing act.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb:  Can you get him a castle too?   Or, if that&#39;s not possible, could you pull <br/>
<br/>
the castle out at nights when the four year old is asleep, so there&#39;s no <br/>
<br/>
competition, and just hang out with him and play with the castle <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:  I did ask if he&#39;d like to use some of his money (he has plenty and no plans for saving it for something in particular) to buy some of his own knights or suggested we could build another castle, but he wasn&#39;t interested.  It&#39;s more about the first one&#39;s &quot;belonging&quot; to the little one (although all the toys are shared and in common space).  Actually, a friend just loaned us a Playmobile-like castle and pirate set thinking that might help diffuse the initial intensity over the birthday castle.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at pictures and talking about when he was four is a good idea.  I do think he still feels displaced, and I think having the younger now be at an age where he wants to play with the others has made it even more difficult.  He&#39;s not only displaced, but he has a rival for toys and for the oldest brother&#39;s attention as well.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625842648">I don&#39;t recall what the 7yo got for his birthday!  The reason for putting the castle away was because the fights get physical.  Actually, from a physical standpoint, they&#39;re more attacks than fights -- very one-sided.  This was the second biggie in the 24 hours since the castle had been opened.  What I told them was that we needed to put the castle away until we could figure out how we could play with it without anyone&#39;s getting hurt.  But I knew that during &quot;Quiet Time&quot; (which I explained in response to another post) the 4yo could play with his gift safely.  He was getting bitten (or would have if dh hadn&#39;t pulled 7yo off) *and* losing his present (for a little while -- but I knew it seemed forever in his mind).  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t really happy with my putting the castle up but I didn&#39;t see a whole lot of in-the-moment alternatives -- which is why I posted.  Often, if I&#39;m right there and see it coming (but sometimes I don&#39;t), I can get between them, reassure everyone that we can find a solution that will work for everyone, and 7yo won&#39;t spiral out of control.  But the castle was definitely precipitating some serious spiraling.<br/>
<br/>
Re moving closer to a city... in many ways we&#39;d love to, and it&#39;s possible that something will come up for dh, but he&#39;s not in a field where telecommuting is a possibility nor one where he can easily choose where he wants to live and then look for a job locally.<br/>

            Just wondering, when 7yo recieves a present for his borthday... how <br/>
<br/>
do things workout with 4yo? Do you take away the 7yo&#39;s toy until the <br/>
<br/>
4yo isnt around?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you thought of maving closer to a city so that your son <br/>

could get the help he needs on a regular basis?<br/>

I&#39;m sure that there are some 7 year olds that are open to discussing <br/>
<br/>
their anger and how to prevent it or ways to control impulses, such <br/>
<br/>
as counting or breathing.  And I suppose there are also some that <br/>
<br/>
are willing to talk to a doctor about these things.  But knowing my <br/>
<br/>
daughter, I knew that a doctor would be distinctly unhelpful and, as <br/>
<br/>
Danielle suggested, send her wrong messages about herself.  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful to explore the issue of food sensitivity, and <br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s usually the first thing people will suggest, especially on <br/>
<br/>
unschooling lists.  It might be helpful to talk to a therapist.  It <br/>
<br/>
might also be helpful to accept where your son is right now and let <br/>
<br/>
him know that you are there to help him and listen to what he wants <br/>

and try to find ways to get what he wants (without hurting his <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198552311">I think potentially though a doctor or therapist may have more information that could be helpful.  I&#39;d read parts before, but I recently read Ross Greene&#39;s The Explosive Child completely and surprised myself by how much I appreciated his description of the different routes that can lead to inflexible-explosive reactions.  He really emphasized how important it can be to know which routes are causing a problem for your child.  Depending on the route you might respond in different ways to help minimize their frustration.  The therapist may be able to model different ways of approaching issues that I wouldn&#39;t think of in their interaction with my child.  Plus, while I know my child better than anyone else, my ability to describe that child so that they have a good image is not as effective as actually meeting him.  When you meet him, then you experience what &quot;shy&quot; means for this child.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that counseling shouldn&#39;t be to try and change someone else.  (My in-laws tried that once.)<br/>

            I wanted to point out that I also only suggest outside help for the parent and not the child. <br/>
<br/>
I have never gotten counseling so I could change my children but for me to change how I was dealing with them ( the old records playing without me being able to stop them...). <br/>

I have a 12-YO diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s.  Many therapists are not <br/>
very helpful, although I have met several I was impressed with.  Have <br/>
you heard of RDI (Relational Development Intervention)?  I think this <br/>
approach is wonderful for improving social skills, play, working with <br/>
others, etc.  The parent works with the child doing various <br/>
activities (folding blankets together, etc.).  Then they assign a <br/>
play buddy who is approximately at the same level.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559072853">I think maybe instead of talking with the kids about how to play <br/>
with the castle nicely (which I don&#39;t see why the 4yo would even be <br/>
involved in that conversation since you say it&#39;s totally one sided), <br/>
why not sit down and talk about how to deal with your 7yo acting <br/>
out.  Maybe you could say to him &quot;when you are fighting <br/>
with &quot;brother&quot; what do you think mommy and daddy should do? Do you <br/>
think it is fair for me to take away brothers toys, or do you think <br/>
it is fair for me to ask you to calm down in your room?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you included him in the reasoning, he may not see it as a <br/>
punishment but more of as a means for him to regroup and get his <br/>
thoughts straight and let off a little frustration in privacy. Have <br/>
you tried explaning to him why it hurts brother when he bites or <br/>
hits? Maybe remind him of a time when he was hurt and ask him how he <br/>
felt?<br/>
<br/>
This is what we did when my second daughter began crawling and <br/>
taking older daughters toys. We explained to older daughter that <br/>
younger daughter only wanted to play as well, but we let her pick <br/>
one very special toy that was all hers. Whenever she was getting <br/>
frustrated that her sister was taking all of her things, she would <br/>
go and get this one toy (a doll) that she knew was only hers. <br/>
Whenever younger daughter would then try to take the doll, I would <br/>
say to her &quot;no that is your sisters doll, and only her toy&quot; and then <br/>
we decided to pick out a toy that was &quot;only&quot; her toy (for older <br/>
daughters sake since the younger one didnt understand lol).<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect, I remember seeing both of them share their &quot;special&quot; <br/>
toys with each other because they wanted to, not because they had to.<br/>
<br/>
What if you gave 7yo a special toy that younger brother oculd not <br/>
have and made 4yos castle (or whatever toy he likes best) his <br/>
special toy?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought... :)<br/>

Actually, from a physical standpoint, they&#39;re more attacks than <br/>
fights -- very one-sided.  This was the second biggie in the 24 <br/>
hours since the castle had been opened.  What I told them was that <br/>
we needed to put the castle away until we could figure out how we <br/>
could play with it without anyone&#39;s getting hurt.  But I knew that <br/>
during &quot;Quiet Time&quot; (which I explained in response to another post) <br/>
the 4yo could play with his gift safely.  He was getting bitten (or <br/>
would have if dh hadn&#39;t pulled 7yo off) *and* losing his present <br/>
(for a little while -- but I knew it seemed forever in his mind).  <br/>

<br/>
How did you figure out it was corn?  This is what&#39;s so frustrating to me -- it seems everytime I decide to try one elimination someone comes forth and suggests a different one!  Dairy, gluten, corn, Feingold/salicylates.  Did you know that pistachios, cashews, and mangos belong to the same family?  That one&#39;s been suggested too, although while my kids love those we don&#39;t have them regularly enough for me to believe they can possibly be the root issue for us!  <br/>

 We did a <br/>
<br/>
total wheat-free and casein-free diet with our daughter, but in the long run, it was corn. Not <br/>
<br/>
just corn syrup, but corn meal, corn starch, dextrose, any sweetner with a corn base. Lovely. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895919596">Hi Melissa, <br/>
<br/>
Sure, you can ask a question -- or a lot of them:-)  Actually, I think I answered a number of them in my reply to Danielle where I explained the whole scenario in detail, so I won&#39;t repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Do the needs of the 7yo supercede the needs of the rest of the family?  Sometimes it feels that way -- his needs are pretty intense these days, and if they aren&#39;t met then some of the basic needs of the rest of the family aren&#39;t met either like safety of self and possessions.  The four year old did receive some comforting and explanation, but not until later by which point he&#39;d moved on to other things anyway.  Today the 4yo explained that he was afraid the castle would get hurt when he wasn&#39;t playing with, although he quickly acknowledged that he didn&#39;t think the 7yo would hurt it because the 7yo likes playing with it.  Not convinced that that was really what was going through 4yo&#39;s mind the other day though.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any new suggestions from your own experience, I&#39;d love to hear them on or off list.  It&#39;s quite likely that both of my older boys are diagnosable on the autism spectrum, but we&#39;ve never gone that route.  Oldest is happy, focused, productive just highly energetic, impulsive, and socially immature.  Middle is more of a concern to me because of both the anger and the underlying sense that he&#39;s not really happy (although that&#39;s seeming better to me recently) -- he&#39;s also *really* shy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Katharine<br/>

            Can I ask a question (okay, a couple of questions)? &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I ask not because I&#39;m trying to be snotty, but because it sounds familiar. &lt;snip&gt;I&#39;ve also quite a bit of experience helping other families with extreme <br/>
<br/>
behaviors, due to my position in the autism society. It sounds like you are doing a really great job trying to find help for your whole family, and especially your seven year old son.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572345822">At the risk of being severely offtopic, my son is allergic to wheat, he doesn&#39;t just have <br/>
celiac, but also an actual anaphylactic reaction to any wheat product. While getting used to <br/>
that, we were on nearly complete rice/corn diet. By fluke, we had rice products for a week, <br/>
and then one day had something with corn. She had been doing good, but wigged out <br/>
completely. When we mentioned it to our therapist, she&#39;s the one who made the <br/>
connection. We eliminated it, along with all the other corn stuff. It has made a huge <br/>
difference in her rage and in her stim behaviors (head banging, self mutilation, etc) In fact, <br/>
that&#39;s how we found out pringles were fried in corn oil, ack! At a family gathering no less. <br/>
<br/>
It really is hard, especially when you&#39;re unschooling, and trying to let them make their own <br/>
choices. Today she kept grabbing the bowl of suckers, and I was just wincing, thinking if <br/>
she eats these we are sooo screwed for days, because it takes that long to come down. <br/>
Some days just pointing out that they have corn can bring on anger outbursts. Fortunately <br/>
tonight the store had in stock the sugar free tootsie rolls, which are corn free. I bought <br/>
them out!<br/>
