<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076477944">HI all. As you know we are transitioning to a more unschooly way of life. About a week ago I posted about my oldest seeming to want a limit on game time. I took your suggsetions and all seems well with that.<br/>
   I have noticed something new though. Both of my boys (the ones who have had the most school at home,chores and me pushing them) have started a physical pushing,of hugs that turn into a show of force,games that turn into bullying and name calling. All of this is directed at me! Suddenly my boys have no respect for me ! I feel like they are pushing me until I say OK! You cannot do ... and these are the consequences!  Help!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They could be trying to figure out what the boundaries are - maybe  <br/>
worried about your mental health if they feel like there are suddenly  <br/>
NO boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
When you say, &#39;....and these are the consequences.&quot; do you mean  <br/>
punishments?<br/>
<br/>
Be a person who deserves their respect - you&#39;ll get it. Be strong,  <br/>
smart, and wise along with being understanding, compassionate, and  <br/>
FUN! (Too much to ask? Hey, YOU chose to have kids! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let them be too rough with you or name call, without saying,  <br/>
&quot;Hey, NOT okay. Stop it now.&quot; And put space between you and them so  <br/>
they can&#39;t hurt you. Don&#39;t just let them do it. But that&#39;s all you  <br/>
need to do - that IS the consequence, that you won&#39;t allow it to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Same if they&#39;re hurting or name-calling at each other - you put a stop  <br/>
to it because it is not okay. You wouldn&#39;t let a stranger come into  <br/>
your house and do that to your kids, don&#39;t let one do it to the other  <br/>
either. So stop it - be clear and do what it takes to stop it. But,  <br/>
you don&#39;t need follow-up punishments. In fact, even better if you can  <br/>
stop the behaviors while moving on to something wonderful and  <br/>
interesting and fun.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do NOT hit your brother.&quot; (While you step between them and physically  <br/>
separate them.) &quot;Hey, do you guys want to watch XYZ with me?&quot;<br/>

How old are they?<br/>
<br/>
Do you and your husband show respect for &quot;no&quot; &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;it hurts&quot; ?? <br/>
Do the boys understand it?<br/>
<br/>
Do they quit pushing you (literally or figuratively??) when you say, <br/>
&quot;You cannot...&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If so, why don&#39;t you say stop sooner---BEFORE it escalates?<br/>
<br/>
A LOT of this is about stopping things before they become an <br/>
issue---being present and noticing *before* things get out of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874845764">There is a simple solution. Children react much more to body language than to words. Simply initiate a eye to eye stare and they will immediately know what you are thinking and know if you are serious or not. If you position yourself in front of them and demand them to focus on you, you&#39;ll be amazed at how fast they&#39;ll calm down with nary a word spoken by you. Its all body language.<br/>

Then he starts to squeeze and push me. I say &quot;OK,that&#39;s too rough.&quot; He continues to squeeze and push me off the trail. I am  saying &quot;stop, no more!&quot;,but now we are in a pushing match . I am pushing the kid off of me, he is trying to push me over or keep this forceful hug thing going on. This is now turning into wrestling. He jumps on my back with his hand around my face. I am not so calm, going into defensive mode. I feel like I am going to have to use force ,but I don&#39;t want to hurt my kid. I peel him off and grab his arms,look right at him and say &quot;I am done! I am not wrestling with you!&quot; So he comes at me again. I am standing in the woods with 4 kids,there is really nowhere else  that is &quot;away&quot;.I cannot walk unless I can get him to stop wrestling with me.  At this point the 11 year old joins in the &quot;game&quot;, and helps his<br/>
 brother try to push me over. They are laughing and they either just aren&#39;t getting that I am really pissed off right now or they don&#39;t care. It only stops when somebody actually gets hurt,like they hurt each other by accident or if I shove them away and they fall over, then we are all stalking off back to the car and everybody is really fuming. The younger two are upset because their fun time at the stream was ruined and they had to leave,I&#39;m livid because I have just been under attack, and the boys are mad because they got hurt and they are sure it was done to them on purpose. They aren&#39;t getting the fact that they kept pushing  and playing UNTIL they got hurt.<br/>
  I am thinking why don&#39;t they stop? What do they want? Do they want me to say &quot;if you don&#39;t stop I&#39;m going to do____?&quot; I have tried saying &quot;remember last time when you got hurt?&quot; and they still don&#39;t stop.<br/>
  For what it&#39;s worth I have though that maybe they just want some more physical attention. I don&#39;t know how I can do more at this point though. We have a family bed,there is always somebody on my lap,or snuggling .   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645505747">In answer to Kelly&#39;s question of if DH and I model stopping when someone says stop, yes we do. DH and I will play fight sometimes, but we always stop when someone says &quot;OK! I&#39;m done!&quot; The only exception I can think of is we have done the scene where lets say DH wants to put an ice cube down the back of my shirt and I will screech &quot;no! no! NOOOOO!&quot; but I am laughing  and have a big grin. Although no doesn&#39;t always mean no with me and DH, &quot;stop&quot; always means stop with DH, me and the kids. We have always stopped tickling  and chasing games as soon as they say anything ...&quot;stop&quot;,&quot; no&quot; ,&quot;I don&#39;t like it&quot;,&quot;ow!&quot; <br/>

that really means to stop immediately. Maybe even say you want to  <br/>
practice - make a game out of THAT. Sort of like playing &quot;Red Light  <br/>
Green Light.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, if that doesn&#39;t seem workable, if things have gone past that,  <br/>
then I&#39;d say you do have to say they can&#39;t touch you in play - just  <br/>
very very gently, because they aren&#39;t listening and responding when  <br/>
you say stop.<br/>

<br/>
So you&#39;re agreeing to *play* with him.<br/>
<br/>
They do NOT understand the meaning of &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop.&quot; And you&#39;re <br/>
pushing back.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>

This is now turning into<br/>
wrestling. He jumps on my back with his hand around my face. I am not <br/>

going into defensive mode.<br/>

<br/>
Up to this point, why *are* you still calm?<br/>
<br/>
What would you do/say if *I* did that to you?<br/>
<br/>
My response would be---waaay early-on---&quot;HEY! KNOCK IT OFF! I SAID <br/>
STOP!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am going to have to use force ,but I<br/>
don&#39;t want to hurt my kid.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to *hurt* him, but you can certainly STOP him <br/>
physically. Take him by the arm and pull him away from you.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I peel him off and grab his arms,look right at him<br/>
and say &quot;I am done! I am not wrestling with you!&quot; So he comes at me <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn&#39;t he believe you? What *other* message is he getting?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am standing in the woods with 4 kids,there is really nowhere else  <br/>
that is &quot;away&quot;.I<br/>
cannot walk unless I can get him to stop wrestling with me.  At this <br/>
point the<br/>
11 year old joins in the &quot;game&quot;, and helps his brother try to push me <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
WHAT???!!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They are laughing and they either just aren&#39;t<br/>
getting that I am really pissed off right now<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. What do you look like when you&#39;re pissed off? I don&#39;t think <br/>
they know.<br/>

What would you do if a stranger did all that to you?<br/>

 or they don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Worse.<br/>
<br/>
OK---*WHY* would they not care?<br/>
<br/>
What messages are you sending that would give them this impression?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It only stops when somebody actually gets hurt,like they hurt each <br/>
other by accident or if I<br/>
shove them away and they fall over, then we are all stalking off back <br/>
to the car<br/>
and everybody is really fuming.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be setting the scene up *IN THE CAR* *ON THE WAY* to the stream.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OK, Last time we came here, this what happened (brief explanation). I <br/>
don&#39;t want that to happened again. So how do you guys think we can keep <br/>
that from happening again? I need to know that I won&#39;t be pushed around <br/>
and made uncomfortable. What can *I* say that would let you know that <br/>
things are getting too rough? Can we have a secret family word that <br/>
means &#39;stop right now&#39; so that each of us can feel safe? What would <br/>
that word be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Duncan can sometimes get wound up and go overboard a bit. We say <br/>
&quot;bee-beep&quot; and he knows that he needs to tone it down a bit. He uses it <br/>
on me too. &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s just a CUE word to let him know it&#39;s going too far.)<br/>
<br/>
Pick a word that actually MEANS &quot;stop&quot; to them since &quot;stop&quot; in your <br/>
family really has no meaning at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The younger two are upset because their fun time<br/>
at the stream was ruined and they had to leave,I&#39;m livid because I have <br/>
just<br/>
been under attack, and the boys are mad because they got hurt and they <br/>
are sure<br/>
it was done to them on purpose. They aren&#39;t getting the fact that they <br/>
kept<br/>
pushing  and playing UNTIL they got hurt.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But why are you letting it even get *close* to that far?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   I am thinking why don&#39;t they stop? What do they want? Do they want me <br/>
to say<br/>
&quot;if you don&#39;t stop I&#39;m going to do____?&quot; I have tried saying &quot;remember <br/>
last time<br/>
when you got hurt?&quot; and they still don&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This can&#39;t happen &quot;in the moment&quot;---these conversation have to happen <br/>
BEFORE it&#39;s to the point of not being able to stop it. Have a <br/>
conversation tonight. At supper. Or while playing cards. Or in bed. NOT <br/>
while you&#39;re all in the middle of a pushing match.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   For what it&#39;s worth I have though that maybe they just want some more <br/>
physical<br/>
attention. I don&#39;t know how I can do more at this point though. We have <br/>
a family<br/>
bed,there is always somebody on my lap,or snuggling .<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a trampoline?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can you get one?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83967560">I wanted to add to this since it may not be clear from this earlier <br/>
post. While staring them in the eye, you have to stay there until they <br/>
back down. If they see you back down first, then you&#39;ll have gained <br/>
nothing because they will see you backing down as you giving up your <br/>
stance and they will not take you serious.<br/>

not. If you position yourself in front of them and demand them to focus <br/>

and say &quot;I am done! I am not wrestling with you!&quot; So he comes at me<br/>
again.***<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re wrestling with him, that is, wrestling to get him off you and you say, &quot;I am not wrestling with you,&quot; you&#39;re sending two messages and he gets to choose which one to hear.  He will choose the one that is filling his need in the moment, the one that tells him your hands are on him and you&#39;re engaged in a physical match.    Say &quot;Stop it, now.&quot;  Don&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m not wrestling&quot; when you clearly are.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a family dynamic at work that you haven&#39;t recognized yet.  Maybe in the wrestling play between you and your husband the play doesn&#39;t stop as soon as you&#39;re thinking/remembering it does.  As the audience to your play your kids are seeing something you&#39;re not, getting some message you don&#39;t know you&#39;re sending.   End the wrestling play with your husband.  Tell him this other thing needs to get sorted out and don&#39;t engage in it anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Tell your kids in some calm moment, at lunch or whenever, that kind of thing is unacceptable.  You don&#39;t have to go off on your kids just say this is what happens and it will stop.<br/>
This is really not ok.  It&#39;s not ok for a nine and eleven year old to ignore another persons personal boundaries.  Think about how it got to this place.   Take some time to think about your family interactions.  How have you modeled respect for your kids personal boundaries.  Have you overstepped in the past.  Has your husband.   My husband used to engage in physical play and if Dylan said &quot;Ouch&quot; dh would say &quot;That didn&#39;t hurt you!&quot;    A big person can&#39;t decide how much force is too much for a little person.  You can&#39;t decide what someone else feels.  You have to listen to the other guy.  If that kind of thing has gone on at your house you need to stop it.  <br/>
<br/>
If part of your interactions at home include pestering - poking, pinching, tickling, invading another person&#39;s space in anyway, stop it.  If teasing is part of your regular interaction stop that.  Something is working to press these kids on and you should look at everything.<br/>
<br/>
In some calm moment ask them why they escalate physical contact to a power play.  Listen to what they tell you.  <br/>
Keep hugs brief.  Don&#39;t squeeze them, just hug, like you&#39;d hug a fragile old lady.  Step away and reclaim your own space. <br/>
Don&#39;t touch them if they don&#39;t want you to.  Don&#39;t hug them if they don&#39;t want you to.  <br/>
<br/>
Find a way for them to engage in a lot of physical play.  Kelly said &quot;trampoline&quot; and I second that.  Someone else recommended a punching bag.  Really good ideas.  Give them an outlet for their physical energy because they obviously have some need that&#39;s not being met.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176060458">I also wanted to add that it might be helpful to look at how the <br/>
kids interact with each other- do they STOP when one wants to stop- <br/>
we usually say &#39;stop means stop&quot; and it was a signal to STOP -<br/>
<br/>
sometimes we push the kids farther than they want to play or allow <br/>
them to do it to each other. It is not fun if one person is not <br/>
having fun.<br/>
