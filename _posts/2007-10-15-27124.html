<div id="ygrps-yiv-684418904">Alright, this is my first year hsing all 5 of my kids ages <br/>
12,8,7,3,20m. We started out kinda structured and rapidly went to <br/>
total unschooling. I&#39;ve read the books and love the idea, but I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m not &quot;doing&quot; enough. It seems like no actual &quot;work&quot; is ever <br/>
getting done. We read a lot, but no one is interested in writing <br/>
anything, or learning about grammaror math (who wants to do that?) <br/>
or any one subject for longer than it takes me to get some books and <br/>
materials together. They are seeming to get bored very quickly, then <br/>
they want to move onto another topic, and the cycle starts again. <br/>
And I know that true unschooling looks like a lot of random thoughts <br/>
and ideas that actually fit together to make an education, and I&#39;m <br/>
probably just panicking way too early, but I feel like maybe they <br/>
would be better off in school. We&#39;re having a really hard time <br/>
finding other kids to hang with on a consistent basis, and even when <br/>
my kids are in groups with other kids, they tend to cluster together <br/>
and not mingle. I don&#39;t want to end up with a houseful of kids who <br/>
can only interact with each other, y&#39;know? And my oldest (7th grade) <br/>
is talking about maybe wanting to go to VoTech for highschool, and I <br/>
know they&#39;re going to want transcripts, etc, and I honestly don&#39;t <br/>
know what they&#39;ve learned so far this year! My ex-husband is <br/>
requiring tests-of some sort-on who-knows-what to be done once per <br/>
month and I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m going to show him to appease <br/>
him. We have generated almost NO paper! Our normal day consists of <br/>
everyone getting up, eating (at different times) and then the boys <br/>
head off to the library where they spend most of the day on RPG <br/>
games and sometimes help out the librarians, while my daughters stay <br/>
home and play together and watch tv. There&#39;s a lot of outside play <br/>
for the girls and painting/art projects, but the boys aren&#39;t even <br/>
interested in doing that. They all help out around the house and <br/>
have chores and in the evening we either run to Aikido or <br/>
basketball, or stay home where they watch MORE tv! My daughter also <br/>
does gymnastics and piano lessons during the day. So, I guess what <br/>
I&#39;m looking for is suggestions/ideas and for someone to talk me down <br/>
off the ledge. I really LOVE having them home with me all the time, <br/>
and they are doing really well together, and I really don&#39;t want to <br/>
put them in school as a knee-jerk reaction if this is all part of <br/>
the process. Help...?</div>

Relax....and Breathe.... :)<br/>
Your children are being children!  And quite busy children from the sounds<br/>
of it.  Are they happy?  Are they asking to do &#39;schoolwork&#39;?  Unschooling is<br/>
really about allowing them to follow their own path, and we sort of need to<br/>
just get out of the way so they can do that.  (while always being VERY<br/>
available, to help them navigate, talk about what&#39;s interesting to them,<br/>
answer their questions, provide other resources/opportunities).<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like your biggest concern/fear is the requirement laid down<br/>
by your husband that they test once per month.  Ooo, that&#39;s a toughie for<br/>
me.  My reaction would be to say &quot;Forget It&quot;!  (but that&#39;s just my big mouth<br/>
way!)  I&#39;m sure you want him to be comfortable and supportive of this<br/>
decision, and he likely shares the same fear with you, of your children not<br/>
&quot;doing anything&quot;, which in turn, worsens your fear, and so begins a vicious<br/>
cycle! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could start a blog?  There, you could chronicle what you did each<br/>
day or week, or whenever you feel inspired.  You could put up lots of<br/>
pictures of what&#39;s going on in your home.  You&#39;ll be surprised to see and<br/>
find all that learning happening, even it it doesn&#39;t consist of &quot;doing math&quot;<br/>
or &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;grammar practice&quot;.  I bet your older kids would even love<br/>
to have their own blog.  Lots of writing required, there, too!  (And it&#39;ll<br/>
be FUN and meaningful to them (but only if *they* want to do it).<br/>
<br/>
I guess the biggest question I would ask myself is:  &quot;Are my children<br/>
content?  Are they happy?&quot;  If they are, what more could I ask for?  Of<br/>
course, they aren&#39;t going to be happy every second of every day, but in<br/>
those moments,  I can really step in and meet that need, whatever it might<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here and Trust that your children are amazing, whole people who<br/>
are learning every second of every day.  Be available to them, and have fun<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;ll get so much good advice here!<br/>
<br/>
And remember, relax, breathe, find the Joy, and have FUN!<br/>
<br/>

 My son has cycled round passions over time -- and the time varies<br/>
wildly -- on lots of things, from yo-yoing to codes, to fractals, to<br/>
you-name-it.  They get what they need and can absorb at that stage and<br/>
move on.  Sometimes they don&#39;t come back to the topic, sometimes they<br/>
do, repeatedly, as they are ready for more.  It takes time to<br/>
assimilate the material and make it their own.  How much time depends<br/>
on too many factors to quantify.<br/>
<br/>
What if you kept a personal journal of their activities, books, etc? <br/>
Might that help ease your concerns?  Sometimes when you have it there<br/>
on paper, all those things you forgot they were doing can wow you.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

 <br/>
first, its just the first year. they haven&#39;t been out of school very ong at  <br/>
all yet, and this takes time and patience, to move through the deschooling  <br/>
process. longer for some, shorter for others. it took my son, age 18, about 13  <br/>
months to deschool, and of course, he&#39;s not fully deschooled yet. but that is  <br/>
approx. 1 month for each year in school, and that&#39;s a rough gage, each child  <br/>
being different, but its a guide to help you gauge the time it takes to go  <br/>
through this process. <br/>
 <br/>
but you say &quot;lots&quot; of reading...that&#39;s an excellent way to learn grammar,  <br/>
spelling, sentence structure, let alone a subject of interest of course. math  <br/>
will come, it happens very naturally and easily (i am a mathaphobe, and i am  <br/>
deschooling myself, and see how easily it can come when its not taught to me,  <br/>
kwim?) a neat thing you can try, if you like, is creating a budget for your  <br/>
kids. either with real money or a stand-in, its a great way to see math happen  <br/>
and engage basic life skills. perhaps your oldest would be most interested, i <br/>
 don&#39;t know of course, but setting up an excel program, or a real checkbook, <br/>
with  the weekly/monthly bills and income there was a lot of fun for a few <br/>
kids i  know. <br/>
 <br/>
hth, at least a bit! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902489371">Well I just looked the games up and I think if you installed them and poked<br/>
around a bit you&#39;d be surprised at what he&#39;s learning by playing.  I am not<br/>
going to install the games but I would guess there is a hefty amount of<br/>
reading and a certain amount of math involved.  But you should figure it<br/>
out, IMO I wouldn&#39;t let my kid play games I didn&#39;t know anything about<br/>
(especially since on-line MMOs are prime places for pedophiles to find kids)<br/>
but if you did at least see how the games worked, you&#39;d be able to say with<br/>
confidence &quot;He is reading, using math, and complex hand-eye skills.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I play a Star Wars MMORPG and I know I use math all the time, reading, and<br/>
complex and fast figuring of strategy and skill.  There are good things to<br/>
be found in games but you&#39;ll have to actually figure out what he&#39;s getting<br/>
from the games he&#39;s playing.  I&#39;m guessing you will be pleasantly surprised<br/>
at the skills involved and necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827734466">Hi Shannon,<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Shannon too - I&#39;ll start signing my posts with my last initial.<br/>
Welcome to the list.  If this is your first year homeschooling, your oldest<br/>
three are still in the deschooling phase.  There really is a value in<br/>
backing off and letting them recuperate from their past school lives.  They<br/>
already sound very active and healthy.  I believe boredom is not a bad<br/>
thing; it is an opportunity for them to explore what they want to do, or to<br/>
choose to do nothing.  If they have been used to always doing something,<br/>
having deadlines or deliverables, maybe they subconsciously feel guilty or<br/>
unsettled at being presented with the choice of doing &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned concern about math; I hope what you&#39;ll find here alleviates<br/>
that fear.  We enjoy playing games such as Equate, Monopoly, poker, and one<br/>
site we enjoy poking around on is livingmath.net.  The concept, as you<br/>
probably guessed, is to realize that math is all around us and we don&#39;t need<br/>
textbooks to &quot;learn&quot; it.  Thinking outside the box - there is &quot;math&quot; in art<br/>
and music and cooking and hopscotch - it&#39;s everywhere and it&#39;s fun!  The<br/>
creator of the site, a homeschooling mom, does provide curriculum guides, so<br/>
it&#39;s not an unschooling site, but you can use it however you like.  We like<br/>
browsing for interesting looking titles - one library book my girls loved<br/>
was about the ancient Greek librarian who was the first to measure the<br/>
earth.  Right now we&#39;re reading &quot;Mathematicians are People Too:  Stories<br/>
from the Lives of Great Mathematicians.&quot;  A most unfortunate and boring<br/>
title, but the snippets (about 4-5 pages per historical figure) really bring<br/>
the characters to life.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the Greek philospher Pythagoras began by teaching just one<br/>
student and evolved to having a school of wealthy adult scholars. He divided<br/>
his students into two sections: the acoustici, or listeners. The acoustici<br/>
could only listen to him lecture from behind a curtain; they hadn&#39;t proven<br/>
themselves worthy of observing the lecture. Only after three years of<br/>
listening were they allowed into the privileged &quot;mathematici&quot; circle of<br/>
learners. He lectured in a white robe with gold sandals on his feet and a<br/>
golden wreath as a crown, and he worked his problems in sand on the floor.<br/>
He used colored sand to illustrate sections of geometric shapes. <br/>
<br/>
He believed that numbers held the answer to everything in the universe, that<br/>
knowledge was power, and he wanted to control it. His school became the<br/>
&quot;Secret Brotherhood&quot; aka &quot;Pythagorean School&quot; and it had initiations and<br/>
rites. They were vegetarian, believing they could be reincarnated as<br/>
animals, wouldn&#39;t touch white roosters or eat beans b/c those symbolized<br/>
perfection. Fire symbolized truth, so they wouldn&#39;t stir it with iron<br/>
pokers. They wore their symbol, a pentagram, on their clothing. And even<br/>
though women were in those days not allowed to attend public meetings, he<br/>
welcomed women into his school. <br/>
<br/>
Others around them were suspicious of them and in about 500 BC a mob set his<br/>
meetinghouse on fire during a class; Pythagorus was killed. But by this time<br/>
the Pythagorean School had spread to Sicily and Southern Italy and his<br/>
knowledge spread.   The only thing I learned in school about him was his<br/>
Pythagorean Theorum. It would have been much more interesting had they<br/>
bothered to show his quirks and show the living person behind the formulas. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the books she recommends are available from the library, and it may<br/>
be fun reading for your kids while appeasing the math concerns of your<br/>
husband - just a thought.<br/>
