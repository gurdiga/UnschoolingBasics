<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954267199">&quot;That was a mindless vent, thankfully<br/>
on the board and not at Zachary? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we&#39;re here for!!:)<br/>

Truly, you can&#39;t expect him to &quot;get it&quot; in the same time and way as<br/>
you. You kind of have to give the dh&#39;s some of the same space that you<br/>
would give a stranger. Yes, be a buffer but trust that he WILL get it<br/>
to some degree. If not, you get most of the time with the kids so<br/>
damage will be minimal.<br/>
