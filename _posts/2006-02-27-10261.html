<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071740693">&quot;My daughter was just reading over my shoulder and<br/>
asked if there are other groups like this for kids, so she could talk<br/>
to other new unschoolers about HER concerns? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a really nice forum at unschooling.info for kids. Adults pop<br/>
in here and there to share, but it&#39;s mostly unschooling kids. It&#39;s a<br/>
very nice way to &quot;meet&quot; other unschoolers and a simple forum to use.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other lists too.:)<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend getting her out to one of the unschooling<br/>
conferences this year!! I can&#39;t say enough good things about meeting<br/>
other families living this life. It will give you much needed support<br/>
and provide life long friendships for all of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745109730">Ren, Thanks for the info, I am looking into it and will let all of you know when I learn <br/>
anything.  Where can I find out about conferences?  We are in rural Vt, but would like to go.  <br/>
Any info would be great.  Melanie<br/>
