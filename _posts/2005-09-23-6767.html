<div id="ygrps-yiv-685780511">Hello everyone. I&#39;m from Oregon and have two children. I have an 8yearold dd and a 4yearold ds. They are wonderful and full of energy(hate to brag and all) love them. I&#39;m new to any kind of group or chat.I don&#39;t know much about computers. Anyway, I&#39;ve tried to join groups in my area, but most are very stict and not open to outside opinions. I&#39;ve been having trouble with my dd, I have never had her in public school, but have pushed learning on her K-1. She is having a hard time of it. This year I wanted to try something different. Unschooling sounded very interesting. How do you keep up with the state mandatory testing?<br/>
Any info would be appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The FIRST thing you do is figure out what the law says (not what the <br/>
school district tells you). For example, if testing is required (and <br/>
there&#39;s no alternate form of evaluation available), what tests are <br/>
acceptable, when does testing need to be done (is it annual)?, who <br/>
administers the test (can it be done at home)? who sees the results? <br/>
is there a required minimum score? <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oceanetwork.org/started/newlaw2.pdf">http://www.oceanetwork.org/started/newlaw2.pdf</a> shows that the <br/>
testing is in grades 3,5,8,and 10 only. The minimum score is the <br/>
15th percentile (that means that of 100 test takers, your score is <br/>
higher than 14 of them). If the test is below that level, you have <br/>
to retest the following year. If it is the same or higher, on you go <br/>
with life. If it drops, then you get more oversight for a year and <br/>
retest. If it goes up, on you go with life. If it goes down again, <br/>
then further steps may occur. But that&#39;s a worst-case scenario. AND <br/>
the test CAN NOT be the same as the public schools take because they <br/>
are not nationally normed tests. That&#39;s one end of it.<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of things, remove any weight from the tests by <br/>
playing with them. Do enough to &#39;pass&#39; (15th percentile is really <br/>
low) then make dot patterns or whatever - invalidate the results in <br/>
your own mind. Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests">http://sandradodd.com/tests</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148633509">I agree with this post - Especially about not worrying about it.  15%<br/>
is VERY low - especially when looking at national standards.  the<br/>
number of children who don&#39;t speak English as their native language in<br/>
our schools is higher than this number and they are included in the<br/>
national standards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to clarify - 15th percentile is not the same as a score of <br/>
15% correct. 15% is based on how many the individual gets correct - so <br/>
it is possible everyone could score 15 percent. 15th percentile means <br/>
that of every 100 people taking the test, 14 people scored lower and <br/>
85 people scored higher than your score. Your percentage could be 6% <br/>
correct answers but if 14 people scored 5% correct or less, you&#39;d be <br/>
in the 15th percentile. If you and 98 others taking that test at that <br/>
time for that grade level scored 15 percent, then you&#39;d be in the 99th <br/>
percentile because only 1 of the 100 people scored higher than you <br/>
did. On percentile scored tests you&#39;ll usually see two numbers, <br/>
a &quot;raw&quot; number that is the number or percent answered correctly and a <br/>
percentile score that shows where in the pile you ended up. Kind of <br/>
like at a car race - if one car goes 200+ mph and you go 120 mph and <br/>
the 98 other cars go 100 mph, you&#39;d be in second place AND in the 99th <br/>
percentile - doesn&#39;t matter whether you went 199 mph or 101 mph, <br/>
you&#39;re still in the 99th percentile.<br/>

Thanks for spelling this out Deb (and I&#39;m a math person, but was <br/>
still confused!).  Before we decided to do a narrative report <br/>
dd &quot;voluntarily&quot; (she didn&#39;t like it but she wanted to see what it <br/>
would be like IF we chose that method) took the CAT/5 standardized <br/>
test during April vacation (she was still in school, but we knew we&#39;d <br/>
be homeschooling this fall) to see what it was like.  Initially I <br/>
thought it would be &quot;easier&quot;, take one or two weeks (depending on <br/>
where you order it from) to do it and be done with it.  HA!  She <br/>
hated it, and when I got the report back, it was so confusing to <br/>
interpret.   I put it aside, but I&#39;ll go back and look at it again, <br/>
ONLY because I want to see if I can figure it out now based on your <br/>
clarification.  <br/>
Jann (just for general info, we&#39;re in MA and have three choices for <br/>
reporting - standardized testing, portfolio of dated work samples or <br/>
a narrative report)</div>
