<br/>
I was telling Sierra about someone getting the cockroaches as pets and<br/>
saying &quot;wouldn&#39;t that be cool?&quot; to which she responded &quot;No, that&#39;s<br/>
gross!&quot; and then told her brother.<br/>
Jalen said &quot;NO, you don&#39;t have them as pets, people kill them and want<br/>
them out of their houses you know!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell we just moved from Florida? ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429167268">LOL!!!  I read this to my dd and she was giving me the funniest look, <br/>
like, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t people want them in their houses?&quot;  Can you tell <br/>
we&#39;ve never really discussed the &quot;other kinds&quot; of cockroaches?  DH was <br/>
with Orkin for a while, and has all this knowledge of cockroaches, but <br/>
I guess it has never come up in conversation that MOST people don&#39;t <br/>
want roaches! :)  I&#39;m excited, he&#39;s gone to pick them up right now. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865997226">Does Florida have a problem with Madagascar hissing cockroaches? I know they<br/>
do in Texas where I got my mating pair ages ago. I haven&#39;t had them with the<br/>
kids yet but I used to own a matting pair... okay well they never actually<br/>
mated because you have to provide them with special conditions. They are<br/>
really cool and actually have quite a bit of personality. I kept mine in a<br/>
tiny aquarium - not the best place for them and one night someone left the<br/>
window open in the middle of the winter and they died or at least that was<br/>
the best I could figure because they died.<br/>
