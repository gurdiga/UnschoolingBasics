<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554939366">We are!  This is our second year.  I wanted to go to the RE conference too, but the way things are working out, we will not be going this year.  We will be in Dallas at the beginning of August and with four little children, I am not sure I am up for the 16 hour trip AGAIN just one month later.  Plus, my husband would have to fly to meet us then and that means I would be traveling by myself with four kids, lots of hotels and that just doesn&#39;t sound relaxing to me.  Next year, I am going to try and budget for both.  We loved the UWG last year, especially since it is close to home!<br/>
