feeling this. <br/>
: )  Well, I&#39;ve only noticed once or twice where just a couple of people may <br/>
have &#39;slipped&#39;(one of them even aplogized and made a joke? that she forgot <br/>
which list she was posting on, I think : ).  I can tell a HUGE difference in this <br/>
list and &#39;the discussion one&#39;.  I think people who were over there and got <br/>
into that very blunt, cut & dry, cold way of addressing people are trying very <br/>
hard to not do that here...you can tell they are trying to be more respectful, <br/>
more compassionate...which to me is a much better fit w/the whole unschooling <br/>
philosophy.  I think newbies feel MUCH safer talking here!<br/>
