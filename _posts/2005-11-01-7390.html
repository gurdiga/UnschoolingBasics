<div id="ygrps-yiv-715122632">Su, in case you didn&#39;t know, homeschooling author David Albert is a  Quaker.  <br/>
He may have some information on how you could approach this.   I bet you <br/>
could email him with your questions.  He isn&#39;t a radical  unschooler, but maybe <br/>
bringing his books to your church&#39;s attention might be  helpful.<br/>
