How funny...i think out loud all the time too and it drives my dh crazy here - he keeps asking me to get to the point...there is no point...just processing.  I think that&#39;s could be one requirement for unschooling...the ability to just process without needing to make a point &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed my 6yo dd doing the same thing...and both kids play out loud when they are by themselves.  It&#39;s freaked some people out but i adore seeing their uninhibited imagination at work.<br/>
<br/>
Aint life grand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715955713">There have been times when I hear DS chatting away happily in the <br/>
back yard (in the summer at least) and I look out and he&#39;s there by <br/>
himself, merrily playing at whatever. I know that there&#39;s no one <br/>
actually out there because the dogs (a golden retriever/lab mix and <br/>
a pure blood German Shepherd) would bark at minimum if it was <br/>
someone they knew and growl pretty firmly at someone they didn&#39;t (if <br/>
that person even decided to come far enough onto the property to get <br/>
into the back yard after seeing them!)<br/>
<br/>
I think that is a personality thing - some people need to actually <br/>
say things aloud to think them out whereas others don&#39;t say anything <br/>
until they&#39;ve finished and just pop out their response.</div>
