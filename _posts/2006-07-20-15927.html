<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995381277">At one of the local lists here in TN, a parent posted about some<br/>
homeschoolers that were having a bad day and the Dad took one of the<br/>
children out to do schoolwork at a local cafe. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a segment:<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Here&#39;s what&#39;s remarkable to me. In that short time, Chrissie went<br/>
through an ENORMOUS amount of work, effortlessly. After we were done<br/>
with all the school work, we still had lots and lots of time to munch<br/>
on the rest of the nachos and just talk.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m thinking &quot;why the hell bring the schoolwork??&quot;<br/>
WHY on earth is schoolwork so important that a parent will taint an<br/>
otherwise enjoyable outing with it? Yucky.<br/>
<br/>
I bet she learned more from talking to Dad and eating Nachos than any<br/>
of the schoolwork. sigh...........<br/>
