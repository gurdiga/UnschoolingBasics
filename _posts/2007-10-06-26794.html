<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858222411">Well, I posted before about 9yo suspected to have celiac disease. He<br/>
has the gene, but no evidence from blood tests or endoscope and biopsy.<br/>
Doctor is going to do a sweat test for cystic fibrosis. He said there<br/>
are types with no lung involvement. If any of you have information, or<br/>
experience with CF I could use the support. His sweat test is on the<br/>
18 Oct, so it is hard to wait not knowing anything.<br/>
<br/>
And feel free to email off group as I know this is not really<br/>
unschooling stuff.<br/>
