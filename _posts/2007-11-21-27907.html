<div id="ygrps-yiv-701971447">I am too! I know that when I was 13, my stepmom took me to a mary kay  <br/>
lady for a private birthday party. It was wonderful because not only  <br/>
did she suggest colors for me, but also different ways of applying  <br/>
makeup AND covered basic skin care (which is important if you start  <br/>
slathering on all those chemicals).  Alternatively you could go to  <br/>
the mall and ask for assistance at ANY  makeup counter. Most of the  <br/>
people I&#39;ve met there have been really  kind and helpful (and a boost  <br/>
to my ego, which we can all use) They love makeup, for the most part,  <br/>
and helping other women do makeup is great!<br/>
<br/>
You do NOT have to buy all of the makeup that they offer, but do buy  <br/>
something or offer a tip, and to be honest, the foundation that you  <br/>
buy there is worth the extra money. I always buy a tinted moisturizer  <br/>
(which is lighter feeling) and my mascara from there. I don&#39;t wear  <br/>
makeup often, but those two are ones that I don&#39;t react too. Cover  <br/>
girl also has a tinted moisturizer, and another good thing about them  <br/>
is that it&#39;s hard to get pancake effect with it ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406657969">How much do you want to spend? My older daughter is a make-up queen. I could ask her. I don&#39;t wear it myself and never have, but she has worn it since she was five years old. She had fake little girl makeup at first and then a neighbor gave her some out of her own collection, half used mascara, etc. <br/>
She would know what inexpensive brands you can buy at the local drugstore are the best. Of course, you may want to find some extra money and buy the better stuff because apparently there are huge differences in the content of it and the more natural stuff costs more, but is better for the skin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016993773">thanks everyone for all the great suggestions! I just wasn&#39;t figuring<br/>
it out but I really want to please her, she is a hard one. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
really want anything for the holiday or her birthday (in Dec) so I am<br/>
trying really hard to think of creative gifts that she will actually<br/>
enjoy.<br/>
What I think I&#39;ll do from all these suggestions is...take her to the<br/>
store and buy some stuff that interests her (mama/daughter) and then<br/>
do some sort of make over kind of thing. Also, I might try to take her<br/>
and her cousin to the mall for the make overs at the cosmetic counter<br/>
and let her pick one &quot;big&quot; item that we can afford. I really like to<br/>
make her birthday special since she gets forgotten a lot with a 31 Dec<br/>
birthday! I think this will please her and be a fun connection for us.<br/>
She loves it when I do things out of my element and of her choosing. I<br/>
am so excited now I can&#39;t wait!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;d take her to a drugstore and let her pick some stuff out. Brands like<br/>
&gt;  Cover Girl and Wet & Wild aren&#39;t expensive especially if they are on sale.<br/>
&gt;  The packages usually have diagrams on them that show you where to put the<br/>
&gt;  colors. Like if you buy a multi pack of eyeshadow the back of the package<br/>
&gt;  will have an outline of an eye and a diagram of where to put the lighter<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  darker colors. But .. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll figure it out once she gets her hands<br/>
&gt;  on some makeup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  There are also a lot of books about putting on makeup. I have Making Faces<br/>
&gt;  by Kevin Aucoin and he shows how to create a bunch of different looks, some<br/>
&gt;  are extreme but still good for ideas and tips. I bet you could find it at<br/>
&gt;  the library.<br/>

As a professional makeup artist, I highly recommend the MAC counter or<br/>
store in your area. I do NOT recommend Mary Kay (sorry faithful fans)<br/>
because it is a direct marketing company and they host parties where<br/>
there is a lot of pressure to buy. It&#39;s free to browse around counters<br/>
and the MAC folks are actual artist, trained to educate and apply<br/>
makeup for a variety of situations. If you can just get her matched in<br/>
a foundation (Studio Fix powder foundation would be a really great<br/>
start at $25) then you could get some cheap stuff to let her play with.<br/>
<br/>
Cheap foundation is obvious. It usually won&#39;t match anyway. Target has<br/>
a brand called E.L.F. that is $1 per item. They have some fun lipgloss<br/>
and blush and shadows she could play with. Libby Lu is another fun<br/>
place to take her at that age. <br/>
<br/>
If you took her to MAC and just asked for a foundation match, there is<br/>
no charge for that. The MAC eyeshadows and other colors are FAR<br/>
superior to other lines because they were developed for makeup artists<br/>
to be used in the fashion industry. <br/>
<br/>
Visiting a Sephora store would be another fun place for her. Start<br/>
with Libby Lu though. They&#39;ll do her makeup and hair for around $22<br/>
and she could make &quot;potions&quot; to take home for bath and body. Their<br/>
makeup is really cheap and fun for a beginner.<br/>
<br/>
If you have questions about brushes and placement, write me offlist. I<br/>
could go on for hours....:) I&#39;d be happy to post a few pics of my work<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788720721">jeez, it&#39;s like you speak a different language, lol. I googled a bunch<br/>
of things and found a libby lu&#39;s about 1 1/2 away  so that&#39;s doable. I<br/>
am not sure if it isn&#39;t a little girly for my kid. yeah I understand<br/>
that is a weird thing to say since she is asking for makeup  but she<br/>
is a into &quot;punk&quot; stuff and sports. She is very androgynous. I think<br/>
even walking into a MaCY&#39;s is out of my league.<br/>
Is foundation necessary? Ok here&#39;s a (maybe) better question what<br/>
would a basic make up kit consist of? She has &quot;play&quot; make up but is<br/>
ready for the real deal. I wanted to get her set up and then she/we<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486529251">First, let me say that I find it extremely funny that after months of<br/>
reading, absorbing and learning from all you wise and insightful<br/>
parents, I choose this topic to motivate me enough to write in.  I do<br/>
wear make-up, although not much.  When I was about 12 and wanted to use<br/>
real make-up my mom, who wears make-up and in hind-sight was very<br/>
unschoolish, guided me through it.  We started with the basics of blush,<br/>
mascara, and lip gloss.  After a while I started incorporating other<br/>
stuff like eyeliner (it was the 80&#39;s) and moved on from there.  It was<br/>
easy enough for me to start with as it&#39;s simple to apply.  I&#39;m sure your<br/>
daughter has some idea of what she wants to apply, and given how much<br/>
practice she&#39;s had with the pretend stuff, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll get the hang<br/>
of it very quickly.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons of info on the web to help.<br/>
Taking her to the drug store or a Wal-Mart type store seems like a<br/>
pretty good place to start.  Good luck and have fun!  <br/>

while is better for most young artists. THey forget and rub their<br/>
eyes, it makes some eyes itch etc...<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, younger makeup wearers really want to play with<br/>
color. Eyeshadows and lipstick/gloss are usually favorite starting points.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036747193">To reply I have turned to the &quot;expert&quot; in this household, my<br/>
11-year-old daughter who learned about makeup application in theatre<br/>
camp.  Last summer, we went to Target to put together a moderately<br/>
priced makeup kit.  Her friends also picked up makeup at Wal-Mart and<br/>
the Dollar store.  She has a lot to say on this subject, so much in<br/>
fact, that she ended up putting it on her blog at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.elferkid.blogspot.com">http://www.elferkid.blogspot.com</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.elferkid.blogspot.com">http://www.elferkid.blogspot.com</a>&gt; . <br/>
Basically, she usually only wears lipgloss and sometimes clear mascara. <br/>
However, she loves getting together with friends to &quot;dress up,&quot; apply<br/>
makeup, and put on skits.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, a cosmetic case with a gift certificate and a lip gloss<br/>
would be an excellent holiday or birthday gift for a tween.<br/>
