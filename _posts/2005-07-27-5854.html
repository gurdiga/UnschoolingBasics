  **She would have other kitchen duties if not that. Many meals I<br/>
prepare on my own, but she does help me quite often. We live in<br/>
the same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>
<br/>
 I think the dissonance you may be feeling between<br/>
what you&#39;re writing and the responses you&#39;re getting might have<br/>
to do more with word choice than with differing ideas.<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d like to reiterate what Sandra said. There are (basically)<br/>
two types of unschooling lists. One is for support where people<br/>
share what they do and so they can get to know each other. The<br/>
other is for discussion. People share problems they&#39;re having so<br/>
they can discuss it :-) So if there&#39;s anything you do that you don&#39;t<br/>
want people to pull out and say &quot;What do you mean by that?<br/>
Have you really examined what you&#39;re doing?&quot; it&#39;s best not to<br/>
post it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that the list doesn&#39;t accept people for who they are. It&#39;s<br/>
that this list is specifically for discussing ideas. It&#39;s *for* holding<br/>
practices and thoughts and ideas up to examination.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a place to kick back and let it all hang out, this is a<br/>
place where people come to have their ideas challenged, to look<br/>
at life in ways they&#39;d never considered before.<br/>
<br/>
Basically on this list the filter through which ideas pass is<br/>
treating children as fellow human beings. If someone presents<br/>
an idea where it sounds like the child is being treated in a way<br/>
that an adult would be upset to be treated, the idea will raise red<br/>
flags for many people. And the idea will be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
**She would have other kitchen duties if not that.**<br/>
<br/>
This might be a word use problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Have&quot; suggests that your daughter has been assigned kitchen<br/>
duties by someone else. &quot;Have&quot; suggests that if she doesn&#39;t do<br/>
them then there will be punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Now that *idea* will raise red flags and people will want to<br/>
discuss the *idea* of making children -- not your child, not what<br/>
you do in your home -- but the idea of making children do chores.<br/>
<br/>
Step back for a moment and treat this as though it weren&#39;t about<br/>
what you&#39;re doing, but about broader ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Does it help build a good relationship between two humans for<br/>
one human to have the power over another to tell them what to<br/>
do and to punish them if they don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
(Step back. This isn&#39;t about you. It&#39;s about how *people* feel.)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents would say no, it doesn&#39;t help build a good<br/>
relationshp. They&#39;d probably be thinking about their spouse,<br/>
saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want my husband to tell me what to do and<br/>
punish me if I don&#39;t!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And yet, without realizing it, they&#39;d be doing exactly that to their<br/>
kids! They&#39;d make their kids do something and punish them (or<br/>
make them feel bad or get mad at them or ask them over and<br/>
over and over ...) And they&#39;d say &quot;Yes, I&#39;m making her, but ___.&quot;<br/>
And they&#39;d fill in the blank with &quot;they&#39;re kids&quot;, &quot;they don&#39;t know as<br/>
much,&quot; &quot;someone has to be in charge,&quot; and so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
But what it all boils down to, regardless of the justification, we<br/>
are tearing down a relationship when we assert our authority<br/>
over someone weaker. When we take away someone&#39;s power to<br/>
say no, we are tearing down a good relationship and creating a<br/>
relationship of adversaries: Parent vs child. And when there are<br/>
adversaries, there is a struggle for power. And when there is a<br/>
struggle for power there are winners and losers.<br/>
<br/>
But none of those words: struggle, power, winner, loser have<br/>
anything to do with building a loving relationship, do they?<br/>
They&#39;re all really yucky words to put into a relationship.<br/>
<br/>
And there are better ways to be with kids than as adversaries.<br/>
There are ways to live life together, get all the things done that<br/>
we feel we&#39;d like to get done *and* build a loving relationship<br/>
with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
So we talk about it here. A lot :-)<br/>
<br/>
**We live in the same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>
<br/>
This is the point that most parents would love to be at :-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that being a team doesn&#39;t just happen by existing<br/>
together. Children aren&#39;t born realizing they&#39;re part of a team so<br/>
they need to pitch in. In fact children are born believing everything<br/>
is about them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting would say that kids need to be taught that<br/>
life isn&#39;t about them. Traditional parenting would say kids need<br/>
to learn to do what parents say so kids can learn that life isn&#39;t all<br/>
about them.<br/>
<br/>
But what that teaches kids is that life is all about being an adult<br/>
so you can be bigger and get your way by telling others what to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
(Turn that idea upside down. What if an adult thinks another<br/>
adult needs to learn the lesson that others should be taken into<br/>
consideration too so starts ordering the other adult around,<br/>
making the second adult do what the first adult wants. It just<br/>
feels *wrong*. But most parents, even if they see the wrongness<br/>
of it, think that&#39;s life and kids just have to learn.)<br/>
<br/>
On this list we help people find better ways! :-) We help them see<br/>
that we can support kids in their belief that it&#39;s all about them.<br/>
While *at the same time* helping them see  it&#39;s all about mom<br/>
and big sister and dad too.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that most parents don&#39;t know how to get to a<br/>
feeling of &quot;we&#39;re a team.&quot; Or they think they know but the ways<br/>
they&#39;ll go about it -- for instance making their kids do chores<br/>
because they&#39;re a part of a team -- only work for kids who are<br/>
very compliant or desperately needing to please. Those ways<br/>
tend to have the opposite effect on kids with other personalities.<br/>
And when parents don&#39;t get the results they expect,  when the<br/>
kids act resentful of being made to do chores, act as though their<br/>
parents care more about the things they&#39;re making the kids do<br/>
than they do about the kids, the parents wonder what&#39;s wrong<br/>
with their kids. They wonder why Roberta&#39;s daughter is chopping<br/>
vegetables happily for her mom while their own kids roll their<br/>
eyes and groan and do half-assed jobs.<br/>
<br/>
On this list we help people examine what goes into building<br/>
relationship so that we become people our kids want to help :-)<br/>
It&#39;s not just luck if kids help. There are ways we can relate to kids<br/>
that will foster a great relationship.<br/>
<br/>
**Through cooking I teach her her heritage - both sides.**<br/>
<br/>
Teach is another word land mine.<br/>
<br/>
Teach, for many people who are trying to understand<br/>
unschooling, is a loaded word. It brings up pictures of a teacher<br/>
pushing information into a child.<br/>
<br/>
We try to help people drop that image. And to help them drop that<br/>
image we try to help them see how learning is different from<br/>
teaching.<br/>
<br/>
(There are ways that teaching is like learning *but* it&#39;s examining<br/>
how learning is *different* from teaching that helps people get<br/>
unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is about pushing information in. Learning is about<br/>
someone pulling something they want in.<br/>
<br/>
Once people can turn their thinking around from trying to get<br/>
what they want a child to learn into the child to thinking in terms<br/>
of what the child wants to pull in for himself, they&#39;re a lot closer to<br/>
understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
**Surely there are some things we can learn about how to do<br/>
chores, but basically they are just something that need to be<br/>
done and if not we don&#39;t eat, have clean clothes, or a clean<br/>
home.**<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Need to&quot; is another word land mine. As you point out while there<br/>
are things that we &quot;need to do&quot; it&#39;s helpful -- freeing! -- to turn <br/>
that<br/>
picture up side down so we can see it in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
IF we see everything we do as a choice, then it frees us from<br/>
some outside mysterious power that&#39;s supposedly making us<br/>
do such and such.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people get trapped thinking they &quot;have to&quot; make dinner.<br/>
The truth is that they don&#39;t. They *choose* to make dinner for<br/>
reasons that they don&#39;t think are even worth considering. But they<br/>
*are* worth considering because if they aren&#39;t considered then it<br/>
feels like we don&#39;t have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to make dinner. We could order pizza. We could<br/>
eat frozen dinners. We could hire a chef. We could make a<br/>
month of meals on one day and put them in the freezer. (The list<br/>
could go on.)<br/>
<br/>
But someone might *choose* to make dinner because ... It&#39;s<br/>
cheaper. It&#39;s healthier. It&#39;s a way they enjoy showing someone<br/>
they care for them. (The list could go on.)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped drive this idea home for me is that I always<br/>
felt I had to clean the toilet every x number of days. I didn&#39;t listen<br/>
to the voice ;-) but that voice was there nagging me whenever I<br/>
looked at the toilet. And that guilt making voice made me<br/>
resentful and rebellious so that I didn&#39;t clean the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
But then I stopped and said, no, I don&#39;t *have to* clean the toilet.<br/>
But sometimes it&#39;s really nice for the toilet to be clean. And from<br/>
then it became a choice. I no longer *had to* clean the toilet any<br/>
more! But sometimes I *chose to* clean the toilet because I<br/>
wanted it clean :-) And ever since then, because I know I can say<br/>
no anytime I want to, I do clean my toilet more often than when I<br/>
&quot;had to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
No one *has to* think that way but it&#39;s a really helpful way if<br/>
someone finds themselves stuck with the idea of &quot;have to&quot; and<br/>
they&#39;d like to change.<br/>
<br/>
It really  really really helps on a discussion list to step back from<br/>
something you do when it&#39;s being discussed and look at it as an<br/>
abstract idea. Look at it from a distance as though it&#39;s<br/>
generalized and not about you any more. Turn it this way and<br/>
that. Turn kids into adults. Turn adults into kids. Turn ideas<br/>
upside down and inside out. Expand it. If it&#39;s a good idea then it<br/>
can cover more than one thing. For example many people come<br/>
to unschooling thinking it&#39;s just about academic learning, that<br/>
kids can learn best by learning what interests them. And then<br/>
they start thinking, hmm, if that&#39;s true, then why is it true only of<br/>
academics? Why, if I&#39;ll let my child choose when and how to<br/>
learn math concepts, am I making her sit at the table and learn<br/>
table manners? And they&#39;ll expand it more and start questioning<br/>
all sorts of things they never thought to question.<br/>
<br/>
Basically this list is for people who want the ideas of how to build<br/>
a relationship with their kids, who don&#39;t want to do things that will<br/>
tear the relationship down.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing things differently, that&#39;s okay. :-) It&#39;s just that <br/>
this<br/>
isn&#39;t the list to *talk* about how we all do things differently. It&#39;s a<br/>
place to discuss how we can respect our kids and still manage<br/>
to get all the things done we want to and discuss that in ways<br/>
that will help others figure out how to make it work for them too.<br/>
