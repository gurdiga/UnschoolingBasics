Speaking of unschooling....<br/>
<br/>
MSNBC has been running a series of articles on Unschooling along with a<br/>
poll. So far people are voting that unschooling is nothing more than<br/>
&quot;goofing off&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you are an unschooler or know unschoolers and agree that it works, please<br/>
take a moment and vote:<br/>
<br/>
The poll is located here:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually if you look at the poll results there isn&#39;t an overwhelming<br/>
&quot;F&quot; grade on unschooling.  While the &quot;A&quot; grade is certainly not in the<br/>
lead, the rest of the letter grades for unschooling are fairly evenly<br/>
divided.<br/>
<br/>
A -- Kids should be free to learn where they want and how they want.<br/>
13%<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably coming from all us radical unschooling crazies :-)<br/>
<br/>
 B -- This sounds like a pretty good idea, as long as the parents are<br/>
committed to it.<br/>
21%<br/>
<br/>
There are only 5% points seperating B from F.  And in all seriousness<br/>
B should be the answer we are all voting for.  A almost alludes to<br/>
unparenting (which we have talked at great lengths about since it is<br/>
often confused with unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
 C -- I suppose this works for some kids, but I&#39;m skeptical that most<br/>
are learning much this way.<br/>
18%<br/>
<br/>
OK, very little middle ground.  These are probably all the undecided.<br/>
I bet most of these people like the idea of unschooling, and wish that<br/>
they had been unschooled, but have a fear of shaking up the status<br/>
quo.<br/>
<br/>
 D -- I just don&#39;t see how youngsters are learning all they need to know.<br/>
23%<br/>
<br/>
This is really based on misinformation.  The idea of unschooling is so<br/>
far out there that they can&#39;t comprehend how it can possibly work.<br/>
<br/>
 F -- Learning? Sounds more like goofing around to me.<br/>
26%<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like they don&#39;t know anything about unschooling :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is &quot;coming out week&quot; in the glbt community (used to be just one<br/>
day somehow it evolved into a whole week, I&#39;m betting in the next year<br/>
or two Hallmark will be in on the act LOL!)  Anyway, one of the things<br/>
that is stated over and over in the coming out activities is that when<br/>
you come out and let people know your sexuality that it breaks down<br/>
barriers and makes people view homosexuality differently.  It makes it<br/>
personal to them.  It&#39;s hard to bad mouth something that a loved<br/>
relative or friend is.  I think the same is true about unschooling.<br/>
How can someone see our kids and know tha twe unschool and think that<br/>
it is all wrong and bad and a disservice to our children.  Maybe we<br/>
should declare a &quot;coming out week&quot; for unschooling.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
And actually, considering that unschoolers represent---what?---like <br/>
.0002 % of the population, 13% is HUGE!!! LOTS of &quot;radical unschooling <br/>
crazies&quot; out voting (I didn&#39;t.).<br/>
<br/>
Twenty-one percent think it&#39;s a pretty good idea????<br/>
<br/>
Only 26% think we&#39;re nuts?  AMAZING!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393204638">You know, I didn&#39;t even vote, I really dislike polls like that,  <br/>
because I couldn&#39;t decide between A or B. And I totally agree with F,  <br/>
because in our family it IS goofing off, and I want it to be that way  <br/>
when my kids are learning. What does it have to be this puritan ideal  <br/>
of sitting at a table for eight hours?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711056725">I read this response on another site but I thought her perspective was so well written that I <br/>
thought I would pass it on to this group as well :)<br/>

Hi group!<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching this discussion ping pong back<br/>
and forth and I just want to say that both points are<br/>
valid.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, surveys are crap. What do I care<br/>
about other people&#39;s misconceptions and so called<br/>
expert opinions?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, publicity and politics are<br/>
important matters; much of the homeschooling movement<br/>
has indeed been a political struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Just google the history of that homeschool legal<br/>
defense organization....<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember that the choices we make<br/>
in carving alternative educational niches for our<br/>
children is a political act and we are, whether we<br/>
like it or not, part of a movement that IS political<br/>
in nature.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool in protest of mainstream cultural values<br/>
that are amplified and exacerbated in a school<br/>
setting. I don&#39;t know that the call to homeschool<br/>
would be so strong if schools, in their current<br/>
incarnation, weren&#39;t so opposite of my philosophy,<br/>
including my political philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If public schools functioned as they ought to in a<br/>
true democracy-which is to ensure a well-educated<br/>
public that is capable and empowered enough to shape<br/>
government in the ways most beneficial to the greatest<br/>
number of people-then maybe we wouldn&#39;t be a nation<br/>
plagued as we are with rampant corruption and<br/>
corporate influenceon public policy. The fact that<br/>
schools produce more &quot;schooled&quot; people than &quot;educated&quot;<br/>
ones is a threat to the health of our country.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool to provide my daughter with an education<br/>
that I don&#39;t believe she would receive in a<br/>
traditional setting-that I could afford, anyway. For<br/>
me, homeschooling is a patriotic act.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth considering the fact that what we do<br/>
safegaurds an important right-one to educate as one<br/>
sees fit-and to live by example for the sake of not<br/>
only our families, but other families as well. Many<br/>
people do not have this option on their radar-they<br/>
accept the inevitablity that school is the only choice<br/>
for their children whether or not the local public<br/>
school is good and whether or not they have the cash<br/>
to shell out to a more benign institution.<br/>
<br/>
Many more might feel empowered enough to follow our<br/>
example if they knew more about what homeschooling is<br/>
all about. One sided perspectives in the media don&#39;t<br/>
help this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I think, therefore, that public opinion is important,<br/>
even in the sensationalist guise of a silly on-line<br/>
survey and that perhaps our voice is one that should<br/>
be heard in the context of a vigorous national debate<br/>
on education and educational reform.<br/>
