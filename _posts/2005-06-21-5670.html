Welcome to the town of Allopath<br/>
<br/>
There once was a town called Allopath. It had many people, streets and cars,<br/>
but due to budget limitations, there were no stop signs or traffic lights<br/>
anywhere in Allopath. <br/>
<br/>
Not surprisingly, traffic accidents were common. Cars would crash into each<br/>
other at nearly every intersection. But business was booming for the auto<br/>
repair shops and local hospitals, which dominated the<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.newstarget.com/002268.html">http://www.newstarget.com/002268.html</a>&gt; economy of Allopath. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the population of Allopath grew, traffic accidents increased to an<br/>
alarming level. Out of desperation, the city council hired Doctor West, a<br/>
doctor of the Motor Division (M.D.) to find a solution. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dr. West spent days examining traffic accidents. He carried an assortment of<br/>
technical gear -- microscopes, chemical analysis equipment, lab gear -- and<br/>
put them all to work as part of his investigation. The townspeople of<br/>
Allopath watched on with great curiosity while Dr. West went about his work,<br/>
meticulously documenting and analyzing each traffic accident, and they<br/>
awaited his final report with great interest. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After weeks of investigation, Dr. West called the people of Allopath to a<br/>
town meeting for the release of his report. There, in front of the city<br/>
council and most of the residents of Allopath, he announced his findings:<br/>
&quot;Traffic accidents are caused by skid marks.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As Dr. West explained, he found and documented a near-100% correlation<br/>
between traffic accidents and skid marks. &quot;Wherever we find these cars<br/>
colliding,&quot; he explained, &quot;we also find these skid marks.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The town had &quot;Skid Marks Disease,&quot; the doctor explained, and the answer to<br/>
the town&#39;s epidemic of traffic accidents would, &quot;...require nothing more<br/>
than treating Skid Marks Disease by making the streets skid-proof,&quot; Dr. West<br/>
exclaimed, to great applause from the townspeople. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The city paid Dr. West his consulting fee, then asked the good doctor to<br/>
propose a method for treating this Skid Marks Disease. As chance would have<br/>
it, Dr. West had recently been on a trip to Hawaii paid for by a chemical<br/>
company that manufactured roadaceuticals: special chemicals used to treat<br/>
roads for situations just like this one. He recommended a particular<br/>
chemical coating to the city council: teflon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We can treat this Skid Marks Disease by coating the roads with teflon,&quot; Dr.<br/>
West explained. &quot;The streets will then be skid-proof, and all the traffic<br/>
accidents will cease!&quot; He went on to describe the physical properties of<br/>
teflon and how its near-frictionless coating would deter nearly all vehicle<br/>
skids. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The city council heartily agreed with Dr. West, and they issued new public<br/>
bonds to raise the money required to buy enough teflon to coat all the<br/>
city&#39;s streets. Within weeks, the streets were completely coated, and the<br/>
skid marks all but disappeared. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The city council paid Dr. West another consulting fee and thanked him for<br/>
his expertise. The problem of traffic accidents in Allopath was solved, they<br/>
thought. Although the cure was expensive, they were convinced it was worth<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But things weren&#39;t well in Allopath. Traffic accidents quadrupled. Hospital<br/>
beds were overflowing with injured residents. Auto repair businesses were<br/>
booming so much that most of the city council members decided to either open<br/>
their own car repair shops or invest in existing ones. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Week after week, more and more residents of Allopath were injured, and their<br/>
cars were repeatedly damaged. Money piled into the pockets of the car repair<br/>
shops, hospitals, tow truck companies and car parts retailers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The town economic advisor, observing this sharp increase in economic<br/>
activity, announced that Allopath was booming. Its economy was healthier<br/>
than ever, and Allopath could look forward to a great year of economic<br/>
prosperity! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were jobs to be had at the car repair shops. There were more nurses<br/>
needed at the hospital. &quot;Help wanted&quot; signs appeared all over town at the<br/>
paramedic station, the tow truck shops, and the auto glass businesses.<br/>
Unemployment dropped to near zero. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the traffic accidents continued to increase. And yet there were no skid<br/>
marks. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The city council was baffled. They thought they had solved this problem.<br/>
Skid Marks Disease had been eradicated by the teflon treatment. Why were<br/>
traffic accidents still happening? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They called a town meeting to discuss the problem, and following a short<br/>
discussion of the problem, an old hermit, who lived in the forest just<br/>
outside of Allopath, addressed the townspeople. &quot;There is no such thing as<br/>
Skid Marks Disease,&quot; he explained. &quot;This disease was invented by the<br/>
roadaceuticals company to sell you teflon coatings.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The townspeople were horrified to hear such a statement. They knew Skid<br/>
Marks Disease existed. The doctor had told them so. How could this hermit,<br/>
who had no Motor Division (M.D.) degree, dare tell them otherwise? How could<br/>
he question their collective town wisdom in such a way? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a simple problem,&quot; the hermit continued. &quot;All we need to do is<br/>
build stop signs and traffic lights. Then the traffic accidents will cease.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Without pause, one city council member remarked, &quot;But how can we afford stop<br/>
signs? We&#39;ve spent all our money on teflon treatments!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The townspeople agreed. They had no money to buy stop signs. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another council member added, &quot;And how can we stop anyway? The streets are<br/>
all coated with teflon. If we build stop signs, we&#39;ll waste all the money<br/>
we&#39;ve spent on teflon!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The townspeople agreed, again. What use were stop signs if they couldn&#39;t<br/>
stop their cars anyway? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hermit replied, &quot;But the stop signs will eliminate the need for teflon.<br/>
People will be able to stop their cars, and accidents will cease. The<br/>
solution is simple.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what might happen if stop signs actually worked, the townspeople<br/>
wondered. How would it affect the booming economy of Allopath? Realizing the<br/>
consequences, a burly old man who owned a local repair shop jumped to his<br/>
feet and said, &quot;If we build these stop signs, and traffic accidents go down,<br/>
I&#39;ll have to fire most of my workers!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was at that moment that most of the townspeople realized there own jobs<br/>
were at stake. If stop signs were built, nearly everyone would be<br/>
unemployed. They all had jobs in emergency response services, car repair<br/>
shops, hospitals and teflon coating maintenance. Some were now sales<br/>
representatives of the roadaceuticals company. Others were importers of<br/>
glass, tires, steel and other parts for cars. A few clever people were<br/>
making a fortune selling wheelchairs and crutches to accident victims. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One enterprising young gentleman started a scientific journal that published<br/>
research papers describing all the different kind of Skid Marks Diseases<br/>
that had been observed and documented. Another person, a<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.newstarget.com/006746.html">http://www.newstarget.com/006746.html</a>&gt; fitness enthusiast, organized an<br/>
annual run to raise funds to find the cure for Skid Marks Disease. It was a<br/>
popular event, and all the townspeople participated as best they could:<br/>
jogging, walking, or just pushing themselves along in their wheelchairs. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One way or another, nearly everyone in Allopath was economically tied to<br/>
Skid Marks Disease. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Out of fear of losing this economic prosperity, the townspeople voted to<br/>
create a new public safety agency: the Frequent Drivers Association (FDA).<br/>
This FDA would be responsible for approving or rejecting all signage,<br/>
technology and chemical coatings related to the town&#39;s roads. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The FDA&#39;s board members were chosen from among the business leaders of the<br/>
community: the owner of the car shop, the owner of the ambulance company,<br/>
and of course, Dr. West. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Soon after its inception, the FDA announced that Skid Marks Disease was,<br/>
indeed, very real, as it had been carefully documented by a doctor and<br/>
recently published in the town Skid Marks Disease journal. Since there were<br/>
no studies whatsoever showing stop signs to be effective for reducing<br/>
traffic accidents, the FDA announced that stop signs were to be outlawed,<br/>
and that any person attempting to sell stop signs would be charged with<br/>
fraud and locked up in the town jail. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This pleased the townspeople of Allopath. With the FDA, they knew their jobs<br/>
were safe. They could go on living their lives of economic prosperity, with<br/>
secure jobs, knowing that the FDA would outlaw any attempt to take away<br/>
their livelihood. They still had a lot of traffic accidents, but at least<br/>
their jobs were secure. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so life continued in Allopath. For a short while, at least. As traffic<br/>
accidents continued at a devastating rate, more and more residents of<br/>
Allopath were injured or killed. Many were left bed-ridden, unable to work,<br/>
due to their injuries. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In time, the population dwindled. The once-booming town of Allopath<br/>
eventually became little more than a ghost town. The hospital closed its<br/>
doors, the FDA was disbanded, and the Skid Marks Disease journal stopped<br/>
printing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The few residents remaining eventually realized nothing good had come of<br/>
Skid Marks Disease, the teflon coatings and the FDA. No one was any better<br/>
off, as all the town&#39;s money had been spent on the disease: the teflon<br/>
coatings, car parts and emergency services. No one was any healthier, or<br/>
happier, or longer-lived. Most, in fact, had lost their entire families to<br/>
Skid Marks Disease. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the hermit? He continued to live just outside of town, at the end of a<br/>
winding country road, where he lived a simple life with no cars, no roads,<br/>
no teflon coatings and no FDA. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He outlived every single resident of Allopath. He gardened, took long walks<br/>
through the forest, and gathered roots, leaves and berries to feed himself.<br/>
In his spare time, he constructed stop signs, waiting for the next<br/>
population to come along, and hoping they might listen to an old hermit with<br/>
a crazy idea: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...that prevention is the answer, not the treatment of symptoms. <br/>
