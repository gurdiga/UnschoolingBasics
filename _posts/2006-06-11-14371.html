Has anyone gotten so into their surname that they traced their heritage back<br/>
a ways?  Have any of you decided to learn your ancestors native tongue?<br/>

Oh, that&#39;s funny, I thought that you were the one in Arkansas moving to FL!<br/>
I&#39;m out in Los Angeles - used to live in Ohio and then NY City for several<br/>
years. Looks like 3 Lesas with Es so far... How strange... are you all<br/>
Irish, too?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077872105">My dad did....relatively easy since he&#39;s only third generation, he  <br/>
went back to about 1750. But Swedish is harder than it looks...my  <br/>
friend has a CD learning set she&#39;s going to give me after *she*  <br/>
learns it (her son emigrated there, married a nice swede, and just  <br/>
had baby number 2, she figures she&#39;d better learn the language fast  <br/>
so she can talk to the grandkids!)<br/>
There is also French and Welsh, but I like to say I&#39;m honorary Irish  <br/>
since I&#39;m born on St Patricks day, and I love pretty much all things  <br/>
Irish.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On my dad&#39;s side is very easy because he comes from a very long line<br/>
of Icelanders.  His parents came here with his grandparents when they<br/>
were newly married.  My dad went back to Iceland to visit about 20<br/>
years ago and &quot;met the cousins.&quot;  Everyone knew his lineage as soon as<br/>
he would say that his grandfather was Sigurd Geisleifurson.  Oh, well,<br/>
Sigurd was married to Alfhid and her father was .......&quot; and it would<br/>
go on all night.  My dad&#39;s family is Icelandic back to when Eric and<br/>
Leifur were exploring it!  People there know their lineage.<br/>
<br/>
On my mother&#39;s side, I know about the American part of her father&#39;s<br/>
side because one of the cousins wrote a book.  Being the<br/>
Americancentric jerk that he is he didn&#39;t feel that anything prior to<br/>
their arrival to America in the late 1700&#39;s was important.  So not<br/>
important he doesn&#39;t even mention where they came from!   On her<br/>
mother&#39;s side that also is fairly easy as my greatgrandmoter was 100%<br/>
Cherokee.  She was the first in her family to marry a European.  And<br/>
my grandfather was a Weaver and his father was from Scotland.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4267992">Alas....I have not yet been able to trace back my family roots due to the slave trade.  One day I hope to be able to do that and find out which countries in Africa my family came from.  I think it&#39;s wonderful if you can trace your family history back.  I know that many Asians keep a long family tree that can go back thousands of years.  That&#39;s awesome to me.<br/>
