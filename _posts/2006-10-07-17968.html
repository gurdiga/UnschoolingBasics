<div id="ygrps-yiv-205941738">&lt;&lt;&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t believe in absolutes!&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***That was someone else***<br/>
<br/>
From message 17906:<br/>
***I just don&#39;t think there are any absolutes in this world,***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s ok.  I was only teasing you a little.<br/>
<br/>
But in a more serious way it really will help to think about everything. <br/>
Everything you&#39;re holding onto from your childhood, from your schooling, <br/>
from your parents.   Because when we understand our fears and our <br/>
motivations we can begin to take positive steps in the direction we want to <br/>
go.    So if someone says &quot; I don&#39;t believe there are absolutes&quot; and then <br/>
says &quot; This is absolutely true&quot; it might be a little scrap of evidence that <br/>
suggests we&#39;re kind of parroting things we&#39;ve heard but never taken the time <br/>
to consider what *our* feelings and beliefs on the matter really are.<br/>
<br/>
***If only I could make sense out of the freakin&#39; game! I&#39;m a total<br/>
idiot when it comes to these strategy role-playing games. ***<br/>
<br/>
You have my sympathetic understanding.  I was never very good at those. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
But my kid has moved away from games for the time being.  And now I don&#39;t <br/>
know about camera angles and lenses and filters and whatnot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399888596">***SO WHY DO I FRET SO MUCH?? LOL.***<br/>
<br/>
Because what you&#39;re doing now is so much outside the mainstream.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have that comfort zone of traditional schooling, traditional parenting. <br/>
traditional responses.   You&#39;re swimming out into the deep end without your <br/>
waterwings!<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s really ok.  The water&#39;s fine.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
