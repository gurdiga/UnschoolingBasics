<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872726685">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 children (aged 19 to 6), and have lost a child two times in  <br/>
the last 19 years.<br/>
Both times were in a big mall and they were fine--the first time I  <br/>
dialed 999<br/>
and they transferred me to mall security who found my child in less  <br/>
than 5<br/>
minutes.  The second time was in a big shop and a nice lady took her<br/>
to a shop worker, who took her to the main customer service desk.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long-winded...I have always taught my children to look<br/>
for a &quot;grandma&quot; if they get lost.  I tell them that almost everyone in<br/>
the world is good, but if on the slim chance they ever run into a bad<br/>
person, the best thing to do is *bite.*<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 pence :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another possibility is to have a child look for a kid their own size <br/>
and ask that kid&#39;s mommy for assistance. Since toddler sized kids tend <br/>
to gravitate toward other kids anyway, it seems like this would be a <br/>
reasonable tack to take.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a problem with DS getting lost, partly because he&#39;s <br/>
always had a fairly large &#39;range&#39; - rule of thumb was &quot;if you can see <br/>
my eyeballs, I can see you&quot; so he can range anywhere that my eyeballs <br/>
can spot - gives a fairly large &#39;roaming zone&#39; yet still where I can <br/>
track him. When he was littler, he&#39;d grab whatever part of me he chose <br/>
to hold - pants leg, pocket, jacket sleeve, hand, whatever - having <br/>
some measure of control over things helped. And, sometimes, rather <br/>
than hold his hand (or have him hold mine) I&#39;d put my arm around his <br/>
shoulders, friendly-like, and we&#39;d walk like that - and now that he&#39;s <br/>
8 he puts his arm around my waist sometimes as we walk through parking <br/>
lots and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Having to let go and let him go to the men&#39;s room (he&#39;s now 8) over <br/>
the last couple years has been really hard on me, nervous-wise. When <br/>
he was first making that transition, I&#39;d stand right nearby the door <br/>
and listen for unusual sounds and &quot;memorize&quot; anyone who went in or <br/>
out - relative height (my height, a little taller, tall as DH, a lot <br/>
taller, etc), coloring (dark hair, light hair, short or long hair, <br/>
facial hair, etc), clothing, etc &quot;just in case&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that we&#39;ve done (DS started doing it on his own and we&#39;ve <br/>
made a habit of it) is that when I needed to go to the ladies&#39; room at <br/>
the mall, he stood just outside it (since they don&#39;t have doors any <br/>
more, just L shaped type walls to create a private space for the <br/>
stalls) he picks a song and sings or hums just loud enough for me to <br/>
hear but not really loud - so long as I can hear his hum, I know he&#39;s <br/>
right there. And I do the same when he&#39;s inside and I&#39;m outside.<br/>
