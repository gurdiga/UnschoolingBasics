My dh is like your a hard worker who gives us a comfortable living to <br/>
let us have this life style..<br/>
<br/>
For my part I say thank you , thank you. I let him know how much I <br/>
appreciate him. I also try to plan things I know he will love when he <br/>
is able to be home.<br/>
<br/>
When we discuss a trip or an outing we ask. We currently have a ski day <br/>
planned and are waiting for dh schedule to open up to he can come too. <br/>
<br/>
I am not a slope bunny&lt;BWG&gt; but the kids will LOVE skiing with their <br/>
dad.<br/>
<br/>
Ask dh what he is missing. Help him look at how to get more of what he <br/>
is desiring.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that was at least a bit helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707578027">One of the things that I would imagine would help me if I were spending days away from Simon and Linnaea would be lots of pictures and e-mails so that I could feel more involved. Just little notes throughout the day, scanned drawings, things that would let me know that even though I wasn&#39;t there I was involved, my family was thinking about me, and not having to play so much catch up when I got home. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017132034">DH has said that - things that helped included acknowledging the<br/>
feelings (letting him talk without interrupting, not trying to change<br/>
his feelings, etc - same as we&#39;d do for the kids). Appreciating the<br/>
situation is important too - I know that it helps me feel better about<br/>
being the WOH parent knowing that DH recognizes that my going to work<br/>
allows for the lifestyle we all enjoy - it gets verbalized, not just<br/>
assumed. Then, we talked about how he *can* get the things he wants, the<br/>
things he wished he had now and things he wishes he&#39;d had when he was a<br/>
kid (the same kind of respect, autonomy, freedom, etc). Things to<br/>
discuss might include:<br/>
 <br/>
-Does he &quot;have to&quot; keep this job if the hours are causing problems? I<br/>
know changing jobs is not always readily available or easy but put it<br/>
out on the table at least. Feeling like he&#39;s got a choice is important -<br/>
even if you together choose to stick with the current employment<br/>
situation, just knowing it IS a choice is important.<br/>
-Are there ways he can work with his employer/boss to maybe have at<br/>
least a couple days per week that he can shift it by a little bit? Maybe<br/>
start at 7:30 am instead of 5:30?<br/>
-Does he get more time late in the day because he goes in so early (as<br/>
in starting at 5:30 am means he&#39;s home by 3 in the afternoon)? <br/>
-Does he work longer shifts/shorter week (four 10 hr shifts for<br/>
example)? If so, can you and the kids plan to include him more on his<br/>
off days - maybe not schedule many &quot;events&quot; for those days (move the<br/>
guitar lessons to a different day for instance) so that he can have more<br/>
general time with everyone?<br/>
-Does he get vacation time he can use &#39;creatively&#39;? For instance, this<br/>
year, instead of one big vacation, I&#39;m going to take most of my vacation<br/>
time as one or two day bits to make 3 or 4 day weekends. That way we can<br/>
have fun some way almost every month (any months that don&#39;t have a built<br/>
in Monday holiday get a vacation day &#39;holiday&#39;). I also (back when we<br/>
did field trips more often with a local hs group) would plan for one or<br/>
two days per year to take off and go with them (the &#39;big&#39; trips like the<br/>
Bronx Zoo).<br/>
-Are there ways you can communicate with him during the day to keep him<br/>
&#39;in the loop&#39; at least? Some folks use private blogs so that the away<br/>
from home parent can log in whenever they get a chance to see what&#39;s up.<br/>
We deliberately chose cell phones with decent cameras (even though<br/>
slightly more expensive) so that when my guys are out and about, they<br/>
can message me with pictures of things that are fun - snakes and lizards<br/>
in the backyard, the submarine they visited on a field trip to the naval<br/>
sub base/submarine museum, neat waterfalls on local hiking trails, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once you discuss things with your DH, maybe have a family meeting to get<br/>
creative with it - if his biggest concern is not being connected to the<br/>
stuff you&#39;re doing, discuss ways to include him  - whether it&#39;s lots of<br/>
photos, a blog, phone calls (I usually call/get called at least twice<br/>
per day when I&#39;m at work), creatively scheduling the &#39;fun&#39; stuff so that<br/>
DH can participate some of the time, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130518702">**-Does he &quot;have to&quot; keep this job if the hours are causing problems?<br/>
** <br/>
<br/>
This is actually a new job, and a vast improvement over the old one.  <br/>
He actually gets Saturday and Sunday off now.  He used to work 7 days <br/>
a week.  He actually likes the company he works for now.<br/>
<br/>
**-Are there ways he can work with his employer/boss to maybe have at <br/>
least a couple days per week that he can shift it by a little bit? <br/>
Maybe start at 7:30 am instead of 5:30?**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny how the universe works. When I wrote my original post, he <br/>
was a shift supervisor - there is no chance for shifting hours in <br/>
that position.  The very next day after I wrote the post he found out <br/>
he was being moved to quality control.  He should be starting his day <br/>
a little later now.<br/>
<br/>
***maybe not schedule many &quot;events&quot; for those days (move the guitar <br/>
lessons to a different day for instance) so that he can have more <br/>
general time with everyone?****<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this big eye opener.  I realized I was over-scheduling <br/>
saturdays.  This is his one day to do what he wants, and I tend to <br/>
plan some big family thing on this day.  He either has to do what I <br/>
pick or get left at home alone.  He really wants to use the first <br/>
half of the day to do things around the house, and the second half to <br/>
do fun stuff with the family (not something I prescheduled without <br/>
asking him).  So, today I threw out the museum trip I had planned, <br/>
let him sleep in as late as he wanted, helped him when he asked for <br/>
it, and respected the choices he made about how to spend his time.  <br/>
Funny - he just wants to be treated the same as the kids.<br/>
<br/>
***-Does he get vacation time he can use &#39;creatively&#39;? For instance, <br/>
this year, instead of one big vacation, I&#39;m going to take most of my <br/>
vacation time as one or two day bits to make 3 or 4 day weekends. <br/>
That way we can have fun some way almost every month (any months that <br/>
don&#39;t have a built in Monday holiday get a vacation <br/>
day &#39;holiday&#39;).*** <br/>
<br/>
This is a great idea.  He&#39;s already scheduled vacation for the L&L <br/>
conference, and the mill tends to shut down around major holidays.  <br/>
He has several other vacation days just waiting to be used.  He could <br/>
schedule these days randomly throughout the year as days to do <br/>
whatever he wants to do.  He really doesn&#39;t get to do what he wants <br/>
to do very much.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me get to the heart of the issue.  I am actually <br/>
causing the problem by not allowing my dh to make his own choices <br/>
about how to spend his days off from work. This is definately <br/>
something I can change.<br/>
