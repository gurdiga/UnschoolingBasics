<div id="ygrps-yiv-727366060">Last night I was surfing channels nursing my 10 month old to sleep and came across the new show on TLC &quot;House of Tiny Terror&quot;. The title itself is disgusting but I was not prepared to see so much abuse being portrayed as good parenting by an &quot;expert&quot;. I wanted to throw up.<br/>
  That is why parents do not know what  happens when their kids grow up and are angry or worse.<br/>
  Enough with my rant. I got to keep myself from seeing those shows that make me sick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781766422">These body socks are very popular for kids with autism and sensory<br/>
processing needs. Many of these kids crave that kind of input. they<br/>
are used in therapy quite often, but to use it in the way that this<br/>
school apparently has is overstapping the boundaries... Definitely<br/>
seemed like punishment to me, and NOT a calming experience for that<br/>
child. Ihad to try one as a part of training when I worked in an<br/>
autsim program. I couldn&#39;t get out fast enough - gave me high anxiety<br/>
- I hate any type of situation where I feel my breathing could be<br/>
compromised (either by too small a space or too many people) - yes,<br/>
it&#39;s an odd phobia but a very real one for me...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129738849">OK, I was just able to link up to this article.  As I said previously my daughter has sensory issues and Asperger&#39;s Syndrome.  Now I&#39;d think a school district would be setting themselves up for a liability situation.  The picture they showed the body sock went over the head......I would not allow that with my daughter unless it was her idea.  It&#39;s been my understanding that these types of socks are used for Occupational Therapy.  I don&#39;t think they were meant or developed to be used as a discipline technique, so I&#39;m not sure what this school was thinking.  I think I would only allow this to be used with my daughter in an Occupational Therapy setting while I was there, or at home if it was her idea.  Definately not as a discipline technique.  Now I understand why everyone is so offended.<br/>

would be fun if it were big enough.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking at the pix wondering if I could make one - a nice <br/>
cotton-lycra blend would breathe well, and it looks like they &quot;velcro&quot; <br/>
shut - or they could, anyway. That would eliminate the hassle of <br/>
trying to work a zipper from the inside. Hmmmmm. Y&#39;know I have <br/>
some &quot;stretch tulle&quot; somewhere - basically a stretchy mesh, so its see-<br/>
through and totally breathable. I may be doing some experimenting....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The ones we used to use were just pieces of spandex/lycra blends sewn<br/>
up the sides, with both ends open. The kids would just crawl into them<br/>
and hang out. Some wanted their heads out, some didn&#39;t. I think the<br/>
socks were about 6ft long - definitely long enough for them to get<br/>
alot of input as they were making their way through the sock to the end. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thing...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay,  I had to reply to this.  As a former teacher and parent.  I <br/>
have both seen and used the &quot;body sock&quot; but it&#39;s not at all what they <br/>
make it out to be.  When we used it in our class room it was brought <br/>
in by a museum group called Arts Partners.  It was used for movement <br/>
just like scarves and stretchy bands, instruments and other such <br/>
things.  Kids were allowed to try it and move around to the beat of <br/>
music.  No child was forced, but we encouraged them to try it out for <br/>
something new.  Most of the kids loved it.  But, if they were <br/>
uncomfortable then they didn&#39;t do it, no big deal.  This teacher <br/>
might have been a wacko who thought it was calming and tried to <br/>
assert it in another way, but when I read the part about the <br/>
assistant putting a child back in I thought, maybe she misunderstood <br/>
the child and thought he needed help getting back in.  They had these <br/>
at an arts festival I took my daughter to in August then, 2.5 yo.  I <br/>
got in and showed it to my dd so she&#39;d know what it was.  I appeared <br/>
to be the only person there who knew what they were for, so I kind of <br/>
demonstrated to everyone.  It&#39;s a lycra type material that you can <br/>
easily see out of and breath, unless of course you&#39;re closterphobic <br/>
or something.  Anyway, dd tried it out a couple of times, but <br/>
ultimately she&#39;s not into that kind of thing, she wasn&#39;t interested <br/>
in most the stuff in the music / movement section.  Anyway, I don&#39;t <br/>
know exactly what was going on there, but I rather doubt the district <br/>
or even school as a whole use it as &quot;punishment&quot;  Just wantd to set <br/>
the record straight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022166922">I have to put my 2 cents in on this. I have an autistic son who loves this sort of stuff. He likes to lay under his mattress (head out) have his backpack on with a few books in it, have me squish him under a pillow ( again of course head out) . These are sensory tool and are proven calmers for some kids...the bodysock included. They can be a great help. <br/>
   <br/>
  What this teacher did wrong in my opinion......<br/>
   <br/>
  First no kid with asthma should be given a &quot;therapy&quot; that restrains their chest...no the body sock dosent but I like to mention it because I dont want anyone trying to squish their asmatic child with pillows. <br/>
   <br/>
  Second ....Always, always, always respect the childs wishes.... Would you like to be a burrito today ? ( wrapping a blanket tightly around the child ) then assuming the child gave a yes ...you need to stay right with the child and give assurance that as soon as they ( child ) says Im done you will unwrap and of course follow through with that. <br/>
   <br/>
  I dont think its abuse in fact can help a great deal but it sometimes worries me because when done the wrong way it can go from something that a child might have tried after seeing it 3 or 4 times and might have been helped by to something they are horrified of. <br/>
