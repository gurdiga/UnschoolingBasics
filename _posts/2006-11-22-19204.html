<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640999568">Our experience is this:<br/>
 <br/>
We have never limited the tv.  My oldest, now 16, was a major Disney fan, knew all<br/>
the songs, and played all the princesses.  She has a very high IQ, speaks four languages,<br/>
and by her choice, is currently taking college courses.  She is a people person and loves<br/>
exploring different cultures.<br/>
 <br/>
My youngest, now 9, was and still is a major fan of the history channel and animal planet.<br/>
His first favorite book was a military airplane encyclopedia (age 1-3).  He could name all the<br/>
parts of a plane or helicopter before he knew his colors.  That&#39;s his &#39;thing&#39;.  He loves strategy<br/>
games, has been playing chess since five, and likes to create his own role playing games.<br/>
He, also, has a very high IQ.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have tried to supply my kids with the things, information and experiences that they are in to.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t tell you if they were just born &#39;smart&#39; or if environment made them that way.  <br/>
Both were nursed.  Both had full time parents involved with them everyday.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292235481">Constant turmoil sounds like a lot of pain. Far more than I would be willing <br/>
to suffer. Certainly over what other people think about something. So, to <br/>
put you out of your misery, I love television. I love watching different <br/>
kinds of shows from Animal Planet sort of stuff, documentaries and nature <br/>
programs, to cartoons and movies and sitcoms. I find out so many more things <br/>
make up the world than those things I usually think about.<br/>
<br/>
But that probably isn&#39;t what you meant. So, let me reassure you, television <br/>
doesn&#39;t stunt learning and creativity. At 2.5 years old, the worst it can do <br/>
is... nope I can&#39;t think of a worst thing. I loved sitting with Simon and <br/>
watching Teletubbies. He loved Teletubbies. And I still smile at the unaging <br/>
baby in the face of the setting, or rising sun. When he was 2.5, gosh, 6.5 <br/>
years ago, I didn&#39;t really limit his television. But I did get really upset <br/>
when my brother gave us a Sega Dreamcast for Christmas. I didn&#39;t think that <br/>
was a good influence at all. Hard to reach back to that mindset. I believed <br/>
that virtual violence made real violence more likely. But it didn&#39;t. Sam, my <br/>
brother, gave us the Dreamcast and a fishing game with the fishing rod <br/>
controller so that we could practice up for fishing that summer. And slowly <br/>
we added to the games. We got a game where you raced by sliding on your <br/>
belly or on skis down a mountainside and we got Tokyo extreme racer and we <br/>
got some questing games, &#39;cause I like questing games. And we got Sonic the <br/>
Hedgehog games. Simon loved and still loves Sonic the Hedgehog. But, to this <br/>
day, I&#39;ve never seen him obsessing over collecting gold rings. Simon, who is <br/>
amazing at video games, is the gentlest and sweetest boy I know--I recognize <br/>
I&#39;m biased. He does like to play physically, but so did I and I had Pong <br/>
when I was a kid. He got upset playing Mystery Dungeon, a new Pokemon game <br/>
for the DS, when it was suggested in the gameplay that his character might <br/>
have abandoned his Pokemon. He didn&#39;t play it for 2 days. Couldn&#39;t bring <br/>
himself to facing the idea that he was playing such a non-noble character.<br/>
<br/>
All that is to say that I was wrong. Video games do not beget violence, and <br/>
television doesn&#39;t stunt creativity or learning. It&#39;s just lies people tell <br/>
you because they read it somewhere and they know in their heart of hearts <br/>
that learning is difficult and arduous and television and video games are <br/>
fun and sometimes relaxing so it isn&#39;t possible that they can be learning. <br/>
So don&#39;t believe them. Learning is fun! and not in the sing song voice way <br/>
that all the hooked on phonics games swear by. Learning is stimulating and <br/>
exciting and interesting and engaging. And television can be too.<br/>
<br/>
Tv-holic isn&#39;t really a good way to approach your son&#39;s relationship with <br/>
television. It argues that it is addictive from the start. It argues that it <br/>
is something that he will not be able to take or leave, that it will be the <br/>
only motivating thing in his life. And it certainly makes that little box in <br/>
the living room, or whatever room, loom large. Television is really an <br/>
amazing window into the world. And if you can trust your son to be able to <br/>
get what he wants from television than it can shrink back down to a more <br/>
reasonable size and not make you suffer such constant turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend reading through <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vilter.us/Television/index.html">http://vilter.us/Television/index.html</a> , which is linked from Sandra Dodd&#39;s <br/>
tv page, but I think should be highlighted. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> has a nice section on <br/>
television. It&#39;s on the left hand side about halfway down.<br/>
<br/>
The trick of unschooling is opening the world up in front of your children <br/>
and offering it up to them for them to explore. It isn&#39;t closing the doors <br/>
and windows so that you can keep them safe from the bits that aren&#39;t given <br/>
approval by everyone. Or that you don&#39;t trust will be safe. If you are there <br/>
with him, and watching next to him, and laughing and giggling and blowing on <br/>
his belly during the ad breaks, how can television be more than a part of <br/>
that world?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497918876">I fall into the &quot;don&#39;t offer, don&#39;t refuse&quot; department. There are many<br/>
iterations between buying cable (which we did recently) for ds (and<br/>
dh), and limiting tv viewing time. We had many videos that ds watched<br/>
at will, before his interest led us to pay for cable for NickJr. We<br/>
also purchased a lot of videos (mostly from the kid&#39;s consignment<br/>
stores), and borrowed videos from the library, and rented DVDs from<br/>
the Blockbuster store and Blockbuster on-line. I still don&#39;t watch<br/>
much of any tv, except with ds. Dh loves the sports on tv. If you<br/>
already have tv and cable, it is difficult to deny tv without it being<br/>
restrictive. We also have &quot;TIVO&quot;/DVR which allows us to record ds&#39;s<br/>
favorite shows, so that he has something available that he prefers to<br/>
watch.<br/>
<br/>
Ds learns so much from tv. And it is important to me to be available<br/>
and aware of what he is learning. I understand more about what ds<br/>
likes and values by choosing to be engaged with the shows that he<br/>
watches. I will mention that ds is very selective and discriminating<br/>
about shows; he&#39;ll just turn a show off at the first hint of anything<br/>
scary or sad. He is highly sensitive and very aware of the emotional<br/>
energy of others. By his preference, he won&#39;t watch any dramatic<br/>
stories (there is usually a journey or conflict to overcome), or live<br/>
action shows with conflict. He has no sense of &#39;needing to watch this<br/>
because viewing time is limited&#39;. I believe this empowers him to be<br/>
more particular about what he watches. <br/>
<br/>
But, I don&#39;t believe there is an inherent need to introduce tv to a<br/>
child&#39;s environment. Learning happens all the time, even without tv.<br/>
There are many, many ways to enrich and add joy to a child&#39;s life. TV<br/>
is just one of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560665025">our family&#39;s experience (not very unschooly, i know):<br/>
<br/>
when dh and i had cable, we watched it too much. by<br/>
too much, i mean it was easier to be passively<br/>
entertained than to &quot;do&quot; anything. i spent weekdays in<br/>
front of decorating shows and weekend mornings in<br/>
front of gardening shows. i dreamed and schemed and<br/>
spent way too much mental money, my head always full<br/>
of projects i couldn&#39;t take on. dh spent evenings and<br/>
weekend afternoons in front of the history channel. <br/>
<br/>
we became annoyed when our cable company raised rates<br/>
twice in one year, so we just cut it off one day. we<br/>
thought it would be &quot;good for the kids&quot; anyway,<br/>
because frankly we didn&#39;t want them seeing all those<br/>
awful  commercials  :)<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t want an antenna on the roof (don&#39;t laugh!) so<br/>
dh decided to get an attic antenna. weeks passed and<br/>
we didn&#39;t get around to it. eventually we forgot. we<br/>
rented movies from video stores, purchased them at<br/>
yard sales and borrowed from the library. we played<br/>
card games and board games after dinner and read aloud<br/>
much more often. we eventually became comfortable with<br/>
not having cable and stopped missing it. believe it or<br/>
not, it took quite awhile (about three months) and now<br/>
both of us will tell you, if asked, that we are glad<br/>
it worked out this way. for whatever reason the tv<br/>
distracted us from one another. whether we were<br/>
&quot;addicted&quot; or watching what many consider a &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
amount of tv is up to the individual; we feel that our<br/>
family benefited from us tossing the tube.<br/>
<br/>
notice there&#39;s nothing here about how much tv the kids<br/>
were watching?!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s been almost four years since we cut the cable<br/>
service. what&#39;s really funny is that people think it&#39;s<br/>
very &quot;strange&quot; that we don&#39;t have access to tv at all<br/>
in our home. they are truly amazed that we &quot;get along&quot;<br/>
without the tv news broadcasts and reality shows. they<br/>
unashamedly gasp and say they don&#39;t think they could<br/>
do it (much the same as when people say they don&#39;t see<br/>
how i &quot;stay home&quot; with our three kids all day). i&#39;m<br/>
amazed at how many conversations everywhere we go are<br/>
about these network shows and at how people become<br/>
obsessed with the details of these tv characters&#39;<br/>
lives! LOL<br/>
<br/>
in my fantasy world, the discovery channel, history<br/>
channel, animal planet and home and garden television<br/>
are available commercial-free and free of charge!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents...hope it helped!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091440460">T.V. has never been limited around here.  My kids are 5 and 3 and are <br/>
extremely creative, engaging, fun to be around and have LOTS of interests.  <br/>
They watch t.v. when they want to.  One thing i have noticed is that if the <br/>
t.v. is on disney for example and there really is very little else going on <br/>
that they will watch for a long time.  However, if I dvr their favorite <br/>
shows they can see them when they want to (they ask because they dont know <br/>
how to use the controller yet) and when it goes off they typically go on to <br/>
something else.. or sometimes ask me to put on another show.  Whichever is <br/>
fine with me but I feel it gives them more of a choice to stop watching.  Tv <br/>
shows have opened up alot of new interests for the kids and new topics for <br/>
us to talk about.  By dvring the shows the kids now they can watch things <br/>
whenever they want to so it doesnt tie us down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707015781">my previous post focussed more on the adult<br/>
relationship to the tv, so probably was not very<br/>
helpful. let me try again...<br/>
<br/>
ds8 chooses to watch more tv than his siblings,<br/>
probably more than any other family member. ds5 has<br/>
begun to sit and watch more in the last 6 mos than<br/>
before and has begun to enact scenes from what he has<br/>
viewed while engaged in fantasy play. dd2 has very<br/>
little interest until the evenings. she will &quot;zone&quot; in<br/>
front of whatever the boys are watching when she<br/>
becomes tired, just like anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
ds8 was strongly attracted to the tv screen from a<br/>
very young age. he would watch almost an entire hour<br/>
of teletubbies when he was about a year old. this<br/>
seems to be something unique to his<br/>
personality/learning style. well, maybe not unique, as<br/>
dh has trouble looking away from any tv screen no<br/>
matter what it is showing at the time!  LOL <br/>
<br/>
ds5 was always too busy physically to pay much<br/>
attention to the tube until recently. now he watches<br/>
much of what his brother watches, peppering him with<br/>
questions and commentary the entire time!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
dd2 may choose to watch more as she gets older, the<br/>
way her brother did. we won&#39;t know until we get there.<br/>
in the evenings when she is tired, she really enjoys<br/>
sitting in my lap with a baby einstein video. we talk<br/>
about the images and music, and after it&#39;s over, she<br/>
seems refreshed and ready to move on to more active<br/>
play.  :)<br/>
<br/>
just from observing my own children, i think there are<br/>
many factors determining how much tv a child will<br/>
watch, including age, temperament, learning style,<br/>
lack of other interests, etc.<br/>
<br/>
overall, i don&#39;t think tv has affected my childrens&#39;<br/>
intelligence, activity levels or anything else in a<br/>
negative manner.<br/>
<br/>
keep in mind all of our tv watching is videos, due to<br/>
lack of cable or local network hook-up. the boys love<br/>
disney movies, scooby doo, tom and jerry and the like.<br/>
also stories about empowered children such as fly away<br/>
home and free willy. and videos of faraway places,<br/>
such as south america and australia. plus non-fiction<br/>
for children such as the eyewitness series. we have<br/>
checked and re-checked countless videos on volcanoes,<br/>
dinosaurs, and various weather phenomenon (especially<br/>
hurricanes, after hurricane katrina wiped out so many<br/>
of our loved ones&#39; homes a year ago).<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ll bet at two and a half, your child has a whole lot<br/>
more interest in many other things besides tv. maybe<br/>
try turning it on for him only if he asks for it,<br/>
whether that be every other day or three or four times<br/>
a day! let him learn early that he is in charge of it;<br/>
it&#39;s not in charge of him! like you said, it can be a<br/>
tool for his learning about the world!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
ds8 was working our vcr at age 18 mos, and we never<br/>
had a pb&j sandwich inserted into it! LOL children can<br/>
be guided to operate electronics responsibly at a<br/>
surprisingly early age. if you think it may work for<br/>
your family, try putting him in charge for a while and<br/>
see what happens.<br/>

Kelli,<br/>
We did the same thing for a year-completely cut the cable service. I did it because it angered me that I could not select the channels I wanted, I was forced to purchase a whole package when I only wanted some of the channels in the package. I believe you should be able to &quot;menu select&quot; the channels you want to pay for. Anyway, I also noticed how much people&#39;s conversations revolved around ficticious people&#39;s lives in television shows, and my kids felt left out because they were not able to follow what the other kids (at school, of course) were talking about. (I would have preferred to raise my kids without television but I lost out on the issue.) What disgusts me is the abundance of television shows that revolve around the gruesome murder of someone, usually female. These shows are sometimes fiction, (like CSI) but often are crime shows depicting real cases of brutality against (mainly) young women. Personally,  I think it normalizes violence against women, but thats just my opini<br/>
on. There are also shows glorifying the merits of cosmetic surgery, and the proliferation of &quot;airhead&quot; female characters who make being stupid look cool and desireable. Then there&#39;s the soft core porn, like the Paris-Hilton-gets-off-with-a-hamburger-during-half time genre, and the girls in underwear gyrating their crotch in the face of music artists on BET. Unfortunately my kids dont choose the History channel, they choose that crap. We now have limited cable, but the clamor is up for the full package. Commercials are largely annoying to me as well. There is a rare good one, but they play them over and over, sometimes back to back, and the volume automatically goes up when the commercials come on. Overall, I dont believe television has had a positive influence on our family life. When we got rid of it for that year, our conversations were more in-depth and stimulating and we had more choice of what to bring in to our living room by choosing movies to rent. With TV, unless you are e<br/>
xtremely proactive with the remote, you get bombarded with a lot of crap. I am probably a minority opinion here, but I agree with the folks with the &quot;shoot your television&quot; bumper stickers on thier car. I have a close friend in England who has not had a TV for over four years and he feels getting rid of the TV is a subversive act. My advice is that if your kids are young enough to not miss it, and you dont really want or need it, dont have TV. You can always get it later if you feel the need.<br/>

our family&#39;s experience (not very unschooly, i know):<br/>
<br/>
when dh and i had cable, we watched it too much. by<br/>
too much, i mean it was easier to be passively<br/>
entertained than to &quot;do&quot; anything. i spent weekdays in<br/>
front of decorating shows and weekend mornings in<br/>
front of gardening shows. i dreamed and schemed and<br/>
spent way too much mental money, my head always full<br/>
of projects i couldn&#39;t take on. dh spent evenings and<br/>
weekend afternoons in front of the history channel. <br/>
<br/>
we became annoyed when our cable company raised rates<br/>
twice in one year, so we just cut it off one day. we<br/>
thought it would be &quot;good for the kids&quot; anyway,<br/>
because frankly we didn&#39;t want them seeing all those<br/>
awful commercials :)<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t want an antenna on the roof (don&#39;t laugh!) so<br/>
dh decided to get an attic antenna. weeks passed and<br/>
we didn&#39;t get around to it. eventually we forgot. we<br/>
rented movies from video stores, purchased them at<br/>
yard sales and borrowed from the library. we played<br/>
card games and board games after dinner and read aloud<br/>
much more often. we eventually became comfortable with<br/>
not having cable and stopped missing it. believe it or<br/>
not, it took quite awhile (about three months) and now<br/>
both of us will tell you, if asked, that we are glad<br/>
it worked out this way. for whatever reason the tv<br/>
distracted us from one another. whether we were<br/>
&quot;addicted&quot; or watching what many consider a &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
amount of tv is up to the individual; we feel that our<br/>
family benefited from us tossing the tube.<br/>
<br/>
notice there&#39;s nothing here about how much tv the kids<br/>
were watching?!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s been almost four years since we cut the cable<br/>
service. what&#39;s really funny is that people think it&#39;s<br/>
very &quot;strange&quot; that we don&#39;t have access to tv at all<br/>
in our home. they are truly amazed that we &quot;get along&quot;<br/>
without the tv news broadcasts and reality shows. they<br/>
unashamedly gasp and say they don&#39;t think they could<br/>
do it (much the same as when people say they don&#39;t see<br/>
how i &quot;stay home&quot; with our three kids all day). i&#39;m<br/>
amazed at how many conversations everywhere we go are<br/>
about these network shows and at how people become<br/>
obsessed with the details of these tv characters&#39;<br/>
lives! LOL<br/>
<br/>
in my fantasy world, the discovery channel, history<br/>
channel, animal planet and home and garden television<br/>
are available commercial-free and free of charge! LOL<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents...hope it helped!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids have had pretty much unlimited tv for most of their lives,<br/>
even prior to us unschooling.  They are extremely bright and creative<br/>
kids.  Will a child do nothing but watch tv all day?  Perhaps if there<br/>
are no other options.  But given other options my kids will usually<br/>
choose &quot;other&quot; over tv.  We also have DVR (of which I highly<br/>
recommend) so when there are schedule conflicts or an ill-timed<br/>
program (it conflicts with something else we want to do) we record and<br/>
go.  It never ceases to amaze me what I will find my kids watching.<br/>
It might be Power Rangers or it might be the History Channel.  Perhaps<br/>
it is the Cheetah Girl&#39;s 2 or perhaps a show on Cheetah&#39;s on National<br/>
Geographic Channel.  I might even find them watching anime or some<br/>
obscure program  in Japanese with subtitles.<br/>

<br/>
You never know where TV programs may lead you or your kids.  Tristan (he just turned 10) was a huge fan of &quot;One Piece&quot; on the Cartoon Network.  I have to admit that I hated the show...the voices and the jokes just grated on my nerves, and I had to leave the room when it came on.  I did a bit of searching around and found it was dubbed from original Japanese anime (many shows are like this, but the One Piece animation style is so different I didn&#39;t pick up on it at first...anyway....).<br/>
<br/>
I found a One Piece movie in it&#39;s original Japanese form with subtitles.  Tristan is now a HUGE anime fan and insists that all anime MUST be seen in Japanese with the original voices. ;o)  He has no issues with reading hours and hours of subtitles; it&#39;s what he prefers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we have indepth conversations about the characters, the plots, and have searched out other anime with the same voice actors.<br/>
<br/>
I guess some would argue the above is &quot;revolving our lives&quot; around fictitious characters by all our discussions, but I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  Tristan and I have found a common interest that has brought us together.  We talk about the relationships and idiosyncracies of the characters and how we see those same traits in many people we either know or have known in the past.  We make jokes about the shows.  We are a family of movies lovers, and it&#39;s not uncommon for us to start reciting lines from movies....we are now doing that with the anime (in both Japanese and English).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also brought around a huge interest in the Japanese language, especially for me!  I&#39;ve been floundering for nearly a year trying to discover what my passions are.  I found one lies with learning Japanese.  This passion has now opened me up to several other interests I haven&#39;t touched in so very long like drawing and wrtiting.<br/>
<br/>
Tristan has picked up a number of Japanese words with no sort of &quot;formal&quot; study (he has a much better ear than I when it comes to reading the subtitles and picking up the spoken word) and has a huge interest now in Japanese music.  He&#39;ll devour manga, come up with his own stories, and finds various anime/manga pics and challenges me to draw them.  He even crafted one of the characters out of polymer clay.<br/>
<br/>
During the last L&L Conference Joyce had a anime/manga cosplay funshop.  Tristan spent so much time thinking and putting his costume together, down to the smallest detail.  He had the list of items he needed to find at the thrift store, what supplies he had to buy at other stores, etc.  And he ended up being nearly a spitting image of the character (well, that&#39;s my biased &quot;mom opinion&quot; LOL).<br/>
<br/>
All this from a TV show that I used to detest....go figure! ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269853784">kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
as you read, dh and i got rid of cable service because<br/>
of the ridiculous fees, but chose to KEEP it off<br/>
because we saw a dramatic improvement in *our*<br/>
behaviors and attitudes. nothing to do with the kids!<br/>
<br/>
our kids are small yet...just 8, 5, and 2. we plan to<br/>
keep it off until they ask for it, at which time we<br/>
will re-evaluate the choice. maybe by then we will be<br/>
able to choose the specific channels we wish to<br/>
purchase!<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t feel we are &quot;missing&quot; anything and the kids<br/>
definitely don&#39;t think so. they know some of their<br/>
friends watch shows that are unknown to them, but<br/>
haven&#39;t yet asked why WE don&#39;t have those shows. the<br/>
day will come, though, and that&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
for now ds8 becomes very impatient when commercials<br/>
run and &quot;ruin&quot; the program he is trying to watch at<br/>
gram&#39;s house!  LOL  we have used commercials as a<br/>
jumping-off point for discussing advertising in<br/>
general, so that&#39;s been a fun experience for all of<br/>
us.  :)<br/>
<br/>
btw, how old are your children now and are they still<br/>
in school?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kelli,<br/>
&gt; We did the same thing for a year-completely cut the<br/>
&gt; cable service. I did it because it angered me that I<br/>
&gt; could not select the channels I wanted, I was forced<br/>
&gt; to purchase a whole package when I only wanted some<br/>
&gt; of the channels in the package. I believe you should<br/>
&gt; be able to &quot;menu select&quot; the channels you want to<br/>
&gt; pay for. Anyway, I also noticed how much people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; conversations revolved around ficticious people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lives in television shows, and my kids felt left out<br/>
&gt; because they were not able to follow what the other<br/>
&gt; kids (at school, of course) were talking about. (I<br/>
&gt; would have preferred to raise my kids without<br/>
&gt; television but I lost out on the issue.) What<br/>
&gt; disgusts me is the abundance of television shows<br/>
&gt; that revolve around the gruesome murder of someone,<br/>
&gt; usually female. These shows are sometimes fiction,<br/>
&gt; (like CSI) but often are crime shows depicting real<br/>
&gt; cases of brutality against (mainly) young women.<br/>
&gt; Personally,  I think it normalizes violence against<br/>
&gt; women, but thats just my opini<br/>
&gt; on. There are also shows glorifying the merits of<br/>
&gt; cosmetic surgery, and the proliferation of &quot;airhead&quot;<br/>
&gt; female characters who make being stupid look cool<br/>
&gt; and desireable. Then there&#39;s the soft core porn,<br/>
&gt; like the<br/>
&gt; Paris-Hilton-gets-off-with-a-hamburger-during-half<br/>
&gt; time genre, and the girls in underwear gyrating<br/>
&gt; their crotch in the face of music artists on BET.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately my kids dont choose the History<br/>
&gt; channel, they choose that crap. We now have limited<br/>
&gt; cable, but the clamor is up for the full package.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205935675">~~our kids are small yet...just 8, 5, and 2. we plan to<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re open to re-evaluating the choice at least. BUT, have<br/>
you considered the possibility that your kids have heard enough<br/>
negative stuff about tv that they really don&#39;t feel open communication<br/>
can happen? I know *I* would NEVER have asked my folks about<br/>
television, knowing their negative views about it. There was no point<br/>
in talking about it, when I heard all the &quot;bad&quot; effects all the time.<br/>
<br/>
They shut down an opportunity for connecting and learning together,<br/>
without much thought. Just something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent says negative things about books all the time, I wonder if<br/>
the kids are going to ask for them the same?  Parents have a huge<br/>
ability to impact communication in a family, embracing opportunities<br/>
for learning or shutting them down with heavy judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Would a person wait until their kids were interested in books before<br/>
introducing them? Or say &quot;we plan to keep books out of our home until<br/>
they ask for them&quot;?<br/>
Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
I think our attitude about various forms of communication decides<br/>
whether it will be an opportunity to connect and learn or be a source<br/>
of distress.<br/>
<br/>
I had to learn this the hard way, trust me. After being brainwashed my<br/>
ENTIRE life about the ill-effects of tv I was convinced we didn&#39;t need<br/>
one. It took my beautiful children (and a few kicks-in-the-ass) to<br/>
help me shift my views. I&#39;m so grateful I&#39;ve learned that MY attitude<br/>
was deciding how much we got out of this one medium.<br/>
<br/>
We have learned SO much through television and it&#39;s no more or less<br/>
important than anything else in our home. My kids would rather play<br/>
games, knit, cook and do art projects than watch tv most of the<br/>
time.......because it&#39;s just another option now. One among many.<br/>

letting him watch too much.<br/>
<br/>
-=---=-<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s too much?<br/>
<br/>
Do you offer all sorts of other neat stuff to do? Or are you waiting <br/>
for him to stop watching TV and ask you for something else to do?<br/>
<br/>
If TV is his best option, he&#39;ll choose TV.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Before I started venturing into<br/>
unschooling I had thought I wanted to prevent a a tv-holic at all<br/>
costs, but now I&#39;m seeing that it may be a tool for his learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that, now that you&#39;ve ventured into unschooling, you&#39;re <br/>
producing a TV-holic?<br/>
<br/>
Limiting TV is more apt to produce that &quot;TV-holic&quot;---if there is such a <br/>
thing---than free access to TV. There&#39;s no *need* to watch when you can <br/>
anytime. No TV on here, but Dr. Phil&#39;s being recorded by TiVO.<br/>
<br/>
Did you watch TV as a child? Do you watch all day every day? Why? Why <br/>
not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need someone to dialouge with and help me to see it at<br/>
different angles. My fear of screwing up my kid is preventing me from<br/>
seeing clearly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Lose the fear. Start THINKING. Fear inhibits learning. What are you <br/>
afraid of? What do YOU think???<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUT, have<br/>
&gt; you considered the possibility that your kids have<br/>
&gt; heard enough<br/>
&gt; negative stuff about tv that they really don&#39;t feel<br/>
&gt; open communication<br/>
&gt; can happen? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we are not &quot;tv bashers&quot;, nor do we limit/control their<br/>
choice/use of videos at home or broadcast tv when<br/>
watching at other places. we don&#39;t feel tv is<br/>
inherently &quot;bad&quot; we just choose not to pay for cable!<br/>
to my knowledge, they haven&#39;t heard negative comments<br/>
about television from us. as you probably read from my<br/>
previous post, we choose not to have television for<br/>
our OWN sanity, not because of anything having to do<br/>
with the kids!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a parent says negative things about books all the<br/>
&gt; time, I wonder if<br/>
&gt; the kids are going to ask for them the same? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we strive to be pretty neutral about all forms of<br/>
media. there are no strong feelings either way<br/>
(well...this is not entirely true, as i am an avid<br/>
reader, so i&#39;m sure my dc have &quot;picked up&quot; on my<br/>
passion for books, but not because i&#39;ve preached it to<br/>
them). they watch videos of their choosing--although i<br/>
do strew. *grin*   they love books and magazines. they<br/>
play pc games and surf the net. they listen to music<br/>
cd&#39;s and broadcast radio. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would a person wait until their kids were interested<br/>
&gt; in books before<br/>
&gt; introducing them? Or say &quot;we plan to keep books out<br/>
&gt; of our home until<br/>
&gt; they ask for them&quot;?<br/>
&gt; Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmmm. i&#39;m not sure i understand. books and tv fall<br/>
into a broad category of entertainment/learning, along<br/>
with trampolines, video game systems, pools, computer<br/>
use, jump rope, bike riding, etc. we choose what to<br/>
&quot;introduce&quot; and bring into our home life based on<br/>
desire and interest of family members. like i said, my<br/>
children have definitely been exposed to tv programs,<br/>
and if they ever want to be able to view it at home,<br/>
we will decide then. same goes for trampolines and<br/>
video game systems. i don&#39;t see the need to stretch<br/>
myself or my finances providing these things for them<br/>
just because everyone else has them or they might be<br/>
&quot;missing out&quot;. especially when they have shown no<br/>
interest in having them!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have learned SO much through television and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no more or less<br/>
&gt; important than anything else in our home. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this sounds wonderful for your family, and i&#39;m sure<br/>
will apply to ours when our kids wake up one day and<br/>
decide they want cable. it&#39;s just a non-issue UNTIL<br/>
they express that desire. until then, we keep in mind<br/>
that tv is a great tool for learning, but certainly<br/>
not the only way to get information and entertainment.<br/>
they have their entire lives to enjoy tv and<br/>
trampolines, whenever they decide they would like to<br/>
have them!<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the response, ren. i&#39;ve been really<br/>
enjoying the great advice and differing viewpoints on<br/>
this list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I ponder from time to time. I don&#39;t have cable, <br/>
either. I also have a 5yr old who isn&#39;t always terribly verbally <br/>
expressive. So I&#39;ve wondered how I will/would know if she wants <br/>
cable - or in our case dish service. She might very well not ask for <br/>
it, especially if it wasn&#39;t a case of her deciding all of a sudden, <br/>
but slowly, over time. So I&#39;ve been trying to watch her in <br/>
situations where cable *is* available - friends houses, mostly - and <br/>
try to get a sense of what she might want that way, and also the <br/>
degree to which she understands &quot;cable&quot; vs watching movies, since <br/>
we&#39;d have to talk about the fact that to afford dish service we&#39;d <br/>
have to dump netflix. Right now I think she&#39;s happier with netflix.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even started to factor in my stepson&#39;s interests, yet - <br/>
Yikes! But I&#39;m pretty sure at this point he wouldn&#39;t think to ask, <br/>
for the reasons Ren suggested. More for me to ponder.<br/>
