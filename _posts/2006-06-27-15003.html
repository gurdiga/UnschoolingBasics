<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950000942">My sister asked if we could watch her son for a week.  She is a <br/>
single mother, works and he is out of school for one week before <br/>
camp begins.  We live in neighboring states.  My ds is almost 6; his <br/>
cousin is turning 9 this week.  I understand and am empathetic to <br/>
why his cousin acts out.  He can be overly aggressive in his play <br/>
and he is sometimes even inappropriate when undressed. (I am not <br/>
sure but at times I wonder if he was sexually abused by one of his <br/>
older foster brothers years ago.  I explored the topic with his <br/>
mother but she has otehr explanations for his behavior.) <br/>
<br/>
We have really worked hard as a family to get our ds to try to use <br/>
his words rather than act out pshysically (hit, push,etc).  I talked <br/>
with our ds to see if he was interested in having his cousin come.  <br/>
He loves palying with this cousin and was definite that he wanted <br/>
him here.  When I tried to talk with ds about my concerns of his <br/>
cousin being too rough, my ds said that is his cousin, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
care.  (Our ds will alwasy minimize whenever he gets hurt <br/>
accidently: falls, bangs himself, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I am writing because I am finding it difficult to try to parent our <br/>
ds with an unschooling approach while having to make so many limtis <br/>
with this older, stronger, heavier, mroe aggressive and impulsive <br/>
child.  He doesn&#39;t respect limtis well and needs to be reminded <br/>
frequently.<br/>
<br/>
I need some suggestions about how to handle this.  This cousin will <br/>
be here until Thursday.  My son is already unhappy that he is <br/>
leaving and wants him to come back and stay over again.  Regardless <br/>
of this visit, this is my sister&#39;s child and we will have contact <br/>
with them in the future.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was molested by cousin(s) when he was a child.  We both <br/>
feel that we must watch them ALL the time.  We intervene when cousin <br/>
is being to threatening or rough which happens quite a bit during <br/>
the day.  Cousin initiates pushing him and then my ds gets caught up <br/>
in the &quot;game&quot;.  OUr ds continues to sleep in our bedroom at night so <br/>
they do sleep in different rooms in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me unschool in this situation.<br/>
