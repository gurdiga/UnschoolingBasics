<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784215093">&quot; Not all of the<br/>
radical unschoolers on this list started off as radical unschoolers. <br/>
Even Ren (shhhhh) had a child in public school for a while (gasp).  :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child, Trevor, went to Kindergarten. That was &#39;95/&#39;96 and<br/>
he&#39;s been home since.<br/>
<br/>
The harder part for me was not the unschooling, since we&#39;d slowly<br/>
moved that direction from early on. The hard part was the &quot;radical&quot;<br/>
end of it, the chores and unlimited television.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking questions to criticize anyone. I&#39;m asking them in hopes<br/>
that some of the same questions that were asked of me, will cause some<br/>
deep examination and shifts in thought. I hope, because I KNOW how<br/>
much happier families can be through these shifts. <br/>
I know how harmful coercion is to trust and relationships. I know how<br/>
beautiful unschooling unfolds when a person takes the leap and chooses<br/>
joy and living in the moment rather than fear.<br/>
<br/>
This list was created to help people not only understand what<br/>
unschooling is, but give tools, ideas and thoughts to help move<br/>
families towards radical unschooling. That&#39;s what we support here.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t possibly support both school/coercion AND unschooling. They<br/>
are opposites. There is no way to blend unschooling with<br/>
&quot;relaxed/eclectic&quot; because unschooling means NOT schooling.<br/>
Unschooling is about TRUST and if you aren&#39;t trusting your child, then<br/>
I just don&#39;t see how unschooling will blossom just yet. It&#39;s a<br/>
journey. One that will be greatly assisted by letting go of school and<br/>
schoolish methods, or the idea that children need to be made into<br/>
obedient beings.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us were &quot;relaxed/eclectic&quot; for many years and wish with all<br/>
our hearts we&#39;d trusted more. We&#39;re here to share why/how that trust<br/>
is vital and how much better learning can grow in your household with<br/>
that trust in place.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m taking all of this in and upon further examination, I don&#39;t<br/>
honestly believe that it is my children that I don&#39;t trust but myself.<br/>
There is a deep-rooted reason for that and I really want to focus on<br/>
over-coming that fear of trusting myself.  Even right now typing this,<br/>
I get upset because I feel so weak, so unsure, and I DO NOT want to<br/>
feel that way.  Coming here is helping, I want this, I desire this for<br/>
my family...I just need to trust myself.  Even more of a reason that I<br/>
need to do this ASAP is so that my kids can TRUST themselves as adults<br/>
to...see, I needed to write this out, I had to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Ren, you&#39;ve caused me to look even more deeply.  BTW...I<br/>
ordered two John Holt books this morning...&quot;Learning All the Time&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Instead of Education:  Ways to Help People Do Things Better&quot; and two<br/>
days ago I ordered &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170733606">once again, Ren, your responses are beautiful and truthful :)  thank<br/>
goodness it didn&#39;t take long for radical unschooling to unfold in our lives.<br/>
. and we&#39;re so much the happier for it.  DH still struggles with things here<br/>
and there but he&#39;s gotten better in a few short months.<br/>
<br/>
this group as well as one other radical unschooling yahoo group are a great<br/>
support for me... thanks<br/>
