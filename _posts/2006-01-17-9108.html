Index&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_14.htm">http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_14.htm</a>&gt;is out! How<br/>
free is YOUR state?<br/>
<br/>
This little report is more than simply a listing of which states keep out of<br/>
your business with regard to the school choices you make for your family -<br/>
it also shows how freedom and success correlate - in<br/>

the authors find that it correlates with better NAEP and SAT scores<br/>
- moreso than wealth, class size, spending per student and percent of<br/>
minority students COMBINED.<br/>
<br/>
It also has a ranking of freedom with regard to Availability of<br/>
Homeschooling Options&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_14_tables_7_and_8.htm">http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_14_tables_7_and_8.htm</a>&gt;.<br/>
I was disappointed in Illinois&#39; ranking - maybe we can get this turned<br/>
around somehow though...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The rankings are lame - done by people who clearly don&#39;t understand  <br/>
how homeschooling works IN those states.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m collecting information on how to UNschool in each state. If  <br/>
anybody here would like to write something up for any state NOT on  <br/>
the following list, I&#39;d really appreciate it. This is not just a  <br/>
question of what your laws are, but also about how unschoolers manage  <br/>
to meet the requirements or work around them or whatever they do.<br/>
<br/>
Also - everybody - send me a rating of how easy it is to unschool in  <br/>
your state -- 1 is the easiest, 10 is the most difficult.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE email me offlist at &lt;pamsoroosh @ earthlink.net&gt;.<br/>
