However  one of the great results of reading this list is it helps nervous<br/>
parents  to stop sliding down any slippery slope that may exist. It helps  us<br/>
recognize these residual school-thinks as they occur (like John  Holt&#39;s<br/>
&quot;devil teacher in me&quot; idea), and gradually they wither from neglect.  The<br/>
topics are just too broad after all because of connections. At some  point we<br/>
realize that &quot;What if they never get interested in geography (or  science)?&quot;<br/>
is a &quot;nonsense question&quot; in Unschooling, as unlikely an  occurrence as<br/>
someone who is Unschooling wanting to know &quot;How do you stop  them from being<br/>
interested in geography?&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Or spelling.<br/>
