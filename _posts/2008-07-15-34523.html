<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017073794">I know someone who spends the day in charge of four kids ages, 6, 5, 4, <br/>
and 3. This person seems to spend the majority of the day in a <br/>
different room than the kids with the door closed. The other day when I <br/>
was there one of the kids was in the corner.  When he was let out of <br/>
the corner he was told &quot;when someone tells you to do something you <br/>
don&#39;t tell them you don&#39;t have to listen to them you do what you&#39;re <br/>
told.&quot;  Turns out the 4 year old told the 5 year old not to run in the <br/>
house.  This is a house rule. I&#39;d love to hear what you all think about <br/>
all the above if you have time.  Thanks!</div>

what kind of feedback you&#39;re looking for. I don&#39;t leave my 14yo and <br/>
6yo together without some kind of support except on rare occasions <br/>
when I want to run to the store *and* the kids are amenable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have &quot;house rules&quot; per se, so there&#39;s not much to say. Its <br/>
the sort of situation that sets up power dynamics - kids vs kids and <br/>
kids vs adults. Radical unschooling is about moving away from those <br/>
kinds of dynamics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396428417">This mother is in trouble.  When we are unable to have compassion and <br/>
understanding for others, it is very likely that we didn&#39;t receive <br/>
compassion and understanding when we were young.  And, then, we are <br/>
unable to trust and develop anger and external ways of distancing.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a lot to undo what I&#39;m sure has been traumatic for this <br/>
mother, and she needs help.  It may be difficult for her to see this <br/>
because often our defenses and walls are so strong to in order to <br/>
strongly protect deep pain hidden from ourselves that it might be a <br/>
struggle for her to see it.  <br/>
<br/>
Just give her space and that will allow her the room to at least in <br/>
small ways just be herself.  That is the start and often the opening to <br/>
a new way through.<br/>
<br/>
Yours, Ruth</div>
