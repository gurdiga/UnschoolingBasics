<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127894667">Well, I finally convinced DH to go along with letting me pull DS (10)<br/>
from school now instead of waiting till the school year is over. Now<br/>
we&#39;re officially deschooling and taking a well-deserved vacation from<br/>
anything remotely academic. I&#39;m so thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
And, you may remember me posting about how to stop micromanaging<br/>
everything. It&#39;s been going great. I&#39;ve have backed WAY off and DS&#39;s<br/>
attitude is already improving. I told him that I was going to refrain<br/>
from making decisions for him unless it was a safety issue of<br/>
imperative  for some unusual reason. He didn&#39;t believe me. So a few<br/>
days later he decided he was going to cut his hair by himself. I<br/>
looked at him funny but said &quot;whatever you wanna do&quot;. He proceded to<br/>
cut a chunk of hair out, spazzed out for a second after realizing what<br/>
he had done, and then told me he was &quot;just testing me&quot; to see if I&#39;d<br/>
tell him he couldn&#39;t. That absolutely cracked me up. I guess he trusts<br/>
me now. Afterwards I gave him a new haircut (per his request) with<br/>
buzzed sides so that you can&#39;t see the missing chunk. So, on with our<br/>
unschooling adventure. Thanks for the advice.<br/>

We just started deschooling too. We had the exact same &quot;test&quot;. Last night at<br/>
11 my 15 yo (Deven) told my 5 yo (Jake) to go get the scissors and cut<br/>
his hair. All these horrible thoughts of ears being cut off flashed through<br/>
my mind but I bit my tongue. After a few min. of discussing hair styles,<br/>
Deven looked at me and asked if I would fix it. His face was priceless, a<br/>
little scared and a touch defiant. I told him I would in the morning but by<br/>
then he realized what could happen. My DH stepped in and told him he would<br/>
cut it for him, so at midnight my DH gave both boys a haircut. I was<br/>
suprised by this way of &quot;testing&quot; until I got up this a.m. and read your<br/>
message.  Do alot of boys test this way? For the week that we&#39;ve been<br/>
unschooling, I&#39;ve had more fun that the past 7 yrs of homeschooling.<br/>

that it could take on some fun colors.  How do you make a hair dye out of<br/>
kool-aid and how long does it last?  We thought about buying some colored<br/>

<br/>
I think that hair is one of those things that they can test with without it<br/>
being something completely permanent.  Hair grows out.  So even if they are<br/>
cutting it just to test their boundaries they subconsciously (at least) know<br/>
that it is a &quot;safe&quot; test.  It won&#39;t be 1mm, blue and/or weird for too long<br/>
:)  My girls have always been surprised at how easily I will allow them to<br/>
cut and color their hair.  Currently my middle child has black hair with<br/>
purple overtones.  She&#39;d been talking about coloring black for a long time<br/>
and when we found this &quot;midnight pomegranate&quot; (on clearance for $2 no less)<br/>
and I told her that I would help her color her hair she was so excited!<br/>
She&#39;s one of those fortunate people who can wear weird colors, odd<br/>
hairstyles and it all looks good on her.<br/>

for hair dye&quot;: (note - the beginning part talked about bleaching if <br/>
necessary for dark hair and red hair is very difficult to dye at all)<br/>
<br/>
Next you need to mix up the Kool Aid. Choose a color you like, the <br/>
brighter the better. Mix two packets of unsweetened mix with a <br/>
double quarter sized amount of conditioner. I cannot stress enough <br/>
that this must be unsweetened Kool Aid. If you use the sugar-added <br/>
type, your hair will be a mess. If you haven&#39;t bleached your hair <br/>
first, go wet it. Put on a pair of gloves and apply the Kool Aid to <br/>
your hair. If this is not enough to thickly coat the hair, mix up <br/>
some more and continue. Wrap your head in plastic wrap and leave it. <br/>
Leave it as long as you can stand it, all day if you can. The longer <br/>
you leave it, the better the color will adhere to the hair. <br/>
Over time, the color will fade out. If you want it out quicker, <br/>
toothpaste will speed up this process, but if you bleached the hair <br/>
or you have really light hair normally, it will not remove the color <br/>
totally. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I found that Manic Panic temporary type dye costs about $12 (I <br/>
looked on amazon and they had it!) There were some temporary hair <br/>
colorings I found at Rite Aid&#39;s website as well. iparty&#39;s website <br/>
has some inexpensive short term hair colorings (in the costume/make <br/>
up section) - comb in stuff and fluorescent hairspray colors that <br/>
run about $2-$4. Haven&#39;t tried anything yet though so I can&#39;t vouch <br/>
for how they work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650920702">Boy I wish I had known about the Kool-aid method last summer.  When <br/>
most of Jossilyn&#39;s(then 8) hair fell out after chemo it made her <br/>
look like a sick little old man.  It was thin and wispy and almost <br/>
white. We dyed it fuschia with what was supposed to be a permanent <br/>
hair dye that was meant for brunette hair.(cost about $11 at Rite <br/>
Aid)  It was VERY bright, VERY Jossilyn and absloutely fabulous--and <br/>
made her look much less ill which was what we wanted.  But it wasn&#39;t <br/>
very permanent, probably due to the chemo. The Kool-Aid would have <br/>
been much cheaper.  We ended up doing it twice between June and <br/>
August.  Then in August before we went to Boston for her BMT (bone <br/>
marrow transplant) we tried blue instead  (it didn&#39;t suit her as <br/>
well.)  But then TBI (total body irradiation) took the rest of her <br/>
hair so we did temporary tatoos and  my older daughter Kelsey (14) <br/>
did some henna designs for her. <br/>
<br/>
Hair has never been a big deal around here, so that has never been a <br/>
focus of testing for us.  <br/>

   <br/>
  It&#39;s the same for us -- with one exception, I&#39;ve always helped the kids do whatever they wanted for hairstyles.  Hair will grow out, no matter what you&#39;ve done to it, and the choice of look likely will change, too.<br/>
   <br/>
  My line is dreadlocks -- not because I don&#39;t like the look.  Whenever I see someone else with dreads, they just fascinate me.  But they smell like dirty hair, which I just can&#39;t tolerate in close spaces, like my car, so it would be really challenging for my kids to have smelly hair and go anywhere with me.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I do suggest shampoo when my children&#39;s hair smells too dirty, because the smell genuinely is a problem for me -- it&#39;s so distracting in the car I can&#39;t concentrate on anything else and it makes me grumpy that I feel ill just because someone else didn&#39;t wash his hair.  <br/>
