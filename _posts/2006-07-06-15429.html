<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236720679">Hello everybody, <br/>
<br/>
     So I checked the internet product specifications for my son&#39;s favorite<br/>
dinosaur chicken nuggets.  They are, in fact, fully pre-cooked. (!)  Thanks<br/>
for bringing this fact to my attention, and my level of culinary expertise<br/>
to this new all time high.   I&#39;ll feed them frozen to my son, with pleasure,<br/>
from now on.  That was easy.    <br/>
<br/>
     I stopped coercing my son to brush his teeth.  I offered to help him<br/>
each morning and evening for two days, and respected his wishes as he<br/>
politely declined to have them brushed.  On the third day, to my great<br/>
surprise (just as I was privately pondering how disgusting his mouth must<br/>
have been), he asked me, totally unprompted, to brush his teeth for him.<br/>
He then specified that he wants them brushed &quot;very slowly&quot;.  I asked him if<br/>
I had been brushing them too fast in the past and he said yes.   I promised<br/>
to do them slowly, and did.   Since then, I have been able to brush his<br/>
teeth each morning and evening, and we remind each other, to ease his<br/>
hesitation, that they should be brushed slowly.  It actually takes less time<br/>
now to brush them than in the past, if you include the pre-brushing struggle<br/>
we used to have with him.  <br/>
<br/>
     Thank you for all of your insightful responses, both practical and<br/>
conceptual.  I appreciate your perspectives and experience.  <br/>

Thanks so much for the update! My sons also love the dinosaur nuggest.  <br/>
My 5yo goes thru times where he likes his food cold.  I&#39;ve let him taste <br/>
the dino nuggets frozen, but he doesn&#39;t like them that hard.  Sometimes <br/>
I&#39;ll just keep some in the fridge so that he can have them cold without <br/>
breaking his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Way to go with the toothbrushing breakthrough!  You gave him some space, <br/>
and then he felt comfortable enough to tell you how he wants his teeth <br/>
brushed.  Hopefully he will start building more trust and any other <br/>
struggles can be resolved this easily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625499474">Thanks for giving us the good news, Carolyn. Sounds wonderful! AND -  <br/>
the best thing is that you&#39;ve set a pattern in place that will carry  <br/>
you throughout all his childhood and teen years. Amazing, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
