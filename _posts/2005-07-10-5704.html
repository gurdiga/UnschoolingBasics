<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405089437">Hi all...don&#39;t have much time, I&#39;m on a hotel computer with my kids <br/>
going stir crazy in the background, just wanted to let you all know <br/>
we&#39;re OK.:)<br/>
It&#39;s been a sleepless two nights, watching a Cat 4 heading towards <br/>
our house, but as it turns out, it&#39;s not as bad as Ivan in the end. <br/>
We know nothing of our house yet, but hoping a neighbor will call <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Johnson City Tn, looking at houses since we won&#39;t be staying <br/>
in Pensacola much longer. Found some nice unschoolers up here but <br/>
haven&#39;t met them irl yet.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to convince Markus that we need to stop in and say hi to <br/>
Ben and Kelly....it&#39;s looking like a good option right now since <br/>
Dennis might be dumping a load of rain up this way in the next few <br/>
days. Asheville is sounding nice too. Either way, I&#39;m in no hurry to <br/>
face Pensacola right now. Scrounging for ice, food and gas sounds <br/>
really lame.;( btdt.<br/>
<br/>
If our house is ok, I expect to stay here a couple more days, then <br/>
head slowly back.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for those of you that know about the Armstrongs (many <br/>
unschoolers pitched in and helped them out last year when they lost <br/>
their home) they are still living in a trailer in their <br/>
driveway...they hooked it up and drove up to St. Louis with their <br/>
pets and are enjoying 6 flags today I believe. So they&#39;ll be fine and <br/>
I don&#39;t think Dennis can make their house any worse than it already <br/>
was!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I think we dodged a big one this time. phew. Cross your fingers for <br/>
my house.<br/>
