<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836337296">Hi Cindy,<br/>
We have had a similar situation, the difference was their inablility to control their drinking & gun issues.  My oldest son (now 24) had a good friend in h.s. and went to his house to play alot until.............. I found the dad was not just having a beer after work but driving home drunk and drinking more when he got home.  I also found out he kept a loaded shot gun next to his bed.  Well you can bet the moment I found these well kept &quot;secrets&quot; my son wasnt allowed over there anymore.  His friend was welcome at my home anytime day or night.    Once I explained the safety reasons to my son he understood and made a point of having him over here more.   <br/>
About a month later his friend came over and said guess what &quot;mom&quot; ? my dad isnt drinking at home anymore.  Well the thing that got me was &quot;at home&quot;  which led me to believe he was still drinking somewhere else.  But all in all, my sons safety came first & I did what I could to give his friend a safe haven to escape to.  <br/>
I dont blame you for putting your childs safety first and foremost.  Hopefully the other family will see there are other ways of dealing with issues.  Don&#39;t give up, hopefully they&#39;ll come around and you & your childs presence will be a good influence on them.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

This is a very insightful article dealing with Bible Quotes and<br/>
Discipline from Chick Moorman and Thomas Haller&#39;s parent newsletter at<br/>
www.chickmoorman.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chickmoorman.com/">http://www.chickmoorman.com/</a>&gt; .<br/>
The first part is a question from one of their readers, followed by<br/>
Thomas&#39;s comments:<br/>
-----------<br/>
Dear Thomas, <br/>
I know you have a strong Christian background, having heard you preach a<br/>
few years ago. I have a question for you. <br/>
Like you and Chick, I do not believe in spanking either. But many of my<br/>
other Christian friends keep telling me about &quot;sparing the rod and<br/>
spoiling the child.&quot; Surely God doesn&#39;t want us to hit our children,<br/>
does He? I believe in a God of love. What do you make of all this? <br/>
Thanks in advance, <br/>
Beth Jerry <br/>
Saginaw, MI<br/>
Dear Beth, Lori, Unsigned, and others, <br/>
As you know, in our last parenting newsletter, Chick and I shared our<br/>
beliefs on spanking in the article, &quot;This Is Going to Hurt Me More Than<br/>
It Is Going to Hurt You.&quot; In it, we challenged the readers to examine a<br/>
widely accepted view of spanking from a different perspective. We<br/>
challenged conventional wisdom and asked parents to consider how hitting<br/>
children as a form of discipline may actually be hurting the parent in<br/>
ways they were previously unaware of. <br/>
We greatly appreciate your willingness to share your comments with us as<br/>
you examine your own parenting style and are challenged by different<br/>
views on raising responsible, caring, confident children. While it is<br/>
not our desire to tell you how to parent your children, we do want to<br/>
provide readers with techniques and strategies for raising children with<br/>
grace, integrity, and love. <br/>
Since you asked, my personal thoughts about the Biblical issue follow. <br/>
As an ordained minister I spent 8 years learning the Hebrew and Greek<br/>
language so as to study the Bible in its original language. Since that<br/>
time, almost 20 years ago, I have spent many laboring hours preparing<br/>
sermons and writing Bible studies on topics of marriage, love, money,<br/>
miracles, gifts of the Spirit, parenting, and most importantly the Grace<br/>
of God as seen through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It was with<br/>
great respect for the scriptures that I undertook a call to raise the<br/>
consciousness of parents throughout the world. It is with this same<br/>
respect and conviction that I offer a look at a Biblical perspective on<br/>
spanking. <br/>
Christian parents frequently seek the Bible in their effort to raise<br/>
godly children. They believe that there is a biblical mandate to spank<br/>
and they fear that if they don&#39;t spank, they will commit the sin of<br/>
losing control of their child. They believe that God has commended them<br/>
to spank and they take &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; literally. In<br/>
doing so they misunderstand the concept of the rod. The following are<br/>
the biblical verses which have caused the greatest confusion: <br/>
&quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to<br/>
discipline him.&quot; (Proverbs 13:24) <br/>
&quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child. But the rod of discipline<br/>
will drive it far from him.&quot; (Proverbs 22:15) <br/>
&quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod<br/>
he will not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death.&quot;<br/>
(Proverbs 23:13-14) <br/>
&quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to itself<br/>
disgraces his mother.&quot; (Proverbs 29:15) <br/>
At first glance these verses seem to be in strong support of the use of<br/>
corporal punishment. But are they really? A closer examination of the<br/>
Hebrew word for &quot;rod&quot; (shebet) sheds more light on the subject. In the<br/>
Hebrew dictionary &quot;rod&quot; has various meanings: a stick for walking,<br/>
writing, fighting, ruling, and punishment. The word &quot;shebet&quot; is most<br/>
frequently used when referring to shepherds who are tending their<br/>
flocks. The shepherds used the stick to fight off predators and to<br/>
gently guide wandering sheep, not strike them for being out of line. <br/>
The verses that contain this material were written in poetic form.<br/>
Writers of poetry typically use familiar words of the day to represent<br/>
concepts and create imagery of what they are writing about. The &quot;rod&quot;<br/>
can as easily be interpreted as a gentle guide as it can a stick for<br/>
hitting children. <br/>
The image that I believe we are to extract from these verses in Proverbs<br/>
is one of creating a culture of accountability in our families. The<br/>
point that God is making here is that we as parents are to hold our<br/>
children accountable for their choices and actions. That is His desire. <br/>
There are many ways to hold a child accountable, and corporal punishment<br/>
(spanking) does not have to be one of them. <br/>
Reread the passages above and replace the references to punishment and<br/>
the use of the rod with the word &quot;accountability&quot; and notice what<br/>
happens. <br/>
For example: <br/>
Proverbs 13:24 would read, &quot;He who spares accountability hates his son,<br/>
but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.&quot; <br/>
Proverbs 22:15 would read, &quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child.<br/>
But holding him accountable will drive it far from him.&quot; <br/>
Proverbs 23:13-14 would read, &quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child;<br/>
if you create a culture of accountability he will not die. Create<br/>
accountability and save his soul from death.&quot; <br/>
Proverbs 29:15 would read, &quot;The culture of accountability imparts<br/>
wisdom, but a child left to itself disgraces his mother.&quot; <br/>
As Christians, we believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God.<br/>
Yet some Christians hold fast to interpreting the &quot;rod&quot; in the Proverbs<br/>
passages as a mandate to spank. They interpret the passages written many<br/>
years ago in the language of the time with today&#39;s words and context.<br/>
They take the passages literally, staunchly claiming that that&#39;s what<br/>
the Bible says. <br/>
But what about these passages? <br/>
&quot;Anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death.&quot;<br/>
(Exodus 21:15) <br/>
&quot;If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has<br/>
cursed his father or his mother, and his blood will be on his own head.&quot;<br/>
(Leviticus 20:9) <br/>
Almost every parent would admit that their child has said, &quot;I hate you,&quot;<br/>
or &quot;You&#39;re not the boss of me,&quot; at one time or another. But no one<br/>
argues that their child should be put to death in these cases. <br/>
No, children don&#39;t need to be put to death and they don&#39;t need to be<br/>
spanked either. They do need to be held accountable for their actions<br/>
and choices, however. The Bible simply does not support spanking. It<br/>
supports holding children accountable. It says, &quot;Train a child in the<br/>
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;<br/>
(Proverbs 22:6) &quot;Training&quot; does not mean spanking, hitting, or any other<br/>
form of corporal punishment. <br/>
Chick and I believe that creating a culture of accountability is the<br/>
most loving thing you can do for your children. We believe in holding<br/>
children accountable within a model that Jesus gave us. In the New<br/>
Testament Jesus modified the Old Testament by providing us with a model<br/>
of gentleness and love. He changed the eye-for-an-eye approach and<br/>
called for turning the other cheek and forgiving seven times seventy. <br/>
Consider these inspired words of God in your parenting: <br/>
&quot;Fathers do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the<br/>
training and instruction of the Lord.&quot; (Ephesians 6:4) <br/>
&quot;Fathers do not embitter your children, or they will become<br/>
discouraged.&quot; (Colossians 3:21) <br/>
&quot;What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love with a<br/>
gentle spirit?&quot; (Corinthians 4:21). <br/>
Become an enlightened parent, one who is moved and inspired by the word<br/>
of God that calls for grace, gentleness, forgiveness, and love in all<br/>
that you do. Challenge yourself to create a Christ-like approach to<br/>
parenting. Seek strategies and techniques that enable you to parent to<br/>
the soul of your child. <br/>
Refrain from using the Bible as an excuse to spank. Use it instead to<br/>
help you create a higher vision of yourself as a parent and to become<br/>
the parent you always wanted to be. <br/>
Warmest regards, <br/>
Thomas Haller <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990416880">I sent the question to an unschooling mom on another list.  She is a  member <br/>
of an evangelical church and does a great job of balancing her religious  <br/>
beliefs with unschooling-style parenting.  She gives great advise to those  that <br/>
are dealing with these sometimes conflicting ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are her thoughts....<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Well the thing is, even if it is morally reprehensible<br/>
to many of us,  spanking, even with a switch or &quot;rod&quot;,<br/>
isn&#39;t illegal in *any* state, and  doesn&#39;t fall under<br/>
the legal category of abuse.  It is even still  legal<br/>
in 22 states for school officials (principals,<br/>
teachers, etc.) to  paddle students.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I used to spank my kids, and  now<br/>
firmly believe that spanking is useless as a form of<br/>
discipline and is  totally wrong, and it was<br/>
discussions on unschooling.com and other  unschooling<br/>
lists that helped me see it for what it was...a sorry<br/>
attempt  to make my children conform to my needs of the<br/>
moment or to assuage my own  embarrassment at their<br/>
&quot;unacceptable&quot; behavior, and need for approval  from<br/>
other parents that I was &quot;training&quot; my children.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t  think she needs to worry about the<br/>
safety of her 14yo.  A 14yo should be  able to<br/>
understand that if he witnesses something that makes<br/>
him  uncomfortable in their home, he can come home and<br/>
talk to his mother or  father about it.  He should also<br/>
understand that if anyone ever tried to  harm him<br/>
physically, he is legally allowed to defend himself,<br/>
so I  wouldn&#39;t worry about those people spanking him!<br/>
<br/>
As always, our children  are going to interact with<br/>
people who think and act differently than we do,  and<br/>
it is through discussing this with them and helping<br/>
them to understand  and process what they see and hear<br/>
and do that they will form their own view  of the<br/>
world.  So, lots of discussions with him, and then at<br/>
14 I  think he is old enough to decide whether or not<br/>
he wants to hang out at their  home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742214299">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My child and this other child are still friends.  I have tried to <br/>
have him over numerous times since the discussion, but they always <br/>
decline.  They have however invited my child over, but I&#39;m not <br/>
feeling too comfortable with this idea. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have read some replies and evidently people know that your ds is 14,<br/>
although that is not mentioned here. I think that age/maturity does make a<br/>
difference. <br/>
<br/>
My dd is 5.5 and I don&#39;t let her go to our neighbors home, because of the<br/>
way they are there which includes endless time outing, shouting, lack of<br/>
empathy for the kids&#39; various feelings, ear grabbing, and an atmosphere of<br/>
constant competitive conflict. The two of them compete for everyone&#39;s<br/>
attention, including Jayn&#39;s. It is awful just to be outside by the pool with<br/>
them let alone in a small room playing. Plus the girl has a history of<br/>
attempting to touch Jayn&#39;s private parts, so I feel no compunction<br/>
whatsoever in just not letting her go there, but having the kids visit here<br/>
- one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t trust that the kids would freely allow Jayn to leave if she<br/>
became uncomfortable for any reason. <br/>
<br/>
I have another thought about this, which would apply to any aged child.<br/>
Beyond the atmosphere of coercion and the likely controls on behavior, my<br/>
concern would be the likelihood of attempts to witness to or &quot;save&quot; your ds.<br/>
That may be why they persist in inviting him over to their home. I don&#39;t<br/>
want people witnessing to Jayn at this point. I would have a hard time<br/>
leaving her in such a home.<br/>

&gt; isn&#39;t illegal in *any* state, and  doesn&#39;t fall under<br/>
&gt; the legal category of abuse.  It is even still  legal<br/>
&gt; in 22 states for school officials (principals,<br/>
&gt; teachers, etc.) to  paddle students.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that is true.  I had a discussion with a child psychologist a <br/>
few years back and the subject of spanking came up.  At least in the State of <br/>
Maine, this pyschologist says that DHS views anything other than an open palm <br/>
on the bottom to be considered as child abuse.  I would like to see where she <br/>
got this information.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t  think she needs to worry about the<br/>
safety of her 14yo.  A 14yo should be  able to<br/>
understand that if he witnesses something that makes<br/>
him  uncomfortable in their home, he can come home and<br/>
talk to his mother or  father about it.  He should also<br/>
understand that if anyone ever tried to  harm him<br/>
physically, he is legally allowed to defend himself,<br/>
so I  wouldn&#39;t worry about those people spanking him!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so much worried about him being physically abused as witnessing such <br/>
a thing and having to deal with the trauma of an adult trying to hurt him.  If <br/>
these parents were pedophiles no one would think my son should be in their <br/>
home just because he&#39;s big enough to fight back.  To me physical abuse is <br/>
something as horrible as sexual abuse.<br/>
<br/>
As always, our children  are going to interact with<br/>
people who think and act differently than we do,  and<br/>
it is through discussing this with them and helping<br/>
them to understand  and process what they see and hear<br/>
and do that they will form their own view  of the<br/>
world.  So, lots of discussions with him, and then at<br/>
14 I  think he is old enough to decide whether or not<br/>
he wants to hang out at their  home.<br/>
<br/>
Ethan interacts with people that have very different beliefs than he does.  <br/>
Even in our own family (myself and youngest son are vegetarians and he is not <br/>
:), he is so much more of an environmentalist than I am--things that I don&#39;t <br/>
find objectionable he does, we have friends that run the gammet from Christians <br/>
to Pagans, friends who are main stream and others who are environmentalist and <br/>
back to the earth types,etc, etc.)  We have had many discussions.  Ethan is <br/>
worried also about the abuse, but very much wants to continue being friends <br/>
with the boy. I want him to remain friends with this boy, also, because it makes <br/>
Ethan happy. We were just trying to find something that would make everyone <br/>
happy and safe.<br/>
<br/>

I too have had such concerns.  There have been several times that they have <br/>
invited him to their church.  Ethan has always politely declined the <br/>
invitations, but they keep after him about it.  I, also, get the feeling that because I <br/>
disagree with spanking that they feel I am a bad influence for their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141855208">***This is exactly one of the reasoning points I had with the<br/>
homeschooling <br/>
group and this mother in particular and they came back with all kinds of<br/>
stuff <br/>
from Dr. Dobson  and that I was twisting scripture.  Like I said they<br/>
were not in <br/>
the least bit willing to be reasonable.*** <br/>
<br/>
Cindy:<br/>
 <br/>
This can be so frustrating.  It&#39;s true that anyone can twist scripture<br/>
to support pretty much any view.  I&#39;d be curious to know how they<br/>
translate the scripture from the article I sent that pretty much says<br/>
you should kill your child if he back talks. <br/>
 <br/>
I remember reading Dobson early on in motherhood. It made me physically<br/>
ill.  I seriously contemplated *loosing* the copy I got from the library<br/>
so that other unsuspecting parents wouldn&#39;t get to it.  Of course that<br/>
would be censorship, so I grudgingly took it back. <br/>
 <br/>
I try to approach others proselytizing to my children the same way I<br/>
approach any subject from an unschooling perspective - with trust that<br/>
my sons will make the decisions that will serve them in their lives.  I<br/>
have a great example of this in my own life with regard to religious.  I<br/>
grew up in a very conservative Christian rural area.  I was always<br/>
interested in religion and church.  My mother was not conservative at<br/>
all, but was very supportive of me finding my own way.  I lived on a<br/>
ranch about 20 miles from the nearest small town.  Every so often a<br/>
church bus would drive out to pick me up and take me to the church I was<br/>
most curious about at the moment.  I was proselytized by every church in<br/>
the area.  Our public school would even let kids out of school to go to<br/>
the Baptist tent revival!  My mom would just share her views, but not<br/>
make a big deal out of my exploring.  I think because she was so willing<br/>
to let me explore that I turned out having a very healthy view of<br/>
spirituality and am now comfortable in my views and spiritual practice.<br/>
As a matter of fact, I finally landed on a religion that my mother<br/>
introduced me to when I was about 17 years old.  That&#39;s actually a<br/>
really good reminder that my values do carry weight with my kids. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for creating the opportunity for this conversation.<br/>

<br/>
Before you found out the other mom spanks did your son go to their house?<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
If he was visiting his friend before you understood what the friend&#39;s<br/>
home life was like did he ever mention to you that the parents spanked or<br/>
otherwise punished the kids in his presence? <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s been going and if he hasn&#39;t personally witnessed the parents<br/>
assaulting their kids it&#39;s not likely they&#39;ll start smacking their kids<br/>
around in front of him now that you know.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is fourteen and could leave their house if he was uncomfortable,<br/>
right?  He could call you or walk home?<br/>
<br/>
Your non-spanked kid might be a deterrent to spanking for those parents. <br/>
The mom knows how you feel, knows your kids don&#39;t get treated that way,<br/>
knows your son will likely talk to you about his experience at their<br/>
house.   <br/>
<br/>
How does your son feel about going to their house?  If he feels ok with<br/>
it, and if he can leave if he needs to, then I don&#39;t see why he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
go.   They are not likely to hit your child.  Creepy as it is, it&#39;s legal<br/>
to hit our own precious kids but not legal to hit anyone else.   <br/>
<br/>
Outings in neutral places might be good if you can talk to that mom long<br/>
enough to get her to agree, but if you can&#39;t and she still resists<br/>
letting her kid come to your house, then the options for your son are<br/>
smaller.  And if you are ultimately the thing standing in the way of<br/>
seeing his friend (even if he says he understands your reasoning) that<br/>
won&#39;t do either of you any good.   Putting a barrier between your son and<br/>
the other child might be just as upsetting or traumatizing to your son as<br/>
if he were to witness those parents yelling at or spanking a kid. <br/>
<br/>
Find out what your son wants to do.  <br/>

you really think they&#39;d let him if they are this type of person?<br/>

<br/>
Ethan has only been over twice with out me or with a group of people.  Mostly <br/>
the boy was coming to our house, until they found out I didn&#39;t believe in <br/>
spanking.<br/>
<br/>
 How does your son feel about going to their house?  <br/>
<br/>
As I stated in another post, he is really concerned about it, too.  He does <br/>
want to remain friends with this boy.  He&#39;s kind of afraid what he might do if <br/>
he saw his friend or friends siblings being hit (and we are not talking a slap <br/>
on the bottom--we are talking beating with a stick).  It outrages him.  He <br/>
does feel that their friendship will be limited if he doesn&#39;t go over though. <br/>
<br/>
 Putting a barrier between your son and<br/>
the other child might be just as upsetting or traumatizing to your son as<br/>
if he were to witness those parents yelling at or spanking a kid. <br/>
<br/>
I guess you didn&#39;t read the posts very thoroughly.  We are not refering to <br/>
regular spankings (all though that would make me nervous) or yelling--it&#39;s <br/>
beatings with a stick other wise known as assault and battery. Have you ever seen <br/>
anyone beat?  I have.  I witnessed it daily as a child.  It fosters feelings of <br/>
guilt, deep anger, and fear.  Deb, what would you say about all of this if <br/>
these people had admitted that they fondle their children, but we had never seen <br/>
it happen.  Would you think I should put him in that dangerous situation.  I <br/>
doubt it very much.  Sexual abuse is no worse than physical and mental abuse.  <br/>
I know!  I can tell you for sure that being concerned for his safety will not <br/>
be as traumatizing (if at all) as it would be to see someone he cares about <br/>
being beat.  One of a parents responsibilities is to protect their children.  <br/>
It&#39;s the most natural thing in the world--ie.  mother bears, birds who pretend <br/>
to be hurt so the predator will come after them instead of their young, etc.  <br/>
Of course, I have discussed this with my son.  I just merely wanted some <br/>
suggestions of how to keep him safe and not ruin his friendship.  I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
keep these two seperated, just safe.<br/>

OK, so you really want to not allow your son to visit these people anymore.  That is very much your choice, your call.  You posted asking for input and people gave it.  Apparently, we were simply supposed to agree with you and tell you what a great mom you are and be aghast at these other people.  You know your son best, the situation best, do what feels right to you.  But if you ask for input, the chance of everyone agreeing with you on any issue is small.<br/>

There&#39;s no gentle way to hit another person, especially one who is smaller and less powerful than the hitter.  Maybe the spankers I&#39;ve come across aren&#39;t &#39;typical christians&#39; but I&#39;ve found that most of them do hit with something (belt, paddle, etc) and that they certainly will threaten a spanking in moments of anger.  Besides, how sick is it to hit someone once you&#39;ve calmed down and the anger has passed?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>        This idea of spanking &quot;gently and without anger&quot; makes my blood<br/>
run <br/>
        even colder than the idea of spanking in anger.<br/>
        Those poor children.  I think we have *everything* to worry<br/>
about.<br/>

I meant the boy who is visiting his friend does not have anything to<br/>
worry about himself.  Meaning, its not likely the parents are going to<br/>
hit him.  His spanked friend is a whole other story.<br/>
<br/>
I went to a Homeschool open house and book sale yesterday here in<br/>
Florida, with tables set up for different vendors, and 2 speakers, one<br/>
of which got up and spoke about the bible and how to spank, and was even<br/>
selling her book which comes with a wooden paddle.  I was seated in the<br/>
audience and just kept looking around at others as if to say, &quot;is this<br/>
woman serious or am I on candid camera?&quot;.  I got up and left.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198984295">***We live in a very rural area--his friend lives 1/2 hour away by car.<br/>
He could <br/>
walk but it would take a very long time to get home.  He could call, but<br/>
do <br/>
you really think they&#39;d let him if they are this type of person?***<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be unlikely they&#39;d interfere with him calling you.  <br/>
If he had a cell phone they wouldn&#39;t even know he called.  <br/>
<br/>
***he is really concerned about it, too.  He does <br/>
want to remain friends with this boy.  He&#39;s kind of afraid what he might<br/>
do if <br/>
he saw his friend or friends siblings being hit (and we are not talking a<br/>
slap <br/>
on the bottom--we are talking beating with a stick).  It outrages him.  <br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
So, you scared and riled him about this mom and now he&#39;s thinking of ways<br/>
he can fight back?  That probably wasn&#39;t the kindest thing you could have<br/>
done for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of people hit their kids.  Lots.  Your doctor might have hit her<br/>
kids, your vet, your letter carrier.  You just don&#39;t know and if you&#39;re<br/>
going to declare war on everyone who has or is your son&#39;s world will be<br/>
getting smaller instead of bigger. <br/>
<br/>
Why did you feel you had to tell him about his friends mom?   To warn him<br/>
in case something happened at their house?   Are you going to warn him<br/>
against the possibility that at any friends house or at any moment in<br/>
public he might witness a child/parent interaction that&#39;s less than<br/>
ideal?   Creating fear and suspicion in him won&#39;t help him have<br/>
friendships.   <br/>
<br/>
***He does feel that their friendship will be limited if he doesn&#39;t go<br/>
over though.***<br/>
<br/>
So, he wants to go.  But now he&#39;ll go, looking for a reason to be angry<br/>
at that mom, with the possibility of tension between him and his friend.<br/>
<br/>
***I guess you didn&#39;t read the posts very thoroughly. ***<br/>
<br/>
What I read was that from an e-mail conversation you found out this mom<br/>
is like millions of moms out there who spank their kids, and yes, even<br/>
use a stick.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written many times about spanking and I believe even one open handed<br/>
swat on the behind is assault.  I believe this because if I hit any adult<br/>
that way they could press charges against me.   My son was never spanked<br/>
or punished in any way and like you I believe hitting another person,<br/>
especially our own kids, is abuse. <br/>
<br/>
But from what you read about her spanking you&#39;ve concluded she&#39;s a raging<br/>
out of control lunatic who might go off at any minute and beat her<br/>
children in front of your son and maybe even beat your kid too.   I think<br/>
that&#39;s unlikely. <br/>
<br/>
***Deb, what would you say about all of this if <br/>
these people had admitted that they fondle their children, but we had<br/>
never seen <br/>
it happen.***<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t.  She admitted to a legal and widely accepted practice that<br/>
our society is so comfortable with they call it &quot;parenting.&quot;   Equating<br/>
her bad choice/ignorance to spank with deviancy is not going to help you<br/>
think about this rationally.  Creating a wild scenario is not a good<br/>
practice and won&#39;t do anything to help your son maintain this friendship.<br/>
 That is your goal, right?  Typically parents who hit their kids do not<br/>
do so under the watchful eye of house guests and do not randomly hit<br/>
house guests/other people&#39;s children.  <br/>
<br/>
***I can tell you for sure that being concerned for his safety will not <br/>
be as traumatizing ***<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t write that being concerned for his safety would traumatize him. <br/>
I said being a barrier to this friends could.  Being a barrier to his<br/>
exploration of the world and his own good judgement could.   You are<br/>
trying to protect him from your fear, not from any situation that has<br/>
actually happened to or is likely to happen to your son.   <br/>
<br/>
Since you live so far from the other kid is part of the reason his mom<br/>
isn&#39;t letting him come to your house that she has little kids and can&#39;t<br/>
give her older kid a ride?  Have you offered to go pick him up?  Maybe<br/>
that will help. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you just drove over there with your son and said, &quot;Can Bobby<br/>
come with us to the music store?&quot; or some such she&#39;d be less rigid, face<br/>
to face.  Take her a pie.   Have the whole family over for dinner or game<br/>
night.   Bridge the gap that was created out of your e-mail discussion if<br/>
you can.  Seeing the family in person, seeing the family dynamic might<br/>
ease your fears some, too.  It would be a nice thing to do for your son. <br/>

 <br/>
Not necessarily.  An unschooler I know had some friends from her  church <br/>
watch her kids for a few hours.  When she got back, one of her  children had been <br/>
spanked severely, to put it mildly.<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to think that all people would treat my children decently, but  <br/>
unfortunately that isn&#39;t always true.    And it has nothing to do  with <br/>

spank their children.  We aren&#39;t talking about a parenting  style we just <br/>
don&#39;t agree with.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is a really tough situation and I would put the safety of the child  <br/>
first, both mental and physical.  The details can be discussed and sorted  out <br/>
from there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498249834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Typically, Christians who spank do so gently and without anger.  I <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; ****<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no gentle way to hit another person, especially one who is <br/>
&gt; smaller and less powerful than the hitter.  Maybe the spankers <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve come across aren&#39;t &#39;typical christians&#39; but I&#39;ve found that <br/>
&gt; most of them do hit with something (belt, paddle, etc) and that <br/>
&gt; they certainly will threaten a spanking in moments of anger.  <br/>
&gt; Besides, how sick is it to hit someone once you&#39;ve calmed down and <br/>
&gt; the anger has passed?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a conscious parenting decision.  It&#39;s something that many are <br/>
tought and believe to be best.  It&#39;s what the person knows and <br/>
belives to be good and necessary for their family.  Trust me...there <br/>
are differnt levels to this.  I&#39;ve witnesses many.  Spanking with <br/>
purpose is not considered abuse.  Beating a child uncontrollably for <br/>
the heck of it or out of anger and frustration could easily be <br/>
considered abuse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confused about something...isn&#39;t spanking a philisophical <br/>
difference in beliefs?  I don&#39;t know about everyone else here, but <br/>
in my everyday life I&#39;m surrounded by people from all walks of <br/>
life.  I wouldn&#39;t dream of staying away from someone just because I <br/>
disagreed with their belief in spanking.  We all come from differnt <br/>
places, and we are ALL in different spots in our walk through life.  <br/>
What one person may find morally reprehensible may be perfectly <br/>
normal to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
What about the person that&#39;s a hunter?  They kill animals on a <br/>
regular basis.  We may not agree with that lifestyle, but we&#39;re not <br/>
going to keep our children and animals away from them.  What about <br/>
the person that is in a career that damages the environment in some <br/>
way?  Are we going to not speak to them.  This can be taken in many <br/>
directions.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting to the point that I just detest public school.  It makes <br/>
my stomach go in knots when I hear about children having to be <br/>
locked up in a room, some without windows, all day long.  It&#39;s part <br/>
of society.  It&#39;s what we are raised to do.  Unless something <br/>
happens to change our minds and our circumstances that is the <br/>
lifestyle we lead.  It&#39;s the same with spanking.  It&#39;s the same with <br/>
immunizations.  It&#39;s the same with food choices.  It&#39;s the same with <br/>
everything we do that effects our lives and the lives of our <br/>
families.  <br/>
<br/>
All of are not blessed to know kind and gentle parenting before <br/>
we&#39;ve had our babies.  Some of us have to arrive there.  Some of us <br/>
never will.  I&#39;d have to say that I know way more people that <br/>
parent &quot;main stream&quot; than embrace the unschool philosophy.  Even for <br/>
those of us that come to unschooling it&#39;s the unschooling in <br/>
relation to everything school that comes first.  The parenting is <br/>
more of a biproduct of the choice to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that we are in a vast society filled with many different <br/>
types of people and belief systems.  I believe one benefit of <br/>
unschooling is that we learn how to co-exist and interact with all <br/>
different types of people.  We are not self-limiting in who we can <br/>
associate with.  It is very possible that someone who believes in <br/>
spanking may disagree with our decision to unschool and find it <br/>
equally reprehensible that we are willing to &quot;damage&quot; our children <br/>
in such a way.  We do what we know to be good and true at whatever <br/>
point we are at.  We can only do what we know.  Period.<br/>
<br/>
Since when have we needed to worry about whether someone that <br/>
believes in spanking (no matter how they believe in it) is going to <br/>
be a physical threat to our children, especially at the age of 14 <br/>
years?  Most people that believe in spanking don&#39;t even spank <br/>
children of that age.  Also, it is very unusual for anyone who <br/>
spanks their children to spank anyone else&#39;s children without prior <br/>
permission.  In my personal opinion this seems to be a bit of an <br/>
over reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is just my personal opinion on this type of situation.  <br/>
It is not directed at anyone in particular.  Just my opinion on the <br/>
subject at hand.<br/>

**********************<br/>
<br/>
Yes my &quot;religious&quot; ( I use the term loosely and please don&#39;t anyone think I mean Christian cos the way they behaved was far from it) parents believed in belting and did so to my children without my knowledge or consent. They  know I don&#39;t hit them and deliberately used their power over my children to try and &quot;make them tow the line.&quot; when they had them round. Two were non verbal and autistic  and I only found out the extent to what was going on last  year.  I have not spoken to them or let them near the children since. They still - I have found out from other family  members - cannot understand what all the fuss is about. They just don&#39;t see it was wrong and never will.My youngest had nightmares over the way they treated him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230185295">We too switched to using only cell phones and cancelled our home <br/>
phones.  I have twin daughters who are 17.  When we decided to get them <br/>
a phone we checked and compared prices and found the best price for us <br/>
as a family was through Cingular.  We have to pay 69.99 for the main <br/>
phone and then 10.00 for each phone after that so we pay 125.00 a month <br/>
for 4 phones once you add in taxes, etc.  We share 1500 minutes between <br/>
us but we have free mobile-to-mobile, free long distance, free nights <br/>
(9:00 pm-6:am) & weekends so it is worth it for us to always be in <br/>
contact with one another.  One of my daughter&#39;s has a boyfriend who just <br/>
transferred to California...we are in FL and due to the time differences <br/>
from there to here she talks to him after 9:00 every evening and they <br/>
can talk for hours and there is no charge.  When we get our bill in the <br/>
mail we have 15-17 pages of phone numbers dialed to and from all of our <br/>
phones but we NEVER use all the minutes since we are calling other cell <br/>
phones within Cingular&#39;s plan or each other or during free times.  The <br/>
$125.00 may sound like a lot but for us it has been a lifesaver since we <br/>
all have our own phone now and can be reached at any time of day or <br/>
night.  Our home phone bill ran 50.00-60.00 a month easily and there was <br/>
&quot;arguing&quot; over who needed to use the phone, not answering call-waiting <br/>
calls, having to wait around the house for a call, etc.  My 9-yr-old <br/>
keeps asking when he is going to get a phone!! LOL, I told him as soon <br/>
as he was a teenager and started doing stuff away from us (he is ALWAYS <br/>
with us!)<br/>
