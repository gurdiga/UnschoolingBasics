<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518640956">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group.  I homeschool my three children using the <br/>
Charlotte Mason method but I am very interested in learning more <br/>
about unschooling and may possibly start trying to implement this in <br/>
our home. Anyone familiar with the Charlotte Mason Method?  I was <br/>
wondering if I could some how implement both.  With the Charlotte <br/>
Mason method we do nature, narrations after reading, listen to folk, <br/>
hymn, and classical music, picture study, short lessons, and we read <br/>
from real books instead of textbooks.  I was thinking that I could <br/>
do unschooling and try to incorporate some of the aspects of <br/>
Charlotte Mason into our daily routine such as the following:  <br/>
Playing classical music in the backgroud while during different <br/>
things, going on nature walks, keeping real living books around-<br/>
without telling they must read them but having them available, <br/>
Showing them a picture-taking it away- and telling them to tell me <br/>
about it, having a read aloud time with my family, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a typical day like for the unschooling family?<br/>
<br/>
Your responses will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</div>

A couple of questions first.<br/>
<br/>
WHY are you interested in unschooling? Especially if you&#39;re happy with <br/>
Charlotte Mason?<br/>
<br/>
What do you feel you would gain from unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
What is your goal for your daughter?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basics? Trust. Patience. Respect. Generosity. Kindness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751984786">admittedly, i know nothing about charlotte mason, but from your description,<br/>
it sounds basically like unschooling, except for the lesson part, and if the<br/>
other stuff you mentioned is really regimented.  ???<br/>

&quot;Years ago I recognized my kinship with all living things, and I made up my<br/>
mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on the earth. I said<br/>
then and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it; while<br/>
there is a criminal element, I am of it; while there is a soul in prison, I<br/>
am not free.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404788213">~~I was thinking that I could<br/>
do unschooling and try to incorporate some of the aspects of<br/>
Charlotte Mason into our daily routine such as the following:<br/>
Playing classical music in the backgroud while during different<br/>
things, going on nature walks, keeping real living books around-<br/>
without telling they must read them but having them available,<br/>
Showing them a picture-taking it away- and telling them to tell me<br/>
about it, having a read aloud time with my family, etc.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the stumbling blocks I see:<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with playing classical music in the background,<br/>
if that&#39;s what you all like, but if you&#39;re valuing that style of music<br/>
above Rock-n-roll, bluegrass, folk, reggae or any other style of<br/>
music, then you&#39;re limiting your world. Unschooling is about expanding<br/>
our world.<br/>
<br/>
Classical music isn&#39;t inherently better than any other style of music,<br/>
nor does it lead to more/better learning experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Nature walks are great, if they&#39;re allowed to be enjoyed by each<br/>
person rather than turned into some kind of &quot;lesson&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If someone showed me a picture and took it away, asking me to tell<br/>
them about it, I&#39;d be really annoyed. Unschooling is all about<br/>
authentic interactions. If moments are contrived in order to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
or get information into our children that WE think is important, we<br/>
miss the more important things that THEY think are important.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get to unschooling, take a deep breathe and realize<br/>
that Charlotte Mason was one person, with her own ideas and prejudices<br/>
about what is proper and good to learn. She had some great ideas too.<br/>
The problem I see with any learning method that places certain<br/>
activities as more valuable, is it misses the point that the child<br/>
right in front of us has their own interests that may or may not<br/>
coincide with that method.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing for me is to assist my children in exploring<br/>
the world in their own way. The Charlotte Mason ideas appealed to me,<br/>
but my video-game loving children have their own ideas!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301218052">We started out with CM over 5 years ago and gently evolved into unschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
I am still passionate about CM and her views about children. She felt they <br/>
were capable of much more than people thought, at a time when the mentality was <br/>
*children were to be seen and not heard*.  <br/>
 <br/>
She always said &quot;expose them to everything, even things (typically thought) <br/>
beyond them, and they will take from it what they will...and make their own <br/>
connections.&quot;   She respected children...the essence of unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
So expose your children to everything....books ..art ..nature <br/>
..music..handicrafts etc  ... create that rich enviroment, BUT don&#39;t have daily lessons or a <br/>
daily routine. For instance don&#39;t *require* a narration after your child reads <br/>
a book, but you might find yourself just chatting * together* about the book <br/>
*IF* your child *wants* to.  Don&#39;t *require* daily copywork, but you might <br/>
find your child *wants* and *enjoys* writing in a journal or keeping a book of <br/>
quotes, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
And YOU go ahead and do the things YOU are passionate about, whether from CM <br/>
or not.... and they might join in...or NOT. But respect their choice.<br/>
 <br/>
We unschool... and our days are *filled* with nature and art and books and <br/>
music and handicrafts.... AND TV and video games !  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just live life doing what you all love and see .....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136220984">unschoolingbasicsYou mean like real life? These are all things that people do all the time, we just don&#39;t call it a method. <br/>
<br/>
Except for the quizzing about what a picture has in it. That&#39;s not necessary. Why not just talk about the picture?<br/>

something I thought my kids would like to do.  Rather than push it on <br/>
them - whether it was a movie or a book, a garden or a nature <br/>
journal.  I do it myself.  I have read children&#39;s books that I thought <br/>
looked interesting.  I have discovered so many wonderful things that <br/>
*I* enjoy.  I started keeping a list of backyard birds on the back <br/>
door.  Every time I see a new one, I identify it with my bird book and <br/>
write it down.  In the process, through watching me do it and asking <br/>
questions, my kids have learned about identifying birds.  One day a <br/>
bird got into the house while I was outside.  My son described it to <br/>
me in detail and we discovered that it was a Carolina Wren.<br/>
