<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264510923">Free choice is such an interesting thing.<br/>
 <br/>
My son talks about being an omnivore yet if you looked at his choices,<br/>
even he&#39;d say he&#39;s really a carnivore.  He just plain loves eating steak<br/>
and sushi.  Maybe a side of shrimp.  We could force vegetables, but<br/>
he&#39;s just plain a meat eater.  I was too, growing up, but as age has <br/>
come upon me, I eat more as a vegetarian.<br/>
 <br/>
So for health purposes, should I force him away from his natural draw?<br/>
 <br/>
I need to mention here, that a bowl of candy (Halloween, Easter, etc..)<br/>
will sit forever as my kids just don&#39;t eat it.  They have a few types of candy<br/>
they will want on rare occasions but otherwise, the stuff will rot.<br/>
 <br/>
I purposely have veggie eating pets in the house, so I must keep fresh veggies,<br/>
always, so there is always a variety to munch on.  Most seem to go to the pets, <br/>
though.  Any other suggestions?  (I do keep them all washed and put up as<br/>
a quick grab.)<br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935766615">I would suggest that you let him make his own choice. If you leave <br/>
around a bowl of candy and he is allowed to choose from that, then <br/>
why would you restrict him from a steak, know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
The only meat I eat is chicken, and I&#39;m a pretty healthy eater. But <br/>
that is only because that is the only kind of meat I like, not <br/>
because I found any other meat to be unhealthy. I think if someone <br/>
told me I shouldnt eat chicken, I&#39;d probably have a fit LOL<br/>
<br/>
I think it is probably alot easier to raise a child from day one as a <br/>
vegetarian then to let him have meat and when he finds that he likes <br/>
it, you take it away. Since he has made his own choices up until this <br/>
point, I would continue to let him do so and keep providing fresh <br/>
veggies too! The way I get my kids to eat veggies is to have all <br/>
kinds of dips around here that they can pick from. They love to try <br/>
things different ways and I never have to ask them to eat their fruit <br/>
and veggies. But then of course theres always a day when they want <br/>
cereal for all three meals, lol, but that happens :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is funny, my gf has an aversion to eating melons and squashes, <br/>
bc she thinks of them as &quot;turtle food&quot;. Its not logical, just one of <br/>
those funny associations. She&#39;ll eat pureed squashes or drink punch <br/>
made with watermelon juice - just can&#39;t get around the idea of <br/>
eating cut bits of melon or squash, bc that&#39;s what she feeds her <br/>
turtles. <br/>
<br/>
Does your son drink juices? Most of the fruits, and some of the <br/>
veggies in our house are consumed as juice. Ray and George both love <br/>
carrot juice, for example, but won&#39;t eat carrots. Mo won&#39;t eat an <br/>
orange, but loves oj. We make an effort to buy juices with a high <br/>
percentage of juice in them as a result, or make our own (less <br/>
often, I hate cleaning the juicer!).<br/>
<br/>
You might also look into making desserts and pancakes with fruits <br/>
and veggies. We like grated zucchini in pancakes, as well as breads <br/>
or muffins, for example. And pie is great anytime.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found that Mo will eat greens straight from the garden, <br/>
but not as a salad or cooked. I&#39;m a fan of wild foods, and live in <br/>
the country, so Mo has also learned which weeds in our yard are <br/>
edible. Some days she goes out and grazes - that might not work so <br/>
well in town, though, if the neighbors are spraying their weeds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869450319">Lol, &quot;grazes&quot;  that so sounds like my husband.  Many years ago, I got <br/>
grossed out when he taught the kids which bugs were edible. (I would <br/>
have so lost at Fear Factor.)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great suggestions.  Summer&#39;s here so we&#39;ll just keep <br/>
offering up the variety and let them eat what they like.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22843483">We were fairly meat eating then got away from beef and pork at home but<br/>
still plenty of poultry, plus hot dogs, fast food burgers, and beef<br/>
sometimes at restaurants (DH loves ribs for example but that&#39;s not<br/>
something we&#39;d typically do at home most times anyhow), etc.Then sushi<br/>
got added in. However, along the way, we&#39;ve also started moving toward<br/>
vegetarian - we recently heard a term &quot;flexitarian&quot; - that is, we<br/>
generally eat veg but might on occasion eat some fish or other animal<br/>
meat. In a given week, most of our meals are totally vegetarian, edging<br/>
toward vegan even. So, how does this play out with DS, almost 9, who&#39;s<br/>
never been limited on what, when, how he eats? Same as always,<br/>
basically. He eats what, when, how he chooses. Most of the time, the veg<br/>
options are fine with him - DH makes an awesome veg chili for instance<br/>
(served with shredded cheese and sour cream sides, sometimes homemade<br/>
gaucamole and flour tortillas too). Other times, he&#39;s not thrilled by<br/>
the choice and opts for something else. The other night, for instance,<br/>
we were having roasted veggies and couscous. The texture of the couscous<br/>
was just not right by DS - so he grabbed a couple of hot dogs. His<br/>
choice. <br/>
 <br/>
Forcing anyone to anything is not a good choice - try forcing a sapling<br/>
tree branch away from the way it is growing and see what happens when<br/>
you release the controls - ouch! We just communicate, provide info (a<br/>
really cool poster we found showing what nutrients are from what food<br/>
items, geared to vegetarian eating - DS was amazed in a happy &quot;Cool!&quot;<br/>
way when he saw that whole grains were in almost ALL the categories),<br/>
and give him the same access to the grocery choices (he helps with the<br/>
shopping most of the time anyhow) that us grownups have. You could<br/>
-force- all-veg eating BUT you&#39;d be facing the backlash in terms of<br/>
relationship as well as what would likely happen outside of your view<br/>
(at friends&#39; homes, once he gets old enough to be out and about on his<br/>
own, etc). Consider: how would you react if someone -forced- you to add<br/>
meat into your eating, &quot;for your own good&quot; even? So, why would you do<br/>
the same to your son? <br/>
 <br/>
Also, most &quot;veggie eating pets&quot; are eating things like lettuce, celery,<br/>
and carrots - great for snacking, but not high in the protein content.<br/>
Providing alternate protein sources might be a start - make a meatless<br/>
chili for example if your family likes tex-mex. Or, try meatless burgers<br/>
- we found a recipe for black bean & bulgur &quot;burgers&quot; that looks and<br/>
works (shaping wise) remarkably like ground meat (looks kind of like<br/>
meatloaf before it&#39;s cooked). We shaped it into cylinders and wrapped it<br/>
in tortillas one night - it got good ratings from all of us - DS and I<br/>
topped it with ketchup and cheddar, DH tried salsa and cheddar. The next<br/>
day, hubby tried it with BBQ sauce. Total winner - we&#39;re looking at also<br/>
modifying the seasonings to make Italian-style &#39;meatballs&#39; for pasta and<br/>
doing these faux meatballs in BBQ sauce for next year&#39;s super bowl party<br/>
(we traditionally bring meatballs in BBQ sauce to the potluck<br/>
gathering). We also did meatless sushi last week - avocado, roasted red<br/>
peppers, cucumber, carrot, a little nice mild goat cheese (chevre), and<br/>
DS tucked some canned tuna on top of some of his battleship sushi - we<br/>
understand the sushi thing - that&#39;s where DS wants to go for his 9th<br/>
birthday dinner (our tradition is to have a just-family dinner someplace<br/>
of the birthday person&#39;s choice on or near the birthday and he picked a<br/>
sushi restaurant). We also like sashimi which is just fish, no rice or<br/>
veggies even. Find ways to accommodate BOTH your choice and his - for<br/>
instance, cook the meatballs separately in a little tomato sauce so that<br/>
you can have pasta with plain sauce and he can have pasta with<br/>
meatballs. Lots of ways to accommodate both. And, the &quot;good will&quot; (for<br/>
lack of a better term) generated because you are working WITH his<br/>
choices is likely to grow a situation where he&#39;s more willing to maybe<br/>
have one or two meatless meals each week (things like pasta are great<br/>
starters in that regard).<br/>
