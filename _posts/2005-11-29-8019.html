<div id="ygrps-yiv-753976457">Hi folks.<br/>
An unschooling friend of my dd&#39;s from Ma will be visiting us at our home in NY next week and we will need to transfer friend somewhere in Ct between our two homes.  I figure someplace just east of Hartford is middle of trip for both families.  Not knowing Ct exits well i was wondering if anyone on this list from Ct can recommend an exit that has either diner or reasonably prices pub type food easily accessible from route 84 - please no McDonalds or Friendly type restaurant - i can&#39;t digest the stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just east of Hartford is Buckland Mall - with lo these many <br/>
restaurants as well as the mall food court. My pick would be Red <br/>
Robin (they have a nice &#39;rice bowl&#39; meal that can be veggie or with <br/>
chicken - and they give you chopsticks as well as a fork! Plus, DS <br/>
gives the mac and cheese multiple thumbs up for cheesiness - and <br/>
he&#39;s rather discerning about his mac and cheese). There&#39;s also TGI <br/>
Friday&#39;s, a Hometown Buffet, an Outback Steakhouse, Macaroni Grill, <br/>
Uno&#39;s Pizza, there&#39;s a Ruby Tuesday &quot;in&quot; the mall (with an exterior <br/>
door so you don&#39;t have to go into the mall at all) and probable one <br/>
or two that I&#39;ve missed. In the same area also, but not adjacent to <br/>
the mall, there&#39;s a 99 restaurant and Bugaboo Creek. A stone&#39;s throw <br/>
away there&#39;s a new, upscale shopping area with several restaurants <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s exit 62 I believe off I 84 (we always take the back roads from <br/>
home and rarely use 84 to get to the mall) - you should be able to <br/>
mapquest it.<br/>
