<div id="ygrps-yiv-969817273">Hi Nance,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dh has dreams of teaching my dd how to do currency trading early on in<br/>
her teens so that she can be self sufficient as soon as it strikes her. WE<br/>
will see how that goes. She might surprise and horrify my dh and want to be<br/>
a doctor!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL.<br/>
