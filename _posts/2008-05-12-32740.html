I told Jael last night, the Legos are his. I&#39;m not going to bug him<br/>
about chewing them up anymore. Just please toss the plastic when he&#39;s<br/>
done with them.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of a portable, zippable suitcase for the Legos. Will<br/>
try to figure out something beneficial.  Some of my friends have<br/>
tables, they are neat. :) The twins get into everything so an enclosed<br/>
work area might work better for Jael&#39;s needs...<br/>
<br/>
Was thinking over events today and wondered about anger.  There was a<br/>
discussion here before about triggers, but I need a bit more of a<br/>
reference point -- What does a healthy expression of anger look like?<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s poptop situation for me was finding gum on the computer chair<br/>
and on the seat of my pants.  After explaining to kids several times<br/>
and demostrating the trash bin as the receptacle for it. It&#39;ll be<br/>
funny in a couple of weeks, maybe.<br/>

&gt; It is YOURS, keep it to yourself.<br/>
&gt; You had your legos and you had your lego experience. These are *his* legos,<br/>
&gt; *his* to experience.<br/>

 not so much gum but soda cans. If the trash can isn&#39;t Right next to <br/>

used as <br/>

right ... <br/>
Just playing around!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest used to throw trash behind the entertainment center. For the <br/>
life of me, I could never figure out why he would make the effort to <br/>
carry it across the room to shove it behind there and not just put it <br/>
in the trash can, which was equally as close. He has some sort of <br/>
aversion to trash cans. LOL<br/>
