<div id="ygrps-yiv-439544145">HI..I am new here...I live in Ontario Canada..I am teaching my children at<br/>
home..I was born in Chile ..my first language is spanish..and this is the<br/>
reason I write with an accent je je..<br/>
<br/>
My DD is 12 and DS is 20..he is working with his father since he is 16..he<br/>
is doing great and now he is building is own home here in our farm...my DD<br/>
is very indepent..and never been to school..she is bright..and quick to<br/>
learn what she likes...<br/>
We have a farm and animals and we do a big vegetable garden in the summer<br/>
and we do canning..<br/>
<br/>
For the friend that is asking about horses...what she can do is find a local<br/>
horse farm or a farm that they have horses..and ask them..if you girls can<br/>
go there to help once a week and if they can ride the horse once a week..<br/>
farmer love free help and will be happy to teach to girls how to ride and<br/>
learn the horses...don&#39;t take them to ridden lesson...I think is a waste of<br/>
money...I took my DD and she did like it..because it wasn&#39;t what he was<br/>
looking for..<br/>
Have a great day..<br/>
Today we are going the the livestock market <br/>
