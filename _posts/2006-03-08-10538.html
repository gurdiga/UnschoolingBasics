<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756634467">&quot; They have to learn limits, and the<br/>
parents have to be the one to set those limits.  I&#39;ve<br/>
worked with kids quite a bit, and while they may rebel<br/>
against rules and limitations, they actually function<br/>
better when what is expected of them, and that not<br/>
meeting those expectations has consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My children learn limits from living life! I try to only set limits<br/>
that are real, not arbitrary (I don&#39;t like being hit, I don&#39;t let<br/>
people destroy my property etc...) but I see that as personal<br/>
boundaries more than anything.<br/>
My kids don&#39;t rebel against rules and limitations, because for one<br/>
thing I don&#39;t have rules!:)<br/>
Secondly, I don&#39;t fill their lives with limitations, I seek to find<br/>
the way to fulfill their desires and give them freedom.  My children<br/>
don&#39;t need to meet my expectations to avoid &quot;consequences&quot;.  I don&#39;t<br/>
dole out consequences. True consequences happen because of natural law<br/>
(gravity makes the liquid pour out, not wearing a coat in cold weather<br/>
can make you cold, most plants die if you don&#39;t water them, Mom is<br/>
crazy if she doesn&#39;t get truffles at least once a week:), not because<br/>
I choose to make them happen.<br/>
