<div id="ygrps-yiv-288843251">&quot;we have always<br/>
enjoyed the quiet time to ourselves after the kids are in bed to read,<br/>
research on the net, answer emails, play games, watch movies with<br/>
hubby, etc...are we going to loose that down time that I think I<br/>
really need if I don&#39;t have the kids in bed at a certain time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those huge &quot;it depends&quot; issues.<br/>
<br/>
Are your children tired at the time you help them transition to sleep?<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a &quot;bedtime&quot; routine to help kids<br/>
transition to sleep....young children usually need that. Are they<br/>
wanting to stay up, or happily laying down with you? <br/>
<br/>
I guess my big thing, is having a certain TIME for bed is less<br/>
important than helping people sleep when they&#39;re tired. If everyone is<br/>
happy, not asking to stay up, maybe don&#39;t rock the boat too much just<br/>
yet.:)<br/>
<br/>
It depends.<br/>
If it hits that &quot;calm down&quot; time of the evening and someone is engaged<br/>
and wants to keep at the activity, is the bedtime more important or<br/>
the activity?  If you&#39;re being open to helping them continue any<br/>
activities they might choose, rather than putting your quiet/alone<br/>
time ahead of their needs (not that your needs don&#39;t matter) then I&#39;d<br/>
say don&#39;t worry about it so much. Maybe everyone is tired about the<br/>
same time each night for now...just be open to change.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in our household has a different sleep pattern these days.<br/>
Being open to change and flow is the best way to adapt as children<br/>
grow older and more autnonomous. You can still find ways to enjoy time<br/>
together as a couple, you just have to get more creative at certain<br/>
phases in life. <br/>
