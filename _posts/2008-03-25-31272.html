<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953528603">The kids and I went to the food store today. We bought some gummis,<br/>
bread, pop tarts, cereal, rice milk, peanut butter crackers.<br/>
<br/>
We went to soccer and had some crackers and gummis. They had bananas<br/>
and a drink after soccer. Home again and I try to fix some chicken<br/>
with rice.<br/>
<br/>
The kids kept going at the gummis. They&#39;re all gone now.   I&#39;m angry<br/>
because it&#39;s gone and the chicken and rice is in the oven. They will<br/>
likely snub it for two reasons. It looks &quot;weird&quot; and they&#39;re full from<br/>
the snacky foods they had, mostly sugar. I understand kids can be<br/>
ravenous but I&#39;m trying my best here!<br/>
<br/>
They picked out some food, mostly the junky items themselves. I try to<br/>
provide meals that they&#39;d like, and try to incorporate vitamins in<br/>
them. I put barley grass onto their peanut butter sandwiches! I am so<br/>
fed up at them wanting sugar and feeling stuck between my ineptitude<br/>
and my ideal of unschooling food . Finish, enough. I feel powerless<br/>
because I don&#39;t want to control the foods and leave them craving it<br/>
even more than they already are now. And I most certainly can&#39;t shove<br/>
vegetables down their throat!<br/>
<br/>
I feel so inept at cooking because we have. divergent needs and I can<br/>
barely meet it on top of everything else. I&#39;m angry because I feel<br/>
powerless and inept, trying to scrounge together meals and not find<br/>
myself still hungry at night because of the slim pickings. How can I<br/>
keep trying new foods and having them end up in the garbage because of<br/>
snubbings? What am I doing wrong here?!<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Don&#39;t tell kids things they already know. It is insulting. Remember<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they (like all of us) know things that they may not always<br/>
&gt; &gt; exemplify. They&#39;re LEARNING - they&#39;re are working on it. It is their<br/>
&gt; &gt; life - let them work on it some without feeling like they&#39;re always<br/>
&gt; &gt; being watched and corrected.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stop before you talk. Ask yourself, &quot;Am I about to tell him something<br/>
&gt; &gt; new?&quot; If not, don&#39;t say it. Either he&#39;s not ready to understand it or<br/>
&gt; &gt; he already knows it. Either way, repeating yourself is truly worse<br/>
&gt; &gt; than useless, it makes it less and less likely your child will listen<br/>
&gt; &gt; to your advice as he/she gets older.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s a gift when your loved one (a kid) lets you know when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; turning into Charlie Brown&#39;s Teacher (an old cartoon where the teacher&#39;s<br/>
&gt; voice was represented by a &quot;mwah, mwah, mwah&quot; sound) -- my friends aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; often this informative with me :D (I tend to miss the cues)<br/>
&gt; I like to bring up situations to discuss when we&#39;re doing something totally<br/>
&gt; unrelated (i.e. driving- We love talking in the car!! or while baking some<br/>
&gt; goodies -- hard to get crabby when surrounded by delicious scents!), when<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re in the midst of calm and happy. Hayden (9.5) is lately receptive to<br/>
&gt; some guided imagery with me - we were headed out to a Bender Party (Yay<br/>
&gt; Futurama&#39;s back!!!) where he&#39;d be the only kid. I asked if he was gonna have<br/>
&gt; a good time, he said, I think so, I asked, Can you see yourself having a<br/>
&gt; good time? He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, smiled and said YEAH! --<br/>
&gt; and he did :)<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s imperative to remember &quot;Don&#39;t take it<br/>
&gt; personally&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html">http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>
&gt; in the moment (and in every moment for that matter ::bg::) -- he&#39;s sharing<br/>
&gt; *his* experience, it doesn&#39;t have to look anything like your experience...<br/>
&gt; If what your child is reflecting back at you is not what you&#39;re intending to<br/>
&gt; show them, change what you&#39;re showing them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406053171">I can&#39;t help but wonder, what is barley grass, and why in the world would you want to put it on a perfectly wonderful peanut butter sandwich?!?!?  What I see here is that you have elevated food to an issue *beyond* food, and you are patrolling the playing field with a clipboard and a whistle, wanting to call the shots.  Let food be food and give up your agenda.  Your kids obviously sense your uneasiness and your fears.  Let them go.<br/>

<br/>
Do old familiar foods that you know the kids like, most of the time.  <br/>
Once in a while introduce something new alongside the old and familiar  <br/>
(and simple) and notice whether the kids like it or not. If it is a  <br/>
hit, add it to your repertoire.<br/>
<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t likely to be full for very long no matter how many gummies  <br/>
they eat, by the way. They go right through them, pretty quickly.<br/>

dinner?<br/>
<br/>
If angry that they&#39;re all gone ... know what? It&#39;s just hit me  <br/>
yesterday that I&#39;ve heard people say all my life &quot;You shouldn&#39;t eat  <br/>
those all today. You won&#39;t have any tomorrow.&quot; And while it sounds  <br/>
good, the times I&#39;ve said &quot;Gee, I wish I had what I finished  <br/>
yesterday,&quot; are far out numbered by the times I&#39;ve found something  <br/>
spoiled in the refrigerator that I had saved for later but then  <br/>
forgotten about. I&#39;d *much* rather eat as much as I want -- even if  <br/>
it&#39;s all of it -- and not risk forgetting about it.<br/>
<br/>
If angry that they&#39;re full, recognize that kids metabolisms are  <br/>
different. They operate much better with small snacks throughout the  <br/>
day. (It&#39;s actually healthier for adults too.) Three large meals a  <br/>
day isn&#39;t natural. (It&#39;s just convenient.) It&#39;s much better to have  <br/>
the refrigerator and snack shelf full of easy to grab healthy snacks  <br/>
than to expect kids to wait for a sit down dinner. Bring a &quot;monkey  <br/>
platter&quot; to them (tray of finger foods) when they play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the chicken and rice is in the oven.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Expectations.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re horrible things. It sets others up to fail. It&#39;s playing a  <br/>
game with rules you&#39;ve made up with others who don&#39;t even know  <br/>
they&#39;re participating. How can they not fail?<br/>
<br/>
Make enough so you have more than enough to freeze an extra meal for  <br/>
you and your husband. Let the kids eat what they want of it without  <br/>
the dose of anger that they aren&#39;t doing what you want. Then you have  <br/>
an easy dinner another night for the adults and can have more energy  <br/>
for the foods the kids like.<br/>
<br/>
Rethink. Trying to make others conform to your expectations will make  <br/>
you and them angry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to<br/>
&gt; provide meals that they&#39;d like,<br/>

assume they&#39;ll like them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and try to incorporate vitamins in<br/>
&gt; them. I put barley grass onto their peanut butter sandwiches!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect you&#39;re over thinking the vitamins. While it would be great  <br/>
to get a full complement everyday maybe find a vitamin they like and  <br/>
that will take at least that pressure off of you. (Ask on the list  <br/>
for vitamins kids like.)<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;ve got yourself locked into the idea of one three course  <br/>
dinner. Or something. You&#39;ve got some rules in your head that are  <br/>
getting in the way of all the possibilities of helping people get  <br/>
food into them. Make extra of the dinners you like and freeze a  <br/>
dinner portion for the nights when you&#39;re making stuff you don&#39;t  <br/>
like. Do the same for the kids. Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got bindings all over you that you don&#39;t realize are there.  <br/>
You&#39;ll need to see them and let go of them to open yourself to new  <br/>
ideas.<br/>

and myself because we didn&#39;t have that as children.  And over time <br/>
we realized that while *WE* like eating together, the kids usually <br/>
have other ideas in mind.  We also were bummed that we weren&#39;t <br/>
getting to eat the kinds of meals we wanted because the kids didn&#39;t <br/>
like the same foods.  We were getting tired of fried or baked <br/>
chicken, green beans, and boxed pasta.  Then we realized that we <br/>
didn&#39;t need to all eat the same thing at the same time!  <br/>
<br/>
Did they have to eat the chicken and rice at the same time as you?  <br/>
Couldn&#39;t you have put it in the refrigerator and then heat it up <br/>
when they were ready for it?  Can you cook it differently so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t look weird?  I make a chicken and rice dish and my ds11 <br/>
asked me recently to start cooking the chicken separately from the <br/>
rice.  It will mean messing up one more pot.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of having healthy foods as snacks.  We do that too.  <br/>
I keep lean meat, cheese, crackers, yogurt, popcorn, and fruits and <br/>
veggies (dd10 loves raw veggies with ranch dressing) where the kids <br/>
can just reach in and grab what they want when they are hungry.  I <br/>
also keep their favorite juices/drinks where they can reach them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239076123">Angry about food.  I totally get that.  Let me tell you what I have<br/>
learned this year.  First, let me say I do all the cooking and the<br/>
washing up.  It&#39;s easy to get miffed when I spend 3 hours making<br/>
something that only one person will eat.  It&#39;s also easy to get ticked<br/>
at the idea that I have to spend 3 hours making 5 different meals and<br/>
cleaning them up.  There are lots of reasons for that and they are all<br/>
INTERNAL.  I have some *issues* related to being &quot;just a mommy&quot; which<br/>
I need to get a handle on.  But anyway, I&#39;ve been where you are,<br/>
although I didn&#39;t obsess over vitamins.  I&#39;ve also seen my kids blow<br/>
through a box of gummies or whatever in 10 minutes and then have them<br/>
lament there aren&#39;t more available.<br/>
<br/>
Now I *could* buy 50 boxes of them but they are expensive and that&#39;s<br/>
not in the budget.  So where I can I buy those types of things in<br/>
bulk.  My boys are 11 and 9 and they don&#39;t need the cute little<br/>
packages anymore.  When they were younger they liked having Disney<br/>
characters or whatever, but now that they are older, they just want<br/>
the gummies so they are cool with just plain old bears.  So consider<br/>
purchasing things in bulk to make your dollar stretch.  Now for the<br/>
boys they need clearly demarcated amounts of things or they will<br/>
fight.  So I buy them and then put them into containers for each kid<br/>
and they are marked so that if John eats all his, that&#39;s that.  Liam<br/>
will still have his and I don&#39;t have the &quot;Yeah but he ate almost ALL<br/>
of them!!!&quot;  This works.  It also makes it possible for the kids to<br/>
use portion control if they so wish.  They are getting more aware of<br/>
being fat/thin healthy/unhealthy and making good choices and so if<br/>
they have say 1/2 a pound of gummies we look up what a serving would<br/>
be, get them something to measure it out with and then they belong to<br/>
them.  If they want to eat 1/2 a lb in 30 minutes that&#39;s their<br/>
business.  After all, if I want to eat 15 ice creams in one day who<br/>
will stop me?  No one.  Once you let go of this area you and your kids<br/>
will be happier and you won&#39;t see as much gorging.  But do buy in bulk<br/>
unless the little packages are important to your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in January I brought home Shun, Xian Yi aka Morgan from Guangzhou<br/>
China.  She has a VERY short list of what she considers edible.  And<br/>
because we are bonding and I know a lot about integrating an<br/>
internationally adopted child into the family, I knew not to push the<br/>
food thing.  Besides, there is a mental shift that happens when you<br/>
stop thinking &quot;Little brat won&#39;t eat that!&quot;  to &quot;She doesn&#39;t believe<br/>
that&#39;s food.&quot;  And there isn&#39;t anything I can do about it.  She eats<br/>
what she eats.  Slowly her list is getting longer but it&#39;s a very slow<br/>
process.  And I was *TOTALLY* OK with it.  Well if it&#39;s OK for this<br/>
child why not my kids?  Why was I putting pressure on them to eat?<br/>
After much internal examination all my &quot;yeah but...&quot;s were making room<br/>
for *my* issues.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I&#39;m trying to say, look at the issues you think you have,<br/>
and then be honest with yourself about whether they are real<br/>
family/kid issues like budget or allergies or if they are your issues<br/>
(which are just as real only you have to work on them) like feeling<br/>
taken for granted or reliving food issues from your childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, this one isn&#39;t easy in our culture.  Food is often<br/>
emotionally charged from our families.  I&#39;ve been dedicated to trying<br/>
to keep food as food and NOT a punisher or a reward.  Food is simply<br/>
fuel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395248766">We went to my sister&#39;s for Easter. While we were there, I was telling<br/>
her that on Monday nights, we usually eat dinner in front of the TV<br/>
and watch some really great shows on CBS. I told her it took me a<br/>
little while to let go of the false guilt I had about that - you hear<br/>
about eating dinner in front of the TV like it&#39;s some kind of horrid<br/>
crime. But when I really looked at *our* reality, I saw that we<br/>
chatted about the shows, laughed together a lot - it is a connecting<br/>
time, and a lot of fun. (How *did* Ted Moseby meet his kids&#39; mother?)<br/>
<br/>
I had forgotten, but she reminded me - before my parents were<br/>
divorced, we had dinner together every single night. But, because my<br/>
father didn&#39;t like chattering going on while he ate, we couldn&#39;t talk!<br/>
There was a RULE against talking at the dinner table, unless you were<br/>
asking someone to pass something. Oh, my gosh - we laughed SO hard at<br/>
that absurdity! I could remember we developed this whole communication<br/>
system of looks and eye movements... <br/>
<br/>
We were saying I bet there are some families who&#39;ve heard those<br/>
commercials about how important it is to eat dinner together as a<br/>
family, at the table, who&#39;ve made the experience just as miserable as<br/>
it was for us. (You sit down and eat your dinner! This is family time,<br/>
dammit!!) But the truth is - if you&#39;re connecting deeply throughout<br/>
the day, dinner time loses some of that feeling of *necessity* about<br/>
it. It&#39;s not such a *requirement*.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amongst the other great ideas you got, another idea might be simply <br/>
to shift your perspective and intention around the entire food <br/>
issue.  Yes, you want to nourish their bodies, and to that end, <br/>
having quick-to-grab, healthy food items **that you know they like** <br/>
around is really good.  But, if you can manage to shift your <br/>
intention to having food be just one more avenue by which they feel <br/>
loved by you, if you can intend that food will always (or almost <br/>
always) be prepared with love and received by them with love, I <br/>
believe you may be able to completely turn this issue around!<br/>
<br/>
You cannot control them, but you *can* control yourself.  You *can* <br/>
choose how you want to respond, how you want to feel, what foods you <br/>
want to prepare; you are free to choose all those things!  Your free <br/>
to let angry feelings pass through you and choose a better <br/>
feeling.  And, remember that when you do feel angry about food or <br/>
about anything, you are choosing that, too, although by default.  You <br/>
don&#39;t have to believe everything you think!<br/>
<br/>
If you set the intention to approach your food issues in a peaceful, <br/>
loving way, you will have already made a giant step towards <br/>
*allowing* a better experience for everyone.  Anyway, it&#39;s worth a <br/>
try, and becoming more mindful about something like that really can&#39;t <br/>
hurt.  Right?<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve set them up for certain behaviors and now you&#39;re angry at them.<br/>
They&#39;re going at the gummis because they must know it&#39;s a limited<br/>
food. They are trying to get their fill before you change your mind or<br/>
they&#39;re gone. Most people will gorge on anything they love that they<br/>
can&#39;t have access to when they want it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re angry because they&#39;re acting like normal human beings. If you<br/>
want them to have access to healthier snacks, make them more readily<br/>
available. What if you&#39;d made up a platter of the gummis and a bunch<br/>
of other yummy finger foods? Kids shouldn&#39;t be expected to wait for<br/>
chicken and rice when they&#39;re hungry NOW. Food should be readily<br/>
available all day so they can learn to balance their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
The gummis would probably disappear first because it&#39;s a desirable<br/>
food that isn&#39;t available often (it sounds like). But eventually, as<br/>
they trust you to give them access to the foods they choose, it will<br/>
slow down. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fed up at them wanting sugar and feeling stuck between my ineptitude<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve created a reality in which they believe those foods are more<br/>
desirable than others. If you don&#39;t have the budget for a lot of<br/>
processed foods, you could make the snacks available by baking more of<br/>
what they love. Make food available. Make it yummy. Involve the kids<br/>
in food prep and they may come up with some great ideas.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some words in your post jumped out at me:<br/>
<br/>
I feel powerless<br/>
I feel so inept at cooking<br/>
I&#39;m angry<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting from this is a frustration about life in general and<br/>
it seems like the kids making some choices you are used to controlling<br/>
is some kind of trigger. Is that possible? Could it be that you&#39;re<br/>
already feeling overwhelmed and out of control and the fact that they<br/>
aren&#39;t happily asking for broccoli for every meal is making<br/>
exascerbating your frustrations?<br/>
<br/>
They can only BE exactly where they are right now. Same with you. If<br/>
frustration over not being able to afford better/more food is<br/>
trickling into frustration towards them (for simply being themselves)<br/>
then it&#39;s time to self-examine.<br/>
<br/>
It may not be about food at all. This could be a control issue.<br/>
<br/>
If your budget is so tight that you will truly be out of food until<br/>
more money comes, then you will have to be really honest with them<br/>
about what you can and can&#39;t afford. Let them be part of the solution<br/>
but don&#39;t make them feel responsible for the money issues, or for<br/>
eating the gummis too fast. They SHOULD eat them fast if they aren&#39;t<br/>
going to get more for a while!<br/>
<br/>
Find their favorite treats, make sure you focus on making as much from<br/>
scratch to save money (or find a way to make more money) and dont&#39;<br/>
make anything limited or controlled. Money limits are natural, Mom<br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; is arbitrary. <br/>
<br/>
Owning your issues is a great way to keep your frustrations from<br/>
spilling over to your children. It&#39;s not about them, or the food, it&#39;s<br/>
about your ideas about food and control...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748345481">I appreciate very much what you all have written. Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly some food issues with me. One is a limited budget<br/>
on food stamps - the other is my worry abt the kids not getting enough<br/>
vitamins.  Armand (one of the twins) had a serious nosebleed a couple<br/>
weeks ago that scared me. It is possibly a vitamin K deficency, which<br/>
is why I was putting a sprinkling of barley grass on the PB<br/>
sandwiches. (Organic barley, dark leafy veg equals vit K I figured)<br/>
<br/>
The boys like Yummi Bears vitamins so that works so far, never mind the cost :)<br/>
<br/>
Ofc I have the voice of my mother pointing out their feeding habits<br/>
and how pale they are and any new behaviors, etc. She said very impt<br/>
to eat dinner together, family time. MY memories of &quot;family supper<br/>
time&quot; is of feeling frustrated abt veggies and about the lack of<br/>
signing among other family members.  My boys chatter without signing<br/>
in front of me at the table, possibly because we lived with them for a<br/>
while but that is another issue entirely. (The more signers around the<br/>
more they&#39;ll sign I figure) :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard when the kids say they&#39;re hungry so much (yes they want<br/>
protein after the sugar) but snub the &quot;healthy&quot; food. I think I&#39;ll<br/>
take the advice to break things up in smaller frequent meals and beef<br/>
up the snacks some. Will think abt and try to resolve MY issues too.<br/>

(other than in newborns) because we make vitamin k in our intestines,  <br/>
even when we don&#39;t ingest it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re sort of a hypochondriac? I mean - did you  <br/>
really jump from nosebleed to vitamin k deficiency on your own?  <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be way more likely he had dry nasal passages and/or picked  <br/>
his nose?<br/>

I get the feeling you need to let go of a lot of fear about their  <br/>
health.<br/>
<br/>
Give them a multivitamin every day (a gummi one &lt;G&gt;). Offer a variety  <br/>
of foods, but stop trying to figure out if they&#39;re getting exactly all  <br/>
the nutrients you think they need. You&#39;re overdoing it.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew has never eaten vegetables. He is 29 years old. He is  <br/>
superbly healthy - runs 3 or 4 miles almost every day. My niece at  <br/>
only about 6 foods - flour tortillas, applesauce, macaroni and cheese,  <br/>
apples, refried beans, cheddar cheese. She&#39;s 22 and works out at a gym  <br/>
and swims regularly. She&#39;s healthy as can be. Her eating habits have  <br/>
changed - she eats lots of variety of things now.<br/>
<br/>
Offer them the foods they love - with your love.<br/>
<br/>
Make oatmeal cookies, offer carrots with ranch dressing dip, have  <br/>
cheese chunks with crackers, have sliced apples with cinnamon, make  <br/>
peanut butter balls, freeze grapes, and on and on. There are so many  <br/>
yummy snack foods - they can live on those and be very very fine!<br/>

nuke a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips in a wide container deep enough<br/>
