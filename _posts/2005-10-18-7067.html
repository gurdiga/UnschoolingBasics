<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089504607">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a lurker on this (and every other unschooling) list for a <br/>
few years now. My name is Kendra and I live in MA with my 8yo son. I <br/>
really want to unschool my son, but right now he is in public school. <br/>
I&#39;m divorced and am in the process of trying to find a way to keep my <br/>
son home. There are several issues. The first is how to work and have <br/>
him home with me...are there others here that are single working <br/>
unschooling parents and how do you make it work?<br/>
<br/>
The other issue is convincing my ex and his new wife. I&#39;ve given them <br/>
Ren&#39;s new book and the wife read it already and really liked the <br/>
ideas, but has a few questions. It&#39;s my ex that I&#39;m struggling with. <br/>
From what I&#39;ve read here, he has some of the &quot;typical&quot; Dad <br/>
reservations and attitudes towards learning. He&#39;s very academic, <br/>
actually we all (me, Dad, and his wife)went to MIT, and wants him to <br/>
learn everything, be the best, and try hard. Also my son goes to a <br/>
great school by public school standards and so my ex really likes <br/>
that fact. Communication is hard enough when you are parenting <br/>
together, but when you got divorced mainly because you really <br/>
couldn&#39;t communicate very well, it&#39;s even harder now :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been emailing back and forth for many weeks now about how and <br/>
if we could make homeschooling happen. At least he&#39;s somewhat open to <br/>
the idea, but is it possible to unschool in one house and homeschool <br/>
in the other house? Would that just be totally confusing for my son? <br/>
It doesn&#39;t sit right with me of course, but would it be better than <br/>
public school? Right now my son lives with me Monday thru Friday and <br/>
goes to their house every weekend except one a month. So they would <br/>
be trying to do &quot;school at home&quot; (probably)on the weekends, while my <br/>
son and I would be living and learning unschool style during the <br/>
week. Although perhaps our schedule could change somehow if he didn&#39;t <br/>
have to be in school and since I need to work somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Assuming that your son is on board with the whole leaving school idea, I think it&#39;s a step in the right direction. None of you can tackle the unschooling vs. homeschooling debate until your son is out of the school system.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So they would<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a better ratio than he&#39;s got now with 5 out of 7 days in school. It&#39;s a start. And you can keep feeding them stuff to read and wonderful anecdotes about all the cool stuff your son is doing and learning with you. Even better would be to point out the weekend learning that happens outside or in spite of whatever schoolwork they&#39;re doing.<br/>

Welcome Kendra!<br/>
This must be a hard situation.    My initial thought is to let your ex <br/>
do &quot;school at home&quot; on the weekends, to keep the peace, then just <br/>
deschool with your son during the week, keep reading and learning as <br/>
much as you can about the unschooling lifestyle.   It&#39;s much harder for <br/>
parents to embrace and understand I&#39;ve found!<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 13 and just finished 6th grade.   This is our first year at <br/>
home.  She&#39;s deschooling, healing from being in public school (there <br/>
were many issues I won&#39;t go into right now as I have limited time on <br/>
the computer today).  You&#39;ll find families here who have unschooled all <br/>
their lives, and those of us new to it who pulled children from <br/>
school.   Go back in the archives and read some of the posts as well, <br/>
plus the links listed here too (and Kelly&#39;s new website!).<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading and keep posting your questions!   This is a great place <br/>
for newbies!  I&#39;m sure there are some in similar situations to yours!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in MA too(No Reading), where do you live?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113691458"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; are there others here that are<br/>
&gt; single working <br/>
&gt; unschooling parents and how do you make it work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are divorced and single parents who unschool --<br/>
also two parent households where both parents work. <br/>
It can be done, but I feel it can be VERY difficult. <br/>
A lot depends on how many hours working, what type of<br/>
job you have, your schedule, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One thought I had -- do you work a typical<br/>
Monday-Friday week?  And then on weekends he is with<br/>
dad?  How often would you actually be with him during<br/>
an average week?  Is your job flexible where you can<br/>
work two of your days on the weekend when he is with<br/>
his dad?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is it possible to unschool in one<br/>
&gt; house and homeschool <br/>
&gt; in the other house? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I don&#39;t think it is ideal, I do think it is<br/>
possible.  And this might be the only thing that will <br/>
work given your situation.  Right now he is schooled 5<br/>
days a week and if dad schools him on the weekends, he<br/>
would go down to 2 days.  If your son wants to be<br/>
unschooled/homeschooled, I think that it would be<br/>
better than public school.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the question is (and you know your ex better than<br/>
any of us do), would he really accept a situation like<br/>
this?  It&#39;s to your son&#39;s benefit for you to be very<br/>
flexible on whether you actually unschool or<br/>
homeschool.  If your ex seems anti-unschooling (but<br/>
okay with homeschooling), I would consider not using<br/>
the term and try doing a very relaxed, eclectic<br/>
approach to homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113854186">Thank you to the people who responded to my questions about this! Here&#39;s a little more info.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is probably the type of child that would be &quot;fine&quot; in the school system. What I mean is that he would conform and try to do his best and not complain too much, as this is his personality. But of course I don&#39;t want that for him. But explaining the harm that is/will be done to his spirit is another story, since for all intents and purposes he will &quot;look fine&quot; to him. They are also questioning me by saying well he&#39;s learned so much already academically and socially. I believe they want me to justify why that is, if school is so bad. That is a very hard thing for me to do articulately for many reasons. <br/>
Another issue is that when asked by my ex why he wanted to homeschool, he said it was because it would be easier. That really upset my ex, as he is a workaholic! Here&#39;s a copy of the email he wrote to me regarding this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kendra<br/>
<br/>
Karen and I are pretty excited about homeschooling, as an initial statement, though there are significant issues that we all have to work out, as we are talking about and emailing about every day.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I asked Frank this weekend what his thoughts were about not being in school.  His main, repeatable statement about it is that he thought it would be easier at home than in school. In fact, when I answered that it might not be so easy, and it might even be harder learning at home, he asked if *just you* could teach him.   We have to BE VERY CAREFUL not to bring him up to choose only the easy path; and I feel pretty strongly about it.  More than you know, possibly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I dont care about grades, or tests, or what he actually does with his life(artist or engineer, or whatever), but I damn sure want him to work hard at it, and not always take the easy road.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So instead of being so worried that I am killing the idea (which I am not), you might be somewhat concerned that this is becoming a repeating theme with him, of him not wanting things to be too hard. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
F<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is saying is that he&#39;s bored (I asked him). He does fine academically and doesn&#39;t struggle with the work, so really I believe he doesn&#39;t like the approach they take with things like math worksheets and phonics etc. As we the unschoolers all know, of course he&#39;s bored and would rather learn at home! But in order for me to be able to bring him home I&#39;ve somehow got to convince the ex that our son isn&#39;t &quot;lazy&quot;.  Ugggh it just sucks to have to defend everything I believe in...I&#39;m not sure of the best way to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My other concern about unschooling in one home and homeschooling in the other relates to the &quot;easy&quot; factor. My fear is about creating feelings for my son about one house vs the other. Like one is easier than the other, or one is more fun, etc. Although perhaps because of his personality he would go with the flow well, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps it&#39;s a fear I should share with my ex. Or perhaps I can try to ease slowly into unschooling, but doing some eclectic homeschooling first just to ease my ex&#39;s fears.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any more thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful to have these lists to read...they are so wonderful!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

We live in Acton. I actually have been reading about unschooling for years now! I&#39;ve had so much time to learn about it and have been trying to unschool &quot;life&quot; for awhile now, even though we haven&#39;t done the actual unschool &quot;school&quot; part.

Again thanks for the help. I have checked for local groups. Like you I don&#39;t think there are many homeschoolers from Acton (since the schools are better than most) let alone unschoolers. There is a homeschool co-op called Voyagers here in Acton that is very active. You actually may be interested in it since they have many teens. Most people travel from further away. Here&#39;s the website www.voyagers.inc<br/>
 <br/>
I have checked into Acton&#39;s policies, but need to read them more closely. From what I&#39;ve skimmed they seem pretty up on the laws, but I&#39;m unsure how they would deal with an unschooler. More research to do...<br/>

Hi Brandie,<br/>
 <br/>
Actually right now I work at home, so it would seem to be an ideal situation to bring my son home. However, my job is not all that stable. I&#39;m an engineering consultant and may need to start going into the office a few days a week soon. Also, I get incredibly stressed when trying to work at home while my son is home. I feel as if I&#39;m not doing either job well at all. Of course there may be options to find someone to come into my house to play with him while I work or something...I need to look more into that. I can actually work at home on the weekends on things I don&#39;t need to talk to people about so that helps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

This is something he and I need to discuss further. He&#39;s not too on board with the unschooling, but he knows how I feel about it and also knows that I wouldn&#39;t be traditionally homeschooling. Like you said perhaps I&#39;ll have to compromise a little more in the beginning.<br/>
 <br/>
Just last night my ex came over to be with my son and my son was reading a book. My ex asked me if he was comprehending what he was reading and how did know? I just looked at him crazy like and said he&#39;s reading, I don&#39;t quiz him on every book he reads just to be sure he&#39;s comprehending it all! He will tell me funny or good parts about them and that&#39;s good enough for me. Geeezz talk about taking all the fun out of reading.... We just stared at each other exasperatedly. lol<br/>

Any more  thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely try and see where your son thinks it will be &quot;easier&quot;  and <br/>
what he means by that, for your ex&#39;s sake. There is a big difference between  <br/>
working hard at something and being forced to work hard at something. What <br/>
may  be hard to one person, isn&#39;t always hard for the next. <br/>
I think back to my schooling... anything dealing with English or geography  <br/>
was almost second nature to me. Both of my parents were math people and I just  <br/>
couldn&#39;t grasp it. For them, the basics were easy. For me, the basics were <br/>
hard.  And I was forced into learning those, as well as the harder stuff. I <br/>
always  chose the &quot;easier&quot; route, not because I was lazy, but because it was all I <br/>
could  understand. To my parents, what was hard for me, was second nature to <br/>
them, and  many, many struggles ensued.<br/>
So, I would look into your son&#39;s interests. Does he have a love for  numbers, <br/>
yet struggles with reading? Or the other way around? Maybe that&#39;s what  he <br/>
means by homeschooling being &quot;easier&quot;... there won&#39;t be the need to &quot;conform&quot;  <br/>
to public school methods.<br/>
Just my 2 cents :o)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324166695"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Again thanks for the help. I have checked for local groups. Like you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there are many homeschoolers from Acton (since the <br/>
schools are better than most) let alone unschoolers. There is a <br/>
homeschool co-op called Voyagers here in Acton that is very active. You <br/>
actually may be interested in it since they have many teens. Most <br/>
people travel from further away. Here&#39;s the website www.voyagers.inc<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>closely. From what I&#39;ve skimmed they seem pretty up on the laws, but <br/>
I&#39;m unsure how they would deal with an unschooler. More research to <br/>
do...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kendra.  I HAVE heard of this group and I&#39;ll check it out.   <br/>
Acton is not too terribly far, and we don&#39;t mind traveling (it&#39;s <br/>
certainly easier with one child!).<br/>
<br/>
Danielle has made a shift just this week, she&#39;s been on the computer a <br/>
lot during her initial deschooling period, and she has been saying she <br/>
thinks she&#39;s been on it too much, her eyes are bugging her, and she <br/>
feels ready to get out and do more.  She&#39;s a homebody, shy at first <br/>
with new people, but once she&#39;s got a feel for the situation and gets <br/>
to know people, she&#39;s great!.   What&#39;s nice is that SHE has come to <br/>
this realization and is beginning to find &quot;herself&quot;.  Plus 13 is tough <br/>
enough with all the developmental/hormonal changes (we talk about this <br/>
too, she hasn&#39;t started her period yet) (I was 13), she has a couple of <br/>
friends from school her age who have, so she&#39;s well aware of it, but <br/>
also has an anxiety piece (a worrier) to her temperament that&#39;s coming <br/>
into play here (transitions and new things have always been hard for <br/>
her, she needs to talk about it A LOT, which I&#39;m glad of, it&#39;s better <br/>
than silence and keeping it inside).   We talked last night about <br/>
purposely getting out more, making an effort to go do things and meet <br/>
other unschoolers (and homeschoolers, if it&#39;s something she&#39;s <br/>
interested in).   What&#39;s important to her is to be with people (of all <br/>
ages) who have similar interests.  She&#39;s still stuck in the &quot;schooly&quot; <br/>
mindset of &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do&quot;, she&#39;s still working on being able <br/>
to explore other interests, knowing WHAT they are.<br/>

They don&#39;t really know that you &quot;unschool&quot;. No law here says you need to  <br/>

That&#39;s great that you&#39;ve been reading about unschooling for so long (I <br/>
only found it about a year or so ago! and it just felt right, once I <br/>
got past the initial reaction of &quot;oh, that sounds WAY too loose for <br/>
me).  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for every one, but I know it&#39;s best for my <br/>
dd.   We&#39;ve got a long way to go, but at least we&#39;re on the right path <br/>
now.  Being home with her has DEFINITELY changed things for the better <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202655714"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Another issue is that when asked by my ex why he wanted to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschool, he said it was because it would be easier. That really <br/>
upset my ex, as he is a workaholic!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you need to do is word it differently, with both your son <br/>
and ex, I know what you mean by saying it will be easier, but maybe <br/>
it would sit better with your ex to say it will be a better learning <br/>
environment for your son because you can explore things at his pace, <br/>
avoid the boring worksheets etc, really &quot;learn&quot; things in depth, <br/>
etc.  I&#39;m sure there are some here who can pipe in with some better <br/>
ways to put this than me!  I&#39;m still working on being able to talk <br/>
about it articulately myself, but I DO get it!.<br/>
<br/>
As you said, maybe looking at it from a more &quot;ecclectic&quot; point of <br/>
view will help initially.   DO some of the &quot;schooly&quot; things, or <br/>
things in a schoolish way (do some math, when he reads a book, write <br/>
in a journal when your son talks about it, write his comments or a <br/>
summary of &quot;what he comprehends&quot;, as opposed to making up a &quot;test&quot; <br/>
for him to show his &quot;progress&quot;.   Something like this might help your <br/>
ex to see that he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;, it&#39;s something &quot;measurable&quot;, like the <br/>
schools do.).   Take cues from your son as to how much of this <br/>
(worksheets etc) he&#39;s able to do willingly etc.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, depending on what form of assessment you choose when you send <br/>
in your LOI, if it&#39;s a portfolio (dated work samples) then this will <br/>
be in place.   OR, you might want to consider a standardized test <br/>
(this might placate your ex).   My dd took the CAT/5 last April when <br/>
she was still in school to see what it was like.  Initially I thought <br/>
that would be easiest, take one week out of the whole year and it&#39;s <br/>
done.   She HATED it!   She felt it was a waste of time.  We talked <br/>
about it alot and decided that wasn&#39;t the best choice.   Where she&#39;s <br/>
middle school age, I felt &quot;work samples&quot; would be a lot of work (in <br/>
elem school, I feel doing a few worksheets, etc here and there is <br/>
easier), so we (and she and I decided together) that we would do a <br/>
narrative report.   Initially she said &quot;won&#39;t that be too much work <br/>
for you?&quot; but I told her I&#39;ve been getting a lot of suggestions from <br/>
other unschoolers, and I think it will be the easiest!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>saying is that he&#39;s bored (I asked him). He does fine academically <br/>
and doesn&#39;t struggle with the work, so really I believe he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like the approach they take with things like math worksheets and <br/>
phonics etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was my dd too.   She wasn&#39;t getting good grades, but I know she <br/>
was learning (she hates traditional tests, but if she could test <br/>
verbally, she&#39;d probably ace everthing!  I was starting to try to get <br/>
the schools to allow her to test verbally, but once I decided I was <br/>
going to pull her at the end of the year, I didn&#39;t bother wasting my <br/>
time with it, just helped her get through the rest of the year).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am so grateful to have these lists to read...they are so <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wonderful!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too!   It helps me continue on the right path and help my dd with <br/>
this transition!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284738180">-----Original Message-----<br/>
From: Kendra DeSimone <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:begentleinspirit@...">begentleinspirit@...</a><br/>
 <br/>
My son is probably the type of child that would be &quot;fine&quot; in the school system. <br/>
What I mean is that he would conform and try to do his best and not complain too <br/>
much, as this is his personality.Kendra<br/>
<br/>
Karen and I are pretty excited about homeschooling, as an initial statement, <br/>
though there are significant issues that we all have to work out, as we are <br/>
talking about and emailing about every day.<br/>
-=-=-===-<br/>
I have one like that. He WAS in school from pre-K through sixth grade. He&#39;s always been an <br/>
easy and compliant child. He did fine in school and was a good student. He, too, would <br/>
have made it through high school---but he would have been SOOO damaged by the end (this would <br/>
be his senior year had he remained in school).<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I asked Frank this weekend what his thoughts were about not being in school.  <br/>
His main, repeatable statement about it is that he thought it would be easier at <br/>
home than in school. In fact, when I answered that it might not be so easy, and <br/>
it might even be harder learning at home, he asked if *just you* could teach <br/>
him.   We have to BE VERY CAREFUL not to bring him up to choose only the easy <br/>
path; and I feel pretty strongly about it.  More than you know, possibly.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Easier&quot; can have many connotations. Easier than having to raise his hand to go to <br/>
the bathroom or eat a snack or easier than being forced to &quot;learn&quot; stupid things. Most <br/>
things are easier at home than at school. Sleeping until you&#39;re rested, eating when <br/>
you&#39;re hungry, learning---and being able to THROW yourself into a passion---are all easier<br/>
at hme rather than at school!<br/>
 <br/>
I would also stress that *YOU* won&#39;t be his only &quot;teacher&quot;---Frank may be suggesting that <br/>
he&#39;d rather have &quot;school&quot; when he&#39;s with *YOU* and let his weekend time with Dad be <br/>
fun---the way it *would* be if he were in school Monday-Friday. We learn from SOOO many people<br/>
and situations, *YOU* will never be his only &quot;teacher&quot; unless you lock him up with no <br/>
outside exposure!<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care about grades, or tests, or what he actually does with his <br/>
life(artist or engineer, or whatever), but I damn sure want him to work hard at <br/>
it, and not always take the easy road.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
I&#39;m glad he doesn&#39;t care about grades and tests and that he&#39;s open to what your <br/>
son would like to make of his *own* life. BUT: I think the last statement is <br/>
blatantly idiotic. Given the choice to &quot;take the easy road&quot;---or work long and hard<br/>
on something that one cares about passionately is what a person who has been given the <br/>
freedom and who has a definite goal DOES!<br/>
 <br/>
I have many passions (I know people get tired of hearing what all I do!), but I&#39;m NOT <br/>
taking an easy road just because it&#39;s easy! I do things because they challenge me or because <br/>
I can learn more or because it&#39;s fun! <br/>
 <br/>
Beekeeping isn&#39;t easy. The easy way out would be to buy store honey! &lt;G&gt; I have two hives.<br/>
 <br/>
I could pay someone to tile my kitchen and bathroom: I CHOSE to do that myself, <br/>
learning all the way.<br/>
 <br/>
I could buy all my fruit and vegetables, but I CHOOSE to spend time in my garden <br/>
almost every day.<br/>
 <br/>
I could just buy a puppy or pick one up at the shelter. I CHOSE to raise a guide <br/>
dog puppy --- and then let him GO in five weeks! I can&#39;t imagine anything harder right now.<br/>
 <br/>
Sending a child to school is easy---well, if you don&#39;t mind getting them up early and <br/>
fighting them over homework and grades and tests and such. I CHOSE to spend more time <br/>
with my children and be involved with their lives by unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s nothing easy about putting on an unschooling conference. Guess what? I did that to. <br/>
I take the hard road often because it&#39;s something I *want* to do.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that those who avoid anything hard are the ones most damaged by schools <br/>
and creepy parents who insist that they do/learn what anyone but the *learner* decides is <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So instead of being so worried that I am killing the idea (which I am not), you <br/>
might be somewhat concerned that this is becoming a repeating theme with him, of <br/>
&quot;him not wanting things to be too hard.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Again: Creepy!<br/>
 <br/>
Things can be *very* hard for you and still be *very* easy for me. I would no <br/>
sooner take the hard way of learning how to skateboard than I would learn how to <br/>
swallow razor blades. But my son (who has done both) thinks they are easy! He won&#39;t <br/>
play with my bees though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is saying is that <br/>
he&#39;s bored (I asked him). He does fine academically and doesn&#39;t struggle with <br/>
the work, so really I believe he doesn&#39;t like the approach they take with things <br/>
like math worksheets and phonics etc. As we the unschoolers all know, of course <br/>
he&#39;s bored and would rather learn at home! But in order for me to be able to <br/>
bring him home I&#39;ve somehow got to convince the ex that our son isn&#39;t &quot;lazy&quot;.  <br/>
Ugggh it just sucks to have to defend everything I believe in...I&#39;m not sure of <br/>
the best way to go about it.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Just do what you want and learn how to put it into &quot;educationese&quot; for your <br/>
husband. Pam Sorooshian and Sandra Dodd have two great examples of unschooling curricula.<br/>
Maybe you should copy and alter them with your son&#39;s name and other local things in <br/>
your area to give to your husband. Could someone please post those links?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My other concern about unschooling in one home and homeschooling in the other <br/>
relates to the &quot;easy&quot; factor. My fear is about creating feelings for my son <br/>
about one house vs the other. Like one is easier than the other, or one is more <br/>
fun, etc. Although perhaps because of his personality he would go with the flow <br/>
well, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps it&#39;s a fear I should share with my ex. Or perhaps I <br/>
can try to ease slowly into unschooling, but doing some eclectic homeschooling <br/>
first just to ease my ex&#39;s fears.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I would simply say that he will be following *this* curriculum (like I said, look up <br/>
Pam&#39;s or Carol Narigon&#39;s and alter for your use). The child should NOT be in school <br/>
seven days per week, so his time with his dad should be FUN and NOT schooled!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142621326">I can&#39;t help it but I&#39;m concerned for my son in this<br/>
area as well.  It bothers dh something awful. He<br/>
literally never wants to do anything, he&#39;ll be<br/>
excited, but as soon as something requires a little<br/>
thought or gets a little tough, he quits. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
even want to try.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fear we have about what he&#39;ll grow up to be. <br/>
He is loving and he is a sweet kid, but my husband<br/>
believes that ds is &quot;lazy&quot;.  My husband is concerened<br/>
that 11yo ds will never know accomplishments because<br/>
he just gives up so easily, even on things that he<br/>
&quot;wants&quot; to do.  Neither my husband nor I were taught,<br/>
fishing, hunting, cleaning fish, etc.  My husband came<br/>
home the other day and asked, just asked if ds would<br/>
maybe like to sit in on a boyscout meeting because<br/>
they do stuff like that all the time.  You&#39;d of<br/>
thought dh said, &quot;You&#39;ll be a boyscout and thats<br/>
final!&quot;  But he didn&#39;t, just asked if he&#39;d like to sit<br/>
in on a meeting or two.  DS responded by rubbing his<br/>
eyes, &quot;Well, nah, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t know<br/>
anything about Boy Scouts at all, he wants to learn<br/>
all of these things, we&#39;re providing an opportunity if<br/>
he wants, but he refuses to even just take a look at<br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, he has also loved tv for years too, I<br/>
think he feels if he does something that he&#39;ll miss<br/>
out on another re-run.  For years now, when we want to<br/>
do something fun as a family, he gets upset and<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go, he&#39;d rather watch tv or play video<br/>
games.  We&#39;ll be in the front yard playing croquet and<br/>
he&#39;d rather watch television.<br/>
<br/>
He has been like this for years and frankly, I don&#39;t<br/>
see it ending and in all honesty, I am a little more<br/>
than worried myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500038113">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m more than a little worried myself&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What does your son say when you talk to him about your concerns?<br/>
<br/>
Does he have a passion?  Perhaps one sparked by TV?<br/>
<br/>
When my now 14yo was 10, she spent 4 months literally doing nothing but eating, sleeping and watching TV.  It drove me insane but I kept my mouth shut.  Then she got crabbier and crabbier and then I suggested a possible link between lack of activity and her state of mind.  EVENTUALLY, she agreed.  About the same time she was invited onto a competitive gymnastics team and now seldom has time to watch more than an hour or so per day.  She has developed many friendships, travels the state with 4-h stuff and is even taking several classes because she thinks it will up her odds of admission to a university she wants to attend.<br/>
<br/>
But during the TV days, I wouldn&#39;t have thought it would happen.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is an age thing?  Where they go through a period of needing to simply receive input rather than actively engaging in activities.<br/>

 your concerns?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He just says, &quot;Well, yeah, I don&#39;t know.&quot;  We offer<br/>
everything for him and tell him that we&#39;ll try and do<br/>
whatever he wants and desires.  Last week he wanted to<br/>
do a wood project, we had fun and he cut the boards<br/>
with a mighter saw and handsaw, all done outside, he<br/>
did great!  My hubby&#39;s garage is a disaster so we<br/>
brought our project indoors to finish it.  We needed<br/>
to make holes for dowels and he drilled a couple of<br/>
holes that were out of line, I offered to help him and<br/>
we had some spares so it was okay to make mistakes. <br/>
He just quit on me, gave up, &quot;I can&#39;t make the holes<br/>
straight&quot;, I told him that it was okay, we can<br/>
practice on this piece to help us.  Nope, that was it,<br/>
he just quit.  So, I drilled the holes and then it was<br/>
time for the dowels.  If anyone has ever worked with<br/>
dowels, you know that you can have one end in and when<br/>
you do the other the other side slips out.  After one<br/>
time of that happening, he was finished helping with<br/>
dowels.  He did put the finishing nails in with the<br/>
nail gun though, and he was good with that tool also.<br/>
If it is easy, he does it, but at the first site of<br/>
requiring effort, he quits.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted so badly to have his own webpage and he<br/>
wanted to make it by himself.  I asked him several<br/>
times, &quot;are you sure?&quot;  &quot;Yes&quot; was his answer, so I<br/>
bought a website url for him, he sat on the computer,<br/>
we went to &quot;Lizza Knows it All&quot; (can&#39;t think of the<br/>
name)  the very first instruction for building a site<br/>
and he was through, didn&#39;t want to even try.  He said,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot; then quit.  I even offered to help<br/>
him with it, his answer, &quot;No, that&#39;s alright, I just<br/>
don&#39;t want to do it.&quot;  I never got after him for the<br/>
money spent or anything but I was upset that he just<br/>
didn&#39;t even want to &quot;try&quot; to get it.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother me if he doesn&#39;t want to do something, it<br/>
bothers me that he doesn&#39;t want to ever give anything<br/>
even the slightest bit of effort.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Does he have a passion?  Perhaps one sparked by TV?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said he wants to act, so I said &quot;well, maybe we can<br/>
find something in the paper and you can audition for<br/>
something.&quot;  His reaction? Oh, you have to do things<br/>
in front of people in order to act?  I politely told<br/>
him yes, you&#39;d probably have to read a script or<br/>
something.  &quot;Well, no that&#39;s alright, nevermind.&quot;  We<br/>
can&#39;t afford acting lessons and such anyway so maybe<br/>
it&#39;s for the best.  <br/>
<br/>
He LOVES swimming but does not want to be on a swim<br/>
team in the area because they wear Speedos.  We have a<br/>
pool and when it&#39;s warm, he&#39;s out there all of the<br/>
time.  He enjoyed Karate but when he made yellow belt<br/>
and the requirements got tougher, he quit practicing<br/>
and just stayed there.  That and the other kids in<br/>
class annoyed him, he wanted to learn, they only<br/>
wanted to goof off (understable since they&#39;re in<br/>
school all day).<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps it is an age thing?  Where they go through a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; period of needing to simply receive input rather<br/>
&gt; than actively engaging in activities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ds&#39;s stage with tv and video games has lasted, thus<br/>
far, almost 6 years.  We love him and that is why we<br/>
are worried and getting frustrated.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy that your daughter found a passion, that is<br/>
so awesome.  I even mentioned perhaps finding<br/>
something in our local 4H...total resistence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572175372">Do you and/or your husband model failures and struggling to succeed? Or does he only see you do things you&#39;re *really* good at?<br/>
 <br/>
Most adults only do things we&#39;re good at. We only cook what we&#39;re used to. We only build what we know. We only draw what we&#39;re comfortable with.<br/>
 <br/>
Does he SEE you screw up???<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s *really* important! My boys have watched me learn to garden---seven years of trials and errors. I keep bees: lost half a hive this year to swarm. I burn food every now and then---so although I&#39;m a good cook, they know I&#39;m not perfect. I tiled my kitchen and bathroom: there are little mistakes here and there as I learned as I tiled! &lt;g&gt; Some I fixed; some I left and can point out to you! &lt;bwg&gt; We do art projects all the time. They see me mess up---but *sometimes* my mess-ups end up even MORE spectacular than my perfect ones. Duncan (9) and I are now fencing---and he sees me get hit all the time---even by littler kids!<br/>
 <br/>
If you and your husband never try and fail, he may not know that that is even a possibility. Show him in what *you* do that it&#39;s how we learn something new. Find new, HARD projects---have fun!<br/>
