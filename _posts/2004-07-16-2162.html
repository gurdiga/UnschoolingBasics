<div id="ygrps-yiv-288815107">Yes, champagne comes with a cork (plastic cork for cheaper <br/>
brands...)...but it&#39;s the kind you pop off, not use the corkscrew <br/>
for.  Perhaps he didn&#39;t know this and that is why it had half a <br/>
cork.  Sad that she is more concerned with her $150 bottle of <br/>
champagne than the dignity and well being of her son.  She is more <br/>
concerned with the fact that she was out $177 than the fact that her <br/>
13 year old son was drinking all weekend.  Poor kid. <br/>

month or more ago.<br/>

My thought is that that misguided mother is removing the one thing that is<br/>
likely to encourage her son to stay home for any part of his free time. She<br/>
won&#39;t have to lock her liquor cabinet since the boy will be at his friends&#39;<br/>
houses from now on instead.<br/>

<br/>
The last bottle of really expensive champagne we opened had a cork cork, not <br/>
the plastic ones shaped to look like a real cork champagne cork. A 13yo <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t know not to use a corkscrew on a champagne cork, and using one on <br/>
it would really screw it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147428679">She wasn&#39;t out $177 -- she hadn&#39;t bought the champagne, it was a gift.  And how long ago (if ever) did she pay $51 for the bugle? Had the bugle been played/used/enjoyed for a period of time worth $51?  I&#39;ll bet it had been quite used, or it would have been much easier to re-sell it to her local music store or pawn shop for more than $50. Sounds to me like they were only out $6 for beer.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sadly, this sounds like just the kind of thing my Mom would have done, and like my sister would at least consider in her parenting.  I remember my Mom destroying my sister&#39;s collectible knick-knacks once after sis accidentally (carelessly)broke something of Mom&#39;s.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just a parent having a tantrum and being vindictive.  It won&#39;t teach any valuable lessons, but it will destroy any last shred of trust and respect the child had for his parents.  <br/>
 <br/>
Or maybe it&#39;s all just a made-up story designed to bring in higher bids from people who would feel a parent is justified in behaving in such a way.  blech.<br/>
