<div id="ygrps-yiv-382999361">Way back when ds was attending a Montessori school the headmistress had this<br/>
policy:  If they don&#39;t want to get dressed, let them come in their pajamas.<br/>
If they get there and do feel embarrassed, they are free to change into<br/>
clothes from their cubby, which all kids had in case of spills or accidents.<br/>
Lots of kids did this from time to time.  Some thought it was fun or funny<br/>
to wear their pj&#39;s to school and others just wanted to see what would<br/>
happen.  I&#39;m sure some were trying to communicate that they didn&#39;t want to<br/>
go to school that day.  Those kids would have to move on to stomachaches I<br/>
guess to get out of school.  Sad, but the reason I mention it is to show how<br/>
different it looks when the idea is to go with the kid&#39;s choice as opposed<br/>
to &quot;letting him learn his lesson.&quot;  I agree that I am the mom, a little<br/>
older and perhaps with access to more information sometimes.  That is why I<br/>
might grab a set of clothes I know he likes, knowing he might feel<br/>
differently when we get there.  Better yet, knowing what I know now, I&#39;d<br/>
declare that he doesn&#39;t have to go at all if he doesn&#39;t want to.  Wish I&#39;d<br/>
done that more back then.  We may have come to home schooling sooner!</div>
