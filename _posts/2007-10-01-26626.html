Karen, I think you might be mixing what I see as 2 forms of  unschooling. One <br/>
kind is Radical Unschooling, which is a way of life, of  living with your <br/>
children, including educational style. The other one, is based  more in <br/>
educational style i.e.; no curriculum, total freedom for the child to  follow their <br/>
interests, joy-driven learning. I&#39;m becoming more and more radical  as time <br/>
passes, and it&#39;s freeing and soothing to me and to the kids. I don&#39;t  know how <br/>
&quot;far&quot; I&#39;ll go (I guess you could say), but with each change, my  children and I <br/>
respond better to one another, it&#39;s more fulfilling than ever  before and we are <br/>
enjoying one another more. It&#39;s not at ALL the child-king  situation that I <br/>
see you being concerned about. Or Lord of the Flies-esque. If  so, we&#39;d all be <br/>
loosing our minds and not be as happy as these families are  and I am. Rather, <br/>
this is a different type of hands-on parenting. It&#39;s just  a matter of <br/>
equality - we and our children are not the same. We are different,  with different <br/>
needs and wants and tastes. But we are still equal, and children  can be an <br/>
equal part of the family - it&#39;s almost like...in proportion to the  whole family, <br/>
I see it kind of like this: A new baby plays a strong  role in the family, <br/>
but not on decision making things. Babies of course can&#39;t  chose their clothes, <br/>
the carpet we buy or the color of the car or whatever we  are doing, but as <br/>
they age, they can and do. No reason NOT to allow that to  happen! And as they <br/>
age, they way they bring their ideas into the family, makes  for more and more <br/>
equality in more and more areas of the house...<br/>
 <br/>
Ugh, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m explaining this well. I&#39;m trying to show the process  <br/>
of how I see RU happening from birth on. When coming to it later on, it&#39;s <br/>
choppy  sometimes and can be a difficult transition. It may appear as you are <br/>
describing  it, but I can assure you, it isn&#39;t like that at all. I&#39;m not cow-towing <br/>
to my  children - and neither are they, to me. <br/>
 <br/>
I apologize if this made no sense. I&#39;m fighting a cold and the baby got up  <br/>
during this letter writing and I had a few more interruptions, lol, and I&#39;m  <br/>
tired. But I wanted a chance to try and be better understood. <br/>
 <br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776715157">Thank you Karen!  That really is all I&#39;m trying to get.  It&#39;s radically<br/>
different from how life looks to me at least from a wide angle view.  Here<br/>
my kids (11 and 9) do help decide what&#39;s for dinner.  They pick out their<br/>
own clothes (within reason) and they collaborated with us on the new<br/>
furniture we bought.  BUT we made the final decision.  What I&#39;ve been<br/>
reading *looks like* kids get the final say no matter what and that is both<br/>
different and to my mind irresponsible.  And no, not just on this list.<br/>
Other places too.  I&#39;ve been doing a pretty hefty amount of reading.  One<br/>
site mentioned her daughter (age 4) has been eating only ice cream for 6<br/>
months because that&#39;s all she&#39;s wanted!  The writer was joyous about this.<br/>
It&#39;s these kinds of things that have me befuddled.  If this is what is meant<br/>
by the philosophy well, I can&#39;t abdicate parenting.  That&#39;s negligence.  If<br/>
it&#39;s more a matter of treating kids like they have a brain in their heads<br/>
and can be a part of life then that&#39;s totally different and how I&#39;ve been<br/>
raising mine all along.  HOWEVER, I still insist they move their bodies, try<br/>
to eat well, and clean their rooms and bathroom.  They are a part of the<br/>
family, not reigning over it.<br/>
<br/>
But I thank you for your honest attempt at an explaination.  That was very<br/>
kind of you. I hope you get to feeling better soon! =)<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
