<div id="ygrps-yiv-637347011"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;You are SO RIGHT. Unfortunately, no insurance company will give me life <br/>
 </span></blockquote>insurance. I had ALL (acute lymphocytic leuk) when I was in my TWENTIES (I<br/>
am <br/>
almost in my 40&#39;s now) and they still will not write me a policy! I am so <br/>
totally in remission. As a matter of fact, people I know who were never sick<br/>
are <br/>
way more at risk for dropping dead soon than I am being that I care for my<br/>
body <br/>
with such great thought! GRRR. It is such a disappointment :-(&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just so happens insurance is what I do for a living and I am here to bring<br/>
you good news!  In spite of your health, you can have life insurance.  There<br/>
are some companies that will write you a &quot;guarantee issue&quot; life policy.<br/>
That means regardless of your health you will get issued.  There is<br/>
generally a 3 year window where if you die from health issues your<br/>
beneficiary will only receive your premiums back plus some interest.  But,<br/>
if you die from an accident then the full face amount will be given.  It is<br/>
a little harder to find when you are under 40 yo because you need to be<br/>
careful what company you use and that the AM Best rating is at least an &#39;A&#39;<br/>
However once you turn 46 I know of a couple great companies you could look<br/>
into.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Another way to guarantee you have life insurance is if you or your spouse is<br/>
working where they offer benefits.  Work term life is cheap, cheap, cheap.<br/>
Max out on it!  Don&#39;t let it be all you have,  especially if you are healthy<br/>
because with work policies you won&#39;t own them and you loose them when you<br/>
leave.  You always need to have something you own and I recommend that part<br/>
of what you do is a Whole Life policy paid up at 65.  When you are our age,<br/>
you generally need to couple that with a larger Term policy to meet the<br/>
needs at the time.<br/>
<br/>

My dh and I have my sister and her dh as guardians should something happen<br/>
to both of us.  We have made provisions through life insurance to make sure<br/>
my sister would have plenty to raise them and there is enough to be set<br/>
aside for both of our girls to begin there lives.  We have also made it<br/>
clear that my sister is to sell her home ( and ours) and build or find a<br/>
home with land that would accommodate our animals in their area.  That is<br/>
very important to our girls.  My sister actually brought this up to me (just<br/>
so you don&#39;t think I am being overboard with my demands).  Unfortunately she<br/>
does not understand nor choose to understand unschooling, but I know my<br/>
girls love her and her dh and emotionally they would take very good care of<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Wow, I didn&#39;t mean to get so wordy.  As you can tell this is something I am<br/>
VERY passionate about.  If anyone has specific questions and would like to<br/>
e-mail me off list, please feel free. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
