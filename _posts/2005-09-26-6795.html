<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098841178">&quot;You&#39;ve ALWAYS been the hotlink fairy, haven&#39;t you???? &lt;G&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OOOh....that would totally make sense. You know, those quiet ones that<br/>
are stealthy and crafty!<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time I really thought the hot link fairy was Joyce, and<br/>
she was visiting Sandra, so I played the hotlink fairy that night to<br/>
cover for her...only to find out it WASN&#39;T Joyce after all. Darn!<br/>
