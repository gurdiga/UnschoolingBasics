&gt;  ***I buy into that theory COMPLETELY Sandra. Sure is hard to stay away from <br/>
&gt; though! It seems like I&#39;ve read somewhere before that sugar is one of the <br/>
&gt; many things that we DON&#39;T need to ingest extra into our bodies, that our body <br/>
&gt; makes it&#39;s own sugar, that we certainly don&#39;t need to supplement it and that <br/>
&gt; in doing so, it can only cause all of the things listed in that article you <br/>
