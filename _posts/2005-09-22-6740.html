<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917626643">Good Morning Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My ds asked this morning if he could get a Chemistry<br/>
Set.  I was hoping we could get some recommendations<br/>
from people who&#39;ve used them before we spend money on<br/>
one that sucks...LOL  We have zero experience in this<br/>
area, he&#39;s 11.  Hopefully we can find a set that would<br/>
be fun and challenging but not in a way that would be<br/>
discouraging because of being to difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456337923">We purchased the Smithsonian MicroChemistry set.  XM5000.  It looks great...but in truth we haven&#39;t begun to use it yet.  Roxanne has always &quot;concocted&quot; and expresses interest in chemistry.  So now it is in the house for when she is ready to use it.  I purchased it from a Museum on the west coast.  Do an internet search and you will find it.<br/>
