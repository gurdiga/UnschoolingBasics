<div id="ygrps-yiv-231016634">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My 10 year old thinks he<br/>
can just say whatever he wants to me and he&#39;s been hitting his <br/>
brother (the<br/>
7 year old).  The 14 year old has been instigating a lot of fights <br/>
between<br/>
the 2 younger boys.  They don&#39;t bathe, and they get FILTHY!!!  They <br/>
have<br/>
become lazy and sullen, they stay up all night and sleep half the <br/>
day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, you got some great advice on this subject!  I think the main <br/>
thing to remember is that it is not about NO rules and limits, it is <br/>
about NO ARBITRARY rules and limits, and I do prefer the principle <br/>
approach over the &quot;rules&quot;.  If things make sense most kids are more <br/>
than willing to go along with it.  For me it is is more about <br/>
respecting them as a fellow human beings not some puppet to be <br/>
controlled.  It is more about helping them and guiding as they make <br/>
their own choices that are unique only to them.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the house deserves to be safe, and that means safe from <br/>
physical, verbal, and emotional harm.  It is something we struggle <br/>
with in our home so don&#39;t think that all unschoolers live this <br/>
perfectly peaceful life all the time.  One thing that my sister Ren <br/>
has taught me over the last couple weeks while we were staying with <br/>
them is that distraction is a WONDERFUL tool!!!!  I tend to sit <br/>
there and say &quot;Stop that, that is not okay.&quot; until I am so fed up <br/>
that I get agitated.  The other day the kids were outside playing <br/>
but their tone indicated that they were getting a little irritated <br/>
with each other; Ren went outside and said &quot;Hey, you guys want to <br/>
build a fire and have s&#39;mores?&quot;  Talk about a distraction!  We went <br/>
and built a fire and the kids started laughing again and forgot all <br/>
about whatever was irritating them.  Sometimes they just need a <br/>
change of pace.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids definitely go through down times (I prefer to not call it <br/>
laziness) when there is changes of any kind going on in our family.  <br/>
I do know though that if you just plan some fun, interesting things <br/>
that they will most likely want to join you.  Even my son who spends <br/>
HOURS on the computer every day and seems to never come out of his <br/>
room will join us if there is something interesting going on.  <br/>
Something as simple as Art Trading Cards.  Something else that we do <br/>
periodically (another one of Rens suggestions) is to just get in the <br/>
car and drive, I let the kids tell me whether to turn right, left or <br/>
go straight.  Wherever we end up we go in and check it out.  You <br/>
will be amazed where you end up.  One day we ended up at Joanns <br/>
Fabrics and ended up making mittens that day!  <br/>
<br/>
Be patient because you are in the process of redefining your life <br/>
really and it takes time to figure it out.  I do agree with the <br/>
advice that you got about not letting go of everything at one time; <br/>
that can be overwhelming for kids who aren&#39;t used to having lots of <br/>
choices.  Just say yes more often and slowly let go of arbitrary <br/>
rules, negotiate more so that everyone in the family gets at least a <br/>
part of what they want, and make YOUR life really interesting; <br/>
invest in your own passions and interests and see how that effects <br/>
the whole family!!<br/>

ps about the showers and filthiness:  I have one that only showers <br/>
once a week or so and as long as he doesn&#39;t effect the rest of us <br/>
too bad I don&#39;t say much but something you can do to encourage <br/>
regular showers is to make the bathroom a fun place to be with great <br/>
decorations, bright colored towels, fun soaps, good smelling <br/>
shampoo, etc.  Don&#39;t know if it will work but my kids love that kind <br/>
of thing!!</div>
