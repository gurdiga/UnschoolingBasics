<div id="ygrps-yiv-534477324">Hi there..I am a new member and have been lurking for a bit to get a feel<br/>
for the list.  My name is Shannon.  I am a 40 yr old Mom to three fantastic<br/>
kids.  Two dd&#39;s, 10 and 8, and a ds, just 3.  We live in Ontario, on a rural<br/>
property.  Our kids have been homeschooled in an unschooled fashion from the<br/>
start. I watched them grow from infants to toddlers to young children,<br/>
soaking up everything around them and learning at an amazing speed.  I<br/>
figured why mess with that success by teaching them anything.  I see my role<br/>
as faciliator, or tour guide, along their journey.  I joined this list on<br/>
the recommendation of a fellow homeschooling support group member.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I have had much experience on a variety of lists and<br/>
homeschooling boards, so I know not everyone will agree.  I think alot of<br/>
wonderful information can come out of debates.  I also realize that not<br/>
everything will come packaged just the way I personally prefer it and have<br/>
developed the skill of taking what I need and leaving the rest.  I find<br/>
myself in a very comfortable place in our journey.  We all are finding what<br/>
is working for us, is working for us.  When it isn&#39;t, we make the necessary<br/>
adjustments. So I don&#39;t feel the need to be defensive about where we are or<br/>
what we are doing. Or justify our choices.  <br/>
<br/>
As a newbie, for the most part, I am finding the posts helpful, informative<br/>
and can sense that the overall intent is quite genuinely helpful..looking<br/>
forward to reading more and getting to know all of you as time goes by.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shannon<br/>
