<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791688337">&quot;Over the years I&#39;ve heard so many people talk about how much they love<br/>
D&D, but I have no clue what the game is about- can someone please<br/>

on another player as they climbed a ladder in a castle. The DM (being<br/>
a really good DM) made it part of the game. That particular player<br/>
tended to run off at the mouth at really bad times...the fart caused a<br/>
lot of problems for their party (some creature woke up or something)<br/>
and he learned to SHUT UP at key moments.:)<br/>

Kristin, I actually ordered a D&D giftset for Tristan about a week ago from Amazon.  It arrived a few nights ago, and it hasn&#39;t left Tristan&#39;s sight!  It contained the basic three books that Ren mentioned, and it cost about $55.  We found a large bag of dh&#39;s old dice so have been using those instead of getting new.  <br/>
<br/>
It does seem quite complicated, especially for those of us that have never played.  In college I spent many an hour watching friends play but never ended up playing myself.  Yesterday I joked with dh that I need &quot;D&D for Dummies,&quot; only to search on Amazon and discover that there is, indeed, a &quot;D&D for Dummies&quot;! LOL  <br/>
<br/>
Last night T pulled out the books and decided that we needed to play.  This was strictly &quot;D&D according to Tristan.&quot;  He had me pick two dice that I liked (I think one was a 20-sided and the other a 30-sided), and he started me off on an adventure.  He&#39;s nine, has never played before, and has only flipped though the books, mainly the &quot;Monster Manual.&quot;  He had me wandering around through catacombs....finding chests (sometimes discovering gold or armor, other times finding traps), fighting off various monsters, falling through floors, and having magical creatures (a pegasus and a hippogriff) accompany me.  He had me rolling my dice for attack points, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One day we may get around to learning the &quot;real&quot; rules of D&D (most likely when my D&D guru DH gets back from Iraq), but for now we are having such fun with our own rules. :o)<br/>

<br/>
That might be a good way to start with a younger child too. I know<br/>
it&#39;s a bit on the complicated side for Sierra (8) though she&#39;s trying<br/>
to pick up on the basics.<br/>
It depends on the person of course as far as age, but it&#39;s definitely<br/>
not a great game for really young players. Heck, it&#39;s too complicated<br/>
for ME!;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322721614">As a long time seller of D&D (yes, I owned a game/hobby store for <br/>
many years), I explain it to new parents as thus:<br/>
It&#39;s a story telling game, like creating a script for a movie.  <br/>
The &quot;Writer&quot; guides the &quot;actors&quot; along through a series of events.  <br/>
He may decide the group will encounter a Troll today and the players <br/>
tell him how they would react and they use dice to randomly <br/>
determine the outcome of some events and actions.  It&#39;s a great way <br/>
for them to learn.  It encourages reading, strategic thought, <br/>
planning and, best of all, gets them interacting with friends and <br/>
off the PlayStation.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
To get started there are &quot;Starter Sets&quot; that have a basic guide for <br/>
the Game Master (A Dungeon Master&#39;s guide or DM&#39;s guide), a Players <br/>
Guide (PH or Players Handbook) and they usually include dice and a <br/>
scenario.  Many players these days use maps and expand the hobby <br/>
into painting of miniatures.  This is great hand-eye coordination, <br/>
by the way.  <br/>
<br/>
The only concern with buying a Starter Set for older kids (13+) is <br/>
that they will quickly want the full versions of the books.  So just <br/>
buy the Dm&#39;s Guide and PH books and some dice and let &#39;em at it.  <br/>
Packaged adventures are numerous and quality companies include TSR <br/>
(Wizards of the Coast) and White Wolf (Sword & Sorcery line).  Check <br/>
out rpg.net for reviews and they have an online store, as well.  <br/>
However, there are many etailers with 30% off as a standard pricing <br/>
for supplements.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about the latest generation of D&D is that it has a <br/>
standard &quot;play engine.&quot;  Which means once you learn the &quot;D20&quot; rules, <br/>
you can play in any environment.  There are books for sci fi, <br/>
fantasy, and tv shows that all use the same &quot;engine.&quot;  So the game <br/>
itself is flexible and already has a ton of options for players.<br/>
<br/>
There is probably a hobby shop in your area that carries the games <br/>
and they may even have a game room or at least a bulletin board so <br/>
you can find other players.  I always advise parents to keep them in <br/>
the same age group if you can.  Some &quot;older&quot; players (both in years <br/>
and in play experience) don&#39;t always cater and take the time to let <br/>
the new players explore and learn the nuances of the game.  Once <br/>
they&#39;re hooked, though, there are conventions all over the US.  The <br/>
largest is GenCon held in Indianapolis usually in August.  <br/>
(Wizards.com for more info)  There is also a nationally recognized <br/>
play system called &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; which allows players to rank <br/>
and when they follow this set of rules, they can take the characters <br/>
they create to play at the national tournaments and score prizes.<br/>
<br/>
Probably more than you wanted to know, but there you are!<br/>
Good Luck and Happy Gaming!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d actually ask the D&D addicted brother-in-law if he&#39;d be willing  <br/>
to help you set up characters and DM for you (be the Dungeon Master-- <br/>
choose or create a story module for you to play, and guide you  <br/>
through it) rather than lending stuff. It&#39;s tricky to figure out D&D  <br/>
on your own. Friends and I had tried it many times but I only really  <br/>
got into the game when an experienced DM started a new game for  <br/>
beginners. And then it was great and I played regularly for a long  <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
I miss the all-nighters...the 3 a.m. &quot;Summon Pizza&quot; spell &lt;g&gt;. I  <br/>
actually miss my character almost like she&#39;s a person I never get to  <br/>
see anymore. Sigh.<br/>
