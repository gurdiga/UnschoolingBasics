<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207333478">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the cross post here. I know many of you are on both lists I&#39;m<br/>
sending this to, but I&#39;m hoping someone will be able to direct me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend with a son who has Tourette Syndrome. His son has had to<br/>
endure abuse and mistreatment from both students and teachers at school. My<br/>
friend is seriously considering taking his son out of school and<br/>
homeschooling him. When I spoke with my friend about this, and about<br/>
unschooling specifically, he said it was the first thing that sounded<br/>
hopeful to him. He asked if there were families who were unschooling with<br/>
children with Tourette&#39;s. I seem to remember people posting about this. If<br/>
you are unschooling, and have a child with Tourette&#39;s, would you be willing<br/>
to contact me off-list? I&#39;d like to help my friend in any way I can, but I<br/>
have no direct experience with this particular set of circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
