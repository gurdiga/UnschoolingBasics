<div id="ygrps-yiv-90542377">Here are two (of many) books you might enjoy on the benefits of gaming...<br/>
(I took the review clips from amazon.com)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom--I&#39;m Learning! by Marc Prensky<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Prensky debunks the accepted wisdom that video games are harmful to<br/>
children. Instead, he contends that games can teach a multitude of<br/>
skills, including problem solving, language and cognitive skills,<br/>
strategic thinking, multitasking, and parallel processing. He cites<br/>
research showing the benefits of games in teaching skills children<br/>
will need in a twenty-first-century economy, pointing to the military<br/>
use of games to teach strategy, laproscopic surgeons who play games as<br/>
a &quot;warm-up&quot; before surgery, and entrepreneurs who played games growing<br/>
up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everything Bad is Good for You by Steven Johnson<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Worried about how much time your children spend playing video games?<br/>
Don&#39;t be, advises Johnsonâ€”not only are they learning valuable<br/>
problem-solving skills, they&#39;d probably do better on an IQ test than<br/>
you or your parents could at their age...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
enjoy!<br/>
