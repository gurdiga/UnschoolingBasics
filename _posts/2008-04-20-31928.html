<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179423023">I pulled this out of another thread:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I see unschooling like a grocery store. Some parents would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>say, &quot;Eat<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what you want.&quot; That is their style. I do not want my child to eat<br/>
&gt; Twinkies, so I say, &quot;You can eat anything in the produce <br/>
 </span></blockquote>department.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rather than starting out by setting a limit, and trying to make the <br/>
world smaller, why not leap straight to the infinite possiblities? <br/>
<br/>
*Hey, look at this really weird looking fruit? shall we take it home <br/>
and try it? <br/>
*Ooooooh, that cheese smells good, lets get some of that! <br/>
*Wow, this bread has a neat texture. Should we get one or two?<br/>
*I wonder what the difference is between &quot;marinated&quot; and &quot;in <br/>
brine&quot;... what the heck, lets get both.<br/>
<br/>
Even foods that have less nutritional value, there are options <br/>
besides &quot;lets skip this aisle&quot; - options that allow you to make the <br/>
world bigger for your family. Taste test different brands and <br/>
varieties, for example. Compare ready made and home made, or all <br/>
natural ingredients, or organic. Talk about ingredients and <br/>
nutrition and different aspects of health - not in a judgemental <br/>
way, but an informative way.<br/>
<br/>
My 6yo often asks me questions about the nutritional content of food <br/>
and likes to wild-harvest, and she&#39;s eaten Twinkies, too. When she&#39;s <br/>
really hungry, she wants foods that have some oomph to them. She <br/>
*wants* to be healthy - but she doesn&#39;t want me to make her <br/>
decisions for her, even with the best of intentions. She wants to <br/>
think about things. I *want* her to think about things. I don&#39;t want <br/>
her to just take anoyone&#39;s word for something - not even mine.<br/>
