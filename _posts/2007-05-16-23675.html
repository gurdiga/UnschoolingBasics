<br/>
There was a long posting on AlwaysUnschooled by Robyn<br/>
about a similar situation. If I remember right Jayn<br/>
had an infected tooth and needed antibiotics. Maybe<br/>
someone with a better memory can find it and post a<br/>

<br/>
Robin, what a stressful situation.  I&#39;m so sorry for your little girl.  You <br/>
must all be feeling so tired and overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
 How does the antibiotic taste?  If it&#39;s awful can you ask for another kind?<br/>
<br/>
Would she take it if you took it too?  Would she take it herself if you let <br/>
her be in charge? (with your help)<br/>
<br/>
Is she afraid taking it will hurt?  Can you get a liquid version in a <br/>
dropper?    Would she take it in a spoon or cup?<br/>

  What an ordeal for all of you!  I can understand why she&#39;d be cranky and violent -- more than just the physical pain, is the sheer terror she must have felt with the attack.  I&#39;d expect the crankies to continue for some time.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Given the severity of her injuries and the infection risk at hospital ER&#39;s and also once she&#39;s home, along with the dog germies, I&#39;d definitely do all I could to get the meds into her.<br/>
   <br/>
  About the meds --  they gave you pills for a 3yo?  Would she take a liquid med?  I remember that augmentin can be mixed into almost any flavor.  Another option might be IV antiobiotix at home, or even IM (intra-muscular) shots at home.  When Andy came home from the hospital as a newborn, he was on IV anti-bios.  The hospital wanted to train me to do his meds thru a heparin port, but I insisted they send a home nurse out to do it for us.  Poor little guy had had so many IV&#39;s in his first four days that most of his veins were unusable for more ports.  On his second day at home, the &#39;last vein option&#39; for homecare collapsed, and the docs wanted him back in NICU. The home nurse (an absolute angel, that woman) argued with the doctor that Andy would do better at home where he could still nurse on demand, getting IM shots than going back to NICU.  She came by twice a day and did the shots for him, which meant he stayed home.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d ask about IV meds you (or a nurse) could administer at home, or shots, even if that meant daily trips to the doctor&#39;s office or home visits by a nurse. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619546618">If she does not have an infection then the antibotics are just in case. Do you know anything about the dog? has it had shots and what not. My son was also bit in the lip and did not get an infection it was a watch it to see and then we would have to treat that but they did not automatically put him on one. If you do not want to go to the hospital is there somewhere else you can take her- instant care- urgent care? If you do not want the hospital involved then I would suggest watching for infection that right now is not there. Try to get a liquid medicine that is flavored. why does she not want to take anything?<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
They gave us the liquid at first.  We took it to our pharmacy yesterday and <br/>
had it re-flavored to grape and they also added an anti-bitter agent but she <br/>
still refuses it.  Her issues with taking it is that it tastes &quot;really bad.&quot;  <br/>
We&#39;ve all tried it to show her it&#39;s not *that bad*  and we all made yummy noises <br/>
etc.  Her response to that was that if we like, then we can eat it.  I also <br/>
have the augmentin in tablet form and have crushed that into every possible <br/>
food/candy/frozen treat we could come up with and we also have it in chewable <br/>
tablet form but they are bigger and taste worse than the adult unflavored <br/>
version.  I must admit, it tastes like poison -- she&#39;s right.  I put the grape <br/>
flavored stuff in a concentrated version of kool-aid and in grape jello and other <br/>
purple stuff I thought would hide the taste but nothing can hide the horrible <br/>
taste.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m weary about taking her to the ER for an IV because I know she&#39;d hate that <br/>
more than being held down.  I&#39;m going to call the doctor and ask about home <br/>
IV/IM shots.  That seems so much easier.  This is my third child and she has <br/>
been unschooled all her life and she expects and insists that everyone treat her <br/>
well and would be devastated if we ever held her down.  I&#39;m amazed at how <br/>
easily the doctors and pharmacists suggest it as a solution.  When I threatened <br/>
to hold her and force her yesterday she laughed at me (and I was in a very <br/>
serious state) and *knew* I must be joking.  She trusts us not to do that to her.  <br/>
My older kids took me seriously, though and started coming up with other <br/>
solutions to help avoid that route.  I was hoping that someone on this list would <br/>
have some magic words or brilliant ideas for helping her understand the <br/>
importance of taking the meds that I hadn&#39;t considered.  So????<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin, still fretting and trying to administer the meds but taking a breather <br/>
to reconsider all our options.  The 3 year old is playing joyfully and has no <br/>
worries.  Childhood is so precious and wonderful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142326540">Augmentin is the ONLY antibiotic DS can take (basic stuff does nothing<br/>
and he&#39;s allergic to sulfas). Yes, it is available as a liquid - one<br/>
that can be mixed into a variety of flavors. Also, FWIW, the first dose<br/>
always comes back out again with DS - whether it&#39;s with food or not,<br/>
within 2 hours it comes back up, repeated vomiting about once an hour<br/>
for 2 or 3 hours then he&#39;s okay and his system tolerates it (which is<br/>
why we try to avoid the whole thing whenever possible). It&#39;s just a<br/>
really -strong- thing for his system on that first &quot;hit&quot;. Come to think<br/>
of it, it&#39;s been quite a long time since we&#39;ve seen any need for it<br/>
(even the dr we see isn&#39;t big on jumping right into an Rx - not a<br/>
pediatrician, a GP, he&#39;s a basic family doctor who tends to look a bit<br/>
more holistically at the situation than some doctors I&#39;ve known and is<br/>
willing to let the body try to heal itself first before intervening, and<br/>
relies heavily on my input and DS&#39; in regard to how he&#39;s feeling and<br/>
what action to take).<br/>
 <br/>
Definitely need to get the meds in given the nature of the injuries.<br/>
But, I can also see how that would seem like an additional invasion of<br/>
her person right now while all of her defenses are still on high alert.<br/>
One thing I might do, in addition to the arnica she&#39;s taking, is try<br/>
something like Rescue Remedy or one/a couple of the more specific Bach<br/>
essences that are for trauma, anxiety, etc. That might bring the<br/>
residual stress level down enough that she&#39;d be willing to take a liquid<br/>
antibiotic.Good heavens, my almost 9 yr old still prefers liquid meds<br/>
and my 39 yr old hubby probably would too - swallowing pills is not<br/>
something he likes (but at least I don&#39;t have to crush stuff up for him!<br/>
lol)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938983002">Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeopath in California.  I won&#39;t tell you that homeopathy can <br/>
or cant prevent infection.  It would depend on too many variables.  <br/>
Some possible suggestions are:  First, perhaps your homeopath (who I <br/>
assume has taken your dd&#39;s case) can give her something to calm <br/>
down.  Perhaps she needs ledum (for puncture wounds), or Lys. (rabies <br/>
for anger caused by the whole experience) or aconite (for shock and <br/>
fear).  I would also recommend that you talk to your homeopath about <br/>
treating you for shock and fear.  <br/>
If all else fails, perhaps you and her could take rescue remedy and <br/>
then try to get her to take the antibiotics after a few doses.<br/>
<br/>
I am sending you lots of good energy and knowing that all is well.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

 <br/>
Exactly and in the past, we&#39;ve always gone the watch and wait route but this <br/>
time my instincts are screaming to me otherwise.  She was at a party when this <br/>
happened.  The kids had all been playing near a dead rat that the cat had <br/>
brought home.  The dog had been batting the rat around, too.  Madison&#39;s face was <br/>
filthy, the wounds are deep and the dog tore the skin off her cheek so that is <br/>
not only deep but is rather large as well.  She has several other wounds as <br/>
well, stitches in three places and two deep puncture wounds. The hospital was <br/>
filthy and full of sick and injured children.  The staff was repeatedly <br/>
careless with regard to universal precautions, etc. My gut tells me that she needs <br/>
the antibiotics so I&#39;m looking for respectful ways to help us get them into her <br/>
body.  I have considered whether my desire to have the antibiotics in her body <br/>
is coming from my fear or where but the truth is -- the wounds look like they <br/>
could become infected.  Her face is a mess and I feel like she needs to avoid <br/>
further physical problems at this point by preventing infection.  <br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas on how to kindly help her understand why we want her to take the <br/>
meds without talking about all the scary horrors and my fears?  I tried the <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; suggestion and her response was that she doesn&#39;t have to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053577390">First of all, I&#39;m sorry for all the trauma your whole family is going through. I&#39;m sure your <br/>
daughter is twice as shocked, esp reading follow up posts where she has never been <br/>
forced to do anything against her will, and a dog biting you against your will is pretty <br/>
much the ultimate insult.<br/>
Next, i would ask why you assume that informing your daughter of the possibility of <br/>
infection as &#39;passing on fears&#39;? It is probable that this will happen, to some extent. I would <br/>
say it&#39;s far more respectful to tell her and let her make an educated choice, Wounds of this <br/>
type are prone to infection, an infection is the body&#39;s way of fighting germs that don&#39;t <br/>
belong there. Those germs came from the dog, and probably some from the other sick <br/>
people at the hospital. If there are too many infection causing germs, it could make you <br/>
much more sick and it would hurt worse than it does now. <br/>
Of course, how you phrase it depends on your daughter&#39;s understanding, but we&#39;ve kind of <br/>
always presented it as a choice. I just don&#39;t see it as passing on fear, it&#39;s not unreasonable, <br/>
it&#39;s realistic. What are you going to do when she doesn&#39;t want the IV either? <br/>
My daughter was seven last year, so a bit older, but something similar. A spider bite <br/>
allowed for the introduction of staph bacteria, and she wound up with an abcess behind <br/>
her knee, with MRSA. There was one way that the doctor wanted to handle it, straight to <br/>
surgery to pull back skin and muscle, flush the entire wound and restitch. *I* personally <br/>
did not want that for her, but after talking to the dr there were some alternatives. She <br/>
chose to have it drained in the office, without painkillers because it would be the quickest <br/>
way to handle it. She also chose to take the antibiotics because the dr explained that it <br/>
was very unlikely that it would heal without surgery. She wanted to take the antibiotics, <br/>
and she chose a rather painful course, having the abcess drained, and several days at <br/>
home of draining, because she was educated to the alternatives, and she was able to <br/>
choose.<br/>
I think i&#39;d say quite reasonably, here are the choices and some possible outcomes. I know <br/>
they all suck, but we need to pick one pretty soon before an infection sets in and gets out <br/>
of hand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654664787">This is the Nurse in me talking.    I agree with how bad you are explanning the wounds she deffiently needs the antibiotics.....  Personally if she wont take the meds by mouth some antibiotics can be given rectally I know its not something that is wanted to be done but to get the meds in her if it was the only way then I would personally do it.  Infections like that can turn deathly I hate to say.  I had my best friend recently die from a broken foot that turned into staff infection.  Not only is that one bad but you also have MRSA out there too not good infections to take a chance on.  No Im not trying to scare you at all just giving my personal Nursing advice.<br/>

If she does not have an infection then the antibotics are just in case. <br/>
<br/>
Exactly and in the past, we&#39;ve always gone the watch and wait route but this <br/>
time my instincts are screaming to me otherwise. She was at a party when this <br/>
happened. The kids had all been playing near a dead rat that the cat had <br/>
brought home. The dog had been batting the rat around, too. Madison&#39;s face was <br/>
filthy, the wounds are deep and the dog tore the skin off her cheek so that is <br/>
not only deep but is rather large as well. She has several other wounds as <br/>
well, stitches in three places and two deep puncture wounds. The hospital was <br/>
filthy and full of sick and injured children. The staff was repeatedly <br/>
careless with regard to universal precautions, etc. My gut tells me that she needs <br/>
the antibiotics so I&#39;m looking for respectful ways to help us get them into her <br/>
body. I have considered whether my desire to have the antibiotics in her body <br/>
is coming from my fear or where but the truth is -- the wounds look like they <br/>
could become infected. Her face is a mess and I feel like she needs to avoid <br/>
further physical problems at this point by preventing infection. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how to kindly help her understand why we want her to take the <br/>
meds without talking about all the scary horrors and my fears? I tried the <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; suggestion and her response was that she doesn&#39;t have to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421807019">When Liam was really young (about 3, I guess),  he had Lyme <br/>
disease.  His dad also, coincidentally, had Lyme at the same time and <br/>
he was treating it (ultimately, successfully) with alternative <br/>
medicine.  The doc I was using could have treated Liam <br/>
homeopathically or allopathically, the choice was ours to <br/>
make.  Jimmy was having to take a ton of nasty-tasting remedies eight <br/>
times a day, including raw garlic and goldenseal, and he was also <br/>
enduring second-stage Lyme, which was very painful.  Because Liam&#39;s <br/>
titers were so high, the doc strongly recommended the allopathic <br/>
route (antibiotics) with complementary homeopathic therapy to support <br/>
him through it.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Liam had never had refined sugar in his young life, and <br/>
he really balked at the amoxicillin, which he had to take for three <br/>
weeks.  Although he didn&#39;t like it at all for about the first week <br/>
and a half, I was honest with him about the alternatives for treating <br/>
it (I didn&#39;t scare him or make it seem like it was gloom or doom; I <br/>
presented the medication to him as a choice he could make, along with <br/>
other choices, such as treating it the way Jimmy was doing it, and <br/>
not treating it at all, and what the various outcomes would likely <br/>
be).  He opted, as I hoped he would, for the meds, and for the first <br/>
week and a half, he hated the amox, but then (unfortunately) it grew <br/>
on him.  He also took the complementary stuff (including the <br/>
probiotic), and he did great!<br/>
<br/>
He got Lyme again about two years later, and he was cool with the <br/>
whole thing (even drawing the blood, which he regarded with <br/>
curiosity; the phlebotomist allowed Liam to sit on me both times, and <br/>
Liam had always accompanied me to donate blood, so it wasn&#39;t too <br/>
strange to him).  But, his doc was really great and always spoke to <br/>
Liam with the same respect he would to me.  I think that feeling that <br/>
kind of respect  from his doc and from us made all the difference for Liam.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little, and I wish you guys all the best!!<br/>

  Something else to consider -- not to add to your stress -- but because bites are generally documented by the authorities, and your daughter is now being &#39;tracked&#39; by a doctor -- you could find yourself in danger of being reported for neglect if you choose not to force the meds into her, or if by repecting her autonomy the docs feel you&#39;re not being responsible enough as a parent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007538809">Just need to clear up the fact that raw garlic and goldenseal are not <br/>
homeopathic remedies.  All remedies are tastless and are added to <br/>
very small sugar pills which disolve under the tounge or remedies are <br/>
liquid and added to water with no taste at all.  Also, if classical <br/>
homeopathy was used to treat lyme, only one remedy would have been <br/>
needed, not a combination.  <br/>

&gt; When Liam was really young (about 3, I guess),  he had Lyme <br/>
&gt; disease.  His dad also, coincidentally, had Lyme at the same time <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; he was treating it (ultimately, successfully) with alternative <br/>
&gt; medicine.  The doc I was using could have treated Liam <br/>
&gt; homeopathically or allopathically, the choice was ours to <br/>
&gt; make.  Jimmy was having to take a ton of nasty-tasting remedies <br/>
eight <br/>
&gt; times a day, including raw garlic and goldenseal, and he was also <br/>
&gt; enduring second-stage Lyme, which was very painful.  Because Liam&#39;s <br/>
&gt; titers were so high, the doc strongly recommended the allopathic <br/>
&gt; route (antibiotics) with complementary homeopathic therapy to <br/>
support <br/>
&gt; him through it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At that time, Liam had never had refined sugar in his young life, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; he really balked at the amoxicillin, which he had to take for three <br/>
&gt; weeks.  Although he didn&#39;t like it at all for about the first week <br/>
&gt; and a half, I was honest with him about the alternatives for <br/>
treating <br/>
&gt; it (I didn&#39;t scare him or make it seem like it was gloom or doom; I <br/>
&gt; presented the medication to him as a choice he could make, along <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; other choices, such as treating it the way Jimmy was doing it, and <br/>
&gt; not treating it at all, and what the various outcomes would likely <br/>
&gt; be).  He opted, as I hoped he would, for the meds, and for the <br/>
first <br/>
&gt; week and a half, he hated the amox, but then (unfortunately) it <br/>
grew <br/>
&gt; on him.  He also took the complementary stuff (including the <br/>
&gt; probiotic), and he did great!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He got Lyme again about two years later, and he was cool with the <br/>
&gt; whole thing (even drawing the blood, which he regarded with <br/>
&gt; curiosity; the phlebotomist allowed Liam to sit on me both times, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; Liam had always accompanied me to donate blood, so it wasn&#39;t too <br/>
&gt; strange to him).  But, his doc was really great and always spoke to <br/>
&gt; Liam with the same respect he would to me.  I think that feeling <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; kind of respect  from his doc and from us made all the difference <br/>
for Liam.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope that helps a little, and I wish you guys all the best!!<br/>

I realize that you&#39;re going through a really tough time, but they are <br/>

<br/>
I think they are simply doing the best they can under the <br/>

I certainly don&#39;t think they need time-outs or loss of *anything*!!! <br/>
They need to be held and cuddled and allowed to express their feelings <br/>
(which must be huge and complicated!).<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things are you asking them to do? May they not say &quot;no&quot;? <br/>
Is it really that you are *asking*? Or are you simply telling them what <br/>
to do in the form of a question? Why must they eat at the table? Can&#39;t <br/>
you serve a picnic on the living room floor?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205211977">Little things might make a huge difference. Can you get your food delivered? <br/>
Does a grocery store near you let you shop on-line and bring the food in? If <br/>
not, can going to the grocery store always include other trips like going to <br/>
the park or going to get ice cream or going to a toy store and getting <br/>
something special. Can you get a couple of plastic mats to put on the floor <br/>
under where they want to eat? We have this great picnic mat that we got when <br/>
we collected enough stamps at Mr. Donut in Kyoto that I used to put out <br/>
whenever the kids wanted to eat in front of the television when they were <br/>
little. We don&#39;t ever eat at the dinner table anymore, but they are older, <br/>
and the carpet in this house is really not in any kind of shape to be <br/>
anything but improved by having things spilled on it &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Is the destruction part of what they are enjoying? Or are they creating <br/>
something that you just aren&#39;t able to see because it involves writing on <br/>
walls? If they are enjoying destruction, can you find things for them to <br/>
destroy? So when you see them writing on the walls in the house, give them <br/>
water washable fingerpaints and put them in the bath and let them paint all <br/>
over the tiles in the bath? Get some sidewalk chalk and go outside and draw <br/>
all over the sidewalk? Maybe try a bunch of different crayons and chalks on <br/>
a small, hidden section of the wall and see which can be removed most easily <br/>
and talk to them about only drawing on the walls with those? Or draw with <br/>
them on the walls using the things that are safe to use? Or when they are <br/>
breaking something that you want to keep, find something that they can <br/>
break, look for things that are already broken and use those. Get a punching <br/>
bag and let them beat up on that. Simon used to, when he got really <br/>
frustrated, go beat up a punching bag he got at a car boot sale (the UKs <br/>
version of a garage sale).<br/>
<br/>
Given what your lives has been for however long, they must feel so utterly <br/>
confused and unsure of themselves and the world they live in. It seems to me <br/>
that the best thing you can do for them is meet them where they are. Try and <br/>
say yes always. Try and find ways to say yes to them. Let them know that <br/>
they are safe and loved and sure of themselves with you. Punishing them and <br/>
giving them time outs will just push them back into a world where they feel <br/>
like they have no control over their outcomes. Maybe it would be easier for <br/>
you if you imagined how lovely it would feel if someone were to love you for <br/>
exactly who you are and to support you in being that person. Maybe if <br/>
everytime you said yes to your children you could see it as saying yes to <br/>
yourself you could help yourself to feel more powerful, more embiggened. <br/>
Saying yes is a pretty powerful thing, when your children come to you, or <br/>
you come to them and you can fill their world with all the things they dream <br/>
of, including drawing on the walls, there is nothing more amazing, more <br/>
powerful than that! And as time goes by they will come to the point where <br/>
they will help you find ways, not only to say yes to them, but to help you <br/>
find ways to say yes to you and to your dreams.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053860701">I have been in your situation, and although my DH has been through <br/>
counseling and is different now, I can relate to what youre saying.  <br/>
<br/>
If your kids didnt have behavioral issues, would you feel the need to <br/>
set rules? Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Why do your kids have these issues? Probably through learned behavior <br/>
from your husband.<br/>
<br/>
What will you achieve by setting rules because of their behavior? (In <br/>
their eyes...) Punishment for doing the same thing that they were <br/>
taught.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to talk to them. Tell them why it hurts you when they <br/>
act that way. Explain to them what happened between you and your <br/>
husband and how much it hurt you. Explain that you want things to be <br/>
differnt and you want things to be fun and exciting. The more FUN you <br/>
make the day, the less the kids object. The less objections- the less <br/>
tantrums. The less tantrums... the less stress. Its a big cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Why not take them to the park and play tag or kickball and yell and <br/>
scream and just let it all out. Or turning on some crazy dance video <br/>
and really letting off some steam jumping around??<br/>
<br/>
I bet they would feel much better and be less stressed if you werent <br/>
as stressed as you are. And because I have been there... I know that <br/>
you are stressed. And kids sense that. Try to work on you first... <br/>
the rest will unfold over time :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190553194">I had a talk with the 6yo yesterday. The reason he doesn&#39;t want to leave <br/>
out of the house is because he is scared it will be gone when we return <br/>
and we will have to go back &quot;home&quot;. As for the other behavior all he <br/>
said was that he is sad and that is what he does when he is sad.<br/>
I left it at that, and offered my reassurance that we would not be <br/>
returning &quot;home&quot;, that this is our home now.  Yes I will have to check <br/>
out food delivery prices and if I can squeeze it into the budget. I am <br/>
looking into ways for them to release some anger, thinking of punching <br/>
bags, etc.  Whenever they are ready to travel again we will get out to <br/>
the park and stuff more.<br/>
Yes , Kristen if it weren&#39;t for the behavior issues I would not be <br/>
trying to set rules. I believe it is the fear that if I don&#39;t do <br/>
something to &quot;control&quot; the anger the boys esp. will end up like their <br/>
father. I do recognize  that me being stressed is not helping the <br/>
situation.  That too  is fear  of not knowing  whether or not we can <br/>
make it alone. Guilt, yes I feel guilty that I put them through all of <br/>
this. I am going to try and take it day by day and whenever possible try <br/>
and take a breather to regroup. Slowly but surely.  I think being able <br/>
to vent has put me in a better state of mind to deal with the situation.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447601671">Robin I am so sorry for your dd. As someone how has worked with dogs I get so mad when things like that happen.<br/>
I am sure you must have but have you sat down gently with her and talked about how this medication can help her feel better?<br/>
Is it possible to add a flavor she likes to the medication? How long does she have to take this one and if it is long can you get another antibiotic that can be used shorter duration?<br/>
I have been bitten by dogs and cats and it can really get infected ( not always thou I would say 10% to 20%of the times only) and the infection is really painful.<br/>
Is it already painful now? It really gets painful right away about 12 hours from the bite.<br/>
If it has not it may not get infected at all.<br/>
I have taken antibiotics for it half the time.<br/>
Of the times it I took it and It got infected it seemed that it took the same amount of time to heal and for the infection to go away with or without the antibiotic.<br/>
My only worry is that it is in her face. I would try to really talk to her without scarring her and also try calling the pharmacy for adding flavors to the meds, etc<br/>
Again I ask if she is in intense pain and I will say again that is it is to get infected it would happen in the first 12-24 hours( but I don&#39;t know if the antibiotic she took at the hospital would change that) as infected dog or cat bites are extremely painful.<br/>
Best wishes<br/>
