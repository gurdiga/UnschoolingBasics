<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348630231">I recently &quot;quit&quot; a relationship I started over 15 years ago.  certainly the<br/>
unspoken timestamp on it was something like &quot;forever&quot; or &quot;always&quot;.  For the<br/>
last few years I continued in it because it felt like an obligation.  One<br/>
day I realized that being in the relationship didn&#39;t make me a responsible<br/>
friend, and that &quot;quitting&quot; it made me an authentic person.  I truly believe<br/>
being an authentic and happy person makes more sense.  I want my children to<br/>
believe this too.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has been in piano for 5 years, and at first we had a teacher that<br/>
required tracking her practice minutes and one lesson per week.  The nice<br/>
thing was that she charged the same price as others but she came to OUR<br/>
house.  Seemed like a good deal until we realized that we did not enjoy<br/>
having to practice so much.  I&#39;m sure it would be lovely to have an adult<br/>
daughter who plays piano extremely well, but she seemed disenchanted by<br/>
&quot;having&quot; to do work at 5 to be this future person she didn&#39;t understand.  So<br/>
we quit.  A year later we found a teacher who we could call and set up a<br/>
lesson when DD desired one, and didn&#39;t require any practice minutes<br/>
recorded.  She taught from books but if DD wanted to learn a specific piece<br/>
instead, they&#39;d focus on that.  Last time it was a piece from the video game<br/>
Zelda and this time a Muse song.  She tailored each to fit DDs skills where<br/>
she is now.<br/>
<br/>
Now as another side of the coin, I once desired to learn guitar, and loved<br/>
it, but it was taken away as punishment for bad grades.  After my grades<br/>
went up I never went back to taking lessons and I&#39;m still upset over this.<br/>
All that to say,  I hope to never make my child&#39;s current interests and<br/>
activities hinge on some outside force or responsibility such as money or<br/>
grades.<br/>
