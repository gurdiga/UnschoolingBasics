<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318078945">Does anybody have any book suggestions for better understanding the tween years? (Either to be read by myself the parent or my daughter the tween!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891500790">You might look at something like &quot;How to talk so your kids will listen, how to listen so your kids will talk&quot; or &quot;The Parent Teen Breakthrough.&quot; Beyond that, the trouble with books written about kids over the age of 7 is they&#39;re about the effects of schooling, not about kids as people - so they&#39;re not much help in terms of unschooling. You might look through the &quot;Typical Days&quot; collection on Sandra&#39;s site for stories of tweens: &nbsp; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a> You might also want to look through the Blog of the Zombie Princess - her kids are grown now, but she wrote about them and unschooling for years, so there are tween years in there too: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1">https://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1</a> There&#39;s a long list of unschooling blogs here, although it hasn&#39;t been updated in awhile so the links won&#39;t all be good: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/resources/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/resources/</a> ---Meredith --- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jgracefrank@...">jgracefrank@...</a>&gt; wrote: You can check out the book list on amightygirl.com...
