<div id="ygrps-yiv-423283331">Sorry for those who see this several times!  Any other podcast-listeners out<br/>
there?  Why isn&#39;t there a good unschooling one?  People write such<br/>
incredible, beautiful, thoughtful things every day!  Wouldn&#39;t it be great to<br/>
have even just a weekly sampling of the best unschooling<br/>
writings-of-the-week in audio format?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in doing this?  If there&#39;s interest, I&#39;d do it but if<br/>
someone else is working on it I don&#39;t want to steal their thunder.  I am<br/>
aware of the radio Freeschool program and I enjoy it.  But I would like to<br/>
see (hear) something regularly and specifically about unschooling, and not<br/>
from any one or a few experts but from lots of voices!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757323382">I&#39;ve always thought this too, even before there was podcasting.  I would be <br/>
driving all over L.A. listening to books on tape, or some fairly good radio <br/>
stations with my kids, and we would often be away from a computer until late at <br/>
night.  Then, I&#39;d be falling asleep in front of the screen, trying to keep up <br/>
with the latest hot topics.  Always wished I could be listening to posts from <br/>
my favorite lists, or have someone reading articles from my favorite newspapers <br/>
and magazines.  I love NPR, Air America, Pacifica, and Democracy Now, but <br/>
sometimes I would rather hear about subjects that are closer to my daily life, to <br/>
the way that I am actually living. Unschooling podcasts would be great.  Of <br/>
course, something like this might already exist.  There is so much private <br/>
podcasting going on these days, it&#39;s hard to find all that is available. <br/>
<br/>
There is a small podcasting studio here, in one of the artist&#39;s lofts <br/>
buildings downtown, called The Brewery.  They help folks do podcasting, teach about <br/>
it, rent out the space, etc.  I&#39;ll see the guy tomorrow night, and ask him <br/>
about setting something up.  <br/>
