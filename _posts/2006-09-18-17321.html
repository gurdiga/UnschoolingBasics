<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071726126">Ugg.  She&#39;s back!  For those not familiar, about two years ago this Margaret<br/>
Boyce of Saugatuck (MI) wrote an editorial slamming homeschoolers.  Based on<br/>
my Swiss-cheese memory I think there was a huge refutation from around the<br/>
country (don&#39;t recall anyone writing in to support her view but could be<br/>
wrong).  Well, she&#39;s back it again.  This was published in the Holland<br/>
Sentinel this morning (9/18/06) in the Opinion section:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
MISSING OUT ON BACK TO SCHOOL<br/>
<br/>
To the Editor:<br/>
<br/>
There is a whiff of autumn in the air, and football has begun.  One can feel<br/>
the excitement.  Why?  Because it is back to school time!  I know many<br/>
children who just can&#39;t wait to begin, from kindergarten to high school,<br/>
looking forward to seeing the friends, including teachers, that have been<br/>
missed during the summer.  New clothes, new books and a new start in the<br/>
year.  Truly one of life&#39;s greatest milestones when everything is filled<br/>
with promise.<br/>
<br/>
            However, there is a group of children being robbed of this<br/>
incredible experience.  Their parents, probably that they are being<br/>
especially virtuous, have decided that they will keep their children and<br/>
&quot;home school&quot; because they (the parents) believe that they are able to bring<br/>
all knowledge and learning to their children.  One parent told me that she<br/>
was keeping her child at home because &quot;Well, he cried when I took him to<br/>
kindergarten.&quot;  Apparently she had failed to give him any experiences that<br/>
prepared both of them the ability to separate, so she would deprive him of<br/>
this education.<br/>
<br/>
            There are several new studies that deal with this overzealous<br/>
parenting.  Too much home pressure, too much togetherness, no chance for the<br/>
children to find their own way.  I have written in the past of a Harvard<br/>
study that followed a flock of homeschooled children that found no<br/>
significant difference in their academic achievements that the traditionally<br/>
schooled children, with the exception of some gaps where the parents were<br/>
just now knowledgeable.  However, the mothers do get a huge ego boost.  Is<br/>
that why we have children?  To boost a mother&#39;s ego?  As an experienced mom<br/>
as well as a former teacher, I believe that this intense parenting can<br/>
usually have two outcomes.  One, the child becomes very stifled, unable to<br/>
function independently at all, or what often happens, the moment the child<br/>
reaches 18 (or sometimes younger) they are gone.  If they go to college, it<br/>
will be very far away.  As adults they will remain far away.  I have spoken<br/>
with many grown children who would say &quot;I could never live near my parents&quot;<br/>
and enumerate the controls put upon them as children.<br/>
<br/>
            Raising children demands time, attention, encouragement, and<br/>
letting go.  The words from a song in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;-&quot;How do you hold<br/>
a moonbeam in your hand?&quot;-can be a good question for parents.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
easy, but the ones that can let go enough to allow their children to grow<br/>
their own wings are the most successful.<br/>
<br/>

LOVE back to school time.  They DO get new clothes because we have<br/>
&quot;tax free week&quot; about a month before school starts and stores have<br/>
huge sales and markdowns and I can get more summer clothes (since we<br/>
have summer until the beginning of November here) at remarkable<br/>
prices.  These are their &quot;school clothes&quot; and they LOVE it.  They also<br/>
know that about 3 weeks after school starts that we are going to head<br/>
down to Target and stock up on new crayons, pencils, notebooks, paper,<br/>
construction paper, glue, and markers because Target has marked all<br/>
their &quot;school supplies&quot; down to 50% off.  They know that our resource<br/>
group will be starting back up (we take a hiatus during the summer as<br/>
our meeting place is used as daycare for traditionally schooled<br/>
children whose parents work)  so they get excited about seeing their<br/>
friends again and hoping that new friends will show up.  They also<br/>
look forward to the first day of school.  Our tradition has always<br/>
been on the first day of school to go to the mall and hang out<br/>
(usually spending a lot of time just in Hot Topic and the pet store)<br/>
&quot;flaunting&quot; (if you will) our freedom from school buses, homework,<br/>
tests, and early wake up times.<br/>

<br/>
This woman is obviously cracked (or smoked too much crack) and has NO<br/>
CLUE as to what homeschoolers do.  &quot;depriving them of education&quot;<br/>
PLEASE!!!!!!  My children have more &quot;educational opportunities&quot; than<br/>
most traditionally schooled children!  Yep, definitely too much crack.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562748948">She obviously has no idea.  I wouldn&#39;t berate her any further.  She&#39;s <br/>
ignorant about homeschooling, but probably not a bad person.<br/>
Homeschooled and unschooled children get more educational opportunities than <br/>
kids in school.  They have access to more diversity in life, in friendships, <br/>
and in subjects to learn about.<br/>
There are a lot of people against homeschooling, but there are also many <br/>
homeschoolers and unschoolers who are just as adimantly against what she&#39;s <br/>
doing with her kids.  The debate gois on with other aspects of parenting <br/>
like breast vs. bottle, stay at home or work, vaccinate or not, homeschool <br/>
or school, to spank or not.  On both sides of each debate, there is a lot of <br/>
viciousness and not a lot of willingness to understand where the other is <br/>
coming from.  I am TTC, but I am not sure this aspect of motherhood is <br/>
something I look forward to- having every choice berated by other moms.  And <br/>
then, they complain that mothers can&#39;t do anything right, because any choice <br/>
they make is put down- uh, yeah- by other moms.<br/>
So, we all disagree with this article.  Let&#39;s not stoop to her level and be <br/>
as hate-filled as she was.  I know it&#39;s hard.<br/>

I just have to chortle and shake my head in response to this woman&#39;s<br/>
editorial POV.  We felt oh so sad and deprived about missing Back to<br/>
School because instead we spent a beautiful day at New Brighton Beach<br/>
and had dinner at Santa Cruz Diner.  I hope everyone feels suitably<br/>
sorry for my poor deprived child!  LOL. (And the water was warmer at<br/>
the beach than it is all year.  Excellent!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258393673">I&#39;ll have to admit that my feathers were pretty ruffled this morning,<br/>
but now that I&#39;m fully preened and less ruffled and have gone on with<br/>
my day, enjoying being with my children and doing what we do, I&#39;ve<br/>
started doubting whether I should have posted the editorial.  It was<br/>
very negative and I find that those things drain me of my energy. <br/>
Yet, I felt that the article was so inflammatory that it was hard for<br/>
me to simply ignore it.  I guess my idea was to make people aware that<br/>
it was out there and to offer the choice of deleting without taking it<br/>
in or to respond if they were so inclined.  Several people have<br/>
replied with eloquently written replies to the editor that highlight<br/>
the joys and benefits of homeschooling without being derogatory to the<br/>
original author in any way.  I&#39;m glad to see this being turned into<br/>
what will hopefully be a  productive debate rather than mud-slinging.<br/>
  I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed that they are published.  I can&#39;t help<br/>
but want the general public to be better informed about homeschooling<br/>
than what the original editorial attempted to present.  Thanks for<br/>
allowing me to vent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289817438">Mine as well. It&#39;s such utter nonsense to claim that someone is  <br/>
&#39;missing&#39; out from an experience. She&#39;s assuming that my kids can&#39;t  <br/>
smell the autumn air from our backyard? Although it&#39;s beside the  <br/>
point because Oklahoma is still in the 90&#39;s and smells like hot red  <br/>
dirt.<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned did a lot today. We had eye exams. which had a  <br/>
plethora of interest. Josh also built a bridge across our creek with  <br/>
some old pallets, and they also learned 1) why you always wear heavy  <br/>
duty shoes while working with reclaimed lumber (which mom did NOT do  <br/>
today), 2) how to cuss like a sailer, 3) basic first aide, including  <br/>
how to use pliers to remove nails from feet, and 4) the importance of  <br/>
tetanus shots.<br/>
Can&#39;t learn that in school. LOL!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to admit my feathers were pretty ruffled this morning.  Now<br/>
that I have enjoyed my day, spent time with my children and did the<br/>
fun things that come naturally to us, I&#39;ve started to doubt whether I<br/>
should have posted the editorial in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
It was very negative and I find that those things drain me of my<br/>
energy and I apologize for spreading that around to everyone.  Yet, I<br/>
felt that the article was so inflammatory that it was hard for me to<br/>
simply ignore it.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess my idea was to make people aware that it was out there and to<br/>
offer the choice of deleting without taking it in or to respond if<br/>
they were so inclined.  Several people have replied with eloquently<br/>
written replies to the editor that highlight the joys and benefits of<br/>
homeschooling without being derogatory to the original author in any<br/>
way.  I&#39;m glad to see this being turned into what will hopefully be a<br/>
 productive debate rather than mud-slinging.   I&#39;ll keep my fingers<br/>
crossed that they are published.  I can&#39;t help but want the general<br/>
public to be better informed about homeschooling than what the<br/>
original editorial attempted to present.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for allowing me to vent.<br/>

Cameron asked me yesterday when *I* thought unschooling would become <br/>
more &quot;mainstream&quot;---well, maybe not mainstream, but more accepted as an <br/>
educational philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I figure 20 years. Cam thought that sounded like a long time. Sounds <br/>
*just* around the corner to *me*! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But by then, Cam and other unschoolers will be grown with almost grown <br/>
children who&#39;ve been unschooled. Duncan&#39;s unschooled contemporaries <br/>
will be having their children and unschooling as well. If the lifestyle <br/>
keeps growing as it has these last few years, we should have quite an <br/>
&quot;army&quot; shortly! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That may sound ridiculously optimistic, but I prefer to think of myself <br/>
as a realist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The proof will be in the pudding, but until this generation is out and <br/>
about in large (enough!) numbers, no one will trust that it &quot;works&quot; as <br/>
we say it does. Most people aren&#39;t that... um.... trusting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Until then (or maybe even until 40 years! &lt;G&gt;) we&#39;ll have to go one <br/>
person at a time on lists ---or maybe a family or three at a conference.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Studies&quot; will be in the form of the adult &quot;proof&quot;---*after* the fact. <br/>
Slow progress, but it will happen. Schools are imploding as we type.<br/>
