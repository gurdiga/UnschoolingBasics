<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582000277">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Registration is open for our New York City trips this May and June.<br/>
We&#39;ll visit Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, walk the Brooklyn<br/>
Bridge, explore Times Square and watch a Broadway play, get a<br/>
great view of the city at Rockefeller Center&#39;s Top of the Rock, play<br/>
in Central Park, and have time to explore a museum or other site<br/>
 - your choice. Our groups will be smaller this year, so early<br/>
registrants will have a better chance of having confirmed spots for<br/>
their preferred weekend. Come join us!<br/>
<br/>

Carolina Homeschooler was created in 2004 as a statewide support<br/>
group for South Carolina homeschoolers. Our trips, however, are<br/>
open to homeschooling families across the United States and beyond.<br/>
We are not a travel agency - we just enjoy traveling and meeting new<br/>
families along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Traveling,<br/>
Dianna</div>
