<div id="ygrps-yiv-931279395">Sadly, I&#39;m a lurker here. But, I was wondering if there&#39;s anyone here that lives in Rochester, NY? I&#39;m originally from Rochester but I live in Maine now.  We still head down every 6 months or so for family. We&#39;ll be down for about 2 weeks this August. I really want my daughter to have some sort of friend in Rochester. Does anyone have a daughter who&#39;d like to be pen pals with Abby? A need to read/write isnt really necessary. Abby loves to send picturess and simple letters. <br/>
<br/>
Abby is 6, a budding ballerina and artist. She loves the color pink, cats, Harry Potter, Littlest Pet Shop, The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Garfield and webkinz. She has 2 younger brothers. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested (even if you&#39;re not in Rochester!), email me off list. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
