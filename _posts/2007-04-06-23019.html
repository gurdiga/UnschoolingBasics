<div id="ygrps-yiv-657825858">A few months ago, my 8 yo. dd went to a class on computers and at the<br/>
beginning the teacher quizzed the kids on their math knowledge.  Being<br/>
the only unschooled family (all the other kids are homeschooled with<br/>
regular work, etc.), my dd felt behind the others in this area.  Now<br/>
she keeps bringing it up and says that she wants to know why X and Y<br/>
are part of math, when it is about numbers not letters.  She also<br/>
feels that she isn&#39;t as smart as the other kids who could answer the<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Up to now, our math has just been answering her questions and through<br/>
monetary purchases, sewing patterns, and cooking.  We have never used<br/>
a math book, etc.  However, I don&#39;t know how to teach variables<br/>
without using a math book.  We have much of the Math-U-See series,<br/>
which I won in a raffle, but we&#39;ve only used the manipulatives.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have tremendous math anxiety, as shown to me by Pam G. at last<br/>
year&#39;s conference.  Opening the Math-U-See book and seeing triangles<br/>
and lengthy problems practically brought me to my knees - lol (never<br/>
mind that I made it through College Calculus II.  I look at my old<br/>
books and am completely clueless - lol).<br/>
<br/>
DD wants to be a vet and if she continues on that path, math is in our<br/>
future.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I know how to teach, what to teach, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359745559">Hello there!<br/>
<br/>
My children, 11,9,5.5,4yo all love Cyberchase on PBS Kids. After<br/>
watching it every day we looked on PBSKids.org &lt;www.pbskids.org&gt;   and<br/>
the games and activities on the Cyberchase pages are great! It is<br/>
starting on TV right as I type! My hubby is singing the theme song lol!<br/>
There are fractions, basic algebra, compass points patterns and tons<br/>
more, all in fun colourful games. Mostly my 5.5yo dd and 4yo dd play<br/>
these days.<br/>
If  I think of any other fun math stuff they do I will post it.<br/>
