<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128728440">No disrespect to any religious affiliates, but I feel like I&#39;ve been <br/>
born again and have found Jesus...except in my case Jesus is radical <br/>
unschooling.  We&#39;ve had our first night of stay up until you want to go <br/>
to sleep and I have to say it&#39;s the most pleasant night I&#39;ve had in a <br/>
long time.  We had no bedtime quarrels...no &quot;get back in bed&quot;...no &quot;this <br/>
is the last sip&quot;...no &quot;stop stealing the covers from your sisters&quot;...my <br/>
two youngest were asleep on their own schedule by 8:45.  My night owl <br/>
daughter came to me around 10:30 and snuggled on the rocking chair while <br/>
we read books back and forth to each other (she&#39;s a self taught reader) <br/>
and then she curled up and fell right to sleep next to me.  My early to <br/>
bed son is still down with husband on the couch watching him play soccer <br/>
on the XBOX.  He and I played MotoGP together earlier.  He&#39;s trying to <br/>
stay up until we decide to go to bed but judging by his drooping lids he <br/>
won&#39;t make it.  My family has done a 360 in a matter of days, little <br/>
more each day and I can&#39;t imagine life any better.  It makes so much <br/>
sense now.  Just like you wonderful folks on the unschooling boards <br/>
advised me to ask myself &quot;why are we doing it this way&quot; I realized that <br/>
everything, well almost everything, we previously did was because that <br/>
was the way it was done for us because we were public schooled and had <br/>
to be up early and sat at the table for meals because that was the only <br/>
time we were all together etc...(except for my own instincts regarding <br/>
attachment parenting which are not the norm for the way things were done <br/>
while we grew up)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Thank you Thank you...and to the wonderful resources out there <br/>
on the internet and library...thank you John Holt...and good night :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726578276">Peace Amy!<br/>
<br/>
I can really feel your sentiment!  I have been on the unschooling path for close to a year now.  I have recently been engaged in some really intense healing and growing on the personal level and am realizing just how much unschooling fits in with my emerging life philosophy.  I am coming to learn that all that we need lies within.  And just like I have come to find that special place within myself, my children need the space and freedom to do the same.  I don&#39;t know how we would do this without unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
To all, I have not posted in a while but I have to say that I just love this group and those of you who serve as mentors to us sometimes hard headed newbies, I say THANK YOU!  So many newbies don&#39;t realize the priceless gift you give in the form of wisdom.  Radical unschooling is cutting edge and truly one path toward a future that is free of war and full of peace, love and respect for all of creation.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
Tyra<br/>
