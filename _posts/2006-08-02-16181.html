<div id="ygrps-yiv-293763411">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We would like to invite you to join us for our first annual unschooling pool <br/>
party on Saturday, August 26 from 2:00 - ?  BYOF (food) and towels.  We&#39;ll <br/>
have food to share as well.  We have plenty of chairs, a trampoline, a pool and a <br/>
sand pit with a playground on it.  If it&#39;s not 100 degrees we&#39;ll have a <br/>
bonfire, too.<br/>
<br/>
We are in Mashpee, MA which is on Cape Cod, about 15 minutes from the Bourne <br/>
Bridge.  We are 1 hour from Boston or Providence.  <br/>
<br/>
We welcome veteran unschoolers as well as newbies like ourselves.  Any <br/>
families who treat each other kindly and respectfully and who want to learn more <br/>
about radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Nazi control freaks are not welcome.  We just had that party!  We want kids <br/>
who are free to have popsicles and watermelon before having finish their mad <br/>
cow burgers.  Okay, that&#39;s another post...<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can join us!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin, new to radical unschooling and loving it along with hubby-Ron, <br/>
Melissa-9, Sam-7, Madison-3 and Anthony-6, our newest addition (fostering). <br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me privately for directions and feel free to forward this to <br/>
any other lists where unschoolers are lurking.<br/>

Darn it - just a tad too far for a picnic! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was SORELY tempted, though, especially by this comment:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nazi control freaks are not welcome.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the open invitation, anyway! ENJOY!<br/>
