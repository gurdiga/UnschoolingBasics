<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053684548">Hi I&#39;m new to this list and to unschooling although I don&#39;t think it <br/>
will be hard for me to embrace it. I&#39;ve wanted to do this for a while <br/>
now and didn&#39;t know how to with the requirements of our cover school <br/>
(I&#39;m in AL). However, I am starting to see the light! I just want to <br/>
say hi and get to know everyone and see what unschooling means to you <br/>
in your day to day life!</div>
