<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307291928">**If left to his own defenses, he would just play games all day.**<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a most interesting typo/slip and I&#39;d like to pull it out here <br/>
just to mull it over.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fairly accurate description of the feelings of a lot of kids who&#39;ve <br/>
been schooled, in or out of the home. They&#39;re defensive against anything that <br/>
looks, smells, feels, sounds or tastes ANYTHING like &quot;education&quot;. The longer <br/>
parents fight against that the longer the defensiveness will last.<br/>
