<div id="ygrps-yiv-786702760">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am inviting any and all unschoolers to our Maryland home for a weekend of<br/>
fun with other unschoolers on March 21/22. All the info about the gathering<br/>
is right here at this blog.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There will be other gatherings hosted by other families in the Mid-Atlantic<br/>
area in the future - to be listed on this one blog. Hope to see you at my<br/>
house in March or somewhere else in the future!<br/>
<br/>
Ciao,<br/>
Zoa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509498537">Hey, we&#39;re only an hour and a half away in Rockville (north of <br/>
DC)...I&#39;ll have to see if I have any days off that weekend...I might <br/>
have Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we are kind of newbie unschoolers and my eight year old is <br/>
still deschooling.  We have a lot of bad habits to unlearn.  I worry <br/>
occasionally that we aren&#39;t ready for prime time yet.  On the other <br/>
hand, I would really love the chance to meet other families farther <br/>
along on the journey than we are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454718783">What an a perfect opportunity to BE around other unschoolers. Especially<br/>
those farther along the path than you :-) You can see really live<br/>
unschoolers, observe, learn, ask questions. IRL is so wonderful, it really<br/>
makes a difference. And this great weekend that Zoa put together doesn&#39;t<br/>
have conference fees so it is perfect for those unsure if a con is &quot;worth&quot;<br/>
it :-) (it is!)<br/>
