Look, Look it&#39;s Nancy!!   Hi Nancy!<br/>
<br/>
Nancy had this great story about bats living in her house and baby bat<br/>
learning to fly and landing in startling and unusual places.   Nancy&#39;s a<br/>
very interesting person.  She has other great qualities besides bat<br/>
caretaker and she&#39;s the one inspired me to feed the crows nesting behind<br/>
my house.<br/>
<br/>
I leave little terra cotta saucers filled with dry cat food on the fence<br/>
posts.  The crows have been bringing their fledglings down to eat and<br/>
we&#39;ve had a wonderful time watching the young birds discover the world.  <br/>
There are two babies and they play at the bird bath.  They hop across it<br/>
like a human child might hop across a mud puddle.  Hop, whoa! Balance,<br/>
turn around, hop again.  Two of them hopping at the same time can have<br/>
complications and they handle them much the same way human kids do.   One<br/>
bird likes to pick leaves and other debris out of the bird bath and will<br/>
sit on the edge and pick up junk with his beak and drop it over the side.<br/>
 The other bird likes to put stuff into the bird bath so will hop down<br/>
onto the ground and find little sticks and whatever he can find and fly<br/>
back up and plop it into the water.  <br/>
He&#39;ll do this over and over again.  Lately he&#39;s been flying to the fence<br/>
and picking up three or four pieces of cat food and dropping the little<br/>
bits into the birdbath. The other continually works to pick the stuff<br/>
out.  They scuffle and squawk when they get irritated with each other.  <br/>
When they&#39;re finished with their exuberant bathing there&#39;s almost no<br/>
water left in the birdbath.  <br/>
<br/>
A side effect of feeding crows is that Blue Jays have stayed around to<br/>
share the cat food and Steller&#39;s Jays come occasionally and we have<br/>
regular Grackles and we get an occasional neighborhood skunk if I forget<br/>
the food out there at night.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan can tell the crows apart in the crow family, he can tell the<br/>
difference between the two babies and the difference between the second<br/>
year siblings and the adult birds.   I know the babies when I see them<br/>
but don&#39;t know who&#39;s who until they&#39;re conducting their water<br/>
experiments. <br/>
<br/>
Her bat story also inspired Dylan to make bat houses and he&#39;s made six or<br/>
so, gave some away for Christmas last year.  We have happy bats.   In<br/>
their own house, not ours.  ; )<br/>
<br/>
All Nancy inspired.  &lt;g&gt;  Isn&#39;t she cool? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687394476">I love bats and crows!   We love to watch the bats fly around at dusk <br/>
catching bugs.  And I&#39;ve always thought that crow society was so <br/>
interesting!   I&#39;ve never seen baby crows (and you can&#39;t tell male from <br/>
female adults), but would love to.  I&#39;ve always thrown out food for <br/>
them, in fact I call (caw!) to them when I do and they know it&#39;s me.  <br/>
I&#39;ll have to try your idea with the cat food to see if I draw any <br/>
babies (or maybe they&#39;re all grown up now).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing these stories!<br/>
