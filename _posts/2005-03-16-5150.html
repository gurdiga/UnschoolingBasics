 Just send her the next day with her excuse note, she was not feeling well.<br/>
Calling the school and telling them, I&#39;m going to let my duaghter decide if <br/>
she wants to go to school or not every day, will irritate them and could <br/>
possibly make them think about truency<br/>
Much as you may not like the idea, school personell are NOT going to happily <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe after a week or two of letting your daughter decide if she is <br/>
going or not you can tell her that if she doesn&#39;t want to keep going she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to, but if she does want to continue it would be better if <br/>
she goes every day?  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s such a great idea really, <br/>
because it&#39;s kind of turning the tables on her again--but since you <br/>
already made the offer to stay home some days I wouldn&#39;t recommend <br/>
recinding it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260181420">Hi Judy<br/>
<br/>
Sounds easier all round if she stops going altogether. That&#39;s what I did -mid term- with all mine who were in school at the time and I never regretted it. Biggest regret was leaving it as long as I did.  It is a rare child who is not happy with the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273316402">Since Moira indicated wanting to stay home today, I let her stay up until I<br/>
was ready to go to bed (around 10 pm).  Lauren went into her room and woke<br/>
her up at 6:15, earlier than she usually gets up for school.  So then she<br/>
came into my room and announced that she wanted to go to school today after<br/>
all.  I said she made her decision last night and since she stayed up so<br/>
late, I didn&#39;t want her to go.  She burst into tears (as she always does<br/>
when she doesn&#39;t get exactly what she wants, regardless of the legality or<br/>
possibility of it), so I promised we would do something fun today.  She was<br/>
slightly mollified and an hour or so later she asked if we could go for a<br/>
long car ride today.  We had breakfast, then loaded the van to take the<br/>
trash to the dump.  We had never driven the road beyond the dump, so we went<br/>
for an &quot;adventure&quot; via the back roads we had never explored before.  Our ten<br/>
minute errand took over an hour.  We saw some pretty neat houses and views.<br/>
We stopped at the store on the way home to pick up something for lunch, and<br/>
DH also bought a couple bottles of soda and three bags of chips.  When we<br/>
got home it was about 10:30.  Lauren asked for something to eat so I started<br/>
to make her a sandwich.  She noticed the chips and asked if she could have<br/>
some.  I said yes and opened the bag for her.  I finished her sandwich and<br/>
gave it to her.  She carried everything into the living room and put her<br/>
sandwich on the couch, where she temporarily forgot about it while she ate<br/>
her chips.  Rowan found the sandwich and took the top piece of bread and one<br/>
slice of ham and began mowing down in the kitchen.  Lauren bemoaned her<br/>
mutilated sandwich, then finished it (without my saying anything), then she<br/>
and I went to our appointment with the preschool coordinator and special<br/>
education team to determine her eligibility for services.  That was a<br/>
horrible experience.  She had fun playing in the classroom by herself during<br/>
our meeting, but I was very unhappy with the process.  I had made it quite<br/>
clear to her current play therapist that I did not want her to be coded, due<br/>
to seeing what happened to my brothers in &quot;the system&quot;.  They said that they<br/>
had to code her in order to give her services, so I very reluctantly<br/>
conceded.  I let them know that I would not need to send her to the<br/>
preschool to get &quot;language role-models&quot; because I had just foud a local<br/>
homeschooling group that has regular playdates.  They were happy with that.<br/>
When we got in the car to come home, Lauren asked if we were going home.  I<br/>
said yes, and she said no, she wanted to go to the store.  I asked what she<br/>
wanted at the store and she said she wanted soda.  I said that Daddy had<br/>
just bought soda and pulled into the driveway.  She flipped out and insisted<br/>
we go to the store.  I turned the car back on and drove to Family Dollar and<br/>
took her in to buy a bottle of soda.  I gave her the money to pay for it<br/>
herself and she was incredibly happy.  She waved that sales receipt around<br/>
in such delight!  Then she was quite content to come home.  The first thing<br/>
she did upon coming in was to show Daddy her sales receipt.  :)  The kids<br/>
asked for Jello and hard boiled eggs, both of which I began for them.  About<br/>
half an hour later, she asked me to give her a nap, which I did.  DH and I<br/>
started dinner to be ready at 4:30-5:00, 1.5 hours earlier than usual.  We<br/>
made shepherd&#39;s pie, which sent Lauren running from the table.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
like her food mixed up.  Moira ate a little, then took off to watch TV.  I<br/>
finished eating, then went to teach my GED class.  Just before I left, I<br/>
gave Rowan to DH to give her a nap (she starts naps by sleeping on him).<br/>
When I came home (after thinking of a great analogy for unschooling on the<br/>
walk home), the girls said, &quot;Yay, now we can have Jello!&quot;  Then I realized<br/>
that DH was still holding a napping Rowan, so was unable to get them<br/>
anything while I was gone.  Moira ate probably an entire box of Jello (I<br/>
made a double batch), but Lauren wasn&#39;t too interested in it after she tried<br/>
it.  They returned to the living room to watch more TV with Daddy.  Around<br/>
8, we suggested they brush teeth and hair so they would be already for bed<br/>
when they got tired.  Immediately after brushing, Lauren asked me to take<br/>
her to bed.  I was dreading Moira staying up until 10:30 again and having to<br/>
put her to bed because I wanted to go to bed.  But she started getting<br/>
droopy eyed aroud 9:30 and was slumping on DH, who suggested she go to bed.<br/>
She thought that was a good idea and took my hand and pulled me upstairs to<br/>
read to her and sing her a song.<br/>
<br/>
So to make a long story short, we had a great time with Moira home.  They<br/>
both exercised far more self-discipline (what&#39;s a better word?) than I<br/>
expected.  I noticed that Lauren took less advantage of the freedom than<br/>
Moira did.  Is that from 7 months in kindergarten?  Yikes.  After the<br/>
frustrating meeting with the SPED team and the wonderful day we had today, I<br/>
am a believer.  Now I just have to formally take her out of school.  I feel<br/>
a little bad because the kindergarten class is the last grade to put on a<br/>
concert and it is scheduled for next Wednesday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915901114">At her two-year checkup, I was concerned that she only said 5 or 6 words.<br/>
She was evaluated for a speech delay and found to be 33% behind, thus<br/>
qualifying for early intervention.  In the past year, her speech has<br/>
exploded, but she was still evaluated at 33% behind.  The evaluator<br/>
indicated to me that they were fudging her level so that they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to suddenly stop working with her and have a gap until the public school<br/>
system took over.  When I brought this up at the meeting the other day, they<br/>
completely denied any fudging.  I was adamant that I did not want her coded.<br/>
I did not know that fudging the numbers so she could still see her favorite<br/>
therapist (only one, but she *loves* her) would mean she would have to be<br/>
coded.  I feel betrayed.  They tested her language comprehension way at the<br/>
top of the scale for her age and her expression at the very bottom.  They<br/>
want to put her in speech therapy (until now it has all been play therapy)<br/>
and they wanted to put her in a local daycare two mornings a week so she<br/>
could have good language role models.  I said I had found the local<br/>
homeschooling group so she would have plenty of good role models and she has<br/>
two older sisters anyway.<br/>

Sorry I can&#39;t remember but how old is she? My ds now aged 6 did not talk at all until he was 3 and a half. This is good old UK lol and he never had speech therapy as the waiting list is so long he would still be on it.  He talks all the time now and is not dalyed at all. sometimes I think they expect something and cos the child doesn&#39;t do it at the appointed age they label them as delayed when in actual fact they are only going at their own pace.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287266175">Lauren turns three in a few weeks.  I think she is talking just fine now.<br/>
She was making very slow progress Where I live, all children are tested for<br/>
lead at their one-year checkup.  She registered very high, and the state<br/>
came in to investigate our apartment and found it chock full of lead.  I got<br/>
rid of almost all of it, but the landlady is not very responisble and won&#39;t<br/>
do her part to get rid of it.  The combination of the high lead level and<br/>
the fact that she wasn&#39;t talking much yet led them to say she was delayed.<br/>
The more I read here and the more I mull it over in my own mind, the more I<br/>
realize that she is just going at her own pace.  My best friend told me that<br/>
her little sister didn&#39;t utter a word until she was 3 years old.  Their<br/>
mother was concerned that she might have been deaf because she truly never<br/>
said a single word.  Then she started with full complete sentences.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had &quot;speech delayed&quot; children.  My son didn&#39;t talk *at all* <br/>
until he was 3.  He was a &quot;point and grunt&quot; kid.  Now he doesn&#39;t shut <br/>
up.  And not one day of speech therapy.  It could be that your dd&#39;s <br/>
vocabulary &quot;exploded&quot; because she was ready to talk not because she <br/>
went to therapy.  She&#39;s still &quot;33% behind.&quot;  Behind who?  Does it <br/>
matter?  And they &quot;fudged&quot; the numbers so that they could continue <br/>
working with her.  Do you know what that really translates to?  &quot;So <br/>
we can continue getting government money for our pay checks.&quot;  I <br/>
would challenge you to quit the therapy sessions and see what happens <br/>
by just talking to your dd.  She may be one of those overly quiet <br/>
kids that really has a huge arsenal of words, but *chooses* not to <br/>
talk.  My brother is like that.  He just doesn&#39;t have anything he <br/>
really wants to talk about.  We go months without talking and then I <br/>
will get a phone call from him asking me how to cook fish. (This just <br/>
happened last week after not hearing from him since the winter <br/>
solstice!)  He was one of those &quot;delayed speakers&quot; Conversations just <br/>
don&#39;t interest him.  He&#39;s the quiet one in his circle of friends yet <br/>
he is one of those rare insightful people who is a great judge of <br/>
character!<br/>
<br/>
Children will learn to talk when they are ready.  They need to in <br/>
order to communicate.  Some kids just need a longer time to figure <br/>
out the whole head to tongue to vocal chord connection, but they <br/>
*will* figure it out - in their time.  That&#39;s one of the things that <br/>
I love about unschooling.  My chidren are able to do things when they <br/>
are physically and emotionally ready to do those things, not when <br/>
some created chart says they are supposed to do them.  Take walking <br/>
for instance.  Some babies are walking long before they turn one year <br/>
old.  Some aren&#39;t walking when they get to be two years old.  Yet, do <br/>
you know any adult that has perfectly capable legs that doesn&#39;t <br/>
walk?  Probably not.  That&#39;s because they walked when they were <br/>
ready.  We have to trust that our children will do these other things <br/>
(like talk, skip, read, cut with a knife, jump rope, etc. etc. etc.) <br/>
when they are ready as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000325958">A 30 yr old friend of mine  just recently told us this story about his &quot;speech problem&quot; as a young todler; Casey&#39;s mother was concerned because he wasn&#39;t speaking yet at age three. She took him to one &quot;therapist&quot; who gave him a really neat toy and then bounced a ball near him. The therapist labeled him &quot;mentally retarded&quot; because Casey didn&#39;t acknowledge the ball being bounced (what a crock). Thank goodness that Casey&#39;s mother knew not to listen to him and took her son elsewhere. The &quot;therapist&quot; watched mom and son interact for several minutes and then stated: Mam, your son is not retarded, he doesn&#39;t have to ask for anything because  you give him everything by him just pointing. He told her to go home and make him ask for what he wants. Sure enough they went home Casey pointed at the sink for water but mom wouldn&#39;t get it. She pretended not to understand and much to her surprise Casey out of frustration asked for the water in almost a full sentence!!!!<br/>

Like it&#39;s been said...they&#39;ll talk when their ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had &quot;speech delayed&quot; children.  My son didn&#39;t talk *at all* <br/>
until he was 3.  He was a &quot;point and grunt&quot; kid.  Now he doesn&#39;t shut <br/>
up.  And not one day of speech therapy.  It could be that your dd&#39;s <br/>
vocabulary &quot;exploded&quot; because she was ready to talk not because she <br/>
went to therapy.  She&#39;s still &quot;33% behind.&quot;  Behind who?  Does it <br/>
matter?  And they &quot;fudged&quot; the numbers so that they could continue <br/>
working with her.  Do you know what that really translates to?  &quot;So <br/>
we can continue getting government money for our pay checks.&quot;  I <br/>
would challenge you to quit the therapy sessions and see what happens <br/>
by just talking to your dd.  She may be one of those overly quiet <br/>
kids that really has a huge arsenal of words, but *chooses* not to <br/>
talk.  My brother is like that.  He just doesn&#39;t have anything he <br/>
really wants to talk about.  We go months without talking and then I <br/>
will get a phone call from him asking me how to cook fish. (This just <br/>
happened last week after not hearing from him since the winter <br/>
solstice!)  He was one of those &quot;delayed speakers&quot; Conversations just <br/>
don&#39;t interest him.  He&#39;s the quiet one in his circle of friends yet <br/>
he is one of those rare insightful people who is a great judge of <br/>
character!<br/>
<br/>
Children will learn to talk when they are ready.  They need to in <br/>
order to communicate.  Some kids just need a longer time to figure <br/>
out the whole head to tongue to vocal chord connection, but they <br/>
*will* figure it out - in their time.  That&#39;s one of the things that <br/>
I love about unschooling.  My chidren are able to do things when they <br/>
are physically and emotionally ready to do those things, not when <br/>
some created chart says they are supposed to do them.  Take walking <br/>
for instance.  Some babies are walking long before they turn one year <br/>
old.  Some aren&#39;t walking when they get to be two years old.  Yet, do <br/>
you know any adult that has perfectly capable legs that doesn&#39;t <br/>
walk?  Probably not.  That&#39;s because they walked when they were <br/>
ready.  We have to trust that our children will do these other things <br/>
(like talk, skip, read, cut with a knife, jump rope, etc. etc. etc.) <br/>
when they are ready as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was me with my brother.  I spoke for him.  I still do often.  <br/>
When I went to school for the first 3 years my mother was at a loss. <br/>
Then my brother decided that speaking might be a good way to <br/>
communicate.  He was over 4 by that point and only said a handful of <br/>
words.  It&#39;s interesting how my brother and I can communicate.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how it is, but I can &quot;read&quot; him.  This past Christmas <br/>
dinner we were sitting around afterwards and I said, &quot;Duane is ready <br/>
to go home now&quot; and he stood up and said, &quot;See ya!&quot;  and left.  Not <br/>
because I said he had to go but that he was ready and I had allowed <br/>
him the exit.  My dad just shakes his head and says, &quot;How do you do <br/>
that?&quot;  <br/>

twitch from a couple families we know where the siblings or parents <br/>
talk for the child AND THEN the parent are going to all these lengths <br/>
with doctors and speech therapists...all with the focus of Something <br/>
Is Wrong With The Child. Argh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016434362">At 2, Zachary was evaluated as being delayed because of his speech<br/>
expression.  He had three words and two of them were &#39;ball&#39;.  The<br/>
simple fact is that Zachary didn&#39;t CARE about expressing himself at<br/>
that age.  He was into balls.  If he had a ball, he was playing with<br/>
it.  If he didn&#39;t have a ball, he had a very concise way of asking for<br/>
one.  His needs were MET.<br/>
<br/>
Later, when he started having other interests (airplanes, sharks,<br/>
spiders, dinosaurs, etc...) and started interacting with others on<br/>
more than an &#39;I want&#39; basis, they tested him again.  He scored a 109<br/>
on their test where 100 was average.  His words at three included<br/>
pachycephalosaurus, velocirapter, parasauralophus, brachiosaurus,<br/>
apatosaurus (notice a trend?  And he figured out the difference<br/>
between a brachiosaur and an apatosaur before I did).<br/>
<br/>
Now at four, he  is able to ask for parallelograms and tell the<br/>
difference between them and squares turned on their ends, and he&#39;s<br/>
continually using phrases that suprise us.  The latest one was this<br/>
Sunday.  As we were leaving church he wanted to stay and expressed it<br/>
at the door by saying &quot;No!  I want to have a Power Struggle!&quot;  I think<br/>
he picked up that one from my mother in law - I know WE never used the<br/>
phrase &#39;power struggle&#39; with him.  He has used more sophisticated<br/>
language recently, but the specifics are escaping me at this time.<br/>

and third Yule celebrations we gave him nothing but balls.  In fact <br/>
for his second Yule we gave him this huge box full of different <br/>
balls.  He was the most ecstatic little boy in the world.  A BOX <br/>
with BALLS!  Everything was a ball including eggs (which he found <br/>
did not bounce - UGH!)<br/>

car, caboose, narrow gauge, trolly, and all the names of all the <br/>
Thomas engines and friends.  He also uses some pretty amazing words <br/>
and phrases.  I think this comes from us using some &quot;pretty amazing <br/>
words and phrases&quot;  We don&#39;t talk to him in &quot;6yo-ese&quot; but like he <br/>
was an adult.  If we say a word that he doesn&#39;t understand we just <br/>
give him a definition that he can understand.  He then adopts that <br/>
word into his vocabulary.  We did this with all our children.  Mary <br/>
Elayne&#39;s favorite word for the longest time was &quot;effervescent.&quot;  She <br/>
was my child that went from saying &quot;Nursie&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; to &quot;May I <br/>
have a cup of juice, please?&quot;  overnight.  She was older than 2 when <br/>
she did that, but it shouldn&#39;t have surprised me as that is how she <br/>
has done everything:  talking, reading, walking, weaning, <br/>
rollerskating, etc.  I figure she is just one of those people who is <br/>
going to observe until she has enough information and then she is <br/>
going to do whatever it was she wanted to do like she always has <br/>
been doing it.  <br/>
