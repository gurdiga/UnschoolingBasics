<div id="ygrps-yiv-936106701">I also have a dd that hits, pinches, bites and she is very well <br/>
spoken for her age as well.  The pinching and biting has stopped now <br/>
and was a very short time in her growth.  I have met a few parents <br/>
with kids that bite very violently.  My dd was bit on the nose so <br/>
hard she bleed it was a very sad day for us!!  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with some moms that referred to it as communication issue.  <br/>
I know u mentioned it was not but hear this idea, even though she is <br/>
very bright for her age and speaks well the FEELINGS that she might <br/>
be feeling are not easy for her to understand or communicate them <br/>
out loud yet.  I would really look at the whole 20min before she was <br/>
playing and also listen to the boys that she was poking with the <br/>
stick maybe things were said or they were not playing with her when <br/>
she wanted their undivided attention?????  I see my youngest dd push <br/>
and hit my 6yod everyday over FEELINGS she can&#39;t explain at her age <br/>
of 3.  She is very bright also and it is easier for kids to use <br/>
their &quot;tools&quot; of hands, teeth, etc when they don&#39;t know how to <br/>
EXPRESS feelings.  Does this make sense even though she talks well?  <br/>
Its just a growing development that a 2 1/2 or even 3 yo has to <br/>
accomplish.  <br/>
<br/>
On big advice or idea is watch her every step and listen to the kids <br/>
playing.  Maybe she gets very done early and needs new interaction.  <br/>
About the time of brushing teeth was she just &quot;done&quot; for the day and <br/>
it was past her tolerant time of the day?  Just a thought for ya?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was going to touch on this, too, but got side-tracked earlier.  My <br/>
son was very verbal by 2, and it was hard to understand sometimes that <br/>
such a strongly verbal kid could have such trouble communicating!  But <br/>
I noticed that he really really had trouble with negative emotions -- <br/>
just tried not to acknowledge them.  They were there, but he wasn&#39;t <br/>
mature enough to deal with them, I guess.  Watch for triggers, and <br/>
also voice what you suspect her feelings might be.  It&#39;s easy for a <br/>
child to learn words, but sometimes, the true meanings are harder, and <br/>
even harder to realize that acknowledging them is tough, even if she <br/>
KNOWS the words.  If that makes any sense.  I&#39;m using words, and they <br/>
are so inadequate.... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that at 2.5, she may just not be ready for a group play <br/>
setting.  It requires some really tricky social skills that most kids <br/>
that age don&#39;t have yet.  <br/>

would he want to stop- say &quot;do not hit&quot;- grab his arm before he hits <br/>
and say &quot;NO&quot;- you CAN and SHOULD stop something hurtful but you do <br/>
not have to add a punishment on top of that. Saying &quot;do not hit me- <br/>
tell me what you need&quot; is enough or saying &quot;no&quot; and adding something <br/>
like &quot;do you need help- do you want food- want to snuggle- want me <br/>
to play with you&quot;- <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem deflecting or stopping a hand from hitting me<br/>
either. Setting personal boundaries IS a big part of healthy<br/>
relationships. I often wonder if that comes through when we talk about<br/>
saying &quot;yes&quot; more and not punishing children. Just because we don&#39;t<br/>
use control and punishment in our family doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t all<br/>
have some pretty strong personal boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has their own idea of what constitutes respect for their<br/>
bodies and ideas. Jared loves to joke and Sierra hates it, so it&#39;s a<br/>
lot about thinking of each other and respecting ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
If I let my child hurt me, what kind of message is that sending. How<br/>
is that helping them get better tools? I am pretty good at saying<br/>
&quot;this is NOT ok with me guys&quot; if something isn&#39;t cool. Hitting isn&#39;t<br/>
cool in my book. Doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t had some rough times with<br/>
hitting...I see it as a sign that the child ran out of tools in the<br/>
moment not a reason to demonize their behavior. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, is the family letting the child know it is NOT ok<br/>
with them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235039816">I&#39;ve been hanging on to Marji&#39;s post for a while wanting to comment. <br/>
Then Ren posted about &quot;unparenting,&quot; and I wanted to comment on that. <br/>
Finally I have a moment to hit both at once.<br/>
<br/>
I have a real problem with the term &quot;unparenting&quot; that is often batted <br/>
around unschooling circles. Because we say &quot;yes&quot; a lot (almost always, <br/>
in some way, shape or form!) and we allow our children a LOT of <br/>
freedom, some folks refer to our gentle, mindful parenting as <br/>
&quot;unparenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s no doubt that there&#39;s some &quot;unparenting&quot; going on. I&#39;ve <br/>
witnessed it: children who don&#39;t have a clue how to interact with <br/>
anyone. Granted, some of these children may just have little natural <br/>
social intelligence. But, if that&#39;s the case, their parents need to be <br/>
helping MORE, not less. Of course, it *could* be that the parents have <br/>
very little social awareness as well. I that situation, the parents <br/>
should probably ask for help from a more social aware friend to help <br/>
them learn how to get along better and help them help their children.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who do *nothing* are doing their children no favors. Children <br/>
don&#39;t *want* to be considered unpleasant or &quot;bratty&quot; or mean. I think <br/>
children want to be seen as sweet and as kind as anyone one else. But <br/>
when they are struggling with that, they need HELP---not avoidance or <br/>
complacency or the laissez faire attitude I see so often.   They need <br/>
an *advocate*---someone who will stand UP for them and help them <br/>
through that period.<br/>
<br/>
Without a parent&#39;s help, a child may still figure it out---but maybe <br/>
not before the child loses friends and invitations.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa refers to it as &quot;super-parenting,&quot; and I like that term. Being <br/>
*there* for them whenever they need me. If I help them (for years and <br/>
years! &lt;g&gt;), eventually they won&#39;t need me anymore. At 20, Cameron <br/>
really doesn&#39;t need me much anymore. Duncan, at 12, still does. A lot.<br/>
<br/>
If *I* (his parent) don&#39;t tell him, someone *else* who doesn&#39;t have <br/>
*his* best interest at heart may do it FOR me. And not very kindly. He <br/>
may lose friends. He may not be welcome in certain places or <br/>
situations. I *can* help by being there with him and helping him when <br/>
he seems to be struggling.<br/>
<br/>
I can do this by making sure he&#39;s rested and fed *before* we go <br/>
somewhere. Going further with that: we can bypass an event if he&#39;s NOT <br/>
feeling up to par.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than sit and chat with *my* friends, I can go play with HIM. <br/>
Tough, sometimes, because often I&#39;m tickled to be with *my* buddies <br/>
too! But *he* is my priority.<br/>
<br/>
If I see him starting to melt down, I can refocus and redirect so that <br/>
he&#39;s in a more comfortable place.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, just being blunt and telling him that what he&#39;s doing is <br/>
NOT OK is where I need to go. It&#39;s important that he knows how his <br/>
choices may effect others---and others&#39; opinions of him. I don&#39;t want <br/>
others to avoid him because he&#39;s unpleasant to be around!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan is *very* social and likes to be surrounded by friends. I know <br/>
that he loves his friends and his brother and that he wants them to <br/>
want to be around him. It&#39;s important to *him* to be someone they want <br/>
to be around. I can help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419196883"> <br/>
I agree....and sometimes it&#39;s so frustrating when you ARE around for your child, and the other parent, whose children also have BIG needs, are not there.  I&#39;m facing this with some friends who have kids similar ages to my kids.  Everyone gets along very well, with the exception of my 4yo dd and their 5 yo ds.  Whenever we get together, I am very present to prevent hitting (from him) and angry outbursts, or just mean faces.  She&#39;s been very hurt by this before.  The Mom is very nice but really only steps in after it&#39;s a problem or some sort of aggression has begun.  I have told him firmly that he cannot be mean to my dd...it&#39;s not OK.  The problem is:  this type of situation is exhausting for me.  At times, I&#39;ve just asked that my two older kids go to their house to play or asked their three older kids here to play to give all of us a break.....and I thought it would start to resolve as this little boy got older, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
 happening.  I have a feeling when we&#39;re not around the kids are left to their own devices a lot, but I&#39;m not sure.  Any advice....other than doing what I&#39;m already doing?  <br/>
Thanks...<br/>

Duncan is *very* social and likes to be surrounded by friends. I know <br/>
that he loves his friends and his brother and that he wants them to <br/>
want to be around him. It&#39;s important to *him* to be someone they want <br/>
to be around. I can help.<br/>

pissed! And, I&#39;d let him know (not hysterically, but not necessarily<br/>
calmly or sweetly, either) that I don&#39;t like being hit by ANYone and<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hang around for that. You don&#39;t say how old he is, but I<br/>
would let him know *very clearly* that hitting and otherwise<br/>
physically or verbally abusing people for ANY reason makes people go<br/>
away, and unless he wants to be very lonely, he needs to figure out<br/>
some other better way to express himself and his wide range of<br/>
feelings. I would not take it personally or make it personal. I<br/>
would present these facts to him and not sugar-coat them. Really,<br/>
you&#39;ll be helping him master an extremely off-putting mannerism that<br/>
he has adopted that is just not going to work out for him in the long<br/>
run or the short run. Hitting isn&#39;t cool, and he needs to understand<br/>
this. You can help by brainstorming with him other better ways of<br/>
expressing himself.<br/>

I had posted at my lilaguide group about this topic...sorta. It was<br/>
about the idea (started over at Always Learning) of &quot;how to screw up<br/>
unschooling&quot; and I asked members to blog about that and the idea of<br/>
&quot;unparenting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So here are a couple blog posts I wanted to share. Maybe some more<br/>
folks will blog on the topic and share links to their blogs. I still<br/>
plan to do it...just running behind as usual (but wait, how can I be<br/>
behind myself??).lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33151778">Fogging is a term for something I do with people who seem unable to hear<br/>
anything unless they&#39;re already saying it.  A friend told me she&#39;s seen me<br/>
do it in certain situations and she&#39;s calls it fogging.  I&#39;ve never heard it<br/>
called anything and I certainly didn&#39;t invent it.  Maybe some would call it<br/>
mirroring, in a way, but that&#39;s not really it.  I think of it as integrity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564698403">I am guilty of using the &quot;unparenting&quot; term but my definition is<br/>
different from those that use it as a slam against unschooling parents<br/>
that are giving their children respect and freedom.   My use of the<br/>
term is when I see a parent laying claim to the label of unschooler<br/>
but what I see them doing is unparenting.... let me give an example.    <br/>
<br/>
We knew a family where there was a 12 yr old and a 4 yr old and the<br/>
mother was claiming to be an unschooler... I challenged her claim<br/>
based on my observation that there were no books in her house, just a<br/>
very few toys(money was NOT an issue as far as resources) and she<br/>
complained constantly of how demanding her 4 yr old was (Can you<br/>
BELIEVE she wants ME to PLAY with her ALL DAY???)   <br/>
<br/>
She also had arbitrary rules out the whazoo!   Bedtime was strictly<br/>
enforced (to give mom a break... from what I asked?), they weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed certain foods, weren&#39;t allowed to go here and there on the<br/>
computer (she had all these crazy filters)  weren&#39;t allowed to have a<br/>
My Space or Facebook acct ...all email had to go through mom&#39;s account<br/>
and on and on.  They were also required to do math every day because<br/>
the mother just thought that couldn&#39;t be left undone and kids just<br/>
won&#39;t choose to do that without being made.   <br/>
<br/>
Mom was obsessed with having a spotless house but wanted to do very<br/>
little of the actual cleaning ... my kids slept over and after all the<br/>
kids were settling down for the night the child had to leave her<br/>
friends and go downstairs to clean up the &quot;mess you and your friends<br/>
made&quot; which entailed washing dishes, sweeping the floor, mopping the<br/>
floor, vacuuming carpets, taking out garbage etc ... the other kids<br/>
felt bad and pitched in to help..(bear in mind that prior to the<br/>
settling down phase of the night entire families were present at this<br/>
party invited by the parents.<br/>
    <br/>
The mom also bragged about spending 10-12 hours a day in marathon<br/>
video gaming sessions and admitted to wondering what the kids ate or<br/>
did during those times because she wasn&#39;t paying attention to them.  <br/>
Her kids were sneaky about food and treats, miserable, angry and<br/>
unkind to friends, constantly negative and so forth.    I will have to<br/>
admit it was my first experience with someone claiming to be an<br/>
unschooler that in my opinion was unparenting.    This same mom put<br/>
her kids back in school last year because the youngest was so annoying<br/>
by wanting mom to constantly play games, read etc and the older child<br/>
was according to the dad &quot;was going to have to go to school if she was<br/>
still as dumb next year as she is now&quot; AHHHH!   They even had a family<br/>
joke where the older child would point to the younger child and say<br/>
&quot;rocket scientist&quot; and then to herself and say &quot;burger flipper&quot;.   The<br/>
whole situation was just heartbreaking for me to watch.     <br/>
<br/>
Anyway it was my experience with just cringing when I would hear her<br/>
tell other people she was an unschooler!   UGH!   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway to me unparenting is not being present with your children, not<br/>
allowing them freedom, not trusting them or giving them your time,<br/>
attention and unconditional love.  <br/>
