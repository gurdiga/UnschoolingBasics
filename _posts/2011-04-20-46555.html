<div id="ygrps-yiv-681463874">The New England Unschooling Conference is in August in Wakefield, MA---just north of Boston. There will be over 100 families there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the Ohio/midwest families, the Waterpark Gathering is in May in Sandusky, OH; and CRU (Convergence of Radical Unschoolers) is coming up, but I do not know the date.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also LIFE is Good Unschooling Conference in Vancouver, WA in May and Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference in San Diego in September for West Coasters. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Toronto Unschooling Conference is in September in Toronto. Summer Montreal Unschoolers&#39; Gathering is in Quebec in June.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ARGH (Autodidact Radical Gathering of Homeschoolers) is in the mountains of Tennessee this coming weekend. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are regular gatherings all over the continent. You just have to make an effort to look them up. The unschooling circuitriders keeps a current list of gatherings and reminds you monthly what&#39;s coming up. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingcircuitriders/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingcircuitriders/</a><br/>

We live in SE CT,  and are looking for other unschoolers for our two young <br/>
children. I recently joined the New England unschoolers yahoo group with hopes <br/>
to find others that may have similar interests. Are you possibly in South <br/>
County? <br/>
