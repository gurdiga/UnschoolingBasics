<div id="ygrps-yiv-674202597">Well, get yourself over to Mr. Bruhn&#39;s school. :) He&#39;ll let you try out a <br/>
class if you want to get a feel for things. Tomorrow is not a good day -- it&#39;s <br/>
belt party day. OTOH, maybe you could come and just hang out and meet people -- <br/>
like me. :)<br/>
<br/>
The name of the school is K.C. Chung and the phone number is 561-220-8249.  <br/>
The address is 259 SW Monterey Road (at the foot of the Palm City bridge). Feel <br/>
free to write me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marbleface@...">marbleface@...</a> if you want directions or anything. Or <br/>
give me a call.<br/>

Hi Nance<br/>
<br/>
We would love to find a good program and we ARE in your area.  We are <br/>
actually in Florida Unschoolers :)  My son was in a great program <br/>
before but the program has changed since he was involved.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
