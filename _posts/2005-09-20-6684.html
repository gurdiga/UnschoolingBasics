<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230208167">THe question about kids that leave school with &quot;only an 8th grade&quot;<br/>
education prompted me to import this link. This is an extensive list<br/>
of elementary and H.S. drop outs that are well known. I think formal<br/>
education is highly overrated, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/lists/dropouts.html">http://www.angelfire.com/stars4/lists/dropouts.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Think of the negative feelings and self-image that kids failing school<br/>
develop. I believe the reason many &quot;drop outs&quot; struggle, is all the<br/>
negativity surrounding their struggle in school. If those same kids<br/>
could have been free to explore the world on their own terms, the<br/>
negative self image would not be attached to a lack of education...or<br/>
rather, a self-education.<br/>
<br/>
A few are strong enought to maintain their individuality and strength<br/>
after dropping out of school for various reasons, but many are bruised<br/>
and damaged, believing they failed, rather than the system failing THEM.<br/>
<br/>
So it isn&#39;t the lack of formal education that is ever the problem, it<br/>
is the inability to SELF-educate that caused problems for some drop<br/>
outs. The damage is just too much by the time they finally leave.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683531709">Hello wise unschoolers!<br/>
I&#39;m Karen.  Wife of 11 years to John.  Proud mama of 3 boys, Saylor 6, Stone<br/>
4, and  Sage 10 months.<br/>
We&#39;ve knows since Saylor was a wee baby that we&#39;d homeschool.  As I became<br/>
more informed, I discovered that unschooling was such a natural progression<br/>
of the way we&#39;ve lived our lives with our children from the beginning, so it<br/>
really just FEELS right.  It&#39;s so freeing to think that we really can live<br/>
this way for as long as we want, not just until they turn the magic age of 5<br/>
and we have to turn them over to &#39;experts&#39;.<br/>
We live in Sioux Falls, SD.  Moved here about a year ago from Rapid City,<br/>
SD.  Had a very hard time transitioning, but I think I&#39;m finally feeling<br/>
settled.  <br/>
I&#39;m a DONA certified Doula,  My passion is anything related to pregnancy,<br/>
birth and breastfeeding!  Saylor was born in the hospital, Stone at home<br/>
with a midwife, and Sage at home unassisted.  Huge advocate of home birth!<br/>
(for obvious reasons!)<br/>
I know I will have lots of questions of you all, and have already had<br/>
several of them answered, as I&#39;ve been reading along for a while, now.<br/>
Looking forward to making some lasting relationships, as well!  Bound to<br/>
happen! :)<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
Karen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119112312">I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions on any gaming stuff that<br/>
would be appropriate for a 6yo (and also im sure the 4yo would want to<br/>
play).<br/>
<br/>
And I mean, what system? and then, what games to go along with that system?<br/>
playstation, nintendo, gamecube, gameboy sp??????<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s all greek to me!<br/>
<br/>
i think i&#39;m ready to make the leap.  saylor has a friend who has a<br/>
playstation 2 and he really likes to TRY to play it, but seems that most of<br/>
the games are too hard.<br/>
<br/>
help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96669399">My opinion is that Gamecube is more suitable for<br/>
younger children, when you compare it to the xbox and<br/>
PS2.  I think that all the systems have easier games,<br/>
but the gamecube just seems less fragile than the<br/>
other two.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also a lot of the new &quot;plug &#39;n play&quot; type<br/>
games that are pretty good for young kids.  I know my<br/>
4 year old has enjoyed one we bought (inexpensive,<br/>
under $20) with older games like Pac-man.  He is<br/>
getting the Spongebob one for Christmas (there is also<br/>
a Spiderman one, Disney one, etc.).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We started with a gameboy and a simple game called Muppet Pinball (just  like <br/>
pinball).  That got lost and I&#39;m sad about it as it was the only one  I could <br/>
play!<br/>
 <br/>
We also have a gamecube.  I think Nick&#39;s favorite game is Mario  Kart.   You <br/>
could only race yourself (time trials) and get the  hang of it and not get <br/>
frustrated.  He figured out Monkey Ball pretty  quickly, too and I love that one <br/>
for the spatial aspect of it.  Both of  these are much harder on GameBoy.<br/>
 <br/>
If I had to do it all over, I think I would have started with the  GameCube.<br/>
 <br/>
He just got Madagascar and he LOVES it.  It might not be a good  starter <br/>
because there is more figuring stuff out than just getting to  play.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m ready for our next game.....I need help too!  <br/>

And I am almost certain that Target and Kmart sell<br/>

 <br/>
We have Nintendo, Super Nintendo, PS1 and Nintendo64... my oldest 2 (ages  <br/>
5.5 and 3.5) prefer PS1 and Nintendo64 and play games like the Super Mario  <br/>
games, Need for Speed (they just like driving the cars around), Crash Bandicoot  <br/>
games, Spyro the Dragon games. My son likes some of the Star Wars race-type  <br/>
games as well as Gauntlet (kind of a medieval-type game).<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t have any of the new games systems, as these we&#39;ve had over the  <br/>
years pre-kids, and they work just fine, so I&#39;m not so familiar with the newer  <br/>
versions. My son prefers the challenges of some of the games, while my daughter  <br/>
likes just moving things around. Great for working that hand-eye <br/>
coordination!  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would agree that these older systems are good for<br/>
younger kids.  And the games aren&#39;t as fragile, since<br/>
the games for the Nintendo ones are cartridges, rather<br/>
than disks.  Gaming stores, such as Game Stop, sell<br/>
these systems and games used and they are fairly<br/>
inexpensive.<br/>
