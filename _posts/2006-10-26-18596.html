<div id="ygrps-yiv-797269755">Hi everyone!  I just joined minutes ago and wanted to send my intro<br/>
before my day gets too hectic.  :o)  I&#39;m Valerie, 28, married to Jason,<br/>
29.  We have 2 children, Shawn-9 and Haley-5.  I&#39;ve been &#39;book<br/>
homeschooling&#39; my son since he was 4, so we&#39;re in our 5th year.   Yes, I<br/>
do believe I&#39;ve been homeschooling since birth with both kids.  I am<br/>
here to get more info about unschooling.  That&#39;s what the group is all<br/>
about, right?   We live in Fayetteville, NC.  Jason is stationed at Ft.<br/>
Bragg, he&#39;s active duty Army.  :o)  I enjoy reading, baking, shopping,<br/>
sewing and chatting online and in person with friends--over coffee of<br/>
course!  I recently got a weekend job at JoAnn --this could mean trouble<br/>
for me since I *love* fabric and sewing.  I just needed some time to<br/>
myself, I haven&#39;t worked in 5 yrs, and also wanted to make some extra<br/>
money on the side.  We bought our first home last year and are<br/>
discovering just how much money that costs to keep up with!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, enough about me.  I want to hear more about Unschooling.  I know<br/>
a little but would love to hear how you all got into unschooling vs.<br/>
typical book-schooling method.  We ourselves use the internet, library,<br/>
read lots of books on history and science, Shawn reads fun books by<br/>
himself and reads to me also, we do math worksheets and language arts<br/>
worksheets as well.  We &quot;wing it&quot; when it comes to spelling, history,<br/>
science, etc.  Haley is still in play mode, she likes to write her abc&#39;s<br/>
and some words, but mostly loves for me to read to her and play ponies<br/>
with her.  :o)  I love this age!<br/>
 <br/>
Chat later!<br/>

<br/>
We unschooled from the day we removed them from school. I knew I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to make the same mistakes the school made so we tried <br/>
something different. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I got a chuckle out of this because my 8 year old daughter would be <br/>
reading the history and science books for fun. :-) <br/>
