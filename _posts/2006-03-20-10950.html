Do any of you blog on the homeschool blogger?  Some homeschoolers are<br/>
boycotting them because they have banner ads for the Pearls, who<br/>
advocate &quot;training&quot; children by beating them with plumbing supplies<br/>
because they&#39;re cheap and won&#39;t leave bruises.  Here&#39;s a mothering.com<br/>
discussion about it:<br/>

<br/>
A bit about the owner of homeschoolblogger defending the Pearls:<br/>
<br/>
In an article published today about a child abuse case in NC, Gina<br/>
Suarez, publisher of Homeschoolblogger.com, is quoted defending the<br/>
use of plumbing supply lines to beat your child.    &quot;[The Pearls] are<br/>
talking about something that would fit in a purse,&quot; Suarez said. &quot;The<br/>
only way you can kill a child with that is by shoving it down his<br/>
throat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article where the Pearls (the dad on this page) tell women<br/>
to stay with husbands even if they beat them, beat the kids, or molest<br/>
the kids.  If he won&#39;t stop molesting the kids you can have him<br/>
arrested and testify against him but you should be waiting &quot;with open<br/>
arms&quot; for him when he gets out.  UGH.<br/>
