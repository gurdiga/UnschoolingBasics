<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823687542">My daughter and I would like to learn some German, and I thought <br/>
someone here might know of a fun program.  It could be on the computer <br/>
or video/DVD, but I want something the whole family can enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882515211">We really like Rosetta Stone, even my then-6yo could use it.  Probably even younger children as well.  It&#39;s based on the premise of learning a language directly rather than through translation and is used by the Peace Corps, among others.  It&#39;s expensive, but they have periodic sales (I think we got ours on a Valentine&#39;s sale) and they offer a 6month complete refund if you&#39;re not satisfied, so it&#39;s really risk-free.  Also, they allow you to trade in old DVD&#39;s when they upgrade to a new version.  There may be some sort of fee, but it&#39;s a good deal.<br/>
