<div id="ygrps-yiv-454186965">There was a link provided, which I no longer have but could be found on the UB yahoogroup site. I went there, scrolled down to the bottom and clicked the blue link. Then I clicked on the left side of the page where it said listen/download and opened the download to iTunes. There are two sides to the &quot;tape&quot; so you have two dl 2 files. <br/>
Good luck! <br/>

original post.  A transcript would be wonderful... plus searchable for<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431786722">I think Hayden JUST figgered out how!!!<br/>
We can make movies from our little camera on the laptop... So, I could be<br/>
listening and &#39;terp it for ya!<br/>
The quality will be less than ideal but it&#39;ll be available.  And that talk<br/>
is easy, it&#39;s my FAVORITE!!<br/>
That is going on Next Week&#39;s list - Life Is Good Conference this weekend ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have this dream of converting all the available audio to ASL for Adrean,<br/>
her family, and the countless others like them!<br/>
I wanna do big, beautiful productions, worthy of the information *and* the<br/>
mere idea of this project overwhelms me! Where to begin? Who&#39;s got Cash?<br/>
Lee Stranahan, I need your help!! :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921594436">Awesome!   Thanks, Diana!<br/>
<br/>
As part of that production I don&#39;t mind doing ASL translations of what<br/>
already exists in text.  It&#39;s good to have concise summaries of<br/>
introductory concepts ready so the material won&#39;t be too overwhelming.<br/>
 The deaf/signing community doesn&#39;t even have unschooling on its<br/>
radar, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533632761">I think the Deaf Unschooling Revolution of the 21st Century could make the<br/>
Deaf Power Revolution of the 20th Century seem measly by comparison!! :D<br/>
And I wanna be on the front edge of THAT!!!<br/>
