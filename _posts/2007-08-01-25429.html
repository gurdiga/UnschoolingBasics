 </span></blockquote>Hi MystikMomma and all,<br/>
<br/>
this is my first post after a bit of lurking.<br/>
<br/>
Can I call you MM for short, or just Elissa, lol?<br/>
<br/>
Your comment &quot;BE there when he plays&quot; really caught my attention. As <br/>
someone who would not probably be considered an unschooler as yet (I <br/>
have been home edding for six years, mostly unstructured approach), <br/>
I still find myself torn between housework and playing with the <br/>
kids. I really like the idea of getting involved with the kids&#39; <br/>
games and although the kids willingly help with chores, etc. I <br/>
wonder what your advice would be for getting into a good space to <br/>
participate regularly in the kids&#39; games. I get so distracted time-<br/>
wise as it is and often my hubbie says I am unorganised and don&#39;t <br/>
prioritise with tasks. I say this not to bag him, or to elicit <br/>
a &#39;you poor downtrodden wife&#39;, response but to give you an idea of <br/>
my personality and issues. I am quite a divergent thinker, but I do <br/>
try and value order too, lol. I am pretty good at silly, dinosaur <br/>
vs. action man scenarios, but find it hard when my 7 year old wants <br/>
to play, as she often has a full script in her mind, even for my <br/>
character. I find it hard not to tune out when being told &quot;now you <br/>
have to be the brown foal and you say....&quot;, etc. I hope all of the <br/>
more experienced unschoolers won&#39;t mind me asking what is probably a <br/>
basic question, but go ahead and have a chuckle at me - I&#39;m smiling <br/>
as I write, so why not? Does it come naturally to you all to play, <br/>
or do you get bored? I am really keen to explore this, as I know <br/>
play is a good way to connect with your child on their level.<br/>
<br/>
Thanking you in advance for your thoughts,<br/>
<br/>
Cathy.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356648355">~~I still find myself torn between housework and playing with the<br/>
kids~~<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing....I was just writing about this the last few days. If you<br/>
get a minute, go google &quot;Advice to Myself&quot; by Louise Erdrich. It&#39;s a<br/>
really great poem I&#39;ve been focused on lately. Inspirational stuff that.<br/>
<br/>
Make the housework a time to play with the kids! Truly.<br/>
I didn&#39;t learn this as a child, so it&#39;s a bit counterintuitive for me.<br/>
But many unschoolers helped me learn that housework isn&#39;t drudgery. It<br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;boring&quot;. It CAN be a game.<br/>
<br/>
Ciara and I will literally POUR water on the floor. We slop around in<br/>
it with rags on our feet. It feels really cool to swish around the<br/>
floor in soapy water...kinda like Pippi Longstocking.:)<br/>
<br/>
Then we take small towels and start pushing those around with our feet<br/>
to dry it all up. It&#39;s a big, laughing game and the floor really does<br/>
get clean!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always great at making it a game. But at least I don&#39;t nag<br/>
them. Once in a while I DO hit a point where I&#39;m like &quot;I can&#39;t take<br/>
this nasty mess anymore you guys!! HELP me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hit that point last night, when every floor felt like a layer of<br/>
soda was on it! I had a moment of &quot;this house is so disgusting I can&#39;t<br/>
STAND it&quot;. This morning, I got up and mopped and did some housework<br/>
before anyone was awake and miraculously I&#39;m feeling better.:)<br/>
<br/>
A friend is coming over to help me get organized and clean tomorrow.<br/>
Cool. The kids will undoubtedly help out too....it&#39;s in their nature<br/>
to be involved in whatever looks interesting at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
As far as dropping the housework to play....yeah, I think that&#39;s<br/>
really great. There are times to say &quot;give me a minute, I really feel<br/>
a need to finish this first&quot; and there are times to drop it. <br/>
<br/>
What I had written about a couple days ago, on  this topic was dishes<br/>
specifically. I said that when your child needs you, are the dishes<br/>
going to feel sad that you leave them? Look into your child&#39;s eyes and<br/>
decide if the dishes are more important or your child.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, the dishes will still be there when you get back! I<br/>
keep thinking they might go away, but they never do.;) <br/>

<br/>
your honest sharing reminded me we are all human and it&#39;s true - we don&#39;t<br/>
need to maintain a functional relationhip with the dishes. I know my kids<br/>
are almost always likely to pitch in if I either stay lighthearted, or confess<br/>
honestly that I&#39;m feeling overwhlemed by the mess and could do with some<br/>
help. They really humble me when this happens, because they drop what they&#39;re<br/>
doing and give me a hug and then ask what they can do. Love the idea of how<br/>
you washed the floor, hey!<br/>
