<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602934135">I&#39;m for unschooling, my husband is not. I would like to gather as many<br/>
objective opinions(if that&#39;s possible) as I can,  regarding this approach to<br/>
homeschooling. I would love to hear from anyone who has given it a shot and<br/>
failed miserably, as well as from those who love it and are very successful,<br/>
or from those falling any where in between. I also want to hear from folks<br/>
who have teens, and hear from people who are grown who might have been<br/>
unschooled. I know this is a tall order but I&#39;m really needing all the input<br/>
I can get. Thanks!<br/>

You won&#39;t find the ones who&#39;ve &quot;failed&quot; here, Virginia.<br/>
 <br/>
And to &quot;fail&quot; at unschooling is to plain NOT understand it. If you&#39;re doing  <br/>
it right, if you trust that your child will learn what he needs when he needs <br/>
it  and that learning is everywhere----that we are surrounded by learning  <br/>
experiences every single day, if you truly BELIEVE that, then unschooling WILL  <br/>
&quot;work&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
What &quot;work&quot; means is debatable, I guess. In order for it to &quot;work&quot; you have  <br/>
to trust in the philosophy---that we are learning machines, that we are driven <br/>
 to learn from the minute we are born until we die----UNLESS that drive is <br/>
beaten  out of us (school does a damned good job of that---and so can parents <br/>
who  &quot;school-at-home&quot;, if they&#39;re not really careful!).<br/>
 <br/>
Joyce has said that education is a by-product of a joyful unschooling life;  <br/>
it is not the goal. <br/>
 <br/>
We can make education the goal, but who&#39;s to say what&#39;s educational?  Me? <br/>
You? The state?<br/>
 <br/>
It will vary from individual to individual. And from age to age. What if  <br/>
your child doesn&#39;t make it to adulthood? Would you prefer to say, &quot;Well, at  <br/>
least he learned what centrifugal force was!&quot; (I&#39;m on a physics kick. Today was  <br/>
physics day at the State Fair. Hundreds of high school students were there with <br/>
 their physics assignments----&quot;Be sure NOT to enjoy the fair while you&#39;re  <br/>
here----you&#39;re here to WORK!&quot; BLEAH! Duncan (8) learned more than those physics  <br/>
students AND had fun!)<br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s successful will also vary from person to person. I feel we are  <br/>
extremely successful because we trust the boys. That&#39;s the first hurdle---the  trust <br/>
issue, and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s yours. Making that paradigm shift is  HARD.<br/>
 <br/>
You will find wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschoolers here. You will find  struggling <br/>
unschoolers. You will find people who haven&#39;t quite yet made the  <br/>
commitment.You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot; because they don&#39;t exist.  <br/>
If they *understood* unschooling, then they wouldn&#39;t have left it: they&#39;d <br/>
still  be unschooling. People who will tell you that they unschooled but that it  <br/>
didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t REALLY unschool. They *may* have done nothing for a while, <br/>
 and when the kids &quot;never&quot; picked up a textbook, they abandoned unschooling <br/>
as a  waste of time. They never *got* it.<br/>
 <br/>
Swimming: there are those of us in the deep end, splashing,  floating, <br/>
diving, doing handstands underwater, telling you that the water&#39;s  fine. There are <br/>
several treading water; sometimes reaching out for our hands,  sometimes <br/>
grabbing the ledge. There are more who are hanging onto the side of  the pool, <br/>
thinking, &quot;boy, it sure looks like fun out there----how do you  float???&quot; There&#39;s a <br/>
large number actually sitting on the side with their feet  dangling in the <br/>
water insisting that they&#39;re swimming (except for math and  reading!&lt;g&gt;). And <br/>
there are those sitting in chairs under umbrellas who  have stuck a toe in and <br/>
decided that that was swimming, that the water was just  too cold, and that no <br/>
one can float in there.<br/>
 <br/>
No one can make you unschool, Virginia. You simply have to  trust. <br/>
 <br/>
I am a wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschooling mom. I have a teenager who is  <br/>
absolutely amazing---and only gets more so each and every day. My best friend  (44) <br/>
was unschooled and is an actress who runs her own production company.<br/>
 <br/>
There are websites devoted to blasting unschooling as neglectful. Google  it. <br/>
Read and read. Then go to unschooling.com and SandraDodd.com and read some  <br/>
more. All the John Holt books, Alfie Kohn, Frank Smith, Valerie Fitzenreiter,  <br/>
Ned Vare/Luz Shosie (Valerie and Ned & Luz have unschoolers that went to  <br/>
college and beyond). Tell your husband to get off his butt and do some of his  OWN <br/>
research---or did school burn that desire out of him?<br/>
 <br/>
My family really gets into discovering new things and figuring things out  <br/>
and asking questions. If your husband *doesn&#39;t*, then maybe he needs to rethink  <br/>
his own schooling----it obviously didn&#39;t do him as much good as unschooling <br/>
is  doing for *my* family.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is for every child. It&#39; not for every parent----too many can&#39;t  <br/>
get past their school baggage. I&#39;m more than thrilled to help someone learn to  <br/>
swim. But I can&#39;t (and won&#39;t) drag someone, who hates to even get wet,  <br/>
kicking and screaming into the pool.<br/>
 <br/>
If the husband is pooh-poohing the idea without even researching, then I  <br/>
have nothing to say: he doesn&#39;t want to learn, and as an unschooler, I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to coerce him by teaching him---it goes against the philosophy!  &lt;g&gt; One <br/>
tenant of unschooling is that you can&#39;t teach someone  who is unwilling to <br/>
learn!  <br/>
 <br/>
If he has some questions, I&#39;m available for answers. What does he want to  <br/>
know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735657070">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
You know I think I&#39;ve actually had an email from you before. I liked what<br/>
you said then, and I like what you say now. :)<br/>
Loved the swim analogy. I will present what you have had to say to him and<br/>
we&#39;ll go from there. His primary concern is that I&#39;ll be handicapping<br/>
Caitlin and possibly unschooling will sway her from a college education. He<br/>
says statistically people who go to college get better paying jobs, get<br/>
married, live happier more productive lives and are more well rounded than<br/>
people who don&#39;t. He recognizes that not all people who are happy and<br/>
productive, are well rounded, etc...went to college. He is just arguing that<br/>
the odds are better with a college education. There is no data to say that<br/>
unschooling has just as good as odds as a formal education and this bothers<br/>
him greatly. He is not one to take a leap of faith in anything. Faith is a<br/>
dirty word to him.<br/>

Yeah---one or two! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I liked what you said then, and I like what you say now.  :)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Loved the swim analogy. I will present what you  have had to say to him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
we&#39;ll go from there. His primary concern is that  I&#39;ll be handicapping<br/>
Caitlin and possibly unschooling will sway her from a  college education. He<br/>
says statistically people who go to college get  better paying jobs, get<br/>
married, live happier more productive lives and are  more well rounded than<br/>
people who don&#39;t. He recognizes that not all people  who are happy and<br/>
productive, are well rounded, etc...went to  college.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Statistically unschoolers who chose college do EXTREMELY well there.  <br/>
*Better* than extremely well there. Ask any college professor whom he&#39;d rather  have <br/>
in a class: an unschooler who is there because she&#39;s pursuing her passion  or <br/>
a high school graduate who&#39;s just there because it&#39;s the next step to take  <br/>
before starting to look for a job. Ask him which student adds more to his  <br/>
classroom.<br/>
 <br/>
Statistically, a person who is unschooled will pursue her  passion, will get <br/>
a job doing what she loves, will make money while  &quot;playing&quot;, will not <br/>
&quot;settle&quot; for the first guy that asks her to marry him, will  have children because <br/>
she *wants* them, and will pursue a joyful life. <br/>
 <br/>
Thousands of college graduates EACH YEAR realize that their major was a  <br/>
waste of time not to mention money!----for the $200,000 I would spend to send  <br/>
Cameron to a four year college, I could pay to open a business for him---and he  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to wait for a diploma (or for time to pursue a career: he&#39;d  <br/>
already HAVE one) OR pay back student loans!<br/>
 <br/>
I think your husband hasn&#39;t done *any* research what-so-ever on the  subject. <br/>
I&#39;ll bet he&#39;s just regurgitating what he&#39;s heard all his life. And I  heard <br/>
it too. My father used to say (and probably still does) that &quot;the  number of <br/>
years you spend in school is directly proportional to the amount of  money <br/>
you&#39;ll make.&quot; Bull-crap. For a while, I was making more grooming dogs  than my <br/>
husband was with his Masters Degree.<br/>
 <br/>
Has he read _The Billionaire Next Door_? Statistically, college grads make  <br/>
less and are less happy and fulfilled than those who pursue their  <br/>
passions....well...passionately.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He is just arguing that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the odds are better  with a college education. There is no data to say that<br/>
unschooling has just  as good as odds as a formal education and this bothers<br/>
him  greatly.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
 <br/>
The odds are better if she&#39;s happy and passionate. His data is skewed. He&#39;s  <br/>
talking only about schooled children. Creative schooled children are burned <br/>
out  by fourth or fifth grade. They lose their passions----unless they are <br/>
stronger  than the pressure of school and society. A child who is free to do and to <br/>
be and  to change is a horse of a different color---and he won&#39;t pull a plow.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t count the number of college graduates that I know who are unhappy  <br/>
and unfulfilled in their jobs. What&#39;s your  husband&#39;s history? College grad? <br/>
Degree(s)? What does he do for a  living? What does he do to make the living <br/>
worthwhile? Does he look forward  to mornings? Why? Why not? <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He is not one to take a leap of faith in anything. Faith is  a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dirty word to him.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;ll hear a lot of dirty words here. Dirty words like Trust, Respect,  <br/>
Freedom, Laughter, Joy, Learning,----and Faith. Faith in your daughter to be who  <br/>
she is now---and who she will become.<br/>

  says statistically people who go to college get  better paying jobs, get<br/>
  married, live happier more productive lives and are  more well rounded<br/>
than<br/>
  people who don&#39;t. He recognizes that not all people  who are happy and<br/>
  productive, are well rounded, etc...went to  college.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Statistically unschoolers who chose college do EXTREMELY well there.<br/>
  *Better* than extremely well there. Ask any college professor whom he&#39;d<br/>
rather  have<br/>
  in a class: an unschooler who is there because she&#39;s pursuing her passion<br/>
or<br/>
  a high school graduate who&#39;s just there because it&#39;s the next step to take<br/>
  before starting to look for a job. Ask him which student adds more to his<br/>
  classroom.<br/>
<br/>
  Statistically, a person who is unschooled will pursue her  passion, will<br/>
get<br/>
  a job doing what she loves, will make money while  &quot;playing&quot;, will not<br/>
  &quot;settle&quot; for the first guy that asks her to marry him, will  have children<br/>
because<br/>
  she *wants* them, and will pursue a joyful life.<br/>
<br/>
  Thousands of college graduates EACH YEAR realize that their major was a<br/>
  waste of time not to mention money!----for the $200,000 I would spend to<br/>
send<br/>
  Cameron to a four year college, I could pay to open a business for<br/>
him---and he<br/>
  wouldn&#39;t have to wait for a diploma (or for time to pursue a career: he&#39;d<br/>
  already HAVE one) OR pay back student loans!<br/>
<br/>
  I think your husband hasn&#39;t done *any* research what-so-ever on the<br/>
subject.<br/>
  I&#39;ll bet he&#39;s just regurgitating what he&#39;s heard all his life. And I<br/>
heard<br/>
  it too. My father used to say (and probably still does) that &quot;the  number<br/>
of<br/>
  years you spend in school is directly proportional to the amount of  money<br/>
  you&#39;ll make.&quot; Bull-crap. For a while, I was making more grooming dogs<br/>
than my<br/>
  husband was with his Masters Degree.<br/>
<br/>
  Has he read _The Billionaire Next Door_? Statistically, college grads make<br/>
  less and are less happy and fulfilled than those who pursue their<br/>
  passions....well...passionately.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  The odds are better if she&#39;s happy and passionate. His data is skewed.<br/>
He&#39;s<br/>
  talking only about schooled children. Creative schooled children are<br/>
burned<br/>
  out  by fourth or fifth grade. They lose their passions----unless they are<br/>
  stronger  than the pressure of school and society. A child who is free to<br/>
do and to<br/>
  be and  to change is a horse of a different color---and he won&#39;t pull a<br/>
plow.<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t count the number of college graduates that I know who are unhappy<br/>
  and unfulfilled in their jobs. What&#39;s your  husband&#39;s history? College<br/>
grad?<br/>
  Degree(s)? What does he do for a  living? What does he do to make the<br/>
living<br/>
  worthwhile? Does he look forward  to mornings? Why? Why not?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  He&#39;ll hear a lot of dirty words here. Dirty words like Trust, Respect,<br/>
  Freedom, Laughter, Joy, Learning,----and Faith. Faith in your daughter to<br/>
be who<br/>
  she is now---and who she will become.<br/>

People who see my car inevitably have a question or two. &lt;g&gt; I  usually smile <br/>
and say, &quot;Yeah, I scare a lot of people.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This is so outside the average American&#39;s comfort level that it&#39;s not even  <br/>
funny (unless you&#39;re sitting on *this* side of the fence---we&#39;re laughing our  <br/>
butts off! &lt;G&gt;). But most folks can&#39;t wrap their heads around this one  little <br/>
bit. And rather than think about it, just ignore it.<br/>
 <br/>
BUT....<br/>
 <br/>
If they would, for a moment, step OUT of the box and look at it completely  <br/>
objectively. Seriously weigh the pros and cons. OBJECTIVELY. Actually compare  <br/>
and contrast a life filled with passion to a life filled with classrooms. If  <br/>
they were to examine it critically, they would see, without a doubt, that a  <br/>
passionate life beats a tradiational one. Hands down. Every time. When you <br/>
start  thinking creatively and imaginatively and with your passions in mind---when <br/>
you  realize that there&#39;s nothing that can stand in your way because *you* <br/>
will find  a way----THEN it makes so much sense. THEN you can see that a life of <br/>
freedom to  be and to become who you are is the only way that will work <br/>
anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
Your husband *may* be past that ability. Many people are. But if he&#39;s  <br/>
willing to step outside his comfort zone, open his mind, and examine his  thoughts <br/>
on this, MAYBE he can give his daughter a joyful life----and the  shortest <br/>
route to a joyful adulthood is a joyful childhood---so start now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Dear Kelly:<br/>
<br/>
Well you hit a home run with me!  Thank you so very much for the past <br/>
posts on this subject.  A few weeks ago, after burning out on a <br/>
curriculum we thought we liked after only two weeks of working with <br/>
it, I had taken the plunge.  Now after pressure from family members, <br/>
I am not sure if I want to swim back to the side and &quot;say I am <br/>
swimming&quot;.  I have the pressure of our family living with my parents <br/>
and my dad (who is very ill - which is why we are here) asking when <br/>
my dd is going to do English.  My husband and I just made the <br/>
decision to unschool after years of home&quot;schooling&quot; because (1) of <br/>
the situation we are in and wanting our kids to relax and enjoy as <br/>
much of life as they can; and (2)  I know it fits best for my dd, but <br/>
am not sure about my ds.  He likes some structure in his days.     <br/>
I&#39;ve been deschooling (them and me) for a couple of weeks now - which <br/>
of course we have to from the curriculum I&#39;ve chosen. <br/>
<br/>
Now being in the center of outside family and not the freedom of my <br/>
own house, in the midst of illness, the pressure can get high at <br/>
times.  It&#39;s hard because there are not a lot of unschooling families <br/>
out there living with ill parents (or are there?)  I&#39;ve met quite a <br/>
few homeschooling families living with parents but they are doing the <br/>
sit down strict curriculums that I just won&#39;t do.  I know the <br/>
curriculums allow us to look like we are doing something.  I know <br/>
unschooling looks like they are doing nothing but I also know my kids <br/>
are learning all day long.  Hard to explain to some folks!  Trust is <br/>
the BIG word, that&#39;s for sure. Oh well, I&#39;ll dangle on the side and <br/>
read, read, read some more!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010002579">I think successful unschoolers look differently, a lot of the time, than successful schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Successful schoolers have learned how to do a lot of things superficially in an order that most school officials know how to predict.  If you are in 7th grade successfully, the school can predict that you know how to work fraction problems, how to carry in subtraction, etc. because those were taught at earlier grades.  It is an assembly line approach.<br/>
<br/>
Successful unschoolers have learned a lot of things superficially but in a completely unpredictable order.  They usually know a few topics that are near and dear to their hearts in great depth.  But a 13 year old unschooler may or may not know how to carry in subtraction but when they do come up against something they don&#39;t know, they know how to learn it quickly.  It is more of an artistic approach.<br/>
<br/>
We have unschooled for about 7 years.  My three youngest wanted to try out school this year (2 in K, one in First).  The teachers initially wanted to put them all in special ed..  Michelle couldn&#39;t completely write her name.  Dan held his pencil funny.  Marsie wasn&#39;t reading at Level 3.  All of these things are arbitrary standards that the school has set up, not developmentally based at all, and all in one skill area.<br/>
<br/>
So we went through the rigamarole of meetings, etc..  I had to be very clear with the teachers about my philosophy (unschooling) and that we wouldn&#39;t be enforcing homework and that I wasn&#39;t worried about the kids, etc..  I made sure the teachers knew that the kids were there by choice (which freaked them out) and that if their homework was done it was because the child chose to do it (which freaked them out because the kids usually like to do it).<br/>
<br/>
I just had my regular teacher conferences and the teachers have had time to get to know the kids.  Now they are described as the &quot;perfect&quot; students.  They are way above the arbitrary standards set for science and math skills.  In fact, the teacher was asking me how my kids learned math so well.  I told her it was from using the microwave and making sure nobody in our large family was taking more than their fair share of fish sticks at dinner.  I told her Danny learned his sight words by playing video games (freaked her out).  But the biggest thing is that the kids are truly interested in what is going on and I think that comes from knowing they are there by choice.<br/>
<br/>
Now Adriane (now almost 14) and Zach (11) went to school before we found unschooling.  They have zero desire  to return.  Adriane didn&#39;t pay any attention to spelling until last year when she began emailing friends.  She is awesome at math theory and learns math formulas as they come up in her life.  She has been able to live a life that would be impossible if she were tied to a curriculum.  She works out 15 hours per week and works part time at the gym teaching little kids gymnastics.  She hopes to be a gymnastics coach and has met Bella Karolyi and hopes to do an internship with him this summer.  She raises show animals which takes a couple of hours work each day and she travels the state doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is just learning to read but is doing it on his own and joyfully.  He comes to me asking to read to me.  When he was in school he simply wasn&#39;t ready developmentally to read and so was made to feel like something was wrong with him.  It took him many years of not even touching a book to get over it.  His biggest skills are spatial which aren&#39;t even addressed by curriculums.  He plays pool like a pro, he knows where the baseball is going after it is hit, he has been able to dribble a ball since he was two and this year was a member of the National Skeet and Trap Shooting championship team for his age group.  Again, traveling the state to do this.  The school says &quot;that&#39;s just extra-curricular&quot;.....I say its physics theory.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is our story.<br/>
<br/>

  I&#39;m for  unschooling, my husband is not. I would like to gather as many<br/>
  objective  opinions(if that&#39;s possible) as I can,  regarding this approach  to<br/>
  homeschooling. I would love to hear from anyone who has given it a shot  and<br/>
  failed miserably, as well as from those who love it and are very  successful,<br/>
  or from those falling any where in between. I also want to hear  from folks<br/>
  who have teens, and hear from people who are grown who might  have been<br/>
  unschooled. I know this is a tall order but I&#39;m really needing  all the input<br/>
  I can get. Thanks!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t find the ones who&#39;ve &quot;failed&quot; here, Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
  And to &quot;fail&quot; at unschooling is to plain NOT understand it. If you&#39;re doing  <br/>
  it right, if you trust that your child will learn what he needs when he needs <br/>
  it  and that learning is everywhere----that we are surrounded by learning  <br/>
  experiences every single day, if you truly BELIEVE that, then unschooling WILL  <br/>
  &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  What &quot;work&quot; means is debatable, I guess. In order for it to &quot;work&quot; you have  <br/>
  to trust in the philosophy---that we are learning machines, that we are driven <br/>
  to learn from the minute we are born until we die----UNLESS that drive is <br/>
  beaten  out of us (school does a damned good job of that---and so can parents <br/>
  who  &quot;school-at-home&quot;, if they&#39;re not really careful!).<br/>
<br/>
  Joyce has said that education is a by-product of a joyful unschooling life;  <br/>
  it is not the goal. <br/>
<br/>
  We can make education the goal, but who&#39;s to say what&#39;s educational?  Me? <br/>
  You? The state?<br/>
<br/>
  It will vary from individual to individual. And from age to age. What if  <br/>
  your child doesn&#39;t make it to adulthood? Would you prefer to say, &quot;Well, at  <br/>
  least he learned what centrifugal force was!&quot; (I&#39;m on a physics kick. Today was  <br/>
  physics day at the State Fair. Hundreds of high school students were there with <br/>
  their physics assignments----&quot;Be sure NOT to enjoy the fair while you&#39;re  <br/>
  here----you&#39;re here to WORK!&quot; BLEAH! Duncan (8) learned more than those physics  <br/>
  students AND had fun!)<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s successful will also vary from person to person. I feel we are  <br/>
  extremely successful because we trust the boys. That&#39;s the first hurdle---the  trust <br/>
  issue, and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s yours. Making that paradigm shift is  HARD.<br/>
<br/>
  You will find wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschoolers here. You will find  struggling <br/>
  unschoolers. You will find people who haven&#39;t quite yet made the  <br/>
  commitment.You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot; because they don&#39;t exist.  <br/>
  If they *understood* unschooling, then they wouldn&#39;t have left it: they&#39;d <br/>
  still  be unschooling. People who will tell you that they unschooled but that it  <br/>
  didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t REALLY unschool. They *may* have done nothing for a while, <br/>
  and when the kids &quot;never&quot; picked up a textbook, they abandoned unschooling <br/>
  as a  waste of time. They never *got* it.<br/>
<br/>
  Swimming: there are those of us in the deep end, splashing,  floating, <br/>
  diving, doing handstands underwater, telling you that the water&#39;s  fine. There are <br/>
  several treading water; sometimes reaching out for our hands,  sometimes <br/>
  grabbing the ledge. There are more who are hanging onto the side of  the pool, <br/>
  thinking, &quot;boy, it sure looks like fun out there----how do you  float???&quot; There&#39;s a <br/>
  large number actually sitting on the side with their feet  dangling in the <br/>
  water insisting that they&#39;re swimming (except for math and  reading!&lt;g&gt;). And <br/>
  there are those sitting in chairs under umbrellas who  have stuck a toe in and <br/>
  decided that that was swimming, that the water was just  too cold, and that no <br/>
  one can float in there.<br/>
<br/>
  No one can make you unschool, Virginia. You simply have to  trust. <br/>
<br/>
  I am a wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschooling mom. I have a teenager who is  <br/>
  absolutely amazing---and only gets more so each and every day. My best friend  (44) <br/>
  was unschooled and is an actress who runs her own production company.<br/>
<br/>
  There are websites devoted to blasting unschooling as neglectful. Google  it. <br/>
  Read and read. Then go to unschooling.com and SandraDodd.com and read some  <br/>
  more. All the John Holt books, Alfie Kohn, Frank Smith, Valerie Fitzenreiter,  <br/>
  Ned Vare/Luz Shosie (Valerie and Ned & Luz have unschoolers that went to  <br/>
  college and beyond). Tell your husband to get off his butt and do some of his  OWN <br/>
  research---or did school burn that desire out of him?<br/>
<br/>
  My family really gets into discovering new things and figuring things out  <br/>
  and asking questions. If your husband *doesn&#39;t*, then maybe he needs to rethink  <br/>
  his own schooling----it obviously didn&#39;t do him as much good as unschooling <br/>
  is  doing for *my* family.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is for every child. It&#39; not for every parent----too many can&#39;t  <br/>
  get past their school baggage. I&#39;m more than thrilled to help someone learn to  <br/>
  swim. But I can&#39;t (and won&#39;t) drag someone, who hates to even get wet,  <br/>
  kicking and screaming into the pool.<br/>
<br/>
  If the husband is pooh-poohing the idea without even researching, then I  <br/>
  have nothing to say: he doesn&#39;t want to learn, and as an unschooler, I&#39;m not  <br/>
  going to coerce him by teaching him---it goes against the philosophy!  &lt;g&gt; One <br/>
  tenant of unschooling is that you can&#39;t teach someone  who is unwilling to <br/>
  learn!  <br/>
<br/>
  If he has some questions, I&#39;m available for answers. What does he want to  <br/>
  know?<br/>

<br/>
Here is the problem with that statistic.....Most of the people in the &quot;didn&#39;t go to college&quot; category are people that didn&#39;t do well in traditional school.  They don&#39;t believe in their ability to learn.  They have been told their entire lives that if they can&#39;t get good grades or whatever, they will be failures.  Self-fulfilling prophecies are very real.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is that most people who go to college don&#39;t finish.  They don&#39;t have a clue who they are or what they want.  Suddenly, they are having to make all these decisions with very little experience in that skill.  It gets overwhelming for them.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane used to say she would never go to college and as a gymnastics coach hopeful it certainly isn&#39;t required to enter the field.  Now, after being on several college campuses for meets and realizing that she can continue competing through college, she wants to go and is already checking out programs.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers often go to college.  The difference is they are choosing to go for a reason, not just because it is the next thing they are supposed to do on the life list.<br/>

  Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
  You know I think I&#39;ve actually had an email from you before. I liked what<br/>
  you said then, and I like what you say now. :)<br/>
  Loved the swim analogy. I will present what you have had to say to him and<br/>
  we&#39;ll go from there. His primary concern is that I&#39;ll be handicapping<br/>
  Caitlin and possibly unschooling will sway her from a college education. He<br/>
  says statistically people who go to college get better paying jobs, get<br/>
  married, live happier more productive lives and are more well rounded than<br/>
  people who don&#39;t. He recognizes that not all people who are happy and<br/>
  productive, are well rounded, etc...went to college. He is just arguing that<br/>
  the odds are better with a college education. There is no data to say that<br/>
  unschooling has just as good as odds as a formal education and this bothers<br/>
  him greatly. He is not one to take a leap of faith in anything. Faith is a<br/>
  dirty word to him.<br/>

    I&#39;m for  unschooling, my husband is not. I would like to gather as many<br/>

  to<br/>
    homeschooling. I would love to hear from anyone who has given it a shot<br/>
  and<br/>
    failed miserably, as well as from those who love it and are very<br/>
  successful,<br/>
    or from those falling any where in between. I also want to hear  from<br/>
  folks<br/>
    who have teens, and hear from people who are grown who might  have been<br/>
    unschooled. I know this is a tall order but I&#39;m really needing  all the<br/>
  input<br/>
    I can get. Thanks!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
    You won&#39;t find the ones who&#39;ve &quot;failed&quot; here, Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
    And to &quot;fail&quot; at unschooling is to plain NOT understand it. If you&#39;re<br/>
  doing<br/>
    it right, if you trust that your child will learn what he needs when he<br/>
  needs<br/>
    it  and that learning is everywhere----that we are surrounded by learning<br/>
    experiences every single day, if you truly BELIEVE that, then unschooling<br/>
  WILL<br/>
    &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
    What &quot;work&quot; means is debatable, I guess. In order for it to &quot;work&quot; you<br/>
  have<br/>
    to trust in the philosophy---that we are learning machines, that we are<br/>
  driven<br/>
    to learn from the minute we are born until we die----UNLESS that drive is<br/>
    beaten  out of us (school does a damned good job of that---and so can<br/>
  parents<br/>
    who  &quot;school-at-home&quot;, if they&#39;re not really careful!).<br/>
<br/>
    Joyce has said that education is a by-product of a joyful unschooling<br/>
  life;<br/>
    it is not the goal.<br/>
<br/>
    We can make education the goal, but who&#39;s to say what&#39;s educational?  Me?<br/>
    You? The state?<br/>
<br/>
    It will vary from individual to individual. And from age to age. What if<br/>
    your child doesn&#39;t make it to adulthood? Would you prefer to say, &quot;Well,<br/>
  at<br/>
    least he learned what centrifugal force was!&quot; (I&#39;m on a physics kick.<br/>
  Today was<br/>
    physics day at the State Fair. Hundreds of high school students were there<br/>
  with<br/>
    their physics assignments----&quot;Be sure NOT to enjoy the fair while you&#39;re<br/>
    here----you&#39;re here to WORK!&quot; BLEAH! Duncan (8) learned more than those<br/>
  physics<br/>
    students AND had fun!)<br/>
<br/>
    What&#39;s successful will also vary from person to person. I feel we are<br/>
    extremely successful because we trust the boys. That&#39;s the first<br/>
  hurdle---the  trust<br/>
    issue, and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s yours. Making that paradigm shift is  HARD.<br/>
<br/>
    You will find wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschoolers here. You will find<br/>
  struggling<br/>
    unschoolers. You will find people who haven&#39;t quite yet made the<br/>
    commitment.You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    You won&#39;t find unschoolers who &quot;failed miserably&quot; because they don&#39;t<br/>
  exist.<br/>
    If they *understood* unschooling, then they wouldn&#39;t have left it: they&#39;d<br/>
    still  be unschooling. People who will tell you that they unschooled but<br/>
  that it<br/>
    didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t REALLY unschool. They *may* have done nothing for a<br/>
  while,<br/>
    and when the kids &quot;never&quot; picked up a textbook, they abandoned unschooling<br/>
    as a  waste of time. They never *got* it.<br/>
<br/>
    Swimming: there are those of us in the deep end, splashing,  floating,<br/>
    diving, doing handstands underwater, telling you that the water&#39;s  fine.<br/>
  There are<br/>
    several treading water; sometimes reaching out for our hands,  sometimes<br/>
    grabbing the ledge. There are more who are hanging onto the side of  the<br/>
  pool,<br/>
    thinking, &quot;boy, it sure looks like fun out there----how do you  float???&quot;<br/>
  There&#39;s a<br/>
    large number actually sitting on the side with their feet  dangling in the<br/>
    water insisting that they&#39;re swimming (except for math and  reading!&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
  And<br/>
    there are those sitting in chairs under umbrellas who  have stuck a toe in<br/>
  and<br/>
    decided that that was swimming, that the water was just  too cold, and<br/>
  that no<br/>
    one can float in there.<br/>
<br/>
    No one can make you unschool, Virginia. You simply have to  trust.<br/>
<br/>
    I am a wildly &quot;successful&quot; unschooling mom. I have a teenager who is<br/>
    absolutely amazing---and only gets more so each and every day. My best<br/>
  friend  (44)<br/>
    was unschooled and is an actress who runs her own production company.<br/>
<br/>
    There are websites devoted to blasting unschooling as neglectful. Google<br/>
  it.<br/>
    Read and read. Then go to unschooling.com and SandraDodd.com and read some<br/>
    more. All the John Holt books, Alfie Kohn, Frank Smith, Valerie<br/>
  Fitzenreiter,<br/>
    Ned Vare/Luz Shosie (Valerie and Ned & Luz have unschoolers that went to<br/>
    college and beyond). Tell your husband to get off his butt and do some of<br/>
  his  OWN<br/>
    research---or did school burn that desire out of him?<br/>
<br/>
    My family really gets into discovering new things and figuring things out<br/>
    and asking questions. If your husband *doesn&#39;t*, then maybe he needs to<br/>
  rethink<br/>
    his own schooling----it obviously didn&#39;t do him as much good as<br/>
  unschooling<br/>
    is  doing for *my* family.<br/>
<br/>
    Unschooling is for every child. It&#39; not for every parent----too many can&#39;t<br/>
    get past their school baggage. I&#39;m more than thrilled to help someone<br/>
  learn to<br/>
    swim. But I can&#39;t (and won&#39;t) drag someone, who hates to even get wet,<br/>
    kicking and screaming into the pool.<br/>
<br/>
    If the husband is pooh-poohing the idea without even researching, then I<br/>
    have nothing to say: he doesn&#39;t want to learn, and as an unschooler, I&#39;m<br/>
  not<br/>
    going to coerce him by teaching him---it goes against the philosophy!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  One<br/>
    tenant of unschooling is that you can&#39;t teach someone  who is unwilling to<br/>
    learn!<br/>
<br/>
    If he has some questions, I&#39;m available for answers. What does he want to<br/>
    know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490221160">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not sure about my son.  He likes some structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So give him some structure....but it doesn&#39;t have to be in a workbook unless that is how he likes it.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started unschooling, dh wasn&#39;t exactly on board.  The kids kept asking when we were going to do school.  So I started projects.  We put in a garden, we built a shed, we raised animals, we baked, we played on the computer.  You know how kids are....you start something and they definitely want in to see what it is all about.<br/>
<br/>
The kids had a bit of structure.  I had specific skills to talk to dh about when he got home.  After a bit, the kids would either continue the project with me or wander off.  Dh calmed down and realized that the kids were learning.<br/>
<br/>
Now I always have my projects going that sometimes the kids are interested in (Marsie, age 7, is helping me spin yarn).  But the kids have their projects.  Adriane is remodeling her bedroom, doing all the planning, painting, building herself.  Zach is practicing golf.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to send me all the articles on education and traditional homeschooling.  I would try to explain to her that we weren&#39;t doing that.  Then she spent a week with the kids.  She said &quot;I don&#39;t know how it works, but it obviously works.&quot;  She works in admissions at a state university.<br/>

  &gt; You&#39;re welcome---and I&#39;m not writing *just* to you---there are over <br/>
  two  <br/>
  &gt; hundred people on this list! I may hit a home run with one or two! <br/>
  &lt;G&gt; <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
  Dear Dear Kelly:<br/>
<br/>
  Well you hit a home run with me!  Thank you so very much for the past <br/>
  posts on this subject.  A few weeks ago, after burning out on a <br/>
  curriculum we thought we liked after only two weeks of working with <br/>
  it, I had taken the plunge.  Now after pressure from family members, <br/>
  I am not sure if I want to swim back to the side and &quot;say I am <br/>
  swimming&quot;.  I have the pressure of our family living with my parents <br/>
  and my dad (who is very ill - which is why we are here) asking when <br/>
  my dd is going to do English.  My husband and I just made the <br/>
  decision to unschool after years of home&quot;schooling&quot; because (1) of <br/>
  the situation we are in and wanting our kids to relax and enjoy as <br/>
  much of life as they can; and (2)  The big question is... HOW??? I will have to work on that.<br/>
  Anyone have any thoughts? Suggestions? I&#39;ve been deschooling (them and me) for a couple of weeks now - which <br/>
  of course we have to from the curriculum I&#39;ve chosen. <br/>
<br/>
  Now being in the center of outside family and not the freedom of my <br/>
  own house, in the midst of illness, the pressure can get high at <br/>
  times.  It&#39;s hard because there are not a lot of unschooling families <br/>
  out there living with ill parents (or are there?)  I&#39;ve met quite a <br/>
  few homeschooling families living with parents but they are doing the <br/>
  sit down strict curriculums that I just won&#39;t do.  I know the <br/>
  curriculums allow us to look like we are doing something.  I know <br/>
  unschooling looks like they are doing nothing but I also know my kids <br/>
  are learning all day long.  Hard to explain to some folks!  Trust is <br/>
  the BIG word, that&#39;s for sure. Oh well, I&#39;ll dangle on the side and <br/>
  read, read, read some more!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about your particular situation, but there are those of us that do get a lot of strife from our families.  My mother absolutely detests that I am homeschooling (I don&#39;t even mention the word unschooling around her) We see each other often and things are fine as long as we don&#39;t talk about homeschooling, religion, poilitics, gay rights, vegetarianism, me working from home, or health care options.  (So we talk about knitting, home redecorating, and gardening - all safe subjects).  Just yesterday she was at my house and Keon (6yo) and I were rolling change.  Mom asked Keon, &quot;So what did you do for school today.&quot;  Keon answered (a tad indignantly), &quot;I&#39;m *home*schooled now!&quot;  Mom said, &quot;Yes; but what did you do for homeschool.&quot;  He just rolled his eyes.  So I looked up at her and said, &quot;Ssshhhh, we are doing math.&quot;  (and rolled my eyes).  We then separated pennies into pre-1983 and post 1983 all while looking for older pennies (pre-1950 wheat pennies - we actually found one).  So I looked at her and said, &quot;History.&quot;  Then Keon mentioned that we needed to shine the pennies (we are going on a Disney trip soon and we collect pressed pennies)  I asked him how we could shine them and he said, &quot;If we put them in catsup or spaghetti sauce they will get clean.&quot;  I again looked at Mom and said, &quot;Science.&quot;   She shut up (for now).  I know we will have many more conversations on how my children will be behind their peers (NOT) or missing in social opportunities (oh like resource day, gymnastics, scouting, church) and unprepared for life after their teen years (sort of like their father who has a professional job and is essentially &quot;home-colleged.&quot;)  <br/>
<br/>
My mother has several friends who are educators or school administrators and they all are very nice people (I know them as well).  They keep telling my mother about these wonderful programs taht are in their schools.  How my children could excel by being enrolled.  How much they would benefit from the daily social environment at their particular schools.  My mother buys into it.  She doesn&#39;t understand why I refused to submit an application for the arts magnate for my two younger children.  She doesn&#39;t understand why I think that magnate schools are wrong and that *all* schools should have the same opportunities that the &quot;chosen few&quot; are given.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t live with it on a daily basis.  It does come up often enough, though, to make it annoying.  I would probably do about the same I am doing now, but then I&#39;m pretty surly when it comes to people pushing at my decisions.<br/>

(2)  I know it fits best for my dd, but <br/>

I&#39;ve  been deschooling (them and me) for a couple of weeks now - which <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Structure can come in the form of a daytimer. Both my boys have one---well.  <br/>
Cameron has his own; Duncan shares mine. Cameron&#39;s more my dreamer----very  <br/>
artistic and &quot;go-with-the-flow&quot;, but he&#39;s soooo busy lately, that he *needs* to  <br/>
keep a handle on what he&#39;s doing when.<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan likes more structure. He likes knowing what we&#39;re doing tomorrow and  <br/>
the day after and the day after. He&#39;s constantly aware of what time it is.  He <br/>
likes a *plan*. (Makes it harder for me sometimes, &#39;cause I&#39;m a little  more <br/>
&quot;take-it-as-it-comes&quot;!) Today we&#39;re going to mix up a bunch of stuff  in the <br/>

&quot;teacher&quot;, you must &quot;know&quot;----we &quot;need&quot; to have standards and progress and  <br/>
documentation and comparisons to make sure we&#39;re learning! &lt;G&gt;), you and  your husband <br/>
could put your fears to rest, and the foundation for that next  unschooling book <br/>
would be in the works! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Use a teacher&#39;s log, if that would make it easier----they&#39;re at all the  <br/>
teacher supply stores. A journal. A diary. A daytimer could be  enough----I keep <br/>
all our stuff in there---especially &quot;firsts&quot;---like Cameron&#39;s  first movie <br/>
schedule and Duncan&#39;s first reading of a book. Things like  multiplication: &quot;Hey <br/>
mom, did you know five fives are 25?&quot; Or  yesterday&#39;s discussion of molecules <br/>
(here in our house). The poem Duncan  wrote. My &quot;NON-reading&quot; 16 year old&#39;s <br/>
picking up Hesse&#39;s _Siddhartha_ to  read! &lt;BWG&gt; I have to document due to my <br/>
state laws (and &quot;keep attendance&quot;  :-P~~~*), so it&#39;s become habit. But it&#39;s fun to <br/>
look through the last few years  to see what we&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
That way, if someone asks----AND you&#39;re in a generous mood!  &lt;g&gt;----you can <br/>
reel off what&#39;s been discussed and thought through and  attempted and learned <br/>
and mastered. All in a handy dandy notebook.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re NOT in a generous mood, you can tell them to take a hike. These  <br/>
are *your* children, and *you* will make the decisions regarding their  <br/>
education. Thank you. End of discussion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &gt; out there living with ill parents (or are there?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t know about your particular situation, but there are those of us<br/>
that do get a lot of strife from our families.  My mother absolutely detests<br/>
that I am homeschooling (I don&#39;t even mention the word unschooling around<br/>
her) We see each other often and things are fine as long as we don&#39;t talk<br/>
about homeschooling, religion, poilitics, gay rights, vegetarianism, me<br/>
working from home, or health care options.  (So we talk about knitting, home<br/>
redecorating, and gardening - all safe subjects).  Just yesterday she was at<br/>
my house and Keon (6yo) and I were rolling change.  Mom asked Keon, &quot;So what<br/>
did you do for school today.&quot;  Keon answered (a tad indignantly), &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
*home*schooled now!&quot;  Mom said, &quot;Yes; but what did you do for homeschool.&quot;<br/>
He just rolled his eyes.  So I looked up at her and said, &quot;Ssshhhh, we are<br/>
doing math.&quot;  (and rolled my eyes).  We then separated pennies into pre-1983<br/>
a nd post 1983 all while looking for older pennies (pre-1950 wheat pennies -<br/>
we actually found one).  So I looked at her and said, &quot;History.&quot;  Then Keon<br/>
mentioned that we needed to shine the pennies (we are going on a Disney trip<br/>
soon and we collect pressed pennies)  I asked him how we could shine them<br/>
and he said, &quot;If we put them in catsup or spaghetti sauce they will get<br/>
clean.&quot;  I again looked at Mom and said, &quot;Science.&quot;   She shut up (for now).<br/>
I know we will have many more conversations on how my children will be<br/>
behind their peers (NOT) or missing in social opportunities (oh like<br/>
resource day, gymnastics, scouting, church) and unprepared for life after<br/>
their teen years (sort of like their father who has a professional job and<br/>
is essentially &quot;home-colleged.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  My mother has several friends who are educators or school administrators<br/>
and they all are very nice people (I know them as well).  They keep telling<br/>
my mother about these wonderful programs taht are in their schools.  How my<br/>
children could excel by being enrolled.  How much they would benefit from<br/>
the daily social environment at their particular schools.  My mother buys<br/>
into it.  She doesn&#39;t understand why I refused to submit an application for<br/>
the arts magnate for my two younger children.  She doesn&#39;t understand why I<br/>
think that magnate schools are wrong and that *all* schools should have the<br/>
same opportunities that the &quot;chosen few&quot; are given.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course I don&#39;t live with it on a daily basis.  It does come up often<br/>
enough, though, to make it annoying.  I would probably do about the same I<br/>
am doing now, but then I&#39;m pretty surly when it comes to people pushing at<br/>
my decisions.<br/>

Like that well known layabout Bill Gates  ;)<br/>

When I first went to college after finishing high school, it was to study<br/>
science under pressure to do something academically worthy. I lasted one<br/>
unpleasant year. When I returned to college a number of years later to study<br/>
what I really was passionate about, Theater Design, I could have brought my<br/>
credits across and basically skipped the first year. Then I would have<br/>
missed out on a bunch of fun, and had much worse grades incidentally. The<br/>
feeling and experience was so different on my return to college.<br/>

trusting our kids and ourselves and letting go of the &quot;safety&quot; rules and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130174989">well<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told I am not &quot;really&quot; an unschooler, but here is some input<br/>
for what it is worth. Please note that I am not interested in<br/>
suggestions on how to unschool in a politically correct manner; what<br/>
we do works for us.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear to me who is ill at your house, but I have found that<br/>
the flexibility of unschooling accomodates itself admirably to<br/>
doctor&#39;s appointments, procedures, and hospital stays.<br/>
<br/>
Certain members of the unschooling community seem to feel that college<br/>
is &quot;bad&quot; and this gives me pause; it may not be necessary or ideal for<br/>
every child but you know what? I loved college, personally. So I think<br/>
it is important to allow the child to chose, rather than specifically<br/>
discouraging academic or non-academic pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>
themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings and<br/>
sentence fragments. Fortunately these are a minority of unschooling<br/>
parents, and I tell myself that just as childen survive bab schools<br/>
their children will survive their unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do think that childen, when left to themselves, often<br/>
choose pursuits that would confound the skeptics. I personally do feel<br/>
the need to intervene every so often and assign a specific book that I<br/>
know they can read though it might be a bit hard to start -- Kim by<br/>
Rudyard Kipling was the last one.<br/>
<br/>
Our particular sticking point is math, where they are falling somewhat<br/>
behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>
thing, and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth where<br/>
the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has a<br/>
suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll when<br/>
they are ready) then I might like to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic unschooler,<br/>
but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically correct<br/>
on the various lists that I am not much interested in the labels<br/>
anymore. Some people take unschooling to the point that they think you<br/>
should allow the child to sleep as late as he/she likes and act as<br/>
he/she pleases. I don&#39;t go there. I may be a laissez-faire parent but<br/>
I feel it is my role to be a parent and be authoritative when the<br/>
situation requires it.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your husband&#39;s concern about college; my own difficulties<br/>
along this line are that they tell me that my 14yo is too young and<br/>
they won&#39;t even consider him until he&#39;s 16. Otherwise I&#39;d say he&#39;s as<br/>
ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this frank appraisal of pros and cons as I see them helps you a little. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been told I am not &quot;really&quot; an unschooler, but here is  some input<br/>
for what it is worth. Please note that I am not interested  in<br/>
suggestions on how to unschool in a politically correct manner;  what<br/>
we do works for us.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And since Virginia asked for different people&#39;s experiences and opinions on  <br/>
unschooling, I&#39;ll let it slide for the most part. But as a radical unschooler, <br/>
I  *will* point out that trust is the foundation of unschooling. So not <br/>
trusting  that a child will read and do math isn&#39;t really unschooling. Assigning <br/>
books and  math problems is not showing trust in the philosophy that children <br/>
*will* do  these things when they&#39;re ready. Assuming that your children are <br/>
falling behind  in any &quot;subject&quot; isn&#39;t showing respect of where that child is in <br/>
his life&#39;s  journey.<br/>
 <br/>
But Dana *did* say she wasn&#39;t an unschooler, so....<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Certain members of the unschooling community seem  to feel that college<br/>

it is important to allow the child to chose, rather  than specifically<br/>
discouraging academic or non-academic  pursuits.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think *any* coerced education is bad. And coersion can come in the form  of <br/>
societal expectations. Going to college just because it&#39;s what you&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to do isn&#39;t a goal of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I loved college too. Had a blast. And I didn&#39;t dislike grammar school,  <br/>
middle school, or high school either. Of course, I had no other options. But I  had <br/>
good teachers (overall). I learned a lot. And I had fun. I look back  now and <br/>
think of so much more I *could* have done withOUT school, and it&#39;s  <br/>
staggering. Hindsight being what it is and all. <br/>
 <br/>
I try to balance it out. Most folks think that college is a necessary step  <br/>
for success. It&#39;s important to understand (and not just as unschoolers; <br/>
everyone  should understand this!) that college is not the be-all-end-all. It&#39;s not a <br/>
 guarantee of a happy, successful, joyful life. It&#39;s NOT. It *can* be a great <br/>
 place to spend a few years. It can be a great place to meet interesting <br/>
people.  It can be a great place to discover something new. It can be a great <br/>
place  to learn about life semi-on-your-own   But it&#39;s not the only  place or the <br/>
only way.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Who is this? On this board? On U-D? On A-L? I see much more of that with  the <br/>
crazed curriculum users. They&#39;re *teaching* improper grammar because they  <br/>
don&#39;t know better. The *most* articulate homeschoolers *I* see are the  <br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s amazing, but children WILL choose to pursue different activities and  <br/>
passions when they get to choose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our particular sticking point is math, where they  are falling somewhat<br/>
 </span></blockquote>behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and  calculus is a good<br/>
thing,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Unschoolers appreciate algebra and calculus; we just don&#39;t try to cram it  <br/>
down our children&#39;s throats. We see it in our everyday lives and help point it  <br/>
out or explain it. We also never feel our children are behind  themselves. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth  where<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has  a<br/>
suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll  when<br/>
they are ready) then I might like to hear it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
And teeth brushing is NOT an unschooling issue. (It can be a radical  <br/>
unschooling issue.) But a parent who is willing to force-feed algebra or  Kipling <br/>
should have no problem forcing a toothbrush in a child&#39;s  mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic  unschooler,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically  correct<br/>
on the various lists that I am not much interested in the  labels<br/>
anymore.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Eclectic HOMEschooler. UNschooling is a different critter altogether.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some people take unschooling to the point that they think  you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>should allow the child to sleep as late as he/she likes and act  as<br/>
he/she pleases. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Radical unschoolers. That would be the listowners and the list moderators,  <br/>
for sure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My boys sleep until they are finished sleeping. Why would I purposefully  <br/>
deprive them of sleep by waking them before they are well-rested? <br/>
 <br/>
Act as they please? I just spent an hour (between starting and finishing  <br/>
this post) listening to my eight year old&#39;s crying over the fact that there are  <br/>
murderers in the world. And mean people. And guns. He behaves the absolute <br/>
best  that he can at all times. His best may not be good enough for some people, <br/>
but  he&#39;s kind and considerate and loving and wants to please. And he&#39;ll <br/>
gather more  and more control over himself as he gets older---as we all do. He acts <br/>
as he  pleases.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s important on an unschooling list to give out unschooling  <br/>
advice, but this post was in reference to a request for anti-unschooling  <br/>
opinions----which is what she got. Lying on a float in the kiddie pool  isn&#39;t swimming. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; I won&#39;t let non-unschooling advice/opinions  go unanswered on my list.<br/>

Would I if I had been unschooled? Would I have known sooner? I don&#39;t <br/>
know. I&#39;m so very confused and frustrated and feel like I&#39;m doing no <br/>

SO good! How do you let go of the baggage?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326348251">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I was just about to decide to give up and homeschool after <br/>
talking to a school teacher while getting my car fixed, talking to my <br/>
aunt who had talked to her friend who was a shoolteacher who <br/>
mentioned a homeschooled child who had returned to school and was <br/>
*behind* and she had to *catch* him up (whew!...sorry), and trying to <br/>
give answers to &quot;how&#39;s the homeschooling going&quot; from other friends <br/>
and family members, and trying to integrate my husbands comfort <br/>
level, then I read this thread.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is why I try so hard not to do school or HOME school conversations. I<br/>
have an utterly committed husband and we are both absolutely Rad.<br/>
Unschoolers, but even I get distressed on the rare occasions that I am<br/>
involved in even listening to other people on the subject of how they &quot;have<br/>
to&quot; force their child to do X.<br/>
<br/>
Just last Tuesday a woman was saying that she has a minimum number of<br/>
sentences that she makes her 8 year old write (copy out in a penmanship<br/>
book) every day. She considers 3 sentences to be that number - but the poor<br/>
little girl gets to choose what those sentences are. I couldn&#39;t get away. I<br/>
have actually been losing sleep and crying at home because I wasn&#39;t able to<br/>
say anything to convince her that fighting her dd as she is, is just so<br/>
wrong - partly because all the smart eloquent sentences that I would have<br/>
liked to orate simply didn&#39;t arrive in my brain - still haven&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
All I know is that this mother who is so loving and trusting of her infant,<br/>
seems not to be able to extend that to her older dd&#39;s. She is considering<br/>
the purpose of handwriting to be demonstrating a developmental milestone<br/>
that her daughter is failing to meet - and so basically is telling her dd<br/>
that she is a failure on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
I consider the purpose of writing to be to make a record of my thoughts and<br/>
sometimes to convey those thoughts to others. The thoughts can be as basic<br/>
as a shopping list. If I couldn&#39;t hold a pen as some people can&#39;t maybe I<br/>
could still type or use a recording device of some sort, but I would still<br/>
have ideas. I wanted to ask that other mother if she considers the ideas of<br/>
Stephen Hawking to be valueless because he is unable to write them out for<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
This same mother &quot;tried Unschooling&quot; but since her daughter took that as an<br/>
opportunity to &quot;do nothing&quot; she forgot how to form the letters she had<br/>
&quot;learnt&quot; previously. Another person who thought erroneously that Unschooling<br/>
meant the parent sits back and waits for their child to spontaneously create<br/>
a six subject workday complete with book reports and pages of math problems.<br/>
***Sigh***<br/>
<br/>
This came on top of my very foolishly getting into a &quot;forcing history<br/>
lessons and quizzing is not an Unschooling approach and not what John Holt<br/>
recommended&quot; conversation on my local list. The response has been a lot of<br/>
&quot;let&#39;s all get along&quot; and people quoting definitions of Unschooling from<br/>
sources hostile to Unschooling. A bit like sending someone interested in<br/>
learning about Wicca to Jerry Falwell for a definition.<br/>
<br/>
The point is I have become emotionally in miserable turmoil because I got<br/>
involved in not one but two &quot;how to school&quot; conversations with people who<br/>
are not interested in Unschooling. I should have known better. I *do* know<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I just feel like we are doing nothing <br/>
and my kids will be so far behind, and what if this doesn&#39;t work out <br/>
and we send them back to school, and what if..., and what if... ugh!  <br/>
I have to defend SO many of my positions to people because they <br/>
aren&#39;t the *norm*. Do I really want to add another one? And one on <br/>
such a sensitive subject for my family? College was not an option in <br/>
my family it was just the next step. I come from a family of school <br/>
teachers from way back. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Limit (or eliminate for now) the conversations. They are making you crazy.<br/>
Let your children be the proof of the pudding *in due course* - after all<br/>
you can&#39;t rush a masterpiece and if you keep opening the oven door you spoil<br/>
the baking (mixed yet I think appropriate metaphors).<br/>
<br/>
We can live our lives in fear of catastrophe, and keep looking to an<br/>
imagined disastrous future. Or we can acknowledge that even with the best of<br/>
intentions our children *might* end up in PS because of some external force,<br/>
but in the mean time we can make the present as wonderful as possible. If we<br/>
live in fear we never leave the house and never cross the road. If we live<br/>
in the joyful present we need have no regrets should some horrible<br/>
unforeseen event cloud the future.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds macabre, but I sometimes think what if Jayn came down with some<br/>
disease, or was hurt or killed in an auto accident (the largest cause of<br/>
death and injury for people between the ages of 1 and 18 - more than all<br/>
others combined according to govt. stats). Would I be wishing I had spent<br/>
more time going over the basics of addition and drilling her on the state<br/>
capitals? Or would I be wishing we could cuddle again and I could listen to<br/>
her singing a song of her own devising as she plays with several of her<br/>
little princess castles, as she is at this moment across the room?<br/>

<h4>Robyn Coburn</h4>
<p><small><time>14 Oct 2004, at  3:35am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250914732">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>
themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings and<br/>
sentence fragments. Fortunately these are a minority of unschooling<br/>
parents, and I tell myself that just as childen survive bab schools<br/>
their children will survive their unschooling parents.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What sort of schools did you say? &quot;bab&quot; schools? &quot;Surviving their parents&quot; -<br/>
what an offensive concept to post here.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone makes typos. I usually only mention them when the meaning really is<br/>
unclear, if I am trying to understand. Computerized spell checkers don&#39;t<br/>
work when the word is simply another real word - like &quot;lose&quot; and &quot;loose&quot;.<br/>
Most of us are snatching at our emails between the needs of our children for<br/>
attention, or hurrying late at night to get them done. Many of us write in a<br/>
colloquial style, reminiscent of our verbal communication. Some of us are<br/>
even people for whom English is a second language, or like me come from an<br/>
English speaking country that yet has different spellings. And yes, some of<br/>
us are lousy spellers. BTW the grammar checker on my computer gave me an<br/>
&quot;alert&quot; - green underlining - for some of the prior paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I personally do think that childen, when left to themselves, often<br/>
choose pursuits that would confound the skeptics. I personally do feel<br/>
the need to intervene every so often and assign a specific book that I<br/>
know they can read though it might be a bit hard to start -- Kim by<br/>
Rudyard Kipling was the last one.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one is going to come to your house and force you to fully Unschool.<br/>
However I will never assign a book in the way you mention, because I hope<br/>
that Jayn will enjoy reading, and not find me dividing books into easy<br/>
versus &quot;a bit hard to start&quot;. My opinion on that issue may differ from hers.<br/>
If she does not enjoy reading despite choosing the material for herself, all<br/>
the assigning in the world would not make it more pleasurable for her, or<br/>
make the books themselves more memorable. Jayn&#39;s needs for self<br/>
determination outweigh any residual need to control that I may have.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Our particular sticking point is math, where they are falling somewhat<br/>
behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>
thing, and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth where<br/>
the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has a<br/>
suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll when<br/>
they are ready) then I might like to hear it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to tell people what to reply or not reply to you is a bit of a &quot;red<br/>
rag to a bull&quot;. It is likely to raise the devilish desire to post exactly<br/>
what you are not interested in hearing in some of us. <br/>
<br/>
Nor are you the only person on the list who may be struggling with the same<br/>
issues at any time, so suggestions are really to anyone who can make use of<br/>
them. I find that just when I am about to post a question, someone else will<br/>
post about the same concern.<br/>
<br/>
So guess what - don&#39;t worry about it, they will do it when they are ready -<br/>
unless the adults in their life make &quot;it&quot; (any &quot;it&quot;) into a power struggle<br/>
and a pain - then they will fight doing it even if they would have been<br/>
ready.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic unschooler,<br/>
but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically correct<br/>
on the various lists that I am not much interested in the labels<br/>
anymore. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the purposes of this list is to clarify the definition of Unschooling<br/>
and describe how it works in people&#39;s lives. Labels are important for the<br/>
purposes of the list, even if in practical life you choose to eschew them -<br/>
except I notice when you refer to your kids as &quot;falling somewhat behind&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Some people take unschooling to the point that they think you<br/>
should allow the child to sleep as late as he/she likes and act as<br/>
he/she pleases. I don&#39;t go there. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This list &quot;goes there&quot; cyclically. Check the archives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I may be a laissez-faire parent but<br/>
I feel it is my role to be a parent and be authoritative when the<br/>
situation requires it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s hear about the situations. It could generate some great thought<br/>
provoking discussion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;To answer your husband&#39;s concern about college; my own difficulties<br/>
along this line are that they tell me that my 14yo is too young and<br/>
they won&#39;t even consider him until he&#39;s 16. Otherwise I&#39;d say he&#39;s as<br/>
ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>
all.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can he audit some classes to see if they are fun? At the least it might give<br/>
him a really good idea of which ones he would want to enroll in when the<br/>
time comes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hope this frank appraisal of pros and cons as I see them helps you a<br/>
little.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The only con I got from this is that some parents aren&#39;t good spellers. The<br/>
rest is you not actually fully committing to Unschooling, as you say in your<br/>
first paragraph.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I have to defend SO many of my positions to people because they  <br/>

 <br/>
What&#39;s one more? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It takes a pretty thick skin to get through the first year or so of  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
You will hear a lot of negative comments from well-meaning family members,  <br/>
friends, and even strangers-----and they *are* well-meaning! They really think  <br/>
you are making a grave mistake and are trying to save you a ton of regret and <br/>
 pain. But what do *you* think----in your heart? Do you think that 12 to 14  <br/>
years of school will make a person worthy? That good grades make you more  <br/>
worthy? That learning can only happen when it&#39;s taught? In a classroom? From  <br/>
8:30-3:00? For 180 days a year? <br/>
 <br/>
I thought a lot of that. Brainwashing at its finest! &lt;g&gt; Private  schools, <br/>
good grades, college. <br/>
 <br/>
I spent my junior year of college in Vienna, Austria. I got to see a  <br/>
different world. It changed my views on a lot of things----especially what is  <br/>
important to learn/know---for *me* anyway. And I STILL put my precious baby in  <br/>
school at four years old! The same private school I went to!<br/>
 <br/>
I spent all day sometimes at the school helping out in the classroom or in  <br/>
the parent resource room. Room mom. Volunteer. Chaperone. Field trip planner.  <br/>
Parents&#39; Board. I did it all. I was incredibly involved with the school,  with <br/>
the classroom, and with Cameron&#39;s learning/grades/homework.<br/>
 <br/>
But I watched this child who was filled with wonder for everything, who  <br/>
looked for reasons to ask questions and see answers, who threw himself into  <br/>
projects and imaginative play, who LOVED to LEARN----I watched this sweet boy  <br/>
slowly stop caring and stop learning and -----he had what I read in Stephen  <br/>
King&#39;s book _It_. Those dead lights. Staring eyes with no life in them? That&#39;s  <br/>
what he&#39;d become. A twelve year old with dead lights.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron mentioned to me one night (it was the eve of his birthday  night, in <br/>
fact) that he would like to be homeschooled. I laughed and said  something not <br/>
very nice. Then I started thinking about it. I went to the library  and <br/>
checked out every book on homeschooling. I found John Holt among them and  was <br/>
changed overnight. (Well, I knew what I wanted; I just didn&#39;t know how to  get <br/>
there! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
My mother and my in-laws thought I&#39;d lost my mind. How could a ROOM MOM  turn <br/>
against schools? &lt;g&gt; Oddly, their biggest concerns seemed to be  <br/>
social----and I don&#39;t mean that in the same way most people do. The grandmothers  were <br/>
most worried about football and the prom! LOL<br/>
 <br/>
My father put my mother in her place by saying that all the  homeschooling <br/>
mothers he&#39;d met had been very smart and caring. The kids  seemed better off <br/>
with homeschooling than with school. My dad&#39;s an adolescent  psychiatrist! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron spent the first year getting algebra and history questions from the  <br/>
aunts and uncles (a nurse, a doctor, and a teacher! ugh!). I put a stop to <br/>
that  by asking *them* a few math and history questions (like which high school <br/>
did  Ben Franklin graduate? how many unschoolers did it take to sign a <br/>
Declaration of  Independence? &lt;g&gt;). But I always felt on the defensive--- and I didn&#39;t <br/>
 like it. I decided to change tactics: I asked them----no, I *told* them---to <br/>
lay  off the boys. I don&#39;t drill their children. Don&#39;t drill mine!<br/>
 <br/>
That worked as far as the boys were concerned<br/>
 <br/>
But then *their* kids started noticing how much freedom our children had.  <br/>
That made for some *very* uncomfortable situations. &quot;Why can&#39;t...? How come...?  <br/>
But Cameron can...! Why not?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s kind of like the stages of grief/ You know----denial, anger,  <br/>
bargaining, acceptance? That&#39;s what it seemed like every time we got together!  <br/>
---although there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of the acceptance part! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Being comfortable with your decision is the first step---knowing in your  <br/>
heart that you&#39;re dong the right thing. That unschooling is GOOD for you and  <br/>
your kids. Start writing here---you have a willing audience! Other  newbies <br/>
looking for ways to get over this hump too. The more you do it, the  better you get <br/>
(kind of like learning, huh? &lt;g&gt;). If you can  defend/explain unschooling <br/>
here on this e-list to the &quot;newbi-ers&quot; coming in,  well, that&#39;s a good start in <br/>
helping you to find the words you need IRL. (You  can always delete here until <br/>
you get it right! &lt;G&gt;) I&#39;ve seen a lot of  folks here recently starting to <br/>
paddle out to answer questions! Getting  their feet wet! <br/>
 <br/>
You can just avoid the in-laws and aunts by saying that you&#39;re gong to  try <br/>
this for a year and that, if it doesn&#39;t work out, you can always send  them <br/>
back to school or purchase a curriculum. One year won&#39;t make that much  <br/>
difference. And you can say that every year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
You can tell them to back off, they&#39;re your children, you&#39;ll make the  <br/>
decisions, thank you very much.<br/>
 <br/>
You can smile and say, &quot;Thanks for your opinion; I&#39;ll take it under  <br/>
consideration. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You can hand them a book list (John Holt, Frank Smith, Valerie  Fitzenreiter, <br/>
Mary Griffith) and give them an assignment: &quot;Read these and when  you&#39;re <br/>
done, I&#39;ll administer the test. If you fail, you don&#39;t get to make any  more <br/>
comments on the children&#39;s education.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
A huge smile and a &quot;Unschooling&#39;s GREAT! Wonderful! I can&#39;t believe how  <br/>
happy everyone is! How much we&#39;re learning! God, I wish we&#39;d done this sooner!&quot;  <br/>
can go a long way too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s hard.<br/>
 <br/>
Getting to the paradigm shift takes a lot of thinking and doing. You know  <br/>
it&#39;s the right thing, but you just can&#39;t get to that point where it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;flowing&quot; or whatever. I made the commitment to unschool *months* before  <br/>
actually being able to put it into practice. I understood it, but it just  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t come. Then one day, it just seemed clear----and all this negativity  <br/>
just disappeared. I had been doing what Sandra and Joyce and Anne and Mary and  <br/>
Pam had been telling me to do: play with the children, watch them, do for them, <br/>
 be with them---and it just clicked.<br/>
 <br/>
WHEN it clicks, you&#39;re going to be doing that V-8 hand against the head  <br/>
thing because it&#39;s *so simple*---it&#39;s just hard! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Avoid the peopple who don&#39;t understand---they&#39;re feeding you doubts. As  soon <br/>
as you&#39;re comfortable with what you&#39;re doing, you can go back and explain  <br/>
with better words what it is you&#39;re doing and why. But letting them add stress  <br/>
and raoadblocks to your life will only make it harder to get where you&#39;re  <br/>
going.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, Gawd---I sound like the cult brainwasher! &lt;G&gt; &quot;Cut off all  contact with <br/>
the outside world until you believe as I do!&quot;  Yikes! LOL I  guess that&#39;s how <br/>
school works so well at brainwashing sheeple!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Buit seriously, the more unschoolers you can surround youself with IRL, the  <br/>
easier it will be the emulate them and make the shift.<br/>
 <br/>
Losing the baggage is very, very gradual----until one day, it&#39;s just GONE.  <br/>
But every day, if you can say yes just one extra time or see the learning that  <br/>
happens during a video game or watch the joy in your child&#39;s eyes when he  <br/>
masters something----if you can accept these things as unschooling, then the  <br/>
baggage will get lighter and lighter until it&#39;s gone.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have specific questions, ask away----there may be a newbie out here  <br/>
who wants to tell her story and explain it to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168910039">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>
thing,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why?  I have a Master&#39;s of Science degree from the University of Houston and never took calculus, don&#39;t even know what it is for particularly.  In my life, I am much more likely to need to know the attack points of a particular Yu-Gi-Oh monster than some type of math higher than division.<br/>
<br/>
So of course, calculus is fine and dandy for those interested in it but certainly not necessarily a &quot;good thing&quot; for someone longing to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I think the term eclectic describes what you are doing very well.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  well<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been told I am not &quot;really&quot; an unschooler, but here is some input<br/>
  for what it is worth. Please note that I am not interested in<br/>
  suggestions on how to unschool in a politically correct manner; what<br/>
  we do works for us.<br/>
<br/>
  It is not clear to me who is ill at your house, but I have found that<br/>
  the flexibility of unschooling accomodates itself admirably to<br/>
  doctor&#39;s appointments, procedures, and hospital stays.<br/>
<br/>
  Certain members of the unschooling community seem to feel that college<br/>
  is &quot;bad&quot; and this gives me pause; it may not be necessary or ideal for<br/>
  every child but you know what? I loved college, personally. So I think<br/>
  it is important to allow the child to chose, rather than specifically<br/>
  discouraging academic or non-academic pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
  It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>
  themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings and<br/>
  sentence fragments. Fortunately these are a minority of unschooling<br/>
  parents, and I tell myself that just as childen survive bab schools<br/>
  their children will survive their unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
  I personally do think that childen, when left to themselves, often<br/>
  choose pursuits that would confound the skeptics. I personally do feel<br/>
  the need to intervene every so often and assign a specific book that I<br/>
  know they can read though it might be a bit hard to start -- Kim by<br/>
  Rudyard Kipling was the last one.<br/>
<br/>
  Our particular sticking point is math, where they are falling somewhat<br/>
  behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>
  thing, and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth where<br/>
  the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has a<br/>
  suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll when<br/>
  they are ready) then I might like to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic unschooler,<br/>
  but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically correct<br/>
  on the various lists that I am not much interested in the labels<br/>
  anymore. Some people take unschooling to the point that they think you<br/>
  should allow the child to sleep as late as he/she likes and act as<br/>
  he/she pleases. I don&#39;t go there. I may be a laissez-faire parent but<br/>
  I feel it is my role to be a parent and be authoritative when the<br/>
  situation requires it.<br/>
<br/>
  To answer your husband&#39;s concern about college; my own difficulties<br/>
  along this line are that they tell me that my 14yo is too young and<br/>
  they won&#39;t even consider him until he&#39;s 16. Otherwise I&#39;d say he&#39;s as<br/>
  ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>
  all.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this frank appraisal of pros and cons as I see them helps you a little. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you have written about this.  We&#39;ve just moved this summer <br/>
to a new area (actually my old home town).  Anyway, I&#39;ve been going <br/>
to quite a few different support group meetings in the area.  I want <br/>
to allow myself to get a feel of how each is run.  Since we&#39;ve <br/>
decided to unschool, I&#39;ve found many of the support groups do not <br/>
help me in my endeavor.  I found one right in town that have a <br/>
mixture of homeschooling philosophies, but quite a few unschoolers.  <br/>
I also found myself leaning towards them and really listening when <br/>
they would share.  Recently I found out there is a branch of this <br/>
group which is an unschooling group.  I plan on going to the first <br/>
meeting Monday night and am looking so forward to it.   With all that <br/>
said, I have found that I need to hang with &quot;like-minded&quot; people.  <br/>
Unschooling floats in my soul but does not come out naturally for <br/>
me.  It does with my husband though.  Anytime we talk about what we <br/>
want for the kids, his approach is total natural learning.  Mine is <br/>
school baggage.  Hanging with like-minded people on-line or at groups <br/>
allows me to grow more confident each day with this adventure, just <br/>
as the actual choice to homeschool did in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; unforeseen event cloud the future.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for this too.  One woman share  the other night at a <br/>
meeting about a situation where her friend unschooled her children.  <br/>
She said &quot;I always wondered what they were learning and felt -not <br/>
much because they appeared to be doing nothing all of the time.&quot; The <br/>
friend came upon financial difficulty and had to go back to work <br/>
therefore putting her children in PS.  This woman shared how the kids <br/>
were way behind in their grades and were having an awful time in PS <br/>
(like an I told you so).  She shared she &quot;schools&quot; grade specific <br/>
because if anything happened to her, she&#39;d want her children to be <br/>
ready for PS.  Well that put the fear of God in me.  So off I went <br/>
for the next two days ready to look into Sonlight curriculum, <br/>
figuring this just wasn&#39;t going to work.  Then my kids came down and <br/>
sat with my mother and I to watch the debates.  12 1/2 and almost <br/>
11!  I realized I didn&#39;t ask them to.  They wanted to watch the <br/>
debates!  I thought of my nieces in PS and told myself, I can <br/>
guarantee they are not wanting to see what each candidate believes <br/>
in.  It led into some discussion, etc. etc.  So I&#39;m holding on and <br/>
watching as my kids prove how learning is so natural.  They are <br/>
teaching me!  ;)<br/>
