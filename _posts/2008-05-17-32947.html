<div id="ygrps-yiv-113359269">Like Kelly wrote, I also was introduced to EC too late to put it into  <br/>
effect for my girls.  I also suspect many people on this list are in  <br/>
the same position, and are now trying to deal with their situation at  <br/>
hand (a child/parent couple who are long past the age of having  <br/>
learned the EC signals).<br/>
<br/>
So, once I heard about EC, I couldn&#39;t use it directly but what I did  <br/>
do was use it as a way to re-think potty training in general.   <br/>
Whenever I think about any topic about raising children (or even  <br/>
raising adults - LOL!), I usually think &quot;what would a caveperson  <br/>
do?&quot;.  I think this, because I assume that was supposed to be our  <br/>
natural state - what we were meant to do as a species.<br/>
<br/>
So, when I heard about EC, I thought &quot;this makes perfect sense&quot; - a  <br/>
caveperson wouldn&#39;t have diapers, and they wouldn&#39;t want pee and poop  <br/>
all over the cave, so probably there was a designated spot (or hole  <br/>
in the ground) for pee and poop to go.  Thus, a caveperson would have  <br/>
watched their baby very carefully for the signals that something was  <br/>
about to come out, and then would have held their baby over the  <br/>
designated spot (just what modern ECers do now).  I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t  <br/>
take long for cavepeople figure this all out, especially since there  <br/>
was a long history of this behavior already in place in the culture  <br/>
(I wish we still had this long history for breastfeeding, attachment  <br/>
parenting, learning, etc!).<br/>
<br/>
So, what does a modern-non-cavewoman-too late-for-EC woman do?  I  <br/>
decided that since I had put them into diapers &quot;un-naturally&quot; (as in,  <br/>
against our original caveperson nature), I couldn&#39;t then force them  <br/>
out of them.  This just helped me to relax and let potty training  <br/>
happen on its own.  I&#39;m lucky - both of my girls both decided to use  <br/>
the potty at a very young age (but there was pee and poop all over my  <br/>
modern cave while they were figuring this out!!), so it&#39;s very easy  <br/>
for me to have a &quot;happy ending&quot; to this story.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m not trying to say that it&#39;s easy for those struggling with  <br/>
much older children using the potty.  I know it&#39;s a real challenge  <br/>
for those who have children who are older and not going on the potty,  <br/>
even with a loving attitude toward it.  I only use the caveperson  <br/>
story in the sense that we can say, once again, that our modern  <br/>
society has taken us away from our roots, our instincts, even in an  <br/>
area like toileting.  We can&#39;t blame ourselves, or each other (which  <br/>
I felt the original post-er was doing), for having not seen that.<br/>

sure it was both. They were able to &quot;potty train&quot; fairly young. But<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071234793">I had a friend once mention that the Aka (one of the 4 Pygmy groups) were aware of when their infants needed to pee or poop from a couple of days old. And it was a point of much laughter if a mother or father (Aka dad&#39;s do a greater amount of childcare than do any other population--wow!! just looking for Barry Hewlett&#39;s work on the Aka and paternal care I found his book at google books <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5k2k4l,">http://tinyurl.com/5k2k4l,</a> very cool) missed the moment. I imagine that it is easier when living in the Congo to be naked and visible than it is when living nearer the Arctic circle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879234981">I lived in Thailand for almost three years when I was younger and used to laugh to myself about the way little Thai children would run around with no pants on all day (so cute!)...but functional, too.  ....in the villages there was really no such thing as carpet....if they had anything on the floor, it would have been linoleum.  If inside, the kids could pee at random and it would be wiped up with a towel.  If they had to poo, they were held out the window (which usually didn&#39;t have glass in the villages.)  The only people who I was aware of using diapers were wealthier Thais, but I knew very few of them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218009663">You know, as I was writing my email, part of my brain was thinking - &quot;I wonder if there <br/>
was some sort of natural diapering method in history&quot;.  But, then it just kind of flew out of <br/>
my mind.  Thanks for bringing up the idea that there would have been a natural &quot;resource&quot; <br/>
for absorption of bodily fluids!<br/>

I lived in China for almost 3 years, a little over 10 years ago. I<br/>
remember seeing lots of babies and toddlers with open slits in their<br/>
pants, and their mothers would squat them  over the gutter in the<br/>
street whenever the kid needed to pee.   At the time my friends and I<br/>
used to find it really cute, but didn&#39;t put much thought into it.  But<br/>
when I was pregnant and read about EC, I figured out what they had<br/>
been doing.<br/>

This is pretty much what I did with my babe once he started walking <br/>
when we lived in Hawaii. The entire house had linoleum so very easy <br/>
to clean up messes. It was almost always in the 80s outside so no <br/>
need for warm clothes.<br/>
