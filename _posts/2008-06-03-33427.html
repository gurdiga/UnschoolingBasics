<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303364966">Just a quick note to let you know that I started a new unschooling<br/>
list at a place called &quot;lilaguide&quot;. It&#39;s free to join and I&#39;d love to<br/>
see some of you over there: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lilaguide.com/groups/learninginfreedom.aspx">http://www.lilaguide.com/groups/learninginfreedom.aspx</a><br/>
<br/>
I got an email from them a few weeks ago about starting a group, but<br/>
was too busy to respond. It said there was a small referral fee for<br/>
every person that joins (which I figure might be a good supplement to<br/>
our meager income) but when I started the group it only says that<br/>
lilaguide is free...so I&#39;m not really sure how it all works in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted a message board that went along with my website &quot;Learning in<br/>
Freedom&quot;, so that&#39;s the name of the group.:)<br/>
<br/>
Come on over!!<br/>
