<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954043617">I have mostly been lurking on this board, we are new to unschooling,<br/>
just actually realizing its naturally how we have been living.<br/>
I do have some questions to bring up. I have been reading with<br/>
interest the thread on limits.<br/>
I have a somewhat different view right now. I feel it is our job as<br/>
parents to guide our kids, I wouldn&#39;t let my just turned 7 yr old<br/>
watch adult swim cartoons, because at 7 I don&#39;t think she should watch<br/>
violent humor.  I do agree with Cameron in that things can influence<br/>
some people. We don&#39;t know for sure what will or won&#39;t influence our<br/>
kids. We can hope we have raised them to know right from wrong, and<br/>
what is pretend humor on tv and what is real.<br/>
<br/>
I realize Cameron&#39;s son is older but in a way from reading your posts<br/>
Cameron I would say he is asking you for limits even though he says he<br/>
is not.  It&#39;s just the feeling I get for what its worth.  And if he is<br/>
looking for limits because as someone pointed out he doesn&#39;t trust<br/>
himself that is not a bad thing, it&#39;s just how he feels at this point<br/>
in his life. maybe he will begin to trust himself as the unschooling<br/>
life unfolds.......I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess my question is why is it not truly unschooling if we help<br/>
our kids by setting limits? why is it a bad thing for me to limit my<br/>
young children from watching what i consider violent tv? that i don&#39;t<br/>
want them exposed to someone eating a bloody penis, why is that wrong?</div>

Neither of my boys at seven wanted to either. They were very happy wih <br/>

I agree and will go one step further: I think things influence ALL <br/>
people. Maybe not the same things, but ALL people are influenced by <br/>
things.<br/>

I think humor is humor. What&#39;s funny to one may not be funny to <br/>
another, but I don&#39;t think there is &quot;pretend humor&quot; and &quot;real humor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ANd I don&#39;t think TV has a monopoly on humor (pretend OR real).<br/>

Hypothetical children don&#39;t have reasons for their choices. They just  <br/>
do something because it sounds like it could happen.<br/>

Real children have reasons for their choices and those we can discuss.<br/>

   Well the  hypothetical was based on a real example and i felt the<br/>
question useful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But I have never met a seven year old who wants to watch graphic sex or <br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
Have you?<br/>
<br/>
Most hypotheticals that show up on these lists are *not* based on real <br/>
examples. They are based wholly on fear of what *might* happen.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just not our reality.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s useful are real questions about real kids.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in an earlier email about sex, drugs, and drinking. I have <br/>
*real* experience with all three. And I have passing knowledge of <br/>
Cameron&#39;s friends&#39; relationships with their families and how *they* <br/>
(poorly) handled these things. We can talk about that, if you&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
I can also talk about my 11 year old&#39;s tv habits and how we work *with* <br/>
him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Conventional parenting is basically reactive: responding to  <br/>
children&#39;s actions with the goal of molding the child. The advice is  <br/>
of the form &quot;When child does x, you do y.&quot; With conventional  <br/>
parenting it doesn&#39;t make any difference why the child is reacting in  <br/>
that way. The parent&#39;s job is to stop the behavior. For example, if a  <br/>
7 yo wants to watch an R rated horror movie conventional parenting  <br/>
says no. So hypotheticals can work to explain conventional parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting is proactive. It focuses on the child&#39;s needs and  <br/>
those aren&#39;t present in a hypothetical. If a 7 yo wanted to watch an  <br/>
R rated horror movie there&#39;s a whole world of motivations behind it  <br/>
well beyond &quot;I want to.&quot; The advice would help the parent focus on  <br/>
what the child really wants. Maybe they saw the cover and think it&#39;s  <br/>
about something it isn&#39;t. Maybe a friend saw it and described a funny  <br/>
scene. Maybe it&#39;s because big brother is watching it and he wants to  <br/>
be with his brother. Maybe it&#39;s because he understands what it&#39;s  <br/>
about and really wants to see it -- in which case we&#39;d suggest  <br/>
strategies to help the child see it comfortably and have power over  <br/>
the movie (free to stop at any point, fast forward, watch in the  <br/>
morning and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
None of the above makes sense in a hypothetical. Hypothetical  <br/>
children can be what if&#39;d into situations that fit the solution the  <br/>
parent wants to hear, for instance, &quot;What if the 7 yo just wanted to  <br/>
watch period?&quot; Just because it&#39;s plausible, doesn&#39;t mean there are  <br/>
real children who behave that way.<br/>
<br/>
Real kids don&#39;t &quot;just want to.&quot; There&#39;s a whole family dynamic,  <br/>
personality, history, unmet needs and so forth behind what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what&#39;s confusing you is you&#39;re taking advice tailored to one  <br/>
person&#39;s family and assuming it&#39;s like conventional parenting: if a 5  <br/>
yo wants to watch the news, let them.<br/>
<br/>
Since she had already built the foundation that there was a lot of  <br/>
discussion in her family, that important aspect was there. The child  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be watching without parent support. It was clear either they  <br/>
would be there with him to explain things or he knew he could come to  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting isn&#39;t cookie cutter advice. Parents shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
parking their 5 yos in front of the 6 o&#39;clock news! ;-) But if a  <br/>
child wants to watch the news because they&#39;ve had experience with it  <br/>
and has a relationship of support then his interests should be  <br/>
supported.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041174651">*** I feel it is our job as parents to guide our kids, ***<br/>
<br/>
I do too, and I&#39;ve never read unschooling advice on this list that claimed<br/>
otherwise.   When we write about not controlling or limiting our kids we<br/>
don&#39;t mean we ignore our kids or that we don&#39;t care about what they&#39;re<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
***I wouldn&#39;t let my just turned 7 yr old<br/>
watch adult swim cartoons, because at 7 I don&#39;t think she should watch<br/>
violent humor.***<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little he liked monster movies and science fiction/ horror<br/>
movies from the fifties and sixties.  There&#39;s no gore, really, in those old<br/>
movies.  But he liked all kinds of science fiction and horror so he<br/>
gradually saw newer movies.  I watched with him and I knew what was going on<br/>
with him by the way he&#39;d talk to the TV and get down and act out scenes.  I<br/>
would sometimes elaborate on a scene, &quot;That guy is so mean!&quot;  And Dylan<br/>
would talk about why characters made the choices they made.   He wasn&#39;t<br/>
alone when he watched.  I understood what *he* could handle.    It&#39;s<br/>
sometimes hard for parents to separate what they think their kids can handle<br/>
from what the kid really can handle.  That comes from our natural instinct<br/>
to protect them, and it&#39;s good we have that instinct, but we also owe it to<br/>
our kids to let them grow in their own way.  They&#39;re timetable shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
set by us.  They&#39;re born perfectly suited to being individuals. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I thought there was a scene in a movie that might disturb Dylan I&#39;d just<br/>
tell him what I thought.   He (in every case, if I remember right) decided<br/>
to watch the movie anyway.   I remember at the end of one of the Godzilla<br/>
movies, (The one where he&#39;s melting in the volcano) Dylan turned the TV off<br/>
and said &quot;I&#39;m never watching THAT again.&quot;   When we talked about it he said<br/>
he felt sad for Godzilla and they shouldn&#39;t have ended the movie that way.<br/>
We made up different endings.   At first they were all about Godzilla<br/>
stomping the guys who tricked him into the volcano but our made up endings<br/>
gradually got sillier.  After some days he decided to watch the movie again <br/>
and we talked about the special<br/>
effects of Godzilla melting.   He now fondly recalls his viewing of that<br/>
movie, all these years later.  We still love to watch those old Godzilla<br/>
movies together. &lt;g&gt;  We throw popcorn at the bad guys (and the monsters are<br/>
never the bad guys&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
***I do agree with Cameron in that things can influence<br/>
some people.  We don&#39;t know for sure what will or won&#39;t influence our<br/>
kids. ***<br/>
<br/>
Humans are being influenced all the time by everything around them.  People<br/>
were being influenced before TV was ever invented.&lt;g&gt;  Our kids will be<br/>
influenced by family members, neighbors, friends, smells, tastes, textures,<br/>
temperatures, grass, music, bees, water, dreams, cars, sculptures,<br/>
mountains, paintings, dirt...   We can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t try to be the only<br/>
influence on our kids.   All people are not the same,  all of us evolve as<br/>
we grow and all of our growth and evolution comes from our experience and<br/>
environment.  The more we experience (safely, with the help of people who<br/>
love us) the more intelligent and capable we become.  That&#39;s how it should<br/>
be.   Our kids are not destined to become some fresher version of ourselves.<br/>
They are themselves and we need to let them be themselves.  That brain is<br/>
not ours. &lt;g&gt; (dang it anyway, I could use a fresh brain.  HEY, that may be <br/>
why I love zombie movies!)<br/>
<br/>
***We can hope we have raised them to know right from wrong, and<br/>
what is pretend humor on tv and what is real.***<br/>
<br/>
It can be more than a hope.  What&#39;s that quote?  &quot;If you can&#39;t be a good<br/>
example then you&#39;ll just have to be a horrible warning.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We can model goodness, kindness, honesty.  We can model thoughtful decision<br/>
making and respect for others.  We can and will influence our kids.  We<br/>
can&#39;t help but influence our kids!  We just can&#39;t expect to be the *only*<br/>
influence.  That wouldn&#39;t be good or natural or healthy.   But we are the <br/>
steady influence.  We are the continuous feed<br/>
from birth and there&#39;s a lot of power in that.  We need to be more dedicated<br/>
to being a helpful guide for our child&#39;s individual journey than we are<br/>
dedicated to trying to make them just like us.<br/>
<br/>
***I realize Cameron&#39;s son is older but in a way from reading your posts<br/>
Cameron I would say he is asking you for limits even though he says he<br/>
is not. It&#39;s just the feeling I get for what its worth. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a mistake to let the voice of our unfounded fears overpower the<br/>
voice of our children.<br/>
<br/>
***...if he is looking for limits because as someone pointed out he doesn&#39;t<br/>
trust<br/>
himself that is not a bad thing, it&#39;s just how he feels at this point<br/>
in his life. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a bad thing.  We all have doubts and rely on others for help<br/>
or reassurance from time to time.  But a healthy survival depends on our<br/>
being able to make good decisions.  If we can&#39;t trust ourselves we can&#39;t<br/>
make good decisions.    Kids who don&#39;t have confidence in themselves are<br/>
much more likely to be at risk of deception by others.   It&#39;s not just a bad<br/>
thing, it&#39;s dangerous.   If a child of thirteen is always depending on<br/>
adults to make up his mind he&#39;s at risk.   Not all adults will have his best<br/>
interest at heart.   We only become capable and confident when we know and<br/>
trust ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
 ***maybe he will begin to trust himself as the unschooling<br/>
life unfolds.......I don&#39;t know.***<br/>
<br/>
I do know.  People don&#39;t learn to trust themselves until and unless they<br/>
have a lot of experience making their own decisions.   Kids will make poor<br/>
choices.  We all do.  But making some questionable choices doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
should be able to or can&#39;t continue to make choices.  And parents need to be<br/>
aware of the difference between a poor choice and a choice the parent just<br/>
doesn&#39;t agree with.  One is not necessarily the other. &lt;g&gt;  As difficult as<br/>
it has been for me to accept, I am not always right. &lt;bwg&gt;  We can help our<br/>
kids.  We can ask questions.  We can express our concerns and even say &quot;I<br/>
think that&#39;s a bad idea and here&#39;s why.&quot;  But that doesn&#39;t mean our kids<br/>
have to agree with us, and it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re right.   Our kids<br/>
definitely need our thoughtful guidance.   They also really need to make<br/>
their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work in a home where kids aren&#39;t trusted.  It just won&#39;t<br/>
happen.   Learning takes exploration and in order to explore a person needs<br/>
to be free.  Unschooling parents need to be brave and let their kids be<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
***my question is why is it not truly unschooling if we help<br/>
our kids by setting limits? ***<br/>
<br/>
Controlling other people is counter productive.  First, it&#39;s hard.  It<br/>
almost never works the way we wish it would.  Once you set a limit how do<br/>
you enforce it?  You either have to trust the kid won&#39;t exceed the limit or<br/>
you have to set in place some other kinds of limits to ensure the first one<br/>
is maintained.  If you could trust him, why the limit?   It&#39;s complicated.<br/>
And control is an illusion.  We might stop our kids from doing something<br/>
when we&#39;re around but what about when we&#39;re not around?  What about when<br/>
we&#39;re asleep?  When they go to a friend&#39;s house?  When we go to the store<br/>
and they stay home?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling only works when people are free to explore.  That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&quot;left to their own devices&quot; as talk show hosts are fond of saying.&lt;g&gt;  Our<br/>
kids shouldn&#39;t be ignored or neglected or scooted out the door with a broom<br/>
so we can clean house.    We should be involved in their life in fun and <br/>
helpful ways as much as they want us.<br/>
<br/>
Limits are things people talk about a lot but don&#39;t think about too much.<br/>
We hear from our parents about our limits and when we&#39;re grown we hear about<br/>
how kids need limits and when our own kids come along we&#39;re fairly itching<br/>
to set some limits because that&#39;s what parents do.  We start our life with<br/>
our children believing they&#39;re always on the verge of doing something<br/>
they&#39;re not supposed to do so we are ever on the look out for ways to stop<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling parents don&#39;t think of limits as things that &quot;help&quot;<br/>
children.  Unschoolers think *help* helps a child. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Unschooling parents believe their kids are doing exactly what they&#39;re<br/>
supposed to do.  Exploring the world where they will spend their whole<br/>
lives.  Instead of looking for reasons they should be limited in their<br/>
explorations we look for ways to help them explore safely and happily.<br/>
We&#39;re not standing in their way.  We&#39;re not the roadblock between our kid<br/>
and where our kid wants to go.  We&#39;re the tour guide, helping him go just as<br/>
far as *he* wants.  Its a big world.  We&#39;re not going to be the biggest part<br/>
of our kid&#39;s lives for very long.  The very best thing we can do for them is<br/>
to help them come to know their world and be confident in it.  We can&#39;t do<br/>
that by setting up unnatural boundaries.<br/>

older movies *because* they use so much psychological tension. One <br/>
of my all-time favorite movies is *Forbidden Planet*. There is <br/>
absolutely no on-screen violence, but it terrified Mo and we had to <br/>
turn it off pretty quickly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733714227">And too their levels of interest in things/ability to handle things <br/>
changes over time - last year, DS (almost 9) didn&#39;t even want us to <br/>
watch the Harry Potter movies in another room - just hearing some of <br/>
the music and all was too much. Recently, however, he&#39;s decided he <br/>
really LIKES the movies and I&#39;m thinking of checking out the <br/>
audiotapes from the library for a car trip this summer. He&#39;s also <br/>
seen pretty much all the James Bond movies (gotta love those <br/>
marathon weeks/weekends on TMC and TNT and all like that). He&#39;s <br/>
decided he likes the classic Bond (Sean Connery, who BTW, got better <br/>
looking as he aged IMO) and the Pierce Brosnan ones but not the <br/>
other guys (not even the most recent Casino Royale which we watched <br/>
on DVD - that was a fun connection: the new Casino Royale, the old <br/>
Casino Royale spoof made in the 60s, and the Get Smart Again movie <br/>
which spoofs the old Get Smart series as well as all the spy movie <br/>
genre). Until about 6 months ago I don&#39;t think he even noticed there <br/>
were females in the movies, except insofar as they helped or <br/>
hindered 007. Their suggestive names mean nothing to him. About 6 <br/>
months or so ago, he asked why James Bond was always kissing all the <br/>
ladies. That&#39;s pretty mild a question for what is seen and implied. <br/>
I just told him it was part of that character that he does that but <br/>
it&#39;s not typical of most people (my question is given the type of <br/>
physical damage he takes in several of the movies, how does <br/>
he &quot;manage&quot; with all those ladies?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, all this to say that I think sometimes we place our own <br/>
adult views of the situation onto our kids and think they will see <br/>
what we see when often enough they don&#39;t - DS still thinks Pussy <br/>
Galore and Plenty O&#39;Toole are just silly movie character names, it&#39;s <br/>
just us adults who have that added layer of double entendre on them.<br/>
