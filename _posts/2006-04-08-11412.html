<div id="ygrps-yiv-875987910">&quot;They just had an online conference about<br/>
Social Relationships and Friendships for gifted kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the best way for unschooling to unfold. How about<br/>
just seeing each child for their own brand of uniqueness rather than<br/>
ANY label...gifted or otherwise?<br/>
Unschooling is all about seeing the gifts and beauty each child<br/>
possesses, without labels or classification of their knowledge.<br/>
