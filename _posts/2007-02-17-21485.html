<div id="ygrps-yiv-821743342">Hi! I am new here.I have always wanted to unschool my kids.I love <br/>
spending time with them and being together and we have always <br/>
homeschooled(curriculum).I have always been afraid to just let go and <br/>
do it.I have a child who will be high school age next year and 5 other <br/>
kids(6 kids total).I left school in high school.I dont know if I <br/>
myself have the smarts to be able to help the older kids-I know almost <br/>
no math and am terrible in english.I am not good at explaining things <br/>
really.I am scared that I would be harming them or hurting their <br/>
chance to go to college or the military or anything.I mean how is my 5 <br/>
year old going to learn numbers letters and things? I guess I just <br/>
dont get it-maybe someone could help me understand.Thanks so much!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288714568">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I think most of us (even myself) have those worries. But you know<br/>
what? You wrote this email, didn&#39;t you? That means your English is<br/>
fine--I had no problems understanding what you wrote and that&#39;s the<br/>
essential of language--communication (and not three college-level<br/>
courses on Shakespeare).<br/>
<br/>
As for math, have you have had to use trigonometry and such outside of<br/>
school? Most of it doesn&#39;t apply to real life and so I wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
much. Your child will naturally want to learn (either now or later)<br/>
the essentials of math that are useful in life. As for you, once<br/>
again, don&#39;t worry. You can learn right along with him! What&#39;s the<br/>
problem if you both sit down with a mathbook (or whatever) together?<br/>
There&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t both tackle a subject together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve helped performed surgery and done literally throusands of vitals<br/>
and eye tests, yet never set foot in medical school. How? it all has<br/>
to do with life&#39;s circumstances. A piece of paper does not define your<br/>
experience and abilities...experience and abilities within themselves<br/>
describe what you know.<br/>
<br/>
