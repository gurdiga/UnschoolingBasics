 How long has unschooling, as we know it, been around? Are there any<br/>
adults that were unschooled as children?  I would like to know their<br/>
pov. My mom wants to know theses things and I wouldn&#39;t mind finding out<br/>

Of course, the vast MAJORITY of people were unschooled until the turn <br/>
of the 20th century! So your mom&#39;s grandparents and all their friends <br/>
were more than likely unschooled. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
John Holt started promoting &quot;no school&quot; about 1975-76. Before that he <br/>
was a school reformer. So the *young* children of the parents he was <br/>
reaching &quot;became adults&quot; in the late 1990s. The second &quot;wave&quot; is just <br/>
reaching adulthood now.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 20 and, although not fully on board with unschooling when we <br/>
started, is a HUGE advocate now. He knows he can do anything. <br/>
Plus---he&#39;s seen his schooled friends struggling so.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you may have: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574370690">Unschooling has been around *forever*, it&#39;s schooling that hasn&#39;t!  There&#39;s actually much more evidence throughout history that supports unschooling!  Take a look sometime at the list of people that have not attended school that have changed the world as we know it.  It helped me to learn that school was set up for a much different reason than it&#39;s used today, and it hasn&#39;t been around all that long.  Long enough to do lots of damage to lots of kids, but not long from a historical perspective anyway.  I know that isn&#39;t your particular question, just my two cents :o).<br/>
