 </span></blockquote>&quot;Gifted&quot; indeed is an odd label - gifted at what? Following school <br/>
instructional format? Leaves out those gifted at interpersonal <br/>
relationships (people who read people), gifted at sports, at art, at <br/>
baking, at knitting, at all those bajillions of other things that <br/>
exist in the world.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012064623">I think it is offensive when people who are ignorant of what the &quot;label&quot;<br/>
actually means to people and their families make a blanket statement such as<br/>
that. You could also tell a parent who has a child with dyslexia that her<br/>
problems don&#39;t really exist, but that wouldn&#39;t be very nice. My daughter,<br/>
who has several learning delays, knows she is different without being told.<br/>
Gifted children are not just &quot;smart&quot;. There is a whole lot of emotional and<br/>
social issues which make them different. They process information about the<br/>
world around them differently. Their emotions are magnified by 10. A gifted<br/>
child knows they are different without having to be told.  My son would tell<br/>
you it&#39;s not a gift, it&#39;s a curse. He wishes he was like everyone else. He<br/>
has many friends but still feels isolated and lonely because he has trouble<br/>
relating and does not enjoy many of the things they do, although he<br/>
disguises it well. He recognizes new information, he does not learn it. A<br/>
gifted child does not have to &quot;apply&quot; himself. Gifted children function<br/>
differently. They perceive things differently. It can be very damaging to a<br/>
child when a parent does not understand. I know I did my share of damage<br/>
before I understood what was really going on. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the term gifted at all. I agree with you that all children have<br/>
gifts. I prefer asymmetric learners myself. It more describes what it truly<br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
There many good websites that can give more information and can tell you<br/>
what the term means so that maybe you could better understand. <br/>

What is gifted, really?  I guess I feel that those are the labels and <br/>
