<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364681217">How did your kids learn to read and when?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
~Melissa :)<br/>
<br/>
DS at about 4 and DD at about 6.<br/>
<br/>
DS was, I think, born reading. :)<br/>
<br/>
DD got ticked off and declared that everyone in the house but her could read and she demanded to know how, immediately. :)<br/>
<br/>
We went on line and selected a &quot;how to&quot; book together -- the 100 easy lessons book -- she already knew the first 1/3 of it, did the middle 1/3 and has been reading ever since.<br/>
<br/>
She is the one wearing out her library card, btw. DS hasn&#39;t cracked a book in I don&#39;t know how long. He&#39;s an online creature. :)<br/>
<br/>
As is DD.<br/>
<br/>
I was just noticing how comfortable both of them are on line. Just agile in a way I never will be. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, none of this has anything to do with your kids. Go with the flow and their desires. It will all click when they are ready. <br/>
