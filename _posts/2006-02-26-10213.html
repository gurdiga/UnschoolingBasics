<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032187795">You&#39;re right they most likely would do the all day thing for a time...<br/>
anyone given total freedom after being held to rules will take it to excess<br/>

Now, benefits... <br/>
1. to learn (my daughter watches a lot of Animal Planet and HGTV... she<br/>
loves animals and the HGTV has sparked an interest in home decorating which<br/>
she has begun to do in her own room)  <br/>
2.  to relax (for a lot of people, watching TV is something they enjoy and<br/>
is something they do to relax after a long day)  <br/>
3.  to live an interest when there is no other way (I LOVE forensic science<br/>
shows, like Cold Case Files or Forensic Files... it&#39;s my way of living my<br/>
interest since I&#39;m not a detective, coroner, or a forensic pathologist)<br/>

How to get your 10 yr old to lose weight.  Making it a non issue!  Making<br/>
exercise fun and doing it just for fun... not exercise.  The whole family<br/>
needs to get out and get active.  Why is this Dr&#39;s orders?  Also, make sure<br/>
that the family also changes their diet.  Limit the junk food and have<br/>
healthy choices abound.  She&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10.  She&#39;ll carry food<br/>
issues for the rest of her life if it&#39;s not dropped now.  Your dd is only<br/>
one part of a whole family... so the family is going to make changes.<br/>

 <br/>
Hi, I&#39;m new and have a lot of the same concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading one of John Holt&#39;s books and have a few more <br/>
waiting for me. Plus Summerhill. So I have a while until I fully <br/>
understand &quot;unschooling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I let my children have 30 mins of TV a day and 30 mins <br/>
computer a day per child. (30mins TV total and 30 mins per child.)<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to let them go and give them total freedom to do as <br/>
they please, but I know it would be TV all day for one and Computer <br/>
all day for the other and the babies would go between the two all <br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
I know that pure unschooling would be to allow my child access to TV <br/>
and computer all day long. BUT, for my sanity could anyone come up <br/>
with any benefits of watching TV? <br/>
<br/>
Also, any unschooling tips on how to get my 10 yo to loose weight <br/>
without being too controlling about it? Doctors orders and she&#39;s <br/>
only gained weight, even though she has tried to loose. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
