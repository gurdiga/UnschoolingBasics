<div id="ygrps-yiv-11680199">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Therese, gentle Christian mama to my two girls, ages 2 and <br/>
4.  I used to teach 2nd grade and then 1st grade for a few years before <br/>
my girls were born.  I knew after my experiences teaching that <br/>
homeschooling would be ideal, and I don&#39;t really know if I could ever <br/>
go back to &#39;teaching&#39; in the way the schools would have me teach. Scary <br/>
scary.  <br/>
Anyhow, I have done lots and lots of reading, and I agree with <br/>
unschooling and can see how it will benefit my children.  As a <br/>
Christian, I fully believe that God made them with their own unique <br/>
gifts that can be realized when given the freedom to explore them.  The <br/>
bible teaches we are free through Christ, and I fully want them to <br/>
experience what God has in store for them.  I didn&#39;t want to get into a <br/>
religious discussion, but just wanted to let you know where I come from <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
My husband however has some major issues about the term &#39;unschooling&#39;, <br/>
but I&#39;m working on him.  He doesn&#39;t want us to ever label ourselves <br/>
as &#39;unschoolers&#39;.  (Well he doesn&#39;t want me to label myself as VEGAN <br/>
either, but thats what I am LOL) mostly because of flack from our <br/>
families- who are just coming to terms with our homeschooling as it is, <br/>
as well as our AP parenting philosophy (not sending kids to sunday <br/>
school, etc) and allowing our children to sleep next to us, etc.  He <br/>
agreed with me that grades and testing are useless tools made for the <br/>
masses, not our children, (yay!) and he doesn&#39;t think a boxed <br/>
curriculum would be beneficial when there is so much to learn in <br/>
everyday life. <br/>
<br/>
But he still wants our children to be &#39;disciplined&#39; as far as behavior <br/>
goes, and wants me to set up a predictable schedule for the girls and <br/>
myself.  I don&#39;t think that a routine would be bad at all, but there is <br/>
no way I can be very regimented... I am thinking of printing <br/>
a &#39;schedule&#39; and put that on the fridge to pacify him. LOL  <br/>
He also wants to make sure she &#39;knows&#39; things that the schools are <br/>
teaching- and he thinks that some things have to be learned whether <br/>
they like it or not...  not sure how to respond to that.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, our 4 year old is very much in her own fantasy world- which I am <br/>
reminding him is a good thing- but he worries about her because every <br/>
moment he is home, she is running on all fours as a &#39;pony&#39; or &#39;puppy&#39; <br/>
or &#39;rat&#39; (thanks to ratatoulle) and she even does this in public and he <br/>
gets embarassed. She also has to sing or shout or ramble on and on <br/>
CONSTANTLY and he worries that there is something wrong with that.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
So- when you are home and able to read SO much more than your husband- <br/>
how do you deal with him on the issues?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Therese in CA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054060689"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So- when you are home and able to read SO much more than your husband-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how do you deal with him on the issues?<br/>
Gently. Extend the same respect and understanding to him that you do to<br/>
the kids. The presumption that he&#39;s doing the best he can with what he<br/>
knows the same way you presume the kids are doing the best they can in a<br/>
given situation with the tools they have at hand. You model behaviors,<br/>
discuss things non-judgmentally, etc. If he&#39;s willing to read stuff, get<br/>
short bits of articles, posts, etc that he can read quickly (bathroom<br/>
reading LOL). Something like Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child is good<br/>
because it&#39;s set up in short Q&A style bits. <br/>
<br/>
For many years, we didn&#39;t use the term &#39;unschooling&#39; with family<br/>
members. Over time, we made homeschooling and unschooling<br/>
interchangeable in our mentions of it. Now we just use unschooling. BUT<br/>
they&#39;ve also had time to see that whatever it is we&#39;re doing is really<br/>
great for DS (he&#39;s 10 now, we began unschooling when he was born, he&#39;s<br/>
never been schooled institutionally or at home).<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;disciplined&quot;, y&#39;all might want to consider what that term<br/>
actually means. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;punished&quot;. A disciple is one who<br/>
follows another or who is brought alongside one for training or<br/>
instruction. Jesus didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; the apostles and other followers when<br/>
they just didn&#39;t get it (or did really stupid stuff). He spent more time<br/>
instructing them. *HE* went to &quot;time out&quot; of sorts when he needed it -<br/>
going away alone to pray when things got overwhelming - rather than<br/>
sending them away to &#39;think about what they did&#39;. KWIM? <br/>
<br/>
I might want to make some private time sans little ears to sit down in a<br/>
relaxed and calm manner and find out what it is he exactly thinks &quot;has<br/>
to be learned&quot; and why. No rebuttal, just listen to him. Ask questions<br/>
for clarification as needed. Ask Why? A lot. Use the time honored<br/>
rabbinic tradition of answering questions with questions if he flips the<br/>
questions around on you.<br/>
<br/>
Your household *already* has a routine of some form - it just might not<br/>
LOOK like the kind of thing he grew up with. Life itself has patterns<br/>
and rhythms - that&#39;s the way it was *created* it be. <br/>
<br/>
You might also want to find ways to communicate with him about what<br/>
happens when he&#39;s NOT there. What does she do for the &quot;rest&quot; of the time<br/>
if all he sees is when she&#39;s being a pony or a puppy or a rodent? He has<br/>
no idea. Some people set up private password protected blogs so they can<br/>
post pictures and text for family to see and that is sometimes helpful.<br/>
We&#39;ve got cell phones with camera ability and multimedia/texting<br/>
capabilities so that when DH (the at home parent) and DS (10) are doing<br/>
fun stuff, they can send me pictures to my cell phone or to my email<br/>
here at work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112086634">Hi there--<br/>
first off, I just wanted to say I really liked Deb&#39;s response--so well<br/>
put! I really agree with all that was said.<br/>
<br/>
And then I just wanted to say, I don&#39;t use the term unschooling with<br/>
my extended family (I come from a long line of educators). And I don&#39;t<br/>
discuss the philosophy of unschooling with anyone who isn&#39;t doing it<br/>
themselves. I&#39;ll talk about what adventures we&#39;re having or what my<br/>
son is involved in right now. That&#39;s the stuff they can relate to. And<br/>
they like hearing about our lives. At times I&#39;ve gotten self conscious<br/>
in some situations where I&#39;m clearly doing my parenting differently<br/>
then how I was raised, but..oh well. I had to get over that.  <br/>
<br/>
I had to not use the term unschooling with my partner, too. He didn&#39;t<br/>
want the label. And that&#39;s ok. When we do talk about various family<br/>
stuff--respect for each other, guidance (discipline), what we want our<br/>
lives to be like with our boy, I still don&#39;t use the word unschooling<br/>
because I&#39;m not trying to fit into a philosophy or label our family;<br/>
I&#39;m simply trying to be happy and have a happy family.<br/>
just my $.02<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, gotta run.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely agree with this.  In fact, I have learned a lot about<br/>
Jesus&#39;s discipleship approach from the ladies on<br/>
www.gentlechristianmothers.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com</a>&gt; <br/>
- and GBD (Graced-Based Discipline &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aolff.com/">http://aolff.com/</a>&gt;  ) where<br/>
discipline is as you described, a relationship, not one &#39;Lording over&#39;<br/>
the other.  Jesus led by example, with love and ofcourse, GRACE!  He<br/>
taught through relationships- and wants us to be in relationship with<br/>
Him.  He doesn&#39;t punish... He has already taken the punishment for all<br/>
our sins, so why would we punish our children?....<br/>
<br/>
I could go on... but what I meant when I said that my husband wants our<br/>
children to be &#39;disciplined&#39; is really that he wants them to be quiet<br/>
and not screaming while running around like animals when we are at other<br/>
people&#39;s houses. LOL.  I try to tell him that her imagination is a good<br/>
thing and that they are still small, but he still can&#39;t shake the idea<br/>
that when he askes our 4 year old to do something, he expects her to do<br/>
it, instead of just laughing in his face.  In the mean time, I am<br/>
learning new tools in parenting, and i try to show him things here and<br/>
there.  But he gets frustrated.  He agrees with GBD and gentle parenting<br/>
- thankfully!  And he would never spank her or anything like that. <br/>
Although he has used &#39;time out&#39; unsuccessfully before.  He just throws<br/>
his hands up and looks to me as to what to do, and I usually sit with<br/>
dd1 and talk to her quietly and get her interested in something else...<br/>
sometimes that works.<br/>

But so far it hasn&#39;t materialized too much- i need to remember to take<br/>
more pictures of what we do during the day.  This was actually HIS idea,<br/>
since he felt I may need some accountablility since I talked him out of<br/>
doing a charter and an ISP.<br/>
<br/>
I think he will come around.. I just need to be gentle and give him time<br/>
like you said.  Thank you this has been very helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128307617">This is how my DH feels- he doesn&#39;t want us to label ourselves or our<br/>
children, or try to fit into any sort of label.   I however, like being<br/>
&#39;a part&#39; of something bigger and like knowing there is a name for how<br/>
other people parent or homeschool.  But I am realizing now that not<br/>
using the term may just be a way that I respect his wishes, while he<br/>
respects my wishes to not institutionalize or test our children.<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, I probably don&#39;t fit into a radical unschooling label<br/>
much...<br/>
<br/>
I have written a blog about Christian unschooling and I would be<br/>
interested to hear others reactions to it.... but please be gentle as I<br/>
am still new to learning about all of this!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a reason to. I&#39;ve always described what we do as &quot;just  <br/>
following her interests&quot;. And allow people to believe what they will  <br/>
with that. One of the benefits of magnet schools was to allow  <br/>
children to follow their interests. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But he still wants our children to be &#39;disciplined&#39; as far as behavior<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What he needs is an unschooling conference so he can see what happens  <br/>
with kids who have freedom with the partnership of a parent :-)<br/>
<br/>
We can often train children through various forms of punishment to  <br/>
*act* right -- eg, &quot;be disciplined&quot; -- but it&#39;s all on the surface.  <br/>
The more we train them to behave as we want, the better they get at  <br/>
hiding who they are and the less we know what&#39;s going on inside.  <br/>
Haven&#39;t we all met kids who are sweet around adults and terrors when  <br/>
adults aren&#39;t around? Ask him if he knows kids like that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a guarantee that sweet on the outside hides nasty on the  <br/>
inside, but the big point is that if kids can&#39;t trust that they can  <br/>
be themselves around us, *we can&#39;t know*.  If kids continue to be who  <br/>
they are around us we can be there to help them find safe and  <br/>
socially acceptable ways to get what they&#39;re trying to get.<br/>
<br/>
I think too often, like with school, parents see the successes and  <br/>
assume school is the cause and see the failures and assume the child  <br/>
or family is at fault. But is that true? Of course most people can&#39;t  <br/>
even know! For them there is no control group. Unschoolers can see  <br/>
that their kids become successes even without school so we *know*  <br/>
school isn&#39;t the factor.<br/>
<br/>
Just the same with strict parenting. Most parents are aware of strict  <br/>
parenting and permissive parenting but nothing in between. At least  <br/>
with strict parenting, kids have some input and role modeling on what  <br/>
they should do, so some do come out right. Permissively parented kids  <br/>
often lack engagement with their parents so they&#39;re raising themselves.<br/>
<br/>
MIndful parenting avoids the pitfalls of both. It has both the  <br/>
engagement and the role modeling without the neglect and without the  <br/>
control that can make kids fight against what we want for them. At 16  <br/>
my daughter is kind and thoughtful and actually enjoys spending time  <br/>
with me. Can most parents of 16 yos say that?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he&#39;s afraid. It also sounds like he&#39;s worried what  <br/>
others will think. Those are real concerns to him and should be  <br/>
treated with the respect you&#39;d give your kids&#39; worries and concerns!  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s right, but it does mean it feels real to him and  <br/>
if you treat his worries as silly he&#39;s not going to feel listened to.<br/>

<br/>
Lots of people have said how accurate the series is for behavior for  <br/>
each age. (Though apparently my daughter didn&#39;t read the books! Or  <br/>
maybe she did and was determined not to fit into the mold ;-) The  <br/>
parenting advice at the back is very conventional so not much use but  <br/>
the rest might assure him what can be expected. Though my daughter  <br/>
continued doing a lot of fantasy play well beyond the age when most  <br/>
kids had stopped (early teens I think.) Fortunately she had a friend  <br/>
who enjoyed it too :-) And now most of her fantasy play goes into  <br/>
writing comics and stories.<br/>
<br/>

know you were joking with a pretend schedule but it could be  <br/>
tempting. At the moment he&#39;s working on trust and if he finds you&#39;re  <br/>
fudging to get around his worries that&#39;s going to be a huge set back.<br/>

<br/>
Well, since you asked...<br/>
I want you to know that we DO advocate radical unschooling here at<br/>
this list. I hope you&#39;ll stay and ask enough questions to get a true<br/>
understanding of what it means because it seems you have some<br/>
misconceptions about what unlimited tv/video games and other ideas<br/>
look like.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly NOT &quot;leave them to themselves&quot; at all. Though many<br/>
misunderstand this. RU and mindful parenting is one of the most<br/>
connected and respectful ways to be with children.<br/>
<br/>
Also, seeing children as &quot;sinful&quot; and &quot;needing correction&quot; can<br/>
actually hinder the parents ability to truly be present and find<br/>
solutions outside of the punishment/reward paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; or &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by<br/>
Alfie Kohn? Good reads. The idea at this list, is that children (and<br/>
most all humans) are trying to do their best in every situation.<br/>
Sometimes we need better tools, or better information but even when a<br/>
child seems to behave poorly, it is simply that they have no other<br/>
tools available to them at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
We can give you ideas for moving closer to trust, closer to respect<br/>
and joy. The list exists to help people with that and how to trust ALL<br/>
of your child&#39;s learning whether it&#39;s about chores or tv or food or<br/>
anything else that involves this human learning journey. Because<br/>
learning is learning. Reading isn&#39;t different from chores, food isn&#39;t<br/>
different from math. It&#39;s all just part of life and the learning<br/>
experiences therein.<br/>

This is how my DH feels- he doesn&#39;t want us to label ourselves or our<br/>
children, or try to fit into any sort of label. I however, like being<br/>
&#39;a part&#39; of something bigger and like knowing there is a name for how<br/>
other people parent or homeschool. But I am realizing now that not<br/>
using the term may just be a way that I respect his wishes, while he<br/>
respects my wishes to not institutionalize or test our children.<br/>

And honestly, I probably don&#39;t fit into a radical unschooling label<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then I just wanted to say, I don&#39;t use the term unschooling with<br/>
&gt; my extended family (I come from a long line of educators). And I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; discuss the philosophy of unschooling with anyone who isn&#39;t doing it<br/>
&gt; themselves. I&#39;ll talk about what adventures we&#39;re having or what my<br/>

&gt; they like hearing about our lives. At times I&#39;ve gotten self conscious<br/>
&gt; in some situations where I&#39;m clearly doing my parenting differently<br/>
&gt; then how I was raised, but..oh well. I had to get over that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to not use the term unschooling with my partner, too. He didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want the label. And that&#39;s ok. When we do talk about various family<br/>
&gt; stuff--respect for each other, guidance (discipline), what we want our<br/>

also for the out-working partner. I&#39;ve found it really helpful to just <br/>
send a steady stream of &quot;here&#39;s a picture of DS at Higgins Armory <br/>
looking at the ancient Greek weaponry&quot; &quot;here&#39;s a picture of DS at the <br/>
beach - that&#39;s DH&#39;s hand holding the live whelk&quot; &quot;here&#39;s DS at his golf <br/>
lesson - he was really proud of how much he remembered from last year&quot; <br/>
and so on...lots of tidbits, in words and pictures, that show our <br/>
Lives. Most parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins talk <br/>
about &quot;Mary won the spelling bee&quot; and &quot;Johnny got on the honor roll&quot; <br/>
and so on - that&#39;s how they share their lives because that IS their <br/>
life. Our lives are so different mostly that it can be really helpful <br/>
to &quot;feed&quot; the relatives a steady stream of stuff that they can grab <br/>
onto because we&#39;ve not got the &#39;typical&#39; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW my parents now send us articles they&#39;ve seen in various newspapers <br/>
and such about unschooling - they think it&#39;s cool and makes good sense <br/>
by and large. And my dad&#39;s sister, my 91 yr old aunt, thinks it&#39;s the <br/>
greatest thing since sliced bread and wishes she had been able to <br/>
unschool her youngest (who is a year older than I am). How cool is <br/>
that?!<br/>

when we were going to visit my 91 yr old aunt at her little senior <br/>

talking, etc) we made sure to bring DS&#39; sketchpad, pens, Nintendo DS <br/>

and the kitten would chase it and jump for it and they played for a <br/>
good half hour at a clip with that. In the process, he was able to <br/>
connect with my aunt over the kitten which helped him feel more <br/>
comfortable in that space and she thinks he&#39;s a wonderfully amazing kid <br/>
(he actually *talked* to her directly, instead of doing the &#39;that&#39;s an <br/>
OLD person, avoid avoid avoid thing - I did have to &#39;interpret&#39; on <br/>
occasion because of her hearing loss). When we&#39;re in church, he has his <br/>
bag o&#39; stuff (sketchpad, DS with headphones, snacks, water bottle, misc <br/>
quiet bits - a recent inclusion was a book of puns!lol). <br/>
<br/>
Taking a child (or any person really) into a situation that (a) they <br/>
have no control over and (b) they have no connection to (such as a 4 yr <br/>
old at Aunt Betsy&#39;s totally not child-safe one bedroom apartment) for 3 <br/>
hours of grown up chatting is asking for difficulties in most cases <br/>
UNLESS you account for the situation, discuss it together as partners, <br/>
and provide tools for dealing with it (quiet toys, a favorite video or <br/>
two, a snack if there&#39;s not going to be one handy, etc) Plus, you&#39;d <br/>
also want to be sure to touch base regularly, excuse yourself during a <br/>
lull in conversation and see how things are going, evaluate whether you <br/>
might need to cut things shorter than planned, etc. Simply snatching up <br/>
a child away from their familiar territory and plopping them down in <br/>
some strange place with no resources at all, they&#39;re going to do <br/>
whatever they need to do to keep occupied - which might mean crawling <br/>
around on the floor like a puppy and barking at people. An ounce of <br/>
prevention is worth a pound of cure - rather than looking for &#39;better <br/>
discipline/punishment&#39; methods, work as your child&#39;s partner to find <br/>
ways to avoid or minimize the difficulties of the situation. For <br/>
example, there have been times when we&#39;ve needed to stand and wait for <br/>
something in a space where toys and games and running are just not <br/>
doable (such as waiting in the funeral home lobby before FIL&#39;s funeral <br/>
this past March). We&#39;ve developed (over time) a repertoire of physical <br/>
but quiet and low key activities that let DS burn some of his abundant <br/>
energy without disturbing others - in that case, for example, we found <br/>
an area with a little space around it (3 ft radius roughly) and he <br/>
takes my hand and swings around me in a circle, switching hand to hand <br/>
as one arm reaches its limit like a monkey swinging tree to tree. He <br/>
got energy out, I was able to acknowledge people going past and chat a <br/>
little bit, DH was able to focus on his mom and other family members <br/>
(as well as having space for his own self) and I was able to keep an <br/>
eye out to DH for when he needed us. It really helped also to brief DS <br/>
on what to expect (what he&#39;d see, hear, maybe smell since there&#39;s often <br/>
a bit of air freshener type scent in funeral homes, perhaps feel <br/>
emotionally, and so on). Lots of preparation and lots of discussion in <br/>
the days afterward. Things like the old isometric exercises can be <br/>
helpful - sitting next to each other and placing palm against palm (his <br/>
against mine) and pushing/resisting is quiet but uses some big muscles <br/>
which can help when he&#39;s getting restless. And, sometimes, I&#39;ll excuse <br/>
myself and DS and I will go to another room (bathroom if nowhere else <br/>
is available) so that we can talk without disturbing whatever is going <br/>
on, touch base, work on what is happening, what he needs, what I need, <br/>
etc). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a partnership. Knowing that his needs will be considered and <br/>
addressed as much as possible is sometimes all DS needs to be able to <br/>
manage a particular situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853514924"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, since you asked...<br/>
&gt; I want you to know that we DO advocate radical unschooling here at<br/>

&gt; understanding of what it means because it seems you have some<br/>
&gt; misconceptions about what unlimited tv/video games and other ideas<br/>
&gt; look like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I very may well be on my way to becoming a radical unschooler- I just <br/>
need some insight as to how this works out where everyone&#39;s needs are <br/>
met.  I would love to stay and get a good understanding of what <br/>
radical unschooling looks like.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, seeing children as &quot;sinful&quot; and &quot;needing correction&quot; can<br/>
&gt; actually hinder the parents ability to truly be present and find<br/>
&gt; solutions outside of the punishment/reward paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I come from a different paradigm of thought; I AM sinful, My DH IS <br/>
sinful, and so are my DDs- we all are fallen to sin- and because I <br/>
know that- I can give her GRACE!  She is just like me!  I know that <br/>
none of us are perfect, so when she behaves unfavorably, I forgive <br/>
her and try to get to the root of the problem. I sure as heck don&#39;t <br/>
believe that the bible teaches us to beat the sinfulness out of them- <br/>
that is just untrue and disgusting.  It makes me sad that the bible <br/>
is being taught that way.<br/>
<br/>
I think when you say &#39;needing correction&#39; you are thinking of someone <br/>
else (maybe other punitive Christians?) who are not using gentle <br/>
discipline or mindful parenting... I guess my wordage could use some <br/>
more elaboration.  My husband and I try to practice gentle <br/>
discipline, we do not punish or spank.  We don&#39;t use rewards or <br/>
punishments.  We try to be mindful and put our relationship first. So <br/>
when I say &#39;correction&#39; I mean, stoping and giving my child what they <br/>
need in the moment. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; or &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by<br/>
&gt; Alfie Kohn? Good reads. The idea at this list, is that children (and<br/>
&gt; most all humans) are trying to do their best in every situation.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes we need better tools, or better information but even when <br/>
&gt; a child seems to behave poorly, it is simply that they have no other<br/>
&gt; tools available to them at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I have read both books.  I agree with the basic principles of <br/>
those books; that children are trying to do their very best in every <br/>
situation. I don&#39;t use punishments or rewards- and don&#39;t want to give <br/>
my child an education centered around those two &#39;incentives&#39; for <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We can give you ideas for moving closer to trust, closer to respect<br/>
&gt; and joy. The list exists to help people with that and how to trust <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ALL of your child&#39;s learning whether it&#39;s about chores or tv or food <br/>
or anything else that involves this human learning journey. Because<br/>
learning is learning. Reading isn&#39;t different from chores, food isn&#39;t<br/>
different from math. It&#39;s all just part of life and the learning<br/>
experiences therein.<br/>

early academics is not good for children- even harmful.  Recently he <br/>

developed sets children up for future learning disabilites, etc etc <br/>

By far its not an unschooling article- but its headed in that <br/>

agreed that what we are doing is the right thing, by &#39;waiting&#39; yet he <br/>
