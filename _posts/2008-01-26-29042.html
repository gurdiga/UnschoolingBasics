<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266321827">A friend of mine asked me to pass along this message to unschoolers. <br/>
I hope I don&#39;t overstep boundaries here...  but it is in direct<br/>
relation to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve join Politico and submitted a question for all the Republican<br/>
candidates. <br/>
<br/>
Please go here and vote for it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dyn.politico.com/debate/republicans/VoteForQuestion.cfm#">http://dyn.politico.com/debate/republicans/VoteForQuestion.cfm#</a><br/>
<br/>
Here is my question:<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooling mother, parental rights in regards to education is<br/>
paramount. The National Education Association, which is adamantly<br/>
against homeschooling in any form, is pushing for a national<br/>
curriculum which would infringe on our freedom to allow our child to<br/>
learn in the ways that are best for him. Do you support a national<br/>
curriculum or the NEA&#39;s assessment of homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
*********************<br/>
<br/>
Last I checked the question is currently #249 under the &quot;topics&quot; button.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
