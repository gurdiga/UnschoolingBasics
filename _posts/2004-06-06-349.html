<div id="ygrps-yiv-840286288">While this list was created for the purpose of providing new unschoolers<br/>
with a way to get information about the unschooling philosophy, it&#39;s<br/>
inevitable that some discussion will spill over from the list where<br/>
recent hubbub inspired the creation of this new group.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we can all be a little patient with the people who still have<br/>
some concerns and are not on another list with Helen.  <br/>
<br/>
The list owners have already asked that we move this discussion off list,<br/>
and Helen expressed her willingness to do so or to take it up at<br/>
HEM-Networking or HEM-Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But lets try to understand there are people joining everyday who weren&#39;t<br/>
part of those original discussions here and who still have questions<br/>
about the recent list changes and don&#39;t know where else to get answers. <br/>
This will all clear up in a week or two and until then, if list members<br/>
want to steer the discussion to more immediate unschooly matters they are<br/>
free to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Any list member may contact list owners or mods off list, too, if you<br/>
have questions about the recent changes. (or any little thang.)<br/>

I&#39;d rather not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The list we left was called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com">_unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com">unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com</a>) .  I believe its new name is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_HEMNewHomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com">_HEMNewHomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>_ (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEMNewHomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com">HEMNewHomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>) .  I could be <br/>
wrong about the new name.<br/>
You&#39;re welcome to sign up over there and read the archives.<br/>
Ren and I felt we would do better to set up an e-list for those who wanted  <br/>
answers on understanding unschooling. That list was becoming another war zone  <br/>
and rather anti-unschooling.<br/>
Ren and I (and our moderators, Deb and Rue) are pretty much  dyed-in-the-wool <br/>
unschoolers---we&#39;ve been called the MOST radical of  unschoolers! &lt;g&gt; We <br/>
truly believe that unschooling is the best way for a  child (and an adult) to grow <br/>
up. We are all non-political and could care less  about curricula and <br/>
inclusivity.<br/>
If you want to know more about unschooling, we&#39;re your team! We&#39;ll work  hard <br/>
to explain unschooling and gentle, mindful parenting in a fun (and often  <br/>
humorous) way! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
But we don&#39;t have time for fighting and whining!<br/>
The archives are there (I guess), but to rehash it all on this sparkly new  <br/>
list would not be a good use of time or screen!<br/>
Thanks for understanding!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112031831">I guess I was looking for a basic...&quot;in a nutshell, what was the <br/>
deal&quot; type of answer...not really a rehashing.  It just seems like <br/>
there is so much reference to some kind of controversy and I was just <br/>
curious what the deal was and who the players were.  Am I mistaken, <br/>
or have some of those in question not followed you all over here???  <br/>
Well, all that said, I don&#39;t care that much...really.  I&#39;ve been on <br/>
enough of these lists to know how things can get when people have <br/>
differing opinions about things and sometimes it just goes on and on <br/>
with people trying to prove their point and things get so far from <br/>
what the intent of the list is suppose to be.  I figure something <br/>
like that must have happened.  Anyway...just my inquiring mind <br/>
wanting to know.  I&#39;m really just here to learn about unschooling!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775135534">&quot; Some of the<br/>
more experienced folks here have probably been giving advice for a <br/>
long<br/>
time, and may forget what it is like to have no experience yet of <br/>
what<br/>
unschooling really means, and how righteous it can sound (yes, I love<br/>
you guys, but sometimes you do sound righteous).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a person is confident, some may percieve it as righteous. <br/>
<br/>
I have stated, and Kelly has stated, that these types of discussions <br/>
are not in line with the lists guidelines. Anyone choosing to <br/>
continue on this discourse will find their posts being returned.<br/>
<br/>
Please return to unschooling discussion. Thank you.<br/>

to quite a few. My apologies for the misinformation.<br/>
<br/>
As for the number of posts, I agree. I got sucked into trying to<br/>
answer flames and wasted a lot of my time, and probably, from your<br/>
point of view, yours too. All in all would have been better to to<br/>
answer the woman off-list. Anyhoo. Sinking back into lurkdom now<br/>
