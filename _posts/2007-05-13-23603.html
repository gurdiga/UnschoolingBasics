Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to this list but have been hanging around a bit.  I live in Northern MN with my husband and 3 kids.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for about 6 years now.<br/>
<br/>
World of Warcraft is an amazing game.  There is sooo much to do on the game.  The world is huge so you can explore a ton, there&#39;s roleplaying you can do to show your creativity and then don&#39;t forget the strategy. <br/>
<br/>
4 out of the 5 of us in our family have played WoW and now 2 still play.  My son played to the max level and pretty much did everything he wanted to do.  He didn&#39;t conquer every group instance but he felt like things were getting too repetitive.  He stopped a few months ago, but he probably played for a little over a year.<br/>
<br/>
Abbi (dd12) still plays, she has leveled her character to max level but she loves the roleplaying.  She and her friends love to develop elaborate story lines and the more dramatic the better &lt;g&gt;.  World of Warcraft for her has been an amazing catalyst as far as her wanting to write more and more.  She found role playing forums also where she writes part of a story and then someone else will contribute a part.  <br/>
<br/>
Kyra (dd10) also loves playing.  She&#39;ll level her character a bit but she seems to like exporing more and roleplaying with her cousins and friends in other towns.  She has learned to read, type and spell from WoW.  (and also from other computer use)<br/>
<br/>
There were times, especially with Alec, where his life was very dependent on the game because he had certain times he had to be on the computer to meet up with guild mates and he had to be there.  They would do group instances together and they were amazing.  We respected that devotion and he amazed a lot of people that he was only age 13/14 at the time.  The were all amazed at his maturity and skill at playing the game and communicating.<br/>
<br/>
I think, the time consuming nature of the game can be scary for people but really if you keep your life full and fun and happy,  they&#39;ll also choose to do stuff with you.  There might be times they choose the game over you but that&#39;s ok too.<br/>
<br/>
If you like to read about our life and gaming I have quite a few blogs about it.<br/>
<br/>
I would let him play when he wants and make sure to sit and watch too, check it out, it&#39;s fun, amazing and it can develop into a world of other interests too! :)  And if you can have more than 1 account,  do it!  Then you can play with him! <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-174309515">I have a newly 12 year old avid wow player. He LOVES it! I have become <br/>
less and less controlling and he often stays up till 3am or so. At <br/>
which point I do try to convince him to get to sleep before his dad <br/>
who awakes at 4am for work gets up! Dad isn&#39;t quite on board with the <br/>
unlimited gaming.<br/>

Do the WOW players here have any particular guild?<br/>

We decided a long time ago, that hanging out WITH our children in<br/>
whatever fascinates them, was a lot healthier for our relationships,<br/>
learning and unschooling than trying to &quot;manage&quot; their time.:)<br/>
<br/>
I bring them food occasionally (esp. during raids), hang out and ask<br/>
questions about what is happening and generally make it a point to get<br/>
into THEIR worlds. It&#39;s really cool the things I&#39;ve learned that way.<br/>
 We all get the benefit of staying connected and our relationships get<br/>
the benefit of trust.<br/>
<br/>
All of my children play WoW these days. Jalen (age 6) just got his<br/>
character to level 7 today. It&#39;s been a big month for him...learning<br/>
WoW like his siblings and getting his first loose tooth to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (17) has spent the major part of the last two years playing<br/>
WoW. I referred to it as his &quot;cocoon stage&quot; (thanks to Zenmomma/Mary<br/>
Gold)  which he is now coming out of. He&#39;s filling out job<br/>
applications, studying to take his driving permit test (it will be the<br/>
first test he&#39;s ever taken in his entire life) and dating another<br/>
homeschooled teen that plays WoW. Go figure!  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re seeing the end of the &quot;cocooning&quot; as he expands his world<br/>
outward and seeks new adventures. We didn&#39;t control his time on<br/>
gaming, we still don&#39;t. We trust that what he needs is different than<br/>
what we need and he will learn exactly what is important for HIM. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t manage my children&#39;s time, I enjoy it with them. There is a<br/>
wonderful place that isn&#39;t about controlling, nor is about ignoring.<br/>
It is a connected place, a place of trust and respect. It&#39;s where<br/>
unschooling blossoms.<br/>

It is an amazing game.  I have seven kids home and six of them played. <br/>
<br/>
I have shared Julies&#39; concern about time managed. BUT once again <br/>
unschooling has proved itself. <br/>
<br/>
My son who seemed almost obsessed with the game got to a level he was <br/>
very happy with, after playing at every opportunity for month and once <br/>
day said he was done. <br/>
<br/>
He is now spending his time reading Zelda stories on the computer. He <br/>
is very fascinated with Link.<br/>
<br/>
My other kids are playing and my son who has quit will give them tips <br/>
and watch them as they play, but is onto other things for the moment.<br/>
