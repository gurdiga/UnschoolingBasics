<div id="ygrps-yiv-861522586">Thanks, all, for the wonderful responses on dealing with violence.   <br/>
You&#39;ve given me a lot (more) to think about!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a blissful few days here, but instead of just relaxing  <br/>
through this little interlude (the angry outbursts seem to come in  <br/>
cycles, sometimes with weeks of peace in between, often lulling me  <br/>
into thinking  maybe we&#39;ve gotten through that phase....)  I am using  <br/>
it to find every possible opportunity to build my relationship with my  <br/>
son.  It&#39;s been fascinating.  I&#39;m learning about him and my daughter  <br/>
but even more about myself, and my amazing ability to make  &quot;yes&quot;   <br/>
sound negative.   (i.e.  Yes, but only if......     Yes, but be  <br/>
careful to.........  Yes, but I expect.........  etc. etc.)  I think  <br/>
in  my own childhood I internalized a bit of guilt about feeling joy  <br/>
or pleasure for following one&#39;s heart (after all, joy and pleasure are  <br/>
supposed to result from hard work, doing a good job, mastering  <br/>
impulses and serving others; indulging yourself is....... well,  <br/>
indulgent!)  and attaching downers to everything has been my sort of  <br/>
psychic compromise between what I carry around subconsciously and what  <br/>
makes sense to me now.  Now that I see that, of course, I&#39;m dropping  <br/>
it, and making sure my kids know that when I say  Yes  it&#39;s not coming  <br/>
with a grudge but with love and joy and total support.<br/>
<br/>
That helps some -- there&#39;s been a lot of joy and generosity around  <br/>
here recently, since these things are contagious!!  Even so, though,  <br/>
there are times when my son&#39;s desires simply can&#39;t be met, and until  <br/>
he trusts that I really and truly want to do all I can to facilitate  <br/>
him getting what he wants, these unavoidable  &quot;no&#39;s&quot;  are likely to  <br/>
set him off on one of his horrible tantrums.  (This is my theory right  <br/>
now, at least -- that once he can get past the conviction that the  <br/>
whole world is out to get him, he&#39;ll be able to handle the times when  <br/>
he is let down better.)  So for the past several days I&#39;ve been  <br/>
repeating to myself,  &quot;it&#39;s about the relationship&quot;  almost like a  <br/>
mantra, in hopes that when tempers flare I can focus my response on  <br/>
what&#39;s broken or breaking in the relationship and attempt to set that  <br/>
right, rather than trying to fix the situation that seems to have  <br/>
triggered the anger.  I&#39;ve had a couple opportunities to practice this  <br/>
approach in the last couple days, and am encouraged that even my  <br/>
clumsy attempts seem to help some.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks again for all the suggestions.  I really, really  <br/>
appreciate the support!<br/>
