<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306028606">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
 We are currently living in Idaho (where I know the homeschooling laws <br/>
are very &#39;relaxed&#39; and &#39;open&#39;) after having moved here in February from <br/>
Omaha Nebraska. However, due to a rather sad job market (or so we&#39;ve <br/>
found in the town we live in anyway) we have decided we are likely <br/>
going to move back to Omaha next Spring/Summer. (as soon as we can sell <br/>
our house/land and get all the particulars worked out etc) As I&#39;ve <br/>
discussed on the group before, I plan to homeschool/unschool my kids <br/>
(they are only 3 1/3 and nearly 2 just now so I&#39;ve got a bit of time <br/>
before I have to worry about the &#39;laws&#39; but...). Does anyone know <br/>
the &#39;laws&#39; and whatnot in Nebraska regarding Homeschooling? I tried to <br/>
find something about it on the internet and found a law about how if <br/>
you homeschool you need to &#39;establish a private school&#39; to <br/>
homeschool... Does anyone have experience with this and how it is done. <br/>
It also appears there are attendance requirements and I assume those <br/>
can be met by just keeping a &#39;record&#39; of attendance in a book (easy <br/>
enough)... Any ideas or experience would be appriciated. Thanks!<br/>
Smiles,<br/>

as a starting point and hopefully someone here is from Nebraska who <br/>
can point to you a more detailed site.   Also, have you looked to see <br/>
if there are any yahoo homeschool groups in NE?  I belong to the one <br/>
in MA that&#39;s more traditional as far as homeschoolers go, but it was <br/>
very helpful when I was first starting out as far as learning a lot <br/>
about the particulars and ins and outs of filing paperwork etc in my <br/>
state.   I found this after a quick search of yahoo groups:<br/>

 Thanks! I&#39;d found and signed up for the NESHE group but hadn&#39;t found <br/>
the Bellevue/Offutt one! Thanks for finding that for me! <br/>
