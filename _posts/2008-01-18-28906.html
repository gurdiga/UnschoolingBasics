<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997666785">Hi, I am asking these questions as I know many of you have older <br/>
children than mine and the benefit of time and experience, and also <br/>
asking them in light of &quot;strewing&quot; and if it is manipulative, about <br/>
teaching vs being a facilitator, and of having faith that unschooling <br/>
will be &quot;enough&quot; if that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time overcoming my math fears and trying to relax <br/>
about it, especially now that dd is of mandatory school age in my <br/>
province and I have to submit progress reports (no actual &quot;evidence&quot;) <br/>
twice a year.  It has just made my fears hit more close to home.  <br/>
It&#39;s <br/>
not that I am trying to relax from a curriculum I have imposed (we <br/>
have <br/>
not used any), it&#39;s that I feel so confused and unsure trying to sort <br/>
out the whole math thing in my mind that I feel I haven&#39;t done near <br/>
as <br/>
much as I could in helping my kids discover the patterns, <br/>
relationships, games, etc that so many unschoolers say math is.<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of reading Math Power by Patricia Kenschaft after <br/>
hearing Pam Sooroshian talk about it on tape.  It has been great in <br/>
showing me about the &quot;language&quot; of math, incorporating it in real <br/>
life, <br/>
etc, and doing this seems so &quot;easy&quot; with ds as he has recently become <br/>
very interested in counting everything, the clock, obviously DELIGHTS <br/>
in numbers/quantity and how it can change, all that sort of stuff, <br/>
and <br/>
due to reading this book I feel more able to &quot;facilitate&quot; an explore <br/>
this with him.  It feels &quot;natural&quot; to point it out to him.<br/>
<br/>
With dd however I feel like I missed that boat in a way as (ok, I <br/>
know <br/>
it is a schooly comparison but it is for puroposes of illustration <br/>
for <br/>
you all) she would maybe have a kindy-gr 1 level of understanding in <br/>
math, I know it is just from talking about what we see in everyday <br/>
life, cooking, reading a book, she knows &quot;intuitively&quot; somehow what <br/>
is <br/>
bigger, which thing is 3rd in line, etc and that has all &quot;gelled&quot; <br/>
over <br/>
a period of the last few years, but I guess I have nothing &quot;ongoing&quot; <br/>
at <br/>
the moment to show me how unschooling math &quot;works&quot;, or how she can <br/>
get <br/>
farther along in it.  With reading for example, I can see how all the <br/>
playing Starfall she was attracted to and being read to and fiddling <br/>
with alphabet letters <br/>
on the fridge and CONSTANTLY asking what things say has led to her <br/>
reading, and the same now slowly with writing and spelling, because <br/>
she &quot;needs&quot; them to for the things she wants to do (write on her <br/>
pictures, do a comic strip and such) My faith in her reading without <br/>
lessons developed at the same time I could see reading happening, one <br/>
feeding off the other y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is all because dd is &quot;school age&quot; now.  I also have a <br/>
hard <br/>
time not fretting about the arithmetic/4 basic operations aspect of <br/>
math.  Yes I know dd ps&#39;ed peers play with blocks and rods, etc BUT <br/>
with the agenda and learning objectives the teacher expects of them  <br/>
I <br/>
remember drill and being expected to memorize and crying becuse I <br/>
could not understand the &quot;why&quot; of borrowing!  Does a gr 2&#39;er need to <br/>
mememorize addition facts or just understand what it is? I have in <br/>
all <br/>
my reading online about unschooling math rarely seen the whole <br/>
competency and speed at &quot;computing&quot; issue addressed, especially with <br/>
older unschoolers.  I guess I am thinking does playing dice for YEARS <br/>
teach you enough math to get by as an adult (the everday consumer <br/>
math, <br/>
not algebra or anything!)  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you hear stories of unschoolers being shown what &quot;long division&quot; <br/>
is at 13 because it just &quot;came up&quot; and then they &quot;get it&quot; without all <br/>
those years of school math drill, but does being shown it once or <br/>
twice <br/>
lead to skill? Does it need to? I just remember all those years of <br/>
being made to practice over and over again.  Again this is something <br/>
I have never <br/>
seen addressed online by my fellow unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
DD can sense any sort of &quot;this is meant to teach you...&#39;this&#39;&quot; I <br/>
think.  I have so many sites bookmarked, I have so many books like <br/>
Family Math for Young Children, Games for Math by Penny Kaye sitting <br/>
on <br/>
the shelf pretty much unused because I can&#39;t balance the just doing <br/>
it <br/>
with her because it is &quot;neat&quot; and a fun game, with the fear that if <br/>
she <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;practice&quot; or do the &quot;dice game&quot; enough she won&#39;t &quot;have her <br/>
facts down&quot;. I see so many math things like computer games, <br/>
workbooks, <br/>
etc that are thinly disguised drill, like those dollar-store-books <br/>
that <br/>
have comparing numbers of 3 types of toys and drawing a circle graph <br/>
(gr 2 curriculum in my province BTW), or adding 45+3 in picture <br/>
form.  <br/>
My dd would look at something like that and thing &quot;what the heck <br/>
for?&quot;  <br/>
Is that even relevant to a 7 yr old? LOL even a writing workbook <br/>
given <br/>
to her by my MIL turned her off, I didn&#39;t care and just let her go at <br/>
it on blank paper and she learned to write, it&#39;s like she sees <br/>
the &quot;expectations&quot; of workbooks and the more structured stuff loud <br/>
and <br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
Where does introducing stuff fall into place in light of being an <br/>
unschooler?  What about strewing?  I know bigger numbers have come up <br/>
in our lives, do I get Cusinaire rods or something, not to do <br/>
the exercises &quot;everyday at the same time&quot; like my structured hs-ing <br/>
friends do but to <br/>
have as a resource around to show her place value or comparing 10 to <br/>
100 say if it came up, just to &quot;have it there?&quot;  OR would that be too <br/>
much manipulation and expectation?  I guess I am having a hard time <br/>
having &quot;resources&quot; around without the fears and concerns she is <br/>
not &quot;using&quot; it if that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long and so jumbled as I pour this out.  I am so <br/>
confused in this area.  I am looking for personal stories especially <br/>
from you with older kids, and for a kick in the butt, and for <br/>
suggestion as to how to relax.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114102097">Tina,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about math and learning specific facts, etc. for a few<br/>
days, and would like to share my rambling thoughts.  They seem to go along<br/>
with your questions, perhaps we can come up with some answers together. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The more I embrace the idea of my kids just *living*, as opposed to them<br/>
constantly learning, the easier the whole thing becomes for me.  I think the<br/>
unschooling community talks about natural math in order to illustrate what<br/>
*can* be learned naturally (which is everything!), instead of it being a<br/>
checklist of things that your child *should* be learning naturally.  If you<br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t care about measuring cooking ingredients in order to pick<br/>
up fractions and volumes and such, so what?  If there comes a time in her<br/>
life when she needs to know those things in order to do something she wants<br/>
to do, she&#39;ll learn it.  If she doesn&#39;t ever need it, why should she know<br/>
about it?  I imagine there are oodles of math concepts which I know nothing<br/>
about, but it doesn&#39;t hinder my life currently.  If it ever came up, I&#39;d<br/>
learn the new stuff I needed to know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As far as drilling and memorization, again, if someone finds that they would<br/>
like to have faster access to number results than they currently do, they<br/>
can easily find ways to speed their thinking.  But why make those<br/>
calcuations quickly if you don&#39;t need to?  I memorized the times tables as a<br/>
kid (ugh!!!) but I often do not remember what a certain answer is for a<br/>
multiplication question in real life.  Certainly I understand what<br/>
multiplication is and how it works, so it&#39;s quick work to figure out what I<br/>
need to know.  If I had an activity (job, hobby, etc.) that used<br/>
multiplication often, I&#39;d likely put some effort toward speeding up my<br/>
calculating skills.  No difficulty there, no stress or feeling bad that I<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it before.  Just something new to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You might also want to cut yourself some slack on the differing interest in<br/>
numbers between your son and daughter.  Some people love numbers and working<br/>
them, some don&#39;t.  Something very funny just happened with my kids (while I<br/>
was typing this!) that illustrates this perfectly.  They are playing a game<br/>
on the Xbox, and on that system many games have &quot;achievements&quot; which you can<br/>
earn for doing certain parts of the game in certain ways.  My older son (8.5<br/>
years) adores this and finds it very important to play just the right way in<br/>
order to unlock the achievements.  My 4.5yo son doesn&#39;t care at all, doesn&#39;t<br/>
even really understand what it&#39;s all about.  So they are playing together<br/>
right now, and screaming at each other about what characters to play.  Turns<br/>
out the 8.5yo wanted to unlock an achievement for the 4.5yo, and was being<br/>
very insistent about doing the game a certain way.  I pointed out to him<br/>
that not everyone is interested in the same things, and what is of paramount<br/>
importance to him might be meangingless for someone else.  He was stunned.<br/>
We don&#39;t all want the same things?  Wow, that&#39;s hard to grasp.  I think we<br/>
all fall into that trap of thinking on occaision. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To make it all more complicated, when you are required to report a child&#39;s<br/>
learning to an authority figure this becomes more stressful than it really<br/>
needs to be.  That&#39;s where the fear based thinking comes up, and we start<br/>
pushing for our kids to live in ways that are easily documented and<br/>
convenient for other people.  But life isn&#39;t like that.  It&#39;s like when my<br/>
kids were babies and I breastfed them to sleep.  This drove my mom crazy<br/>
because when they stayed with her for a few hours, she found putting them<br/>
down for a nap (which she felt they needed at a certain time) was very<br/>
difficult, since they were accustomed to nursing to sleep.  She made a big<br/>
argument for why I should teach them to fall asleep on their own, trying to<br/>
make it sound like it was for the child&#39;s benefit.  When really it was for<br/>
*her* convenience!  I made that clear to her, and she eventually got the<br/>
idea.  I think reporting our children&#39;s learning is very much like this.  If<br/>
they would just do seatwork in a planned way, it was make the reporting so<br/>
much easier!  But that&#39;s for someone else&#39;s convenience, not for my child&#39;s<br/>
benefit.  So I figure out the little subject chart as best I can, making it<br/>
a game for myself.  But I work very hard on my own thinking so that I won&#39;t<br/>
force my kids into something &quot;educational&quot; so that I can write it on the<br/>
chart.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My lord, I&#39;ve written a novel here!  But hopefully this will open more ideas<br/>
from everyone on how we think about all of this and how to calm down about<br/>
it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358622092">It sounds like you have a lot of information about math learning and <br/>
lots of resources for your kids, yet you are still not satisfied.    <br/>
Maybe it will help to think more in depth about your own math <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
I remember drill and being expected to memorize and crying becuse I<br/>
could not understand the &quot;why&quot; of borrowing! Does a gr 2&#39;er need to<br/>
mememorize addition facts or just understand what it is? I have in<br/>
all my reading online about unschooling math rarely seen the whole<br/>
competency and speed at &quot;computing&quot; issue addressed, especially with<br/>
older unschoolers.<br/>
==========<br/>
Others may give their opinion of the importance of computing speed, <br/>
but if you look at how you do math in your own life, you may be able <br/>
to answer your own question.  Your fear of math or fear of your <br/>
daughter learning math or both seems to be clouding your own <br/>
observation of how YOU use math now, today.  Do you have to have fast <br/>
computing speed in anything you do?  What depth of understanding do <br/>
YOU have about borrowing?  Does this knowledge or lack thereof affect <br/>
your daily life?  Does your daughter&#39;s knowledge of addition facts <br/>
affect her daily life, today, at age 8?<br/>
<br/>
In high school I worked at a fabric store.  Something was always on <br/>
sale and invariably some little old lady would come in wanting fabric <br/>
for a quilt.  She would want an eighth of a yard of the lovely blue <br/>
calico for 4.99/yd at 30% off and a quarter yard of the chintz for <br/>
3.49/yd at 25% percent off.  After cutting about five different types <br/>
of fabric like this, she would remember at the last minute that she <br/>
had her frequent buyer card that would give her an extra 10% on the <br/>
whole lot.  I would have to do all this calculation without a <br/>
calculator, while the customer chatted with me and three others <br/>
waited in line.  I learned how to take percentages in school, but <br/>
nothing could have prepared me for doing that job, short of doing <br/>
it.  I quit my job at the fabric store when I went off to college.  <br/>
In college I decided to get a degree in math.  I did some pretty <br/>
abstract stuff. Addition facts and my skills I had learned at the <br/>
fabric store were useless.  When I got out of school and became an <br/>
engineer, I used some pretty sophisticated math which still didn&#39;t <br/>
require any addition facts, nor any facility at computing numbers <br/>
quickly.  Fast computation was the computer&#39;s job, thank you very <br/>
much.  When I left work to be home full time, I no longer needed the <br/>
abstract/sophisticated stuff.   Much of it is long forgotten (Fancy <br/>
numerical analysis is somehow lost on that laundry. LOL )  Recently I <br/>
have been cooking a lot.  I just got a cook book from Australia which <br/>
has metric measurements.  I&#39;m learning to do conversions again, <br/>
something I haven&#39;t done since high school.  Throughout my life, I <br/>
have always learned and used the math I needed at the time.  The <br/>
drilling preparation in school really wasn&#39;t useful for me.  The <br/>
fabric store was definitely the biggest example of that.<br/>
<br/>
So.that&#39;s why I suggest asking yourself how you have learned and <br/>
used math in your own life.  If you can remember back when you were <br/>
your daughter&#39;s age, besides the drilling in school, what kind of <br/>
math did you use?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, if you are thinking that I&#39;m just one of those lucky <br/>
ones who just `got&#39; math.  I was put in a remedial math group in <br/>
second grade.  Go figure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>13 years of drill doesn&#39;t lead many of schooled kids to &quot;skill.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It leads MANY of them to avoidance, confusion, embarrassment, stress,  <br/>
and fear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really and truly - if you live an active life, and if you don&#39;t avoid  <br/>
anything that looks like math to you, the kids WILL pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
But, if it worries you, then play games. You can come up with all  <br/>
kinds of fun games that support learning math - introduce the games  <br/>
and then follow your daughter&#39;s lead - if the games are fun, then fine  <br/>
- keep playing. If he&#39;s bored, then your game isn&#39;t appropriately  <br/>
challenging and if it is too hard or something she&#39;s not  <br/>
developmentally ready for yet, she&#39;ll show it by not wanting to play.<br/>
<br/>
There is truly no timetable that matters. Just immerse them in a world  <br/>
that includes real math and they&#39;ll soak it up.<br/>
<br/>
Play:<br/>
<br/>
board games (Clue, Monopoly, Sorry, Chutes and Ladders), dice games,  <br/>
card games, finger games, physical games, strategy games (Penne,  <br/>
Blokus, Othello, Ingenious), visual games ( SET).<br/>
<br/>
Go look here - I have written up a bit of stuff about games and math -  <br/>
there are dice games, paper and pencil games, coins games, and more.<br/>

<br/>
Focus on having fun playing the games. You can&#39;t control the learning  <br/>
anyway, you can only provide a rich and stimulating environment in  <br/>
which learning will naturally flourish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139245764">Tina,  this really resonated with me. I am like a poster-child to show that we probably will all learn the kind of math we need or want when we find that we need or want it. That totally played out in my life. And the math I do know sure didn&#39;t come from school, just the fear of it.  So I am not tempted to think that my kids need formal lessons.  However, I am having trouble with strewing their path with math.  Like Tina says below, my kids can smell anything meant to teach them immediately, and of course I don&#39;t even want to sneak anything by them.  So if I suggest any games (like those from Pam Sorooshian&#39;s site) they refuse immediately.  And I honor their right to refuse, and it just passes on.  But they really never even let me show them any of it.  I guess my question is....it&#39;s my perception that with this situation, the right thing to do is let it drop, figuring that if and when they need this knowlege they&#39;ll search it out.  OK, that&#39;s great.  As<br/>
 long as I am not letting them down by failing to figure out how to gracefully strew their path. That&#39;s part of what I thought Tina was asking...how hard do you try to strew a path when they aren&#39;t looking at the path?  Isn&#39;t the answer that we must let them look where THEY are looking? I hope this was clear!  Thanks.... Cameron<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] ???&#39;s, how to develop faith about unschooling math....<br/>
<br/>
Hi, I am asking these questions as I know many of you have older <br/>
children than mine and the benefit of time and experience, and also <br/>
asking them in light of &quot;strewing&quot; and if it is manipulative, about <br/>
teaching vs being a facilitator, and of having faith that unschooling <br/>
will be &quot;enough&quot; if that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time overcoming my math fears and trying to relax <br/>
about it, especially now that dd is of mandatory school age in my <br/>
province and I have to submit progress reports (no actual &quot;evidence&quot;) <br/>
twice a year. It has just made my fears hit more close to home. <br/>
It&#39;s <br/>
not that I am trying to relax from a curriculum I have imposed (we <br/>
have <br/>
not used any), it&#39;s that I feel so confused and unsure trying to sort <br/>
out the whole math thing in my mind that I feel I haven&#39;t done near <br/>
as <br/>
much as I could in helping my kids discover the patterns, <br/>
relationships, games, etc that so many unschoolers say math is.<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of reading Math Power by Patricia Kenschaft after <br/>
hearing Pam Sooroshian talk about it on tape. It has been great in <br/>
showing me about the &quot;language&quot; of math, incorporating it in real <br/>
life, <br/>
etc, and doing this seems so &quot;easy&quot; with ds as he has recently become <br/>
very interested in counting everything, the clock, obviously DELIGHTS <br/>
in numbers/quantity and how it can change, all that sort of stuff, <br/>
and <br/>
due to reading this book I feel more able to &quot;facilitate&quot; an explore <br/>
this with him. It feels &quot;natural&quot; to point it out to him.<br/>
<br/>
With dd however I feel like I missed that boat in a way as (ok, I <br/>
know <br/>
it is a schooly comparison but it is for puroposes of illustration <br/>
for <br/>
you all) she would maybe have a kindy-gr 1 level of understanding in <br/>
math, I know it is just from talking about what we see in everyday <br/>
life, cooking, reading a book, she knows &quot;intuitively&quot; somehow what <br/>
is <br/>
bigger, which thing is 3rd in line, etc and that has all &quot;gelled&quot; <br/>
over <br/>
a period of the last few years, but I guess I have nothing &quot;ongoing&quot; <br/>
at <br/>
the moment to show me how unschooling math &quot;works&quot;, or how she can <br/>
get <br/>
farther along in it. With reading for example, I can see how all the <br/>
playing Starfall she was attracted to and being read to and fiddling <br/>
with alphabet letters <br/>
on the fridge and CONSTANTLY asking what things say has led to her <br/>
reading, and the same now slowly with writing and spelling, because <br/>
she &quot;needs&quot; them to for the things she wants to do (write on her <br/>
pictures, do a comic strip and such) My faith in her reading without <br/>
lessons developed at the same time I could see reading happening, one <br/>
feeding off the other y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is all because dd is &quot;school age&quot; now. I also have a <br/>
hard <br/>
time not fretting about the arithmetic/4 basic operations aspect of <br/>
math. Yes I know dd ps&#39;ed peers play with blocks and rods, etc BUT <br/>
with the agenda and learning objectives the teacher expects of them <br/>
I <br/>
remember drill and being expected to memorize and crying becuse I <br/>
could not understand the &quot;why&quot; of borrowing! Does a gr 2&#39;er need to <br/>
mememorize addition facts or just understand what it is? I have in <br/>
all <br/>
my reading online about unschooling math rarely seen the whole <br/>
competency and speed at &quot;computing&quot; issue addressed, especially with <br/>
older unschoolers. I guess I am thinking does playing dice for YEARS <br/>
teach you enough math to get by as an adult (the everday consumer <br/>
math, <br/>
not algebra or anything!) <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you hear stories of unschoolers being shown what &quot;long division&quot; <br/>
is at 13 because it just &quot;came up&quot; and then they &quot;get it&quot; without all <br/>
those years of school math drill, but does being shown it once or <br/>
twice <br/>
lead to skill? Does it need to? I just remember all those years of <br/>
being made to practice over and over again. Again this is something <br/>
I have never <br/>
seen addressed online by my fellow unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
DD can sense any sort of &quot;this is meant to teach you...&#39;this&#39; &quot; I <br/>
think. I have so many sites bookmarked, I have so many books like <br/>
Family Math for Young Children, Games for Math by Penny Kaye sitting <br/>
on <br/>
the shelf pretty much unused because I can&#39;t balance the just doing <br/>
it <br/>
with her because it is &quot;neat&quot; and a fun game, with the fear that if <br/>
she <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;practice&quot; or do the &quot;dice game&quot; enough she won&#39;t &quot;have her <br/>
facts down&quot;. I see so many math things like computer games, <br/>
workbooks, <br/>
etc that are thinly disguised drill, like those dollar-store- books <br/>
that <br/>
have comparing numbers of 3 types of toys and drawing a circle graph <br/>
(gr 2 curriculum in my province BTW), or adding 45+3 in picture <br/>
form. <br/>
My dd would look at something like that and thing &quot;what the heck <br/>
for?&quot; <br/>
Is that even relevant to a 7 yr old? LOL even a writing workbook <br/>
given <br/>
to her by my MIL turned her off, I didn&#39;t care and just let her go at <br/>
it on blank paper and she learned to write, it&#39;s like she sees <br/>
the &quot;expectations&quot; of workbooks and the more structured stuff loud <br/>
and <br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
Where does introducing stuff fall into place in light of being an <br/>
unschooler? What about strewing? I know bigger numbers have come up <br/>
in our lives, do I get Cusinaire rods or something, not to do <br/>
the exercises &quot;everyday at the same time&quot; like my structured hs-ing <br/>
friends do but to <br/>
have as a resource around to show her place value or comparing 10 to <br/>
100 say if it came up, just to &quot;have it there?&quot; OR would that be too <br/>
much manipulation and expectation? I guess I am having a hard time <br/>
having &quot;resources&quot; around without the fears and concerns she is <br/>
not &quot;using&quot; it if that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long and so jumbled as I pour this out. I am so <br/>
confused in this area. I am looking for personal stories especially <br/>
from you with older kids, and for a kick in the butt, and for <br/>
suggestion as to how to relax.<br/>

=======<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful to think of strewing their path with things you <br/>
find interesting or things that you think they may find interesting, <br/>
rather than strewing `math&#39;.  When you strew, strew something that is <br/>
a little closer to your kids&#39; existing interests/passions.  If you <br/>
chose to dissect any one interest, you could probably segment it into <br/>
school subjects such as math or English, but it&#39;s rather anemic to <br/>
reduce the world to five or so categories; especially, when learning <br/>
is all about making many many connections from all that you are <br/>
surrounded by.<br/>
<br/>
My son recently has been very passionate about Star Wars.  Anything <br/>
and everything is Star Wars these days.  We started out with the <br/>
movie marathon where we watched all six films.  He then proceeded to <br/>
write a bit of an introduction for a role playing game based on Lego <br/>
Star Wars.  One day I was at the music store getting some stuff for <br/>
myself.  I offered to get some Star Wars music to play for him on the <br/>
piano.  He decided he wanted to try playing it himself.  My son had <br/>
not taken a single lesson in piano and had not shown any interest at <br/>
all until that day.  If I had thought about strewing writing so he <br/>
would write he would have never produced the wonderful Star Wars <br/>
intro for his game.  If I had strewn the piano and said here you <br/>
might learn some notes, he wouldn&#39;t have even glanced at the thing.  <br/>
As far as he was concerned, his writing was a means to tell his <br/>
story.  Learning how to play the piano was merely a means to play his <br/>
Star Wars music.  Since then, he has learned other piano pieces.  <br/>
Playing the piano has now become an interest in itself.<br/>
<br/>
As a math example, my daughter resists any math games for math&#39;s <br/>
sake.   For her, Webkinz has been the passion recently.  She has <br/>
learned a lot about arithmetic via this game.  She watches her money <br/>
and spends it very carefully.  She has learned how to read numbers <br/>
into the thousands.  She has learned how to subtract from these <br/>
larger numbers.  And, this is just from my cursory observation.  Who <br/>
knows what other connections that she has made.  If I would have <br/>
said, `Here&#39;s a game that might help you learn math,&#39; she would not <br/>
have been very excited.  But instead I said, `Look here honey, isn&#39;t <br/>
this a cute animal?  Oh, it says here on this tag that you can play <br/>
with him on the computer too.  Would you like to get it?&#39;   Well duh, <br/>
who can resist that?  Ok, maybe my son, but you get the point.<br/>
<br/>
I am guilty of strewing writing for my son and strewing math for my <br/>
daughter.  It worked to undermine our relationship every time.  When <br/>
my motives behind strewing shifted from fear of them learning school <br/>
subjects to serving them and their interests, everything changed.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we are currently doing math every night after dinner.  We <br/>
get out the Visual Brainstorms Cards (math puzzles not arithmetic. By <br/>
Martin Gardner) and try to solve a problem together as a family.   <br/>
The kids are the ones who jump up and grab the set of cards and ask <br/>
if we can do one.  They don&#39;t see it as math.  They see it as time <br/>
spent together having a fun challenge.  There is no way that I could <br/>
have _made_ that happen.  It&#39;s a certain magic that follows strewing <br/>
when the motives are free of fear.   It is also unique to our family, <br/>
our kids, their ages, and the exact circumstances.  I didn&#39;t strew <br/>
the cards the first night we played with them; I was actually in the <br/>
middle of going through a bunch of junk on our bookcase.   The cards <br/>
just happen to be out.  I think the scary thing is that these things <br/>
seem so incidental and cannot be controlled.  I like to think of this <br/>
way, like the stock market, prices may vary, but generally over the <br/>
long haul you get good return on your investment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242703245">Dana,  I love it when I get the exact answer I wanted! This feels &#39;in synch&#39; and right. Thank you so much! I guess that I am still new enough to need the reassurance you gave.  Funny thing is, my kids are so good at knowing what they want, that the contived strewing never works.  I know this. I wasn&#39;t even tempted to do it, simply because I have finally realized it never works. I guess I just needed some affirmation!  Thanks so much!!  Cameron <br/>

<br/>
Think of it this way: Do kids learn English in order to learn nouns  <br/>
and verbs? Or do they unconsciously pick up nouns and verbs as a side  <br/>
effect of using English to get what they want. If you ask them, they  <br/>
may not know what a noun is, but I&#39;m betting they never say &quot;Cat the  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. Like with English kids will pick up an understanding of how  <br/>
numbers work as they use them for what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike school where being able to demonstrate that you&#39;ve memorized  <br/>
how to manipulate numbers is important, in real life figuring out a  <br/>
way to get to where you want to be is is what&#39;s important. By doing  <br/>
that kids build an understanding of how English and numbers and the  <br/>
world in general works that&#39;s constantly being reworked and refined  <br/>
as their understanding grows.<br/>
<br/>
Schools *hope* kids pick up understanding after tedious hours of  <br/>
practice, but they can&#39;t guarantee it. It&#39;s not because schools are  <br/>
mean ;-) It&#39;s because schools must demonstrate that they&#39;re  <br/>
accomplishing their goals of teaching and to do that they need to  <br/>
test. But testing understanding is very very difficult. Testing  <br/>
memorization, on the other hand, is relatively easy. They&#39;re trapped  <br/>
using methods that make real learning very difficult but allow them  <br/>
to show learning happens.<br/>
<br/>
  In fact, it seems from all the math phobia, that what schools teach  <br/>
kids best is that math is hard and boring and something to be  <br/>
avoided. And by avoiding math in real life, they miss out on  <br/>
opportunities to understand how numbers work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777177721">Exactly - it&#39;s about strewing things that are interesting in and of<br/>
themselves, not strewing &quot;subjects&quot;. Even though DS knows that &quot;math&quot;<br/>
exists (sometimes we&#39;ll kid as we walk through the &quot;homeschooling&quot;<br/>
section of the bookstore &quot;are you SURE you don&#39;t want a math workbook?&quot;<br/>

bit now because he&#39;s decided he wants to play cribbage with me and DH<br/>
so, while it&#39;s not huge numbers, it is calculating running totals and<br/>
seeing patterns on the fly. yesterday, he won a game with no assistance<br/>
from us (he used to want one of us to &#39;coach&#39; him while he played the<br/>
other). Numbers are everywhere really - calculating how many more points<br/>
to level up in a game, figuring up how much money he has and how much he<br/>
needs to get something he wants, measuring, percentages (how much tax on<br/>
that thing he wants to buy, what is a &#39;tip&#39; and how do you figure it<br/>
out), all sorts of things use numbers every day. Just as you can&#39;t put a<br/>
white sock in with a brand new red sweatshirt without the sock getting<br/>
at least a bit pink, so too you can&#39;t have a kid out and about in this<br/>

Thank you for that whole post, Joyce!  How very true!  I was a teacher for<br/>
12 years, and ultimately left the profession because I couldn&#39;t reconcile<br/>
within myself the huge gap between what my expertise (and research, and<br/>
-yes- college education) had taught me about how children learn and what the<br/>
schools did to &quot;teach&quot; the various subjects!  And it isn&#39;t like I don&#39;t<br/>
understand the huge difficulty that is place before the teachers when they<br/>
have 30+ kids to a classroom.  But I don&#39;t think that excuses doing what is<br/>
*easy* over doing what is right  (I actually had an administrator scold me<br/>
for creating a curriculum that was individualized to each student-because it<br/>
was *too much work* --for ME, not the kids!  Ugh!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this post came at a great time for my family.  My husband and I are<br/>
in the process of deschooling ourselves and entering into unschooling our 3<br/>
of our children.  My husband and I talk about this topic of unschooling math<br/>
often.  His concern is what if Jonah (8- and the oldest who will be<br/>
unschooled) in his teens (or pre-teens-or whenever) decides on a career path<br/>
that he did not consider in his *early years* and now he is without the<br/>
basics he needs to follow that path later on.  Now understand-my husband is<br/>
an engineer and knew he wanted to be an engineer pretty early on in his high<br/>
school years.  I, on the other hand, have been a retail manager, a teacher,<br/>
a graphic artist, and now a massage therapist and reiki practitioner-and I<br/>
still haven&#39;t *decided* what I want to be when I grow up!!!!  In most cases,<br/>
reminding him of that I have repackaged my own career(s) as the interests<br/>
strike me, and that I had no medical/science basics when I decided on this<br/>
last career-and yet here I am!-has helped him understand that life and goals<br/>
do not look a certain way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414645587">You might want to make a distinction between &quot;having faith&quot; <br/>
and &quot;feeling confident&quot;.<br/>
I would describe confidence as arising from having evidence that you <br/>
are able to move toward or create the kind of life that you want; <br/>
having faith means to me that you have the belief that the nature of <br/>
life is such that whatever happens or comes your way, you will be <br/>
able to derive at least some good from it.<br/>
I understand the &quot;progress reports&quot; that you are being asked for - <br/>
while not actually requiring you to provide &quot;evidence of progress&quot; - <br/>
as suggestive that the authorities are actually already partly <br/>
confident that you can provide a healthy learning environment for <br/>
your children; all they are really trying to do is check <br/>
for &quot;negative evidence&quot;, something that would raise alarms, like a <br/>
parent that refuses to communicate with authorities and isolates <br/>
their children from any contact with others. By presuming this kind <br/>
of positive intent on their part it becomes easier and more <br/>
comfortable to communicate with them; you are no longer trying to <br/>
justify yourself, but rather simply seeking to reassure them. And <br/>
since the person you will be dealing with is likely to have <br/>
relatively little experience with unschooling, they may actually be <br/>
quite fascinated by whatever experiences you would be willing to <br/>
share with them. This then could actually become an experience you <br/>
could look forward to - its an opportunity to practice expressing <br/>
what the philosophy of unschooling is to someone unfamiliar with it, <br/>
and perhaps succeed in bringing one more person into the unschooling <br/>
community. Personally I often begin with the analogy: think of a <br/>
public school classroom being improved by dramatically reducing the <br/>
class sizes, and introducing individualized instruction, while <br/>
providing much greater access to the world and time for uninterrupted <br/>
musing, pondering, and reflection. Put it that way and everyone will <br/>
find it attractive, but seemingly impossible to provide.Then point <br/>
out how similar that is to the kind of learning environment that you <br/>
are attempting to provide for your own children, together perhaps <br/>
with other homeschooling parents. They&#39;re not likely to &quot;get&quot; <br/>
immediately the distinction between teaching and sharing/facilitating <br/>
interests, but you don&#39;t need to bring them quite that far to feel <br/>
that you&#39;ve met a possible friend rather than an adversary.<br/>
I might add that many people who are not unschooling experience the <br/>
word as rather negative and challenging or threatening - I choose to <br/>
explain it by saying that it just means the process of letting go of <br/>
harmful assumptions about education and harmful attitudes toward <br/>
children.<br/>
I very much doubt that this was your main source of anxiety and <br/>
confusion, but by addressing this one issue fully and completely I <br/>
think you may be more able to tune in to the nature of your anxiety <br/>
connected to learning and teaching arithmetic.<br/>
I might add that I once saw on Oprah three adults who had successful <br/>
careers and lives and who were now confessing that they never learned <br/>
how to read. The audience applauded them for finally confessing their <br/>
shame and for somewhat painfully submitting to the process of being <br/>
taught, and happy that they reported making progress. Somehow no one <br/>
saw fit to comment that apparently one can become perfectly <br/>
successful without knowing how to read!<br/>
If your daughter can sing like Madonna and is a good judge of people, <br/>
she can always hire someone else to manage her finances and to do any <br/>
arithmetic that might be necessary. ^_^.<br/>
