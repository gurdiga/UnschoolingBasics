<div id="ygrps-yiv-68793439">OK, Luke, (the 12 year old I&#39;ve been talking about) asked<br/>
 why there were so many black people in Jamaica. I said that<br/>
 I thought it was because during evolution people&#39;s skin<br/>
 color changed according to the climate of where they lived.<br/>
 He then wanted to know why different races had different<br/>
 features like eye shape and nose shape. I said I didn&#39;t know<br/>
 maybe it had to do with climate and food (different crops<br/>
 being abundant)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I googled &quot;Jamaica natives&quot; and got a brief history from Wikipedia. <br/>
You might like to try there.<br/>
<br/>
 But people look different because form follows function.<br/>
<br/>
  People who live in cool climates have paler skin because they need to <br/>
attract as much heat as possible to keep warm. Desert/equatorial people <br/>
have more melanin in their skin to protect them from the harsh rays of <br/>
the sun.<br/>
<br/>
  Eye color, eye set, ear set, hair color/texture, muscle mass, bone <br/>
length/density---all originally due to form following function. Those <br/>
that conformed to what nature required survived and thrived. Those that <br/>
didn&#39;t, died out. Natural selection.<br/>
<br/>
 People can outwit nature sometimes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 But not forever. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Why there are so many blacks in Jamaica: they were slaves imported <br/>
 from Africa to work the fields. Jamaica&#39;s original natives are of South <br/>
American origin.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Indigenous people of Jamaica were Arawak.  They were driven to extinction<br/>
on Jamaica by marauding Spaniards. (and to near extinction elsewhere.) <br/>
When the Brits took Jamaica from Spanish settlers the settlers abandon<br/>
their slaves and left.   Some of Jamaica&#39;s population descended from<br/>
those slaves.  <br/>

Interesting site.<br/>
<br/>
But our ideas of race and racism and prejudice don&#39;t negate that <br/>
certain physical traits evolved through centuries of natural selection <br/>
and isolation.<br/>
