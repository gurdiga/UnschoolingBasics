<div id="ygrps-yiv-307176921">HI, I have a question.  We are in the process of deschooling.  We <br/>
have homeschooled...that is school at home for six years.  I am not <br/>
requiring anything of the children.  They are having fun, but I sense <br/>
they are expecting me to pull up and tell them what to do.  I am <br/>
finding it hard to not say anything to them.  When do you think the <br/>
deschooling has happened and they are on their way Unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
The question is....are you on your way?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m reading you right so feel free to correct me but it sounds like the kids are having fun but you are sensing an underlying restlessness, like they are waiting for the other shoe to drop....and you are not sure how you want to respond to that.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest asking the kids if they feel like planning a garden for the spring, or going to a museum, or seeing a particular movie or going rollerskating.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are sensing the kids need some direction from you, they probably do.  You know them best.  What they don&#39;t need are requirements from you or a curriculum from you.  Particularly as the newness of freedom wears off, kids can kind of find themselves &quot;between things&quot;.....Offering them options that you think might interest them is a good thing.  Just remember the operative words are OFFERING and OPTIONS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618994761">I kind of know what you mean Christy, I am in the same place with <br/>
the &#39;deschooling&#39; only a hectic life has brought me here.  I also <br/>
feel the kids waiting for something to come out of my mouth like, &quot;Ok <br/>
guys lets get back to it&quot; LOL In a way I think it is cute because <br/>
they know they are on borrowed time.  And our hectic schedules are <br/>
finally slowing down, so that means the kids are ~learning~ structure <br/>
of time.  But to there surprise we aren&#39;t gonig to pass out the books <br/>
we are however going to graphed out our floor plans for the house to <br/>
help dad make the repairs to our house after the hurricanes.  And <br/>
when that is done we are going to work on hotbeds in the garden and <br/>
compare the bugs that we find with the bug cards that we have oh and <br/>
eat gummy worms at the same time.  Oh and for math we did make a <br/>
special cookie dough that you can sculpture in shapes and bake and <br/>
then eat.  So my husband and I  enjoyed eating spiders and beehives <br/>
for dessert.  LOL <br/>
So Christy from one newbie to another tell you kids &quot;for today we <br/>
will watch the Discovery Channel, and I want you to write down all <br/>
the up and coming shows that interest you&quot;  that is what I did the <br/>
beginning of this week and my goodness I learned from their mouths <br/>
how to build a solar something or rather, but my son knows all about <br/>
it.  And my daughter has a list of shows that they don&#39;t want to <br/>
miss.  With all this new info I have an idea of what interest my <br/>
children have instead of what ~I~ think they need to know to make <br/>
someone else happy.<br/>
I hope this helps because it sure helped me to put it down on print <br/>
so to speak.  Good luck on your decision. Have a Great Day!<br/>

unschooling.  &quot;Doing Math&quot; by making recipes or<br/>
anything else is not unschooling.  *You* having a list<br/>
of what your famliy will be doing next, and then after<br/>
that, is not unschooling.  <br/>

unschooling--it sounds mean.  Why would it be *cute*<br/>
if your kids weren&#39;t feeling free?<br/>

<br/>
And it&#39;s not always as easy as it sounds! If they aren&#39;t used to <br/>
being able to say no, it may be months before they stop saying no <br/>
just to test you. (Happened with tv and my 4 yr old.) It&#39;s also hard <br/>
on us parents to suddenly just be open to letting the kids set the <br/>
agenda when we&#39;re used to that being our job. Learning to decide <br/>
together what to do takes some practice. They will come up with ideas <br/>
of things to do that may seem too hard or too expensive or something <br/>
and you get to take a deep breath and try to brainstorm ways to make <br/>
it work out. You&#39;ll come up with great ideas of outings that should <br/>
make everyone happy and singing your praises...and instead they&#39;ll <br/>
look at ya like you have two heads and just want to watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can come back here for some much needed encouragement!<br/>
