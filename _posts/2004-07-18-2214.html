<div id="ygrps-yiv-406127697">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
If any of you know a nice homeschooling family, or someone here that <br/>
lives in Birmingham that&#39;s willing to babysit my 7 and 3 year old <br/>
children for 5 days (starting August 30th) from about 9:45am until <br/>
6:15pm, please write me.<br/>
I may possible be attending MAC training up there, and need to take <br/>
my two youngest with me. I&#39;m happy to pay someone to keep my <br/>
youngun&#39;s happy and fed while I work. An unschooling family would be <br/>
AWESEOME!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million!<br/>
Ren</div>
