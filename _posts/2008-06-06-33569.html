<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502492019">Hello group.  Have 2 sons.  6 and 3.  Have tried a few methods.  From a <br/>
strict curriculum to practically none used at all.  Have a question <br/>
about my child having to be evaluated.  How do you find someone that is <br/>
compatible/sympathetic to this method of homeschooling? I don&#39;t want my <br/>
son to be evaluated by a certified teacher that may not &quot;approve&quot; of <br/>
our method of learning.  Any advise? Thank you.</div>
