<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626979775">Just wanted to share something cool. Today was our first visit to the  <br/>
psychologist since we&#39;ve started unschooling. We usually visit once a  <br/>
month to discuss Bre and Josh both, how things are going, some ideas  <br/>
for me to help them, etc. We&#39;ve missed a few months due to my  <br/>
bedrest, having a baby, and her father being ill.<br/>
<br/>
I told her how things are going, she watched the kids for a while,  <br/>
and was very happy for us. She said that she is really excited by the  <br/>
changes just in the past few months. There was a huge change just  <br/>
pulling out to homeschool, but unschooling has made them so much  <br/>
happier, and she can see all the tension is gone, and they are so  <br/>
much happier. We talked a little bit about the schooling, and *she*  <br/>
brought up Holt and some other people who studied schooling during  <br/>
the 70&#39;s. Apparently she has her bs and masters in education, she got  <br/>
them in the 70&#39;s, and she talked about the backlash of the  <br/>
behavioralists after Hold and others talked about developmental  <br/>
stages in learning. She agrees that the way we&#39;re doing it is the way  <br/>
all children should be taught. Yay...I have had so many reservations  <br/>
(internal fears really) about this, and I didn&#39;t want to hear  <br/>
anything negative about it. We talked a lot more about the general  <br/>
movement to accept autistics the way they are, stop trying to stop  <br/>
their behaviors and tics, and just support them in their life. She&#39;s  <br/>
an awesome woman, and I really appreciate her all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we are so happy, and we&#39;re finally living the life we&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to have. We&#39;ve spent the last nine days totally immersed in  <br/>
Chinese New Year....we&#39;ve read all kinds of books, we watched Mulan  <br/>
(the girls idea) and Big Trouble in Little China (Josh&#39;s idea),  the  <br/>
kids made a &#39;chart&#39; of who was born in which year, we went shopping  <br/>
at our favorite asian market and bought a bunch of new things we&#39;ve  <br/>
never had the courage for, we made a huge paper mache dragon, we made  <br/>
kites, tonight my mom came over and taught the girls how to make  <br/>
eggrolls, we had a huge stir fry dinner, we made paper lanterns. It&#39;s  <br/>
been awesome. And the kids blew my parents away with their incredible  <br/>
insight. Josh spent half an hour telling my dad about why the first  <br/>
Chinese compasses pointed south, just on and on. amazing!<br/>

WOW!! That is so cool. Danielle was just talking about their Chinese<br/>
New Year shopping and fun today over at the AU list and I felt so<br/>
inspired. And now this. Cool.<br/>
Last year we had so much fun preparing for the Chinese New Year and<br/>
this time around we forgot all about it.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed reading about all the joyful activities. Awesome.<br/>

Knights&quot;--they are so much fun and filled with connections to all kinds <br/>
of different things!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Chinese food is Sam&#39;s favorite! He *loves* fried dumplings/ pot <br/>
stickers, so he was definitely up for going to do dim sum in DC.<br/>
<br/>
The girls were bummed that we&#39;d be missing the Chinese New Year <br/>
celebration at our favorite restaurant where we used to live that one of <br/>
the local unschoolers used to organize. So, I figured it was time to <br/>
shake things up a bit and start some new traditions.<br/>
