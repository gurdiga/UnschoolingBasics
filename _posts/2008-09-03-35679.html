Thanks in advance<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may be something my daughter would be interested in.  I&#39;ll talk <br/>
with her and we&#39;ll figure out the friend code thing.  We haven&#39;t wifi-<br/>
ed much yet with our animal crossing games.  Email me privately and we <br/>
can chat about it.  <br/>
<br/>
She is also looking for other places to chat with other kids so if <br/>
anyone else has any ideas of safe online places please let me know.  <br/>
She has a clubpenguin account and would welcome new friends.  We are <br/>
still trying to figure out runescape but we&#39;ll get there.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Lynda</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202956882">Hi Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
My 10-yr-old son does not have this game, but I looked it up on Amazon  <br/>
and it looks so fun we ordered it!  Maybe after he&#39;s gotten familiar  <br/>
with it, he could play with your son?  He would love to - we just will  <br/>
be a bit delayed waiting for it to arrive and then gain some  <br/>
familiarity.  If your son is still interested in exchanging friend  <br/>
codes in about a month or so - please email us again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834708880">I thought kids had to be near each other for that to work... do the<br/>
DS&#39;s hook into regular wi-fi networks so far-flung kids can play?<br/>

I&#39;m trying to be a cool mom, but I&#39;m getting left in the dust! :-)<br/>

My daughter doesn&#39;t have that game... yet.. I&#39;ve heard great things about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656103963">You can connect over wi-fi with the DS. From the UK we&#39;ve played Animal Crossing with folks in Iowa. <br/>
<br/>
There is a list of friends codes through the unschooling gamers list: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/</a><br/>
