<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771211318">Hi, all! I have a friend in Canada, who is really interested in unschooling. <br/>
Her kids are in school now, but she is done with the BS and is ready to try <br/>
alternative methods. I am not sure how unschooly she will become, or wants to <br/>
become, but I know she is very interested and has ordered The Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook :) I asked her if I could help her find anyone near her - she has <br/>
joined up with some Canadian yahoo groups for homeschooling, but is also <br/>
interested in knowing some people in person that unschool. Here is her info:<br/>
<br/>
We live in Gatineau, Quebec,Â which is 2 minutes from the bridge into downtown <br/>
Ottawa, Ontario. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows anyone around tha area, that might be willing to meet up, or <br/>
could tell her of any unschooling in that area, that&#39;d be great. Thanks in <br/>
advance! <br/>
<br/>
Karen <br/>
