<div id="ygrps-yiv-766281380">Have you tried alternatives such as soy and rice milk?  There are lots<br/>
of milk-free treats like Newman-O cookies and snacks.  What kinds of<br/>
milk foods is he craving?<br/>
<br/>
When I found out I was allergic to dairy it took years to switch over.<br/>
Now if I eat dairy I pay for it in chills and GI upsets.  After he&#39;s<br/>
had some &quot;detox&quot; he&#39;ll be able to feel the effects of eating dairy.<br/>
But try to introduce new dairy-free treats and have the whole family<br/>
in on it.   Pizza and cheeseburgers are hard but there are options out<br/>
there, it just takes time to introduce and get used to it.  It&#39;s<br/>
easier not to crave milk when one isn&#39;t feeling deprived by having<br/>
more choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597346869">Let me restate that last sentence, ha --<br/>
<br/>
Having more choices in food and treats helps bring down the cravings<br/>
for dairy.<br/>
<br/>
Milk is a soother and filler of sorts.  Oreos can be replaced by<br/>
Newman-O&#39;s, bowls of fruits for sweets,  Tofutti ice cream for regular<br/>
ice cream, and so on.  For us it&#39;s rice milk for cereal and the option<br/>
of adding cheese to any meal.  Bread can be milk-free as well.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t found any cheese replacements without whey yet tho, you might<br/>
want to try looking at vegweb.com.  I need to do that too! :)<br/>
<br/>
It helps if the whole family is on board as much as they can with the<br/>
diet change, at least until your son is able to understand the<br/>
difference.  I&#39;m sure others have more suggestions tho.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120667304">We are dairy free... I would check into cheese by<br/>
Galaxy International Foods. We do the rice vegan<br/>
american cheese slices (just for grilled cheese). Of<br/>
course, soy is out for us as my son cannot tolerate<br/>
that either.. turns him into a hyper tasmanian devil.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400615181">My son is allergic to cow dairy but tolerates goat and sheep&#39;s milk<br/>
cheeses etc just fine.   Our allergist told us that the protein in<br/>
goat&#39;s milk is the most similar to the protein in human milk.   My son<br/>
also LOVED milk and drank LOTS of milk until we figured out his<br/>
allergy.   He threw up at least 3 times a day, didn&#39;t sleep and ended<br/>
up in the emergency room multiple times with huge asthma attacks.   He<br/>
was 3 at the time.   When we discovered he was authentically allergic<br/>
we took steps to find alternatives for him (he is also allergic to<br/>
tree nuts, egg yolks and soy)  it was hard to find things... soy milk<br/>
is out, almond milk is out...but he loves rice milk so that works for<br/>
us.  We changed to sheep&#39;s milk cheeses and goat cheeses (we all love<br/>
them!).   I use applesauce in place of egg yolks in cooking.... he<br/>
eats egg white omelets for breakfast etc.   When there are times when<br/>
there isn&#39;t an alternative we discuss what&#39;s in it and what it does to<br/>
him (all of his reactions are respiratory and have gotten milder<br/>
through the years...he is almost 7 now)  I allow him to make the<br/>
decision to have a little bit of cake or ice cream at a party and we<br/>
immediately take allergy meds to alleviate any adverse reactions.   He<br/>
knows how it makes his body feel and he will not eat more than a<br/>
little because he does know that.  Recently he had a cookie at a class<br/>
... took one bite and discovered it had walnuts... immediately he<br/>
grabbed my hand and told me the cookie had nuts ...he held the cookie<br/>
in his mouth until he made it to a sink where he spit it out and<br/>
rinsed his mouth and washed his hands... he was not upset or afraid<br/>
just knew that nuts are dangerous for him.   I think if I walked<br/>
around policing his life it would make him angry and anxious.  I try<br/>
to make it a partnership of keeping him safe and healthy.  I find<br/>
sometimes when we are at a party etc he will ask if something has<br/>
milk, nuts, soy, or eggs .. the hostess is always surprised that he<br/>
knows so much about his allergies and takes the responsibility for his<br/>
own health.   I get really annoyed when someone comes to me to &quot;check&quot;<br/>
that he is accurate or tries to talk him into having something that he<br/>
has refused on the basis of his allergies... UGH.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146143387">Goat&#39;s milk has lactose, too. So does human milk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lactose intolerant and so is my oldest daughter. The reason goat&#39;s  <br/>
milk works better for some people is that it is more digestible so the  <br/>
bacteria don&#39;t get as much chance to have a feast on the undigested  <br/>
stuff down there in the small intestines. (It is partying bacteria  <br/>
that create the gas that causes the bloating and discomfort.)<br/>
<br/>
Lactaid doesn&#39;t help me much (I am SEVERELY lactose intolerant - there  <br/>
are degrees, it isn&#39;t all or nothing). But there is another similar  <br/>
pill, called &quot;Digestive Advantage - Lactose Intolerance Therapy&quot; that  <br/>
does work very very well. I only have to take one in the morning and I  <br/>
can get by, even have a small frozen yogurt or cream in my coffee. I  <br/>
still wouldn&#39;t drink a whole glass of milk - that would overload me.  <br/>
These are available at regular drug stores and grocery stores (Ralphs  <br/>
carries them).<br/>
<br/>
Milk protein allergy or sensitivity is different than lactose  <br/>
intolerance. Lactose intolerance means our bodies don&#39;t produce  <br/>
(enough or any) lactase, the enzyme that metaboliizes lactose (the  <br/>
sugar in dairy products). Bacteria flourish in the small intestine  <br/>
with all that undigested sugar sitting there.<br/>
<br/>
Lactose is an additive in LOTS of foods. Trying to totally avoid it is  <br/>
very very difficult - which is why I take the Digestive Advantage pill  <br/>
every day. Otherwise, I might inadvertently eat something with &quot;milk  <br/>
solids&quot; or &quot;whey&quot; or &quot;lactoserum&quot; or &quot;modified milk ingredients&quot; and  <br/>
then be miserable. It is often added to processed meats like lunch  <br/>
meats, margarines, breads, dried fruit, medications, protein bars, and  <br/>
almost any kind of processed foods.<br/>
<br/>
So - my youngest daughter knows a lot about nutrition and digestion.  <br/>
She picked up a lot of it at the time I was just figuring out what was  <br/>
wrong with me, getting tests, freaking out thinking I had stomach  <br/>
cancer or something. And, at the same time, she was very involved with  <br/>
horses - which have lots of their own digestive issues. She even made  <br/>
a cool model of a horses digestive system to enter in the youth fair  <br/>
one year.<br/>
<br/>
And now she&#39;s 17 and her boyfriend says he is lactose intolerant, but  <br/>
she&#39;s explained to him (and his mom) the difference between lactose  <br/>
intolerance and milk protein allergy (which is what he has - when he  <br/>
accidentally eats anything with dairy, his lips start to swell, his  <br/>
throat swells, he vomits, he has breathing problems).<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and last thing (I promise) - most people become less and less  <br/>
able to metabolize lactose as they get older. Lots of people can&#39;t  <br/>
really digest it well after about age 5 or so, but the symptoms are  <br/>
pretty minimal - gas, a little discomfort, loose stool. But if a kid  <br/>
complains of discomfort in the lower stomach, especially if you can  <br/>
hear it &quot;bubbling&quot; - you might suspect that they are having trouble  <br/>
digesting dairy. I cannot TELL you how much more healthy and energetic  <br/>
I felt when I figured out what the problem was and got off the dairy.  <br/>
Part of that was just sleeping better at night. So, I don&#39;t doubt that  <br/>
behavior problems can be associated with milk consumption, even when  <br/>
it is just a mild lactose intolerance.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be lactose intolerant because I mistakenly thought  <br/>
it was most people with Asian background that had this problem. I was  <br/>
wrong.<br/>

Here&#39;s a great article on it:<br/>

Obviously, it depends on the person but I&#39;ve heard many stories of<br/>
people with lactose intolerance being able to drink raw milks. The<br/>
enzymes that break down the proteins are also available unlike<br/>
