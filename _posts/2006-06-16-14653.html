<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617126548">~~Someone asked me if my daughter wanted to do drugs would I just say <br/>
yes? While there are certainly plenty of 14 yos taking drugs -- <br/>
though probably not many asking if they can ;-) -- the question <br/>
assumes that because it&#39;s possible for any 14 yo that its just as <br/>
likely for my 14 yo.~~<br/>
 <br/>
Okay so I have been pondering this question a bit because my 11 yo seems<br/>
intrigued by alcohol and drug use already (which is prolly from the hype of<br/>
&#39;just say no&quot; and other anti-drug commercials).  I don&#39;t view all drugs as<br/>
inherently bad...of course most synthetic drugs are pretty devastating yet I<br/>
am trying to mentally prepare myself for *if* the time comes that he acts on<br/>
that intrigue by wanting to experiment.  I know the answers are fairly<br/>
subjective since he hasn&#39;t talked about trying any certain drugs<br/>
specifically (except alcohol) but I am thinking the best route will be the<br/>
same route we take with most everything, upfront and honest discussion.  I<br/>
am wondering if the issue has come up in &quot;veteran unschooler&quot; homes and how<br/>
they addressed it?<br/>

<br/>
 More hypothetical than subjective! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 But I think you&#39;re on the right path. Open, honest communication.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I am wondering if the issue has come up in &quot;veteran unschooler&quot; homes <br/>
and how<br/>
 they addressed it?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I drank as a young adult. A lot. I drink very little now. Wine & beer <br/>
occasionally. I&#39;ve never smoked anything---unusual for my age (46 in <br/>
August). My husband, Ben, smoked pot in high school and drank a bit in <br/>
college. He also drinks occasionally now.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d love to say that all unschoolers stay away from alcohol and drugs. <br/>
But I&#39;m a realist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 But it can look different in our homes than in mainstream homes.<br/>
<br/>
 When Cameron, at 14, started smoking pot, we had to think a bit! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Ben was more alarmed than I was. I think he still is. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron (now 18) is very comfortable talking to me about anything. I <br/>
know a lot of parents say that---or at least like to think that. I <br/>
*know* it. We have some VERY serious and in-depth talks about drugs and <br/>
sex and---everything.<br/>
<br/>
  I know teens experiment. I did. My friends did. My concern was not <br/>
with the experimentation, but with the safety issue.<br/>
<br/>
  I wanted Cameron to know that I knew I couldn&#39;t stop him from smoking <br/>
or drinking. And I also wanted him to know that his safety was the most <br/>
important thing to me. I didn&#39;t want him buying cheap, dangerous stuff <br/>
 from people he didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t want him driving under the <br/>
influence of anything. I didn&#39;t want him riding with someone who was <br/>
DUI. I wanted him to be smart about what he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
  He did a lot of research on marijuana and hemp. (We all now own hemp <br/>
bags and hats and stuff. &lt;g&gt;) He attended NORML meetings (although I <br/>
suggested he not sign anything there). He found people who grew organic <br/>
pot. He did NOT smoke and drive: he called us to pick him up (which we <br/>
did, happily and thankfully) or made travel arrangements ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
  We discussed the illegalities and how it could jeopardize our <br/>
unschooling. We discussed not smoking in the house or in front of his <br/>
younger brother. We discussed the ridiculous expense!<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s pretty much quit now. He says it makes him feel bad the next <br/>
day---I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a hangover or what it is---but it&#39;s now not <br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
  I think the honesty, trust, and respect in our relationship is <br/>
immeasurable and incredibly refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
  Do I wish he&#39;d never smoked at all? Maybe, but he learned a lot about <br/>
a lot of things because he did.<br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;d rather have that open, honest relationship with a (temporary) <br/>
pot-head than an estranged, resentful child who had never smoked at all.<br/>

learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197261491">I expected my kids to experiment - they haven&#39;t much. My 21 year old  <br/>
has drunk alcohol a few times. Two times, I think. But maybe another  <br/>
time or two. Once was at a beach campout with homeschoolers and the  <br/>
kids had a small water bottle with about an ounce of vodka and the  <br/>
rest filled with orange juice and they passed that around among about  <br/>
12 kids! So - maybe a couple of swallows is all she got. She didn&#39;t  <br/>
like it - but it wasn&#39;t enough to have any effect on her, anyway. The  <br/>
most recent time was at a college party - she decided to try it - and  <br/>
she got very sick and threw up.<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t tried pot or other drugs - doesn&#39;t intend to. She&#39;s into  <br/>
the idea that the purpose of life is to expand our brainpower, to  <br/>
learn, to be fully conscious and experience every bit of life -- and  <br/>
the idea of drugs and alcohol dulling her senses is not attractive.<br/>
<br/>
My other two, 18 and 15, are pretty much in the same frame of mind.  <br/>
They don&#39;t quite understand why it is attractive to other kids.<br/>
<br/>
They all have lots of friends who smoke pot and drink alcohol. They  <br/>
go to parties where there is alcohol. They tend to find other  <br/>
nondrinkers to hang out with, though, don&#39;t stay at parties if they  <br/>
are the only nondrinkers (because it isn&#39;t that much fun when other  <br/>
people drink too much) and they absolutely never ever get in the car  <br/>
with someone who has had even a small drink. We were hit by a drunk  <br/>
driver a few years ago and it was a traumatic experience - and now  <br/>
they think people who drink at all should not drive.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve picked up my kids from parties at 2 or 3 in the morning - MANY  <br/>
times, because they didn&#39;t want to get a ride home from anybody  <br/>
there, not being sure who had had a drink and who hadn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve picked up their friends who were drunk or stoned and needed  <br/>
rides home, too. They all know they can call me and I&#39;ll cheerfully  <br/>
get them - talk happily on the way home - not make them feel guilty  <br/>
or anything.<br/>
<br/>
We got to this point by talking about it all very openly - I always  <br/>
said that I totally understood why people do drugs or drink, that it  <br/>
feels good, helps people relax, releases inhibitions, etc. ! I never  <br/>
criticize other people for it. But we just don&#39;t do it at our house,  <br/>
ever. No alcohol around. Lots of people have told us, over the years,  <br/>
that if we parents are so anti-alcohol that we are complete  <br/>
abstainers, our kids will not learn to drink responsibly, etc. Like  <br/>
we should drink, even though we don&#39;t want to, so that our kids could  <br/>
learn how to drink moderately.   We didn&#39;t. I think alcohol is the  <br/>
cause of so MUCH unhappiness in the world - I wish it would  <br/>
disappear. I don&#39;t want it regulated or prohibited,though, because i  <br/>
don&#39;t feel a need to impose my preferences on the rest of the world.<br/>
