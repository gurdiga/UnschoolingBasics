<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052980565">Mysteriously enough, my family is going. :)<br/>
 <br/>
I just got back from a visit to the new hotel, and I&#39;m really excited.  <br/>
There&#39;s lots of good space, the hotel is nice and they&#39;re friendly. If you need <br/>
 a relaxing break, the hotel is adjacent to a large nature preserve open <br/>
for  hiking. We have a lot of fun things planned. <br/>
 <br/>
If you are planning to come, Please make hotel reservations soon! We have  <br/>
almost filled our block, and I may be able to increase it soon, but the <br/>
closer  we come the more possible it is that we&#39;ll run out of rooms.<br/>
 <br/>
Please come! It&#39;s a great way to connect with other unschoolers.<br/>
