<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257554506">Pardon me if this is choppy, I&#39;m exhausted but I have been wanting to post<br/>
for days now!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Brief intro..<br/>
<br/>
I have a 10 yo DD; 4 yo DS; and 3 yo DD. I have mostly been a SAHM since<br/>
motherhood. Always wanted to home school because I thought kids should have<br/>
a choice about what they learned about when I was a kid. The opportunity<br/>
came when my oldest was in 3rd grade. I had spent a lot of time researching<br/>
about it and was SO excited to learn about US! It complemented my spiritual<br/>
journey and my search for the meaning of life.  :-)   Anyhoo, we did<br/>
deschooling for a semester but she went back to PS when my husband and I<br/>
separated for a year. I became a licensed child care provider while we were<br/>
separated since I love kids and I could stay home with mine. I still am and<br/>
was planning on doing it in a more US way but now I am starting to think it<br/>
will take away more from my family than it will give them. Still in limbo<br/>
about that one. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Challenge<br/>
<br/>
Now my oldest is out of school again (parents back together) and we are<br/>
looking at how to implement the US principles in all areas of our lives. We<br/>
decided to eliminate bedtimes and our life has been turned upside down; I am<br/>
so tired I can&#39;t think straight and the house is in disarray.  Sometimes<br/>
finding clothes to wear is an ordeal. I feel so ignorant. I have read so<br/>
much about parenting and been involved in early childhood education and I am<br/>
not always sure what feels right anymore! I know there is no right way to do<br/>
this, but I do know there is a right way to do it for each of my kids.  I<br/>
feel lost about everything!! Dang, it was so much easier reading what the<br/>
experts had to say and taking what felt right:-) Not that I can&#39;t use any of<br/>
that info, however, this is absolutely going out on a limb. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ironically, I feel like I am being a worse parent. Did I initiate too much<br/>
all at once for my younger ones? Are they confused without a routine? All<br/>
the kids are acting more aggressively because we are all so tired. Thus, I<br/>
am not exactly in a state to be much of a role model these days. I&#39;m<br/>
practicing compassion for us all at best, and letting the guilt pass through<br/>
me at worst. I&#39;m most concerned about my young ones.  I need hope and to<br/>
focus on what is possible rather than what is in front of me right now. I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear about any tips for helping this transition go more smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for being there! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long has it been since you let go of bedtimes? There&#39;s going to <br/>
be a transitional period while each child finds his/her own natural <br/>
rhythem. With three that&#39;s going to be complicated, too, b/c if one <br/>
kid is naturally more of a night-owl another kid might want to stay <br/>
up, too, even though s/he&#39;s tired.<br/>
<br/>
Let house and laundry go in the meantime, or enlist help from a <br/>
friend to straighten up once a week. It&#39;s *going* to be crazy for <br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking with the kids about what tired &quot;feels like&quot;? I give <br/>
Mo lots of information about that - I&#39;m tired so I&#39;m grumpy, can&#39;t <br/>
think, don&#39;t like loud noises... its only within the last six months <br/>
that she&#39;s &quot;caught on&quot; and been able to articulate &quot;I&#39;m tired&quot;. <br/>
Fortunately for *me* she&#39;s one of those kids who pretty much just <br/>
passes out when she&#39;s tired, doesn&#39;t try to keep herself up unless <br/>
we&#39;re at a friend&#39;s house or something, so I haven&#39;t had to deal <br/>
with that issue.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its hard to be the best you can be when you&#39;re tired. That goes for <br/>
kids *and* parents! Are there times you can get them all to watch a <br/>
movie so you can nap? That might not be possible if you are taking <br/>
care of others&#39; kids too. Are you still doing that? Can you cut back <br/>
or take a few weeks off (maybe for &quot;the holidays&quot;)? Can you and dh <br/>
stagger your schedules a bit so you can get some sleep when he&#39;s <br/>
around? <br/>
<br/>
I work part-time from home and I&#39;ve definately found that cutting <br/>
back on my work has helped me be a better mom - my mantra is &quot;the <br/>
important part of WAHM is Mom&quot;. I also have work that I can juggle <br/>
around my kid, most of the time - something that I can see being <br/>
more of a challenge with childcare. <br/>
<br/>
Compassion is good - be sure to have some for yourself! This is a <br/>
Big Transition. Maybe it was too much at once for the little ones - <br/>
but going back might undermine trust. So look for ways to help them <br/>
figure out what their needs are. Offer them opportunities to snuggle <br/>
or some other quiet activity when you can see they are getting <br/>
tired. Notice what they are eating, too - Mo gets &quot;bouncy&quot; about an <br/>
hour after having protein, so I don&#39;t offer her any later in the <br/>
evening. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so tired I can&#39;t think straight and the house is in disarray. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is a problem for me as well.  My children are 17, 8, 7, 3, and 1.  My husband works about 12-14 hours a day and is very tired when he comes home.  He has requested that the kids have a bedtime because he is exhausted.  Right now we are all sleeping in one room at a relative&#39;s house so there is no way to really separate everyone.  How do I handle this?  The children are pretty loud and active in the evening, even after a full day of activities.  There is lots of screaming and yelling and such.<br/>
   <br/>
  What can I do to honor my husband&#39;s request for quiet, while honoring my children&#39;s needs to follow their own schedules?  And how do I get rest myself?  Taking a nap with so many young children is nearly not possible (the 17 yr old is my stepdaughter and is in ps).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more helpful to eliminate arbitrary bedtimes than  <br/>
bedtimes all together.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to your kids about what they&#39;re feeling. They&#39;re undoubtedly  <br/>
feeling the negative effects too and would like a solution. So talk  <br/>
about solutions that you could try out. If you involve them, they&#39;ll  <br/>
feel part of the solution rather than part of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
One solution can be a wind-down time and routine to help them  <br/>
transition to sleep. Baths. Reading in bed. Listening to a story or  <br/>
music on CD in their rooms.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about things they can do quietly in their rooms or in bed so  <br/>
they&#39;re going *to* something rather than being dragged away from  <br/>
something fun for something boring like sleep ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Work together to find a solution rather than picking one and imposing  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did I initiate too much<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. It&#39;s better to say yes more than to eliminate all the  <br/>
rules at once.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rather than looking at it in terms of rules, look at it in terms of  <br/>
principles and thoughtfulness of  others.<br/>
<br/>
Being able to sleep should be a given. Approach it with that attitude  <br/>
and ask the kids how you can help Dad get that. Talk about what&#39;s  <br/>
preventing him from sleeping. Talk about *why* he needs to sleep for  <br/>
the younger ones. (While it may be worst case scenario, no sleep can  <br/>
mean he can&#39;t do his job and he&#39;ll get fired and that means no money  <br/>
coming in. I wouldn&#39;t use it as a scare tactic to frighten them into  <br/>
obedience but it *is* reality. It also means he&#39;s more likely to be  <br/>
grumpy and not want to do things with them.)<br/>
<br/>
Talk about their needs too and how the needs are clashing. Than talk  <br/>
about solutions, especially solutions that help kids deal with the  <br/>
need to be wound up at night. Don&#39;t think in terms of what to do (eg,  <br/>
what punishment to mete out) when someone is loud. Think in terms of  <br/>
what everyone can do *before* bed so they don&#39;t feel the need to be  <br/>
loud when it&#39;s time to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Assume the kids are doing the best they can with the understanding  <br/>
and skills they have. They aren&#39;t choosing deliberately to prevent  <br/>
Dad from sleeping. They just don&#39;t know how to deal with all that &#39;s  <br/>
going on inside them to stop it or prevent it or deal with it before  <br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is loud, it should be taken for granted, just generally  <br/>
accepted -- this is a mindset you want to work towards -- that they  <br/>
need to be quiet. Assume they&#39;re just forgetting. Assume they&#39;ve just  <br/>
been overwhelmed by something inside that needs to burst out. Talk  <br/>
about ways to *prevent* the need to be restless. Talk about  <br/>
techniques on how to handle the feelings or rechannel the feelings  <br/>
into quiet activities so they don&#39;t come bursting out in ways that  <br/>
will keep Dad from sleeping. If two kids are going at each other it  <br/>
should be seen as a given that they should move away from each other.  <br/>
Not as a punishment but because that&#39;s one way to help Dad get the  <br/>
sleep he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve thrown a bunch of words at it since I&#39;m not confident I&#39;m  <br/>
explaining that shift in attitude well. Hope some of them help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you waiting for your children to just drop from pure exhaustion or<br/>
are you helping them read their body cues so that they can ease into<br/>
sleep?  You still have two very young children who may not understand<br/>
how to realize that they are tired.  Do you see their signs of being<br/>
tired?  If so it is ok to encourage them towards sleep.  The same as<br/>
if you saw your 3 yo doing the pee-pee dance it is ok to encourage<br/>
them towards the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how elimination of bedtimes has to do with a house being<br/>
in disarray.  What are *you* doing all this time?  Find what is<br/>
important to you and solve that.  If it is a laundry thing, find a way<br/>
to tackle it.  If it is a clutter thing, then eliminate some of those<br/>
things that get in your way.  Remember that all these things happening<br/>
are choices.  You choose to do laundry or not.  You choose to do<br/>
dishes or not.<br/>

Yes.<br/>

 Are they confused without a routine?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It might not be lack of routine, but a lack of foundation.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re newly walking---toddlers, in a sense. They are used to walking <br/>
on concrete. SUDDENLY, while they were sleeping, you replaced the <br/>
concrete with a blow-up mattress---they&#39;re bouncing around like CRAZY! <br/>
Can&#39;t get their footing. Falling every second or third step. Banged <br/>
heads and sore knees. It&#39;s fun, but it can hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally you put the air mattress on the floor with no air in it. Then <br/>
every day add a little more air. In no time, they are bouncing and <br/>
almost FLYING! through the air.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it the way you did, with the mattress all blown up, but the <br/>
&quot;figure it out time&quot; will be longer, more frustrating, and wrought with <br/>
bumps and bruises.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can let the air in a little at a time. Saying &quot;yes&quot; more (not <br/>
all at once). Set them up for success, not failure! As they get their <br/>
&quot;sea legs,&quot; you give them a little more and a little more until it&#39;s <br/>
natural as---well, walking! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006140887">Thank you to all who replied to my post. I would have loved to be more<br/>
responsive, but our computer crashed so we were offline for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
I had wanted to get some examples of concrete things to do that others had<br/>
tried for calming down, perhaps some specific books about sleeping, etc to<br/>
recommend . Of course, there is always getting a snack, bath, teeth, and<br/>
books. But since they had already come to associate those things with &quot;bed<br/>
time,&quot; I was looking for neutral activities and well thought out guidelines<br/>
so to speak. Now that I&#39;m a bit more rested, it&#39;s plain to see that I didn&#39;t<br/>
do enough research first. I had read Unprocessed Child and went a little<br/>
gung ho. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t paint the whole picture, because there were other factors as<br/>
well, of course. My 3 yo would go to bed, although she stayed up longer than<br/>
before. But my son (almost 5) did not want to go to bed at all. I was<br/>
talking about listening to our bodies and how they tell us when we are<br/>
tired. I figured maybe it was because he has had an issue with not being<br/>
able to do things his big sister can, and he just wanted to experience the<br/>
power of staying up. So I let him experience that but it was taking a toll<br/>
on all of us. My oldest (10) is used to time with me after the younger ones<br/>
when to sleep, so she was waiting up longer than usual. So I still had to<br/>
get up early and the only rested one was my 3 yo. (That&#39;s why my house was<br/>
messed up, I put all my attention on staying with them to prevent battles<br/>
from breaking out.) Then there is my husband. He agrees with me about the<br/>
principles and concepts, but hasn&#39;t read much about unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
And he was baffled and tired. I have to get him credit though, he has been a<br/>
trooper considering he knew less of what to expect than I did!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we did have to tell my son, it is time to go to sleep so we can rest well<br/>
and wake up happy. That we needed more sleep and that&#39;s why we were cranky,<br/>
etc. He has opened up more to reading books; he had just wanted to watch tv.<br/>
So we live and learn and are journeying. Thanks for helping us on our<br/>
journey!<br/>
