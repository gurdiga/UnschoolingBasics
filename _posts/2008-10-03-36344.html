<div id="ygrps-yiv-91984315">We did Star Wars.? My kids got really into watching the &quot;making of&quot; dvd&#39;s for everything they watch...now, when something scary or unreal happens, even my 4 year old will mention that they must be using some sort of special effects and will say how cool it is.? Maybe start there?? Yoda scared my 6 y/o until he watched the making of movies, and Dobby (sp) is the only thing he&#39;s ever had nightmares about...and now he insists on watching those parts of HP because he understands the animation and special effects.? Have you explained to Ethan that the filmakers and screen writers WANT us to feel that way for those short periods of time?? Explain that the fear or whatever feeling comes up is ok and help him process it.? Turn it off to talk about it, or leave it on and talk about it, maybe that would help?? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788276809">Megan (7) gets scared very easily.  One of her favorite non-animated movies is Spaceballs.  She also likes Star Wars (I think she&#39;s only seen the first one all the way through).<br/>
<br/>
Ghostbusters didn&#39;t work for her either.  I don&#39;t think she made it past the library ghost. <br/>
<br/>
Can you fast forward some scenes for him?  Megan loves dinosaurs and has seen parts of Jurassic Park.  It is one of my favorite movies, so I know what is coming.  We just cover her eyes (her request) and fast forward past the scary stuff.  She has seen the dragons in the Harry Potter movie (she loves dragons), but not any other part of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895971283">I know with my oldest son Jake (10), animated movies are scarier for him<br/>
than nonanimated ones. We do talk with him as he needs it but he loved Star<br/>
Wars(even episode 3) and was not scared. He seems to not enjoy the suspense<br/>
in lots of movies, it is what freaks him out. Having the space to run away<br/>
at times and then run back to watch more helps him a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rather than the goal of watching a whole movie straight through, make  <br/>
the goal to watch a bit until he feels uncomfortable. Put him in the  <br/>
driver&#39;s seat. Let him fast forward, stop, take a break, set the  <br/>
movie aside until next year. Do reassure  him that it&#39;s perfectly  <br/>
fine with you.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of watching during the day is good. But if he wants to watch  <br/>
at night, maybe don&#39;t make the movie the plan for the evening. Make  <br/>
some other activity the plan (or a movie or show you know he&#39;s  <br/>
comfortable with) and then watch a bit of a live action movie before  <br/>
the other activity. (You don&#39;t need a plan for the evening, of  <br/>
course, but he might be the type who likes plans but then feels a bit  <br/>
trapped by a plan and doesn&#39;t know how to bail if there&#39;s nothing  <br/>
else to fall back on.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546365699">Those movies are a lot of tension. Are there live action films he might enjoy that aren&#39;t so tense? Things like Whale Rider or The Cave of Yellow Dog or Bedknobs and Broomsticks or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (which does have tension, but it&#39;s slower and doesn&#39;t build so high) or 7 Brides for 7 Brothers or Oklahoma or Grease or, or, or.... There is a rhythm to movies and it helps to be able to anticipate that rhythm. If you start with less <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also really cool to be able to pause and walk away. Maybe when you feel his tension growing, suggest stopping the movie for a bit and making popcorn and drinks and moving for a few minutes away from the movie. You be the one to pause the film, don&#39;t always wait for him to do it, particularly if this is some sort of challenge to his self image. Do other things during the movie. Play a board game, play with hama beads or lego or something else so that the movie isn&#39;t the only focus. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mo has some strategies for watching movies she finds scary. One is <br/>
to watch it in another language - sometimes with subtitles, <br/>
sometimes not. Another is to turn the sound waaaaaaaay down, since <br/>
part of what creates tension in movies is the music and sound <br/>
effects. Another is to watch the movie out of sequence, which is <br/>
easiest with dvds - she&#39;ll go to the scene menu and choose a picture <br/>
that looks interesting. Another strategy she has is to look at any <br/>
extras, play any related games, watch lots of previews and *then* <br/>
try one of her other strategies. <br/>

They like to hear what other kids, especially other unschoolers, do <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157223262">My first suggestion would be to widen your thinking about what you<br/>
assume he will freak out about.... I have a 7 yr old that gets freaked<br/>
out by Halloweentown but sits happily through all the Harry Potters,<br/>
Lord of the Rings, Star Wars etc!!   I have a hard time predicting<br/>
what might scare or freak him out versus what actually does!  <br/>
Sometimes things that seem very similar to me affect him<br/>
differently... I wonder if looking at some of the movie review<br/>
websites might be helpful if he is able to articulate what exactly<br/>
bothered him about the movie.  My son can not watch someone else throw<br/>
up in a movie... even if they are discreet or totally fake it just<br/>
sends him into the gags!!   Also aliens make him really nervous and<br/>
scared!   He loves Indiana Jones but we did not see the last one after<br/>
his sister reported that aliens were involved... he&#39;s had some time to<br/>
digest that information and is considering trying to watch it soon.  <br/>
 I make sure that he knows going into any movie that if he gets scared<br/>
and wants to opt out that is fine with no judgment.  Sometimes he will<br/>
come and cuddle his way through something that scares him a little and<br/>
we talk about it and offer to stop the movie and he decides what he<br/>
wants to do.   Also... Ghost Busters freaks me out but my son thinks<br/>
it&#39;s hilarious so I am with your son on that one! HA!   You might try<br/>
some movies like Beethoven (about a bunch of St Bernards that a family<br/>
owns), some of the older Disney movies that are people but funny<br/>
stories, Hoot, Holes, Home Alone, Nim&#39;s Island, I can&#39;t think of more<br/>
right now but maybe if you go with some that are funny and have some<br/>
level of suspense he will get his need for more mature movies met but<br/>
not be frightened or freaked out.   If I think of more I will email more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559031843">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Larkin (only 3.5, but some of her techniques might be<br/>
relevant) has been very into fear as a concept for the last six months<br/>
or so. She has never been willing to go into another part of the house<br/>
alone due to fear (she will occasionally try if it will be a few<br/>
seconds before I can go with her and will come running back<br/>
immediately saying she heard a a noise that sounded like a very large<br/>
animal, or whatever). She is amazingly social, however, and I think<br/>
that may play as big a role in that particular behavior as anything<br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she started being *really* interested in &quot;scary&quot; books and<br/>
movies, and it seems to me that this is part of how she is working out<br/>
her own fear issues. For a while, she always had the mute button under<br/>
her finger the first time she watched a movie, and that seemed to make<br/>
all the difference in scary parts. If it was still too much for her,<br/>
she would hide under a blanket and ask one of us to tell her when that<br/>
part was over. The wizard duel scene in &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot; comes to<br/>
mind. Usually by the third time she watched she wouldn&#39;t even bother<br/>
muting it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
As time goes on, she is more and more interested in movies with brave<br/>
characters (especially kids) rather than movies that are just kind of<br/>
scary. Her latest favorite is &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; and I have to say<br/>
that I agree. :) The main characters come up against all sorts of<br/>
potentially freaky situations and usually plunge ahead roaring only to<br/>
discover most scary seeming things are quite benign, or even friendly.<br/>
I&#39;m a big Miazaki fan in general, but this one definitely seemed to be<br/>
exactly what Larkin needed right now.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now we&#39;re starting to run into trouble when Larkin wants to<br/>
watch something &quot;scary&quot; and it is too much for her little brother,<br/>
Finn (1.5). Thank goodness he still naps!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are our experiences... I&#39;ve also told Larkin anecdotes<br/>
about other unschooled kids as Meredith mentions and it does sometimes<br/>
work much better than my personal experiences. :)<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I believe the issue is that he&#39;s the one who wants to watch them. I&#39;ve <br/>
gone through that Mo a few times - she&#39;ll see one scene or fall in love <br/>
with a character and be all fired up to watch the movie, only to <br/>
discover its scarier to her than she expected. That doesn&#39;t always <br/>
change her desire to watch the movie, though! Happily she&#39;s very <br/>
creative about finding ways to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691781000">*I* still hide my eyes or walk out for stuff that scares me. My dh and my<br/>
kids will tell me (if they know) when a part that might scare me is on. They<br/>
will tell me however specifically that I need what happens so I can decide<br/>
if I want to see it. Sometimes I need to know exactly what happens to feel<br/>
comfortable in a movie other times I want the surprise. I also don&#39;t always<br/>
watch movies all the way through. Sometimes it is just too much. Sometimes<br/>
my kids don&#39;t either.<br/>

material, by the way. I meant that we adults in my family enjoy them,  <br/>
but some are technically movies made for kids, like Matilda and Spy  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634506939">In our house we have kept the lights on sometimes.  But what has<br/>
always helped the most was talking through the movie.  He knew that I<br/>
was always ready to pause the movie and answer his who, what, where,<br/>
how type questions.  Knowing exactly how a movie is made really helped<br/>
him remind himself that what he is watching is not real.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I will say, for a child who rarely ever gets scared<br/>
Ghostbusters caused nightmares and he wouldn&#39;t go upstairs alone or<br/>
open the fridge for weeks.  I remember watching Ghostbusters when I<br/>
was his age.  In fact it was very popular with kids my age at the<br/>
time.  Maybe the social aspect of it being popular was what helped me.<br/>

Railway Children or The Secret Garden or Babe all of which my DS (6) <br/>
loves and watches over and over. There is tension and drama but no <br/>
gratuitous scary stuff. We also enjoy feature length documentaries <br/>
about things like lions and sharks. Scary if you&#39;re a gazelle or a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363694786">My sons have also enjoyed movies like Milo and Otis (friendship about real-life cat and dog and their adventures, no people and not scary). Also A Kid in King Arthur&#39;s Court.<br/>
I do have to mention that Star Wars (at least 4 and 5 and 1) was not at all scary for my then 5.5 y.o. Cinderella was. He still does not want to see it. AFter watching the Star Wars Trilogy for the first time with me he did not want to see it again for a year or so. It satisfied his curiosity. Now he will sometimes watch parts of one. Usually he does not make it through a whole movie. He will watch a little, build some legos, play with toys etc. while doing it. Usually we have a lot of other things going on when watching movies, unless it is something we REALLY want to pay attention to. <br/>
It might be hard to keep it casual if it is something he has long wanted to do and it is a big deal. Otherwise, maybe just say, watch as much as you like and when it becomes scary we can turn it off, or fast-forward - my older son would sometimes leave the room when parts got scary and told me to call him back in when they are over. Sometimes he asked me to fast-forward certain parts. Or mute those parts and hide behind a ready-made fortress. We did read the Star Wars stories a lot in bed and there were a lot of movie pictures in it, so by the time he saw them (and after) he sort of knew what to expect by hearing and talking about it, once we watched something about the making of etc. <br/>
Our local science museum (Boston) has a model of Anakin&#39;s ship and a whole model making section, so we could talk a lot about how models in movies. Another fun thing to watch for my sons are Lego movies online. And soon, make them. If you have a video camera you can make your own short movies and talk about how you could make things look real even if they are not (blood is a fun one -). If you have a little toy R2D2, how could you make a desert landscape and have him &#39;walk&#39; through so it would look as if he was true to size?<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps -<br/>

&gt; &gt; said he was grossed out and freaked out. We had tried<br/>
&gt; The Incredibles,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but the scene with the dead superheroes wigged him out<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; animated. Even Wallace and Gromit (also animated) sort<br/>
&gt; of freaked him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He really wants to watch Spiderman, Harry Potter, Star<br/>
&gt; Wars, etc., but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know he&#39;ll freak out. I hate it that he gets all<br/>
&gt; excited and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets scared in the middle of the movie and wants it<br/>
&gt; turned off. He<br/>
&gt; &gt; feels bad about it and like there&#39;s something<br/>
&gt; wrong with him because<br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;s scared. I really want to help him watch<br/>
&gt; things he wants to watch.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions movie or otherwise?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39274986">I have a 12yo ds that loves movies like Predator, Alien, The Thing etc. <br/>
but for some reason can&#39;t handle the R.O.U.S.&#39;s in The Princess Bride.  <br/>
They really scare him.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to know what your child <br/>
will be able to handle and what will be too much for them.  I think <br/>
watching in the morning or early in the day hours helps a lot.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048390929">I used to go to Screen-It <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com/">http://www.screenit.com/</a> - they give very,<br/>
very detailed descriptions of what happens in each movie, without a<br/>
religious undertone like some sites have. Evan was very sensitive<br/>
about what he watched - he&#39;d run and hide at the &quot;Where&#39;s Spot?&quot; video<br/>
when the kitty hissed! I could go to that site, and I&#39;d read him what<br/>
was there, and he&#39;d decide whether to watch or not, with my input. It<br/>
does give away plot sometimes in doing that, but that didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
matter so much. Now that he&#39;s older, he&#39;ll pretty much watch anything<br/>
- even stuff *I&#39;m* too sensitive for. I see that now screenit has<br/>
changed to a subscriber basis, but you can scroll down and say &quot;no<br/>
thanks&quot; and still get access to a lot of the content. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124087400">Whereas that&#39;s not true for my 5 year old.  My mileage varied, I think<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t there watching it with him.  I think he got a wrong<br/>
impression about something.<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, I&#39;m not poo pooing the movie.  It&#39;s one of my absolute<br/>
favorites.  Reeeeally great stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758399528">Hi There,<br/>
<br/>
Since he&#39;s 4 yrs old, my now 8 yrs old kid&#39;s afraid of the dark and <br/>
any sort of mask, so Halloween is a touchy time and subject. But given <br/>
time and patience, he&#39;s learning to overcome it on his own. <br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s afraid of all those wax models you get in a musuem, so when <br/>
he asked to go to the Madame Tussaud last year, we knew he was trying <br/>
to work out his own fears. He&#39;s still is vary of them, infact just a <br/>
few weeks ago, we hd to leave the musuem we&#39;re in because he got <br/>
spooked by a scary looking wax model of an agressive looking Queen <br/>
Bodica.  <br/>
<br/>
We had to leave 10 minutes into 10,000 BC because son was too scared <br/>
LOL! My kid has yet to watch any of the Pirates of the Carribean <br/>
movies- the scary face/mask factor again. <br/>
<br/>
But he amazed me when he sat thru his first Star Wars movie in the <br/>
cinema, considering it&#39;s dark and a very long movie and Darth Vader is <br/>
in a scary mask! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s to add onto Pam&#39;s awesome list. <br/>
<br/>
All time favourite - Sound of Music. <br/>
Howabout a sing-along with the new Mamma Mia?<br/>
Polar Express<br/>
Alvin and the Chipmunk<br/>
Free Willy<br/>
Meerkat Manor - a documnetary series showcasing the lives and hierachy <br/>
of the meerkats. Very cute and entertaining. You can check it out on <br/>
Youtube, and the full series is available thru amazon.com.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube - The Forbidden City- a series of re-enacted documentary on <br/>
ancient china&#39;s rulers. <br/>
<br/>
Bi-centennial Man - Robin William playing a gentle loving home robot <br/>
who eventually turned into man. A feel good movie. If your kid&#39;s <br/>
afraid of a fullsize metal walking thing, then this might not be the <br/>
right move. Surprisingly, my kid watched this considering a talking <br/>
metal face can be scary. i suppose when the metal face&#39;s attached to a <br/>
full metal body, it&#39;s no longer classified as a scary mask. <br/>
<br/>
Penelope - the girl with a pig nose. A fairy tale story about a pretty <br/>
girl with an old family curse. Again, for my son, the mask factor is <br/>
overlooked because it&#39;s an actual face.  <br/>
<br/>
HellBoy 1 - Again, success for us despite HellBoy&#39;s scary looks. But I <br/>
suspect it&#39;s the scene when Hellboy was first discovered, a monkey-<br/>
like baby creature that was friendly and vulnerable. I think my son&#39;s <br/>
made a connection with this scene somehow, so Hellboy wasn&#39;t so scary <br/>
for him afterall. No throwing up scenes as far as I can remember, but <br/>
lots of smashing and fast actions. <br/>
<br/>
March to Glory, the story about the 300 spartans. It&#39;s ancient warfare <br/>
with lots of fighting and blood and human-relations and strategies. <br/>
For us, there was a purpose in watching it. My kid was playing this <br/>
game on his psp, so by watching it, it brought to life what he was <br/>
doing in his game. Again, he wasn&#39;t frightened off by the face masks, <br/>
and there&#39;s quite a number of them in this movie. <br/>
<br/>
Rush Hour 1 and 2- i know it&#39;s has rude language in it, but it&#39;s <br/>
hillarious (more for me and hubby&#39;s benefit) and has lots of stunts <br/>
(for son&#39;s benefit). My kid&#39;s into martial arts. So he&#39;s into any kung <br/>
fu movies, especially Jackie Chan and Jet Li&#39;s. <br/>
 <br/>
So by now writing this, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if there&#39;s a pattern <br/>
here, that when we&#39;re watching something with a &quot;purpose to <br/>
understand&quot;, other than just entertainment, maybe it provided DS with <br/>
a focus, away from his fear factor? Maybe this might work for your <br/>
kid? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve got lots more movies in my brain but then, my brain&#39;s <br/>
not working today LOL! I hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>
Hugs and best wishes to everyone,<br/>
