<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276725756">Somebody was asking *how* kids learn without reading....I just can&#39;t <br/>
find the post to quote it right now, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to answer though, because my Jared (12) just started <br/>
reading recently.  First though, cool things about non-readers:<br/>
           ~they see things other people DON&#39;T see because while <br/>
we&#39;re reading signs while driving (you can&#39;t NOT read once you are <br/>
able) they don&#39;t see words, they see colors, clouds, plants, <br/>
interesting people etc.... They literally SEE the world differently. <br/>
It&#39;s amazing.<br/>
<br/>
           ~they THINK differently than a reader. They are able to <br/>
puzzle things out, memorize shapes, colors and signs that have <br/>
nothing to do with words, in order to get the information they need. <br/>
For example, Jared had literally memorized the capabilities of many, <br/>
many, MANY Yu-gi-oh cards. He knew them by their pictures. He has <br/>
played extremely difficult games like Dungeons and Dragons all <br/>
without reading. Again....amazing.<br/>
<br/>
           ~they often use drawing as a form of expression quite <br/>
sufficiently, because they don&#39;t have the words to use yet.<br/>
<br/>
           ~they think (at least in Jareds case) very logically <br/>
about the whole reading/writing issue; &quot;Why on earth is that word <br/>
spelled like this, it doesn&#39;t make ANY sense&quot;...which leads to a <br/>
discussion on entymology and a bit of research in that area to help <br/>
explain the roots of the word....which could lead to a discussion <br/>
about other languages, culture, the evoluation of language etc.... <br/>
(or not).  Children that read very young don&#39;t always question the <br/>
logic and entymology aspects of language, they might later, but if <br/>
you can decode things naturally at 4-6 years old, you probably <br/>
aren&#39;t going to have the same level of critical thought and <br/>
questioning. (but then again, that&#39;s just my kids).<br/>
<br/>
   I just think about what it&#39;s like to see the world without being <br/>
forced to read!! Can you even imagine what that&#39;s like? How cool.<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s a really necessary tool eventually....but I would LOVE to <br/>
remember what it&#39;s like to see the world through those eyes again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here at my computer and just looking around my HOUSE, I <br/>
see words everywhere, and I can&#39;t possibly ignore what they say. I <br/>
try to imagine what that&#39;s like, what I might see if I could just <br/>
see people and colors and STUFF. <br/>
<br/>
There are many wonderful things about non-readers, beyond the fact <br/>
that they learn through many, many methods that have nothing to do <br/>
with reading. <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see:<br/>
~observing<br/>
~doing<br/>
~watching videos, drama productions, concerts, real life<br/>
~LIVING....there is nothing better for learning than shopping, being <br/>
part of a family, interacting with you community etc....<br/>
~and my favorite;  PLAY<br/>
<br/>
Play is the fodder for genius, it is the stuff from which greatness <br/>
is born. Play is not only devalued and ignored in our society, it is <br/>
looked down on!! <br/>
Play is what Einstein was doing when he came up with new formulas <br/>
and equations. Play is what Benjamin Franklin was doing when he <br/>
pondered and puzzled and tried to find answers. Play is what led <br/>
Edison to patent hundreds of inventions.<br/>
PLAY.<br/>
<br/>
If you read about Franklin in childhood, he was mucking about with a <br/>
kite down by a lake as a child (I believe around 11y.o.) and was <br/>
curious about the wind and weather. He stripped down, got the kite <br/>
in the air and laid in the lake while flying the kite to try and <br/>
understand how the wind moved across the water.<br/>
Can you see a parent trying to understand why on earth their child <br/>
is laying naked in a lake flying a kite!!!<br/>
But that kind of &quot;useless&quot; play led to great things later in life.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is fascinated with something, you must TRUST that it is <br/>
important learning going on....whether it&#39;s an obsession with <br/>
trains, dirt or spongebob.  Their interests, fascinations and <br/>
seemingly simply mucking about is important learning.<br/>
It may not look like much today, but it IS important.<br/>
Trust that.<br/>
<br/>
Trust that books are only ONE way to learn. Trust that children will <br/>
learn in a million ways without reading. Just trust.<br/>
<br/>

I loved your whole post (!), thanks for sharing your thoughts!  This <br/>
is something dd does quite often, questions why a certain word is <br/>
spelled the way it is.  She&#39;s considered a &quot;poor speller&quot; by school <br/>
standards (because she can&#39;t figure it out phonetically or when <br/>
writing, she often leaves out letters, ends of words etc).   Yet she <br/>
has the most amazing vocabulary.  This was one of the problem, IMO, <br/>
in school, is that when she was able to express what she knew <br/>
VERBALLY, she was so &quot;ON&quot;; when she tested or wrote something, it <br/>
looked like someone else, much younger had done the work.  They <br/>
didn&#39;t actually say this often, but I know they felt she just needed <br/>
to try harder, make more of an effort (to do what?  write it <br/>
perfectly?   I tried so hard to get them to allow her to &quot;test&quot; <br/>
verbally, but gave up once I decided we would be homeschooling).  She <br/>
needs to form a visual picture of a word, needs to see it, &quot;hold&quot; it, <br/>
embrace it, feel it, if you will.  Once the picture is in her mind, <br/>
it&#39;s PERMANENT.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536352559">Whew.  Thank you, Ren. <br/>
<br/>
My new-to-unschooling 16 y/o Does Not like to read at all and I took <br/>
great comfort in your words because while he&#39;s not reading he&#39;s <br/>
creating, exploring, dreaming and doing.  He just made a remote <br/>
control car from an old rocket launcher, old capsella and some legos, <br/>
definitely not something he&#39;d get a prize for in school but an <br/>
engineering feat nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all learning to trust right now and the rewards come daily.</div>
