<div id="ygrps-yiv-827965198">SCHOOLS CHIEF JACK O&#39;CONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOME SCHOOLING IN<br/>
CALIFORNIA<br/>
<br/>
SACRAMENTO - State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack<br/>
O&#39;Connell announced today that the California Department of Education has<br/>
completed a legal review of the February 28 California Court of Appeal<br/>
ruling regarding home schooling. O&#39;Connell issued the following statement:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that<br/>
chose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not<br/>
change in any way as a result of this ruling. Parents still have the right<br/>
to home school in our state.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every child in our state has a legal right to get an education, and I want<br/>
every child to get an education that will prepare them for success in<br/>
college and the world of work in the challenging global economy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As the head of California&#39;s public school system, I hope that every parent<br/>
would want to send their children to public school. However, traditional<br/>
public schools may not be the best fit for every student. Within the public<br/>
school system there are a range of options available. Students can take<br/>
independent study classes, attend a charter school, or participate in<br/>
non-classroom-based programs. But some parents choose to send their children<br/>
to private schools or to home school, and I respect that right.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I admire the dedication of parents who commit to oversee their children&#39;s<br/>
education through home schooling. But, no matter what educational program a<br/>
student participates in, it is critical that the program prepares them for<br/>
future success in the global economy. I urge any parent who is considering<br/>
or involved in home schooling their children to take advantage of resources<br/>
and support available through their county or district offices of<br/>
education.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962679155">What he means is that he thinks we all should (be required to) sign up  <br/>
with the homeschooling programs offered by the school districts or  <br/>
county boards of education. Those require annual standardized testing,  <br/>
turning in work samples, and giving grades. Our education officials  <br/>
are slick politicians.<br/>
