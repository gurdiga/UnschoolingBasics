chat room and join Sandra for the chat with Schuyler next week.<br/>
There&#39;s one on Monday and then Schuyler is on Thursday (is that<br/>
right?). The focus is video gaming and I believe she&#39;s getting my<br/>
friend Laura scheduled for a chat about being new to unschooling.<br/>
Lotsa fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499370552">The chat with me is on Wednesday at 11am CST (it&#39;s 5pm Greenwich Mean Time). There is a list now if you want to know when chats are coming up: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ChatNote/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ChatNote/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed the rush of real time chats. It was good to watch Ren chat. I&#39;d just listened to the interview that Ren and Laura Bowman had done on the Relaxed Homeschooler, so I had their voices still in my head. <br/>
