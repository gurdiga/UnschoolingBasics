<div id="ygrps-yiv-633021003">My daughter is almost 2 ½ , and it seems that her friends who are not in<br/>
preschool are enrolled in various classes, so I have tried a couple with<br/>
her. For my daughters age and disposition we have only tried classes that I<br/>
can do with herfor instance a gymnastics class at the local Y where the<br/>
toddlers were working with their parent under a teachers guidance. Mayas<br/>
friend (not unschooled, though not in school) loves the class which is why<br/>
we decided to try that particular one outMaya had fun, but was not too into<br/>
standing in line or following group activitieskinda freaked the teacher<br/>
outanyway, we were able to happily and successfully negotiate that class,<br/>
but I decided that it was not a great environment for her personality. I<br/>
think at such a young age (depending on the child of course) you should<br/>
probably be in the class with your child to monitor, observe, and help them<br/>
negotiate new situations (standing in line or choosing not to, ect) it can<br/>
be a nice activityif they seem to enjoy it. If not, maybe (for a dance<br/>
class for instance) you can find a friend who has a wall of mirrors in the<br/>
house and wouldnt mind you guys dressing up in dance clothes and putting on<br/>
some music and dancing whenever the mood or desire for dance class<br/>
entersMaya LOVES to dress up in something special and dance in front of a<br/>
mirror where she can watch herself I guess Im trying to say that if you<br/>
cant find the right class environment for your kids, you can creatively<br/>
facilitate their interests otherwise. Also, usually you can try out or<br/>
observe a class before paying for a whole session upfront.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, last summer I (regretfully) tortured Maya through survival<br/>
floating/swim classes where they would not let me be in the water with herI<br/>
finally convinced them to allow me to join her in the water (the classes<br/>
were free so I didnt feel like I had a bargaining chip to negotiate my<br/>
terms better). She was not afraid of the water before, but is hesitant<br/>
nowon the other hand she floats perfectlyand we live in Florida where<br/>
drowning is a statically huge risk for childrennone the less, I think I<br/>
could have DEFINITELY either passed up the free class (8 weeks daily) or<br/>
advocated MUCH BETTER for my child in the first placethe classes would have<br/>
cost us 90 a week, a lot of money for us, but in retrospect I would PAY 90 a<br/>
week to not have her crying for those 15 minute daily classes. (on a side<br/>
note she later did fall in the bay, with me at her side, and swam to the<br/>
surface and floated as I jumped in to get her.i treaded water and screamed<br/>
for help to get out for about 10 minutes while she happily splashed beside<br/>
me, not realizing the gravity of the situation) I guess the point of this<br/>
long-ish post is that there are a lot of ways to meet your childrens needs<br/>
and interests if you do it creatively, and also in a class situation you<br/>
have to be very aware of properly advocating for your child<br/>
