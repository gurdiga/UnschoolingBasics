<div id="ygrps-yiv-969864195">OK, Luke, (the 12 year old I&#39;ve been talking about) asked why there <br/>
were so many black people in Jamaica. I said that I thought it was <br/>
because during evolution people&#39;s skin color changed according to <br/>
the climate of where they lived. He then wanted to know why <br/>
different races had different features like eye shape and nose <br/>
shape. I said I didn&#39;t know maybe it had to do with climate and food <br/>
(different crops being abundant) <br/>
<br/>
We looked it up online but kept pulling up Christian creationist <br/>
websites, so I looked in the library&#39;s catalog to see what they had <br/>
to offer.<br/>
<br/>
At that point he said &quot;I don&#39;t want to read anything&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I said, &quot;So, I want to know. I&#39;ll read it and let you know what <br/>
is says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He seemed content with that.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, He is ok learning about topics if I read it FOR him. Great. I <br/>
think he will learn about &quot;topics&quot; that way.... but if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
read it himself how will he develop his own reading/researching <br/>
skills?<br/>
<br/>
I think I am irritating people here, but these are sincere <br/>

  By seeing *you* model them. By seeing *you* be interested and <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
  How much did you learn? Or did you quit looking because he was no <br/>

 What&#39;s irritating is that you don&#39;t seem to be trying.<br/>
<br/>
 You&#39;re wanting to be spoon-fed.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve given you books, websites, magazine. these archives, and even <br/>
one-on-one advice, but you keep complaining.<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;re not seeing your child as wonderful and unique and whole and <br/>
complete the way he is right now. THAT&#39;s the first step. See and accept <br/>
him for Who He Is Right Now.<br/>
<br/>
  After you accept him as already perfect, THEN he will start impressing <br/>
you. Not *one* second before that though.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
You come across as very negative.  You, the mom.   You don&#39;t want to read<br/>
the works of unschoolers because you &quot;hate&quot; their writing style.  You<br/>
don&#39;t want to spend money on something unless there&#39;s a guaranteed<br/>
outcome.  You don&#39;t see learning happening.  <br/>
<br/>
If your kid doesn&#39;t want to read I&#39;m not at all surprised.   Please,<br/>
please sit down with yourself and listen to the commentary inside your<br/>
own head and as objectively as possible consider how negative you&#39;ve come<br/>
across here at this list and see if that negativity is a part of your<br/>
everyday life.   Because I&#39;m thinking that either 1.  your son is<br/>
reflecting YOUR negativity as something he&#39;s learned from you or 2. YOU<br/>
are projecting YOUR negativity onto him and he&#39;s coping in the best way<br/>
he knows how.<br/>
<br/>
It starts with you.    It won&#39;t change until you change.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Erin, I think it&#39;s great that he asked the question in the first<br/>
place!!  I think you really have to go slowly here.  Take each moment,<br/>
and try not to project too far into the future.  Think of him as<br/>
healing now.  Imagine if someone breaks their leg, they need to stay<br/>
off it, depending on the kind of fracture it is, for as long as six or<br/>
eight weeks.  So, if you try to walk on it, it will seem impossible,<br/>
and you might think to yourself, &quot;Hmmm.  How will I ever walk again on<br/>
this leg normally; it hurts so much.&quot;  But, you&#39;re healing now and<br/>
you&#39;re not supposed to try to walk on it.  After it has had a chance<br/>
to heal properly, you can begin to put weight on it, and *eventually*<br/>
you can find yourself walking around as though it had never been broken.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s healing from his school experiences.  After he has had a chance<br/>
to heal and regain his trust in his world, he&#39;ll be able to resume<br/>
being the learning machine that he actually is.  Right now, he can&#39;t<br/>
do that.  So, my suggestion is not to worry so much about how he&#39;ll<br/>
develop reading/researching skills in the future.  Just get him<br/>
through this healing period so he can regain that part of himself that<br/>
loves to read the dictionary for fun!<br/>

way different thing that you&#39;re trying to do than perhaps what<br/>
resonates with you.  I wish my folks had been willing to step outside<br/>
their comfort level and pursue a different thing when I was a kid. <br/>
They just couldn&#39;t do it, but that you are willing to, I think, is<br/>
brave and respectful of Luke. <br/>

<br/>
Well... you didn&#39;t want to read about unschooling so you found a list and<br/>
came here to ask all your questions of the people who did read.   Maybe<br/>
your son will be like that... <br/>
<br/>
Seriously though,  he&#39;s not going to be a twenty five year old who wants<br/>
his mom to read to him.  I swear to you.  He will not.  You are looking<br/>
at him today as if he&#39;s never going to grow and change.   Next year he&#39;ll<br/>
have grown and changed a lot, and in happy ways if you make his life<br/>
happy right now. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s only 12. Don&#39;t picture his now self as just being a smaller  <br/>
version of his 22 yo self.<br/>
<br/>
Research isn&#39;t that difficult. It won&#39;t take years to learn. (In fact  <br/>
you say he&#39;s already researching his own interests. Don&#39;t down play  <br/>
that just because he isn&#39;t researching something he would learn in  <br/>
school. The skills to find out the names of the newest Pokemon are  <br/>
*exactly* the same as the skills to find out the natives of Jamaica.)  <br/>
*The* most important thing -- in research and learning -- is wanting  <br/>
the information.<br/>
<br/>
You can help him learn how to suppress his desire to learn by  <br/>
pressuring him to do research in order to learn how to do research.  <br/>
In the process he&#39;ll learn how to do something that he won&#39;t want to  <br/>
do. Schools are infamous for forcing in information in a way that   <br/>
makes the subject so unpalatable that kids make sure they never come  <br/>
in contact with a need to use that information or those skills. How  <br/>
many adults don&#39;t read for pleasure because they were pressured to  <br/>
learn to read &quot;at all costs&quot;? The cost, being, the desire to read!<br/>
<br/>
Stop looking at the world of information and skills you want to get  <br/>
into  him. That&#39;s going to stop you from understanding how  <br/>
unschooling works and you&#39;ll get in it&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about living life, and learning skills and information  <br/>
as a side effect. Don&#39;t assume that because unschoolers aren&#39;t headed  <br/>
directly towards something -- research, alphabet, math, writing ...  <br/>
-- that it isn&#39;t important. We know it&#39;s so important, so integral to  <br/>
living that kids will learn it as a side effect of living because  <br/>
they have to use it.<br/>
<br/>
We just don&#39;t have to teach it. My daughter picked up knowledge of  <br/>
fractions as a side effect of wanting to cook. Fractions got used and  <br/>
she got better at them the more she cooked. She picked up percentages  <br/>
as a side effect of video games (and art programs and sales and tips  <br/>
and ....) It made no difference if she understood them completely as  <br/>
she played. It made no difference that she learned from playing Paper  <br/>
Mario or calculating something &quot;important and academic&quot; like sales  <br/>
tax. Percentages work the same.) Her understanding of percentages  <br/>
grew as her understanding of the games grew. Side effect and yet  <br/>
integral and vital.<br/>
<br/>
English is a much more useful means of communicating than crying and  <br/>
*just by living life* kids pick English up effortlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Learning a language *because someone thinks you should* is very very  <br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
So it goes with the skills taught in school. Having a great desire to  <br/>
communicate with other kids, kids IM each other and as a side effect  <br/>
learn to type and learn to translate thoughts in their heads into  <br/>
words so that others can understand. Just because those skills are  <br/>
learned as a side effect doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re inconsequential.  <br/>
They&#39;re integral to what the child is trying to do. Kids just don&#39;t  <br/>
have to be competent at the skills before they start IMing and  <br/>
emailing. It&#39;s the desire to IM and email that drives the kids to  <br/>
keep IMing and emailing. The skills improve without them even being  <br/>
aware.<br/>
<br/>
(And it&#39;s perfectly okay if he&#39;s not IMing and emailing. I don&#39;t  <br/>
think my daughter did much at 12.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I said, &quot;So, I want to know. I&#39;ll read it and let you know what<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I am irritating people here, but these are sincere<br/>
&gt; questions....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t doubt that they&#39;re sincere! I understand the fears. Most of  <br/>
us do since we&#39;ve been there.<br/>
<br/>
But it will help you to know that we all want at the core the same  <br/>
thing for our kids that you do. We&#39;re concerned about them being  <br/>
competent in the world. We want as many doors open for them as we  <br/>
possibly can open. There isn&#39;t a single person here who wants their  <br/>
child to be a non-reading, math-illiterate 20 yo even though, from a  <br/>
schooled mindset, it looks as though that only by luck that our kids  <br/>
don&#39;t turn out that way. The advantage we have, though, over those  <br/>
who have a schooled mindset, is that we&#39;ve seen our kids learn by  <br/>
living so we know we can trust it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you can hold one thing in your heart, try this:  Anybody who<br/>
believes in themselves can do anything they want.  Sometimes, the one<br/>
thing a person needs to believe in himself is having someone else<br/>
demonstrate that they really believe in him, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you hear a truth so often that it becomes cliché and it<br/>
loses its meaning, but unschooling is nothing if it&#39;s not about trust.<br/>
 The trust that you have in him, rather, the trust that he *knows* you<br/>
 have in him will be enough to help him believe in himself.  It sounds<br/>
so sappy that I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m writing it, but it&#39;s really true.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter what he wants to do:  If he wants it enough and<br/>
believes in himself, there&#39;ll be no stopping him, and *that&#39;s* the<br/>
kind of preparation that you want to be looking at.  All the other<br/>
stuff will take care of itself.  (But, you really don&#39;t have to take<br/>
my word for it, nor should you.  There are plenty of unschoolers who<br/>
have proven this just by living their lives!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ever the case even though it comes across that way!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a need to have full confidence before trying.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that trust and confidence can&#39;t come from reading. It  <br/>
can only come from trying and seeing it in action.<br/>
<br/>
We can tell you what you should be seeing and how to turn your  <br/>
thoughts around so that you&#39;re seeing from a new light and different  <br/>
direction. But it&#39;s only by doing and trying that you can actually  <br/>
understand what we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like trying to explain swimming to someone whose never seen a  <br/>
body of water big enough to swim in. No matter how many words you  <br/>
throw at it, no matter how skillful the explainer is with English,  <br/>
there just isn&#39;t a substitute for doing.<br/>
<br/>
Which is pretty much what unschooling is about! If we could hand you  <br/>
a book to teach you to unschool, we could hand kids books to teach  <br/>
them English and math. But the foundation of unschooling is that  <br/>
wanting and doing are the best way to learn.<br/>

read it himself how will he develop his own reading/researching<br/>
skills?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to chime in here - I am not sure if what I say will help or <br/>
not.  I am about one year ahead of you.  I was in the exact same place a <br/>
year ago with my then 12 yo nephew who had just moved in with us (april <br/>
of 2005).  He had attended public school since Kindergarten. &quot;Failing&quot; <br/>
miserably by the school&#39;s standards.  He would completely shut down when <br/>
it came to any and all of the following (even if the word was just <br/>
mentioned his body would get all tight and defensive): homework, school, <br/>
learning, reading, tests, studying, etc.  He would continually say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
Dumb!  I hate (fill in the blank)!&quot;  He would hunch over and cry.  We <br/>
would try to reassure him but to no avail.  I was planning on <br/>
homeschooling my own children so I figured I may as well &quot;teach&quot; him at <br/>
home too because that was my plan.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I had the common sense to see that teaching at home would just <br/>
replicate all the pointless busywork that he absolutely hated from <br/>
school except now it would be my job to make sure he did it.  And I <br/>
could easily see that I would never get anywhere.  I wanted him to do it <br/>
himself, to read, to learn, to strive to better himself.  I wanted him <br/>
to enjoy his life, be happy and feel successful.  That was the real goal <br/>
- in my mind anyway.  The schoolwork was just a means to the end.  <br/>
Memorize your multiplication table, get a happy life.  But his life <br/>
wasn&#39;t happy right now and I could really see that the very act of <br/>
forcing him to learn was actually guaranteeing that he would never get a <br/>
happy life.  So for all my good intentions, I was doing the exact <br/>
opposite of what he needed me to do.  I had to let go - let go of my <br/>
fears for the future, let go of my fears of what others may think, let <br/>
go of trying to control him in an effort to avoid what I feared.<br/>
<br/>
I spent the summer reading everything I could get my hands on.  All the <br/>
books everyone has already recommended.  I had to dismantle the whole <br/>
learning paradigm that was in my mind.  Everything that I had never even <br/>
questioned before like &quot;You have to get a diploma&quot; or &quot;You have to read <br/>
on your own by age 6&quot; or &quot;You have to follow a curriculum&quot;.  All that <br/>
school stuff.  I had to look at it with fresh eyes and use my own <br/>
experience, and the books, and other people to debunk all of that <br/>
garbage.  Because that is what it was: garbage filling up my mind and <br/>
keeping me from seeing the real learning that was happening.  There is <br/>
plenty of evidence that none of this stuff is true but you have to be <br/>
willing to accept that reality before you can move forward.  It is <br/>
harder than you think!  Because what does it mean if it isn&#39;t true?  <br/>
That I just spent my whole life investing in a system that was <br/>
absolutely false?  That every &quot;A&quot; I received in school was meaningless?  <br/>
And that I could have been so much more and better if I had been just <br/>
left alone?  There is a lot of anger that comes with acknowledging the <br/>
truth because that means that all of us (except of course those who were <br/>
unschooled) are victims of an awful, mind-debilating system that robs us <br/>
of our natural birthright and keeps us imprisoned through guilt, shame, <br/>
fear and doubt.  Are you ready to break out of that box?  Every fear you <br/>
have needs to be dismantled and only you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
So take the summer off.  Even with your fears intact, you can do this.  <br/>
Luke is on summer break and, just like every other kid in America, he <br/>
should not be expected to accomplish/learn/do school during the summer.  <br/>
Everytime a fear pops up and you want to make him do something, say to <br/>
yourself, &quot;He is on break!&quot;  Don&#39;t do anything for three months!  Just <br/>
enjoy yourself.  Enjoy him. Do whats fun, follow your heart not your fears.<br/>
<br/>
But you have an assignment: READ, READ, READ.  Start with the books that <br/>
dismantle formal learning such as Gatto, Llewellyn, Smith and Holt.  <br/>
Then dive into the unschooling books: Mckee, Kream, Fitzenreiter.  And <br/>
write down every fear you have and then research, research, research.  <br/>
How much of your own schooling do you use in your own life?  How many <br/>
people can you find who are successful despite not being successful in <br/>
school stuff?  Challenge all those preconceptions, dismantle them and <br/>
find the truth.  That is your job and no one, not even the good people <br/>
on this board, can do it for you.<br/>
<br/>
And back to my nephew:  He wouldn&#39;t read anything for himself but he <br/>
loved for me to read out loud to him.  so I did.  And I did.  And I <br/>
did.  I have now read 15 novels outloud to him.  Sometimes I would read <br/>
for 4 hours straight.  He loved it!  I loved it!  We shared something so <br/>
special with that.  I often thought, &quot;How will he get better at reading <br/>
without actually reading?&quot;  But I kept that to myself and figured time <br/>
would tell.  Well, I still read outloud to him - just because it is <br/>
something we enjoy together.  But he now spend hours studying his D&D <br/>
manuals.  If I was stuck in school mindset, I would not have seen the <br/>
value in this but now I am just happy to see him happy and doing <br/>
something he loves.  And then lo, and behold, he went and wrote a <br/>
novella and is now working on a second one.  Who would have guessed <br/>
that???  If I had continued to focus on what he was *not* doing and had <br/>
tried to force him do things that I thought he *should* be doing, I <br/>
would have taken away his oppurtunity to many other things, such as <br/>
writing a book.  Luke may never write a book but I can guarantee you <br/>
that by worrying about and taking up his time with things he dislikes <br/>
doing, you are actually preventing him from finding what he loves.  By <br/>
trying to keep his so-called opportunities open through schoolwork, you <br/>
are actually narrowing them.  I know, it is counterintuitive but it is true.<br/>

  Imagine you have a HUGE banquet spread before you - so huge that it  <br/>
stretches as far as the eye can see, in all directions. Some of the  <br/>
food is super nutritious, some is so delicious it is heavenly.<br/>
<br/>
Want to create an eating disorder? Force-feed your child! Want him to  <br/>
be resentful? Try to make him eat the super-nutritious and not the  <br/>
enticingly delicious!<br/>
<br/>
He will have a lifetime to sample it all - no need to stuff it all  <br/>
in, today.<br/>
<br/>
What you do, as an unschooling parent, is provide the banquet. But  <br/>
don&#39;t make ALL the foods, all at once. Provide little bitty tidbits  <br/>
for him to sample. If he likes things made with potatoes, make some  <br/>
more potato dishes (but not ONLY potato dishes).<br/>
<br/>
LITTLE TIDBITS - like you&#39;d have as a sample. Don&#39;t push more unless  <br/>
HE wants more. And even then, go easy, maybe he just wants a little  <br/>
bigger bite. Don&#39;t try to make him eat a meal when he&#39;s not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
By the way - the huge banquet IS spread before you - it is the whole  <br/>
wide world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660465554">Hi there Squeakybiscuit,<br/>
I know you are worried that your son may be lazy or won&#39;t learn to research on his own, but his learning style may not be by reading something but by hearing something,  I know I could never sit there as a kid and read a non fiction book no matter how interested in a subject I was.  If someone answered a question for me though it was in my head.  My son is the same way.  He hates to read but loves for me to snuggle with him and read to him or will listen if I look up something on the computer for him.  I know he knows how to read and quite well at that. He just chooses not to.  If you need a quick answer to something I think there is a website called www.askjeeves.com.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this unschooling way too so don&#39;t give up hope.  Sorry if this was too rambling.  I am a bit out of it today.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

<br/>
  OK, Luke, (the 12 year old I&#39;ve been talking about) asked why there <br/>
  were so many black people in Jamaica. I said that I thought it was <br/>
  because during evolution people&#39;s skin color changed according to <br/>
  the climate of where they lived. He then wanted to know why <br/>
  different races had different features like eye shape and nose <br/>
  shape. I said I didn&#39;t know maybe it had to do with climate and food <br/>
  (different crops being abundant) <br/>
<br/>
  We looked it up online but kept pulling up Christian creationist <br/>
  websites, so I looked in the library&#39;s catalog to see what they had <br/>
  to offer.<br/>
<br/>
  At that point he said &quot;I don&#39;t want to read anything&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  So I said, &quot;So, I want to know. I&#39;ll read it and let you know what <br/>
  is says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  He seemed content with that.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, He is ok learning about topics if I read it FOR him. Great. I <br/>
  think he will learn about &quot;topics&quot; that way.... but if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
  read it himself how will he develop his own reading/researching <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What did your parents specifically do that prepared you for being an <br/>
adult?  or prepared you for the job you&#39;ve chosen?  Let&#39;s start <br/>
there.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My mom sent me to school because that&#39;s all she knew.  Neither my <br/>
mother nor my teachers ever really taught me anything that prepared <br/>
me to be an adult or prepared me for a specific job.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s also turn your worry around.  What if you really think Math <br/>
and Science are the most important subjects.  Let&#39;s say you forget <br/>
about unschooling entirely and force your son to work hard in Math <br/>
and Science.  Then when he&#39;s ready for college, he decides to major <br/>
in English.  By your reckoning, he may be angry with you because you <br/>
didn&#39;t prepare him for his chosen field.  <br/>
<br/>
I really do understand your desire to hold your son&#39;s hand and be <br/>
responsible for him but I think you&#39;re going to realize one day that <br/>
it was never your responsibility.  You should be there to support <br/>
his interests and his passions.  Everything else will follow.  <br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, when I was 12 years old, I thought I would live <br/>
with my mother forever because I didn&#39;t like the idea of being a <br/>
grownup.  I certainly had absolutely no ambitions for a particular <br/>
jor or even to be married with kids.  In fact, I got out my <br/>
scrapbook from when I was an early teen and found a note where I had <br/>
received my first kiss.  The funny thing was that it was 10 years <br/>
earlier to the day when my first child was born.  I can assure you I <br/>
had NO desire to get pregnant and be a mom at the age of 13.  But as <br/>
a 38 year old, being a mom and wife are the most important things in <br/>
my life and I can&#39;t imagine doing anything else.  Let your child BE <br/>
a child and he&#39;ll become an adult later.  Don&#39;t put adult worries <br/>
and stress on him now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually lurk here but just wanted to add my thoughts on this thread.<br/>
 I went to public school(because that is all my mother knew as well)<br/>
and I was expected to go to college afterwards, which I did(I was 17<br/>
years old).   Well when I got to college I struggled at first because<br/>
I didn&#39;t know how to study.  I certainly didn&#39;t do much studying in<br/>
high school:)  After a semester of bad grades, I figured out  how to<br/>
study, otherwise I would have failed out.  I had know earthly idea<br/>
what I wanted to major in aand after 2 years I had to declare one.   <br/>
So I ended up going through the courses catalog and randomly picked a<br/>
major.  I finished that, then I was &quot;expected&quot; to get a masters<br/>
degree.  So I did that too.  I worked for a couple of years in my<br/>
field.  I had my kids and quit to stay home with them.  I realized I<br/>
never liked what I did because it just wasn&#39;t for me.  What a waste <br/>
really.  The thing that is sad to me is that I never figured out what<br/>
my passion was.  I feel like I never had the chance because I was busy<br/>
doing what was expected of me and so much time was wasted in public<br/>
school.  I don&#39;t regret going to college.  I just regret I never had<br/>
the chance early on to figure out what *I* wanted to do.<br/>
So I guess my point here is to leave your son alone and let him figure<br/>
out his own path.  IF he would ever blame you for something, I think<br/>
it would be that you didn&#39;t let him figure out his passions and dreams.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t help thinking that the world is changing so fast that NO ONE will  be <br/>
properly prepared for a career, at least in the way we think of it now.<br/>
 <br/>
I certainly wasn&#39;t &quot;prepared&quot; for computers, but here I am working a  <br/>
sophisticated piece of machinery casually and confidently.<br/>
 <br/>
There are some interesting books out there that speculate on the future of  <br/>
business, Daniel Pink comes to mind.  I believe you would find that most  would <br/>
advise people to be adaptable and eager to learn if they are going to make  <br/>
it in a perhaps extremely rapidly changing workplace.<br/>
 <br/>
The most prepared people are going to be those that have lived that life of  <br/>
adaptability and eagerness.....unschoolers!<br/>
 <br/>
I do understand your fear, I think it is my husband&#39;s biggest fear  also.  <br/>
But I think if you take a look at how many children graduate from  school and <br/>
still don&#39;t pursue their dreams, you&#39;ll see that the odds are  probably in your <br/>
son&#39;s favor.  He will have already spent his time pursuing  his passions, not <br/>
sitting in class daydreaming about them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another thought, you feel like YOU will take the blame and you cannot put  <br/>
the blame on school.    This is one of the reasons why  unschooling takes <br/>
courage!  *You* become responsible for your  child, not the government.  It is <br/>
interesting to think how a country  of upstart revolutionaries with a crazy idea <br/>
for self-governing ended up being  such pansies and handing their children over <br/>
to unknown others for proper  socialization.  <br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC, who other than unschooling is pretty much a pansy   :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683074861">The GOOD news is that we&#39;re unschooling now. I mean, your story could  <br/>
be mine...the difference being I was told I was going to be a doctor  <br/>
from the time I was very young. I made it halfway through college  <br/>
before I realized I had freedom to choose. i still resent my mom for  <br/>
that. I did waste a lot of time. I wasted a lot of money. I won&#39;t say  <br/>
I wasted college because I loved every class I took with the  <br/>
exception of maybe three required classes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since our family has moved to unschooling, I&#39;ve had more  <br/>
inclination to figure out my passions. I&#39;ve more time because I&#39;m not  <br/>
spending all my time trying to subvert my childrens passions. What  <br/>
*do* you want to do? Because how much better would it be for your  <br/>
child to see you finding *your* passion and doing what you can to  <br/>
live it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I&#39;ve known people with a similar story to yours.  My <br/>
story is a bit different.  My mom did not encourage me to go to <br/>
college.  She believed that college was for wealthy people and she <br/>
flat out told me I couldn&#39;t go.  I graduated high school a semester <br/>
earlier than everyone else because I got a job, got a car, <br/>
insurance, and moved into a new apartment with my mom so we could be <br/>
roommates and share the rent and utilities.  Then she encouraged me <br/>
to get married as quickly as possible and then nagged me about <br/>
grandchildren because she believed that ALL women really wanted to <br/>
just be married and have kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that my husband decided to finish his Bachelor&#39;s <br/>
Degree and we moved to a college town.  I got a clerical job on <br/>
campus and after working there for about a year, I realized that the <br/>
students were not special like my mom told me.  I realized I could <br/>
actually go to college.  I had my husband&#39;s support as long as we <br/>
could manage.  That meant that anytime we got really low on money or <br/>
behind in payments, I had to quit shool and go back to work full-<br/>
time while he continued on to graduate school.  <br/>
<br/>
Long story short -- that marriage didn&#39;t survive and I never did <br/>
earn a college degree.  After I was divorced, I asked my mom why she <br/>
pushed me into marriage at such a young age and she said she grew up <br/>
believing a girl needed a husband to make her happy and support <br/>
her.  But my mom was divorced when I was 4 yrs. old and didn&#39;t <br/>
remarry until I was 30 years old!  *lol*  She was doing fine on her <br/>
own but she wasn&#39;t happy about it.  Now she&#39;s in another miserable <br/>
marriage but she&#39;s happy because at least she&#39;s married.  Life is <br/>
strange.  I don&#39;t feel like I know enough about life to have <br/>
expectations for my children.  I just don&#39;t feel qualified to tell <br/>
them how they should live their lives when I&#39;m still trying to <br/>
figure out mine!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So many of us could have written this!!  It is very sad, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is 21 and is a senior in college and she is SO  <br/>
happy with her choice. She is majoring in recreation and leisure  <br/>
studies - her dream is to run a fine arts/outdoor life camp that  <br/>
helps people engage in deep self-examination into their own passions  <br/>
and their place in creating social justice in the world. She  <br/>
absolutely totally thoroughly LOVES what she is doing. It is a  <br/>
perfect fit for her and it has already opened up many many  <br/>
opportunities. She&#39;s a dreamer, clearly, but here she is taking  <br/>
courses in everything from child development, outdoor skills,  <br/>
environmental issues, financial management, grant writing, research  <br/>
methods, facility design, and administration, so her dreaming is not  <br/>
idle head in the clouds - but is being grounded in real skills and  <br/>
knowledge. She sees her college courses as a fantastic opportunity to  <br/>
squeeze every bit of useful knowledge and information out of her  <br/>
professors, to help further her own goals.<br/>
<br/>
At 21 she has a passion - a dream - AND she&#39;s working in concrete  <br/>
ways toward that dream.<br/>
<br/>
At 21 I was drifting along, going to school for lack of knowing what  <br/>
else to do. Trying to study as little as possible and still get  <br/>
decent grades (for no particular reason other than I was expected to  <br/>
get good grades). I was mostly interested in my boyfriend and going  <br/>
to the beach and to parties. My daughter has boyfriends and goes to  <br/>
the beach and to parties, too, &lt;g&gt; but she&#39;s most not &quot;just  <br/>
drifting,&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
Well, in the interest of full disclosure, she&#39;s probably not &quot;just  <br/>
drifting, but she&#39;s &quot;paddling&quot; a lot - she&#39;s off on a 2-week long  <br/>
kayaking trip in Utah.<br/>

prassions!  Do it now and live your life passionately!  What a<br/>
wonderful lesson for your children - seeing their parents living their<br/>
passions.  No matter what your passion, you will be able to find a way<br/>
to live them - even if, for now, you have to do so in moderation<br/>
because of finances and family needs.  That doesn&#39;t mean though that<br/>
you can&#39;t strew your passions around yourself and dive into them!<br/>
<br/>
Go be passionate!<br/>

I have been a lurker on this board for some time now and I just had <br/>
to tell you that this post you made literally brought me to tears! <br/>
It moved me so much! Let me tell you a little background.<br/>
 I had been a (non-certified) teacher in parochial school for about <br/>
15 yrs.  My ds was having some anger management and emotional <br/>
problems so the school recommended I have him evaluated.  <br/>
The &quot;Doctor&quot; said he was disturbed and showed signs of trauma and <br/>
psychosis!  He had never been traumatised by anything that I could <br/>
think of!  Well unless you count being accidentally left on the <br/>
playground at headstart or being accidentally locked in the bathroom <br/>
and left there while everyone else in the class went outside - <br/>
TWICE - once in kindergarten and again in 2nd grade!  I was floored -<br/>
 my sweet little boy? NO WAY!  So I tried to get the schools <br/>
assistance with this!  What a waste of every one&#39;s time!  So, after <br/>
doing some research I decided to homeschool him.  With my teaching <br/>
background I was the last person to think that homeschooling was a <br/>
good idea - I thought only extremist wackos did that! So, I withdrew <br/>
him from school and loved having him home so much that I soon <br/>
withdrew my dd. I took my now 12 yo ds out of PS a little over a <br/>
year ago, then a few months later my my 7 yo dd.  I still had one dd <br/>
in HS (10th grade - she did not want to leave her friends). So, I <br/>
left her there.  Since then we have moved to another state and she <br/>
decided to hs. YAY!!!  I have looked into unschooling (obviously <br/>
since I am on this board) since the beginning but my husband is <br/>
TOTALLY not into the whole idea of homeschooling.  I have had to <br/>
fight every step of the way.  I even had to take them out of ps <br/>
without his blessing (I don&#39;t ask permission for ANYTHING - lol!).  <br/>
Needless to say that was a rough patch to get through - but here we <br/>
are none the less!  I tried the school at home thing for a while - <br/>
mostly to please dh but when we we getting ready to move -  shucks - <br/>
there was just no time for &quot;school&quot;.  It has now been about 6 months <br/>
since the move and I just keep putting off school.  I keep finding <br/>
excuses to start. Thinking to myself that we will just stay like <br/>
this and lean more towards unschooling.  But - lately I have been <br/>
getting worried about my dd and going to college.  I talked to her <br/>
about it today and she says that she wants to go to college <br/>
because &quot;she knows she should&quot;.  I told her that she didn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily have to if her interests took her elsewhere (and now I <br/>
feel like I am being selfish because I am almost trying to talk her <br/>
out of it!).  She is very interested in art especially photography.  <br/>
I am going to arrange that she volunteers at our local little <br/>
theater working behind the scenes (she says she is too shy for <br/>
anything to do with acting).  When I told her about the opportunity <br/>
she was really enthusiastic about it and said she wanted to do it!  <br/>
I know her attitude towards college comes from my dh. Who by the way <br/>
has two degrees and a certificate which aren&#39;t worth the paper they <br/>
are printed on because he doesn&#39;t use them or the &quot;education&quot; they <br/>
came with in any way and never has.  But anyway, I am just so scared <br/>
that with only 2 years left (technically speaking), if I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; her she won&#39;t be able to get into art school or <br/>
college at all.  Get ready for this! ------ I have been looking into <br/>
getting a unit studies curriculum to begin in the fall.  I am so <br/>
confused right now from reading so much info that my head is <br/>
spinning.  <br/>
Then I read your post!<br/>
  Thank you for your analogy  - I was moved to tears because I <br/>
really do feel exactly that way inside but these superficial fears <br/>
and of course my husband breathing schooling down my neck are about <br/>
to drive me insane!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way - my son is no longer &quot;psychotic&quot;, &quot;angry&quot; <br/>
or &quot;disturbed&quot; in any way!(in my eyes never was) I believe <br/>
wholeheartedly it was the school which made him act like he was!  <br/>
Temporary insanity if you will - brought on by a system which was <br/>
stifling and oppressive.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so there you have it.  So sorry for such a long post but it has <br/>
been a long time coming!  Thanks to all who have listened.  Your <br/>
thoughts, feelings, comments, advice and suggestions are highly <br/>
valued and encouraged!!!!<br/>

wanted, etc., etc. When I was the most stressed from my corporate job I <br/>
would have dreams at night that I was still waiting tables and they were so <br/>
