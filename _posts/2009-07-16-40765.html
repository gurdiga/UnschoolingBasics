<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005879711">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, Worldschooling, Child Led Learning, Delight Driven Learning, Life LearningÂ…  Many names, yet one desire to live in freedom, loving, learning, and living each day to the fullest!  That is the joy of Unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an 18 year old longtime Unschooler, and it was always hard for my family when my sister (16) and I were younger, since pretty much everyone we knew was very school-at-home, and thought we were crazy to be Unschooling!  So I want to create something that wasn&#39;t there for my family when I was young, but would have made things so much easier for us!  What I want to do is bring together a supportive, caring group of Unschooling families, families who are seriously considering Unschooling, and those passionate about Unschooling, who can validate each others choices, share experiences, and just enjoy each others company!<br/>
<br/>
If this sounds as great to you as it does to me (or even if it just interests you) please check out this Yahoo! Group for a bit more information on the support group, and if you&#39;re interested in being part of this, please join! <br/>
