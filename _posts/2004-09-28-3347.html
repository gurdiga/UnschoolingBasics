<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832989345">Ok, this is weird. Both the spam posts are from members that have <br/>
been posting and not typical list spammers. Maybe something was <br/>
accidentally forwarded to this list?<br/>
I&#39;ve put both on moderation just to make sure it isn&#39;t an ongoing <br/>
problem with your computers or something. Let me know if you figure <br/>
out how it happened so I can get both of you back off moderation.<br/>
