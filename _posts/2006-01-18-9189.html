<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.beyondsatire.us/?q=node/82">http://www.beyondsatire.us/?q=node/82</a><br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t tried to make it yet but we would like to soon!<br/>
I have also seen homemade floam listed on EBAY, in much more colors <br/>
than the original stuff, again, I haven&#39;t tried it....<br/>
<br/>
Also,what is a Boomwhacker and where could we get one? Sounds like <br/>
something my son would love!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling right this minute....9 yo son is playing Roller Coaster <br/>
Tycoon 2 on the computer...while I am checking e-mail and my EBAY <br/>
listings....we&#39;ve only been up an hour or so since he stayed up late <br/>
last night playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 and still wanted to read <br/>
from his Murderous Maths Probability book....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189648509">Here is a link for the boomwhackers. There are different packages and<br/>
accessories that go with them. I bought mine at a local music store.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, they are tubes that you hit on any other object to make<br/>
music and sounds. They are supposed to be tuned to sound like musical<br/>
notes. I think you can even get sheet music to play songs.<br/>

I love sharing toys, resources, and ideas. We have been taking<br/>
glowstick baths and WOW! So magical (blue) and sometimes creepy<br/>
(red)...<br/>
