&gt;<br/>
&gt; The pee posts are cracking me up. We have 3 boys, and I have lots of<br/>
&gt; pee stories (when Inspector Gadget came out my son would whip his<br/>
&gt; penis out anywhere and yell, &quot;Go go gadget HOSE&quot; and then pee).<br/>
&gt; Suggestion: put a bowl of cheerios on the back of the toilet. Tell<br/>
&gt; him to put one in the toilet and aim for the center as he pees<br/>
&gt; (target practise). It might just seem &quot;fun&quot; enough to lure him in<br/>
&gt; when he has to go...***<br/>

We used to do this and my boys loved it.  In fact, when Jake was little,<br/>
they sold flushable *Tinkle Targets* in one of the catalogs ~ small pieces<br/>
of floating paper w/targets on them...I think *Right Start.*  He loved them!<br/>
But then someone told me about Cheerios and that was much cheaper!  ;-)<br/>
