1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called a<br/>
&quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing another<br/>
person&#39;s post or posting style will be rejected. If there is something about<br/>
a post that bothers you, stick to discussing the ideas presented, rather<br/>
than the post itself.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing. If it&#39;s<br/>
in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Try to change the subject line if the topic changes. This will help us<br/>
all access archives and utilize the discussions more effectively. Also, trim<br/>
your posts to avoid a message that takes up too much room. It&#39;s difficult to<br/>
read through them.<br/>
<br/>
4) All new members will be moderated in order to prevent spam from reaching<br/>
the list. Once you post an intro. or question, we will remove you from<br/>
moderation.</div>
