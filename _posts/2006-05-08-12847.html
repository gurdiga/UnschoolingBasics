<div id="ygrps-yiv-359409122">I&#39;ve been reading for a long time now and am so grateful for all that I <br/>
have learned here. I&#39;m now finding that there are times when my girls need <br/>
me and I&#39;m putting them off to read these emails. Something is wrong with <br/>
that picture, so I&#39;m going no mail for  a while.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back, and I&#39;ll check in at the <br/>
main site every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
All the best to all of you,<br/>
<br/>
Gayle  (mom to Faye 5 1/2 and Annika 4 today!)<br/>
