<div id="ygrps-yiv-551037549">Hi fellow unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was given this list address and told to join to also experience<br/>
the joy of communicating with like-minded people on the questions arising<br/>
from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to keep the introduction short. I&#39;m Ulrike and my youngest son<br/>
Alexander (12) made it very clear that he was not going to any normal school<br/>
or even special school. This was re-inforced when we went for the enrolment<br/>
talk at the local Waldorf school and the teacher told me afterwards that it<br/>
would not serve Alexander or the class if he were to join them. Since then<br/>
he (and I ) have been following our bliss at home.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Windhoek, the Capital of Namibia - somewhere in Africa - and I<br/>
haven&#39;t met any other unschoolers here, yet.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to great exchanges<br/>
Ulrike</div>

<br/>
For anyone interested, Namibia is located here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mapquest.com/atlas/main.adp?region=namibia">http://www.mapquest.com/atlas/main.adp?region=namibia</a><br/>

It is interesting to receive a message from so far away.  Judging from your name, you are most likely either Afrikaans or German.  <br/>
<br/>
My little boy was born in Sheffield, England and I also lived in Germany and made many trips to the Netherlands.  I speak German quite well and a little Dutch.  Of course, I can understand some Afrikaans.<br/>
<br/>
We are also very new to UNschooling/homeschooling and I am reading many of the posts to this list and trying to get my head around this subject.<br/>
<br/>
What is it like in Nimibia?  Do you know of a good website with pictures?<br/>
