<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128599039">Hello List,<br/>
<br/>
this may be helpful for people new to unschooling – but it would be  <br/>
nice if the experienced unschoolers around here would comment! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to report about a show that is being broadcasted here in  <br/>
Germany (or was). Maybe it&#39;s a copy of a show that is already known  <br/>
in US or elsewhere – this wouldn&#39;t be unusual, but if not, this is  <br/>
really interesting :-)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s a show where two families have been filmed for 8 days. The  <br/>
roles have been switched, the children are the &quot;parents&quot;, the parents  <br/>
are the &quot;children&quot;. It&#39;s all about switching roles and the children  <br/>
are called &quot;the bosses&quot; throughout the show. The parents are to do  <br/>
what the children say. They have a budget of € 400 for the week and  <br/>
have to use it wisely. They also have to manage all the household and  <br/>
decide what to do during free time. I didn&#39;t see all of it and I  <br/>
don&#39;t know if the children were still in school and if parents went  <br/>
to their jobs, maybe they used a vacation week. Children could also  <br/>
order their parents to drive somewhere (if they thought of it).<br/>
<br/>
Today was the last day of this experiment (they called it an  <br/>
experiment) and at the end, all were asked how they liked it and if  <br/>
they had learned something or if they had anything to comment. It was  <br/>
wonderful:<br/>
<br/>
The parents said that they were suprised to see how much children can  <br/>
do on their own, how much they understand about household and money  <br/>
managing and how many problems are just solved all by themselves  <br/>
without them intervening. They were also surpised to see how creative  <br/>
the children were in selecting family activities – one mother said  <br/>
she was happy that they did things they wouldn&#39;t have done before  <br/>
(skiing or whatever it was). One parent was surprised to see that s/he <br/>
(?) could count on the children. They were amazed how the children  <br/>
were able to really DO the stuff they were planning, no matter how  <br/>
many difficulties arose in the process. They were asked if they could  <br/>
imagine to do this every half a year for like 4 days or so - switch  <br/>
roles again. One family said yes, the other even said &quot;we could  <br/>
always do this&quot; (!) (half joking but still, he was very convinced!)<br/>
<br/>
The children were very happy that they had had the chance to show  <br/>
their parents their skills to manage on their own. I felt that some  <br/>
of the children were very sad that the roles would be switched again.  <br/>
The symbol for returning the power to the parents was handing out the  <br/>
keys of the house. At this moment, one child whined: &quot;oh noooo, I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to give up the power! I want to be the boss for at least  <br/>
one more hour!&quot; But they were also happy that lasting changes had  <br/>
been made in the house (they painted walls and made a &quot;chill out  <br/>
zone&quot; and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bit sad that the interviewers (after the experiment) kept  <br/>
asking things like &quot;yeah well, but you realize how hard a job it was,  <br/>
didn&#39;t you? Isn&#39;t it hard to be a parent? common, it was hard, wasn&#39;t  <br/>
it?&quot; (I guess the goal was that children learn that it is difficult  <br/>
to be a parent and that they should respect parents more and help  <br/>
more). The children said it was hard the first 4 days but that  <br/>
actually it was more fun than hard. Another good observation was,  <br/>
that the children tried to do all the housework themselves, and only  <br/>
asked the parents to help when they really needed help or when &quot;a  <br/>
hand would have been nice and they were around anyway&quot;. In one of the  <br/>
families, they required the parents to do chores, in the other, they  <br/>
just didn&#39;t (I guess each family did it the way it was modeled by the  <br/>
parents before).<br/>
<br/>
The first 4 days, the parents had a hard time letting go of control.  <br/>
One mother said that it was obvious that a change from one extreme to  <br/>
the other would be difficult, but that when she &quot;got&quot; it, she really  <br/>
enjoyed &quot;being a kid&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was watching the show today with a big wide grin. It&#39;s sad the show  <br/>
has only been shown in the kid&#39;s channel and surely very few parents  <br/>
saw the show. Another sad thing is that nobody concluded that it  <br/>
would be best giving everyone equal rights instead of flipping, but  <br/>
it&#39;s a start! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And so I got this intriguing idea:<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what would happen if this experiment would have  <br/>
continued for more weeks or months. I presume that the parents would  <br/>
feel it&#39;s &quot;unfair&quot; and they wouldn&#39;t like the coercive methods and  <br/>
the way the new &quot;bosses&quot; were talking to the parents who have no  <br/>
rights (in the show the children sometimes used these methods, also  <br/>
ordered the smaller kids to &quot;Sit down and eat your toast&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
talk to me like that&quot; blah, they had arguments about how the parents  <br/>
were disrespectful or not following the rules (i.e. not letting go of  <br/>
control). Since the children would know how it was before to be in  <br/>
that situation, they would be more likely to agree on &quot;equal rights&quot;  <br/>
for everybody - they would maybe talk it out and agree on making it  <br/>
all equal. Of course, in real life it wouldn&#39;t work because parents  <br/>
think they have an inherent right to be on top of the hierarchy so at  <br/>
some point they would just loose temper and call off the experiment.<br/>
<br/>
BUT – I was wondering if this wouldn&#39;t be a good thing to start with  <br/>
when people start unschooling/gentle parenting. While traditional  <br/>
parenting places the parents on top of the kids (parent -----&gt; kid)  <br/>
and switching does the same but the other way round (parent &lt;--------  <br/>
kid) and what we want to reach with gentle parenting is parent  <br/>
&lt;-------&gt; child - it would maybe be a good idea to first place the  <br/>
kid on top for a while.<br/>
<br/>
This way he could see how difficult it is (to be coercive, to be a  <br/>
parent, to be responsible, to do chores alone). I imagine it would  <br/>
help find balance. It&#39;s an easy experiment to do for a week or so to  <br/>
switch roles, but it&#39;s not easy to find balance right away (going  <br/>
from one extreme to the other is a lot easier because parents have  <br/>
shown us how to do it, while finding the ideal middle needs to be  <br/>
worked on and both sides have to learn, this is why deschooling of  <br/>
parents and children takes so long). I&#39;m not saying that with this  <br/>
experiment deschooling will be shorter or less work, but it might be  <br/>
clearer for everybody why we are doing this.<br/>
<br/>
This excercise could help parents and children understand each  <br/>
other&#39;s roles, to value the responsibilities of each and to truely  <br/>
understand why it is important to find that balance.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as the experiment on tv showed, parents would find out that  <br/>
children CAN do a lot and so it would be easier to build up that oh  <br/>
so needed trust!<br/>
<br/>
And, the parents could see the world from a kid&#39;s perspective for a  <br/>
while, which obviously brought joy to these families (doing fun stuff  <br/>
together, living joyfully like a kid!)<br/>
<br/>
I also think that it would trigger creativity (ours and my  <br/>
daughter&#39;s) on what to do with our free time, especially because of  <br/>
the limited budget. After that, when the &quot;real&quot; experiment starts  <br/>
(gentle parenting, finding that middle), one could continue to  <br/>
integrate the child in money managing (as many unschoolers do). I had  <br/>
the idea that letting the kid know how much money is available would  <br/>
trigger creativity on how to use that money wisely doing fun things.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if we should do this here at home. My daughter  <br/>
watched that show and I could feel that she was thinking &quot;we should  <br/>
do that too&quot;, instead of &quot;luckily we don&#39;t need to do that because WE  <br/>
have equal rights&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>

   <br/>
    What an awesome idea?  I&#39;m the one that just wrote about my pity party and power struggle with my child.  I think this would be the best thing I could do to unschool myself and learn to let go of the power/control.  I&#39;m willing to try it.  So  as soon as I do it I will let everyone know how it&#39;s going and everything........ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153799298">Yay, I thought probably nobody would read that long ;-) I&#39;m glad it  <br/>
helped someone :-) I&#39;m also thinking about doing this. Another thing  <br/>
I thought about later was that it would also help for everyone to see  <br/>
that unschooling or gentle parenting is *not* about doing letting the  <br/>
child have all the &quot;power&quot;! (this was something my father foresaw for  <br/>
instance). It&#39;s not about parents &lt;----- kids. It would help the kids  <br/>
see that too! (I sometimes think my daughter thinks that ;-))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788970638">They have a show in the US called, &quot;Try My Life&quot;. It is where one parent <br/>
trades roles with one child. The child goes to work and the parent goes to <br/>
school.  It would be hard in my house because my husband and I are both at <br/>
home all day with the kids! And which child would be in charge?<br/>
<br/>
I get the idea of using it as a launch for unschooling, it would be <br/>
interesting to see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758960148">In the German show they only switched roles in the house. Apparently,  <br/>
the children still went to school and parents still went to work or  <br/>
had a week off.<br/>
