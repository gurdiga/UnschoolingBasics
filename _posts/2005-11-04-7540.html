<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011616476">In our house there is always something on, TV or stereo. My dh says we drive <br/>

I think I get more done with it on, it takes my mind off what I&#39;m doing <br/>
(like cleaning) and the task seems to go faster.<br/>
But I can&#39;t stand talking on the phone while the TV is on.<br/>

&quot; I&#39;m another 1 of those who has to have background TV noise.  I<br/>
 sometimes wonder if it gets in the way of what we&#39;re doing though.<br/>
Does anyone else have any feelings about this?&quot;</div>

lol, same exact way here... something is on, whether it be the TV or  stereo. <br/>
I just made a request to DH that I&#39;d like a little kitchen radio, one  that <br/>
can play a CD. I just need something to occupy me while I do dishes or  <br/>
something.  <br/>
