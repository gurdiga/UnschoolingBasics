<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384881667">My son Ethan has expressed a desire to take some college classes here <br/>
and there starting next year, so I asked my accountant if the cost of <br/>
these classes could be a deduction.  He did some research and it can <br/>
only be considered a deduction if its a post secondary education and <br/>
that if he got his GED than we could.  My question, &quot;is there an age <br/>
requirement to get your GED in the State of Maine?&quot;  Ethan is only 13 <br/>
almost 14. Does anyone know where I could go to get information on <br/>
this?  I&#39;m not sure if Ethan will even want to get his GED, but I <br/>
would like to be armed with the information if he does decide this is <br/>
an option he&#39;d like to take.  Also, if you get your GED than you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get a diploma and there might be some options he would be <br/>
limiting himself with if he gets a GED.  Lots to think about.  I <br/>
would appreciate any information anyone has on this subject.  This is <br/>
all new ground for us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Cindy</div>

probably hit something useful.<br/>

of any sort. He graduates when you (and he) agree that he is <br/>
graduated. How would having a GED be any more limiting than just <br/>
homeschooling? And, no, I&#39;m not saying homeschooling is limiting but <br/>
if there&#39;s a presumption that a GED is &quot;limiting&quot; then wouldn&#39;t <br/>
homeschooling, where no diploma is issued at all, be just <br/>
as &quot;limiting&quot; if not moreso?</div>
