<div id="ygrps-yiv-863385418">Dear Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I woke up this morning, of course, thinking about Lisa, and I just <br/>
had an idea as I was reading all the beautiful emails I&#39;ve received <br/>
while I was sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to invite folks, especially folks who won&#39;t be able to <br/>
attend tomorrow&#39;s memorial, to send me their joyous recollections, <br/>
impressions, or messages they would like to share about Lisa.  If her <br/>
Light has reached you in some way, whether physically, in her <br/>
writing, in your experience of Roxy and Fire, or just in your having <br/>
heard about this glorious, vibrant woman whose rich, full life and <br/>
beautiful, amazing family defined her way more than the story of how <br/>
the light went out did, and you would like to share it, please send <br/>
it to me at:<br/>
<br/>
marji @ gaiawolf . org (without the spaces)<br/>
<br/>
I only just had this idea, so I have not run it by Larry, Roxy and <br/>
Ruby, but if they are anemable, I or someone (as per Lisa&#39;s family&#39;s <br/>
wishes) will read them tomorrow at the service.  If they would prefer <br/>
not, then I will print up the collection (in a beautiful way) and I <br/>
will give this to them.  In fact, I&#39;ll do that anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In gratitude for and in celebration of Lisa&#39;s Light and Life,<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  If you would like to be anonymous, please make sure to say so.<br/>
P.P.S.  If you have already sent me something but would *not* like me <br/>
to share that, please let me know. <br/>
