<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925867973">Got another question.  Refresher - I&#39;ve homeschooled for 7 years - my 3<br/>
kids, ages 12, 10, and 6 have always been homeschooled, fwiw.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
OK, say we decide to unschool.  How do you tell your kids about it?  How do<br/>
you explain that instead of doing various subjects, etc., they will be doing<br/>
life?  How do you explain in a positive way that we won&#39;t have summer<br/>
vacation?  (Yes, it was me that asked about summer vacation the other day -<br/>
my family doesn&#39;t obsess about summer - these are just the thoughts going<br/>
through my head since summer is somewhat looked forward to).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So you tell them they aren&#39;t going to be doing school anymore (background of<br/>
dancing and cheers), but then what do you say when they ask what you are<br/>
going to do?  How do you introduce this pretty new and more or less totally<br/>
foreign concept?  Those of you who switched from homeschooling to<br/>
unschooling - how did you do it?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then you start unschooling, things are starting to hum along, more or less,<br/>
then what do you say to the question of &quot;will we get a vacation?&quot;  I&#39;m sure<br/>
some of you will respond with something like &quot;we are already on vacation!&quot;<br/>
But that might not go over with the kids.  Do they just eventually see that<br/>
it is life and true freedom so they won&#39;t be envious at all when they see<br/>
their friends out of school?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I realize a lot of this is just that I am still trying to grasp the concept.<br/>
And I really am intrigued and interested in the concept.  Now I&#39;m trying to<br/>
grasp how the kids will react to unschooling.  Thanks in advance for helping<br/>
this newbie to try to see how this might work.  If unschooling was your idea<br/>
(vs. your child&#39;s), I&#39;m interested to hear how you told them about it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>

addressed - if I missed it and someone has a handy link, I&#39;d like to see it.<br/>

<br/>
I think along the same lines as letting go of control, it&#39;s easier to  <br/>
just say yes more often to what they suggest. Don&#39;t turn it into  <br/>
something that you have to do. Just start living life and let life  <br/>
unfold.<br/>
<br/>
Go places. Do things together. Just have fun.<br/>
<br/>
What if you knew life were going to change in ways that you couldn&#39;t  <br/>
fathom and you couldn&#39;t prepare for it so the advice people gave you  <br/>
was to just spend the time until then doing things you enjoyed. What  <br/>
would you do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482786325"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Those of you who switched from homeschooling to unschooling -<br/>
&gt; how did you do it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We were tired of doing stupid schoolwork.  I used to have what I <br/>
called JOY days which were basically days with no written academic <br/>
work.  We&#39;d still do fun things like go to the movies, library, eat <br/>
at the mall, read a book aloud, play games, etc.  As I read more <br/>
about unschooling (my 3rd big jump into the unschooling philosophy <br/>
actually), I claimed more JOY days.  Sometimes, we&#39;d have our Math <br/>
out and I&#39;d ask the kids if they knew the concept being taught and <br/>
if they said yes, I&#39;d say let&#39;s close that dumb book and do <br/>
something different.  <br/>
<br/>
When I finally made the leap to really call us unschoolers, we held <br/>
a family meeting to discuss our lifestyle changes.  Because the one <br/>
thing I didn&#39;t do the previous 2 times I tried unschooling was to <br/>
change our entire lifestyle into radical unschooling.  We didn&#39;t <br/>
really talk about not doing schoolwork, but instead focused on <br/>
changes in our lives.  The biggest two changes were eliminating <br/>
bedtimes and official meal times.  We discussed these changes as a <br/>
family to make sure that mutual respect and kindness were keys to <br/>
success.  For example, my DH goes to sleep around 11:00pm and wakes <br/>
up at 6:00am to get ready for work.  He doesn&#39;t like a lot of noise <br/>
when he&#39;s trying to sleep.  The kids decided doing quiet activities <br/>
during dad&#39;s sleeping would be kindest thing since everyone was <br/>
getting something they wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
As for schoolwork, I asked a few times if they wanted to do their <br/>
schoolwork.  The first few times were met with very puzzled looks <br/>
like they couldn&#39;t believe they were given an option.  When they <br/>
said no, which I totally expected, I followed it up with &#39;Okay, what <br/>
should we do instead?&#39;  I quit asking about schoolwork after a week <br/>
or so because the kids just picked up on the idea that they were <br/>
truly FREE to choose their own activities.  Ever since, we just live <br/>
each day doing what makes us happy.  Every day is a JOY day.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then you start unschooling, things are starting to hum along, more<br/>
&gt; or less, then what do you say to the question of &quot;will we get a<br/>
&gt; vacation?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of vacation?  In our family, the word vacation means going <br/>
away somewhere different such as the beach, Disney World, or <br/>
Wisconsin to visit my ILs.  So yes, we still take vacations.  We can <br/>
only afford one big trip per year and that is what we call <br/>
vacation.  If we do a day trip somewhere, like hiking or going to <br/>
the acquarium or zoo, we just say we&#39;re spending the day doing X.  <br/>
Those are not vacation days for us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do they just eventually see that it is life and true freedom so<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t be envious at all when they see their friends out of<br/>
&gt; school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would they feel envious?  Some traditional homeschooling <br/>
families do &#39;school&#39; when ps kids are out.  I can see the <br/>
homeschooled kids of those families feeling envious.  But if your <br/>
kids are truly able to do anything they like, even hanging out with <br/>
their friends whenever, why would they ever really feel envious?  <br/>
Being out of school is a break from the stupid school routine and <br/>
boring schoolwork.  If your kids aren&#39;t in a stupid routine or doing <br/>
boring schoolwork, they won&#39;t really require a break, will they?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling was your idea (vs. your child&#39;s), I&#39;m interested to<br/>
&gt; hear how you told them about it. :-)<br/>
&gt; Barbara<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids do not research homeschooling like I do.  I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
about and trying out the different philsophies, trying to find <br/>
something that makes us happy.  Unschooling is the only thing that <br/>
truly brings us JOY.  The kids knew they did schoolwork on school <br/>
days and could play on non-school days.  I didn&#39;t hand them any <br/>
expectations when I decided we&#39;d live an unschooling lifestyle.  I <br/>
think it would be really easy to fall into that &#39;newbie unschooler&#39; <br/>
trap of taking the schedule away and expecting your children to <br/>
joyfully choose the same types of schoolish lessons and activities <br/>
you did before you began unschooling.  If you&#39;re expecting that, you <br/>
will be sorely disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Have you officially &#39;finished&#39; your school year?  Did you previously <br/>
have a &#39;first day of school&#39;?  How about just not having it??  Just <br/>
start living, loving and enjoying your children on a daily basis and <br/>
let one day flow into the next.  I can&#39;t say whether you should or <br/>
should not discuss unschooling with your kids.  I didn&#39;t at first, <br/>
but did start bringing it up because I would occasionally read aloud <br/>
from Rue Kream&#39;s book.  To be honest, they don&#39;t really care what <br/>
it&#39;s called.  They are just happy that I am no longer scheduling <br/>
boring schoolwork or turning fun things into lessons.  They are just <br/>
living ... period.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836931036">We didn&#39;t tell our kids anything. We just stopped saying that it was  <br/>
time for work, and kept doing our morning routine til it was  <br/>
afternoon. Then we did our afternoon routine til it was night. Then  <br/>
we tucked them in, slept all night, and did it again. Our homeschool  <br/>
routine was pretty, well, routine. Wake up, make beds, eat breakfast.  <br/>
play for an hour, do an hour or two of table time, eat lunch, tidy  <br/>
the dining and kitchen. Then some quiet time, older kids reading and  <br/>
younger being read to, then get up, do a couple of chores, prepare  <br/>
dinner, eat, dishes, play around, sleep. Not hard to just drop that  <br/>
hour of table time, and tbh, most of the kids prefer the routine,  <br/>
minus the chores, and the table time is just craft time or video  <br/>
games. Honestly, that schedule got us through a years&#39; worth of  <br/>
curriculum in four months. Now it&#39;s getting us through life one day  <br/>
at a time.<br/>
<br/>
What do you normally do for summer vacation? Do you go somewhere? Do  <br/>
you do anything special besides stop assigning schoolwork? If you  <br/>
travel, why would you not do that? If you go to theme parks, do it.  <br/>
Do what you always do for summer. Because what we&#39;re doing day to day  <br/>
isn&#39;t stuff the kids don&#39;t want to do, so they aren&#39;t desiring that  <br/>
break that they used to have in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t even tell them that we weren&#39;t doing school. When (if) they  <br/>
asked, we just said we were taking a break. When they asked what  <br/>
we&#39;re going to do, I&#39;d say something like, well, I need to go to IGA,  <br/>
is there someplace you wanted to stop? And we went there, no matter  <br/>
what I felt about it. So the first few weeks we went to three  <br/>
petstores, two comic book shops, a hardware store, and the florist.  <br/>
No place really big, but places they&#39;d always wanted to go but I said  <br/>
later or not now, or we&#39;re too busy.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re kids ask when they will get a vacation, ask them what they  <br/>
had in mind. If they are used to traveling, travel. I don&#39;t  <br/>
understand why they would be envious of other schoolers. If they get  <br/>
to stay at home without someone assigning work or making them do  <br/>
meaningless mindnumbing number crunching, what would the problem be?  <br/>
What are YOU seeing as unschooling?What are you seeing them do every  <br/>
day?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376929057">What do you normally do for summer vacation? Do you go somewhere? Do <br/>

<br/>
******** Not really - we swim, sometimes go to a theme park, have relatives<br/>
visit, but mostly just hang out, participate in summer reading programs, and<br/>
try to do as little activities as possible. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is there someplace you wanted to stop? And we went there, no matter <br/>
what I felt about it. So the first few weeks we went to three <br/>

No place really big, but places they&#39;d always wanted to go but I said <br/>
later or not now, or we&#39;re too busy.<br/>
<br/>
********* that sounds like fun.  The kids don&#39;t ask too much to go different<br/>
places, but if I asked them, I might be surprised.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re kids ask when they will get a vacation, ask them what they <br/>
had in mind.<br/>
<br/>
*********OK, I&#39;m seeing the light a little.  We don&#39;t travel a whole lot<br/>
(although I enjoy it and after our recent vacation my hubby and I said we<br/>
want to do it more often.)  But, I&#39;m getting it.  If their idea of a<br/>
vacation is not doing school, so to speak, and we aren&#39;t doing school, so to<br/>
speak... ah ha - I&#39;m getting it!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are YOU seeing as unschooling? What are you seeing them do every day?<br/>
<br/>
********Now that is an easier question to answer.  My oldest has developed a<br/>
somewhat recent interest in acting.  She loves reading, both fiction,<br/>
biographies, and historical fiction.  She also enjoys messing around with<br/>
her website and editing homemade videos she and her sisters and friends<br/>
make.  I could easily see her unschooling.  My 10 yo loves dancing and is<br/>
looking forward to getting point shoes in the near future.  She reads, but<br/>
enjoys more entertainment type books - Calvin and Hobbes, The Great Brain<br/>
(my old books - I LOVED those growing up) - not into the nonfiction-type<br/>
stuff - and yes, I know that is fine - that is just how she is.  :-)  She<br/>
has shown an interest in mechanical-type stuff.  One year we got her a<br/>
toolbox with some tools for Christmas.  My 6 yo - well, who knows what her<br/>
interests are yet.  But she is just 6.  On the one hand, I can easily see<br/>
unschooling at her age b/c I think most homeschooling parents try to way<br/>
overdo it at young ages, but on the other hand, I think it is a little<br/>
harder.  But, I imagine at her age, you just let them play - that is<br/>
learning enough!  :-)  And all of my kids like animals - like their mom. We<br/>
have had lots of different pets over the years and my 10 yo is waiting for<br/>
her bunny she picked out to be weaned.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the responses.  I&#39;m looking forward to talking more with my<br/>
husband after I get done reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook and doing<br/>
some more research.  We talked some about it on a date last week and I think<br/>
he is definitely open to the idea. Well, off to surf the web..<br/>

you, but not to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m sure others will say the same thing - just say you&#39;re  <br/>
starting summer vacation right now, today. Then never stop.<br/>
<br/>
In a few months the kids might ask, &quot;Hey, when is vacation going to  <br/>
be over?&quot; You can say, &quot;I think we&#39;ll just keep on as we are -  I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to interrupt all the cool things you&#39;ve been doing.&quot; IF  <br/>
they get to the point of saying things like, &quot;But, mom, I&#39;m not  <br/>
learning anything!&quot; then it is time to talk to them about unschooling.<br/>

OK, say we decide to unschool.  How do you tell your kids about it?  <br/>
How do<br/>
you explain that instead of doing various subjects, etc., they will be <br/>
doing<br/>
life?  How do you explain in a positive way that we won&#39;t have summer<br/>
vacation?  (Yes, it was me that asked about summer vacation the other <br/>
day -<br/>
my family doesn&#39;t obsess about summer - these are just the thoughts <br/>
going<br/>
through my head since summer is somewhat looked forward to).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As with most things. it depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on your kids, your relationship with your kids, the <br/>
time of year, your issues, their concerns, their friends---lots of <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the best and safest is to just start summer vacation as usual <br/>
and simply don&#39;t stop, come September (or first of August around here! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). Just keep on going as if the summer vacation never ends.<br/>
<br/>
If they ask, just say that it&#39;s been going so well so far. Let&#39;s keep <br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
If they question further, you can actually use the word, unschooling, <br/>
and explain how it works. How you realize that they are natural born <br/>
learners. That they have shown you how incredibly smart and creative <br/>
and curious they are---and that you found other unschooling parents who <br/>
believe that this is the best way that people learn, and they&#39;re <br/>
willing to answer all your questions, so you have latched on to it too.<br/>
<br/>
You can give them some of the books to read or find them some <br/>
unschooling e-penpals or locals to hang with or go to the Live and <br/>
Learn Unschooling Conference, held September 6-10, 2006 in Albuquerque, <br/>
NM.<br/>
<br/>
You can be as natural or as &quot;lay-it-out-for-them-in-black-and-white&quot; as <br/>
you need to be. Depends on the kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
So you tell them they aren&#39;t going to be doing school anymore <br/>
(background of<br/>
dancing and cheers), but then what do you say when they ask what you are<br/>
going to do?  How do you introduce this pretty new and more or less <br/>
totally<br/>
foreign concept?  Those of you who switched from homeschooling to<br/>
unschooling - how did you do it?<br/>

I screwed up! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t let go of the schooly stuff in my  head. I can better tell <br/>
you what NOT to do! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t nag.<br/>
Don&#39;t ask them: &quot;When will you ever pick up a book?&quot;<br/>
Don&#39;t make them write synopses or draw pictures of the short story you <br/>
just read to them.<br/>
Don&#39;t pack the car and say: &quot;Wow! See? That&#39;s geometry!&quot;<br/>
Don&#39;t make them bake brownies and double or halve the recipe to see <br/>
whether they know how to multiply or divide fractions.<br/>
Don&#39;t let your father have them for the afternoon to &quot;teach&quot; them who <br/>
the Lord Proprietors were.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DO read to them or get them books on CD **if** they like  that.<br/>
DO stay in your pjs , make popcorn, order pizza, and watch movies all <br/>
day **if** they like that.<br/>
DO get catalogues and ask that they circle ALL the things they think <br/>
they might like. (toys or books or games or clothes or---whatever!!)<br/>
DO buy cool new games and toys and books and clothes <br/>
and---whatever---you can afford.<br/>
DO go out to ethnic restaurants and just enjoy the food/atmosphere.DO <br/>
feed their passions, even if they are not passions you share.<br/>
<br/>
If they ask, just say that the only thing you want for them is a happy, <br/>
joyful life. And since the shortest distance between two points is a <br/>
straight line (OHMYGAWD! MATH! &lt;G&gt;), you&#39;re going to give them a happy, <br/>
joyful childhood---starting NOW!<br/>

<br/>
Then you start unschooling, things are starting to hum along, more or <br/>
less,<br/>
then what do you say to the question of &quot;will we get a vacation?&quot;  I&#39;m <br/>
sure<br/>
some of you will respond with something like &quot;we are already on <br/>
vacation!&quot;<br/>
But that might not go over with the kids.  Do they just eventually see <br/>
that<br/>
it is life and true freedom so they won&#39;t be envious at all when they <br/>
see<br/>
their friends out of school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask, &quot;What kind of vacation are you thinking of?&quot; And then do it, if <br/>
it&#39;s in the budget.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they eventually *will* see it. But maybe not before they question <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
They may catch hell from friends who tell them they will be stupid <br/>
(&#39;cause that&#39;s what those kids hear from their parents), but as they <br/>
grow and learn, they will see a DISTINCT difference. And all the other <br/>
kids will be envying them because they&#39;re living their lives as if <br/>
school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I realize a lot of this is just that I am still trying to grasp the <br/>
concept.<br/>
And I really am intrigued and interested in the concept.  Now I&#39;m <br/>
trying to<br/>
grasp how the kids will react to unschooling.  Thanks in advance for <br/>
helping<br/>
this newbie to try to see how this might work.  If unschooling was your <br/>
idea<br/>
(vs. your child&#39;s), I&#39;m interested to hear how you told them about it. <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hard to tell how the kids will react. It depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I told Cameron up front. But because I understood the concept, but not <br/>
necessarily how to put it into action (this comes a LOT easier to <br/>
parents whose kids have never been to school or schooled-at-home! <br/>
They&#39;ve been doing it all along!), it was slow going. My heart said one <br/>
thing, but my mouth said another!<br/>
<br/>
Better to stop and breathe before you say a word. *Think* whether what <br/>
you say will help or hurt the siruation/relationship, then speak. <br/>
Apologize when you screw up and move on.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling should take approximately one month for each year your <br/>
child was in school or schooled-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
BUT you also have to remember that *you* were also schooled. You need <br/>
to deschool too. And it will also take *you* one month for each year <br/>
you were in school! Yikes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AND---if you screw up and make him do a worksheet or read against his <br/>
will or force some math problem on him, you get to start all over again <br/>
and start your one month for each year counting again! Yech!<br/>
<br/>
It took 18 months or so to deschool Cameron, who was schooled for eight <br/>
years, because I couldn&#39;t let go.<br/>
<br/>
Trust your child. Respect him. Be patient! Bite your tongue. It&#39;ll be <br/>
over far faster! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
