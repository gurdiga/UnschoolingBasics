<div id="ygrps-yiv-550936800">We transitioned into the radical unschooling lifestyle a couple of <br/>
months ago.  My DH is totally supportive, but does have one <br/>
concern.  Our children, ages 8 and 9, enjoy staying up really late, <br/>
then sleeping late in the mornings.  Originally, my DH&#39;s concern was <br/>
because the kids usually make too much noise for him to sleep and <br/>
he&#39;s the only one of us who is on a strict schedule.  He goes to bed <br/>
around 11:00pm and wakes up at 6:30am to get ready for work.  So we <br/>
talked to the kids, who totally understood the need for Dad to have <br/>
quiet when he&#39;s sleeping, and everything has been fine.  We&#39;ve only <br/>
had one incident where the kids set off our house alarm on accident, <br/>
and it scared them to pieces!!  So now we don&#39;t set the alarm until <br/>
I hear the kids going to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
However, my DH is worried about the habits they might be forming.  <br/>
They are staying up until 1:00am, sometimes 2:00am, every night.  <br/>
They don&#39;t wake until 10:30 or 11:00am in the mornings.  My DH is <br/>
worried that these hours will affect their health if they don&#39;t get <br/>
enough rest.  I believe they are getting enough rest though because <br/>
they are sleeping until they wake up on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve had a scheduled bedtime for years.  Although we enforced <br/>
the &#39;in your room at a certain time&#39; part of bedtime, we had no <br/>
problems with them being awake reading for hours which is often what <br/>
happened.  That&#39;s what helped me convince DH that their bedtime was <br/>
so silly.  They never went to sleep before midnight anyway, so why <br/>
force them to be in their rooms?  It felt wrong.  I&#39;m thinking that <br/>
they feel a need to catch up on the things they couldn&#39;t do before <br/>
because they were in bed.  Of course, I know there are people who <br/>
have natural rhythms that keep them active in the evenings and <br/>
sleeping all morning.  That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  <br/>
Right?  :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That looks like 9 to 10 hours of sleep.  It looks like the kids are getting<br/>
better/more sleep than dad.  :)  When my girls were allowed to have control<br/>
over their sleep patterns they were staying up until 1, 2, sometimes 3 am<br/>
and getting up at 10, 11, noon.  After a while they started listening to<br/>
their bodies after they realized that no one was going to make them go to<br/>
bed.  Now Mary Elayne goes to bed each night around 11-11:30 on her own and<br/>
Emily stays up until 1 or 2 (sometimes still 3) but that is when she does<br/>
the majority of her writing - the house is quiet, no disturbances, she can<br/>
think.  If they know we have something going on the next day they will<br/>
decide if they want to go to bed earlier or just deal with being tired the<br/>
next day.  It all works out in the end.  They enjoy going to resource day or<br/>
our little Funschool that just finished for the year and chose to get up for<br/>
it whether they had 9 or 5 hours of sleep.  There were a few times when<br/>
Emily opted to not go and several times the kids would go and come home and<br/>
catch a nap.<br/>
<br/>
Rest is what is important, not necessarily sleep.  Sleep has its purposes,<br/>
but many people find that just sitting and relaxing a for a while is as<br/>
invigorating as a full sleep cycle.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*lol*  That&#39;s true!  I didn&#39;t even look at it that way.  I guess we&#39;re <br/>
so steeped in that traditional mode of kids going to bed early to wake <br/>
up early for school.  I&#39;ll point that out to my DH and maybe he&#39;ll <br/>
feel better about it.<br/>
<br/>
Both kids are now awake and they seem happy to me.  They don&#39;t look <br/>
overly tired or dragging, something that I think happens to my DH when <br/>
he has to wake up really early in the mornings.  I am grateful that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t begrudge us our opportunity to set our own sleeping patterns.  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t have a problem with my staying up later than him or the <br/>
fact that he can leave for work in the mornings while we&#39;re all still <br/>
asleep.  He&#39;s cool that way.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080008514">Hi,<br/>
most people in our house stay up real late too - I<br/>
remember being in Cuba and the kids there were often<br/>
running around until late into the night and then<br/>
sleeping late. SAme with Spain. Maybe it is more<br/>
natural  there because it is so hot in the day and<br/>
cooler at night -?<br/>
I wonder about the same things you do too though,<br/>
especially for the younger ones. <br/>
