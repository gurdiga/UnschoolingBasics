<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640388304">&quot;I don&#39;t feel sorry for Ren. I just am wondering if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
believe that everything  we do influences our children. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this topic has been pretty well covered already (glad to have<br/>
friends that know me well) but I&#39;m completely amused by the topic and<br/>
flow of conversation. I guess because of the irony and contrast I&#39;m<br/>
experiencing at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from a lovely weekend camping with a bunch of<br/>
unschoolers up in the gorgeous mountains of NC (about an hour from<br/>
here). Seeing my kids bonding with new friends and reaffirming<br/>
existing friendships in such a joyful and life embracing manner,<br/>
totally warms my heart. They love their tribe as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe the communal feeling of hanging out with a group<br/>
of people that totally &quot;get&quot; your lifestyle. It&#39;s hard to describe the<br/>
truly amazing bonds my children have with other unschooled kids, just<br/>
how much they deeply love their friends and how the influence each other.<br/>
<br/>
I came home refreshed, joyful and grateful for the unschoolers I&#39;ve<br/>
met over the years. Reading this thread was a bit of a jolt, after<br/>
being surrounded by such incredible spirits all weekend.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, Ren believes that children are influenced by a number<br/>
of things including their parents. She also believes that children are<br/>
born with their very own spirit and genetic makeup and ideas and<br/>
talents and no amount of influence will change that basic makeup.<br/>
She also has children that don&#39;t live with a bunch of rules and are<br/>
very adept at understanding personal boundaries.  <br/>
<br/>
She also wishes she&#39;d been present at Deb L&#39;s house for the<br/>
Merlot-through-the-nose incident and wants to hug Elissa Jill again<br/>
(though that feeling swirls up almost everytime Elissa posts).<br/>
<br/>
Can I write from the first person again? Since there was discussion<br/>
about what *I* thought it felt right to go third person here......but<br/>
now it&#39;s feeling strange.;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386901564">LOL....hahahahaha.... yes, I know I&#39;d love to hear you in the first person<br/>
again!  I was wondering where you were during all of this discussion...  so<br/>
glad you all had such a great time!  I&#39;m jealous.... but I did finally meet<br/>
the closest unschooler to me that I know of!  :)  Yeah, unschoolers are<br/>
cool!  :)<br/>
