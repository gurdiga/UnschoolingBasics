<div id="ygrps-yiv-381007863">Once in a while someone will respond to a post on one of the<br/>
unschooling lists (UB, AU, etc) with a sentence or a phrase that just<br/>
makes things &quot;click&quot; for me. I&#39;ve been trying to keep these words<br/>
handy so I can refer back to them, think about it and discuss it with<br/>
DH, but it&#39;s becoming more difficult as I add to my &quot;save this&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
For a while I was saving the emails but my folders starting getting<br/>
unwieldy and often all I wanted was a small snippet of the email which<br/>
meant reading through the whole post again to find it. Searching for<br/>
the particular phrase/sentence was getting complicated and I can&#39;t<br/>
always remember the exact wording so I can&#39;t get the results I want<br/>
during a search of my folders, etc. I&#39;ve been printing things out but<br/>
that gets lost in the clutter of our house despite my attempt to keep<br/>
printouts in a binder.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to gently lift the ideas/phrases/solutions I&#39;ve found<br/>
most useful and put them on a page of my blog so I can refer to them<br/>
again & again and also share them with friends/family without having<br/>
to track down an email or hunt for a piece of paper. Everything would<br/>
be used anonymously - it would just be a collection of<br/>
unschooling/parenting philosophy & principals that have been really<br/>
meaningful to me. I&#39;ve been interested in doing this and I know others<br/>
do it occasionally but I thought I should ask if it&#39;s okay.<br/>

Usually when you quote someone, it&#39;s not cool to do it anonymously,<br/>
you should give credit to the person who originally wrote/said the phrase.<br/>
Technically, anything written on a public forum could be quoted. If a<br/>
person has issues with their name being on the internet, I assume<br/>
they&#39;d not use their real name for posts anyway. <br/>
<br/>
If you use other people&#39;s writings, give credit to the person and a<br/>
link back to their website or blog when possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211856114"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; you should give credit to the person who originally wrote/said the phrase.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can do that. I planned to do it anonymously because there have been<br/>
many times that I preferred to be quoted that way and thought other<br/>
people might not want their name on someone else&#39;s blog. But I&#39;m happy<br/>
to do it whichever way etiquette calls for.  :)<br/>
