<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398795883">&quot;  Really, I&#39;m asking now, is there anyone on<br/>
this list who wouldn&#39;t have made a judgement about that kind of behavior?<br/>
 Would we spend a minute debating whether it was right to judge? <br/>
<br/>
Our society lets this kind of discrimination, disrespect, abuse of kids<br/>
go on and on because we tell ourselves we shouldn&#39;t be judgmental about<br/>
the way others parent.  <br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love you Deb.<br/>
