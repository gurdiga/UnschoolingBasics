I so agree and this is why radical unschooling is so wonderful for *me (a <br/>

started paying attention to the way things &#39;make&#39; me feel and my knee-jerk <br/>

our family and DD is having a difficult time and has a meltdown.....in front of <br/>
everyone, with everyone looking disapprovingly.  It&#39;s when I start feeling <br/>
judged and imagining that they&#39;re thinking that I can&#39;t control my own child or <br/>
that I&#39;m a poor parent.  My first reaction was to notice their reaction, <br/>
instead of ignoring THEM and focusing on helping my DD :(  Something I&#39;m not proud <br/>
of, too :(  BUT now that I&#39;ve become more aware of it, it doesn&#39;t happen very <br/>
often.  DD still has meltdowns, but MY reactions are different so the meltdowns <br/>
do not last NEARLY as long, and we&#39;re becoming more connected.  She&#39;s <br/>
learning that I *really want to help her... more than I&#39;m embarrassed about us making <br/>
a scene or caring what others may think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809736003">But an interesting by-product of THAT is that when I see OTHER children melting down in public, I find myself really trying to understand and instead of MY being judgmental of other parents, I find myself really empathizing with how I know they must be feeling.  And understanding that sometimes their &quot;meanness&quot; to their own children is because they are feeling judged and scorned.  I try to make eye contact and communicate that we&#39;ve all been there and don&#39;t worry about what others are thinking and I try to make eye contact with children that seem to be &quot;losing it&quot; so that on some level, maybe they can feel they are being heard.  My heart just goes out to them.<br/>
 <br/>
I also find myself talking to and with others&#39; children rather than around them as I used to.  I can get on that level where I truly DO want to hear about the Rescue Heroes movie from the 6 year old as much as I am interested in what his mom is saying.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling has also made me aware of how others try to talk around my children and I am able to gently re&quot;educate&quot; them not to do that.  We went to a BBQ on Labour Day and my son (who takes violin) had a lesson so we left and came back for the rest of the BBQ.  Everyone wanted to hear my son play and they kept saying to me, &quot;oh, have him play for us-we&#39;d love to hear him!&quot;  They meant well but instead of my asking him (so I wouldn&#39;t communicate to him whether I wanted it or not and wouldn&#39;t seem like I was advocating for the other adults) I told them they should ask HIM if he wanted to play.  There were actually two women who seemed surprised at the notion of asking a 7 year old what HE wanted to do.  But they did and he said &quot;I&#39;d really rather not-I don&#39;t feel ready yet to play for other people-I play for me right now.&quot;  I LOVED that he could feel that he was able to answer and not bow to pressure just because it was an adult.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
There used to be a show when I was little called &quot;Kids are people too!&quot;  Funny how we can forget that as we&#39;re ushered into adulthood.  I&#39;m remembering again and relearning it thanks to unschooling.<br/>
