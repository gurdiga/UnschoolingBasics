<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953247901">I thought this post was worth sharing, given the recent discussion about the<br/>
swim team and the nudity on the 60 acres.  Scott Noelle hits it right on...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>

:: Beyond Right and Wrong ::<br/>
<br/>
Children are born knowing that feeling good is more<br/>
important than being &quot;right.&quot; They know their emotions<br/>
are their Inner Guidance, and they trust it.<br/>
<br/>
So why do they sometimes rebel and seem to care<br/>
more about being right? One possibility is that you<br/>
may be telling them something that contradicts their<br/>
Inner Guidance.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you say &quot;It&#39;s time to go,&quot; while their<br/>
Inner Guidance tells them to stay, they know you&#39;re<br/>
talking crazy talk!<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;You shouldn&#39;t touch that,&quot; while their<br/>
instinct is to explore, one of you is lying... and<br/>
it&#39;s not them!<br/>
<br/>
You can end conflict and transcend right/wrong<br/>
thinking by tuning in to *your* Inner Guidance. Give<br/>
it some time... The heart is slower than the head, but<br/>
it&#39;s wiser, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you go deep enough, you&#39;ll find the place where<br/>
your Guidance and their Guidance overlap -- the<br/>
common ground where everyday miracles are born.<br/>
