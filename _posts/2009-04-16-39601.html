<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890754332">I am at my wits end with this issue. I have four children. I have followed  <br/>
unschooling principles with all of them with food. If they ask for <br/>
something I  give it to them. They have unlimited access to anything in the house <br/>
and as we  have all learned kids with no restrictions choose healthful foods <br/>
far more often  than unhealthy ones. However I have been having problems with <br/>
my four year old  (he is #3 in birth order)  for more than a year and it is <br/>
really testing  our relationship. I need feedback and ideas. <br/>
 <br/>
The problem I am having is that my four year old is asking for all kinds of <br/>
 things ranging from candy to cereal to burritos or spaghetti, pop, <br/>
chocolate  milk, bananas, sandwiches etc, etc. And without fail once you prepare <br/>
the item  for him he looks at it and says &quot;I do not want that.&quot; I take it back <br/>
and tell  him to please let me know what he wants when he decides. However <br/>
I have building  anger. I can not tolerate waste, it makes me feel very <br/>
upset but eating his food  leftovers is also making me upset. I do not mind <br/>
eating all of his fruits and  vegetables but I have no interest in most of his <br/>
waste. I offer it to all the  other children and sometimes they want it and <br/>
sometimes they do not. I hate  throwing away food but a bowl of cereal <br/>
soaking in milk is not going to be  useful to anyone after ten minutes. <br/>
 <br/>
What are your thoughts? What is his motivation for asking for things? Does  <br/>
he intend to eat them when he requests it or is he just testing me to see <br/>
if I  will prepare it for him? I really have no idea! <br/>
 <br/>
Help! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352927945">Is it a waste of ink when your child draws, or a waste of paper when they paint?<br/>
<br/>
Can you shift seeing &quot;food&quot; as SOMETHING WE DO NOT WASTE, EVER to one more exciting thing for your child to explore? (Even if he&#39;s not actively exploring it?)<br/>
<br/>
This was a hurdle for me, too - &quot;not wasting food&quot; having basically been beaten into me as a child. Once I was able to shift my views on it, I certainly experienced a lot more peace. I don&#39;t mind at all draining the milk out of a bowl of cereal, and throwing the rest out back. This was a big shift for me, btw. It helped me to not see food as in some separate category - it was just further material in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest used to &quot;waste&quot; drinks - he&#39;d pour these HUGE glasses of whatever, then mostly leave them around. Or he&#39;d HAVE to get the bottle of juice while we were out, then he&#39;d take maybe one drink from it. As he&#39;s grown, he&#39;s grown out of doing that so much. He can better gauge exactly what he wants, and how much... but it was only by going through the phase of &quot;too much&quot; that he was able to determine that for himself.<br/>
<br/>
You may not ever know the reason he&#39;s asking for things, then saying &quot;no&quot;. Can you trust there IS a reason, and it&#39;s a valid reason for him?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a compost heap? That might help to feel like it&#39;s not &quot;going to waste&quot; - it&#39;s going to help feed other plants!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904891909">It could be that he wants your attention focused on him specifically<br/>
(since there&#39;s four of them and only one of you, unless you&#39;ve got a<br/>
couple clones stashed your focus is always going to be divided). If<br/>
there is any way to get him a chunk of your time focused on him (whether<br/>
it&#39;s 20 minutes after dinner when there&#39;s another adult to watch the<br/>
littlest one and the olders can manage for a short time themselves or<br/>
early in the morning before the baby wakes or whatever), that may go a<br/>
long way toward addressing this aspect, if attention is his goal moreso<br/>
than the food itself.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be that he has a mental image of &#39;burrito&#39; that doesn&#39;t<br/>
match what shows up on the plate when you hear &#39;burrito&#39; - asking him to<br/>
direct you step by step can be helpful...&quot;do you want cheese? White<br/>
cheddar or orange cheddar? Sliced or shredded? Melted or not melted?...&quot;<br/>
yes it takes time; it&#39;s a process. But, in the end, you&#39;re more likely<br/>
to have what he&#39;s asked for (if indeed he was wanting food and not<br/>
solely the focused attention) so it&#39;s less likely to end up unwanted.<br/>
<br/>
There have also been times when I&#39;ve asked DS (who is now approaching<br/>
11) to please get a glass of water and consider if he is really wanting<br/>
what he&#39;s asked for (particularly if it takes significant preparation<br/>
and I know he&#39;s just eaten a goodly amount not too long ago). While he&#39;s<br/>
doing that, I make sure to keep my focus on him, not go back to whatever<br/>
I was doing. That way, if attention was his goal, he&#39;s got it and if<br/>
he&#39;s still hungry, he&#39;ll get that, and if he was actually just a bit<br/>
thirsty, he&#39;s satisfied there too. (it&#39;s not uncommon even among adults<br/>
to reach for something to eat when what they&#39;re needing is hydration -<br/>
over time, DS has gotten better at identifying which is which and also<br/>
at keeping a reusable water bottle at hand to stay hydrated).<br/>
<br/>
It may also be a case of being over-hungry. Y&#39;know how when you&#39;re<br/>
really super overtired it can be hard to sleep? Same can apply to food -<br/>
once you&#39;re hungry, you want food and you&#39;ll grab any and all food...but<br/>
the first thing may not really be what you need, so you grab something<br/>
else and so on... Stopping to clarify &quot;okay, you want a burrito. Let me<br/>
take your order, sir...would you prefer x or y? would you like m or n<br/>
with that?&quot; and so on...Often DS and I would do a &#39;decision tree&#39; type<br/>
discussion - &quot;you&#39;re hungry. Okay. Would you like something warm or<br/>
cool? Warm. Okay. Soft or crunchy? Soft. Got it. Sweet or more<br/>
salty-ish? More salty-ish...hmm how about scrambled eggs with cheese?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another big issue around that age (3-5) is autonomy - being able to get<br/>
his own food as well as, perhaps, wanting to be the youngest again where<br/>
mommy provided for him and he didn&#39;t have to be a &#39;big boy&#39; but got<br/>
taken care of more. It may be the asking that is part of the issue - if<br/>
there are ways that you can make things readily available (for all the<br/>
kids old enough to eat solid stuff, don&#39;t know how old the littlest is)<br/>
that might help - set a tray of assorted cut fruits and veggies on a low<br/>
but safe table (if necessary to keep the youngest from choking hazards),<br/>
include crackers, string cheese, favorite cookies, etc. That way they<br/>
can just get instead of asking every time (that would also potentially<br/>
free you up from some of the food getting stuff so you have that 20<br/>
minutes per day to spend one on one).<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas to mull<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of giving him one thing that he&#39;s asked for, give him a bunch of things on a plate before he asks. Prepare platters filled with things he likes and things you think he might enjoy.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a> might give you some good ideas. Part of it might be that he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s hungry for and so he is suggesting things that seem appealing in theory but in practice aren&#39;t what he had in mind. It may change the dynamics if you are pro-actively offering things than if you are waiting for him to request specific things. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And without fail once you prepare <br/>
&gt; the item  for him he looks at it and says &quot;I do not want that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Without fail? Every time? I&#39;m not being picky with your words to make you feel bad, but if you can be honest about how frequently something is occuring it will help to minimize the anger you feel building over something. You also wrote &quot;I can not tolerate waste&quot;, but clearly you have been. Not that you shouldn&#39;t be, it&#39;s good that you are letting him waste food. It is much better than making a 4 year old sit and stare at food he requested but didn&#39;t want and eat it. <br/>
<br/>
Are there other things you can do to make the waste less wasteful feeling? What about a compost or can you get a wormery? I know that worms can&#39;t take everything, but they can take some things that composts can&#39;t. We have a dog and he is very happy at receiving the leavings of others. Our cats like any extra cheese. Bread can be scattered for the birds, and right now for the little moorhen in the pond next to the house. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is his motivation for asking for things? Does  <br/>
&gt; he intend to eat them when he requests it or is he just testing me to see <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would assume his motivation is hunger. It could be boredom, though. I&#39;ve been known to eat when I&#39;m bored. Linnaea has too. You could try and record what else is going on when he asks for food, see if there is a pattern. You could step up your engagement with him and see if it makes a difference in how frequently he requests and then turns down food. I doubt that he is doing it to test you or try you or see what hoops you will jump if and when he asks. And if he were, which I totally don&#39;t believe he is, so what. You get to respond with love and commitment and generosity whatever the intention he has. And it helps a lot if you aren&#39;t supposing that he is working from slightly less than the best intentions.  But I would honestly guess that he&#39;s hungry or thirsty or a bit uncomfortable and thinks that food will help. <br/>

For a long time Mo would say No to any food that required cooking if we asked before it was cooked. Once she could see and smell it, though, she often said Yes. So we learned to always make an extra portion for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933368746">One thing I&#39;ve learned is to give smaller portions. One of the other mommies<br/>
(we have 3 in our family) would make cereal for our guys  and later in the<br/>
morning I would end up throwing away because the guys couldn&#39;t finish it and<br/>
it had gotten soggy. It drove me nuts. First I stepped back and said, &quot;This<br/>
is my issue. It&#39;s not about her and how she does things. It&#39;s not about the<br/>
guys and what or how much they eat or don&#39;t eat. It&#39;s about my expectations<br/>
about food and how it should be used, and my issues around money and what is<br/>
wasteful.&quot; Once I got through this step. I started giving them smaller bowls<br/>
with less cereal whenever I made breakfast. &quot;You can always have more.&quot; I&#39;d<br/>
leave the cereal and milk on the table next to them. For the first few<br/>
times, they would have than they could eat. That was fine. After a while,<br/>
they would just fill the bowls up and eat that. Then they would go off and<br/>
play and eat more (cereal or something else) later. It also helped to<br/>
realize that my guys are grazers. They want little bits of lots of foods<br/>
available all day. If they ask for something or make something and then<br/>
don&#39;t eat it, I eat it if I want it, save it for later if it&#39;s savable, or<br/>
get rid of it if it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just a little bit of food. I also try to<br/>
make sure that I anticipate their hunger and have cooked things ready at the<br/>
times they usually want them.<br/>

We had a small flock of 12 laying hens when we lived in a suburban <br/>
neighborhood, and our neighbors loved them. We were lucky not to have <br/>
covenants with regards to birds, but it would be possible to keep just 3 <br/>
or 4 hens under the radar most likely.<br/>

They&#39;re also great fun for kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325635957">We&#39;re doing sort of a competition - us vs. us - to try to see how many<br/>
weeks we can go before taking out the trash. So far our record is 3<br/>
weeks. We&#39;re trying to get it to once a month. And, a big part of that<br/>
is composting anything compostable (cereals, beans and grain, veggie and<br/>
fruit bits, no fatty foods as they will get rancid and nasty smelling)<br/>
in addition to recycling and reusing (and repurposing).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634749127">Oh yeah portion size is important. We&#39;ve found ways to make &#39;mini&#39;<br/>
everything in one way or another and quick as well. For instance, some<br/>
canned solid pumpkin mixed with a bit of cinnamon/spices and spread on a<br/>
graham cracker makes an excellent sub for pumpkin pie - actual pie takes<br/>
better than an hour to make (way too long for DS to wait). Hmm maybe<br/>
that&#39;s a corollary issue to the situation - prep time. Stuff that takes<br/>
more than a minute or two might be part of the issue. Proactively<br/>
offering food as has been suggested is one possible help for that. Also,<br/>
keeping commonly used ingredients handy in their usable form (a<br/>
container of already shredded cheese, sliced veggies, etc) so that<br/>
things can be made really quickly - if the cheese is already shredded<br/>
and the beans cooked, a bean & cheese burrito can be made in the<br/>
microwave in seconds.<br/>
