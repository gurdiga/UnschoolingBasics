<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643020937">OK, before I even get a chance to absorb and think on the Laura issue, I  now <br/>
have a different one. Less awful, but...my DH and I are arguing a bit over  <br/>
how to deal with this. <br/>
 <br/>
Grace, my 15 year old, took and drank 3 beers from my fridge last night. <br/>
 <br/>
So far, I reminded her that asking to taste one is one thing, but all 3  <br/>
wasn&#39;t ok with me, plus they were not hers (and she has no way to &quot;repay&quot; me  <br/>
really, at least literally). I also reminded her that I would like for her to  let <br/>
me know first if she wanted to taste a beer (as she did last week, a  <br/>
Chocolate Stout, I allowed her a small glass and that was ok) or whatever, and  that <br/>
we needed to respect each other&#39;s items. <br/>
 <br/>
I am already comfortable with allowing small amounts of drinking, so please  <br/>
don&#39;t tell me about her age and all of that. I have looked up my local laws <br/>
and  all of that, so I am ok with that. I need help on how to cope with this  <br/>
type of &quot;stealing&quot; and how to help us all come to understandings over this. <br/>
 <br/>
Let me also say that she has been SUPER restricted (as in, a soda was  <br/>
allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays after she did her chores - this was at her  Dad&#39;s <br/>
and she was there for a year, which was pre-unschooling here, and has only  <br/>
been here full time since the second week of June) and while she wants to go to  <br/>
conventional high school in the fall, I am still doing all I can to <br/>
decompress  her and to allow her time to deschool, which as ya&#39;ll know, I am hoping can <br/>
 happen to the point of dropping in out of conventional high school. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks all...I know I&#39;m full of drama these days...<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My response would be that if you have checked with local laws and <br/>
her age then she might need time to experiment with the alcohol. I <br/>
would say do not sneak but ask and I will say yes. Also she might <br/>
need time &quot;apart&quot; from you to experiment with how much she is <br/>
comfortable drinking. She may want to look mature to you <br/>
and &quot;know&quot;how much she can handle but without going overboard how <br/>
will she know where her limit is? Maybe she would feel comfortable <br/>
taking the alcohol to her room where she is not &quot;on show&quot; so to <br/>
speak. She could then feel the effects without being out in front of <br/>
everyone<br/>
<br/>
Have to go hold a kick I hold that might help<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sensing you were needed here by a younger person, Julie ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Pretty much how I feel, but I am still trying to get comfortable <br/>
with my teens drinking. I drank like a wild fish when I was her age, and much, <br/>
much more. (my parents knew some, not all, I was semi trusting of them and <br/>
they semi of me). She has chosen to tell me of some of her expiriences and I feel <br/>
grateful and lucky to have the start of a more comfortable relationship with <br/>
her. I do feel that, especially as a result of her uptight former year AND my <br/>
previous more structured/lacking trust style (NOTHING like her fathers...I&#39;ve <br/>
ALWAYS been closer to unschooling, I just never knew it or trusted it), that <br/>
she may be testing boundaries, as was mentioned with the other member and her <br/>
daughter&#39;s friend. My DH is TOTALLY against it, for a few reasons. He wants, <br/>
and this is reasonable, to know that if he purchases some special beer (and even <br/>
the not so special ones, lol) like he is oft to do, lol, (Road Dog, Skinny <br/>
Dip, Great White and more, lol we both are lovers of microbrews) that one, they <br/>
will be there when he returns from work or wherever, and two, that there won&#39;t <br/>
be a slue or even one drunk teenager. He is also not adjusting to unschooling <br/>
all that well btw, but that is yet another post - can you sense the new <br/>
changes in the family, lol?! <br/>
<br/>
James, too, is expirimenting with alcohol, but i THINK we have reached a <br/>
decent understanding. I feel ok so far at least..pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying all, I&#39;m new, and this area is really new to me. I feel totally <br/>
confident with so many other subjects, but this concerns me - both their <br/>
adjustment and mine, is what concerns me. <br/>
<br/>
Still thinking this out, talking this out with ya&#39;ll...thank you...<br/>
<br/>
K. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>So buy alcohol that is &quot;hers&quot;- well maybe yours and you can share <br/>
with her. Or ask husband what would make him comfortable<br/>
<br/>
it is hard for men to wrap their heads around unschooling they need <br/>
to see it happening over time. Hang in there<br/>
