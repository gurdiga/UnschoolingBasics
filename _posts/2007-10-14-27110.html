<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028637060">OK let me try this again...<br/>
<br/>
We are adopting a toddler (she turned 3 20 Aug 07) and we will probably<br/>
travel to get her in December or January.  She is possibly a child with<br/>
autism.  But might just be a child raised in an institution.  She has little<br/>
language.  She had more a year ago but speaks rarely now.  So what her<br/>
actual situation is...I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
How would you deal with her?  I want to foster attachment.  I want to treat<br/>
her with gentleness.  She does not know any English.  I do not know how much<br/>
Cantonese she knows, where she&#39;s from they speak a particular dialect of<br/>
cantonese anyway so we will not be able to communicate verbally.  I will<br/>
bring a book of pictures of things to help us communicate.<br/>
<br/>
As much as possible I will use redirection if she&#39;s doing something she<br/>
shouldn&#39;t (ie isn&#39;t safe) and keep the &quot;no&quot; to a minimum.  However, it would<br/>
not be outside the realm of normal for her to begin biting, kicking,<br/>
scratching and spitting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know what you all think is the right path...or at least the path<br/>
to begin walking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024475455">Have you considered teaching her sign language.  Also I would leave cereal and juice out for her at all times since she will probably not be able to communicate her need for food.  I know I had to do that for my now 9 year old, because she had been neglected by her birth parents, and was not being fed very often......I could still cry thinking about those little ribs that were sticking out.  I could not convince her we had enough food in our house, so I just left her out food and drink at all times.  It was not that she was necessarily gonna eat the food, but for her own sense of security she needed to know it was available at all times.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Also you might want to read up on Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), well and about children that have been in orphanages/instituitions.  I think you will do just fine.  I found that all it took with my girls was bringing them into my home.  My husband and I immediately fell in love with them, and even though we did not immediately adopt them (because the foster care system is so slow), we always considered them ours from the very beginning.  I think you will love her right away, and you will find a way.  How many other children do you have? ages?  Sometimes another child is all it takes to find a way to connect and communicate with a child like this.  <br/>

be a big change for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587971443">My now 3 y.o. is not very verbal although that is soon<br/>
changing. Here are some things he has liked:<br/>
To start teaching sign language, the &#39;signing time&#39;<br/>
videos are wonderful and I believe would still work<br/>
well if someone does not know English as it is very<br/>
visual and shows lots of different kids making the<br/>
same sign combined with pictures of the sign. It us<br/>
also quite entertaining -<br/>
There are a bunch of simple board books (Beginning<br/>
Sings?) also.<br/>
Another good idea is to take pictures of everything in<br/>
your house that could be of relevance to her (toys,<br/>
food, clothes, kitchen and bathroom accessories,<br/>
people in  your family and friends etc.), laminate<br/>
them and put them in a special book for her (with<br/>
velcro attached to the back so that she could easily<br/>
rip them out and show you what she wants).<br/>
If you put the words underneath they might come in<br/>
handy again when she is interested in learning to<br/>
read.<br/>
Simple songs (like Old McDonald etc.) where she might<br/>
have fun repeating the sounds.<br/>
Games that encourage verbal play. Even if you are the<br/>
only one talking...<br/>
So much for now,<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Mara<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends to some extent if she&#39;s biting (for example) you or <br/>
someone else. If its someone else I&#39;d be sure to show some clear <br/>
empathy and compassion toward the person who had been bitten. If she <br/>
were to bite *me* I&#39;d work on communicating that I wasn&#39;t happy <br/>
about being bit. The tricky bit is how to communicate that non-<br/>
verbally w/o making it an act of love-withdrawal. <br/>
<br/>
In and around all of this I&#39;d be looking for ways to prevent <br/>
*people* from being hurt (or spit on, eeeeeewwwww!). So I&#39;d look for <br/>
what needs she was trying to communicate and look for ways to meet <br/>
those. Maybe she would be needing to express some very intense <br/>
feelings! In which case I&#39;d look for other ways for her to do that - <br/>
other things to bite or hit, maybe. Ways or places for her to <br/>
meltdown safely with the knowledge that she&#39;s being supported - that <br/>
*you* accept her even when she&#39;s totally freaking out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, back to spitting for a moment - I&#39;m totally grossed out by mouth <br/>
stuff, but I have found ways for my kids to play with spit. Sinks <br/>
and bathtubs and outside are all fine for spit-play, but not the <br/>
living room or bedroom (eeeeewwwww!) for example. You have two boys, <br/>
so if your new family member wants to play with spitting (as opposed <br/>
to it being a way of expressing something else) maybe they can show <br/>
her how to spit seeds or even hawk some really good lugies - <br/>
outside, of course. <br/>
