<div id="ygrps-yiv-701998646">Looking for an objective point of view on this subject. It&#39;s long...<br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ve been perseverating about this issue for several weeks since my <br/>
cousin&#39;s 4yo dtr stayed several days with us...and now I&#39;ve agreed <br/>
to watch her for several days, yet again. I love my dear cousin, and <br/>
care about her child, but I truly suffered through the days of <br/>
watching her. My 4.10yo son and she play well together, that&#39;s not <br/>
the issue, or it would be simple. It seems to be only adults she <br/>
acts out toward.<br/>
 <br/>
 I can grasp all of the possible explanations for her behaviors, but <br/>
I don&#39;t know how to HANDLE them.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Last visit she would demand something (say a corny dog from Sonic). <br/>
In my good humor I would oblige and we&#39;d all go to Sonic. I get what <br/>
she wants, only to have her throw it on the floor and demand my son <br/>
give her his cheeseburger instead, because she changed her mind.  <br/>
Something resembling this scenario happened at every meal. I am very <br/>
accommodating, but I don&#39;t give-in to these types of tantrums. Offer <br/>
simple solutions to diffuse the situation, yes, but go the extra <br/>
mile to please her, no. <br/>
 <br/>
 I took the kids swimming. When it was time to go (both kids were in <br/>
my arms), I announced they have 5 min, 2min, 1min left, so they&#39;d <br/>
have time to wrap up playtime. When the moment to get out of the <br/>
pool arrived I said so and began to exit the pool with both kids. <br/>
She yelled &#39;no!&#39; in a very angry voice and splashed me in the face <br/>
with water, using a fist that stayed in hitting position way too <br/>
long for me. I discussed it with her afterward, but only got <br/>
defiance in return, as she went to the chairs on the other side of <br/>
the pool, and required I carry her out, because she wouldn&#39;t get up <br/>
from the chair. No amount of gentle reasoning changed anything.<br/>
 <br/>
 At home, my 10mo was with my dh, and had just slept. For my having <br/>
cut her requested sandwich in half, she ran to the guest bedroom and <br/>
began a screaming fit. I at first voiced concern for her,not knowing <br/>
why she was screaming. But when she turned and screamed in my face, <br/>
I lost my patience. I was just about to carry her outside to finish <br/>
her fit (sleeping baby), when I heard my baby wake up. I put her <br/>
back on the bed and swatted her on the behind, which to this day I <br/>
lament over.<br/>
 <br/>
 If I could ignore her behaviors, I would. But she esculates if I <br/>
do. And there&#39;s no telling what lengths she&#39;ll go to. She gets <br/>
aggressive, destructive, and loud. Talking to her in a gentle or <br/>
assertive tone doesn&#39;t make a difference. She acts like I don&#39;t <br/>
exist, and continues on with either the behavior I&#39;ve asked her to <br/>
please stop, or the tantrum because I&#39;ve asked her to stop. <br/>
 <br/>
 The only solution I can think of is to keep us at home all the days <br/>
she&#39;s here, and give her timeout on the couch if she begins a <br/>
tantrum (I don&#39;t DO timeout...does it really work for kids like <br/>
this?)<br/>
 <br/>
 If ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS, I would so appreciate it. An <br/>
objective point of view would benefit me greatly. Thanks, Lisa O</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86092915">One of my earliest memories involves me having a tantrum and how my<br/>
grandmother responded to it. I was about 4. My parents left me with my<br/>
grandparents for several weeks. If I remember correctly my mother was<br/>
ill, my father was working and there was no one at home to watch me...<br/>
but I didn&#39;t want to be there. <br/>
<br/>
I began having tantrums at every meal just like you are describing.<br/>
Then one day while I was acting out my grand mother took me kicking<br/>
and screaming to the barn and deposited me in an empty stall with the<br/>
words &quot;You are acting like an animal. The animals live in the barn.<br/>
When you decide you are no longer an animal you may come back to live<br/>
with the humans in the house.&quot; said in the kindest voice she could<br/>
muster. She didn&#39;t yell. She didn&#39;t hit me. She just closed the stall<br/>
door and didn&#39;t lock it so I could get out when I wanted. Then she<br/>
walked back to the house. <br/>
<br/>
Once she was inside the house, I continued my tantrum kicking the<br/>
walls and throwing hay around until I had exhausted myself and found<br/>
that the animals were giving me curious looks. <br/>
<br/>
I stayed in the barn until I got hungry. The tantrum happened over<br/>
breakfast and I went in around lunch time. (a long time for a young<br/>
child anyway) When I went back to the house my grandmother asked if I<br/>
had decided to be a human again. I don&#39;t remember what I told her. But<br/>
I do remember that was the very last temper tantrum I ever had at<br/>
anyone. It was exactly what I needed at the time... to be alone until<br/>
I chose to be with people. The time limit was self imposed. <br/>
<br/>
BTW My granddad kept checking on me. He thought I couldn&#39;t see him<br/>
peeking in the big door as he walked by. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess time out does work. It did with me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968087808">Hi,<br/>
      Here is my perspective. Maybe it will be of some help.<br/>
      I have a daughter who is almost four. She nurses still and has <br/>
been attachment parented since birth. She is very slow to warm up and <br/>
can only be left with my husband if I am not available.  I stay at <br/>
home with her and her two sisters so this isn&#39;t often a problem. She <br/>
is a wonderful, strong, happy creative child. She gets very physical <br/>
and very upset when things don&#39;t go her way when she is tired or <br/>
hungry or overstimulated. Her behavior is a little different from <br/>
what you are describing, but in many ways it is similar. My daughter <br/>
often responds very powerfully to seemingly small things. Her <br/>
sandwich being cut when she does not want it cut is truly devastating <br/>
to her and she will not eat it.  She will almost always want what her <br/>
older sister has even if she really wanted something else a few <br/>
minutes ago.  She really is not capable of being quiet when my baby <br/>
is sleeping. She can do it for a few minutes but forgets and is loud, <br/>
or gets upset about something and is really loud.<br/>
      I think that many children around this age get very passionate <br/>
about tiny details. They are learning about their own preferences and <br/>
their ability to control their own environment. Some children are <br/>
pretty flexible during this process, others are not. For my daughter <br/>
it truly seems to her like the world will end if her preference is <br/>
not met. Her socks have to be just so on her feet or she screams and <br/>
kicks. She has very strong reactions.<br/>
      I feel that this behavior is pretty developmentally <br/>
appropriate. Inconvenient, but appropriate. There are many children <br/>
with more easy going temperaments who will not react this way during <br/>
this developmental stage. But for many children, this is typical.  I <br/>
am pretty picky about my socks too :-). When my wrist was broken and <br/>
my husband had to put them on for me they always felt wrong. I try to <br/>
imagine what it feels like to be so small and have to rely on others <br/>
for these types of things.<br/>
I also try to help her get her preference whenever I can. I try to <br/>
give her as much information beforehand so that she will not be <br/>
surprised. I will remind her more than once at a restaurant that her <br/>
sister is having grilled cheese, and ask her if she still wants pasta <br/>
before we order. Often she will switch her choice, often she will <br/>
not. This does reduce the number of occasions where she is <br/>
disappointed but doesn&#39;t eliminate them.  Sometimes her sister will <br/>
share with her if she becomes really upset about her choice. <br/>
Sometimes she won&#39;t. We try to help her get what she wants, but <br/>
sometimes it is just not possible or at least not practical. Those <br/>
times she has to live with not having her choice. If she feels like <br/>
we have genuinely tried, she tends to be less upset. If she feels <br/>
like we are trying to push the unwanted item on her, like a cut <br/>
sandwich for example, she will become enraged. The more we push, the <br/>
angrier and more out of control she becomes. Usually there is a <br/>
solution. A new sandwich sometimes. Or a yogurt she can get from the <br/>
fridge herself, some almonds. We try to keep things which she will <br/>
eat readily around the house or packed to take with us. We try to <br/>
make her feel more in control when she starts acting like this, not <br/>
less in control. This tends to diffuse things.<br/>
           Transitions are hard for her too. I try to talk to her <br/>
about how she will feel when it is time to leave before we even <br/>
arrive. We count down the time for longer i.e., swimming is half <br/>
over, is there anything that you want to do before we are done? we <br/>
have time for five more trips across the pool,  we say bye to the pool, etc.<br/>
      My older daughter (now six) went through many of these same <br/>
issues at 3 and 4 years. She now is pretty flexible about most things <br/>
and has ceased to be a &#39;picky eater&#39; entirely. She has tremendous <br/>
empathy for her younger sister when she acts this way. I guess she <br/>
remembers what it felt like. When I get exasperated, my older <br/>
daughter reminds me of how important it is to her sister to have <br/>
things just so.<br/>
That said, my almost four year old is too little to go away from her <br/>
family for &quot;several days&quot; (for that matter so is my 6 year old:-)) . <br/>
Her behavior sounds to me like she really needs to connect. She needs <br/>
outside help to calm down. She needs to feel that she is safe and <br/>
that life is predictable. To me, that is what a tantrum is. Overload <br/>
and a cry for help. Maybe she just isn&#39;t ready for this type of <br/>
extended visit. If she does have to be away from home, maybe she <br/>
needs fewer transitions and more support in decision making. For some <br/>
a sandwich is just a sandwich i.e, my husband, others special order <br/>
every aspect of their meal down to tiny details i.e., me. Temperament <br/>
accounts for a lot.<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890751069">Wow!  That certainly sounds like a very, very challenging  situation.  I feel <br/>
for you on so many different levels.  I think that  your behavior was human <br/>
when you lost it.  It can happen to the best  of us when we are stretched <br/>
beyond our limits.  Forgive yourself,  and apologize to the child is all that you <br/>
can really do.  Internalize  that feeling, in hopes that it can help you in the <br/>
future.   But, realize that you are human; and we all make mistakes that are  <br/>
regrettable.  ((((hugs)))))<br/>
 <br/>
I am wondering if we had more information, if we might be able to be more  <br/>
help to you.<br/>
 <br/>
Specifically, why is the child staying away from her mother/father for that  <br/>
period of time?  <br/>
 <br/>
Is there some other conflict going on in her life?  Divorce, parents  <br/>
fighting, death of a person or animal, move, change in school, etc?<br/>
 <br/>
Is she often going from house to house; or day care to day care; or school  <br/>
to school?  ie is their a lot of change in who watches her?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Also, have you asked the mother how she would like you to handle the  <br/>
situations?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I will also add that you need to keep your own needs in mind.  No one  says <br/>
that you &quot;have&quot; to watch this child.  It sounds like you have your  hands full <br/>
with a 4 year old and a 10 month old.   <br/>
 <br/>
I do think that this child needs connection, not isolation; though.   But, I <br/>
don&#39;t know that someone else watching this child will be capable of  meeting <br/>
that need in such a short period of time.  If you have read  &quot;Playful <br/>
Parenting&quot;, those skills may work the quickest for short fixes.....but,  it requires a <br/>
lot of imagination and energy, which you certainly may not have  with how full <br/>
your plate is at this point. <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>
 <br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Cynthia <br/>
