I&#39;m sure we could have fun with that one. Just my warped way of thinking.<br/>

about years ago that didn&#39;t believe that numbers were absolute.  They would<br/>
keep count of things by tying knots.  When two cords with knots were tied<br/>
together, you would end up with a different number than the one that our<br/>
cultures deems correct. So therefore 2+2=5 because a cord with 2 knots tied<br/>
to another cord with 2 knots gives you a cord with 5 knots.  :-)  Not sure<br/>
how that correlates to sheep or goat or momey management, but I loved it<br/>
that they didn&#39;t think in absolutes.<br/>
