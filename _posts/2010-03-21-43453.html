I have a lady who has been unwell for a while and unfortunately has developed a horrendous and rather large &quot;birds nest&quot; knot in her hair.  She has long hair (near to waist), the tight part of the tangle is prob the size of a clenched fist and is tight to the nape of her neck.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice please on how she could go about dealing with it without cutting her hair?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>

You can have dozens of answers in seconds. I Googled &quot;remove knot  <br/>
from hair&quot; and got 999,000 results (in .29 seconds Google tells me.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732426676">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I had waist length hair and have also had a &quot;bird&#39;s nest&quot;. What worked<br/>
for me was to detangle it in the shower. I shampooed and then<br/>
conditioned my hair I used Pantene conditioner that came in a tub/jar<br/>
and slowly oh so slowly worked the conditioner into the knot and used<br/>
a wide toothed comb to get the knots out.<br/>
<br/>
It is a slow and uncomfortable process but unavoidable if you do not<br/>
want to cut it. You could also try the children&#39;s detangler spray. It<br/>
may work but I have not used it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207406220">Try nattydreds.com. I&#39;m pretty sure that is the domain name but if it doesn&#39;t work try googling &quot;natty dreds&quot; they carry a product for releasing dredlocks. It will take patience and working with a comb and she will likely need others to help her.<br/>
