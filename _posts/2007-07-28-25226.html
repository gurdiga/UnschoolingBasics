<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835910151">Hello. I am new here (and new to unschooling, having just withdrawn my daughters from <br/>
public school) and have been looking through a pile of information that people have <br/>
thoughtfully shared with me. I fear that I have made an &quot;oops&quot; and am seeking advice. I <br/>
did not send my letter of intent to school my  kids at home by July 1st. Is this going to be <br/>
a problem for us?  Thank you for any advice</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184548754">Hi -<br/>
<br/>
You can file the letter of intent in NYS on the day you decide to <br/>
homeschool- which can be anytime at all!<br/>
You can ask questions about unschooling in NY on funschooling, <br/>
NYHEN-support, or  Families Unschooling in New York. Members of those <br/>
lists are usually pretty helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672593362">Ithaca is a GREAT city to homeschool.  My brother and his family live <br/>
there.  My sister-in-law works closely with The Learning Center, a <br/>
homeschool &quot;school&quot; of sorts. :)    You&#39;re  very lucky.  I wish we <br/>
lived there.  We live about 2 hours northeast of Ithaca.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you would like to see what I send in for my letter of <br/>
intent, feel free to email me.<br/>
