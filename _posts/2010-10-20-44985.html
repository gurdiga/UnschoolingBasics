<div id="ygrps-yiv-758368664">I read someone on here saying something about pen pals a while ago and I meant to respond but didn&#39;t. There is a pen pal group for folks who teach/learn at home. Right now they have apost card exchange goin on with folks all over the world and a homeschool holiday card exchange. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a family from there looking for post cards from all over the world:<br/>
<br/>
   We are learning about the continents and different countries in each continent. <br/>
We would like to get postcards from as many different countries as possible. We<br/>
will send one in return!<br/>
<br/>
If you can send one to them from anotehr country go here and email them please:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
