<div id="ygrps-yiv-878734966">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone can recommend some good books to teach me what to <br/>
do<br/>
about my dd 11 and ds 9 being so cruel to each other in their daily<br/>
conflicts. I&#39;m just learning this new parenting style, having been<br/>
raised in a strict traditional parenting style, and have raised my own<br/>
almost the same way,up until about a month ago. DH is very much the<br/>
traditional authoritarian parent still, so I also have that hurdle to<br/>
overcome. Since I started not disciplining them, they are just calling<br/>
names more, even hitting each other, and once, dd BIT ds finger! I <br/>
keep<br/>
falling into my old patterns, and sometimes yell at them. DS is very<br/>
sensitive, so he ends up crying and angry. I want to buy Siblings<br/>
Without Rivalry, but would like more suggestions if you all have them.<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Linda, I could use some help in that area too.  I am a seasoned <br/>
unschooler but going from the reward/punishment style parenting to a <br/>
more partnership type of parenting is an entire different story.  <br/>
Because I knew I didn&#39;t want to be the same kind of parent that my <br/>
parents were to me I quickly got away from the traditional style <br/>
parenting but I now realize that I didn&#39;t wait until I had better <br/>
tools to replace those old tools with.  What happened is we ended up <br/>
going to a somewhat passive type of parenting and things have gotten <br/>
really bad.  My kids fight about 60% of the day and it&#39;s really MEAN <br/>
and hurtful kind of stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know where to back up at this point so I could use some <br/>
advice in that area too!!<br/>

<br/>
I have felt the same recently and I am so happy to say there are more calm<br/>
moments than challenging ones now.  It has been (continues to be) a journey<br/>
~ mostly about myself.  The biggest challenge has been reprogramming myself<br/>
to stay in the moment and being aware of when it would be best to be<br/>
physically present or the potential of needing to be, as well as just being<br/>
with them more. I&#39;m also getting better at finding the core issues of<br/>
situations. It is so common to assume kids are doing things for attention.<br/>
That insinuates attention is not something that kids need and seems to<br/>
justify being disconnected and detached. It is one of my pet peeves when<br/>
people assume kids are trying to be malicious for the sole joy of it. And<br/>
yet I understand not knowing how to guide them (and myself) when also<br/>
parented in the same manner. It has been difficult at times to ignore that<br/>
voice that reminds me of all the adult responsibilities I need to tend to.<br/>
It has taken me of out my comfort zones but I then remind myself what is<br/>
truly important to me. I&#39;m steadily outgrowing my tendency to take care of<br/>
things before people (including myself).  And the wonderful thing is that<br/>
the rewards come right now. I remind myself that I am consciously choosing<br/>
to evolve and that change is only as hard as I make it. <br/>
