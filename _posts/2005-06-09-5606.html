<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706526871">I&#39;ve just recently enrolled my son here in Florida in one of the <br/>
umbrella schools but I think I&#39;m still going to have to do an <br/>
evaluation with the state. Anybody have any knowledge of any <br/>
evaluators who are openminded to unschooling? We are still deschooling <br/>
so most of our time has been spent playing World of Warcraft online. I <br/>
have mostly just lurked and whenever I think I&#39;m done watching him <br/>
play for five hours straight somebody else posts that there child is <br/>
doing the same. Thanks to all of you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why is it you think you&#39;ll have to do an evaluation with the state? <br/>
Does the umbrella you are with require it? My understanding (but I&#39;m <br/>
not in FL) is that once you are signed on with an umbrella, you need <br/>
have no further dealings with the state - you just do whatever the <br/>
umbrella requires and that&#39;s it. I suppose an exception would be if <br/>
you were homeschooling under the school district until recently and so <br/>
they are expecting to see something reflecting that at the end of <br/>
the &quot;School year&quot;.<br/>
