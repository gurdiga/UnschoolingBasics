<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674543144">Hey they descreased it from $99 this morning! I emailed them to ask <br/>
if it was a mistake and they said it wasn&#39;t - that it was priced that <br/>
way cuz it was out of print and the &quot;only other place to get it&quot; was <br/>
on a UK site for $300+ in U.S. dollars. I figured they were full of <br/>
it. Glad to know I can get it from the author rather than some rip-<br/>
off artist. lol<br/>
