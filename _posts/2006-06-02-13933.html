<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068108041">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Tina and I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple weeks.  I&#39;ve <br/>
found so many of the posts sooo helpful- thanks to everyone here who <br/>
socompletely explain their positions and help open up great <br/>
discussions and learning!<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 children- 2 girls, 15 and 13, and boy, 8. I&#39;m married <br/>
luckily to a very open-minded man.  While he admits that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
always understand or &quot;get it&quot; when I try new things or think the way <br/>
I do, he still goes along with me until he figures it out- and <br/>
usually agrees with me. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, my kids have been in public school, and we&#39;ve dabbled in <br/>
homeschooling although traditional curriculum-based schooling didn&#39;t <br/>
last long for us.  This past school year we pulled our son from PS <br/>
due to the crummy way the system and local administration treated <br/>
him and his disabilities (he&#39;s severely dyslexic, dysgraphic, has <br/>
ADHD, SID and is HS on top of all that.) We thought to traditionally <br/>
homeschool but he doesn&#39;t need or want that structure and silly <br/>
busywork, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
The girls have asked to stay in PS school, but I&#39;ve made it clear to <br/>
them on many occasion that they do not have to choose that route. My <br/>
son expresses no wish to go back to PS, which we&#39;ve assured him will <br/>
not happen. <br/>
<br/>
Both dh and I went to public school from K to 12.  He was parented <br/>
very strictly, yet very disfunctually.  My parents were &quot;almost&quot; <br/>
unschoolers except for that damned PS crap. ;)  Seriously, they did <br/>
pretty good- no curfews, no rules for the sake of rules, I made <br/>
choices for myself based on my needs and wants and not on what THEY <br/>
thought I needed or wanted.  I could have used more privacy and <br/>
trust in that realm- I chalk that up to my brother being a drug <br/>
addict and that old saying &quot;once burnt, twice shy&quot;.  But dang, I&#39;m <br/>
STILL ticked at him for putting me in that position and them for <br/>
thinking I&#39;d be like him and not trusting me to know better or learn <br/>
from his mistake. Had it not been for that, I&#39;d think they did <br/>
pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, I told myself as a teen that &quot;when I grew up&quot;, I wouldnt <br/>
distrust my kids based on somebody else&#39;s behavior, and I&#39;d give <br/>
them the privacy they deserved.  They wouldn&#39;t feel stressed over <br/>
having to hide letters or notes from friends or a boyfriend, and <br/>
they would know I respected their intelligence and choices.  So, <br/>
that&#39;s how we&#39;ve raised the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I am allowing them their choice to attend PS although they know I <br/>
personally wouldn&#39;t choose that route for myself.  I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;homeschool&quot; ds with curriculums and books. I don&#39;t push them <br/>
into anything I think they should like, and I don&#39;t force them to <br/>
give up things they do like just because I find no interest in it.<br/>
<br/>
I still have hang-ups, too- I am realizing just how many, or how <br/>
much better I could do things by reading all of your posts and <br/>
advice to other newbies. :) <br/>
<br/>
My biggest fear in letting go completely is based in the educational <br/>
realm.  I know my son can learn as much- and MORE- without <br/>
textbooks. He has proven that fact.  But, we&#39;re a military family; <br/>
we live on a military base with a school that he originally attended <br/>
right down the road, and they know we&#39;ve pulled him <br/>
to &quot;homeschool&quot;.  They send letters expecting him to take the Fed <br/>
tests and the state assessments, they expect progress reports at the <br/>
end of the year about what he learned, examples of work he&#39;s <br/>
completed or projects he&#39;s created.  They expect a written list of <br/>
curriculum and topics he will learn about this coming school year.  <br/>
And it&#39;s all things that by state law they have a right to request <br/>
from me.  <br/>
<br/>
The year-end report is easy. I can gloss over the curriculum issue <br/>
by talking about what he learned and if necessary showing some <br/>
projects he does as a normal daily activity and just calling <br/>
it &quot;school projects&#39;.  But, what do I do for next year? What do I <br/>
say for what we plan to teach to meet 3rd grade standards?  And, <br/>
escpecially, what about these stupid tests?! I doubt he&#39;d do well on <br/>
them if he was in PS either because of his learning differences, but <br/>
there I could push the issue in an IEP. What do I do since he is at <br/>
home? Have any of you run into any of these problems before?  How <br/>
did you handle it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for being here, understaning, and giving out advice <br/>
to all of us trying to be better parents and partners to our kids. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25985734">You might want to check with local homeschoolers as to how things <br/>
work where you are. In the synopses I&#39;ve looked at online, there&#39;s <br/>
nothing that says the evaluation has to show grade level work - just <br/>
progress from year to year. The tests are only at the end of 3rd, <br/>
5th, 8th and 10th grade - so if they are requesting testing more <br/>
often, you can respectfully decline and choose an alternate option - <br/>
a written eval by a HI certified teacher (I&#39;d bet there are some <br/>
homeschoolers who are also certified and do evals for people) or a <br/>
written eval by the parent which demonstrates progress (includes <br/>
assigments to be submitted but you can write the assignment after <br/>
the fact to match whatever it was he actually did!)<br/>
<br/>
Check out Sandra Dodd&#39;s website on unschooling for info on how to <br/>
take tests without stressing testing. Also, there are several sites <br/>
(probably linked off Sandra&#39;s) that show samples of &quot;curriculum&quot; <br/>
plans that parents have submitted in places like NY and PA (which <br/>
are really law-bound as far as homeschooling).<br/>
<br/>
It is doable. Since you&#39;re not overseas, you are under the local <br/>
laws - if you were overseas, I think you&#39;d come under DoDDs regs <br/>
rather than that country&#39;s laws since you&#39;re on base. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336739554">Oh no no.. I wasn&#39;t clear enough- I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s not the MILITARY doing it.. it is the DoE via the local elementary school.  What I meant was that we live on a military base near the school and the school is small because it only serves the base kids.  Due to the small size of the school, they are very capable of following up on every case of homeschooling- and they do. Blah; I hate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198767741">Thank you!  I should have thought to check out Sandra&#39;s site. (duh! ;) )     I do know I can decline the STATE assessment- which I&#39;ve already done this year with a bit of fight. We will continue to decline the state testing with no worries.   Ds would be considered 3rd grade this coming year if he was in school so we will be running into the testing issue soon enough- I imagine we&#39;ll be getting our packet within the next couple months- school goes back July 27th.<br/>

  Good idea.  I&#39;m stressing over it beause I&#39;m trying to be proactive and think I might have lost site of the forest, so to speak.  This makes a lot of sense- I&#39;m feeling a bit more relieved..  I&#39;ll definitely look for the sample curriculums others have used.  <br/>

I found this site through nhen.org<br/>

<br/>
Make sure you&#39;re familiar with your state&#39;s particular <br/>
requirements.   I found another yahoo group for my state (MA) that, <br/>
while they talk alot about curriculum, which I mostly pass over, <br/>
it&#39;s been VERY helpful in understanding what I need to do to satisfy <br/>
my state requirements (each one is different).  There may be one for <br/>
your area.  Also try to find other homeschoolers to find out what <br/>
they do, but be sure you fully understand what they CAN and CANNOT <br/>
ask for first (unschoolers are hard to find!  There are NONE in my <br/>
town that I know of).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new too, I will be submitting my first narrative report this <br/>
year, I&#39;m getting pretty creative, and also got some good <br/>
suggestions here as well as other places.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The year-end report is easy. I can gloss over the curriculum issue <br/>

home? Have any of you run into any of these problems before?  How <br/>
did you handle it?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, be sure you fully understand your state&#39;s requirements <br/>
first!  Find other homeschoolers who have submitted before for <br/>
suggestions (I didn&#39;t indicate in mine that we were &quot;unschooling&quot; as <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t get it, I just said we&#39;re homeschooling).<br/>
<br/>
Read, read, read!<br/>

Not exactly. This is from the NHEN site on Hawaii:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers must file a notice of intent with the principal of the <br/>
local public school. No approval is needed. The required &quot;written <br/>
record of the planned curriculum&quot; is not ordinarily shared with the <br/>
school. An annual progress report is required; progress may be shown <br/>
through testing, evaluation by a certified teacher, or parent-written <br/>
report providing statements of progress in each subject area and <br/>
samples of the student&#39;s work. Standardized test scores are normally <br/>
required in grades 3, 6, 8, and 10, but there are provisions for <br/>
alternatives to standardized testing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;Homeschoolers must file a notice of intent with the principal of the <br/>

   <br/>
  Correct, and we have done this with no problems outside of the eye rolling that I chose to ignore. :)  <br/>
   <br/>
  &lt;The required &quot;written <br/>
record of the planned curriculum&quot; is not ordinarily shared with the <br/>
school.&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  Not ordinarily, but I have checked with some hs groups here, and it is perfectly acceptable for the school to ask, and it&#39;s expected that we do hand over this info when asked.  If it said NEVER shared then I wouldn&#39;t even consider it.  Of course, no where did I read today as I researched that I had to AGREE to share the info.<br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; An annual progress report is required; progress may be shown <br/>
 </span></blockquote>through testing, evaluation by a certified teacher, or parent-written <br/>
report providing statements of progress in each subject area and <br/>
samples of the student&#39;s work.&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  This is the end of the year stuff which I&#39;ve already completed- turned it in today with no problems. (One issue off my mind at least)<br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; Standardized test scores are normally <br/>
 </span></blockquote>required in grades 3, 6, 8, and 10, but there are provisions for <br/>
alternatives to standardized testing.&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  So long as the alternatives include written reporting by me, I can handle that.  I do know a lot of hs&#39;ers in this school district who have told me they were told their alternative was a slower paced or no-timed test in the SPED classroom. <br/>
   <br/>
  I know for a fact he is learning so much more than he ever would inside school and this school district is so crummy anyway, I&#39;d have to ignore my kids to do worse than them.. no wait, I&#39;d be doing EXACTLY what the school district has done. Grrr... <br/>
   <br/>
  On an upnote my middle dd came around- she said she tried ps this year, she cured her curiosity and she is not interested in it.  Woo!<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;d find some local state unschoolers and find out how they deal with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this.&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  I did.  They said they&#39;ve been ignoring the school district.  A couple said they hadn&#39;t been contacted and so they just haven&#39;t filed any reports or done any testing whatsoever.  One mom said she had been contacted by the school, which happens to be the same school my son would be going to. She said she lied and told them she was using a particular curriculum and her child isn&#39;t test-age yet, but figured she&#39;d have to make her dd do the tests, but she hadn&#39;t thought that far yet.<br/>
