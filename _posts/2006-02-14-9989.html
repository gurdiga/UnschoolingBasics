<br/>
so much the dishes per se but that you need a clean and serene <br/>
<br/>
place, pick a place and clean it, put some nice candles there, maybe <br/>
<br/>
some light reading and a comfy chair or cushion, maybe a portable <br/>
<br/>
radio or CD player, and when you feel out of sorts and overwhelmed, <br/>
<br/>
go there. Yeah, the dishes and all will still be there in 20 minutes <br/>
<br/>
or 30 minutes, but you&#39;ll have recharged your own self.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280704657">It is so funny that this came up, it is something that in our family we have struggled with.  My <br/>
husband was brought up with strict rules about chores, but he never did them, and resented <br/>
he parents b/c of it.  I grew up a bit differently, 4 kids, 2 adults, we each took turns washing <br/>
the dishes(i hated it), but on Sat. all the chores were thrown in a hat and everyone choose <br/>
two.  You got whatever, and if someone was willing to trade, you did.  My mom and dad both <br/>
worked full time, and we were willing to help, our house was never spotless(far from it) but <br/>
we were happy in it.  The Sandra Dodd web site has a section on chores, reading all of it has <br/>
helped me.  We had chores for our kids, and I didn&#39;t like the struggle, strife it caused.  So I do <br/>
what I can, and do ask for help, my oldest  empties the dishwasher when things get hectic.  <br/>
She always has the right to say no, and does.  The other two like laundry so they help when <br/>
they want to also. My ? is it against unschooling, or just bad practice, to offer to pay her for <br/>
jobs that I don&#39;t have time for?  Thanks for your ideas and advice. Melanie in Vt</div>

Extra just means rinsing dishes and not doing the messy stuff at the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009401635">Interestingly enough, back when we had chores and a bona fide chore chart,<br/>
our house was messier and I got less help then I do now. Mind you, housework<br/>
is pretty low on my list of things to do, there is always at least half a<br/>
dozen things I&#39;d rather be doing. So implementing chores won&#39;t always solve<br/>
the messy house problem.  I do get more willing help now when asked for and<br/>
often, when needed but not asked for. One of my girls likes to clean (must<br/>
have been the genes from my mother-in-law, it sure didn&#39;t&#39; come from me!)<br/>
and pretty much has taken over keeping the kitchen clean. The only down side<br/>
is I get in trouble if I don&#39;t put stuff away or if I leave a mess! :)  We<br/>
try to respect each other&#39;s needs though. Since a clean kitchen is important<br/>
to Lisa, we all try to clean up after ourselves.  And even though I never<br/>
made my kids clean their rooms, the girls&#39; each keep their rooms spotless.<br/>
My only problem at the moment, and maybe someone can give some suggestions,<br/>
is the boys&#39; room. It&#39;s pretty messy and disorganized at the moment.<br/>
Overwhelming to them. I don&#39;t have a problem with cleaning their room or<br/>
helping them...it&#39;s just that it&#39;s really overwhelming to me as well. I know<br/>
I just need to go in and start....but it&#39;s going to be tough for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Collapsible, mesh, laundry baskets (fairly inexpensive, come in <br/>
several colors)...get 3 or 4 (or more) of them and set them in the <br/>
midst of the room. Then toss clean clothing in one, dirty clothing in <br/>
another, boy 1&#39;s stuff in the third, boy 2&#39;s stuff in the 4th (and so <br/>
on for more boys). Everything goes in a basket...unless someone knows <br/>
exactly where an item goes and goes ahead and puts it there instead of <br/>
the basket. By the time the baskets are full, you should have at least <br/>
a small amount of floor space visible (Lol). Take the dirty laundry <br/>
basket out to the laundry area. Then tackle the remaining baskets - <br/>
pick one and start putting stuff away. The good part of this is that <br/>
if you get through only half the clean laundry basket and that&#39;s it, <br/>
you&#39;ve still got some little bit of organization going like a little <br/>
yeast growing...next time you get a bit of time to clean, start with <br/>
the basket you left off with. And so on. In the meantime, between <br/>
cleaning bursts, stuff can just get tossed into the baskets and be out <br/>
of the way. And when a basket is empty, it folds up and stores <br/>
compactly until it is needed again (if indeed any of the baskets ever <br/>
get emptied, ours tend to get emptier and fuller but not usually <br/>
totally empty). And the basket that carried the dirty laundry down is <br/>
the same one it can go back up to their room in. Again, if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
get put away immediately, at least it&#39;s contained. For actual storage, <br/>
we have lots of clear plastic bins with lids (so they can stack) and <br/>
we label each with the intended contents: one is Vehicles for <br/>
instance - any toy that rolls, flies, etc goes in there. Another is <br/>
for People (all those action figures). And so on. Legos have their own <br/>
multiple bins in a separate location (down in the basement closet <br/>
because that&#39;s where DH and DS build their Lego BrikWars scenarios). <br/>
Thomas trains and tracks have their own bin. And we have a couple <br/>
larger Rubbermaid type bins (big ones) for general jumble - those get <br/>
a going through once or twice a year to toss broken stuff, give away <br/>
outgrown/outdated stuff, and sort back into circulation things like <br/>
cars and people that just got tossed in there for a quick tidy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps trigger some ideas<br/>

Of course....if you are really hiring her versus using money to coerce her.  I have all kinds of deals going with my kids all the time.  I have even paid them for their time if I REALLY wanted to do something that I thought was fun and they thought was boring but they needed to be with me for whatever reason.<br/>

<br/>
It may help to break it down into little jobs rather than look at it as one big mess. Set a timer for 15 minutes and head in there with a specific goal in mind. So the first time you&#39;ll go in and put away books and toys for 15 minutes. Stop when the timer goes off whether you&#39;re done or not. Next time pick up laundry and put away clothes for 15 minutes. Keep doing this as often as you feel the urge. Eventually the mess gets cleaned up. The trick is to limit yourself to the 15 minutes so that you know the job won&#39;t last forever.<br/>
