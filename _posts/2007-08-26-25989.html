<div id="ygrps-yiv-126586731">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am not new to this group, mostly just taking things in...<br/>
<br/>
I have recently started a blog carnival with the intention of uniting<br/>
some of us who blog about our unschooling experiences.  As far as I<br/>
know, Unschooling Voices (a previous unschooling blog carnival) is no<br/>
longer being published.  Here is the link to the carnival I have<br/>
created <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_2356.html">http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_2356.html</a><br/>
<br/>
If you are unfamiliar with blog carnivals (I was not too long ago!),<br/>
they are blog posts published on a regular shedule (in this case<br/>
monthly) with links to others&#39; blog posts on a related theme/topic.  <br/>
<br/>
The first edition is due to be published on my blog September 10.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from some of you :)<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
jenn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146163225">Hi Diana,<br/>
<br/>
for the first carnival I am leaving it open to all unschooling<br/>
oriented posts.<br/>
<br/>
I think as time goes on, having a theme might be a good direction.<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
jenn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656963349">Thanks Rue,<br/>
<br/>
in that case, I think there is no point in starting another blog<br/>
carnival about unschooling.  Good to hear that Unschooling Voices is<br/>
continuing!<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
