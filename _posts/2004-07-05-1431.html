<div id="ygrps-yiv-478950759">Congratulations, Melissa, on your new little boy!  If you don&#39;t already have one, get a sling....it will be a life saver for you, I am sure.   (This may have been already suggested, as I am acouple of days behind....)  You can give that little guy all the holding he needs and still be able to get other things done.  You can even nurse him while you are washing dishes, etc.  I think a sling is the most essential piece of baby gear.<br/>
Love, Millie<br/>
