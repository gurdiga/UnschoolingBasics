I think  a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my parents will be <br/>
coming  for Christmas.  They are humoring me in regards to homeschooling  <br/>
(basically supporting my decision but want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into  <br/>
school ASAP) but would be totally and utterly against the idea of  unschooling.  I <br/>
can see just an incredibly unhappy visit on the  horizon.<br/>

Malinda, maybe you should play up the fact that your husband is in  Iraq.  <br/>
Sometimes with families, you just have to buy a little  time.   You can tell <br/>
them that the stress of having a husband in  combat is overwhelming and that this <br/>
is the best solution for now that you have  found.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then when your husband comes home, you&#39;ll need your son home from  school for <br/>
the transition time.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
After that, you&#39;ll be feeling much more sure of the unschooling and your  <br/>
parents might even be able to see it working and they&#39;ll lay off of you.   That&#39;s <br/>
how it happened for me.<br/>
 <br/>
I would give them as little info as you can get away with.  It was so  hard <br/>
for me to not tell my mom everything I was doing, but it turned out for the  <br/>
best.  She is now supportive of my homeschooling, but she still has never  heard <br/>
the word unschooling or asked me what we do all day. <br/>
 <br/>
If your parents make this an unhappy visit, I would say &quot;my husband is in  <br/>
Iraq.  I am doing everything I possibly can to make this a wonderful  Christmas <br/>
for Tristan.  If you have anything negative to say to me, please  hold your <br/>
tongue until after the holidays.  All of our energy needs to be  focused on <br/>
creating a joyful holiday, Tristan and I want you here. But if you  cannot just be <br/>
positive then I need you to not be here.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Although it wasn&#39;t about homeschooling, my mother and I had a similar  <br/>
conversation when my husband was in Iraq.  I had to tell her that my stress  level <br/>
was through the roof and I could not listen to her negativity at that  time.  <br/>
She got the point and quit bitching at me, actually she was really  quite sorry <br/>
and didn&#39;t realize she had been doing that.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking of you!<br/>
