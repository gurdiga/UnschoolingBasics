<div id="ygrps-yiv-680268608">Hilary, you sound EXACTLY like me. Those are the same thoughts that I have. I <br/>
feel so much better knowing that I`m not alone.<br/>
My daughter is 12 and this is our second year of H/S.  I agree with the <br/>
&quot;invisible&quot; bullying that girls do. I`m sort of glad that my kid didn`t want to be <br/>
one of the airhead girls who follow the popular girls around.But at the same <br/>
time I want her to have friends and feel good about herself. <br/>
<br/>
Last year I did the &quot;school at home&quot; route which got old really quick.I`m <br/>
more relaxed now but I still feel like I have to account to people about what <br/>
she`s learning. Right now I just want her to gain some self confidence that was <br/>
lost.She`s such a great kid; she likes to make things out of paper etc and she <br/>
really amazes me with her imagination.So what if she never learns algebra.<br/>
<br/>
I work nights and when I drive home in the morning I see kids going to <br/>
school; I feel bad for them AND their parents because they`re missing so much time <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me share................Lyn<br/>
