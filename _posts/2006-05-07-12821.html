<div id="ygrps-yiv-49547063"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;... from what I understand (not know) college has many choices and you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>learn what you choose to learn in college and take required classes that<br/>
pertain to your degree so WHY do they place emphasis on say &#39;grammar&#39; if<br/>
your child wants to go to college and major in history?  I truly and<br/>
honestly don&#39;t get it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little behind on posts, so maybe someone has responded to this, but<br/>
there are certain requirements that you are required to take to get any<br/>
degree.  A certain number of math, science, history, etc. courses depending<br/>
on your major.  Kind of like other PS BS.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends on the college. Some have no requirements at all. Some  <br/>
have lots. Some are focused on &quot;well rounded&quot; so there are  <br/>
requirements outside the major. Some are focused on thorough so  <br/>
requirements are within the major.<br/>
<br/>
It all depends!<br/>

could take all the courses in your field of interest and never take a single<br/>
grammar course.  You won&#39;t get a degree because you haven&#39;t finished all the<br/>
classes required for that &quot;well roundedness&quot; but you can study that which<br/>
you like more easily than at a private college.  I don&#39;t know how it is now,<br/>
but when I was in college each college that I applied to were at capacity at<br/>
the beginning of the school year.  They have only a certain number of spots<br/>
available and they are filled each year, so they don&#39;t want students that<br/>
aren&#39;t degree oriented.  I know that the college that I went to had a<br/>
certain number of spots open for the general public to take classes, but<br/>
they were very few and also came with a hefty price tag.  The difference I<br/>
remember between my private college years and my state uni years is that<br/>
state uni I paid a certain amount per credit whereas at the private college<br/>
I paid a certain amount per semester and could take up to 18 credits (or as<br/>
few as 14 credits) per semester.<br/>
