<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844931725">I wrote a blog post this morning, about my son dating<br/>
(!),(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/06/couple-o-dreams.htmlm">http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/06/couple-o-dreams.htmlm</a><br/>
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn) and I used the word<br/>
refuge in it... I wrote about what a woman said, that when you&#39;re on<br/>
the leading edge of change, you&#39;ll get criticized and possibly<br/>
ridiculed, and you need a refuge. I then just clicked over here, and<br/>
saw the lively passionate discussions.<br/>
<br/>
We are each other&#39;s refuge. This list, and others, are my safe space.<br/>
I asked earlier about speaking out, about how to advocate for kids in<br/>
a respectful, honest way, and I see this as my desire to go out into<br/>
the world more, to say more, out loud. To no longer be silent (unless<br/>
silence is called for), because if I had heard about unschooling<br/>
earlier, it would have saved us a few years of confused thinking. So,<br/>
to not be strident and dogmatic, but no longer silent.<br/>
<br/>
In writing today, I became so grateful that you guys are here. So I<br/>
just wanted to say thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464261454">MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY ON BEING A REFUGE - I REALLY DIG THAT I CAN LISTEN <br/>
AND SHARE ABOUT RADICAL UNSCHOOLING IN SUCH A CARING AND ACCEPTING <br/>
VENUE AS GROUPS LIKE THIS.  IT IS LIKE AN EXTENSION OF THE POSITIVE <br/>
ATTITUDE I EXPERIENCED AT THE UNSCHOOLING CONFERENCE IN PEABODY.  I TOO <br/>
AM GRATEFUL</div>
