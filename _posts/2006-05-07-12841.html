<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472954914">My name is Chris. Mom to 2 boys ages 6 and 3. I live in central Oklahoma. My oldest <br/>
was just removed from 1st grade due to a horrific year. Where he learned only about <br/>
aspects of life that hes to young for. We contemplated schooling at home(more of a <br/>
un-schooling) for awhile and finally just jumped in. We don&#39;t know any other <br/>
homeschooling parents around here since we do not attend a church( although my <br/>
neighbors say there are quite a bit of them at their church lol) We are a very <br/>
unconventional family that loves to have fun. I hope to learn from you all. And hope <br/>
to join you as we begin our new journey.<br/>

I&#39;m in central Oklahoma as well. There are a BUNCH of homeschoolers,  <br/>
and unschoolers in OKC metro area, Ok is a great state to be in if  <br/>
you don&#39;t want to subject your kids to the PSBS. (I really like that,  <br/>
whoever used it first!)<br/>
