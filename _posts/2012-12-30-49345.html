<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238617213">This list has gotten really bad for it, I&#39;m afraid - a combination of longtime members getting &quot;spambotted&quot; and I suspect, people sending messages to all their lists, groups, and friends in blanket emails. Grrr. As slow as things are otherwise, I&#39;m tempted to switch the entire membership to moderation. As it is, anyone who posts blanket emails to the list goes on moderation, if they&#39;re not already (everyone starts out on moderation which cuts down some of this) and if anyone posts really blatant advertizing they&#39;re removed from the list.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if for some reason you want to reply to an off-topic post, do it directly to the poster, not the list. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and my appologies again,<br/>
