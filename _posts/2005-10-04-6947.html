<br/>
I&#39;m truly sorry for your loss.  You sound like wonderful people.  <br/>
Sixteen years ago I lost my parents in a terrible accident.  I <br/>
understand their pain.  Their fears as you mentioned are <br/>
understandable.<br/>
<br/>
If one of you could stay home and unschool them, that would be <br/>
wonderful.  They need to be loved, have a feeling of security and just <br/>
be together.  Sending them to boarding school would be tragic and very <br/>
destructive.  <br/>
<br/>
You have legal custody of them, do what you feel is best in your own  <br/>
hearts.  The rest of the family doesn&#39;t have the right to interfere.  <br/>
You both know what they need - lots of love and TLC at home.<br/>
<br/>
