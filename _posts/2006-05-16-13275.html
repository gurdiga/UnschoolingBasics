<div id="ygrps-yiv-320983357">&quot; Congratulations for bringing unschooling to a wider<br/>
market!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well technically, the writers and editors did that!:) I was just their<br/>
poster child. lol<br/>
<br/>
LeaAnn called today yelling at me &quot;YOU&#39;RE in People, why didn&#39;t you<br/>
TELL ME???!!&quot;  She picked up a ton of copies to bring home if anyone<br/>
in P&#39;cola wants one. <br/>
<br/>
On that note, a radio show out of Chicago called me today and asked if<br/>
I was willing to be interviewed for their show tomorrow morning (they<br/>
saw the People article). It&#39;s on WLUP in Chicago (the Johnnie B show)<br/>
and their focus this week is education.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can figure out the affiliates for their area, you could hear<br/>
it live. I don&#39;t know what time they&#39;ll do the interview, sometime<br/>
between 7am-10am Eastern time.<br/>
<br/>
And hey, if someone would record it, I&#39;d be MOST grateful. Queanna?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172883526">I read your article while I was waiting in line at the grocery store <br/>
today.  I thought it was a very good article, and showed unschooling <br/>
in a very positive light...which is unusual.  ;)  How did you get to <br/>
do it?  Did comeone from the magazine contact you, or did you get in <br/>
touch with them...or???  I really couldn&#39;t figure out the saw in the <br/>
front of the picture...what WAS it doing there?  Something about an <br/>
interest someone has?  I wish you would tell us all about doing it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596116566">Hey Ren, I just picked up the magazine today.  I was shopping with <br/>
Darcy and saw it, so I found the article and showed her the photo.  <br/>
She said, &quot;That&#39;s Ren!&quot; and the next thing she said was &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
Jalen??!!&quot;  We still remember him as that adorable little toddler who <br/>
was always going &quot;ssthh&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to see the photo of you and your family.  I thought the <br/>
article was too short and didn&#39;t say all that much, but hopefully it <br/>
will get the attention of some people who have never heard of <br/>
unschooling before.<br/>
