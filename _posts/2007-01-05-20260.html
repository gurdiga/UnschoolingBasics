<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952634351">I am trying so hard to just view my kids&#39; toys, games, activities as<br/>

done a better job of asking &quot;will they like this?&quot; instead of &quot;what<br/>

Is this something that you all think about as well? Is it an ongoing<br/>
battle that gradually gets easier until you don&#39;t notice anymore or is<br/>
it something that stays with you, though you might not express it to<br/>
your children? <br/>
<br/>
I have been working on the type of comments I make to the children -<br/>
making sure they are in the moment and related to my observations of<br/>
their joy or frustrations, rather that relatin gthem to what they<br/>
may/may not be learning. But in my head, those comments are still<br/>
there, if that makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676349399">Alison,<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;...I have done a better job of asking &quot;[WILL] they like this?&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;what [CAN] they get from this?&quot; But as they play with <br/>
toys, my thoughts revert back.&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about asking yourself &quot;WHY will they like this?&quot; or <br/>
as you are watching them play asking yourself, &quot;what ARE *THEY* <br/>
getting from THIS?&quot;.  (I see your question above more as &quot;what do <br/>
*I* want them to get from this?&quot;.)  Training yourself to re-word <br/>
your questions may satisfy both your want to meet their interests <br/>
and your need for &quot;educational&quot; play.<br/>
<br/>
My son loves toys, and yes, I tend to think some of them <br/>
are &quot;mindless&quot;.  However, if I stop to think about &quot;why&quot; he likes a <br/>
toy or &quot;how&quot; he is playing with it my perpective usually changes.  <br/>
<br/>
All play is practice for something...whether it is &quot;mindless&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
I started thinking this way when I began trying to explain how <br/>
unschooling works to others.  I kept referring to things like my son <br/>
playing with Legos.  As he plays he&#39;s developing skills like <br/>
creativity, architecture, physics, math, etc.  Same goes for cars, <br/>
construction vehicles, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s simply playing with a straw at a restraunt <br/>
(pretty &quot;mindless&quot;, right?) he&#39;s experimenting with the flexibility <br/>
and strength of polymers, air flow & pressure, suction, and several <br/>
fluid theories all of which are classified as advanced physics (not <br/>
so &quot;mindless&quot; anymore, huh?). <br/>
<br/>
I used to think that my son couldn&#39;t read b/c he wasn&#39;t reading what <br/>
we asked him to.  So I would put reading &quot;stuff&quot; in his path.  <br/>
Needless, to say I wasted money and time.  The &quot;mindless&quot; <br/>
video/computer games, cartoons, and comics were what he WAS <br/>
reading...and doing a mighty fine job of it.  I just didn&#39;t see it <br/>
because I was too caught up in the activities being &quot;mindless&quot;.  <br/>
KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
What we would consider &quot;mindless&quot; simply isn&#39;t to a child.  No more <br/>
than the &quot;mindless&quot; soaking in a bubble bath is for you.  You&#39;re <br/>
pondering, daydreaming, relaxing, letting go of stress, possibly <br/>
planning the day, collecting yourself, getting clean, exfoliating, <br/>
etc.  In other words, you&#39;re becoming a better Mommy.  &quot;Mindless&quot; <br/>
play makes kids better kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because it seems &quot;mindless&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth doing.<br/>
<br/>

more you internalize it, even though you might not notice it at first, <br/>
it begins to make a difference in your thinking.  I&#39;ve been reading on <br/>
unschooling for something like 3 years, and there is a huge difference <br/>
in the way I think.  Some things just sneak up on me...I&#39;ll be doing <br/>
something and it comes out unschooley, and I&#39;m surprised. : ) Other <br/>
times I realize it&#39;s different than I would have done in the past, and <br/>
it makes me glad. <br/>
Just keep reading, keep studying, keep learning all you can about <br/>
unschooling.  Some day you&#39;ll be surprised that you haven&#39;t thought <br/>
about &quot;school&quot; in days, then weeks, then years. ; )<br/>

Hi Alison.  My first thought when reading your post was about  something I <br/>
read a long time ago about Maria Montessori.  She noticed a  child walking down <br/>
the street with his mother, she stopped to have a chat with  someone.  The <br/>
child picked up a piece of paper and explored it.   Montessori watched the child, <br/>
noticing that he played with this paper and &quot;came  to know it&quot;.  What are <br/>
your children coming to know about the things they  are doing?<br/>
 <br/>
The truth is.....you will probably never know!  Experiencing life is  all in <br/>
the mind of the individual.  Can you truly know what &quot;green&quot; is like  to <br/>
another person?  We all point to something and agree that it is green,  but does <br/>
that other person see what you see?  <br/>
 <br/>
So step back and observe your children, not to see what they are learning  <br/>
but to watch how they explore the world around them.  It is really  cool.  <br/>
Einstein (I have heard) said that 90% of the physics a person will  know in a <br/>
lifetime is learned in the first three years of life.  I  have read that a study in <br/>
the sixties concluded that school  learning only accounts for 5 % of a <br/>
person&#39;s total learning (long before  the tech age).  Where are we getting the other <br/>
95%????  Life.   Experience.  Just being.  Totally cool!<br/>
 <br/>
I also like to think what life would look like if you got to take an  <br/>
unlimited vacation and have the ability to do nothing or everything.   All your needs <br/>
are completely taken care of, food and cleaning, money.  You  can do anything <br/>
you want, no worries.  How would you spend your time?   At first you would <br/>
probably indulge yourself, but then you might find yourself  in rhythms of doing <br/>
and resting, wanting to be with others and being alone,  &quot;mindless&quot; TV <br/>
watching to reading classic novels to NYTimes Crosswords.   You might crave cleaning <br/>
up after yourself or cooking for yourself.  You  might lie on the grass and <br/>
stare at the clouds while your brain is in complete  creative mode...composing <br/>
a symphony or thinking on how to solve the worlds  problems.  You might start <br/>
an organic garden or chop wood.  Your brain  and body would find the optimum <br/>
states and rhythms of each moment and preparing  for tomorrow&#39;s whims or plans. <br/>
 It is what we are programmed to do by  nature, after taking care of our <br/>
basic needs for survival.<br/>
 <br/>
Keep reading and examining your thoughts.  Figure out where you might  be <br/>
getting in the way of your children&#39;s natural learning and  life rhythms.  Don&#39;t <br/>
worry when those old thoughts creep in, they  will!  Make a cup of tea and <br/>
watch your kids instead.  Or get down on  the floor and play a mindless game, <br/>
too.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879429302">I&#39;m new to the group and just learning the basics of unschooling, so if I&#39;m out of line, please forgive me. I don&#39;t see a problem with &quot;learning toys&quot; or toys that contribute to a child&#39;s education. There&#39;s a big difference with drilling a child to learn their alphabet by 5 years old, or giving your child a set of alphabet cookie cutters to play in with some homemade play dough. From what I&#39;ve read, a big part of unschooling is to fill your home with materials of educational value and letting the child explore them in their own way and on their own terms. So, if you buy or are given a toy with some educational value, you haven&#39;t broken any moral codes by thinking to yourself &quot;Gee, I bet that will really help Junior to learn to recognize his numbers.&quot;  After all, every time you add a book to your home library, aren&#39;t you doing so with the idea in mind that your child will learn something from that book. I was reading on a website this evening about a mom who says her home is<br/>
 like a museum, filled to capacity with toys and trinkets and gadgets that will foster imagination, creativity, and learning. She&#39;s collected things over the years with all of this in mind. I think it is our job to introduce our children to new concepts (I don&#39;t mean through worksheets and textbooks) but by bringing these interesting objects into our homes, then letting the child examine them and decide where to go from there. Maybe it will spark a lifetime love for the idea, or a five minute discovery that is never touched again. But, at least they had an introduction and can store the information away for a rainy day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044608589">Thanks Julie and Leslie... your insight really helps.  Leslie, you<br/>
ought to copy what you wrote an place it in your blog, if you have<br/>
one. The portion about what we as adult might do if we had no other<br/>
responsibilities really hits it home.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been doing more observing and I&#39;m routinely amazed when I just<br/>
sit back and realize what it really going on - not on the surface, but<br/>
deeper down. I have started a blog to help me chronicle it all. Just<br/>
for myself for now...maybe it will help new US someday...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I buy a book because I like something in particular about <br/>
it - the artwork, the cover even &lt;g&gt;! Since I mostly buy books at <br/>
thrift stores and library sales I can afford to do things like that. <br/>
Many times I have bought books with the thought that &quot;maybe one <br/>
day&quot;  I or Mo will be interested in some part of that book - an idea <br/>
for rainy day fun, or a chance to decoupage the bathroom walls with <br/>
scraps of text (my secret fantasy). But I don&#39;t buy books with the <br/>
expectation that learning will come as a result of the purchase.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like Sandra&#39;s site. Its a great place to read. One thing to <br/>
keep in mind with all this &quot;strewing&quot; is exactly what I mentioned <br/>
above - don&#39;t Expect kids will learn something just because you <br/>
offered them some neato thingummy. <br/>
<br/>
Its great to have lots and lots of options and ideas on hand for <br/>
those times when everyone feels a little stale or stuck in a rut, or <br/>
just in need of some rainy-day fun. Its also great, if you have a <br/>
busy, explorative child, to have things stashed away for her <br/>
to &quot;discover&quot; - it makes home a magical, exciting place to be. It <br/>
can be really fun to leave something out on a table, or in the <br/>
bathroom, whatever, for family members to discover and either be <br/>
interested in or ignore - but be prepared to have them ignore it! <br/>
<br/>
Since you brought up Montessori, I&#39;ll toss a bit back at ya - if you <br/>
offer a child a new &quot;material&quot; and the child is not interested, put <br/>
it away. She&#39;s not ready. That&#39;s true of strewing, too, although I <br/>
prefer to think of &quot;ready&quot; in a more wholistic sense than teachers <br/>
generally do. *I&#39;m* still not ready to learn about a lot of things - <br/>
wiring and plumbing come to mind. George could leave Do-it-yourself <br/>
books all over the house and I still wouldn&#39;t be *ready* ;)<br/>
