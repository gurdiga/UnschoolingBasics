<br/>
Well if you are sitting around in your pj&#39;s and watching tv all day everyday you may want to consider being more present with your kids. :) If you really feel slovenly and it makes you unhappy change it !<br/>
<br/>
For kids play is hard work. Times of physical labor , times of making logical and emotional connections. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest is nine so this is the little Ive seen from the few long term unschooled teens Ive seen or read about. There will come a point where they will develop a passion and figure out how to make money off it ..... or volunteer work...and they will choose to miss out on other fun.<br/>

Hard work really can be fun. I&#39;m guessing the work you did wasn&#39;t one you chose?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to be &quot;rewarded&quot; for work. We do the work for the joy IN that work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357694629">I&#39;ve heard that argument for school. Suffering is an important prerequisite for enjoying yourself kind of thing. I don&#39;t have to starve to know good food. I don&#39;t have to suffocate to enjoy breathing. My children don&#39;t have to have hard work to enjoy leisure. I was walking my dog tonight and thinking about this, thinking about the idea of without dark there is no light, but it isn&#39;t true, without dark there just isn&#39;t any dark. Finland gets that, don&#39;t they? So they buy good blinds. <br/>
<br/>
Hard work can be fun. I like scrubbing the floor. Linnaea does too. Sometimes when she takes a shower she cleans the whole thing. She and Simon cleaned their rooms a couple of months ago, because they wanted to have clean rooms. Then they hung out and watched a movie together. I don&#39;t know if they got the feeling of a well-earned bit of fun. My hope, actually, is that they won&#39;t ever feel that they need to suffer to enjoy. I think it is a very Puritan thing this idea that suffering now pays for future happiness. I don&#39;t have to suffer to enjoy right now. I am full of yummy homemade ravioli and Simon is sitting near me, David brought me a cup of tea and Linnaea is watching the Simpsons. My life is so good. I need no struggle to enjoy it. <br/>

won&#39;t it be evident from experience?<br/>

Or was the above said to make you believe there was some benefit that  <br/>

<br/>
Those are just some questions to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Coerced, unwilling hard work isn&#39;t the only kind there is. I like the  <br/>
hard work of accomplishing something I&#39;ve decided to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So what the saying has done for you is take the pleasure out of  <br/>
leisure. It&#39;s made you feel guilty. Is that a good feeling?<br/>
<br/>
Guilt can be useful. It can help us make a different decision next  <br/>
time that moves us closer to our goals. Guilt for enjoying life isn&#39;t  <br/>
a good pathway to happiness.<br/>
<br/>
What are your life goals? How is staying in your PJs interfering?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And where will my kids get that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know how great a glass of cold iced tea is when you&#39;re hot and  <br/>
parched? Does that mean everyone should be dehydrated regularly in  <br/>
order to experience that?<br/>
<br/>
Know how great it is to scratch after having a cast removed? Should  <br/>
everyone be required to break a bone to experience that?<br/>
<br/>
The more and harder we work, the greater weekends feel. Is that a  <br/>
reason to work hard? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to work hard because you  <br/>
enjoy the work you&#39;re doing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086350270">My boys do hard work and enjoy it. We plant and maintain a vegetable<br/>
garden all summer long. They are 6 & 5, and enjoy every minute of it..<br/>
from starting seeds, tilling the garden areas and planting.. weeding..<br/>
and picking fresh veggies. It&#39;s hard work, they love it. My 6 yr old<br/>
is trying to make money off it anyway he can. LOL He&#39;s already<br/>
packaging seeds from our green beans and limas to sell (He&#39;s sold 3<br/>
packs and decided to save some for selling in the spring.) He wanted<br/>
to sell pumpkins for Halloween, but that was a learning experience for<br/>
us and did not turn out how we hoped it would :( But, next year...<br/>
we&#39;ll be better ready to handle the pumpkins!! <br/>
<br/>
They also ENJOY cleaning... I use natural, home made cleaners that<br/>
they actually help me make and then they use them. They just come up<br/>
and ask.. can I wash the windows? or the TV? The like to do the<br/>
laundry... &quot;Can I put the stuff in?&quot; Can I push the button? can I CAN<br/>
I CAN I?????!!! LOL So, I think they don&#39;t know the difference between<br/>
hard work and fun... it&#39;s all the same to them, and I hope to be able<br/>
to help them keep it that way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263366107">~~I was<br/>

<br/>
I agree that hard work is good for us.:) I just don&#39;t think fun has to<br/>
be earned. I tend to have a pretty old-fashioned work ethic myself. My<br/>
children can choose their work ethic. They&#39;ll probably learn a lot<br/>
from watching how I respond to my co-workers, my garden, my passions.<br/>
But in the end we&#39;re all different.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;hard&quot;  work is all things I CHOOSE to work hard at, things I&#39;m<br/>
passionate about. I could use my clothes dryer but I prefer to hang my<br/>
clothes to dry. I could use my dishwasher (and still do some) but I<br/>
prefer handwashing my dishes. I could choose to buy all of my food but<br/>
I prefer growing my own.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above choices make a lot more &quot;work&quot; for me, so why do I<br/>
prefer doing those things? Humans often make choices for reasons that<br/>
are more powerful than the whole &quot;work vs. fun&quot; reality. As Kelly<br/>
said, work CAN be fun. For me, it&#39;s less about fun sometimes and more<br/>
about a deep satisfaction. It&#39;s about being authentic and being true<br/>
to my priorities which involve living more independently, consuming<br/>
less and treading gently on the earth.<br/>
<br/>
People will make good choices for themselves if they can flex their<br/>
inner guidance often. Humans often choose difficult things when it<br/>
gets them closer to a goal or desire. I choose hard work because it<br/>
makes me feel good. It didn&#39;t ever feel good when my parents forced it<br/>
though. <br/>

unschoolers thinking &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me or my kids? My kids  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling will not create kids who work all summer long in the  <br/>
garden and then come in and clean. But if mom approaches these  <br/>
projects with joy *and* it&#39;s something that appeals to the kids, that  <br/>
joy will spill over onto the kids and they&#39;ll enjoy being with her  <br/>
and exploring to they extent of their interest what she&#39;s enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
I spent a lot of time enjoying answering email from unschooling lists  <br/>
but that didn&#39;t spill over onto Kat answering emails with me ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about getting kids to do what you want but you&#39;re  <br/>
more likely to end up with helpers if you:<br/>
<br/>
1) Find ways to enjoy what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
2) Own what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s your responsibility. Your deal.<br/>
<br/>
3) Appreciate any little bit they add, because they chose to set  <br/>
aside play for a moment to do something with or for you.<br/>
<br/>
4) Treat their needs with respect so they don&#39;t get the message that  <br/>
the project you&#39;re enjoying is more important than helping them meet  <br/>
their needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247596985">Last week, Deacon, who is four, saw an advertisement for Kabillion.com on tv. He heard there <br/>
were games, and immediately wanted to check it out. There was a hopping type game, <br/>
similar to Super Mario. But intended for 8-10 year olds. He played it for awhile, and then <br/>
wanted me to help him. I couldn&#39;t because he&#39;s already better than I am! He started to get <br/>
pretty frustrated, so I suggested that maybe he take a break and play something else, which <br/>
he did.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days later, he was playing on the computer, and yelled out &quot;Mom, I finished level <br/>
one!&quot; I didn&#39;t know what game he was playing, so I went over to see. And it was the same <br/>
game he had been frustrated with earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that was hard for him. But he kept at it, and kept trying, even though he&#39;s never <br/>
been made to work or do hard things. He did it for the joy of doing it.<br/>
<br/>
These are the stories I tell my mom when she says things like &quot;But how will they learn <br/>
persistence?&quot;</div>
