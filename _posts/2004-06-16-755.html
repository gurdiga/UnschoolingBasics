<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850060531">&quot;The other day I saw his 6-year old brother <br/>
close his eyes, cross his legs, put his hands on his knees and <br/>
say &quot;Ohmmmmmmm&quot; in a meditative way. When he finished, he looked at <br/>
me and said, &quot;THAT&#39;s how I handle my brother.&quot; I wish he&#39;d show his <br/>
parents how to Ohmmmmmmm. :-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What a cool kid! That&#39;s awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here exhausted...we spent all day on the go. The main <br/>
activity was <br/>
tie dying at a friends house and swimming.<br/>
Jalen was SO damn cute, all serious with the dye and so proud of his <br/>
new shirt. <br/>
He&#39;s been wearing it since we pulled it out of the dryer tonight, <br/>
AND today is <br/>
the first day he wore underwear all day (decided to poop and pee in <br/>
the toilet <br/>
for the first time this week, seems potty &quot;training&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
necessary:).<br/>
So after a really hard week with him, he&#39;s had this glorious day, <br/>
and I&#39;m <br/>
wondering why on earth I think he&#39;s so intense. <br/>
Sierra and he are playing with some pvc pipes (they&#39;ve been used to <br/>
build forts <br/>
and water channels this week) talking to each other through <br/>
them...she just said <br/>
&quot;I love you Jalen&quot; really sweet.<br/>
sigh. I just love these moments.<br/>
The tent is set up in the living room for a second night of &quot;camping <br/>
out&quot; and everyone&#39;s bellies are full of sugar and cinnamon tortillas <br/>
we <br/>
cooked a while ago.<br/>
It was a good day. And we&#39;re all colorful in our tie dye.<br/>
<br/>
Oooooohhhhhhmmmmmmmm......:)<br/>
