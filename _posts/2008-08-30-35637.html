<div id="ygrps-yiv-574155543">Hi-- I know this is going to be long so here&#39;s your warning in <br/>
advance !! :)   <br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my kids since my older daughter was 5, and <br/>
she is now 11, her sister is 9 (almost 10--eegads!where does the time <br/>
go)  I always felt I was an unschooler, read the lists, etc.  Our <br/>
curriculum was life, but I always had Curriculum on hand to help spur <br/>
their interests if they wanted to do something in there. We used Oak <br/>
Meadow, Little HOuse on the Prairie, and the Well-trained mind, too.  <br/>
We are using WTM, right now, because my older daughter wants to be a <br/>
vet and wants to be fully ready to go full-speed ahead when she is <br/>
old enough for college (her goal is 16-through minnesota&#39;s post-<br/>
secondary education option program).  She does not want to have to <br/>
study too hard for her generals and wants to go straight into college <br/>
math.  My other daughter loves doing crafts and art and creating <br/>
stuffed animals.<br/>
 <br/>
My problem lies in this-- I am not a stay-at-home mom.  I work 20 <br/>
hours a week at the local hospital and am in college full-time to get <br/>
my nursing degree (because I do not want to put off my goals for <br/>
myself any longer, and we need the money).  Last year, we had an <br/>
exchange student from Korea living with us, and because she had to go <br/>
to public school, my girls tried it.  They did not want to continue <br/>
this year.  So, now that we are homeschooling again, I have been <br/>
struggling to revive my unschooling tendencies which I seem to have <br/>
lost somehow in the past year, and wondering if I EVER was an <br/>
unschooler.  I have a deep-seated paranoia that I am not challenging <br/>
them enough, that I cannot provide enough experiences for them to be <br/>
stimulated by the life surrounding them.  My days off (one weekend <br/>
every other week) are filled with household duties and schoolwork.  <br/>
Right now, I am cooking enough for a couple days of lunches and <br/>
baking bread while doing laundry. I feel I have to account for their <br/>
every moment of the day and whether or not they learned ANYTHING <br/>
other than that the goats have worms again and it is time to trim the <br/>
hooves. (That was Wednesday).   <br/>
<br/>
I understand that unschooling is about trust, and no punishments, I <br/>
accept these whole-heartedly... I just worry that I am going to fail <br/>
my girls in that I will not have given them what they need to achieve <br/>
at the rate and level they want!  My girls are so headstrong.  I <br/>
admire them so much in their convictions - they are both staunch <br/>
vegetarians.  Cait for the last 4 years has not touched anything <br/>
animal, Clio has only minor setbacks.  I try really hard to just let <br/>
go of my fears and trust that they will get what they need somehow, <br/>
but lately I&#39;m really struggling.  I don&#39;t have much time to steer <br/>
them anymore - like, right now they are out in the fields with a <br/>
friend gathering wild blackberries and I feel like I should be out <br/>
there with them, pointing out the plantsand their names and uses... <br/>
helping them identify animal tracks... looking at clouds and talking <br/>
about weather!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is where I am right now, and why I have subsribed to <br/>
this list.  I look forward to reading and trying any advice that <br/>
comes my way!  <br/>
<br/>
TIA-Dawn</div>
