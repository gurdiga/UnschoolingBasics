<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918744539">Well...I posted something, but it got lost in cyberspace I <br/>
guess...once again......<br/>
<br/>
Sierra (8) used to drink coffee once a week, after the Unity <br/>
service. Usually two cups.<br/>
Trevor (15)had me make it about once a week at home, but my French <br/>
Press got broken and I haven&#39;t replaced it yet. All three of my <br/>
older kids like getting a coffee drink if we&#39;re at a bookstore or <br/>
coffee shop.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, we&#39;re big tea drinkers. I&#39;m famous for my Chai, <br/>
made from scratch of course.:) I use Cardoman, cloves, ginger, <br/>
cinnamon sticks, a wee bit of allspice and black pepper. This <br/>
mixture boils (covered) for 20 minutes, making the house smell <br/>
amazing...then we add whole milk and sweetener. Used to make it with <br/>
Soy milk and it was pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
I actually talked about Tea in the conference handbook. :)<br/>

  would you be willing to share your recipe, Ren?  I love chai, but my body won&#39;t tolerate caffiene, so my choices for buying it are limited. I&#39;d love to make my own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389156227">&quot;Espresso drinks actually have less caffeine than regular drip coffee. <br/>
The taste<br/>
is so strong that you use very little in each drink, just a shot or <br/>
two.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I only learned this when I was visiting Alaska this summer! Never knew <br/>
it before.<br/>
Heidi and I were out at our hippy cousin&#39;s house...way out in the <br/>
hills around Fairbanks, where he was building onto his little lofted <br/>
cabin (with a garden on the ROOF) and he told us all kinds of coffee <br/>
facts while we sat and looked out over the valley.<br/>
His place was magical to me...I remember all  the coffee lore we were <br/>
told that day.:) Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404105752">&quot;Chai&quot; actually means tea in Turkish.  We loved the tea in Turkey - <br/>
they serve it in small glasses instead of cups, and they always serve <br/>
it with sugar cubes.  My girls got used to it when we were in Turkey, <br/>
but they rarely have it anymore.  Brenna, my youngest, is 5, and she <br/>
occasionally will have a little coffee and dip sugar cubes in it, so <br/>
she basically has coffee-flavored sugar :)  <br/>
<br/>
My mom (who has 6 kids) used to leave coffee cups all over the house <br/>
and forget about them, and I actually used to LIKE drinking the cold <br/>
leftovers.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115330332">Bring up coffee and people start getting chatty!!  Isn&#39;t it great?!  <br/>
Sorry, I am one of those coffee addicts, like to just see the word on <br/>
the screen!<br/>
<br/>
Both my ds drink coffee occassionally.  We visit the coffee house <br/>
EVERY day and sometimes they order coffee and sometimes they order <br/>
italian sodas, depends what they are in the mood for. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, it is true, a regular cup of coffee has more caffeine than <br/>
your shots of espresso.  We did learn that from our &quot;hippy&quot; cousin and <br/>
I started paying attention to how I felt when I drank regular v. latte <br/>
and the regular definitely has more magic in it!!!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Any of you interested, there has been a show on the history of coffee <br/>
but I can&#39;t remember if it is on the history channel or the food <br/>
channel.  I think it is on the history channel.  We watched the last <br/>
part of it the other night, very interesting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874369152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My mom (who has 6 kids) used to leave coffee cups<br/>

&gt; and forget about them, and I actually used to LIKE<br/>

&gt; leftovers.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to do this with at my grandpa&#39;s house. He liked<br/>
so much sugar in his coffee that we used to joke about<br/>
him having &quot;a little coffee in his sugar&quot;. When he was<br/>
done drinking his coffee there would be a THICK layer<br/>
of sugar syrup in the bottom of the cup. What a joy it<br/>
was to wash *those* cups after they&#39;d been sitting on<br/>
the end table all day! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I started drinking coffee when I was a kid, first by<br/>
taking sips of grandpa&#39;s cold coffee and later by<br/>
&quot;tasting&quot; my dad&#39;s when he would ask me to make him a<br/>
cup in the mornings while he got ready for work. When<br/>
I started &quot;tasting&quot; about half the cup he suggested<br/>
that maybe I should make myself a cup too. LOL<br/>
<br/>
My son (9) has liked sipping my coffee (which I only<br/>
drink occasionally) since he was a toddler and has<br/>
been drinking coffee for a couple of years. He is<br/>
drinking a cup of cinnamon coffee with whipped cream<br/>
as I type this as a matter of fact. My daughter (16<br/>
months) on the other hand wrinkles up her nose and<br/>
vigorously shakes her head at it. <br/>
<br/>
My son and I also love tea and alternate between<br/>
drinking various teas, coffee and teeccino (an herbal<br/>
coffee substitute that is actually very good). We<br/>
usually drink decaf though because I&#39;m super caffeine<br/>
sensitive. We also LOVE chai! I like mine very peppery<br/>
with very little sugar or honey while ds likes his<br/>
less spicey and more sweet. I had a *wonderful*<br/>
pumpkin chai at a coffee shop recently. It tasted like<br/>
it had pumpkin pie spices in it rather than the usual<br/>
chai spices but it was *so* good and really hit the<br/>
spot on that cold night. A friend of mine also turned<br/>
me on to putting pure essential oils in my chai for<br/>
extra kick. Great for cold season too! <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...I just realized after typing up this long post<br/>
that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced myself on this<br/>
list. I&#39;m on lots of lists so I don&#39;t usually do the<br/>
intro thing until I&#39;m ready to jump in on a<br/>
conversation, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done that here<br/>
yet. I&#39;m Jessica, mom to ds Cameron and dd Catherine<br/>
and wife of almost 14 years to Dave. We have been an<br/>
unschooling family pretty much since my first child<br/>
was born, the exception being a brief period of time<br/>
recently when I lost my focus and we did a very<br/>
relaxed, eclectic homeschooling thing. It&#39;s a long<br/>
story but basically I came to my senses and realized<br/>
that I had strayed from our original path and because<br/>
of that we were all becoming unhappy. That&#39;s the<br/>
reason I&#39;ve joined so many unschooling lists after all<br/>
these years of doing it on my own - I needed to get my<br/>
focus back on my family and on *real* learning. Since<br/>
I know no other unschoolers IRL I sought them out on<br/>
line.<br/>

of the honey in their chai latte - sweet but not as sweet as honey. <br/>
Umm I so look forward to that treat every once in a while <br/>
(okay &quot;near&quot; means it&#39;s about 5 minutes from MIL&#39;s house which is 20 <br/>
minutes from our house but we take DS there most every Thursday <br/>
while DH and I have a date  -which often consists of going to the <br/>
cafe and nestling onto their comfy loveseat with a couple of warm <br/>
beverages and talking for a couple hours - last time we were there, <br/>
they had to come remind us that they were closing soon lol).<br/>
