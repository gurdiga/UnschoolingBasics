<div id="ygrps-yiv-849319344">woot! a slam on waldorf while a thumbs up to steiner and a positive<br/>
mention of object relations psychoanalysis. man had to shove in my<br/>
second ; waldorf is a tragedy in many areas with teachers really just<br/>
gleaning off curriculum ideas for the masses, it ain&#39;t based on<br/>
steiners ideas, he would be spinning inkamaloka land for a bit. is the<br/>
object relations person going to the live and learn conference? let&#39;s<br/>
do a bion funshop. <br/>
