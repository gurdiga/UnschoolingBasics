<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206339120">~(Unfortunatly the money that we had set aside for the confrence has<br/>
had to go to fixing Jasons foot, so...maybe next year)~<br/>
<br/>
Darn!! I hope he gets well soon. My dh is a biker too (I only join him<br/>
occasionally these days) so bike accidents freak me out.<br/>
<br/>
As to the group thing.<br/>
I&#39;ve found (in the 10 years we&#39;ve homeschooled) that groups tend to<br/>
get more quiet in the summer. The best times for getting new things<br/>
started, are fall and early January.<br/>
<br/>
Plan a &quot;not back to school&quot; party for unschoolers in August and see<br/>
who shows up! I bet you&#39;ll get a group going. If I could get a decent<br/>
inclusive group up and running in P&#39;cola, you can surely make it work<br/>
in San Diego where althernative types abound!!:)<br/>

  He&#39;s on the mend, he heals so darn fast! It hapened last thursday, and they said he&#39;d need surgury, now it&#39;s looking like he&#39;ll just need a cast, the dr&#39;s are a little confused by the ammount of healing done in so short a time, sooo maybe we&#39;ll still be able to swing the confrence, I hope so. :)<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t go biking with him much, I moved from a beach cruiser with back brakes to a 26 speed hybrid mountain bike over night and got intimidated, I think I need to down grade. lol<br/>

  I had noticed that the local online group quieted down some, but I&#39;m ever hopefull that somewhere in San Diego lurks another RU unschooler looking for others too.<br/>

  I like the idea of a &quot;not back to school party&quot; I think I&#39;ll just have to do that. I&#39;m also thinking about going about are normal routines and posting a general invite online and seeing who shows up...<br/>
   <br/>
  Hehe, you&#39;d think there&#39;d be lots alternative peoples running around here, the homeschooling community has a lot of hard core &quot;school at homers&quot; I was a little (well maybe a lot) surprised....<br/>
