<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519936405">Hello all!<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to explain this without getting too wordy.  Basically,<br/>
here&#39;s our situation.<br/>
We (dh and I) have 3 sons, 7, 4, 1.  We give birth at home, breastfeed,<br/>
share sleep, wear our babies, and practice gentle parenting.  Naturally,<br/>
we&#39;ve been &#39;unschooling&#39; since the birth of our first baby boy.  Anyway,<br/>
here&#39;s my dilemma, and what a dilemma it is!<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo son has such a hard time with the bathroom stuff.  In a nutshell, he<br/>
pees his pants frequently and also poops them.  I just wanted to reach out<br/>
for help here, as you all are in line with how I feel and parent.  I can&#39;t<br/>
go to a doctor only to be told to &#39;put him in time out&#39;, or &#39;start a sticker<br/>
chart&#39;.  YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone out there have any experience with this?  Any ideas?  I&#39;ve<br/>
been working really, really hard on letting go of &#39;my&#39; expectations that he<br/>
stop this, but I&#39;m worried I&#39;m missing something larger.  I&#39;m just so deep<br/>
in this, in many ways, that I may be missing something vital that&#39;s right in<br/>
front of me and I thought some of you  might help me to clarify and get to<br/>
that point of figuring out some solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m going to stop there.  I&#39;m happy to really evaluate this, so please<br/>
post what you will!  I NEED help here.  I don&#39;t want him to feel that I&#39;m<br/>
losing it with this issue, though sometimes, I feel like I really am.<br/>
Having to clean poop off his but, down his leg, out of his underwear, pants,<br/>
socks, 3 times a day, while having a crying baby hanging on my legs, well, I<br/>
guess that might make anyone lose it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527062544">Okay, one big hug at yah and I while I have 5 1/2 yo son and a 13 m<br/>
daughter. We have done the unschooling thing from the beginning with a few<br/>
lapses caused by my inability to let things go and my son&#39;s suddenly wanting<br/>
to go to kindergarten which lasted less then a month.<br/>
<br/>
My son is still working on the potty thing. At age four he wore pull-up more<br/>
then he wore underwear. One of the things that helped at his age was a<br/>
reminder timer. Also, at some point, I can&#39;t tell you exactly what age - I<br/>
told him if he was going to make the mess, then he was going to clean it up.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, he has the decision to wear his pull-up or underwear when he gets<br/>
up in the morning. At night he wears a pull-up...<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to our doctor and he did some tests, there doesn&#39;t keep anything<br/>
medically wrong. He didn&#39;t ridicule my methods. He told me that he will get<br/>
it when he gets it. <br/>

We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pull Ups! :o) <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I would just back off from potty learning  completely for awhile and maybe try again in 3 or 6 months. I know it can seem  like he&#39;s so old already when you&#39;re also changing a baby&#39;s diaper, but he&#39;ll get it eventually. He&#39;s only 4 and some little ones just take longer to get it than others. I wouldn&#39;t worry. My daughter was using Pull Ups for poop until she was 4+. She just had a mental block about using the potty along with complete control to wait for those Pull Ups.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I just posted this to the AlwaysUnschooled list, but thought it might be <br/>
helpful here as well:<br/>
<br/>
****At this stage of the game, even though I didn&#39;t know EC existed at <br/>
the time, I simply did away with the diapers altogether. I felt it was <br/>
important for the child to experience the bodily connections between <br/>
feeling they needed to go to the bathroom and going; I viewed this as an <br/>
important stage in the potty learning process. The child picked out some <br/>
special panties to wear and voila.<br/>
<br/>
We just went right to underwear at this transition stage--or no pants at <br/>
all. I put down big canvas crib pads on the carpet where necessary, had <br/>
a potty in the playroom, cheerfully cleaned up accidents, got lots of <br/>
use out of my bissell spot cleaner, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One of my children was comfortable using the potty and could stay clean <br/>
long before feeling comfortable going poop in the potty. We had <br/>
pull-ups, which we called &quot;park panties&quot; because the parks where we <br/>
lived had no bathrooms (I also traveled with a potty in my van for a <br/>
long time) and because all my kids were day-time free long before they <br/>
were able to go through the whole night--nighttime for all of them <br/>
happened at around 4.5.  At any rate, my one child would simply go put <br/>
on a pull-up to go poop and call me when done for several months before <br/>
using the potty felt comfortable. For daytime, one was 19 mos for <br/>
everything; one was about 2.5; one was about 2.5 for pee/ 3.5 for poop. <br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
I just think each child is different, and boys, especially, tend to need <br/>
a bit more time, anecdotally. I would try not to stress about it or turn <br/>
it into a big issue. Just be prepared and give him the space and help to <br/>
go through whatever process he needs.<br/>
<br/>

goes back in forth with the pullup at night  she just went for almost a mnth in <br/>
underwear and announced at the store  just yesterday  mom I need some more <br/>
pullups  I looked at her and she right away said im really tired I dont sleep as <br/>
well when Im thinking all night i might have to go pee.  Now my 6yr old son <br/>
who totally potty trained himself at 2 is still in pullups at night cause he <br/>
pees LIKE ALL NIGHT LONG!  I know though its getting better cause up until about <br/>
6mnths  wed have to set a clock and get up at night to change his pullup or <br/>
hed pee through it everywhere!  My point is  dont fret he will potty train <br/>
maybe offer him the pullups and give him the choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right!  He seems open to wearing pull-ups, so I guess that&#39;s what I<br/>
need to do right now.  He really could care less if he has pull ups on, or<br/>
big boy undies.  At least pull ups are *meant* to be thrown away, and much<br/>
cheaper to do so than all of his adorable little boxer briefs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083051202">Will he be willing to wear pullups or diapers? It<br/>
wasn&#39;t clear to me from what you wrote, whether he was<br/>
using the bathroom earlier and has had a regression or<br/>
whether he never really started using the bathroom. I<br/>
have a 4 year old and he started using the toilet very<br/>
recently. He&#39;s still in a diaper at nighttime.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was wearing underwear and keeping it clean<br/>
when she was 3. But she went back to diapers for a<br/>
while after her younger brother arrived. From what I<br/>
understand, this kind of regression is quite common.<br/>

  Hi Danielle!  I know you (well, by name) a bit from the Shine list, so hello to you and yours!<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m hoping you, and everyone here, can help me out.  We have some issues here with the potty, too.  I really like the advice above, it&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve done with all three older girls, but my youngest, Lolo is giving us a harder time.<br/>
   <br/>
  Here&#39;s the deal:  Loryn is three (four in May) and has a diagnosis of autism.  More than that, really, is that she doesn&#39;t talk yet.  I mean, at all...at least, no speech with us.  She will sing Wiggles songs, or count with us, or repeat certain words (she likes animal names the best), and once in a while she&#39;ll use &quot;bye bye&quot; in correct context.  No Mama, Daddy, nurse, milk, and definitely no poop or pee. :-)<br/>
   <br/>
  My question is:  would you recommend that I start potty-training Loryn the same way (i.e. getting rid of diapers, using pull-ups at park or co-op days, etc.)? She has shown no interest in going to the potty, except for one or two times, but she&#39;s off again (and running, and giggling) in a second or two.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t even be worried about potty-training now?  I have to admit, some of this comes from pressure from family and friends, who have all KINDS of advice...&quot;If you get her off the tit...if you get her out of your bed...if you don&#39;t carry her, blah, blah, blah.  Seems these people think ignoring mother&#39;s instincts and children&#39;s needs can &quot;fix&quot; anything:  talking, potty-training, &quot;tantrums&quot;, even autism!  LOL Then again, with all that great advice from others (there&#39;s that sarcasm again!), I have to admit that it would just be easier (for ME, I know, not necessarily her) if Loryn WERE potty-trained.  And speech seems to be a big part of that for me...I have to admit, I&#39;m<br/>
 skeptical of EC...but I&#39;ve never tried it, so who knows.  And is it too late to go that route?<br/>
   <br/>
  Many questions, lots of pondering...please excuse my rambling (it&#39;s 1:40 am here in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley), and my three youngest are up with me...Loryn and Ashlyn (also diagnosed with Autism) are playing a Blues Clues game on the computer, Tori (my 7 year old) is listening to Harry Potter on tape.  My oldest, Shelby (12) has deserted us, and is in her room re-arranging things, packing up Beanie Babies and American Girl dolls because she feels the need to have a &quot;teenage&quot; room.  I&#39;m about in tears over this, BTW...LOL...something she feels she needs to do.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, I learn so much from this group, so thanks in advance for any advice that you all can give.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks again,<br/>
   <br/>
  Paige  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569417683">Ok. Well I have  six year old son who still dosen&#39;t go to the bathroom by himself either.<br/>
  I&#39;ve heard the kid&#39;s bladders don&#39;t develop all the way untill they&#39;re like 8- 10 years old, mayby that&#39;s why many young kids still pee their beds. My son likes little prizes, so when he goes by himself  he gets to choose a small prize. When he has help or dosen&#39;t go by himself we give him a sticker. When he gets 7 stickers he gets to choose a small prize. This so far has worked well. Try to find your child&#39;s motivator and work from there. Good luck!  Let me know what works, Patti<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m going to stop there.  I&#39;m happy to really evaluate this, so please<br/>
post what you will!  I NEED help here.  I don&#39;t want him to feel that I&#39;m<br/>
losing it with this issue, though sometimes, I feel like I really am.<br/>
Having to clean poop off his but, down his leg, out of his underwear, pants,<br/>
socks, 3 times a day, while having a crying baby hanging on my legs, well, I<br/>
guess that might make anyone lose it?<br/>
<br/>
ok, i&#39;m really stopping now!<br/>
looking forward to any wisdom anyone can offer!<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
Karen<br/>
