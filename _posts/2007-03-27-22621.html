<br/>
Exactly. We&#39;re an inclusive group, which means that their are people<br/>
of many different faiths (or no faith) present here and I don&#39;t want<br/>
anyone to feel preached at about ANYTHING religious. We&#39;re all here to<br/>
discuss unschooling and gentle parenting, not religious beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
If your religion causes you to hit, spank or shame children, it might<br/>
be time to rethink the whole issue.<br/>

<br/>
First of all, if you&#39;re posting against list guidelines that has<br/>
nothing to do with telling you what to believe. It&#39;s called running a<br/>
list in the way we believe is best and if you don&#39;t like it, there are<br/>
other lists. Our guidelines exist to help everyone get the most out of<br/>
the UNschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, communism isn&#39;t telling people what to believe....it&#39;s a<br/>
philosophy though. You can read more about it here:<br/>

No, I&#39;m not a communist, but I do enjoy reading about points of view<br/>
that are different from my own.:)<br/>

I know there are many Christians on this list. It doesn&#39;t matter. This <br/>
is a secular list to discuss unschooling. Religion doesn&#39;t enter into <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and Mindful Parenting transcend religion. It&#39;s about how <br/>
you treat your children---no matter what your religion or lack of.<br/>

What has been stated is that some things that have been posted are in fact against the posting guidelines of the group. This is not communism, this is a small community of people tied together by email. <br/>

To reinstate what Ren already let you know, you need to read up on the subject of Communism before throwing the term around, it doesn&#39;t make you seem smarter or better than anyone else here to use a big word improperly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565702733">Well, I believe in Jesus with my whole heart and soul. However, this is a group about unschooling and not a strictly christian one. I believe there are groups you can find that ARE christian groups. <br/>
  In no way am I denying Jesus, and I too feel it is my duty to fulfill the great commission. HOWEVER, you can&#39;t do that by shouting at people all the time. Sometimes just being known as a Christian can be the greatest light you can shine. <br/>
  The bible says you are not to behave so that people will see you as a fool. I am NOT saying you are a fool, but to trying to cram Jesus down the throat of those who are not here to hear that, is unfruitful and unwanted. <br/>
  Thats all the Christianity you will hear from me unless someone wants to talk to me off list about it!<br/>

There are christian unschooling lists and if you want them feel free to<br/>

respect.. for everyone and their beliefs.<br/>

I love this list and enjoy all that I read and learn about every day.  Our<br/>
