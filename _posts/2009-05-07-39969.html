<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342592396">The idea of principles instead of rules really resonates with me, but I&#39;m not sure how to make the transition with my young kids. Not that rules and punishments have solved the problems of siblings being disrespectful of each other&#39;s feelings/bodies/belongings or have kept my 4YO from drawing on the walls/toys/books every time she finds a pen lying around and slips out of view with it, of course ... but with &quot;rules and punishments&quot; I know what to do *in the moment*.<br/>
<br/>
So, with a 7YO, 4YO and 18MO, where do you begin?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Living by unschooling principles involves a mental shift. It&#39;s not  <br/>
about seeing how kids are broken and how they need fixed. It&#39;s about  <br/>
being grounded and whole in your principles and helping your children  <br/>
do what they&#39;re trying to do in ways that are safe and kind and  <br/>
respectful.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not trying to impose safety and kindness and respect on them.  <br/>
That&#39;s the big stumbling point for most people, I think. As in &quot;How  <br/>
can I get them to be kind?&quot; You&#39;re using those principles to help  <br/>
your kids meet their needs in ways that keep with your principles.  <br/>
Assume they want the same thing. Assume they don&#39;t want to be unsafe  <br/>
or hurtful. (We are biologically social creatures. We want to get  <br/>
along with others. But we also want our needs met. Kids just don&#39;t  <br/>
have a head full of solutions that allow them to meet their needs  <br/>
*and* be safe and kind. So we help them. We give them ideas, we give  <br/>
them solutions, we brainstorm with them. Make them part of the  <br/>
solution rather than turning them into the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has a good page on principles:<br/>

<br/>
It will help you find more principle based solutions if you see that  <br/>
they aren&#39;t being disrespectful. They have a need and they&#39;re trying  <br/>
to meet it.<br/>
<br/>
It could be they&#39;re not getting enough space. It could be they&#39;re not  <br/>
getting enough of your time one on one. It could be they&#39;re tired. Or  <br/>
hungry.<br/>
<br/>
The more you read, the more you&#39;ll help yourself see a bigger picture  <br/>
of building relationships and helping them find ways to meet their  <br/>
needs, rather than focusing on fixing the ways they&#39;re being &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See the following more as how principles look in action rather than  <br/>
as specific solutions to this problem.<br/>
<br/>
See that your daughter isn&#39;t wrong in her need. She has an  <br/>
overwhelming desire to draw on all sorts of surfaces. You can&#39;t stop  <br/>
this desire. You can, though, ramp up her need by putting up barriers  <br/>
between her and what she needs. Just as telling someone they can&#39;t  <br/>
eat doesn&#39;t make the hunger go away. It just makes them hungry *and*  <br/>
desperate.<br/>
<br/>
See, also, that it&#39;s okay that you want to direct her away from  <br/>
drawing on some things and towards drawing on others. *She* doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to be destructive. She just doesn&#39;t understand. (And it&#39;s  <br/>
possible she can&#39;t yet understand or can&#39;t yet funnel the desire to  <br/>
things that are acceptable.)<br/>
<br/>
Do say no. She shouldn&#39;t be drawing on the flat screen TV with  <br/>
marker! ;-) But the fewer nos she hears, the more powerful they are.  <br/>
Give her the clear message, no, not there and move on to meeting her  <br/>
needs. She needs to color. Help her find ways she *can* color rather  <br/>
than focus on ways she can&#39;t color. Help her find safe and acceptable  <br/>
outlets. Be her partner.<br/>
<br/>
Give her access to places she can color. Lots of different kinds of  <br/>
opportunities. Painting outside with washable paint. Painting with  <br/>
water with big brushes on the house and driveway. Sidewalk chalk.  <br/>
Painting on big paper in the bathtub. Cover the walls with paper.  <br/>
(There are loads of more ideas in the archives.) Feed her desire.<br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s important to you that she not draw on things, *one* way to  <br/>
accomplish that is to be more present. She shouldn&#39;t be alone long  <br/>
enough to be coloring on things. You should be aware of when she has  <br/>
the urge to color and help her find ways that are acceptable. (Being  <br/>
more present is pretty much the first answer to almost all parenting  <br/>
problems. It&#39;s not the only answer. Sometimes we have to go to the  <br/>
bathroom! ;-) But the more that can be proactively avoided, the fewer  <br/>
problems you need to find solutions to! And the more peaceful life is  <br/>
and the more relationships grow.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, since it&#39;s important to you, be more diligent about keeping  <br/>
markers that will damage things put away.<br/>
<br/>
Another is to elicit help from the 7 yo. You are *not* handing over  <br/>
the responsibility to him. If he leaves a marker out, it&#39;s still your  <br/>
responsibility to put it away. He&#39;s not being conscripted into your  <br/>
task! But approach it as &quot;Let&#39;s get these put away so your sister  <br/>
doesn&#39;t use them on things we don&#39;t want  her to.&quot; Engage his help.  <br/>
Invite him to be part of the solution. But it is freely given help,  <br/>
not a responsibility foisted onto him.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a lot of work! But it&#39;s so much more peaceful, so much  <br/>
better at building relationships than being reactive to children&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;faults&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this is proactive, creating an environment where she isn&#39;t  <br/>
set up to fail. This isn&#39;t about being perfect! Oopses do happen. But  <br/>
see the oopses as &quot;learning takes&quot; as Kelly calls them, or &quot;feedback&quot;  <br/>
as Pam once said. They happen to help you figure out solutions that  <br/>
might prevent it for next time. And when feedback does happen, you&#39;ll  <br/>
be able to handle it more calmly -- and focus on the real immediate  <br/>
problem of getting it cleaned up rather than on how &quot;wrong&quot; the child  <br/>
was -- because the feedback&#39;s not happing 20 times a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138434214">One of my favorite books on this topic is called Connection Parenting, written by Pam Leo.  You might have already read it.  It&#39;s not unschooling-focused, but it totally describes what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m taking a class on this right now and it is exactly what I&#39;ve needed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; So, with a 7YO, 4YO and 18MO, where do you begin?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Begin by actively looking for ways to think ahead, plan ahead, be more proactive rather than reactive. Soooooo many of the &quot;what do I do when x happens?&quot; sorts of questions can be turned around: &quot;knowing that x is likely to happen, what can I do to make it less of a problem?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;my 4YO from drawing on the walls/toys/books every time she finds a pen lying around and slips out of view with it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being proactive in this case involves having lots and lots of places where its Okay to write - get a roll of paper from an art or school supply store and paper the walls with it! Actively offer her toys and books that no-one minds seeing a little pen on. Throw a million opportunities a day to write and draw at her, so she&#39;s not in the position of sneaking off with a writing utensil. There&#39;s always something on hand that&#39;s okay - to the point that when she Starts to write on something else, you can say &quot;Oh do that here, instead&quot; - turn your &quot;no&quot; into a &quot;yes&quot;. Get the 7yo involved in this game - how many things can we think of for sissy to draw on today? Wanna join the fun?<br/>
* Water based markers are fun on windows and wash off easily - make your own stained glass! Glass cookware can be fun with this, too.<br/>
*Kids&#39; paints are fun around the house, too. Paint the bathtub and shower curtains. If you have linoleum, paint the floor. <br/>
*Those laminated board books are great for drawing with crayons - the crayon rubs off with a rag. Other plastic surfaces are fun with crayon in the same way. <br/>
*In addition to papering the walls and floors, consider getting some plain white fabric or even tshirts to decorate with markers. <br/>
*Its a good time to buy sidewalk chalk! Then she can draw on almost anything any time. If you want something more elegant, consider chalkboard paint on a wall. It comes in all kinds of colors these days.<br/>
*4yos often like cleaning as much as making the mess - if you make cleaning part of the fun, too. Make sure you have step stools and rags and safe cleaning products like soapy water or vinegar. <br/>
<br/>
Part of the process (a Big part) involves looking inside yourself and asking &quot;why do I have a problem with this?&quot; There are some things... eating in certain places and certain times, for instance, that are cultural expectations - things we can bend and change to suit the needs of the individuals and moments. Other things, expectations of certain kinds of behavior, frequently aren&#39;t developmentally appropriate. You can force-train some kids to do those things, but other kids insist on acting their age all the time - go figure! So it can be helpful to think and read and ask about *when* kids can be expected to do certain things consistently. Certain kinds of &quot;responsible behaviors&quot; come to mind. It can seem like &quot;responsibility&quot; is taught through repetition, but to a large degree, its developmental. Kids *seem* to learn it, when really they just mature, and suddenly &quot;get it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Other things, like hurting siblings, aren&#39;t really negotiable. Naturally, you want All your children to be safe. Those sorts of situations you look for ways to diffuse - ways to meet the Needs of the people involved as best you can in the moment. So the hitting child may need a snack, or some attention (and you make a mental note to look for the signs of that Sooner, next time - more proactivity) and the hurt child might need a cuddle or some verbal affirmation. If there&#39;s an issue with toys, is it possible to trade one toy for another to diffuse the situation? Do some toys need to be kept in a special area, away from younger children? Maybe its worth buying two or three of the same toy for the sake of less conflict.<br/>
<br/>
The main idea with principles, is that you aren&#39;t so much &quot;applying&quot; them as trying to live by them. If you value generosity, for instance, look for ways to be more generous to your family and yourself, too. It sounds a little crazy to say &quot;when your kids are being obnoxious to each other, look for a way to be generous&quot; but really, when kids are at their worst, they are often at times of higher need (just like adults, we aren&#39;t at our best under stress, either). Being generous meets the underlying needs.<br/>
<br/>
In the moment, some things that help are: taking deep, slow breaths, waiting a few seconds for your first &quot;reaction&quot; to pass (if things get physical, get Between fighting kids, but maybe don&#39;t say anything right away), and remembering that everyone is doing the best they can with what they have. <br/>
<br/>
And when &quot;the moment&quot; goes sour, know that you can always apologise.<br/>
