Again,  give me a good solution to having your sleep needs met with<br/>
three older  children that need you and a baby that nurses at  night?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have a friend in exactly that same situation.  I watch her older  children <br/>
(8, 6 and 4 year olds) for a period of several hours different days a  week.  <br/>
She has a baby sitter that comes to her house and watches the older  children, <br/>
her hubby has taken a few days off over the last couple of months  etc.  All <br/>
so she can have time first to just be with the baby, she felt  like she was <br/>
missing that one on one time, second so she can sleep while the  baby is <br/>
sleeping and catch up.  There are more solutions that just ignoring  your need for <br/>
sleep.  And while this mom has found a solution that works  for her there are <br/>
other solutions out there as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just one example,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes there just aren&#39;t other solutions.  When I had Emily, I was<br/>
the first one in our group who had a baby, so *all* my friends were<br/>
still in the &quot;working stiff&quot; mode.  While they were more than willing<br/>
to play &quot;auntie and uncle&quot; on the weekends or an ocaissional night,<br/>
most of the time they were very busy with work and being in that DINK<br/>
mode.  We had no family to turn to either and hiring someone to come<br/>
in was impossible since we went from two incomes to one and we were<br/>
very strapped.  THE solution was for me to give up on long periods of<br/>
sleep.  When we had Mary Elayne and then Keon we were living in a<br/>
different area of the country and while we did have more family close<br/>
by, most of them were busy with their own lives (work, school, their<br/>
own kids) and all our friends were in similar situations as we were.<br/>
Single income families with multiple kids.  We tried doing a co-op<br/>
once where we would each take care of someone else&#39;s kids for a few<br/>
hours each week in exchange for the same.  But, with multiple kids all<br/>
coming down with various illnesses, activity schedules, appointments,<br/>
as well as our own volunteer work or other activities this too was not<br/>
something we could regularly rely on.<br/>
<br/>
I think that your friend has an idyllic situation.  Available friends<br/>
and family and a partner with a flexible work schedule.  Not everyone<br/>
is so graced.  That&#39;s when &quot;giving things up&quot; comes in to play.  And I<br/>
know that I am not permanently &quot;giving things up&quot; because I know that<br/>
my babies are not going to be nursing through the night forever (just<br/>
felt like it at the moment) and that not having a dog (which is one of<br/>
my desires, but vehemently opposed by my co-parent, so I live<br/>
vicariously through a friend&#39;s dog) is also not a permanent thing<br/>
because I know in another dozen (or fewer years) that I won&#39;t be<br/>
living with Dan any longer and can have the freedom to have a dog (or<br/>
not - who knows by then).  I know that my &quot;sacrifices&quot; are only<br/>
temporary and I&#39;m patient enough to wait for those changes in my life<br/>
to open up more avenues to explore that are momentarily on hold.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at a point now where I can get the sleep that I need.  I have my<br/>
own room, I have three kids who put themselves to bed when they are<br/>
tired, I have a comfortable mattress, and I&#39;ve &quot;allowed&quot; myself to go<br/>
to bed when I&#39;m tired instead of feeling like I needed to wait for<br/>
some magical appointed hour or event (such as a spouse arriving home<br/>
late from work.)  I may not have believed that I would get to this<br/>
point just 4 years ago, but voila!  Here I am.  :)  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
putting my desires on hold when it means peace in my home.  Peace is<br/>
much more desirable to me than all the other little things like sleep,<br/>
pets, chores, and perfectly tidy kitchen counters.  :)<br/>
