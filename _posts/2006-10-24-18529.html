<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191506075">***We don&#39;t know whether we should try harder or intervene,***<br/>
<br/>
Intervention seems a weird word.  What you should be doing is making his <br/>
world bigger than just your house or his bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
What is available to him other than &quot;home&quot;?   Are you offering to take him <br/>
places?  Do you make plans for picnics, shopping, walks and outings?  What <br/>
does your family do for fun?<br/>
<br/>
He should have opportunity everyday of getting out of the house.  Go to book <br/>
stores, video stores, music stores,  go for walks, go feed ducks at the <br/>
park, take a drive, go to a new restaurant, go to movies.<br/>
<br/>
At home there should be games to play, people coming for dinner, lively <br/>
talk, family movie watching.<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to force him to see friends or have friends over for him to <br/>
have some social life.  Getting out to shops and movies is a social <br/>
activity.  Watching TV with mom and dad is a social activity.   Having adult <br/>
friends for dinner is a social activity.  Playing board games with mom is a <br/>
social activity.<br/>
<br/>
Forget about the weight and forget about whether he has or wants to see <br/>
friends.  Do things with him, take him places, get out of the house together <br/>
or be at home &quot;together,&quot; engaged, talking, sharing.   His life should be <br/>
interesting and you should be making opportunities for it to be so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685283101">I agree with this completely. Joshua, is what some would call  <br/>
antisocial, he doesn&#39;t like to be part of groups or classes or  <br/>
whatever, he enjoyed tae kwon do for a while, school for a while,  <br/>
clubs at the library, etc. But all in all, he likes who he is, and he  <br/>
likes to do what he likes to do. He doesn&#39;t need the approval or  <br/>
interaction of peers to prove himself. To that end, he&#39;s very social  <br/>
when he wants to be. Take him to GameStop and he tries quite a bit to  <br/>
interact with the people there. He talks with one of the librarians.  <br/>
He has two friends that he&#39;ll seek out, but the rest of the time,  <br/>
it&#39;s not important. Just yesterday I noticed some boys from his old  <br/>
school in the park next to our house. I mentioned it to him, and he  <br/>
just said thanks, but no thanks.<br/>
He loves to spend time with his siblings, but his favorite person to  <br/>
go shopping with is me. He loves to go to the movies with Bre&#39;s old  <br/>
therapist. He likes to go camping with his dad. All normal for him.  <br/>
I&#39;d say he&#39;s social like adults are, real social, not a contrived  <br/>
type that&#39;s created by schools.<br/>
