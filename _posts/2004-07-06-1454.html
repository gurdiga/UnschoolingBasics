<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079318081">Various members of the military are contact points for shipments. We <br/>
sent shoes, etc. to the address at the end of this article:<br/>

dh emailed Karen Lee and she said (back in April) that they need new <br/>
shoes and clothes and athletic equipment (balls, etc.). The address <br/>
she gave is:<br/>
<br/>
Chaplain Zeb Beck<br/>
332 AEW/HC<br/>
APO AE 09315-9997<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also this organization which wants school supplies:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you&#39;re shipping to an APO address, it&#39;s just standard <br/>
domestic rates, but you have to fill out a form (always fun in the <br/>
Post Office with 2 small kids!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859782104">This is  from a website set up by a friend of mine in the Arkansas Army <br/>
National Guard,  currently deployed in Iraq.  _www.cafearkansas.com_ <br/>
(http://www.cafearkansas.com) <br/>
 <br/>
MESSAGES TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS. <br/>
<br/>
Although the  Department of Defense is discouraging bulk mailings to our <br/>
troops, there are  many ways you can support our deployed forces. The following <br/>
are websites for  several organizations sponsoring programs for members of the <br/>
Armed Forces  overseas. <br/>
<br/>
While it would be inappropriate for DoD to endorse any  specifically, service <br/>
members do value and appreciate such expressions of  support:<br/>
<br/>
• Send a greeting via e-mail through Operation Dear Abby at  <br/>
http://anyservicemember.navy.mil/ or www.OperationDearAbby.net, <br/>
<br/>
• Sign a  virtual thank you card at the Defend America Web site at  <br/>
http://www.defendamerica.mil/nmam.html<br/>
<br/>
• Make a donation to one of the  military relief societies <br/>
http://www.aerhq.org/links.htm:<br/>
• Army Emergency  Relief at http://www.aerhq.org/<br/>
• Navy/Marine Relief Society at  http://www.nmcrs.org/<br/>
• Air Force Aid Society at http://www.afas.org/<br/>
•  Coast Guard Mutual Assistance at http://www.cgmahq.org/<br/>
• Donate to  &quot;Operation USO Care Package&quot; at <br/>
http://www.usometrodc.org/care.html<br/>
• Support  the American Red Cross Armed Forces Emergency Services at  <br/>
http://www.redcross.org/services/afes/<br/>
• Volunteer at a VA Hospital  http://www.va.gov/vetsday/ to honor veterans <br/>
who bore the lamp<br/>
of freedom in  past conflicts.<br/>
• Support families whose loved ones are being treated at  military and VA <br/>
hospitals through a donation to the Fisher House at  www.fisherhouse.org <br/>
• Reach out to military families in your community,  especially those with a <br/>
loved one overseas.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. troops deployed to the  Persian Gulf region and other overseas locations <br/>
can now receive personal  messages from family members, friends, neighbors, <br/>
colleagues and supporters via  the pages of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as well. <br/>
&quot;Messages of Support,&quot; a daily section  that debuted March 17, gives family and <br/>
friends of deployed service members a  chance to pass their greetings, words of <br/>
encouragement and announcements free of  charge. &quot;In the past few weeks, we&#39;ve <br/>
received a significant number of e-mail  messages from spouses, parents, <br/>
friends and others trying to get in contact with  their loved ones serving in the <br/>
Persian Gulf region. Running messages from folks  on the<br/>
home front seemed like a natural extension of our mission,&quot; said  &quot;Stars and <br/>
Stripes&quot; publisher Thomas Kelsch. <br/>
