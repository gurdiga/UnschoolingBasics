<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003930589">we only eat when we&#39;re hungry.  i am fascinated by my son&#39;s ability to<br/>
follow his hunger cues and i don&#39;t want to kill it by pushing him to eat<br/>
when he&#39;s not hungry or pushing him to eat more (&quot;clear his plate&quot;) when<br/>
he&#39;s full.  i am also deathly against using food as a reward or punishment<br/>
(like, be good or you won&#39;t get dinner, or, finish that or you won&#39;t get<br/>
dessert, etc.).  i do have general feeding times...like i make him breakfast<br/>
when he first wakes up, and i make lunch after his morning nap, but those<br/>
are his hungriest times and i take advantage of them.  i think it&#39;s far<br/>
healthier to space out &quot;meals&quot; than to eat big meals at specific times.  we<br/>
eat dinner anywhere from 530 to 1030 at night, and sometimes we don&#39;t eat it<br/>
at all but just heat up leftovers or pick throughout the night.  basically,<br/>
we just try to eat when we&#39;re hungry.  my son will eat a little something<br/>
(*really* little - like a kiwi or a piece of toast with peanut butter) every<br/>
couple of hours throughout the day.  i&#39;m trying to do that too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45354362">We do have set mealtimes in our house, not to the minute, but approximate times in which <br/>
a meal preparation SHOULD be done. Part of that is convenience for my husband, who HAS <br/>
to be out of the house by a certain time to walk to work, and is usually starving by the <br/>
time he gets home. Part of that is convenience for me, because if I tried to set up meal <br/>
times for every single person in the house, we&#39;d have nine different mealtimes. Part of it is <br/>
convenience for the children, because they can anticipate a large meal being ready.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, even with set mealtimes, we don&#39;t FORCE the children to sit with us, and <br/>
we don&#39;t force them to eat what is prepared by me (although anymore, Josh cooks on <br/>
Wednesdays, and half the time the girls help, so it&#39;s not really &#39;me&#39; anymore). I do ask the <br/>
children to sit with us, as I announce that dinner is ready, because it&#39;s a good time to all <br/>
sit together and discuss the day (especially in light of dh missing most of it) They are <br/>
usually amenable, they know that the meal is at the same time every day and have learned <br/>
to time themselves to end games to join us. They also trust us that if they aren&#39;t ready to <br/>
join us, that they can finish what they are doing and join us. They can eat all or part of the <br/>
meal that is in front of them, they can choose to reheat a more preferred left-over or <br/>
preprepared snacks. All-in-all, they love sitting with us, and usually I don&#39;t prepare foods <br/>
that are far outside of their acceptance level. :-)  Every once in a while we&#39;ll make <br/>
something with tunafish, and several kids find it revolting and move on quickly. <br/>
Lunch is usually the same, dh walks home from work to eat, and we try to get it on the <br/>
table at a certain time so that he doesn&#39;t miss more work than he needs. it is much more <br/>
laid back than dinner however, and breakfast is even more relaxed, because Josh and <br/>
Emily usually sleep much later than the rest of us, usually only dh, Bre, Dan and Sam eat a <br/>
big breakfast, the rest of us nonmorning people will reheat an hour or more later, or just <br/>
have cereal.<br/>
<br/>
Because there are so many of us, and grocery costs could skyrocket very easily, we do <br/>
have a calendar that only has meals on it. We have a party the last day of the month, kind <br/>
of like a monthly mardi gras, where we dig out all the leftovers, all the snacks, fruits and <br/>
juices. We take stock of what we have, eat what we want, and decide what was good <br/>
enough to repeat, what new recipes we want to try, and assign a big meal to each day of <br/>
the month. Then we make a grocery list and try to buy all of our food for the month. The <br/>
calendar isn&#39;t set in stone, but it does make things more convenient and takes a lot of <br/>
decision making out of the way, and I always know that I have what I need to make the <br/>
meal. We do look at activities for the month, like our weekly potluck I know to make <br/>
something that easily stretches portions more, and on our big playdate days, we always <br/>
plan either a crockpot dinner or something like nachos. This saves on time, and on energy <br/>
because we&#39;re always tired after a day like that and wanting fast food. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know if I covered it all or left a big gaping hole that has you scratching <br/>
your head. :-)  We do have snacks out all the time, cut fruit, deli meats and cheese, <br/>
crackers and candy, so they have access to eat anytime they like. Most of the older ones <br/>
have chosen to limit their snacking after i&#39;ve started cooking dinner, because they like <br/>
what we&#39;re making, and want to eat more of it. Most of the younger ones can snack right <br/>
up til dinner and still eat a good portion of food. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513409478">This sounds a lot like us. We have set meal times for dinner only. I try to <br/>
have a home cooked meal out once a day. But sometimes DH and I are the only <br/>
ones that eat. DH works FT from home and so do I.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids come to the table pretty naturally, I guess at some point we might <br/>
have set them at the table when they were little. My kids are older and <br/>
enjoy the family time as well. I announce dinner, and sometimes everyone <br/>
comes, sometimes nobody comes.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I&#39;m making sloppy joes, everyone LOVES them, except me! So they eat <br/>
and I fix something else. But I try to sit with them either way. They have <br/>
all exprssed disapointment when I don&#39;t eat at the table with them. I&#39;m glad <br/>
that 16 years into parenting my kids still like me around.<br/>
