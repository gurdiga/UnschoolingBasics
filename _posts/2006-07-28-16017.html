material with a little kindergarten thrown in for a challenge she is<br/>
doing wonderful and is learning a lot she is a true blessing to teach&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Melinda....at this list, you will hear about how you don&#39;t need to<br/>
teach her at all. You will hear about how damaging schooling can be<br/>
and how to let go of grade labels.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the list descpription (if you haven&#39;t) and check out some<br/>
of the information in our &quot;links&quot; section. Thanks!<br/>
