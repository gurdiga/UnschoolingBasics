<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062002633">Hello all of you wonderfully wise people.  I&#39;ve been lurking for <br/>
about a month now and you guys come up with some great <br/>
solutions/answers to &#39;problems&#39; people new to unschooling come up <br/>
against.  I think that it is great that those of you that have been <br/>
unschooling for years still find it fun to help others through those <br/>
first few months or years of deschooling themselves and unschooling <br/>
their kiddos.  Ok, enough, gushing.  I have the privledge to have 4 <br/>
great kids at home + 1 that is married already.  Our kids are 7 yo <br/>
girl, 5 yo twins both girls too, and 2 yo boy.  All of the girls in <br/>
our family have been adopted, our son was a &#39;surprise&#39; (aren&#39;t all <br/>
kids?)  I was homeschooled growing up and my husband realized long <br/>
ago that he never learned anything in school that he didn&#39;t teach <br/>
himself, so of course we&#39;ve always know we would keep our kids home.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for the last year, before that we were <br/>
pursuing a laid back philosophy (good books are still all around us <br/>
and the kids love it when I read a book to them, mostly because it <br/>
isn&#39;t me just sitting on the couch reading them a book.  I love to <br/>
act out the voices and and we make up scenes that would go with it <br/>
and they get up and pretend that they are the characters in the <br/>
story.  Anyway, I digress)  Thanks for the chance to say HI and hope <br/>
to be hanging around here for a while...<br/>
