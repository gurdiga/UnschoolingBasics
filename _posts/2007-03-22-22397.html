<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768083555">She sounds a lot like I did when my first child as<br/>
born. I never actually looked into vaccinations, I was<br/>
only going with the mainstream views. Maybe she has<br/>
looked into them, but I suspect not. She posted in her<br/>
blog a few months ago ranting at stupid people who<br/>
thought that autism was caused by vaccinations and how<br/>
very dangerous it was to not vaccinate your child.<br/>
