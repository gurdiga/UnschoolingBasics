enough, when I let THAT go, I started looking forward to my family <br/>
life in the &quot;late hours&quot;.  The great thing too is that I still get to <br/>
do things that I always used to enjoy during &quot;MY time&quot;.  We all end <br/>
up doing our own thing in the evenings, like playing on the computer, <br/>
or (if you&#39;re me) reading a novel, tinkering in the garage or <br/>
whatever. My four year old will sometimes come and cuddle with me on <br/>
the porch swing, but the pressure is off.  There are no negative <br/>
feelings or anyone saying, &quot;two minutes before bed&quot;....we just enjoy <br/>
the moon  and chat about silly things.   Basically, when I changed my <br/>
perspective, I let go of threats, manipulations and all those yucky <br/>
trappings.  Now our evenings are mellow and enjoyable.  Nobody <br/>
fights, I&#39;m not stressed out, it works! <br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking that this is just one season in my life.  One day <br/>
I&#39;ll probably miss these &quot;late hours&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>10 pm isn&#39;t really all that late to me. I&#39;m still up with my 4yo <br/>
right now. It&#39;s 9:19 pm. We&#39;ll probably go to bed soon because we&#39;re <br/>
both getting tired. Is your 4yo able to sleep as late as she wants <br/>
in the morning? The crankiness may be from being woken before she&#39;s <br/>
ready. Or it could just be normal crankiness after a long day. <br/>
<br/>
I think with that many children in that age range, you will probably <br/>
need to get rid of your idea of getting &quot;me&quot; time the way you are <br/>
thinking. Find ways to get that time while they are around or during <br/>
the day or just decide to let it go for now with the understanding <br/>
that as they get older you will have more time for yourself (and <br/>
will probably lament that you don&#39;t have as much kid time anymore). <br/>

   <br/>
  Reading this makes me realize how far I&#39;ve come in the way I think about &#39;bedtime&#39; and &#39;my time&#39;.<br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;re relatively new too, just read John Holt last summer and it all sprouted from there.<br/>
   <br/>
  If you read back in the archives under bedtimes, you&#39;ll find lots and lots to address your concerns.  Warning: you might not love what you read on first read - I didn&#39;t!<br/>
   <br/>
  There are lots of things you can do to &#39;set the mood&#39;, as in shut down the house as if everyone is going to bed, which really helped us make the transition, but every kid is so different, and it&#39;s about giving them the freedom to learn when they&#39;re tired, and taking the power struggle out of going to bed/sleep.  We thought what we were doing was working, and it pretty much was until they decided they wanted to decide for themselves, then bedtimes became very intense and unpleasant.  Giving up control has allowed it to be peaceful again.<br/>
   <br/>
  The first while we did this we didn&#39;t just start saying yes more (which is what the wise ones recommend), we threw out all rules and restrictions and as a result there was *huge* party time around here for awhile with bedtimes between midnight and 1 for our 3 year old twins.  Now that month forced me to grow!!!  And then they settled out.  We have an evening routine now that works for us, and the girls let us know when they&#39;re tired, which is usually around 10.  What I love is that they don&#39;t have to push through and pretend they&#39;re *not* tired just to stay up later than they would be &#39;allowed&#39; to if we had rules.<br/>
   <br/>
  Also, when I honour what they&#39;re telling me, allowing them to go to sleep when their little bodies are tired and not some preordained time so I can get &#39;my time&#39;, the &#39;my time&#39; just sort of magically happens.  It&#39;s like the time available to me expands or something, weird, but real.<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope this helps a little, and I really encourage you to peruse the archives!<br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
you are right.  I have always thought that my day ends at bedtime, and bedtime is around 7 or 8.   She can sleep as late as she wants, as we do not have &quot;school&quot; or &quot;stuff&quot; to do in the morning.<br/>
I know she is beginning to give up naps, and generally keeps herself occupied during that time.  I imagine, that is what I have to do.. change how I think about my ME time.  Thank you.<br/>
 I will try to enjoy the times she is up with me, (and give up the things I do at night for now)<br/>
I appreciate your response<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426337662">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This was one of my recent &quot;sticking points&quot; along the unschooling path;<br/>
bedtime.  When my kids were very little - babies and toddlers - there was<br/>
never a bedtime.  The kids went to bed when they were tired, via nursing to<br/>
sleep.  And then, when they were around 3ish, bedtime reared its controlling<br/>
head.  I&#39;m guessing that by that time of their lives (particularly my first<br/>
son, who has Autism and took mucho energy!), I was tired and worn out<br/>
(mostly my fault, though I&#39;d never have admitted it!) and decided that damn<br/>
it, I needed MY time back.  So bedtime became a Big Deal, and the fighting,<br/>
crying, whining, threatening, punishing phase began in our household.  Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I re-read John Holt in December and was reminded how beautiful and *right*<br/>
the unschooling lifestyle was for me.  We started moving in that direction<br/>
and are still slowly saying &quot;yes&quot; more and giving more and more control back<br/>
to the kids (where it belongs!).  For several months I was still wound up<br/>
pretty tightly over nighttime.  The official bedtime was gone, which made<br/>
the kids thrilled, but I was still resentful of MY time being sucked away.<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know how it happened, but after reading your post, I<br/>
realized that my resentment is gone.  Totally gone.  I still get tired at<br/>
night, and if loud exuberant play is happening late (for me that would be<br/>
10ish), I definitely request that we all get settled down and redirect<br/>
people to quieter pursuits.  But there&#39;s no more massive stress or upset for<br/>
me.  My 8yo son is often up to midnight, quietly playing on the computer or<br/>
DS in his room.  We often don&#39;t even know he&#39;s still up he&#39;s so quiet!  My<br/>
4yo son usually crashes out around 10-11, with gentle help from us (i.e. not<br/>
telling him to go to bed, but when he is acting tired, suggesting bed and<br/>
helping him go that direction if he feels he is ready).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a strange concept at first, and it feels strange for a while.  But<br/>
everyone I hear from on this subject says the same; those feelings of<br/>
awkwardness go away, replaced with peace and relief that the bedtime battles<br/>
are over for good!<br/>

<br/>
I, too, am new to unschooling and have this problem with my 4 & 6 yo.  I<br/>
feel like I need MY time.  But Mel&#39;s comments made me think of this:  My<br/>
6-month old doesnt&#39; have a bedtime (neither did the older kids when they<br/>
were babies.)  It wasn&#39;t until about 2 that I felt the need to enforce a<br/>
bedtime, because I needed my own time to unwind.  But when they were babies,<br/>
I actually loved the special late family times together.  Some of our best<br/>
memories of our babies are at night when we just hung out being silly,<br/>
babbling, playing peek-a-boo, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now I wonder why that had to end!  For some reason, I felt the need to<br/>
separate myself from the kids at night, so I could unwind.  I still feel<br/>
this way a little.  (We&#39;re slowly coming out of the &quot;bedtime&quot; control).  So<br/>
far, it seems like when I ease up on control, I seem to want to spend more<br/>
time with the kids, and don&#39;t need that bedtime break as much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084948845">I can remember very clearly lying in bed with Simon when he was little and resenting the hell out of David getting to stay up and do things on his own. I can remember being resentful of how little time we were going to get together, David and I, given that I was stuck in bed with Simon waiting for him to fall asleep. I used to do kegel exercises to stay awake and worked on learning how to wink my left eye which I couldn&#39;t do. But half the time I&#39;d fall asleep anyhow and it made me furious when I&#39;d wake up  and discovered that I&#39;d slept through all of &quot;my time&quot;. The concept of &quot;my time&quot; was an awful burden. It&#39;s like having a time limit on video game access, I had to have it, it was &quot;my time&quot;. The rest of my day was other people&#39;s but this little bit in the evening, all mine (rubbing hands and cackling). Once I got rid of the idea, once we started to relax about bedtimes, I had much less need to have some sort of time all my own. I can see other things as<br/>
 being part of my time. Sitting and knitting, chatting to David while we cook together, having that 20 minutes in the morning before everyone else is out of bed. <br/>
<br/>
It also got rid of the them versus me mentality, or at least helped to get rid of it more. I don&#39;t see a &quot;my time&quot; versus &quot;their time&quot; dichotomy so much anymore. There are some mornings when I miss my 20 minutes where I have to reframe my vision of how my morning was going to go, but that is usually the worst that it gets. Sometimes now they stay up later than I do. The only constraint is not waking other people. If they get too loud they need to go to bed, or figure out something else that they can do quietly. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s when we get &quot;our time&quot; without interruptions (mostly anyway).<br/>
Evening is a swirl of activity but I don&#39;t need as much sleep as the<br/>
kids so dh and I will snatch some time for ourselves on mornings when<br/>
there isn&#39;t anything else going on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually tea on the deck together, talking and watching the birds<br/>
or discussing garden plans. Morning is very peaceful and a great time<br/>
to catch up and connect....it&#39;s especially sweet as sleepy-eyed,<br/>
waking-up children start to emerge and join us for tea and cuddles. <br/>

  With my 2 year old this is what we do. At around 10:00PM when daddy goes to bed we go upstairs and brush our teeth than I go into my ds&#39;s room and I can watch the shows I dvr&#39;d in his tv. She will either play in her room or in the room with me and when she is ready she jumps on my lap and nurses to sleep.<br/>
  THis can take 15minutes or 2 hours. Because I am doing something I want it does not drive me crazy if it is taking long. I also play with her on the floor while watching my shows a lot or we read books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637651994">We&#39;ve never had scheduled bedtimes in our home.  We just sleep when we get<br/>
tired.  DS is now 3.  I travel a lot for my job, Mon-Thurs a lot of weeks.<br/>
So the nights when I&#39;m not home, DW and DS are usually in bed by around 9pm.<br/>
We all cosleep, always have.  DS has never had his own bed/bedroom/nursery.<br/>
One of them indicates they&#39;re sleepy, and they start winding down, brushing<br/>
teeth, etc., and heading toward bed.  If I&#39;m traveling that week, I get home<br/>
on Thurs and am up &#39;til at least midnight, DS usually stays up w/ me, and<br/>
around 11pm I&#39;m done w/ chores/playing and ready to wind down.  I&#39;ll plop in<br/>
front of the TiVo to watch motorcycle racing from the past few days, and he<br/>
cuddles up with me.  Sometimes he watches with me, other times we also read<br/>
a book or he watches one of his movies on his little media player.<br/>
<br/>
Fri, Sat, and Sun nights vary.  I&#39;m often a night-owl (up &#39;til 1 or 2 am),<br/>
and often DS will go to bed with his mom, but then get up later and come<br/>
hang out with me for a bit.  And I&#39;m the first one out of bed in the morning<br/>
95% of the time (by 7am or so), followed by DS about an hour later.  Then<br/>
we&#39;ll get some breakfast going, and DW gets up last.  On days when I&#39;m out<br/>
of town, DS is up first about 70% of the time, and he&#39;ll play for a while<br/>
(with the dog, or whatever) before waking up his mom (usually with caresses,<br/>
but sometimes by jumping on the bed) saying &quot;Sun up.  Mommy wake up.  Boy<br/>
want eat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nap times vary.  DS will sometimes fall asleep in odd positions like leaning<br/>
on the couch playing with a toy.  A few weeks ago we were all in the<br/>
kitchen.  He was sitting on a bar stool eating something, eyes heavy, and<br/>
suddenly I noticed that he was completely asleep, sitting up, balanced on<br/>
the stool.  I took a picture, then carried him to the couch and he never<br/>
stirred.  I like a mid-day nap, as does DW, so he&#39;ll sometimes nap with one<br/>
of us.  He almost always falls asleep in the carseat, so even if it was for<br/>
only 10 minutes he usually won&#39;t nap later that day after a carseat nap<br/>
during errands.  And if we&#39;ve stayed home that day, he&#39;ll either nap for<br/>
30-45 mins sometime between 3-6pm, OR he just falls asleep in the living<br/>
room (often on the couch) 9pm (if no nap that day) and we carry him to bed.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always trusted DS to sleep when he wants, since birth.  He nursed to<br/>
sleep almost exclusively &#39;til he was nearly 3, whether for nap or nighttime.<br/>
I can remember only a few times when DS wanted to stay up later than mom and<br/>
dad.  <br/>
<br/>
He has the occasional &quot;cranky&quot; morning due to inadequate sleep, but it&#39;s<br/>
pretty rare, plus it&#39;s self-resolving.  If he stayed up too late with me,<br/>
and got up too early, he&#39;ll usually nap before lunch and then be rested and<br/>
fine after that.  If we&#39;re up with an alarm clock (usually only one day a<br/>
week) because of a planned activity, it usually involves a car trip so he<br/>
just sleeps in the car.  Sleep is pretty much a non-issue in our house--just<br/>
something we do, like eating, when we want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555498696">~~I&#39;m curious what sort of bedtime routine you have. Being so new to this,<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time seeing which of my &quot;routines&quot; are being controlling,<br/>
and which are helpful.~~<br/>
<br/>
  I forget how olds the original poster&#39;s kids are - our twin girls are 3 1/2.<br/>
   <br/>
  Our &#39;routine&#39; is pretty loose, but the framework is there nonetheless.  Mostly the evening is hanging out/playing/watching a movie/snacking (they often specifically ask to watch &quot;hap a moobie&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  I keep snacks out and available (just a continuation of the monkey trays we have going most of the day) which lessens the chance of them asking for food once they get into bed.  When we threw all rules and control out the window we had about a month of them saying &quot;I need something&quot; after they were all tucked in...and asking about 12 times before they finally stayed in bed.  Now that doesn&#39;t happen, and I suspect it&#39;s because they know they can have whatever they want whenever they want, so they&#39;re completely relaxed about it.  On occasion one of them has asked for something when they can barely keep their eyes open and I&#39;ve asked if it can wait until morning, and usually the answer is yes.<br/>
   <br/>
  We shut the house down as if we are all going to bed, this has been a big one for us.  We have little lights around the top of the ceiling in the living room (xmas lights) that we turn on that leave just enough light to see but not enough for it to be stimulating.  All the other lights are off except the bathroom night lights and their lamp and night light in their bedroom.<br/>
   <br/>
  They had lots of say recently in picking out their bed, picking out sheets for it, choosing where in their rooms they want it to be, etc., which I think really helps them enjoy their bedroom and being in bed.  They chose a bed they had room to sleep in together.  I make suggestions when I see them rubbing their eyes or looking really tired that we snuggle in bed with some books.  Most times they think that&#39;s a good idea, and sometimes they choose to watch a little of their favourite something that&#39;s been recorded and then we crawl in.  Dh or I lie down with them and they&#39;re usually out in under 5 minutes.<br/>
   <br/>
  I suggest a bath earlier in the evening because I know they love playing in the tub.  Every second/third night they say yes, sometimes alone, sometimes together.  I just hand them their toothbrushes with toothpaste on them in the tub and they brush.  I suggest teeth brushing every morning/every evening and sometimes they go for it and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>
   <br/>
  On occasion one will want to sleep in our bed and the answer is always yes, then we just move them into their own bed after they fall asleep.<br/>
   <br/>
  Just know that once you relax rules and control it will perhaps look a little chaotic, but once they trust they will get their needs met and what they want is important to you they will relax into that.  At least mine did.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hope some of that helps.  Again, this is what worked for *our* family, and none of it may apply to you.  Take what you like and leave the rest!<br/>
   <br/>

Things do seem long when you are in them, but remember, children <br/>

acceptance and peace and joy with where you are in your stage of <br/>
life.  My dental hygenist was cleaning my teeth and said how happy <br/>

much work it had been to be a mom.  She said she&#39;d never want to <br/>
have more kids.  I replied how wonderful life is that we can all be <br/>
grateful for whatever stage in life we are in, for I couldn&#39;t <br/>
imagine not having young children and in fact wished I had more.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do need times for our brains to sort of settle down once in a while  <br/>
- we need time to process all the constant input, to integrate it.  <br/>
But, that can happen in random free moments or while doing things like  <br/>
washing dishes or taking a shower. It can happen when a child is with  <br/>
us. We don&#39;t have to be totally ALONE, much less alone for very long.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote about this just a few weeks ago on this list -- here&#39;s a  <br/>
shortened version:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you realistically take time out for peace and quiet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t get much when your kids are young. I get a LOT these days -  <br/>
mine are 17, 20, and 23.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to take 1-minute mental vacations. Go into the bathroom, shut  <br/>
the door and your eyes, visualize yourself somewhere peaceful and  <br/>
quiet. Don&#39;t expect more than 60 seconds or you&#39;ll be frustrated and  <br/>
disappointed instead of calmed. These mini-vacations can make a  <br/>
gigantic difference.<br/>
<br/>
Recognize your worth as a mother and partner so that doing a good job  <br/>
in those roles gives you self-satisfaction. Pay more attention and  <br/>
make mental notes when you &quot;achieve&quot; things like connecting with a  <br/>
child, supporting a child, etc. Make eye contact and smile a lot.  <br/>
THOSE are the moments that really refresh and reinvigorate you.<br/>

pressuring new parents to get out and do things for themselves and/or <br/>
as a couple and leave the baby/children, it would be nice if society <br/>
as a whole would support parents in being with their children. It&#39;s <br/>
hard to let go of the idea of &quot;me time&quot; when you&#39;re being hit with it <br/>

you could be if you aren&#39;t getting it. <br/>
<br/>
I have friends who say they are better mothers because they get a <br/>
break from their kids when they send them to daycare/preschool. If <br/>
they didn&#39;t have that time, they&#39;d be cranky, mean mommies. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if that&#39;s true because I&#39;m not them. I do know that sometimes I <br/>
can get cranky and mean if I have an expectation that&#39;s not being met. <br/>
Usually, as soon as I can change my perspective and thinking and let <br/>
go of the expectation, I&#39;m not so cranky and mean anymore. I don&#39;t <br/>
think those friends of mine have ever tried that. When I bring up <br/>
something like that they look at me like I&#39;m speaking a foreign <br/>
language or something. They just immediately go for what they&#39;ve <br/>
always known, which is to separate themselves from their kids. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s not really about personal time. It&#39;s about wanting to <br/>
feel good, be happy. So, instead of thinking I have to have &quot;me time&quot; <br/>
to do that, I want to find ways to feel good and be happy with my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633785653">William (15mths) has now started &quot;fighting&quot; bedtimes. I too like &quot;me <br/>
time&quot; but I&#39;m starting to think that the time I&#39;m actually <br/>
getting &quot;alone&quot; with df is not worth fretting over william for an <br/>
hour or more to get him to sleep. I have read through sandra dodds <br/>
website page on sleep and everything she says makes sense to me... <br/>
but<br/>
i still feel scared about letting go of that last bit of control over <br/>
my life. I have made my mind up now, at last, after thinking about it <br/>
for too long. From tomorrow we are not going to have &quot;bedtimes&quot; <br/>
anymore. <br/>
Df often works late and he has said that he doesnt mind William being <br/>
awake late because he then gets to see his son more than a few hours <br/>
on the weekend. <br/>
I didnt come into motherhood or family life from the &quot;un - side&quot; of <br/>
things. in fact i remember quoting supernanny - even gina ford <br/>
*cringe* <br/>
I am glad i found this way of living and that my simple idea of <br/>
homeschooling Wiliam for the first few years has turned into a whole <br/>
new life philosophy as corny as that sounds ;)<br/>
I feel people wanting to say things to me already about co - sleeping <br/>
and i know i probably will tip the scales and they WILL say something <br/>
about our &quot;household not having bedtimes anymore&quot;...<br/>
and there is another plus side to this: i get a lie in as william <br/>
will consequently sleep longer in the morning! ;)<br/>

&gt; language or something. They just immediately go for what they&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; always known, which is to separate themselves from their kids. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s not really about personal time. It&#39;s about wanting to <br/>
&gt; feel good, be happy. So, instead of thinking I have to have &quot;me <br/>
time&quot; <br/>
&gt; to do that, I want to find ways to feel good and be happy with my <br/>
kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some kids do really well with routines generated by parents. Others <br/>
need parents who can adjust to *their* routines. It all depends on <br/>
the individual.<br/>
<br/>
Mo has a variable routine. Her sleep cycle periodically shifts by a <br/>
couple hours - so sometimes she goes to bed around 8 and then will <br/>
all of a sudden shift to going to bed at 10, and her wake-up times <br/>
shift accordingly. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any set pattern to <br/>
*when* her cycle shifts, but each phase lasts a month or two. It <br/>
usually takes me a couple weeks to adjust - the first week is mostly <br/>
spent wondering if she&#39;s actually shifted again or is it just a <br/>
couple days out-of-kilter? and more recently this has become <br/>
complicated by *my* need to go to bed so that I can get up for work. <br/>
<br/>
Mo&#39;s also not the sort of kid who &quot;settles down&quot; to sleep. If <br/>
anything, she gears up a notch in the evenings - from around 630 - <br/>
until she crashes. She&#39;s not cranky, its not an overtired thing, <br/>
more a natural rhythm. We call it &quot;That time of day&quot;. Its part of <br/>
her routine.<br/>
<br/>
So our &quot;bedtime&quot; routine involves getting out of Morgan&#39;s way a <br/>
whole lot. Mostly in pretty physical ways! but also in terms of <br/>
helping her find solutions so that she can play and play and play <br/>
without driving the rest of us crazy. <br/>

<br/>
I am relatively new to the unschooling thought process.. and through<br/>
this group, have started reading Unconditional Parenting, I see that<br/>
many of what is said in this conversation is of value to me....<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
-===-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But a specific question.... how do I get my 4 year old to go to sleep?<br/>
If I don&#39;t threaten, and I don&#39;t take away the music and the lights,<br/>
etc.  How can I get her to go to bed?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need her to go to bed? Why is it important to *you* that she <br/>
sleeps when she isn&#39;t tired?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your point?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to let her<br/>
have some leeway into where she sleeps, or what she brings to bed with<br/>
her, but.. am stumped.  She is not getting to bed until 10 at night,<br/>
and is cranky the next day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
May she wake when she&#39;s rested? Or are you waking her before she&#39;s <br/>
finished sleeping?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Any suggestions would be helpful.  I have<br/>
4 children, 2-18, and need to have some down time for myself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? Why do you feel this need? Because society says you should? And <br/>
why must it be at night?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  With her staying awake all eve, I feel slightly resentful that I am <br/>
missing MY<br/>
time.... is this not right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Well, you CHOSE to have children. Did you think children would be like <br/>
dolls? Where you could lay them down and forget about them until you <br/>
were ready to play again?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not like that. Momhood is a 24/7 kind of thang. The good <br/>
news---and the bad news---is that they outgrow you and eventually don&#39;t <br/>
need you at all. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please enjoy this time you have with them. It&#39;s gone so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
It really is about accepting where you---and they---are NOW and making <br/>
the most of your time together.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to fight with her every night---or you can choose to <br/>
enjoy the precious time you *get* to spend at night together. What&#39;s <br/>
the rush? Seriously?<br/>

<br/>
   Reading this makes me realize how far I&#39;ve come in the way I think <br/>
about<br/>
&#39;bedtime&#39; and &#39;my time&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
   If you read back in the archives under bedtimes, you&#39;ll find lots and <br/>
lots to<br/>
address your concerns.  Warning: you might not love what you read on <br/>
first read<br/>
- I didn&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---I was going to say, Go back and read Jodi&#39;s early posts! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve come a L-O-N-G way, baby! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   There are lots of things you can do to &#39;set the mood&#39;, as in shut <br/>
down the<br/>
house as if everyone is going to bed, which really helped us make the<br/>
transition, but every kid is so different, and it&#39;s about giving them <br/>
the<br/>
freedom to learn when they&#39;re tired, and taking the power struggle out <br/>
of going<br/>
to bed/sleep.  We thought what we were doing was working, and it pretty <br/>
much was<br/>
until they decided they wanted to decide for themselves, then bedtimes <br/>
became<br/>
very intense and unpleasant.  Giving up control has allowed it to be <br/>
peaceful<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right---a peaceful late night is better than a stressful early <br/>
one---especially when it ends up about the same amount of time!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   The first while we did this we didn&#39;t just start saying yes more <br/>
(which is<br/>
what the wise ones recommend), we threw out all rules and restrictions <br/>
and as a<br/>
result there was *huge* party time around here for awhile with bedtimes <br/>
between<br/>
midnight and 1 for our 3 year old twins.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right---just take it one night at a time and don&#39;t rush it. Don&#39;t push <br/>
the &quot;bedtime&quot; or &quot;sleep&quot;. Just pave the way for a restful couple of <br/>
hours. Sleep will come.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And then they settled out.  We have an evening routine now that works <br/>
for us,<br/>
and the girls let us know when they&#39;re tired, which is usually around <br/>
10.  What<br/>
I love is that they don&#39;t have to push through and pretend they&#39;re <br/>
*not* tired<br/>
just to stay up later than they would be &#39;allowed&#39; to if we had rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right. If they know they can go to sleep when they are tired, they <br/>
*will*. The body needs sleep and will grab it when it&#39;s time---UNLESS <br/>
it is forced to ignore its own signals.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
   Also, when I honour what they&#39;re telling me, allowing them to go to <br/>
sleep when<br/>
their little bodies are tired and not some preordained time so I can <br/>
get &#39;my<br/>
time&#39;, the &#39;my time&#39; just sort of magically happens.  It&#39;s like the <br/>
time<br/>
available to me expands or something, weird, but real.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Magic---yep! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little, and I really encourage you to peruse the <br/>
archives!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I second that. You can look for Jodi&#39;s first posts or even do a search <br/>
for bedtimes. There&#39;s a LOT there!<br/>

   <br/>
  Thanks Kelly :).  It&#39;s sort of like looking at your kids one day and thinking, my god, they&#39;re so big, when on earth did that happen?!?!?&quot; The growth has been very gradual, fairly painful at times, and certainly not just uphill &lt;g&gt;.  I went back and read some of my earlier posts too, and thought &#39;wow, you&#39;ve come a long way Jodi, when the heck did that happen?!?!?&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m SO grateful for this list!  I&#39;ve read lots and lots of books and lots of lots of website stuff, but it&#39;s this list that keeps me in touch with the day-to-day, moment-by-moment of what unschooling *really* looks like.<br/>
   <br/>
  Inspite of it seeming impossible from where we are financially and otherwise right now, my new dream is for our family to be at the conference in September.  There, I dared to say it out loud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631199304">I loved this post. I&#39;ve been thinking about it for the last few weeks <br/>
so I thought I&#39;d share the little *me* moments I realized I take and <br/>
the *us* moments that happen all the time (since I have a *me* moment <br/>
right now in which to do so).<br/>
<br/>
I work full time and my husband is a fabulous, baby-wearing SAHD. We <br/>
have 2 sons, 4 years and 18 mos. I think I was alone in my house once <br/>
in 2007 and DH and I went to a movie once after DS1 was born. Between <br/>
both boys I have been pumping and breastfeeding for 4 years. We play <br/>
all night until the boys are asleep around 10 or 11 and then DS2 is <br/>
an avid night nurser. So, we are tired and a little crazy, but we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. <br/>
<br/>
In bed at night, each time DS2 stops nursing and falls asleep, I roll <br/>
over on my right side and I have about 5 minutes of *me* time before <br/>
I pass out. Sometimes on Saturday morning DS2 gets up and goes out to <br/>
watch cartoons with DH and DS1. I have maybe 15-30 minutes when I am <br/>
alone in my bed, no one is touching my breasts and I am not <br/>
responsible for anyone or anything. It&#39;s lovely Sometimes I try to <br/>
disappear into the bathroom with a book or get a shower started. I <br/>
might get 5 minutes or so before the boys find me and pile in. <br/>
<br/>
So, I am thinking about all this during the last couple of weeks <br/>
after reading this post, and as much as I love those indulgent <br/>
moments, I realized that they aren&#39;t really what makes me a better <br/>
mom. It&#39;s the *us* moments when DS1 crawls in bed with us and we are <br/>
all snuggled up together, and when I am in the shower with the boys <br/>
and they are hogging all the water, when I wrap them in their towels <br/>
and we look at ourselves all happy in the mirror, the huge smiles <br/>
when they pick me up from work- they are so happy to see me, etc, <br/>
etc, etc. Those moments are absolutely refreshing and make me feel <br/>
like I could go on like this for 100 years!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me think about this!  <br/>
Leslie <br/>
