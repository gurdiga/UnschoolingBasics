<div id="ygrps-yiv-580839851">&lt;&lt;Interestingly he was not a kid who wanted to visit Santa at the mall (At <br/>
four he said &quot;I really don&#39;t want to go sit on a strange man&#39;s lap&quot; which <br/>
seemed <br/>
very sane to us), but I think he just liked the idea.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My kids were the same way!   They didn&#39;t want to go sit on some creepy <br/>
stranger&#39;s lap!   And I remember telling other moms that and they&#39;d tell stories <br/>
about the kids crying and how funny the pictures were.  It must be awful for some <br/>
kids having their parents force them to do that.<br/>
 <br/>
My relatives gave me a hard time, too, for breaking that photo tradition, now <br/>
that I think about it.  They&#39;d bug the kids, &quot;Don&#39;t you want your picture <br/>
taken with Santa?&quot; and &quot;He might not bring you something if you don&#39;t go talk to <br/>
him.&quot;  And my cousin would *use* it with her kid, that whole &quot;You&#39;d better do <br/>
this or that or Santa won&#39;t bring you anything.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Ick.  I&#39;m so glad we&#39;re past that.<br/>
 <br/>
My 12yo son and I just watched &quot;Bad Santa&quot; the other night, where Billy Bob <br/>
Thornton plays an alcoholic criminal who uses his Santa job to rob department <br/>
stores, and he recalled how he never wanted to go sit on Santa&#39;s lap.  He said <br/>
&quot;See?&quot;  LOL<br/>

Hey, same at my house.  We&#39;re always complaining and speculating about her, <br/>
what&#39;s the deal, is it a holiday?  Is she on vacation, or what?  Has she cut <br/>
back to part time? <br/>
 <br/>
And what *does* she do with all those teeth?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281899461">My dh and I have always given the boys silver dollars under their <br/>
pillows.  We did the *toothfairy* thing but with a wink, wink <br/>
attitude.  One day while playing in my room the boys were going through <br/>
my jewelery box where I had a couple of their teeth hidden.  They also <br/>
found a box in their dad&#39;s dresser filled with silver dollars.  My ds <br/>
said &quot;hmmm, mom has teeth in her drawer and dad has silver dollars.  <br/>
How strange!!&quot;  <br/>
