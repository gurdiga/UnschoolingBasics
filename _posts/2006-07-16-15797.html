<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001376760">Hi,<br/>
This is off-topic, but I thought of it while reading through emials from this list.<br/>
Can someone tell me how to set my email so that all messages from this group go into a separate folder from the rest of my emails? I use Outlook Express if that makes a difference. <br/>
Thanks, Tempe<br/>

should have a button or something that says &quot;tools&quot; and under that<br/>
should be an option for &quot;filters&quot; or &quot;folders&quot;  In there you can give<br/>
it keywords to have your mail sorted.  Such as when the &quot;from line&quot;<br/>
reads &quot;Unschooling_basics&quot; or if the letter tag says<br/>
[Unschooling_Basics]  I *think* that is how it is done.  I&#39;ve been so<br/>
spoiled with gmail as my mail gets all strung together in<br/>
conversations and I can search my mail using keywords just like I do<br/>
the web.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756733563">Hi Tempe,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you do:<br/>
<br/>
Go to Tools, Message Rules, Mail<br/>
Click on New, then another box opens up with the following steps:<br/>
1.  Select: Where the subject line contains specific words<br/>
2.  Select: Move it to the Specified Folder, and then click on Stop <br/>
Processing More Rules<br/>
3. Click on the underlined &quot;contains specific words&quot; and then enter into <br/>
the box [unschoolingbasics], then click Add, then OK<br/>
Create your UB folder (if you haven&#39;t already), then click on the <br/>
underlined &quot;specified&quot; and then scroll down to select your UB folder<br/>
4. Name your rule so that if you need to go back and edit/change it, you <br/>
can find it easily. <br/>
After you&#39;ve created your rule, if you have UB messages in your inbox, <br/>
you can then click on Apply Now and then OE will run the rule and move <br/>
all of your messages.<br/>
<br/>
I moved from Outlook Express to Thunderbird (part of Mozilla) and like <br/>
it much better.  I can have all the rules, and then I can also thread <br/>
the messages together by subject.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
