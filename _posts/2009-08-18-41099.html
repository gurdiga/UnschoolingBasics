<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045586235">My daughter would really, really, really like to get her hands on some<br/>
animation software.  She&#39;s been wanting this for a while, I&#39;m ashamed to<br/>
admit... but I kept thinking my husband, the computer geek, would help her<br/>
find what she needs.  He&#39;s not going to, apparently.  Sooooo... I am rather<br/>
out of my element in this area and don&#39;t even know what features to look<br/>
for.<br/>
I don&#39;t think she wants to build her own games, although she liked the idea<br/>
of the Xbox game/software I recently read about, where kids can make &#39;rules&#39;<br/>
and basically make their own game.  We don&#39;t have an Xbox so we&#39;re waiting<br/>
for that to be released for Windows.  What she mainly wants to do is make<br/>
movies.  She&#39;s pretty computer-savvy, but it&#39;d still be nice if the software<br/>
didn&#39;t require a degree.  :-)  Especially since I may be called upon to<br/>
help.  Eeeek!<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations?  Oh, she&#39;s almost-11, if that makes a difference.<br/>

I have this one. I really like it for comics pages.<br/>
<br/>
The older versions were fussy with color and text, but CS Debut 4 has  <br/>
color and text fully integrated so there&#39;s no choice to make.  <br/>
(There&#39;s also the professional version but that&#39;s like $300.)<br/>
<br/>
If you order it through Amazon, it&#39;s only $39 with free shipping.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m sure they mentioned this on your list, though for anyone here, a  <br/>
drawing tablet is *very* helpful. It&#39;s hard and frustrating to draw  <br/>
with a mouse. Wacom is the industry standard. The Bamboo Fun tablet  <br/>
is probably as much as any beginner needs. The drawing surface at  <br/>
3.5x5 sounds tiny but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using for several years and  <br/>
the size is just fine.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635515276">My son likes the Manga Studio software, it isn&#39;t really for creating games, but it is cool.  It depends on what type of computer you have an how much $$ you have as well.  Someone mentioned Alice already which is great to start with.  My DH says for creating 3D models and animations, the big names have been Maya (&quot;student&quot; version, if I recall correctly starts at $200ish, unless they&#39;ve dropped prices recently), caligari trueSpace, ... and one that is the most popular, whose name I can&#39;t, of course, remember right now.  Oh Yeah, 3D Studio Max.  They offer a free trial, but don&#39;t know what that includes.  The full price is $3495.  <br/>
<br/>
Blender is a free, open source, 3D package.  blender.org<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  <br/>

or other animation software that would be good for my 7 1/2YO, but if it would work for my almost 5YO, too, all the better.<br/>
<br/>
I love the &quot;-ish&quot; book and video. And this looks good, but I can&#39;t find any reviews of it.<br/>

A while ago I downloaded Pencil 2D for our kids, it&#39;s open source so it&#39;s free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960911548">Kerry, thanks so much for this!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind spending $60 on something I know the kids will really use, but if there&#39;s a free version they can play around with first ... awesome!<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the 15-day free trial of Animation-ish last night and played around with it. And just downloaded Pencil this morning. At first blush it looks like Pencil is exactly like the most advanced level of Animation-ish in function, just not as kid-friendly of an interface. I think Joseph might be able to work a little more independently on Animation-ish, but that&#39;s not usually his preferred method, anyway (-;<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing what the kids think.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you!<br/>
