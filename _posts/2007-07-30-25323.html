I&#39;ve been wanting to discuss this...Quickly: We are unschooling my 2 little<br/>
ones, Julian age 4, almost 5 and Julia, freshly 2. My first 3 were from a<br/>
different relationship and a different era in my life and were, for the most<br/>
part, conventionally schooled. Laura is 19, James is 17 and Grace is 15.<br/>
<br/>
OK. I have wanted to unschool James and Grace. James has been doing<br/>
alternative high school, from a STUPID program at the local continuation high, <br/>
to a<br/>
GREAT program online at Global Village High School for Peace and Freedom. LOVE<br/>
it there, but it was too funky for James, who feels safer within convention,<br/>
but is not conventional. Grace will be a sophomore and is not doing well in<br/>
school, falling behind in credits and what-not. I have offered her<br/>
alternatives, but she too is uninterested. I have tried to sort of deschool with<br/>
them,<br/>
and to some extent, I see them beginning to understand the process of what<br/>
learning is in actuality, not in a school-like-way, but they don&#39;t trust<br/>
themselves or me or that idea...not really. James is coming along, lol...I see <br/>
him<br/>
now looking things up online that interest him, he has returned to self<br/>
teaching guitar and is going to an off-shoot of the burning man festival this<br/>
weekend :) I am attempting comfort with that, lol and he and I have had some <br/>
nice<br/>
talks about trust and using the end of the teen years to experiment in many<br/>
parts of life and all that good stuff. He has decided that if he did not pass<br/>
the Ca High School Proficiency Exam, that he wants to go to the local Adult<br/>
School and get his GED because he isn&#39;t interested in college and doesn&#39;t know<br/>
what he wants to do. He feels this will help him get a job..I am not so<br/>
sure, myself, and have told him I&#39;ll back him as best I can on anything he<br/>
wants<br/>
or needs. Our issues are complicated by financial issues, because if he is<br/>
not in high school at 18, no more child support. If we weren&#39;t pay-check to<br/>
paycheck, there would be less of a rush, but sadly, we are. We are really very<br/>
financially strapped, and once child support stops, we can&#39;t afford him<br/>
anymore :( He knows this, understands it and we all hate it. I&#39;m hoping he<br/>
stays<br/>
&quot;in school&quot; (my CA &quot;private school&quot; I&#39;ve got set up is my ideal, so he can<br/>
unschool his last year for this kind of thing, in the safety net of being<br/>
financially cared for for the most part, you know?) He recently called me &quot;punk<br/>
rock&quot; which is a high compliment indeed (in regard to my alternative medicine<br/>
choices, homebirth, vax stuff, all that - because I take the time to educate<br/>
myself and he calls that punk rock - I loved it!) and has made other mention to<br/>
me that he really sees me as self educating and never really recognized that<br/>
before. That feels so good, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Grace is attempting conventional education again this fall - she was living<br/>
with her father last year, and is no back and enjoying the trust we are<br/>
acquiring between us and is thinking...she was willing to go to the convention<br/>
with me that is in Sacramento in August, but we didn&#39;t have the funds, but at<br/>
least she was willing! And she said she&#39;d go to the beach meet up this week<br/>
which is with teens that are at least homeschooled (both she and James have that<br/>
horrid idea that homeschoolers are losers...they&#39;ll learn, in time, I know)<br/>
if not unschooled, so that&#39;s something too. I wrote up a list of basic options<br/>
for the teens years and told her she can change from one to the next as she<br/>
sees necessary and we&#39;d reevaluate as time passes.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s that. Sigh. Here&#39;s the hard one.<br/>
<br/>
Laura. She graduated from high school, the old independent study program<br/>
they had here that I did - she got a 4.0, did well, did it a semester early<br/>
after failing horribly (they failed HER *I* feel, but that&#39;s a different post)<br/>
in<br/>
a private school with her Dad. She came home, we got her going with the<br/>
alternative program, she did so well, and that seemed to be it. She began<br/>
college, didn&#39;t take to it as she thought she would and flunked all of he <br/>
classes.<br/>
She then moved out and was living with friends, paying a nominal rent and<br/>
working. She then moved home, after telling me that she and her best friend, <br/>
her<br/>
roommate, were fighting al the time. I didn&#39;t want her to come back - I knew<br/>
it was a bad idea, but I let her move back in. It was supposed to be a hand<br/>
up, to help her get ready to move, but then she got fired and the short time<br/>
here turned into 13 months, that increased in misery as the weeks ticked by.<br/>
She lost that job, after having had it for years, tried a few other positions,<br/>
but either stopped showing up, or would quit. She went through jobs like me<br/>
and a good bake of chocolate chip cookies. She stopped helping financially<br/>
here due to the job loss, and we supported her 100%. She wouldn&#39;t do a bit of<br/>
any family chore or anything like that w/o serious coercion or constant<br/>
reminders. She was rude to Julian, the 4 year old and super sweet to Julia. She<br/>
left<br/>
a mess all over the place, including food to old in her room and in the<br/>
bathroom (which she shared with others). She then was caught stealing from my<br/>
mom<br/>
- used her credit card to run up nearly $600 in gas to se her boyfriend, got<br/>
caught at my mom&#39;s house 2 times for sure, possibly 3, stole the money out<br/>
of Julian&#39;s piggy ban (nearly $80) in slow increments, lied to us about so<br/>
many things, all the time, no one knew what was the truth. I supported her as<br/>
best as I could, couldn&#39;t believe that she was doing all of this...I know put<br/>
on blinders and tried to forget about each thing as it happened, like trying<br/>
to give her a clean slate each time an event occurred, but the tension in the<br/>
household was awful. Then Grace moved back, she stole money from<br/>
Grace...there&#39;s more, but I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m painting a clear picture here. anyway,<br/>
after<br/>
lots of discussions and warnings and what-not, she said she was moving out by<br/>
July 1. We stretched it to the 15th, since she still had no job, hadn&#39;t really<br/>
done anything, and tensions were building. We love her, but e can&#39;t trust<br/>
her. Finally, after all this time, I...I kicked her out. She knew it was<br/>
coming.<br/>
It was out in the open that she was going to have to leave (my former dh<br/>
never changed child support when Grace left, which was how I was able to<br/>
continue to support her living here) and she did nothing. We tried. We tried to<br/>
find<br/>
her jobs, we hid our money and credit cards, we talked about being rude to<br/>
Julian and to all of us (&quot;When are you going shopping? There&#39;s no food here,&quot;<br/>
that kind of thing and more) and we gave notice upon notice....well, 4 weeks<br/>
ago today, I had it and that was it. She&#39;s now not speaking to me, her<br/>
paternal grandmother is now taking care of her...and it&#39;s awful. I feel like I<br/>
went<br/>
against my heart, but I know I can&#39;t see ANYTHNG clearly about this<br/>
situation. I tried, I do try! I love this girl with all my heart...but I don&#39;t<br/>
love<br/>
her actions or what she has chosen. They have hurt others and that&#39;s the issue<br/>
I have. I don&#39;t know what to think, how to feel or what to do. So I am<br/>
writing here because I have never heard such excellent advice and discussions<br/>
in<br/>
my life as the ones I&#39;ve gotten here.<br/>
<br/>
My flow has been interrupted and I need to go...so sorry for the novel here,<br/>
and thank you if you got through this. It&#39;s been excruciating for me and for<br/>
her and for the rest of us living here. I admit, some tranquility has indeed<br/>
returned since she&#39;s been gone, but the pain of not seeing her and the s<br/>
ituation surrounding it is still just as bad. But at least I&#39;m not covered in<br/>
eczema anymore and I can sleep again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost in tears, so I&#39;m gonna go, take the little ones to my dad&#39;s to<br/>
swim and have a nice dinner he made for us, have a bit of wine and be done with<br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652579256">I only pop in here periodically, so didn&#39;t see the original post.  But<br/>
one thought came to me -- could your oldest be using drugs?  Her<br/>
behavior has some definite hallmarks of drug users (I have a brother<br/>
who used, so they are familiar) or of mental illness.  (And the line<br/>
can be blurry sometimes, btw.)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still not sure what to advise you to do, though -- but perhaps<br/>
identifying the problem would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is she might still be working through your divorce (or<br/>
not being together with their father -- I don&#39;t know the details, and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter; what matters is what is going on in her mind.)  No<br/>
first hand experience with that.<br/>
<br/>
You are right not to continue enabling her -- she will definitely be<br/>
resentful right now, and not see why you did what you did.  Hopefully,<br/>
down the road, she will look back at it differently.  The stealing,<br/>
btw, combined with being unable to hold a job (though that could have<br/>
multiple causes) is what made me think addiction.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could be more helpful, but send all my best for you in<br/>
dealing with this.<br/>
<br/>
(And for your other teens -- well, I have a very cool teen who is<br/>
partially homeschooled, partially charter schooled.  He loves not<br/>
being a traditional student!)<br/>
