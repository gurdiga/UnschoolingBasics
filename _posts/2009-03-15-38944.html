these things make me fume!<br/>
<br/>
We have got to do something folks...put all your positive and socializing UNSCHOOLING AND HOMESCHOOLING<br/>
 images and articles out there in the newspapaers for all to see.<br/>
Call your local papers and tv stations when you have a special get together or<br/>
function for example: fun fair, hike, bike event, play, co-op special program,<br/>
feild trip to the nursing homes etc.....homeschoolers DO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS<br/>
AND SOCIALIZE WITH OTHERS THROUGH THEM AND LEARN THROGUH THESE THINGS ALSO!! The<br/>
more positive images and articles out there in the local areas will help prevent<br/>
this. Show people what you do and what your children do that is special and let<br/>
everyone know that many of these opportunities would not happen if they went to<br/>
public school and faced the violence and bullying there and sat to do just book<br/>
work all day...no hands on ......<br/>
Yes folks , I can go on and on on this subject but enough for now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my friend Stephanie for letting me know about this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493104194">This story has been going around all the homeschooling lists. There are other news sources that are covering it as well. The crux of the matter is not homeschooling. It is two parents in the middle of a nasty divorce who cannot make custody arrangements themselves and asked the court for help in deciding this. It is a temporary order pending the finalization of the divorce. This is not an unschooling family and no the father did not originally agree to homeschool. The reason the mother is home schooling at is because she joined a church in 2005 that mandates that members of the congregation home school. The Church of the Sound Doctrine. They are also on cult watch lists. Not all details are available to the public however, the judge has order a pysch eval of the mom. This is not something judges do arbitrarily and without due cause (we still think that DH&#39;s ex needs one and there are some real serious issues there, but no judge would order one because<br/>
 they felt it was a he said she said type of deal with a bitter custody battle thrown in).<br/>
<br/>
The children maybe thriving well academically but there are other issues involved in this case. Unfortunately this is one of those divorce cases where the children have gotten caught in the middle. The judge has openly stated he has no issue with home schooling itself. That definitely would lead a person to infer that there is much more going on. <br/>
<br/>
If it were not for the mother&#39;s church&#39;s involvement in this case and WND publishing the first article at the request of the church it would be another nasty divorce case we would hear nothing about. It is not the type of case to set any legal precedence, it is one highly publicized case in the midst of who knows how many involving home schooling families. Over reacting to it gives naysayers more fuel for the fire that all home schoolers a nut cases and weridos. Ok, I qualify as both but that is beside the point. <br/>
<br/>
If you do a google search regarding this case you will see a wide variety of websites and standard news media also publishing information regarding the case as it becomes available. I would honestly look at media that is unbiased. I would also look up the Sound Doctrine Church which is the mother&#39;s church. I might add on that note, the only reason they approved the mother filing for divorce was because of alleged affairs the father had. So according to their doctrine he is a sinner and not welcome in the church. <br/>
<br/>
As a fellow  homeschool mom put it the widespread notification of this story is more like a test of the home school Emergency BroadCast System, guess what it works!<br/>
<br/>
HHhhmmm...Tammy are you on this list, I could swear I have seen you post here.  *GRIN* I will see if I can find her blog link again.<br/>
<br/>
But before we panic we do need to have the real facts from both sides. Again this case is not about home schooling, it is a divorce/custody case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is just a typical divorce/custody case.<br/>
<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t the children&#39;s father have equal say with the mother about <br/>
what the children&#39;s education looks like? HE doesn&#39;t want them to be <br/>
homeschooled? They are HIS children, too, right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826132455">Here is a recent link regarding this case by the local ABC news channel in Raleigh. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&id=6714504.">http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&id=6714504.</a> It really sheds some light on the case for those of us not sitting in court and includes the court ruling in pdf format.<br/>
