<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060152676">&quot;I am stenciling this on my kitchen wall above my sink.<br/>
Too awesome.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
HA! Maybe I will too...:)  <br/>
<br/>
I had this awesome morning. Jalen woke up before the other kids and<br/>
immediately put his puddle stompers on and headed outside. I watched<br/>
him from the kitchen window while he swung from a branch on this HUGE<br/>
Dogwood tree we inherited with our new house. It&#39;s in full blossom<br/>
right now, truly spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
He continued wandering and exploring the yard, laying in tall grass<br/>
and generally being at one with nature. I eventually went out to work<br/>
on some gardening projects. As I was digging the hole for the apple<br/>
tree, he joined me. After placing it in the hole he asked &quot;what will<br/>
it grow into?&quot;  We talked and patted dirt and enjoyed the sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
Later he impressed me by finding a plant tag (which had blown away)<br/>
and matched it up to the plant asking &quot;is this what this one grows<br/>
into?&quot; pointing to the tall, blossoming yucca on the tag picture.<br/>
He&#39;s REALLY into plants and what they become as they grow. We talk<br/>
about all the yummy blueberries, blackberries, apples, brocolli<br/>
etc...that we will be eating.:)<br/>
<br/>
After all the fertilizing and maintenance (you&#39;d laugh about my<br/>
&quot;maintenance&quot; because it looks completely wild back there) I lamented<br/>
a lack of water source and how long it would take me to hand water all<br/>
of it. It&#39;s all uphill and a bit of a hike from the house. ugh.<br/>
<br/>
The universe responded with a lovely and dramatic rain shower!! It was<br/>
the most perfect timing ever. Now we&#39;re off to the Kids Museum and a<br/>
friends house. I have 7 unschoolers in my home right now, one of which<br/>
is still sleeping, 3 are gaming, 2 are putting makeup on and one is<br/>
walking around in puddle stompers playing with ice.:)  Life is good<br/>
(and a bit messy).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow!  This really brings me back to our little-house-in-the-woods <br/>
days!  Liam was probably about Jalen&#39;s age then, and we had this <br/>
gorgeous dogwood tree that begged kids to climb it and hang out in <br/>
it.  Liam was (is) too decent a guy to refuse!  He used to spend days <br/>
on, under and in that beautiful tree.  I love remembering all roles <br/>
that tree played in Liam&#39;s games and fantasies; it was a ship and a <br/>
hideout, a house, a train, you name it!<br/>
<br/>
Leaving that tree (and its friends, the gorgeous magnolia, the giant <br/>
sugar maple, and the Japanese maple) may have been the hardest thing <br/>
about moving away from there!  In fact, under the dogwood became the <br/>
final resting place for our beloved old kitty, Puiegue (pronouced <br/>
&quot;pweeg&quot;), who passed shortly before the move, and we picked that <br/>
particular spot because we figured that no one in their right mind <br/>
would ever disturb that gorgeous tree (but, I suppose there can be no <br/>
accounting for people in their *wrong* mind!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for bringing that beautiful memory back to me, Ren!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Marji<br/>

I&#39;ve never had a bread machine, but I can make some great bread in  the oven. <br/>
 My favorite is my cinnamon bread, which i think is better  than anything you <br/>
can get in the store!  LOL but my opinion is a little  biased.  There is just <br/>
something about eating something that you put that  much time and I <br/>
dunno........heart into if that makes sense, that makes it taste  better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have not baked in my bread machine in maybe 10 years.  I use it to mix,<br/>
knead and rise the dough.  Then I take it out before the last kneading and<br/>
hand knead and let it rise again and put it in my stone loaf pan (of on a<br/>
flat stone depending on what kind of bread it is.)  The shape of bread<br/>
machines is all wrong and the crust always is too tough.  In all honesty I<br/>
think I have only actually baked in the bread machine a dozen times.  Before<br/>
I had kids I used to bake all my own bread.  I&quot;m not fond of store bread.  I<br/>
wish I had the energy to bake all our bread again.  I loved it!<br/>

I do the same as Michelle and use the machine to do the not-so-fun<br/>
part. Then I knead it for a while to get the LUV into it and bake it<br/>
