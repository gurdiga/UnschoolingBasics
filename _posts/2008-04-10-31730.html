<div id="ygrps-yiv-198471950">Pick it up and put it in the garbage.  <br/>
Chill out.  Everyone poops and you didn&#39;t get a guarantee when you were born that no one would ever poop where it was inconvenient for you. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When we first moved into our house, the dogs from across the street came over to help us.  They pooped on the lawn of the house next door to us.  The woman who lived there, big deal activities director at her church, big time religious lady, *lost her mind* ranted, acted like a freaking nut and hollered at their person to clean it up.  It was a lot of poop, they were big dogs, but the poor bugger had ALS and had a hard time just getting across the street.  <br/>
<br/>
Those pooping dogs were way more pleasant neighbors than church lady.  The guy who let his dogs get away from him for a few minutes to poop was a much nicer neighbor.  I knew if I ever had an accident, (don&#39;t usually poop accidentally, but like, if I dropped a sack of groceries or something) poopy dogs and poopy dog owner would be way more likely to come to my aid then the other neighbor.  <br/>
<br/>
Be nicer than my ranting neighbor.&lt;g&gt;  Remember that people and dogs are more important than dog poop. &lt;g&gt;   If you&#39;re going to get excited about something, get excited about being a nice person.    If you were considering doing something mean go out of your way to do something nice with all that energy and you&#39;ll feel better about yourself tomorrow.   That I can guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
The man with pooping dogs was Gary La Fontaine, for any fly fishermen out there. <br/>

*i did enjoy the typo, though, of the neighbor who was a boor.&lt;g&gt;*<br/>

What would you do? Your neighboor and her kid come into your property,<br/>
lets the dog poop right in front of the door to go into your back yard<br/>
and she leaves it there. It just happend to me. My mom says to put the<br/>
poop in a bag with a note telling her she forgot something in our yard<br/>
and carefully place it on her front steps for her to find. This is<br/>
really bothering me, What would you do?<br/>

sitting on a beach, early early morning. I&#39;d been surfing and was wet  <br/>
and chilly and had a towel draped around me, my knees up to my chest.  <br/>
The dogs came up from behind and first thing I knew I was being  <br/>
drenched with a very warm stream. I couldn&#39;t believe it happened a  <br/>
second time - same beach, different day, different dog.<br/>
