<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920134613">The unschooling article I mentioned in a previous message is in<br/>
today&#39;s Chicago Sun-Times at<br/>

It&#39;s an excellent, highly favorable overview. I think the reporter did<br/>
a great job, especially considering that unschooling was such a new<br/>
concept for her. <br/>
<br/>
My only disappointment is that the emphasis is on academics, not on<br/>
the development of personal qualities such as kindness and empathy -<br/>
EQ instead of IQ. I hope academics won&#39;t always be the yardstick we&#39;re<br/>
measured by. But all in all, I&#39;m really pleased with the article.<br/>
