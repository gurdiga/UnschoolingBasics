<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141323727">Here is a tour of the Lego factory:<br/>

<br/>
There was an article in Newsweek about this Lego artist (same guy as<br/>
in the CNN article). They said he was the only &quot;official&quot; Lego<br/>
Designer who didn&#39;t work for Lego...found out it wasn&#39;t so cool<br/>
repairing other peoples art. He has a website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.brickartist.com/">http://www.brickartist.com/</a> and his art is touring North<br/>
America...maybe to a town near you, which would be more economical<br/>
than LegoLand :)<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t like Legos, he is still an amazing example of<br/>
someone making money doing what they love!</div>
