<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313475480">This is something unschoolers already know, that play IS learning and<br/>
play is important to human development. Not only in childhood, but for<br/>
life.  I thought it was cool that this was at the tail-end of my<br/>
bi-weekly email for artists (or recovereing artists), the main theme<br/>
was about whether artists are working or playing (or both)when they<br/>
create:<br/>
<br/>
 ~Psychologists and other scientists have been <br/>
studying the role of play in the actions of humans and animals. <br/>
In protozoa and in people the &quot;Theory of Play&quot; suggests that <br/>
playful play is a vital preparation for wilful work. Bryn Mawr <br/>
College professor, Paul Grobstein, in &quot;Variability in Brain <br/>
Function and Behavior,&quot; says, &quot;Play is not only to be enjoyed <br/>
but to be accorded high value for its fundamental role in the <br/>
success of all organisms, including humans.&quot; In &quot;Playgrounds <br/>
and Classrooms,&quot; Brooke Lowder of Haverford College traces our <br/>
shortfall of creativity to the restriction of childhood play <br/>
and the dominance of school curricula. &quot;Enforced homework,&quot; he <br/>
says, &quot;is the destroyer of childhood imagination.&quot;~  Robert Gen<br/>
