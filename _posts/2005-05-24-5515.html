<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053359405">Hi Lynn:  Just wondered where you are in the midwest??  We are in North MO.  Welcome and good luck with unschooling.  It seems like those &quot;men&quot; are longer to come around the idea of unschooling than us &#39;moms&#39;.  Support seems to be the key for US.  Sounds like things are going great!!<br/>
