 </span></blockquote>When I first joined this list and started investigating unschooling I was<br/>
doing it for a &quot;just academics&quot; stand point.  I think I saw it this way b/c<br/>
all I knew about unschooling was that it meant that you trusted that your<br/>
children would learn everything they needed to learn through the normalcies<br/>
of daily life and pursuing their interests.  I didn&#39;t realize the whole<br/>
partnership aspect until I started reading posts here.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you just joining and having your views questioned, I joined<br/>
this group just a few months ago, and can&#39;t tell you how much it has already<br/>
impacted my life.  In the beginning I like so many others was responding to<br/>
someone else&#39;s post and put up an explanation of how I do things not looking<br/>
for any response to my post except by the person I was responding to, whom<br/>
in fact never responded.  Instead I received the same overwhelming response<br/>
to my statements on limitations of tv and food, specifically.  Though at the<br/>
time I felt like I was being slammed it has since given me much food for<br/>
thought, and I&#39;ve even begun shedding layers on these issues.  That&#39;s what<br/>
this group is all about.  I hope all you newbies will take as much from this<br/>
group as I have.<br/>
