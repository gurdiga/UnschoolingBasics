<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002950369">First of all, Ren: I so enjoy everything you post......your posts seem to clarify everything for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have two sons aged 8 and 6. They both LOVE the captain underpants books....and part of it is the toilet humor.......and I did try to explain about Miss Anthropy( so they could get it too) but from the look in their eyes , I did it wrong or it was just way over their heads (for now)......!!!!!!!<br/>
