But, my  dd at 7 isn&#39;t interested in reading. We have been using this <br/>
1st grade  curriculum, and she is able to do it, slowly. but she has <br/>
no desire. I  have stopped doing it wih her bc she resisted so much.  <br/>
I am trying  to make sure we read during the day as well.  But, will <br/>
she learn to  read this way?  <br/>

Stacey, I&#39;m not quite sure what you meant by &quot;isn&#39;t interested in  reading&quot;.  <br/>
Do you mean she doesn&#39;t want to read herself or that she isn&#39;t  interested in <br/>
books?<br/>
 <br/>
Everyone has done a good job on the first one.  So much brain and  muscle <br/>
coordination goes into reading.  Perhaps her brain isn&#39;t developed  in those <br/>
areas quite as much and it is tiring to read.  Would you get  worried if she <br/>
wasn&#39;t walking at 11 months or doing jumping jacks at 5?<br/>
 <br/>
As for not being interested in books, my oldest child has very little  <br/>
interest in books.  And in our culture, that seems to be some sort of  cardinal sin. <br/>
 But is it really?  I&#39;ve learned that it is intellectual  superiority.....and <br/>
believe me I grew up with a good dose of that.  Books  are just one part of <br/>
the glorious world we live in.  Many of us love books  and we got so much <br/>
praise for that.  I drive past our elementary school and  the sign out front says <br/>
&quot;READ!  READ!  READ!&quot;  Ugh, I don&#39;t even  want to read after that.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t like books.  He will read magazines and the  internet.  It <br/>
took me a long time to get over that, I kept trying to get  him to read.  I <br/>
realized there were two issues I had.  First, I wanted  him to read because I <br/>
believed that book-readers are better than everyone  else.  I have lots of <br/>
support in that belief system, and I had to dismantle  it.  Second, I wanted to <br/>
discuss books with him.  Well, that wasn&#39;t  going to happens so I had to learn <br/>
to discuss books with other people and find  other things that we both enjoyed <br/>
for discussion.<br/>
 <br/>
It took much work for me to accept my husband&#39;s dislike of books.  It  can <br/>
take much work to accept your children&#39;s like and dislike of books....or  <br/>
anything else.....especially when you have become a homeschooler and are  <br/>
responsible for their &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s OK.  But the joy and fun and ease of unschooling will be yours  once <br/>
you can let go of the baggage and celebrate what your children are  interested <br/>
in!  Let go and have fun!  They are so young and they truly  have a lifetime <br/>
to learn to read and do math and learn who George Washington  was.   <br/>
 <br/>
Ask your daughter about her interests and watch her face light up.   Yes, I <br/>
know it is hard to get really excited about what Barbie or the Care Bears  are <br/>
up to, but if you can begin to listen to her, you will see all the amazing  <br/>
things she is learning without anybody making her learn!!  It is way cooler  <br/>
than sitting at the kitchen table doing reading exercises.<br/>

The one in our neighborhood---the one Duncan would go to, is a &quot;RAEDING FIRST&quot; school. <br/>
 <br/>
How does *THAT* work??? <br/>
