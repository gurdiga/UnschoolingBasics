Sandra told her boys there are three steps:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713597315">I have the same policy for them, #1 talk it out, #2 ask mom for help.  <br/>
As for leaving them alone, that annoys me to no end because no parent <br/>
ever is right there supervising their children eyeball to eyeball 24/7. <br/>
The moment I look away somebody comes up to me saying he hit me!  I am <br/>
so irritated and frustrated with them about that.<br/>
<br/>
One time the oldest punched one of his twin brothers in the nose so hard <br/>
it bled. We were in the van driving back home from school and I normally <br/>
have my rearview mirror planted square on them, but this time I <br/>
concentrated on traffic until I saw the tussle in the back. I <br/>
immediately pulled over and told DS to get out of the van. He asked if I <br/>
was going to leave him, I said no. He had to stay and wait while I <br/>
cleaned up his brother. I told him that I can&#39;t allow him back in if <br/>
he&#39;s going to be a danger to his brother. I let him back in after he <br/>
apologized and after he answered affirmatively my question of whether <br/>
he&#39;s going to be safe with his brothers.<br/>
<br/>
I still feel angry over this. I&#39;ve tried explaining things over and over <br/>
and I did the same #1 #2 policy in my own accord. It&#39;s not working.<br/>
<br/>
I feel angry about oldest DS&#39;s tendency to take things away from his <br/>
twin brothers.  It&#39;s constant competition and jealousy and I do NOT want <br/>
this for them. I want peace in my house. :(<br/>
<br/>
Ok venting over - I think the big issue here is that I&#39;m Deaf and they <br/>
do not sign when they&#39;re quarreling. So how can I intervene when I can&#39;t <br/>
catch when things are escalating? (Why my children don&#39;t sign all the <br/>
time is a long story and something I wish did not happen.) Often oldest <br/>
DS says one of his (4 yr old) brothers has said something that he <br/>
disagreed with and I ask him if whacking him solved the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think the issue here is that he&#39;s outnumbered - the twins are close to <br/>
each other and he&#39;s alone. We also have a lot of things shared in <br/>
common. He&#39;s had &quot;his&quot; things before but as the twins grow into his <br/>
stuff things get a little mixed up. He grabs their things as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing a solution would be to establish separate toy bins for each <br/>
boy and have their names on them, and separate items for each of them? <br/>
This way they can have true ownership and feel free to share...  And <br/>
instead of doing the steps which aren&#39;t working, I would try the &quot;we are <br/>
kind to each other&quot; tack.  Any more suggestions?<br/>

eyes and wondering why they can&#39;t too. See the world through their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Assume they&#39;re doing the best they can. The advice you&#39;re giving them  <br/>
obviously is not working for them to solve the problem. If I&#39;d kept  <br/>
asking my sister to give something to me when we were kids and she  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t .. then what? If mom said only use words and didn&#39;t give me  <br/>
a tool to use after the words had failed it would be maddening. I&#39;d  <br/>
want to smack her! ;-) What other choice would I have when the only  <br/>
tool she&#39;d given me had failed?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd had 3 steps:<br/>
<br/>
1) talk it out<br/>
2) get an adult to help<br/>
3) then hit<br/>

She has a lot of good writing at:<br/>

<br/>
Also you need to be present more. Mindful parenting isn&#39;t a list of  <br/>
rules to hand to kids and send them off with. Be their partner in  <br/>
helping them get what they want. Rather than seeing situations as  <br/>
something to fix, figure out ways to *help* them get what they want.  <br/>
It&#39;s a subtle but important role shift.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My oldest also has a tendency to want whatever his brothers have. It<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;ve written dismisses his feelings. He has a need and he&#39;s  <br/>
trying to fulfill it and you&#39;re blowing off his need because they&#39;re  <br/>
younger and he&#39;s older. That&#39;s not only maddening but whittling away  <br/>
at your relationship with him. He sees you putting them ahead of him.<br/>
<br/>
Separate his need from his actions. Don&#39;t dismiss his need just  <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t have the tools to meet it. *Help* him meet it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean everyone will get what they want immediately. But  <br/>
help them build trust in you that you will work hard to help  <br/>
*everyone* get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
The reason kids keep fighting over something they want is because  <br/>
they&#39;ve learned from past behavior that&#39;s the only way to get it.  <br/>
Give them the confidence that their needs are important to you and  <br/>
you will help them.<br/>

but a way that will help eliminate a lot of it.<br/>

know what to do or how to solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re in a mindset that says &quot;If I don&#39;t grab what I want then I&#39;m  <br/>
not going to be able to get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You need to help them out of that.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in a mindset that you need to stop the hitting. What will help  <br/>
is looking past the hitting to what&#39;s causing the hitting. Obviously  <br/>
stop the hitting but then focus on the problem. You&#39;re turning the  <br/>
hitting into the problem and the original problem is probably getting  <br/>
lost in the confusion. Focus on the original problem. Help them  <br/>
figure out how to fix that. Help them know that you want to help  <br/>
everyone get what they need *and* feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the big issue here is that I&#39;m Deaf and they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can he sit up front with you? Don&#39;t impose it as a rule. Use it as a  <br/>
way to help him not hurt them. Tell him you need help in figuring out  <br/>
how to keep everyone safe.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd told her kids that if she hit someone that she&#39;d be  <br/>
arrested. It&#39;s not legally okay to hit. (That is *not* issued as a  <br/>
threat. It&#39;s just a fact.) Tell him you want to help him figure out  <br/>
ways to solve problems because hitting&#39;s not going to help him at all  <br/>
when he&#39;s an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing on changing them from kids who hit to kids who  <br/>
don&#39;t hit, help them find ways not to hit. When they hit it&#39;s a cry  <br/>
for help. They really don&#39;t know what else to do. Telling them not to  <br/>
is obviously not working.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on what led up to the hitting. If it&#39;s toys they&#39;re fighting  <br/>
over, help them figure out ahead of time ways to not fight over the  <br/>
toys. Involve them all in helping solve the problem and listen to  <br/>
their ideas. If the ideas don&#39;t pan out, help them revise them and  <br/>
think up new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The transition period is rough. They&#39;re used to fighting to get their  <br/>
needs met. They&#39;re going to hear your attempts at helping them  <br/>
problem solve as just new ways to say &quot;Stop hitting and fix this  <br/>
problem now.&quot; It will take a while until they gain confidence that  <br/>
you really are committed to helping them get what they want.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not true, though. Sometimes they aren&#39;t kind to each other.  <br/>
Sometimes I bet you aren&#39;t kind to them. (I know I&#39;m guilty!)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just imposing your principles on them. Use your principles to  <br/>
help them solve their problems.<br/>

Try &quot;I need everyone to feel safe in this house. How can we fix this  <br/>

<br/>
And, again, don&#39;t think of those as rules. You aren&#39;t going to *make*  <br/>
your kids be thoughtful. It isn&#39;t a standard that you&#39;ll make them  <br/>
live up to.<br/>
<br/>
Be thoughtful toward them. You can also help them think up ways you  <br/>
can both do something thoughtful for someone else who has done nice  <br/>
things for you. (And if they don&#39;t want to, you do it because it&#39;s  <br/>
important to you to be thoughtful. If you don&#39;t want to do it on your  <br/>
own, you shouldn&#39;t be making them do it! Do it because you feel it&#39;s  <br/>
the right thing to do, not because it&#39;s a lesson you want to impose  <br/>
on your kids. *Live* your principles.)<br/>
<br/>
Live these. Use these in your interactions with them and others. Help  <br/>
them use them as tools to figure out problems. That&#39;s what they are:  <br/>
tools to help us decide if something is in keeping with our philosophy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447040207">On this topic, we are about to bring home a 3 yr old child from an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; orphanage in China.  She has lived there for her whole life.  She may have<br/>
&gt; autism but we don&#39;t know.  We do know she does not speak and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand any English.  (I shouldn&#39;t have to say that but many people think<br/>
&gt; she knows English so I&#39;m offering it.)  I have two boys 11 and 9 yrs old and<br/>
&gt; they know and already have a baby gate to put up in their door so that Xian<br/>
&gt; Yi can&#39;t get in their room.  That&#39;s where all their stuff is.  We have<br/>
&gt; already talked about what her level of control is going to be and how easily<br/>
&gt; she will get frustrated.  If they leave their stuff in the rest of the house<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s going to be broken or taken by their little sister maybe.  So they know<br/>
&gt; if they want to keep it safe, it has to be kept where she can&#39;t get to it.<br/>
&gt; They have been told this over and over.  We&#39;ve discussed this too.  And they<br/>
&gt; were actually used to the idea from having a puppy around.  If they left<br/>
&gt; their stuff around the puppy would chew it.  So they are pretty good about<br/>
&gt; not leaving it about when there is &quot;danger&quot; around.  I think offering them<br/>
&gt; sancutary from this little girl who may behave like a monkey on crack is the<br/>
&gt; right way to go.  I am not going to make them share their stuff with her.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s theirs and afterall I don&#39;t want my stuff broken and I&#39;m not going to<br/>
&gt; give my stuff to her, they shouldn&#39;t be forced to do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back to OP problem, can you corral the little ones?  Give the big one some<br/>
safe and sacred space where he doesn&#39;t feel as though he has to fight them<br/>
off?  I&#39;m all for sharing, but both my kids, as my mother did with us, have<br/>
things they NEVER under any circumstances ever have to share with anyone.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s important to have those few things that they can know are<br/>
theirs.  Now, on good days, I often find them sharing those special things<br/>
willingly, but I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them share them.  And when we have company<br/>
over, (since most other kids and parents don&#39;t understand why we do this) I<br/>
have them put those special things away and they like that.  It&#39;s not that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go to bat and defend their right to withhold those items but they<br/>
would rather the kids coming in not even know they have said objects.  So I<br/>
offer a space in my room where kids (visitors) are not allowed to go until<br/>
the kids leave and my boys can retrieve their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can ask your oldest child which things are the items he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to have to share with his brothers and then get him a baby gate for the<br/>
door to his room.  Move all the other crap (and most kids have toys they<br/>
have outgrown interest in) to where the younger kids have access.  This may<br/>
be all you need to fix this issue.<br/>
<br/>
As to the fighting and being deaf, I train service dogs, I have trained a<br/>
hearing dog to alert a parent when their kids were beginning to fight. If<br/>
you have a dog you could do that.  Or you could get someone to do that for<br/>
you.  That&#39;s an easy fix.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966285211">I could do that. DS is getting some things like a guitar that will be <br/>
his alone. Other things like Legos, etc., I think would be unfair to <br/>
withhold from his brothers, esp because he has a 3 gallon+ box full of <br/>
them. I guess I would need to talk with him about it.<br/>
<br/>
My parents bought a VTech for the twins (they said it was too good a <br/>
deal to pass up...) and I know DS will want to get his hands on it too. <br/>
I am hoping my sister will loan us a Nintendo DS so he won&#39;t feel the <br/>
need to grab from them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll work on that space issue, have been thinking about segmentalizing <br/>
my office room so they all can have their own corners. What have you all <br/>
used for room &quot;dividers&quot;? We are in an apartment so can&#39;t really use <br/>
heavy duty stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I already created a lot of space by having us all sleep in one room <br/>
(bunk beds, mattress on the floor, etc.) And the other rooms are the <br/>
playroom and my office. That &quot;office&quot; room can be split up in <br/>
subdivisons somehow. I like the way it is now, with our space defined <br/>
more by purpose instead of ownership. Lots of free floor room when we <br/>
keep it neat. :) Downside is the kids&#39; fighting, so I better work on <br/>
creating some containers and corners for them.<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t just the noise with the fighting - it&#39;s catching what <br/>
they&#39;re saying before the fights happen. It drives me crazy that they <br/>
have had a lack of respectful language models. People who can sign talk <br/>
verbally with each other in front of me and my children follow their <br/>
example.  I have asked them respectfully to sign without voicing so my <br/>
job would be easier, but they continue to ignore me. &quot;I forgot,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s a <br/>
habit,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Communicating with my own children is very impt to me, and I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying to work with them. I keep feeling like my efforts are undermined <br/>
- by the school system, by well-meaning relatives.<br/>
<br/>
On my part I need to try harder in making the boys feel welcome in <br/>
sharing with me, so that they will want to be sure I&#39;m included, and <br/>
that they will maybe have more appreciation of ASL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the pointers you all have shared--appreciate those <br/>
very much!  Anyone have experience with having a second language at <br/>
home?<br/>

<br/>
I have the same policy for them, #1 talk it out, #2 ask mom for help.<br/>
As for leaving them alone, that annoys me to no end because no parent<br/>
ever is right there supervising their children eyeball to eyeball 24/7.<br/>
The moment I look away somebody comes up to me saying he hit me!  I am<br/>
so irritated and frustrated with them about that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Irritated and frustrated that someone came to you for help?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a small house, right? How far can you actually BE from them?<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
One time the oldest punched one of his twin brothers in the nose so <br/>
hard<br/>
it bled. We were in the van driving back home from school and I <br/>
normally<br/>
have my rearview mirror planted square on them, but this time I<br/>
concentrated on traffic until I saw the tussle in the back. I<br/>
immediately pulled over and told DS to get out of the van. He asked if <br/>
I<br/>
was going to leave him, I said no.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would he ask that? Is that a real fear? Has he been told that <br/>
before? By anyone?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He had to stay and wait while I<br/>
cleaned up his brother. I told him that I can&#39;t allow him back in if<br/>
he&#39;s going to be a danger to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So it *is* a fear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I let him back in after he<br/>
apologized and after he answered affirmatively my question of whether<br/>
he&#39;s going to be safe with his brothers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Whether he&#39;s lying or not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I still feel angry over this. I&#39;ve tried explaining things over and <br/>
over<br/>
and I did the same #1 #2 policy in my own accord. It&#39;s not working.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Change the anger to curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
WHY is it nor working?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I feel angry about oldest DS&#39;s tendency to take things away from his<br/>
twin brothers.  It&#39;s constant competition and jealousy and I do NOT <br/>
want<br/>
this for them. I want peace in my house. :(<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds silly, but it&#39;s that zen thang:<br/>
<br/>
BE the peace!<br/>
<br/>
Why do they feel compettitive and jealous? What is causing that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ok venting over - I think the big issue here is that I&#39;m Deaf and they<br/>
do not sign when they&#39;re quarreling. So how can I intervene when I <br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
catch when things are escalating? (Why my children don&#39;t sign all the<br/>
time is a long story and something I wish did not happen.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---I keep forgetting you&#39;re deaf! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They need to trust you&#39;re there to help them figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Often oldest DS says one of his (4 yr old) brothers has said something <br/>
that he<br/>
disagreed with and I ask him if whacking him solved the problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but how is that helping them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132889235"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Irritated and frustrated that someone came to you for help?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be fine with them coming up to me for help but I feel like on this <br/>
issue we have talked it into a morass, where no one seems to be <br/>
listening to each other and people are still getting hit.<br/>
<br/>
I feel those emotions because we&#39;ve gone through this over and over <br/>
again. &quot;Please don&#39;t hit your brother, it hurts.  When your brother is <br/>
done with the toy, you can have it.  What time will you be done with <br/>
this toy?  Let him have the toy, it is his turn.  So what if your <br/>
brother said no over something that doesn&#39;t make sense? Does he have <br/>
control over that and does hitting him solve the problem?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s a small house, right? How far can you actually BE from them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to physically separate them into time-outs but since I hurt my <br/>
back and snapped my ACL I&#39;ve been unable to get into the thick of things <br/>
without getting hurt myself.  I have to yell to stop things from a <br/>
distance and even then it doesn&#39;t work. So I feel powerless too. :( I&#39;m <br/>
laid up now, just finished with ACL reconstruction surgery.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So it *is* a fear.<br/>
&gt; Whether he&#39;s lying or not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How could I have approached this situation better, then? There was blood <br/>
all over his brother&#39;s face and we were heading towards a construction <br/>
zone.  They were fighting because the twin had said no and pouted over <br/>
something, both had been hitting on each other. There are real-world <br/>
consequences to beating up people - including lock-up.  My thinking was, <br/>
remove the aggressor from the situation NOW.  Then clean up and talk <br/>
about it.  I am out of ideas if this only creates a revenge complex in <br/>
them :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Change the anger to curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is difficult because I feel stumped on this. I&#39;ve read the Siblings <br/>
Without Rivalry book, joined this list, consensual living, read all I <br/>
could and I&#39;m still not getting it right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why do they feel compettitive and jealous? What is causing that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The bad old days I think. :(  There were major power and control issues <br/>
going on in our home until DH and I separated abt 2 years ago. Since <br/>
then he&#39;s gone to counseling but DS has grown up in that environment and <br/>
I really want to change that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yeah---but how is that helping them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought it&#39;s help him see the futility of that option. It&#39;s difficult <br/>
if I&#39;m out of ideas myself too. Maybe it&#39;ll be different after each of <br/>
them has their own space?<br/>
<br/>
You know it just occurred that maybe because DS has more options <br/>
compared to the twins (one said recently, &quot;I want to be homeschooled!&quot;) <br/>
and because DS tries to control them, they feel powerless. So they hold <br/>
onto &quot;insignificant&quot; things like toys or verbal comments because that&#39;s <br/>
where they feel like they have control.  The twins are still in <br/>
preschool and my mother was just telling me about how the teacher needs <br/>
to keep order, etc.  DS also probably feels powerless himself from when <br/>
he was in school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not perfect myself either, and the kids copy my mistakes.  My <br/>
thinking is away from the &quot;control kids&quot; model but when things get <br/>
stressful I find my ideas and options narrowing down.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take one difficult situation for example -<br/>
<br/>
DS likes to sing in the van. I am unaware of this unless I see his mouth <br/>
moving and head bobbling.  Singing does not bother me.  Everything would <br/>
be fine and dandy if DS didn&#39;t insist he sings alone or has total <br/>
silence instead.  The end result is usually a lot of drama.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have a means for monitoring volume in the van.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to defuse this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428650626">&quot;Do no deliberate harm&quot; is a basic principle - that applies to self,<br/>
others, animals, etc. Most other stuff comes out of that - respecting<br/>
other people&#39;s person, space, property; being kind; staying safe;<br/>
forgiving others when accidents happen; etc. And, it applies equally<br/>
regardless of age - we learned early on that DS just won&#39;t tolerate<br/>
arbitrary double standards - adults can do this but kids can&#39;t just<br/>
because the adults say so - but he quite understands (and has for a long<br/>
time, it&#39;s not just because he&#39;s now 9, this goes back to almost<br/>
toddlerhood) that there are some things that are not safe for him to do<br/>
or, at least, not safe for him to do alone, unassisted. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s interesting now, to hear his feedback when we&#39;ve spent time with<br/>
extended family - one SIL and her 4 yr old in particular. DS sees how<br/>
the arbitrary rules and micromanagement end up in rebellion and stress<br/>
and no one being happy (had a lovely - not- example of that this past<br/>
weekend with everyone gathered holiday-wise). He sometimes just does not<br/>
understand why people don&#39;t get the connection between arbitrary rules<br/>
and over managing kids and the behaviors that they get.<br/>

Yeah---I&#39;m sure how many other families discuss &quot;Parenting Skills&quot; the <br/>
way we do around here.  It&#39;s *often* a topic of conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I think that a child who would question other parents&#39; parenting <br/>
practices with his own parents must be comfortable enough with his own <br/>
parents. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have the Lovejoy Christmas next weekend (I&#39;ll be staying home, but <br/>
Ben&#39;ll take the boys there Whew! &lt;g&gt;).  As soon as they get home, I&#39;ll <br/>
get the run-down about the &quot;questionable parenting abilities&quot; that they <br/>
witness while there.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be anything new. Walking about in Wal-de-mart, the <br/>
Store-Which-Should-Not-Be-Named, will get the same questions.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing is that I hope the boys will have so much less baggage <br/>
to unload before parenting their own babies. What a wonderful gift!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202602009">Hi Adrean, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read this entire thread, and I have some comments <br/>
(interspersed). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem isn&#39;t just the noise with the fighting - it&#39;s catching <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they&#39;re saying before the fights happen. It drives me crazy that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>forgot,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; habit,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recognize the issue here.  You as a parent want to know what is <br/>
going on between your children.  This is certainly valid.  I am just <br/>
not sure you can illegalize voicing in your home.  I mean this in <br/>
two ways.  Firstly, I don&#39;t think this is possible.  In the history <br/>
of deaf education there were many attempts to prevent deaf children <br/>
from using sign language and in spite of all this, the children <br/>
somehow still acquired sign language (against all odds), and used it <br/>
every chance they got with each other, because it was their most <br/>
comfortable language in certain circumstances. In the same way, if <br/>
you try to ban English in your home, it will not work.  English is <br/>
too powerful a communication tool for people who use it to just drop <br/>
it to please someone else.  From another angle, I don&#39;t think it <br/>
would be fair to ask your children not to speak to each other at all <br/>
in your presence.  I don&#39;t think this is an ethical thing to do.  <br/>
They are using the English, in spite of your requests, because it is <br/>
the most comfortable language for them in certain circumstances.  <br/>
Think about how much of their lives happen in English.  You cannot <br/>
change this.  Are you prepared to illegalize television, books, and <br/>
access to all hearing people?  So much of what they know they <br/>
learned from sources other than you. These things came to them in <br/>
English, so it is hard for them to translate ALL of their <br/>
experiences into another language 24/7 for the benefit of someone <br/>
else. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to seem callous.  I understand your problem.  I sign <br/>
fluently and my husband and daugher are deaf.  My husband is from a <br/>
Deaf signing family.  I also have two hearing children.  We are all <br/>
bilingual.  Sometimes we hearing members sign to each other for fun <br/>
when my husband is not even there... sometimes, we speak to each <br/>
other in his presence.  We are a bilingual family.  We code switch.  <br/>
This happens naturally depending on the situation.  My husband does <br/>
not try to regulate language, and for this reason, because they are <br/>
not forced to translate, I see my children sometimes translating <br/>
voluntarily for my husband because they love him so much, and <br/>
understand his perspective, and want to include him. Other times, <br/>
they sign becuase they need his help with something.  Sometimes I <br/>
tell my husband what they are saying to each other in English... <br/>
Sometimes I am too busy, and he has to try to figure it out for <br/>
himself, or ask, or let it go.  <br/>
<br/>
I belive humans instinctually use their communication skills to <br/>
accomplish their own goals.  I don&#39;t think it would be right to use <br/>
one&#39;s power to limit someone else&#39;s language use for one&#39;s own <br/>
purposes.  In your case, granted, your purpose is to be an on the <br/>
job mom, and this is obviously an important goal.  However, I think <br/>
that you could accidentally push your children away from you and <br/>
sign language if you push your children towards it so agressively.  <br/>
If you go by the idea of principles, then perhaps a nice principle <br/>
would be something like &quot;we try to understand each other better&quot; , <br/>
or something like that, and work from there.  When I say work from <br/>
there, i don&#39;t mean that you require them to sign. I mean that you <br/>
try to show them that you are trying to understand them as best you <br/>
can using the tools available to you.  You have to model this, and <br/>
be patient with your children as they learn this new way.  <br/>
<br/>
Your problem is not unique to deafness.  This is a very common issue <br/>
in the bilingual houses of immigrants whose children master English <br/>
faster than their parents.  Very often, then children speak to each <br/>
other in English, and speak some combination of their two languages <br/>
with their parents.  Bilingual research and theory has shown that <br/>
there are periods of language mixing in children growing up <br/>
bilingual, and that gradually, they learn which language matches <br/>
which circumstance.  Children need time with this.  You <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;require&quot; language skills; they are developed over time, with <br/>
motivation.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see them needing to sign to each other.  They have the right <br/>
to communicate amongst themselves.  If they have a problem and need <br/>
you, or if you join the conversation, it may be that there is reason <br/>
for them to sign too, or instead (if they are able to do this).  As <br/>
long as they are signing, what is the problem if they voice too?.. <br/>
if this makes the language more meaningful to them in some way.  I <br/>
realize that doing both at the same time creates linguistic <br/>
problems... but isn&#39;t the idea to communicate, and not to be <br/>
perfect?  In some circumstances, such as Deaf schools, or Deaf <br/>
service agencies, the personnel are required to sign at all times.  <br/>
I believe this is appropriate, because language use and modeling are <br/>
made part of the job description.  Those who don&#39;t or can&#39;t comply <br/>
are sometimes fired.  But.. in a family, you can&#39;t fire your <br/>
children.  You have to try to understand them, and as they are able, <br/>
they will begin to have the ability to understand your perspective <br/>
too.  I believe that you have to let go of this form of control.  <br/>
Their language skills are their own, and if they speak English and <br/>
you do not, then this is an inconvenience that you as the adult have <br/>
to work around in some way.  They cannot be held responsible for <br/>
this.  You want them to be all they can be.  Their experience, and <br/>
needs are not the same as yours.    <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Communicating with my own children is very impt to me, and I&#39;ve <br/>
 </span></blockquote>been <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trying to work with them. I keep feeling like my efforts are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>undermined <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - by the school system, by well-meaning relatives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that they will maybe have more appreciation of ASL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I think you have hit the nail on the head here. If they <br/>
feel like they benefit from having you included in the <br/>
conversations, then they will include you. Because you do not use <br/>
English in the way they do, you are not in a position to force your <br/>
own participation.  In a way, this may be an advantage from an <br/>
unschooling perspective. You will have to convince them of the value <br/>
of having you involved. Really, we all have to do this, even when <br/>
there is only one language used in the family.  Otherwise, we may <br/>
talk to our children, but they wouldn&#39;t be listening, and they may <br/>
talk to us, but it may not be the truth.  Communication is built on <br/>
respect, and this respect has to be modeled by the parents.  I think <br/>
that you should put the issue of which language to use on hold, and <br/>
work on the content of the message.  If the content works for them, <br/>
then they will make sure that the message gets accross because they <br/>
will need you.  What would happen if you apologized for trying to <br/>
control their language use, and told them that you wish to find a <br/>
way to help them in any way you can with whatever they need, and <br/>
that you are a little concerned about missing things, but that you <br/>
want them to know that you are available when they need you. Then <br/>
try to live with this for a while... I wonder if just this wouldn&#39;t <br/>
change things for the better.  You are their mom.  They definitely <br/>
need you.  They&#39;ll come.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been reading the pointers you all have shared--appreciate <br/>
 </span></blockquote>those <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; very much!  Anyone have experience with having a second language <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; home?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; --Adrean<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a couple more things to say, and sorry to be so long.  There <br/>
are ways you can compensate for not hearing what&#39;s going on with the <br/>
children.  In our house, we use vibrating sound detectors.  When my <br/>
husband is solely responsible for the children, he wears a vibrating <br/>
pager which is activated when the noise level goes up.  If you do <br/>
move, consider a place with an open floor plan( ie.. more space and <br/>
less walls).   Make sure that the children can &quot;get&quot; you when they <br/>
need you.  Let them benefit from the technology too.  There are also <br/>
vibrating pagers activated by handheld buttons.  We have this too <br/>
and it worked very well when I was nursing the baby and needed to <br/>
call my husband from the other room for something. We set another <br/>
one up in the living room, so that they could call him by flashing a <br/>
light in the kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
Sign language is a beautiful and complete language, but many deaf <br/>
people experience a language barrier when it comes to English and <br/>
the world of sound.  If you were deaf as a child, then it was the <br/>
responsibility of the adults in your life to ease this barrier for <br/>
you in some way, and take on the bulk of the responsibility for <br/>
communication, while you were still learning.  Now you are the <br/>
adult, and it is your responsibility to take on the communication <br/>
issues faced by your family and come up with creative solutions.  <br/>
You cannot place this burden on the shoulders of your children.  If <br/>
you try to make it as easy as possible for your children to <br/>
communicate with you, then they probably will pick of the rest of <br/>
the slack as best they can.  Maybe you can enlist the help of family <br/>
members (relatives or friends) in some way.  Your children do not <br/>
speak English in the home due to the bad influence of your <br/>
relatives. They speak because they can hear... it comes very <br/>
naturally for them... just as signing comes naturally to many Deaf <br/>
people.  Good luck, and I wish the absolute best to you and your <br/>
children in your unschooling journey.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Adrean<br/>
I have an idea that may be helpful.  I only have one child so I am <br/>
dealing with different struggles but my daughter volunteers at a <br/>
democratic free school for younger children and they have a good <br/>
policy for dealing with arguments.  Anyone can call a meeting any time <br/>
they feel something is unfair and they talk about it together until <br/>
they all agree to a solution.  They have worked out very specific <br/>
guidleines for play fighting so they can tussle and no one gets hurt <br/>
(very much anyway).  They also have worked out how to share by <br/>
agreeing to a time limit on the prime toys.  I think the basic idea is <br/>
everyone being in agreement with limitations becuase they value the <br/>
benifits.  If each boy knows he is really &quot;heard&quot; then over time he <br/>
will become more willing to see the others point of view and make <br/>
comprimises willingly.  It takes a lot of practice though. <br/>
<br/>
 I am definitely still working on it with my daughter.  For every time <br/>
I  deal with a situation thoughtfully and calmly there are probably <br/>
two times that I said No or yelled without thinking it through <br/>
first.   Keep up the good fight : )<br/>
