If you know an Avon consultant, there is currently a bath set in the Outlet catalog that includes Tub crayons, finger paints and a bag to hold it all. It&#39;s $9.95<br/>
If you don&#39;t know one, you can order it online at www.avon.com <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Look in the toy sections of places like Target and WalMart.  We buy <br/>
the crayons, Crayola tub tints, and foam soap.  I try to get the <br/>
foam soap as cheaply as possible because the kids *love* playing <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 8 and prefers I hang out in the bathroom with her to <br/>
keep her company.  My ds9 is moving away from that, preferring <br/>
privacy.  Neitehr like having their hair dried with a hair dryer, <br/>
although my dd8 will ask for it if we&#39;re leaving soon to go <br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the idea about squirt guns and targets!  I&#39;m going to the <br/>
store today to buy that.  My ds9 will *love* that.  I can see him <br/>
lining his army men up on the side of the tub.  Woo!<br/>
<br/>
If my kids are going to wash their hair, they don&#39;t like having as <br/>
much water in the tub as they would if they weren&#39;t washing their <br/>
hair.  That&#39;s not something I would have ever thought of, but they <br/>
both dislike washing their hair in a really deep tub of water.  Our <br/>
solution is to let them play in deep water and then drain water out <br/>
to a satisfactory level when they are ready to wash their hair and <br/>
get out.  :)<br/>

different flavors/colors - and they&#39;d play with that as if it was  <br/>
finger paint, in the tub. They also occasionally used tempera paint  <br/>
in the tub - it washes away easily if you don&#39;t use the purple or  <br/>
red. I also used to make a big huge bowl full of really thick instant  <br/>
mashed potatoes, put a little tempera paint in it to color it  <br/>
different colors, and they&#39;d sculpt with that in the tub.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324681840">I keep buying bath toys and these kids keep bringing pokemon and dinosaurs<br/>
and cars into the tub. I think bath toys are so cool. I bought a bubble<br/>
beater-like a hand cranked egg beater to make bubbles bigger. We have a<br/>
see-through water pump. I want the water pipes/pan flute and although I keep<br/>
backing down and telling myself these kids are just too old, well.I bet they<br/>
are not. I live near a store called Learning Express that sells the &quot;Alex&quot;<br/>
products that include the really vivid bath crayons. It&#39;s in the Avenue at<br/>
West Cobb on Dallas Hwy/120. We also have a cool product called<br/>
&quot;Washy-Squashy&quot; that is olive-oil/essential oil-scented/naturally pigmented<br/>
modeling soap-like modeling clay but for the bath. It has kind of been<br/>
ignored though because it will sting the eyes. But it smells soooo good. A<br/>
sil gave me a bath spa that turns my tub into a whirlpool and my kids adore<br/>
that! They can make bubbles topple OUT of the tub with the jets!<br/>
<br/>
My kids bathe as needed and enjoy it when they do, but I was a reluctant<br/>
bather (still am!) as a child and I think I retained some of the desire to<br/>
make it a fun place.thank goodness.<br/>
