<br/>
Yes, I think there&#39;s something in this, though from my experience I&#39;m not  <br/>
sure if it&#39;s down to the birth time or to life in the womb.  My  daughter&#39;s <br/>
a night-owl and I firmly believe that it&#39;s partly to do with the  habits I <br/>
had while pregnant.  My partner and I were working nights as  musicians - I <br/>
kept working till 2 weeks before Jess was born.  We&#39;d  get home, still full <br/>
of adrenaline from the evening&#39;s work, watch some  TV until around 3am and <br/>
probably eat at around 1.30am.  Jess (born just  after 10pm) tends to like a <br/>
midnight snack - and then a good hour or so to  settle down.  Seems to <br/>
correspond quite well with what she was probably  experiencing via the placenta!<br/>

Just had to put in a caveat to that - sometimes c-sections are not for<br/>
anyone&#39;s convenience but for the health and safety of mom and baby. Yes,<br/>
unfortunately (IMO) more people are opting to pick a birthing date that<br/>
fits their vacation schedule or whatever, but there are some of us who<br/>
had c-sections AFTER labor began (so the little one was ready to<br/>
arrive).<br/>
<br/>
FWIW I was born around 9:45 pm and generally by that time I&#39;m ready to<br/>
go to sleep, I&#39;m much more awake at around 8 am. <br/>

&gt; kids who  have a date and time &quot;chosen&quot; for them for the convenience of their <br/>
&gt; families  or those who are C-section...<br/>
<br/>
******I have had 2 c-sections and one natural birth.  My first c-section was during labor.  He was born a little after 7pm and has traditionally been a kid who crashes before 9pm and wakes before 7am.<br/>
<br/>
My second c-section was scheduled, mostly because I was uninformed about the possiblities of VBAC and believed that it was best at the time.  (sigh... if I knew then what I knew now.)  Anyway, he was born a little after 1 in the afternoon and has trouble settling into a comfortbale sleep.  He also sleeps very late in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
My third was a VBAC after 2 cesereans.  He came when he wanted.  Just after midnight.  He goes to sleep quite easily around 8:30 or 9, and rises at 6:30 or so.  He doesn&#39;t usually sleep through, but such is the life of a breastfed baby.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway...  my point is that you may be on to something.  The two babies that came when they were ready don&#39;t sleep to have any sleep issues.  the one who was taken when he probably wasn&#39;t ready, has trouble settling down, and tosses and turns for a hour or so before finally settling into a sleep.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder if it&#39;s genetics. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t have a choice about a C Section, my son got &#39;stuck&#39; when I was having him. He was born at 11:48 and is a night owl. also born at a time where he&#39;s really one star sign, the the one &#39;assigned&#39; to his birth day.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s always been a  kid who wants to to stay up all night. So is my husband. Then sleeping most of the day. Most of the time he wakes up right when I get home from work. <br/>
<br/>
My sister and her daughter are also that way, staying up really late. <br/>
<br/>
I was Born at 2:00 am. I am an early bird. I for years fought my natural rythem. I thought I should stay up late and sleep in. I usually felt horrible when I do! <br/>
<br/>
I usually wake for work at 4:30, because I want to. When it&#39;s summer, and School&#39;s out. (since I teach) I like to &#39;sleep in&#39; to 6! I also go to be around nine pm. Perhaps I&#39;m the exeption to the rule!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789792004">I hope you know I didn&#39;t mean it that way regarding C-sections.  I have had friends who can&#39;t have their children without C-sections.  But I have heard many women lately who have to have the baby on their schedule and want the C-section....is C-section less painful?  I never had one so I don&#39;t know much about it.  Also I was stating that I wondered if by having the C-section, no matter the reason for one, if that threw off the sleeping pattern of the child or what we would see as the birth &quot;time&quot; of the child as opposed to what it would have been without the C-section.<br/>
<br/>
I also think the older we get, the longer we have trained ourselves to a different time frame than what we started out with, the &quot;easier&quot; it is to change our sleeping behavior.  Just guesses of course. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883655119">Less painful? Mm differently painful might be a better way to put it. It<br/>
is abdominal surgery so sitting up, walking, laughing, etc are tough for<br/>
a few weeks. On the other hand, there&#39;s little risk of the tearing and<br/>
future potential issues (like peeing problems) that come with vaginal<br/>
deliveries. I think that for SOME people, it&#39;s not so much planning for<br/>
timing reasons but rather knowing that mom and grandma and sibling all<br/>
ended up with Depends after vaginal deliveries and not wanting to go<br/>
that route. Just a guess though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And yeah *I* know you weren&#39;t &quot;putting down&quot; c/s but there may be<br/>
lurkers who wouldn&#39;t be used to &quot;us&quot; who might not so I threw in that<br/>
caveat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917775347">Oh, and as for DS, my c/s baby (who is now pushing 11), labor started<br/>
around midnight and he was delivered around 3:45 in the afternoon. He<br/>
usually has no sleep problems, he&#39;ll fall asleep whenever he needs to<br/>
fall asleep (when he&#39;s tired) but he&#39;s always been on something like a<br/>
36 hour day - he eats his biggest quantities of food at different times,<br/>
his sleep schedule is all over the place - he tends to rotate around the<br/>
clock so sometimes he&#39;s up all day and sometimes he&#39;s up all night, with<br/>
all sorts of &#39;shifts&#39; in between. He hasn&#39;t had a &#39;bed time&#39; since he<br/>
was 5 and for a couple years prior, his bedtime was not only flexible<br/>
(it had leeway for if he was in the middle of something) but it was more<br/>
&quot;please be doing something quiet in your room after this time&quot; (which<br/>
was when I&#39;d read him stories and all like that, after which he was<br/>
usually asleep but if he was awake he was free to look at books, color,<br/>
etc) unless he wanted to snuggle in with us, in which case it was quiet<br/>
time so that I could sleep (I WOH fulltime so I need to get sleep - he<br/>
could snuggle then go to his room if he chose, lots of options)<br/>
