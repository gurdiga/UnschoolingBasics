<div id="ygrps-yiv-834165744">OK, I have a specific, NON-hypothetical question for you all.  It is <br/>
regarding my very energetic, spirited, persistent and bright little 5 <br/>
yo boy, Lucas.  He is very curious and when we go someplace (like a <br/>
store or someone else&#39;s house) he finds it very hard to keep his <br/>
hands off other people&#39;s things.  Specific example...yesterday we <br/>
walked across the street to my neighbors house(because he wanted to <br/>
go say hi to them).  He immediately picks up a plastic baseball bat <br/>
in the yard and starts pounding on the ground...not a problem for me <br/>
(or my neighbor really) but he is getting close to her flowers, and <br/>
all her little yard chachkis (sp?  you know, those things that people <br/>
put in their yard to decorate them?) and I&#39;m getting a little <br/>
concerned that he will bust something up.  Then he starts to walk <br/>
into the house without being asked (I don&#39;t know these people really <br/>
well...), we follow him in because my neighbor wants to show me some <br/>
work they are doing on the house...he starts picking things up from <br/>
the table, he turns light switches on and off....we go back outside, <br/>
back to the chachkis...knocks a little garden gnome over, takes them <br/>
out fo the ground, picks stones out of a little decorative fountain, <br/>
he just touches everything!  This is a common thing for him...he is <br/>
so curious about his world and just wants to experience it by <br/>
touching everything.  All the while this is happening my neighbor and <br/>
I are saying stuff like &quot;oh, that has to stay there&quot;, &quot;please put <br/>
that back&quot;, &quot;look with your eyes&quot; etc...  He&#39;s such an amazing little <br/>
guy...so interested in the world around him...but when we are in a <br/>
social situation like that I find it very hard to get him to curb his <br/>
impulses.  Then I end up getting frustrated because I find the answer <br/>
is just avoiding those situations altogether (I want to be able to <br/>
stop and talk to my neighbor for 10 minutes or visit a friend <br/>
etc....)...I should point out that her kids were playing on the patio <br/>
too and Ethan (my 2yo) was with us so it wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t have <br/>
other people to do things with or even that I wasn&#39;t paying attention <br/>
to him.  OH, another example of this was the other day when we were <br/>
at our neighborhood pool club and we were leaving and apparently <br/>
Lucas walked by a chair and saw a hat on it.  He just reached over <br/>
and picked it up and threw it on the ground and walked on....I didn&#39;t <br/>
see this myself.  The woman who&#39;s hat it was, again a neighbor I <br/>
don&#39;t know well, ran up to me and (very rudely IMO) told me what had <br/>
happened...also pointing out that there was an $80 pair of sunglasses <br/>
in the hat that she didn&#39;t wish to replace!  I think he just does <br/>
things like this because he is not aware.  There is no malicious <br/>
intent...he just saw the hat and it looked like something fun to flip <br/>
on the floor, KWIM?  We have talks about not touching things that are <br/>
not ours....it just seems like the process of understanding this is <br/>
coming really slow for him.  It is pretty much the same scenerio when <br/>
we go to stores or even when we are at the park, he might just go up <br/>
to someone else&#39;s blanket and help himself to their snacks...So...I <br/>
guess the issue here is imparting on him the concept of other <br/>
people&#39;s belongings and personal space....any suggestions?  I really <br/>
want to honor his curiousity and who he is....but when I go out with <br/>
him I have to watch him closer than I watch my 2yo....OK, this is a <br/>
rambling email...just sort of wanted to cover the realm of things he <br/>
does...I do find myself loosing my patience in these situations <br/>
sometimes and I would love to find some other ways of dealing with <br/>
it.  OH, forgot to mention that at the neighbors yesterday he also <br/>
picked up a tennis ball and threw it inside their open door....Eye-<br/>
yeye-yeye!<br/>

<br/>
Since he&#39;s 5, how about going at it from the point of view of explaining<br/>
that you love his curiosity but asking him calmly how he would feel if it<br/>
were his hat and sunglasses that someone else tossed on the ground, or his<br/>
special flowers that got smushed or whatever the situation?  I find with my<br/>
5 yo daughter she can go along with doing unto others what she would like to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461212587">As I said in my post...we do have these converstations...and I think <br/>
he understands, he just seems to have a hard time remembering when he <br/>
is in those situations....even from minute to minute...ie: he just <br/>
knocked over the garden gnome....&quot;opps, we need to pick that back <br/>
up...that&#39;s a decoration they would like to stay there and not get <br/>
broken&quot;.....and two minutes later the tennis ball is thrown into the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also - you have a &quot;touchy&quot; kid and he will probably ALWAYS be like that <br/>
- expect him to gravitate toward careers that involve the sense of <br/>
touch. I have one of my three like that too - she was JUST like him <br/>
when she was five - I could have written just what you did - and she&#39;s <br/>
now a ceramicist, knitter, crocheter, and painter.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have to have a &quot;bag of tricks&quot; to keep him from doing things <br/>
like flipping that hat over - you do want him to understand that <br/>
handling other people&#39;s things without permission is a bad idea, in <br/>
general. So - you&#39;ll want to say it - &quot;Luc, don&#39;t handle other people&#39;s <br/>
things without permission.&quot;  I mean, that is just a general principal <br/>
of getting along with other family members, friends, and neighbors and <br/>
he deserves to really know that - or people will not like to have him <br/>
around - now or in the future.<br/>
<br/>
But - back to the bag of tricks. I used to literally carry a big bag <br/>
with me - not a little purse, but a BIG one - and the reason was that I <br/>
carried so many cool things in it - things to keep a kids hands happily <br/>
busy for 10 minutes or so. I still carry some things and I&#39;ve helped <br/>
out other young moms quite a few times - pulled out a little handheld <br/>
game for example for their child to fool with for a few minutes while <br/>
we had a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those kinds of things that people will say, &quot;Talk to him <br/>
about it, explain this or that.....&quot; - but if he&#39;s like my oldest <br/>
daughter, his touching impulse is too quick and strong - he isn&#39;t <br/>
capable of thinking first.<br/>
<br/>
So - you can&#39;t get discouraged, he&#39;ll eventually learn to keep his <br/>
hands off and take more care of other people&#39;s property - but you&#39;ll <br/>
probably have to keep a far closer eye on him than other people do with <br/>
their kids his age and you&#39;ll need to find a way to do that without <br/>
being resentful of him being like he is (I know, you&#39;re not, I LOVE <br/>
your descriptions of him - you always are so careful to see and point <br/>
out the positive side of his traits).<br/>
<br/>
It really wasn&#39;t okay for him to flip that person&#39;s hat over as he <br/>
walked by it - and if I had my sunglasses in there (they are $300 <br/>
prescription sunglasses), I&#39;d have been annoyed, too. You have a <br/>
dilemma there - because you really can&#39;t watch him and anticipate his <br/>
every move - sometimes you&#39;re just going to have to apologize sweetly <br/>
and move on. But, I would also want to make sure my child knew that the <br/>
person was really annoyed by it and that they had a right to be annoyed <br/>
- I wouldn&#39;t hold out on that information - he needs to know that <br/>
people won&#39;t like it if he fools with their things. STILL - no big <br/>
lecture - just , &quot;Hey, she was mad at you for doing that with her hat - <br/>
let&#39;s not touch other people&#39;s things without their permission.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is give him a LOT of opportunity for that kind of <br/>
physical sensory input - probably far more than you can imagine he&#39;d <br/>
want. Give him opportunities to smash things for example. And put him <br/>
in the bathtub with a big bowl of pudding and let him paint the tub and <br/>
himself with it. He needs soft things and rough things and smooth <br/>
things and gooey things and so on - lots and lots of kinds of things to <br/>
have his hands on with every texture.<br/>
<br/>
Make a habit of playing games with him where you put something in a bag <br/>
and he reaches in without looking and has to guess what it is. Put <br/>
kernels of popcorn, rice, feathers, peeled grapes, sand, marbles, and <br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a sandbox? Do you make playdough? Do some kinds of crafts? <br/>
Build things with lego, blocks, etc? Build with popsicle sticks and <br/>
glue - fingerpaint (again - think bathtub for really messy arts and <br/>
crafts).<br/>
<br/>
Make a giant &quot;touch&quot; book - use strong pages of paper and glue things <br/>
onto it - you write words like &quot;We went for a walk and found a feather <br/>
(feather on that page) and a stick (glue stick on that page) and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Get him his own tools - real tools that he can handle - hammer,nails, <br/>
saw. Help him learn to use them. If he&#39;s not quite ready to hammer <br/>
nails into wood - get styrofoam and hammer golf tees into it. Kids LOVE <br/>
to do that.  In fact, chunks of styrofoam and golf tees is something I <br/>
used to have in my bag of tricks - in plastic baggies - I could pull <br/>
out a chunk of styrofoam and some brightly colored golf tees and kids <br/>
would have fun sticking them into the styrofoam, making patterns, etc.<br/>
<br/>
OH - get pattern blocks and geoboards - get two geoboards with colored <br/>
rubber bands so you can make a pattern and he can try to copy it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, geoboards and rubber bands can be in your bag of tricks. So can <br/>
dice, cards, handheld electronic games, small colored pencil sets with <br/>
a cool pad of paper, gel pens and black paper pads, MAGIC paper - <br/>
whatever they call it these days that is black and you scrape it and it <br/>
is colored underneath,<br/>
<br/>
Go to michaels and look at the little craft kits - lace up leather <br/>
pouches, etc. There are so many he could do and you could just keep <br/>
them in your purse to pull out when needed.<br/>
<br/>
If you give him more and more and more hands-on physical high touch <br/>
stimulating sensory input kinds of things to do - he&#39;ll find it easier <br/>
to keep his hands from automatically touching everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Think of his hands as just CRAVING that sensory input - he needs a lot <br/>
of it. Don&#39;t just think of depriving him of it when it is not <br/>
appropriate, think of satisfying it in ways that are appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
And - you may NOT be able to go stand in a neighbor&#39;s house or yard <br/>
that has too many temptations for him - it is only for a few years - <br/>
you can sacrifice putting him into those situations - with his needs, <br/>
it is a sort of set-up for you to do that to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149276077">Pam I want to thank you for a great post full of great ideas!  I have a<br/>
touchy kid too!  While I&#39;m here I might introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Raven and I have three kids: Ted is 6, Kat is 4 and Will is going<br/>
to be 2 in a matter of a few weeks.<br/>
Ted went to kindergarten at PS last year with a awesome patient, loving<br/>
teacher and he learned a lot about putting the lids back on markers and<br/>
cleaning up when you are finished and how to stand in line.  However he did<br/>
not learn anything else really, not at her fault just that she had 20 kids<br/>
and Ted was so far ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Ted is a very touchy kid, and highly sensitive.  We sometimes struggle as<br/>
parents with this and we decided that since Ted taught himself to read at 2<br/>
1/2 and loves to learn that this should be the time to cut the school cord<br/>
and let him loose.  We didn&#39;t want public school to try and &quot;fix&quot; his<br/>
sensitivity issues.  He loves to hug and touch.  This is one of our biggest<br/>
things, he is known to go up to school mates during a T-Ball game for<br/>
example and hug them.  Luckily Dad is the coach and can gently remind Ted to<br/>
get in ready position.  Also luckily for us Ted&#39;s two closest friends are<br/>
attachment parenting families and understand. He will touch other people<br/>
inappropriately, like seeing grandma&#39;s breast giggle, or diving under<br/>
strangers legs.  I could see him in the hat position very easily.  We also<br/>
understand that it is the touching he craves and often offer to hug him when<br/>
these situations arise.  It&#39;s usually not enough because he also seems to<br/>
feed off of other people and recharges his batteries to souped up.  We hope<br/>
he will outgrow it but for now try to talk to him about things that might<br/>
make other people uncomfortable.  An example is that he should ask his<br/>
friends if it&#39;s okay to hug them or kiss them first.  He doesn&#39;t  remember<br/>
unless prompted however.<br/>
<br/>
He has other sensitivities also, sound, light, food textures, seeing foods<br/>
he doesn&#39;t like, clothing, getting wet. I could go on. But to me he is his<br/>
perfect self and I know school would try to conform all the funny, loving<br/>
things he does.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that your not alone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;How do you (the collective &quot;you&quot; of the list) tell, or estimate, or what<br/>
&gt;leads you to believe, that your kids &quot;need&quot; to socialize more?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Robyn L. Coburn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy, Ted can let you know when he hasn&#39;t socialized enough, he just gets<br/>
plain cranky!  And wants to have parental play all day long!  However if we<br/>
can get together with our AP group then he is good to build legos on his own<br/>
for hours afterwards.  For me it&#39;s trying to figure out what is enough for<br/>
Ted and I.  I don&#39;t craze socialization.  I&#39;m okay without seeing other<br/>
people for weeks.  Ted will get stir crazy at the end of a week.  So we<br/>
compromise.  Usually we have a large group meeting at a park one day a week<br/>
and then have a small group of three families that get together another day.<br/>
If Ted is still needing to see more people we will go to the library book<br/>
club for his age group.  There however we can run into that recharging of<br/>
his batteries (or soul)  to such an extreme that his actions are not<br/>
appropriate for the library so we don&#39;t go on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that was long winded enough.  This seems like a great group.<br/>
