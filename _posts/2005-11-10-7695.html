<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786933563">Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to really answer your post in depth, my family is<br/>
starting &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; in a minute, but I did<br/>
want to put one thing out there...<br/>
<br/>
She is 16 right?<br/>
Most states compulsory schooling laws are only to age 16, so I don&#39;t<br/>
think your ex can really do anything if she leaves school. Something<br/>
to look into anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Part of me wonders why<br/>
she is okay with failing and does nothing to try to succeed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Take this with the humor it&#39;s intended; DUH.:)<br/>
<br/>
School sucks if you don&#39;t want to be there. She&#39;s a smart girl to stop<br/>
doing something that is useless in her life. She&#39;s getting nothing out<br/>
of this experience other than having her spirit crushed from the way<br/>
it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Real Lives&quot; by Grace Llewellyn? Has SHE read it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to post more later.<br/>
<br/>
