Conference Retreat <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The conference site is a gorgeous camp in Lebanon, New Jersey- it has nature<br/>
trails, a lake, an awesome creek for creek hikes, great stars, beautiful<br/>
grounds and wifi too!  As with so many other unschooling conferences that<br/>
have taken root in the past few years, this one was inspired by the Live and<br/>
Learn Conference that just had its final magnificent run in September &#39;08.<br/>
Great Big Happy Life will be a blend of inspirational presentations, awesome<br/>
participant led funshops, scavenger hunts,  informal discussions, intense<br/>
relaxation and just generally hanging out with other unschooling families.<br/>
Join us!<br/>
