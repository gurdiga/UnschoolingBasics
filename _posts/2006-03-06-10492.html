<div id="ygrps-yiv-501777056">&lt;&lt;I was wondering from all of you and from Reina, what stresses have you found<br/>
in unschooling?  Are there really any or is it just our &quot;schooled&quot;<br/>
perspective of it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I know a few others have mentioned it, but the only real unschooling stressor we&#39;ve encountered is from folks who don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; homeschooling (ie, my parents).  I tend to get incredibly defensive when my parents begin questioning Tristan or myself.  I admit, I haven&#39;t gotten to the point where I can gracefully change the subject or just brush off the comments...I hope that will change in time.  To be honest, unschooling couldn&#39;t have come at a better time, as it has relieved SO many stressors in our family.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have a number of other stresses in our family, but they aren&#39;t related to unschooling...well, I guess one is in a way.  I&#39;ve essentially been a single parent for nearly 7 months now (only 5 more to go!), and that is taking it&#39;s toll on me.  I adore being with Tristan, but it does wear on me when we are together 24/7.  Not to mention it&#39;s incredibly challenging trying to get everything done around the house (keeping the house presentable, bills, care of animals, etc.) and supporting Tristan in all of his interests.<br/>

I agree with Malinda.  The main stress is from others, but getting  <br/>
uninterrupted time for yourself or for things that need to be done can be  challenging. <br/>
 Especially for someone sort of ADD like me.  :)  As  soon as I get started <br/>
paying the bills, someone needs some sort of  attention.  Then I lose my bill <br/>
paying momentum!<br/>
 <br/>
I think it also depends on what your kids are into at the moment.  If  it is <br/>
something that you really enjoy, it is a joy.  If it is something  challenging <br/>
for you or takes a lot of time and effort, it can be a  stressor.  But <br/>
children are going to have different interests, whether they  are unschooling or <br/>
not, so it is maybe more of a parenting stressor, not just an  unschooling one.<br/>
 <br/>
And truthfully, these stresses are incredibly minor compared to the  stresses <br/>
of school life!  Just thinking about getting out of the house  dressed, fed <br/>
and with homework and lunches gives me a panic attack!!<br/>

I was a single parent for the first four years with my first child.<br/>
I sympathize with the 24/7 and your time.. <br/>
When I was single I nearly had to force myself to find something I could do  <br/>
while my son slept. <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling should allow you more rather than less freedoms to be who you  <br/>
both are and enjoy those times. <br/>
I now have a family of 6 and my son still remembers those years. Some  days <br/>
he longs for the one on one with mom all day. We do go just the two of us  but <br/>
now we answer to 4 rather than none. <br/>
