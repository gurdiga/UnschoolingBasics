We can bring Barbie&#39;s.. I know it&#39;s not very creative but they are new and  <br/>
sometimes popular. I&#39;ll bring a few of the two styles I have..<br/>
 <br/>
We also have new mini ponies with lil brushes. Prob 8-10 of  those..<br/>
I know I have something else.. Slips my mind but I&#39;ll figure it out before  <br/>
May.<br/>
 <br/>
Last MA convention we went on scholarship so I would be honored to add  items <br/>
to assist others get there as we did..<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
See you there!<br/>
