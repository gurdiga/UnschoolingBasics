<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989770743">I have to say one of the most positive things that has happened out of <br/>
email-land in the past couple of weeks was the Mom who called me in my area to say <br/>
she was thinking of starting up a support group!  I think because of things she <br/>
had read on this list! So, not only do I really hope a group (however small <br/>
and informal) comes together near me, but I hope we hear about others doing <br/>
their thing!<br/>
