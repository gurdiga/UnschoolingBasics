<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196007333">Dear friends<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading &#39;The uses of Enchantment&#39; by Bruno Bettelheim. This is<br/>
mainly about fairy tales and how they are the best tools of problem solving<br/>
we can give our children. Bettelheim says that children live in a magical<br/>
world up to puberty and our grown-up &#39;face facts of reality&#39; attitude does<br/>
not cater to their &#39;beingness&#39; at all.<br/>
<br/>
How many of us don&#39;t listen to our intuition any more because we were taught<br/>
not to believe in irrational things?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and on the subject of death a friend just yesterday told us about a<br/>
little girl who came up with a wonderful explanation after the experience of<br/>
a funeral. &quot;It is like a bottle of coke. It&#39;s bubbly and alive when it is<br/>
full. When the contents is gone, it is an empty bottle (the body that is<br/>
buried) and not needed any more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And Alexander was fascinated by the cemetery for a while. So we took some<br/>
time and walked around the older and newer parts of our local cemetery. At<br/>
some point he mentioned, &quot;But the &#39;longing&#39; is still there.&quot; He used the<br/>
German word &quot;Sehnen&quot; which sounds like &#39;Seele&#39; which means &#39;soul&#39;. This gave<br/>
him full satisfaction about this subject. Our children know what they<br/>
want/need to know and how to get the answers that are right for them. Isn&#39;t<br/>
this what unschooling is all about?<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>
Ulrike</div>
