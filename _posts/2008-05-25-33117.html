  By the way I have heard coconut oil works really well to work into AA hair and comb through it. It is natural and safe as well. HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633935524">Carol, I have a friend whose dd is African-American and this is her recommendation:  <br/>
Yes, I can help with that question.   I use a Pantene product that is put out by Target.  It comes in a brown bottle and is made specifically for &quot;women of color&quot;.  It has shampoo and conditioner, but what I really love is the cream that you can put into their hair after their shower.  It is a stay in cream and really has lots of extra moisturizer in it.   African-Americans need lots more lotions and oils and especially for their hair.   I have even used baby oil, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps. Cameron<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066185747">Hey there Carol  I am African American and my daughter (you can see her in<br/>
our blog) tends to have coarse, very curly hair.  Minenot so much &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For her I usually put her hair in twists or I braid it.  Carols Daughter<br/>
(what a coincidence) is a company that creates hair products specifically<br/>
for AA hair and body.  www.carolsdaughter.com My sister usually buys the<br/>
products and when shes changed her mind or something she gives them to me.<br/>
The stuff works great.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It might help though if you didnt see it as the driest, curliest, hair on<br/>
the planet.  Hair can be traumatic, especially for African American girls<br/>
who see straight hair as pretty hair.  Even for me I have to take a deep<br/>
breath before I do Safiyas hair because I know that it will take work and a<br/>
lot of time for me to untangle each tangle.  I can take 4-5 hours to do her<br/>
hair because I want to take my time and have it be a labor of love.  I dont<br/>
want it to hurt and then her think about how much pain her hair causes her,<br/>
kwim?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And yes, the Pantene products work very well, as does Queen Helenes<br/>
Cholesterol conditioner.  Natural products work better than  typical store<br/>
brands.  Oils work better than grease.  Too many chemicals dry out African<br/>
American hair.  And stay away from just about every product created for<br/>
Caucasian hair.  Those products work great for Caucasian hair  not so much<br/>
for the coarse and curly type &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Email me if you have any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Namasté<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

I didn&#39;t mean to imply anything negative about my daughter&#39;s hair, I just wanted to make it as easy as possible for her.
