 </span></blockquote>Most bread machines have a &quot;dough&quot; setting. It mixes, kneads, rises, kneads<br/>
and rises the bread.  Then the machine beeps to tell you to come finish the<br/>
bread.  I let it mix, knead and rise and then I take it out and knead by<br/>
hand and let it rise again.  It takes about an hour to do all that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest complaint that I hear about bread is that it is too heavy or too<br/>
dry.  that comes from measuring flour incorrectly. We are sold &quot;pre-sifted<br/>
flour&quot; and so most people don&#39;t sift their flour before they measure it.  I<br/>
keep a small whisk in my flour container that I use to &quot;fluff&quot; the flour<br/>
before I measure it.  Then I spoon it into a dry measure cup making sure not<br/>
to compact it.  A dry measure cup measures differently than a liquid measure<br/>
cup.  A dry measure cup is usually sold in a set of nesting cups.  I have a<br/>
half cup measure that I just keep in my flour (I also have a quarter cup<br/>
that I keep in my sugars).  Liquid measure cups are the ones that have a<br/>
pourable spout.  Also a better way to measure wheat flour when you are<br/>
combining it with white (like for a recipe that calls for 2 cups whole wheat<br/>
and 1 cup all purpose or bread flour) is to measure it once into a bowl with<br/>
the white flour and then mix it well together with a whisk and then<br/>
remeasure it again (so in my example you would then measure out 3 cups of<br/>
mixed flour).  You will have some left over, not a lot - less than 1/4 cup)<br/>
but it will make a huge difference in how your bread turns out.  If you use<br/>
100% whole wheat, sift it then measure it.<br/>

makes a difference, and that comes with practice.  Although I enjoy <br/>
the bread from my machine just fine (though it rises a lot higher now <br/>
that I live about 2500 ft above sea level, rather than about 2&#39; <br/>
above...), my pizza dough I have always adjusted by feel.<br/>
