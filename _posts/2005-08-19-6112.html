This is  exactly one of the reasoning points I had with the homeschooling <br/>
group and  this mother in particular and they came back with all kinds of <br/>
stuff <br/>
from  Dr. Dobson  and that I was twisting scripture.  Like I said they  were <br/>
not in <br/>
the least bit willing to be reasonable.   <br/>

*****************************<br/>
They WANT to be able to spank their kids, and with a clear conscience. They  <br/>
don&#39;t want to question it. They want to do whatever they can to control their  <br/>
kids.<br/>
 <br/>
Frankly, even if you interpret the Bible literally, there are lots of ways  <br/>
to read this. It&#39;s not about the Bible. <br/>
