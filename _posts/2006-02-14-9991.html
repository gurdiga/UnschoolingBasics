chores, I smell the cake I just put in the oven,(for dipping in the <br/>
chocolate sauce I made last night).  My son(almost 12) is standing <br/>

from my nose, playing on his playstaion2.  Does life get any better <br/>
than this?  Just wanted to pass this golden moment on.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900757465">Carolyn, it surely is....I mean how many boys this age<br/>
still do things like that who are with their school<br/>
friends all day?  I&#39;d venture to say not to many,<br/>
there is that &quot;cool&quot; image to uphold.  My son is<br/>
almost 12 too, in August.  Yes, cherish that moment<br/>
and know exactly how precious it is.  If more parents<br/>
could be with their children like this, in a LOVING<br/>
environment all day, I doubt that any parent would<br/>
dread the coming teen years.<br/>
