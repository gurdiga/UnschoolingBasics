<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460927873">So what happened when you went and sat down with the kids and joined in<br/>
the play? When you modeled how to share nicely? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe not being around the families is the best solution. But maybe a<br/>
good example is also needed.<br/>

&gt; i have a hard time w/ when other kids are downright cruel and seem to <br/>
&gt; single out my dd megh who is 4.5yo. this happened recently w/ 2 kids <br/>
&gt; from 2 different families at one of my homeschool/unschool groups (i <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know how they think combining homeschoolers w/ unschoolers is <br/>
&gt; somehow like-minded...it is but it isn&#39;t ya know...). i was apalled <br/>
&gt; at how my dd and her friend who is 5 were picked on...they were <br/>
&gt; peacefully playing. some of my friends from that group tell me to <br/>
&gt; have tolerance for the kids as they may have been having a bad day or <br/>
&gt; a hard time at home or whatever but still...it makes me not want to <br/>
&gt; be around these families if this is how rude their kids are. </span></blockquote></div>
