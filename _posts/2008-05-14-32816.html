<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063887958">Thank you, Joyce and Kelly and Ren and everyone else who participated in<br/>
this discussion.  I really appreciate all your thoughts.  I don&#39;t disagree<br/>
with anything anyone has said, but I think I have a fundamental difference<br/>
of opinion with many of you regarding &quot;consequences&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I see consequences, both natural and imposed, and something everyone<br/>
experiences.  All of our actions produce consequences of some type.  I think<br/>
we learn more effectively from natural consequences than from imposed<br/>
consequences, but as adults, we&#39;re exposed to imposed consequences<br/>
constantly. The natural consequence of speeding might be an auto accident,<br/>
but I&#39;m more likely to get a speeding ticket (an imposed consequence) than<br/>
suffer an auto accident.  A more &quot;unschooling&quot; type consequence may be that<br/>
my son&#39;s college choices (if we wants to go to college) might be curtailed<br/>
because he chooses not to study algebra.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with the question of choices and consequences all the time.<br/>
Here&#39;s a situation a friend of mine faced.  I don&#39;t know what I would have<br/>
done.  My friend Elly was at a gathering of unschoolers some time ago.  She<br/>
was invited to spend the weekend with a family she and I were<br/>
both acquainted with.  There were three other families there whom she didn&#39;t<br/>
know before that weekend.  Those families professed to be radical<br/>
unschoolers.  Our acquantance is about as radical as they come.<br/>
<br/>
Something happened that weekend that really disturbed my friend.  In the<br/>
early evening on Saturday the 15yo daughter of our acquaintance asked her<br/>
dad for a joint.  He went into the bedroom where he kept his stuff, and<br/>
brought her out a joint.  The 15yo thanked her dad and went to join the<br/>
other teens.  Elly&#39;s son told her that the 15yo smoked it on the porch<br/>
and offered it to the other teens there, who declined.  Please keep in mind<br/>
that we know this teen and her mom, but we hardly know the dad.<br/>
<br/>
The way my friend describes it, once she had gathered her wits, she kinda<br/>
lit into the guy.  She didn&#39;t so much question his parenting as his judgment<br/>
in putting everyone there at risk.  He defended himself by saying that he&#39;d<br/>
rather his daughter smoke pot under his watchful eye than away from<br/>
home.  My friend said, well you&#39;re not at home now (they were in a rented<br/>
beach house) and how dare you put us all at risk of being hauled to jail.<br/>
He said, you&#39;re overreacting -- nobody&#39;s going to jail.<br/>
<br/>
Elly was at a loss as to what to do.  They left the next morning.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know what I would have done.  I haven&#39;t been able to look at this family the<br/>
same way since then.  I&#39;m happy that my son has never socialized with their<br/>
teen daughter.  Have any of you encountered a situation like that?<br/>

<br/>
I think it IS irresponsible to put others in an illegal situation<br/>
without their consent!  <br/>
<br/>
I know  some unschooled teens that have tried pot, or use it but they<br/>
would never just assume someone else is ok with it. They&#39;re very<br/>
respectful of other people&#39;s boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
I personally think pot should be legal, yet I don&#39;t smoke it. I have<br/>
very open conversations with my kids about it and I&#39;m pretty sure they<br/>
would talk to me if they chose to use. However, just because we are<br/>
open about discussions and ideas and philosophies, does NOT mean I&#39;d<br/>
risk my family be providing it!<br/>
<br/>
There are very real (though arbitrary) consequences which could affect<br/>
other people in ways they aren&#39;t willing to risk. I could have social<br/>
services interfere with my freedoms related to my other children<br/>
should something happen. I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s respectful for<br/>
anyone to assume another person is willing to take that risk.<br/>
<br/>
Why would the teen NEED to have a joint when others are around? Seems<br/>
they would keep that more private unless they&#39;re trying to flaunt it.<br/>
&quot;See how cool we are&quot; seems to be the message. <br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I think the point is, that parents don&#39;t need to ADD to the arbitrary<br/>
consequences that DO happen in society. Children will encounter those<br/>
situations and be better equipped to make good choices for themselves<br/>
if they&#39;ve NOT had a bunch of arbitrary crap dumped on them.<br/>
<br/>
Laws can be arbitrary. My family doesn&#39;t have to aid and abet this<br/>
condition.:) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*In terms of mindful parenting*, all the ones you listed I would see  <br/>
as natural consequences. The parent and child partnership don&#39;t have  <br/>
control over those.<br/>
<br/>
I would use the phrase imposed consequences on those a parent does  <br/>
have control over but makes or allows to happen anyway as a way to  <br/>
change a child&#39;s behavior.<br/>
<br/>
In conventional parenting, parents are encouraged to let kids suffer  <br/>
the consequences so they&#39;ll learn. What that ends up meaning is the  <br/>
parent can see something that will upset the child coming but does  <br/>
nothing to avert it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a parent sees a child has left his bike out again and  <br/>
it&#39;s about to rain and lets the bike get rained on to teach the child  <br/>
what happens so they can learn to put their bike away.<br/>
<br/>
Or the milk gets left out again and Mom gets mad and blows up as a  <br/>
way to teach the kids that the consequence of leaving the milk out is  <br/>
that mom isn&#39;t happy.<br/>
<br/>
But kids are naturally more oblivious to their environment. They&#39;re  <br/>
thinking in the moment because that&#39;s how their brains work right  <br/>
now. Consequences won&#39;t mature their brains. Only time will. But in  <br/>
the meantime parents can make their lives miserable with the mistaken  <br/>
belief that the kids need taught.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your friend was right, the guy was wrong. The law isn&#39;t going to  <br/>
think much of his reasoning either at a rented place or at home. What  <br/>
he&#39;s doing is illegal. He and she could end up in jail.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Kelly will be along soon to tell her experience with her son  <br/>
and pot. If she&#39;s busy you can type &quot;cameron pot smoke&quot; into the  <br/>
message search in the archives:<br/>

<br/>
She gave him information to help with his decision rather than as a  <br/>
roundabout way of saying no: It&#39;s illegal and he could be arrested.  <br/>
(Probably mentioned what  a record could do to future job prospects.)  <br/>
If he does it at home she and Ben could be arrested and the fall out  <br/>
would affect his younger brother. Those are real consequences of  <br/>
actions.<br/>

  SO true!  We were out for dinner recently with my in laws.  Jade saw others at the table sprinkle salt on their food, so she decided to copy them, and when she turned the shaker upside down tons of salt poured onto her noodles.  I reached to take them when she told me what happened, and my fil said &#39;leave it, maybe she&#39;ll learn a lesson&#39;.  Even before living how we are living it would not have occurred to me to let her eat a mouthful of salt knowing how horrible it would be.  It just seems so meaningless and cruel to me to see something coming that will upset them and just do nothing.<br/>
<br/>

   <br/>
  I am definitely filing this away for the next in law visit.  &quot;consequences won&#39;t mature their brains, only time will&quot;...another wise Joyce quotable...thanks Joyce.  I so love to understand better the timeline of their maturing brains.  In the salt situation what irks me so much is that my fil wouldn&#39;t think of &#39;letting&#39; one of his friends inadvertantly take a mouthful of salt, but when it&#39;s his granddaughter, in his mind it&#39;s a perfectly acceptable way to &#39;teach her a lesson&#39;, argh!  It does help me understand and have more compassion for my husband knowing he was raised by this man.<br/>

Consequences are all around us. But we don&#39;t NEED to have arbitrary <br/>
ones imposed on us by our parents. There *really* are enough in <br/>
day-to-day living.<br/>
<br/>
Not getting into college is NOT a consequence of not studying algebra. <br/>
Having to take a remedial math class IN college *may* be, however. <br/>
Depends on the kid and the college and the major and...lots of things. <br/>
But it&#39;s NOT a &quot;natural&quot; OR necessarily an *imposed* consequence.<br/>
<br/>
If we are our children&#39;s partners and not their adversaries, we can <br/>
help them work to avoid consequences and to work *with* consequences. <br/>
We really shouldn&#39;t be making some up in order to teach lessons.<br/>

<br/>
Nope. But I have plenty of pot experience with a teen. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Basically the dad was right in that &quot;no one&#39;s going to jail.&quot; <br/>
Meaning---he lucked out that time. And probably had many, many times <br/>
before.  And probably *will* many, many times in the future. Seems like <br/>
a common happening at their home. Taking that attitude, though, *could* <br/>
risk having one of the irate parents there sending the cops to his <br/>
house! He might regret that decision one day.<br/>
<br/>
Although I *do* think marijuana should be legal (thanks to my son&#39;s <br/>
research), I have never smoked pot---and probably never will. I do <br/>
recognize that this dad certainly has the *right* to believe as he does <br/>
(under his watchful eye and all)---but I have HUGE problems with his <br/>
lack of respect for others there who don&#39;t share his beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron and I spent many hours talking about his pot smoking. I *knew* <br/>
I couldn&#39;t stop him (and if any of you think you *can* stop your kids <br/>
 from doing anything they set their minds to---think again!), but we <br/>
needed to have a common understanding of what it means to purposefully <br/>
break laws and what kind of situation that could put our family in. It <br/>
was a HOT topic for several years. And one I&#39;ve written extensively <br/>
about on this and several other lists.<br/>
<br/>
*I* would have lit into this guy too, because he wasn&#39;t taking *US* <br/>
into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have a problem letting my child associate with the daughter. <br/>
I *would* ask her how she feels about putting others who don&#39;t share <br/>
her beliefs at risk. I would try to understand *her* viewpoint. To me, <br/>
her father&#39;s a lost cause, but I would like to know where *she* stands <br/>
and whether she&#39;d be willing to listen to what bothers me about the <br/>
laissez faire attitude her father displayed that night. My guess is <br/>
that she was trying to &quot;impress&quot; her friends. But she could very well <br/>
share her dad&#39;s views.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, when sharing lodging, we need to be cognizant of the <br/>
needs/wants/desires of *all* present. Imposing something illegal could <br/>
very well make others uncomfortable. And discomfort is not something I <br/>
choose to cause my guests. I try to make my home (and rental properties <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) comfortable for *all* present. This dad doesn&#39;t share my views on <br/>
how to make that happen.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580790939">Kelly, I very much appreciate your thoughts.  I don&#39;t have a major problem<br/>
with pot.  I do have a problem with this family causing discomfort and<br/>
putting others at risk.  My kids and I have often talked about risks<br/>
associated with choices we make, including the choice to use tobacco,<br/>
alcohol and drugs -- legal and illegal.  For instance, the choice to drink<br/>
enough to impair judgment, which might lead to making a foolish choice such<br/>
as driving a vehicle or engaging in other dangerous behavior.  And, we also<br/>
talk about the difference between risk to ourselves and risk to others.<br/>

&gt; Although I *do* think marijuana should be legal (thanks to my son&#39;s<br/>
&gt; research), I have never smoked pot---and probably never will. I do<br/>
&gt; recognize that this dad certainly has the *right* to believe as he does<br/>
&gt; (under his watchful eye and all)---but I have HUGE problems with his<br/>
&gt; lack of respect for others there who don&#39;t share his beliefs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cameron and I spent many hours talking about his pot smoking. I *knew*<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t stop him (and if any of you think you *can* stop your kids<br/>
&gt; from doing anything they set their minds to---think again!), but we<br/>
&gt; needed to have a common understanding of what it means to purposefully<br/>
&gt; break laws and what kind of situation that could put our family in. It<br/>
&gt; was a HOT topic for several years. And one I&#39;ve written extensively<br/>
&gt; about on this and several other lists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *I* would have lit into this guy too, because he wasn&#39;t taking *US*<br/>
&gt; into consideration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t have a problem letting my child associate with the daughter.<br/>
&gt; I *would* ask her how she feels about putting others who don&#39;t share<br/>
&gt; her beliefs at risk. I would try to understand *her* viewpoint. To me,<br/>
&gt; her father&#39;s a lost cause, but I would like to know where *she* stands<br/>
&gt; and whether she&#39;d be willing to listen to what bothers me about the<br/>
&gt; laissez faire attitude her father displayed that night. My guess is<br/>
&gt; that she was trying to &quot;impress&quot; her friends. But she could very well<br/>
&gt; share her dad&#39;s views.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that, when sharing lodging, we need to be cognizant of the<br/>
&gt; needs/wants/desires of *all* present. Imposing something illegal could<br/>
&gt; very well make others uncomfortable. And discomfort is not something I<br/>
&gt; choose to cause my guests. I try to make my home (and rental properties<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;) comfortable for *all* present. This dad doesn&#39;t share my views on<br/>
&gt; how to make that happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can read more about my struggle (or lack of one) with pot in the<br/>
&gt; archives here.<br/>

<br/>
Kelly, I very much appreciate your thoughts.  I don&#39;t have a major <br/>
problem<br/>
with pot.  I do have a problem with this family causing discomfort and<br/>
putting others at risk.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do too. This would have been very unacceptable to me, and I would <br/>
have told him so. But...I&#39;m not shy in letting folks know how I feel. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
 My kids and I have often talked about risks<br/>
associated with choices we make, including the choice to use tobacco,<br/>
alcohol and drugs -- legal and illegal.  For instance, the choice to <br/>
drink<br/>
enough to impair judgment, which might lead to making a foolish choice <br/>
such<br/>
as driving a vehicle or engaging in other dangerous behavior.  And, we <br/>
also<br/>
talk about the difference between risk to ourselves and risk to others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We do too. But MOST important is that they know that if they *do* <br/>
choose to swim in these waters, *I* am THERE to help them navigate.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t make them sit in a jail cell overnight to teach them a lesson. <br/>
I want them to KNOW that they can call me *any* time for *any* reason. <br/>
I&#39;m happy to clean up their messes.<br/>
<br/>
Safety is of UTMOST importance. Going &quot;against my wishes&quot; does NOT take <br/>
precedence over their comfort and safety. EVER.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013135076">Im also of the mindset of legalizing marijuana :)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was a child both of my parents smoked weed and regular cigarettes.  I<br/>
didnt even know marijuana was a drug until I was 8 years old (rather an<br/>
illegal drug).  I just knew that I liked the smell of weed better than the<br/>
other cigarettes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dad stopped when I was around 10  all smoking.  My mom still smokes<br/>
cigarettes and usually rolls a joint in the morning and one in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My gift-daughter smokes weed from time to time.  She may be home this<br/>
summer.  When shes here well talk about the law and such.  Im sure weve<br/>
talked about it before, but we may need a refresher.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am adamant about no smoking in the house.  Its bad for the air and asthma<br/>
runs in my family.  Two of my children have already shown symptoms of it.<br/>
Id prefer not to add to their breathing issues.  Rohana understands that,<br/>
and doesnt smoke inside of the house.  I appreciate that respect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Namasté<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

  I&#39;ve said this same thing with one further addition:  Both my spouse and I have government jobs that state very strictly, that we CAN NOT bale someone out of jail ever, for any reason, or we face being fired.  My spouse would be more closely watched then I.  My 18yo has known this for years and she also knows that I would come bale her out anyway.  I&#39;d prefer if she didn&#39;t put me in that position.<br/>
   <br/>
  So far she hasn&#39;t.  I *feel* that is her being respectful to herself and us for avoiding activities that could find us in that situation.  She is also aware that jail time *could* prevent her from her current employment goals.  She&#39;s working on becoming a Firefighter/EMT.<br/>

  Is that what you mean about *respecting others needs?<br/>

<br/>
Ben&#39;s military. That comes with a whole string of issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a loud homeschooling mom---I&#39;m sure I&#39;m a pretty easy target: in <br/>
the spotlight and easy to find. So it&#39;s important to *me* to keep our <br/>
i&#39;s dotted and t&#39;s crossed when it comes to anything that could <br/>
jeopardize our homeschooling.<br/>

Those are examples of *real* consequences. Not *natural*, but certainly <br/>
not arbitrarily imposed by the parent.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Is that what you mean about *respecting others needs?<br/>

<br/>
Yes---and that&#39;s what our experience has been too. He&#39;s respectful of <br/>
our limitations and concerns, and he fully understands the consequences <br/>
of his actions.<br/>

The last few days caught us scrambling to find our summer clothes!  We have all seasons of stuff piled at our front door, because we&#39;re never quite sure what&#39;ll be happening when we wake up in the morning.  Hey, It&#39;s unschooling weather &lt;G&gt;.
