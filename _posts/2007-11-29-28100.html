   <br/>
  This is my third year as an AmeriCorps VISTA and I recommend it to anyone who will listen.  It is like the Peace  Corps in that it is a volunteer program but you are a volunteer in the United States with nonprofit organizations.  Although considered a volunteer, you earn a monthly stipend that depends on your state, etc.  I get about 900.00 a monthly. the volunteer has  full health and life insurance as well as 10 holidays, 10 vacation days, approx. 5 sick days and 5 personal.  The commitment is one year and at the end of the year, the volunteer can eith get 4,725.00 to go towards college or 1200.00 check.  Below is the link.  www.americorps.gov.<br/>

All, do any of you know of any groups or organizations that are kind of <br/>
 like<br/>
the Peace Corps? My son James, 18, is looking to DO something, possibly <br/>
go<br/>
somewhere, and while he likes the idea of the Peace Corps, it&#39;s too <br/>
structured<br/>
for him. I&#39;m not sure where or how to look...but he&#39;s a bright, <br/>
open-minded<br/>
young man that is so unconventional and needs to do something to help <br/>
complete<br/>
 him, if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? I&#39;d love to hear of them all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159383650">I worked with IVS International Voluntary Services, and SCI, Service<br/>
Civil Internationale when I lived in BElfast, NI. I was about 20yo,<br/>
and went to France to do Conflict Resolution training, then a youth<br/>
project for French teens recovering from addictions or trying to stay<br/>
away from crime. That had physically hard work and I was pregnant so<br/>
the Belfast office had me transfer to Brussels where I worked in a<br/>
youth centre in the Muslim cartier of the city. <br/>
<br/>
 Ahhhhh.... seems so long ago now five kids later! It was a good<br/>
experience in general, flexibility about what to do, if I wasn&#39;t<br/>
pregnant the Conflict Res training ws for going to Croatia but I had<br/>
not been before and was worried, one woman went there pregnant but she<br/>
had been before and knew people.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know about the American branches but it might be interesting to<br/>
look into.<br/>
