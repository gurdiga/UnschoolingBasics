It signifies yelling. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>really? I thought I was making a joke about the ironic use of all caps in a sentence about yelling. I see it wasn&#39;t a quick one.<br/>
I will say the snarkiness is very rude, even in lowercase. Its clear you think &quot;lessons&quot; are &quot;bad&quot; and telling me I am &quot;giving&quot; one is some sort of knock. Which is even more ironic since learning the unschooling way is about respect and acceptance. Your response is just as reproachful as any unskilled public school teacher. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when nobody needed it. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I should have said &quot;Can we avoid all caps, because it hurts to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

~~It is supremely funny that you and the OP were writing  about not yelling while yelling: &quot;WHO is yelling at you??????&quot; ~~<br/>
<br/>
That would not be considered &quot;yelling&quot; online. That is emphasizing one word.<br/>
<br/>
~~Whether someone &quot;used&quot; all caps to yell is not the point.~~<br/>
<br/>
Then what was your point? You gave everyone a &quot;lesson&quot; on the use of bold when nobody needed it. I&#39;m not sure what the point is here. Let&#39;s stick to discussing unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All caps is used occasionally to emphasize a word. If you don&#39;t like it, there will be very few places on the internet that don&#39;t &quot;hurt to read&quot;. Nor is it against list guidelines here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How other people post is up to them, you post how you believe is helpful. Helpful about unschooling, not other topics. Time to move on...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>******This sentence is one of my pet peeves.  Unschooling is much better described in other ways.  Unschooling is not about respect and acceptance.  It certainly can be...  some days may be very focused on these two qualities, but as a whole it seems problematic and misleading to describe it this way.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who (whom?  I never know when to use that) I do not respect.  There are things I do not accept.  Unschooling isn&#39;t an &quot;anything goes,&quot; type of lifestyle.  Although it may seem that way on the surface.  Living the way we do has allowed my children the chance to be discerning in their choices of who and what to respect and accept.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really hoping this makes sense.  I feel like maybe this will be confusing &lt;G&gt;<br/>
