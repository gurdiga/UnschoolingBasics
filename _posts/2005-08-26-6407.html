<div id="ygrps-yiv-197057164">We had a real problem getting my youngest to agree to use seatbelts and car<br/>
seats when she was little.  As soon as she could (maybe 24 mo?) she would<br/>
escape from the restraint every time.  Usually when we were on the highway.<br/>
Eventually she was old enough to understand our reasons behind using them<br/>
and she often complied just because she knew it would make me happy but<br/>
there was a long period when she simply refused. I tried everything I could<br/>
think of plus all the ideas from unschoolers I knew - it was very<br/>
frustrating.  One thing that an unschooling Dad said that made sense was.&quot;<br/>
She has the right to refuse to wear them but I have the right to refuse to<br/>
drive the car with an unbelted passenger.  It isn&#39;t safe, it&#39;s against the<br/>
law and I won&#39;t risk it.&quot;  This approach, in the end was very effective but<br/>
unbelievably inconvenient for me and unfair to big brother and sis who<br/>
didn&#39;t wish to be house bound for months at a time.  Sometimes the choice<br/>
was, you can come with us if you stay belted but if not you can stay here<br/>
with dad or go visit a neighbor while we go out.  Sometimes I was able to<br/>
arrange rides for the other two.  Sometimes we just went anyway and crossed<br/>
our fingers. <br/>
	FWIW, Anika is the one who still always gets carsick on long trips<br/>
and who hated car rides even as an infant.<br/>
