<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105812722">My always unschooled daughters, ages 21 and 14, both had all four of their <br/>
wisdom teeth removed this past Wednesday. They&#39;ve been on a soft food diet <br/>
since, which has been challenging and frustrating for them. They made a shopping <br/>
list for me earlier in the week, and we&#39;ve also run out for stuff as they&#39;ve <br/>
thought of what sounded appealing.<br/>
<br/>
When I had teeth removed I ate a lot of mushy canned vegetables, but my girls <br/>
have grown up loving fresh and frozen veggies and think canned veggies are <br/>
just gross, so those didn&#39;t make it onto their food plans. They&#39;ve ended up <br/>
eating a lot of yogurt, pudding, canned fruit, bananas, mashed potatoes, some <br/>
mushy pastas, plain bread. Yesterday they started complaining that they were tired <br/>
tired tired of eating sweet stuff. Today they were able to handle chewing <br/>
scrambled eggs and omelettes which thrilled them.<br/>
