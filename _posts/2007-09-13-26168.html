 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t put it as &quot;completely by themselves&quot;. That<br/>
brings to my mind an image of leaving a child with<br/>
books and expecting them to read someday. I would<br/>
describe it as learning to read without being taught.<br/>
It includes help when asked for.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has learned to read without being taught.<br/>
She&#39;s not fluent yet, but close. We read to her since<br/>
she was little. She knew some of those little kid<br/>
books by heart. When she wanted to learn to read, she<br/>
picked up those books and tried to associate the words<br/>
she knew with the words on the paper. She didn&#39;t do a<br/>
whole lot of that. Mostly, she picked up comic books<br/>
and spent hours trying to read them, occasionally<br/>
asking us what this or that word was. She had no use<br/>
for any &quot;easy readers&quot; because she found them boring.<br/>
<br/>
My son did something similar when he wanted to learn<br/>
letters. First of all, he had no use for letters till<br/>
he could learn entire words - such as his name and his<br/>
sister&#39;s name. Then one day he asked me to put the<br/>
magnetic letters in order on the refrigerator.  Then<br/>
he sang the ABCD song many times while touching each<br/>
letter as he sang it. Once he was reasonably sure he<br/>
knew the letters, he stopped playing with them and has<br/>
not in anyway attempted to further his reading skills.<br/>
He&#39;ll do it when he has a need for it. <br/>
<br/>
We have always acted as though reading is easy and my<br/>
kids will learn it when they&#39;re developmentally ready.<br/>
This is in contrast to schools which make reading into<br/>
a difficult subject by pushing it down the kid&#39;s<br/>
throats when they&#39;re not ready. Also schools divide<br/>
reading into many small steps that are to be mastered<br/>
sequentially. But there was nothing linear and<br/>
sequential in the way my daughter learned to read. She<br/>
can read long words when they appear in context, in<br/>
something that interests her - like Yu Gi Oh cards and<br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll fumble on many of the &quot;100 sight<br/>
words&quot; if presented as a list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685262776">No child learns to read &quot;by themselves&quot; in a vacuum....but I didn&#39;t teach my<br/>
youngest to read.  I did however read to him a lot, provide lots of books,<br/>
pointed out words as they occurred in our everyday activities. As with most<br/>
kids, he wanted to know how to write his name. Then write his siblings<br/>
names. Sounds and letters and words are everywhere. I and his siblings were<br/>
always available to answer his questions. Soon he was reading. And<br/>
interestingly enough, the child I never &#39;taught&#39; to read learned to read at<br/>
a much earlier age than the older kids that I tried to teach to read (in our<br/>
pre-unschooling days).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446866368">Not sure if I&#39;m saying this well, but these examples look to me like<br/>
&quot;Connection Trumps Everything&quot; in action.  Pursuing the relationship is<br/>
key.  Reading (or math, or scuba diving, or whatever) flows naturally as the<br/>
child is ready, and as s/he chooses to pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also not something that comes intuitively to a lot of people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121278372">If a child is in an *enriched* environment, they will learn to read.   When <br/>
others babies are walking and talking, a baby learns to walk and  talk.  Human <br/>
beings have a strong, innate desire to be like the humans  around them.  If <br/>
you read to them, they will learn to read.  Quite  simple.  Just like as you <br/>
talk to them, they learn to talk.   Think for a minute how really, really <br/>
difficult talking is!!  It is  probably the most difficult thing that we will ever <br/>
learn, and we take it for  granted because we taught ourselves!  Think about the <br/>
syntax, grammar,  etc that I child learns; and never has to be told!!! <br/>
 <br/>
Many will memorize the words from the book, and then extrapolate that  <br/>
information to other readings.  By picking reading apart, and teaching them  <br/>
letters, phonics, etc; it can actually complicate the learning process.   Let nature <br/>
take its course, and be patient.  Some learn to read as early as  4, while <br/>
many boys are not ready until 8-12 years old.  I recommend  reading John Holt&#39;s <br/>
books.  When they do learn to read and write, you do  *not* even need to <br/>
correct them if they read or write a word wrong.  They  will self-correct, as they <br/>
learn to read more.  <br/>
 <br/>
There is also a book out, GNYS at WORK (genius at work), which is an  account <br/>
of a child learning to read and write all by himself.  <br/>

Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062239150">~~If they learn by themselves, why do we have adults<br/>
who are illiterate? ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find me an illiterate adult, and I&#39;ll show you a formerly schooled<br/>
person. Illiteracy happens because early on in the reading journey,<br/>
the child is taught that they aren&#39;t smart enough/good enough/capable<br/>
enough and they learn to hide the fact that they can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
Force and coercion shut down the natural learning process. Schools are<br/>
great at creating that damage. Illiteracy doesn&#39;t happen when one is<br/>
supported and nourished and allowed to learn at their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
My children didn&#39;t learn to read &quot;on their own&quot;, nor did anyone teach<br/>
them.  I read to them. I answered their questions. We have books,<br/>
video games, computers and other sources of written language<br/>
available. I&#39;ve had one learn to read (and I&#39;m talking fluent reading,<br/>
not the beginning stages) around 7 years, one around 8, one at 12 and<br/>
one is still not interested in the written word much at all at 6.5<br/>
years of age.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a pretty good idea at this point that my youngest WILL read<br/>
when he&#39;s good and ready after watching three other children do it.;)<br/>
I know that he&#39;s picking up cues from the written word and<br/>
assimilating it into his world, which will eventually become the<br/>
process of decoding language.<br/>
<br/>
Your children learned to walk and talk, they will learn to read. Trust<br/>
the process, make their lives interesting and joyful and it will all<br/>
happen in it&#39;s own time. Be available and connected and natural<br/>
learning will blossom.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think an important aspect that worried parents should realize is  <br/>
that handing a child a Leap Frog will not turn that child into a reader.<br/>
<br/>
What happened is the child was developmentally ready, was inherently  <br/>
curious about the information (probably because she was ready) and  <br/>
she pulled the information she needed and was curious about from the  <br/>
toy. She made connections because she was curious and ready.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much more helpful to see natural learning as children pulling in  <br/>
what piques their interest and satisfies some internal need rather  <br/>
than some outside agent pushing the information in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294581481">Good point, Ren. I have a good example of this. Rachel was four years  <br/>
old, and already sounding stuff out. When we sent her to preK, it  <br/>
took very little time for the teacher to realize that she loved  <br/>
reading and *could* be reading well. So they pushed it. They sent  <br/>
home notes to *me* to push it. I tried not to, but it&#39;s ubiquitous.  <br/>
By Thanksgiving, she was frustrated. Over the break, she finally  <br/>
looked at me and said &quot;Mom! You can&#39;t MAKE me learn to read!&quot; Ahhh.  <br/>

For those who are on the list and considering pulling kids from  <br/>

when he said the kids should get &#39;closure&#39;. What they needed was to  <br/>
be honored and pulled out as soon as my thick head understood that it  <br/>
needed done. There is no reason to wait...and you likely will regret  <br/>
it, because every day was another WEEK of deschooling needed to find  <br/>
their true selves. Josh and Bre were in for five years, Emily two and  <br/>
Rachel one. I&#39;m still kicking myself for not pulling them out before  <br/>
we did. I think that pulling them out in the middle of the year may  <br/>
help the process, because they see that you are taking their souls  <br/>
seriously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436195791">When my son was about 4.5 years old, I bought him some &quot;Bob&quot; books-<br/>
  a small box of books with easy, small-word &quot;stories&quot;.<br/>
  I thought they were great, and so did he- for a while.<br/>
  He started sounding out some of the words and I was so excited he was reading,<br/>
  then suddenly, he lost interest completely.<br/>
  So, we stopped looking at the books for months.<br/>
  When I started noticing he was interested again, I bought the next box of books<br/>
  with more interesting &quot;stories&quot; in it, but didn&#39;t make a big deal about them,<br/>
  and he started reading them so quickly!<br/>
   <br/>
  Melissa, I feel your pain. I wish I had never sent my son to public school in the first<br/>
  place. I took him out half way through 4th grade- much too late, I think.<br/>
  My husband also wanted him to finish out the school year, saying that he didn&#39;t want<br/>
  our son to think he could just &quot;give up&quot; when things weren&#39;t going the way he wanted them to go....<br/>
  But we had just come home from a homeschooling conference, and I knew before we went that I&#39;d be excited to start right away when we came home. Sure enough, I was, and although my husband was not on board, I took my son out of school. We had a few arguments about it after that, and for a while I wasn&#39;t sure I did the right thing.<br/>
  But thinking of my son sitting in that classroom for even another day assured me I did what was best.<br/>
  He still got his yearbook at the end of the school year, and his teacher even allowed him to come to class and have it signed by the students- I went with him.<br/>
  He still plays with a few of the boys from school, but we&#39;re part of a couple groups near us, so he has access to other &#39;unschoolers&#39;.<br/>
  I know the feeling of kicking yourself over not taking them out sooner, but it&#39;s great to just concentrate on how nice it is that you don&#39;t have to go back, and maybe even make up for lost time by doing all the things you would&#39;ve done with them had they been home from the start.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to address this bc I have a child who doesn&#39;t really enjoy <br/>
being read to for the most part - this is Mo, my kid with the &quot;words <br/>
limit&quot;. Especially when she was younger, she didn&#39;t want to hear too <br/>
many words at a time, and that included being read to. So I rarely <br/>
read to her, and more often than not, I&#39;m reading instructions, not <br/>
stories. And yet she was one of those kids who was reading early.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the &quot;enriched environment&quot; thing comes in - there&#39;s <br/>
print *everywhere* in our world. Not just books, there are signs, <br/>
packaged food, the computer, the tv, the contents of my purse, many <br/>
many toys and tools, automobiles, clocks and watches, home <br/>
appliances, clothing.... We have a pretty darn print-rich culture. <br/>
That&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t have to do anything at all to help our <br/>
kids out - they do rely on us for information about the world after <br/>
all - just that we often don&#39;t have to go out of our way to about <br/>
the &quot;environment&quot; per se. <br/>
<br/>
Working toward having a rich *relationship* with children goes a <br/>
long long way toward providing them with what they need. After all, <br/>
if I&#39;m striving to have a rich relationship with my kid, I&#39;m going <br/>
to be trying to be sensitive to his/her needs and interests and <br/>
wishes and feelings *and* seeking to help him/her find the tools <br/>
s/he requires to meet those, right? It&#39;s not so much that the <br/>
relationship *trumps* everything, as Rob said (although I love that <br/>
phrase), as that working on the relationship *informs* everything <br/>
else. <br/>

do with Human nature - and gosh, we humans can be pretty variable in <br/>
some ways.<br/>

and reading books. First of all, I&#39;ve known lots of people who read  <br/>
aloud to their kids while their kids played with legos or dolls or  <br/>
did other things like brushed their teeth, etc. And I&#39;d include  <br/>
listening to cd&#39;s in the car as being &quot;read to.&quot; But, it also means  <br/>
being willing to read stuff on the screen for a child playing video  <br/>
games. It means reading captions on comic strips. It means reading  <br/>
signs. At the L&L conference I was talking to a mom (Hi Dawn) with a  <br/>
couple of little kids who were playing Pokemon on the floor near us.  <br/>
We&#39;d pause our conversation for a few seconds every so often while  <br/>
she read cards to them. I loved the way they looked so hard at the  <br/>
cards, screwing up their foreheads, then they&#39;d say, &quot;Mom, what does  <br/>
this say?&quot; She&#39;d tell them what it said and they&#39;d scrunch up their  <br/>
faces again, looking at it carefully, and then very excitedly go back  <br/>
to playing. It was very cool to watch. That kind of reading to kids  <br/>
(or maybe &quot;reading for&quot; is a better term) is very very significant  <br/>
because that&#39;s what they want to know how to read. Lots different  <br/>
from when I was a kid and we were expected to be thrilled with  <br/>
learning to read, &quot;See Dick. See Dick run. Look Jane. See Dick run.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178280418">I would like to clarify my last post on reading. I did not just hand my<br/>
daughter an outside agent to teach her to read.( I am a child of a 30 year<br/>
public school teacher.My mother is the person who told me NOT to school  my<br/>
daughter  when it came time,but i wanted to give her the best of the public<br/>
school system and it failed her. If my mother was here(alive) she would<br/>
WHOLE heartily agree that UN-schooling is the best for her and us). We have<br/>
been reading to my daughter from the time i found out i was pregnant until<br/>
she was ready to learn on her own, not only did  she use the Leap Pad system<br/>
she also use library books as well the old classics ( Dick and Jane,<br/>
Ferdinand the bull as well as others). She knew sight words then she wanted<br/>
to learn more. I am not saying my child is perfect by any means. But she was<br/>
ready to learn on her own in her own time. I was on the sidelines listening<br/>
and ready to answer any questions she had and still has.<br/>
This is what my daughter wanted to know and learn from me. Our UN-teaching<br/>
works best for us. You will have to wait and watch for your child to make<br/>
and take steps to read and do other things  in their lives.<br/>
Just sit or stand back and take the clues from your child(ren). No one<br/>
method is correct for all.<br/>

the ability to learn. The only thing that can shut that ability down,<br/>
is force and coercion (barring any true physical or mental damage).<br/>
<br/>
Nobody needs to teach a child to walk or talk or think or learn. They<br/>
WANT to do that. They&#39;re programmed to do that. We can model curiosity<br/>
and excitement and peaceful problem solving, but I don&#39;t think we need<br/>

    Spot on!  What I should have said is that I don&#39;t stand in the way<br/>

to the library and check out 25 books about it and go on and on like<br/>
they need me to push them to learn something!    I see myself as a<br/>

I apologize if this question has been asked already.  How do children <br/>
actually<br/>
learn to read completely by themselves.  If they learn by themselves, <br/>
why do we have adults<br/>

<br/>
Some children IN school don&#39;t learn to read. Unschooled children learn <br/>
just fine.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that unschooled children don&#39;t learn to read <br/>
&quot;completely by themselves.&quot; *We* are there to answer their questions. <br/>
We supply tons of books and magazines and magnetic letters and games <br/>
and computers and ...whatever we can find that has letter and words. We <br/>
read for them. We read to them. We listen as they read to us. We play <br/>
with words and letters. We sing songs and make up poetry. We solve <br/>
riddles. We joke. We play with words---words are not to be feared.<br/>
<br/>
Schools choose to try to teach thirty children in the same way. Those <br/>
who can already read or who are ready to read are ushered on as <br/>
&quot;readers.&quot; The rest are left struggling, thinking they are stupid and <br/>
are forever non-readers. They grow up like that. Because they&#39;ve been <br/>
labeled. So they become adult non-readers---but then they&#39;re called <br/>
illiterate. They&#39;re afraid of words.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see this the first time, I still haven&#39;t completely caught up after <br/>
having returned from the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I have two children who are both coming to terms in their own way <br/>
with reading. Simon, who is 10, isn&#39;t quite reading yet. Or, at least, not <br/>
at a point where he could read a whole book on his own, although he has read <br/>
a few Asterix and Obelix comics on his own (he says that some of the longer <br/>
words he just skips over, and with Goscinny&#39;s sense of humor there are a <br/>
quite a few long names). Linnaea, who is 7, has been reading fluently for <br/>
maybe 8 months, maybe 10. When she started reading there really wasn&#39;t any <br/>
obvious run up to reading. She was ready and she was interested and she <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that if Simon applied himself, he would be reading, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think that anymore. I don&#39;t think it is a lack of intention, I think <br/>
it is a lack of readiness. I&#39;m not saying this because Linnaea&#39;s reading is <br/>
somehow evidence that I am creating an environment rich with reading <br/>
opportunities. I am more saying that because his approach to reading is so <br/>
completely different from Linnaea&#39;s. It is an almost methodical approach. We <br/>
were in the car with my mom a couple of weeks ago and Simon and Linnaea were <br/>
trying to spell words. Simon was either absolutely nailing spellings or a <br/>
vowel off. So black was blck sort of thing. Linnaea was miles away. She&#39;d <br/>
start a word and then go wandering off letter by letter, until she was so <br/>
far away from what she was trying to spell that there was no way I could <br/>
guess what she was attempting. There is, for her, at this point (or at the <br/>
point 4 weeks ago) a disconnect between what she sees on the page and what <br/>
she can see in her head.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is any way that I could make Simon read. And if there <br/>
was, if by sitting him down and making him do worksheets and work on <br/>
flashcards I could make him read,  at the end of that process Simon would <br/>
know that reading was hard and ardous and that he was kind of stupid when it <br/>
came to reading, and probably wouldn&#39;t really want to read. But right now, <br/>
not being a fluent reader, he knows that his relationship with words is his <br/>
own. He knows that Linnaea may be reading now but he will be reading <br/>
someday. He doesn&#39;t have any doubts. I keep thinking he will, I keep <br/>
thinking the fact that many of his friends read will distress him, and it <br/>
absolutely never does.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess, what I would tell your friends and family who are sure that not <br/>
being taught to read means that you end up with illiterate adults is to <br/>
first ask how many of those illiterate adults went to school. I mean if not <br/>
being taught to read means you end up illiterate, surely being taught to <br/>
read makes you literate, right? Given an interesting, engaging environment <br/>
that has reading as an aspect in it (and reading is an active part of much <br/>
of our lives--video games, television, books, magazines, comics, road signs, <br/>
grocery stores, typewriters, computers, the internet, game cheat codes, and <br/>
so on) children will want to solve the puzzle, and when they are <br/>
developmentally ready, they will solve that puzzle. Giving them a piece at a <br/>
time, slowly prepping them for the day they are supposed to read will only <br/>
work if the day they are supposed to read coincides with the day that person <br/>
is ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is too much to say, maybe that is for a deep conversation. Maybe <br/>
you&#39;d be better off just saying they are doing a lot of pre-reading work. <br/>
Also make sure you tell your friends and family, that they aren&#39;t doing it <br/>
alone. They are doing it with you and with each other, that it is just part <br/>
of growing and developing. And you aren&#39;t asking them to do it in a vacuum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925793145">My two older children learned to read pretty easily (a little later<br/>
for my oldest but once she got it she got it)  my 12 yr old who has<br/>
some challenges learned to read very slowly bit by bit in a way that<br/>
made sense to her brain.   Because each time I somehow missed the<br/>
&quot;pivotal&quot; moment ... that&#39;s assuming it&#39;s something you can SEE<br/>
happen!   I was determined with my 4th child that I was going to watch<br/>
closely!   Each of my kids have started off with a love a books, been<br/>
read to constantly etc... each reach a point in their individual<br/>
development where they would ask how to spell something or what does<br/>
this word say or write something and want me to tell them what it says<br/>
... this past week my 6 yr old was writing words like &quot;balooky&quot;  which<br/>
once he heard pronounced he thought hilarious!   From there he said<br/>
&quot;oh balooky rhymes with lacooky&quot;   and off he went writing lots of<br/>
&quot;nonsense&quot; words that rhymed.  They don&#39;t have to be real words to get<br/>
the idea of rhyming and sounds like this and that... Dr. Seuss made<br/>
quite a nice living of doing just that.   I think like everything else<br/>
they explore it when they are ready and on their own terms ....they<br/>
ask us for help when they need it.  I hate nothing more than to see a<br/>
child ask a parent what a word is and they get this whole long ...<br/>
well sound it out what does this letter say and what does this letter<br/>
say now put it together ...meanwhile the kid is in tears and just<br/>
wanted to know what the word was he didn&#39;t ask for a lecture or a<br/>
lesson on what letters say!   To me that&#39;s just showing them how<br/>
&quot;hard&quot; reading is and killing the desire!  It&#39;s different if the kid<br/>
wants to know what this letter says or that letter says or wants help<br/>
sounding out.  If my kids ask what a word is I tell them...usually the<br/>
next time they encounter it they know the word!  <br/>
We have lots of things that the kids can handle as well... a moveable<br/>
alphabet, lots of Montessori objects and word cards, the pink, blue<br/>
and green word matching cards and such as that.  They love to pull<br/>
those out and spell out the objects with the alphabet letters because<br/>
it&#39;s fun... they haven&#39;t been drilled on it because that is NOT fun! <br/>
   Mostly they see us read magazines, books, games, cards etc and are<br/>
immersed in a print rich environment.   My kids love books and will<br/>
ask for a book if given their choice of getting something in any<br/>
store.   One relishes a reference book like no one else on earth..it<br/>
used to bother me that she didn&#39;t enjoy fiction.... I just didn&#39;t call<br/>
it reading if she was poring over reference books... I enjoy fiction<br/>
and thought she was missing out!   I had to let go of that perception<br/>
and alot of perceptions along the way like everyone else!  <br/>
To me seeing my kids read for the first time is just as exciting as<br/>
those first wobbly steps! <br/>
