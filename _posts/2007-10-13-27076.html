<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633307228">I have two children who are 10 and 7 and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said any of what she says in a very long, long time. Like years long time. At least not as anything other than a joke.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to threaten or coerce or really even coax them to do things, but I don&#39;t know if that is because they do those things on their own as much as it is because I don&#39;t have any expectation of what they ought to be doing. I will remind them to brush their teeth, but I don&#39;t make them brush their teeth. If we need to get up early to do something in the morning I will mention it the night before and wake them up, if I need to, in the morning and help them to get ready by fetching clothes and making sure there is food for in the car and that they have everything they need for whatever it is we are getting to at such an early hour. <br/>
<br/>
If I ask Linnaea (7) do to something, like get something for me, or put something in the trash, or anything she&#39;ll often say yes. Simon (10) is more likely to say yes and always has been. But recently I have only occasionally had Linnaea tell me no to a request. If and when she says no I don&#39;t get mad, I just do it myself. I truly was asking her to do something, not telling her. I think, really believe, that the yesses come from the fact that she wants to give to me. I give so freely, so happily of myself, I help when they want help, I work hard to try and say yes as much as possible, and she loves that, she appreciates that, she likes the way it feels and she wants to return that. And, more than that, she trusts me. She trusts me to not misuse her, or take advantage of the relationship or stress that something is important when it isn&#39;t. She trusts that the information I give her is good, is true information. She trusts that a big part of my life is<br/>
 made of trying to bring joy to her life. But that trust didn&#39;t come overnight. It took time and work and truly changing my expectations of what our relationship was and what her obligations to that relationship were.<br/>
<br/>
They both also trust each other. Because they don&#39;t have to be nice to each other, they don&#39;t have to get along (I will work to make sure that when things are bad between them that they don&#39;t have to hang out), they have had the time to figure out how they enjoy to be with each other. Today we went on a walk, Simon initiated it, about halfway into it Linnaea started to feel ill. Her stomach was cramping and her new boots were giving her blisters (she and I had both forgotten to grab socks). I said let&#39;s go home, and Simon, who wanted to walk more and longer, never once did anything but help his sister get back to the car. When we were in the car he worked really hard to get her cold (she was feeling hot) and to keep the dog from panting on her. It was amazing to see this moment of his generousity in action. <br/>
<br/>
You may want to think about what your expectations are. Why do they need to clean their plates? Why do they have to sit at the table to eat and when they do why do they have to have polite manners? If they dress inappropriately for the weather can you bring extra clothes so that they can change if they get too cold or too hot? If you want a happy, comfortable relationship with your kids you have take some of the burden of making their lives easier and more comfortable. Every time you think of something that they ought to be doing, not having their elbows on the table, think about why that is important in that minute, how does that really impact your life, and is it worth having an elbowless table to nag them to follow someone else&#39;s rules of ettiquette?<br/>
<br/>
The amazing thing about unschooling, about this life that I live with Simon and Linnaea, is how much affirmation it contains. They seek me out to share funny things they find on-line, or shows they know I like on television. Linnaea called me from the beach last week to just say hello and tell me what a good time she was having and to thank me for packing her some food. If I have a bad moment, a bad response, they accept my apology. They are generous and kind and patient and interesting and so much fun to be around. I cannot imagine defining my day by a litany of demands, impatience, unhappiness and tension. The video made me sad, made me feel bad for the women as they stood and applauded, and for the children they would go home to feeling justified in the universality of how difficult it is to be a mother (whose work is never done). <br/>

I find this video hilarious because it does remind me of my life. While<br/>
I have never said all these phrases in one day, I&#39;ve certainly used many<br/>
of them.  My tween no longer gets up without my wake up call, as she<br/>
used to when she was younger.  Like many teens, her body naturally wants<br/>
to keep her awake at night and asleep in the morning.  However, she has<br/>
to wake up at 8am, not 11am, to fulfill her commitments.  My son doesn&#39;t<br/>
brush his teeth without my reminder.<br/>
<br/>
I often have to teach and remind my kids to wake up, dress appropriately<br/>
for the weather, clean up, eat the food on the plate, use decent table<br/>
manners, be fair to others, treat their siblings well, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really surprised to find that there are moms who never have to teach<br/>
and remind their kids to do any of these things.  I would love to learn<br/>
how to get the kids to do these things without my coaxing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058949160">It&#39;s probably obvious that I am new to the whole philosophy of<br/>
unschooling.  In fact, one of my children attends private school while I<br/>
homeschool the other.  I love the idea of the  beautiful family<br/>
relationship that you describe, but you&#39;re also right to point out that<br/>
a lot depends on our expectations.  I don&#39;t feel like I can relax about<br/>
everything, all the time.  For example, I really don&#39;t care whether we<br/>
share regular family meals.  However, it&#39;s important to my husband that<br/>
we gather to eat together at least once or twice a week.  We rarely<br/>
remind our children about proper table manners, but table etiquette was<br/>
something that we addressed when they were younger because it was very<br/>
important to my Czech mother-in-law (especially when we were travelling<br/>
in Europe.)  Now, we just hope that food will not be used as fodder for<br/>
catapults (or any of the other fun, creative ideas that my children have<br/>
tried at the table in the past.)<br/>
<br/>
Somehow my 11-year-old daughter & 8-year-old son  do usually treat each<br/>
other well.  They never admit that they love each other, but I see<br/>
evidence of that in their daily actions.  Right now, they are outside<br/>
playing together  in the autumn leaves.  However, a day rarely passes<br/>
where there isn&#39;t some perceived egregious action that seems to require<br/>
my arbitration skills and a reminder (as in the Mom Video) to &#39;work it<br/>
out.&quot;  I do think that encouraging them to see things from the other&#39;s<br/>
perspective or to consider how an action could have hurt the other&#39;s<br/>
feelings, has had a positive impact on their relationship.  hmm... I<br/>
guess this goes back to our expectations.  My parents never noticed that<br/>
my brother & I fought all the time, and I guess I want my kids to have a<br/>
more loving relationship than that.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do you deal with sibling arguments?  Do your ever kids argue or<br/>
fight? If so, do they come to you for help in settling the disagreement?<br/>
You say that &quot;they don&#39;t have to be nice to each other, they don&#39;t have<br/>
to get along.&quot;  What does this mean?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra Living By Learning<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do a certain amount of prevention - noticing when one kid needs <br/>
space or quiet, for example and working to find other places or <br/>
quieter activities for the other kid. No, they don&#39;t &quot;have to get <br/>
along&quot; all the time - but the alternative to that doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
fighting, it can be me or George taking one kid for a walk or a trip <br/>
to the store or finding a fun movie to watch or offering to do a <br/>
project. <br/>
<br/>
When the prevention thing doesn&#39;t happen, I work to help them find <br/>
mutually acceptible solutions to whatever the problem. Many times <br/>
the problem is a communication breakdown, so I do <br/>
some &quot;translating&quot; - &quot;oh, he didn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t ever play on the <br/>
computer, he meant you can have it when he&#39;s done&quot;. Other times its <br/>
a matter of two people wanting to use the same very small space for <br/>
different activities, so I work to find other options - different <br/>
rooms, different activities, a trip to the store (my emergency back-<br/>
up plan for so many things!). They may need help prioritizing or, as <br/>
you said, seeing another perspective. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a reminder (as in the Mom Video) to &#39;work it out.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That one always gets me - how the heck are kids supposed to work it <br/>
out if they don&#39;t get to see some modelling? What does &quot;working it <br/>
out&quot; even look like? With little adult support it often looks like a <br/>
bigger kid getting his or her way as a result of being bigger, or a <br/>
smaller kid whining or throwing a tantrum until an adult yells at <br/>
the bigger kid. <br/>
<br/>
Actually working things out takes a bit of practice - for adults <br/>
too! I find it helpful to keep in mind that everyone&#39;s needs are <br/>
important and validate those needs. Its not always possible to find <br/>
the perfect solution in this exact moment, but everyone&#39;s needs are <br/>
still important - including the need for a sympathetic ear or <br/>
shoulder when things don&#39;t work out just right. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the places unschooling departs from conventional <br/>
parenting, btw - in conventional parenting the idea that &quot;we can&#39;t <br/>
always get what we want&quot; is used as a sort of solution. Its an end-<br/>
point, anyway. You want what? well, you can&#39;t always get what you <br/>
want. Bleh. In whole life unschooling its a starting point. Its not <br/>
always possible to get exactly what you want in this exact moment, <br/>
so how can we make it better? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218060837">So, how do you deal with sibling arguments?  Do your ever kids argue or<br/>

<br/>
--------------<br/>
 <br/>
I lived with my brother for 13 years, for 26 years we haven&#39;t shared a house. I don&#39;t have a very close relationship with him. I don&#39;t talk to him very often and I see him maybe once every 2 years. I have no sense of what my children&#39;s adult relationship with each other will be. But I know that mine, in which as a child I was told to work it out and get along, didn&#39;t foster a warm and close relationship. I cannot produce a friendship, a closeness in my children and as such I don&#39;t see it as a necessary part of their lives. Thus, they don&#39;t have to be nice to each other, they don&#39;t have to get along. It is my job to keep both of them safe and comfortable, but it isn&#39;t possible for me to make them like each other. <br/>
 <br/>
David and I chose, actively, long discussions, chose to have a second child. Simon may have accidentally, joyfully, become a part of my life, but the sibling that I foisted upon him was my and David&#39;s doing. And because of that I recognize that David and I are the mediators of their relationship. So if things are going well, I need to help them to continue to go well. I need to make sure that hunger or sleepiness or thirst or whatever doesn&#39;t help things to spiral down into a bad scene, an awful moment. It helps to have things to do that interest both of them so if one thing, like the television, is being sought by both I can offer something to do that will appeal to one of them. Or find a way for both of their needs to be met. And the more that I help them to work through their difficult moments, the better they get at working through them when I don&#39;t get there in time. It also helps if I am present with them. If I can hear them playing together,<br/>
 hanging out. I can usually hear when things are beginning to get tense. If I can step in before things get too tense than I can help to stop the tension from growing. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an incredibly hands on approach; you&#39;ve got to be there, you&#39;ve got to listen and pay attention. And it takes time, it takes dedication. But it gives such joy. I love hearing Simon and Linnaea playing Sly Cooper and his band of thieves on the PS2 and making deals and working out who can play which and how they want each to work. And I truly think not making them responsible for the peace in our house make it easier for them to enjoy the peace and keep it going. <br/>
