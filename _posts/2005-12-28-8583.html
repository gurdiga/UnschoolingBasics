<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828216032">&quot;We are all in agreement that we will rotate from house to house <br/>
each week. I<br/>
would like your input before we meet this Friday so that I can make <br/>
sure that we<br/>
have some things to think about to make this a success on the front <br/>
end.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have the core idea layed out, I&#39;m sure it will <br/>
build from there. I can only tell you what worked really well for <br/>
me, each group operates in a unique way, but here&#39;s what we did:<br/>
<br/>
Initiallly, when we had a few unschooling families interested in <br/>
getting together regularly, we would meet at the park. We decided <br/>
something weekly would be nice, so I looked around for a rec center <br/>
and fortunately, the park we&#39;d been meeting at was happy to have us <br/>
use their rec center each week.<br/>
<br/>
This opened up all sorts of possibilities, because we now had a <br/>
building. There was a large gym, and a couple of side rooms for <br/>
gaming or crafts or??<br/>
We labeled the group clearly as NON-religious. We had quite a <br/>
diverse group over the years, religiously speaking...christians, <br/>
pagans, atheists, jews, catholic etc... It was really nice.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone was unschoolers, but most everyone was very relaxed and <br/>
leaned towards AP parenting styles. Anyone really uptight and <br/>
religious did not fit in well at all, and usually did not come back <br/>
for a second visit. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to check out the group I started in P&#39;cola, you can read <br/>
about them at the yahoo group Pensacolaunschoolers.  We had a lot of <br/>
fun over the years. Activities were sometimes planned, but anyone <br/>
could choose to get involved or not...there was always a basketball <br/>
and the park for anyone not wanting to do whatever was going on.<br/>
<br/>
We had a medieval themed day, a huge &quot;Fun-fest&quot; with all sorts of <br/>
vendors (not selling, just sharing a passion) from beekeepers, to <br/>
pigeon racers, museums etc..., we baked bread in a bag and made ice <br/>
cream, we painted ceramics and for the most part, we hung out and <br/>
made new friends.<br/>
<br/>
It drove the schoolish types crazy that we didn&#39;t have any schedule <br/>
or &quot;structure&quot; other than the day we met....they wanted us to offer <br/>
classes and such. It was amusing.  Starting that group was one of <br/>
the best things I ever did, we made lifelong friends there.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes on your adventure. Just get a clear vision of the type <br/>
of group you want it to be, write that up and then there won&#39;t be <br/>
any confusion when folks want to participate. <br/>
