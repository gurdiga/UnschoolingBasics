<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083504771">This will be the last Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, as I am <br/>
choosing to spend my time with my family doing other things. I will be <br/>
sorry to see it go, since it has be the catalyst for so many <br/>
friendships for all of us. But we all move on, and it’s time to let <br/>
others take up the crusade! We now have several similar conferences all <br/>
over the US and Canada. GO to them! &lt;g&gt; These conferences change lives!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re delighted to once more be in the beautiful mountains of North <br/>
Carolina near Asheville, September 3-7, 2008. Again we will be taking <br/>
over the mountain at the beautiful, majestic YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly, <br/>
a full-service conference center situated on 1200 acres of woodland <br/>
beautified by mountain streams, wildflowers, ridges, valleys and <br/>
spectacular views.<br/>
<br/>
Our speaker panel includes Anne Ohman, shining star of her <br/>
SHINEWithUnschooling e-list; Scott Noelle, host of the popular and <br/>
inspirational Daily Groove; James Coburn, wired for sound as well as <br/>
anything you can plug into him!; Ronnie Maier, better known and loved <br/>
as “dragonfly” on the message boards and e-lists; and young adults, <br/>
Brenna McBroom and Cameron Lovejoy, both fixtures of the Live and Learn <br/>
Conference and poster children for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We’re looking forward to the Funshops and Roundtable Talks that you all <br/>
will come up with. The dads and teens will have their open panels, and <br/>
we’d like to have a few children take the leap to speak before the <br/>
group as well. Grandparents receive free registration and are warmly <br/>
welcomed at Live and Learn, so we hope to see even more opportunities <br/>
for grandparents to share of themselves!<br/>
<br/>
We will have several new events and activities this year. Old favorites <br/>
like the talent show and the picnic will continue. But you will be <br/>
WOWed by the concert given by AMY STEINBERG on Wednesday evening. And <br/>
pack your costumes because we will be hosting a Masquerade Ball on <br/>
Saturday night! Please see the Special Events page for details as they <br/>
are added.<br/>
<br/>
Lodging will be similar to last year’s set up, you will be booking all <br/>
hotel and lodge rooms through us as part of your registration. Please <br/>
spend some time on the Blue Ridge Assembly site thinking about which <br/>
type of space you would like. The rooms will be available on a first <br/>
come - first served basis.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you&#39;ll decide to join us! This is a wonderful opportunity to <br/>
spend time relaxing in a beautiful area of the country while recharging <br/>
your Unschooling batteries, reconnecting with old friends, meeting <br/>
virtual friends, and  being inspired as well as inspiring others!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to see all the familiar faces and meet some new ones!<br/>
<br/>
Sooo…I am pleased to announce that the 2008 Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
Conference Website and Shop are now officially open!<br/>
