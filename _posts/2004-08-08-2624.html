<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093014051">&quot;I love this conversation and I&#39;ll chime in here....in regards to the smoking<br/>
issue. No, I would not allow my kids to smoke in the house or my vehical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s about setting personal boundaries, not wanting to smoke yourself. If a smoker lights up in a room with non-smokers, they&#39;re basically forcing the non-smokers to smoke. Yuck for me. So in my own home, in my own car, I have the right to ask people to refrain for my sake.<br/>
But if I go to a smokers house, I don&#39;t have that same right, though they may refrain out of courtesy to me anyway....it depends. I can choose not to go where there is smoke if it&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t give or not give my kids permission. They certainly know the risks of smoking and have zero desire at this point to do anything harmful to their bodies. I think unschooling has allowed them to develop their own preferences without a bunch of peer pressure (which the example of three smokers was not about) which will help them make better decisions for themselves.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a child asking permission to smoke and the parents just saying &quot;ok&quot;. That&#39;s not at all the kind of freedom we&#39;re talking about at this list. There&#39;s a lot more give and take of information going on in unschooling homes that I know.<br/>
I very easily recognize that if my child chooses to do something like that, my permission or lack thereof will have no affect on their ability to do the thing anyway. They don&#39;t need my permission, but fortunately they DO value my advice. I&#39;ve proven myself trustworthy and they ask me very private and personal things because of that.<br/>
