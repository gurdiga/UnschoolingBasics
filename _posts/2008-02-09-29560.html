<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540640145">Yesterday a situation came up with my oldest that has me concerned.  I<br/>
am not sure what he&#39;s thinking.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the bank to get money deposited, etc.  DS has a check every<br/>
month for him to spend money on.  He pays rent and has money left for<br/>
what he wants.  It is quite some change.  At the bank I reminded him<br/>
of the rent and the money he owed for the toy I got for him because he<br/>
could not wait.  (Lego Mars Mission set)  He was upset (I would be too<br/>
if I didn&#39;t understand how money shrinks), but he paid the amounts<br/>
needed. He went over to the back of the room and played with the table<br/>
set toys for kids.  I was ready to go because one twin was hungry and<br/>
wanted to eat.  A gentle reminder to all... then I was left waiting at<br/>
the door with one twin.  I went back again to remind him and the other<br/>
twin, but DS stayed while the rest of us stood at the door.  We<br/>
FINALLY got to the van but DS lagged back, pushing at the handicapped<br/>
door button.  I went back once again but he refused to look at me or<br/>
stop pushing at the button.  I had to push him away gently to look at<br/>
me (remember we depend on eye contact to sign and communicate) and get<br/>
him to stop pushing the button.  He kept coming back at it before<br/>
running to the van.  I explained when he finally looked at me  that<br/>
the button is for people who are in a wheelchair or have crutches.  If<br/>
kids play with it all the time they might take out that button or put<br/>
up an ugly sign that says Parents, please do not allow your children<br/>
to play with the HC button...<br/>
<br/>
DS can be intense sometimes.  He has an acute sense of unfairness to<br/>
himself, never mind how &quot;fair&quot; others are being.  He can stomp off if<br/>
he doesn&#39;t get what he wants right now.  I am understanding (or trying<br/>
to in my n00b stage) but when he&#39;s got his brothers in a headlock or<br/>
when his younger twin brothers are stomping around and pouting like<br/>
him, I&#39;m worried.<br/>
<br/>
For the aforementioned situation, I made quite some mistakes.  I<br/>
should have not loaned him the money in the first place, instead have<br/>
worked out him going to get a gift card that he could use to spend<br/>
online on what he wanted with his allowance.  I am not sure what to do<br/>
when he gets into intense mode.  With the stomping and pouting, I<br/>
ignore him (I have given him hugs in the past but it seemed to make<br/>
the episodes worse and plus I put myself in danger of being hit.).<br/>
But when he refuses to stop something like push the handicapped door<br/>
button or leave the TV remote alone when it&#39;s time to go, I&#39;m afraid<br/>
it might lead to bigger things like refusing to stop putting his<br/>
brother in a headlock or something.  I do physically separate them<br/>
when needed.  What am I missing in my thinking?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73342267">I don&#39;t know about the rent, but as for lending my daughter money, in<br/>
my situation, my daughter always wanted everything she saw in the<br/>
store. Sometimes I needed to go to the store when she was with me. She<br/>
would go into a practically suicidal state to have to live with us not<br/>
buying her every single thing that appealed to her. I understand. It<br/>
is difficult for children to see things and not be able to touch them,<br/>
have them, at least for a while. So I started giving her allowance- I<br/>
don&#39;t remember, maybe it was dollars equal to her age in years (ie 7<br/>
years old= $7) per week or month- that would be the money that could<br/>
be spent on her desires, and it was hers. And it worked, but if she<br/>
wanted something more expensive than her stash of $$ allowed, it did<br/>
not work for me to buy it for her and then have her reimburse me. For<br/>
some reason it did work to buy it and save it until she could pay for it. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m rambling, so I will stop now  : )<br/>

Adrean, don&#39;t you think there is plenty of time, in the future, for  <br/>
him to learn about paying rent and about taking out loans and all that  <br/>
stuff? He&#39;s so young that what you&#39;re doing, really, is sort of the  <br/>
equivalent of holding out a delicious cookie and waiting for him to  <br/>
reach for it and then snatching it back and eating it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Let him be a kid, support his interests, provide a stimulating  <br/>
environment, and he will learn what is appropriate for himself at this  <br/>
age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678831848">Dear Pam and others:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  But perhaps I can offer another<br/>
perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
Adrean is my wife, and her three boys are also my boys, but we currently<br/>
live in different states.  The boys get a check each month, thanks to my<br/>
being on SSDI.  It is automatic &quot;child support.&quot;  While Adrean could be<br/>
taking full control of the boys&#39; checks, she is giving them the opportunity<br/>
to handle their respective checks.  She does really need part of that money<br/>
to cover rent, while using her own limited income for everything else.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been enjoying discussions of truth-telling as opposed to what is<br/>
really lying.  I may be wrong, but by Adrean&#39;s arrangement, she is<br/>
practicing higher transparency with the boys than she would be if she<br/>
deposited all of the money herself and handled it all herself, took the<br/>
needed portions from the boys&#39; checks without their knowing or something<br/>
like that.  Wouldn&#39;t that be worse?<br/>
<br/>
Just another angle to look at this situation.  By the way, I appreciate<br/>
learning a lot from you all on this list!  I look forward to practicing what<br/>
I have learned should we have the opportunity to live together again!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That does make sense, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling a lot on what to let the kids handle and what to expect<br/>
of them right now. Being a resource to the kids is much better if the<br/>
resource isn&#39;t the same thing hindering them from growing.  I most<br/>
certainly need work in that area.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking today about &quot;Because I said so.&quot;  Thought it would be<br/>
better to have my kid tell a playmate, &quot;We can&#39;t do this because we<br/>
don&#39;t have the money for the wood yet, let&#39;s do....&quot; instead of, &quot;We<br/>
can&#39;t do this because Momma says so.&quot;  I can remember a lot of<br/>
projects I imagined doing when a kid but feeling frustrated and angry<br/>
because I didn&#39;t have the means and my ideas kept being dismissed as<br/>
childish by adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712387680">I think you may be accomplishing them hating bills so much they will <br/>
not be willing to pay them as adults because they do not HAVE to any <br/>
more. See they had to pay bills growing up and it took out of their <br/>
spending money and that is no fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be more benefical to give them so much of whatever <br/>
is left over- then it is free and clear. Do the expenses even if it <br/>
is still the same amount of money and not make them pay for stuff- <br/>
unless they truly have a choice to say - no bills this month I want <br/>
toys- then how is it helping them. <br/>
<br/>
I see what you are trying to do but clearly the child is not <br/>
handling it well and it may need to be adjusted. <br/>
