<div id="ygrps-yiv-265224461">We have two girls- 7 and 4. About once every 5 or 6 weeks grandma (my<br/>
husbands mom) call and asks to have the girls for a few days. It is<br/>
normally for 2 or 3 days but one time it was for 5 days. My oldest<br/>
daughter is having a hard time staying at grandmas for any length of<br/>
time. This last time we dropped her off in the morning and I hung out<br/>
at my MIL&#39;s for a bit- went to a doctors appt- came back for an hour<br/>
or two then left to pick up my hubby so we could go to dinner with my<br/>
mom. About 9pm my MIL called saying my 7 year old was crying and<br/>
saying she wanted to come home. I spoke with my daughter and said &quot;Do<br/>
you want to come home&quot; and she said yes so I said okay we will come<br/>
get you. I didn&#39;t ask why. We just went and got her. For a few weeks<br/>
she complained about my MIL&#39;s husband saying he was grouchy. I do<br/>
understand that- he can be. I just felt like something else was going<br/>
on. Now that I have been typing I feel like 5 days for her without<br/>
seeing me and her dad was hard on her. It may have been pretty scary<br/>
too. Ever since that time she hasn&#39;t wanted to stay at grandma&#39;s for<br/>
very long. I&#39;m wondering if there is anything my hubby and I can do to<br/>
comfort her while she is gone. We have told her that she can call home<br/>
anytime she wants- even at 2am in the morning. We have also told her<br/>
that we will come and pick her up whenever she wants- no questions<br/>
asked. Is there anything we&#39;re overlooking that we are not doing and<br/>
should be? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618022720">I would say if she doesn&#39;t want to go, then she doesn&#39;t go.  It&#39;s not like a<br/>
custody arrangement.  Five days may be a long time for her, and fine for<br/>
someone else.  Does she seem ready to talk about whatever happened with<br/>
MIL&#39;s husband?  Do your instincts tell you something is wrong?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195194635">My daughter used to be my mothers best little friend and then one <br/>
time she stopped wanting to go there and sleep over- they both <br/>
seperately told me about how when they came in from being outside my <br/>
daughter wanted to eat and she wanted cookies- grandma said no you <br/>
need to eat food first and my daughter yelled and ran off to another <br/>
room. She then listened to grandma talk and went and ate cereal. <br/>
<br/>
I responded to my daughter that I would have been upset if I had <br/>
wanted to eat cookies and someone told me no- I told grandma that <br/>
sometimes I need sugar before eating food. <br/>
<br/>
We all thought the issue was not a big deal BUT daughter would not <br/>
sleep over again<br/>
<br/>
After about 6 months I asked her again why she did not want to sleep <br/>
over and she said about the cookies. I mentioned to grandma that she <br/>
needed to feel she could eat what she wanted. <br/>
<br/>
So over christmas grandma let her know that she had special cookies <br/>
saved so that when she needed to eat cookies she could. later on the <br/>
way home my daughter said she would sleep over again.<br/>
<br/>
my point is that grandpa could have been grumpy and talked grumpy in <br/>
a way that made her not want to go back. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204054769">I have two girls as well, and they go through phases....or should I  <br/>
say, periods of time when things are different for them. They both  <br/>
loved staying with my parents, they&#39;d spent the night with friends,  <br/>
etc, but when they turned seven, they would not go anywhere without  <br/>
ME. It was very hard on my parents, who did take it personally. It  <br/>
was hard on their friends (and their friends parents). It&#39;s taken two  <br/>
years for my oldest to get back to where she *might* spend the night  <br/>
*if* she has full guarantee that i will pick her up any time, day or  <br/>
night. Never gone longer than 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
At one point she said that her friends dad yelled at one of the  <br/>
animals, and it scared her, which is probably true. It was hard for  <br/>
him, because he&#39;s very emotive, and it had never bothered her before.  <br/>
And llamas are much more stubborn that people give them credit for.<br/>
<br/>
Give it time, give her your unending support, and it will all work  <br/>
out. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769858005">I so totally agree with Alex!<br/>
<br/>
Trust your dd&#39;s judgement.  Hopefully she will eventually tell <br/>
you what happened.  My daughter at that age wouldn&#39;t talk<br/>
about what happened at her dad&#39;s house until after she was <br/>
sure he was gone and she was safe from him.  He had a bad<br/>
temper to put it mildly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2685927">unschoolingbasicsThis whole setup sounds strange to me. That is a long time for a young child to be away from home. And why does it have to be this way? Can&#39;t Gramma come and visit for a few hours? At the girls&#39; invitation? <br/>

We have two girls- 7 and 4. About once every 5 or 6 weeks grandma (my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131836596">I see you appreciate that it may be scary for her and 5 days may be  <br/>
pretty scary too.  You go from there to what can you do to comfort  <br/>
her while she&#39;s there.  To me, there seems to be a gap that might be  <br/>
a good place to look at.  The gap that&#39;s in between, she&#39;s scared/ <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go......... and........ what can we do to comfort her  <br/>
while she&#39;s gone.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t allow the thing that&#39;s right in front of me to  <br/>
guide me bc I&#39;m programmed to expect a certain outcome.  Would not  <br/>
going to grandma&#39;s house bring up family disapproval that you  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to deal with?  You thought something else was going  <br/>
on.  Maybe opening up a conversation w/ your dd about her stay would  <br/>
be helpful for her.  Letting her know she never has to stay at  <br/>
grandma&#39;s again ever might give her the sense of safety to open up  <br/>
more about what it was like for her.  At least she will know she can  <br/>
trust you to take her feelings seriously.  The idea that she has an  <br/>
out only after she braves the scary thing can&#39;t feel very safe I  <br/>
don&#39;t think.<br/>

I agree.<br/>
Trying to find ways to help her be comfortable doing something she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do is not respectful. What she wants is to not spend<br/>
the night at all (at least that&#39;s how it sounds). <br/>
