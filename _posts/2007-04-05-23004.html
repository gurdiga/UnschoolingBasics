<div id="ygrps-yiv-223875001">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I had posted this a few weeks ago, but it got lost in the Christian  <br/>
Values thread mayhem.  It&#39;s a small problem, on the larger view of  <br/>
the world, but one that really stymies me.  Any thoughts would be great!<br/>
<br/>
We have a wonderful cat - she is tolerant, friendly, and playful.<br/>
Paige (who is 4) adores her (as we all do) and shows her this love by<br/>
picking her up constantly, laying on top of her, carrying her around<br/>
(sometime slinging her over her shoulders), holding her even if the<br/>
cat is struggling, and a variety of other things that are both<br/>
irritating to the cat, and very difficult for me to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Because the cat is sooooo tolerant, she mostly sits there with either<br/>
a blank expression on her face, or one that looks like she&#39;s thinking<br/>
&quot;help me please&quot;. She will sometimes back away from Paige, but it&#39;s<br/>
very slow and rarely quickly enough to run away. She even comes up<br/>
to Paige several times a day, looking for Paige to pet her, which<br/>
shows that she still likes her. A good thing is that she rarely<br/>
bites or scratches (or if she does it&#39;s very gentle biting or<br/>
scratching). But, when she does finally decide to bite, Paige is<br/>
totally incensed.<br/>
<br/>
I have a varied response to this (which I&#39;m sure is part of the<br/>
problem!). Sometimes I think that the cat can take care of herself<br/>
and I let it go. But, then I&#39;ll see Paige so something like go into<br/>
my bedroom, close the door and I walk in to find her laying on top of<br/>
the cat. Or, I&#39;ll see Paige run out of the room with the cat slung<br/>
over her shoulders. At those times I see it as an animal welfare<br/>
issue and I intervene. Mostly I try to help Paige to recognize<br/>
Monty&#39;s signals (squirming, meowing, etc), or encourage her to play<br/>
in ways that the cat really likes. But, overall, the whole thing has<br/>
become a difficult issue between Paige and I. She gets really mad at<br/>
me for intervening, or feels really sad when I do.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is normal behavior for a 4 year old. I also know<br/>
that some of it is that she is looking for my attention, so I have<br/>
been trying to focus on having more time alone with Paige and doing<br/>
things she really enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s when I see it as animal<br/>
mistreatment that I have a problem - that&#39;s the part I really get<br/>
stuck on. I don&#39;t want to see Monty being mistreated, and I don&#39;t<br/>
want either Paige or Tess to think that I think it&#39;s okay to do<br/>
that. So, overall I don&#39;t know how to present a balanced approach to<br/>
this problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009050955">I would say it&#39;s normal for a 4 year old, but I&#39;m no expert.  I&#39;m trying to get my &quot;extremely impulsive&quot; 7 year old to leave our animals alone.  Because our animals don&#39;t like being poked and prodded, and my daughter has been bit and scratched as our poor animals are just trying to defend themselves.  We have even considered locking our cats in our bedroom permanently (we have a large master bedroom, with a large bathroom), just so they are away from my child.  One of our cats hides up there all day long currently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918604376">We had some issues like that when we first got our pets...many, many <br/>
years ago.  Yes, it&#39;s typical 4 yo behavior.  My DD tried to treat <br/>
the pets the same as she would treat her babydolls...slung over <br/>
shoulders/balanced on a hip, wrapped up in blankets, trying to force <br/>
feed them because &quot;babies&quot; need to eat, dunking then in the bathtub, <br/>
all dressed up even in &quot;diapers&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, not all animals will be as tolerant as the one you have <br/>
now...in that you are lucky. In the future that might not be the <br/>
case...or if they try to play the same way with someone else&#39;s pet. <br/>
<br/>
As a parent and pet owner, I feel it is important to show little <br/>
ones how to interact with pets and how NOT to.<br/>
<br/>
And since you said that you think your DD is doing some of it for <br/>
your attention, don&#39;t just give her attention...give her AND the cat <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
Take the time to play with the cat together, pet the cat for a while <br/>
and &quot;let&quot; the cat decide when to walk away, show/discuss how many <br/>
different appropriate ways there are to love a cat (food/water, <br/>
shelter, litter box, petting, playing, napping, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, talk and &quot;show&quot; how NOT to treat the cat together. Sometimes <br/>
little kids cannot think about the &quot;other&#39;s point of <br/>
view/feelings&quot;...they just haven&#39;t developed that yet.  So sometimes <br/>
we would play the &quot;if you are...&quot; game to help our kids &quot;realize&quot; <br/>
how someone else feels/thinks.<br/>
<br/>
In your case we would have used &quot;if you are a cat...would you like <br/>
to be treated/handled like...?&quot;  We would ask the question and then <br/>
because the behavior was &#39;laying on top of the cat&#39;, we would then <br/>
lay on top of DD...until she &quot;meowed&quot; to be let up.  <br/>
<br/>
First she might think the game is silly and fun, but then she&#39;ll <br/>
realize that it isn&#39;t pleasant for her...being &quot;trapped&quot; and all.  <br/>
Then ask, &quot;Do you think Monty, enjoys feeling trapped they way you <br/>
did?&quot; to help her focus on the cat&#39;s feelings in a way a 4 yo can <br/>
easily identify with.  <br/>
<br/>
You may have to help her the first few times you play the game...&quot;if <br/>
you didn&#39;t enjoy being layed on, then maybe Monty doesn&#39;t like being <br/>
layed on either, what do you think?&quot;  Ask things like, &quot;How can we <br/>
tell if the cat doesn&#39;t like something?&quot; and &quot;When the cat tells us <br/>
he doesn&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, what could we do to help him feel <br/>
better?&quot;  (Hope that makes sense.)<br/>
<br/>
Talk about WHY DD didn&#39;t like being &quot;trapped&quot; (hard to move/breathe, <br/>
scary, lack of freedom, etc.)  Then talk about WHY Monty might not <br/>
like being layed on...DD is bigger/heavier than the cat which may be <br/>
painful, Monty may have a hard time moving/breathing which could be <br/>
dangerous, it could be scary for the cat, Monty&#39;s freedom is taken <br/>
away which could cause anger, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids loved the game so much they started playing it with each <br/>
other for a variety of things (prending to be pillows, rocks, <br/>
animals, people, dirt, water, foods, cars, etc.)...they&#39;ve long  <br/>
grown out of it, now.   <br/>
<br/>
Our favorite was &quot;Chicken Pillow&quot;...a feather pillow that was still <br/>
alive, wiggling, and &quot;clucking&quot;!  We&#39;d all pile on top of each other <br/>
and Shout, &quot;Be still Chicken Pillow!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how I miss those days! <br/>
