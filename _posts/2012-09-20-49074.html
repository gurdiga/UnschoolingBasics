<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839441437">I was wondering if anyone would be interested in participating in an Autumn Leaf Exchange with a lot of our homeschoolers here in CA?<br/>
<br/>
Perfect for all ages, and I am trying to get as many homeschoolers involved as I can from all over!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, please e-mail me off list @ sassilyyours AT yahoo DOT com, and I will send you more information. :)<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to send out to any other homeschoolers who may be interested, including you local park day groups.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995371257">Would this be mailing leaves back and forth to see the different variations? I think it would be a great idea, and if we could put a little message about where that tree came from, a bit where you found it, etc, it could be a wonderful science tool as well! Emailing you now! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088269383">When I think of California, I think of palm trees. So I&#39;m imagining someone in a New England state getting a huge box with a 4-foot palm branch in exchange for a packet of red, yellow, and orange leaves from New England. LOL! (Just joking - it was just a funny thought.)<br/>
