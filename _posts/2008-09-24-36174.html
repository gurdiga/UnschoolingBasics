Secondly, I have medical conditions that might make it<br/>
impossible to follow her closely (and my other daughter, for that<br/>
matter) in the future. Should the case ever arise that (God forbid)<br/>
I&#39;m no longer around, I want her to be able to take up learning under<br/>
someone else&#39;s tutelage or a school (again, God forbid) without too<br/>
much grief. This is the one area I know she might lack otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you will have your opinions on this and I welcome<br/>
them. I&#39;d like to fully unschool her, but I also need to resolve it<br/>
with my life&#39;s circumstances.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It must be scary to imagine your children growing up without you. There <br/>
are<br/>
people on this list who have lost family members. I bet you every one <br/>
of them is<br/>
happier for the memories they have of an unschooled life filled with <br/>
joy and<br/>
laughter and presence and play than they worry about anything that they <br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
teach or learn in those precious moments. I imagine that your daughters <br/>
will<br/>
rather that they remember you as this wonderfully joyful parent than <br/>
that they<br/>
will rally against you for not preparing them well enough for a <br/>
possible return<br/>
to school. Parent them with the wonderful freedom that could come with <br/>
knowing<br/>
that every moment is a gift. Don&#39;t prepare them for your absence, let <br/>
them live<br/>
with your joy!<br/>
