<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029246487">Wondering what other people&#39;s experience is with the Girl Scouts. We <br/>
tried it out with our daughter the other day. She attended an all <br/>
day event.  I stayed for the entire thing...It felt like school! She <br/>
kept wandering off when she felt like it and the &quot;troop leader&quot; had <br/>
to keep calling her back. Then at one point, she got angry about my <br/>
not having brought her sleeping bag (she thought that the older <br/>
girls were going to camp out - they weren&#39;t) and she walked away <br/>
angry. My husband was there too and the head of the whole thing said <br/>
that we couldn&#39;t let her walk away from the group because people <br/>
participating cannot be alone and that she was going to talk to her <br/>
(if that was okay with us). Myself and my  husband (even though we <br/>
hadn&#39;t talked about it) had in our minds that we were going to let <br/>
her have her feelings (away from the group, physically she had moved <br/>
away but was close enough for us to see/watch her - I felt <br/>
comfortable with being able to see her).   I knew she would <br/>
eventually come back once she had her feelings about it.  Plus, my <br/>
experience has been when she is angry that she needs that space to <br/>
feel it and then I am able to talk with her.  Anyway, the head of <br/>
the thing (who obviously was very uncomfortable with our daughter <br/>
and her expression of her feelings and basically her whole &quot;way&quot; of <br/>
being - asked me to accompany her while she talked to our daughter.  <br/>
She proceeded to tell her the &quot;rules&quot; that no girl participating <br/>
could be alone at any time during the event and that she (our <br/>
daughter) needed to come and join the group.  Our daughter tried to <br/>
say how she felt and the woman just shut her down and when my <br/>
daughter turned away from her and started getting angrier, the woman <br/>
demanded that she look at her &quot;you will look at me,&quot; etc. It was a <br/>
terrible display of verbal/emotional abuse and I let it happen~ I <br/>
have a whole set of guilt about that. I know I failed my daughter <br/>
completely in this situation.  She and I have talked about it and <br/>
had a good cry about it.  She said she forgave me and I thank god <br/>
that she has such a tremendous amount of forgiveness, brilliance, <br/>
love, acceptance.  All my intention was for her going in the first <br/>
place was for her to make some friends.  She has no girl friends <br/>
here and craves the connection with other girls.   This is a <br/>
situation that has happened in other places with my daughter - other <br/>
adults verbally and emotionally targeting her for her just &quot;being&quot; - <br/>
at church (unitarian), and just in general - one guy my daughter <br/>
scowled at told my husband that he should beat her (&quot;she needs to <br/>
learn manners&quot;) - of course, when she scowls at him it&#39;s for a <br/>
reason, the guy is angry, mean, and has been sarcastic and mean with <br/>
her before and she doesn&#39;t like him. I realize, when I really think <br/>
about it, my daughters feelings, reactions mostly seem to be <br/>
grounded in something.  That sounds like a basic thing, but <br/>
Sometimes I can&#39;t always see the &quot;something&quot; or even it&#39;s validity <br/>
(from my perspective) but it&#39;s hers and i have to honor her <br/>
feelings.  Personally, I admit I am a control freak and it&#39;s been a <br/>
challenge to push that away and let her &quot;be.&quot;  It is also especially <br/>
hard in this society where people see you &quot;unschooling&quot; and they get <br/>
very angry at the way you are &quot;letting&quot; your child have his/her <br/>
feelings. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506317600">We have a great group...I love both the girls and the leader.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that scouting (both boys and girls) do have a policy of no  <br/>
one being alone (and there must always be two adults when any scout  <br/>
is present)  to decrease the chances of any abuse happening, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like your daughter was alone, it sounds more like the  <br/>
leader was doing a control routine. I would suggest that you look  <br/>
around at different groups in your area, I know that we drive to the  <br/>
next town over because we didn&#39;t like any of the four groups in our  <br/>
town. This group is all homeschoolers, and the leader is an attached  <br/>
parent, so even if they use a curriculum, she&#39;s very open to  <br/>
unschooling, doesn&#39;t have to prove a point about learning or  <br/>
behavior, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Not only looking for a different group, but I am curious. What was  <br/>
the all-day thing? I don&#39;t know that we would jump into something  <br/>
that big at first, just because it can be overwhelming, we always  <br/>
start with small meetings in the individual groups, and we&#39;ve often  <br/>
skipped council events or one in which several groups are meeting  <br/>
because there is always a goal (earning badges, doing a service  <br/>
project) that might not be interesting to my girls and don&#39;t allow  <br/>
for individuality as much because the adults don&#39;t know them, don&#39;t  <br/>
understand them, are goal oriented and overwhelmed with too many kids  <br/>
at once.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864503843">I&#39;m new to homeschooling, but I&#39;ve been a Girl Scout leader for 5 years.<br/>
My troop includes my daughter and 5 other girls who are all in 6th<br/>
grade.  This year I also took on the Service Unit Manager position.<br/>
<br/>
I love what we can accomplish with Girl Scouts.  While it is true that<br/>
the girls enjoy doing fun activities together, it isn&#39;t the primary<br/>
reason that I encouraged my daughter to join a troop.  I value the<br/>
opportunity that we have to help make the world a better place through<br/>
service activities.  The girls in my troop are learning to be leaders<br/>
who truly believe that they can change the world.<br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about becoming a Girl Scout leader yourself?  Your<br/>
local Girl Scout Council will provide all the training and resources<br/>
that you need.  Then, you can encourage your daughter and fellow troop<br/>
members to select the activities that appeal to them.  Some troops<br/>
prefer outdoor activities to crafts, etc.  Within reasonable safety<br/>
guidelines, your girls can make the troop be whatever they want it to<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Girl Scouts encourages girls to be leaders who choose how they want to<br/>
run their troop and what it is they want to do.  Obviously, parent<br/>
leaders don&#39;t always feel comfortable handing the reins over to the<br/>
girls.  When my troop consisted of 14 six-year-olds, I have to admit it<br/>
was very difficult to take a back seat.   However, the girls have to be<br/>
given the opportunity to succeed and fail in order to learn how to lead.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes blog about our girl scout experience, and am planning to<br/>
write quite a bit about the exciting new direction that the national<br/>
Girl Scout Council is planning for 2008.  Please visit Living By<br/>

Hope you give Girl Scouts another chance, Sandra<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295882489">Melissa, thanks. Before we joined I didn&#39;t know about the policy about scouts not being alone, but the leader did mention this when she went over to &quot;talk&quot; to my daughter. I forgot that we have choices about the group we can go to. I will definitely take your advice and explore other groups and I think you are right, perhaps it was too much in one day for my daughter (it was actually a camping skills day and she earned a badge), since she is rarely in a group environment.  It&#39;s an adjustment. Yes, i didn&#39;t really know that all of the different (levels) of scouts would be attending and i&#39;m certain my daughter wasn&#39;t thrilled - it was just too much. Not to mention all of the activities one after the other. Many of the things didn&#39;t interest her.  One good thing, the daisy troop leader (not the lady I was referring to earlier) told me that there are some homeschoolers out here - which i   would have never known since i haven&#39;t crossed paths with any here yet. So, that info was<br/>
 helpful.<br/>
  Thanks for sharing your experience and advice.  I appreciate it so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222552028">I&#39;ll bet it was really disappointing for her to find out that they  <br/>
weren&#39;t sleeping over either. That would have pushed me over the  <br/>
