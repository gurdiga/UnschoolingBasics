<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350303432">A few days ago I noticed several mantras are running through my head<br/>
daily now - find a way to say yes, what can I do to support my child<br/>
in this situation, the relationship is what matters most, we aren&#39;t<br/>
preparing for living in the world (we&#39;re doing it right now), just<br/>
change the next interaction with your child, etc. I&#39;ve made a point to<br/>
bring at least one of these things up each day, roll it over in my<br/>
head and talk about it with DH when we get a quiet moment.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I were able to have several indepth conversations about<br/>
unschooling and we read several threads together that I&#39;d saved to<br/>
share with him. He&#39;s my partner in parenting and I really want us both<br/>
on the same page with unschooling & respectful parenting - he gets<br/>
less &quot;thinking&quot; time than I do and less time to put these ideas into<br/>
practice, but he&#39;s getting it and things have been clicking. I<br/>
realized that it is easier for him to parent respectfully when I am<br/>
doing it myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, what I wanted to say is THANK YOU for all the ideas you&#39;ve<br/>
helped me discover and the alternate perspectives I&#39;ve been exposed to<br/>
by being on this list. I am very grateful. We&#39;ve had some very<br/>
wonderful moments the past few days and I wanted to share a few of them.<br/>
<br/>
We spent Thursday at the park. In the beginning everyone wanted to do<br/>
something different and go in opposite directions and the situation<br/>
was starting to escalate - the kids were getting upset and DH & I were<br/>
feeling that urge to say something stupid like &quot;you can&#39;t always get<br/>
your way&quot;. But instead of just pulling rank and deciding to go do<br/>
Activity A first and then move on to Activity B (because that seems<br/>
the most efficient use of our time or some other &quot;rational&quot; reason) we<br/>
stopped and took some time to share our ideas with each other. We took<br/>
turns talking about what we wanted to do and then we made a plan<br/>
everyone agreed with. The kids were really helpful and offered several<br/>
suggestions on how to make our day more enjoyable. I know it probably<br/>
seems like a little thing, just a baby step, especially to those of<br/>
you who have been unschooling for years, but I was so happy about<br/>
this! It was great to interact with the kids in this way, to validate<br/>
their ideas, to empower them and take them seriously, and treat their<br/>
wishes with utmost care.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we got home late from grocery shopping and as we were pulling<br/>
in the driveway my daughter said, &quot;Mom, I want to help you unload the<br/>
groceries.&quot; I laughed and said, &quot;You just want to unpack the honey we<br/>
bought!&quot; (She&#39;d been diligent about making sure we bought honey and<br/>
mentioned wanting some when we got home.) She said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t care<br/>
about the honey, really.&quot; So I replied jokingly, &quot;Ah, you&#39;re not<br/>
sleepy and want something to do.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;Nope. You look<br/>
tired and I just want to help, that&#39;s all.&quot; (A year ago I would have<br/>
insisted she go straight to bed and probably thought she was just<br/>
using stall tactics.) But I went with it and said I&#39;d love to have her<br/>
help if she wanted to do that. After I carried DS to  bed (he&#39;d fallen<br/>
asleep in the car) she helped me unload every single bag from the car<br/>
(there were a lot) and then we sorted the food together and she took<br/>
charge of putting all the frozen stuff away. It was actually fun to do<br/>
it together, I really enjoyed having this time with her and I think<br/>
she enjoyed it to - she felt helpful and appreciated. Of course, I<br/>
didn&#39;t expect her to any of this (and I wouldn&#39;t have even asked). As<br/>
soon as the last bag was empty she gave me a hug and said &quot;good night<br/>
mom!&quot; and went to bed. I just stood there for a few minutes afterwards<br/>
with a big stupid, happy grin on my face and thought about what an<br/>
amazing kid she is. I also realized that it *shouldn&#39;t* be surprising<br/>
to me, but coming from a conventional mindset it was wonderfully<br/>
refreshing to break away from that mold and trust her intentions and<br/>
enjoy the moment, to find joy in putting the groceries away.<br/>
<br/>
Then yesterday the kids asked if we could take a walk to our<br/>
neighborhood creek. My first inclination was to say no - I had just<br/>
started a rather complicated project, my mind was preoccupied and I<br/>
felt pushed for time. Then two of those mantras came zooming into my<br/>
head (find a way to say yes and the relationship is what matters).<br/>
They clearly wanted this experience I should be honored to share it<br/>
with them. I realized that there was nothing happening that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
walk away from and come back to later, and that my kids were asking<br/>
for my attention right now and they were certainly more important than<br/>
the project I was working on. So I told them it was great idea and to<br/>
give me just 5 minutes to put some stuff away.<br/>
<br/>
When I came into the hallway I found my son waiting at the door with a<br/>
backpack full of stuff and it looked pretty heavy. He said that he&#39;d<br/>
packed a blanket, a bottle of juice, 3 cups, some books, and a<br/>
notebook for drawing. I had the urge to tell him &quot;no&quot; about the juice<br/>
and to talk him out of taking the heavy books, for no real reason - my<br/>
objections totally fell apart when I examined them more closely. Why<br/>
has my first instinct been to say &quot;no&quot;? Anyways, it occurred to me<br/>
that these things were clearly part of his plan for spending time at<br/>
the creek, he felt they added something important to his adventure,<br/>
and it was very thoughtful of him to anticipate what our needs might<br/>
be and plan accordingly. (I find myself actually having these<br/>
conversations in my head lately but at least they&#39;re helping me from<br/>
blurting out the first thing that comes to mind.) He also had the dogs<br/>
hooked up to their leashes. I wasn&#39;t planning to take the dogs but<br/>
there really wasn&#39;t any reason not to and he wanted to walk them, so<br/>
out the door we went. We had a lovely walk and enjoyed a leisurely<br/>
time at the creek, where DS spread out the blanket and kept us<br/>
hydrated and refreshed with juice. :)<br/>
<br/>
On the way back he wanted to run so he asked if I would carry the<br/>
backpack and take the dogs. I could literally hear the words of my<br/>
previous mentality (echoing the words of my mother) saying, &quot;It was<br/>
your choice to bring the dogs and you insisted on carrying that<br/>
backpack, so that&#39;s what you need to do.&quot; Fortunately I didn&#39;t say<br/>
that! Instead I held out my hands and he handed me everything. As I<br/>
watched him run ahead in that excited, joyous way children do, I felt<br/>
this huge weight lift off me. In my mind&#39;s eye I could picture those<br/>
awful words floating above me like a banner and then they just cracked<br/>
and dissipated into little tiny specks until they were totally gone.<br/>
<br/>
Moments like these just make me want them more, to do things better<br/>
each day. Small things, I know. But this list has helped me become<br/>
more mindful and it IS making a world of difference in our lives,<br/>
slowly but surely. Thank you again!! If I could give you all a great<br/>
big hug I would! Maybe in September...<br/>

  What a wonderful account to share with us! I am glad, you and your family had such a great day. Isn&#39;t it amazing, how thinking differently can change everything?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301414891">~~That is called Law Of Attraction.~~<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s called making different choices. It&#39;s called mindful<br/>
parenting.  It&#39;s called action.<br/>
<br/>
You can sit around having different thoughts all you want (and yes,<br/>
thoughts are very powerful things) but until you ACT, nothing changes.<br/>
It takes no new age voodoo or any kind of dogma to act. Sure, our<br/>
thinking has to change in order to take steps into mindful parenting,<br/>
but sitting around thinking positive thoughts won&#39;t get a person very far.<br/>
<br/>
Action is key.<br/>
Making a better choice with each interaction with our children can<br/>
change lives forever. <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s remember this list is diverse and preaching any kind of dogma or<br/>
religion is discouraged. I don&#39;t mind people referencing links to<br/>
ideas or philosophies. I do get bothered if there is constant<br/>
reference to it though. Thanks!<br/>

I just had to say how nice it is to see that others do that too. Sometimes  I <br/>
am totally dumbfounded at the wonderful-ness of my kids (if that&#39;s not a <br/>
word,  it is now, lol). As your next sentence said, you know you &quot;Shouldn&#39;t&quot; be  <br/>
surprised, and I suppose that&#39;s true - I shouldn&#39;t be either. But as the kids  <br/>
age, mellow, grow out of the school shell they have on (2 I am working hard to <br/>
 get out of school, but they like the convention right now, but yet, I see <br/>
their  development and growth which makes me smile), I am often caught standing <br/>
with a  smile or tears in my eyes - so happy that my kids are whothey are. <br/>
