<div id="ygrps-yiv-240994949">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into 4-H. When we were active, each member participated as much or as little as they felt comfortable with. The uniform was used only for those who choose to compete in our 1 time a year Spring Show and simply was whites, white jeans, white shirt a green bandana and hat, or club colors, a green T-shirt. 4-H offers a wide variety of activities and our region, Yolo County, offers hunting to 10 and up. Also, the clubs will take any willing adult to lead most any project, so you could become a leader for hiking and arrange hiking trips 1 time a month with and for your son. The leadership through 4-H is fantastic and writing this post makes me realize how much I miss my involvement with the group. The kids run the program with adult support.<br/>
<br/>
 Each club has its own uniqueness too, so if you have many clubs in your area, go to all of them before selecting. In our town, there are 4 local clubs, plus horse only club if you&#39;re totally into horses and most clubs offer different county wide programs, like the hunting, archery, sheep, rabbit, and quilting. These are open to kids from any club and generally meet 1 time a month for a few hours. Our club had over 30 projects for the kids to join.<br/>

with him? Perhaps with a few other friends? We go<br/>
camping a couple times in the summer with some<br/>
friends. Our kids love that. We go on short hikes<br/>
while there. <br/>
<br/>
I bet if you sent a message on your local<br/>
homeschooling list, you could gather some folks to go<br/>
camping with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563578630">You might also look into a different troop, because each one is run differently. My son&#39;s <br/>
troop meets once a month, and even then you don&#39;t have to wear class A uniforms, but <br/>
can wear a class B tshirt. Or if you aren&#39;t in the flag ceremony, even that is optional. He <br/>
does have weekly patrol meetings, but that too depends on the individual patrol. Our <br/>
patrol is half homeschoolers, with even another unschooler. It&#39;s very laid back. Their goal <br/>
is companionship and helping each other out, not having the most badges or looking the <br/>
best or even outperforming other patrols. Some boys can&#39;t make it to every meeting, not a <br/>
big deal either. You can make up attendence with other things like collecting cans for food <br/>
benefits, or showing up at eagle scout ceremonies, camping etc. Those are options that <br/>
should be available in every troop, but some troops definitely push certain aspects over <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The merit badge numbers are only important if he&#39;s looking to be an eagle scout at the <br/>
end. If that&#39;s not important, then tell him not to worry about the badges. Tell the patrol <br/>
leader it&#39;s not important to your family, eagle scout isn&#39;t the end-all be-all. :-) Josh gets all <br/>
of his badges through 1) a summer camp (Camp Hale) that he can earn four badges at...all <br/>
the activities are meant to help walk boys through that, and 2) through merit badge fairs, <br/>
in which the focus of the day is getting one or two under your belts. Without worrying day <br/>
to day about doing all the activities, Josh has a better time with doing it all in one day or <br/>
week (if he&#39;s at the camp)<br/>
<br/>
I would really suggest looking for another troop. I have a friend who&#39;s son is in AWANIS. i <br/>
have no idea what that is, but they basically do it because it is more laid back. We&#39;re in 4H, <br/>
but just the younger kids, so I don&#39;t know what the expectations are for the older. It looks <br/>
like the older kids in our group meet once a month, don&#39;t wear any kind of uniform, but <br/>
then they don&#39;t camp or anything either.<br/>
<br/>
For josh, camping is the best part of scouts. We definitely camp as a family, but not nearly <br/>
as often. In October they went every weekend! Finally it was enough even for him. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you guys can find something he likes. I love our patrol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208732713">Venture Scouts is a GREAT organization.  They allow both boys  and girls. <br/>
Also if he really wants to go hunting looking into joining a NRA club  is <br/>
probably a good thing as well.<br/>

 <br/>
Are there any Spiral Scouts in your area?  We aren&#39;t personally  involved but <br/>
I know several kids here that participate in Spiral Scouts.  I  think it was <br/>
originally designed as an alternative scouting program.  These  families all <br/>
seem to be either relaxed homeschoolers or unschoolers. It seems to  be very <br/>
family oriented with entire families going camping rather than just the  kids.  <br/>
Might be worth checking out to see if there are any in your  area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463276333">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t post often, but met a few of you at the Unschooling Conference in MA<br/>
this past year.  <br/>
 <br/>
One suggestion I have is investigating whether there is a Spiral Scouts<br/>
group near you and if not, starting one yourself.  You can Google spiral<br/>
scouts to find out more.<br/>
 <br/>
ALSO, for a number of years, our family has participated in a group we<br/>
started a while back called AP Homeschool Camping group.  We were and are a<br/>
group of families who homeschool and practice attachment parenting (although<br/>
we have older children now, we still believe in the ap lifestyle when it<br/>
comes to respecting our children and treating them with dignity).  We have<br/>
done between 2 and 5 camping weekends per season.  <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps you can start your own unschooling or homeschooling camping group<br/>
(we have a yahoogroup for organizing) and include monthly hikes as well as<br/>
camping trips.  You can start the yahoogroup and advertise with your local<br/>
or statewide homeschooling organization or just start inviting families you<br/>
know. Now is the perfect time of year (at least here in New England) to book<br/>
group sites at local state parks for camping.<br/>

on vacation and I came back with a horrible cold.  I am also going to <br/>
look into 4-H when I feel better.  Not sure about the spiral and <br/>
