<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014130235">Last night was really bad for me, but my kids were wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
While DW and I were in the middle of some oh-so-important things (note the<br/>
sarcasm here), dd#2 came up to me and said that she needed some Mommy &<br/>
Daddy time.  We put her off &quot;for a few minutes.&quot;  I made a phone call to my<br/>
own father, and while talking with him, dd#1 came in a few minutes later and<br/>
said that she needed me &quot;right now!&quot;  I asked what was wrong, and she said<br/>
that dd2 wouldn&#39;t share the cheese crackers.  I said that I&#39;d be in in a<br/>
minute.  I wasn&#39;t.  5-10 minutes later dd1 is upset b/c dd2 has eaten<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
I had let myself get stressed before this, and for some reason I went<br/>
hurtling off the deep end screaming &quot;cannonball!&quot;.  Well, I did some yelling<br/>
at dd2, anyway.  Not proud of myself a-tall.<br/>
<br/>
I told them about how bad I felt for ignoring them and for yelling, and<br/>
apologized to both of them as well.  (The conversation was a bit more<br/>
substantive than this, but that&#39;s the gist.)  And both tried to make ME feel<br/>
better when I was the one being an idiot.  Wish I&#39;d been able to de-school<br/>
myself and do a lot of this before I had kids so they wouldn&#39;t have to put<br/>
up with all this baggage of mine.<br/>
<br/>
So why tell y&#39;all all this?  I suppose it&#39;s to re-iterate that when we do<br/>
screw up, there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;ll give us another one (another chance,<br/>
that is).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t deserve my own kids.<br/>
<br/>
Comments and questions are most welcome.<br/>

Rob, thanks for posting this. You helped so many people here you won&#39;t  <br/>
believe it. Because unschooling isn&#39;t dependent on being perfect, and every one  of <br/>
us f*&ks up. And kids know that and they love us and if we apologize and  try <br/>
to do better next time they forgive us, too.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easy to mess up. I&#39;m sure the cracker incident felt like it could wait  <br/>
a couple of minutes. And you&#39;re going to mess up on something else, again. And <br/>
 it&#39;s going to be okay. And your kids are learning that their parents can <br/>
mess up  and take responsibility for it, and if they mess up, it&#39;ll also be okay.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easy for long time unschoolers to get the &quot;well, of course it works  for <br/>
you -- you/your child is exceptional.&quot; One of the things I hear a lot is  <br/>
&quot;we&#39;d just fight all the time.&quot; I explain that they might fight at first, but  <br/>
when you don&#39;t have to rush out to the next thing you can deal with the conflict <br/>
 and move on. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for sharing this story, and thanks for being a good dad.<br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn<br/>
<br/>

that the parents sit back and wait for kids to &quot;take the lead.&quot; But  <br/>
there is more to unschooling that that - it is more like a dance in  <br/>
which the child sometimes leads, the parent sometimes leads, and most  <br/>
of the time the dance flows so seamlessly that it is impossible to  <br/>
say that either is really leading.<br/>

exercise is to pretend you are all on vacation - keep a sort of  <br/>
&quot;travel diary&quot; &lt;G&gt; - meaning observe your kids and think really hard  <br/>
about what they&#39;re learning from their leisure time activities. After  <br/>
a while, you&#39;ll realize that they are always learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960358091">The best question for you would be - why are you controlling the tv and punishing?<br/>
<br/>
the more you control the more it is wanted-needed-desired<br/>
<br/>
the more you let go the more they have the CHOICE to do ANYTHING- including watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
tv is not better or worse then say- reading a book- if they were reading all day would you tell them to go watch tv<br/>
<br/>
we live in an electronic time and electronics have been demonized for no reason- <br/>
<br/>
why are you not trusting them to make their own choices?<br/>
<br/>
What are you grounding them for? at our house there are no punishments and no rules- &quot;misbehavior&quot; is seen as a time to teach about stuff and we work it out and find something that works for everyone- my 4 yr old will tell her friends who are 6 and 8 that they can work it out and she comes up with an acceptable solution- she still lashes out when she has the need to but that is not punished either and it is way less than before unschooling<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps I have to run<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The very best way you can understand is to answer the question  <br/>
yourself. Of course your head is full of all the counter arguments  <br/>
that are so common in our society. If you read here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
that will give your a perspective on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that all the counter arguments are based on what people  <br/>
*fear* will happen, not on actual knowledge. The arguments *do* make  <br/>
sense. It sure feels like a real possibility that when given the  <br/>
freedom to do nothing but watch TV that that&#39;s what kids would do.  <br/>
(It makes sense because we have the sneaking suspicion that if we  <br/>
could live a life of leisure with no responsibilities that that&#39;s  <br/>
exactly what we would do. ;-) And stay up all night. And eat cake for  <br/>
breakfast!)<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers have is experience with giving kids the freedoms  <br/>
that people fear will have horrible consequences. We know that when  <br/>
kids live life with TV as just another thing to do, that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
consume them any more than building with Legos does.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
About watching TV vs. reading<br/>
<br/>
I remember from my English literature course (yes, I did some, at the <br/>
University, I know you wouldn&#39;t tell from my nice prose, but well ...) <br/>
that when the first novels came out, they have a terrible reputation <br/>
and were accused to have the worst influence on people imagination. <br/>
They were not serious enough, what books should be. And they were <br/>
encouraging idleness.<br/>
<br/>
When you look at people watching TV or people reading, you could say <br/>
similar things about both activities. I&#39;m sure that most of the <br/>
arguments against TV could be used, without being much modified, <br/>
against reading fiction.<br/>
<br/>
As a child, I was reading all the time and maybe it was not so good, <br/>
maybe it was a time-consuming activity and it may have prevented me <br/>
from doing other interesting things ... I&#39;m still a very &quot;cerebral&quot; <br/>
person, having mostly fun with written things and needing sometimes to <br/>
bea bit pushed to get out of my home (couch/computer) ... Unschooling <br/>
is really good for me, at this level :) But it didn&#39;t bother anybody, <br/>
because books are so positively seen, because they are &quot;cultural&quot; <br/>
objects ...<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter, who is 2, has seen a lot of TV and she has an <br/>
amazing memory of proper nouns. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right, but I have <br/>
the feeling that there is a connection between the two things.<br/>
