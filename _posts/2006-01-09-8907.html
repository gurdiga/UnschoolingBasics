<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127158888">Unschooling has finally brought the child out in me.  My dd, 11, is an <br/>

<br/>
Saturday we played hide and seek in the house.  At one point she was <br/>
hiding in the broom closet.  I just opened the closet not thinking <br/>
that she would fit in there, but there she was, she screamed, I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095846801">This is my favorite part about children in general - I get to act like a<br/>
complete goof and say it&#39;s &quot;for the kids!&quot;  I get to play on the mcdonald&#39;s<br/>
playground equipment, ride on the carousel in the mall and even goof off in<br/>
the park!  I can&#39;t help but feel sorry for those poor souls who miss out on<br/>
these opportunities - especially the ones who have children and STILL don&#39;t<br/>
have any fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547783283">DH is loving being able to get his hands on stuff he wanted as a kid <br/>
and still wants. We have tons of Legos and often he&#39;s the one <br/>
getting them out and making amazing structures and things.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that we&#39;ve gotten to really enjoy thanks to DS is the <br/>
drive in theater (yup there&#39;s one about 15 minutes from us!). We <br/>
spend pretty much every Friday during the summer there (providing <br/>
there&#39;s at least one movie we want to see that we haven&#39;t already <br/>
seen - they have double features and 3 screens so with 6 first run <br/>
movies there&#39;s usually something to go watch). We&#39;ve been there <br/>
during thunder storms, chilly evenings, warm muggy evenings, all <br/>
sorts of weather. The ticket sellers and the parking guys (the ones <br/>
who make sure people park big vehicles in the back and small <br/>
vehicles in the front, etc) all recognize our truck and come by to <br/>
say hi and all. It also led to a funny that had DS erupting <br/>
repeatedly in giggles last night. DH went out and picked up KFC (he <br/>
was wanting fried chicken without all the work). The KFC is just <br/>
past the drive in. On the drive in sign, which he reported back to <br/>
us, setting off the giggle fest, it said<br/>
<br/>
Closed for the Season. Reason. Freezin!<br/>
<br/>
That just tickled and delighted DS who loves rhymes.<br/>
