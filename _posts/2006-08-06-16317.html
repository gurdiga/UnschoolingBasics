<div id="ygrps-yiv-159951594">I promise I&#39;ll leave you good folks alone for a while after this one<br/>
but you&#39;re spoiling me with great advice and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
We adore our children and I&#39;m lucky that I have a husband who spends a<br/>
lot of time with them when he&#39;s home from work but we have always<br/>
enjoyed the quiet time to ourselves after the kids are in bed to read,<br/>
research on the net, answer emails, play games, watch movies with<br/>
hubby, etc...are we going to loose that down time that I think I<br/>
really need if I don&#39;t have the kids in bed at a certain time?  If I<br/>
wait until they are asleep I&#39;m too tired to do anything but sleep. <br/>
We&#39;re already pretty relaxed about bedtime but I have a 5 month old<br/>
that goes to sleep around 9 so usually the rest of the kids are up in<br/>
bed (our giant &quot;bed&quot; room since we co-sleep) watching a movie or<br/>
reading.  If I tell them they can stay up and do whatever, will my 5<br/>
month old be able to sleep and will they wake my 2 year old after she<br/>
falls aleep?  My days start at 6 when baby and oldest are usually<br/>
awake so there is no time during the day for me to just chill since<br/>
I&#39;m always on call to do what they want.  So I guess I&#39;m asking is do<br/>
we parents ever just have down time even when the kids are awake or<br/>
are we being selfish?  I want them to know that mommy and daddy enjoy<br/>
reading a good book or playing games and watching movies too.  We do<br/>
all of these things with the kids but what about us?<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

  You&#39;ll probably lose what you&#39;re used to, yes. But there are other <br/>
ways to get what you need without going back to the only thing you <br/>
know. It&#39;s time to get creative. It also helps to be open and honest.<br/>

  Have you ever *asked* for it? Been open and honest and said what you <br/>
need?<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t get as much as you had before you had children. No way. You <br/>
had children! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But you can get more than you have now by asking for some quiet <br/>
time/alone time/private time.<br/>

scheduled &quot;me time&quot; into our weekly lives.  A time when I could go off by<br/>
myself and do something without a lot of fuss and muss and baby drool<br/>
(sometimes I just needed to be drool free for an hour or two).  Sometimes I<br/>
would go to the movie (I love going to the movies alone) and sometimes it<br/>
was just to walk in the mall or do the weekly grocery shopping leisurely or<br/>
go out to a church that had an outdoor labyrinth and spiral around it.<br/>
These little 1-2 hour breaks were a great way for me to rejuvinate and be<br/>
able to come home and better enjoy my children.  And they aren&#39;t always<br/>
going to be little.  My children are at an age where they can stay home<br/>
alone for a few hours at a time and they enjoy that independence.  (Trust<br/>
me, your children will get there and sooner than you think!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373462840">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We have created an evening where the kids know that after 10pm it is <br/>
quiet, especially when Tim has to get up for work the next day. We <br/>
have been very clear with the kids to respect anyone who is asleep, <br/>
a baby, a dad, a mom. Sleep is valued. That being said, in the <br/>
mornings we also have some who sleep later and we keep the <br/>
activities quiet until everyone is awake.<br/>
<br/>
What this looks like is Tim (dh) in bed, often with my 9 year old <br/>
son sleeping too. My 12 year old dd stays up in her room, quietly <br/>
reading or on the computer or watching TV, all quiet, no blaring <br/>
loud music and dancing around the house at 11 pm. Last night she <br/>
wanted to iron at midnight. I actually asked her to wait until the <br/>
morning, being that the openning and closing of the ironing board <br/>
would be noisy as would putting her clothes away. The closet is the <br/>
wall where the sleeping people are.. Who knows a kid who wants to <br/>
iron their own clothes... That is another post all together. She&#39;s <br/>
ironing now.<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old is the night owl. She and I have evolved a very <br/>
workable routine. She quietly plays in her room, I lay down in <br/>
another room and when she is finally ready for sleep, I crawl into <br/>
her bed and we sleep. I get anywhere from 15-45 minutes. i could <br/>
read, but usually I meditate or just space or sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when do Tim and I have time together? We take what we can get. <br/>
Sometimes it coffee and tea in the eveings while the kids play <br/>
happily. Sometimes it being together early in the morning. We don&#39;t <br/>
watch movies that the kids can&#39;t watch, we watch movies together. <br/>
Last night Tim and I cuddled on the bed while the 2 little ones <br/>
played game cube, so we were all together, yet having our own <br/>
experiences, yes G rated, but a back rub feels good no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
Tim is very sweet and he knows there will be a time just around the <br/>
corner where we will be alone missing all this chaos. That helps a <br/>
ton. <br/>
<br/>
So I would suggest finding out each persons needs and then looking <br/>
at how to meet those needs. Yes, the baby needs to stay asleep, as <br/>
does the 2 year old, maybe moving the TV in another space for those <br/>
who will be still awake, or get another TV. And remember your needs <br/>
are important too, so how much time do you want separate how <br/>
regualrly, what are you will to do to get that? We know a few <br/>
families who have a babysitting co-op. Each Friday night, 1 family <br/>
takes the kids, has movies, popcorn, fun together, the other <br/>
families have a free night to go out or stay in. Each family hosts 1 <br/>
time a month, so that leaves 3-4 Friday nights for adult time <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
<br/>
Mary</div>
