<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209914320">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list and am wondering if anyone can share what their high<br/>
schoolers do (or don&#39;t do).  We have done Charlotte Mason for years, but I<br/>
got really overwhelmed when I had a difficult pregnancy and then a new<br/>
baby.  She is now 2 and I&#39;m STILL not motivated to do much of anything.  I<br/>
have a lot of guilt about that, but there&#39;s no use in wallowing, it&#39;s time<br/>
to do something about it.  So, I have a friend who introduced me to<br/>
unschooling.  My kids are 16 (17 next month), 14, 7, almost 5 and my<br/>
daughter turned 2 a couple of weeks ago.  So, I understand how to do this<br/>
with the younger kids, that&#39;s easy.  It&#39;s the high schoolers that I&#39;m at a<br/>
loss about.  In fact, this past year, we haven&#39;t done much of anything at<br/>
all.  I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t agree with that statement, since it&#39;s impossible<br/>
to do NOTHING.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My 16 yr. old has expressed interest in going to college.  He was always<br/>
strong at math until we got to algebra.  We haven&#39;t done anything beyond<br/>
basic math, other than a year ago, when we struggled with algebra.  He has<br/>
a part time job at a fast food restaurant and wants to work about 25-30<br/>
hours (he bought a car, so needs to pay for it and insurance, since we<br/>
can&#39;t), which I think is great.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy reading and doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to have much interest in anything else, so I don&#39;t know what to do.  He did<br/>
ask me to assign him pages in The Teenage Liberation Handbook, because he<br/>
wants to read it, but says he never will, unless I assign him pages.  So, I<br/>
told him I&#39;d do that for him.  I want to help him be ready for college, but<br/>
don&#39;t know how to do that without getting &quot;schooly.&quot;  I have read some<br/>
stories about unschoolers going to college and am thinking he&#39;ll be ok, if<br/>
he starts at a community college, which is about all we could afford right<br/>
now, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yr. old is very involved with music.  He took a few years of piano<br/>
lessons when he was younger and teaches himself songs from the radio and<br/>
makes up his own.  He plays the bass guitar (self-taught) in the church<br/>
band and is teaching himself the acoustic guitar.  He spends much of his<br/>
day, in his room, playing.  He also works at the same restaurant that my 16<br/>
yr. old works at.  He can&#39;t work as many hours, due to his age, but works<br/>
what he can and loves it.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, they aren&#39;t doing anything right now, other than watching<br/>
Netflix at night or playing video games on occasion.  So, since I&#39;m fairly<br/>
clueless, is there something else I should be doing with them?  Critique<br/>
away!<br/>
<br/>

Ray&#39;s 18, so technically he&#39;s not even an unschooler any more, but over the past few years he has done a number of different things. He&#39;s very busy and social, so we spent a lot of time taking him where he wanted to go and helping him get rides when we couldn&#39;t take him. We helped him find places and people and events and the sorts of resources which are useful to him. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, that makes it sound like you can unschool without ever leaving your couch... especially with older teens who often want to be out and doing. Younger teens sometimes go through a kind of cocooning stage where they spend a lot of time by themselves, but older teens tend to want more. Those are big generalizations! but unschooling is first and foremost about being engaged with and responsive to your kids. <br/>
<br/>
Do your teens Want to unschool? If it&#39;s new to them, it may be an intimidating idea, especially if they&#39;re used to a more directed educational program. They might see it as a kind of trick to get them to take more responsibility than they really want, or a way for you to get out of helping them. If you&#39;re not up to helping them do what they want to do, it might be a good idea to brainstorm some options with them - school? an online curriculum? a tutor? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; is there something else I should be doing with them? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good way to start unschooling is to live like you&#39;re on vacation for awhile - since you&#39;ve been doing home-ed, you&#39;ll probably need a solid year or more to deschool, especially the teens. That makes transitioning to unschooling unpractical for the eldest unless he obviously need to spend a Lot of time chilling out. But the rest of the kids - live like you&#39;re on holiday. Get out and do fun things for the fun of it. Throw house parties or hold movie marathons. Spend days window shopping. Spend hours at a &quot;claw&quot; machine. Go to a big event and get goofy temporary tattoos or face paint. Stay up all night playing video games. Live That kind of holiday, with plenty of time chilling out and snuggling, too. <br/>

<br/>

It&#39;s the promised land, if you can get your teenager to sign up for higher education your decisions to rock the boat by homeschooling are validated. Or something like that. I would step back from the belief that he really wants to go to university. Even if it is true, he&#39;s short term goal of having his car be insured are bigger in his picture than the much longer term picture of a bachelor&#39;s degree. Help him to reach his real goals rather than the goals you are hoping are his. <br/>

Make their lives interesting and engaging. Find things to do. Go out more.Watch movies with them on netflix that they haven&#39;t seen or ones that you all love and can quote the dialogue from word for word. Have a party, dance, sing, laugh. Worry less and play more. Unschooling takes you being there with them, you offering cool and fun things to do and exploring the world as their partner. Figure out how to do that by spending lots and lots of time with them and really getting to know who they are right now. <br/>

motivated to do anything &quot;schooly.&quot;  Like, assigning things for them to do,<br/>
which is NOT unschooling, so I need to get over feeling like we&#39;re not<br/>
doing anything, right?  :)  I guess, I thought that at their ages (16 and<br/>
14), I should be doing something more formal with them, even as<br/>
unschoolers.  I guess, I thought that the playing etc. that unschoolers do<br/>
when they&#39;re young, needs to have more focus when they&#39;re older.  Clearly,<br/>
I haven&#39;t fully grasped the concept of unschooling. *<br/>

year old does for sure.  When I talked to them about it, my 14 yr. old<br/>
said, &quot;So, we don&#39;t have to do math anymore?  Good because I hate math!&quot;<br/>
 My 16 yr. old likes the idea, but they both worry about not knowing what<br/>
kids their age know.  That&#39;s when I suggested the Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook (maybe there&#39;s a better one?) that my 16 yr. old asked me to<br/>
&quot;assign&quot; pages for him to read.*<br/>

being WITH them and not just letting them go off and play while I do<br/>
housework or cook or whatever.  It&#39;s hard because my parents weren&#39;t<br/>

*<br/>
*<br/>
*Thank you for taking the time to respond to my email.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*That makes total sense.  Just to clarify, I would be perfectly ok with him<br/>
not going to college.  Whatever he decides to do to support himself in the<br/>
future is ok with me.  I was raised in a family who believed that you<br/>
weren&#39;t good enough (they never said that, that&#39;s just the message that<br/>
came across), if you didn&#39;t go to college and I don&#39;t feel the same way.<br/>
 We were just talking about what he might like to do in the future and he<br/>
said, &quot;Well, if I was going to &quot;real&quot; school, I&#39;d want to go to college.&quot;<br/>
 So, I told him that he can go whether or not he goes to a public school<br/>
and that I could help him figure it all out, if he wants me to.  No<br/>
pressure at all.  I love the idea of talking to him about making goals,<br/>
though.  His own, not mine for him. :) *<br/>

around the house (I&#39;m not at all a clean freak, quite the opposite, but<br/>
with little ones, the house gets messy very easily.) because there&#39;s so<br/>
much to do. With 6 kids (5 at home), the housework never ends.  I will work<br/>
on finding fun things for us to do.  My challenge is that I have teenagers<br/>
and then young children, so their interests are varied.  I&#39;ll have to<br/>
figure out how to make it work for everyone.  What I&#39;ve tried to do is<br/>
spend time with the little ones in the morning and give my teens focused<br/>
attention at night, when the little ones are sleeping.  It&#39;s tough, though,<br/>
because the little ones have me up at dawn and the teens can keep me up<br/>
UNTIL dawn.  LOL.  Of course, I can&#39;t forget my husband.  He wants my<br/>
attention, too.  Phew!  I&#39;m getting tired, just thinking about it.  Thanks<br/>
again for your reply.*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can be for some kids. It depends on their learning style and personality. For some kids it might even look like a college course or two of intense interest. For some kids it might look like deeper, more focused playing. Some kids -- some people -- will always be drawn to knowing a little about lots of things.<br/>
<br/>
Since we can&#39;t know what kids need, sometimes the kids can&#39;t even articulate it, the atmosphere and environment is important in unschooling. And to create that it takes getting to know your kids so you can provide them with support in exploring what interests them and a wealth of opportunities within reach that you believe might appeal to them to expand their interests.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is hard to grasp because it involves understanding the &quot;why&quot; (the principles and purpose of unschooling) so you can figure out the &quot;what&quot; that will work for your family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

(I still read to my 20 yo daughter when she comes back to visit. :-) It was always part of her wake up routine to eat breakfast while I read manga to her in bed.)<br/>
<br/>
You could suggest you try it and if he doesn&#39;t like it, then he can continue to read it on his own.<br/>
