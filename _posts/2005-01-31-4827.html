<div id="ygrps-yiv-357537435">&quot;What if you&#39;re not always out going to this and that museum,<br/>
cultural events, exploring all over the place? We did more of that <br/>
when<br/>
the kids were younger, but my personal interests have gotten more<br/>
aesthetic and my husband&#39;s have only gotten more literary, and the <br/>
kids<br/>
aren&#39;t interested in sharing in what we&#39;re involved with that much.<br/>
They have their own stuff going -- reading, Model United Nations,<br/>
library volunteer work for the eldest; writing, SIMS, fashion design<br/>
for the youngest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends.<br/>
If your kids are happy and they&#39;re aware those things exist, then it <br/>
just might not be important at this stage in life. I&#39;ve found as my <br/>
kids get older, our interests DO get more divergent and I&#39;m off with <br/>
the little ones more often.<br/>
But, if they are interested in these kind of activities, I think <br/>
it&#39;s the parents job to provide them, even if it isn&#39;t a shared <br/>
interest.<br/>
There&#39;s always other families to share these activites with, or <br/>
maybe parents can take turns. There are ways to meet their needs for <br/>
a rich, interesting environment without being the only one to <br/>
provide it.:)<br/>
It sounds like their lives are interesting though, and maybe that&#39;s <br/>
just where you all are right now.<br/>
