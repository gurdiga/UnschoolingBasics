<div id="ygrps-yiv-228729233">I have vines and flowers going around my ankle and onto the top of my foot. Yes, it hurt like crazy. More than my others but in the end it looks beautiful and I love it. I take extra care to put sunscreen on it so that I won&#39;t have to get it redone like I&#39;ve had to do with others that have faded because of sun exposure. It was well worth it. A little while of pain but the outcome is great (and permanent!) <br/>
