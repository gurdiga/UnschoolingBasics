<h4>April</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458823814">Hi! My name is April and I&#39;ve been researching unschooling for my 5<br/>
and 3 yo boys. I&#39;ve joined the AlwaysUnschooled list and really like<br/>
it. I just found this group though, and thought since it was a group<br/>
for newbies, I&#39;d like it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a bit of a problem. I&#39;ve started saying yes more. My boys<br/>
LOVE sweets -- so whenever they&#39;ve been asking for candy or cake or<br/>
whatever, I&#39;ve said yes. The problem started today -- they&#39;ve been<br/>
asking for it ALOT -- and now they&#39;re super cranky. I&#39;ve discussed<br/>
with them *why* they&#39;re cranky -- but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s sinking in. I<br/>
feel like a terrible mom to let my children get this way. What would<br/>
you do? Am I interpereting unschooling the wrong way? Help!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155109144">Peace April,<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself to be one step above newbie because I have only been a radical unschooler for almost a year now.  When I started I was in a similar situation because we started around Halloween and my son threw up as a result of eating candy whenever he wanted.  What I like about unschooling is that it takes the guilt out of it for me and empowers me to provides lots of choices for my children.  I find that they binge most on sweets when I have not put other options out for them.  Initially, I think they ate lots of sweets because they actually could without my input on when to stop.  But now when they eat a lot I don&#39;t say a word, I just get in the kitchen and start pulling out other foods that have little to no sugar and they will almost immediately switch to the food that I am putting out.<br/>
<br/>
I believe for most of us that at the beginning unschooling is more about the parent unschooling themselves.  We have to deprogram our definition of good parenting and replace it with a more intuitive apporach of dealing with our children.  My vote would be that you are not a bad mother, that it is not a bad thing that your children are cranky from eating to much candy.  My vote would be that you are a mother who is in learning mode and whose children are also figuring this freedom to be thing out, too.  I think what you have described is normal.  Children eat too much candy some days. That is no biggie to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best and am so very happy that you are on this beautiful journey to relating to your children in a way that allows both parent and child to truly be who they have come here to be.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>
Tyra<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928716339">So -- first of all, at dinner last night (after the mega candy binge),<br/>
we had penne rustica with garlic bread and broccoli. My 5 yo *asked*<br/>
for a salad. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Then, today, they&#39;ve had ice cream and some dried cherries -- but<br/>
they&#39;ve also eaten scrambled eggs and Annie&#39;s bbq bunnies.<br/>
<br/>
They seem to be balancing it all out pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We love the Annie&#39;s products.  Ever since I started buying the Annie&#39;s<br/>
organic mac and cheese the kids have no interest in the (much cheaper)<br/>
Kraft.  My pocket book says OUCH but my heart says YAY!  I can<br/>
purchase Kraft for 50¢ a box and Annie&#39;s is $1.59-$2.29 (depending on<br/>
if the coop has a sale).   But I have to agree with them that Annie&#39;s<br/>
tastes much better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!!! I didn&#39;t think about how that would sound if you<br/>
didn&#39;t know what Annie&#39;s bunnies were!! They come in cheddar, bbq,<br/>
graham chocolate chip... etc...<br/>
<br/>
BBQ&#39;d bunnies -- now there&#39;s a mental picture. ;P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778121927">Sounds like what my kids have been eating. Breakfast<br/>
of ice cream for some time, followed by scrambled eggs<br/>
and toast. My 4 y.o. also recently asked me to have<br/>
some of my salad and gobbled it up. This from a kid<br/>
who until recently refused to eat anything green other<br/>
than avocaco and cucumber.<br/>
The also love the Annies Cheddar bunnies as a snack on<br/>
the road.<br/>
I also started giving my kids complete freedom to eat<br/>
what and when they want and it has been working out<br/>
wonderfully. The 2 year old would rather have Bok choy<br/>
(or  carrots or eggs) than sweets most any time.<br/>
Love,<br/>
