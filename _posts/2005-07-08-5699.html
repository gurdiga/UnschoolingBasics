<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571304378">**Thank  you for your replies. I still feel it is a lie on some level to<br/>
take what  they are learning and make it fit state regulations. I know my<br/>
sons do too  on some level. So does my family. I worked on changing my<br/>
mind and for the  most part I am satisfied they are learning and I talk<br/>
to them to get them  to understand what they are learning. I don&#39;t mean<br/>
to sound defensive or to  instigate anything by what I am saying. It is<br/>
more another layer of me  working though the old thoughts that were put<br/>
in my head all these years.  ***<br/>

Michele, I think I understand what you are saying about &quot;lying&quot; to the  <br/>
state.  I&#39;ve also had a difficult time resolving that issue in my  mind.  Some of <br/>
us are just more highly sensitive to legalities, lies, fibs,  etc.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even enter a store where it is marked &quot;exit&quot; even if other  people are doing it.  <br/>
:)  <br/>
 <br/>
Those diplomas aren&#39;t going to affect who you children are and whether or  <br/>
not they are successful at their jobs.  Unfortunately, they need them to  get <br/>
their foot in the door, but once they are working, it is up to them to do  the <br/>
work!  Then they will be judged on their performance, not on the  diploma.<br/>
 <br/>
The state doesn&#39;t care who your children are or what they do or don&#39;t do  <br/>
well, really.  They are interested in putting a check next to another name  to <br/>
say they&#39;ve done their job to &quot;educate&quot; them.  No one cares that your  son read <br/>
Moby Dick, but someone thought that was an important thing and now you  are <br/>
&quot;illegal&quot; if you haven&#39;t read it.  If he needs to read it for work, he  can read <br/>
it then. Maybe your sons need a serious discussion about where the  state <br/>
requirements come from and that they have no real importance in their real  <br/>
lives.  Do they feel like they are lying to deceive or that they are  fudging some <br/>
meaningless facts that will never hurt anyone (but necessary in  today&#39;s <br/>
world)?<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps you can get in touch with some unschoolers in your state that have  <br/>
dealt with this also.  Maybe someone knows of some other options that you  <br/>
don&#39;t know about.<br/>
 <br/>
And I agree with Deb that as long as you aren&#39;t passing yourself off to a  <br/>
potential employer as something that you are not, it shouldn&#39;t be an  issue.  It <br/>
is a minor blip on the whole of their lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This depends so much on what the state regulations are. Could you give <br/>
us a sample?<br/>
<br/>
If it is simply to cover various general subjects, like science, <br/>
history, reading, math, etc., then I wouldn&#39;t feel even the slightest <br/>
compunction about translating our real lives into those.<br/>
<br/>
If it specifically says: &quot;Student will learn how Native Americans were <br/>
affected by the arrival of Columbus,&quot; then I wouldn&#39;t be able to say <br/>
that was covered unless it had been, in some form or another.<br/>
<br/>
But the fact that the kids learn in natural ways, not by assignments, <br/>
textbooks, lesson plans, testing, and grading?<br/>
<br/>
A discussion we had last night was about whether or not there was <br/>
sexism in the Harry Potter books - this was spurred by something one of <br/>
the kids read online. To call that discussion &quot;social studies&quot; or <br/>
&quot;language arts&quot; wouldn&#39;t bother me in the slightest. School teachers <br/>
can only DREAM of kids being so involved and interested and PASSIONATE <br/>
about some assigned topic!<br/>
<br/>
Rosie is out riding her bike. Is she not experimenting with the laws of <br/>
motion and gravity and inertia and learning about momentum and <br/>
acceleration and balance and far more? Do those not count? Are they not <br/>
just incredibly valuable things to learn about? There is good reason to <br/>
believe that this kind of physical activity is really truly <br/>
appropriately known as &quot;pre-physics&quot; or &quot;pre-calculus.&quot;<br/>
