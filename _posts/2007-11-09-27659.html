<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402406298">unschoolingbasicsWhy would &quot;the state&quot; be reading your blog? And what are you doing that would make you think anyone should come knocking on your door? Nothing, I would guess. Relax and enjoy. <br/>

I noticed some of you have blogs. I&#39;m thinking abt setting one up so my <br/>
husband and family can keep in touch with what we&#39;re doing and for <br/>
myself to keep track on how we&#39;re going. Some of you have blogs, so I&#39;m <br/>
curious --- since its a public thing, what should I leave public or keep <br/>
out? What would cause the state to come knocking on my door?<br/>
