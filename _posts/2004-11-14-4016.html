There are not too many people who seem to get it around us, and sometimes I let that get to me. But DD always pulls through with something really left field for her age and then I can just sit back and say &quot;and there it is&quot;<br/>

Where do you live?  You know there are none around me.  I drive  sometimes 45 <br/>
minutes to meet up with another unschooler.  But if you can  find even <br/>
someone who is an hour away and you set a date and place to meet in  the middle it <br/>
can make a big difference and it is worth the travel.<br/>

  ******************<br/>
<br/>
  I live in the Dallas Metroplex and my daughter and I travel 45 minutes every Monday to have a play day with another unschooling family over there.  Then on Wednesdays that unschooling family drives all the way back over here or close to here to have park day with a few other unschooling families.  There&#39;s just NOTHING like being in the company of other families on the same path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164719238">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Cindy.  I have two boys ages 14 and 9.  We have been <br/>
unschooling for about a year.  We gradually worked up to unschooling <br/>
because of silly hang ups I had about homeschooling and just plain <br/>
ignorance on the subject.  It has been a wonderful year.  Finally <br/>
school is fitting in with the rest of our lives.  The boys always had <br/>
freedom to make their own decision on everything else in their lives <br/>
except for certain things about school--so school seemed like such a <br/>
drag and disconnected with real life.  Now I understand that real <br/>
life is the best education one can get and it&#39;s real learning not <br/>
useless facts noone ever uses.<br/>
<br/>
I am very excited about joining this group.  I belong to a homeschool <br/>
group, but I find I need to converse with people who have been <br/>
unschooling and can help me on this journey.  My friend, Angela, who <br/>
belongs to this group said that I would find some good mind <br/>
stretching conversations in this group, so it sounds like the group <br/>
for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858624130">&quot; Finally<br/>

<br/>
Hopefully not! Maybe you meant something like &quot;learning is fitting <br/>
in with the rest of our lives.&quot; <br/>
Though I might question that also....because learning just happens <br/>
as part of life when you&#39;re unschooling. It doesn&#39;t need to &quot;fit in&quot; <br/>
to anything.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that release you feel when letting go of schoolish <br/>
things...perhaps that&#39;s what you meant?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, welcome to the group. :)<br/>
You&#39;ll find a lot of radical unschoolers here, and some newer to <br/>
unschooling that love to discuss all aspects of unschooling and how <br/>
it affects all areas of our lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672467257">AlwaysLearning is *my* favorite group, but it&#39;s mainly for those that <br/>
already &quot;get it&quot;---and many of the conversations aren&#39;t remotely <br/>
related to unschooling! &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here, Jenna. I hope we <br/>
can help.<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys: Cameron is 17 and left school at the end of sixth <br/>
grade. Duncan is nine and has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
It has been *MUCH* harder with Cameron because of all that school <br/>
baggage and much needed healing. But he&#39;s a full-blown unschooler now! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for the conference, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re coming. You might want to <br/>
mention to your husband that we have a dads&#39; group: the Secret Society <br/>
of Unschooling Dads (SSUDs). They get together a couple of times during <br/>
the weekend---and no women allowed! &lt;g&gt; We tried it the first year <br/>
*with* moms: the women dominated the conversation and wouldn&#39;t let the <br/>
men get a word in edge-wise. The following year, we let them have their <br/>
own forum, and that has given the men some time to air certain concerns <br/>
and &quot;bond&quot; over the weekend. He could talk about things that are <br/>
bothering him without getting bombarded by women! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, he would be able to see some real, live unschooling teens/young <br/>
adults and lay some fears to rest.<br/>
<br/>
And we have two men speaking this year. Ben will be back, and we have <br/>
Wes Beach---who can show him that unschooling *can* work! He helps <br/>
teens turn their exciting unschooling lives into resumes and college <br/>
portfolios.<br/>
<br/>
Many men seem to prefer other men as examples. You won&#39;t find so many <br/>
unschooling dads in one place ever!<br/>

Welcome Jenna!<br/>
I&#39;m a lurker too, the always learning groups IS for more experienced <br/>
unschoolers, but I learn alot from that site by just reading (and not <br/>
posting!).  This is a good group for those of us new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 12 and has always been in school.  We&#39;ll be homeschooling <br/>
for the first time this fall.   I&#39;ve been reading and researching <br/>
homeschooling for about 2 years, and found unschooling and really <br/>
feel it&#39;s the best thing for my daughter.  My husband is supportive, <br/>
even though he doesn&#39;t really understand unschooling, he does know <br/>
pulling her out of school is the best thing for her (he struggled in <br/>
school too).<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading (have you checked out unschooling.info, unschooling.com <br/>
etc?).   Read any John Holt (there&#39;s tons of books - mine are still <br/>
in boxes, we moved a while back and haven&#39;t unpacked them yet - I <br/>
miss them!).<br/>

   I don&#39;t know if there is a button really or not.  He is a <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What were you doing before? School? or school-at-home?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s waaay too early for proof too.  They need to heal first <br/>
and realize again that learning is fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be up to you to provide something tangible for him. <br/>
Lists of topics you discuss, books/articles/groceries you read, words <br/>
you spell for them or discuss, grammar that you point out or hear them <br/>
use correctly,  math that *you* see (physics, geometry, addition, <br/>
whatever that happens during the day---OH! Have you seen Luz Shosie&#39;s <br/>
math list? I&#39;ll look for it and send it in another e-mail.) .<br/>
<br/>
Keep a journal and write down what happens during the day. Put it in <br/>
&quot;educationese&quot; if you have to.<br/>
<br/>
Professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc.) seem to have a harder time <br/>
grasping this concept more than others because, like you said, that&#39;s <br/>
all they&#39;ve known.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re coming to the conference, right? Is he coming too?<br/>
