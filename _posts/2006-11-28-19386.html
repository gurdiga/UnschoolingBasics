<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448039022">Hello. I think that Cosleeping has been addressed on this group <br/>
before so I am bringing a question that has me troubled. I/we co-<br/>
sleep w/ our three and 1/2 yr old son and almost 2 yr old daughter <br/>
and we are all happy with this practice. My daughter still nurses on <br/>
and off all night (only nurses at bedtime and during night as I have <br/>
weaned her off daytime nursing). Well... My Mother In Law this <br/>
morning on the phone when I was discussing a totally different <br/>
problem in my life with her, said she had some advice for me that <br/>
she knew wasn&#39;t her business but that she just felt compelled to <br/>
talk to me about anyway. Then she launched into how she thought <br/>
I &quot;just need to get the kids out of our bed&quot; and how &quot;it&#39;s not good <br/>
for the kids nor for your marriage&quot; and how &quot;kids should see that <br/>
their parents are a separate unit from themselves and that they <br/>
don&#39;t need to see themselves as part of the marrital unit&quot; (or <br/>
something like that?) and how &quot;sleeping with them is more for YOU <br/>
than it is for THEM&quot; and how they&#39;re never going to grow into self <br/>
reliant individuals if I keep them in our bed etc etc etc, yatta <br/>
yatta yatta... As usual, my blood pressure went right up and I just <br/>
kept stammering &quot;I&#39;ll give it some thought&quot; etc etc. I never know <br/>
what to say to her when she goes off like that. As you can imagine, <br/>
she is also against homeschooling as well, but that is another <br/>
issue. What do you all say to the naysayers in your lives re: <br/>
cosleeping or attachement parenting or whatnot. I&#39;ve asked the same <br/>
sort of question before when she lambbasted me about homeschooling <br/>
being a bad idea... Maybe I should just talking with her? Hard for <br/>
me though &#39;cause she&#39;s been more of a mother to me for my whole <br/>
marriage (15yrs) than my own Mom, who I was astranged for like 8yrs. <br/>
(yet ANOTHER story). Advice please!</div>

<br/>
Try not to take it personally, as she is only expressing her opinion.  That opinion is something that seems not to work for you.  Attachment Parenting International has many support groups and maybe there is one in your area that could help.  Here in Nashville, we discussed this very topic just this last meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Remember...it&#39;s what works for your immediate family.  I have found just thanking the individual for their concern (even restating what they have just said) and then dropping it to work best when dealing with my own relatives.  They are not going to suddenly change their minds, and the have been given the opportunity to explore other ways of living.  Nothing I say is going to change their opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to your heart, it&#39;s already telling you what you need to do.  Differences in opinion don&#39;t have to lead to astrangement of family or friends.<br/>

in the past.  I have changed my behavior which has helped.  I no <br/>
longer talk/discuss matters so close to my heart.  I remind myself <br/>
to keep the conversation bases on &quot;light touch&quot; topics.  I too have <br/>
a mother in law that is more like a mom.  I have learned through <br/>
many conversations that she was not going to give me the 100% <br/>
approval that I wanted.  So, gradually I learned what was safe to <br/>
discuss with her and what wasn&#39;t.  Now, our relationship has grown <br/>
tremendously.  She supports me and she doesn&#39;t know the details.  <br/>
She knows general things and if she askes me for specifics, I rarely <br/>
give them.  It was  difficult at first and sometimes I slip and <br/>
discuss something I regret(something I feel very strongly about). I <br/>
am only sharing my situation, but I am happier. Now, I discuss my <br/>
holistic parenting/unschooling with people that are safe.  I rarely <br/>
have heated discussions and that I am grateful for!  Good luck to <br/>
you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475283400">Somebody had said (don&#39;t know if it was this particular subject or another subject) to ask the person to do some research on the subject before you would be willing to have a discussion about the subject.  That makes sense to me.  I would ask her to do some research (and not just cons against cosleeping) but about pros and cons of cosleeping, and then you could talk about it.  But ultimately these children belong to you and your husband.....the two of you have to decide how to best raise them.  Honestly, your children won&#39;t still be sleeping with you when they are 25.  I think nurturing and loving them in this way at their ages are a beautiful thing!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857340369">Hello again all,<br/>
   I just wanted to thank everyone for their comments and support and to tell you I wrote my MIL an e-mail telling her that, while I appreciate her concern and realize that she likely just voiced it because she wants what is best for us and our kids, that we are going to continue to co-sleep as long as it is working for us and that right now, it&#39;s working. I don&#39;t know how she&#39;ll &#39;take it&#39; but I have decided that it&#39;s time to grow a backbone and call her on what feel like &#39;potshots&#39; to my parenting style and choices. As many of you have said, these are my kids and I need to raise them in the way&#39;s I believe, that she has &#39;had her chance&#39; with raising kids. I am very happy to have found this group so it can help soothe my fears when I hear such things and get a bit &#39;uneasy&#39;. Have a lovely day everyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827289988">Our two youngest are 2 and 1 and the littlest co-sleeps every night, <br/>
the 2yo only sometimes either with me or our 13yo ds.  The past few <br/>
months the 1yo has started tossing and turning, which doesn&#39;t bother <br/>
me at all, but keeps my dh up all night so he&#39;s taken to sleeping <br/>
whereever he feels comfortable - the 2yo&#39;s twin bed, the couch, our <br/>
oldest&#39;s bed when he&#39;s not home... Our dd (1yo) still does most of <br/>
her nursing at night, like every 2-3 hours, we both sleep through <br/>
it ... ah, the joys of co-sleeping.  My dh could care less about <br/>
where he sleeps and finds the nursing much more important and <br/>
realizes this too shall pass when the time is right.  So we&#39;re all <br/>
happy with the situation. <br/>
<br/>
I, however, made the stupid mistake of casually mentioning this in <br/>
conversation with some relatives.  Now I&#39;m privy to all sorts of <br/>
unsolicited advice and judgement.  My sister thinks it&#39;s awful that <br/>
our 2yo is allowed to sleep with me in bed, in his own bed, on our <br/>
bedroom floor, camping in the living room or anywhere he decides <br/>
he&#39;s comfortable.  She thinks he needs &quot;routine.&quot;  I say, this IS <br/>
our routine and we&#39;re all pretty happy with it.  Am I crazy?  Does <br/>
anyone here thing 2yo is too young to have this kind of freedom?  He <br/>
gets plenty of sleep, is healthy, very active and so happy complete <br/>
strangers comment on a regular basis on what a happy, loving he <br/>
child he is.<br/>
<br/>
My aunt thinks we&#39;re sabotaging our marriage and won&#39;t ever have <br/>
time for intimacy (as adults, we&#39;ve figured this one out too!). Has <br/>
anyone else had this in their marriage?  We seem to be doing fine, <br/>
but they&#39;ve made me feel like I&#39;m making all the wrong choices and <br/>
will pay for it later in irreversible consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525914550">Thanks to everyone for all the great words of encouragement.  We only <br/>
pulled our kids out of ps a year ago and it&#39;s been such an evolution  <br/>
learning who we are and what makes us happy.  I really enjoy lurking <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You could offer her some details on the intimacy of your marriage if <br/>

<br/>
Oh my!  After I stopped laughing, I realized you are right. I&#39;m just <br/>
ornery enough to try that one. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My husband and i will have many years to sleep together by ourselves <br/>

<br/>
Yes! Yes! This is how we feel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Secondly its important to remember our culture sees sleeping<br/>
 </span></blockquote>arrangements as sexual. Where as in most cultures outside western<br/>
civilization they see it as a social thing.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there are probably a number of things we do in our family that <br/>
more traditional western folks would see a sexual, which I think is a <br/>
ridiculous notion.  Our oldest ds was there when our youngest was <br/>
born.  It fantastically educational experience for him, but more <br/>
importantly a bonding experience both between us and him and him and <br/>
his sister.  He proudly says, &quot;I&#39;m the first face she saw!&quot;  Others <br/>
think we&#39;re weird because I let my 12yo ds watch me give birth.  I <br/>
don&#39;t care about what they think about that though, so it&#39;s funny that <br/>
I&#39;ve been unable to break the conditioning of where/when/with whom we <br/>
should all be sleeping when we&#39;re perfectly happy.<br/>
<br/>
I too, remember not wanting to go to bed and it had nothing to do with <br/>
not wanting to go to sleep.  I just didn&#39;t like being alone in my <br/>
cold, dark room!  I hadn&#39;t thought about this, but it brings back a <br/>
lot of memories I don&#39;t want my children to have.<br/>
<br/>
This has really been bugging me and I appreciate the support.  I will <br/>
*try* to work on worrying less and just letting things be.  I think <br/>
that&#39;s the biggest lesson I continually learn lurking here... :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420788835">I&#39;m a bit behind so I&#39;ll be brief. <br/>
This week a friend and I did an interview for the news on unschooling(it  <br/>
hasn&#39;t aired yet..next week).<br/>
The reporter was talking to us off camera about her 13 mo. She asked about  <br/>
co sleeping and then told us her friends read the experts books on parenting.  <br/>
She said her 13 mo slept with them (I can&#39;t recall if she said full time? I <br/>
was  still trying to get air as I was nervous AND she had a mic pack in her hand <br/>
so I  was wondering about that).<br/>
Anyway.. She said she was uneasy about sharing that with her friends as  they <br/>
may find issue with it. <br/>
At 37 I think I have been in her shoes however.. now 4 children later  it <br/>
sounded so odd that she would feel such outside pressure and that her  friendship <br/>
was based on agreement. <br/>
I was shocked when I said it but it did fall out of my face.  I  told her <br/>
that I learned over the years that people don&#39;t need to know everything  and if <br/>
you know they are going to take issue don&#39;t bother telling them. <br/>
She seemed a bit more not so odd and her face relaxed. <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s hard for some to relate to emotionally attached parenting(if  <br/>
those are the right words). Or maybe they have regrets about their own  <br/>
parenting? Thing is you may never know unless they share it. What people say in  the <br/>
moment when they are judging is often not really their position, it&#39;s more  <br/>
fear.. <br/>
 <br/>
. I wish you the best in those conversations and I know family can be like  <br/>
feeding starving dogs but maybe they will, with your help, move on to a new  <br/>
stage in life. If not spare yourself the comments and smile. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270702430">Robin,<br/>
 <br/>
 I feel your pain... I asked the same sort of question of the group <br/>
about a week ago myself after my Mother-In-Law took me to task yet <br/>
again for our co-sleeping with our kids. (son 3.5 and daughter <br/>
almost 2) My daughter still nurses at night and my son is a very <br/>
sensitive little guy who just sleeps better with us (he wakes up on <br/>
occaision still and, finding us there ready to rub his back or hold <br/>
his hand, goes back to sleep pretty much right away) I took the <br/>
advice of many on the group and addressed it with my MIL. I wrote <br/>
her an e-mail and attached several co-sleeping articles that someone <br/>
had sent me the link to that talked about the benefits of <br/>
cosleeping. I am not sure she read them, but now that I&#39;ve sent them <br/>
to her, I don&#39;t plan to ever let her bring it up with me again. I <br/>
thought it was great, the person who commented that &#39;if she&#39;s <br/>
worried about your sex life, you could give her the details and <br/>
that&#39;d shut her up pretty quick&#39;... Laughed out loud at that one! I <br/>
think, even if we didn&#39;t co-sleep with our kids, or especially if we <br/>
didn&#39;t, we&#39;d still have to be &#39;creative&#39; about our sex life at this <br/>
stage of our lives (having small kids). If we didn&#39;t cosleep, I <br/>
suspect that bedtime would be such a stressful time that after we <br/>
finally &#39;fought the kids&#39; into bed, we&#39;d likely be so drained that <br/>
we&#39;d be like &#39;forget it, I am tired!&quot; LOL! B/t/w my husband also <br/>
sleeps on the couch or in the &#39;kids room&#39; sometimes... He&#39;s been an <br/>
insomniac his whole life (hmmmm... Wonder if he&#39;d have had that <br/>
problem if his parents had EVER let him have a bit of comfort at <br/>
night, but I digress...) and so he sort of sleeps where he CAN <br/>
sleep... But he&#39;s been that way our whole marriage (15yrs) and our <br/>
kids are only 3.5 and ~2, so I don&#39;t see how they or cosleeping <br/>
could be &#39;blamed&#39; for that...<br/>
<br/>
What irritates me, and has been on my mind lately, is that many of <br/>
the naysayers I&#39;ve read about are (I suspect and I know my MIL is) <br/>
from the &#39;Babyboomer&#39; Generation. (I am 34, a Gen-Xr myself) That <br/>
was a generation that SUPPOSEDLY prided themselves on &#39;thinking <br/>
outside the box&#39; and &#39;questioning convention&#39; etc etc etc... Well... <br/>
I suppose that must&#39;ve only applied to questioning the convention&#39;s <br/>
that THEY wanted to... Since my MIL and many of her generation seem <br/>
to come unglued at the thought of long-term nursing, co-sleeping, <br/>
homeschooling (or God Forbid! Unschooling!!!). Yet the same people <br/>
seem to have no problem with the practice of dropping a 6wk old <br/>
child off in Daycare (or Paycare or whatever you want to call it) <br/>
and I am sure that the same people wouldn&#39;t be as shocked if your <br/>
son had gone and gotten some girl pregnant at 12 than they were at <br/>
him watching his Mum bring his sister in the world... Ok... Who&#39;s on <br/>
a rant now? Me! Guilty! I will probably get cross words from some <br/>
people for such broad generalizations, but I was just musing about <br/>
these things and as I sat down to type a response, out they came... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103260690">You have been married for 15 years, since you were 19 by my calculations........yet your MIL is worried about your marriage because the kids are sleeping in your bed.  I think 15 years speaks for itself.  I think if the marriage was gonna be in trouble it would not have anything to do with the kids in your bed.  Like someone said people think of the bed as sexual type of place, when that stuff can happen other places.  But same goes for the marriage in general........the marriage does not just exist in the bedroom only.  <br/>

I feel your pain... I asked the same sort of question of the group <br/>
about a week ago myself after my Mother-In-Law took me to task yet <br/>
again for our co-sleeping with our kids. (son 3.5 and daughter <br/>
almost 2) My daughter still nurses at night and my son is a very <br/>
sensitive little guy who just sleeps better with us (he wakes up on <br/>
occaision still and, finding us there ready to rub his back or hold <br/>
his hand, goes back to sleep pretty much right away) I took the <br/>
advice of many on the group and addressed it with my MIL. I wrote <br/>
her an e-mail and attached several co-sleeping articles that someone <br/>
had sent me the link to that talked about the benefits of <br/>
cosleeping. I am not sure she read them, but now that I&#39;ve sent them <br/>
to her, I don&#39;t plan to ever let her bring it up with me again. I <br/>
thought it was great, the person who commented that &#39;if she&#39;s <br/>
worried about your sex life, you could give her the details and <br/>
that&#39;d shut her up pretty quick&#39;... Laughed out loud at that one! I <br/>
think, even if we didn&#39;t co-sleep with our kids, or especially if we <br/>
didn&#39;t, we&#39;d still have to be &#39;creative&#39; about our sex life at this <br/>
stage of our lives (having small kids). If we didn&#39;t cosleep, I <br/>
suspect that bedtime would be such a stressful time that after we <br/>
finally &#39;fought the kids&#39; into bed, we&#39;d likely be so drained that <br/>
we&#39;d be like &#39;forget it, I am tired!&quot; LOL! B/t/w my husband also <br/>
sleeps on the couch or in the &#39;kids room&#39; sometimes... He&#39;s been an <br/>
insomniac his whole life (hmmmm... Wonder if he&#39;d have had that <br/>
problem if his parents had EVER let him have a bit of comfort at <br/>
night, but I digress...) and so he sort of sleeps where he CAN <br/>
sleep... But he&#39;s been that way our whole marriage (15yrs) and our <br/>
kids are only 3.5 and ~2, so I don&#39;t see how they or cosleeping <br/>
could be &#39;blamed&#39; for that...<br/>
<br/>
What irritates me, and has been on my mind lately, is that many of <br/>
the naysayers I&#39;ve read about are (I suspect and I know my MIL is) <br/>
from the &#39;Babyboomer&#39; Generation. (I am 34, a Gen-Xr myself) That <br/>
was a generation that SUPPOSEDLY prided themselves on &#39;thinking <br/>
outside the box&#39; and &#39;questioning convention&#39; etc etc etc... Well... <br/>
I suppose that must&#39;ve only applied to questioning the convention&#39;s <br/>
that THEY wanted to... Since my MIL and many of her generation seem <br/>
to come unglued at the thought of long-term nursing, co-sleeping, <br/>
homeschooling (or God Forbid! Unschooling!!!). Yet the same people <br/>
seem to have no problem with the practice of dropping a 6wk old <br/>
child off in Daycare (or Paycare or whatever you want to call it) <br/>
and I am sure that the same people wouldn&#39;t be as shocked if your <br/>
son had gone and gotten some girl pregnant at 12 than they were at <br/>
him watching his Mum bring his sister in the world... Ok... Who&#39;s on <br/>
a rant now? Me! Guilty! I will probably get cross words from some <br/>
people for such broad generalizations, but I was just musing about <br/>
these things and as I sat down to type a response, out they came... <br/>

<br/>
 Amen! We&#39;ve &#39;survived&#39; in our marriage through my hubby bein&#39; in <br/>
the Army for four of them (and he was gone through deployements etc <br/>
for two of those years) and adjusting to civilian life (after four <br/>
yrs of Army and our whole lives as Military &#39;Brats&#39;) and moves <br/>
across the country and changing careers etc etc etc... I am pretty <br/>
sure that our sleeping arraingements won&#39;t be the death of our <br/>
marriage... ;) Not to mention, we got married as &#39;teenagers&#39; and <br/>
everyone at our wedding thought we&#39;d be done in 6mnths at that <br/>
point, so I think we&#39;re here to &#39;stay&#39; as a couple. Too bad she <br/>
(MIL) can&#39;t have a little more faith in that... But I am not <br/>
worrying about it anymore. Just going to live my life, our lives, in <br/>
ways that make us happy and try and ignore people&#39;s &#39;reviews&#39;. One <br/>
nice thing about having been married 15 yrs (and since I was 18, [I <br/>
just turned 34 last month) is that it helps you put time in <br/>
perspective... It feels like just yesterday I GOT MARRIED and by <br/>
those calculations, our kids will also be grown in a blink of an eye <br/>
and I&#39;ll be missing them, not only the sweet cuddles we have as we <br/>
all wake up, but them being in our home as before I know it, they&#39;ll <br/>
be off living thier own lives. Thank God I listen to my gut and <br/>
enjoy my sweet babies despite &#39;naysayers&#39;! ;)<br/>
