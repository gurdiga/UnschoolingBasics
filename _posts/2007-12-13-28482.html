<div id="ygrps-yiv-496960984">My son, who is allergic to cow dairy, has recently<br/>
shown that he can tolerate goat dairy.  While I don&#39;t<br/>
mind paying more for things like goat yogurt or goat<br/>
ice cream, I think it&#39;s crazy that I&#39;m paying $4 or<br/>
more for a quart of goat milk at the grocery store. I<br/>
live in southeast Michigan right next to Toledo Ohio,<br/>
and I have been searching the past week for anyone who<br/>
lives near me who has dairy goats. I understand that<br/>
the law is that the owner cannot give us goat milk,<br/>
but if we have a share of the goat, we can receive<br/>
some of its milk.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m asking everywhere... if you know a person who<br/>
lives near Toledo Ohio who has dairy goats who would<br/>
be interested in a goat share, can you please contact<br/>
me? I think my son would love to own part of a goat<br/>
anyways (he&#39;s a big animal lover) and it would be a<br/>
great load off my mind. Thanks again.<br/>
