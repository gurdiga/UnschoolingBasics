<div id="ygrps-yiv-740922164">Thanks, ya&#39;ll, for the feedback. Today was day #1 with my cousin&#39;s <br/>
dtr. Lucky for me, I developed a sinus infection (overnight), have <br/>
newly developed cysts on my ovaries which prevent me from walking <br/>
without being on my tiptoes, and am in the midst of my monthly <br/>
cycle. (Don&#39;t pity me, I did this to myself ;) <br/>
<br/>
Lucky for her, I am more patient when I am sick.<br/>
<br/>
Her temperment is SOOOO different from my kids&#39;, I do have a hard <br/>
time understanding how to handle it. Thanks for the insight that it <br/>
may be &#39;sensitivity&#39; rather than a deliberate attempt to be <br/>
difficult. That&#39;s what I felt today when for the 27th time she <br/>
didn&#39;t like the way I did something. Not ONE thing pleased her from <br/>
the time she awoke. And considering how bend-over-backward-nice I am <br/>
to my kids, when I can be, nonstop complaints work on me.<br/>
<br/>
Well, despite the fact she had 3 minor tantrums (5 sec of screaming <br/>
and kicking something) and 3 major tantrums (5 min+ of screaming, <br/>
kicking, and running to throw herself on the bed), today went better <br/>
than last visit. Only by how I handled things. I didn&#39;t take things <br/>
personally, and I stayed out of her way, only intervening if I heard <br/>
bickering that lasted more than a few seconds. Only 2 of the <br/>
tantrums was I present for, and my &#39;no&#39; was the cause-of. The <br/>
tantrums are not my main concern. The lying and deceitful behavior <br/>
troubles me. I&#39;ve caught her in 4 blatant lies in 2 days. I honestly <br/>
have lost trust in her words, as well as her intentions. That&#39;s what <br/>
I struggle with most, though I didn&#39;t put my finger on it until now. <br/>
Deceit and disregard for others are both hot-buttons for me, and she <br/>
does both.<br/>
<br/>
But HOW you instill honesty and courtesy...it can&#39;t be done in 3 <br/>
days by someone else.  (A to Q:her mom is so blessed honest and <br/>
courteous...her dad, well, mmmmm...like father, like daughter.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try her mom&#39;s suggested 1-2-3-timeout method tomorrow. And <br/>
after discussing the day with my cousin, she asked her husband to <br/>
call tomorrow to check on things during his lunch break. If she&#39;s <br/>
having the same kind-of day, they&#39;ll make other arrangements for the <br/>
remainder of the week (he&#39;ll take off work to watch her.)It doesn&#39;t <br/>
fix the problem HERE, but I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a problem that <br/>
I can fix no matter how long she stays.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, guys, for discussing this subject with me. Your <br/>
perspectives help a bundle, and just talking about it helps me find <br/>
solutions sometimes.<br/>
 <br/>
