<div id="ygrps-yiv-692619121">I hope you all don&#39;t mind my asking for recommendations.  My dd, who&#39;s <br/>
11, has been thinking a lot lately about the meat she eats, mostly due <br/>
to animal cruelty. She has always had an affinity for animals.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some very knowdedgeable people here, and I am asking <br/>
if anyone can recommend a website or two that offers good information <br/>
without being too scare-mongering or too descriptive of animal <br/>
cruelty.  For example, she loves chicken and eggs, and she wants to <br/>
know if the chickens are treated badly and if free-range really means <br/>
what it says. <br/>
<br/>
I will also look myself, of course, but hey, I might miss some great <br/>
site that some of you already know!  I admit that I&#39;m not very well-<br/>
informed on the subject, since it is not very important to me.  But <br/>
I&#39;m sure that soon I&#39;ll know a lot more :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34976611">&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.themeatrix.com/&quot;">http://www.themeatrix.com/&quot;</a>&gt;The Meatrix&lt;/A&gt;  My sister just sent this one to me recently. I&#39;ve watched the <br/>
video (cute, informative and sadly true) but haven&#39;t really had the chance to <br/>
check out the site much yet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.localharvest.org/&quot;">http://www.localharvest.org/&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.localharvest.org/&lt;/A">http://www.localharvest.org/&lt;/A</a>&gt;  Great website to help you in finding  local <br/>
and/or organic food, farmers markets, family farms etc. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eatwild.com/&quot;">http://www.eatwild.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Eat Wild&lt;/A&gt; LOTS of great info. on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what area you are in but there is a great place in Argentine called <br/>
Westwinds Milling Co. that grows and grinds all it&#39;s own organic grains, <br/>
raises organic beef, etc. and also has lots of other goodies that they sell from <br/>
local organic farmers depending on the season. If it&#39;s not too far out of the <br/>
way for you it&#39;s a great place to visit. It is an old mill that was built back <br/>
in the late 1800s that this family bought a few yrs back and got it up and <br/>
running again. There is also a book store (and the owner is an UNSCHOOLER too!:o) <br/>
and a pastry shop that uses the mills organic products.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps!<br/>

unschooling list here in my state of Mi. Soooo sorry about that, guess it would be an <br/>
awful long drive for most of you!<br/>
