Dear all,<br/>
Last evening my DH brought home a night lamp and it was wrapped up in <br/>
a newspaper. he came home and tried to lure DS abt the suprised in the <br/>
packet. DS ran behind him and DH kept running away...to an extent that <br/>
he cried. DH kept laughing....finally giving in to the tantrum...he <br/>
showed the lamp and a the tantrum subsided. This is a very recurring <br/>
play pattern than my DH take up. AND I AM JUST NOT OKAY WITH IT! I am <br/>
also not able to reason it out to him...pls help, maybe one of u could <br/>
be able to express better than me as to how this tease-play pattern is <br/>
not healthy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My family (dad in particular) also think that teasing children until <br/>
they cry is fun.  I had to put a stop to that fast!  It&#39;s easier to <br/>
do with my family because I can simply say cut it out or we won&#39;t <br/>
come visit anymore! With a husband, not so easy.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to explain to him that his behavior is harming his <br/>
relationship with his son, and that even if he can&#39;t see it now, <br/>
there will likely be implications down the road.  What seems like <br/>
innocent fun to him is not fun at all for your son.  Your son needs <br/>
to see his father as someone he can depend on, as someone he can <br/>
count on to help him meet his needs and to take care of him.  He <br/>
needs to be able to TRUST his father.  This kind of thing undermines <br/>
that feeling of trust and sets up a situation where, from the child&#39;s <br/>
point of view, the father, his father, is simply not trustworthy, not <br/>
dependable, and who can&#39;t be counted on.  I think this kind of thing <br/>
makes deep changes to the level of security the child feels with the <br/>
father and can possibly cause the child to withdraw emotionally from <br/>
his father.  That&#39;s not cool.  What must your son be <br/>
thinking/feeling - daddy will give me something nice but not until I <br/>
cry!  How awful and how confusing emotionally for him.<br/>
<br/>
Go out and buy your dh a present.  Something nice.  Tell him you <br/>
bought it.  Hide it in the house.  Don&#39;t let him know where it is.  <br/>
Tease him about it constantly, day after day.  Boy, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll <br/>
really love what I got you!  I&#39;ll bet you wish you could have it.  <br/>
And don&#39;t give it to him until he cries!  That should teach him.</div>

directly about it. See if he&#39;ll stop responding.<br/>
