<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110435618">I second the Mona Brookes book, but don&#39;t try to use it in the format<br/>
she lays out. Just dabble with her ideas. I really found her chart of<br/>
basic shapes helpful. We posted that and my children can now look at<br/>
things and break them down into their basic shapes (angled line, curvy<br/>
line etc..) so it doesn&#39;t seem as intimidating when they want to draw<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Art isn&#39;t about drawing things realistically though, that&#39;s just one<br/>
tool you might want to have. Art is expression! Maybe she&#39;s had some<br/>
idea that art is supposed to look a certain way? Has there been stress<br/>
surrounding artistic adventures in the past? <br/>
<br/>
If she has received input about the &quot;right&quot; way to do things, that<br/>
could be part of the problem. If she believes art is trying to<br/>
realistically execute things we see, that could be part of the<br/>
problem. If she&#39;s simply frustrated by her skill level not matching<br/>
her vision, well, she&#39;s an artist!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Let her know that for every work of art a person is happy with, they<br/>
throw away or are frustated by about 10 other works!  As you work with<br/>
materials, it does get easier to manipulate them in ways that make you<br/>
satisfied. Part of being an artist, is being frustrated. That isn&#39;t<br/>
easy for a young person to understand though.<br/>
<br/>
Try to find activities that are more about the experience, not any<br/>
outcome. Set up some materials where she doesn&#39;t have to see you make<br/>
anything.  Time creating together can be balanced with time spent<br/>
creating on your own. You can be present nearby, but not actively<br/>
creating with her and that might help...(or not).<br/>
<br/>
Art at a young age should really be about exploration. You might have<br/>
a bit of a perfectionist on your hands, in that case, accepting her<br/>
frustration and letting her own the process is about all you can do<br/>
aside from setting up materials that invite open ended creation.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a book I&#39;ve been meaning to buy. Check out this site:<br/>

She&#39;s a wonderful artist, but look at her book &quot;Everyday Art For<br/>
Kids&quot;, I think it sounds awesome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523429488">My son is 4 and we face the perfectionist artist pretty frequently.<br/>
I tend to revert to more &quot;physical&quot; art at these times like play-<br/>
dough, finger paints, lots of stickers and bulky building vs. pencils <br/>
or markers. Getting back to exploring the materials instead of trying <br/>
to make something in particular really helps us.<br/>
He used to do all kinds of drawings when he was 3 and has now <br/>
essentially given them up.<br/>

&quot;Preschool Art: It&#39;s the Process, Not the Product&quot; is great!<br/>
