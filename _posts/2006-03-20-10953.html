effective on such and such date, I would be refusing special services  <br/>
as stated in our IEP. Your other option would be to call an emergency  <br/>
IEP meeting and such tell the school admin at that meeting that you  <br/>
are pursuing other educational avenues. Have a letter saying that as  <br/>

the one year he was in ps (kindie)  I decided against it as I knew I would<br/>
end up hsing him at some point and didn&#39;t want the &quot;blueprint&quot; and label<br/>

going to unschool?  We don&#39;t use a guideline to determine what our children<br/>
&quot;need&quot; to know.  They learn what they need when they need it.  eip&#39;s are<br/>
used by the school system so that they can &quot;catch up&quot; the &quot;special ed kids&quot;<br/>
with the rest of their grade level.  It&#39;s to make THEIR life eaiser, not<br/>
your child&#39;s!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has been labeled.  You have labeled her.  Your frustration has labelled<br/>
her as well.  She probably has the mindset that she can&#39;t do it.  What are<br/>
her interests?  What does she want to do?  My son wants to be a chef with a<br/>
small garden. That&#39;s his life goal (at almost 8 yo and I wouldn&#39;t doubt it<br/>
that he achieves that goal!)  Guess what we do?  We do lots of cooking,<br/>
baking, poaching, kneading, boiling, and herb gardening.  He may never be<br/>
&quot;on track&quot; with other people his age, but the boy will know how to cook :)<br/>
What does your daughter want to do?  What interests her and sparks her<br/>
creativity?  Focus on that.  When she has need of working out problems she<br/>
will.  It might surprise you that she *can* work out problems like her math<br/>
word problems, but they relate to the things that she is interested in.  We<br/>
do that as adults.  Most of us given a grade school word problem would<br/>
probably balk at it, but we can figure out how much food to make for dinner,<br/>
how many stitches we need to increase on a knitting project, and how much<br/>
money it is going to take with the current gas prices to go on that vacation<br/>
to grandma&#39;s house next month.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just have run out of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make her understand concepts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What concepts do you think she is not getting?  Does she need those concepts<br/>
or does the school system with its arbitrary list of &quot;should knows&quot; think<br/>
she needs those concepts?<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how not only will she get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;diploma&quot; but more importantly how is she going to make it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; life if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she cant reason.She can not do any word problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she need to be able to do word problems.  World problems are fairly<br/>
abstract to many people.  &quot;Jenny has 5 peaches.  June has 7 peaches.  Mary<br/>
has 2 peaches.  A pie needs 3 peaches.  How many pies can Jenny, June and<br/>
Mary make with their peaches and how many pies does each girl get to take<br/>
home based on her contribution?&quot;  ACK!! Who the heck cares about Jenny, June<br/>
and Mary, their pies or how many THEY can make??  We don&#39;t work that way in<br/>
real life.  In real life Jenny, June and Mary would get together and put all<br/>
their peaches into as many pies as they could and most likely would evenly<br/>
divide them pu between the 3 of them because Mary may have donated the pie<br/>
shells and all the cooking was done at June&#39;s house and the only thing Jenny<br/>
contributed was peaches!  See, for some of us there is a lot of missing<br/>
information to this word problem.  There are other factors that aren&#39;t<br/>
brought up.  But a peach pie sounds really good right now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Whether your daughter needs a &quot;diploma&quot; (which BTW can be printed on most<br/>
any home computer)and the ability to figure out word problems is all going<br/>
to depend on what SHE wants to do in life.  There are hundreds of careers<br/>
that she could go into (including motherhood) where a diploma and the<br/>
ability to solve word problems isn&#39;t going to be a factor at all!  And if<br/>
she does want to go into a career that requires she have a diploma and be<br/>
able to solve word problems, then she will find a way to make that happen.<br/>
My middle child wants to take over the world and thinks that her best<br/>
vantage point will be Switzerland, so she is teaching herself French,<br/>
Italian and German so she will be able to better communicate in<br/>
Switzerland.  (Yes; Ren, be afraid!  Be very afraid!)  Since your daughter<br/>
is a teenager, I would recommend the Teenage Liberation Handbook for both of<br/>
you!<br/>

My son had an IEP when he came out of 4th grade. It was my understanding that the IEP was binding for what the school had to provide for him, not what I had to do or prove to the school. Once I sent in my notification to homeschool, the IEP was dissolved. I was now in charge of his education.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t be scared. It&#39;s all okay. Really. Your daughter&#39;s not broken and you don&#39;t have to fix her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have read so much on the topic and understand the idea but you see my oldest is a special child.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re all special. :o) That&#39;s the beauty of unschooling. Each child can live fully to their own unique talents and potential. You may find something useful in an article I once wrote on this very topic. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/mary">http://sandradodd.com/special/mary</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Since she has been h/s ed her whole life she has never been tested or labeled but she has a terrible time with schoolwork.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then I would stop the schoolwork and focus on what she loves, on what she&#39;s passionate about, on what makes her shine. Life is not about schoolwork. School is about schoolwork. How is your daughter doing in other, real areas of her life?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t *make* someone understand something. Either they&#39;re ready, willing and interested in learning something or you&#39;re just wasting your time. When I stopped trying so hard to *teach* my son and focused instead on joining him in his exploration of the world, it all started happening for him. His reading has steadily improved and he&#39;s a voracious reader now picking out things like manga, magazines, classic sci-fi and philosophy/spirituality books to read. His writing is the last to come about but he&#39;s now writing for pleasure and purpose. He works at our restaurant, has good friends young and old, handles his finances better than most, has varied interests and deep passions. He has a life of his own design. That&#39;s my goal for him. <br/>
<br/>
My son is as brilliant as I always knew he was even when he did not excel at schoolwork. You can have the same for your daughter. You just have to let go a little and let her have some room to shine.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi i have a question, were any of your special ed kids in ps  <br/>
&gt; &gt; before?  did they have ieps?<br/>
&gt; &gt; One of my 5&#39;s has on iep and i am worried about what the rules are  <br/>
&gt; &gt; for getting her<br/>
&gt; &gt; released from this.  My 8 yr old who is deschooling right now had  <br/>
&gt; &gt; one, only for speech,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the state made us fullfill her iep requirements eventhough the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; school was still providing<br/>
&gt; &gt; services for her.  Can i get out of the iep?  My 5 yr old is  <br/>
&gt; &gt; progressing at HER own speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is perfect and right for HER.  I am a bit frightened to bring  <br/>
&gt; &gt; it up with out knowing<br/>
&gt; &gt; what i can do.  Thanks Melanie in Vt Mom to Lily 8, Grace and  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi.I am a h/s mother of 5.I really want to unschool yet I am so  <br/>
&gt; &gt; scared<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I just dont know.I have read so much on the topic and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the idea but you see by oldest is a special child.Since she has  <br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h/s ed her whole life she has never been tested or labeled but  <br/>
&gt; &gt; she has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a terrible time with schoolwork.I would say her reading level  <br/>
&gt; &gt; is 3rd<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grade and math 2nd or third grade level.I just have run out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make her understand concepts.I am wondering how not only will  <br/>
&gt; &gt; she get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;diploma&quot; but more importantly how is she going to make it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she cant reason.She can not do any word problems.Any advice I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really appreciate as I am at my witts end and crying after a  <br/>
&gt; &gt; day of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to explain 3rd grade math word problems to her(she is 13).<br/>

&gt; the one year he was in ps (kindie)  I decided against it as I knew I would<br/>
&gt; end up hsing him at some point and didn&#39;t want the &quot;blueprint&quot; and label<br/>
&gt; follwing him.  If you are going to hs why do an iep?  Especially if you are<br/>
&gt; going to unschool?  We don&#39;t use a guideline to determine what our children<br/>
&gt; &quot;need&quot; to know.  They learn what they need when they need it.  eip&#39;s are<br/>
&gt; used by the school system so that they can &quot;catch up&quot; the &quot;special ed kids&quot;<br/>
&gt; with the rest of their grade level.  It&#39;s to make THEIR life eaiser, not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675835005">Melanie, we did much the same. Our oldest was to start ps the year  <br/>
that Breanna was dx&#39;ed with autism. I wanted to homeschool  <br/>
desperately, but dh was against it and in the face of such severe  <br/>
issues, I was beaten down. It took five years for us to gain the  <br/>
courage to admit that the ps had nothing to offer us but emotional  <br/>
pain, and pull them O-U-T out! We were also told over and over that  <br/>
the sped teachers were the only ones who knew how to teach our  <br/>
daughter, and once our son was dx&#39;ed we received much the same. It is  <br/>
a tangle, and it does take some unweaving. We&#39;ve been out for a year,  <br/>
and we&#39;re still working on all of it.<br/>
