<div id="ygrps-yiv-209644475">Well, I was awoken by a sirened vehicle racing down my street.  A <br/>
rare occurance.  With summer heat and windows open I am now awake in <br/>
thought.  I sure wish this would have come to me earlier, but I need <br/>
to pose a question.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was out with DS12, DS14 and DD16.  We had a long day, and it <br/>
was a little warm.  I stopped at the library on our way home to <br/>
return an overdue book and pick up some of my holds.  The kids opted <br/>
to wait in the car.  <br/>
<br/>
While I was in the library, maybe 10 minutes, there was a pretty <br/>
serious conflict between the kids.  DS14 came into the library and <br/>
made me aware of the conflict between DS12 and DD16.  I asked DS14 <br/>
to go back out to ask them to simmer down before I came back out.  I <br/>
was seconds away from exiting the library myself.<br/>
<br/>
When I came out of the library DS14 and DD16 were standing outside <br/>
the vehicle talking with DS12 inside the car by himself.  What I <br/>
knew at this point was that DS12 had supposedly grabbed DS16&#39;s face <br/>
with his hand, and DD16 had punched DS12.  Since there was no <br/>
exchange of any kind going on upon my exiting the library and <br/>
getting in the car I decided not to say anything at that moment.  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t witnessed the exchange, had no idea what really happened, and <br/>
we were minutes from home.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home DS14 rode his bike to visit Dad at work, DS12 was <br/>
upstairs and DD16 proceeded to tell me her version of what had <br/>
happened without my prodding her.  From her perspective DS12 had <br/>
asked DS14 to move up his seat a little so that he could be more <br/>
comfortable.  (this point is why I&#39;m awake kicking myself for not <br/>
having asked questions right here)  For whatever reason DS14 had <br/>
issue with this as is typical anytime DS12 asks anything like this <br/>
of him.  (ie:  Could you please move a little so I can see the TV <br/>
better?)  Such requests usually end up in a &quot;discussion&quot; of the why <br/>
type.  Why should I move?  Why am I even in your way?  Why wasn&#39;t <br/>
how much I moved good enough?  Why can&#39;t you see with me right <br/>
here?  ON and ON. <br/>
<br/>
This is the point where I will usually point out that it&#39;s not an <br/>
unreasonable request and ask him to please just move.  Sometimes <br/>
he&#39;ll want to get into the semantics with me.  He seriously sees the <br/>
request as the issue and not his reluctance to honor something so <br/>
simple.  Well, with me not being there it turned into something <br/>
totally different.  Instead of DS14 moving up the seat, DD16 sided <br/>
with DS14 against DS12 insisting that DS12 would never do that for <br/>
DS14 so why should he?  DS16 can be pretty bossy, for lack of better <br/>
word, and DS12 got frustrated.  From DS16&#39;s perspective DS12 was <br/>
just fine one minute and attacked her the next minute grabbing her <br/>
face.  She proceeded to tell me that he was bipolar and needed <br/>
counseling.  A little dramatic in my opinion, but she seemed <br/>
perfectly serious.<br/>
<br/>
Totally dropping the ball and not pointing out how DS12&#39;s request <br/>
was perfectly reasonable I fell into the &quot;wrong&quot; conversation in <br/>
certain aspects.  I pointed out that I have in fact seen DS12 honor <br/>
DS14&#39;s requests on other occassions.  We discussed why it&#39;s not <br/>
usually a good idea to impose yourself in a conflict between your <br/>
siblings, or anyone, that has nothing to do with you.  (and honestly <br/>
wasn&#39;t a big deal between the two DS&#39;s until DD got involved)  I <br/>
also pointed out that it is not fair to suggest someone is crazy <br/>
because they didn&#39;t know how to handle a conflict and got <br/>
frustrated.  We also discussed the age difference between her and <br/>
DD12.  That was something she acknowledged and seemed to get her <br/>
attention.  At times we tend to foget that DD12 really is a young <br/>
kid.  He is the youngest of seven.  Our perspective can get a little <br/>
off with the age thing at times.  He&#39;s almost three years younger <br/>
than DS14 and is four years younger than DD16.  It makes a big <br/>
difference in certain aspects and conflict resolution is one of <br/>
them.  How could he be expected to have the same skills and <br/>
experience, right?  It seemed to be an aha kind of moment for her.<br/>
<br/>
A little while later DD12 came into my room and talked to me about <br/>
the conflict.  His perspective is that he had made the request <br/>
mentioned above and DD16 started in on him and wouldn&#39;t stop <br/>
attacking him verbally.  He knew that he couldn&#39;t tell her to stop <br/>
because it would make the situation worse.  He couldn&#39;t get out of <br/>
the vehicle because he felt trapped behind DD14 and DD16 was beside <br/>
him.  (it&#39;s a two door, very small, vehicle)  So, he put his hand <br/>
over her mouth as his way to tell her to be quiet not thinking about <br/>
the fact that this would also make matters worse.  She freaked out <br/>
on him further and started punching him.  He defended himself.  His <br/>
thought process exhibited very mature reasoning in many aspects, but <br/>
his feeling of being trapped is what paralyzed him.<br/>
<br/>
Neither child had any marks on their bodies.  Neither child was <br/>
visibly upset in any outward ways like tear stains or anything like <br/>
that.  The thing that&#39;s keeping me awake is that I feel like this <br/>
should be discussed further with DD14 and DD16, but I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
to go about it.  I&#39;m not sure that DD12 should be present when we <br/>
talk about it.  For those of you that don&#39;t know DD14 and DD16 are <br/>
new to homeschooling and unschooling.  They have been in PS their <br/>
entire lives until this past Easter Break and Christmas Break <br/>
respectively.  <br/>
<br/>
How would you approach this if it were your children?  What, if <br/>
anything, should I do differently with them not really having an <br/>
unschooling mindset?  They are both gone until Sunday, so we won&#39;t <br/>
be able to talk until then.  I would really appreciate some input <br/>
from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994349060">Error Correction:  I got a little messed up along the way with the DS <br/>
and DD aspects of my post.  The kids ARE as follows:<br/>
<br/>
DS12<br/>
DS14<br/>
DD16<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this caused any confusion...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511066937">Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I have children who also get into conflicts like this when tired, <br/>
hungry, trapped, hot. Mine are younger, 12, 9 and 6...but I see a <br/>
lot of similar patterns here in my home. I like how your kids <br/>
spontaneously came and talked to you. That&#39;s a great sign that they <br/>
want to be heard. Even the older one saying the younger is crazy. <br/>
That is what she is feeling right then, so hearing her without <br/>
judgement is important. I think you did a great thing not going back <br/>
over the conflict in the moment. Mine just would get all hot and <br/>
bothered again, it would escalate the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Some things I would suggest. Help your 12 year old feel in control. <br/>
Have plans, like when you get so mad at DD 16, get out, no matter <br/>
what and away. That might help with him not touching her. Let the <br/>
other kids know your plan. When DS 12 is mad, he needs space and <br/>
air. We are going to help him with that. Also, I just don&#39;t leave <br/>
all 3 of mine in the car or anywhere really. 2 &#39;s work, 3&#39;s fight. I <br/>
take one. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter which one. DD 16 needs to own <br/>
her part of the situation. Have you read the Explosive Child By Ross <br/>
Greene. It&#39;s an eye openner for triggers to angry reactions. My <br/>
older dd is the primary trigger to her brothers angry outburst. <br/>
Without dwelling on her, I do let her know possible other paths <br/>
which might result in less anger. Like you suggested, if she was <br/>
silent, then the boys might have been fine.<br/>
<br/>
Without putting to much emphasis on what happened, I would stay <br/>
tuned into your 3 and be present when the sibling conflicts begin. <br/>
See the dynamics, but also find a way to support all of them being <br/>
heard. I find this the hardest, slowing everyone down to be heard, <br/>
to listen to eachother and to move from problem to solution. One <br/>
thing we are doing is trying not to be in situations where we need <br/>
to ask someone else to do something for our comfort. For example, if <br/>
someone sits down and blocks you, you can either scoot over yourself <br/>
or ask. If asking gets you negative results, moving just might be a <br/>
better solution.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. You have me worried, I&#39;m goignt o have those same bigger <br/>
kids bickering in the car while I try to get 1 thing taken care of.<br/>

Thanks for your input, Mary.  Don&#39;t worry too much.  Consider <br/>
yourself blessed.  You have a leg up in this arena.  How wonderful <br/>
for your family that you have come to this while they are young.<br/>
<br/>
I was &quot;absent minded parented&quot; and had a rough way to go.  I made <br/>
the error in judgement thinking that where my single-mom <br/>
went &quot;wrong&quot; with me was not being strict enough and fell into the <br/>
traditional parenting trap.  Unfortunately, we raised the first four <br/>
that way...in public school to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have the three youngest here at home and are trying to do <br/>
things differently.  We are learning from experience that control <br/>
fed parenting backfires, and having a real relationship based on <br/>
trust and respect creates something totally different, desirable and <br/>
meaningful.  <br/>
<br/>
DH is a little behind me, but I am desperately trying to learn for <br/>
all of us.  I&#39;m getting the mindful part in theory, and I couldn&#39;t <br/>
agree more.  (Honestly, when I look back on my instincts mindful <br/>
parenting came naturally to me.  I allowed it to get mucked up by <br/>
getting sucked into the &quot;need&quot; to traditionally parent.)  Now I just <br/>
need my mindful instincts to become natural reflex in practice.  <br/>
With no personal refernce point it can be very tricky at times.  The <br/>
only examples I had were toxic.  <br/>
<br/>
It is my desire to create something totally different with my <br/>
children at home and rebuild my relationship with the older ones as <br/>
well.  Maybe I can set a positive example and give my children <br/>
something real to refer back on when it comes time for them to raise <br/>
the next generation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the others for the links.  I really appreciate the <br/>
resources.<br/>
