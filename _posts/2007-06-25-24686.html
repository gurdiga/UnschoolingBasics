<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043670180">Just wanted to share an interesting situation with you guys.   We have a house guest this week... a friend of my 14 yr old&#39;s is visiting us.  The plan was for them to attend a zookeeper day camp this week that they were both excited about.    Today on the way my daughter became ill , immediately our guest wanted to know if she HAD to attend the day camp alone (she is a very shy, anxious child who attends public school) . I asked her if she wanted to... her response was &quot;No but you paid for me to go and I am not sick, my mom would make me go but I don&#39;t want to go without Anna&quot;     So I told her she didn&#39;t have to go and that if Anna was well they could both go tomorrow (we were basically within sight of the zoo when Anna&#39;s nausea turned ugly so we drove in to tell them we were ill and couldn&#39;t attend today)   <br/>
Anyway this led to a discussion on the way home about arbitrary rules and respect etc.    Every time this child comes to my house her mother says things like &quot;Well I told her she had to do this or that or to make sure with you about this or that etc... but she said it would be fine because you are &#39;cool&#39; &quot;    Not sure my friend likes that but that is the view of her child regarding me.     I asked B today on the way back in the car how all the rules at her house made her feel.   She said they make her feel anxious and untrusted , that her mother tells her she is a good kid and then makes all kinds of rules and that makes her feel like her mother is lying.    Then I asked her about the rules at my house....she said well the rules at your house make sense, they are rules that make everyone feel safe, protected and trusted.    We have very few rules and mostly they are rules of consideration and rules of safety (like if you light a candle it should be resting on something<br/>
 inflammable like a saucer or candle holder.... my friend&#39;s rule would be don&#39;t light candles).   Anyway I thought that was really interesting since so many people say kids need rules they like rules etc.   A.S Neill (Summerhill) does say that kids like rules and will make lots of rules for themselves (so we don&#39;t need to I think is what he is saying!).     For years I have heard if kids don&#39;t have rules and limits they are unhappy.   What I have seen proved to me over and over is that if  kids are given arbitrary rules they feel untrusted !    Now I have proof directly from the mouth of a child who lives her life bound by rules all made by other people.     Interestingly enough she lives with a step sister (same age) that sneaks, lies, cheats, breaks rules, skips school, runs away,  has been asked to leave two schools, and so on.... the parents&#39; answer to her behavior is to make more rules!  UGH!  <br/>
It just seems to me that if we give kids so many rules about sleeping, eating, behaving and everything else how will they ever learn to make their own decisions?   How can these people expect their kids to make good choices in life if they are constantly making rules that say clearly &quot;you are not trusted to make the right choice&quot; ???<br/>

I am right there with you, and in fact, in an &quot;argument&quot; of sorts on a  <br/>
message board I frequent regarding this type of things, teen&#39;s and children&#39;s  <br/>
rights, drinking laws and responsibilities. You name it. Even my own house,  <br/>
mostly, I am disagreed with. <br/>

The other thing that really bothers me is how a child is treated when<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786435643">This is SO true. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a place where they were thousands of rules, most of <br/>
them totally cryptic for my sisters and I (though they made perfect <br/>
sense for my father and his huge need of control). My father is a <br/>
good man nevertheless and we loved him and respected him deeply, so <br/>
we didn&#39;t cheat, nor lie, but what I remember from my childhood is <br/>
this very strong feeling of powerlessness as I was completely <br/>
dependant from other&#39;s judgement to know if what I was doing was good <br/>
or bad.<br/>
<br/>
My reaction to that is that I try to limit the number of rules at <br/>
home with my kids and not to be too strict with them. I have <br/>
realised, though, that it is much more difficult than I thought and <br/>
that they also live in a place where they can be &quot;blamed&quot; for <br/>
mistakes without really knowing why before. Working on it ...<br/>
<br/>
There is a city, in Netherlands, where they found a creative solution <br/>
to the problem of security on the road : they suppresssed all the <br/>
signs, traffic-lights, speed limitation, and so on ... and it <br/>
worked ! Everybody has to pay attention to what the others are doing <br/>
and everybody is respectful - the number of accidents has <br/>
decreased. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189584731">Is everyone on the same wavelength with me today?! <br/>
  Funny, the rule issue is one that recently came up in our house when our 4.8yo had a guest, (that being his 3rd cousin whose Mom is my dearest friend). Though she and I seem to think a lot alike, our kids have been raised very differently. Schedules and rules are the order of the day in her house, whereas in mine we fly by the seat of our pants most (okay, all) of the time. Our only rules are related to safety, consideration for others, and only recently have I needed to make a rule about staying seated while eating ( mealtime has been a little wild lately.) My son thinks, reasons things out, most all of the time, makes very good decisions. My niece, on the other hand, spends most of her time testing authority and rebelling against it. Thus, she is in &#39;time-out&#39; so often I can&#39;t help but shake my head. At this point, it seems past the point of no return. She has no sense of power, except through rebellion, which the adults want to squash, which leads to more powerlessness<br/>
 and rebellion, and on, and on. <br/>
  One interesting note I&#39;d like to mention...I&#39;m a very free-flowing kind-of mom. But when she&#39;s here, she almost makes me want to impose strict rules on her, just to squeeze out some kind of reasonable behavior from her. (That implies she&#39;s not a bright kid... she is a VERY intelligent 4yo.) We&#39;ll be spending more time together now that it&#39;s summer,(I have her for a week in July) so wish me luck. I admit, I am eager to kind-of experiment with her to see if her behaviors would change in a different environment.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761570181">I just led preschool vacation bible school--and for the third year in <br/>
a row asked myself why I do this (well, I do it because i love the <br/>
kids and want my kid to experience vbs but not with some crazy adult).<br/>
My co-leader also has a 4 year old, who spent 2/3 rds of each evening <br/>
in the bathroom in timeout. The only time he wasn&#39;t in time out he <br/>
was getting spanked, begging for forgiveness and/or mercy, or beating <br/>
up other kids. <br/>
<br/>
I am struggling over how to handle this (not only did she spank she <br/>
spanked 5-10 times at a time, literally making him beg).<br/>
<br/>
Mom controlled everything she could and constantly told him he wasn&#39;t <br/>
good enough, couldn&#39;t do it right, or wasn&#39;t good at anything.<br/>
<br/>
When she walked out midweek and I called her at home to see if she <br/>
was coming back, she complained to me (with child in background) how <br/>
he ruined everything and how mad she was at him for ruining things.<br/>
<br/>
Poor kid.<br/>
<br/>
He told my son that when he gets big he can tell other people what to <br/>
do and be the boss of them (in between punching him).<br/>
<br/>
I also lead sunday school for these kids and let me tell you it can <br/>
be a real challenge to not turn into the same kind of parent. I am <br/>
really rethinking my son being in this environment.<br/>
<br/>
I teamteach with my dearest friend, and I have been amazed at the <br/>
transformation in her. She treats the kids like they are wild animals <br/>
that might turn on us at any moment. She told me that I need to start <br/>
tough and show no mercy or they will walk all over me!<br/>
<br/>
I only have the kids for a few hours but I am working really hard at <br/>
saying yes. I think several of them may have eaten themselves sick, <br/>
and they definately look at me strange when I join them in their play <br/>
or initiate my own.<br/>
<br/>
It really reinforces to me that I have found out how I do not want to <br/>
be and how I do want to parent.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys. <br/>

<br/>
This strikes me as being so far from how Jesus would have treated  <br/>
children that if they could see themselves objectively they&#39;d be  <br/>
mortified. Or *should* be.<br/>
<br/>
People get the idea that they need to wait for kids to be good in  <br/>
order to be kind to them. The total opposite is true. I can&#39;t imagine  <br/>
Jesus choosing any other way to be.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to suggest. How would your minister see it if you  <br/>
put it the way I did? Some churches offer parenting classes. Are  <br/>
there gentle parenting classes that would be compatible with your  <br/>
church&#39;s beliefs? That might be a way of approaching it sideways.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what to suggest. How would your minister see it if you <br/>
put it the way I did? Some churches offer parenting classes. Are <br/>
there gentle parenting classes that would be compatible with your <br/>
church&#39;s beliefs? That might be a way of approaching it sideways.<br/>

Or maybe you could take a stab at unschooling God&#39;s journey! You can check<br/>
out the yahoo group here: http://groups.yahoo<br/>
com/group/UnschoolingGodJourney/ and check out: http://thegodjourney.com <br/>
and you could read my current blog post: http://lifeacademy<br/>
homeschooljournal.net/2007/06/29/detoxing-from-church/<br/>
<br/>
Jesus definitely wouldn&#39;t treat anyone that way... especially children!<br/>
