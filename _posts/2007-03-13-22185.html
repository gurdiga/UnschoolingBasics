<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220034237">**Sorry for the cross-posts, just trying to cover our bases!**<br/>
<br/>
 Learn, Explore, Adventure & Play, take the LEAP into unschooling!  We are a<br/>
support group for parents/guardians of unschoolers. We are pretty relaxed<br/>
about pretty much everything. We are a secular (non-religious-affiliated)<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, we believe that child-led learning is preferable to<br/>
curriculum use. We are not a conservative school-at-home group, and find<br/>
little reason to discuss curriculum but can get intense about respecting<br/>
children and about learning. It is understood that each family is at a<br/>
different point in their journey. Not everyone on this list will be an<br/>
unschooler; some may be exploring the idea, others may be relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers interested in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What we also see as paramount is having fun and playing together! Basically,<br/>
we like our kids, like each other&#39;s kids and enjoy spending time together.<br/>
We have regular park days, seasonal parties, field trips, &quot;meet & greets,&quot;<br/>
volunteer opportunities, and other events.<br/>
<br/>
We are based in Southern NH Nashua/Manchester, and have members from all<br/>
over the surrounding areas.<br/>
<br/>
Join us and help expand our circle with the goal of our kids being a part of<br/>
a larger group of kids who are &quot;in the same boat&quot; more or less!  We&#39;re<br/>
looking to shatter the image of the loney, socially awkward homeschooler who<br/>
knows nobody else like him/herself.  We want our kids to feel like *they*<br/>
are the norm and have a huge group of unschooled friends to prove it!<br/>
