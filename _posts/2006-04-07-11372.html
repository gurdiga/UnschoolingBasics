We are new to unschooling and would love to attend a conference. The one in  <br/>
Mass. might be very possible....we live on Long Island.....I am curious if  <br/>
there are any trains from here that we can possibly take that you might know  of <br/>
?? I will have to research how the drive is.....I am a chicken.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

There is a train from NYC to Boston, which is only 15 miles from Peabody,  <br/>
where the conference is. You&#39;d probably need to take a cab or even rent a car,  <br/>
but&#39;s certainly easily doable. If you do have a car, it&#39;s not that bad a <br/>
drive,  and you don&#39;t have to drive through Boston to get here.<br/>

No, my son Dylan and I flew into Logan but we rented a car in Boston. <br/>
It&#39;s navigable, even for someone not used to all that traffic. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769000018">Another option between New York (City) and Boston is the Amtrak Acela<br/>
Express Train.  It&#39;s a bit more expensive than the &quot;regular&quot; Amtrak<br/>
train, but it&#39;s faster, and it puts you into North Station in Boston,<br/>
which is actually quite easy to get out of, compared to other areas in<br/>
the city!  I think there is also a rental car conpany right next to<br/>
the train station.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to fly, though, I will also suggest the Manchester, NH<br/>
airport.  It is technically an international airport (Canada, eh?),<br/>
but nowhere near as crowded as Logan.  Manchester, NH is about an hour<br/>
  northwest, by car.  So, you would be backtracking a bit to get back<br/>
down to Peabody & Salem, but it&#39;s highway driving.  We use it often<br/>
when we fly out to visit my ILs.<br/>

Also, how much is there for 3 year olds to do?  I&#39;ve looked at the<br/>
conference website, and it says there are funshops & crafts & stuff,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74641764">My husband went to last years&#39; conference, and there were lots of other Dads there.  He did go to Ben&#39;s SSUD meeting, but probably won&#39;t again -- don&#39;t know if your dh would be interested or not.  Gary spent the bulk of his time either at that pool with our kids or in the room with our kids and Jenny&#39;s kids.  He was cool with that, because he figures he&#39;s there to allow me to better enjoy the conference, since he doesn&#39;t really get into the whole conference kinda thing.  <br/>
   <br/>
  There will be Dads there. As well, the hotel has a huge outdoor pool (so bring lotsa sunscreen) and there are a couple of museums and a great park w/playground (newly updated) within walking distance, should he end up spending most of his time with the kiddies.  Gary will spend virtually all of his time that week at the pool or playground with our boys, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
