<div id="ygrps-yiv-641853663">Hi! For the last few months, I have been feeling a pull to unschool <br/>
my 3 children.  Just a little history on us.  This is our 4th year <br/>
homeschooling.  My 2 older boys went to ps for 2 years.  They <br/>
stuggled everyday and hated anything to do with learning.  The <br/>
school system did nothing but test my children.  When the test would <br/>
come back and show that there was nothing wrong, they (ps system) <br/>
would tell me that they would need to test again.  After all that <br/>
craziness, I took a deep breath and jumped into this wonderful world <br/>
of homeschooling.  It has been very rough at times, but very <br/>
rewarding.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay I will get to my questions.  My middle son (age 10 next month) <br/>
is still having a very hard time reading.  We have tried a lot of <br/>
things.  At this point we are just starting over, using an old copy <br/>
of llatl (blue program).  He is catching on better.  Here are the <br/>
questions.  When you unschool, how do you teach your dc to read?  Do <br/>
they learn on their own or do I need to guide them?  Do you use any <br/>
kind of program? Also, is it normal that he is taking so long to <br/>
learn to read?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
Hope</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728012758">When you unschool, kids naturally teach themselves to read.  For some it is almost overnight.  For others, it is very gradual over many years.  It isn&#39;t uncommon at all for boys especially to not read until 12 or so.  My son, now 12, taught himself to read playing video games and Yu-Gi-Oh.<br/>

You don&#39;t. You surround them with the written word. You answer their questions. You get them things they&#39;d<br/>

Well, they learn on their own with guidance. Read to them. Buy them books and magazines. Spell and pronounce<br/>

That&#39;s not long! Most boys don&#39;t read until 12. Even children in school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146636470"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My middle son (age 10 next month)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is still having a very hard time reading. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you having him read aloud to you? Way back when, I tried that with my son and that turned out to be the source of his problems rather than any help at all. REading aloud is sooo different than reading silently to oneself. Once I left him alone for awhile, and he was ready, all those reading problems and &quot;learning disabilities&quot; seemed to melt away. He&#39;s a voracious reader now, but didn&#39;t really start reading fluently until 9 or 10 years old.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to relax. Don&#39;t start on any reading programs. He&#39;s not in school so he&#39;s got time to develop and advance at his own rate. Schools push early reading to keep the kids on the school conveyor belt. They need them reading independently by fourth grade so they can start assigning textbook reading and homework. You&#39;re free from all of that.<br/>
<br/>
Give him time off for good behavior &lt;g&gt; and just read to him. Get him comics and manga and magazines with lots of cool pictures, play games together, and listen to books on tape. Surround him with the written word and let him pick and choose what he wants to look at. Help him read if he asks but don&#39;t ask him to read. It&#39;ll happen  when he&#39;s ready and you&#39;ll wonder why you ever worried so much.<br/>

continue to read the Harry Potter books to my son snuggled on the couch<br/>

able to!  <br/>

<br/>
This is true for girls as well.  12 1/2 and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest challenge in later readers is maintaining a strong self image without the need to read - by being accepting and comfortable with whatever your child&#39;s time table supports their ability to be accepting and comfortable in themselves.  A later reader knows they have different abilities than other kids their age.  <br/>
<br/>
It is really amazing to witness an older person who is not burdened with decoding words and the wonderful abilities and skills they master that might not otherwise be the case were they to be reading.<br/>
<br/>
And, it&#39;s very important to be very accessible to assist when reading is necessary.<br/>

Okay I will get to my questions.  My middle son (age 10 next month) <br/>
is still having a very hard time reading.  We have tried a lot of <br/>
things.  At this point we are just starting over, using an old copy <br/>
of llatl (blue program).  He is catching on better. <br/>
*********<br/>
<br/>
Is he asking to read?  Is he asking to do &quot;work?&quot;  Does he enjoy the &quot;blue program?&quot;  If it&#39;s not something he asks to do without any coercion on your part than don&#39;t do it.    When he&#39;s ready he will read.  Relax.  He&#39;s still very young.  otoh if you sit back and don&#39;t push, you may find that he is already reading - may not be aloud and it may not be books.  Just don&#39;t push because that will certainly take the joy out of the experience of reading.  And it reflects your lack of acceptance in who he is. Focus on the wonderful gifts and skills he has.  Give attention to and nurture his interests and desires.  <br/>
