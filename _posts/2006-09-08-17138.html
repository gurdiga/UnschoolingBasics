<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802215032">I have a dilemma that I would appreciate some input on.<br/>
<br/>
My dd (14 this month) has been staying up after we go to bed until 4 <br/>
or 5AM (sometimes 6 or 7 AM! Only a couple of times.).   This has <br/>
only been for the past couple of months.   I used to stay up with <br/>
her until maybe 2 or 3 AM as she didn&#39;t want to be alone, but <br/>
finally we had a discussion about it because it was catching up with <br/>
me (I can&#39;t sleep as long on the other end).  She decided she wanted <br/>
to stay up on her own.<br/>
<br/>
She plays World of Warcraft almost exclusively, and has since she <br/>
left school in June 2005 (end of 6th grade).  This has been her <br/>
first year, deschooling, healing.   I&#39;ve had my struggles but get <br/>
lots of help by coming here and continuing to read and deschool <br/>
myself.   Our relationship has improved greatly, more mutual <br/>
respect, trust etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Back in the spring she learned how to talk to her friends on the <br/>
game through a headset and approached me about getting one.   She <br/>
showed me the software (free download), her dad checked it (he&#39;s the <br/>
computer guy) as she knows we want to be sure it&#39;s legit etc and we <br/>
got the headset.  She&#39;s really enjoyed talking with the friends <br/>
she&#39;s made in the game while they&#39;re playing.  She doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
lot of friends IRL (she&#39;s always had a hard time connecting with her <br/>
peers).   This group is a variety of ages, including teens and <br/>
adults.   She talks to me fairly often about the different people.   <br/>
One (I&#39;ll call him &quot;J&quot;) has come up more often lately.  I asked a <br/>
little about him, how old, what state does he live in  she knows to <br/>
not say where she lives, only the state once she gets to &quot;know&quot; them <br/>
better, most of the people are mid to west coast  how old is he <br/>
etc).  She isn&#39;t always sure, she doesn&#39;t ask a lot of questions, <br/>
but picks it up from the general conversations, but I think he&#39;s at <br/>
least 18.   She has also mentioned that a couple of the adults (I&#39;m <br/>
assuming, or hoping) are sometimes drunk (she thinks it&#39;s comical-<br/>
another topic for discussion we have too) but I&#39;m not sure if he was <br/>
one of them.   She also says most don&#39;t know how old she is, she&#39;s <br/>
concerned they&#39;ll &quot;reject&quot; (not the word I want) her if they find <br/>
out she&#39;s &quot;only 13&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We have cordless phones and this morning I went to hit redial <br/>
thinking I was recalling the last number I dialed, and it was &quot;J&#39;s&quot; <br/>
number (cell phone).  It went to voice mail.   Then, it occurred to <br/>
me that the phone upstairs (that she uses earlier in the evening <br/>
many days to talk to her friend (who is in school)) has been in the <br/>
bathroom when I get up in the morning for a few days now (I use it <br/>
as well from my office also on the 2nd floor).   One of the last <br/>
things I do before I go to bed is replace the 2 cordless phones in <br/>
their cradles to recharge them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to approach her about this.  We had the talks about <br/>
internet safety etc.  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s talking to him on the <br/>
phone, or just paging him that she&#39;s online (even though she&#39;s <br/>
online from the moment she gets up until she goes to bed, unless <br/>
we&#39;re off doing something).  And if she&#39;s called him, he now most <br/>
likely has our phone number.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for several weeks the phone would ring a couple of times a day <br/>
(&quot;out of area&quot; on the caller ID).  I registered with &quot;Do Not Call&quot; <br/>
quite a while ago and the telemarketer calls have all but ceased, so <br/>
now I&#39;m wondering if it might be connected.  I didn&#39;t pick it up, <br/>
that&#39;s why we have an answering machine if it&#39;s a number I don&#39;t <br/>
know, I&#39;ve also heard that telemarketers have a computer program <br/>
that will call randomly to see if someone picks up, just to register <br/>
when to call for real.   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked many times about how it&#39;s not HER I don&#39;t trust, its <br/>
other more experienced and older/stronger (for real life situations <br/>
when we&#39;ve talked about abduction etc) people.  Also, she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have the world experience of knowing how to read people yet.   She&#39;s <br/>
by nature very cautious but we all know how much easier it is to be <br/>
more open on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas and thoughts are welcome.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jann, I totally understand your concerns.  You could be talking about my<br/>
daughter, except she does more RP on AIM than anything else.  Her buddy list<br/>
has grown recently and it concerned me (she has it set up that only people<br/>
who are on her buddy list can IM her).  So far I know the connection of all<br/>
the people on her buddy list (RL friends of RL friends, no internet<br/>
&quot;buddies&quot; met online).  We talk often about ways to keep safe on the<br/>
internet.  I worry about her uploads to Youtube and have monitored the<br/>
comments, not because (like you) I dont&#39; trust her but because I want to<br/>
know who is seeing her stuff and leaving comments.<br/>
<br/>
If this guy has your phone number (which with a cell phone he might just)<br/>
then he also has access to find out where you live and who you are (reverse<br/>
number look up).  Google your phone number and see what you come up with.<br/>
It can be eye opening.  Emily knows that I read her comments.  She actually<br/>
likes me to.  But I don&#39;t read her e-mail.  But I don&#39;t believe that there<br/>
is anything to worry about on that front.<br/>
<br/>
I[&#39;m not sure what to tell you.  I would be concerned.  I would probably<br/>
talk to Emily if I were in the same situation.  Do you have the trust of<br/>
your daughter that you feel you could talk to her without her feeling<br/>
condemned?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580303386">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I think there are three things here that you can think about.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, you are saying (to her and to us) that you do trust  <br/>
HER, but not the other guys. IMO, this is not fully true, if you  <br/>
think about it carefully. You do not trust the other guys, and in  <br/>
certain ways you do trust that she doesn&#39;t *want* anything bad  <br/>
happens to her, but you do not trust in her ability to detect a &quot;bad  <br/>
guy&quot;, or you do not trust that she believes you when you are trying  <br/>
to say &quot;nobody is trust worthy on the internet, because you can never  <br/>
know&quot; (in case this is your point). It is OK if you do not trust her  <br/>
in that! But then, start not saying you trust her, when you do not  <br/>
trust her fully, she&#39;ll know.<br/>
<br/>
Second, you said you don&#39;t know if she&#39;s talking to him on the phone,  <br/>
and if it is concerning you and your inner, natural limits, because  <br/>
it&#39;s just driving you crazy and you can&#39;t sleep at nights because you  <br/>
are afraid (or whatever reaction you may have), you will just need to  <br/>
talk to her about that, openly. Tell her your concerns. Tell her you  <br/>
don&#39;t trust in her ability to detect a bad guy (or the other thing).  <br/>
Tell her that you are afraid. She might understand!<br/>
<br/>
And third, teach her to detect such a guy if that is your problem! If  <br/>
you have the time, you might just chat together in another chatroom.  <br/>
Chat a lot. I know she might be too old to &quot;play games&quot;, but I think  <br/>
it could still be fun to make it a game. You are anonymous. You can  <br/>
make up an identity and talk to guys. See what the guys say and talk  <br/>
about how you think this guy is and if he seems to be trustworthy or  <br/>
not and WHY and ask her how she would think about this or that other  <br/>
guy. You can even do it so far as to accept invitations of actually  <br/>
meeting the person. You can go together and check it out. Find out if  <br/>
the people lie or not. Since you are anonymous and you are not  <br/>
experimenting with her already &quot;friends&quot;, you can tell those other  <br/>
people whatever you want, just to test. This might also let her think  <br/>
about how people can make up an identity on the other end of the  <br/>
line!!! And you can try things out like: Yeah, you can invite me, but  <br/>
I&#39;m 13 and you&#39;ll have to say hello to my mom. Or, I&#39;m 25 and I have  <br/>
big boops! Or, I&#39;m 57 and have 5 children... See how the guys would  <br/>
react. Talk about how these guys react. Talk about what kind of  <br/>
reactions you would have liked instead (if). For instance, if the  <br/>
guys would leave instantly, you can derive from this behaviour that  <br/>
he is not really interested then. Or that he is afraid. Or something  <br/>
else. These are just ideas, you can do all or some or nothing. And of  <br/>
course it only works, if she would like to do that. But maybe she  <br/>
wants. Because she wants to be safe, and if she knows about internet  <br/>
safety already she might be interested in such a test (and it is  <br/>
fun). And if you told her your true concerns she might also want to  <br/>
do if for you, to ease your stress and your fear.<br/>
<br/>
Because you are unschooling, you know that if she doesn&#39;t get the  <br/>
chance to check out this medium she&#39;ll probably be even more naive  <br/>
about it whenever she&#39;ll be able to use it, so you don&#39;t want to  <br/>
forbid it. But you are still concerned. But you are concerned about  <br/>
her ability to detect bad guys, so I think you have to approach the  <br/>
problem from that end. When you have done &quot;research&quot; together, you  <br/>
might as well come up with a thesis that says that nobody is actually  <br/>
really trustworthy on the internet. Or that some are and some don&#39;t  <br/>
and that there are different criteria which can help you determine  <br/>
if. There is always a risk. But you will also always be there for her  <br/>
just in case. There are dangers on the street as well.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Johanna<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: Since I&#39;m unschooling only for a very very short time, I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if my advices are really according to unschooling principles.  <br/>
Anyone is free to tell me where I&#39;m wrong. Thank you :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if that is even possible.  I&#39;ve been &quot;hoodwinked&quot; a few times<br/>
by people I&#39;ve met online.  Some &quot;gal&quot; who is all into some craft and has<br/>
this fantastic story.  You get to know her and several years later you find<br/>
out that she wasn&#39;t a she at all, but some really weird guy who just liked<br/>
stirring up trouble.  YOu thought she was a 30-something mother of 2 living<br/>
in Iowa and you find out that he is this 50 yo guy living in Chicago.<br/>
Because you&#39;ve built up &quot;trust&quot; with this guy for several years you&#39;ve<br/>
eventually given some personal information out.  Then you find out the truth<br/>
and you worry for quite a while that this weirdo is going to show up at your<br/>
door someday.  This really happened to me.  It was scary when it all came<br/>
out and there were several of us who had even given this person our phone<br/>
numbers!  So if a guy can fool a &quot;interent saavy&quot; adult woman how is a 14 yo<br/>
supposed to be able to detect a shady character?<br/>

 &gt; supposed to be able to detect a shady character?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well certainly not when she isn&#39;t allowed to do this anymore, but we  <br/>
all know that here. The only way we learn this lesson is by doing it.  <br/>
If her mother is by her side when they do it, the risk is less.  <br/>
That&#39;s why I said they should talk about how they think the people  <br/>
are and so on and talka bout how they could be someone else, and make  <br/>
up an identity yourself so you can see that it is fairly easy. You  <br/>
can see how other people believe you and how you can perfeclty make  <br/>
believe other people. So you can learn that anyone could do this and  <br/>
that she should generally not trust other people.<br/>
<br/>
There is always a risk, also in &quot;real life&quot;. First of all, Internet  <br/>
ist part of our &quot;real life&quot; and is as real as anything else. It is  <br/>
easier yes, to cloke yourself and make up an identity and this is  <br/>
very welcomed by such bastards.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, this can happen in real life as well! My best friend had a room  <br/>
mate she still (has to) live with who told her she worked for IBM and  <br/>
has extremely expensive clothes from designers and all kinds of  <br/>
things and she believed her all along, until a few weeks ago a guy  <br/>
from some institute came demanding debts and such. It turned out she  <br/>
has no job and had been lying all along, the thigns were stolen or  <br/>
paid with VISA, the account not covered though so she has 20000 €  <br/>
debts. So even in &quot;real life&quot; you can never know. A similar thing  <br/>
happened to my mother, and I think many people have encountered these  <br/>
kinds of situations. Should we raise our children in fear that you  <br/>
cannot trust anybody?<br/>
<br/>
Better we give them the tools to do it the best we can, give them  <br/>
support if anything happens and stay close with them in trust (rather  <br/>
than thinking &quot;should I ask her or not if she phoned him...&quot; and be  <br/>
able to talk to stay informed.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that you shouldn&#39;t think that just because you don&#39;t  <br/>
give your telephone number that youa re safe! Anyone can find out who  <br/>
the internet access belongs to, if someone really wanted, and mostly  <br/>
the numbers are registered somewhere anyway. And someone doesn&#39;t need  <br/>
your telephone number to harass you, it can happen on the streets as  <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the research Jann and her daughter could do, would be  <br/>
more effective than anything I can think of. Just talking about  <br/>
internet safety is not enough, if her daughter believes or &quot;feels&quot;  <br/>
that she CAN trust that guy. So examples of people who are not really  <br/>
trust worthy are needed, and they needn&#39;t wait until something  <br/>
&quot;happens&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s RP?  Haven&#39;t seen that one before.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this guy has your phone number (which with a cell phone he might <br/>

you come up with. It can be eye opening.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A while back there was info on how to block your number from showing <br/>
up on the internet, which I did to all ours (home and cell) plus my <br/>
dad&#39;s.   I doesn&#39;t show up when you google at least!   <br/>
<br/>
Actually, a lot has happened since I posted!  The same night, she <br/>
wanted to IM with me (she likes to talk to me this way when it&#39;s <br/>
something &quot;sensitive&quot;, she has a hard time with face to face <br/>
conversations).  We talked about a few &quot;chatty&quot; things, then she <br/>
mentioned how her headset, no actually the software, isn&#39;t working <br/>
(she uses TeamSpeak to talk with her friends as they&#39;re playing World <br/>
of Warcraft) so she&#39;s talked to some friends on the phone. It was the <br/>
perfect opportunity for me to say &quot;I hit the redial and a number came <br/>
up I didn&#39;t know&quot;, she asked if it was a guy, then she proceeded to <br/>
tell me it was &quot;J&quot; and that they enjoy talking but haven&#39;t been able <br/>
to online. She also said &quot;I was kinda going behind u and dads back <br/>
calling my friend without telling u guys, i didn&#39;t know how u guys <br/>
would react&quot; (I saved the words she wrote so I would be accurate). I <br/>
told her I was glad she felt comfortable telling me and that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
mad at all. Then we talked some more about safety and being careful <br/>
not to give out info etc. Also my concerns about the late hour (this <br/>
has been happening after I go to bed) and the length of conversations <br/>
(he&#39;s in TX, we have free nationwide).  She said she doesn&#39;t feel like <br/>
he&#39;s a bad person and she&#39;s been very aware of possible danger <br/>
signals. (She had an experience earlier this year with another teen a <br/>
couple of years older than her, they didn&#39;t talk on the phone, only <br/>
email and occ IM, but he started getting &quot;pushy&quot; and she ended it <br/>
because of that, which made me feel more confident about her ability <br/>
to say &quot;no&quot; (in whatever form that takes - I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot;, I bought it a while back after someone <br/>
recommended it here but hadn&#39;t read it yet - someone mentioned it to <br/>
me in an email so I dug it out!  Perfect timing, I highly recommend <br/>
it!).<br/>
<br/>
She had a friend over Sat and overnight, so we didn&#39;t have a chance to <br/>
talk any more about it until last night (or should I say this <br/>
morning!).  Her friend went home at noon (she lives in another town) <br/>
and she wasn&#39;t on the phone at all until after I went to bed, it was <br/>
about 2:30 AM.   I waited a while to see how long she&#39;d be on (her <br/>
door was closed) then after 45 mins I knocked and said I&#39;d appreciate <br/>
it if she&#39;d not be on the phone so late and left the room.   A while <br/>
later (after she ended the call, but also didn&#39;t come to see me, which <br/>
didn&#39;t surprise me) I knocked again on her door and said I&#39;d like to <br/>
talk.  I started out be telling her I wasn&#39;t angry.  I told her about <br/>
my concerns, calling at such a late hour, after we&#39;ve gone to bed, <br/>
it &quot;appears&quot; sneaky etc etc.  We talked for almost 2 hours and I was <br/>
relieved to hear what she had to say.  She talked a lot about how <br/>
she&#39;s very aware of how people treat her (and others), she doesn&#39;t <br/>
hesitate to speak her mind (and that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s &quot;mean&quot;, only <br/>
firm if necessary).  She knows to end it if she&#39;s uncomfortable (like <br/>
this other teen I mentioned above).  She&#39;s still worried I&#39;ll explode <br/>
because I &quot;worry about this&quot;.  I finally said that since she wants me <br/>
to trust her, then I ask that she trust me when I say that I&#39;m working <br/>
really hard on changing that and to listen more (mutual respect). (I <br/>
haven&#39;t &quot;exploded&quot; in quite a while, but of course this is part of our <br/>
history, and part of our healing process).<br/>
<br/>
So even though I&#39;m very tired today, it was worth it.   She also said <br/>
she now feels more comfortable talking to me face-to-face, and this is <br/>
progress.  I talked about how I could&#39;t talk to my mother about things <br/>
like this, and I don&#39;t want that kind of relationship with her.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked more about the things she wants to explore (dance <br/>
lessons which start the end of the month, horseback riding, which <br/>
means she needs to get up before 3 or 4 in the afternoon to go visit <br/>
different places to find a good fit, just going someplace that <br/>
interests either of us).  She says she&#39;ll get up (and get to bed <br/>
earlier, well, that&#39;s hard for her because she hits her stride after <br/>
midnight!) if we&#39;ve got something planned, but she doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>
take the initiative, she still wants me to help her find opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s a &quot;work in progress&quot; having a teen.  But much better than I <br/>
remember it being when I was that age (and not the &quot;horrible teen <br/>
years&quot; people (who don&#39;t get unschooling) love to roll their eyes <br/>
about when I mention my daughter&#39;s age (sigh....).<br/>
Thanks again for everyone&#39;s input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229300010">I also really apreciate that you shared this with us. I find it  <br/>
incredible how quick, after all, trust can be rebuild. I thought it  <br/>
would take ages! Now I&#39;m unschooling for only three weeks or so, and  <br/>
we&#39;ve been experiencing things like she (7) &#39;ll ask extremely  <br/>
politely for help, which she never did before, I always ended up  <br/>
yelling &quot;WHY don&#39;t you just ASK for help??&quot; WOW, we were so stunned  <br/>
yesterday when she couldn&#39;t reach the toilet paper but was sitting on  <br/>
the toilet already, and asked us instead of starting to whine. We  <br/>
think that this is also just trusting in us again, that when she&#39;ll  <br/>
ask for help, she&#39;ll really get it, so she doesn&#39;t have to make up a  <br/>
show.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t understand is why you don&#39;t want her to talk on the  <br/>
phone when it is that late? Just because it seems &quot;sneaky&quot;? I mean...  <br/>
isn&#39;t it maybe, because then you cannot control it at all, or because  <br/>
then you&#39;ll not know how long it was, or... ? It seems kind of  <br/>
arbitrary a request, not to call late, even though you don&#39;t make it  <br/>
an official prohibition. Because why shouldn&#39;t she? He&#39;s awake, she&#39;s  <br/>
awake, they are in the middle of their &quot;days&quot;, she&#39;s not disturbing  <br/>
anybody, AND she can be in privacy. So what is it, really...<br/>
