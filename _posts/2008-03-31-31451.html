<div id="ygrps-yiv-72697569">What I guess is that if you show her she will think you are crazy and<br/>
don&#39;t know how to play the game right.  I&#39;d go with her way.  If you<br/>
want to show her the &quot;right&quot; way and it&#39;s eating at you, you can<br/>
always frame it as &quot;Hey Pumpkin, I want to show you a game Mommy<br/>
played as a little girl just your age!&quot;  If she asks what it&#39;s called<br/>
just call it something other than what she calls her game.  And show<br/>
her.  She&#39;ll let you know which she prefers.  But for a 3 yr old<br/>
traditional H&S is too hard and they often change the rules or cheat<br/>
to be successful.  So were this my kid I&#39;d let it ride.  But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m right.<br/>

My dds Penny & Emma (Our last name starts with &quot;M&quot;) used to call M&Ms<br/>
&quot;EmmaMs&quot; -- and now that they&#39;ve figured out the &quot;right&quot; way to say<br/>
it, I really, really miss having EmmaMs in my freezer.  Now I only<br/>
have M&M&#39;s and somehow they don&#39;t taste as good.<br/>

her mother has taught her but is totally unable to come up with a  <br/>
game on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Which is more valuable?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492956782">Play it the way it&#39;s FUN for everyone - there are almost as many ways to<br/>
play hide-and-seek as there are kids who&#39;ve played it. If you know a few<br/>
people who grew up in different areas of the country (or other countries<br/>
even!), do a quick poll of the &#39;rules&#39; for some common &#39;children&#39;s&#39;<br/>
game. Odds are you&#39;ll get variations in the way they played. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to work on losing that idea of &quot;actively teaching&quot;.<br/>
Learning IS happening whether you&#39;re &quot;actively teaching&quot; or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334469474">Hi--<br/>
Enjoy your daughter&#39;s creativity! It makes it so much more fun! My 8yr<br/>
old son still does the same thing--we make up rules to all sorts of<br/>
games, pretty much all of them help him win easier and it can get<br/>
really silly and fun and we crack up a lot about the &quot;new rules&quot;. When<br/>
he was really little, he would *place me* where I was to hide and then<br/>
he would go and count (&quot;1,2,7,3,4,2,3...&quot;)  and then look for me and<br/>
ultimately find me and we&#39;d celebrate and whoop, &quot;you found me!&quot; It&#39;s<br/>
all good. <br/>
<br/>
Have you ever read the cartoon Calvin and Hobbes? (a 1st grade boy and<br/>
his stuffed tiger who comes to life when there are no adults around)<br/>
They have an ongoing game called Calvinball where they each make up<br/>
the rules as they play the game and it is a riot. Totally fun and<br/>
absurd. We play monopoly like that, making up the rules as we play so<br/>
we can win in unpredictable silly ways.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy it! There will be plenty of times to learn to play (anything)<br/>
correctly later. You know how in society how people think kids should<br/>
learn things to prepare them for later things? If your daughter<br/>
doesn&#39;t learn &quot;rules of play&quot; correctly now, she&#39;ll learn them later.<br/>
It&#39;s not a big deal. <br/>
~~Enjoy,<br/>
Juillet<br/>
 <br/>

inspired by the moment to play the game but not because I wanted to <br/>
teach the game to the child. If the child showed interest, then I <br/>
would show and/or explain how it&#39;s done. But if the child is already <br/>
playing the game the way s/he wants, I wouldn&#39;t interfere. How very <br/>
cool and creative that she&#39;s come up with her own version of a game.<br/>
<br/>
If you are actively involved with your child, you are being a &quot;good&quot; <br/>
mother. She will learn from being a part of your world.<br/>
