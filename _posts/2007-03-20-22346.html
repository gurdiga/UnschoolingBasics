<div id="ygrps-yiv-938610092">There was a huge discussion recently on here about<br/>
vaccinations and a lot of books and sources were given<br/>
for why not to vaccinate. I have a friend who&#39;s a<br/>
nursing student, pregnant, and dead-set on<br/>
vaccinations. She won&#39;t take any sort of medication<br/>
during her pregnancy, but insists that it&#39;s the best<br/>
thing to vaccinate her infant when it&#39;s born.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I was wondering if people could send<br/>
me the names of those books and things so i can pass<br/>
them on to my friend. I&#39;ve gotten her to the point<br/>
that she&#39;s actually willing to read a little about it. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Notice that your friend is just following the mainstream thinking? <br/>
(Don&#39;t take drugs while pregnant, vaccinate kids) Maybe she is just one <br/>
of the people that the goverment likes that does not question things. <br/>
Perhaps she has really thought it out and came to this conclusion, but <br/>
maybe not!</div>
