<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969531465">We&#39;re new to homeschooling and even newer to uschooling so sometimes <br/>
I come up against situations where I really can&#39;t think on my feet <br/>
and figure out what the unschooling approach would be. Here are 2 <br/>
specific examples. I&#39;d appreciate responses--I&#39;m hoping that some <br/>
insight into different ways to approach a few of my own real-life <br/>
situations will move me along in my day-to-day understanding.<br/>
<br/>
#1--driving in the car on a short trip to do go to an appointment <br/>
for 1 child. Both kids in the car. They&#39;re being silly in the back <br/>
which is fine but at some point it they usually start screaming--<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s just play and sometimes it&#39;s conflict between the 2. <br/>
Today it was play. But I find it startling and distracting for them <br/>
to actually scream. I asked them to stop b/c it was hard for me to <br/>
drive safely when they were screaming. But it kept on and on. I <br/>
tried stopping and letting them &quot;get their screams out&quot; but it <br/>
didn&#39;t help and finally I just got mad and yelled. Not proud.<br/>
<br/>
#2--sometimes we have to go somewhere and I have no options about <br/>
taking the kids. Sometimes my older child (age 7) will get super mad <br/>
about going, will &quot;refuse&quot; to go, and will yell at me. I try to make <br/>
sure he/they have things to do in the car and while we&#39;re gone, give <br/>
them choices about what to take along, and to give them a choice of <br/>
something fun to do afterwards. But sometimes he just has to come <br/>
along. Any ideas for making this situation less painful for us all? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Others will come along with suggestions on what to do in the moment,  <br/>
but three things over all  will help you think about problems in a  <br/>
new way.<br/>
<br/>
1) Expectations. This is probably the biggest source of frustration  <br/>
with kids. We expect a certain behavior from them and become  <br/>
frustrated when they behave differently. It will help a lot to  <br/>
*expect* them to scream while they play. I suspect you&#39;re clinging to  <br/>
the expectation of quiet and when they start screaming it feels like  <br/>
your expectation is beyond your ability to control because you can&#39;t  <br/>
make them do what you want them to.<br/>
<br/>
2) Be proactive rather than reactive. What ways can you help them not  <br/>
need to scream? Run around the backyard before they get in the car?  <br/>
Making sure they&#39;re well fed?<br/>
<br/>
3) There are always other options.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds simplistic, but once you get away from the conventional  <br/>
parenting methods of making kids do things the way we&#39;ve decided they  <br/>
need done, those are foundational building blocks to thinking and  <br/>
looking at the decisions we make differently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sometimes we have to go somewhere and I have no options about<br/>

&gt; about going, will &quot;refuse&quot; to go, and will yell at me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even in an emergency there are options though it might be a challenge  <br/>
for most of us, even those of us who have been doing it a long time,  <br/>
to think of them. But when kids are filled with the confidence that  <br/>
we have always put in effort not to impose on them, they are more  <br/>
willing to go along. When people are filled to the brim with loving  <br/>
consideration, they are willing to be generous with their time with  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The reason people fight what feels like a reasonable request is  <br/>
because they feel that they need to fight to get what they need.  <br/>
*You* may not feel your son is right in those feelings but he isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to react to your feelings ;-) He&#39;s going to react to *his*  <br/>
perception of the world. Trust him. If he feels he&#39;s being dragged  <br/>
about too much, then he *is* being dragged about too much. From his  <br/>
point of view he needs to fight to get what he wants. Change that  <br/>
perception and you&#39;ll change his reaction.<br/>
<br/>
(Though some kids *do* have difficulties with transitions. If your  <br/>
son is one, plenty of people on the list will have ideas on making  <br/>
transitions smoother.)<br/>
<br/>
There are always options. Often we can&#39;t think of them. (Though it  <br/>
gets easier.) Too often it&#39;s inconvenient to think of other options  <br/>
so we close our mind to anything other than what&#39;s easiest for us.  <br/>
It&#39;s *much* easier to pack kids into the car to go to the grocery  <br/>
store than it is to make arrangements to go alone. It feels like  <br/>
we&#39;re giving up our time to do things we &quot;have to&quot; do, so the kids  <br/>
should do. Which is another roadblock in thinking creatively. There  <br/>
isn&#39;t anything we have to do. *Everything* is a choice. We don&#39;t even  <br/>
have to stay with our kids. We *could* choose to leave. Not liking  <br/>
the consequences of the other options is not the same as not having  <br/>
options. It&#39;s hugely freeing when we realize that everything we do is  <br/>
what we&#39;ve chosen to do.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of discussion about &quot;have to&quot; as well as discussion of  <br/>
typical parenting questions at:<br/>

The parenting stuff is on the right and learning is on the left.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to actually scream.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you roll the windows down? I&#39;ve found that helpful. Can you <br/>
encourage them to roar like lions rather than screech like banshees? <br/>
Those are much easier sounds to hear, even at volume.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; #2--sometimes we have to go somewhere and I have no options about <br/>

 </span></blockquote>mad <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about going, will &quot;refuse&quot; to go, and will yell at me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the lead-up to this like? Are you making sure he has plenty <br/>
of warning and that he&#39;s not in the middle of something when you&#39;re <br/>
trying to leave? That includes the middle of a tv show!! I try to  <br/>
plan to leave after a show ends, even if that means leaving half an <br/>
hour earlier. That&#39;s something Mo and I talk about, too - oh, look, <br/>
there are three episodes of Spongebob coming up, and I want to go <br/>
after the first one. That may make it tough to leave, how do we want <br/>
to handle that? Sometimes she&#39;s okay watching just one episode, <br/>
other times she&#39;ll actually suggest turning the tv off sooner so she <br/>
doesn&#39;t get sucked in and not want to leave. <br/>
<br/>
Something else I find helpful with Mo is to include her in the <br/>
getting-ready-to-go process by means of a list. Being involved in <br/>
the process helps her not *get* in the middle of something. She <br/>
loves lists, loves to be able to see how many things are left to do <br/>
(I put everything on the list, too, like &quot;go pee&quot; and &quot;find keys&quot;) <br/>
and she loves being the one to cross things off. Otherwise the <br/>
process of getting out the door can seem overwhelming to her. <br/>
<br/>
Recently Mo hasn&#39;t been wanting to go to the big park in Nashville <br/>
at all, which is challenging bc that&#39;s where the skatepark is - and <br/>
Ray likes to skate. So I&#39;ve been looking into alternatives so that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have to come along - either someone else taking Ray or <br/>
someone else hanging out with Mo. Interestingly, since I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that, on the occasions where I can&#39;t come up with another <br/>
option (or the option falls through) she&#39;s been much more <br/>
accomodating about *having* to go along and has good suggestions for <br/>
ways she can be okay with the situation. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and to give them a choice of <br/>
&gt; something fun to do afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This takes a little advance planning in terms of time, but what <br/>
about doing something fun *before* - maybe not big fun like going to <br/>
the park, but little fun like a stop at a store or a drive-thru to <br/>
pick up a toy? That&#39;s often one of Mo&#39;s suggestions. A brand-new toy <br/>
to explore - even a cheap one that&#39;s only going to last the <br/>
afternoon - can take the blahs out of a dull trip to town. That <br/>
still leaves *after* as an option, too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! (I keep thinking of things) its also good to look at what the <br/>
day after is like for these outings that he&#39;s refusing. One of the <br/>
reasons Mo doesn&#39;t like going to the Nashville park is that we end <br/>
up being gone most of the day, and she&#39;s an introvert, so the next <br/>
day she spends a whole lot of time de-compressing. So from her <br/>
perspective, going to the park is a two-day trip. If she has a lot <br/>
of projects going on at home, that&#39;s a real bummer. This wasn&#39;t an <br/>
issue when she was younger bc she had less of a conception of time - <br/>
its only since she has started to understand the whole today-<br/>
tommorrow-yesterday thing that she hasn&#39;t wanted to go to the big <br/>
park. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575435934">Thank you, Joyce and Meredith, for your replies. Very helpful. Taking a new look at expectations is a great recommendation and one I&#39;ve been spending lots of time thinking about. Also, thanks for the reminder of your website Joyce. Helpful to roam there again.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m so grateful to all the discussions on this list. It&#39;s invaluable to have such guides on this journey!<br/>
