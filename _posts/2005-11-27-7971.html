   <br/>
  Years ago, I brought my daughter home for the first time after a bad ninth grade year.  We unschooled throughout the rest of her &#39;high school&#39; time.  As a side note , she is 23 now and will graduate from college next year.  She has a great boyfriend and a couple of hobbies that bring extra joy to her life.  I only mention all this because sometimes it helps to hear how it worked out for other people.<br/>
  I brought her home after I had already started with her younger sister.  She de-schooled for about four months, which is a really short time I know.  But it was the right amount for her.  She matured a bit later by &#39;normal&#39; standards, for instance she didn&#39;t even want to drive until she was 17, got her first job at 18, but we feel she did things as SHE was ready and didn&#39;t have the pressure of a peer group to make her feel otherwise. <br/>
  When she first came home I sat down with her and a map because she loves to travel.  I asked her to find 3 places that wold be fun to visit within a days drive.  Then I asked her to find two places to go within 2 days drive, and that&#39;s how we started, spending time on the road together, listening to audio books and music, and having lots of time to talk.  Of course there was a lot of exploring and finding out about the places she was interested in.  We really didn&#39;t spend that much money as we packed a lot of our food and only ate out when we came across really neat places.  We almost always found yet another place on the way to go back to. We never went so far that we had more than one or two maybe 3 nights in a motel but we had a lot of good times, built a lot of memories.  I didn&#39;t spend any more money than I wold have on clothes for school, lunch money and probably therapy if I hadn&#39;t taken her out. This is what got us started.  As time went on she did things like sign up for<br/>
 dance classes, gave piano lessons to young children and such that tied us closer to the house and that&#39;s OK.  We still reminisce about those trips, so much so that she talks about how she wants to do that with her kids when she has them someday.  So maybe it&#39;s a jumping off point?<br/>
  One last thing, she loves to come over for a cup of tea and just chat.  On Thanksgiving I overheard her explaining to her boyfriend that she feels she can talk to me about anything.  To me that says it all...if you can bring her home today, do it.<br/>
