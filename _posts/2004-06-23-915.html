<div id="ygrps-yiv-889782022">I don&#39;t know, Ren,<br/>
I haven&#39;t given up the word teaching or even left it to those who would use<br/>
coercive or controlling methods.  When I learn something and another person<br/>
was instrumental in the process of my learning I still say, &quot;she taught me&quot;<br/>
such and such.  Just the other day my daughter taught her sister to do a<br/>
cartwheel.  My son taught me how to win a level on Sonic and I taught oldest<br/>
dd how to make a fancy cursive capital S for her signature.  In this way you<br/>
could say we&#39;re all teaching each other every day.<br/>
I will have to think about how to verbalize the difference between this sort<br/>
of teaching and the schools&#39; controlling of another&#39;s learning.  So far all<br/>
I&#39;ve come up with has been pretty long-winded or awkward.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620850177">This reminds me of my 6 week post partum visit with my midwife after my<br/>
first was born.  I said something to the baby like &quot;here&#39;s the lady who<br/>
delivered you.&quot;  And she immediately said &quot;no, I didn&#39;t deliver you,<br/>
your mommy delivered you.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe instead of thinking that your son taught you, as in a thing that<br/>
can be done to someone, think of it as you learned from him, as in you<br/>
accepted his help and knowledge freely, and he offered it freely for you<br/>
to take or leave as you chose.  That emphasizes your control over your<br/>
own learning while still acknowledging his generosity.<br/>
