<div id="ygrps-yiv-161764367">Okay, I have another challenge.  My son, who is almost 10 years old, <br/>
has been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome.  The label doesn&#39;t <br/>
concern me, nor do most of his behaviors.  He&#39;s just himself.  We <br/>
are concerned with a recent behavior of hair pulling and twisting <br/>
that has resulted in hair loss.  At first he was upset by it but now <br/>
he says he doesn&#39;t even see the bald patch on his head and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t think there is a problem.  We&#39;ve also been dealing with some <br/>
other medical issues for nearly 5 years now and with my research on <br/>
Aspergers, I found some interesting information regarding diet.  <br/>
I&#39;ve found some recommendations for a Gluten Free Casein Free diet <br/>
for children suffering the same issues my son has been dealing <br/>
with.  I&#39;ve also learned some negative information about a <br/>
medication he&#39;s been on for almost 5 years for constipation.  I&#39;d <br/>
like to see him off this medication but he&#39;s going to have to change <br/>
his diet.  He is a very particular eater, because of these issues, <br/>
and the diet would mean a drastic change to his familiar diet.  But <br/>
from what I read, the kids who make it to the other end are truly <br/>
happy with the changes even if they were resistant to the diet in <br/>
the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, we&#39;re unschoolers.  I don&#39;t like forcing anything upon my son.  <br/>
I&#39;d rather discuss it with him and have him leading the way with me <br/>
in a supporting role rather than me dragging him along.  Has anyone <br/>
dealt with a situation like this from an unschooling point of view?  <br/>
If my son is adamantly against the changes, and he is at this point, <br/>
do I just drop it and wait for him to make the choice at a later <br/>
time?  I&#39;m trying to find compromises but he has a real fear of new <br/>
things.  The fears are part of his Aspergers which I know would <br/>
improve if we could change his diet.  How do I approach this?<br/>

What happens if he doesn&#39;t take the medication?  Your son is old<br/>
enough to be able to talk to him about diet and how it is impacting<br/>
his health.  Heck, Emily was 4 when we talked about how certain<br/>
ingredients impacted her health.  She&#39;s made decisions based on how<br/>
she felt to not consume (or consume much of) those ingredients.  He<br/>
may be willing to change what he eats if he can be guaranteed that<br/>
some of his favorites will remain, such as bread, but just not wheat<br/>
bread, etc.  Have you read Doris Rupp&#39;s books?  She is the most well<br/>
written author on behavioural allergies.  Very good information.  And<br/>
with the age of your son you could easily do these things together.<br/>
If he chooses not to follow a specific diet things are not going to<br/>
get worse than they are now, right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033120161">I don&#39;t know if the diet will help your son or not. I have a son with  <br/>
aspergers, a daughter with autism, one with adhd, one with SAD. We  <br/>
tried the diet. It didn&#39;t help any one of them. From what I&#39;ve  <br/>
personally witnessed, it doesn&#39;t help most children. Some of the  <br/>
studies that the articles are based on were flawed for several  <br/>
reasons, primarily to me is that the number of participants were low,  <br/>
less than ten in most cases, and don&#39;t reflect the overall population  <br/>
who have a spectrum disorder. Some of the studies aren&#39;t experiments  <br/>
but merely presentation of epidemiological observations, and some in  <br/>
turn were affected by the scientist knowing who was on which diet  <br/>
(particularly the one from 1994, i don&#39;t recall the name, sorry)<br/>
<br/>
I only say all this because I hate for anyone to go into something  <br/>
like this *knowing* that it will *cure* their child. In my work in  <br/>
the autism society, I&#39;ve seen dozens of families start this diet,  <br/>
only to have their hopes crushed when little changes. I&#39;ve seen a few  <br/>
families whom have been helped, but it&#39;s difficult to say why it  <br/>
worked, when they start a couple of meds, new therapies, and change  <br/>
the way they parent due to diagnosis all at the same time. If you  <br/>
plan on changing any drugs he is taking, I would suggest spacing the  <br/>
change by at least six weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do this diet, be prepared to find lots of alternatives  <br/>
that are appealing. You&#39;ll need to do the diet for six months to a  <br/>
year, because it takes at least 28 days for all proteins to clear the  <br/>
system, and a few more months for any damage to be repaired. We did  <br/>
the gluten-free diet before we were unschoolers, it was difficult  <br/>
because of me. We do have several special diets, ironically, years  <br/>
after our gluten free diet we have two younger children with celiac  <br/>
disease ;-) So we know where we are going there. It&#39;s tougher than  <br/>
you think, be sure to join a celiac support group, because wheat is  <br/>
soo hidden, toothpaste, shampoo, playdough, fingerpaints, all of  <br/>
those are things that make our boys very sick. My daughter with  <br/>
autism is on a corn free diet, which we found oddly, while trying to  <br/>
abstain from wheat. Totally reacts to that. She&#39;s a little tougher,  <br/>
but probably because she&#39;s very very developmentally delayed. The  <br/>
boys didn&#39;t have a choice about the diet. But I work hard to make  <br/>
sure there are alternatives, so I just say &quot;That has wheat in it, let  <br/>
me get  you some wheat-free&quot;. Breanna has been off of corn for maybe  <br/>
eighteen months? I have let her have some of the products every now  <br/>
and then, and she can feel the change. Sometimes she likes it, and I  <br/>
have to bite my tongue. But most of the time, she&#39;s very  <br/>
uncomfortable. And I&#39;m starting to see her think about it. When I  <br/>
point out it has corn in it, she&#39;ll choose something else (usually  <br/>
after throwing one of her tantrums, which I don&#39;t blame her, it  <br/>
sucks, corn syrup is in EVERYTHING good!)<br/>
<br/>
HOpe all this is okay, I&#39;m probably missing vital stuff or sounding  <br/>
like a prig. DH will be back today, and I am so glad. A full week  <br/>
with little help is a little crazy, and *I* am totally crazy. LMK if  <br/>
you have any other questions, or if I need to rephrase anything.<br/>

Beth, I am going to suggest the food enzymes created to  replace the GFCF <br/>
diet before you try the diet.  My kids have been on  them since Nov. and I have <br/>
seen remarkable progress.  You can get info at  _www.enzymestuff.com_ <br/>
(http://www.enzymestuff.com)  and some at _www.houstonni.com_ <br/>
(http://www.houstonni.com) .  I would be happy to  answer any questions off-list.<br/>
 <br/>
The GFCF diet is hard and expensive and often takes months before you  notice <br/>
if it is working or not.  I highly recommending trying the enzyme  approach <br/>
first.<br/>
 <br/>
But, I will say that diet is a big issue in my home.  We have gone off  <br/>
artificial colors and we are working towards removing most other  artificials.  <br/>
Unfortunately, some kids just don&#39;t tolerate this stuff  well.  It is hard <br/>
balancing out food freedom and problem foods, but with my  kids, it makes such a <br/>
huge difference in our entire family and unschooling  life!  Sometimes I handle <br/>
it better than others and I just keep trying to  do my best.  <br/>
 <br/>
I keep lots of good alternatives around, do a lot of talking, and try to  <br/>
keep safe food free and easily accessed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723091866">Speaking of synthetics and artificial colors and flavors, our family follows the Feingold Diet (www.feingold.org) which eliminates all of those things. My oldest dd and my ds are the targest, but we&#39;ve all seen improvements.  Most members have children with AS, ADD/ADHD, autism, and other differences.  We all have seen great improvements on the program. <br/>
   <br/>
  Take a few minutes to look into it.  It&#39;s well worth the time investigating, and the membership fees.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197531788">I appreciate all the responses so far.  Here is some more <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
The medication I mentioned is Miralax.  He&#39;s been on it for almost 5 <br/>
years.  It&#39;s an osmotic laxative that has a suggestion to use it for <br/>
2 weeks unless prescribed longer by a doctor.  5 years??  And I just <br/>
found out on the main website for the medication that it isn&#39;t even <br/>
approved to be used in children.  The doctors at Kaiser don&#39;t seem <br/>
concerned in the least about figuring out WHY my son suffers from <br/>
chronic constipation.  They tell me he&#39;ll outgrow this problem <br/>
eventually.  Every time I&#39;ve lowered the daily doseage to attempt to <br/>
get him off of it, he gets a stool impaction and requires an enema.  <br/>
To say this has been a long unpleasant ordeal is quite an <br/>
understatement.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s diet is mostly carbs and dairy.  I&#39;m fairly positive his <br/>
bowel issues are because of his diet but he doesn&#39;t care because as <br/>
long as he&#39;s on the Miralax, he feels like it&#39;s okay to eat whatever <br/>
he wants.  I have talked to him about this but he&#39;d rather eat what <br/>
he wants and take the Miralax than change his diet.  My DH thinks we <br/>
need to implement changes.  I&#39;m caught in the middle, not sure <br/>
what&#39;s best.  I do not know if diet changes would make this problem <br/>
better.  I&#39;m only making a guess.<br/>
<br/>
As for the hair pulling, we have suggested a shorter hair cut but <br/>
Jeffrey is definitely against that solution.  He likes the feel of <br/>
his hair long, on his neck and over his ears.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293471518">Beth, I don&#39;t usually post here; but we radically unschool and have <br/>
dietary issues which we handle with full consent of our son, who is <br/>
5. It is much harder to implement than to have always done it this <br/>
way, I imagine. And it is difficult to have a diet free of foods <br/>
which create behavioral concerns for the whole family. I would say <br/>
that our son was about age 3 when he could identify which foods had <br/>
artificial colors, dairy and protein and chose with awareness (not <br/>
requiring agreement or approval on my part though). His choices have <br/>
been his to make. <br/>
<br/>
However, we do discuss our observations and our concerns regarding <br/>
his behavior which directly effects us; and we discuss <br/>
correlations/patterns associated with specific food ingredients. It <br/>
is easier to see correlations since our diet is generally free of <br/>
dairy, soy, wheat, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, <br/>
flavors and preservatives and high salicylate foods.....usually. <br/>
<br/>
We basically follow the Feingold Diet and see dramatic correllations <br/>
between the food ingredients and his sleep, physical aggression, <br/>
vocalizations, ability to negotiate and consider other&#39;s personal <br/>
boundaries and needs, and hyperactive/restlessness. The most <br/>
important aspect is providing preferred substitutions, NOT <br/>
eliminating choice. This has taken years of reading labels of <br/>
ingredients on everything that comes into our home to find hundreds <br/>
of foods that are free of additives and taste wonderful to our <br/>
individual tastes. Outside of our home, we bring our favorites, we <br/>
consume the culprit foods, we find substitutes and we delay <br/>
consumption, depending upon individual preferences. <br/>
<br/>
I have heard incredible benefits about the enzymes also. And we are <br/>
considering that alternative ourselves. We also have added <br/>
magnesium, cod liver oil, and coconut oil as important dietary <br/>
supplements, which are often associated with sensory integration <br/>
behaviors. Again, these are utilized with ds&#39;s preferences (flavors-<br/>
natural, consumption, refusal, etc). And we use additive free <br/>
multivitamin supplements for good measure. <br/>
<br/>
The intervention that has helped our son&#39;s dietary tolerance the <br/>
most has been classical homeopathy. As an infant, there were many <br/>
MORE foods that we avoided due to gastric issues associated with <br/>
them. There are also some &quot;food allergy homeopathics&quot; which are used <br/>
at the time of consuming a culprit food. For instance there is one <br/>
for wheat, dairy, corn, etc. These are taken when you anticipate, or <br/>
ate, the food that causes symptoms. This is acute homeopathy, which <br/>
is different than classical homeopathy. But, dh and ds have had <br/>
significant improvement of many different allergy issues with <br/>
classical homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
Classical homeopathy would address the hair pulling, twisting, <br/>
constipation, carb craving, etc. I highly recommend considering this <br/>
alternative in conjunction with making gradual dietary changes and <br/>
facilitating awareness about food and behavior, with your son&#39;s <br/>
agreement, of course. I suspect that the sensory seeking and <br/>
repetitive behaviors are associated with dairy. Our son&#39;s sensory <br/>
seeking behaviors certainly are directly associated with dairy <br/>
consumption frequency and quantity. He becomes physically aggressive <br/>
about one hour after consumption and it lasts for 1-6 hours, <br/>
depending upon amount consumed. <br/>
<br/>
From what I understand, it takes about 3-10 days to see significant <br/>
behavioral changes after eliminating dairy. And then it is easier to <br/>
see the effects/benefits. Some people see changes in only one or two <br/>
days of a dairy free diet. However, dairy (including casein and <br/>
whey) is hard to eliminate. Wheat is harder to eliminate; and corn <br/>
syrup is the hardest to eliminate, ime. But, they are not hard to <br/>
avoid once we are aware. And our son&#39;s willingness to avoid <br/>
ingredients is directly related to how much he has recently <br/>
consumed. Not from a taste pov, but from an cognitive awareness of <br/>
cause/effect pov. <br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s 13-year old felt so much better on the Feingold Diet that <br/>
he chooses to continue it after willingly trying it for one week. <br/>
You might discuss that type of trial run with your son. But, you&#39;d <br/>
need to find the substitute foods first and not expose him to <br/>
temptation by eating stuff in front of him for the duration. Our <br/>
whole family chooses a similar diet for convienence and support. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;d tell your dh, as soon as *he* joins in, ds would probably be <br/>
more willing to give it a go. We use EarthFare for most packaged, <br/>
processed and fresh foods free of additives. They have nitrate and <br/>
nitrite free bacon for instance. I believe that Whole Foods has a <br/>
similar selection. Check out www.Feingold.org for more information. <br/>
I believe it is well worth the effort.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129902362">Pat, thank you for the very detailed post.  My son and I have been <br/>
talking and he&#39;s warming up to the ideas.  It&#39;s just taking patient <br/>
discussion to help him see the &#39;middle&#39; areas he often overlooks.  <br/>
He&#39;s an all-or-nothing type personality so his initial thoughts are <br/>
either that he gets to eat what he wants or he can&#39;t have any of the <br/>
foods he likes.  We&#39;re going to work on finding acceptable <br/>
alternatives before we make any drastic changes.  I&#39;ll take a look at <br/>
the Feingold diet too.  thanks!!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706236599">***We are concerned with a recent behavior of hair pulling and twisting <br/>
that has resulted in hair loss. ***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe since he knows now that he can pull his hair right out, he&#39;ll<br/>
modify his twisting in time, to reduce the chances of hair loss.  <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with hair twisting.  He probably isn&#39;t interested<br/>
in really pulling his hair out.  I&#39;d remain calm and see how he handles<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
***I found some interesting information regarding diet. ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m personally irked by these threads about diet and behavior or diet as<br/>
a cure for a wispy diagnosis.   I know some people shouldn&#39;t eat certain<br/>
things but the majority of unschoolers are not people with special<br/>
dietary needs.   I&#39;m skeptical.   Omnivorous humans have been eating<br/>
fluctuating diets for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.  <br/>
Now I hope there won&#39;t be a flood of mail about how this or that kid or<br/>
someone would DIE if they ate this or that something.  The deal is, most<br/>
people can eat without fear of death and I get grumpy when the list turns<br/>
into a fear of foods list instead of an unschooling list.  <br/>
<br/>
If your son has been on a laxative for five years, how do you know that<br/>
with time, off the meds and in a calm and stress free house, his body<br/>
wouldn&#39;t find it&#39;s right balance?    What, in your mind, makes the<br/>
largely anecdotal promise of better health from a gluten free, casein<br/>
free diet more valid that the evidence unschoolers have been giving for<br/>
years and years about peaceful home life and calm mothers, freedom to<br/>
choose and varied diet?  <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;d like to see him off this medication but he&#39;s going to have to<br/>
change <br/>
his diet. ***<br/>
<br/>
Why is he &quot;going to have to&quot; change his diet?   How do you even know how<br/>
his body is going to react off the meds?  How do you even know if this<br/>
new diet will help him?     <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re concerned about constipation maybe adding more fiber to the<br/>
things he already likes to eat will be enough.   Maybe adding a vitamin<br/>
supplement with magnesium will be enough.   Maybe more orange juice would<br/>
be enough.  Maybe going for a walk with him every morning would be<br/>
enough.   None of those things would be things he&#39;d &quot;have to&quot; do, just<br/>
ideas if, after time off the meds, he&#39;d like to try ways to get more<br/>
comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
How much pressure are you willing to put on him or how much force are you<br/>
willing to subject him to, on the vague promise things will improve?  <br/>
That&#39;s my caution.  I&#39;d start with a calm mind, a peaceful house,  a<br/>
helpful, willing attitude, suggestions if he&#39;s having problems and a lot<br/>
of time and freedom and help (not force) for him to come to his own terms<br/>
with whatever his personal issues are.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657117244">***He is a very particular eater, because of these issues, <br/>
and the diet would mean a drastic change to his familiar diet.  But <br/>
from what I read, the kids who make it to the other end are truly <br/>
happy with the changes even if they were resistant to the diet in <br/>
the first place.  ***<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking for permission?  <br/>
<br/>
You can do what you want.  Lots and lots of people would say you&#39;d be<br/>
doing the right thing to force your son to accept the diet you think he<br/>
should be eating.   <br/>
<br/>
People released from kidnappers are sympathetic to the kidnappers cause<br/>
even though they didn&#39;t want to be kidnapped.<br/>
People who graduate from school believe school was necessary even though<br/>
they were miserable there.<br/>
<br/>
You can eventually convince a kid that his suffering or misery is good<br/>
for him.    <br/>
<br/>
If you change his diet and he doesn&#39;t want to and if you fight with him<br/>
about it sometimes or get frustrated with him about it sometimes and in<br/>
the end the diet doesn&#39;t help enough to warrant the fight or frustration<br/>
you run the risk of having altered your relationship and lost some of<br/>
your credibility.   That&#39;s the danger of taking his choice away.    That<br/>

Our experince has rung true for what Deb is suggesting.  Our son has <br/>

various diets were suggested.  Trying to implement them brought too <br/>

freedom and time and support are by far the greatest gifts that has <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458311267">Actually, this is not true in many cases. As recently as 2-3 years ago, <br/>
DH had to give up his Van Dyke b/c he couldn&#39;t stop pulling the hairs <br/>
out and (sorry) eating them. It&#39;s called trichotillomania (sp?) and is <br/>
a form of OCD I believe. Even being 30ish years old and knowing that <br/>
pulling those hairs out made his beard look patchy and sparse couldn&#39;t <br/>
stop him. He eventually had to just go clean-shaven and has been so <br/>
ever since. He also has to keep his head hair short, though that&#39;s also <br/>
because it just looks better that way (he has a really big head!).<br/>
<br/>
This may not be the phenomenon that you are dealing with, but if he&#39;s <br/>
pulling hard enough to pull the hair out by the root it may be a strong <br/>
compulsion that he has trouble fighting. It might not be as simple as <br/>
wanting to twirl and accidentally pulling it out and being able to stop <br/>
doing it at will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130951479">Oh Deb, if it were that easy, I would have done it long ago.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t eat much fiber because he doesn&#39;t like the things that fiber <br/>
is found in.  The problem is that we do let him make his own choices <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t eat or drink the things that make his body function <br/>
normally.  I didn&#39;t mean for this thread to turn into a <br/>
diet/behavior discussion, but how to address such needs in an <br/>
unschooling atmosphere.  Jeffrey knows all too well what it feels <br/>
like to be impacted.  It&#39;s painful, and there is a possibility of <br/>
toxins leaking out and poisoning the body.  Some people have gotten <br/>
very sick from this and some have even died of an impaction causing <br/>
bowels to rupture.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to everything to be laid back, non-stressful, happy and <br/>
average.  Believe me.  But the question is what do we do when a body <br/>
just doesn&#39;t act natural by itself?  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s very difficult <br/>
for you to understand but I&#39;m living with it on a daily basis.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the hair pulling, look up trichotillomania.  That&#39;s a real <br/>
disorder.  Fortunately, I don&#39;t think my son suffers from it <br/>
specifically, but rather as part of his autistic behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for letting people live natually the way they are meant to <br/>
be, but not looking into medical solutions when the situation <br/>
warrants it is negligent, don&#39;t you think?  I&#39;m simply looking into <br/>
options because for the past 5 years we&#39;ve done nothing except give <br/>
him the Miralax.  We have followed his lead on foods, never forcing <br/>
him to eat things he doesn&#39;t want to eat.  I specifically find the <br/>
foods he wants, like if we want to eat out and everyone wants Wendys <br/>
but he wants McDonald&#39;s fries only because he hates everything <br/>
else.  I totally understand and never make him feel bad for him <br/>
choosing other foods than we eat.  But I&#39;m watching his involuntary <br/>
behaviors such as hand flapping, hand smelling, pacing, twisting & <br/>
pulling hair, and insomnia gradually become more of a problem for <br/>
him.  If changing his diet might help those things, why wouldn&#39;t I <br/>
want to try it?  Obviously life as it is now isn&#39;t working out well <br/>
for him.  So what would you propose I do?  Seriously?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101212868">Not at all.  I think any and all topics should be posted. Radical unschooling encompasses all aspects of life.  My comment was that when the discussion moves from unschooling issues to diet restrictions in particular I feel that we have left the unschooling arena and when that occurs then it would probably be best continued that particular topic off-line privately e-mailing. <br/>
<br/>
I also have a special needs son (diagnosed PDD-NOS on the autism spectrum with ADHD).  You might also find help and support on the SHINE list.  I am growing as our family learns more and more about unschooling through trial and error, reading  and also posting and reviewing discussions on groups like these.<br/>
<br/>
We are at a place in our journey now in our family where we do a lot of talking.  We consider each member of the family a member of the team.  We are trying to deschool and also detox ourselves from past messages power and control.  It is a wonderful and exciting journey with moments of joy and moments of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
I think exploring unschooling will help you and your family find what works best for you and your family.  The only thing I would caution you about is that we tried to make too many changes at the same time in the beginning of our exploration.  This resulted in us feeling overwhelmed and questioning the whole unschooling paradigm instead of the way in which we were trying to make the transition :)<br/>
<br/>
I am not a medical doctor and would not presume to advise you regarding impacted stool.  If you are unsure about what your current doctor is telling you, how about seeking a second professional opinion?  There are holistic doctors as well.  You may need to travel further to see one and your insurance may not pay for them but it is worth looking into if you want a more holistic perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would not take my child off his medication if it was against his doctor&#39;s advice unless I had another doctor that I was going to replace my previous doctor with.   But that in it of itself is a debate that should be pursued privately off line.  You may do so with me if you would like to do so.<br/>

the child at all, then they might as well try not to unschool at<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not at all!<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t just about freedom, as we discussed before. Freedom<br/>
without awareness is just plain crazy. Awareness dictates that we are<br/>
in tune with our children and obviously concerned for safety and health. <br/>
<br/>
If my child had diabetes, I wouldn&#39;t just leave the M&M jar sitting<br/>
out like I do now. I&#39;d be damn sure I had foods they liked that they<br/>
could safely eat though. It&#39;s about respecting the desires of the<br/>
individual within the very REAL limitations that life can throw at us<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I think diet discussions are very relevant to this list.  Finding ways<br/>
to address health concerns while still respecting the autonomy of the<br/>
individual are on par with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT a fan of diets, nor do I think an entire family needs to be<br/>
on one just because an individual has real health issues. At the same<br/>
time, I wouldn&#39;t want to eat foods that would be problematic for one<br/>
child right in front of them. There are creative ways to meet the<br/>
needs of all members. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I trust my own inner knowledge and guidance more than any<br/>
doctor. I use doctors as consultants and do my OWN research to make<br/>
decisions. I would certainly trust my own research on the medication<br/>
over what ANY damn doctor told me and do whatever it took to get my<br/>
child off of it, while finding alternative ways to keep them healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Constipation is no joke, but at what point do you decide that he can&#39;t<br/>
be medicated for his entire life and try to find better solutions?  I<br/>
would want to understand the health issue, not just medicate it and<br/>
ignore it.  There are a number of ways to help children get healthy<br/>
food, without being controlling. Monkey platters disappear quite<br/>
readily around here and my children happily eat a variety of foods.<br/>
We can discuss many solutions to the desire for healthier eating,<br/>
without reverting to mainstream methods that lack respect for the child.<br/>

<br/>
I think these are really great questions!<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, when our children have very real issues and problems, we<br/>
try to look at a variety of solutions. Diet may be one of those issues.<br/>
<br/>
I think at this point, maybe various list members could come up with<br/>
yummy, interesting foods that you could prepare and offer up that have<br/>
more fiber. I personally love smoothies for this. My kids ADORE them<br/>
and you can even slip great supplements in that they won&#39;t taste.<br/>
<br/>
We blend frozen fruit (raspberries, blackberries and strawberries are<br/>
faves) with 1/2 can frozen OJ concentrate and some milk. They&#39;re thick<br/>
and really yummy. Some banana adds a great flavor too.<br/>
<br/>
Some delicious and healthful foods might address the whole<br/>
constipation issue, but I really think that most of his behaviors are<br/>
something you have to accept as part of HIM. The more we can meet our<br/>
children where they&#39;re at, the more peaceful things can be. Instead of<br/>
seeing his behavior as something that needs changing, maybe you can<br/>
focus more on how it&#39;s all part of the package, part of his beauty?<br/>
<br/>
I realize that some of it might be really hard. If there are areas<br/>
frustrating him, of course you want to find ways to ease his<br/>
frustration. Some of it is simply part of his personal development and<br/>
learning process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589901123">&quot;Diet&quot; isn&#39;t always the right word, either, especially in the case of all of us wanting to give freedom to our family instead of dictating rules and restrictions.  &quot;Lifestyle&quot; or &quot;meal plan&quot; might be better words to use than &quot;diet&quot;.  <br/>
   <br/>
  For my family, I don&#39;t dictate a specific diet that restricts foods from them.  We follow a meal plan that coincides with an additive-free lifestyle, and we don&#39;t restrict any particular food- just certain brands.  The new lifestyle was also began over a year ago with everyone&#39;s full knowledge and agreement after much discussion. <br/>
   <br/>
  For instance, we don&#39;t buy Oreos.  Instead we buy Newman-O&#39;s.  All of us enjoy the flavor as much and in some cases more than the Nabisco brands of the same type of cookies (choc oreos, gingersnaps, and choc mints), so there has been nothing lost or restricted.  I know all of us would have been upset to lose certain food items, but none of us have complained about the brands we have switched to so that we could keep our favorite foods.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242341978">Just some thoughts that came up for me around different word choices.  Diet has many definitions.  I think the one that I was reacting to is the definition :to eat or drink in a prescribed regimen.  The Feingold Diet I believe fits into that definition.  It was the discussion of the use of that specific diet in particular that I was suggesting be done off line.  Or perhaps it is because of the many and exhausting conversations I have had with some of the people I have met in an autism support group locally who use that diet (although none are unschoolers). We ended up doing our own reading and experimenting and didn&#39;t feel it did enough to warrant all the struggles.  That was the right decision for our family.<br/>
<br/>
  I have been so distanced from my own inner knowledge and guidance that I still like working with medical professionals as part of my medical team.  <br/>
  When I have gone off some of my medications at different times I needed to do so under the advise of a physician not only because of having been on them so long and at such a high dose but also because on those particular medications it can cause complications to stop taking them too quickly.  I only learned that because I had discontinued medications before on my own that I didn&#39;t realize had to be tapered and it caused me problems.  <br/>
<br/>
  In our household there are just too many different and complicated medical conditions for me to research them all well in addition to keep up to date on the new research . I select my doctors (and the ones for my son) carefully and if they are willing to develop a relationship with me, answer any and all of my questions, treat me with respect, be open to exploring new ideas, try new things (including trying to be taken off a previous medication) then I remain with them.  If not, I move on until I can find one who will. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153134804">Huh? Where in my post did I suggest that the child should be forced to <br/>
do anything? I was merely commenting that these compulsions are very <br/>
strong, and the child was probably not pulling their hair out <br/>
accidentally as a side-effect of twirling it.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond to my actual words in the future, and do not make me out <br/>

&gt;  &gt; Actually, this is not true in many cases. As recently as 2-3 years <br/>

&gt;  &gt; DH had to give up his Van Dyke b/c he couldn&#39;t stop pulling the <br/>
&gt; hairs<br/>
&gt;  &gt; out and (sorry) eating them. It&#39;s called trichotillomania (sp?) and <br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt;  &gt; a form of OCD I believe. Even being 30ish years old and knowing that<br/>
&gt;  &gt; pulling those hairs out made his beard look patchy and sparse <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  &gt; stop him. He eventually had to just go clean-shaven and has been so<br/>
&gt;  &gt; ever since. He also has to keep his head hair short, though that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt;  &gt; because it just looks better that way (he has a really big head!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You are talking about an adult and it sounds as though he chose to do<br/>
&gt;  these things on his own. Did you force him to shave and crop his hair<br/>
&gt;  or did he do these for himself as he didn&#39;t like have a patchy beard<br/>
&gt;  and thought he looked better with short hair? The difference is that<br/>
&gt;  we are talking about a child and that child learning to trust the<br/>
&gt;  adults/parents in his life. Trust is not going to be gained by a<br/>
&gt;  parent forcing a child to do things because the adults think that the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097830962">***He doesn&#39;t eat much fiber because he doesn&#39;t like the things that<br/>
fiber<br/>
is found in. ***<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things does he like?   What do you make for him?  In a<br/>
typical day, what will he eat?   If you give us some info we can help you<br/>
find ways of offering higher fiber choices along with what he usually<br/>
likes. <br/>
<br/>
***The problem is that we do let him make his own choices<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t eat or drink the things that make his body function<br/>
normally. ***<br/>
<br/>
Five years ago you put him on medication.  He&#39;s not in the same place he<br/>
was in five years ago and you are a different mom now, these five years<br/>
later.   You can give him information about what might help him feel<br/>
better.  You can provide a variety of foods.  You can talk about what the<br/>
medication did for him and what foods might do that same thing without<br/>
the possibility of side effects.   <br/>
<br/>
The problem is not that he has choice.  The problem is constipation.  How<br/>
do you address that problem?   Taking away his choice might result in<br/>
added stress and stress is one factor in ill health.  <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m sure that&#39;s very difficult<br/>
for you to understand but I&#39;m living with it on a daily basis.***<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be too sure.  My son has debilitating psoriatic arthritis.  <br/>
<br/>
***As for the hair pulling, look up trichotillomania. That&#39;s a real<br/>
disorder. Fortunately, I don&#39;t think my son suffers from it<br/>
specifically, but rather as part of his autistic behaviors.***<br/>
<br/>
And lots and lots of kids twist and pull their hair and don&#39;t have<br/>
disorders.   Lot&#39;s and lots of kids would figure out they don&#39;t want to<br/>
pull out their hair and they would modify their behavior themselves if<br/>
they weren&#39;t made to feel like everything they did was a compulsion or<br/>
symptom of some disorder they have no control over.    <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m simply looking into<br/>
options because for the past 5 years we&#39;ve done nothing except give<br/>
him the Miralax. ***<br/>
<br/>
Do you really mean that for five years you had a child with chronic<br/>
constipation and did *nothing* but give him medicine? <br/>
<br/>
He should have been living in a house were people made good food choices,<br/>
where people talked about what foods made them feel better, what foods<br/>
have natural fiber.  What foods contribute to constipation.   He should<br/>
have been provided with information all along about his body and health. <br/>
All kids should be.  That&#39;s not the same as being made to eat what mom<br/>
wants you to eat, it means having good information and good foods<br/>
available as part of a wide choice of foods.  <br/>
<br/>
If you make pancakes you can add bran.  Same with waffles.  You can make<br/>
higher fiber bread.  You an add fiber to muffins, cake, cookies. <br/>
<br/>
***But I&#39;m watching his involuntary<br/>
behaviors such as hand flapping, hand smelling, pacing, twisting &<br/>
pulling hair, and insomnia gradually become more of a problem for<br/>
him. ***<br/>
<br/>
So you believe the diet is a factor here as well?  Not just with the<br/>
constipation?  <br/>
<br/>
What do you do when he flaps?  Have you had the same approach as with the<br/>
food?  Have you never said, &quot;Flap at home or in the car but when you&#39;re<br/>
in the store DONT because you&#39;re bothering people?&quot;     Who is offended<br/>
by his had smelling, or do you mean he&#39;s smelling other people&#39;s hands?  <br/>
Have you just said &quot;Stop that.&quot;     If he was poking someone with a stick<br/>
would you not say, STOP THAT?  <br/>
<br/>
So, maybe you&#39;ve said stop that and he can&#39;t stop because he can&#39;t help<br/>
himself, then don&#39;t take him places where his hand flapping is going to<br/>
be a problem and just be honest with him about it.   Go somewhere else<br/>
where people can flap if they want to.  Hell, bring him to my house,<br/>
we&#39;re all hand flappers.  Go dancing.    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a big issue with pacing.  Lots of people pace.  I pace.   But<br/>
if it&#39;s a body motion thing then maybe set up a swing for him or a<br/>
trampoline or a bungee jump so he can fulfill his body&#39;s requirements for<br/>
motion in a way that won&#39;t disturb others. <br/>
<br/>
Insomnia is a very common thing in young boys especially boys approaching<br/>
puberty.  I wouldn&#39;t be so fast to call that a symptom of a wider<br/>
problem.  Lot&#39;s of people have insomnia without it being a big deal.  <br/>
Insomnia is pretty prevalent in my family and no one&#39;s life has been<br/>
ruined over it.   <br/>
<br/>
***If changing his diet might help those things, why wouldn&#39;t I<br/>
want to try it?*** <br/>
<br/>
If you want to then do it.  You don&#39;t have to justify it in an<br/>
unschooling way.   If you want unschooling answers then be willing to<br/>
calm down and consider them.   Unschooling will require you to trust your<br/>
kid and if you can&#39;t (for whatever reason, health reasons, anything) then<br/>
you can&#39;t.  You don&#39;t owe us an explanation.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of what you&#39;re talking about is fear.  Fear of what will happen<br/>
when he goes off the meds.  Fear of what will happen if you don&#39;t impose<br/>
some new diet.  So from the start we&#39;re not talking about reality but<br/>
about your fear of what might happen if you don&#39;t do this new diet.   But<br/>
death or this new diet are not the only choices and it seems like you&#39;re<br/>
not remembering that. <br/>
<br/>
***Obviously life as it is now isn&#39;t working out well<br/>
for him. So what would you propose I do? Seriously?***<br/>
<br/>
I would have proposed a lot of conversation and modeling of food choices<br/>
these last five years, but we&#39;re going forward now and not backward.  So<br/>
I would start now to talk about why he gets constipated and why you feel<br/>
he shouldn&#39;t be on that medication anymore and ask HIM what he&#39;d like to<br/>
do to address those two concerns.   I&#39;d start now making higher fiber<br/>
food choices myself and offering plenty of higher fiber snacks and<br/>
goodies and dinner choices and experimenting with his favorite cookie<br/>
recipes.  <br/>
<br/>
Seriously I&#39;d try six million things before I&#39;d force him to change his<br/>
diet.   Ren said if she had a diabetic child she wouldn&#39;t leave the M&M<br/>
bowl out.   My niece was diagnosed with diabetes when she was eleven and<br/>
she&#39;s twenty one now.  She&#39;s completely insulin dependant.  She eats<br/>
M&M&#39;s and in fact her doctor told her parents NOT to restrict her diet,<br/>
but to give her good information and free choice and to encourage her to<br/>
manage her insulin to meet her body&#39;s needs no matter what she was<br/>
eating.   People dying from lung cancer sometimes don&#39;t quit smoking. <br/>
People critically ill with heart disease sometimes don&#39;t quit eating<br/>
bacon.   If these people find a change so hard to make they&#39;re risking<br/>
death what makes you believe you can force a change on your child without<br/>
it having wider complications, itself?  <br/>
<br/>
Have you talked with him?  Start from the idea he wants to be healthy and<br/>
then give him good information about what can help him feel good.  <br/>
He will make some bad choices I&#39;m sure.  We all do.  He will make better<br/>
choices when he knows better.  All along he can get help from you. <br/>
<br/>
You seem to see this as all or nothing.   Either he stays on this<br/>
medication or he goes off.   But can he try a different kind?  Can he use<br/>
an over the counter stool softener?   Can he take a magnesium supplement<br/>
or chew some vitamin C?  <br/>
<br/>
Is he willing to try your diet or would he be willing to drink a smoothie<br/>
in the morning?    There are a lot of choices but they all start with you<br/>
providing him good information and a good example. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you Ren!  Your interpretation of my situation is exactly what <br/>
I meant!  I too think it&#39;s important to understand why my son has <br/>
the constipation issues in the first place.  I&#39;m floored that the <br/>
doctors don&#39;t seem to care that he can&#39;t pass a BM without the aid <br/>
of a laxative.  I&#39;m sure there must be something more to it than <br/>
just waiting for him to outgrow the problem which is the only thing <br/>
I get from the doctors.  Because of Jeffrey&#39;s nature (Aspergers, <br/>
Sensory Integration), finding foods that he finds acceptable is <br/>
really challenging.  I was hoping to get suggestions from the list <br/>
on how to make some changes while still respecting his choices.  For <br/>
example, I&#39;ve read that apples and bananas are to be avoided as they <br/>
cause constipation.  Yet I&#39;ve also read that apples and bananas are <br/>
good fiber foods and should be eaten to prevent constipation.  It&#39;s <br/>
these kinds of inconsistencies that make me want to cry.  My son has <br/>
such a self-limited diet and I respect his rights to choose his <br/>
foods.  However, I&#39;m reading that the foods he eats are supposedly <br/>
known for their addictive qualities and can cause the types of <br/>
problems that my son suffers from.  It&#39;s all so confusing to me.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let&#39;s get to specifics and start with one thing at a time.  <br/>
Beverages.  My son likes 2% milk both plain or with Nestles <br/>
chocolate, Tab, Coke and orange juice.  He says water makes him gag <br/>
if he drinks too much of it.  A typical amount of Coke for him is 4 -<br/>
 5 cans per day.  I&#39;d also estimate that he drinks 36 - 48 oz. of <br/>
milk per day.  How can I help him switch to drinks that might be <br/>
better, such as more orange juice and less soda or milk?  He is <br/>
extremely upset at the idea of having to give up milk which I <br/>
suggested because of the constipation.  So I bought Lactaid Milk, <br/>
wondering if that would help any since it&#39;s easier to digest than <br/>
regular milk.  He really likes the taste of it, which is good, but <br/>
it&#39;s still considered milk so I&#39;m not sure if it makes any <br/>
difference in switching to it.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, when I asked our former pediatrician about Jeffrey&#39;s milk <br/>
consumption possibly being linked to his constipation, the doctor <br/>
seemed totally unconcerned.  He said the Miralax would make it <br/>
better and to just serve it in his milk.  Our new pediatrician seems <br/>
a bit more knowledgeable.  We&#39;ve only seen him once but we have <br/>
another appt. in July.  I&#39;m going to ask him about this and see if I <br/>
can&#39;t get some answers instead of just a band-aid for the situation.<br/>

<br/>
11 is a very different age than 3 or 5 or even 8. A small child with<br/>
some kind of life threatening illness should not have something<br/>
dangerous left within their reach. I don&#39;t believe  unschooling means<br/>
abdicating parental responsibilty to keep our children safe.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, &quot;safe&quot; often means parental fears getting in the way of<br/>
logic. LIFE isn&#39;t safe. We&#39;re all going to die. At the same time, it&#39;s<br/>
our instinct to survive and protect our young...so we do that to the<br/>
best of our ability.<br/>
<br/>
You can get M&M&#39;s and other candies that won&#39;t mess up your health as<br/>
much if you ARE diabetic. I know people that maintain very good <br/>
health because they ARE strict with their diet. Finding ways to meet<br/>
the desires of a child with health issues is more important to me than<br/>
simply leaving every available option within reach.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the key....honoring and meeting the desires of the individual.<br/>
It&#39;s our job to be creative enough to do that.<br/>
