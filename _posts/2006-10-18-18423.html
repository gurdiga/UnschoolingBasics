<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194600951">I hoping someone has suggestions/ advice . For anyone new...my 7 year old chooses to go to school and is in first grade this year. She knows she can quit anytime but so far has no desire to do so. <br/>
   <br/>
  Recently she became interested in the gifted and talented program and got nominated for it. Then a few days later she came home and said &quot;I dont want to go to a different class and I dont want to have to do harder work because it will make me Arrrrrr! &quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  So I asked her if she knew just exactly what she would be doing in the GT program and she said no. I suggested she might want to ask her teacher and get more information but if she is already sure she dosent want to thats fine. <br/>
   <br/>
  We went outside to play and all was well untill dad and grandma find out she dosent want to go ......sigh. Then she starts hearing all sorts of persuasion ...youre so smart, you should give it a try, you need to challenge yourself on a daily basis, blah blah blah. <br/>
   <br/>
  I expected it from grandma but ouch! it seems like dad is buying into school to much these days. Any suggestions on things to say , etc to get him to lay off and not push this issue ?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870955952">My daughter was momentarily interested in the GT program in fourth grade (first year its available to students)  but decided not to participate, despite the fact that many of her friends were doing it and many of her friend&#39;s parents were pushing it. I asked her why she didnt want to participate and she said: &quot;I think those classes should be for EVERYBODY, not just the kids the teachers think are smart and the one whose parents are on the PTA.&quot; <br/>
Maybe your daughter has similar thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Heh funny you mention this. This is one of the things dh and I ended up discussing last night. He was talking about oh I loved it in Gt. We got to get out the telescopes and microscopes and go out and look at the eclipse......etc. My opinion...So if a test says you arent gt then you shouldnt be looking at microscopes? If a kid wants to work with a microscope then buy, borrow, find one in a childrens museum....or at the very least look at pics of prepared slides online, how microscopes work, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think Courtney&#39;s feeling are somewhat similiar to that. I think that she dosent want to be Required to do more/ harder work. She knows if there is something that interests her Ill do all I can to help her gain the info she wants. Im just fine with this :) <br/>
