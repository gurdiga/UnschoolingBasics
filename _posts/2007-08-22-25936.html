<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062123168">Hi -<br/>
<br/>
We were visited yesterday by a homing pigeon!  She (or he?) showed up  <br/>
on our windowsill and was just hanging out.  Since it was 100 degrees  <br/>
yesterday, I thought I&#39;d take it some water, even if that scared it  <br/>
away.  It didn&#39;t scare!  As I poured the water into the dish, the  <br/>
bird hopped right up to it - very close to me - and had a drink.   <br/>
That&#39;s when I saw the bands on its legs.  I googled &quot;I found a  <br/>
pigeon&quot; and through various sites, I learned that the bird was  <br/>
probably tired, and if I could, we should keep it comfy for a day or  <br/>
two, then release it.  We settled the bird into a kitty carrier, and  <br/>
she spent the night.  I found the originating club that released the  <br/>
pigeon - but the person who can look up the owner of the bird is on  <br/>
vacation &#39;til September 5th!  I&#39;m really not sure what to do, now.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like it&#39;s too hot to release the bird.  I was writing to see  <br/>
if someone on the list kept homing pigeons, and what you might  <br/>
suggest I do.  I have a dog and three cats, so the bird is tucked  <br/>
away in my room with the door closed - if they&#39;re social birds, it  <br/>
seems like that would be stressful for it.  It is eating the seed I  <br/>
put in.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860711073">Hi Caren,<br/>
<br/>
I do not keep homing pigeons but we had the exact same experience <br/>
last summer!  We live near Seattle and our bird visitor was from <br/>
Canada.  It had been a really hot week and this little guy was just <br/>
exhausted.  We kept him for over a week in a large dog crate outside <br/>
and kept him fed,watered and safe from other animals. <br/>
<br/>
 When I finally contacted the owner, she said that if I could get him <br/>
as close to his home as possible, I could just release him and he&#39;d <br/>
come home.  She asked me not to release him from my home since he had <br/>
been staying there awhile and was being fed so he might not want to <br/>
leave.  We ended up driving the bird near the border and released <br/>
him.  <br/>
<br/>
How far away is his home from you?  From our experience and talking <br/>
with the owner, I think if you just continue keeping it safe, fed and <br/>
watered for a few days it should be able to continue on home.  The <br/>
owner also asked us to release him either in the early morning or <br/>
evening to keep him from flying during the heat of the day.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233314636">Wow, Caren! We had that happen too, just a few months ago, lol! But it flew  <br/>
off after it rested a bit, or we would have attempted the same. How neat! <br/>

Let it get hydrated, eat some food and let it go. It will find it&#39;s<br/>
way home! It will be ok.<br/>
