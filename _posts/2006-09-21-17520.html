<div id="ygrps-yiv-859054216">Ren!  I think you should pursue that!  What creative ways are there to <br/>
start saying &quot;yes&quot; to yourself?  Are there some prerequisites you can <br/>
take at your local community college?  Online courses you can take?  <br/>
Portfolio requirements you can start to assemble?  Savings you can <br/>
start?  Start working on it now--when I started flamenco it was just one <br/>
hour per week and although i reeeeeallly wanted to do more I still had a <br/>
small toddler and not enough money for more.  Slowly I got to do more <br/>
and more as the opportunities arose, and while I still don&#39;t do it as <br/>
often as I&#39;d like, I am still slowly learning more and more.  Start <br/>
now!  I can so totally see you at RISD someday.<br/>
