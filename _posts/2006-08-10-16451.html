 </span></blockquote>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this magazine...no curriculum ads, many personal <br/>
stories by unschoolers about how unschooling works in thier families, <br/>
and has a resource column about neat books, websites, as well as <br/>
families sharing something special their family does...this last issue <br/>
was geocaching.  I would highly recommend it!   Another good mag is <br/>
Life Learning Magazine.<br/>

job. Well worth subscribing to, imo.<br/>
<br/>
I also love _Life Learning_ and have written for that magazine as well.<br/>
<br/>
Several of us here are also writing for the new ezine *Connections: <br/>
ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting* at <br/>

<br/>
I adore all three. I&#39;ve not written anything for Life Learning<br/>
yet...but maybe I&#39;ll do that sometime.  I think Shayna does a great<br/>
job with LFLF and she&#39;s also a very nice person (online anyway, I&#39;ve<br/>
never met her irl).<br/>
<br/>
Danielle is doing an amazing job with &quot;Connections&quot;, I&#39;ve been very<br/>
impressed! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great! I&#39;ll check them all out. Dh doesn&#39;t have very many at home<br/>
hours during the week, so he&#39;s always walking around the house with a<br/>
magazine instead of a book. I thought subscribing might be a good way<br/>
to get him more informed about the practices of unschooling than<br/>
handing him a book. I&#39;ll read them too, of coarse, but i get plenty of<br/>
book time as well. I would really like to get Rue Kream&#39;s book soon,<br/>
which i&#39;ve heard everyone speak so highly about. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Nicole. It&#39;s not my real name though. Just a self choosen one.<br/>
Dh and i actually wanted to name our daughter Lilith Rain, but so far<br/>
i have three boys and no little girl, so i&#39;ve kind of adopted it for<br/>
myself over time. I do feel a strong attachment to the archetype.<br/>
