Well...how do you explain kids without arbitrary limits on video games<br/>
and food that aren&#39;t unhealthy at all, and are perfectly happy to do<br/>
other activities and eat overall balanced diets??<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a myth that children will only play video games if you don&#39;t<br/>
limit them or eat only cookies if you don&#39;t force them to eat<br/>
otherwise!! Total myth.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen and Sierra picked some &quot;Yo-Go&#39;s&quot; when grocery shopping last<br/>
night. They&#39;d eaten most of them by the time we got home and were<br/>
groaning that they were both SICK of sugar and wanted some &quot;real&quot; food.<br/>
<br/>
While I was fixing a proper meal, Sierra commented &quot;It&#39;s funny &#39;cuz<br/>
most parents won&#39;t let their kids eat much sugar so they want it all<br/>
the time, but we want healthy food because you let us eat what we want&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Smart kid.<br/>
Her body lets her know when she&#39;s had enough sugar. They can&#39;t learn<br/>
what that feels like if someone constantly imposes their own limits on<br/>
the child.<br/>

I totally agree that this is a myth, but sometimes I choose for my <br/>

I still feel worried because it seems like he&#39;ll only eat a few <br/>
things or he seems picky, but I really think that his body craves <br/>
what it needs and with good food around he&#39;ll eat it. The other night <br/>
I had all these ideas of what he should eat for dinner; we were all <br/>
in the market buying stuff and I had ideas of &quot;protein, carb and <br/>
veggies&quot;--what&#39;re you gonna eat tonight? he chose a (yummy) 1/2 a <br/>
watermelon and ate that for dinner. the whole thing, didn&#39;t want <br/>
anything else. And what am I going to do, make him eat &quot;protein, <br/>
carbs and veggies&quot;? No! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally see that. My kids who have not had limits on their food <br/>
choose great food. They love salads, protien, they eat their vegies.  <br/>
Not that they never eat candy  and snacks, but done much like you <br/>
described Ren, with awaremess.<br/>
<br/>
My one son who has been with us for a year had huge food limitations <br/>
in a foster home. He is like a man gone wild. We often discuss how <br/>
some foods might make him feel and what reaction his body will have to <br/>
overindulging past the point of comfort. <br/>
<br/>
I am hoping he will learn to make the connections. My experience <br/>
personally and from my children is those outside limits are setting us <br/>
up to be out of control instead of helping us selfmodulate and learn <br/>
what works for each of our bodies.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I agree 100% and my children are also living proof! :-) My <br/>
three spent 4 years in foster care before coming home to us. They <br/>
all did it in their own time (my daughters quicker than my son) but <br/>
they all choose their own foods and how much they want. <br/>
<br/>
Some real life examples instead of the &quot;extreme&quot; ones posted by <br/>
someone earlier:<br/>
1) My youngest still has some Valentine candy left, not to mention <br/>
almost all of her Easter candy. It&#39;s in a bag, in the cabinet and <br/>
she can reach it with no problem. She can eat it all in one day if <br/>
she wanted to...but she chooses not to because she knows (like I do) <br/>
that eating to much of it makes her feel sick. <br/>
2) My son (who has the hardest time listening to his body), said &quot;no <br/>
thank you&quot; to my mothers offer of candy in the store. He told her <br/>
that he had candy at home.   <br/>
<br/>
This happened slowly, not overnight. Food was the first and easiest <br/>
issue for me to loosen control because my middle daughter came to us <br/>
with an eating disorder and I was determined to help her with it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557766873">Yesterday was my older daughter&#39;s 3rd birthday. We had all kinds of <br/>
party food that we don&#39;t normally have in the house: potato chips, <br/>
cake, brownies, etc. Not because these things aren&#39;t allowed, just <br/>
because none of us particularly likes them as everyday foods. When my <br/>
dd wants chips, I get her her own small bag of chips. When she wants <br/>
cookies I make her cookies or we buy some. But it&#39;s totally up to her <br/>
to ask for these things when the mood strikes.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been &quot;unfooding&quot; myself, letting myself eat whatever I want <br/>
whenever I want to remove the power of the forbidden foods from my <br/>
childhood. I started out eating lots of cookies for breakfast with my <br/>
coffee, but the pendulum has swung back to the middle over time, and I <br/>
have been eating a healthy varied diet and very content with it.<br/>
<br/>
I told myself it was a special occasion and I could eat as much of all <br/>
of these &quot;naughty&quot; foods as I wanted to. But it backfired because the <br/>
sweets were too sweet and the chips were too salty. So somewhere along <br/>
the line (since being denied all sugar as a child and then bingeing on <br/>
these sorts of foods as a teen) I&#39;ve lost my taste for extremely fatty <br/>
and sugary foods.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters, having been given free reign all their lives with food <br/>
were excited about the cake and such, but didn&#39;t actually eat any of <br/>
it. I made a delightfully disgusting concoction for the kids with <br/>
brownies oreos and gummy worms all mashed up and served with a trowel <br/>
in a flower pot. My dd took a few bites (maybe only one) and walked <br/>
away to go play. My husband and I looked at each other over the picnic <br/>
table and I asked, &quot;Would you have ever walked away from a bowl of <br/>
something like that as a kid?&quot; His answer, &quot;Never in a million years.&quot; <br/>
And we&#39;ve both struggled with our weight and are still figuring it out. <br/>
Food isn&#39;t just food for us, it&#39;s caught up in a complex tangle of <br/>
emotions.<br/>
<br/>
We wanted something better for our daughters, and for us radical <br/>
unschooling is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the whole story, but it&#39;s as much as I have time for at the <br/>
moment. I mostly lurk here, but because that just happened yesterday it <br/>
was fresh in my mind.<br/>

sad, happy, glad, depressed, joyful, bored, lazy, busy, etc.  There wasn&#39;t<br/>
an ocassion that we couldn&#39;t find a reason to eat.  Funerals meant huge<br/>
free-for-all smorgasborgs.  Yet the other message I had (that went along<br/>

your &quot;complex tangle of emotions&quot; and it is something I don&#39;t want to pass<br/>

Man, do I know this!  The thing I&#39;ve begun to learn is to let myself feel<br/>
the feelings and have it be ok to feel... instead of covering up the hurt<br/>
and pain with food.  Food has become way too big of an issue in my life and<br/>
I need to remove the obsession associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a journey of self-discovery and learning to love self and treat<br/>
myself with care and acceptance... very much like we are doing with our<br/>
lovelies... we need to be sure to give ourselves the freedom too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So for 4 years your children did NOTHING but watch TV or play video games? Really? This is a pretty broad statement. They didn&#39;t ever go out to play, go over a friend&#39;s house, swim, bike, jump on the bed, read comics, go to the store, shoot water pistols...? Nothing? <br/>
<br/>
Did they ever talk about what they were watching? Did you watch with them or bring home magazines about their favorite shows or actors? Did you show them websites that connected with their favorite shows or find a movie with the same actor to compare? How about a book with their favorite characters in it? Did you watch DVD&#39;s of their favorite shows with them so you could all check out the extra features?<br/>
<br/>
Did you play their video games with them? Did you try getting them a subscription to electronic Gaming Monthly or another gaming magazine? How about websites with cheat codes? Do they know about those? Didn&#39;t they want to go look that stuff up? Did you help them? Have you asked them about the game characters, strategies, layouts and levels? Do you make yourself available and connected with their passions?<br/>
<br/>
Are you really saying that your kids did NOTHING but watch TV and play video games for 4 years while you actively supported and joined them in a radical unschooling fashion, offering them opportunities for exploration and connections? Or are you saying they preferred to play and watch as opposed to what might have considered more educational choices?<br/>

themselves that way...<br/>

Breezy,<br/>
<br/>
Have you really allowed your children total freedom in these areas for 4 <br/>
years?  Are you sure you haven&#39;t subliminally set limits or imposed judgment on <br/>
them for what they choose to do with their time?  I am reading your words and I <br/>
hear judgment and belittling.  May I suggest you make yourself a list of what <br/>
areas you are worried about, plan to &quot;monitor&quot; those areas, then sit back and <br/>
truly set them free for a month and rate exactly how much or little time they <br/>
spend doing things that you feel are wasting their time.  Mark you calendar <br/>
today and promise not to judge, complain, raise your eyebrows, or expect <br/>
anything from them other than what they naturally choose to do for the next month.  <br/>
Hit your personal rewind button if you fail to catch yourself suggesting they <br/>
do something other than what they choose.  I think you will find that there is <br/>
more balance in their lives than you realize.  Also, ask yourself what you are <br/>
really worried about if nothing changes on their part.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning that a lot of this unschooling thing is just about changing my <br/>
responses and myself.  My kids are doing the same things they&#39;ve always been <br/>
doing, playing and enjoying themselves, I&#39;m just becoming more and more okay <br/>
with how they choose to live their lives, gradually letting more of my agenda go. <br/>
 It&#39;s hard, but fantastic!  <br/>
<br/>
Trust your children.  I think you will be surprised at how they respond.  <br/>

is &quot;assisting&quot; them towards being what we think they should be.<br/>
<br/>
So what were you doing to assist them during those 4 years?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of other opportunities did you have running through their  <br/>
lives?<br/>
<br/>
Did you have nutritious food that was as easy to grab as snacky food?  <br/>
Did you bring food to them when they were watching TV and playing?  <br/>
Did you involve them in shopping and cooking? Did you help them make  <br/>
things they wanted to make?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of places did you take them to? Did you take them places  <br/>
they wanted to go or places you thought would be good for them? Did  <br/>
you only offer other opportunities after you were fed up with how  <br/>
much TV and video gaming they were doing or did you offer because  <br/>
they are fun opportunities? It&#39;s helpful to plan out things for  <br/>
tomorrow or the week ahead of time so the kids know what&#39;s coming up  <br/>
rather than waiting until they&#39;re involved in something to try to  <br/>

<br/>
Why did you wait?  What were you doing those four years?  <br/>
<br/>
If parents are going to unschool they need to be active.  They need to<br/>
see the world as an interesting place and they need to be interested in<br/>
helping their kids enjoy that world.   Some parents can&#39;t unschool but<br/>
that&#39;s not the same as unschooling not working for a child. <br/>
<br/>
I think some people see only limited choices.  Either I let my kids watch<br/>
TV all the time or I make them do something else.  Unschooling isn&#39;t like<br/>
that.  It takes more time and commitment on the parents part than<br/>
&quot;letting&quot; or &quot;making.&quot;   It means the world has to be made available to<br/>
kids.  They have to have lots of good choices, not just mom&#39;s idea of<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; things to do, but interesting places to go, people to<br/>
visit, choices about what to do.  They have to have at least one parent<br/>
modeling an interest in life and activity out in the big, wide world.  <br/>

[Marie Pressman]<br/>
This statement is huge for me because I find myself not being active and as<br/>
present as I should be.  If my kids don&#39;t latch onto something I offer, I<br/>
let them go off and do their thing then I become involved in some household<br/>
task and it spirals downward from there.   Often I just get exhausted by<br/>
their energy and my mind goes somewhere else.  I&#39;ve got to turn this around.<br/>
&quot;Modeling an interest in life.&quot;   Wow!  I never thought about setting an<br/>
example that way.  Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether it is just being lazy or just not my natural<br/>
inclination to be &quot;interested&quot;.....or just KNOWING what it is I&#39;m interested<br/>
in!  However, what I&#39;m interested in, might not be of interest to my kids<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally believe in a balance.  My relationship with my DH is <br/>
the same.  There are things we like to do together, but we each have <br/>
our own interests as well.  That&#39;s only natural.  I&#39;ve also found <br/>
that my interests sometimes sparks something within my children, and <br/>
vice versa.  I&#39;m living my life WITH my children so they see me <br/>
doing things I enjoy.  But in order to be active in their lives I <br/>
sometimes have to put something I want to do on hold to do something <br/>
with them.  They actually do the same thing for me.  For example, <br/>
sometimes they see me playing Nintendo and they choose to stop what <br/>
they&#39;re doing to watch and help me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, of all the books on unschooling that have been recommended,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This may vary as we probably all have our favorite books, but I&#39;d <br/>
recommend starting with Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child: An <br/>
Unschooled Life.  The first time I read it, I agreed with some of <br/>
the stuff but sort of skimmed over other stuff.  As soon as I <br/>
finished the book though, I went right back to the beginning and <br/>
started it again, taking time to read it cover to cover and <br/>
discussing many of the comments with my DH.  We both learned so <br/>
much!!  My other long-time favorite is Alison McKee&#39;s Homeschooling <br/>
Our Children Unschooling Ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason I like both of those books is because they really come at <br/>
it from the parents questioning.  Too many people think that <br/>
unschooling has to do with just not using formal curriculum with <br/>
children, but I&#39;ve been learning that there&#39;s so much more to <br/>
unschooling.  It affects every aspect of our life, especially the <br/>
way we parent our children.  I&#39;ve become a much more patient mother, <br/>
and usually the one with a calm reasoning attitude in nearly <br/>
everything we do.  That&#39;s so out of character for me, but that&#39;s how <br/>
much unschooling has affected my life.  I like to think that my <br/>
children are happier and better off because I&#39;m focusing on <br/>
unschooling my DH and myself.  I don&#39;t need to un-school the kids, <br/>
but us, and the rest just seems to fall into place!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it is your nature to appreciate a quiet life of contemplation. <br/>
That&#39;s cool.  <br/>
Maybe, like most of us, you grew up with rules of &quot;finishing what you<br/>
start&quot; so that it became easier not to start something than to maybe get<br/>
stuck in some activity that turned out to be a joyless, soul-sucking<br/>
bummer. <br/>
<br/>
***However, what I&#39;m interested in, might not be of interest to my kids<br/>
and vice versa.  So it is it finding balance between the two that I<br/>
should<br/>
strive for, or just devote my self to helping them be interested in their<br/>
interests?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, devote yourself to helping them do the things that interest them. <br/>
Our kids will only be with us a short time.  We don&#39;t have all the time<br/>
in the world to become interested parents.  If we wait a year to be<br/>
involved with our twelve year old we&#39;ll have missed it.  He won&#39;t be<br/>
twelve next year and we&#39;ll never get that chance again.   If  we put our<br/>
interests ahead of our kids we&#39;ll run out of time with our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean never pursuing our own interests.  It doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to be one or the other.  It just means while we&#39;re parents of kids at<br/>
home they should be our focus because the other things we want to do can<br/>
be done lightly, without total immersion, without irretrievable loss or<br/>
can wait.  Our kids can&#39;t.   <br/>
<br/>
So yes, unschooling parents do have to show an interest in their kids.  <br/>
Even if what the kids are doing doesn&#39;t particularly interest us, it&#39;s<br/>
vital to be interested in their joy!   We really should be devoted to<br/>
that!   But part of how our kids will find and live their own interests<br/>
comes from our example.  So when we find something interesting, we can<br/>
share that with them.  When we have a passion we can pursue it.  If you<br/>
love Tibet then by all means read about it and watch movies and buy<br/>
Tibetan wool and make traditional Tibetan rugs and whatever blows your<br/>
skirt up, but save the year long isolation in the Tibetan monastery until<br/>
your kids are happily occupied in their adult lives. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
So it won&#39;t look like balance; like your kids on one side with their<br/>
passions and interests and you other side with your passions and<br/>
interests.  It will look more like unschooling, with all of you on the<br/>
same side standing in the big wide world and you holding the keys to the<br/>
car. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
***Also, of all the books on unschooling that have been recommended,<br/>

If you were waiting for them to do something else, they probably *felt* <br/>
that. So they were trying to get it all in until you decided to change <br/>
you mind and start limiting.<br/>
<br/>
It has everything to do with *our* mindset. If we are simply biding our <br/>
time until they &quot;come over to our side&quot;---that&#39;s not the same thing as <br/>
seeing the true value in what they&#39;re doing. If you were *waiting* <br/>
instead of enjoying, then you were the problem, not them.<br/>

I gave up on the food thing long<br/>
ago, since my daughter was always sick, weak, tired and pale, and my <br/>
son<br/>
became obese.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This blows my mind. A parent watches her child become sick, weak, <br/>
tired, and pale? Obese?<br/>
<br/>
What were you feeding them?<br/>

I believe they do too. But  parent who will neglect her children to the <br/>
point you described above isn&#39;t unschooling. That&#39;s neglect.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s a myth FOR SOME PEOPLE, but not for us...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then maybe this isn&#39;t the path for you. You wouldn&#39;t be the first <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Kelly, this is so TRUE!  I find on days that I am deep into my own<br/>
passions that my children tend to delve into their own passions as well.  I<br/>
can be sitting quietly knitting and look up to see one of them working on a<br/>
puzzle or constructing something with legos or mastering a new DDR<br/>
routine/dance/whatever you call it.  Recently I was busy making some cards<br/>
for my stamping class I go to and one of the kids said, &quot;Want to do<br/>
something with paper, too.&quot;  I told them that there was tons of paper on the<br/>
art shelves and in the paper box.  Next thing I know I had paper cranes<br/>
flying from the kitchen door frame!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone has an art shelf in their homes.  We love our art shelf.<br/>
It&#39;s filled with paper, crayons, pens, markers, glue, stickers, paints,<br/>
brushes, clay, books modelling stuff, whatever we find to add to it.  It&#39;s<br/>
free and open to be played with at any time.  I&#39;ve asked the kids just to<br/>
try to keep the area that they create in tidy and have made no limitations<br/>
on their creativity other than that.  We have had an art gallery down the<br/>
hall and designer love letters (as well as the aforementioned paper crane<br/>
display).  One morning I got up and Keon was painting paper plates.  He&#39;d<br/>
carefully laid out newspaper from the recycling bin on the table and was<br/>
happily creating - before breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to put up butcher paper down the hallway.  We have two very long<br/>
hallways and I&#39;ve thought about putting up long stretches of multiple panels<br/>
of white butcher paper down both the common hallway and down the &quot;girl&#39;s<br/>
dormitory&quot; hallway.  Set a bunch of markers or crayons in a box and see what<br/>
happens.<br/>

A parent that stands by, watching their child do something they<br/>

Yikes.<br/>
Why would you WAIT for your child to do something else?<br/>
If you have several children that do NOTHING but tv and video games<br/>
for FOUR years, you are NOT offering them anything more interesting.<br/>

alive.&quot;<br/>
