<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943271879">Harriet Lerner tells a story in her book &quot;The Mother Dance&quot; about being at a <br/>
family party and noticing that nearly all the children were sneaking as much <br/>
as they could from the sweets table when they thought their parents weren&#39;t <br/>
looking. But not her son. He was over by the fruit bowl, surreptitiously stuffing <br/>
grapes into his mouth and into his pockets.<br/>
<br/>
At home he was allowed to eat all the candy he wanted, but his parents had <br/>
been boycotting grapes since before he was born.<br/>
