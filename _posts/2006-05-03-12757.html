<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014842087">&quot; Should I say that stuff<br/>
sucks and is worthless or do I shut up and just do like I did<br/>
yesterday a.m.? My concern is that she may believe that I just don&#39;t<br/>
care, but I do care.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say a bunch of negative stuff about it, because it still<br/>
matters to her. That&#39;s ok right now. As you keep pursuing interests,<br/>
seeing the learning in EVERYTHING, she&#39;ll care less and less about it.<br/>
<br/>
I might point out that she&#39;s learning really cool stuff without it,<br/>
but that&#39;s about as far as I&#39;d go. Some kids just like that stuff and<br/>
I think you&#39;re far enough into trust that she&#39;s not getting the<br/>
message from you that it&#39;s more important than other kinds of learning.<br/>
<br/>
I took Sierra and Jalen to the store with me last night because he<br/>
NEEDED a notebook and pen (nothing around here was &quot;right&quot;) and she<br/>
picked out a math workbook.  We looked at several K-1 math workbooks<br/>
(she said &quot;I want an easy one&quot;) that had money/fraction or story<br/>
problem type stuff. She didn&#39;t like that. I kept thinking how stupid<br/>
it was to give kids story problems and fake money on paper when you<br/>
could just let them figure it out in real life much better!!<br/>
She chose a basic addition/subtraction book. Bought it with her own<br/>
money too (probably got more math out of the transaction than she will<br/>
out of the book, but ok).<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea when or if she will pull it out. It might sit and<br/>
gather dust like other workbooks we have. But it meant something to<br/>
her last night, so we have another K-1 workbook. It&#39;s all good if the<br/>
parent is trusting the learning process and not making schooly stuff<br/>
the end-all-be-all in lieu of real life experiences.<br/>
