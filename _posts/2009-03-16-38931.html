<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955596087">No <br/>
unschooling conferences in the Midwest. We just had an unschooling gathering in MN.<br/>
We are going to do it again next year and it will likely develop into a small conference.<br/>
Here is a list of unschooling events in the US<br/>

Hi, I&#39;m new to unschooling and I&#39;m very interested in going to a conference. So far, I&#39;ve only seen info about conferences on each coast, which aren&#39;t feasible for me to attend. Does anybody know of any in the midwest this year?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995324804">There&#39;s the Unschoolers Winter Water Park Gathering in Sandusky, OH - this<br/>
year&#39;s has passed already.  There are talks and roundtables and funshops and<br/>
all kids of other things going on there, with unschoolers from all over.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the date&#39;s for the 2010 UWWG, but the website will probably<br/>
have it when the date&#39;s announced:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ugoevent.com/">http://ugoevent.com/</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think there is a non-con (casual gathering, not a &#39;conference&#39;) somewhere in Ohio but I think that&#39;s already passed. There&#39;s also Rethinking Education in Texas (not exactly midwest but maybe closer than the coasts?).<br/>
