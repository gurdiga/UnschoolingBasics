<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095976518">***But based on title alone,  I agree. ***<br/>
<br/>
When unschoolers talk about &quot;no&quot; they&#39;re talking about arbitrary negative <br/>
responses to kid requests.   Children are showered in negativity from their <br/>
parents and other adults who believe children must be made to understand the <br/>
world is tough, life is hard and you can&#39;t have everything you want.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve had generation after generation of children raised that way and <br/>
now we have a citizenry of depressed, disordered, unhappy, dysfunctional <br/>
miserable people.<br/>
<br/>
***Kids and adults need to hear no from others and also, maybe more<br/>
importantly, need to know the freedom of being able to say no. And if we<br/>
want the freedom to say it, we need to accept the reality that we&#39;ll hear<br/>
it.***<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;No&quot; so that they can learn about life.   Life will <br/>
present it&#39;s own natural limitations.  Family situations will sometimes <br/>
present natural limitations.   Location can present natural limitations to <br/>
something a kid might want to do.   Kids don&#39;t need arbitrary limitations <br/>
placed on them by people who are thoughtlessly passing down the &quot;who do you <br/>
think you are?&quot; legacy of parenting.<br/>
<br/>
And kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;no&quot; so they can learn to say &quot;no.&quot;   Kid&#39;s need <br/>
to have their choices respected.  It&#39;s that simple.  They need to be free to <br/>
NOT hug Aunt Martha, to NOT wave bye-bye to Mr. Jones, to NOT kiss Grandpa, <br/>
to NOT have to stay at Grandma&#39;s if they don&#39;t want to.  They need to be <br/>
free to listen to their own instincts about people and places and they need <br/>
to be able to say &quot;no&quot; to foods they don&#39;t like, and ideas they don&#39;t agree <br/>
with.  That&#39;s how they will have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot; when they are <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
***This is one of the things I learned in my own unschool life.   My parents<br/>
never said no. I had a very hard time saying no to anyone, and when I<br/>
started trying to assert myself, I used it to harshly. ***<br/>
<br/>
Equating unschooling with neglect is not helpful.   Parents who leave kids <br/>
on their own, to figure things out for themselves and who are not examples <br/>
of thoughtful, honest maturity are not unschooling.   Unschooling parents <br/>
need to be involved with their kids, to be helpful and empowering so that <br/>
long before their kids are out on their own they have the skills they need <br/>
to get along well.   Those skills are developed in a home where parents are <br/>
examples of good decision making and thoughtful consideration of others. <br/>
It&#39;s not about how often a kid hears &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This site is by a bunch of folks whose baseline is schooled kids.  They&#39;re <br/>
starting from a population who&#39;s psychology has already been altered by <br/>
school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076487284">***You are so right! How can you ever learn to assert yourself if your <br/>
parents<br/>
don&#39;t show you how by their example.***<br/>
<br/>
People learn to be confident by being on the receiving end of respect. <br/>
People don&#39;t gain confidence by hearing that what they want or what they <br/>
like or what they wish they could do cannot be done.    People gain <br/>
confidence when they see positive examples of achievement, not denial.<br/>
<br/>
Some people get very assertive when they&#39;ve gone without the things they <br/>
wanted and needed.  Some get so assertive they lie and steal to get what <br/>
they want.<br/>
<br/>
***And no isn&#39;t always negative it is just<br/>
&quot;no.&quot; ***<br/>
<br/>
No, you can&#39;t have that doll.  No you can&#39;t have another cookie.  No you <br/>
can&#39;t play that game.  No, because I said so.   These are the things kids <br/>
hear.  That&#39;s negative.    There is no &quot;just no&quot; to a child.    It all has <br/>
meaning.  &quot;Just no&quot; implies that kids aren&#39;t really hurt by the careless and <br/>
arbitrary diarrhea that flows from the mouths of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
***Saying no, saying yes and saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wish I knew but I don&#39;t<br/>
know&quot; are all ways of saying &quot;I love you.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t even make sense.   Telling a child she can&#39;t have a glass of <br/>
water when she&#39;s thirsty because a mom doesn&#39;t want to change a wet bed <br/>
later is not &quot;I love you.&quot;  It&#39;s,  &quot;I don&#39;t want to be inconvenienced by <br/>
you.&quot;    Telling a kid he can&#39;t have a snack when he&#39;s hungry because mom <br/>
wants him to eat all his dinner is not, &quot;I love you.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;I know better <br/>
than you do how hungry you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I remember back then feeling thankful that my<br/>
mom and dad would have screamed until their voices bled in order to keep me<br/>
out of danger, ***<br/>
<br/>
A parent who lets a child walk up to a venomous snake is neglectful.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t take screaming to keep a child safe.  It takes thought and attention <br/>
and good judgment.<br/>
<br/>
A child who hears &quot;no&quot; a lot is very likely, over time, to stop hearing it <br/>
at all.   It will become so much background noise from mom and dad.  Because <br/>
those parents, those &quot;no&quot; parents, aren&#39;t working for a partnership with <br/>
their child their working for a dictatorship.   But a child who&#39;s parents <br/>
find ways to say &quot;yes,&quot;  to provide what a child wants to the best of their <br/>
ability and who are in partnership with their child will hear and listen  if <br/>
the parents ever do say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop.&quot;<br/>

you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that anyone who unschools would say no  for these reasons. If <br/>
your child wets the bed you would say &quot;if you have  this glass of water right <br/>
now it may make things hard for you later  if you feel like peeing at night&quot; <br/>
and then let the child decide. No kid  WANTS to wet their bed. After they <br/>
understand how the water thing relates  to the wet bed they will figure out on <br/>
their own how to get it  together. But if your child wants to run around the <br/>
pool, play in the  street at night or put mouthfuls of sand from the sandbox in  <br/>
their mouth then no is always a good option with an explanation after  of <br/>
course. I have met my share of overly relaxed parents who don&#39;t  say no to these <br/>
things and suffer terrible consequences both in terms of  safety and anti-social <br/>
behavior later in life. Boundaries, especially put  in place for safety, are <br/>
very loving. I also don&#39;t think a parent should  say yes to things that will <br/>
cause their life to become terrible  just for the sake of their child feeling <br/>
free. For example, I have to work  extremely early on Sunday morning and need <br/>
the house quiet and calm and  everyone asleep fairly early Sat night. Any other <br/>
night and they can stay  up all night long as far as I&#39;m concerned and sleep <br/>
all  afternoon, but if I get unhealthy from not sleeping and worn  down and <br/>
sick, what good am I to my kids? So Sat night I tell them  when they have to be <br/>
in bed and more importantly WHY and because they love  me, they respect it and <br/>
want what is best for the whole family. On rare  occasion there will be some <br/>
resistance because of a great science  show that&#39;s on or a game they don&#39;t <br/>
want to stop playing, but I say no,  albeit gently - if I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
respecting myself and  my health or them!  No does work and does function as a <br/>
loving  thing when done at the right time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51289794">***When unschoolers talk about &quot;no&quot; they&#39;re talking about arbitrary negative<br/>
responses to kid requests.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m was unschooled from age 12 on and have now unschooled my children<br/>
for 15 years. &quot;No.&quot; has a vast number of meanings given the context in which <br/>
it is said.<br/>
But I haven&#39;t read the book, so I&#39;m not aware of how he was using it.<br/>
<br/>
***Children are showered in negativity from their<br/>
parents and other adults who believe children must be made to understand the<br/>
world is tough, life is hard and you can&#39;t have everything you want.***<br/>
<br/>
I know some children are treated that way, but that is a big generalization.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t even close to being treated that way. And I know kids who <br/>
attend public school, private school, and more traditional homeschoolers who <br/>
also don&#39;t live<br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
***But we&#39;ve had generation after generation of children raised that way and<br/>
now we have a citizenry of depressed, disordered, unhappy, dysfunctional<br/>
miserable people.***<br/>
<br/>
Again, IMHO, that is a big generalization, but I think your right that it <br/>
certainly<br/>
contributes to people like the above.<br/>
<br/>
***Kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;No&quot; so that they can learn about life.   Life <br/>
will<br/>
present it&#39;s own natural limitations.  Family situations will sometimes<br/>
present natural limitations.   Location can present natural limitations to<br/>
something a kid might want to do.   Kids don&#39;t need arbitrary limitations<br/>
placed on them by people who are thoughtlessly passing down the &quot;who do you<br/>
think you are?&quot; legacy of parenting.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, natural limitation will often allow for not using the word,&quot;No.&quot;. But <br/>
using the word, &quot;No.&quot; doesn&#39;t always have to be arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
My children have asked me on occasion to just give them an answer. They can <br/>
get exhausted<br/>
by my desire to explore, or have them explore, every option. Sometimes they <br/>
want to just have someone give them an answer and be &quot;lazy&quot; about things. I <br/>
can relate to this and see no harm in it.<br/>
<br/>
***And kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;no&quot; so they can learn to say &quot;no.&quot;   Kid&#39;s <br/>
need<br/>
to have their choices respected.  It&#39;s that simple.***<br/>
<br/>
If they never hear it, I find it hard to believe they will ever learn to say <br/>
it and use it when<br/>
it is exactly what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
***They need to be free to NOT hug Aunt Martha, to NOT wave bye-bye to Mr. <br/>
Jones, to NOT kiss Grandpa,to NOT have to stay at Grandma&#39;s if they don&#39;t <br/>
want to.  They need to be<br/>
free to listen to their own instincts about people and places and they need<br/>
to be able to say &quot;no&quot; to foods they don&#39;t like, and ideas they don&#39;t agree<br/>
with.  That&#39;s how they will have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot; when they are<br/>
older.***<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Martha and the rest of the family may need to hear ,&quot;No.&quot;. Again, if <br/>
children don&#39;t<br/>
learn to hear it used in the appropriate context, they won&#39;t know to use it <br/>
that way.<br/>
Most people are not familiar with the autonomous, unschooled ideas. My <br/>
children<br/>
have learned that most people have to be spoken to in a language they<br/>
understand. And,&quot;No.&quot; is part of it.<br/>
<br/>
***Equating unschooling with neglect is not helpful.   Parents who leave <br/>
kids<br/>
on their own, to figure things out for themselves and who are not examples<br/>
of thoughtful, honest maturity are not unschooling.***<br/>
<br/>
I never even implied that they were neglectful, that comment was in poor <br/>
taste.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t left on my own to figure things out for myself at all times. But <br/>
sometimes<br/>
the natural consequences were the best teacher.<br/>
<br/>
***Unschooling parents need to be involved with their kids, to be helpful <br/>
and empowering so that<br/>
long before their kids are out on their own they have the skills they need<br/>
to get along well.   Those skills are developed in a home where parents are<br/>
examples of good decision making and thoughtful consideration of others.<br/>
It&#39;s not about how often a kid hears &quot;no.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
***This site is by a bunch of folks whose baseline is schooled kids.  <br/>
They&#39;re<br/>
starting from a population who&#39;s psychology has already been altered by<br/>
school.***<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. I&#39;m part of this bunch and I don&#39;t use schooled kids as a <br/>
baseline. And I<br/>
am aware of many others who quietly agree with me.  (No need to out <br/>
yourselves ladies.)<br/>
Schooled kids are a huge number of people with vast variations.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know<br/>
how anyone could call that a baseline. But to each his own.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your using ,&quot;No.&quot; from an arbitrary negative response and <br/>
&quot;schooled&quot; kids<br/>
as your baseline. I am not. So I guess we are addressing this from to <br/>
different views.<br/>
I will consider your thoughts on it and appreciate your opinion. I think we <br/>
all gain from<br/>
sharing our experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Kindest regards,<br/>
