<div id="ygrps-yiv-483961666">I need a bit of insight and support.<br/>
Our family is mostly extrovert, noisy bunch. But what riddles me with<br/>
guilt and frustration is that nearly all the interactions are<br/>
aggressive, loud,argumentative. <br/>
<br/>
I feel a complete absence of kindness, gentleness, even love. I have<br/>
tried to do the right things. Natural births, long term nursing co<br/>
sleeping, no school,etc. Went through a psychologically abusive<br/>
relationship when my first son was a baby and pregnant with second. <br/>
Early in current relationship Dh went through nervous breakdown,<br/>
depression and a short hospital stay from childhood issues, home and<br/>
boarding school.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like gentle parenting does not come naturally. And getting<br/>
angry with DH all these years for his anger issues, even though he has<br/>
worked at it and is definitely miles better, doesn&#39;t help anything. <br/>
<br/>
I am frustrated now that the children bicker, fight and sometimes hit<br/>
each other.But I honestly don&#39;t know what to say anymore. I feel like<br/>
we caused it, and can&#39;t turn back time. I am in tears here,this is<br/>
such a burden of guilt. That I have screwed up the children&#39;s ability<br/>
to be kind and thoughtful with each other by not having that in our <br/>
own married relationship.<br/>
<br/>
 We have been through some extremely stressful situations, including<br/>
my father in law evicting us from the home my husband built and moving<br/>
into a house that should probably have been condemned. We have worked<br/>
for six years to improve it, basics like no insulation, termites,<br/>
serious water damage, and have twice had 7ft floodwater in the<br/>
basement.Dh works full time but we get food stamps and money is too<br/>
tight for five kids and us.      <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else struggle with guilt? What about the idea that your<br/>
children are well formed by what they experience early in life?<br/>
What can I do to turn around the children&#39;s fighting and hurting each<br/>
other?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I am rambling, any support is welcome<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555197140">((Cara)),<br/>
All is well.  Really and Truly.<br/>
You are not screwing up your kids.  Kids fight, bicker and hit.  Even kids<br/>
who come from the most absolute of Zen parents do it.<br/>
I&#39;ve laid the same guilt trip on myself, too, when they are icky to each<br/>
other.  &quot;Oh, it must be because I&#39;m so _______ (fill in the blank with<br/>
self-condemning word of choice).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not.  What you *can* do, is LOOOOOVE the pieces out of them, even when<br/>
they&#39;re being mean to each other.  Hold them, both, if there&#39;s a victim and<br/>
an aggressor, silently.  Just hold them in your arms.  No lecture, no<br/>
dissappointment, no wishing things were something they&#39;re not at that<br/>
moment.  Just love them with your whole heart, especially when you feel like<br/>
you&#39;d rather string them up by their toes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be ok.<br/>
Love *is* all you need...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203063151">Lately me and the girls 4.5 and 3 have been more aggressive. Today I <br/>
said what is happening why are we hurting each other and not talking <br/>
about what we want? They looked at me like -- duhhhhhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
I said ok- no more throwing things and hitting and punching and <br/>
biting and lets talk<br/>
<br/>
they then proceeded to be &quot;best friend&quot; and wrestle with no pain<br/>
<br/>
I like that someone said- everyone deserves to feel safe in their <br/>
own home-- I take it from there-- sometimes we rough house but <br/>
hurting someone because you are not being heard is not ok-- that <br/>
falls on me to pay more attention.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Often times when kids are at their worst is when they need the most  <br/>
love. Concentrate on the idea that everyone needs to feel safe in  <br/>
their own home. Rather than making them adhere to that, make it a  <br/>
family goal. Get their ideas. Help them work with their ideas and  <br/>
revise their ideas. Add in your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Pull each aside when their fighting and have them tell you what  <br/>
happened. Ask what they could have done differently. One idea from  <br/>
Sandra was to tell them there are three steps in solving problems.<br/>
<br/>
1) Use words. If that doesn&#39;t work then:<br/>
2) Get an adult to help. If that doesn&#39;t work then:<br/>
3) You can hit.<br/>
<br/>
;-) If they did hit she&#39;d walk them through the steps to see where  <br/>
the break down was. She talks about helping kids get along and does  <br/>
it really well. Her site is a bit of an intentional rabbit warren but  <br/>
you can begin here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269350356">Dear Cara,<br/>
<br/>
Big hugs. Guilt doesn&#39;t help you or the situation.  Give yourself a break and know that you have always done the best you could with the cards you were dealt and the knowledge and tools you possessed at the time.  As for children being formed in early childhood - poppycock.  Everyone can change at any point in their lives. Practical advice - make a book of positive aspects about you husband and each of your children.  List everything you appreciate about them.  Look for evidence of them being kind and or gentle with one another (I know at first you will have a hard time noticing them, but look carefully). If you pay more attention to the good things about your family, and increasingly less attention to what is wrong with them, you will soon find more to love about them.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way - most children bicker, fight, and hit each other ocassionally, and most mothers find themselves wracked with guilt at some point in their lives - you are so not alone :) <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Lisa<br/>

What &quot;strategies&quot; do some of you use when one child is hitting because he  <br/>
feels he is not being heard? My two boys fight 90% of the day and I do feel it  <br/>
is out of frustration for one or both of them. Thanks so much.<br/>

One thing for  you.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4.5 and an almost-6 YO.  As far as my own example to my kids,<br/>
yes, I mess it up.  BUT they let me have &quot;do-overs.&quot;  They forgive me<br/>
and let me try again, even when I have to yell, &quot;REWIND!&quot; and leave<br/>
the room, come back in, and act as if the past 5 minutes never<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
They also let me apologize after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, we go through guilt.  You are not alone.<br/>

though the words never seemed to have any real connection to my remorse.<br/>
It&#39;s a whole different ball game when you model sincere, heart-felt<br/>
apologies to your kids and they witness you taking a new path ~ apologizing<br/>
for the same thing over and over and not changing what leads to that place,<br/>
is a great sign that something (*you*) needs to change.<br/>

different set of ideas/ideals, a fresh perspective. Wallowing hurts more<br/>
than it&#39;s ever helped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657497580">My strategy is to be there more, playing with them, hanging out with them, being more involved. If Simon and Linnaea are having a harder time dealing with one another unto the point of anger, I up the amount of time that I am with them. I try and make sure that all their other needs are taken care of, they aren&#39;t hungry or thirsty or tired. I do that not by making them eat or sleep or drink, but by making eating and sleeping and drinking easy, by putting food and drink that they like in easy reach and helping them to find a nice movie to watch, or to lie down with me and listen to a story, if they want to, or something else calming that will help them to rest and relax. All of those things together seem to get rid of much of the tension that occurs in our house. <br/>
