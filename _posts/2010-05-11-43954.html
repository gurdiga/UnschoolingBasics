<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820065167">My 9 yr old daughter&#39;s (Savannah) last day of public school is approaching (This coming Thursday). I have homeschooled her before and it was quite miserable. Since she&#39;s an only child, she gets bored easily and doesn&#39;t have little kids to play with. I have this wonderful computer program curriculum all picked out for her because she likes being on the computer all the time. I started researching deschooling today out of curiosity and have ended up here in this group. I am very interested in the whole unschooling thing, but I am very fearful of not getting her to do a curriculum. I am willing to give it a chance anyway. But I don&#39;t know what to do or where to start. Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated. Here&#39;s a little info on her:  She says she wants to be a horse vet when she grows up (curriculum important for college acceptance???) She just started horseback riding lessons. We did a unit study on horses before she went back to public school. She&#39;s been there for 6 months (I was in the hospital a lot so I sent her back). She likes gymnastics and will be starting a summer session in June. I really don&#39;t have a lot of money left over after those two activities, and bills, etc. I may have $100 or so to play with per month, after that I&#39;d be dipping into her savings and I&#39;m not willing to do that.  Ummm... she likes to cook and has shown an interest in sewing, however I can&#39;t stitch anything and don&#39;t know how to work a sewing machine even if I had one. She likes getting her nails painted and designed. She likes to read a little usually if it pertains to horses. She is really good at math. She hates to clean her room and do laundry! She&#39;s addicted to the computer... webkins, facebook (I know she&#39;s not old enough but she really wanted an account), etc. I don&#39;t know if any of this info even helps. But again, if anyone has any suggestions on what to do or where to start when we wake up Friday morning, that&#39;d be super great!<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100658884">I m new to the list and to full-time unschooling too but I have been homeschooling for 9 years and come Friday morning I would do nothing.  She s been in school for six months no matter what type of homeschooling you choose she s going to need some down time.  That said its almost summer reading time at the libraries.  Would she enjoy that?  Maybe trips to your local pool?  The park?  Lake?  Beach?  Feeding the ducks?  Let her get over the feelings/bussiness/seatwork of public school.  Beyond that I have no idea.  Would she like a penpal?   I have a 7 year old daughter that loves horses and ridesweekly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not bored, though. That was the Dad labeling reflection as  <br/>
bored. In that case it makes more sense to say &quot;It&#39;s okay for kids to  <br/>
be introspective and not active.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If kids say they&#39;re bored, it&#39;s respectful to honor that feeling. It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there&#39;s nothing to do. It can mean they&#39;re  <br/>
lonely. It can mean that nothing is jumping out what&#39;s around to spark  <br/>
an interest.<br/>

Its important to engage with kids - don&#39;t just leave her to her own devices. A good way to &quot;start&quot; unschooling is to imagine you&#39;re on vacation - where will you go? what will you do? Think:fun. Now&#39;s a good time if area schools are still in session - do some sightseeing, if that sounds fun to your dd and not like a &quot;learning experience&quot;. Go window shopping. Hang out in coffee shops. Ask around for when &quot;open mikes&quot; are at coffees shops, cafes and local restaurants - or kareoke nights, even. Go bowling. Go skating. Go fishing! Have some movie marathons. Host a make-up party. Do things for the fun of it and forget schooly stuff for now. Avoid lessons and &quot;educational&quot; games and toys unless your dd is clamoring for them. <br/>

<br/>
Colleges look at homeschoolers differently than conventional school kids - they know from the start they&#39;re getting something different from the norm, and many actively seek homeschoolers for &quot;diversity&quot;. Check and see what other area homeschoolers do - its going to vary, regionally. In my neck of the woods there are community college programs available to teens, and college-bound homeschoolers make use of that. Having college credit sidesteps a whole lot of questions about diplomas and graduation. Having real life experience in a related field also makes a big difference to colleges - working with animals either as a hobby or a volunteer, for instance, means a whole lot more than an &quot;A&quot; in high-school biology. <br/>

LOL! At the unschooling campout I just attended I hosted a sewing funshop. One mom asked me to show her how to set up and use her machine and then got distracted - her dd (8 or 9, I don&#39;t recall) showed up and wanted to sew some things, so I showed Her how to use the machine. I have a sneaky suspicion the dd will use it more than mom anyway ;) Machines aren&#39;t that expensive and if you find a place that repairs machines they usually sell used models. Ask around other people you know, too, sometimes folks have old machines stuck in closets, or are willing to show someone how to use a machine for fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767276233">That is exactly how Albert Einstein was able to do his best work!  He was kicked out of school in what would be our 3rd grade.  Thank goodness his mom realized that Albert wasn&#39;t what the &quot;experts&quot; said he was.  We may think &quot;ugh there they are daydreaming out the window again&quot; (like my teachers thought of me....) but there is so much processing going on inside!  Children will surprise you, just trust...<br/>
