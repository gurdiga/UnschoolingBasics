<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321110059">When my oldest (7.5) was just starting to talk we did the &quot;no, that&#39;s a bad<br/>
word&quot; thing and she caught on REALLY fast. In fact, she was often correcting<br/>
everyone around her when they would swear from the time she could talk.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we don&#39;t even care about swearing, but she still does. She tells us not<br/>
to swear. I have tried explaining to her that they are just words and that<br/>
they are expressions of strong feelings (most of the time), but she still<br/>
doesn&#39;t like it. Should we not do it out of respect to her (which is really<br/>
hard, I mean, we aren&#39;t sailors in this house. We don&#39;t really even swear a<br/>
lot and most of the time when we do it&#39;s either shit or dammit)?<br/>
<br/>
She even told me yesterday or the day before that I couldn&#39;t use God&#39;s name<br/>
in vain because it was one of the ten commandments. It was an odd thing<br/>
because we haven&#39;t even been to church in about 3 years and we don&#39;t make<br/>
the Bible part of our daily (or even weekly or monthly) lives. In fact, the<br/>
only discussions we (as in me and my husband) do have about the Bible have<br/>
to do with some of the things that we DON&#39;T agree with in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Also, our 4 yo swears like we do and we don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, but<br/>
again, Marti doesn&#39;t like it. Do you think that if we quit she will?<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what to do here.<br/>

perspective on what she&#39;s feeling.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, I associated swearing with upsetness which I  <br/>
found unsettling. It made me feel life had become unpredictable as  <br/>
though I didn&#39;t  know what people would do with that anger and it  <br/>
might get turned on me. (Which is odd since my family was even keeled  <br/>
and I can&#39;t ever remember anyone doing anything scary or anger being  <br/>
more than momentary. Just very sensitive I guess!) Which is why I  <br/>
long ago decided not to swear. I wanted to feel in control of myself.  <br/>
(Which is not an absolute. Just my child-logic at the time!)<br/>
<br/>
Also it could be she likes rules. Not controlled herself by rules,  <br/>
but rules that suggest the world works and life unfolds in  <br/>
predictable ways. I also liked rules as a child. Rules felt secure.  <br/>
Rules helped cut down on the choices I had to make. As an example,  <br/>
and I&#39;m making this up since my parents didn&#39;t impose a lot of rules  <br/>
since I had my own set! ;-), it would feel more comforting to know  <br/>
nights end at curfew rather than &quot;whenever&quot;.<br/>

me, too!!! i was wondering that also when i read the original question. i  <br/>
once decided i wasn&#39;t allowed to go barefoot until it was 80 degrees outside,  <br/>
lol! all for the same reasons above. and i can see how swearing might feel the  <br/>
same, especially since you mentioned the issue of god.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674707940">We never really told DS that anything was a &#39;bad&#39; word - we just <br/>
don&#39;t much use them anyhow so it really didn&#39;t come up. Extended <br/>
family members might use something at times but, it seems, as long <br/>
as it didn&#39;t come from *us* (me and DH), DS ignored it. Then, when <br/>
he was maybe 6ish, we had guests over one evening for dinner. DH, <br/>
DS, and one of the guests were playing a videogame and DS&#39; <br/>
character &quot;died&quot;. He said &#39;Damn&#39; - startled the heck out of me since <br/>
I&#39;d NEVER heard him say that EVER before then. The sudden <br/>
grownup &#39;hush&#39; that fell over the room upset DS and he went to his <br/>
room and requested privacy for a bit (I checked on him and that&#39;s <br/>
what he wanted). He came down a bit later and still beat both adults <br/>
at the game even with the time gap:-) For days afterward, though, he <br/>
was quite rude and unusually aggressive with DH. So, while DS and I <br/>
were on our &#39;date&#39; that week, I asked about the situation. DS was <br/>
upset that there were some words grownups could say but kids <br/>
couldn&#39;t - apparently during a vexing repair around the house, DH <br/>
had said Damn. I told DS that sometimes things slip out, adults or <br/>
kids, and what should we do about that situation. He said we should <br/>
use food words because kids can say them - so things like Popcorn! <br/>
Fudge! Peanut butter! were okay. Fine and dandy with me. Also, we <br/>
agreed that anything he heard us say, he was free to say as well. I <br/>
relayed the info to DH and he was fine with it too. Fast forward a <br/>
few years (DS is almost 10 now) - the occasional Damn slips out of <br/>
DH but DS and I basically don&#39;t use any of the typical &quot;swear <br/>
words&quot; - once DS felt free to use Damn etc he didn&#39;t need to bother <br/>
with it - things were once again equal for kids and adults in our <br/>
house and life went on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317353193">Sometimes when people behave toward me in ways that I find annoying or<br/>
offensive, yet puzzling since we are at least friendly acquaintances,<br/>
I choose to interpret their action as a kind of question: How do you<br/>
deal with this kind of behavior?<br/>
Your daughter has previously experienced from you an apparent demand<br/>
from you to change her behavior for no other reason than &quot;we don&#39;t<br/>
like it&quot;. While the swearing itself is no longer an issue, I think its<br/>
pretty likely that she&#39;s having contact with other adults in the<br/>
world, and perhaps even other children, who are demanding that she<br/>
stop doing this or that, and providing no other reason than that they<br/>
don&#39;t like it.<br/>
So it is as if she is asking you &quot;How do you deal with this?&quot; in<br/>
experiential terms, since she perhaps is not yet capable of<br/>
conceptualizing and verbalizing this.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it is possible to tell whether this is what is really<br/>
going on, but thinking of it as if it were may lead to some<br/>
interesting new choices about how to respond to her. For example, I<br/>
would be inclined to explain that we are sometimes willing to change<br/>
our behavior for someone whom we are in a relationship with for no<br/>
better reason than that they don&#39;t like it, because we value our<br/>
relationship with them and want them to feel comfortable with us;<br/>
other times we feel it is too much to ask for us to change our<br/>
behavior, and we prefer them to change theirs instead - in the form of<br/>
learning to accept ours. And as a parent we sometimes ask our children<br/>
to change their behavior, or even insist that they do, not only<br/>
because it bugs us, but because we believe it will be helpful or even<br/>
necessary for them to get along in the world. So at this point asking<br/>
your daughter to accept your swearing is another request to change her<br/>
behavior; partly because it bugs you, but also because its pretty<br/>
clear that that kind of behavior is going to bug other people too. Its<br/>
a bit awkward, in that its a reversal of your previous request/demand,<br/>
but perhaps that can also be used as an opportunity to admit that yes,<br/>
mom makes mistakes sometimes, or at any rate needs to fine-tune her<br/>
requests (what was appropriate for one age may not be appropriate for<br/>
another) and that her feedback about this is valued.<br/>
