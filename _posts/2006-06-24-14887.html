<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220574658">Just looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation and I <br/>
feel like you ladies have some great ways of dealing with things! My <br/>
10 y/o is currently struggling with his relationship with his dad. We <br/>
divorced when he was 5 because he did drugs, would not hold a job, and <br/>
got in trouble to the point that he ended up in jail. Regardless, he <br/>
remained a wonderful guy in DS&#39;s eyes. Lately, DS has come tho the <br/>
harsh realization that his dad does not make him a priority and <br/>
continues to live the same &quot;loser&quot; lifestyle that he has for years <br/>
(except for the drugs, I think). He is stressed out all the time, is <br/>
acting out by punching the couch, throwing (soft) balls as hard as he <br/>
can at the wall, crying LOTS. I&#39;m trying to be sympathetic and help <br/>
him through it but it is VERY draining to try to compensate for what <br/>
someone else won&#39;t do. He says that he just &quot;wants his dad to care <br/>
about him&quot; and &quot;take me to do fun stuff&quot;. Any advice on what I can do <br/>
to help him through this situation? Any and all thoughts are <br/>
appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491520689">Ugh!  That&#39;s a real sad story, Betsy.  I&#39;m so sorry that it&#39;s <br/>
happening to you and to Connor!<br/>
<br/>
I think the very, very best thing you can do for Connor is to listen <br/>
deeply to him, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been doing.  I know for me, when <br/>
I&#39;m going through something that&#39;s really hard to bear, it&#39;s powerful <br/>
to me to have someone else just acknowledge my struggle.  Hearing <br/>
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s really tough stuff you&#39;re going through&quot; somehow makes <br/>
me feel so much better.  When life sucks, just knowing that someone <br/>
else sees it, too, is a balm for me.  What I really hate, though, is <br/>
for someone to tell me what I should do (I&#39;m not saying that you do <br/>
this, though).  I feel like the advice-giver thinks me an incompetent <br/>
fool (which may very well be true, but I&#39;d prefer to be the only one <br/>
who thinks that, especially when I&#39;m already smarting!).  I really <br/>
don&#39;t want someone else to fix things for me (unless, of course, it&#39;s <br/>
my car).  I can and would rather fix my life myself and in my own way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that this is what you already do for Connor:  Listen to <br/>
him, acknowledge his struggle, and love him in as big a way as he&#39;s <br/>
willing to accept, even when he&#39;s saying ugly things.  To me, all <br/>
this falls under the I-can-only-control-myself-and-no-one-else <br/>
principle.  You can&#39;t make his dad toe the line, and you can&#39;t make <br/>
Connor feel okay about being blown off by his dad.  All you can <br/>
really do (I think) is control how you respond to Connor&#39;s pain and <br/>
sorrow and allow him to have a safe place to vent his deepest <br/>
feelings, when and if that&#39;s what he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I wouldn&#39;t do is engage or participate in any <br/>
dad-bashing, which you&#39;re probably not doing, either.  Neither would <br/>
I cut off any of Connor&#39;s expressions of dad-bashing; I&#39;d just listen <br/>
attentively, and if it got to any dad-bashing, I&#39;d listen and then <br/>
gently bring the discussion back (eventually) to Connor and my <br/>
acknowledgement of his struggle and feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy, that&#39;s a mighty tough scene you&#39;ve got there.  I&#39;m guessing <br/>
that the wise folks on this list will have other ideas to contribute <br/>
that I didn&#39;t even think of.  That&#39;s what I love about this <br/>
list!!  Anyway, I hope this helps, even just a little.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sending you and Connor and James {{{{hugs}}}} and strength,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257398024">Hi, Betsy, this isn&#39;t really very unschooly, but it is about listening to <br/>
your son&#39;s needs, which I think you&#39;re doing...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry your son is going through this. My 2 brothers and I went <br/>
through a very similar situation when I was 8 and they were 6 and 4. My dad <br/>
just never came home from work one day and didn&#39;t call or write until about <br/>
7 years later. My mom was very forthcoming with me about the situation but <br/>
for my brothers, she didn&#39;t make my dad out to be the actual LOSER he really <br/>
was. She let them continue to form their own opinions about him. When he <br/>
came to visit when we were older they really saw he was not a guy they <br/>
wanted to know anyway.<br/>
<br/>
However, during that time he was unaccounted for my brothers were very <br/>
angry, told huge whopping lies to their teachers at school, got into fights, <br/>
cried at the drop of a hat, etc. and my single mom just didn&#39;t know what to <br/>
do to help them. They did start to show some improvement after my mom signed <br/>
them up for the Big Brother program. Unfortunately, there aren&#39;t always a <br/>
lot of guys who want to be a part of this program so it&#39;s understaffed in <br/>
many cities. They had a blast and also started seeking out friendships with <br/>
older teen boys who were cool and allowed them to tag along. My mom also <br/>
started to do what she thought were more &quot;guy&quot; activities with the boys - <br/>
going to ballgames, watching construction sites, watching sports on TV with <br/>
them even though she hated sports.<br/>
<br/>
They both turned out to be amazingly loving and happy husbands and fathers, <br/>
by the way :)<br/>

That&#39;s very yucky, and I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
Time really will fix a lot of it---as he gets to know more about his <br/>
dad and accepts that that&#39;s the way he is. Acknowledging his feelings <br/>
and letting him vent will too.<br/>
<br/>
I think having a strong male substitute wouldn&#39;t hurt---like an uncle <br/>
or grandfather or an older friend? Someone he could talk to as a <br/>
dad-figure---any unschooling dads near you? &lt;g&gt; Someone who *will* care <br/>
about him and take him to do fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always better if it&#39;s your own, real dad, I&#39;m sure. But having <br/>
another male who cares and is a big art of lhis life could make a big <br/>
difference too.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does your son have a positive male role model?  Does he have other<br/>
adults in his life that he can talk with? My niece was raised<br/>
believing that her father was some saint that her mother had left.<br/>
She blamed her mother for years for leaving her dad.  Her dad was an<br/>
alcoholic, drug abuser, and prone to physical abuse on those around<br/>
him.  He was not some fantastic guy that she saw once or twice a year<br/>
(if that).  He died from cancer when she was around 18 years old still<br/>
with the belief that her dad was some sort of &quot;great guy.&quot;  It was at<br/>
his funeral that she learned what he was really like.  It was very<br/>
difficult for her to have this perfect picture torn apart and<br/>
shattered.  I think it would have been better for her to know why her<br/>
mom left him and what he was really like.  I think we do a disservice<br/>
to children when we are less than honest with them about people&#39;s<br/>
characters, even those of their own parents.  Her mother evading<br/>
telling her what her father was really like effected their<br/>
relationship as well.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me what a sob he was?&quot;  I<br/>
think children deserve the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Do you watch the tv show e.r.?  There is a similar story line in that<br/>
show.  One of the nurse&#39;s exes is in prison, but she never told her<br/>
son about it.  Always covered for him to make him look better than he<br/>
was.  When the boy finally found out the truth, he was devestated.<br/>
children want their parents to be saints.  I think it is important,<br/>
though, to not paint sinners as saints.  That doesn&#39;t mean we have to<br/>
tell them things in judgemental words, but we can be honest with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393649916">Just making an assumption due to lack of info, you could point out that his <br/>
father may not be doing what Conor wants, but he does care enough to <br/>
acknowledge that YOU his mother can provide for him.  i assume he doesn&#39;t <br/>
interfere with the lifestyle you have chosen to pursue.  In a way that is a <br/>
sad &quot;best thing you can say&quot;.  But by the same token there are fathers who <br/>
do even less for their children and make their life and the life of the <br/>
mother miserable.  Questioning everything, fighting for custody, <br/>
bad-mouthing, bringing the abuse into their everyday world, etc...maybe his <br/>
father is incapable of being the father he wants, but he seems to have the <br/>
sense (or cluelessness) to let well enough alone.  Perhaps if you could <br/>
sympathize with Conor for his feeling of sadness and by the same token give <br/>
him the option to sympathize for the sadness of his father it would help him <br/>
feel less out of control...give him another emotion to attach to the <br/>
situation.  Sympathy.<br/>
