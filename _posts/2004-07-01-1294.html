<div id="ygrps-yiv-916571690">***So what John Holt book would you recommend for the first book to<br/>
read?***<br/>
<br/>
Someone recommended &quot;How Children Fail&quot; as a really important book and I<br/>
would second that.  Especially since your daughter is very young.  (I<br/>
hope that was this list, and if it wasn&#39;t, I still recommend it.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Escape From Childhood&quot; makes a brilliant case for children&#39;s rights. <br/>
<br/>
I really like &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
John Holt continued to grow and develop his ideas about children and<br/>
learning.   If you read the later printings of his earlier work you will<br/>
see how his ideas changed. He makes notes in some places to clarify and<br/>
occasionally to express his regret for writing something or other.   I<br/>
really recommend the latest copies of all his books for that reason.  <br/>
You&#39;ll get a clearer understanding of his progression toward unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you can still find Growing Without Schooling somewhere, (Fun<br/>
Books, maybe?) get some old copies and read those.  <br/>
<br/>
