<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Marion Brady writes along these lines.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He says, about school curriculum:<br/>
A. has no clear, overarching aim<br/>
B. does not respect the brain&#39;s need for order and organization<br/>
C. neglects important fields of study<br/>
D. disregards the inherent seamlessness of knowledge<br/>
E. fails to move students through ever-increasing levels of  complexity<br/>
F does not distinguish between degrees of importance of content<br/>
G. insufficiently relates to real-world experience<br/>
H. neglects higher-order thought processes<br/>
J. unduly emphasizes symbol manipulation skills<br/>
K. has no built-in self-renewing capability<br/>
L. is overly dependent on extrinsic motivation<br/>
M. makes unreasonable demands on memory<br/>
N. lacks a comprehensive vocabulary shared by all educators<br/>
O. assigns students an unnatural, passive role<br/>
P. fails to put specialized studies in holistic perspective<br/>
Q. does not encourage novel, creative thought<br/>
R. penalizes rather than capitalizes on student variability<br/>
S. encourages simplistic methods of evaluation<br/>
T. neglects the basic knowledge-creating process<br/>
U. fails to address ethical and moral issues<br/>
<br/>
All of this matters a lot for designing a curriculum that is going to<br/>
be &quot;used on&quot; students who are required to be &quot;in school.&quot; What a<br/>
great world it would be, if this kind of thinking about schooling was<br/>
pervasive.<br/>
<br/>
But the ONLY one that really matters to unschoolers is &quot;O&quot; - assigns<br/>
students an unnatural, passive role.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling could almost be defined as the opposite of that - it is<br/>
allowing children their &quot;natural, active role&quot; in their own learning.<br/>
If we do that well, ALL the rest of Brady&#39;s points will take care of<br/>
themselves.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
