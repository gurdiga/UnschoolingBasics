So here&#39;s the post from another list:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have made it to radical unschooling yet, but I&#39;d<br/>
like to...and think I&#39;m ready for the next step...but I need HELP!<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with a lot of physical and verbal abuse, I don&#39;t want that<br/>
for my children. My kids are older and I know I will never be able<br/>
to undo what is already done, but where and how do I start making<br/>
changes (the un-&quot;school&quot;-ing part was easy, I&#39;m not so sure that<br/>
this will be)? Will it be enough since I&#39;m starting so late in<br/>
their childhoods?<br/>
<br/>
I want to stop yelling but that has been a really hard habit to<br/>
break. My first instinct is to yell, then later, I realize how I<br/>
could have done it differently. By then it&#39;s too late...damage<br/>
done. I feel like a hypocrit since I am constantly &quot;yelling&quot; at my<br/>
kids to &quot;talk&quot; their problems out.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 13yo. daughter that has a seriously bad attitude. She is<br/>
beyond the point of hurting the feelings of others and is damaging<br/>
her relationships. I know some of this is due to her age...but I&#39;m<br/>
afraid it will only continue to get worse. She is constantly using<br/>
everyone as her doormat and making them feel like dirt. How do<br/>
I &quot;check her attitude&quot; and show her the damage she is doing but<br/>
still be radically unschooling? How do you enforce &quot;the personal<br/>
rights/respect of others rules&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
My son will be 10 next week. He ignores our requests to help with<br/>
the household chores. He&#39;ll say okay to a job, but<br/>
then &quot;conveniently disappears&quot;/puts off until someone else has done<br/>
the job or it has piled up extensively. He will then claim we are<br/>
being mean and unfair to make him follow through with the work he<br/>
chose. Because by then, the job is harder and longer than before.<br/>
How do I get him to do his chores and be part of the family &quot;clean-<br/>
up&quot; but still be radically unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I need clarification on what radically unschooling means when it<br/>
comes to discipline, chores, attitudes, etc. We already have<br/>
school, food, bedtime, entertainment, etc. down...but need major<br/>
help with &quot;correction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for anything you can offer.</div>

(You can probably get it through interlibrary loan though there are  <br/>
used ones at Amazon for a penny (not including shipping and handling  <br/>
of course!)<br/>
<br/>
The basic premise is not to do or say anything that doesn&#39;t build a  <br/>
relationship with your daughter. Keep in mind that people hurt others  <br/>
because they&#39;re hurting themselves. For some kids the hormones of  <br/>
adolescence are pretty painful and that makes them irritable and  <br/>
people react to their irritation with anger and irritation which only  <br/>
makes it worse.<br/>
<br/>
I was grumpy a lot my teen years. Telling me how wrong it was to be  <br/>
angry at the world wouldn&#39;t have helped. What I needed was someone  <br/>
who understood. That would have taken a lot of work because I didn&#39;t  <br/>
trust my parents to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will help if you set your goal as becoming someone your  <br/>
daughter will talk to without judging her. Perhaps it will help if  <br/>
you picture her online in a chat room and some &quot;friend&quot; says &quot;I  <br/>
understand. That&#39;s really sucky. Tell me about it.&quot; Predators know  <br/>
how to be<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son will be 10 next week. He ignores our requests to help with<br/>
&gt; the household chores.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before puberty, when I&#39;d ask my daughter to do something simple like  <br/>
sort socks or fold towels with me, she&#39;d groan and act like I was  <br/>
asking her to reshingle the roof! At 12 or so she could do it with  <br/>
ease. Though it seemed simple, it really was hard for her and I  <br/>
needed to trust what she was trying to tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that -- if we want to put relationship first -- the  <br/>
chores belong to us. We brought the kids into the world and all the  <br/>
upkeep is our responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Once we accept that, then when we ask for help, we&#39;re asking from a  <br/>
different mindset. We *are* truly asking, knowing the answer could be  <br/>
no. We are appreciative of what little help they give us. And when we  <br/>
ask  like that, when we appreciate the fact that they&#39;re interrupting  <br/>
something they find important to them to do something that isn&#39;t fun  <br/>
for us, then we become people they *want* to do things for.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t expect him to start helping just because you&#39;re asking  <br/>
differently! For a while, until he trusts that you don&#39;t expect him  <br/>
to help, he&#39;s going to hear &quot;Do this,&quot; regardless of how you ask.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too little to adequately explain what I mean. There&#39;s a lot  <br/>

I grew up with a lot of physical and verbal abuse, I don&#39;t want that<br/>

this will be)? Will it be enough since I&#39;m starting so late in<br/>
their childhoods?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If your husband had been hitting you, would having him simply STOP <br/>
HITTING be a good enough starting point?<br/>
<br/>
Would it be better for you if your husband would keep on hitting you <br/>
because he&#39;d decided so late in the marriage to make a change? Would it <br/>
be worth it if he stopped hitting and *then* started being kinder and <br/>
kinder and kinder?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want to stop yelling but that has been a really hard habit to<br/>
break. My first instinct is to yell, then later, I realize how I<br/>
could have done it differently. By then it&#39;s too late...damage<br/>
done. I feel like a hypocrit since I am constantly &quot;yelling&quot; at my<br/>
kids to &quot;talk&quot; their problems out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First--before you open your mouth to yell, take a DEEP breath. Count to <br/>
ten. And *say* what you had planned to yell. It might not sound so bad <br/>
if it&#39;s being said rather than being yelled. Next time, try to say it <br/>
gently and kindly.<br/>
<br/>
Apologize for having yelled in the past---and apologize NOW if you <br/>
revert to yelling---even for a moment! Do a Wllie Wonka&quot; &quot;Stop, rewind, <br/>
reverse that!&quot; Let them know that, even at your advanced age &lt;g&gt;, you <br/>
are capable of change. That you&#39;re working to be a better mom. That you <br/>
don&#39;t want to yell ---or to even be creepy. After a while, they&#39;ll see <br/>
you&#39;re serious and start helping you!<br/>

<br/>
Has she been made a doormat in the past? Has she been made to feel like <br/>
dirt?<br/>
<br/>
Be nicer to her. A LOT nicer to her.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let her be mean to others, Stop her by pulling her aside and <br/>
telling her so. Tell her that you wont allow *ANY*one to treat her that <br/>
way any more (AND MEAN IT!!!), but you can&#39;t allow her to treat others <br/>
that way either.<br/>
<br/>
Be nicer to her. Let her see what kindness feels like.<br/>

-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Quit asking him. For three years. Or until he decides that it&#39;s worth <br/>
helping out.<br/>
<br/>
Household chores don&#39;t belong to him. They belong to you. YOU do them <br/>
until he&#39;s able and willing to help out of his own need/want to <br/>
contribute.<br/>
<br/>
Have you made chores seem unpleasant in the past: like complaining that <br/>
you have to vacuum AGAIN? Or that you HATE to do the dishes? Or that <br/>
the laundry is PILING up AGAIN?<br/>
<br/>
Why would a small child CHOOSE to do something that the adults in his <br/>
house hate to do?<br/>
<br/>
Next time you do the dishes, mention how nice the warm water feels. <br/>
Next time you vacuum, sing while you do it. Next time you do laundry, <br/>
marvel at how big they&#39;ve all gotten.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect him to want to help for years. Then be genuinely grateful <br/>
when he *does* help---at whatever level<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I need clarification on what radically unschooling means when it<br/>
comes to discipline, chores, attitudes, etc. We already have<br/>
school, food, bedtime, entertainment, etc. down...but need major<br/>
help with &quot;correction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What exactly have *YOU* been modelling?<br/>
Top-down management regarding discipline? Chores? Attitude?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re having to &quot;correct&quot; the behavior you&#39;ve been modelling.<br/>
<br/>
Correct your own, and the children will follow suit.<br/>

deep breath, tuck your chin in toward your neck - the physiology <br/>
makes it really hard to yell in that position. Think about it - when <br/>
you yell, you typically have your head up and stretched out from <br/>
your neck and shoulders a bit. Tucking your chin might help <br/>
physically remind you to change the tone/volume until not yelling <br/>
becomes more of a habit than yelling.<br/>

priorities from your kids who have *different* priorities, your <br/>
expectations are likely to get punctured. That sets you up for <br/>
resentment and anger and sets them up to disappoint you. Take away <br/>
the expectation. Ask for help ONLY when you absolutely can&#39;t get it <br/>
done some other way (like if you need help carrying the chocolate <br/>
milk, the plate of cookies, the brownies, and the can of soft drink <br/>
and the show is about to start so you don&#39;t want to do multi trips).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And don&#39;t forget to make things nice for yourself while you&#39;re doing <br/>
them as well - I&#39;ve fallen in love with the orange scented organic <br/>
dish washing liquid - it&#39;s so perky and energizing that I don&#39;t mind <br/>
doing the dishes so much. Sing to music *you* like. Watch a favorite <br/>
movie while doing the laundry (and pause it when you go to switch <br/>
loads). *Invite* your kids to keep you company while you&#39;re sorting -<br/>
 with no *expectation* that they&#39;ll do anything but be there to keep <br/>
you company. Maybe pick a family favorite to watch while you sort <br/>
and fold on the loveseat while they watch from the couch and the <br/>
recliner. Just *be* together, with no expectations. It really does <br/>
work. If I&#39;m doing dishes or tidying the kitchen and DS (8) is there <br/>
just chatting, telling me about his day (since I WOH) or explaining <br/>
a battle in a videogame or whatever, and I ask him to take something <br/>
to the trash or go get me a sponge or whatever, he is likely to do <br/>
it simply because it&#39;s part of the flow of the situation. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to - but he&#39;s likely to just in the midst of everything else.<br/>
