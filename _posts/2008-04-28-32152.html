<div id="ygrps-yiv-994756684">*** Payge (almost 5) got a drink of water out of the water fountain. Some<br/>
water got on her shirt. She hates that. She started to cry, asking<br/>
for a dry shirt. We didn&#39;t have one with us (mental note always keep<br/>
spare clothes in the car). She didn&#39;t want to play, she didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go home, she just wanted a dry shirt. Trying to explain that it<br/>
would dry wasn&#39;t any help. It wasn&#39;t close enough to home to run back<br/>
and get one, and the place was closing in an hour anyhow. My first<br/>
thought was frustration. Something like &quot;We spent $15 for everyone to<br/>
get into this place, and now you&#39;re not going to play because your<br/>
shirt is wet.&quot;<br/>
The thought quickly passed, as I tried to find a way to meet her<br/>
need.***<br/>
<br/>
Can a &quot;need&quot; sometimes be just to validate feelings?<br/>
<br/>
I have NO IDEA what the situation was like (or the history behind the<br/>
situation) for Kendrah and her daughter.  I&#39;m sure Kendrah knows her<br/>
daughter and the best way to handle this situation.  But this post got me<br/>
thinking about how I might need to validate my children&#39;s feelings more, and<br/>
not necessarily &quot;fix&quot; the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Today my son&#39;s brand new water gun wouldn&#39;t work.  He threw a fit. His<br/>
sister was outside having fun with hers, and he was stuck inside crying.  I<br/>
gave him a hug, and tried to fix his gun.  When that wouldn&#39;t work, I told<br/>
him we&#39;d go to the store and see if we could exchange it.  (But not today.)<br/>
I asked DD if she would mind giving him a turn with hers.  She said, &quot;No,&quot;<br/>
which I had to respect.  DS moped and cried, and I was upset that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
give him what he needed.<br/>
<br/>
Now I wonder...Did he just need me to help him realize that his feelings<br/>
were normal and okay to have?  Maybe he didn&#39;t want me to fix the problem.<br/>

Kids don&#39;t need their feelings validated. They&#39;re born knowing their  <br/>
feelings are valid. It&#39;s only when adults start dismissing their  <br/>
feelings that children might get the idea that there&#39;s something  <br/>
wrong with them.<br/>
<br/>
What kids often want is what adults want: someone to sympathize,  <br/>
someone who understands what&#39;s going on inside of them. It&#39;s so  <br/>
relieving when someone says &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that really stinks when that  <br/>
happens.&quot; (And ruined when followed by a &quot;but&quot;!)<br/>
<br/>
What needs validated is the child&#39;s feelings for *you*. You need to  <br/>
accept that the child&#39;s feelings are valid even if you don&#39;t  <br/>
understand or you think it&#39;s silly to be that upset over something or  <br/>
want something.<br/>

on this journey of mindful parenting.   Thinking back to when I was a<br/>
kid or even as an adult when something was important and someone tried<br/>
to tell me it wasn&#39;t important.  Well if it&#39;s important to them it is<br/>
important-maybe not the most important thing ever but life is full of<br/>
things that are important in a host of different ways or on many<br/>
different levels.   <br/>

sympathetically and very unobtrusively.<br/>
It sometimes took two or three days before she&#39;d want to talk about  <br/>
something that was really upsetting her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is the point, but the word validate is the wrong word. Not sure  <br/>
who labeled it that. It&#39;s old. I&#39;ve heard it for decades. And it  <br/>
builds the wrong picture for parents who are new to the idea of  <br/>
supporting their child&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Validate means support the truth of. When you have your parking  <br/>
ticket validated by a store it means the parking garage won&#39;t take  <br/>
your word for it that you bought something at the store. The store  <br/>
needs to validate your word.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve seen &quot;validate your child&#39;s feelings&quot; used in parenting  <br/>
advice columns exactly like that. &quot;Let your child know his feelings  <br/>
are okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids already know their feelings are truth. They don&#39;t need someone  <br/>
telling them their feelings are all right. (Well, not always. But at  <br/>
least in terms of this general blanket parenting &quot;rule&quot; to validate  <br/>
your child&#39;s feelings.)<br/>
