<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452836905">I just created a group, inspired by Jake&#39;s suggestion, for <br/>
unschooling kids.<br/>
<br/>
Someone posted to his Unschooling Gamers list about their Care Bears. <br/>
Sadly, Jake didn&#39;t feel right about approving that message, as the <br/>
list is for gaming discussions.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Tell them to post it on your Shine unschooling list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;What?? My list is adults. A child posted this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Well, there should be a list for kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now there is.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We Are Unschoolers&quot;<br/>
