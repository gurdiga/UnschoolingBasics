<div id="ygrps-yiv-929581137">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I know that we already know that learning is everywhere, but I wanted  <br/>
to share this story. Payge (my 4.5 y/o dd) has been interested in  <br/>
spelling words lately, by her own accord. We (the kids and I) were at  <br/>
my mom&#39;s house this week. My mom has one of those DYMO label makers.  <br/>
Payge wanted to know what it was and how it worked. I showed her.  <br/>
Then she started labeling everything in my mom&#39;s house. First she did  <br/>
words she knew how to spell (usually 3-4 letter ones). Dog, cat,  <br/>
door, doll, etc. Then she started asking me how to spell larger words  <br/>
like window, refrigerator, counter, etc. By the time we were getting  <br/>
ready to leave she had labeled what appeared to be almost everything.  <br/>
She learned how to spell lots of new words, which she&#39;s still talking  <br/>
about. I&#39;m sure she got more out of that &quot;spelling lesson&quot;, than I  <br/>
ever did at her age in pre-school!<br/>

Your ltory is making me want to go and get a labelmaker! (I&#39;ve been<br/>
thinking of getting one, but this makes it sound like FUN!)<br/>
thanks for sharing-<br/>
