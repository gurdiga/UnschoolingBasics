<div id="ygrps-yiv-5425540">I have 2 boys age 9 and 12 that have been in public school since Kindergarten.  They are at home with me this year and I really don&#39;t know where to start or what to do with them.  I was hoping for some advice.<br/>
<br/>
We tried an online public school at the beginning of the school year, but that didn&#39;t work out, so we are on our own now.  I&#39;ve tried purchasing inexpensive workbooks for them to use, but it&#39;s just not working out either.  <br/>
<br/>
Help!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550455413">What do you and your children want your lives to look like?  What do you<br/>
mean when you say it&#39;s &quot;not working&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The easiest start is to just be with your kids, see what they get excited<br/>
about and dive in with them to enjoy those things.  Just live.  The learning<br/>
is in the living.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have some workbooks, only because my kids expressed interest in them<br/>
(well, my 6yo and 10yo anyway), but they rarely get used.  My 6yo kind of<br/>
likes tracing letters and doing some of the sound identifying activities- my<br/>
10yo went through a phase of that when she was about 3yo, though I suspect<br/>
what she liked most was the time I spent sitting with her and showing her<br/>
what to do as she asked.  My kids have never done a math worksheet, but have<br/>
a really intuitive sense of math.  Once when my son was about 13yo, I showed<br/>
him how people lay out long calculations on paper (at about 2am when the<br/>
subject came up in conversation).  But they mostly do everyday math<br/>
calculations fairly easily and accurately in their heads- without ever<br/>
having been &quot;taught&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to mean anyone else&#39;s experience will look like ours- this is<br/>
just one way it *can* look.  That&#39;s the beauty of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>

Read those, take the time to let the ideas sink in.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, I heard something that helped unschooling click for me: &quot;Unschooling is living your life as if there were no such thing as school.&quot; I got that: no grade levels, no need to learn certain things by certain times.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do on summer vacation? Do that. Take time to BE, with no agenda other than fun.<br/>
<br/>
I know the transition can be tricky, but you&#39;ll feel more at peace soon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295928864">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My boys are also 9 and 12. 12 yr old has been out of school 2 yrs, 9 yr old<br/>
just a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely de school ie tell them they are going to have a long Christmas<br/>
break so that they don&#39;t get anxious. In the meantime observe what they like<br/>
doing and build on that. Socialise if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
My  9 yr old spends most of the day watching tv but that is because he&#39;s<br/>
deschooling. He loves Dr Who so I&#39;ve built on that with lots of book,<br/>
activity books, watching dvds with him and discussing them.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old is passionate about video games. He plays them a lot but also<br/>
spends hrs on the computer reading about them and loves gaming books and<br/>
magazines. He has friends over to play games with him . It&#39;s amazing what<br/>
they can learn - history, geography, physics, maths not to mention hand eye<br/>
coordination.<br/>
<br/>
Not all unschoolers spend all day in front of a screen! We&#39;re not a sporty<br/>
family but we do socialize, kids prefer to do it at our house.<br/>
<br/>
Read lots about unschooling (yourself, not the boys) and join lots of list<br/>
like this one to build up yr confidence. You&#39;ve already made a good start by<br/>
asking yr question.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>
Anita <br/>
