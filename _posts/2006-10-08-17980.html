Being  polite means just<br/>
not being offensive. I have never stressed the &quot;ma&#39;am and  sir&quot; thing.<br/>
Never. Even before I was unschooling. I also don&#39;t insist that  my<br/>
children call adults by Mr. or Mrs. _______. Just their names.<br/>
That&#39;s  how I introduce them to my adults friends. &quot;Martha this is my<br/>
daughter  Emily. Emily this is my friend Martha.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
I missed the original post on this.<br/>
 <br/>
I treat my kids the way I believe they will be &quot;expected&quot; to treat someone  <br/>
else.  I live in the land of &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;sir&quot;.  I speak that way to  other <br/>
people naturally and I speak that way to my children.  That  sounds weird &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
When my daughter says &quot;mom????&quot;, I say pleasantly &quot;yes, ma&#39;am?&quot;  But I  would <br/>
never insist on her saying it back.  If she is going someplace where  that <br/>
sort of thing is expected, I might talk to her about  being mindful of it.<br/>
 <br/>
I introduce or talk about adults the way the adult would like to be  called.  <br/>
So our neighbors are &quot;Miss Marcie&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot; and  &quot;Linda&quot;.....all <br/>
about the same age.<br/>
 <br/>
Like all things in social interractions, there is a huge spectrum of  <br/>
possibilities.  Manners are a custom to help people speak a  common language of <br/>
respect and kindness.   Like all other languages,  children will pick up what is <br/>
useful for them and we will emphasize some things  that will help them navigate. <br/>
 I think they become more intuned with time  and experience.<br/>
 <br/>
If a person feels disrespected just because someone left out a &quot;ma&#39;am&quot;,  <br/>
well, that is their problem.  I used to get in trouble when we moved to New  <br/>
Jersey when I was a child because I said &quot;yes ma&#39;am!&quot;, they thought I was being  <br/>
elitist.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, my husband used to be on the Presidential helicopters.  I  never <br/>
got to meet either the Clintons or the Bushes, but many of my friends  did.  <br/>
One friend even had Thanksgiving dinner at Camp David with the  Clintons.  <br/>
Anyhoo, the staff makes sure that you know your presidential  etiquette before you <br/>
talk with them.  I&#39;ll have to ask my husband  when he wakes up if he ever saw <br/>
someone act &quot;inappropriately&quot; (gasp!)  and see what happened.  <br/>

I just wanted to share a funny we have never use yes sir or yes ma&#39;am, my  <br/>
husband was in the navy and has some serious issues with the phrase Yes  Sir  so <br/>
we just dont say it....  Anyhow my  7 yr old about a yr  ago started using <br/>
the phrases to put us in our place.  If we are being too  authoritive we get Yes <br/>
Ma&#39;am.  Its not said disrespectfully at all so at  first it took a few time <br/>
to figure out  hey hes actually pointing out OUR  bad behavior.  Now its nice I <br/>
always know when I go a step too far in his  world... example would be  Jacob <br/>
go clean your room NOW hed reply Yes  Ma&#39;am....  to which I now go  ouch <br/>
guess that was a bit rough   how about I help you pick up your toys so the dog <br/>
doesnt chew anything up... and  then I get ok Mom!!!   Smiles<br/>
