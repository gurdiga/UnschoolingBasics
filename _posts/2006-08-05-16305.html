<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115236828">&quot;Anyway, it works for us. I am though, totally open <br/>
to others opinions and thoughts on this!! :-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I think 3-4 year olds are too young for speech therapy. I think<br/>
they&#39;re too young for any kind of schooling. I think it&#39;s damaging. I<br/>
think if your goal is unschooling, then getting school out of your<br/>
lives and thinking SOONER is better than later.:)<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s that for a few opinions? (picture me smiling here, I AM serious,<br/>
but I&#39;m having fun too).<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that if you think this is all helping him, you might<br/>
want to read a LOT more about unschooling and see if you still think<br/>
that!! You might just find that a joyful, interesting home is the BEST<br/>
thing for him.<br/>
