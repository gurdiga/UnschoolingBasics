<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254938971">We are considering selling it all and living and traveling the country <br/>
in an RV for several years...until we are just &quot;Done&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Wondering if anyone has done this, knows anyone who has done this, has <br/>
any thoughts on doing this with 3 kids (5,9,13) all boys, and a <br/>
working from the computer hubby, dog and cat.??  <br/>
<br/>
Just thinking right now, but wondering if we are just off our rocker <br/>
and isn&#39;t it enough that we unschool?  If we unschool and DH works <br/>
from the computer, then why NOT travel?  We cannot afford to keep up <br/>
our house though and horses AND travel extensively.  That is why the <br/>
thought of just going all out, and getting out.  Something in me sees <br/>
the &quot;typical&quot; lifestyle so draining anyway, but I realize that RVing <br/>
full time has its own set of demands.  We have done it for vacations <br/>
before, so we are aware of that!  I am more concerned with the lack of <br/>
home--aspects on the kids, the tight quarters, and again, the lack of <br/>
a A home.  Of course home is where the family is, but is that really <br/>
how the kids feel?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;d have to talk to *your* kids to see how they felt about it. I<br/>
have one who&#39;d settle into the RV as a home, and one who would hate<br/>
being in different surroundings so frequently. Or, that&#39;s what they&#39;ve<br/>
said. We weren&#39;t talking about it seriously, we were having a<br/>
conversation after I heard of a yahoo group (? if I&#39;m remembering<br/>
correctly), of road-schoolers. &#39;Roads&#39; Scholars. heh<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to quit if, after you started out, you realized<br/>
one of your kids really didn&#39;t like it?<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what happened to my sister and her family. They  sold<br/>
their house in Alaska and hit the road a couple years ago. You can<br/>
read about their journey at fivefreebirds.com.<br/>
<br/>
The plan was to be on the road at least a year and find a new place to<br/>
settle down. All the kids just wanted to go home to Alaska for the<br/>
most part, though they had a lot of fun too. One of my nephews did NOT<br/>
do well with the constant lack of predictability.<br/>
<br/>
They headed back to Alaska after six months and bought a house.:)<br/>
Heidi and Martin could easily live on the road and love it...not<br/>
everyone in the house felt the same but they didn&#39;t know it until they<br/>
tried it. So if you&#39;re willing to adapt to needs, I think it can be a<br/>
truly great experience.<br/>
<br/>
My children prefer a home base, heck I do too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887740867">We have talked about doing this too - both our girls would love it, DD1 <br/>
is happy anywhere she can plug her lapyop in and DD2 just loves going to <br/>
new places. We move quite a lot as it is - I dont think we have lived <br/>
anywhere for more than 2 years for the last decade so they are used to <br/>
change and both have a small collection of &#39;essential&#39; things that they <br/>
need around them.<br/>
<br/>
Our problem, living in Europe, is one of languages. For you guys in the <br/>
States its simpler as you can drive from state to state and get temp <br/>
jobs etc &#39;fairly&#39; easily to keep the cash coming in, but over here each <br/>
country has its own language so its not quite as simple.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about langauge teaching as an option for us - I nned to <br/>
get my degree (which I am working on) and DH already has one, and then <br/>
the TEFL (teach english as a foreign langauge) course is a quite short <br/>
one. Once we both get that then we are set as one benefit of most <br/>
countries in Europe not speaking English is that they are full of people <br/>
who want to lean.<br/>
<br/>
So now we just need to save up for the RV or whatever - I personally <br/>
like the converted bus concept most - but finding somewhere to store and <br/>
work on a bus in the middle of the city is not so practical.<br/>
<br/>
How about the life without the RV? Does anyone know if that works?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524224608">And you really need to check out this unschooling family&#39;s blog:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fuhkauifamily.blogspot.com/">http://fuhkauifamily.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Vicki does a great job of documenting their travels, complete with amazing<br/>
photos.  And, on the right of the blog, there&#39;s a little link (right under<br/>
the purple yahoogroups button) to join the unschoolingfotr list.  Vicki set<br/>
this one up so that unschoolers who were doing the full time traveling thing<br/>
didn&#39;t have to sit through endless discussions on &quot;how do you do school on<br/>
the road, how will I fit all of our curriculum materials in an rv&quot; chatter<br/>
that occurs on the regular fotr list (though that list is larger, and there<br/>
is good information to be had there, as well).<br/>
<br/>
Nope, you are NOT off your rocker!  There are so many families that do<br/>
this.  We did it for about a year, and plan to do more in the future.  Our<br/>
boys, 9, 6, and 3, are all very much in favor.  Especially if it means we<br/>
get to spend part of the winter in Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Mexico, check out this site about a family who travels full<br/>
time, and spends the entire winter in Mexico.  And they&#39;re unschoolers, too,<br/>
I believe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Kelley,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are in the process of doing this right now!  We are waiting for <br/>
our house to sell, and then we will hit the road.  We had talked <br/>
about it on and off for the past year and finally decided it was <br/>
time to act instead of just wishing.  We have three children, two <br/>
cats, two guinea pigs and a bunny...all going along...<br/>
When we first approached the kids with the idea, it was just that, <br/>
an idea.  We did not decide to do it until everyone was on board <br/>
with what we would be doing.  It was a process for us all.  <br/>
Ultimately, we asked the kids if they would like to do something <br/>
like this, and then asked what we could do to make it as &quot;normal&quot; as <br/>
possible for them...well...normal to us!!!  They had many ideas, <br/>
like helping to pick where we go, laptops and webcams to keep in <br/>
touch with friends, helping to decide what we &quot;really&quot; needed in a <br/>
motorhome, etc...the hardest part for them has been getting rid of <br/>
all of our things.  While I am finding it completely freeing, they <br/>
are requiring more time, and if needed i will arrange for storage if <br/>
they feel they cannot part with something, or even everthing.  They <br/>
are excited most days, but there is still a day once in a while when <br/>
they say they don&#39;t want to go...then the next day they are <br/>
planning some adventure on the other side of the world for us!  I <br/>
think the important thing is to talk, talk, and talk some more, so <br/>
everyone feels that their ideas, concerns, fears, and wishes are <br/>
valid and being heard. And that everyone knows that the plans are <br/>
flexible in order to meet everyones needs.<br/>
Feel free to contact me if you&#39;d like to talk about anything else <br/>
this journey may have in store for you and your family.<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736012019">My husband and I have been considering moving south for several years.  (as soon as our older daughter&#39;s graduate High School).   We had already planned to home school our younger 2 (now 2 and 4).  And then last week, 2 days before the post... he started talking about RVing full time.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, things just happen I guess.  I joined this group to fiind out more about unschooling, and then someone asks about rving.... (like a sign or something!)  It really sounds doable.  Right now, we are in MA... cold weather, high mort, rat race kind of job.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing where this post goes, and am so excited and relieved to see that there are so many others out there that do the same thing we are thinking of.   I am hoping for a Fall 2009 move.  But, we will see what happens.<br/>

that were recommended.  WOW--unschoolers--in the real way, and <br/>
living life with all its ups and downs traveling to places few of us <br/>
can afford to go for longer than 5 days.  <br/>
<br/>
One family lives 6 months in Mexico and the kids all learned math by <br/>
converting $&#39;s to pesos etc.  Amazing families!  By reading their <br/>
blogs, I am still left wondering if this is something you embark on <br/>
and it might only last 5 months, or 1 year or whatever--which is <br/>
fine, except for THEN WHAT?  Are you behind the 8 ball since you <br/>
have taken off and lost a lot of the contacts etc that you had in <br/>
place where you lived?  Maybe you don&#39;t ever return to whence you <br/>
came.  My guess is, kind of--how could you?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids so far are talking about it as an idea.  They think it&#39;s <br/>
cool--of course.  I worry about friendships, lasting, enduring <br/>
friendships.  Baseball teams etc.  My DH says--we are not talking <br/>
about forever here, our boys are 5, 9 and 13.  The 3 year old has <br/>
done all of that, and walked away.  He is really the strandloper at <br/>
heart.  The other 2 are still attached to me at the hip, and <br/>
therefore I bet that wherever I am, if I am excited, happy and <br/>
content; they will be too!<br/>
<br/>
But, it is the shear walking away from &quot;mainstream&quot; that worries me <br/>
on some level.  Lack of my own garden, horses, compost pile, porch.  <br/>
Replace them with the awning, the folding picnic tables, the scenery <br/>
of Sedona, Baja, Maine etc.  Obviously, they are 2 entirely <br/>
different choices, hard to compare apples to oranges.<br/>
<br/>
I just think perhaps there is no better way to unschool than to <br/>
traverse the country.  Not forever, but maybe for 2 years?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all the responses.  It helps knowing that I am not <br/>
losing my marbles.  I don&#39;t think I have any to spare!!<br/>

<br/>
I am new to the list and had to jump in here as I have always felt <br/>
some kind of tug to move around.  Anyway, my name is Mel and we (my <br/>
husband and I) have two fun and vibrant boys ages 6 & 4.  I, on <br/>
Sunday night was trying to convince my hubby to take a year off so <br/>
that we can see the world.  I was inspired by an old Reader&#39;s Digest <br/>
article about a family who travelled for a year doing various <br/>
environmental and charitable work. My husband needs security and <br/>
continuity.  He would not be in for my fantasy.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I could go on and on here but my point is, if as a <br/>
collective, everyone in your home wants to travel, embrace that!  And <br/>
like a previous poster had mentioned, you can always put down roots <br/>
somewhere else if your family is feeling the need.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Travels!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864397206">Hi All,<br/>
As of last Thursday, April 10th, we are now considered Unschoolers on <br/>
the Road of Life<br/>
although we are not in an RV (which is something we are considering)<br/>
<br/>
My husbands co. has us moving around state to state managing the <br/>
build of mall stores.  Each build takes 6 to 7 weeks and they pay a <br/>
weekly set lodging and food expense.  This allows us to negotiate <br/>
short term leases w/corporate/furnished apartment complexes.  We have <br/>
a 14 yr old dd and we had to down size tremendously and utilize a <br/>
storage unit.  She was excited at the thought of our &#39;adventure&#39; and <br/>
did a great job of deciding what things she really wanted to take, to <br/>
get rid of and to store. <br/>
<br/>
This is our first job out and we are staying in New Hartford, NY <br/>
between Albany and Syracuse.  <br/>
DD had no problem making friends and within the first two days the <br/>
phone was already ringing for her to come outside and hang out with <br/>
the gang.  Fortunately the kids are on spring break here so she was <br/>
able to get in a lot of kid socializing this week. I think it also <br/>
gave her some confidence that the making new friends with strangers <br/>
game is not going to be as hard as she thought it might be. She never <br/>
seemed to have a problem making friends back at home but she did <br/>
express her concerns when we first got here.<br/>
<br/>
I think so far our biggest challenge has been, renting out our home <br/>
(to family) giving someone else the responsibility of making sure <br/>
important mail gets to us, and leaving our family dog. (heart <br/>
wrenching) we wanted to get a feel for this life before we tried to <br/>
bring him with us.  Unfortunately most of the corporate housing units <br/>
are not animal friendly. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have had a few moments of anxiety with just trying <br/>
to get used to the dynamics of this new life style.  <br/>
It really is a challenge, but keeping an open mind and an attitude <br/>
of &quot;this is an adventure&quot; and &quot;a means to accomplishing our goals&quot;  <br/>
will be key to making this whole life changing decision an exciting <br/>
experience.<br/>
Our family goal is to build or purchase a resort in Puerto Rico to <br/>
run as a family with in the next few years. So by keeping  that goal <br/>
in the fore front as well as enjoying all of new terrain and visiting <br/>
as many attractions in each new location..it will be a wonderful life <br/>
experience for the three of us.<br/>
<br/>
PS.  Anyone in the New Hartford, NY area??<br/>
Andrea<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791685393">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I am mostly a lurker and love reading all the posts and have learned<br/>
so much from this group...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am not RVing, but just wanted to share our story.<br/>
<br/>
We are from South Africa and decided early 2006 to pack up our house<br/>
and move across the world to Taiwan (actually to a little island<br/>
between Taiwan and China called Kinmen, although we are now living in<br/>
Taiwan, on the east coast).<br/>
<br/>
We arrived with a suitcase of clothes each and bag of homeschooling<br/>
books (I was not unschooling at this stage).<br/>
<br/>
My husband actually left 2 months before us and I was left to pack up<br/>
the house and take care of things, move in with my parents and then<br/>
travel alone with our three boys, at that stage they were 3, 5 and 6<br/>
years old! (Not fun!!!) LOL<br/>
<br/>
It was very difficult in the beginning as it is so different to what<br/>
we were used to.  Everything from language, food, culture, religion <br/>
was so different, not to mention that we also had to adjust to living<br/>
in a small apartment.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest son battled in the beginning and just wanted to go back to<br/>
SA, until we moved to another part of the island (where we are now),<br/>
that has a big park nearby (he loves being outdoors and back home in<br/>
SA we had a big 4 bedroom house with a swimming pool and a big garden<br/>
- so it was a BIG adjustment for the boys - who love the outdoors -<br/>
they are much happier now).<br/>
<br/>
Our next move, when our time is done here in Taiwan, we will be moving<br/>
to another little island, off the east coast of Africa called<br/>
Mauritius - this is where we will settle and call home.... The boys<br/>
are very excited about this and can&#39;t wait! <br/>
<br/>
Although my husband still has his dream of going to the States and<br/>
RVing....who knows???<br/>
<br/>
But this move has done wonders for us as a family...having no extended<br/>
family around, really brings you closer to each other, and it also<br/>
helped in our transition to unschooling - no &quot;well meaning&quot; family and<br/>
friends questioning our decisions! LOL<br/>
<br/>
And of course the BEST part of our moving to Taiwan is the fact that<br/>
we now have a little girl we are in the final stages of adopting from<br/>
Taiwan!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share about our experience:o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46365143">Wow that is quite a relocation :D your husband must work for an<br/>
international firm?<br/>
<br/>
I have looked into WWOOF as an option for us - I don&#39;t mind<br/>
relocating.  My twins are too young right now I think but maybe in a<br/>
couple years we can try it and see. :) RV&#39;ing is not really an option<br/>
because I&#39;d be the sole driver with a weak driving leg so the idea of<br/>
staying in a temporary location for a while is appealing... Anyone<br/>
tried something like this?<br/>

&gt; helped in our transition to unschooling - no &quot;well meaning&quot; family and<br/>
&gt; friends questioning our decisions! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And of course the BEST part of our moving to Taiwan is the fact that<br/>
&gt; we now have a little girl we are in the final stages of adopting from<br/>
&gt; Taiwan!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I would share about our experience:o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; We are considering selling it all and living and traveling the country<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wondering if anyone has done this, knows anyone who has done this, has<br/>
&gt; &gt; any thoughts on doing this with 3 kids (5,9,13) all boys, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; working from the computer hubby, dog and cat.??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just thinking right now, but wondering if we are just off our rocker<br/>
&gt; &gt; and isn&#39;t it enough that we unschool?  If we unschool and DH works<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the computer, then why NOT travel?  We cannot afford to keep up<br/>
&gt; &gt; our house though and horses AND travel extensively.  That is why the<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought of just going all out, and getting out.  Something in me sees<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;typical&quot; lifestyle so draining anyway, but I realize that RVing<br/>
&gt; &gt; full time has its own set of demands.  We have done it for vacations<br/>
&gt; &gt; before, so we are aware of that!  I am more concerned with the lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; home--aspects on the kids, the tight quarters, and again, the lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a A home.  Of course home is where the family is, but is that really<br/>
&gt; &gt; how the kids feel?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>

Although in SA he was not teaching (he got his teaching degree and<br/>
taught for a little while), but he was mostly a<br/>

&gt; I have looked into WWOOF as an option for us - I don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; relocating.  My twins are too young right now I think but maybe in a<br/>
&gt; couple years we can try it and see. :) RV&#39;ing is not really an option<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;d be the sole driver with a weak driving leg so the idea of<br/>
&gt; staying in a temporary location for a while is appealing... Anyone<br/>
&gt; tried something like this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262693954">Hi Andrea, <br/>
<br/>
What an exciting adventure you and your family are on. We also full-<br/>
time RV with our 5yo homeschooled daughter from October till April <br/>
each year, and work at our campground, Tall Pines Campground, <br/>
Canoeing & Country Store during the camping season. If you will be <br/>
full-timing you may want to check out the Families On The Road Group, <br/>
most of them RV, but a number of them are like you, either staying in <br/>
hotels or company house. Our campground is close to New Hartford, so <br/>
If you are in the area, stop in and say hi! Also, if you belong to <br/>
FOTR (familiesontheroad.com) we also give a 10% discount if you stay <br/>
with us if you ever do get that RV you&#39;re considering. You can get <br/>
directions to the campground online at www.TallPinesCampground-<br/>
NY.com. <br/>
<br/>
Best of Luck, <br/>
Gayle <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278298699">Gayle that is so cool.  So do you only stay at the campground till the end of April?  I just joined the FOTR group and before we left we sold all of our camping gear so for now I&#39;m thinking we aren&#39;t going to be staying in any campgrounds for a while...I&#39;m not familiar but I think some RV cgrounds do have designated tent areas.  I guess my main concern about RVing it is how do we get and stay connected to the Internet (without spending fortune) and with my husband having to go to the mall to work everyday how often would we find a campground that is really close to a larger town where the malls are located??  Lots of things to consider for us before making that big purchase I guess.<br/>
<br/>
If it were just up to me I&#39;d love to own a campground but his dream is to have a resort.  But that&#39;s a few years from now so you never know.  He&#39;s enjoying me reading to him all the feedback from other travels.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking up your campground now.  How neat!<br/>
