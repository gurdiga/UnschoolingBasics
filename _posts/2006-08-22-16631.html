<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964703304">&quot;I try to remember that this is a phase and I will miss it. Most of<br/>
the time I can, but when it happens a few times an hour all day, I<br/>
have trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is to fill yourself up when he doesn&#39;t need you. Good<br/>
self-care when our children are happily involved in a tv show or fun<br/>
activity is a great way to stay focused on them when they need you. <br/>
Five years old is so very little. They really need a lot of you still,<br/>
especially as the oldest child.<br/>
<br/>
My Jalen has older siblings to play with some of the time, so there is<br/>
quite a bit more &quot;engaged&quot; time where he doesn&#39;t need me...though his<br/>
intense behaviors more than make up for that! <br/>
<br/>
If you can really &quot;fill him up&quot; when he needs you, really BE with him<br/>
and enjoy your time together, maybe that will make it possible for him<br/>
to not feel rushed. If he senses that you don&#39;t really want to be with<br/>
him, it will cause more neediness, not less. Focus on him when you&#39;re<br/>
there in the games, focus on his joy and what he needs. <br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t going to &quot;teach&quot; him problem solving. He&#39;ll learn it as<br/>
he&#39;s ready by having people around him model it and fulfill his very<br/>
real needs. He NEEDS what he&#39;s asking for. It&#39;s not some &quot;negative&quot;<br/>
way to act.<br/>
<br/>
Could it be possible that you&#39;re expecting something more of him just<br/>
because he&#39;s that magical &quot;school age&quot; now? He&#39;s a wee little man that<br/>
needs a lot of his Mum. Giving him what he needs now, is no different<br/>
than responding to our infants cries. He&#39;s communicating needs, you<br/>
have a choice to responds warmly and fully, or being annoyed with it.<br/>
