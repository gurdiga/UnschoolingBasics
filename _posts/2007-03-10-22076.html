<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038356754">Good day!  We are an unschooling family and we are currently in <br/>
Washington.  (We have 4 kiddos; 7 y.o., 5 y.o. twins and 2 y.o.)  We <br/>
are contemplating a move to Hawaii.  Does anyone here know of anyone <br/>
unschooling there?  The wording of their guidelines make it seem like <br/>
we may have some issues there.  I&#39;d love any leads to help me clarify <br/>
this before we make the move.  Thank you ladies and gentleman in <br/>
advance for the help.<br/>
Here is a &#39;link&#39; to the guidelines:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260240392">Yes I do know at least one family who is unschooling in Hawaii. And, it<br/>
really doesn&#39;t look all that difficult - more than WA but not that bad.<br/>
File notice when you get there (but it&#39;s not annual, just once when you<br/>
start); testing OF YOUR CHOICE at grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 (so you can use<br/>
something like PASS which is designed to be done at home however you<br/>
want pretty much, and an annual progress report which can be a written<br/>
evaluation from the parent. So, keeping a journal and then translating<br/>
it once a year would be most of what you need to do most years. In the<br/>
testing years, no written evaluation because of the testing. I suppose<br/>
it may be pretty locally variable so I&#39;d want to touch base with some<br/>
folks there (I&#39;d bet there&#39;s a yahoo group for homeschoolers if not<br/>
unschoolers who could help you with the ropes).<br/>
