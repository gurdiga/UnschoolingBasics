<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623118709">This is my first time posting here, but I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks<br/>
now.  I have teens (mostly schooled because my ex was extremely anti HS,<br/>
though i&#39;ve made a my best effort over the years to counterbalance the<br/>
indoctrination) and two year old twins (already magically and successfully<br/>
unschooling). I can tell more about me later, when its pertinent, but right<br/>
now I have a question about this Age Segregation business.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the board of a brand new non-profit with a mission of building<br/>
intergenearational connections.  From my personal POV, I think its really,<br/>
really sad that we have to manufacture opportunities for the different<br/>
generations to connect. We&#39;re developing programs now in an attempt to do<br/>
just that.  But, what I really, really want is to make those interactions<br/>
easy and natural, rather than forced and contrived.  Our programs will be<br/>
for the whole community, and mostly for schooled children/teens to get<br/>
together with people 40+ who are not authority figures in their lives.  The<br/>
hope is that everyone will learn and grow from these experiences.  You all<br/>
have been watching your children develop these kinds of connections<br/>
naturally...the way I hope we can with our programs.  So, I was wondering if<br/>
you would have any advice or ideas for programs that would encourage the<br/>
truly age segregated folks out there to blur those lines in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

This line caught me: His girlfriend asserted that English classes were important &quot;Just imagine how much worse language would be if we didn&#39;t learn how to use it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cute considering that she was texting and receiving texts from an unschooler. (Presumably Patrick didn&#39;t learn English in school?)  It made me smile.<br/>

<br/>
My two cents is to build the &quot;programs&quot; around common interests -<br/>
chess/checkers; knitting/crocheting; sports of some kind; books; drama;<br/>
dance/music; and so on - even something like Wii bowling is a great<br/>
intergenerational attraction (as evidenced by three generations playing<br/>
at my sister&#39;s house over the holidays). At first, yeah, the kids might<br/>
hang with the kids and the adults with the adults BUT when adult A sees<br/>
kid B really taking off in a chess game or when kid C sees adult D<br/>
whooping up on someone in Wii bowling, things will start to happen.<br/>

******************<br/>
<br/>
You know what&#39;s fascinating to me about this? The statement sounds so detached--like we don&#39;t learn any language skills until we learn it from school or something. Or as if language is this big separate thing, apart from we who use it, static and unchanging, and we have to learn to use it or something. And language changes all the time; we don&#39;t speak english from the middle ages anymore. And spelling only got standardized, what, 150 yrs ago or something. And today&#39;s language is changing because of texting and computer usage--breaking up paragraphs so they are more easily read, getting creative with grammar. The written word is getting more conversational.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine thinking that toddlers had to &quot;learn to use language&quot;? What a mess that would be. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of the things that nobody learns from a book or an expert, we learn from our family or from others and we learn by doing. And if we&#39;re talking about unschooling--learning from living life--language should be the most obvious example of natural learning. Just thought it was so interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554130637">And about language amd how to be abe to utilize it in speach, or reading or written format. These are so divergent araas. And what ift you start out on three &#39;mother tongues&#39; at the same time like my grandchildren? They &#39;speak&#39; in German with me, in English with their parents and in Afrikaans with their other grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
Toddlers do have to &#39;use language&#39; to get by somehow. My youngest granddaughter is quite capable of &#39;sounding&#39; words but she finds it so much more effective to you &#39;ahahah&#39; through her &#39;demands&#39; and use sign language to get herself &#39;heard&#39;. Which she does. I see unschooling as a way to allow these children to be who they are regardless of the demands of society. My youngest, nearly 17 year old son has great difficulty in using the correct &#39;Der, Die, Das&#39; format in German. English is so much asier to use in this regard.
