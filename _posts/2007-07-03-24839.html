son used to be a very mellow, easy going, quick to adapt type kid. <br/>
Lately, I would say in the last several months, he has grown <br/>
painfully shy/reserved. He chews his thumb, opens his mouth as if to <br/>
yawn (but doesn&#39;t), walks behind me, etc. when approached by someone <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know. He has also decided there is a monster in every room <br/>

Any one else out there have shy kids? Or, kids who were once just <br/>
mellow, now turned shy?? DH wants to put him in &quot;social&quot; situations--<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163343470">Hi Darcy,<br/>
   My 4 yo has done a similar change in nature this past year. I was told by someone that it is a natural stage at this age, and to be expected. Even without durastic change going on at home, children of this age go through separation anxiety. I was also reassured that they outgrow it, as I am waiting for, myself.<br/>
   When my son was 2 he was such a social butterfly that I put him in MDO twice a week just to give him consistent playtime with others. He continued that until he reached 4yrs, then asked to stop MDO. He wants nothing more than to hang out with Mom and play with friends at home, so I oblige him. <br/>
   I wish you well, and hope BOTH our kids outgrow this stage fairly soon. Until then, I will just keep him next to me until he&#39;s ready to venture out and explore on his own. Best wishes, Lisa O <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083332890">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
Read this book &quot;Hold on To Your Kids: Why Parents Need To Matter <br/>
More Than Peers&quot; by Gordon Neufeld. The last thing your son needs is <br/>
to be forced to &quot;get over it&quot;. He has better knowledge of what his <br/>
emotional needs are right now than anyone else. Those needs should <br/>
be repected. Making him interact with &quot;strangers&quot; or hug Uncle Harry <br/>
or do any of the things SHY kids shy away from is right up there <br/>
with taking the binky away and painting sour stuff on the thumb. <br/>
Psychotherapy, anyone?<br/>

  ****<br/>
  As a once-shy child (and really at heart, a shy adult) and Mom of two shy children, I can sympathize. IMO, putting (forcing) a child into social situations, things like organized sports, etc in the hopes it will break him out of his shell, is never a good idea.  I remember how terribly painful it was to be thrust in a situation where I had to speak to others, or worse yet, be on the spot to hit the ball, call out the answer, or be the center of anyone&#39;s attention.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Memories of my experiences as a shy child, led me to be very accommodating of my firstborn&#39;s shyness.  He needed to feel confident in a room to know how he fit in.  I could see and understand that.  Once he&#39;s figured out what the room/group expects from him, and how he can meet that situation, he jumps right in and shines.  It just takes more time -- and safety -- than most people want to give to a child.  Forcing him to be in a situation where he had to jump right in, only pushed him farther into himself -- because he didn&#39;t feel safe, and the adults who force him aren&#39;t being trustworthy.  I&#39;ve always felt it&#39;s part of the perfectionist&#39;s package, too -- being shy is the ultimate protection from being found in some way deficient by others.  It&#39;s a protection, to keep you safe until it&#39;s okay to let other people in.  Let him have his safety net.  <br/>

<br/>
This sounds very much like Mo (and me!). I think of it in terms of <br/>
needing to observe people and groups before deciding who and how to <br/>
socialize, rather than confidence, per se, though. Some people <br/>
gather information about people by interacting, others need to <br/>
observe. Asking an &quot;observant learner&quot; to interact right off the bat <br/>
undermines his learning process - its too hard to do both at once - <br/>
so that person will actually develop social skills more slowly. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things *I* noticed, is that once I had discovered this <br/>
about Mo and realized it was a &quot;normal&quot; way to learn about social <br/>
situations it was much easier for me to sit up taller and look <br/>
around with more attention and focus in new situations. One of the <br/>
most damaging aspects of having been pushed to &quot;jump right in&quot; is <br/>
that I had learned to de-value my own learning process. &quot;Shy&quot; to me <br/>
meant &quot;defective&quot; - so I tend to avoid the word now.<br/>
<br/>
Mo often needs time to observe people she knows well after an <br/>
absence, but also if a certain person tends to be temperamental. <br/>
<br/>
One of the truely amazing things about honoring (and where necessary <br/>
actively defending) her obervant-learning process is that often, <br/>
now, she can very quickly asses the overall kid-friendliness of a <br/>
group. Its really striking to see a child who still hides behind me <br/>
in most new locations dive into a group of strangers and strike up a <br/>
conversation after a couple minutes of observation.<br/>

<br/>
  *****<br/>
  As a child, I found refuge in the word shy -- once people heard that I was shy, they pretty much left me to myself, especially when my younger sister became &#39;the outgoing one&#39; in our home.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As a Mom, I offer up shy as an excuse, because it helps to convey that the child isn&#39;t being rude and disrespectful, which seems to make people more comfortable overall.  Again, people seem okay with that. It probably helps that I have one very outgoing child, too, to distract them from the quieter one.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s also that I&#39;m not one to let someone else own or define my words for me, so I take some perverse pleasure in enjoying words meant to indicate defect.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146462121">I&#39;m confident that no one meeting my now teen and adult children could pick <br/>
out which of them was the most reserved at age 4. The child who refused to make <br/>
eye contact with strangers and made a permanent face imprint in the back of <br/>
my thigh is now the most likely to strike up a conversation with someone newly <br/>
met, and is fearless in social situations. We never pushed. We ran <br/>
interference with the critical and the well meaning concerned. We offered situations <br/>
without caring if they were accepted or not. We always left open the possibility <br/>
of change, not declaring the child &quot;shy&quot; but deflecting questioners with a <br/>
simple &quot;oh s/he doesn&#39;t like talking to strangers now.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
A &quot;shy&quot; 4 year old might be a reserved adult, or they might not. They should <br/>
be supported in whatever way they grow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Though my daughter wasn&#39;t shy, she too, like the original poster&#39;s  <br/>
son, wouldn&#39;t go upstairs by herself until she was 11 or 12. She  <br/>
needed me in the bathroom with her. She slept next to our bed until  <br/>
she was 13. Often she had problems staying overnight at other  <br/>
people&#39;s houses and would call for reassurance late at night.<br/>
<br/>
And yet last year just after turning 15 she decided she wanted to go  <br/>
to car design camp in Detroit for 2 weeks. My husband drove her out  <br/>
from Boston and, after an overnight stay, dropped her off. (Google  <br/>
Earth was very comforting in allowing us to see the area, which was  <br/>
actually a very nice area of Detroit. Yes, there are nice areas in  <br/>
Detroit ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not a bit of homesickness. Though she called each night for the first  <br/>
week, after that she called maybe 3 times. (They kept the kids *very*  <br/>
busy from 8-9 with classes that also had homework. She was told that  <br/>
was light compared to what the college was like ;-) And then she flew  <br/>
home all by herself, with a plane change in Philadelphia.<br/>
<br/>
(This is much easier to write than it was to convince ourselves that  <br/>
we needed to not say no! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I really doubt she&#39;d be that confident if we&#39;d pushed her. Kids do  <br/>
well when they can grow in their own time.<br/>

Wow, that would have been so nice.... For my mom, and too many <br/>
others, shy seems to mean &quot;needs to be drawn out&quot;. Exactly the last <br/>
thing I needed!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen both reactions to Mo. Some people say &quot;oh, she&#39;s shy&quot; and <br/>
back off, while others will try to get right up in her face. I&#39;ve <br/>
used variations on the &quot;slow to warm up&quot; line, mostly successfully, <br/>
as a way to get people to back off. Twice I&#39;ve actually had to tell <br/>
an adult to back off - well, I&#39;ve said &quot;that really isn&#39;t helpful&quot; <br/>
while putting my whole body between the adult and Mo. <br/>
<br/>
Actually we were at a party yesterday and I got to see a twist on <br/>
this issue - this is the group of friends who have gotten used to <br/>
seeing Mo be friendly and social, so people were saying &quot;hi&quot; and <br/>
approaching her in a friendly way, but she hadn&#39;t seen most of them <br/>
in more than a month, so she was wanting to take some time and <br/>
observe all over again. I think part of the issue, in this <br/>
particular case, is she was the only kid at the party at that point, <br/>
so *everyone* seemed to know her name and want to say hi, but she <br/>
had over thirty faces and names to remember. So I spent the first <br/>
hour at the party having Mo hide behind me while everyone wanted to <br/>
know &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In a different environment I might have been able to sit with her <br/>
somewhere we could watch the whole group at once for awhile - from <br/>
past experience I know that helps *alot*, but the layout of the <br/>
house and yards didn&#39;t make that feasible. And eventually she was <br/>
able to talk to some people and blow raspberries at others and have <br/>
a good time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701074171">Gosh, I feel a twinge of guilt...something you said reminded me of how when my brother&#39;s new girlfriend came to visit the 1st time (a couple months ago), she let me know she is shy and a bit uncomfortable with babies. Well, instead of taking that as a cue that she has a fear of some kind, I plop my infant son in her lap and tell her that&#39;s the best way to get over it! Ha! How very sensitive of me! The good new is, she now spends her days here doing nothing BUT holding the baby (voluntarily:). <br/>
   <br/>
  I am terribly shy in social situations, but would like to describe it as &#39;overstimulated&#39;. I can&#39;t handle much noise, much interaction with more than 2 people...I shut down. You&#39;ll either see this glazed look in my eye, or sheer panic. I spend a lot of time in the bathroom at social events (even family events), decompressing and trying to center myself. I&#39;ve gotten better at it over the years, thanks to meditation, but I still fear groups of chatty people.<br/>
   <br/>
  I watch my son respond to groups as if he&#39;s overstimulated, too. Alone, or with 1-2 kids, he&#39;s charming, thoughtful, gentle and considerate. But as soon as the number of kids increases, he&#39;s like a spinning top. He doesn&#39;t listen (to me or them), won&#39;t stop annoying games, even when asked by the kids...just goes into a mania, of sorts. When my nieces came to spend a week for Spring Break I was able to observe his behavior in full force for a week solid. I thought he would slow down, or atleast pace himself after a few days, but nope. From the moment he awoke to the time he crashed at night, he was someone else&#39;s rambunctious kid. The day I took the girls to thier Nana&#39;s house and kept him to take back home with me, the second he was buckled in the carseat to drive away, he was his old self again.He was even able to express his need to &#39;be alone&#39; some, too. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; painfully shy/reserved. He chews his thumb, opens his mouth as if to <br/>
&gt; yawn (but doesn&#39;t), walks behind me, etc. when approached by someone <br/>
&gt; he doesn&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it is a developmental thing where he is realizing that the world <br/>
is not just make believe but REAL and real things happen. Also I think <br/>
that kids go through shy and outgoing phases, sort of attachment and <br/>
detachment stuff that instead of pushing them away we should hold them <br/>
close until they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
Has something specific scared him? A movie? a poster? a discussion? Is <br/>
he able to talk about things like that?<br/>
<br/>
I would just let him hang on to you until he is ready to let go. He <br/>
needs you to protect him from whatever it is that is scaring him. If <br/>
you suddenly were like him would you want people pushing you into <br/>
situations that were so obviously painful? Would your husband like to <br/>
be forced into doing something he was scared of.</div>
