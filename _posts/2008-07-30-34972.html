<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216546331">Hello all!!  My name is Amanda, and I am mom to a 10,7,6,5.  I am <br/>
a &#39;newbie&#39; to unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
We decided to unschool only about 9 months ago.  Well, actually, *I* <br/>
decided (my husband is still skeptical) to unschool after a long line <br/>
of difficult public school and hard-core curriculum based <br/>
homeschooling situations. I am moving in this process alot slower <br/>
than I wish to.  I have dealt with everything from trying to get a <br/>
grasp on what unschooling is, feeling the need to explain it to <br/>
others, dealing with ex-in-laws (the oldest is from first marriage) <br/>
questioning and grilling my oldest (10 yrs old) about why he doesn&#39;t <br/>
know what 12x12 or 9x9 is without writing it on paper (yet, they <br/>
could care less that he is running his own business and that he knows <br/>
how to sew), dealing with my own patience and ingrained feelings of <br/>
doubt and what is &#39;suppose&#39; to be happening right now....etc, etc, <br/>
etc.  The thought of just &#39;letting things flow naturally&#39; has been <br/>
hard for me.  I always thought I was a laid back person... since we <br/>
started unschooling, I realized how much of a control freak I have <br/>
been.*sigh*   <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself and say how much I appreciate this <br/>
group and all the helpful tips provided here.  I do understand the <br/>
point of not wallowing in pity and just moving on and figuring out <br/>
how to do better next time.  It&#39;s hard, but absolutely worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Love and peace to all~ Amanda and gang</div>
