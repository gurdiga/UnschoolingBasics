<div id="ygrps-yiv-526170513">I&#39;m looking for resources for my 9 year old boy in the war in Iraq. <br/>
Can anyone here help?  His uncle (my brother) left for Iraq a couple<br/>
days ago and is now in Kuwait waiting to go to Iraq.  He has been<br/>
having LOTS of questions!  While I can help him understand his uncle&#39;s<br/>
specific job better, I&#39;d like to find some balanced information for<br/>
him about the war.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some military families here, so any info would be<br/>
great!  Thanks!<br/>

*personally* feel about the war, it&#39;s unacceptible IMO to tell a child<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have a VFW in your area? It might be interesting for him to <br/>
talk with/interview some of the people who&#39;ve been there, especially <br/>
to get a different perspective from what the news media puts out. My <br/>
husband came back from Fallujah with a very different perspective of <br/>
the situation and people than what I had heard on the news. It&#39;s <br/>
kind of hard to get &quot;balanced&quot; information from any one source so <br/>
getting information from several different sources is important, imo.<br/>

Yes!  That was a good one, too.  They were the first 2 books I read on<br/>
unschooling, and the 2 books that got me hooked!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103265639">The Unschooling Handbook is more about academic unschooling (for lack of a<br/>
better term- I tend to think of this more as unstructured eclectic<br/>
homeschooling).  Parenting a Free Child is much more about whole life<br/>
unschooling- living in freedom and respect.  Both I think would be excellent<br/>
for someone new to the ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35564107">We&#39;ve been unschooling for 24 years. Kids age 27 down to 10. My dh <br/>
teaches geology at the local university and we have read nearly every <br/>
book out there on unschooling. He also is fighting tooth and nail the <br/>
new &quot;assessment&quot; procedures at the University - they want to assess <br/>
everything - grades (which are bad enough in his estimation) - are no <br/>
longer good enough. He is incredibly tired of kids coming into his <br/>
graduate classes and saying &quot;What do I have to do to get an A?? I <br/>
don&#39;t want to have to THINK - just tell me what to do!&quot; His favorite <br/>
book is Rue&#39;s book hands down. I just bought it a month ago! It&#39;s great.<br/>
