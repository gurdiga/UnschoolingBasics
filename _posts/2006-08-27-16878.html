<div id="ygrps-yiv-700436481">Hi Michelle!<br/>
  I think it is a great place. I&#39;ve lived here most of my life. It is a prairie city so it is flat and beautiful ( you have to like wheat fields). The cost of living is pretty good ( compared to our neighboring province Alberta- where everyone moves to). I&#39;d love to tell you more but my kids are requesting my presence upstairs.<br/>
   <br/>
  You don&#39;t happen to know any of the rules regarding reporting for unschooling in Canada do you? We are new to this and completely uninformed.<br/>
   <br/>
  Nice to meet you!<br/>
  Teresa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003937360">Hi again Michelle,<br/>
  I just read your email to my husband and he reminded me that you also have to be comfortable with temperatures between +40 C and -40 c. I&#39;m not sure what that is in F but it is really flipping hot and really flipping cold! But lots of variety!<br/>
