<div id="ygrps-yiv-823061233">Hi!  My name is Robin Clary.  I have been homeschooling for over 10<br/>
years.  I&#39;m 42 yrs. old and the mother of 3 children...two teens and a<br/>
7-year-old.  I am blessed to be a stay-at-home-mom.  Our family lives in<br/>
Newnan, GA, which is in Coweta County.<br/>
<br/>
I am not currently a bona fide unschooler, but feel led to explore<br/>
unschooling for our family.  I do know that the direction of mainstream<br/>
homeschooling (isn&#39;t that a funny phrase!  Ü ) is becoming too much<br/>
work and we are losing the delight we ought to have in learning and in<br/>
each other as a family.<br/>
<br/>
I found this list from the Live Free Learn Free website and wanted to<br/>
explore the unschooling mindset from those who are living it.  All the<br/>
common fears of not doing enough, or missing out on the magical bit of<br/>
knowledge that is essential to success, of course surface from time to<br/>
time, so having the wisdom and support of avid and experienced<br/>
unschoolers will make the journey, or at least the transition, just a<br/>
bit less scary.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to cyber-meeting many of you brave souls.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Robin<br/>
