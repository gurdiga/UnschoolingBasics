<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710019299">The boys&#39; choices in TV viewing continue to pose problems for us.  Or <br/>
maybe it&#39;s our reaction to their choices.  <br/>
<br/>
It started out when Andy found Family Guy and Futurama.  Gary was <br/>
really bothered by the shows, and complained mightily.  I&#39;m also <br/>
personally bothered by those shows and consider them inappropriate <br/>
for kids -- heck, honestly I consider them inappropriate for anyone.  <br/>
They&#39;re crap, INMSHO -- mean-spirited, stupid and not funny, just <br/>
ugly.  <br/>
<br/>
All that said, I supported their right to choose their own TV shows.  <br/>
For me it was a stance about autonomy and trusting our kids.  Okay, <br/>
that was my high-minded argument anyway. Really, on a deeper level -- <br/>
and having read so many people whose kids could choose to watch <br/>
undesirable shows but don&#39;e -- I fully expected that soon the novelty <br/>
would wear off, and my sweet, kind, thoughtful kids would show their <br/>
true colors and watch something else -- anything else!  It&#39;s been <br/>
several months now, and still he loves those shows.  Gary is <br/>
beginning to really question whether I&#39;m right to &#39;let&#39; them watch <br/>
those shows.  He&#39;d really like to ban those shows, but I&#39;m not really <br/>
comfortable -- at least in principle -- with banning anything.  Even <br/>
Will, at 22, thinks I&#39;m wrong to let his younger brothers watch those <br/>
shows.  It&#39;s even harder for me when I agree in principle/theory, but <br/>
in reality their choices are indefensible.<br/>
<br/>
So, on to today.  Earlier tonight, I noticed that the boys were <br/>
really enjoying the dish preview of Boomerang (we don&#39;t subscribe to <br/>
Boomerang -- it&#39;s $20 extra where we live) watching it right thru the <br/>
them they&#39;d normally watch Futurama.  I quietly said to Gary &quot;see, <br/>
when they have Boomerang to watch, they forget all about Futurama, <br/>
and maybe even Family Guy -- maybe we should think about boomerang <br/>
when we can afford it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Just a few moments ago -- as I&#39;m catching up on my DVR&#39;d shows, Andy <br/>
comes out and asks me to set it up to DVR Futurama at midnight.  <br/>
Also, they&#39;d watched Family Guy, just in Andy&#39;s room where we don&#39;t <br/>
have to hear it (that&#39;s at our request, it&#39;s the best compromise we <br/>
could live with, since neither of us is willing to sit thru even one <br/>
episode of Family Guy).  I said I had noticed he missed the earlier <br/>
run of Futurama watching boomerang, and did he really want to watch <br/>
crap when he had other choices?  Of course, he was upset.  I <br/>
apologized for calling it crap, but it was too late.  Both boys know <br/>
how we feel about those shows, and I know no good is served by <br/>
reminding them we disapprove, but I&#39;m just so tired of it all.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my real problem tho -- we&#39;ve both told them what we find <br/>
objectionable about those shows.  Andy will still tell me jokes he <br/>
heard on those shows, or ask me about some storyline he didn&#39;t get, <br/>
and I answer his questions.  I&#39;ll admit I sometimes point out how <br/>
much I dislike the show. Today, after he shared a particularly ugly <br/>
episode, I again explained what made that kind of humor unattractive <br/>
to others -- and unacceptable to his Dad.<br/>
<br/>
I had been really, really hoping they&#39;d move past that trash, but <br/>
they aren&#39;t and the longer it goes on, the harder it is for me to <br/>
defend their right to that choice -- even to myself.<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong here?  What&#39;s wrong with my kids that they like <br/>
those shows and find that humor funny?  What kind of people am I <br/>
raising?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491348161">okay, so after I hit send, Andy and I talked a bit about it.  When I apologized and told him that while I don&#39;t like those shows, and I support the principle that he and Dan can make their own choices, really I&#39;d been expecting that they&#39;d quickly grow past those shows.  He said &quot;it takes kids longer to get tired of that kind of funny -- we think stupid is funny.&quot;  I replied that I understand kids think stupid is funny but that I worry watching that humor will lead to him thinking that kind of behavior is funny and okay in real life.  He answered &quot;I&#39;m smarter than that, Mom.&quot; I pointed out that I know 30 or 40 yo people who still think that kind of thing is funny and I don&#39;t understand that.  That if I knew an adult who found that funny, I&#39;d have to wonder why.&quot;  <br/>
   <br/>
  Just now, he came out and told me &quot;Mom, I think when I&#39;m 15, or maybe 13, I&#39;ll feel that way -- what we talked about.  Maybe then I won&#39;t think it&#39;s funny.&quot;  <br/>
   <br/>
  All I could think is -- by the time he&#39;s 13 or 15, how warped will he already be watching that stuff?<br/>
   <br/>
  I really want to make some peace with this, but I have to say if I were dating a guy and he told me he liked Family Guy -- that would be our last date, because eewww!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655450348">I have a few thoughts about your dilemma.  I hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>
<br/>
First, you know that &quot;what you resist persists,&quot; right?  The <br/>
attention you place on feeling yucky about these shows and your <br/>
obvious contempt for them (whether you have blatant contempt or only <br/>
thinly veiled contempt) is like a giant, lit-up arrow pointing right <br/>
at these shows.  I believe this falls under the <br/>
there&#39;s-no-such-thing-as-bad-publicity category.  All the grousing <br/>
that you and Gary are doing about these shows is not allowing these <br/>
shows to take a smaller role in Andy and Dan&#39;s lives.  Can you see that?<br/>
<br/>
Consider this perhaps:  You have made it plain here through this <br/>
electronic medium that you feel quite judgmental about these shows <br/>
*and* even judgmental about folks who like those shows.  If I&#39;m able <br/>
to pick that feeling up here at my computer, and I&#39;m not even in the <br/>
same room with you, image what vibes Andy and Dan are picking up from <br/>
you and Gary!  Is it possible (and, I&#39;m not saying it is) that the <br/>
personal judgment they may be feeling from you and Gary could be more <br/>
harmful than enjoying stupid humor?  Is it possible that you may be <br/>
inflicting a little shame on them for liking what you feel is not likeable?<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, Liam (my 12-year-old son) really likes those two <br/>
shows.  His life, however, does not revolve around them.  He&#39;s not <br/>
even really willing to stay up to watch them if he&#39;s tired.  But, if <br/>
he has a friend staying over, then they&#39;ll definitely watch the <br/>
shows.  I&#39;ve been invited to watch with him/them, and if I can I <br/>
do.  Or, I might tell him that it&#39;s just not my cup of tea.  But, if <br/>
he wants to tell me about something he found to be funny, I give him <br/>
the attention that I would give anyone who wants to share something <br/>
with me that *they* appreciate.  I give him the same attention that <br/>
*I* would want someone to give me!<br/>
<br/>
I certainly would not want someone to pass judgment about my <br/>
character based on my entertainment preferences!  I would not want to <br/>
defend myself to anyone about them.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of more thoughts:  First, a lot of the raunchier humor in <br/>
those two shows goes right over Liam&#39;s head.  Perhaps it&#39;s that way <br/>
for your sons, too?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I used to really *not* like that show Ed, Edd, and Eddy, but <br/>
Liam really, really liked it.  I kept my feelings *entirely* to <br/>
myself as best I could and I&#39;d watch it with him whenever I <br/>
could.  Sure &#39;nuff, he *detests* the show now!  One of the things <br/>
that I didn&#39;t like about the show was that the personality traits <br/>
some of the characters had were awful!!  But, I could see how Liam <br/>
could hang on to his own good character and still find that show <br/>
funny.  Just because he found the show funny did not mean he was <br/>
going to be like those characters!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important to remember that a TV show really does not have <br/>
the kind of influence on a person&#39;s personality that a person&#39;s peers <br/>
has.  In other words, kids generally are influenced by who they hang <br/>
with most often (which is you, right?).   Andy&#39;s assertion that he is <br/>
&quot;smarter than that&quot; is an important one.  If you can accept that he <br/>
can watch and enjoy really stupid stuff and yet not *be* stupid, you <br/>
can let go of a lot of your fears and judgments.  Then, his decision <br/>
to watch or not watch can be based purely on what he thinks and feels <br/>
and not as a reaction to your reaction.  Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Anywhoo, them&#39;s my thoughts!  I hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Marji (never a big fan of TV anyway, but Liam and I are two entirely <br/>
different people, and he is allowed to be who HE is; he doesn&#39;t have to be me!)<br/>

54 years old, and he thinks they are outlandish.  Does he behave that<br/>
way or live that way?  Of course not!!  He&#39;s an intelligent, very<br/>
sensitive person.  He&#39;s a classical/jazz musician.  He attends a lot<br/>
of spiritual workshops, etc.  But, he likes the writing on those two<br/>
shows and also the Simpsons.  He also likes &quot;crazy&quot; people.<br/>
<br/>
There are some movies that we have seen that he liked and I didn&#39;t<br/>
care for, but that doesn&#39;t make me admire him as a person any less! <br/>
And, he is *not* mysogynistic, racist, or homophobic in any way (if he<br/>
is, he does a great job of keeping it to himself).  He does not speak<br/>
harshly of others or try to cheat people.  I do not believe he would<br/>
enjoy the company of an actual flesh-and-blood person who behaves the<br/>
way they do in FG or Futurama, but he thinks the *shows* are funny.  I<br/>
can see that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This last sentence summarizes what you&#39;re doing wrong.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re *expecting* your kids to be something you picture them as  <br/>
rather than accepting who they are. And you&#39;re being disappointed by  <br/>
their actions. You&#39;re being frustrated that they aren&#39;t molding  <br/>
themselves into your vision of them. You&#39;re telling them why you  <br/>
don&#39;t like those shows and *expecting* that they&#39;ll eventually see  <br/>
why you&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong. I think you&#39;re taking in what  <br/>
they say about the shows but listening only enough to hear whether  <br/>
they&#39;re growing to agree with you. You aren&#39;t *really* listening to  <br/>
them. You aren&#39;t working at understanding why they enjoy the shows.  <br/>
You&#39;re working to get them to see the shows through *your* eyes and  <br/>
aren&#39;t working to see the show through *their* eyes. You wonder why  <br/>
they aren&#39;t changing to your point of view and aren&#39;t even trying to  <br/>
see their point of view. You understand letting kids make their own  <br/>
choices intellectually but it&#39;s come up against reality and your  <br/>
feelings are blocking you from putting it into practice. We have to  <br/>
let them choose even stuff we don&#39;t like!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re *assuming* that because they enjoy a certain type of humor  <br/>
that they want to be like that. What foundation does that fear have?  <br/>
What evidence do you have that watching or even being drawn to a  <br/>
certain interest changes who someone is? Do kids who play video games  <br/>
*become* violent? Or are there two types of kids who may end up  <br/>
playing violent video games: Those who get a thrill from  <br/>
*vicariously* doing what they don&#39;t want to do in real life, and  <br/>
those who are filled with rage because of a horrid home life and want  <br/>
to hurt things? (There&#39;s probably a whole spectrum in between.)<br/>
<br/>
They said that both Boris Karloff and the woman who played the Wicked  <br/>
Witch in Wizard of Oz were very sweet people. I&#39;m a peaceful person  <br/>
and really hate destroying things in real life, but I enjoy the  <br/>
Godzilla and Super Smash Brothers video games and fantasy and science  <br/>
fiction action movies where things get sliced and diced and blown up.<br/>
<br/>
People enjoy lots of stuff through entertainment that they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to experience in real life. I might appreciate the skills of a ninja  <br/>
to kill of a dozen people without a sound, but I wouldn&#39;t want to  <br/>
live a life where that&#39;s probable! I wouldn&#39;t want to go through  <br/>
what&#39;s needed to become someone who could do that. Appreciating  <br/>
something isn&#39;t the same as wanting it for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to watch the shows and give it a truly honest try. I  <br/>
think instead of trying to get them to change their minds you need to  <br/>
find out what it is they enjoy. Talk to them. Ask them what they like  <br/>
and what they don&#39;t like. *Don&#39;t* project their likes into some  <br/>
future warping. There&#39;s no evidence that what we enjoy in  <br/>
entertainment says anything about how we act in society. Far as I  <br/>
know Stephen King doesn&#39;t have dead bodies in his basement ;-) He&#39;s  <br/>
still married to his original wife and has 3 grown kids. *Could* you  <br/>
project that from looking at what he enjoys for entertainment?<br/>
<br/>
It may be that you won&#39;t be able to enjoy the shows for yourself. But  <br/>
it will help build a relationship with them if you work up an  <br/>
appreciation for their appreciation. It may be that those shows will  <br/>
always be liver to you, but your kids wouldn&#39;t want to live in an  <br/>
atmosphere of people always negatively commenting on their choice of  <br/>
liver at a restaurant in order to try to change their minds and think  <br/>
&quot;right&quot;.<br/>

I&#39;m not a big fam of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (Ben&#39;s taking Dunc to see <br/>
that this weekend) or Robot Chicken or Something-Lab-Numbers (Can&#39;t <br/>
remember the name--underwater thing---AquaLab2000??? I can&#39;t remember). <br/>
So I don&#39;t watch them.<br/>
<br/>
I find Futurama smart and sharp---and vaguely reminiscent of the 70s. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; Family Guy too---it has lots of 70s references that I have to <br/>
explain---through the tears. Good thing we have TiVo!<br/>
<br/>
South Park can make me cringe at times, but I do it through the <br/>
laughter. I&#39;m either laughing, cringeing, or sitting there with my <br/>
mouth agape in stunned silence---before I&#39;m laughing again.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of these (plus the Simpsons) have opened up sooooo many avenues for <br/>
deep discussions. Vulgar, yes---but most of that goes over Dunc&#39;s <br/>
head---unless we&#39;re laughing so hard that we have to explain. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Sylvia! Big fans here! Will you still come to the conference? <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, watching these shows will not make them bad people. All four <br/>
of us (five with the girlfriend) have pretty level heads---and none of <br/>
us believe that dogs smoke, drink Martinis, or talk. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

What am I doing wrong here?<br/>

<br/>
Calling it trash, crap, and explaining how bad it is. Thinking that <br/>
there&#39;s something WRONG with your kids (and others) for liking it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  What&#39;s wrong with my kids that they like those shows and find that <br/>
humor funny?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely nothing. Some people hate The Three Stooges&#39; humor. Does <br/>
that make them wrong too? What about David Letterman (I can&#39;t stand to <br/>
be in the room when he&#39;s on)? Woody Allen? Jerry Seinfeld? Adam Sandler <br/>
grates against every nerve I posess. But I *can* see that others do <br/>
find them all funny.<br/>
<br/>
Humor is personal.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really good thing we all didn&#39;t latch on to Tom & Jerry&#39;s humor! <br/>
We&#39;d all be dropping anvils on each others&#39; heads! HAHAHA!<br/>

<br/>
What kind of people am I raising?<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t think of an uglier statement. :-(<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re raising fine young men. (well, the two I know. &lt;g&gt;) And they <br/>
will grow up to be fine men who think Futurama and Family Guy are <br/>
funny---and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking and hoping that they will drop their funny bones because it <br/>
doesn&#39;t jive with yours is horribly sad. Laughter is SOOO <br/>
powerful---even if it&#39;s a bit ...*off*. They won&#39;t *become* Peter or <br/>
Chris or Stewie---any more than you and I have become The Roadrunner <br/>
and Wile E. Coyote!<br/>

with behaviors they have never seen/heard? If, by the time he&#39;s 13 or<br/>
whatever and he chooses not to watch that anymore, will he really be<br/>
&quot;warped&quot; by it or will he have had his fill of farts and burps and butt<br/>
cracks and moved on?<br/>
 <br/>
I remember when DS started watching Spongebob. I sat and watched one or<br/>
two episodes and REALLY disliked it - it was lots of put-downs,<br/>
sarcastic &quot;humor&quot;, rude behavior. Some episodes were even kind of<br/>
&#39;dark&#39;. I let DS know that my choice was to just go someplace else while<br/>
he watched that because ... and I pointed out specific issues I had with<br/>
it. Then I dropped it. When it came on, I&#39;d quietly just &#39;drift&#39; off to<br/>
someplace else - read a magazine in the next room or whatever. Same<br/>
thing I&#39;d do if DH wanted to watch a somewhat scary movie. My choice to<br/>
leave or not, their choice to watch or not. There are times when DS<br/>
chooses to watch something I dislike. Other times, he&#39;d rather find a<br/>
compromise something in the moment, knowing he can watch whatever it is<br/>
later sometime, when I&#39;m at work or doing dishes or whatever. Over time,<br/>
however, he hasn&#39;t picked up any of the negative stuff. He&#39;s all about<br/>
the relationships and the funny stuff. <br/>
 <br/>
I agree with your DS - he probably is lots smarter than you&#39;re giving<br/>
him credit for. And, too, what IF he did continue on to think that it<br/>
was funny when he was 20 or 30 or 40 years old? There -are- other adults<br/>
out there who -also- would think it was funny (there are adults who<br/>
write these shows after all). Just because -you- wouldn&#39;t date him<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t a bunch of others his age who would love to<br/>
date a guy who loves the same shows, has the same memories of watching<br/>
certain shows, that they have. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281717811">But, if he wants to tell me about something he found to be funny, I give him the attention that I would give anyone who wants to share something with me that *they* appreciate. I give him the same attention that *I* would want someone to give me!<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I do listen, and we talk about why such a joke/story would be funny -- the context behind the joke and so on.  Gary won&#39;t listen at all, so Andy doesn&#39;t even try to share that with him anymore.  I figure, even when I don&#39;t like the humor, I want to know what Andy is getting from what he watches and to better understand what he&#39;s thinking.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And I really want to find some way to be comfortable with this.  I&#39;m not naive enough to think this will be the last time Andy will choose something we don&#39;t understand or like.  Hey, I have a limewire download file filled with band names like Goatwhore and Eyehategod -- stuff Will downloads -- so I know my kids aren&#39;t always going to make the same choices I do. &lt;g&gt;  I just want to reach some level where it&#39;s less stressful for me to know what they&#39;re choosing.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
I certainly would not want someone to pass judgment about my character based on my entertainment preferences! I would not want to defend myself to anyone about them.<br/>
<br/>
  ******<br/>
  I know it&#39;s my junk and I really would like to get to the point where I don&#39;t feel so judgmental about it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Something even harder for me to understand happened later with Andy.  He came in and told me about the ending of a Duck Dodgers cartoon he&#39;d watched where the villain/opponent (I&#39;m not sure what to call the little boy) had come in and stolen all of Duck&#39;s food/dinner, as the show ended.  That was to be end gag, I guess and probably considered funny by the viewers.  At first Andy shared it as if it were funny, but within minutes he was crying - yes, actually crying -- at how sad it was that Duck now had no food, and why had that little boy been so mean?  But he finds it hilarious when Stewie is inside an exercise ball painted black, rolling around bumping into things?  Okay, what&#39;s going on here -- starving cartoon ducks are sad, but cartoon babies bouncing around like a blind pinball is funny?  Help me out here....<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  A couple of more thoughts: First, a lot of the raunchier humor in those two shows goes right over Liam&#39;s head. Perhaps it&#39;s that way for your sons, too?<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  I&#39;m sure it goes over Dan&#39;s head, but Andy tells the jokes and laughs -- he very obviously finds it funny.  I usually explain context to help him understand why others might not find it funny, or even find it offensive.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
Also, I used to really *not* like that show Ed, Edd, and Eddy, but liam really, really liked it. I kept my feelings *entirely* to myself as best I could and I&#39;d watch it with him whenever I <br/>
could. Sure &#39;nuff, he *detests* the show now! One of the things that I didn&#39;t like about the show was that the personality traits some of the characters had were awful!! But, I could see how Liam could hang on to his own good character and still find that show funny. Just because he found the show funny did not mean he was going to be like those characters!<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I&#39;m not crazy about the Eds myself -- but they can be pretty funny at times, and totally not as mean-spirited as Family Guy.  Both boys love the Eds and I&#39;m okay with that.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  <br/>
It&#39;s really important to remember that a TV show really does not have the kind of influence on a person&#39;s personality that a person&#39;s peers has. In other words, kids generally are influenced by who they hang with most often (which is you, right?). Andy&#39;s assertion that he is &quot;smarter than that&quot; is an important one. If you can accept that he can watch and enjoy really stupid stuff and yet not *be* stupid, you can let go of a lot of your fears and  judgments. Then, his decision to watch or not watch can be based purely on what he thinks and feels and not as a reaction to your reaction. Know what I mean?<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I don&#39;t really worry as much about its influence as I&#39;m perplexed by why he finds it funny.  And, for the record, I don&#39;t mind that it&#39;s stupid -- but I&#39;m really uncomfortable with how mean-spirited the show is.  And on some level, if a person finds that funny, I have to wonder how &#39;safe&#39; that person is to me, given my own sensitivities.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Lots more to think about tho.... off to read more replies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918341623">And, he is *not* mysogynistic, racist, or homophobic in any way (if he is, he does a great job of keeping it to himself). He does not speak harshly of others or try to cheat people. I do not believe he would enjoy the company of an actual flesh-and-blood person who behaves the way they do in FG or Futurama, but he thinks the *shows* are funny. I can see that.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
   <br/>
  And that sums up my confusion about those shows -- how can one find that funny and not be mysognisitc, racist and homophobic?  Really an honest question -- how?  It&#39;s what I keep coming back to, and I&#39;m not sure how to get past that perception on my part. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759906661">You&#39;re *expecting* your kids to be something you picture them as rather than accepting who they are. And you&#39;re being disappointed by their actions. You&#39;re being frustrated that they aren&#39;t molding themselves into your vision of them. You&#39;re telling them why you <br/>
don&#39;t like those shows and *expecting* that they&#39;ll eventually see why you&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong. I think you&#39;re taking in what they say about the shows but listening only enough to hear whether they&#39;re growing to agree with you.<br/>
   <br/>
  ***<br/>
  Oh, I know this is what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;m channelling my Mom at those moments, except that she did ban anything she found unacceptable.  And I really want to get past this, but it&#39;s proving really hard for me, on a very personal and scary level.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Also, before I go on, I really do appreciate what you have to say -- that&#39;s why I posted this here, because I wanted to hear from you and Ren and Kelly -- other Moms who won&#39;t let me get away with anything.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  You aren&#39;t *really* listening to them. You aren&#39;t working at understanding why they enjoy the shows. You&#39;re working to get them to see the shows through *your* eyes and aren&#39;t working to see the show through *their* eyes. You wonder why they aren&#39;t changing to your point of view and aren&#39;t even trying to see their point of view. You understand letting kids make their own choices intellectually but it&#39;s come up against reality and your feelings are blocking you from putting it into practice. We have to let them choose even stuff we don&#39;t like!<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I agree with the principle of them choosing to watch/hear/see stuff we don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s in reality in my house that&#39;s uncomfortable, and scares me.  When even Will -- who has some out there tastes -- tells me Andy is too young to watch those shows and looks at me like I&#39;m out of my mind that I wonder.  When even my 22yo son thinks his younger brother is too young for it, am I still right or have I gone too far in &#39;letting&#39; the boys choose for themselves?  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
You&#39;re *assuming* that because they enjoy a certain type of humor that they want to be like that. What foundation does that fear have? What evidence do you have that watching or even being drawn to a certain interest changes who someone is? Do kids who play video games *become* violent? Or are there two types of kids who may end up playing violent video games: Those who get a thrill from *vicariously* doing what they don&#39;t want to do in real life, and those who are filled with rage because of a horrid home life and want to hurt things? (There&#39;s probably a whole spectrum in between.)<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  hhmmm.... I don&#39;t really believe that violent video games lead to violence, but for some reason the TV thing is harder for me to tease out.  What fear do I have?  I need to sit with that one for a while.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
People enjoy lots of stuff through entertainment that they don&#39;t want to experience in real life. I might appreciate the skills of a ninja to kill of a dozen people without a sound, but I wouldn&#39;t want to live a life where that&#39;s probable! I wouldn&#39;t want to go through what&#39;s needed to become someone who could do that. Appreciating something isn&#39;t the same as wanting it for yourself.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I can see this -- when you explain it, but when my kids try to defend the same principle, it scares me. <br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
I think you need to watch the shows and give it a truly honest try. I think instead of trying to get them to change their minds you need to find out what it is they enjoy. Talk to them. Ask them what they like and what they don&#39;t like. *Don&#39;t* project their likes into some future warping. There&#39;s no evidence that what we enjoy in entertainment says anything about how we act in society. Far as I know Stephen King doesn&#39;t have dead bodies in his basement ;-) He&#39;s still married to his original wife and has 3 grown kids. *Could* you project that from looking at what he enjoys for entertainment?<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I&#39;ve watched the shows several times -- I just can&#39;t sit thru it anymore.  I know when I watched Andy was hoping I&#39;d enoy it, but I just can&#39;t pretend I like it.  He&#39;s just as fervently hoping his influence will affect me as I am hoping mine will influence him -- and I&#39;m just not able to meet him halfway on this one.  Not yet anyway.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
It may be that you won&#39;t be able to enjoy the shows for yourself. But it will help build a relationship with them if you work up an appreciation for their appreciation. It may be that those shows will always be liver to you, but your kids wouldn&#39;t want to live in an atmosphere of people always negatively commenting on their choice of liver at a restaurant in order to try to change their minds and think &quot;right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  I can see the argument you&#39;re making, but this is way more disgusting than even liver to me &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190082592">I replied that I understand kids think stupid is funny but that I worry watching that <br/>
humor will lead to him thinking that kind of behavior is funny and okay in real life. ***<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you REALLY???<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  Yeah I do.  Even knowing I&#39;m probably wrong.  It&#39;s just a very visceral thing -- and frightening for me.  I just said to Gary how Will is the finished project (who listens to Cannibal Corpse ::shudder:: and we didn&#39;t even let him watch the Simpsons!  I really do wonder what damage I&#39;m allowing to Andy.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I know on a rational level I&#39;m probably very wrong, but on a personal, in-my-head level, yeah, it&#39;s does worry me.  Add in Andy&#39;s tendency to share every thought he ever had with anyone who stands still long enough to hear him, and I worry about the day he says something that really offends someone.  Not because I really care what that someone would think, but what would their reaction be, and how hurt would Andy be?  You know Andy, Kelly, he&#39;s such a tender soul and so clueless at times -- I&#39;m having a really hard time reconciling all this.<br/>
  <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*** He answered &quot;I&#39;m smarter than that, Mom.&quot; ***<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
  yeah, I know he&#39;s smarter than that -- and my Mom&#39;s programming in me says that a his Mom I have a right to expect/demand that he BE smarter than that.  God, I hate it when she moves into my head!<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
- - - - - - - -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 46 and think that Stewie and Brian are a HOOT.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Okay -- then help me understand my issue with this.  I just knew, as I typed those words, that someone I really like here would turn out to be a fan of Family Guy.  And it helps me to hear that, because you&#39;re not at all warped -- at least not in a bad way.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
   <br/>
  I guess the show must have some redeeming value, but the issues that swirl around it still really worry me, that I&#39;m making a mistake as his Mom.<br/>
  <br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s being more mature than you are a this point: he&#39;s trying to make *you* feel good about your position. He&#39;s going out of his way to let you know your feelings are validated and heard.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, I already know I&#39;m not always as mature as I could be.  The question for me is how do I get that mature, when it goes against every prejudice I was raised with?<br/>
   <br/>
  **** All I could think is -- by the time he&#39;s 13 or 15, how warped will he already<br/>
be watching that stuff?***<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Warped enough to hang out at my house. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  ******<br/>
I&#39;m feeling much better and much less &#39;high-stakes&#39; worried about it, just knowing the Lovejoys watch Family Guy.  I know it&#39;s old programming in my head and I want to get past it, but really I just want to snap my heels together and make it go away.... &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
***I really want to make some peace with this, but I have to say if I were dating<br/>
a guy and he told me he liked Family Guy -- that would be our last date, because<br/>
eewww!****<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron will be hurt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Honestly -- if Gary had told me that, I&#39;d have still gone out with him.  I just would have mortified if anyone else knew he liked that show. &lt;beg&gt;  <br/>
   <br/>
  ******<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fam of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (Ben&#39;s taking Dunc to see that this weekend) or Robot Chicken or Something-Lab- Numbers (Can&#39;t remember the name--underwater thing---AquaLab2000 ??? I can&#39;t remember). So I don&#39;t watch them.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  Andy expressed an interest in seeing this movie.  I didn&#39;t even know he watched that show and haven&#39;t watched it myself, but did make a note to check it out and let him know if we could see the movie.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  ALL of these (plus the Simpsons) have opened up sooooo many avenues for deep discussions. Vulgar, yes---but most of that goes over Dunc&#39;s head---unless we&#39;re laughing so hard that we have to explain. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Sylvia! Big fans here! Will you still come to the conference? <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, watching these shows will not make them bad people. All four of us (five with the girlfriend) have pretty level heads---and none of us believe that dogs smoke, drink Martinis, or talk. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Of course, we&#39;ll still come to the conference -- I love y&#39;all.  And finding out you like those shows makes me feel less worried about it all.  But I have to ask how is y&#39;all are so warped and I never knew it? &lt;beg&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571423400">Absolutely nothing. Some people hate The Three Stooges&#39; humor. Does that make them wrong too? What about David Letterman (I can&#39;t stand to be in the room when he&#39;s on)? Woody Allen? Jerry Seinfeld? Adam Sandler grates against every nerve I posess. But I *can* see that others do find them all funny.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I&#39;m with ya right there -- I hate the Stooges, can&#39;t watch Letterman, never found Woody funny, and yeah, Adam Sandler is beyond grating.  And I can see why folks find them funny.  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
What kind of people am I raising?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of an uglier statement. :-(<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re raising fine young men. (well, the two I know. &lt;g&gt;) And they <br/>
will grow up to be fine men who think Futurama and Family Guy are <br/>
funny---and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  I don&#39;t really feel that way, but it&#39;s the question that runs thru my head -- the majorette of my fear parade as a Mom.  I know they&#39;re find people -- even Will whom you don&#39;t know, who has been a Hendrix fan (something else I can&#39;t listen to) since he could speak (it must be genetic, since his bio-dad loves Jimi, too).  I&#39;ve been down this road before, but with controls last time, so this feels really scary at times -- especially this really, long, hard week.  <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
Thinking and hoping that they will drop their funny bones because it doesn&#39;t jive with yours is horribly sad. Laughter is SOOO powerful---even if it&#39;s a bit ...*off*. They won&#39;t *become* Peter or Chris or Stewie---any more than you and I have become The Roadrunner <br/>
and Wile E. Coyote!<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  I know it&#39;s sad.  and wrong. and unfair to them. and makes me feel like a bad mommy.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m really trying to trudge thru to the other side of this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992147852">~~It started out when Andy found Family Guy and Futurama.  Gary was <br/>
really bothered by the shows, and complained mightily.  I&#39;m also <br/>
personally bothered by those shows and consider them inappropriate <br/>
for kids -- heck, honestly I consider them inappropriate for anyone.  <br/>
They&#39;re crap, INMSHO -- mean-spirited, stupid and not funny, just <br/>
ugly.  ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WOW! I have to say I&#39;m shocked by all that judgement about some of the<br/>
BEST television writing available today. <br/>
<br/>
Sure, some people won&#39;t find that kind of humor agreeable....but DANG,<br/>
can&#39;t you see the utter brilliance in those shows??? They touch on<br/>
every topic available, make fun of every political and social issue<br/>
and open the doors for GREAT conversations about history, politics,<br/>
religion, social issues, pop culture, geography, etc..... Total<br/>
brilliance!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to help you get over your harsh judgement of your<br/>
children&#39;s choices, but I CAN tell you about my own children who watch<br/>
those shows almost every week. They are thoughtful, caring, FUNNY,<br/>
interesting and kind people who find those shows hilarious. Television<br/>
shows don&#39;t dictate what kind of person you are, or are becoming.<br/>
Don&#39;t give them that much credit.:)<br/>
<br/>
I love watching those shows with them! What kind of person does that<br/>
make me? I wish I could record some of our post-Futurama, post-Family<br/>
Guy viewing conversations. It&#39;s amazing what connections lead to when<br/>
you truly support your children&#39;s choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004360866">Some episodes were even kind of &#39;dark&#39;. I let DS know that my choice was to just go someplace else while he watched that because ... and I pointed out specific issues I had with it. Then I dropped it. When it came on, I&#39;d quietly just &#39;drift&#39; off to someplace else - read a magazine in the next room or whatever. Same thing I&#39;d do if DH wanted to watch a somewhat scary movie. My choice to leave or not, their choice to watch or not.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  This is where it gets hard for me.  I can totally choose not to watch the show, and if I never have to hear about it, I can be okay with him choosing what he watches, even stuff I don&#39;t like.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s that, after he watches it, he wants to share it with me.  I want to hear what he thinks and know what he loves and be part of his world, but I&#39;m having hard time that it&#39;s a piece I just can&#39;t like.  I have told him it&#39;s okay to share with me, because I want to know where he&#39;s coming from, but when I hear it, I find I&#39;m not able to be as objective as he deserves.  <br/>

physical comedy - but I was surprised to discover she hates the show <br/>
Lilo and Stitch. Before we had satellite she loved the movies and we <br/>
both thought she&#39;d really enjoy the show, but she doesn&#39;t. There are <br/>
just too many scenes of other kids being nasty to Lilo. She loves <br/>
the gross bits with Stitch sticking his tongue up his nose (bleh, I <br/>
can&#39;t believe I just typed that) but the meanness in the show is too <br/>
much for her. In shows like Ed, Edd and Eddy everyone is equally <br/>
unpleasant in his own way and nastiness is always part of the humor, <br/>
and Mo&#39;s totally comfortable with that. Even though its the same <br/>
sort of schoolyard bully cruelty she objects to in Lilo.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m facinated by this. She&#39;s picked up on the different genres of <br/>
humor and understands them in a way I don&#39;t. I&#39;m *just* as <br/>
uncomfortable with the nastiness in either show. As long as I can <br/>
stay focussed on the idea of different genres and different kind of <br/>
understanding I&#39;m not concerned with Mo enjoying physical comedy. <br/>
There&#39;s not something &quot;wrong&quot; with her for liking it. It may not be <br/>
something she grows out of. It may be that she understands this <br/>
subject better than I do and will continue to do so.<br/>

<br/>
Because it&#39;s ENTERTAINMENT, not reality. People are truly smart enough<br/>
to know the difference. And in the two shows you listed, they are<br/>
making fun of people that ARE racist or homophobic, not glorifying it.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to find those shows brilliant and I&#39;m none of the above. It&#39;s<br/>
hilarious to me. But I come from a mixed race family, believe strongly<br/>
in marriage rights for all, don&#39;t understand homophobes, and think<br/>
women are the superior gender (ok, just kidding on that one, we all<br/>
have our strengths, even men...wink, wink). Apparently I can laugh at<br/>

Until you can be who you want to be in this situation, try <br/>
*pretending* you can be that way.  Try doing that for the peace and <br/>
well-being of Andy, who just has a different sense of humor than you <br/>
do.  And, now you know that lots of amazingly wonderful people who <br/>
are intelligent, sensitive, cool, creative folks have that sense of <br/>
humor, too.  Think of this *pretending* as a gift you can give to him.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066248781">Sylvia, I see you&#39;re really struggling with the kids wanting to watch tv  <br/>
shows that you consider &quot;crap.&quot; You&#39;re concerned that when they&#39;re 15 they&#39;ll  <br/>
turn into little Beavis and Buttheads.  <br/>
 <br/>
Honey, lighten up. It&#39;s just a cartoon.<br/>
 <br/>
I could argue the merits of the particular shows you mention, but it&#39;s not  <br/>
going to matter to you. I don&#39;t know how old your kids are, but they find the  <br/>
humor in those shows not because there&#39;s something wrong with them or because  <br/>
you have failed them in some way, but because A. they&#39;re funny (Really, <br/>
lighten  up. Try to pay attention and you&#39;ll see that they can be funny.) and B. <br/>
Because  they&#39;re  little boys and little boys (and little girls and big boys and <br/>
 girls) find stupid stuff funny.<br/>
 <br/>
Sylvia, you&#39;ve met my wife Beth. She is sweet, kind, smart, mature, etc.  And <br/>
when a local radio DJ named Joanne Doody says her name Beth giggles  <br/>
uncontrollably.  Doesn&#39;t make her a bad person, just maybe a little  strange. <br/>
Forty-two year old professional women aren&#39;t supposed to giggle when  someone says <br/>
&quot;doody.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Take solace in that they ALSO like the Boomerang stuff. Stop calling their  <br/>
shows crap. It&#39;s mean. In a lot of ways it&#39;d be better to just not let them  <br/>
watch it than to say they have the choice and then to demean them about  it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210373474">Did I miss the age of your boys?  I have 2 boys (ages 7 and my youngest<br/>
turned 5 yesterday  &lt;bwg&gt;)  They have watched Family Guy (once or twice - I<br/>
don&#39;t limit it, they just aren&#39;t that interested in it at this point) but<br/>
not Futurama and they LOVE the Simpsons.  I have spent time in the past<br/>
worrying about letting them watch the Simpsons (they didn&#39;t know what it was<br/>
and I never introduced it to them.. they had the video game but didn&#39;t know<br/>
it was a tv show).  One day I asked them if they wanted to watch the<br/>
Simpsons on tv and, of coure, that was met with a resoundng yes.  They love<br/>
it and we do to and can&#39;t wait for the movie to come out!  I think, for me,<br/>
the worry came from past experiences.  My sisters watched the Simpsons and<br/>
they had some rough times as adults (drug use and alcoholism) so we think of<br/>
all the &quot;bad&quot; influences they had when in reality they were, honestly,<br/>
parented very poorly.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
I think what Ren said earlier is so key to this... Television shows don&#39;t<br/>
dictate what kind of person you are, or are becoming.  Don&#39;t give them that<br/>
much credit<br/>
<br/>
I like that quote so much I may have to use it as my signature line<br/>
sometime! (if thats okay with you, Ren)<br/>

  maybe it&#39;s about control -- only we all know I have no control issues at all. &lt;weg&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s more about my sense of what&#39;s appropriate, and what others may think about me -- in spite of the fact that I like to think I don&#39;t care what others think.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thinking on it more -- I have my own guilty pleasures in comedy.  I love Christopher Titus, tho I cringe whenever I watch his routine.  I find Earl screamingly funny -- Andy does, too -- even tho it&#39;s very politically incorrect in so many ways.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And, somehow, the whole issue of animation enters into it all, especially for Gary who&#39;s something of a animation snob.<br/>
