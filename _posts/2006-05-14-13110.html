<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827350372">I&#39;m a newbie to this list, been here just under two months, and I am <br/>
learning SO MUCH!  And I&#39;m applying things learned here to my life and <br/>
I&#39;m enjoying my kid&#39;s so much more!!  I&#39;m glad this isn&#39;t a traditional <br/>
&quot;support&quot; list.  I need someone to challenge my actions and my way of <br/>
thinking.  I&#39;m SO EXCITED about unschooling my boys (almost 5 and <br/>
17mo).  I so wish I had found this list when I was pressured into <br/>
putting my oldest in preschool.  I had to fight with Jared every school <br/>
morning to get him to go.  After I found this list, I was able to <br/>
justify why I should take him out of preschool and I did it!  He hated <br/>
it, it wasn&#39;t a good fit for him (he&#39;s very spirited, very active, and <br/>
sitting at tables just does not work for him), he&#39;s a night owl and I <br/>
could barely get him up in the mornings to go.  So now, he&#39;s home and <br/>
it&#39;s tougher for me, but I&#39;m learning to enjoy him and what HE enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
So, a big THANK YOU to the list owners for this list and challenging me <br/>
on a daily basis to live my life joyfully!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question:  My oldest son, Jared, is a night owl like me.  My <br/>
DH is an early to bed, early to rise kind of guy.  My second son is more <br/>
like my DH.  He likes to get up early.  So, the past couple of nights <br/>
Jared and I have been up really late (much later than normal), past <br/>
midnight.  I don&#39;t have a problem with it, but my DH does.  Jared has <br/>
*always* been like this, from the day he was born, so it&#39;s nothing new <br/>
around here.  Of course, the other guys my DH works with have kids that <br/>
were Ferberized and go to bed at 7pm every night.  Well, that approach <br/>
didn&#39;t fly in this house and it never will.<br/>
<br/>
So, the other night I was working late, Jared was up with me and at <br/>
12:30am he finally said to me, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s time to go to bed.&quot; (We all <br/>
sleep in the same room.  Jared sleeps in a crib sidecarred to our bed, <br/>
and Chase sleeps in bed with us since he still nurses at night).  So, I <br/>
was tired too, so we closed up shop and headed to bed.  Jared is loud <br/>
(talks loud, walks loud, even though he&#39;s barely 30lbs).  I reminded <br/>
Jared to be quiet and not wake up Daddy and Chase, but Daddy woke up <br/>
anyway and looked at me and said angrily, &quot;It&#39;s 12:30, why is he still <br/>
up?!!&quot;  I said, we&#39;re going to bed now. So, DH starts up on his, &quot;he&#39;s <br/>
hyped up on sugar,&quot; rant.  Well, no, he wasn&#39;t hyped up on sugar, and I <br/>
told him so.  I said,&quot;He&#39;s not like you, he&#39;s a night owl like me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, how do I respond respectfully to my DH without biting his head off, <br/>
like I&#39;d like to do, and I sometimes do?  I&#39;ve sent him links on <br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;ve sent him the links to Sandra Dodd&#39;s page, Joyce&#39;s <br/>
page, the unschooling discussion board and links to some other <br/>
articles.  I know he said what he did out of frustration, out of being <br/>
awakened by a loud child, rather than me carrying an asleep child to <br/>
bed.  This has been an ongoing struggle with us.  Sure, I&#39;d like for <br/>
Jared to go to bed earlier than his normal 10:30 ~ 11pm, but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve made peace with it.  My DH doesn&#39;t bother to help with <br/>
any kind of &quot;bedtime routine,&quot; and the only time I can get my paid work <br/>
done is when Chase is sleeping, so I can&#39;t help Jared slow down at <br/>
night.  He&#39;s just one of those kids who talks from the time he wakes in <br/>
the morning till the minute he drops off to sleep.  If we make him go to <br/>
bed before he&#39;s ready, lie down with him until he falls asleep, then he <br/>
tosses/turns/talks until he drops off (which usually ends up being <br/>
around 10:30 pm anyway).<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>

<br/>
Sounds a lot like our home!! Except now we&#39;re ALL night owls except<br/>
dh. He knows he&#39;s outnumbered so he doesn&#39;t bug us about it anymore.:)<br/>
<br/>
Can you snuggle up with him when he&#39;s sleepy and wait until he&#39;s<br/>
almost totally out before taking him in the room? That way you&#39;re both<br/>
going to sleep when you&#39;re tired, but not waking dh when entering the<br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
I held Jalen on my lap while watching a movie last night and when he<br/>
got droopy eyed, I just made sure he was comfy and he fell asleep in<br/>
my arms. 12:30 am isn&#39;t so late!! Not around here anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got teens that stay up all night lotsa times, so we definitely<br/>

he does it in the morning than at 9 at night!<br/>
<br/>
But I also realize that when they hit puberty (and my son hasn&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535393359">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s normally what happens.  Jared snuggles up on the couch near my <br/>
computer, tells me he&#39;s cold and wants a blanket, and then BAM, he&#39;s <br/>
out!  But for some reason that night he just wanted to go to bed.  This <br/>
is just one example of how DH and I differ on the kids.  Jared is also a <br/>
computer and gaming freak (in a good way) at 5.  My DH made him into one <br/>
(we both have our own computers, I demanded DH build one for Jared when <br/>
he was 18mo because he was constantly on mine ~ lol), and he also <br/>
insisted we get a Playstation 2 for him for Christmas when I asked to <br/>
get him a V-Smile.  Now DH complains because Jared spends all of his <br/>
time either on his Playstation or on his computer playing games.  <br/>
Jared&#39;s obviously learning lots from these games, and he&#39;s also starting <br/>
to get his fill as I can entice him outside now, where before he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned from this list to just let him play his games and not get <br/>
uptight about it.  I&#39;ll tell Jared that I&#39;m taking Chase outside and he <br/>
can come if he wants.  He just says, &quot;Okay,&quot; and then in about 10 <br/>
minutes he&#39;s coming out the door to play a little outside.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and DH&#39;s passions keep him on the computer all the time too, so I <br/>
just find it ironic that he gets upset about Jared being on the computer <br/>
so much ~ lol<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I think I&#39;m turning this message into more than it was supposed to <br/>
be about.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501441684">My ds (15) has always been more of a night owl.  Right now his usual pattern <br/>
of sleep is he stays up till at least midnight, usually 2 or 3 am. He then <br/>
sleeps anywhere till 11 am or 1pm.  Yes, it took a while for the light to go <br/>
off in my brain, have a moment of clarity & realize he was a night owl and <br/>
not insist he go to bed when everyone else did ;)   It didn&#39;t make him go to <br/>
sleep any earlier, we just had a grumpy gus in the morning due to lack of <br/>
sleep. His sleep pattern changed a couple of years ago when I let go of the <br/>
control.  I do my best work at night & so does he.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I have a ds (16) who is asleep by 10 or so and awake at <br/>
7am. Some kids need more sleep than others, my dd (10) is happy with 6 hours <br/>
sleep.<br/>

I&#39;m so glad!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 I so wish I had found this list when I was pressured into<br/>
putting my oldest in preschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve NEVER heard *anyone* say that she wished she had waited to find <br/>
unschooling! &lt;bwg&gt; I wish I&#39;d found it before I&#39;d sent my older son to <br/>
eight  years of private school!<br/>
<br/>

So, a big THANK YOU to the list owners for this list and challenging me<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re welcome---and thank YOU for saying so.<br/>

Here&#39;s my question:<br/>
Now, how do I respond respectfully to my DH without biting his head <br/>
off,<br/>
like I&#39;d like to do, and I sometimes do?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Breathe deeply! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, try talking when he&#39;s NOT just been awakened. Ask how he would <br/>
feel if *made* to stay up all night and *made* to stay in bed until <br/>
noon. People are just different, and he shouldn&#39;t expect everyone to be <br/>
like him.<br/>
<br/>
Ask EXACTLY what it is he dislikes about it. You might be able to <br/>
counter specific objections rather than an overall objection.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, we can give you some &quot;ammo&quot; for specifics! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Something I&#39;ve wondered about for ages -- this idea that teens all<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it certainly IS an individual thing. But it seems that *most* <br/>
teens DO change their clocks to more of a night owl schedule somewhere <br/>
around puberty. Someone speculated on another list a couple of weeks <br/>
ago that maybe teens were the ones who had &quot;guard duty&quot; eons ago! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I saw it first hand with my now 18 year old. He was an <br/>
up-with-the-dawn kid up until puberty.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he estimates how much rest he may need for the following day&#39;s <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My son and I are both morning people.  I can&#39;t remember not being<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve fluctuated throughout my life. Sometimes up really, really <br/>
early---like now, at 6:00am. Sometimes staying up late---&#39;til 2-3:00 <br/>
and sleeping until noon.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (18), even as a newborn, would wake at 7:00, eat, go back to <br/>
nap from 9-11:00. Wake up, eat, play, back down for a nap from 1-4:00. <br/>
Wake, eat, play, go back to bed at 7:00pm and sleep straight through <br/>
except to roll over to nurse until 7:00am. Like clockwork---two naps <br/>
(totalling 5 hours!) and a 12 hour night every day! He still needs a <br/>
minimum of 10 hours every night---often taking an afternoon nap. Duncan <br/>
(10) has always needed less sleep. He can already get by with 8-9 <br/>
hours/day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But I also realize that when they hit puberty (and my son hasn&#39;t<br/>
yet), bodies go through big changes, and the sleep need generally<br/>
increases.  For those with teens, have you seen changes in sleep<br/>
patterns?  Particularly if you have/had a morning person kid?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Cameron needed LOTS more sleep (hard to believe, huh? &lt;g&gt;). We <br/>
joked that, like a toddler, he was growing so fast that he slept <br/>
through puberty! Before, he would be up with the sun, every morning. <br/>
And he would sleep when it was dark, so he slept more in winter than in <br/>
summer. At puberty, he wrapped his schedule so that he was asleep <br/>
almost all day, and up just a few hours/night.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 18 now, and just said yesterday that he felt he needed to try for <br/>
another hour or so each night. The cool thing is that he KNOWS what he <br/>
needs sleep-wise because he has figured out what feels right and what <br/>
feels off. School wouldn&#39;t have helped wih that realization!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m usually in bed long before the girls.  What I&#39;ve noticed and something I<br/>
tend to &quot;smack myself about&quot; is that Emily was born a night owl.  Not your<br/>
typical newborn &quot;confused about night and day&quot; type night owl, but truly a<br/>
night owl.  Did her best sleeping from about 3am to 10am (if she was allowed<br/>
to).  I fought that for so many years, trying to get her to conform to a<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; schedule.  Her creativity starts sparking at around midnight. She<br/>
does her best writing at that hour.  She&#39;ll crawl into bed around 3 am or<br/>
sometimes as late as 5 am.  If there is somewhere she wants to go the next<br/>
day she will decide whether or not to go to bed earlier or whether to live<br/>
without rested sleep (or decide in the morning not to go.)  And I&#39;m fine<br/>
with that ....... now.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Elayne is probably the one that I would say is most to the societal<br/>
norm.  She goes to bed around 11:30 or so and is up by 8 or 8:30 usually.<br/>
She&#39;s always been that way.  From birth.  When she was a baby past when she<br/>
weaned at 3, I used to joke that her lulla-bye was the theme music to Star<br/>
Trek: Deep Space Nine as that was when she did her big &quot;sleepy nursing&quot; each<br/>
night.  It played in reruns after the news each night and by 10:35 she was<br/>
out!<br/>
<br/>
Keon is a morning person.  He is up with the sun whether he has had 3 hours<br/>
of sleep or 10 hours of sleep.  He does his best thinking at that time of<br/>
the day, can conquer obstacles, solve problems, and can be talked to about<br/>
things that might be upsetting him in his life best from 5am to about 10am.<br/>
He also has been like that since he was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
It was rough for a few years when I had one that I was &quot;fighting with&quot; past<br/>
midnight and another that was up at the crack of dawn wanting my attention.<br/>
HOw I wish I had had the ability to trust that Emily would get the sleep she<br/>
needed and staying up with Daddy was an ok thing rather than the tears we<br/>
both shed so many nights over &quot;needing to go to sleep&quot; and &quot;not being<br/>
tired.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Too bad we don&#39;t live in a society that honors that people have different<br/>
cycles sometimes at different times in their lives.  I can much more relate<br/>
to Keon&#39;s cycles than Emily&#39;s because I used to not be able to sleep if the<br/>
sun was up.  Even today if I wake up and recognize that the sun is up my<br/>
brain sends a signal that it is time to wake up.  I sometimes wonder if the<br/>
moon has the same effect on Emily.  But think how much happier people would<br/>
be if they could work or create or dream or rest when their bodies were<br/>
ready rather than when a clock told them to.<br/>

I haven&#39;t gotten throught the whole thread yet, so if someone has <br/>
said this already, please ignore.<br/>
<br/>
We go through bouts of this in our home. Our kids are up late too <br/>
and dh is the only one with an actual schedule who has to go to <br/>
work. I think it is difficult for him to be the one on the schedule <br/>
and not get down time (or cave time as it&#39;s called in the Mars/Venus <br/>
books) Beyond needing time at home ALONE (which many of the dh&#39;s <br/>
rarely get when kids stay up late) I think some husbands wish for <br/>
more spouse time too. His frustration may really mean he wants more <br/>
time with you. He may feel like the kids are getting all of the <br/>
attention (and time)<br/>

Just a thought...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909012854">My dad, stepmom and I were just discussing this over dinner. I have a  <br/>
lot of trouble sleeping right now, and part of it is that I am a  <br/>
night owl. I start to recover consciousness around noon, and come  <br/>
alive by 3pm. I love my time after 6pm, and usually cannot sleep  <br/>
before midnight. I prefer around 2am. My dad has been a third shift  <br/>
worker my entire life, he has consistently chosen jobs in which he  <br/>
could (nurse, graphic designer, artist, webpage designer). For the  <br/>
first time ever, tonight, my stepmom compared our childhood, neither  <br/>
of us ever slept as children at night. I didn&#39;t know that about him!  <br/>
It&#39;s so funny, because really, as a teenager I didn&#39;t desire to sleep  <br/>
more at night, I just became rebellious enough against my mom (she  <br/>
had primary custody) to fight it. I think maybe that&#39;s the  <br/>
difference, I was finally &#39;big&#39; enough to not be told I have to be in  <br/>
bed by 9pm. I think a lot of times that&#39;s where the myth comes in.<br/>
<br/>
Josh and Emily are night people. They stay up with me, and often way  <br/>
after me. They sleep in. They are happy. Rachel and Sam are both kids  <br/>
that know their needs, and go to bed earlier. They also get up at the  <br/>
buttcrack o&#39; dawn....hence my problem NOW with the lack of sleep. I  <br/>
go to bed around 2am, and I&#39;m up at 6am. Sigh....someday I&#39;ll get to  <br/>
sleep. lol!<br/>
<br/>
But someone told me last week that I&#39;m &#39;allowing my kids to learn  <br/>
dysfunctional behavior&#39;. I said, &quot;You have got to be kidding! My  <br/>
stepmom is a 3rd shift nurse, and she makes time and a half, plus  <br/>
bonus for signing up for the shifts that no one else wants!&quot; There  <br/>
will always be jobs for people who want to be up at night, there are  <br/>
always classes for people who want to go to college, and there are  <br/>
always options for people who want to live their lives in a manner  <br/>
which suits their personality!<br/>

&gt; Something I&#39;ve wondered about for ages -- this idea that teens all<br/>

&gt; here, but haven&#39;t heard teen sleep discussion here, either) some<br/>
&gt; people more or less say that it is a teen thing.  But I have my<br/>
&gt; suspicions otherwise -- I think it is an individual thing, that with<br/>
&gt; our modern society (electric lights, computers, etc.) to aid it,<br/>
&gt; makes it more obvious. </span></blockquote></div>

want to stay up so blinkin&#39; late :-)  Don&#39;t worry.  Since unschooling is new<br/>
to you and I&#39;m presuming that your partner works out of the house and isn&#39;t<br/>
around all day that it will take longer for him to see how unschooling is a<br/>
good fit for your family.<br/>
<br/>
How to respond to him?  I would remind him that there are 3 things that we<br/>
*can&#39;t* make a child do:  eat, sleep and eliminate.  You can present a child<br/>
with food, a bed and a toilet but it is up to them to physically do those<br/>
things (aside from medical intervention).  Just because your son is in bed<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that he will sleep nor sleep restfully.  He&#39;ll get it<br/>
eventually.<br/>
