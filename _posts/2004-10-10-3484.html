<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173559474">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not sure why your dd is acting like she is acting but it sounds<br/>
like something more serious is under all that anger. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This might be a normal reaction of a child who grew up being spanked and<br/>
punished, they say it gets worse before it gets better. It is very<br/>
destabilizing to a child, when their parents change so radically. And I<br/>
personally would look into Positive Discipline, but I don&#39;t even know if<br/>
this is an acceptable suggestion on this list :)))<br/>
