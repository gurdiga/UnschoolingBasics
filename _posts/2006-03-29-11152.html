<br/>
Together which is good.<br/>
<br/>
So ... to answer your question more broadly: I wouldn&#39;t stay at <br/>
<br/>
something they blatantly don&#39;t like, but I might possibly try <br/>
<br/>
another avenue to experience, say, music, that they WOULD like. That <br/>
<br/>
may or may not mean a different class.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I also am a music teacher and I used to teach MusikGarten.  I agree it is<br/>
better than Kindermusic.  Ironically, they were written by the same people.<br/>
Kindermusic got sold and watered down while the owner worked on MusikGarten<br/>
to make the program more what she wanted.  I think it can be a fun class but<br/>
I will say, making music at home with your kids, dancing and singing is way<br/>
more important than going to any class.  If you are shy about music or not<br/>
confident a MusikGarten or other mommy and me type class can help bring the<br/>
mom out of her shell and give her some confidence that may open up more<br/>
opportunities for music at home.  This is the real benefit of the classes<br/>

in KinderMusik since she was 18 months. We continue because she wants to go.<br/>
At this level she is reading music with no stress. I would say, look at the<br/>
classes in your area. All of our teachers have degrees in music and the also<br/>
teach voice, piano or violin.<br/>
