<div id="ygrps-yiv-7201734">I am so relieved to hear they&#39;re going to be ok. I had just gotten <br/>
some info. on homes she could stay in and was ready to forward it <br/>
tonight....having her own home is much better!<br/>
<br/>
I remember how awful things were after Ivan...this one is SO much <br/>
worse. We&#39;ve all been saying how Ivan was a blessing when you compare <br/>
it. They&#39;ve got a lot to deal with over the next few weeks. Our <br/>
thoughts are with you all.<br/>
