 </span></blockquote>  This sounds so familiar....in recent conversations with my mom.....well I know you disagree but I still think a curriculum would be helpful..like for days when you are really busy and to make sure the basics are covered.<br/>
   <br/>
  This is all fine for elementary school but you dont have the background to teach them jr high and high school science and math. <br/>
   <br/>
  ah well after this weekend shell either start to &quot;get it&quot; or shell be calling cps on her own daughter.<br/>
   <br/>
  As far as how do I deal with it? Well this will be our first year officialy and fully unschooling so i just worry about today and let tomorrow happen tomorrow. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229708768">I think you take a deep breath and ask what are they concerned with. When my mom has this conversation she is really concerned that I will push that he is working at gas station and not talk about college. My sister thinks that high school is needed so that they can do clubs or elective classes. <br/>
<br/>
I usually ask people what do people think kids &quot;have&quot; to learn, they reply &quot;stuff&quot; I ask them to define it what is so important to learn in school that they can not learn at home if they want. Or I ask them what they learned in school that they need in everyday life. <br/>
<br/>
people just do not get the concept of unschooling &quot;homeschooling is strange enough but unschooling just blows them away.  <br/>
<br/>
sometimes you just nod and say I hear your concerns but we will wait and see how they turn out.  <br/>
<br/>
its too late to be more coherent but it&#39;s a start<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905552989">I don&#39;t mention that we are unschooling to family members. I let them <br/>
assume that we are doing what ever they want to assume we are doing. <br/>
When I am asked about homeschooling I go on and on about the wonderful <br/>
and interesting things my kids are doing- I think they are all convinced <br/>
that my kids are genius&#39;s. They know we report to the state and that is <br/>
something that I can describe in detail. We also are involved with a <br/>
learning center and other activities so I can talk about that for quite <br/>
a while. As long as I have enough to say they tend to lose interest <br/>
after awhile and don&#39;t get too involved. It is kind of like a smoke <br/>
screen- I want to be left alone and want my kids not to be questioned <br/>
and judged so I create an appearance of something that is going on that <br/>
seems acceptable to my family- very similar to what I do with the state. <br/>
Kind of silly but it seems to work fine. I don&#39;t lie but emphasize what <br/>
we are doing and not what we aren&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287144862">***We went to see family and the grilling began. How do you deal with <br/>
it when<br/>
family bombard you with questions about how your educating them?***<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to avoid (what feels like) harassment about <br/>
unschooling is to not tell family about unschooling. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help a little to remember they&#39;re concerned because <br/>
they care about your kids.  That didn&#39;t help me much&lt;g&gt; but maybe it <br/>
helps some folks. <br/>
I tend to be straight forward and so would just say &quot;stop.&quot;   I told <br/>
my sil that she could talk to us about it (dh, Dylan and myself) at <br/>
our home at an appropriate time but during family functions wasn&#39;t <br/>
appropriate. She did not take me up on my offer&lt;g&gt; but she did use <br/>
discretion after that. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s more than you can stop in the moment with a word or two, and <br/>
it&#39;s more than you can stand, then maybe you can avoid those <br/>
situations where family members are likely to pester you.  It won&#39;t <br/>
be forever. <br/>
Things got better here as Dylan got older.  It *is* hard.  What <br/>
you&#39;re doing for your kids is important, though.  Let that give you <br/>
the courage to be firm and kind with those who are not as highly <br/>
evolved. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

the pavillion, family members from near and far gathered around, nosy<br/>
relatives peppering you with intrusive questions about unschooling.<br/>
And there&#39;s you, standing calmly with a smile on your face right<br/>
beside the apple pie as Aunt Marge makes yet another misguided<br/>
comment. Ah, but what&#39;s that in your bag? You pull out a photo album<br/>
of them all sitting on toilets and ask, ever so casually, &quot;Strangely<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205176894">I found a shift I had to make was to not see my family as people I could <br/>
trust with my frustrations or difficulties at all, ever. Anything that <br/>
isn&#39;t going right can somehow come back to the fact that the kids are at <br/>
home and I am not doing enough for myself, not able to earn enough <br/>
money, etc., and the solution is of course for them to go to school or <br/>
be away from me more. Even my husband will sometimes come to this <br/>
conclusion. I have to be very careful who I share frustrations with. <br/>
People always offer advice and that is not what I am looking for, most <br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
My family is always asking what I am doing for myself- nice that they <br/>
are concerned I suppose but it puts unwanted pressure on me to think I <br/>
should be doing more for myself. Usually less to do in general would be <br/>
helpful.<br/>

read aloud to her when he went to visit. Nevermind that he has an<br/>
incredible talent for math and science. Or that he LOVES history and<br/>
can tell you anything about nearly anyone who was important from the<br/>
beginning...<br/>
Then came the veiled threat &quot;I don&#39;t want you to go to jail for not<br/>
teaching your child...&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
You cannot imagine my frustration (and his) when I heard this. I just<br/>
cut her off for a few months until she promised never to do that<br/>
again. This hurt everyone involved but I had to stick to my guns. My<br/>
son was both frightened and humiliated by the experience. Now, five<br/>
years later, ALL of the children in my extended family are<br/>
homeschooled/unschooled. So I guess it was all for the good. <br/>
BTW he can read at grade level or above now.... Practice, Practice,<br/>
Practice...</div>

I, too, (along with many others here, I&#39;m guessing!) have to be very careful<br/>
about what I share and with who (whom? ugh, never did know when to use<br/>
those!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I decided that I needed a healthy way to vent, share my concerns,<br/>
frustrations, worries, along with my hopes, dreams, successes, etc.  So, I<br/>
started a blog that&#39;s only visible to people I invite personally.  And, of<br/>
course, I filled that stack of invites with people I *knew* would be there<br/>
whole-heartedly to support me and back me up during those times of worry or<br/>
panic or enlightenment or beauty.  I also wanted those people to be able to<br/>
call me on something if needed, to encourage further growth in myself.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I have two blogs, one for &quot;oh, look at what a great life we have&quot;<br/>
(cuz, we really do!)  that is for everyone&#39;s eyes, my family, his family,<br/>
etc.  So they can see that we are in fact DOING stuff (living, that is).<br/>
And the other one is just my private little place to go when I need to get<br/>
it all out there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something like that would be helpful to you?  Just a thought!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402048086">For some reason doing more things that are about me doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
satisfy, only increases the desire for more, and the frustration with <br/>
lack of time for them. Not that I want to deny myself anything but <br/>
keeping it simple and unscheduled is best for me- I have never found <br/>
that planning classes or outings just for me really helps me relax or be <br/>
more connected. I try to minimize time away from home as my kids have <br/>
more than enough ideas of things that involve getting in the car. <br/>
Sleeping and resting enough and eating well and having a good book are <br/>
pretty wonderful- and knowing that my kids are happy and healthy and <br/>
that we have enough. Sometimes I am glad that we struggle a bit with the <br/>
basics at times as I see people around me who have the basics very well <br/>
covered and seem to invent other  problems for themselves- moms who are <br/>
doing this and that and the other thing for themselves but still seem <br/>
unsatisfied.<br/>
<br/>
I do find that reading unschooling lists is really a great thing for <br/>
rejuvenating myself- I always read something that is just perfect for <br/>
where I am right now. I have come to feel okay about time spent on <br/>
reading email though sometimes others(my husband) see it as a waste of <br/>
my time. Wish I had more of that in my &quot;real&quot; life from people I see <br/>
face to face- mostly just a lot of worry about what to put on the IHIP <br/>
(Individalized Home Instruction Plan for those you do not report in NY). <br/>
My goodness- what a way to live - to actually plan your days around <br/>
something someone in the government thought up.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason the idea of a blog makes me nervous but I do write in a <br/>
journal on and off and have found that very helpful.<br/>
