<div id="ygrps-yiv-881341819">im happy to let my kids play with a vast range of different aged <br/>
children, as iknow each child gives something different, but im <br/>
becoming increasingly concerned about a girl whois approx 14 yrs of <br/>
age, whoplays with my children and some others here in our street.<br/>
 my concerns began when my child came in and told me shed said, if he <br/>
didnt do as she said, she would make all the other kids, not play with <br/>
him. soi kindly spoke to her about this, and all seemed well. however <br/>
today, i caight her whispering to the other kids, if they played with  <br/>
my children, she would never be friendly with them again . now, i dont <br/>
want to level myself to the psych of a 14 yr old, but im becoming <br/>
increasingly worried, that shes dominating and  controlling children <br/>
much much younger than herself. if im truthful, im quite angry she <br/>
bullied mine too. there are lots of kids her age in the neighbourhood, <br/>
but she insists on playing with 4 to 9 yr olds, i think cos she has <br/>
lots of control over them as opposed toher peers. her parents willjust <br/>
hurl abuse at me if i approach them. what doi do...myhead is cabbaged <br/>
with this kid. helpplease someone with a clear non judgemental mind !!! <br/>
thanks very much   anna</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-930824524">Do you know that is what the parents of the girl will do if you<br/>
approach them? or is that what you assume? Because if that&#39;s how they<br/>
are that explains a lot about the child. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes speaking to some of the other children&#39;s parents casually<br/>
can help safety in numbers. even though yes it seems to be targeted at<br/>
yours they are still intimidating their children as well in order to<br/>
alienate yours. They would probably be interested in knowing this.<br/>
good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684447880">In a similar situation I asked my kids how they felt about it and <br/>
what they thought they could do.  My kids felt they were obligated to <br/>
do what the kid told them to do.  After a talk, they decided to tell <br/>
the older child no thanks to the bossy behavior.  I guess sometimes <br/>
kids forget they are in charge of themselves and they do what an <br/>
older kid says to do so they can be accepted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its entirely possible that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. If the girl in question <br/>
feels pretty helpless at home its natural that she&#39;d try to replay <br/>
some of those power dynamics with others - to put herself in the <br/>
position of the one who makes the rules and enforces them by any <br/>
means necessary. <br/>
<br/>
What can you do? Confrontation isn&#39;t likely to help in any way. But <br/>
you can make Your home more welcoming for play, so other kids are <br/>
motivated to come and play in your &quot;territory&quot; as it were. When the <br/>
kids are playing near, you have the opportunity to set the tone, to <br/>
model generosity and graciousness. It would mean more direct <br/>
engagement on your part. Without knowing more about your situation, I <br/>
can&#39;t really give any specific suggestions, but ask your kids, for <br/>
sure. How can you make your home an oaisis for kids in your <br/>
neighborhood?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236265471">We have moved into a multicultural neighborhood. It has created a variety of dynamics for our kids. They are getting exposure to other cultures but at the same time across the lines of ethnicity you have people who play nicely and those who just don&#39;t. It has taken a bit for our kids to find ones that play they play nicely together they have even started their own club &quot;The Club for Nice People&quot;. They have been trying to find a safe place for a club house. Well since my daughter&#39;s new best friend lives almost directly behind us, there is an empty trailer lot and a fence in between and the other mother isn&#39;t as involved with her children playing outside, she does have a very new baby to take care of and the weather has been icky. We decided that since we are turning out little lot into an edible landscape we are going to set aside one area with a lattice arbor and let the kids help us plant and create their own club house. The parents are all thrilled to<br/>
 death and materials are being donated. <br/>
<br/>
We have had similar problems with some of the kids in the neighborhood, however, I have noticed that when I am outside, not necessarily playing with the kids but working on building our gardens, cleaning the car and restocking it, etc they seem to behave better. I think it is more or less an escape from dominating parents but if there is an authority figure around they seem to mind their manners. I do try to include them if they are near by when we pass out juice boxes or water bottles or some kind of snack. This is probably how our house becomes a haven to other kids. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Of course a few of the families are a bit taken back by the fact we homeschool. I haven&#39;t even attempted to explain unschooling to them it would just confuse them as they are having a hard time understanding why we don&#39;t take advantage of the school system and give ourselves a break from having the kids with us constantly. <br/>
<br/>
But I definitely promote the idea of creating a safe haven on your own turf. Most kids that bully are bullied themselves at home. Perhaps if this girl sees that not all parents are like that, it might help her to make better decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664062360">You can only control yourself. I second the suggestions of creating an oasis<br/>
at your home. The neighborhood kids all love to come to my house. We have a<br/>
trampoline and a huge back yard. I have beverages and occasionally snacks.<br/>
We also have a wii and a nice playroom and art supplies for indoor play. We<br/>
have one major rule: be nice of leave. I will let the kids know what I<br/>
expect. I respect them and I expect respectful treatment to all who is<br/>
there. This was people who are unpleasant can&#39;t play at our house.<br/>
