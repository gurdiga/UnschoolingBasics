<div id="ygrps-yiv-746248592">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I am one of your loyal lurkers :) I continue to learn so much by reading<br/>
and I am always inspired!!  Thanks to all of you who take the time to post<br/>
and reply!<br/>
<br/>
Quick intro:  My name is Holli. I have two shiny and free kiddos (5 & 3) and<br/>
we live in Minnesota.  My husband and I have always unschooled our kiddos<br/>
and are thankful everyday to be on such a wonderful journey with our<br/>
kids....life IS really good!<br/>
<br/>
The question :)  I am trying to collect quotes that would pertain to<br/>
unschooling for my mom.  She would like to create something (i.e.. picture<br/>
frames...??) that she can then engrave these types of quotes on to them.  I<br/>
thought I would ask this awesome community if you would be willing to share<br/>
some of your favorite quotes with us??  There have been so many great quotes<br/>
that have been posted over time....some I have written down, some I just<br/>
remember and others I have forgot and wish I still remembered them.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Holli :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137129199">There are lots of quotes on the Natural Child website.  They are all related to living in freedom, but some are specific to natural learning/unschooling: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/quotes/">http://www.naturalchild.org/quotes/</a><br/>
