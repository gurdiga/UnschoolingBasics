<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918762587">hello,<br/>
<br/>
I, like another poster, am new to all this! I am very intrigued by <br/>
unschooling, have read some books, and it just feels right! The only <br/>
issue I am having...besides all the family and friend negative <br/>
comments, is regarding reading. I have this hang up about it , I <br/>
quess. We are in FLorida and they push and push kids to read in <br/>
Kindergarden, which i strontly disagree with. THe only thing is I <br/>
find myself also, like the other poster, trying to &quot;teach&quot; my <br/>
daughter with phonic aids , videos etc. She likes the videos and <br/>
even likes trying to write the words on paper. THe problem is that <br/>
other moms of schooled kids, make comments all the time about their <br/>
kids in school like &quot;oh it is so cool to see x and y reading <br/>
already! oh...they know all their sight words! Hey, I could give you <br/>
my daughters sight word lists..so they can AT LEAST learn those at <br/>
home!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents of older unschooled kids out there...how?? did your kids <br/>
learn to read..and specifically those damn sight words that <br/>
apparently do not follow the rules!!!! I cannot remember how I <br/>
learned to read. I know it was not the method they use now and at a <br/>
much later age. Makes sense that they need to be ready to learn <br/>
something...but I keep feeling like my DD will be behind (behind <br/>
what...I am not sure..I quess all her schooled friends..whose moms <br/>
have a habbit of saying in front of me and my dd ...&quot;Jennifer..spell <br/>
H E R for me..and they spell it correctly...this is MY hang up.<br/>
HELP PLEASE!!!!!!!!</div>

Quit hanging around folks that make your or your daughter feel &quot;less <br/>
than.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OR keep hanging around them, and ten years from now, you can sit back <br/>
and tell them how wonderful your relationship with your daughter is <br/>
while their kids hate them---and lie and sulk. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Cameron (18) was in school but there he learned that reading sucks. It <br/>
took him years to get over that.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan (ten) has never had a lesson, but I&#39;ve answered all his <br/>
questions about letters and words and sounds. He can read &quot;big&quot; words <br/>
with no problem; smaller, common words make him pause. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;ve never <br/>
done &quot;readers&quot; (except those Spongebob and Scooby-Doo books). He pulls <br/>
Dr Seuss books off his shelf sometimes to look through by himself. I <br/>
sstill read to him. We just finished _Revenge of the Shadow King_. I <br/>
read, and he followed along. He read paragraphs every now and <br/>
then---with FEELING----and with accents! &lt;G&gt; We&#39;re starting _The Once <br/>
and Future King_ this week (more accents! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was in Charleston visiting a friend with a seven year old. <br/>
In school. His homework included one of those &quot;readers&quot; that <br/>
concentrated on the &quot;ar&quot; sound. Cart, start, arf, part, dart, mart --- <br/>
I can&#39;t remember all the words---and then they added &quot;swarm&quot;---I don&#39;t <br/>
know about the accents where you live, but &quot;swarm&quot; has a different <br/>
sound around here! ANYWAY... I watched as he struggled with each and <br/>
every word. That&#39;s never happened here with Duncan. He knows it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Our world is print-rich. Reading is a natural result.<br/>
<br/>
Our world is also dog-rich, bee-rich, cycling-rich, gaming-rich, <br/>
music-rich, writing-rich, gardening-rich, traveling-rich, talk-rich, <br/>
soon-to-be-chicken-rich.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think the natural results of our children&#39;s lives will be? <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Makes sense that they need to be ready to learn something...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
When we are ready and when we need it, we will learn it. Not a moment <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
but I keep feeling like my DD will be behind (behind<br/>
what...I am not sure..I quess all her schooled friends.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Will you be just as envious when your child is behind on drugs, sex, <br/>
smoking, and drinking? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get over it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll read when she&#39;s ready because that&#39;s what we do.<br/>
<br/>
If the schools&#39; methods worked, why are there so many illiterate <br/>
adults? Why do so many kids hate to read? Why is it such a big deal?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306731043">When those other moms offer their lists, just say &quot;No thank you, <br/>
we&#39;ve got it covered.&quot;  Or whatever.  That&#39;s too bad that your <br/>
getting so much pressure when your daughter is 5 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughters really do read.  One is nearly 12 and the other just <br/>
turned 7.  No phonics teaching, no workbooks, no specifically &quot;learn <br/>
to read&quot; games.  It really did just happen.  They are quite <br/>
different in personality, and they learned at different ages, but it <br/>
happened.  What did I do?  With my older dd, I read to her A LOT.  <br/>
She loved it, and she always wanted to know what everything was.  <br/>
She started reading when she was 3, and I know that&#39;s not common.  <br/>
With my younger dd, I read her a lot of stuff on video games even <br/>
more than books because that&#39;s what she liked. She just turned 7 <br/>
last month and really started reading about 6 months ago.  They both <br/>
play on the computer a lot.  Also my older dd discovered closed <br/>
captioning on the TV once when she was about 4 or 5, and we always <br/>
have that on because she likes it.  That&#39;s pretty much it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find a lot of great stuff about learning to read if you <br/>
follow some of the links at the left here.  Joyfully Rejoycing and <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s site are both great with lots of stories.  All of the <br/>
older unschoolers do know how to read.  They learned at lots of <br/>
different ages, but they all learned.<br/>
<br/>
As far as sight words, we&#39;ve had no trouble with words that don&#39;t <br/>
follow certain rules because we don&#39;t teach those rules!  Sounds <br/>
silly, but it&#39;s true.  If these are common words, your child will <br/>
see them a lot.  If she wants to know what a word is, just tell <br/>
her.  If she asks again, tell her again.  Eventually she&#39;ll just <br/>
know it.<br/>
<br/>
If there comes a time when she feels bad about not knowing how to <br/>
read, be confident that she will.  Because she will, really.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804514774">Lol....I&#39;ve started to respond three times and figure you really don&#39;t need the details.<br/>
  I just wanted to tell you that this unschooling stuff really works.  My son learns by<br/>
  leaps and bounds on a daily basis.  He reads everything and reads at a high level<br/>
  just because he has found books contain tons of awesome information.<br/>
   <br/>
  Recently, while playing a computer game, he learned of General George S. Patton.<br/>
  That lead to a google search for more info on Patton.  Since my son, George,  and Patton share a name and a military passion, General Patton is my son&#39;s new hero.  My son<br/>
  was thrilled when he learned that Patton was homeschooled, also.<br/>
   <br/>
  Yesterday, once again while playing another computer game, he decided he wanted to<br/>
  learn more about the Greek Gods.  Needless to say, he researched it and quenched <br/>
  his thirst.<br/>
   <br/>
  As for learning sight words and spelling and such....Let me just say that in February, 2006,<br/>
  my son left his spelling book in GA on purpose.  When we were just up there, for fun he <br/>
  wanted to see if he could spell those words even though he never studied them.  So I called out the word lists and surprise, surprise, without ever studying them, he knew them all.<br/>
<br/>

<p><small><time>14 Dec 2006, at  9:19am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399046240">My DS learned to read right around age 5 by reading (others have kids<br/>
who learned earlier than that AND later than that - by teenage, there&#39;s<br/>
no way to tell the difference). At 8 1/2, he reads pretty much anything<br/>
at will. It&#39;s kind of like taking a white shirt and putting it in a pot<br/>
of red dye - it can&#39;t help but pick up the dye. Similarly, kids in our<br/>
culture are *surrounded* by words - on commercials, road signs, games,<br/>
etc as well as books and magazines. Closed captioning (when done well,<br/>
not the stuff on live sportscasts) is really cool because they can *see*<br/>
the action, *hear* the words, AND *see* the words all at the same time.<br/>
When my DS was wanting to read (he said &quot;We need to get Hooked on<br/>
Phonics so I can learn to read&quot;), I already knew that he knew many words<br/>
on sight (and really, isn&#39;t that what &#39;fluent&#39; reading is, knowing words<br/>
on sight - how many adults reading this are sounding out every word, or<br/>
even reading every single solitary word - nope, fluent readers read in<br/>
&#39;groups&#39; of words, glossing over little words like &#39;the&#39;). BUT he had<br/>
the idea that reading was difficult (thanks to all the phonics<br/>
commercials). We spent a total of about 1 hr over 3 nights with the Bob<br/>
books and that convinced him that he could read &quot;Hey I&#39;m a reader!&quot; with<br/>
face all aglow (and even then, we didn&#39;t do them as &#39;instructed&#39; - we<br/>
just picked books from the set and first night I read them all, second<br/>
night he read one, third night we did a random half dozen or so together<br/>
and that was it). All he really needed was to know that he *was* reading<br/>
already and he took off. <br/>
 <br/>
Some things we did with him included: reading aloud to him; turning on<br/>
closed captioning; playing with letter magnets on the fridge (&quot;Mommy,<br/>
what does qrwztymbklf spell?&quot; - time to discuss vowels and how they help<br/>
Mommy not sprain her tongue LOL); &#39;buddy reading&#39; where he was<br/>
&#39;responsible&#39; for one or two words in a story (like Stop and Dog in Go,<br/>
Dog, Go) and I&#39;d read the rest, pausing for him to fill in his word,<br/>
then continuing. That led gradually to alternating words, sentences,<br/>
paragraphs, pages as *he* chose (that&#39;s big, it wasn&#39;t an assignment or<br/>
lesson, I&#39;d ask if he wanted to do a word, if so, great, if not, great)<br/>
- sometimes he wanted to just listen, sometimes he wanted to read<br/>
together, and eventually, sometimes he wanted to read to me (one time, I<br/>
wasn&#39;t feeling well and headed to bed early. He came in with a favorite<br/>
book and said he was going to read to me to help me get to sleep and<br/>
feel better. So I just closed my eyes and listened to him read me to<br/>
sleep.) Also, as he was wanting to read more himself, we went back to<br/>
his old favorite board books for a bit - stories he knew by heart and<br/>
loved, stories that are designed for adults to read to kids, not &quot;early<br/>
readers&quot;, he knew the words by sound and could now sort out which<br/>
symbols went with which sounds. DH learned the same way per MIL - he<br/>
went off with a favorite book (&quot;Johnny Lion&#39;s Book&quot;) and proceeded to<br/>
match up the symbols (aka &#39;words&#39;) with the sounds he knew so well. Of<br/>
course, then MIL called the school DH would be attending in the fall for<br/>
K and asked what she should do to assist him now that he was beginning<br/>
to read. They told her NOT to LET him read because he&#39;d learn it all<br/>
wrong. She ignored them.<br/>
 <br/>
Okay, now, my best guess as to *how* DS learned to read (since we<br/>
certainly didn&#39;t sit him down and teach him, not even sight words.<br/>
Closest we came was answering a gazillion &quot;what&#39;s that say?&quot; questions).<br/>
He&#39;d suck in words like a vacuum - &quot;what&#39;s this say? what&#39;s that say?<br/>
That says Stop!&quot; and listening to us read to him. Then, internally, he&#39;d<br/>
break things into pattern blocks or chunks which he&#39;d then apply to new<br/>
words he met. Kind of like digesting pasta primavera into carbs,<br/>
proteins, vitamins etc and using them to fuel your body. Example: he<br/>
&#39;met&#39; the word &quot;water&quot;, and had &quot;gathered&quot; the blocks: w, at, er Then he<br/>
met the word &quot;weather&quot;. Looks similar, apply known blocks, context<br/>
doesn&#39;t fit, look for other known blocks, ask questions. So, he&#39;d ask<br/>
and we&#39;d say &quot;That&#39;s weather&quot; and point out the ea and th blocks (based<br/>
on hearing his first try) so now he has w, at, er, ea, and th blocks to<br/>
apply. And so on. But way less &quot;solid&quot;, lots more &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; type<br/>
approximations applied on his part to figure things out (again, that&#39;s<br/>
just my guesstimate of what was happening internally). While his<br/>
age-mates in Bible class were hesitantly sounding their way through<br/>
things, I was getting comments on how well he read *from public school<br/>
teacher friends* who were teaching his Bible classes. When they&#39;d ask<br/>
how we taught him to read so well, we&#39;d just smile, shrug and say We<br/>
didn&#39;t! He learned to read, we didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; him (in the common usage<br/>
of that word, implying some form of structured plan of tuition applied<br/>
to a student rather than springing from the learner).<br/>

learning to read anymore that they need to shout it out ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Parents of older unschooled kids out there...how?? did your kids<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How did your child learn to speak? Think about that. She started with  <br/>
*nothing*, not even understanding what language is and she basically  <br/>
pulled an understanding out of her environment.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to that reading is a cinch! She already knows what words are  <br/>
and that the sounds correspond to concepts. That&#39;s the hard part.  <br/>
Figuring out how the squiggles on paper map to the sounds and  <br/>
concepts is relatively easy.<br/>
<br/>
Or *will* be easy when her brain is ready to make the connections.  <br/>
That might be tomorrow. That might be 7 years from now. (But not to  <br/>
worry. Unschooled kids learn just fine learning in all the other ways  <br/>
there are to learn. And a new 12 yo reader is shortly reading at age  <br/>
level and is indistinguishable from one who started 6 years earlier.)<br/>
<br/>
Schools make learning to read difficult because they need the kids to  <br/>
demonstrate that they can read by a certain age and they need all the  <br/>
kids to use the same materials. There&#39;s little room to take into  <br/>
account the child&#39;s desire, interest or need, all the things that  <br/>
made learning to speak so effortless, and all the things that make  <br/>
unschooling possible.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read in school on the school&#39;s schedule is very very hard.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read when a child is ready and interested happens with as  <br/>
little effort as learning to speak.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;But what percentage of moms who have Kindergartners say that? It<br/>
&gt;undoubtedly seems like all the kids are reading but the ones with<br/>
&gt;kids who are struggling are keeping shut about it! The ones who speak<br/>
&gt;up are just so darned relieved that they don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
&gt;learning to read anymore that they need to shout it out ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Parents of older unschooled kids out there...how?? did your kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn to read<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did your child learn to speak? Think about that. She started with<br/>
&gt;*nothing*, not even understanding what language is and she basically<br/>
&gt;pulled an understanding out of her environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Compared to that reading is a cinch! She already knows what words are<br/>
&gt;and that the sounds correspond to concepts. That&#39;s the hard part.<br/>
&gt;Figuring out how the squiggles on paper map to the sounds and<br/>
&gt;concepts is relatively easy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or *will* be easy when her brain is ready to make the connections.<br/>
&gt;That might be tomorrow. That might be 7 years from now. (But not to<br/>
&gt;worry. Unschooled kids learn just fine learning in all the other ways<br/>
&gt;there are to learn. And a new 12 yo reader is shortly reading at age<br/>
&gt;level and is indistinguishable from one who started 6 years earlier.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Schools make learning to read difficult because they need the kids to<br/>
&gt;demonstrate that they can read by a certain age and they need all the<br/>
&gt;kids to use the same materials. There&#39;s little room to take into<br/>
&gt;account the child&#39;s desire, interest or need, all the things that<br/>
&gt;made learning to speak so effortless, and all the things that make<br/>
&gt;unschooling possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Learning to read in school on the school&#39;s schedule is very very hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Learning to read when a child is ready and interested happens with as<br/>
&gt;little effort as learning to speak.<br/>

______?&quot; over and over again.:)<br/>
<br/>
It really was that basic. I answered their questions, I read to them,<br/>
I read FOR them without hesitation and I now have three readers. One<br/>
learned at a more traditional age of 6 (but not truly fluent until<br/>
close to 9), one that was intensely curious about words at 5 and 6 and<br/>
became fluent by 7/8, one that didn&#39;t seem to care one whit about<br/>
reading and asked me to read everything until he was 12 and suddenly<br/>
started reading and a 5 y.o. that has very little interest in words or<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
They learn if there is an interested and curious adult helping them<br/>
with whatever they want to know. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>

That was the beginning. He really learned a lot from playing <br/>
Runescape on the computer too.  Our 9 year old learned to read from <br/>
playing Runescape also.  Each kid is different. <br/>

  I think it was Ren who said she just answers their questions<br/>

   <br/>
  I have met some kids that don&#39;t read, and to me it seems,<br/>

In school. By being pressured before they&#39;re ready. By being made fun <br/>
of for making mistakes. By being put in the remedial reading groups <br/>
because they can&#39;t keep up with the others. Because they&#39;re not ready. <br/>
Then they think they&#39;re stupid or lazy or incompetent, so they give up.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen only in schools. Parents can do it at home to their <br/>
kids too.<br/>
<br/>
But a world full of print and joyful reading produces readers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679749954">hi pamela! my name is jen mobley and i&#39;ve been unschooling now for only two <br/>
months and I can&#39;t see ever sending my daughter back into public (or <br/>
private) school. I used sight words with her but not forcefully. I will say <br/>
that she gained a sense of accomplishment when we would read a story and she <br/>
knew the words from learning them off the cards. I didn&#39;t really teach her <br/>
how to read though. One day, we went to Barnes and Noble and she picked up a <br/>
box of BOB books (not bob the builder) and just started reading them all by <br/>
herself! I was so amazed that I bought them. She&#39;s been reading on her own <br/>
ever since! A big part of reading is being read to. Don&#39;t worry about her <br/>
falling behind...most unschoolers are way ahead of their public school peers <br/>
because they are given freedom to explore and express themselves in a way <br/>
that public school prohibits. You&#39;re doing a great job!<br/>
