<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348652385">I seem to have a different take on this than do many of you.<br/>
Years and years ago, the 40s maybe, there was an experiment in which toddlers<br/>
were allowed to choose their own foods and although they went on jags of<br/>
choosing the same food over and over in the long term they chose nutritious<br/>
diets. This was presented as liberating news for parents and children alike in<br/>
that parents did not have to force their children to eat what the parents<br/>
chose. In a second phase of the experiment they introduced foods with refined<br/>
sugar and that changed the results. Children chose the sugars foods to an<br/>
extent that unbalanced their diets. In the first phase all the food choices had<br/>
been natural foods.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that refined foods such as refined<br/>
sugar and refined flour throw off our bodies operation. We may feel fine and<br/>
normal if we typically eat these foods but we may not know how our bodies would<br/>
feel if they were on a diet of natural foods. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw an interesting example of this in a mother who made<br/>
the sacrifice of going on a paleo diet for the sake of her breastfed baby and<br/>
was amazed how much better she felt. The things that bothered her baby had<br/>
actually been bothering her all her life and she never know what normal could<br/>
be.<br/>

Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>

My stepson&#39;s mom went to a lot of effort to give her kids a great <br/>

all &quot;hippie chow&quot; and avoids it whenever he can. The first time I <br/>
made pancakes with white flour he thought they were the best <br/>
pancakes he&#39;d ever eaten. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an interesting tidbit, though: after a few weeks of being <br/>
allowed to have all the cakes and cokes he could eat at our house he <br/>
out-and-out said &quot;You know what, now that I can have all the sugar I <br/>
want, I don&#39;t want nearly as much of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Scientific studies have their place in the world, but we can&#39;t let <br/>
them stand in the way of seeing the real-world behavior of our real <br/>
life kids.<br/>

These are all valid points. The problem seems to me to be that<br/>
the natural limits that govern life are sometimes unclear. If a child is so<br/>
allergic to peanuts that eating any could send him into shock, then �limiting�<br/>
peanuts is a no-brainer. But most things are judgment calls. My son and his<br/>
wife (I live with them) select fresh foods of such variety that my granddaughter<br/>
really can�t eat poorly. Candy is available in smallish quantities. If she<br/>
wants something, it goes on the shopping list and she finds something else to<br/>
eat in the meantime. Soda, chips other highly processed foods aren�t controlled<br/>
but are seldom in the house. Curiously, they do require her to eat something by<br/>
way of breakfast before they�ll let her watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I take my granddaughter shopping with me and see the effect<br/>
of advertising and packaging on her. I have a rule of my own that I do not make<br/>
impulse purchases at the checkout counter and have extended that rule to her.<br/>
Arbitrary? Or sanity saving? She selects food such as mac & cheese because<br/>
it has Arthur or Dora on the packaging. Then she doesn�t eat it because she<br/>
doesn�t like it and I�m left with mixed feelings because on the one hand it�s<br/>
wasteful but on the other its respectful of her choices and eventually she<br/>
should learn she doesn�t necessarily like foods with Arthur or Dora on the<br/>
package.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just recalled that when my kids where young I�d let them<br/>
each select one item, no questions asked. Had to put a $5 limit on that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another topic where limits may or may not be advisable, my<br/>
son has done some reading on pornography and says that first exposure can be<br/>
damaging and not undone (can�t unring the bell). He says he does not want to<br/>
create forbidden fruit nor rules that any kid with gumption will defy but he<br/>
doesn�t want his daughters, now 4.5 yrs and 5 wks, seeing porn at age 11<br/>
(supposedly the average age of first exposure on the web). We discussed the<br/>
possibility that if the girls really trust him and see him as enabling their<br/>
goals, they may accept his limits until they reach an agreed age (18? 21?).  Whaddaya think?<br/>
