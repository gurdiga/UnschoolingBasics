 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t ever been to a conference, but, for the hot tub thing, I <br/>
see that as physical activity, as in PE !  <br/>
---and as late as i&#39;m responding to this i&#39;m sure they are on to some <br/>
other adventure by now!  <br/>
I haven&#39;t followed the list for a week or so, but i&#39;m wondering if <br/>
anyone talked of deschooling?  Its something you do to get <br/>
the &quot;school&quot; out of your head!  Give yourself and kids, if they were <br/>
in school, a month for every year.  That means you take that time to <br/>
just hang out and not worry about school a bit, give you and your <br/>
kids a BIG break!   In the mean time if you are still reading about <br/>
unschooling, you&#39;ll notice more and more of what they are doing and <br/>
what they are learning!  Syndi</div>

<br/>
AH, but they are!! Learning that is....<br/>
<br/>
As to your conference question, please come Jeanne. It will be the <br/>
most life changing experience, I can guarantee it! It&#39;s worth going <br/>
in to debt over.<br/>
If you spend the weekend with hundreds of bubbly, interesting <br/>
unschoolers and still have doubts, then you just shouldn&#39;t <br/>
unschool!!:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a family event, with workshops and fun for everyone. Kelly will <br/>
have the website up soon, and you can start reading about the <br/>
offerings.<br/>
<br/>
*Kelly: Is there somewhere she can read about past conferences? Is <br/>
that still online?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916532640">Back in 2000, my dh & I were just THINKING about homeschooling.  I was sure<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ever actually do it (little did I know...).  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we ended up attending an Unschooling conference in Dallas & it<br/>
totally changed our lives.  I went in saying &quot;it would be nice to<br/>
homeschool, but I could never do it&quot;.  We came out saying &quot;we will ALWAYS<br/>
unschool our kids&quot;.  The only thing I can think to compare our experience<br/>
to, is a religious conversion.  Our whole world view about school & learning<br/>
changed 360 degrees.  We attended lots of talks & discussions.  There were<br/>
lots of fantastic speakers.  The kids did art projects & drumming & played<br/>
mini golf & watched movies & played chess & swam.  We attended the super<br/>
talent show.  And on and on and on.  Just spending 3 days with a hotel full<br/>
of unschoolers was phenomenal.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend it.<br/>

living next fall. Dh got a list of possible bases and most of them <br/>
are remote--i.e., far from major airports. With 3 little ones (5 and <br/>
under next fall) driving a long way and then having connecting <br/>
flights sounds really hard!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640881056">We&#39;ve been to exactly ONE conference and here&#39;s what went on for us:<br/>
<br/>
I got to meet some folks I knew as online &quot;voices&quot; - that was cool<br/>
<br/>
DS (6) built some cool structures out of marshmallows with my <br/>
assistance in holding the toothpicks as needed to keep things stable <br/>
as he built.<br/>
<br/>
We spent a lot of time in the (indoor) pool area<br/>
<br/>
I spent a lot of time catching DS as he jumped off the big rock in <br/>
the pool courtyard once he studied some of the bigger kids and <br/>
figured out how to climb up (with a boost from mom for the first <br/>
couple times).<br/>
<br/>
Spent a lot of time in the &quot;play room&quot; with both DH and DS (there <br/>
was a pile of paper and DH had a great time folding things). Chatted <br/>
with folks at the pool and the play room.<br/>
<br/>
Popped in on a couple of speaker sessions while DS and DH were up in <br/>
the room watching a movie. Oh and I also couldn&#39;t resist popping in <br/>
on the foster puppy funshop and getting to be near a pup for a while <br/>
(since our two dogs had to stay home with a sitter).<br/>
<br/>
DH stayed for the whole Talent Show on Sunday night - DS and I <br/>
waited to hear Anne Ohman and clan perform the song Shaving Cream <br/>
(one of our favorite ditties) then we went to the pool for several <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
We went to out dinner one evening and I had wonderful plate of <br/>
ravioli stuffed with squash in a wonderful sauce. At the next table <br/>
at Capone&#39;s was another unschooling family which was cool - don&#39;t <br/>
experience that every day.<br/>
<br/>
We went on the whale watch appended to the end of the conference and <br/>
that was great - lots of people all mingling and chatting. One girl <br/>
we had spent time with at the pool saw that DS was chilly (despite <br/>
his jacket) and went and brought a blanket over that they could <br/>
share. It was a really special blanket to her from when she was <br/>
little and she freely shared it - that was cool! We shared some of <br/>
our &quot;ogre mix&quot; snack with her - instead of mixing up the &quot;trail mix&quot; <br/>
(nuts, giant M&Ms, raisins, Cherrios, etc) we just layer them (ogres <br/>
have layers ...) and dig in.<br/>
<br/>
We ate at the dockside seafood restaurant afterward and the place <br/>
was brim full of unschoolers which was really cool. Didn&#39;t stay to <br/>
see Whoopi though - we were heading home and wanted to get back <br/>
before it was too terribly late.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s totally unlike anything schoolish, not even like a <br/>
homeschooling convention where you sit and listen to people explain <br/>
how to get your kids to ... and browse through tons of curriculum <br/>
vendors. The only vendors there had some really neat stuff (like <br/>
percussion instruments and craft materials), no &quot;school in a box&quot; <br/>
stuff anywhere. There are no &quot;shoulds&quot; only opportunities and <br/>
options. If you want, you can consider it a really cool vacation and <br/>
just take advantage of the discount hotel rate - but then you&#39;d miss <br/>
a lot of the fun stuff from just mingling around and seeing what <br/>
transpires.</div>
