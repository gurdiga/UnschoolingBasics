<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743508651">&quot;I would be saddened to see this list<br/>
disappear because of a few antagonistic people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I don&#39;t think anyone is trying to be<br/>
antagonistic. I think that we all filter things through our life<br/>
experiences and expectations.<br/>
Ah, EXPECTATIONS...mess ya up everytime.:)<br/>
<br/>
If we can accept that what it is, it IS.<br/>
Acceptance helps us navigate discussions,changes, growth and LIFE in<br/>
such a healthier manner. I find that when something aggravates me, I&#39;m<br/>
either filtering it through perceptions (that aren&#39;t necessarily the<br/>
truth) and/or doesn&#39;t match my expectations.<br/>
<br/>
If something at the list is confusing, or not making sense, by all<br/>
means ASK. If an idea or philosophy isn&#39;t holding up to your life<br/>
experience, then state that and ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
This list is certainly not the end-all-be-all of unschooling<br/>
information. It&#39;s one resource for everyone to use in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not going anywhere. Kelly and I can vent with each other, but<br/>
fortunately one of us is usually more calm than the other when it<br/>
happens.  In my lesser moments I think that charging people for phone<br/>
or email consultation sounds GREAT! I figure if my advice is worth the<br/>
screen it&#39;s typed on, someone will pay for it eh???<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, then I realize that I enjoy being aggravated to some<br/>
degree...because it helps my debate skills, causes me to think hard<br/>
about how to explain something and challenges my dedication to a Zen<br/>
Buddhist philosophy of living. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ren, living and learning here every day....<br/>
