<div id="ygrps-yiv-461660563">That is a really hard situation as most , if not all, judges will side with your husband.<br/>
Can you enroll him in an online school? Not and umbrella school but the online public school.<br/>
Every state is different. In Minnesota one can enroll on online public school.  That may help for now.<br/>
Another thought is that if your kids have already completed the 180 days  they do not need any more this year.<br/>
 Even if dropped they would have legally completed the school year.<br/>
Do you have legal guidance?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261957532">I live in Fl and I can tell you that there are MANY choices for on-line<br/>
schools here and they are free.  Not the best thing but in this case they<br/>
would still be in your home and you can and do have the influence more than<br/>
a school where your kid is and you are not some 7 hours a day.  It would be<br/>
the second thing I did after hiring my own attorney.  It&#39;s VERY easy to<br/>
homeschool/unschool here in Florida and you don&#39;t have to enroll or keep<br/>
attendance.  This is likely why you were dropped.  I simply send a letter<br/>
each year to the school board telling them I&#39;m homeschooling and keep a<br/>
portfolio for review at the District&#39;s whim but by a teacher of my choosing.<br/>

Since then my ex-husband,my son&#39;s father who hasn&#39;t been around decided all of a sudden after 8 1/2 years decided to sue me for custody, saying I illegally removed him from school, I&#39;ve even had CPS called, which they closed it; then the school board, turancy, and the school principal of the local school showed up. Which they were enrolled in a &quot;private&quot; school there for didn&#39;t pertain to them. But then my ex-husband&#39;s attorney requested records then she turned around and dropped my kids. My kids even though don&#39;t have to legally follow compusary attendence completed 180 days on March 8th; she droped them April 2nd. I tried to find another local unschoolers to enroll them in, but wasn&#39;t able to find one. I figured I had until the following school year to find another one. But then had the school board show up and tell me that if I din&#39;t enroll them I&#39;d face turancy. (Going from public school to homeschool is 30days, but going back is only 3 days. I feel my kids and I have been justly wronged on so many levels. Hoping someone can help with some answers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188854410">An unschooling mom might ask herself: how is she spending her time with her children each day no matter what else is happening in their world? Does this mean the dad is not supportive and will have the children part of the time, not unschooling?  How wil she make that work for the kids?<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me it&#39;s not the best use of this list (or a free umbrella) to air legal grievances and seek free legal advice?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825572228">They said that it doesn&#39;t matter they completed their 180 days, they said it would be if a family moved from out of state, even they may be done with school there because they came here they&#39;d have to enroll their child for the rest of the year. It&#39;s only for like 3 weeks. I was looking at an online class, but I wanted to avoid that, I wanted to unschool them; enrolling them in a public school online defeates the purpose.Unfortunatly no I don&#39;t have any legal guidance.<br/>

Yes, thank you, JJ, I stopped reading the &quot;quick answers&quot; thread and didn&#39;t realize this was in the middle of it, sorry y&#39;all. <br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t intended as a source for legal advice or information on handling local problems - local and legal sources are better for that, although folks are free to post links or email them to the OP. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>******************<br/>
<br/>
Its not always possible for a family to unschool. High stress, medical issues, family dysfunction and, yes, divorce can be big big barriers to unschooling. I&#39;ve dealt with some of those over the course of Ray&#39;s life (he&#39;s my stepson) and its hard. One of the hardest things is stepping away from hopes and dreams of homeschooling and unschooling and looking at relationships - what&#39;s going to help him have a *better* relationship with us, with his bio-mom, and with himself. Unschooling hasn&#39;t always been the best option. <br/>
<br/>
But even when unschooling isn&#39;t possible, or isn&#39;t a good option, the principles of living kindly and supportively with other people (including children) are Always possible. The underlying principles of radical unschooling transcend education and even childhood. If you&#39;re in the position of needing to put kids in school for awhile, be supportive, be kind, be proactive. Help kids get in a routine so its not *such* an agony to go. Help them with homework, even do it for them if they want you to do that! Be their number one advocate, their safe space, their trusted assistant. <br/>
