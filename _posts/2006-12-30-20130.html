<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111060900">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Since Feb 2003, I have been posting an &quot;Unschooling Quote of the Week&quot; to my <br/>
unschooling group (www.SUNetwork.com ) and Altlearn Network <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AltlearnMapNetwork@yahoogroups.com">AltlearnMapNetwork@yahoogroups.com</a> ), Slowly more and more people have <br/>
wanted it that arent on my lists- and I have been sending it to them <br/>
manually.<br/>
<br/>
So now I have set up a yahoo group so anyone can join and get the quotes- if <br/>
you would like to join, please do so!<br/>
<br/>
Here is this week&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...the ability to start out upon your own impulse is fundamental to the<br/>
gift of keeping going upon your own terms, not to mention the further and<br/>
more fulfilling gift of getting again all over again -- never resting upon<br/>
the oars of success or in the doldrums of disappointment, but<br/>
getting renewed and revived by some further transformation.<br/>
<br/>
Getting started, keeping going, getting started again -- in art and in life,<br/>
it seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of<br/>
achievement but of survival, the ground of convinced action, the basis of<br/>
self-esteem and the guarantee of credibility in your lives,<br/>
credibility to yourselves as well as to others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
