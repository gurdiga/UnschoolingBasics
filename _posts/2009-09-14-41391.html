<div id="ygrps-yiv-81818810">&lt;&lt;Life has consequences. I&#39;ve never had the luxury of being sheltered from<br/>
those consequences, so I&#39;m more aware than most.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be very careful about making statements like this.  Just me...here&#39;s my<br/>
&quot;CV of Suffering&quot; (bah I haven&#39;t ever listed this out before)<br/>
<br/>
My father left when I was about 10 and didn&#39;t pay child support.<br/>
My mother worked her ass off but we were still dirt poor.<br/>
My mother was off and on suicidal.<br/>
We were latchkey kids.<br/>
For a while we lived with a guy my mother was dating who I now know was a<br/>
pedophile (his own daughter.)<br/>
My first boyfriend raped me when I was 2 weeks shy of 18, because my hymen<br/>
didn&#39;t break he assumed I wasn&#39;t a virgin and tore into me.<br/>
He raped me repeatedly, (usually anally) to punish me for transgressions I<br/>
could never predict.<br/>
He forced me to perform oral sex and swallow the ejaculate.  Gagging got me<br/>
a beating.  (20 yrs later I still can&#39;t get past that one.)<br/>
I got repeated infections from the rape and sexual practices, we did not<br/>
have health care.  I had to clear them with cranberry juice.<br/>

Interstitial Cystitis<br/>
Kidney stones<br/>
Pleurisy<br/>
Cardiac involvement<br/>
Eating disorders<br/>
BDD<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
I could go on but that&#39;s enough.  I don&#39;t marinate in my &quot;issues&quot; it doesn&#39;t<br/>
help me move forward or feel good.  But I&#39;ve been poor.  I&#39;ve been abused.<br/>
I&#39;ve got issues...we all do.  There are people on this list who have lost<br/>
spouses and children.  Things that make &quot;suffering&quot; seem very subjective and<br/>
trivial.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t discount your knowledge, just don&#39;t make it seem like everyone here<br/>
has lead a charmed life.  Many of us are here BECAUSE we&#39;ve had enough of<br/>
the ugly...we were ourselves the &quot;victims&quot; of oppression by one or more<br/>
people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074767945">I&#39;ve never suffered to that extent, I&#39;ll admit. I&#39;m sorry you lived through all that and I wish I could take away all that pain. I can&#39;t, but I wish I could. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been through some serious episodes of hell. Most of which I could have avoided if I&#39;d been better informed and if I hadn&#39;t had to learn through the school of hard knocks. I believe in the power of education and honesty and logical consequences - on the logic that a small bump, early on, saves you a hard fall later on. Makes you more aware. <br/>
 <br/>
Again, I&#39;m VERY sorry you went through all that. <br/>
