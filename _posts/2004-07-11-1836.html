<br/>
  It does not shock me though, many here have said something to the <br/>

place to go regardless of the situation because it is negativly <br/>
effecting my childs emotions. It seems to me some here are extream, <br/>
I am sorry but no single person comes before everyone else in my <br/>
world. Hubby is in the military, sometimes it seems like we do not <br/>

like people are being selfish and teaching that to their children <br/>
and that seems very unhealth to us. We believe in self sacrifice. <br/>

 Not everyone is going to agree on everything all the time. And not <br/>

Hi, Kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
I think you are reacting to my post about NVC?  If so, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
clarify what I am saying if you&#39;d find that helpful.  I think it is<br/>
unhealthy for my children or me to be responsible for making each other feel<br/>
a certain way.  I see this situation with my sister and her 4 year old<br/>
daughter, for example, where my sister will say &quot;She (dd) won&#39;t LET me do<br/>
such and such a thing!&quot;  My sister lets herself be held hostage by her<br/>
child&#39;s emotions.  That is not healthy communication in my opinion.  It is<br/>
emotional bondage due to poor boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings (in fact,<br/>
quite the opposite!  I am a very sensitive &quot;feeling&quot; type person) or that I<br/>
don&#39;t encourage and model to my children to care about the feelings of<br/>
others.  For example, lately my daughter has picked up from her cousin this<br/>
sort of thing where they get mad at each other and they say &quot;Well, then I<br/>
won&#39;t come to you birthday party!  I won&#39;t be your friend anymore!&quot; and I am<br/>
in there saying &quot;Those sound like the kinds of words that are meant to hurt<br/>
people&#39;s feelings, not communicate how you are feeling or ideas about how to<br/>
resolve this.  I&#39;d like to hear words that talk about how you are feeling or<br/>
ideas on how to solve teh conflict.  Can you please use those?&quot;  And I model<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Does that distinction make any sense to you?<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that each person&#39;s emotions are &quot;their own problems&quot;, but I<br/>
do think it&#39;s important that each of us in our family own our emotions as<br/>
our own in order to communicate in a healthy, effective way about them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;ve gotten it wrong.  What I have seen being written is more <br/>
along the lines of you cannot &quot;make&quot; anyone feel anything.  The only <br/>
person who can feel that emotion is yourself.... nobody can physically <br/>
MAKE you feel a certain way.  I could jump out of a closet and yell <br/>
&quot;Boo!&quot; but whether you get scared or not is physically up to you and <br/>
you alone.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t be made to feel happy or sad or angry BY anyone.  Only you <br/>
can choose to have those feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I did not see anyone write anything along the lines of &quot;say and do <br/>
whatever the you feel like and to hell with being kind.&quot;  That&#39;s not <br/>
what was being said.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [So you would be ok with your child makeing someone else feel badly <br/>
&gt; and you would not expect<br/>
&gt; or encourage them to make it better? ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, my child cannot &quot;make&quot; someone else feel ..... anything.  If <br/>
they did hurt someone&#39;s feelings I would likely (and privately) point <br/>
it out to them that their words can have an effect on people, but I <br/>
would not expect or encourage them to &quot;make it better&quot;.  That&#39;s <br/>
impossible.  You simply cannot make anything all better for anyone but <br/>
yourself.  Saying &#39;sorry&#39; can sometimes help to make amends but ONLY if <br/>
the apology is heartfelt and never cajoled or demanded.<br/>
<br/>
Modeling the behavior is the most effective way for your child to learn <br/>
socially acceptable ways of speaking and acting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [That would mean that each persons emotions are their own problems,<br/>
&gt; including the childs? ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not suggest that emotions are &quot;problems&quot; actually.  They are <br/>
what they are.  Feelings and emotions are part of every human... not <br/>
problems to be fixed, per se.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [... we feel that it is respectable to try and make those<br/>
&gt; around us smile, specially when we do something to make them sad,<br/>
&gt; even if we did not mean it. ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is not realistic or healthy.  Respectability is highly debatable <br/>
anyway.  Lots of &quot;respectable&quot; people do nasty things every day.  <br/>
Trying to teach your child that THEY are responsible for another <br/>
person&#39;s happiness is soooo not cool.  We see the effects of that every <br/>
week on Oprah and Dr. Phil and through all the people in therapy.  It <br/>
is just not physically possible to make other people happy.  If it were <br/>
then there would never be any disagreements or wars.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [ It does not shock me though, many here have said something to the<br/>
&gt; effect of kicking out a single mother and her 4 year old son with no<br/>
&gt; place to go regardless of the situation because it is negativly<br/>
&gt; effecting my childs emotions. ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not reason enough for you???  Your child&#39;s emotional and mental <br/>
health is placed *below* your (chosen) obligation to this woman?  It&#39;s <br/>
not like anyone suggested that you tell her to leave just out of the <br/>
blue, ya know.  Over and over you have written about all the mean <br/>
things she has done and said (screaming and yelling, guilt trips, <br/>
pouting, name calling, spanking her child, demanding rides, etc.).  WHY <br/>
would you continue to support her if it is driving you crazy and you <br/>
feel that she&#39;s wrong?  None of us here could know what this woman was <br/>
doing or not doing if you weren&#39;t hear telling us about it.  You were <br/>
looking for input and advice;  it was given;  you chose to ignore it.  <br/>
That&#39;s your prerogative, but don&#39;t come back acting like we&#39;re torch <br/>
carrying villagers demanding you to &quot;oust the ogre&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [I am sorry but no single person comes before everyone else in my<br/>
&gt; world. ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?!?  Wow.  It is hard for me to imagine that.  So....then to <br/>
you... your child doesn&#39;t rank higher than me?  Than a random guy in <br/>
the grocery store?  Than ANYBODY?  That&#39;s hard for me to wrap my mind <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [Hubby is in the military, sometimes it seems like we do not<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YOU might believe in it.  Your DH might believe in it.  Your DD needn&#39;t <br/>
be forced to live it.  Her needs, her self esteem, and her spirit do <br/>
not have to be &quot;sacrificed&quot; in order for others to live how they chose <br/>
to live.  She deserves more from you and I *really* hope that I have <br/>
read your post all wrong.<br/>

I am really enjoying and appreciating your postings about specific NVC<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The people strapping bombs to their chests and walking into shopping malls<br/>
believe in self sacrifice too. It is not a belief that necessarily has<br/>
universally positive results.<br/>
<br/>
Many people are Unschooling in the Military, including folks who are serving<br/>
in Germany and elsewhere OS. Please don&#39;t imply that those of us who are not<br/>
are somehow being teaching selfishness because we put our own children first<br/>
in their own homes.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that there are self-centered parents in the world. (My dh&#39;s<br/>
parents probably take the prize for that.) Their children grow up feeling<br/>
secondary and less than, and it takes work to undo - but they don&#39;t all grow<br/>
up feeling like they should be *more* important than other people. <br/>

I agree with what you are saying about feelings are<br/>
your own.  i try to instill in my children that they<br/>
have only 2 &quot;rules&quot; in our family, kindness and<br/>
safety, this encompasses alot and they are encouraged<br/>
to think and decide for themselves if what they are<br/>
doing/saying is kind and safe.  I think being<br/>
responsible for others reactions and feelings is very<br/>
unhealthy but being responsible for your actions and<br/>
words is the key.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715562052">When I first started to change the way I parent Tyler<br/>
(about 9 years ago) my ex-husband was befuddled by the<br/>
idea of responsibility for feelings. He just couldn&#39;t<br/>
get his mind around the idea that we aren&#39;t<br/>
responsible for anyone else&#39;s happiness or<br/>
unhappiness. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have the words to<br/>
communicate what I meant back then so we tended to<br/>
just go around and around. What I would say to him<br/>
now, if he ever asked �which he won&#39;t, but that&#39;s<br/>
beside the point ; ) :<br/>
<br/>
Noone is EVER resonsible for anyone else&#39;s happiness<br/>
or unhappiness. We are each only responsible for our<br/>
own emotions-- BUT that responsibility starts with<br/>
being conscious of our every thought, word or action<br/>
that we let out into the world. We must weigh those<br/>
very carefully before letting them out. That is our<br/>
ultimate responsibility, to be true to life and true<br/>
to love as much as possible. To own our mistakes<br/>
graciously, to not hold the past (even the immediate<br/>
past...as in a dozen broken eggs or a smashed up car<br/>
or hateful words) against one another. To try even<br/>
harder next time. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that we don&#39;t have our reactions in<br/>
our family. Believe me, we do. We have them and then<br/>
we try to reign the emotions back in and own them as<br/>
our own. We talk about it as calmly as we can. If we<br/>
can&#39;t talk about it calmly, we ask for a break and the<br/>
chance to come back to it when we&#39;ve settled down. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is so important to let our children know<br/>
that we, as adults are fallible...so that they can<br/>
have permission to make their mistakes as well,<br/>
without judgement or condemnation or punishment. But<br/>
if we&#39;re already punishing ourselves, well...of course<br/>
it&#39;ll be heaped on the kids, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been making an effort to point out to Tyler when<br/>
I am being emotional about something that the emotion<br/>
is mine, not his. That I may not like what his<br/>
behavior is...leaving empty popsicle wrappers all over<br/>
the house, eating like a neanderthal, talking back<br/>
sarcastically when I ask him for help with<br/>
something...but I love him and I want us to be able to<br/>
continue to grow together, to learn to communicate in<br/>
more and more healthy ways. I also tell him that I&#39;m<br/>
trying to learn not to have the same old reactions.<br/>
Inevitalbly he lets me know that he&#39;s also trying to<br/>
remember to change his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting is just such a hard job. Every single day<br/>
some major pattern I have carried forward from my own<br/>
childhood gets challenged and I have to work to<br/>
surrender my need to control and to be right. I try to<br/>
remind myself that it&#39;s a hard job for Tyler to be my<br/>
kid, because so often I have parented him using such<br/>
old tapes...outdated information, habitual and<br/>
reactive. Lila who is one will have a slightly easier<br/>
time of it because I&#39;ve learned so much of what not to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, even the things that I thought I&#39;d gotten<br/>
past will arise if I&#39;m overtired or not making time<br/>
for my own needs to be met.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>

&gt; on because we feel that it is respectable to try and<br/>
&gt; make those <br/>
&gt; around us smile, specially when we do something to<br/>
&gt; make them sad, <br/>
&gt; even if we did not mean it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It does not shock me though, many here have said<br/>
&gt; something to the <br/>
&gt; effect of kicking out a single mother and her 4 year<br/>
&gt; old son with no <br/>
&gt; place to go regardless of the situation because it<br/>
&gt; is negativly <br/>
&gt; effecting my childs emotions. It seems to me some<br/>
&gt; here are extream, <br/>
&gt; I am sorry but no single person comes before<br/>
&gt; everyone else in my <br/>
&gt; world. Hubby is in the military, sometimes it seems<br/>
&gt; like we do not <br/>
&gt; even live in the same world so many others here do.<br/>
&gt; To us, it looks <br/>
&gt; like people are being selfish and teaching that to<br/>
&gt; their children <br/>
&gt; and that seems very unhealth to us. We believe in<br/>
&gt; self sacrifice. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Not everyone is going to agree on everything all<br/>
&gt; the time. And not <br/>
&gt; everything works for everyone all the time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453768851">I do have to comment here.  I have signed off other<br/>
email unschooling lists because of the kind of jumping<br/>
on wording and a harsh judgemental atmosphere.  I like<br/>
to have a respectful and non judging atmosphere and a<br/>
forum to not be afraid to put out ideas and ask<br/>
questions without fear of being judged.  We are all<br/>
trying to do our best with our children and i think<br/>
when we share our experiences it is very helpful, but<br/>
i will have to sign off this list also if it becomes a<br/>
jump on people and judge thing instead of a &quot;this is<br/>
what works for me in my family&quot; .  We are all on a<br/>
journey and it will take twists and turns and<br/>
rethinking and rethinking again but i feel that it is<br/>
best done in an atmosphere of love and caring and<br/>
attraction not promotion.  Every family is different<br/>
and what works in one wont always work in another.  I<br/>
know email sometimes comes out harsher than it is<br/>
meant to and without the warmth that it is intended.  <br/>
<br/>
i have noticed a negative and judging feeling thing<br/>
out there on this list and wonder if i am the only one<br/>
feeling this.  I am very confident in my lifestyle<br/>
choice and family philosophy but if i was new in<br/>
establishing this i would definately be afraid to ask<br/>
the questions if i thought i would be slammed<br/>
verbally.  <br/>

Thanks Dina, I am sure you represent many on the list.  I do agree, but<br/>
for the sake of the writers who may not write with warmth and seem<br/>
blunt, they may not have the time to write with that much consciousness,<br/>
or don&#39;t write very well.writing is so different than speaking<br/>
especially in a subject area that can have so many interpretations! I<br/>
have to say that the folks who feel judged should also look at<br/>
themselves and ask if they are maybe being sensitive.  Honesty can be<br/>
hard to digest (My dp was brutally honest, and I have had to show him<br/>
how he can be both honest and kind), and then we react by speaking from<br/>
a place of hurt and frustration rather than compassion.  There are<br/>
things that get said on this list that I don&#39;t agree with or that I<br/>
react very strongly to.  It&#39;s my reaction that I have to be careful of.<br/>
Just hitting reply without thinking for a little bit (how my words<br/>
affect others)can lead to some feet in the mouth problems.  Some of the<br/>
more experienced folks here have probably been giving advice for a long<br/>
time, and may forget what it is like to have no experience yet of what<br/>
unschooling really means, and how righteous it can sound (yes, I love<br/>
you guys, but sometimes you do sound righteous). That being said, there<br/>
are indeed some writers who could learn to put more compassion in their<br/>
writing, and less criticism, even if they are discouraged or in<br/>
disagreement.  We are all striving for the same outcome, but we are<br/>
diverse.  The only reason we are here, officially, is to talk about<br/>
unschooling.a subject that can be interpreted differently, in subtle<br/>
ways, or work a little differently in each household.<br/>

  I was on a list at one time (unschooling) with a very popular <br/>
individual on that list.  I said the wrong thing and got slammed <br/>
(flamed?) big time.  So I am sometimes hesitant to ask or even <br/>
respond to anyones questions.  But so far on this list I haven&#39;t had <br/>
any trouble (THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THAT!)  Maybe everyone doesn&#39;t <br/>
agree with everyone, but it seems to me the majority do their best to <br/>
just help with the unschooling process, and help direct each other in <br/>
the right direction. <br/>
If you haven&#39;t been here very long, stay alittle longer, so far its <br/>
been good for our family, and me, the one who reads all this stuff <br/>
all the time<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307060666">Dina and Andrea, thank you both for posting about this. I have not <br/>
caught up yet, and in fact wish to go back over some posts in a <br/>
moment. But I wanted to post because you both touched on some things <br/>
that I and others have been feeling but have not been brave enough <br/>
to post about. Many of us are knew to this and feel jumped on. I <br/>
know I in turn felt that way and jumped back. It was not right of me <br/>
and I am sorry. <br/>
<br/>
 &quot;then we react by speaking from a place of hurt and frustration <br/>
rather than compassion.&quot; --- That was me when I started this thread, <br/>
and I hope to not do that again. <br/>
<br/>
  When the advice seems laced with poison, not even intended, it is <br/>
hard to get past. I find that in some groups people post more to see <br/>
themselves talk and to have others agree than to really help people. <br/>
But I might be seeing that wrong as well. Either way, I am not <br/>
leaving, because learning to do the best for my child is more <br/>
important then my feelings or pride right now. <br/>
<br/>
  -sigh- internet communication is not easy. <br/>

nice that you posted a private message to the list-- didnt think that as  <br/>
allowed either- and yes to me  i did nothing wrong- but i guess since  private e <br/>
mails are posted public fine-- i thought this was a place to learn  about  <br/>
unschooling etc, i guess it is turning into something i dont wand to  be part of. <br/>
 I will have to muddle my way thru alone if this is how it is--  anyone <br/>
wishing to continue this thread will have to e mail me personally i am  off this <br/>
list .<br/>
i was here for my kids and maybe to help a little but i guess that was too  <br/>
much to ask for.<br/>
feel free to unsub me from any other lists you are moderating.<br/>

Could you please write out what you want and don&#39;t want from this <br/>
group? I ask this because you seem very unhappy with what you are <br/>
getting out of this group and yet you say you&#39;re going to stay.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to get you to leave, really! Not my place, I&#39;m just a <br/>
newbie. I do think that you should be able to have a virtual <br/>
community that gives you what you want. There are a ton of parenting <br/>
groups on Yahoo. There are many support groups, where people will <br/>
support you where you are today and not tell you to change. There are <br/>
lots of ways to learn about unschooling/mindful parenting without <br/>
posting about your family. This is a discussion group and you will <br/>
ALWAYS hear &quot;do it in a more unschooling way&quot; as the answer to <br/>
problems you post. If you complain about that, yeh, people aren&#39;t <br/>
going to be extremely supportive in response. <br/>
<br/>
It was hard for me to go from AP support lists to unschooling <br/>
discussions lists--very different. I considered giving up, esp. since <br/>
my kids are so young. But now I&#39;m okay with the style of these <br/>
groups. I would not have stayed if I were unhappy! I don&#39;t think I <br/>
can do the best for my kids if I am feeling bad about where I am. I <br/>
want to change how I&#39;m parenting, yes, but I can do that without guilt<br/>
or other negative emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Kimmy, I hope this group can work for you, I really do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51343355">I have to admit that I almost unsubbed from this list also.  I&#39;m so  glad <br/>
that I didn&#39;t.  But the way I handle it for now is to take note of  whose posting <br/>

different ways by different people.  Usually the advise is the  same but the tone is <br/>
different.  I read the posts from those who are more  helpful for me <br/>
personally and skip the posts from those who make me have  negative feelings.  No one <br/>

To Ren and all... Thank you so much for doing this.  Unschooling is  changing <br/>
