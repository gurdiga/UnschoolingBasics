<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268876123">My 11 year old dd announced today that homeschooling was boring and <br/>
that she wanted to go to school. I aksed her why she felt that way <br/>
and she explained that she doesn&#39;t see kids her own age and in <br/>
school she would get to do things like go on field trips and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be confined to the house. I reminded her that she isn&#39;t <br/>
confined to the house and that we do lots of stuff field trip wise. <br/>
I explained that we live in a wonderful area where if she had an <br/>
interest we could follow it and find something fun to do or see. She <br/>
replied that she &quot;doesn&#39;t know&quot; what she wants to do (imagine that <br/>
said in a whine). I made mild suggestions that were all met with <br/>
a &quot;not interested&quot;. I also told her that if she was interested in <br/>
school we could arrange for her to follow another student around for <br/>
a day. She doesn&#39;t want to do that either. I made suggestions about <br/>
ways to meet other kids her age (park days, sports, co-ops, clubs or <br/>
classes- I mean the opportunities are endless!), but she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want any of that either!!! It&#39;s like she&#39;s thristy but refuses to <br/>
drink anything despite the water I offer.<br/>
<br/>
Now you have to understand that dd is a mild mannered, somewhat <br/>
reserved child. She and I get along wonderfully.Whining isn&#39;t her <br/>
thing. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is a result of not <br/>
being able to see her best friend as often as in the past. We used <br/>
to get together with best friends family once a week, but now bf&#39;s <br/>
mother is doing a more rigid school style and our meetings will be <br/>
sporadic at best. I&#39;ve told her that she can still write or email <br/>
best friend to feel closer to her. But the fact is that dd doesn&#39;t <br/>
have many friends her age. She has a few homeschooled friends that <br/>
we see once in awhile because I try to arrange playdates, etc. We <br/>
play outside, but there aren&#39;t any girls her age in the neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
What do I do unschooling wise when she is bored or lonely? Any <br/>
suggestion I make is met with an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Is she just <br/>
overwhelmed with choices? Should I sign her up for a class despite <br/>
her protests? ACK!! Please help! Any insights or advice would be so <br/>
welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082012578">You know what struck me about all the options? That they all require  <br/>
a lot of our kids, scheduled times, requirements for attendance,  <br/>
rules and formalities, not to mention the preformed groups that  <br/>
already exist.  What about taking her to a perfect swing (or whatever  <br/>
family fun center you have?) or the movies, or just the mall. Hang  <br/>
out in the arcade at any of those places. My girls love to just go to  <br/>
the mall, they do NOT like going someplace to meet specific people or  <br/>
do specific things. They usually wind up meeting with someone, and  <br/>
having a good time, with no expectations or requirements for ever  <br/>
talking to that person again. Of course, it usually takes an hour or  <br/>
two of hanging out before they get out and do something, so it&#39;s  <br/>
definitely an investment in time.<br/>
Just something I noted...hope you KWIM<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Would you like it if someone signed you up for a class even after you<br/>
sais that you weren&#39;t interested?  She has interests.  All kids do.<br/>
Some are just harder to recognize than others.  What is she doing when<br/>
she is &quot;bored at home?&quot;  Are you doing this with her or watching from<br/>
the sidelines saying, &quot;I wish she would DO something&quot;?  What are you<br/>
doing to make your life look richer and fuller?  Are you participating<br/>
in your passions?  Does she see you do this?  What is something that<br/>
you have wanted to do?  Maybe that &quot;paint your own ceramics studio&quot; or<br/>
&quot;free day at the art museum&quot;  Make plans to go and then say, &quot;Hey, the<br/>
art museum is having a free day and there is a Salvador Dali<br/>
expedition - you know the melting clock guy.  I was thinking of going<br/>
on Tuesday, wanna come along?&quot;  If she says no, then go without her.<br/>
Next time she may want to go (especially if you bring back some cool<br/>
free literature or postcards or something.)  Most of the time when I<br/>
mention that I am going off to do something (hike in the woods, go to<br/>
the cultural center, walk the mall, go thrift store shopping, go on a<br/>
&quot;pelican hunt&quot; ( Pensacola has artistic pelican statues all over<br/>
downtown), head to the health food store, etc.) I get a chorus of &quot;Oh<br/>
I want to go!&quot;  Sometimes they all come sometimes only one or two<br/>
come.  I do the same thing when I am doing stuff around the house.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to bake some cookies.  Anyone want to join in?&quot;  or &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
going to make some cards, care to join?&quot;  We are always going to the<br/>
video store for new movies to watch together (we&#39;ve been on a Johnny<br/>
Depp and Tom Hanks kick lately - although not together sadly).<br/>
<br/>
Fill your life up and let her know that she can join you.  Look for<br/>
things that aren&#39;t &quot;join in&quot; activities outside the house if she is<br/>
more reserved.  Our local &quot;arts center&quot; has a &quot;Friday night try me<br/>
night&quot; periodically and all kinds of artisans are there doing<br/>
different things.  Maybe it is making glass beads or glass blowing or<br/>
paper mache or weaving.  It&#39;s sort of a cross between artists &quot;showing<br/>
off&quot; and &quot;hands on displays&quot;  There are little cafes near by where you<br/>
can pick up a meal and walk down to the center.  She might like<br/>
one-on-one connections with someone who is doing something she likes<br/>
rather than a class.<br/>
