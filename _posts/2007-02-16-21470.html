 </span></blockquote>My son, who is 9, has the most amazing conversations with me, must often <br/>
they are about Pokemon or Digimon or whatever game he is playing at that <br/>
moment. And they are filled, not only with detail, but with such excitement <br/>
over the subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
Actually a couple of weeks ago I met a really nice boy who talked to me <br/>
about Warhammer for about half an hour. Nothing else, just Warhammer. And it <br/>
was brilliant, he told me about the stats and some specific battles he&#39;d <br/>
been in with a mutual friend. I could imagine the battle and, more than <br/>
that, he could see all of these characters as he spoke, and his face was <br/>
alight with excitement<br/>
<br/>
When he got up to go do something else I said to his mother &quot;Wow, that was <br/>
wonderful.&quot; and she said &quot;It&#39;s hard to believe he wouldn&#39;t talk to people a <br/>
year and a half ago.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At 3 1/2 and 4 3/4 I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to think outside of their own <br/>
interests. At 38 I still like to talk about my interests and, while I can <br/>
become interested in many things, certain subjects like soccer or cricket or <br/>
how well someone&#39;s child is doing in school, can often leave me cold. <br/>
Talking about what interests you is really the best part of conversation, <br/>
and as his interests begin to incorporate other things so will his <br/>
conversations. Maybe you should just figure out ways to like what he&#39;s <br/>
talking about more &lt;g&gt;. And heck knights and space are pretty amazing topics <br/>
of conversation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741329959">I don&#39;t think that his conversational ability is<br/>
really a problem.  Because of this &quot;inability&quot; to pick<br/>
up on when someone isn&#39;t interested in his topic of<br/>
choice (at age 4), he has been put in a special ed<br/>
preschool -- even though he has now been identified as<br/>
gifted in various areas.   This is the ENTIRE reason<br/>
that I am ready to start unschooling. (I haven&#39;t<br/>
officially started yet.  My husband wants us to wait<br/>
until the end of the school year to withdraw them for<br/>
various reasons, but we are attempting to make our<br/>
homelife as unschooling as possible.)  <br/>
    I don&#39;t think that he feels bad about not &quot;being<br/>
able&quot; to have conversations, because we don&#39;t focus on<br/>
it at home.  I just talk to him about what he is<br/>
interested in and work on actively listening and<br/>
asking any questions that I might have and answering<br/>
all of the questions that he constantly has.  You<br/>
know, modeling normal conversations.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
this fits with the unschooling way, but I hope so.  <br/>
<br/>
  By the way, I only add the mention of giftedness to<br/>
show how wrong his assignment to a special ed<br/>
classroom is.  And I only had him evaluated for<br/>
giftedness because of various behavior problems that<br/>
have come from his high level of boredom in the<br/>
classroom (he is reading on a late first-grade level<br/>
and the teachers are focusing on much lower level<br/>
activities).  He actually says that he has a bad day<br/>
every day and fights going to school.  Anyway, sorry<br/>
for the tangent, but I just wanted to explain myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189144071">We have been trying to help him focus on what he DID<br/>
like during the day and trying to help him explain<br/>

    As far as which is more important, my husband&#39;s<br/>
reasons for waiting to withdraw him from school or<br/>
son&#39;s happiness ... these are questions that I worry<br/>
about constantly.  but ... my husband was at first<br/>
VERY against any type of homeschooling, especially<br/>
unschooling, but he is changing his mind.  It is<br/>
interesting how some people disgest new information. <br/>
I like to have all of the details and really<br/>
understand it and then I can make a decision, as<br/>
quickly as possible (almost obsessively my husband<br/>
says).  My husband likes to make a decision, then<br/>
learn more about the topic (if he has to) and then he<br/>
can rethink his original decision.  Knowing this<br/>
pattern of his, he has finally disgested enough<br/>
information and has really taken the time to get to<br/>
know our oldest better and is starting to change his<br/>
mind and agree with me on unschooling.  It&#39;s hard for<br/>
him, he was raised with very negative parents who did<br/>
not believe in him and he really wants our boys to<br/>
have every educational option available to them (which<br/>
in my husband&#39;s eyes means required college) that this<br/>
change to a non-traditional educational paradigm is<br/>
very difficult.  Anyway, at least progress is<br/>
happening.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514154271">My oldest (who is now 12) did have a problem with this. I would go so far as to say he <br/>
struggled with it, because other children aren&#39;t as forgiving as adults when a child <br/>
continues on in his interests. They don&#39;t want to hear someone else go on and on without <br/>
consideration to their POV. So he lost a lot of potential friends, and got his feelings hurt <br/>
when people walked away from him. He really could not stop talking about his interest <br/>
long enough to say &#39;Why are you walking away?&quot;  He was very depressed because he <br/>
wanted friends and no children wanted him. <br/>
<br/>
We have always accepted his interests and we talk about them. I have done research and <br/>
read books so I know what he&#39;s talking about (even more difficult now that he&#39;s 12 and <br/>
bypassed me in all ways technical) So he&#39;s learned the back-and-forth within his interests. <br/>
When he was about seven or eight, he was capable of dealing with me making connecting <br/>
comments like &quot;Oh, this is kind of like in MY hobby, when we do this&quot; (before then, any <br/>
comment offtopic of his interest was ignored or sparked a severe violent meltdown). By me <br/>
modeling how to ask questions and be interested, he did learn how to do that. I did say to <br/>
him &quot;Sometimes people want you to be interested in their stuff too, it makes for better <br/>
conversation&quot; We actually played games in how things are connected, because his brain <br/>
didn&#39;t see connections like &quot;How is this pen and this cap connected? The cap goes on the <br/>
pen.&quot; He couldn&#39;t do that at all, and if you can&#39;t connect a physical thing like that, how can <br/>
you connect concepts like, if I&#39;m talking about cars to a barber while getting my hair cut, <br/>
what are some things HE might know? Could I ask him what kind of car he drives?<br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense? When you talk about it happening naturally, I think natural is so <br/>
varied, from person to person. With my other kids, they learned conversation skills very <br/>
early and very well, without any help. Josh really really needed help to get those fine tuned <br/>
skills. And my Breanna, who has autism, needs LOTS of practice to get the fundamentals <br/>
of communication down, just asking for help is a hardship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124496275">Thank you for your honesty.  I had never thought about<br/>
it like that before, but I completely agree that this<br/>
is the message that I have been sending.  How sad!  I<br/>
grew up in a family that had the &quot;suck it up&quot;<br/>
mentality -- which I hated -- and I definitely don&#39;t<br/>
want to put my son through the same feelings of<br/>
loneliness.  Thanks again for you straightforwardness<br/>
in showing me his point of view.<br/>

sooner than the end of the school year. :)<br/>
