just exactly how they&#39;ve unschooled all along without any problems <br/>
with the state. It is doable.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339074258">Hi Wendy,<br/>
There are unschoolers in NY.  What part of the state are you considering? <br/>
<br/>
As for how we do it...some choose to go under ground...others use very vague general educationalist type language in the reports which satisfy the regs.   I am exploring the peer review option versus testing which begins in the later years and am hopeful that my local district may be accepting of this.  We did do a test that was at home and not timed and open book and after the initial intrigue and joy of trying something new, it was stressful for my dd and did stilt her love of learning for a short while.  Fortunately we are not required to test every year.  I will have to address this directly next year.<br/>
<br/>
From my experience, it really depends on the school district you report to as to how accepting they are to homeschoolers in general and how tough they want to make your life.  Occasionally i hear of districts that attempt to over step their boundaries and if you are not well versed in the regs they can really intimidate a person.  We&#39;ve managed to make it work for us in our local district.  The key is to give them as little as possible.  If you want more info and sample of reports etc. let me know...they are around and helpful in recognizing how simple it can be.  Unfortunately, HSLDA & Leah are in the process, once again, attempting to push through new legislation that has the potential to be very damaging.

<br/>
One of the hardest thing I&#39;ve experienced about being an unschooler in NY is not from the state (as i don&#39;t use that term with anyone in the system) but with some (not all) other homeschooling families who don&#39;t unschool and have strong opinions about what they think is right and wrong and little tolerance for other choices. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745112688">Woodstock has homeschoolers.  Considering the &quot;hippie&quot; alternative/new age nature of the area my guess is you will find unschoolers.  Know of a few unschooling families from Orange County who travel north to Woodstock about an hour from their homes to Trapeze.  <br/>
<br/>
Like anything in the Hudson Valley homeschooling world...getting in the car and traveling an hour is not a big deal, unless of course you are a family of 5  - and then you don&#39;t need to travel too much for the social thang.    Check out the Albany homeschooling groups, Orange County, Dutchess County and even our local group TriCounty Homeschoolers.  Amongst the local homeschooling groups you will find pockets of unschoolers.<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
