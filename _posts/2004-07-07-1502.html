<div id="ygrps-yiv-643972575">I just want to add that for anyone with kids who freak out over winning and<br/>
losing at board games, you can get some fabulous cooperative board games<br/>
from Family Pastimes, a company out of Canada.  Their website is<br/>
www.familypastimes.com  I believe they have a list of US retailers on the<br/>
website, or you can order from them direct.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got the idea from their games, now I can see how we can make just<br/>
about any of our competitive board games cooperative by doing them<br/>
differently and so my kids and I decide how we feel like playing today.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

Basically you take a chair away each time, but not a kid. The idea is that<br/>
they all have to fit on one chair at the end (make it a big one) and that<br/>
climbing on top of each other is fun.<br/>
