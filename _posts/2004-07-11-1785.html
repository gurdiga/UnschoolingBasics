<div id="ygrps-yiv-351417969">&quot;Perhaps some would disagree with me, but I would have separated your<br/>
dd from your ds... but would have tried to not use the separation as<br/>
a punishment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with Nancy.<br/>
<br/>
One of my older children tends to instigate when he&#39;s bored or <br/>
tired. I remind him that if he doesn&#39;t want to contribute to the <br/>
peace and happiness of the other people in the room, that he should <br/>
find another place in the house to be.<br/>
I can be quite forceful if someone is bent on hurting another human <br/>
being in any way. :)<br/>
I don&#39;t punish him, I DO try to maintain the comfort level of the <br/>
other people that don&#39;t deserve his actions.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing one child to make another child miserable, is ignoring our <br/>
duties in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I try to get to the root of the problem, asking him if he needs some <br/>
one on one time, or to get out of the house, or some food...or <br/>
whatever. I think by dialoguing these things it will help him <br/>
eventually notice this behavior rising up and he&#39;ll have ways to <br/>
deal with it before it becomes a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Removing a problem person from the vicinity is how I&#39;d deal with <br/>
anyone that was verbally or physically trying to harm anyone else in <br/>
my family. Heck, sometimes *I* am the one that needs removing, and <br/>
my dh steps in and reminds me to get away from everyone before doing <br/>
something stupid. I have a temper, and I&#39;m not safe around anyone <br/>
when I&#39;m really pissed....so it&#39;s good to have family reminding each <br/>
other when it&#39;s time to take a break. Isolating oneself can be <br/>
really helpful...sometimes our children need a reminder that they <br/>
aren&#39;t safe around other people at that moment.<br/>
