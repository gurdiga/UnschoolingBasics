<div id="ygrps-yiv-499921317">My oldest DS (11) is very dependent upon me. Lately, it&#39;s been <br/>
driving me crazy. He really doesn&#39;t want to do anything for himself. <br/>
If I don&#39;t fix his food, he doesn&#39;t eat. If I don&#39;t wash his <br/>
clothes, they will lay until every single thing he owns is nasty. He <br/>
has projects that he says he want to try, so I help him get started, <br/>
and in 2 minutes he&#39;s saying &quot;I can&#39;t do it&quot;. He has problems with a <br/>
game he&#39;s playing, he gets upset, and doesn&#39;t even try to problem <br/>
solve.<br/>
<br/>
All that was very negative, I realize, but it seems to be a 24-7 <br/>
pattern. I try to give him plenty of time and attention. I offer to <br/>
read to him, play games, or do projects while DS #2 (21 mths) is <br/>
napping and at night. He sometimes accepts and we do things and <br/>
sometimes he continues what he is doing (usually playing PS2). But <br/>
it never fails, when I am doing just about anything, he suddenly <br/>
needs something (a snack made, help finding his shoes, help finding <br/>
a phone number, etc) that he could probably do for himself, if he <br/>
would just try.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be bitter. I pride myself on being an attached <br/>
parent, but sometimes it&#39;s like we&#39;re AP went bad! What can I do to <br/>
encourage him to be more independent while still letting him know <br/>
that I&#39;m here when he needs me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595289979">Sorry Betsy as i don&#39;t have much time to type ( i have an eleven  month old dd and a 4 yo ds) But for me it seems your ds has been feeling a little in need of mommy. I am sure you  are super busy with the 20 month old. I suggest feeling his cup- tending to his needs and engaging him more until his needs for his mommy is met.<br/>
  I also think you are expecting too much form an 11 yo. I think he does need help doing his laundry.<br/>
  sorry <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re probably right, he does need more of my attention. It just <br/>
seems like when I have the time to give it, he has better things to <br/>
do and needs me when I&#39;m engaged in anything else.<br/>
<br/>
And just for clarification, I absolutely don&#39;t expect him to do his <br/>
own laundry. I do, however, think it is an acceptable expectation <br/>
for him to sort his dirty clothes from his clean, so I will know <br/>
what to wash. I woudn&#39;t even care if that were two separate piles in <br/>
the floor, just so that there is a distinction. That was just one <br/>
example, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805110701">Again I have not time...sorry. Just wnated to say a few things that you may be able to do. <br/>
If he is playing his PS2 bring him some goodies in a plate and feed him if he wants to.<br/>
Sit and watch him play. Learn about what he is playing. Play with him or ask him to show you how to play.<br/>
Things like that will make him feel cared for, loved and will fill his cup.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you doing to &quot;help him get started&quot;? Sometimes my stepson <br/>
(13) needs to actually watch someone do something several times, <br/>
and/or get really specific step-by-step instruction several times <br/>
before he feels the confidence to try it himself. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things he&#39;s been learning since he came to live with us <br/>
in November is to make simple foods - we&#39;re talking *really* simple, <br/>
too, like jello. I start out just making things and asking if he&#39;d <br/>
like to watch. After a couple times I&#39;ll ask if he wants to make it <br/>
with help, help me or if I should just do it? Somewhere along the <br/>
line I&#39;ll be in the middle of something and he&#39;ll initiate making it <br/>
himself, but asking me for step-by-step instructions while he&#39;s <br/>
doing it. He can&#39;t stand to read, and doesn&#39;t really listen if I <br/>
read directions to him - I have to paraphrase into something more <br/>
conversational. Eventually he remembers how to do it himself. That&#39;s <br/>
been the progression with soup, mac-n-cheese, and now jello. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you respond in these kinds of situations? Some of this sounds <br/>
like a desire for reassurance that his mom will always &quot;be there&quot; <br/>
for him, so if you are snapping and saying &quot;I&#39;m in the middle of <br/>
something, do it yourself&quot; that only aggravates the need. I try to <br/>
be alert for times when Ray seems to be at a loss and offer to give <br/>
him a hand before he asks - &quot;Do you need a snack? I can get you one <br/>
just as soon as I finish these dishes. What would you like?&quot; There&#39;s <br/>
a big difference in the implications, there. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;m used to keeping in mind wrt my 5yr old, and am <br/>
now having to translate into my thinking about Ray is &quot;autonomy is <br/>
not the same as independence&quot;. I want my kids to be Autonomous, and <br/>
part of what that means is I want them to be able to decide when <br/>
they need help and ask for it. Its possible, when trying to promote <br/>
Independence, to undermine Autonomy - to give the message that <br/>
needing assistance is a bad thing. <br/>

&gt; game he&#39;s playing, he gets upset, and doesn&#39;t even try to problem <br/>
&gt; solve.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Plenty of adults have trouble problem solving. When I worked in a <br/>
fabric shop there were days when it seemed like all I did was help <br/>
other adults figure things out. How do *you* solve problems at home? <br/>
I try to make my internal processes a bit more obvious around my <br/>
kids - talking out loud instead of keeping it all in my head, or <br/>
even bouncing ideas off them the way I would another adult. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007093987">I have an eleven yo (Josh) as well. I think one of the best things about our unschooling is <br/>
that the focus is on relationships, right? So we try to have a relationship where the kids <br/>
WANT to be with us. By spending time with me, they see what I&#39;m doing, they see the <br/>
steps, they have a chance to help if they care to. Very frequently whomever is hanging out <br/>
with me in the kitchen will ask what they can do to help. The model is me, when they are <br/>
having trouble, asking what *I* can do to help. <br/>
<br/>
We may have a different situation, because with so many people in one house, there is the <br/>
expectation that everyone does what they can to help. Children are involved from very <br/>
young, happily, in toting around laundry, stirring food, dusting. If I really want to finish <br/>
something, they know that they have me if they need me, but are just as likely to join in <br/>
when I ask if I can finish something &#39;real quick&#39;. They are with me and I say &quot;Do you mind <br/>
helping me carry this laundry downstairs?&quot; or &quot;Can you stir this sauce while I start the <br/>
water boiling?&quot; That&#39;s an incremental step, but they build up after a while.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is asking for help, I always try to stop right there and help them. Not only are <br/>
you saying that you&#39;re &#39;here to help&#39; (ack...too much koala brothers!), but they are wanting <br/>
to learn right then, and you can step them through. Josh can&#39;t remember phone numbers <br/>
to friends or places, and nearly always needs help finding them in the phone book. He <br/>
knows where to get the phone books, but still needs help finding the specific person or <br/>
place. Sometimes I can talk him through it, sometimes he just needs me there. <br/>
<br/>
I think the hardest part to remember is that they are where they are. Just age should not <br/>
define what one thinks a child should be able to do (and I guess I learned that lesson early <br/>
having a child with autism) It doesn&#39;t matter what an eleven year old &#39;should&#39; be able to do, <br/>
it&#39;s an artificial construct anyway, based on professional opinions of psychologists who&#39;ve <br/>
never met your child. What&#39;s important to look at is what your son CAN do, and how to <br/>
build on that in a supporting manner. It can be hard, I won&#39;t deny that, but often the <br/>
realization that someday they&#39;ll be adults and won&#39;t WANT our help can stifle the bitter <br/>
feelings. I still remember the hurt look on my dad&#39;s face (he&#39;s always one for giving advice, <br/>
whether you want it or not) the day I told him to stop telling me what to do! I was nearly <br/>
25...had four kids and he still couldn&#39;t let go. It&#39;s just as bad to tell a child that they HAVE <br/>
to let go of their parent.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, I tend to ramble when kids don&#39;t want my attentions ;-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331591580">I think that your son is just testing the waters. An almost 2 year old can scoop up a whole 24 hours worth of time and attention in a 2 hour span, and you&#39;re surely tired and stressed, but your older son is expressing his needs in an indirect way. He loves and needs you.<br/>
      I agree with you that he can help with laundry and other chores,too, but you will probably have to give to him before he will be able to reciprocate. The &#39;cup needs filling&#39; is accurate, but what about your cup, Mom? Maybe you could use some time to tend to your needs, as well.<br/>

  than you are yourself, <br/>
and you will not find that person anywhere.<br/>
