<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616320259">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce that early bird registration for Great Big Happy<br/>
Life- An Unschoolers&#39; Conference Retreat will open tomorrow 11/15/08.<br/>
Register from 11/15-12/15 and receive 20% off your registration. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our website is fully up and running and describes lodging, meals program and<br/>
presenters. As with so many other unschooling conferences that have taken<br/>
root in the past few years, this one was inspired by the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference that just had its final magnificent run in September. Great Big<br/>
Happy Life will be a blend of inspirational presentations, awesome<br/>
participant led funshops,  informal discussions, intense relaxation and just<br/>
generally hanging out with other whole life/radical unschooling families.<br/>
There will be fun stuff for families, great opportunities for teens to hang<br/>
and connect, and things to discover for grown-ups and little ones too! We<br/>
are constantly updating our program, which right now includes speakers Dayna<br/>
Martin and Amy Childs. We are getting great feedback from folks about the<br/>
site- and are busy adding events, experiences and presenters to the site! We<br/>
hope you can join us in April!<br/>
