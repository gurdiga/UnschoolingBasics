<div id="ygrps-yiv-706372119">&quot; I was<br/>
wondering if we could talk a bit about contingency plans. What are <br/>
the<br/>
options for taking care that our children can continue Unschooling if<br/>
something were to happen to us? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really lucky that way. I have a dh that completely supports <br/>
unschooling and has agreed the kids will never go to school unless <br/>
they choose it themselves. If I die, he will hire outside help <br/>
occasionally. His schedule allows him to be home a lot, so he would <br/>
have a way to make money and be with the kids most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
If we both die, my sister in Alaska is an unschooler and her and my <br/>
bil have agreed to raise our children should that happen. She has <br/>
three children, so it would be a full house to be sure! But they are <br/>
financially sound and believe in gentle parenting and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of a better back up plan than that! I do realize we are <br/>
extremely fortunate to have such a plan. It gives me a sense of calm <br/>
to know my children would retain their rights and their freedom <br/>
should something happen to us.<br/>
