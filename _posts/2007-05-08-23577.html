I read but rarely post. But I think it is time that I do so. Recently, my<br/>
son (6) and I were in <br/>
a restaurant with a friend. He wanted multiple plates of food, since each<br/>
food was to be <br/>
on a different plate. I supported and assisted him with that. He also<br/>
brought back <br/>
multiple forks, spoons and knives. At this point I noticed my new friend<br/>
glancing at all of <br/>
this activity and I began to hear old tapes in my head like she thinks he<br/>
has too much <br/>
silverware, the restaurant will not like this, now all of this silverware<br/>
needs to be washed. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] What struck me about your posting Joanne is that the problem<br/>
seemed to begin with your own self consciousness?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the meal, not thinking, when the waitress came over I picked<br/>
up my plates <br/>
and scooped up the silverware from next to me on the booth seat. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] So what you forgot to do is to ask your son if he was finished<br/>
before clearing his place.  This makes my husband furious when wait staff<br/>
clears without asking.  I can&#39;t stand when he moves my papers on the desk<br/>
because he wants to use the computer.<br/>
<br/>
Retrospectively I I had <br/>
allowed anxiety to develop due to what I was imagining others thought about<br/>
what was <br/>
going on with my son and then with me that I was not forcing him to stop<br/>
this behavior. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] So your were imagining what others were thinking?  Did anyone<br/>
actually say anything to you?<br/>
<br/>
I <br/>
try to explain to him what people expect in public. (He frequently likes to<br/>
pour slat and <br/>
pepper together, mix water in some other things in front of him on the<br/>
table, etc. IN <br/>
genreal I delight in his creative exploration. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] When my oldest dd was young concoctions at restaurants was one<br/>
of her favorite activities to keep her happy.  The only time the glass or<br/>
bowl was tipped or spilled was when an adult (my mother) intervened thinking<br/>
it was not ok because of her own self consciousness of what others were<br/>
thinking.   I had always made sure to pick up any empty sugar packets so as<br/>
not to create extra work for the wait staff.  In fact, my leaving the table<br/>
orderly follows my own philosophy of leaving a place better than I found it<br/>
- or at the very least, in the Zen buddah tradition &#39;leave no trace.&#39;  As my<br/>
dd&#39;s get older they have embraced this social convention as their own.  My<br/>
younger dd is not as meticulous about her restaurant mess as my older dd was<br/>
and still very much requires multiple plates for each item of food.  In her<br/>
8 years I&#39;ve never had a restaurant give us difficulty over this requirement<br/>
for one of their patrons.  In fact - because of my response to my dd&#39;s<br/>
creativity - my younger dd is into presentation, &#39;plating&#39; as its called on<br/>
the food network  - the staff is most often delighted by her excitement as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Btw -  My older dd&#39;s restaurant experimentations led to concocting at home<br/>
where by the age of 5 she created an original brownie recipe that was<br/>
incredible.  I took to setting up a pantry shelf she could reach with food<br/>
items that didn&#39;t concern me about cost so she could experiment in attempts<br/>
to make edible recipes.<br/>
<br/>
But when out ion public if I feel that someone <br/>
else is watching, I begin to squirm. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] You don&#39;t know what they are thinking?  Have you looked up and<br/>
smiled at the person watching the beauty you call your son?  Giving them the<br/>
same compassion, joy and acceptance you have for his human experience.  Its<br/>
very disarming and could shift their perspective.<br/>
<br/>
But to continue, after I had picked up the silverware, <br/>
he rightly became upset and went up to where the silverware was and began<br/>
taking now <br/>
large handfuls of each utensil again. I was feeling embarrassed and out of<br/>
control. I know <br/>
I am working and striving not to be in control as I want to honor his<br/>
decisions even if they <br/>
are not mine. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Joanne - when I feel my need to control someone else - I<br/>
recite the serenity prayer as such: grant me the serenity to accept the<br/>
things I can not change (him), the courage to change the things I can<br/>
(myself).  It helps to remind me that I need to shift my behaviour in that<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
But I am having trouble when the behavior begins to have others turn and <br/>
stare and my trying to speak to him quietly about my regret of taking his<br/>
silverware, <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] What struck me is your &#39;quietly&#39; speaking to him about your<br/>
regret. From your posting this quiet talk seems to have come from your<br/>
continued self consciousness of others.  Your son is a bright kid - sounds<br/>
like he was frustrated by what may have been your mixed message indicating<br/>
that he was bad or wrong or not right when in fact you were the one<br/>
disrespectful.  My younger dd can sometimes respond to my mistakes<br/>
(disrespectful behaviour - such as not asking if she is finished with<br/>
something prior to my cleaning it up) with a passionate response (qualifiedy<br/>
by some people - like my mom or dad as tantrum response for which they are<br/>
embarrassed.)   I find that the best way to apologize for my mistake is to<br/>
do so clearly and loudly and confidently - letting her know I was wrong and<br/>
she was right, I should have asked her first prior to removing her things.<br/>
Then I will calmly and compassionately maintain a loving support until she<br/>
has finished with her feelings.  Just because I have apologized doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
she will have let go of her frustration.   What helps her in her passionate<br/>
response is for me to maintain my composure, love and acceptance of her<br/>
expressions without judgement.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you that ultimately more people in public places have come to me<br/>
to express their marvel and appreciation of how I&#39;ve handled my dd than<br/>
those that may not have appreciated the skillfull parenting that exists.<br/>
And the one time someone told me that I should treat my dd differently (such<br/>
as punishment, slap or timeout) I&#39;ve responded by saying that I am sorry<br/>
that they may have been treated so poorly when they were upset I hope for<br/>
them that will have a different experience in their lives from here on out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
that the silverware was to be used in the restaurant for multiple people,<br/>
his behavior got <br/>
more insistent and seemed to grow larger. I am still so new. I know I am<br/>
making a ton of <br/>
mistakes. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] As Kelly would call them - learning takes.  You are learning<br/>
and good for you for recognizing that perhaps there is something in your<br/>
behaviour that could be changed to help better accommodate your sons joyful<br/>
experience of the world.<br/>
<br/>
I am open to all feedback and I would also appreciate the support of knowing<br/>
<br/>
others have either been there or are also struggling with something similar.<br/>
Joanne O&#39;N.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Sounds like the simple lesson for you may be to remember to<br/>
ask you son before clearing his materials - even though you or someone else<br/>
thinks he&#39;s done (or should be done).<br/>
