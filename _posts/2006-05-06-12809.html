<div id="ygrps-yiv-435605948">We&#39;ve been HSing (unschooling) for a couple of months now and we&#39;ve<br/>
met several other HSing families in various ways. This has led to some<br/>
fun activites for DS (such as our local group goes to the park every<br/>
Fri for playtime). However, it just makes me feel like one big<br/>
outcast. The topics of the day include curriculum, how to fit all the<br/>
work into each day, how to get the kids to actually do the work,<br/>
yadda, yadda, yadda. I don&#39;t have much to add since obviously we don&#39;t<br/>
utilize those things in our house. And I&#39;m a little to shy to just<br/>
bust out the whole unschooling philosophy amongst a group of people<br/>
that I don&#39;t really know and that all share a totally different<br/>
philosophy. Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811916968">I&#39;m fortunate to have been with the same friends for a while now.  <br/>
Perhaps you can keep your eyes/ears open to certain types of <br/>
homeschooling programs.  For example, if textbook programs such as <br/>
Calvert, Abeka and BJU are being discussed, those types of <br/>
homeschoolers are usually very structured.  But if you hear of <br/>
programs like Oak Meadow, Sonlight, Charlotte Mason, and Winter <br/>
Promise, those homeschoolers are generally a bit more relaxed.  <br/>
People who use Unit Studies can go both ways.  I&#39;ve seen some very <br/>
structured families using Unit Studies, and some very relaxed <br/>
families as well.  If that makes any sense.  But anyway, if you can <br/>
encourage friendships with the people who are using slightly more <br/>
relaxed materials, you might find some common ground.  <br/>
<br/>
It may just be a slow-going mission.  Chances are you&#39;ll find <br/>
someone who wants to be more relaxed but is surrounded by die-hard <br/>
structured homeschoolers and feels the need to keep up with the <br/>
joneses.  That describes me to a &quot;T&quot;.  I am more confident now and <br/>
have real friends who care more about me than about how I homeschool <br/>
my children.  In fact, one of my best friends who has been an even <br/>
bigger curriculum junkie than me is moving towards unschooling <br/>
though she&#39;s still fighting it somewhat.  She&#39;s met an unschooler <br/>
and is extremely inspired by their family.  And now that I&#39;ve gone <br/>
back to unschooling, it just provides more support for her.  It&#39;s <br/>
not good to jump in with both feet sometimes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
You can also try starting some different conversations.  Ask about <br/>
favorite educational software, or book recommendations for pleasure <br/>
reading.  Begin a conversation about Science exploration for young <br/>
children ala Charlotte Mason, i.e. nature walks.  It seems that even <br/>
very structured homeschoolers feel it&#39;s okay to be relaxed in <br/>
Science in the early years though of course you may get some <br/>
recommendations of curriculums.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953252506">I understand completely.  We are the Pagan unschoolers in a sea of <br/>
Fundamentalist &quot;school-at-homers&quot;.  We handled it three different ways.<br/>
<br/>
First, I simply held my tongue (not easy for a Leo) and was miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I searched the internet for another group close by that <br/>
described themselves as Relaxed.  What I actually found was a group of <br/>
unschoolers and I jumped in with both feet.  Problem is that most <br/>
people are fine with unschooling young kids but move to a much more <br/>
structured approach (usually at the insistence of DH) at around 9, so <br/>
all the kids in the group were quite young.  My 2 oldest kids had no <br/>
one to hang out with and wanted to spend time with the kids they met in <br/>
the first group.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I re-joined the first group.  I was very up front and open with <br/>
the leaders about who are family is and what we are and asked if it <br/>
would be a problem.  They assured me it wasn&#39;t a problem and the few <br/>
times it has been a problem with other members, the leaders have backed <br/>
me up 100%.  I have made friends in the group and admittedly they think <br/>
I&#39;m a bit wacky but we seek out each other to spend time with <br/>
occassionally.<br/>
<br/>
So now we simply belong to two groups, one in which I am the norm and <br/>
one in which I am very much the odd-ball.  It works for us.<br/>
