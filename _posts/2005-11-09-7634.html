Cool.<br/>
There are plenty of unschoolers playing that and they could conect at<br/>
the conferneces!:) My boys will be playing both World of Warcraft and<br/>
Halo2 online as soon as we get cable internet (we&#39;re waiting for the<br/>
techs to come).<br/>

I&#39;ve heard from a lot of people on the various groups I&#39;m on who play, <br/>
but most are different realms (she&#39;s already got her characters <br/>
established in one realm, and you can&#39;t connect between them).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be able to get to NM but Kathryn is planning a New <br/>
England mini conference in May that we&#39;ll DEFINITELY be at!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717515273">There was a World of Warcraft convention here in Southern California  <br/>
just a few weeks ago where people from all over the world, who play  <br/>
together online, DID get to meet. So that&#39;s not just a pipe dream, if  <br/>
her parents will be supportive, it could happen. Too COOL! What an  <br/>
amazing world we live in!<br/>
