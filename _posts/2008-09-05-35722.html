<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035784562">Hi I am Jamie, I have been lurking since spring.  I have 2 children <br/>
ages 5 and 2.  We have been RU (thanks to advice from this group)<br/>
since June, I have been unschooling for about a year (I am not really <br/>
sure.)<br/>
<br/>
I know this must have been discussed before, but I can&#39;t seem to find <br/>
it in the older messages.<br/>
Twice this week my a parent has mentioned my son&#39;s &quot;behavior&quot; First <br/>
was yelling for help as a part of imaginary play. I spoke up and <br/>
explained that he was just playing a game and his sister and I play <br/>
with him.  She still kept insisting that it was like the boy &quot;crying <br/>
wolf&quot; and stated that it was upsetting her.  Finally I asked my son <br/>
to stop saying help because it was distressing the other woman.<br/>
<br/>
The other situation was with a woman commenting on his &quot;baby talk&quot; <br/>
which he uses sometimes (he is the five year old.)  She asked him why <br/>
he was using baby talk? When I told her I was okay with it, she still <br/>
made a comment to him about not using baby talk when she comes over <br/>
to visit.<br/>
<br/>
How do you deal with this?  These situations upset my son. He loves <br/>
to play with the other children.  I have not been able to find like <br/>
minded people where we live. I do not want my son to feel social <br/>
pressure to fit their little boxes as to how little children should <br/>
behave.<br/>

How do you stop people from going there with your child? I wish these <br/>

 <br/>
This is an adult woman who was getting &#39;distressed&#39; by a little boy playing???  I&#39;m with Katherine on this one, I&#39;d stop inviting her over.  I have chosen less friends and playdates instead of stressfull ones this year, and even though it sometimes has been a bit lonely, it&#39;s much more peaceful!  And my tongue doesn&#39;t get so sore from biting it for the whole visit &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
~~The other situation was with a woman commenting on his &quot;baby talk&quot; <br/>
which he uses sometimes (he is the five year old.) She asked him why <br/>
he was using baby talk? When I told her I was okay with it, she still <br/>
made a comment to him about not using baby talk when she comes over <br/>
to visit.~~<br/>
 <br/>
Wow, again, some people are pretty ballsy to request what your son&#39;s behaviour looks like when she comes into *your* home!  It wouldn&#39;t be okay with me for someone else to request something like that of my child, *especially* if they were a guest in my home.<br/>
<br/>
~~How do you deal with this? These situations upset my son. He loves <br/>
to play with the other children. I have not been able to find like <br/>
minded people where we live. I do not want my son to feel social <br/>
pressure to fit their little boxes as to how little children should <br/>
behave.~~<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure these situations do upset your son!  It sounds like they&#39;re upsetting you too.  Do you actually get any enjoyment out of these visits/playdates?  The cost sounds high to me.  I would venture that no playdates would feel better than ones like this!!!  It is a challenge finding like-minded people sometimes.  I&#39;ve heard it said that you know you&#39;re a radical unschooler when your closest friend lives 100 miles away :).  But I see it as my job to be the intermediary between my children and people that don&#39;t have 100% respect for them...like my in-laws, which is why we don&#39;t visit very often at all, and why we had lots of &#39;words&#39; during our last visit.<br/>
<br/>
~~How do you stop people from going there with your child? I wish these <br/>
were the only two incidents but they are not!~~<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s your choice really.  You can be direct and perhaps lose friends, or you can be indirect and not invite them over.  Is this really the kind of company you want to keep??<br/>

unreal though.  But it depends on the strength of your friendship.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had trouble with kids mouthing off and putting Karl down recently that<br/>
was just too far over the top.  After trying to keep the communication lines<br/>
open between me and Karl about it for a long time (something like 3 years<br/>
and for most of that time it wasn&#39;t that bad), it finally went too far.  By<br/>
then it was very hard on Karl either way... continuing to play with the kids<br/>
who seemed to be getting meaner and meaner every visit who he had kinda<br/>
grown to like (who seemed more and more frequently unable to show  they like<br/>
him) or not having them as a play option.  I want to think there&#39;s some<br/>
other way to deal with over the top stuff but even the adults were over the<br/>
top in this regular play situation, and that is what was really making it<br/>
unworkable.  The good thing is I had the excuse of distance to bow out<br/>
with.  So I managed to stay civil and cut ties, with lots of comforting for<br/>
Karl.  It was not easy because by then he was very accustomed to their crap<br/>
and at least half believed it was ok that they behaved in extreme ways<br/>
toward him (and others).  The other part of it was that me and Brian had<br/>
been separated for about 1 1/2 years of that time period.  So I wasn&#39;t even<br/>
in the same state until these last 4 months.  Not an easy thing to come home<br/>
to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian was very helpful and so was Kelly Lovejoy in encouraging me<br/>
to seek out and start other social opportunities for Karl.  So I&#39;m working<br/>
on that now.  I am starting a local chapter of CampFire USA for Boys and<br/>
Girls here to host at our place, and I hope to have events in a few weeks<br/>
for the beautiful fall weather.  (It&#39;s to be in Campobello SC --Spartanburg<br/>
county-- for those who might be interested in passing on the word.  Any<br/>
folks nearby or willing to drive are welcome to bring their kids.)<br/>

with kids, it helps to wait for happy, friendly times, outside of <br/>
any kind of conflict to open the discussion. In the meantime, <br/>
perhaps you could meet to play somewhere more spacious - like a <br/>
playground - where the mom is less likely to be so critical of <br/>
behavior. <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve had similar trouble with one homeschooled girl we use to visit <br/>
frequently. In our case, though, Mo wasn&#39;t happy with ways the girl <br/>
was behaving and asked to stop playing with her. For awhile I <br/>
continued trying to have a relationship with the girl&#39;s mom - we <br/>
have a lot in common *outside* parenting - but more recently I&#39;ve <br/>
been letting that lapse. I&#39;m getting tired of questions about when <br/>
Mo will be coming to play again and of course we&#39;ll be at the dd&#39;s <br/>
birthday party? Er... briefly, just long enough for the girl to <br/>
thoroughly insult Morgan&#39;s rather idiosyncratic speech. Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things Ray found, after about a year of deschooling, was <br/>
that he didn&#39;t like school kids anymore, in part because of their <br/>
sort of constant negativity. So most of his friends are adults or <br/>
the odd homeschooler he meets. He met a few recently at a summer <br/>
solstice event (okay, not all that recently, I guess!) and he&#39;s been <br/>
keeping contact over the internet. <br/>

That&#39;s just weird. It makes me wonder, though, the girl in question <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the strong local accent that all her friends have. <br/>
Maybe she&#39;s been teased about the way she talks and is passing the <br/>
behavior along? I&#39;ll hold onto that idea as a way to have more <br/>
empathy for the girl, anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610514939">Hi Jamie,<br/>
<br/>
I am very aware and consious of my son&#39;s differences and proud of <br/>
it. I believe we all have neeeds, some of us handle it better, so <br/>
don&#39;t. I always explained or inform beforehand of my son&#39;s <br/>
quirkiness/ needs. And because of my son, I am always aware and <br/>
understand and accept the reason why certain people act the way they <br/>
do, very differently to ours. For I believe there is always 2 sides <br/>
to a story. <br/>
<br/>
Like your kid, my 8 yrs old son can have very good imagination. He <br/>
can go on blabbling away scripts from movies, and fall into a role <br/>
quite convincingly. It&#39;s called Creative Imagination, and it&#39;s <br/>
healthy for a child. <br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps your friend is having issues of in-ability to <br/>
differentiate between a real cry of help or play-acting, an <br/>
uncomfortable feeling of losing a sense of control? She already said <br/>
it stresses her out. If we were to put your enthusiatic son in a <br/>
costume and on a stage, she won&#39;t be seeing it as crying wolf, <br/>
instead she&#39;ll quite happily and safely accept it as stage-play. <br/>
<br/>
Option 1 - express your opinion. I do this if I feel I don&#39;t really <br/>
need that person&#39;s friendship that badly enough, because for me, in <br/>
all friendship, it&#39;s about give and take, and if I feel so and so is <br/>
not willing to make some compromisation, then I don&#39;t need sucha <br/>
friend. It will be too painful and detrimental to try to maintain a <br/>
lop-sided relationship. <br/>
<br/>
You can tell her that in your OPINION, the issue is more with her <br/>
nerves (LOL) rather than your son. Acknowledge that she is effected <br/>
by your son&#39;s enthusiatic play-acting, but because it is your house <br/>
and your rules and you know enough to understand the concept of <br/>
crying wolf, and this, to your OPINION, is most definetely not. <br/>
Explained that she&#39;s hurting your feelings and your son&#39;s, by <br/>
challenging your assessment of the situation for surely you know <br/>
your son best, and by imposing HER limitation onto you guys, &quot;it is <br/>
rather like teaching you how to parent your son?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The downfall of this is she might refuse to accept your opinion of <br/>
this scenario (for nobody likes to be told they&#39;re wrong but she <br/>
has, in not many words, told you you&#39;re wrong to allow this!), and <br/>
will huff-of and not come back with her children. Or she might <br/>
surprised you and see the other side of her actions and learn to <br/>
trust you, and back-off. That&#39;s the word, &quot;Trust&quot;. Why does she not <br/>
trust you when you&#39;re in your home and you said it&#39;s ok and <br/>
everything is fine?  <br/>
<br/>
Or.....<br/>
<br/>
Option 2. If she&#39;s worth keeping, then You compromise.  <br/>
<br/>
You can talk to your son about acceoting HER needs and limitation, <br/>
if he wants to play with her kids. Hopefully he&#39;ll understand that <br/>
his acting is &quot;just too good&quot; (and someday he&#39;ll make a fine actor,) <br/>
and it sounds so convincing that everytime he cries for help, She <br/>
DOES think he is in danger and in pain, and this causes her un-<br/>
nessecary worries that she can&#39;t even enjoy her cup of tea. She is <br/>
afterall the guest. But if he says NO, he&#39;s not willing to <br/>
compromise, then I guessed you already have your answer - her kids <br/>
were obviously not that important enough for him to sacrifice his <br/>
play-acting.    <br/>
<br/>
I have took this route before many times, and it&#39;s help my son learn <br/>
to understand the side of the story,  and he&#39;s learn to accomodate <br/>
other people&#39;s needs, for I cannot constantly go round and force <br/>
other people adapt to my son&#39;s needs. Not everyone is so <br/>
accomodating, and the last thing I want is for my son to think <br/>
he&#39;s &quot;done something wrong&quot; again just because some poeple is so <br/>
fixated with thier version of parenting! By talking to my son, he <br/>
has an opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of any social <br/>
situation and is in control of the decision whether to take the <br/>
relationship forward or not. Sometimes he&#39;s very sure of Not, but <br/>
othertimes, he&#39;ll say &quot;let&#39;s give it a try and see what happens&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for those baby talks. You&#39;re kid&#39;s only 5, what does this other <br/>
lady expect? A presentation?!!? My kid&#39;s 8 already, and he STILL <br/>
baby talks with me. It&#39;s called bonding, and me and my son&#39;s bond is <br/>
very STRONG! <br/>
<br/>
Jamie, be confident about your child&#39;s differences and innocence.<br/>
Learn to di-resgard what other people remark or say- &quot;one ear in, <br/>
one ear out&quot; as the saying goes. It&#39;s just a negative reflection of <br/>
thier &quot;flawed and trained mind&quot;, of which, when reflected onto us, <br/>
it shows how far down the positive route we are on by unschooling <br/>
our kids. Everytime someone makes a negative remark to you, be <br/>
grateful and thankful that you are free from such negative thoughts, <br/>
free from such constraints and pains of rules following, and is <br/>
living your lives as freely as you want it to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Or....<br/>
<br/>
You may want to fight back such &quot;barb&quot; by offer your OPINION!! Go <br/>
on, the next time that lady make the baby talk remark again, just <br/>
casually remark that that you enjoy your son&#39;s baby talks and you&#39;re <br/>
fine with it. But out of curiosity, ask her what makes she thinks <br/>
it&#39;s un-acceptable for a 5 yrs old to be baby-talking? Infact, how <br/>
should he be talking? <br/>
<br/>
When you keep an open mind, you will find it&#39;s because they <br/>
remembered being told off for not &quot;talking &quot; properly when they are <br/>
young! What a sad thing isn&#39;t it? That these people never really had <br/>
parents like us, who respect our kids for what they are and <br/>
celebrate them for who they are. You have to symphatise with them, <br/>
for we too, understood that pain of growing up with loads of un-<br/>
neccessary pressure of un-met expectations placed on us to. <br/>

(after processing our feelings and needs) that is neither rebuttal nor<br/>
acquiescence but a synthesis, an understanding of how we really feel and<br/>
what we really want.  Not just a reaction.<br/>

<br/>
When climbing around, my child prefers no shoes too. and me too. <br/>
It&#39;s so hard to climb and balance on anything with chunky shoes on! <br/>
You just can&#39;t grip and balance yourself out. I can&#39;t understand the <br/>
