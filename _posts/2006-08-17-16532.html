<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016222216">How does one go about getting involved in an unschooling support <br/>
group?  I have a 2 year old, and I&#39;ve just recently learned about <br/>
unschooling.  I would really like an opportunity to be around some <br/>
local people who are already involved in unschooling and see it in <br/>
action, perhaps ask a few questions as they come up, etc.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
had any luck on my searches.  I&#39;m in Whittier, California, just in <br/>
case anyone here is local to me.<br/>

probably find something - even if it isn&#39;t a group local to you, they <br/>
might know of folks near you who just aren&#39;t on yahoo. Or, look for <br/>
generic &quot;homeschooling&quot; groups - there are lots of them - and there&#39;s <br/>
usually at least one or two unschoolers hanging around at the park <br/>
days and such.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you searched yahoogroups for things such as &quot;Whittier Homeschool&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Whittier Unschool&quot; or &quot;_____ County home/unschool&quot; or &quot;____region<br/>
(South Central, Silicon Valley, etc) home/unschool&quot;  Have you done a<br/>
google search with those criteria?  Have you called the school<br/>
district (sometimes school districts have contact information for<br/>
local homeschool groups.)  If you can&#39;t find unschoolers specifically<br/>
search out homeschool groups because sometimes unschoolers are &quot;lost&quot;<br/>
amongst the ranks of traditional homeschoolers as they can&#39;t find<br/>
others either :)  I believe that there are a few message boards for<br/>
unschoolers around where you can post a &quot;looking for unschoolers in<br/>
_____&quot; type posts.  And if all that fails, start your own unschooling<br/>
yahoogroup and sit back and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Doing a quick google search I did find this group:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SecularHomeEducators/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SecularHomeEducators/</a> which (according<br/>
to Jon&#39;s homeschool resource pages) seems to be located in or near<br/>
Whittier.  Sometimes you just have to be creative with your searches<br/>
and the words you use.  Try using words like secular, inclusive,<br/>
non-coercive, relaxed, peaceful, gentle, non-religious.  While you may<br/>
not find a bunch of unschoolers you may find people who are at least<br/>
gentle and loving with their children.  That&#39;s the one thing going for<br/>
the group I&#39;m in.  While there are only a small handful of true<br/>
radical unschoolers, the other families treat their children with love<br/>
and respect, which I didn&#39;t find in the other (big old mean)<br/>
homeschool group.<br/>
