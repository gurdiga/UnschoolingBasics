<div id="ygrps-yiv-552753872">Hi! I just began thinking of homeschooling in the last month or so. I <br/>
have five kids, the three youngest of whom (I think) will remain in <br/>
public school until I use their two older sisters as guinea pigs in <br/>
this venture, if I decide to do it.  I&#39;m still in the information-<br/>
gathering stage.  My 15-year-old daughter, Samantha, has an illness <br/>
that causes extreme pain in her joints and is unable to attend regular <br/>
school.  We have been to six different doctors and have yet to receive <br/>
a diagnosis, so the school board here won&#39;t send a homebound teacher <br/>
for her to our home.  So that&#39;s when I started thinking of doing it <br/>
myself.  There are several things I&#39;m concerned about with that, number <br/>
one being that I have a full-time job as the manager of a small <br/>
convenience store/diner.  My income is the only income, so there&#39;s no <br/>
way I could quit my job, but I have a great boss and my hours are <br/>
fairly flexible.  Does anyone know of parents that successfully <br/>
homeschooled their kids and had full-time jobs?  I have a few other <br/>
concerns, but right now, that one is the one that weighs most on my <br/>
mind.  Any thoughts, advice or experiences would be greatly <br/>
appreciated, positive or negative.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689204838">Well, the good news is if you decide to go the &quot;unschooling&quot; route, you don&#39;t have to do anything in particular!  Is your daughter OK to be home when you are not there?  I find with my girls (13 1/2), once they were set free to find their own rhythms, they sleep until at least 11, and sometimes even 1 or 2 (they both went through a period of staying up all night and sleeping all day, but they eventually got over that). I share my house with another mom whose kids also don&#39;t go to school, and they are 13 1/2 year old twin boys - weird coincidence, I know - but it gives us a lot of data - her boys also went through the all-night thing, but one of them decided he preferred to be awake during the day, and switched himself around, and the other one is the only one who still totally stays up all night and sleeps most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
So my point is, that once you set her free, you may find that a different pattern will develop anyway, and you don&#39;t yet know what that&#39;s going to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Is your daughter&#39;s goal to finish high school?  Where do you live (e.g. in which state, if in the US) - if she is very motivated to finish high school, there are innumerable on-line accredited high-school diploma courses - just google it!   You might want to read a book or two by Grace Llewellyn for some more things to think about concerning High School and if it is really necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
There are short cuts to college/university that she may want to explore, if that is more her true goal  - high school isn&#39;t actually necessary for many college/university programs.  Another resource you might want to look at is Life Learning Magazine (www.lifelearningmagazine.com) which is choc-a-bloc with alternative educational resource ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Also Athabasca University (www.athabascau.ca) , which is physically located in Alberta, Canada, offers on-line college credit courses to anyone who is 16 - no high school diploma required - there may be some prerequisites if it&#39;s like advanced math or something.  <br/>
<br/>
So, there&#39;s lots of possibilities, and so many find it is such a relief to get off the high school treadmill and set your learning free!  Lots of luck to you!  I&#39;m not sure how you could do the others - you might have to hire a babysitter when you weren&#39;t home if the oldest ones aren&#39;t able/willing to look after the younger ones?  But, one step at a time, eh?  Judy R, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829449445">Well our dd is just turning 5 so we haven&#39;t &quot;officially&quot; started, but we are going to co-homeschool just like we co-parent. Both of us have full time jobs but we are also both self-employed. If we have to both of us can take dd to work with us, but usually we off-set our schedules. <br/>
So, with a 15 yr old I think it would be easy. She is old enough to stay by herself as long as her medical needs allow it. Therefore I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. <br/>
Have you read anything about unschooling yet? You and your dd will both need to deschool quite a bit. So at first it will seem like a whole lot of nothing:)!<br/>
There is a LOT of information on this list. I would recommend looking though some of the older posts too. I think you will enjoy it:)!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604699490">Sorry this might get long but I just need to vent a little and this is the only place I know I can do it safely! My in-laws are visiting this weekend. FIL had not seen the new baby yet so they came out to see him. Got in Friday morning and will leave most likely before we get up Monday morning. So it is not a long visit so I know the best thing is to just grin and bear it and just let things go. Nothing to bad yet but it is giving me a glimps into the future when the boys are &quot;school&quot; age. Right now they are just 4, 2, and 4 months.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
There have been comments here and there like &quot;How is Eric (the oldest) doing on his ABC&#39;s?&quot; to which I reply with &quot;He is doing just fine.&quot; Answering her but not all at the same time. :) Telling me how I should put them in school the first few years at least to &quot;give me a break.&quot; Ummmm thanks but my weekly yard sales I hit every Saturday are good enough for me and my down time. I do not need to send my kids away for 40+hrs a week. Call me crazy but I LIKE my kids......<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
My 2 yo is prone to fits sometimes. He has a temper and it comes from my in-laws side. My MIL has it. She knows it and she was even talking to him the other day about it is hard to have a temper and she knows because she has it and it is hard to control sometimes and blah blah. She is over 50 yrs on him and she has a hard time controlling it sometimes what do you expect from a 2 yo? So at lunch he wanted to get his own food and they had stopped him. I was putting the baby for a nap and when I heard him crying I came to find out why. While trying to ask WHAT he was doing when the fit started to figure out WHY he was having one she kept saying that she could not eat like this and he needed to be sent to his room to &quot;fix it&quot; and I was just showing him that it was ok ect ect. So I of course stood up for him and said &quot;if someone will just tell me what he was doing when he got upset then I can help him!&quot; finally got out that he was trying to get into the food<br/>
 so I said &quot;and the problem with that is what he just wants to be a big boy and get his own lunch&quot; So I helped him realize he could and BAM he was happy in a second. <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I am just trying to let it all go because I hate to get into it when I know it can be avoided. I am of course watching out for MY KIDS and THEIR interests first and foremost. I just needed somewhere to vent. No need to reply I just needed to get it out to people who get it and know what I am going through. BREATH :)<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, that seems to be crazy in this world. It&#39;s too bad.<br/>
<br/>
As far as intervening for your child, I think you did a great job of<br/>
that. Very cool!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could drop the &quot;he has a temper&quot; thing and just say &quot;he&#39;s<br/>
got a strong sense of self&quot;.:)<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t see it that way, but that&#39;s ok. He&#39;s got a great advocate.<br/>
Hang in there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915656971">Yeah I try not to use the temper word to often because I know that is just who he is. He also does not talk a lot so he has a hard time telling us what he needs. Which comes out a lot as a &quot;temper&quot;. I know he just gets frusturated and I do the best I can to help him through it. It just is where he is now so I meet him there.I mean he is only 2. I can not see him sitting there at 40 and screaming because he did not get to put his food on his plate. He just gets frustured just like every adult out there but it still learning all his coping skills. <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;Stong willed is an understatement when it comes to this kid! He can sit there forever till he figures it out or gets something JUST SO! It is something I just love so much in him and find so amazing. <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Can I just say I love this group knowing other people feel the same way I do about their kids! <br/>

  This is one of the main reasons I love this group too.<br/>
   <br/>
  Jade, Skye & I were at the park the other day, surrounded by other kids and their parents, and *very* few of the parents appeared to be even remotely enjoying their children.  I find it very sad.  I have been asked before if I&#39;m the nanny/aunt/etc. perhaps because I am having *fun* with mine!  And here I thought it was because I look so young &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
