<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048655211">Simon recommends How to Speak Dragonese by Cressida Cowell. I scanned some of the pages from the book where they describe different types of dragons and then erased what was already there so that Simon and Linnaea could create their own Dragons. They liked having a template. <br/>
