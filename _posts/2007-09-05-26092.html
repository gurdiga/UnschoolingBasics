advantage of any of their group buys that you want. (They currently<br/>
also have buys going for Lego sets, Dave Ramsey stuff, BrainPop, and a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861221481">I just looked at the homeschoolbuyersco-op site and foudn the legos <br/>
section. I had no idea legos did all this. The choce is mind <br/>
boggling, especially not knowing what all is going on here. Can <br/>
anyone recommend where to start with a brand new 10-year old <br/>
homeschooler boy who loves putting together the prepared models <br/>
available at any toy store?<br/>

Thanks.<br/>

My son is 11, and loves the Lego Bionicles.  He builds<br/>
them, and then tears them apart, and makes his own<br/>
creations.  It&#39;s fun to see what he can come up with<br/>
next.  By the way, we have only been homeschooling for<br/>
a year.  Hope this helps some.<br/>
