<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515571694">my dd&#39;s are really interested in gymnastics, rock climbing, art, and a <br/>
number of other things....my questions is this...lots of interests are <br/>
very expensive. i would love to get them into gymnastics class or <br/>
something, but it is just too pricey. what do you do when their <br/>
greatest interest is too expensive and not something you are talented <br/>
(or flexible) enough in :) sarah</div>

Have you checked into any homeschool p.e. classes?  We have been in <br/>
two different classes in two different states and they have been very <br/>
inexpensive and the teachers were very flexible.  We like the one <br/>

they get to play in a fairly uncompetetive way.  But maybe you could <br/>
find something like that.<br/>

getting some more ideas myself.  Glad you asked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ideally you try find other homeschoolers in your area and start a co-op.  <br/>
Each parent can work with the kids based on their areas of expertise and the <br/>
group&#39;s interests.   Science experiments, sewing, cooking, yoga, construction, <br/>
gardening, art, etc.  Sometimes older homeschool kids can take turns sharing <br/>
their knowledge with those interested. Auto repair, sports (basketball, archery, <br/>
soccer), robot building, book clubs, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t successful putting that together I suggest you shop around for <br/>
classes that fit within your budget.  Where there is a will, you can find a <br/>
way.  Fees vary a lot, for example: In our community there is a gymnastics <br/>
studio that charges by the season and you pay an annual registration fee of <br/>
50.00/student as well as 15.00 per class and they require full payment in advance of <br/>
the session.  For two of my kids it cost us $460.00 initially.  Too much.  The <br/>
studio we go to now is run by a family friendly mom.  She charges a $25.00 <br/>
annual family registration, 10.00 per class and offers a 10%sibling discount.  <br/>
It costs us 72.00 per month, payable monthly, for our two Olympic bound <br/>
gymnasts.  Other classes we take, like piano, accept payment on a weekly basis.  We <br/>
have a soup and grilled cheese night once a week and save enough for a $10.00 <br/>
class.  Brainstorm and you will find a way to do many of the things your <br/>
children are interested in.  We have also had great success by gathering a group of <br/>
interested students and presenting yourselves to a business as a &quot;class&quot; <br/>
looking for an instructor.  You can negotiate for reasonable rates and we have <br/>
found that few businesses turn down 8-10 paying students.  <br/>
<br/>
Drama classes at a conservatory can be expensive but you may be able to find <br/>
a talented homeschooler who is willing to work with you to put a play or <br/>
talent show together.<br/>
<br/>
Prioritize...Cut expenses where you can, i.e., cable, food, heat, etc., or <br/>
clean your cellar and attic and have a yard sale or sell stuff on e-bay.  <br/>
<br/>
If the above ideas are overwhelming, design a gymnastics circuit in your <br/>
home.  Climb over couches, balance on benches, crawl under tables, etc.  Hold your <br/>
own creative movement class and play music and stretch, dance and move <br/>
together.  The possibilities are endless.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37308107">A mom in our area had a daughter who desperately<br/>
wanted to take gymnastics classes. The regular classes<br/>
were expensive and not at a convenient time so she<br/>
arranged to not only have a homeschool class so that<br/>
the class would be at a convenient time and  her<br/>
daughter could be around other homeschoolers, she also<br/>
arranged for the parents to act as volunteers. We each<br/>
took one turn as parent volunteer per session. We<br/>
basically acted as &quot;crowd control&quot; to help keep the<br/>
little ones from crashing or running over one another<br/>
while on the floor and never did anything &quot;teachy&quot;,<br/>
but it kept them from having to hire another teacher<br/>
for the session and they passed that savings on to us.<br/>
We paid A LOT less for that class than we would have<br/>
for a regular class and it&#39;s a good thing too because<br/>
otherwise my son would never have enjoyed several<br/>
years worth of gymnastics while we were on a tight<br/>
budget. <br/>
<br/>
We have also taken lots of &quot;classes&quot; through the local<br/>
parks departments and the libraries. I even took a<br/>
whole series of VERY inexpensive classes at our local<br/>
library during which I had several months worth of<br/>
tap, jazz, ballet, bellydance, and yoga classes.<br/>
Afterwards the teachers offered continuing  classes at<br/>
a discount to the people who took the class. I&#39;d also<br/>
suggest that you ask around at local homeschooling<br/>
groups. We live in a small town but in our local group<br/>
we have a wealth of moms who are experienced in<br/>
various things. We have an artist, a former gymnastics<br/>
coach, a scientist, an archeologist, a professional<br/>
musician, and more...and those are just the moms. We<br/>
also have lots of parents and kids who have<br/>
interesting hobbies and are willing to share their<br/>
knowledge for free. And don&#39;t overlook other kids who<br/>
are taking those things your daughter is interested<br/>
in. Even though I wanted to, I never got to take a<br/>
gymnastics class or a dance class when I was a kid<br/>
(though I did when I got older), yet I was a<br/>
cheerleader and was on the dance squad/flag corps in<br/>
high school. I learned most of what I learned by<br/>
hanging out with my friends who did get to take those<br/>
classes and having them show me what they learned! I<br/>
also second the video suggestion but add that most<br/>
libraries will primarily have beginner videos. If you<br/>
look online or in trade magazines you will find<br/>
sources for more in depth videos. For instance, look<br/>
here:     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.activevideos.com/gymnastics.htm">http://www.activevideos.com/gymnastics.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.i-needtoknow.com/gymnastics/videos.html">http://www.i-needtoknow.com/gymnastics/videos.html</a> You<br/>
can also find discount gymnastics equipment and more. <br/>
