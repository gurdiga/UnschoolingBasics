<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614169264">For those of you with high school aged kids or for friends with <br/>
highschoolers.  I am assuming that the information below applies to homeschoolers too.  If <br/>
you have to file paperwork with your district, I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
include a homeschooler&#39;s info as well.  <br/>

Special Notification to Parents of Grades 11 and 12 Students<br/>
The Minnesota Legislature has amended the Data Practices Act, which controls <br/>
access to<br/>
student information. Schools must now release the name, address and home <br/>
telephone<br/>
number of students in grades 11 and 12 to military recruiting officers UNLESS <br/>
the<br/>
parent(s) specifically request that this data not be released.<br/>
Therefore, if you don&#39;t want your child&#39;s name and address and telephone <br/>
number(s) to<br/>
be provided to military recruiters, complete and return the form below. (To <br/>
find out the<br/>
name and address of your school district, call your school principal&#39;s <br/>
office, and ask them<br/>
to provide it to you.):<br/>
