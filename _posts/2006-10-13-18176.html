<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095826794">Hello , <br/>
  I wondered if I could maybe get some advice about a situation that happened today with my daughter (10).  She recently joined a new Girl Scout Troop and today was her fourth meeting.  She has generally liked it, very happy with the trips, fundraisers, going through the badge book with me and planning to do lots at home.  She was in tears after the meeting today....it had to do with a puzzle badge that the troop is working on at the meeting.  The leader gave the girls a paper that explained a puzzle in which the girls had to give letters a certain money value and come up with words that equaled $1.00.  Fran understood it perfectly, but invented her own puzzle with words, where she took a bigger word and broke it down into smaller words(she and I like to do this together at home!) and gave those words values.  When I was picking her up, the leader called us aside and explained to &quot;me&quot; what the puzzle was all about and that Fran did not understand.  Later at home, after<br/>
 hearing the whole story, I understood that it wasn&#39;t her understanding that was lacking, but she explained to me that it wasn&#39;t a puzzle that she wanted to do,so she had made up her own.  Why wasn&#39;t that acceptable?  She further explained to me that the troop doesn&#39;t run the way things run at home....she likes the freedom she has here (her words!) The leader had told the girls that they all had to do this one puzzle to work towards the badge and that felt very stifling to her.    <br/>
  We talked for a bit about the way the troop was run vs. our way....and I told her that maybe what we need to talk about next is whether being in the troop and doing the fun stuff outweighs the not fun stuff.  It would be her decision whether the troop was for her.   After lots of processing, she said that maybe one bad meeting was too early to judge what to do.  She also had the idea if there were snacks (!), the meetings might be better!<br/>
  I guess my question is .....where do you think I should go with this next?  I want to honor my daughter&#39;s feelings about the troop, but also want her to know that maybe the way it runs will never look like what we do and can she (and I??) accept that?<br/>
  Thanks for reading......have a great Friday night!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s ironic you posted that today because I had a really big <br/>
(adoption related) issue with both my daughter&#39;s Girls Scout troop <br/>
yesterday. :-(<br/>
<br/>
My two girls sometimes don&#39;t like certain aspects of Scouts, but for <br/>
them, the positive side of it far outweighs any negative, so they <br/>
continue going. I think your daughter made a good choice to give it <br/>
another try. :-)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38331925">Sounds to me like you already answered your question.<br/>
You listened, discussed reasons and options, then left it to her to decide if she can accept their way or not.<br/>
Sounds like how I did it with my now 16 yo.  Just be forewarned (coming from recent conversation with same 16yo)<br/>
You can allow them freedom of choice but that won&#39;t stop them from later saying,&quot;You should have....&quot;.  Funny thing about that.  They can say it any way things go.  LOL, Go figure.  But they love you more for trusting them and helping them learn their personal limits while they learn to deal with others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234401328">We do Girl Scouts and Spiral Scouts(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.spiralscouts.org/">http://www.spiralscouts.org/</a> <br/>

friendly and open, but we also do GS because they have opportunities  <br/>
we would not have otherwise since they are so established and  <br/>
recognized in the community.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is, you can switch troops, it&#39;s amazing how different  <br/>
the GS experience can be from troop to troop, or even start your own  <br/>
troop. If you have an unschooling/homeschoolong community, you can  <br/>
have a troop just for them. Or if you don&#39;t, if you can get the word  <br/>
out, you may be able to help create a community that way =). You can  <br/>
contact your local council to find out how.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372278044">Thanks, Melissa.  I&#39;ll check out spiral scouts.....I&#39;ve never heard of them before now.  I think one of the problems is that I did have my own troop (or group...it was multi-age, all homeschool families, very family friendly)...and Fran loved it.  I had to give it up b/c of bedrest with number 4 baby, and didn&#39;t feel like I could give it the attention it needed after she was born.  Anyway, that was a year ago (!) and so we decided that she could try this new troop.  She is the only homeschooler.....and I think is feeling the BIG difference between our lives, the life of our old beloved troop, and this new troop.  ....we&#39;ll see how it goes...<br/>
  Thanks for the ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415382856">Beth, As a girl scout leader and a mother of 2 homeschooled girls ( <br/>
not a total unschool family but would like to be) it is hard to <br/>
change between the two rolls. when I plan troop activities I always <br/>
start with the girls and asking what they want to work on which <br/>
badge followed by what elements should be done as a troop at <br/>
meetings. majority rules. if an element is asked to be done in  a <br/>
certain way it should be , but if a girl would like to take it a <br/>
step ahead and do her own thing afterward I love the initiave. and <br/>
do like to see the end results. I would have listen to her more and <br/>
probably asked her to explain it to the rest of the troop. I wish <br/>
you and your daughter luck. I hope that she stick with the troop. <br/>
through the good times and bad alot can be learned. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Fran understood it perfectly, but invented her own puzzle with words, where she took a bigger word and broke it down into smaller words(she and I like to do this together at home!) and gave those words values.  When I was picking her up, the leader called us aside and explained to &quot;me&quot; what the puzzle was all about and that Fran did not understand.  Later at home, after<br/>
&gt;  hearing the whole story, I understood that it wasn&#39;t her understanding that was lacking, but she explained to me that it wasn&#39;t a puzzle that she wanted to do,so she had made up her own.  Why wasn&#39;t that acceptable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a former Girl Scout AND GS Leader I would say that it SHOULD have<br/>
been perfectly acceptable.  One of the things that was taught to us<br/>
when we went through leadership training is that variation of the<br/>
given requirements of the badges is COMPLETELY acceptable.  It&#39;s not<br/>
about exaclty duplicating the badge requirements, it&#39;s about<br/>
understanding the subject!!<br/>
<br/>
Someone else suggested finding a new troop and if coming to some<br/>
agreement with this leader is not working I would say find a new<br/>
leader.  My girls decided a few years ago to quit GS when we started<br/>
unschooling.  They felt out of place, different and thought too much<br/>
outside the box for GS.  They still respect and remember fondly their<br/>
GS years, but we never found the same connection that we had with our<br/>
former troops.<br/>
<br/>
Another person suggested Juliettes.  If she still wants to do the  GS<br/>
work but not do troop functions this is another option.  If she is<br/>
wanting GS for the socialization then go for that reason and don&#39;t<br/>
sweat the badge work.  If it were me and I would probably ask to speak<br/>
to the leader on neutral ground (maybe over a cuppa at Starbuck&#39;s some<br/>
day) and ask why your daughter&#39;s work was unacceptable as she expanded<br/>
upon the exercise that was presented.  I would explain a bit about<br/>
unschooling and what it is that your daughter (and you for your<br/>
daughter) want out of it.  I wouldn&#39;t completely give up on this<br/>
troop.  You might be able to shed a bit of light for this Leader.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, our troop did that badge once and we did NONE of the requirements<br/>
from the book.  I had a wonderful co-leader and we came up with our<br/>
very own ideas!<br/>
