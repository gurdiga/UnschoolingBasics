<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433292881">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted here in ages but have sporadically lurked. My boys <br/>
are almost 6 and 3 and for the moment we are unschooling. Dh is not <br/>
quite on board yet. Technically, ds1 should be in grade one but <br/>
luckily dh had no problem not sending ds1 in what would have been his <br/>
kindergarten year since ds is a November baby. For this year, I am <br/>
buying time by appeasing dh by sending ds1 two afternoons a week to a <br/>
woman who takes about 7 kids in her home for what is essentially a <br/>
Waldorf-based program. I see it as an activity which ds enjoys and dh <br/>
sees it as school. Hopefully by the time next year rolls around dh <br/>
will be on board with not institutionalizing our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Buuuut I am writing since I&#39;d be really appreciative of hearing of <br/>
how other parents with really intense kids manage to replenish <br/>
themselves and make sure everyone else in the home&#39;s needs and wants <br/>
are being met. Our oldest is bright and very busy. He needs to be <br/>
with us (and that&#39;s me mostly) all of the time. He does not really <br/>
play on his own at all and needs to be monitored closely when he is <br/>
playing with his younger brother. We have gone through really smooth <br/>
phases with him where I can actually eat breakfast before noon <br/>
sometimes, get out of my pajamas and maybe even get a cup of tea. But <br/>
there are many days that those things are not possible because I am <br/>
meeting his endless needs and/or protecting ds2 simply by being right <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the home he is so easy since he is a major observer. He <br/>
just is so busy soaking everything up. So I do my best to get out of <br/>
the house as much as possible. The difficulty is my youngest would <br/>
love to be home more to play with his toys and gets tired from all <br/>
the constant &quot;field trips&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear any suggestions. We&#39;re going through a particularly <br/>
challenging spell right now and dh and I are getting drained.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Susan</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he needs a lot of stimulation, but its not really <br/>
clear what kind - is he really social? physical? you say he &quot;soaks <br/>
everything up&quot; - can you bring more things into the home for him <br/>
to &quot;soak up&quot;? Or doesn &quot;going out&quot; meet some other needs of his - <br/>
social, maybe, since he needs to be with you alot when he&#39;s home? Or <br/>
is there a caretaking issue going on? Are you better at meeting his <br/>
needs proactively when y&#39;all are out? Alternately, does he have more <br/>
chances to be independent when y&#39;all are out? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d look hard at what the 6yo is getting from being out and <br/>
see if you can bring more of that home. At the same time, I&#39;d look <br/>
for ways to make &quot;going out&quot; more comfortable for the 3yo - making a <br/>
cozy nest in the car, for example, or bringing a tiny play-tent so <br/>
he can have somewhere to retreat to. Maybe a portable game or dvd <br/>
player so he can have some down time while the other is exploring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824259660">Hmmm, it&#39;s hard to describe clearly a child because we&#39;re all so <br/>
complex aren&#39;t we? Sam is one of those kids who didn&#39;t walk or talk <br/>
until very &quot;late&quot;, needed to be in physical contact with me a lot, <br/>
had great separation anxiety, nursed constantly but at the same time <br/>
was always fascinated with everything going on around us. He&#39;d sit in <br/>
my lap or the sling and watch the world go by. If a stranger spoke to <br/>
him, he&#39;d blink rapidly as though he were trying to make himself or <br/>
them disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Either I or dh has always been with him, aside from brief times off <br/>
with Grandma or Grandpa (to whom he is very attached). Sam doing an <br/>
activity without one of us is very new (these two 3-hour sessions a <br/>
week at the Waldorf home). This was something he wanted to do but I <br/>
went with him the first five times (with his little brother Quinn). <br/>
Each time I&#39;d ask after a while if he&#39;d mind if I went off for a walk <br/>
or something but he wanted me to stay. The sixth time after an hour I <br/>
asked him if he was okay with Quinn and I going to run some errands. <br/>
He was completely fine with it. So this is a big change for us. He <br/>
has been acquainted with this woman for several years as she puts on <br/>
kid&#39;s shows at many summer events around here. A few of the kids <br/>
there are also good friends of his. All of the kids at this place, <br/>
except one, are homeschoolers or unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Until his brother was born he was an &quot;easy&quot; kid. Easy because all his <br/>
needs were being met. He needed to be in constant reach of me and I <br/>
was always there. Over the last three years he has gone from a quiet <br/>
toddler who always just sat and watched to a child who rarely stops <br/>
talking and is always going a mile a minute cutting up pieces of <br/>
paper into tiny pieces or writing endless receipts for something. But <br/>
I have to be involved in this. He is very sweet and very fun. Under <br/>
the dining room table he has a restaurant, a toy store, and an <br/>
office. This morning I &quot;ordered&quot; a chai latte and toast from him and <br/>
I had to fill out five forms, sign my name in three different places, <br/>
all these papers got stapled together, then he wrote me a &quot;check&quot; and <br/>
had me sign one more time on a receipt. He is busy. The difficulty is <br/>
that he needs me to be there involved all the time. But I have <br/>
another child too! The problems arise when Quinn wanders into the <br/>
fray and wants to get under the dining room table (the precious zone) <br/>
or wants to nurse, wants a story read, then Sam can sometimes lose <br/>
control. Quinn gets bitten, pinched, kicked and so do I. Sometimes I <br/>
gently restrain Sam while talking to him gently, identifying what I <br/>
feel he might be feeling, telling him I need to keep everyone safe in <br/>
the house. Sometimes it takes an hour for him to calm down. He needs <br/>
all of me, sharing me or dh with Quinn is what causes almost all of <br/>
his meltdowns. On a bad day, I might spend up to three hours dealing <br/>
with these situations. It&#39;s hard for me to shower, eat or get dressed <br/>
on these days.<br/>
<br/>
We have had some very good phases where the two boys have played well <br/>
together. Sam has demonstated good negotiating skills with Quinn <br/>
(which I don&#39;t even expect for a 6-yr old) and can be very sweet with <br/>
and protective of Quinn. I&#39;m asking what others with intense kids do <br/>
to help get through their kids&#39; phases since we are going through a <br/>
particularly challenging one right now.<br/>
<br/>
Away from home the things that he really likes are watching real <br/>
people working. Ds2 loves this too. We&#39;ll stop and sit down on the <br/>
sidewalk for an hour if there&#39;s a window washer working, an excavator <br/>
digging, a concrete mixer pouring. He is too uncomfortable asking <br/>
anyone questions but I&#39;ll ask lots of questions for him when he asks <br/>
me to. We&#39;ll ask the parking meter reader questions, the post office <br/>
worker filling up the posties&#39; drop boxes, anything we see.<br/>
<br/>
But we can&#39;t spend all our time out. Ds2 loves many of the same <br/>
things but he loves being home as well and eventually he&#39;ll be beside <br/>
himself saying &quot;Go home!&quot; Ds1 also likes being home but my feeling is <br/>
that our little house with so many toys wings Sam out a bit. But like <br/>
someone else who posted about her daughter here a while back, he is <br/>
one of those kids that loves novelty, new things, new experiences. So <br/>
we hit a lot of garage sales and thrift shops to meet these needs. He <br/>
gets intensely attached to anything that comes into the house. <br/>
Occasionally we pick out things to return to thrift shops or to drop <br/>
at friends&#39; houses with younger children. I feel that if our house <br/>
were far less busy clutter-wise, he&#39;d be calmer. He has some great <br/>
playmates with a pretty wide age range but lately he&#39;s unable to <br/>
handle the excitement of anyone more than one other person coming <br/>
over. For now we are doing everything we can to keep social <br/>
interactions successful so he doesn&#39;t feel badly later and so other <br/>
parents don&#39;t label him.<br/>
<br/>
So please what do those with intense kids do so that the other kids <br/>
in the house get a piece of you too (and your own personal hygiene <br/>
doesn&#39;t fall completely off the map)?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513997337">My dd is very intense. She is 10 (almost 11) now and she is in a different<br/>
space. When she was younger I would try to get help. I was fortunate to have<br/>
a close friend with an older dd who loved my dd and would play with her from<br/>
time to time, giving me a break from the intensity. She even taught my dd to<br/>
swing on the swings by herself. I got to relax, shower etc. I don&#39;t know<br/>
about the relational issues as dd felt so intense to me that I waited to<br/>
have #2 until she was almost 6. I was still able to give her a lot at that<br/>
age. She was almost 8 before ds began to assert his preferences, namely to<br/>
stay home and play (like your second). And I had to be quite attentive to<br/>
her socialization (with any other child) as she doesn&#39;t pick up clues very<br/>
well. geez, I hope this doesn&#39;t make her sound bad or like I don&#39;t<br/>
appreciate her many wonderful qualities. I am trying to be concise.<br/>
Is there anyone who can help you on a regular basis? Even an hour or 2 twice<br/>
a week. Or even someone willing to stay at home with ds2. If that might help<br/>
you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480193978">Thanks Faith,<br/>
<br/>
It helps hearing how others cope. Your dd doesn&#39;t sound &quot;bad&quot; at all. <br/>
I know what you mean, intense kids have really incredible qualities. <br/>
For many of them I think their brains are just going way too fast, <br/>
everything needs to be now and exactly what they have in mind. For my <br/>
ds1, when he has all of me, he is calm, thoughtful, and really a joy <br/>
to be with. Ds2 goes to bed a couple hours earlier than Sam, so Sam <br/>
and I always have a couple of hours in the evening to play games, <br/>
read, talk, do projects together. And these are my favorite times <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
We have had two wonderful days now. I find that often when I&#39;m just <br/>
starting to feel like I&#39;m going to crack and I reach out for help, <br/>
the challenge goes away or shifts. I used to joke that all I had to <br/>
do is complain about a nursing issue at a La Leche League meeting and <br/>
the issue would go away the next day.<br/>
<br/>
I think your idea of getting someone to spend time with one or both <br/>
kids would be a good idea. There are so many homeschoolers in this <br/>
area I may even look for a pre-teen to act as a mother&#39;s helper when <br/>
I&#39;m home and just need a bit of a break. It should be fun for the <br/>
boys too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear more about how others with more than one child <br/>
manage to honour each child&#39;s needs/wants when they really differ <br/>
from the other child&#39;s. I find so much of my day is spent coaching <br/>
through situations of, &quot;okay how can we help both of you to be happy <br/>
[or needs/wants met] now.&quot;<br/>
