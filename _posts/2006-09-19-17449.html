<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887183327">we are in our 4th year of homeschooling. each year I start out with a <br/>
great plan.  With each new school year we get completely off track.  I <br/>
get stressed out then the kids get stressed out. this happens sooner <br/>
and sooner each year.  then I give up.  We end up just taking it slow <br/>
and relaxing.  they still learn - just not what I planned.  I can&#39;t <br/>
force school each day.  <br/>
<br/>
Trusting that this is the right thing to do is much like how I felt <br/>
when my oldest daughter was born.  I knew I wanted to breastfeed her so <br/>
the hospital gave me a booklet on the subject.  I read it over and over <br/>
wanting to do it right.  My grandmother came in and read it.  She <br/>
promptly threw it away!  She said &quot;when she cries - feed her!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I followed my grandmother&#39;s advice then and now I want that same peace <br/>
in homeschooling.  after all I made this decision for the same <br/>
reasons.  I love my children.  I want the best for them.  I want to <br/>
have a good relationship with them.  <br/>

<br/>
The same thing goes with unschooling if you are naturally involved in your<br/>
children�s lives.  (For some people interacting with their kids doesn�t seem<br/>
to come very naturally) Throw the curriculum away and focus on the kids and<br/>
their needs.  What can you do to help them follow their interests?  What<br/>
kind of things can you bring home that might interests them?  (not thinking<br/>
specifically educational things here, but cool things, movies, games, etc.)<br/>
Have fun with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252117554">Marie... glad to have you here!  Grab unschooling and go with it!  There is<br/>
no other way... it doesn&#39;t work by just *testing the waters* with it!  Be<br/>
prepared to unlearn to learn... meaning be prepared to unlearn many of the<br/>
things that you think *should be* and be ready to learn how they *really<br/>
are*.  I feel like I&#39;m talking jibberish...<br/>
