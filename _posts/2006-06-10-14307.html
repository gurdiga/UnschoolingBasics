But thought $30 was a lot to spend if they don&#39;t hatch. Have any of <br/>
you done this? Were you successful?<br/>
<br/>
 What do you do with the quail once they hatch? Do you set them free <br/>
or keep them as pets?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257608056">That is such a cool deal! It says on their site not to<br/>
release them in the wild. lol. I would just think it&#39;s<br/>
cruel to release them. Although we have quail in our<br/>
yard everyday. Right now, they are raising little<br/>
chicks. They grow so fast. I would love to do it. We<br/>
just don&#39;t have the room, that&#39;s something more to<br/>
consider than price, imo. I&#39;d love to hear about it if<br/>
you do it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95299138">The site also offered the incubator without the eggs.  This is great for my family since Hawaii doesn&#39;t allow many types of animals to be introduced.  We&#39;re going to contact some farmers that offer chicken eggs and hatch them- then give the chicks back to the farmer.  That might be an idea for anyone without the ability to keep the quail.<br/>
