<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477863068">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
I guess you mean kids to play with during school hours? Is there a <br/>
homeschool group you can join or other homeschooled kids he can <br/>
invite over? I can&#39;t really think of any other way he can play with <br/>
kids during school hours except that. <br/>
As far as after school or weekends...are there kids in your <br/>
neighborhood that he can play with? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134081369">Is there a play group or reading group or homeschooling group in your area? Maybe library hour? Can he help you work somehow? Or play next to you while you work? Sounds a lot like my son. We have loads of art supplies  - markers, crayons, pencils, paper, glue, glitter, pipecleaners, stickers, etc. that he can use when he wants. It keeps him fairly quiet and occupied.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781313045">Does he have to be supervised by you? Can you get a local young adult or elderly person to supervise him in exchange for something from you? Baking, typing services, babysitting co-op?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990065963">butchers paper is a great thing. So it the even wider paper you can get at office and teachers supplies store. I put it up on the wall and have my kids make me a mural. <br/>
   <br/>
  As far as other kids to play with .....you say he is already in dance and art ? that should help some. Here there a local community theatre group? would that intrest him?<br/>
   <br/>
  What about your work? I know you work from home but are there set hours you have to go by? Would it be possible to do some work early and some of the work later in the eve ? then you could have a chunk of time in the middle of the afternoon to not just supervise but to go get sticks, draw picks in the sand, fly kites , laugh and roll in the mud with him <br/>
