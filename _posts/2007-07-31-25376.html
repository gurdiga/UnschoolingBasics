<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467438228">Hi all.  I want to post real quick to clarify that I am not the one  <br/>
who said anything snarky<br/>
about this list.  I don&#39;t know if anybody thought that, but since I  <br/>
was the one who started a<br/>
thread that lead to some discussion of porn and kids running in the  <br/>
street, I just want to<br/>
make sure no one thinks that poster on another list is me.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, thank you to everyone who continued dialoguing with me on  <br/>
my topic.  I really am<br/>
getting a lot from everyone, and do wish to continue the dialogue.  I  <br/>
spent almost four hours<br/>
that one night replying to everyone, and I just can&#39;t take the time  <br/>
to do that again just yet.  I<br/>
hope you&#39;ll still be open to continuing when I can get to it.<br/>

<br/>
Just to clarify, the person wasn&#39;t anyone who has posted in several<br/>
weeks as far as I know. She had threatened to leave the list a long<br/>
time ago, but apparently decided to hang out just to find fodder for<br/>
badmouthing the list. I guess that was more entertaining than a<br/>
discussion.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed all the &quot;porn&quot; dialogue...haha. <br/>
<br/>
Off to Asheville now, I want to catch up tomorrow. Having lotsa<br/>
thoughts about various posts. Have a great night everyone!<br/>
