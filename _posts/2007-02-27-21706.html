<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926441337">First, let me say thank you to everyone who answered my previous <br/>
questions (regarding a reluctant spouse, etc.)!  You all are such an <br/>
encouragement and wonderful dose of reality for me!  <br/>
  Now that my husband is in complete agreement with me that we need to <br/>
unschool our boys, we are trying to figure it out financially.  Does <br/>
anyone work from home?  How do you make it work?  Does anyone have any <br/>
suggestions for a job that I can do from home?  I know working is not <br/>
ideal, but it IS a necessity for our family.  Any thoughts/tips would <br/>
be so very helpful!  I just want to get started unschooling right away!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906275845">Depends - what is your background? do you have a marketable skill of<br/>
some form (need not be a &#39;profession&#39; as such - things you see as a<br/>
hobby can often turn a profit in one way or another - for example,<br/>
teaching classes at a community college in photography or pottery or<br/>
whatever, not always necessary to have a degree for that sort of thing<br/>
if you&#39;re not looking for tenure)? A network of former<br/>
coworkers/employers to work from? can you work around your spouse&#39;s<br/>
schedule (that is, work in the evenings if he works days, work days if<br/>
he works nights, and so on)? How much work/income do you need? Would 20<br/>
hours at $10/hr be enough? 30 hrs? fulltime? Would you need to subtract<br/>
childcare expenses? transportation costs? professional attire (whatever<br/>
that might be)? <br/>
 <br/>
I worked from home for a year and some before DS was born (DH was in<br/>
college fulltime - long story). I worked on contract for my former<br/>
employer - I was in OK and they were in CT. That&#39;s why contacts/networks<br/>
can be useful - they already knew me, knew I had the skills they needed,<br/>
knew I&#39;d do the work I was being paid to do - it was a win/win<br/>
situation. I also did a short term project for another company because a<br/>
couple of former coworkers had moved to that company and knew I had the<br/>
skills to complete a particular project.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d suggest doing an inventory of what your background is, what your<br/>
networking capacity is, what the costs associated with your working<br/>
would be, what kind of money and schedule you&#39;d need, then see what is<br/>
available where you are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959233873">I work from home and it can be done.  It is easier now that my ds is <br/>
older.  When he was a toddler especially it was really a balancing <br/>
act.  I have a couple of strategies that are working and have been <br/>
for awhile.  I get up an hour or two before ds, and I try to do my <br/>
more focused work then.  When he was little, there was another window <br/>
during nap(s).  Also, dh gets home from work at 3pm, so there&#39;s <br/>
another window after that.  It really can be a challenge to juggle <br/>
and you have to be a good multi tasker and able to change gears from <br/>
work to mom to work again fairly quickly and smoothly.  That said, <br/>
I&#39;ve been doing it for almost 10 years and I am no super human.  Now <br/>
that ds is older, he has things he likes to do on his own so if I <br/>
need to work, that&#39;s the plan.  I try to keep him posted ahead of <br/>
time about my work schedule so there are few surpises.  I think you <br/>
can do it if you are flexible, creative and willing to persevere.  <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do, I do!  Believe me, it ain&#39;t perfect, but I&#39;m really grateful <br/>
that I can do it, and so is my son.  I do medical transcription, and <br/>
I think if I could do it over again, I&#39;d try to do something from <br/>
home that involved less of my brain and my attention so that I could <br/>
be doing my work and still be able to talk and listen to Liam.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s good about what I do is that I can be fairly flexible.  I can <br/>
stop typing at a moment&#39;s notice and drive Liam somewhere, or get up <br/>
and whip him up something to eat, or help him spell something or... <br/>
well, you get the picture, and then I can get back to work later <br/>
on.  What&#39;s not good about it is that I am always behind in my work <br/>
and I feel kind of lousy about that.  I&#39;m an independent contractor, <br/>
so I get no paid time off or sick time or anything, and no vacation, <br/>
but I work my butt off, and then I can take time when I feel the need <br/>
to and nobody can tell me I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend MT for someone who wants to, as you say, &quot;get <br/>
started...right away.&quot;  It takes a long while to be able to earn good <br/>
money doing it, and you&#39;re not likely to be able to find work from <br/>
home right away anyway because experience is really necessary to be <br/>
able to do this kind of work in an isolated environment.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I had it to do over, I&#39;d try to do some kind of <br/>
craft/artisan work or gardening work-- something with my hands that <br/>
my kid(s) could get involved in, too, if s/he wanted to.  It&#39;s really <br/>
hard for Liam to help me out with my transcription work (but I&#39;m a <br/>
lot fun to play Scrabble with!), and I&#39;m a great resource for all <br/>
things anatomical!<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I gotta get back to work!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877437756">there are a variety of ways to work while unschooling.  takes creativity - <br/>
but so does unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
when i&#39;ve needed to work i taught art classes to kids so my children could <br/>
come along.  i then organized classes.  i also have organized many <br/>
homeschooling activities so that my cost is discounted.  discounts or <br/>
freebies are akin to making money or saving money.<br/>
<br/>
there was a period of time when i worked from home writing and hired <br/>
childcare to come into the house and be with my dd while i was here so that <br/>
if she needed me i was available.  it took practice on my part to be able to <br/>
work with her in the house.  in truth the best writing i got done was when <br/>
dh took dd out for the day when he could.  i had always managed to find very <br/>
inexpensive and wonderful people who are still very much important part of <br/>
our lives (adopted grandmother and adopted older sister - now 24).   i help <br/>
out for exactly what i wanted and always found it.  its worth the effort if <br/>
that means you can stay home with your kids when they are young.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641712523">Hi Jamie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I work from home, as does my husband. It was really tough the first few<br/>
years, particularly because both of us were working from home. My husband<br/>
designs and builds furniture, I am a massage practitioner and also act as<br/>
administrator/bookkeeper for my bil&#39;s landscaping business. I started out<br/>
working during my eldest daughters nap times and after she went to bed. I<br/>
was exhausted all the time. I need at least 7 hours sleep, even if it&#39;s<br/>
somewhat broken sleep (we have a family bed, and my daughter flops like a<br/>
fish on dry land :-)). I have since hired a trio of &quot;playmates&quot; - otherwise<br/>
known as sitters - who are young and enthusiastic and love to engage and<br/>
play with my kids. My office is in the main playroom of the house, so we&#39;re<br/>
usually all together, unless my daughter chooses to play somewhere else.<br/>
(Right now, she and &quot;her friend Kat&quot; are outside exploring the backyard,<br/>
looking for signs of spring and playing with the dog.) Having this trio has<br/>
made it possible for me to do my work without there being the tension<br/>
between my work commitments and wanting/needing to be with the kids. They<br/>
sitters are here anywhere from 12-20 hours/week, usually starting in the<br/>
mornings, leaving our afternoons free to spend time with our unschooling<br/>
friends (none of whom even wake up before 10 am! LOL), play, paint, snuggle,<br/>
whatever we want. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you have decent computer skills, there&#39;s a LOT you can do from home.<br/>
Doing data entry for an Access or Excel system is a pretty straightforward<br/>
thing to learn (hey, I did it and I started out as a computer illiterate!)<br/>
and, depending on where you live, you can make anywhere from $20-30 and<br/>
hour. As your skills grow, you can take on more responsibility, and make<br/>
more money. I started out doing just data entry and creating invoices, and<br/>
have grown into client relations (meaning, I chase down the money when<br/>
clients don&#39;t pay on time :-)), tax preparation, quarterly sales tax filing,<br/>
bill paying, etc. At this point I am being paid a percentage of my bil&#39;s<br/>
gross. It&#39;s not something I could live on as an only income, but it makes a<br/>
huge difference when combined with my husbands. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned medical transcription. My sil does this, too. Again,<br/>
if your skills are decent, and your learning curve is short, you can do<br/>
okay, and even well with this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then there are the non-computer jobs like house/pet-sitting. My mom uses a<br/>
young mother of 2 to care for her dog and cats, water her plants, take in<br/>
the mail, etc, while she is away. She pays (I believe) $12-15 a day for this<br/>
service, and the woman takes care of about 4 homes a day. Not a lot of money<br/>
on it&#39;s own, but again, when combined with her husband&#39;s income, it really<br/>
makes a difference.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Use your imagination, think about the things you love to do, and see how<br/>
those things can benefit someone else, and you&#39;ll have the beginnings of a<br/>
home-based business!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
