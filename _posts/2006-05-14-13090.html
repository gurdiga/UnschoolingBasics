<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511379741">***he gave several people we <br/>
knew who work in the restaurant origami things- they didn&#39;t quite know <br/>
how to respond, looked confused but were polite.<br/>
he went around asking everyone if they did Origami too. no one did. <br/>
and he got a lot of weird looks.***<br/>
<br/>
Were you embarrassed?   You missed a moment to really watch your son and<br/>
get a glimpse of the joy he was experiencing.  *You* turned it into<br/>
something weird.  : (<br/>
<br/>
***We went to a campfire and he asked his dad to bring his origami book <br/>
and paper and a flashlight. he made Origami all night.***<br/>
<br/>
Would you be writing here if one of the other moms there had brought her<br/>
knitting and worked on a sweater all night?  <br/>
<br/>
***he has not eaten despite my <br/>
sugestions that maybe he needs to do that and its now 5pm. ***<br/>
<br/>
Take him some crackers and cheese or sliced apples;  Anything he can grab<br/>
quickly and shove into his head with one hand.  Take him a drink.   Put<br/>
it right beside him, tell him it&#39;s there.  <br/>
<br/>
***I wonder if this will become an issue if I do not <br/>
strongly encourage/remind him to eat, take a shower ect.***<br/>
<br/>
More likely it will become an issue if you work against him.   Sit down<br/>
with him and ask him to show you how to make something.  Be with him, be<br/>
engaged, talk to him about it, learn something about origami yourself and<br/>
share it with him,  help him hang his cranes like a mobile, and maybe<br/>
you&#39;ll begin to understand why he likes it so much.   Maybe you&#39;d like<br/>
kirigami, too.   Maybe you could get all your Christmas cards made early,<br/>
if you sit with him and do kirigami cards while he enjoys his paper<br/>
folding.  Don&#39;t turn his joyful work into a disorder. <br/>
<br/>
Look here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/e5jos">http://tinyurl.com/e5jos</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Google &quot;paper folding math&quot; or &quot;paper folding geometry&quot; or paper folding<br/>
art&quot; and see how many people out there believe it&#39;s important work.  But<br/>
please don&#39;t try to teach him about math if you do look at some of the<br/>
google hits.   Let his work be about what he wants, not what you&#39;d like<br/>
to turn it into, not about what&#39;s acceptable to you.  <br/>
<br/>
When surgeons work twenty four hours and don&#39;t stop to sleep or eat, we<br/>
say they&#39;re dedicated.  When kids work twenty four hours and don&#39;t stop<br/>
to sleep or eat people say &quot;obsessed.&quot;   It&#39;s insulting.  It one more way<br/>
we openly discriminate against kids.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497841958">***Maybe limiting the time spent doing the origami will help.***<br/>
<br/>
No it won&#39;t.  Limits only make people want the thing more.  Children&#39;s<br/>
lives are already full of  irritating limits.  Their size prohibits<br/>
reaching some things they&#39;d like to touch.  Their small hand prohibit<br/>
holding some tools they&#39;d like to use.  Lets not be giving advice about<br/>
how to further limit children.   This list is here to help people open up<br/>
a world of opportunities for their kids. <br/>
<br/>
***Like <br/>
say after you eat you can go do this.... I tell my son that he has to <br/>
do something else for awhile then can go back.***<br/>
<br/>
After you learn about unschooling you can offer advice here.  You have to<br/>
read about unschooling and then you can come back. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I know this does go <br/>
against unschooling but sometimes I really feel we need to do something <br/>
else. ***<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t offer advice that goes against unschooling on this list, please.  <br/>
Let the &quot;something else&quot; be something that helps kids move out into a big<br/>
world not something that confines kids to a small box.<br/>
<br/>
***If you go to the restraunt maybe the origami stuff needs to stay <br/>
home.***<br/>
<br/>
I always take a notebook to a restaurant so I can write down ideas or<br/>
words or phrases I might want to use in some awful poem or story. <br/>
My friend always takes her phone so she can call other friends and say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m having strawberry pie right now what are you doing.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I would just try limiting because it can make you nervous.***<br/>
<br/>
Making kids feel bad so moms can feel better is terrible.  It&#39;s terrible<br/>
advice and it&#39;s a terrible tactic and a mean thing to do.  Moms are<br/>
supposed to be finding ways to make the world available to kids.  <br/>
<br/>
***He will move onto a new passion one day, until then just <br/>
encourage(sometimes strongly) something new***<br/>
<br/>
This little person has found something beautiful that he loves.  He&#39;s<br/>
enjoying himself, he&#39;s happy, he&#39;s making art and doing important work . <br/>
<br/>
His mom should help him do what he wants to do.<br/>

<br/>
 No I did not.<br/>
 I was not embarassed, I simply sat quietly and smiled thinking that <br/>
he is one of the most giving people I have ever known. but I noticed <br/>
the looks others gave him and the ones they gave me as if to say &quot;is <br/>
he normal?&quot; You can&#39;t not notice the looks. I just smiled and <br/>
shrugged.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Again I was not complaining just telling it like it is to <br/>
illistrate the depth of his focus.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Take him some crackers and cheese or sliced apples;  Anything he <br/>

<br/>
Serriously, I have been his parent long enough to do that and I did <br/>
and he shpowed no interest. a bit of a worry for me but I in no way <br/>
expect him to starve himself It is just a drastic change for him to <br/>
ignore his favorite foods for many meals in a row.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I wrote the post not to beliettle him but to illustrate why I <br/>
might be nervious and to see if anyone else ever felt nervious or <br/>
experianced somthing similer.<br/>
but thanks for your imput.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55669046">**...we do have to limit TV and such.***<br/>
***...limit certain things just to get my kids to go outside and get<br/>
fresh <br/>
air.***<br/>
<br/>
***I do have limits when we just want to sit <br/>
down and eat. ***<br/>
<br/>
***... demanding is actually putting it lightly...*** <br/>
***He has a extremely bad temper&gt;&gt;&gt;***<br/>
***My oldest has a violent temper and youngest mimics what he sees in big<br/>
bubba. ***<br/>
<br/>
***I am the one who had to deal with him taking scissors to a kids ear in<br/>
school ***<br/>
<br/>
***It worked for us never aid it would for anyone else.. ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How have the limits worked, then?   Because if your family has had these<br/>
major issues it sounds like the limits haven&#39;t worked.  <br/>
<br/>
There are certain personality types that submit to control (few) and<br/>
certain others (more common) that resist.  The more control, the greater<br/>
the resistance.   The trap is in thinking that we can ever control<br/>
another person in the first place.  The trick is in working with the<br/>
other person to help them reach their goals in healthy ways.  <br/>
<br/>
Some moms here can tell you about their peaceful family life without<br/>
limits.  It doesn&#39;t happen overnight in cases where there have been tight<br/>
controls on kids, but the continuation of control will/can lead to a<br/>
damaged relationship and a stressful home life. <br/>
<br/>
***So maybe I need to move <br/>
to the homeschool group because we still have schedules to keep here***<br/>
<br/>
Lots of us have schedules and commitments.  That&#39;s not an excuse.  You<br/>
might find exactly what you want at another list, support for how you&#39;re<br/>
doing things now, sympathy for what you&#39;ve been through, agreement about<br/>
your son.  But if you&#39;re willing to look at what has or hasn&#39;t really<br/>
worked to help your son be happier, people here can help you.   By the<br/>
time some parents realize their kids need something different there have<br/>
been years and years of unhappy family relations.  That won&#39;t change<br/>
overnight but it won&#39;t change at all if the parents don&#39;t change<br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I have an adult scissors story.  My friend had always wanted to be a<br/>
teacher.  Somewhere along the way that job was glamorized in his head. <br/>
He didn&#39;t live with his own two kids and maybe part of it was his desire<br/>
to be a positive force in lives of children.   When he was in his forties<br/>
he became what&#39;s called a non traditional teacher in Arkansas.   He<br/>
taught for two years.  He became very disillusion when he couldn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;control&quot; the kids.   His weeks became power struggles with the kids.  <br/>
The school had a policy against hoodies and one kid wouldn&#39;t get rid of<br/>
his hoodie.   My friend took scissors to the kid&#39;s sweatshirt and cut the<br/>
hood off.  Right in the classroom.   A grown man, who *chose* to be at<br/>
the school everyday, got so caught up in his struggle for power he took<br/>
scissors to a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
If your kid is fighting for control to the point he&#39;s not thinking<br/>
clearly, it&#39;s probably an indication that he feels powerless.  People<br/>
can&#39;t live that way.  He needs new tools for coping with the things that<br/>
are out of his control (other people) and he needs help from you in<br/>
finding ways to have control of his own life.    <br/>

resist and it is very hard to get rid of it. His outlook on life will  <br/>
be through the lenses of resisting other people trying to control him.<br/>
