<div id="ygrps-yiv-640032477">&quot; I<br/>
think many parents really confuse, children needing consistency of a <br/>
life structured by parents, teachers, etc., with what I see their <br/>
true need, being......<br/>
to feel secure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I think it means we are dependable and trustworthy as parents, not <br/>
that we dole out the same punishment each time (which is how I&#39;ve <br/>
seen &quot;consistency&quot; misused).<br/>
I try to be consistent in what I say and what I mean. I try to be <br/>
consistently dependable so they can count on me to be there when <br/>
they need help.<br/>
Consistency is good. Punishment isn&#39;t.<br/>
