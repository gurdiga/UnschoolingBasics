It&#39;s fairly fast growing and has instructions in it - everything<br/>
except the potato.  :)  I&#39;m sure that Barnes and Noble has the same<br/>
sort of little kits.  Ours is located in our cafe and the ones at B&N<br/>
are up near the registers.  Maybe something for your son to do to get<br/>
started.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what it is but I&#39;m feeling a bit better today.  Still<br/>
have a achy bod and feeling a tad congested but do not have a cough or<br/>
sore throat that usually accompanies the flu...maybe the elderberry<br/>
and rest worked?  <br/>
