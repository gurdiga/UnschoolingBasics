<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775596714">We are looking into buying our first microscope and was wondering if any of you might have any suggestions or feedback.  The two I have been considering are the My First Lab I-Explore Scope which is binocular and can only view 3D objects (no slides) and the My First Lab Duo Scope which is monocular (not sure if that is the right term) and can view slides as well as 3D objects.  My son is almost 5 yrs old so I like the idea of the binocular option as I think it will be much easier for him to see but I have never used a microscope that cannot view slides so I don&#39;t know what to make of that.  Any feedback or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  We are trying not to spend more than $70 or so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748579319">I have an old monocular microscope with slides, and I&#39;d recommend just about anything else! Not that we don&#39;t use it, but especially for a younger child I&#39;d get something easier to use and more versatile... and sturdy! Something your kid can use without you biting your tongue so you don&#39;t say &quot;oh, be careful, you&#39;re going to crack the slide&quot; too many time :S<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think &quot;what&#39;s good for science&quot; so much as &quot;what do my kids want to play with?&quot; I&#39;ve heard of gadgets which plug into the tv or computer and I&#39;m hoping someone will chime in with a name so I can put it on my xmas list before I forget again! &quot;Science&quot; is exploration - so give a kid a neat magnifying toy and have fun with it.<br/>
