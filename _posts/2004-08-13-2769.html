<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821301631">Thank you all for your words of inspiration and enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
  You have encouraged me to look deeper into the whole situation and I have <br/>
realized that:<br/>
  <br/>
- I need to lighten up. He IS still reading. And I am amazed at what he HAS <br/>
read over the past years even though he&#39;s not quite 8. Hmmm...so I&#39;ll be happy <br/>
with that. <br/>
  <br/>
 - Also he is his OWN person with his OWN interests and passions. <br/>
&quot;I&quot; detest comic books, but he loves them! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 - He listens to an enormous amount of books on tape each night before bed. I <br/>
forgot that! And it&#39;s good literature too...and mostly all unabridged ! <br/>
<br/>
 - He does read alot of things ONLINE. Forgot about that one too!<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s hard to ignore my feelings completely...because &quot;you feel what you <br/>
feel&quot; but I think I understand now.<br/>
  <br/>
  And I love the idea about talking to him about and helping him find books <br/>
he wants to read and even reading them myself. I know my son absolutely &quot;glows&quot; <br/>
when I ask him about Yugioh and Star Wars and Harry Potter. But honestly <br/>
after 10 minutes my eyes glaze over...but Shhh! ..He need not know that &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again !<br/>

wonderful journey..Unschooling :)<br/>
