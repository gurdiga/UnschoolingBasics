<div id="ygrps-yiv-422749819">***...yours was VERY specific that mental disease or<br/>
defect manifests as &quot;pulling the heads off chickens&quot;....***<br/>
 <br/>
I assumed readers would recognize I was making a comparison between an extreme behavior and a normal behavior and not a statement about *the specific* (is their only one?)  manifestation of mental illness.  If all people with mental illness only pulled the heads off chickens it&#39;d be easy to diagnose and treat.  No chickens, no chicken head pulling. No problem.  Some out of work farmers, according to Ren.<br/>
<br/>
Some people with personality disorders can be extreme in their behaviors and can be violent.   Some people without a personality disorder can be violent.  Some people with hemorrhoids can be violent and some people without hemorrhoids can be violent.  Getting upset about an obvious exaggeration for the sake of comparison is overreacting.   (I wanted to write CRAZY there but thought better of it.)<br/>
