objects, etc. She likes the dog a lot, but for some reason she is also<br/>
violent with her. I feel like the only good way to protect the dog is to<br/>
keep them separated, although that means locking the dog up when we are in<br/>

closely monitoring them when they play together.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear other peoples suggestions on how to handle this as<br/>
well.  My almost 2 year old is very rough with our dog and cats, picking<br/>
them up by the tail, smashing their heads into the floor, pulling ears,<br/>
poking et cetera.  She thinks it is funny when they hiss or growl, or when I<br/>
snatch her away from it.  I have very tolerant pets and only one of them has<br/>
bit her, so of course she doesn&#39;t bother that one cat.<br/>
<br/>
And not to hyjack the thread, but how do you deal with physical<br/>
aggressiveness in general?  My daughter gets very rough when she is tired,<br/>
to the extent that every night our family gets beat up in bed.  She has<br/>
broken my DH&#39;s glasses, given me a bloody nose, split both our lips, knocked<br/>
the air out of me et cetera.  She is never malicious about it, and thinks it<br/>
is hilarious the more frustrated we get, but in all honesty I find myself<br/>
getting INCREDIBLY upset to the point where I am not behaving toward her in<br/>
a manner I am at all comfortable with.  For example, last night I was asleep<br/>
on the bed and she jumped over my husband and body slammed me and the baby.<br/>
 I flew up shouting &quot;ENOUGH&quot; and meant to set her off the bed but ended up<br/>
misjudging the distance to the floor and smacking her legs into the ground.<br/>
 Obviously not acceptable in any way shape or form.  She started bawling,<br/>
the baby started bawling, and I started bawling.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t even know how to respond to this type of situation.  If I had<br/>
acted like this as a child I would have been spanked, and I don&#39;t want to do<br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088181030">One of my 2-yr old twins gets hyper violent too. She&#39;s also just started<br/>
punching or kicking when she&#39;s unhappy about something...usually when I try<br/>

or opening the hot oven. I have no idea how to handle it. I&#39;ve been trying<br/>
to treat her like I would anyone else who was unintentionally hurting<br/>
me...like telling her calmly, &quot;it hurts when you kick me&quot; but that&#39;s just<br/>
incentive for her to do it more  I tend to lose my patience and I ALWAYS<br/>
feel crappy after I do so. Plus, my other 2-yr old has better listening<br/>
skills and doesn&#39;t act out violently, so I sometimes wonder if my poor<br/>
little punchy baby feels singled out. I&#39;d appreciate any ideas...any...on<br/>
how to handle this better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may be helpful to change your evening routine, so that she has a chance to &quot;wind down&quot; earlier. Alternately, she may need a chance to be really active and physical before sleep - my 7yo races around the house like a mad thing for about an hour every evening or finds some other energetic bit of fun. Another consideration is how long since she&#39;s eaten. Some kids need a bite before bed to stablize their blood sugar, while others need a snack a couple hours before, but Not imediately before bed. <br/>

For instance, Mo used to get very frustrated and angry by people trying to *tell* her things. If she was leaning out a window, for instance, I might catch her around the waist and support her for a moment and then move her somewhere else, but without talking. That being said, I used to baby-sit for a girl who was exactly the opposite - I couldn&#39;t touch her at all without telling her clearly in words, first what I was doing and why or she would scream and lash out. <br/>
<br/>
In general, I&#39;ve always found it helpful to look carefully at what *I&#39;m* doing and look for things to change, and then experiment a little and see what works and what doesn&#39;t. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516435617">Thanks for the reply! Let&#39;s go with the window thing as an example. If she&#39;s<br/>
leaning out the window and I say &quot;Genevieve, please come back inside. You<br/>
might fall.&quot;...she climbs further out. She does the same thing if I go to<br/>
her and gently put my hand on her back. All of those kinds of corrections<br/>
just instigate her further. By contrast, her twin sister will come back<br/>
inside.  If I say &quot;Hey Genevieve, come on over here and look at this cool<br/>
thing that I know she loves.&quot; She&#39;ll say &quot;No, I&#39;m looking out the window.&quot;<br/>
and any approach toward her very predictably makes her climb more.  So, I&#39;ve<br/>
taken to gently scooping her up and away from the window, telling her that<br/>
i&#39;m afraid she will fall and giving her something else to play with (or even<br/>
a snack). This is when I know I&#39;ll get kicked or punched. It isn&#39;t painful<br/>
because she&#39;s little, but how can i help her find a better way to express<br/>
her frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Let me add that this goes for most any situation in which we have to ask her<br/>
to do something different than what she has decided she wants to do. I<br/>
understand her frustration, so I try very hard not to ask this of her very<br/>
often. But sometimes, when its a matter of safety especially, I have to and<br/>
I so wish she could understand that. Its not that I don&#39;t want you to run<br/>
free, but I don&#39;t want you to run out in front of a car.  Its not that I<br/>
don&#39;t want you to help me cook, but I don&#39;t want you to burn your fingers<br/>
when I can prevent it either. She&#39;s a very sweet, expressive, smart little<br/>
girl out-of-the-box thinker. She just wants to do things a certain way and<br/>
without any interference from me or her daddy or her sister.  I want to let<br/>
her do that, but I also want to keep her safe and not get beat up in the<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m brand new to the ideals of an unschooling life and am working hard<br/>
to learn when to let go and when to step in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of your help!...Laura<br/>

he pinches, punches, refuses to follow any request, command or suggestion even if he&#39;s bribed or begged!  he started this around 18 months and got over it a few months ago and now he&#39;s right back to it only WORSE! he&#39;ll look me straight in the eye when i make a request, demand, etc. and continue to do the opposite of what i want!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546512163">Thanks Chrissy for the commiseration. :) I do know how you feel.  We do have<br/>
good days, like today, where the twins are super sweet and playful. But even<br/>
on those days, she is completely, 100% only going to do things her way and<br/>
in her time. I think that stubborn streak is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL and it<br/>
will serve her well in life if she can teach herself to temper it a bit. It<br/>
isn&#39;t helpful when it means she&#39;s taking something she wants out of her<br/>
sisters hands (and making her sister cry) or breaking things that don&#39;t<br/>
belong to her or us (like the screen door of our rental house) or<br/>
endangering herself (like shoving an entire piece of bread in her mouth at<br/>
once just because i reminded her to take little bites) or pushing and<br/>
punching. I&#39;ve done everything possible to mitigate these situations, to<br/>
create a world where they are less likely to occur (like still cutting up<br/>
her food, teaching them how to trade, etc) ...but it is impossible to do<br/>
this for every situation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think its about being a middle child personally. Genevieve is a<br/>
twin...and they are the youngest kiddos in the house...and her sister has a<br/>
completely different temperament.  I don&#39;t want to take her anywhere where<br/>
she&#39;ll be labeled. But I have started trying techniques like those used by<br/>
parents and caregivers of kids with ADD and aspergers. Sometimes it helps<br/>
and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad for Genevieve because she spends so much time frustrated for no<br/>
reason. And I feel bad for her twin sister McKenna, she&#39;s such a<br/>
sweet-natured and easy going little girl and some days it seems she falls<br/>
into the shadows when we&#39;re trying to find something, anything that will<br/>
calm Genevieve down.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to maintain a balance and keep<br/>
your sanity. And some days are wonderful, happy, sweet, adorable and<br/>
unbelievably heartwarming.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Chrissy!<br/>

We learn too. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124562539">Let&#39;s see. I can&#39;t remember all the way back to when my two kids were 3, but we do watch the 3-yo nephew. Even though he didn&#39;t walk until he was 2 and is not talking a lot yet, he seems to be exactly what I would expect when it comes to behavior. <br/>

He&#39;s testing and exploring, he&#39;s trying to do things for himself, he&#39;s asserting himself, he&#39;s alternately sweet and cuddly and happy and over-the-top emotional and obstinate and uncooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Sound familiar? :)<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy being 3. (It is not easy being any age, really, something I try to remember as the kids go through each one. :) ) <br/>
<br/>
Everything is forbidden/delayed, all the fun stuff anyway. The pool -- you have to wait for someone to go with you. The car -- everyone gets to drive but you. The kitchen -- still blocked off. All this and you have very little, if any, concept of time.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we do change things to let him explore as much as possible but he&#39;s not going in the pool alone or in our tiny kitchen when something&#39;s cooking, etc. So there are frustrations in his day. <br/>
<br/>
And just trying to do normal things can be frustrating. I marvel at his patience in building with blocks and other things. He can play with those big Legos for a long time, it seems to me, for 3. But then one doesn&#39;t fit on or something falls and you can end up with a flying Lego. <br/>
<br/>
And we get tired and his Mom and Gramma get tired. The big kids are not always in the mood to do the same thing over and over again. The world is busy and he gets taken along to many things -- sometimes just for him but he&#39;s often just riding along -- I think it must be a blur sometimes even though we talk and explain. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no shrink on call here. We&#39;re just living with a 3-yo. Trying to remember not to overreact when he&#39;s particularly difficult. I suspect your psychiatrist would tell you this all sounds pretty normal. :)<br/>

<br/>
The trouble with saying &quot;this scares me bc you Might get hurt&quot; is that it undermines trust. Every moment she&#39;s successful without getting hurt she has proved you wrong, proved that you are not a trustworthy source of help or information. Your challenge is to rebuild that trust, by helping her do what she wants safely. Be her advocate, rather than her biggest obstacle. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************************<br/>
<br/>
I would be helpful to have an example. In general, though, how often do you like to be commanded bribed or begged? Do you typically follow requests or suggestions when you can&#39;t see the point of them? Young children are stuck in a world that doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense, surrounded by people who seem to be arbitrary and unreasonable. It doesn&#39;t matter how reasonable *you* think you are being - its the perspective of the child that matters. <br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, its not a good strategy to try to get young children to see an adult pov. They can&#39;t! They&#39;ve never been adults! But we adults have an ability they don&#39;t - we can try to envision others&#39; perspectives. We can see where children are coming from. It takes effort and practice, but we can do this, and find ways to be reasonable and helpful From the Perspective Of the Child! But like I said, examples help in terms of seeing *how* this can happen. <br/>
<br/>
Its important that young children feel capable, and that they feel like they have choices - even young children want to make some of their own decisions. So generally speaking, when younger children are lashing out, its good to look for ways to give them more options and help them feel capable. No and don&#39;t and &quot;you do this now&quot; leave children feeling powerless - its no wonder two and three yr olds have a reputation for being resisitant! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i am beginning to wonder if i should take him to a psychiatrist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like his behavior is very age-appropriate to me, although a therapist of any kind will likely tell you he &quot;needs limits&quot;. From an unschooling perspective, he has too many limits. He needs help finding ways to overcome those limits. Less nos and don&#39;ts and laters, more Yesses!<br/>

&gt; once just because i reminded her to take little bites)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You seem to do a lot of reminding and explaining! That may well be a big big part of the problem! Can you bite your tongue a bit more? Take a big, deep breath and wait five seconds before you say Anything about safety for awhile and use those five seconds (they&#39;ll seem terribly long in the moment) to come up with at least one other solution than saying &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve done everything possible to mitigate these situations, to<br/>

&gt; her food, teaching them how to trade, etc) ...but it is impossible to do<br/>
&gt; this for every situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is impossible - that&#39;s why its sooooo important for you to become the trustworthy advocate. Create an environment where she Wants to listen to you. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re cutting her food and she doesn&#39;t want you to do that, then you undermine her sense of competence and she&#39;ll look to fill that some other way - like breaking something. Breaking things gives kids a chance to feel capable, powerful over the world. Ask if she wants things cut up, and if she doesn&#39;t, trust that she can figure out how to eat without choking. It might be graceless, but she&#39;ll feel better about herself for Doing for herself. If the idea utterly panics you, brush up on how to give a heimlich to a child. <br/>
<br/>
Teaching a child to trade doesn&#39;t guarantee the child will want to engage in that kind of negotiation to get a toy (trading works well with babies, not so well with toddlers). If you are right there in the middle of the kids playing, can you see the toy-grab coming and head it off at the pass, somehow? Offer a snack? Suggest a new game or a new location? Can you be the one to do the trading? Distract the other child? Help the other child move on or wait for another turn, since she has the gentler personality? <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>
<br/>
Its useful to know that what&#39;s diagnosed as SID is often developmental, a kind of &quot;asynchronous development&quot;. Asynchronous development (some things developing out of synch with others) is something you can learn a lot about by reading about giftedness, but its not limited to &quot;gifted&quot; kids - its just most noticable in kids who are &quot;asynchronous&quot; in the sense of being very &quot;ahead&quot; (or &quot;behind&quot;) developmentally in some few areas. <br/>
<br/>
Some kids have bigger needs than other - due to development or temperament, or just the way they happen to be wired. From an unschooling perspective it can be valuable to do some research in order to better understand those needs so that we can help our kids without necessarily trying to &quot;fix&quot; them. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; has some great lists of different kinds of games and activities - good idea fodder for any parent with an energetic kid, looking for more fun to offer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He also is on a sensory diet which helps a bunch.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its good to bring up food and other &quot;environmental&quot; issues. All sorts of things can throw kids out-of-whack, and it can be helpful to look for patterns over time to get an idea if food, dyes, household products or other factors could be involved. There are rarely &quot;magic bullets&quot; though. Most of the time diet (etc) are big triggers, but not the underlying &quot;cause&quot;. A feisty 2yo (for example) isn&#39;t likely to turn into a mellow child simply by changing the laundry detergent ;)<br/>
<br/>
Brandee, I didn&#39;t think you were saying that, I&#39;m just trying to elaborate on what you *did* say, for the sake of additional clarity/information.<br/>

We added a lot more calming, quiet activities, because she was getting out of bed and running around in the dark house and climbing in to the crate with the dog.  We also started locking our bedroom door as she gets up and wanders and we don&#39;t always wake up with her. (She has lots of quiet things to do if she wants to go to sleep after us).<br/>
<br/>
I bet all the night wandering was her way of expending all her energy before she is able to lay down at night, and now it&#39;s getting channeled into jumping all over mom and dad.<br/>
<br/>
Whew.  That&#39;s easy to fix, and here I was thinking there was no hope.</div>
