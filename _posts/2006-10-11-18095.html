~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
&quot;Thanks for your responses.  I thought it was interesting the three<br/>
different perspectives I received on the situation and plan to think<br/>
about each one carefully.<br/>
<br/>
One note,  I should mention that this roughhousing usually starts late<br/>
at night when we are getting into the family bed (which my dh actually<br/>
isn&#39;t in as he is on call 24 hours a day and it kept waking everybody<br/>
up in the middle of the night.  On weekends, we do all family bed,<br/>
though).  Our 3 yo. dd seems to wind up all over again, even if we<br/>
have had a very long busy day with lots of physical activity.  We<br/>
haven&#39;t been able to pinpoint why she&#39;s winding up as it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to matter what the day has been like or what she has eaten.  She just<br/>
gets a boost of energy at 11 pm at night.  Unfortunately, my older dd<br/>
and I are usually exhausted and can&#39;t wait to go to sleep.  So, taking<br/>
the kids to another place, such as a park, etc. usually isn&#39;t an<br/>
option (though, when this does happen in the daytime, that&#39;s a great<br/>
option-:).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the responses.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Is it possible to start winding down before 11PM?  I read somewhere <br/>
that 11PM is the time when we usually catch our second wind even if we <br/>
were really tired.  I am a night owl by nature, so I am VERY familiar <br/>
with this feeling personally.  I can be exhausted, and if I don&#39;t fall <br/>
asleep before 11PM I will surely be up until 1AM or so.  It&#39;s just <br/>
like there&#39;s a switch that goes on, and I&#39;m up and wide awake.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about or maybe look into...<br/>
