<div id="ygrps-yiv-924585738">My daughter was asking about where people come from. So I shared with her <br/>
some general society opinions and suggested she do some research.<br/>
<br/>
She came back to me and told me Darwin was a sexist and a racist. Then she <br/>
shared that creation made as much sense to her as evolution because of the <br/>
babyhood of science. This is my science obsessive child!<br/>
<br/>
So my question is this, how much should I share with her about my own <br/>
opinion knowing that she is highly influenced by it?<br/>
<br/>
After 20 plus years in unschooling, I feel like I just started some days! Of <br/>
course, other days I can be a know it all. :(<br/>

Much Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631327981">Where did she do her research? If it was only <br/>
on-line it might be possible bring some more <br/>
reliable resources in to your home.  The Howard <br/>
Hughes Medical Institute has great free resources <br/>
on evolutionary biology and biomedical research. <br/>
They even ship for free all around the world. <br/>
There is a magazine that you can subscribe to and <br/>
get back issues from, DVDs and a virtual lab CD <br/>
ROM.  It is an amazing philanthropic organization <br/>
and the materials are pretty accessible.<br/>
This is the link:<br/>

As for how to make this information available <br/>
without making it &quot;teachy&quot; the experts here can <br/>
give you better advice. Maybe strewing with science articles?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182108241">But you could give her your personal opinion and then explain why others find the other viable. Discuss BOTH not either or. I think it is important that kids DO know our personal beliefs but also know they are allowed to follow their own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Discuss why you think the opposite is not for you and why you choose what you do and why others choose what they do. That way it is a discussion<br/>
<br/>
I  believe in reincarnation and creator-used evolution to create us and our souls come from the divine but it ok that bodies evolved. Me and my teenage son have lots of discussions about everything involved in this scenario- he will come and say &quot;ok how about this.....&quot; The funny thing is is said ok no reincarnation and no Christianity but good and evil battle which brought him back to Christianity just with his twist on it. <br/>
