<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327363569">&quot;Pisses me off, I&#39;m sorry but it does.  No way would I<br/>
allow some self-righteous state official to tell me that my children<br/>
sharing a room is wrong no more than I&#39;d let some religious zealot,<br/>
convince me that it is evil or sinful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to hear the strength of your &quot;voice&quot; Sandy!! You sound so<br/>
much stronger and convinced of things these days.:) Unschooling has<br/>
such power to heal doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I got my dh over that hurdle of acceptance the same way you did, by<br/>
standing up strongly for unschooling and asking him if he thought I&#39;d<br/>
do ANYTHING to hurt our children. He admitted I wouldn&#39;t and decided<br/>
to trust me. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool to see how unschooling helps us shed unwanted layers of<br/>
garbage that were piled on by well-intentioned, but very mislead adults.<br/>

You&#39;ll love this.  After I tell my hubby this and he says that he<br/>
gives me his &#39;complete trust&#39;, he calls yesterday afternoon and Zak<br/>
answers the phone, I HEAR Donnie ask, &quot;So did you learn today.&quot; <br/>
*Smack my forehead*  he STILL doesn&#39;t &#39;get it&#39;.  I wrote him a LONG<br/>
email EXPLAINING, yet again the learning process, trusting, etc. to<br/>
which he replies, &quot;I get it?  What more can I do to help me show that<br/>
I trust you?&quot;  He is so fortunate that I am a PATIENT woman...I wrote<br/>
back, &quot;Quit asking what Zak is learning and just trust that he is<br/>
getting what he needs for the day?  When we keep asking him what he&#39;s<br/>
learning, it makes him feel as if he needs to live up to OUR<br/>
standards.&quot;  He wrote back and says that now he really<br/>
understands....Damn, I sure hope so!  And &#39;they&#39; say children don&#39;t<br/>
get things and need to be taught.  LOL<br/>
