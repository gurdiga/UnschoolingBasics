<div id="ygrps-yiv-669546767">&quot;How have others managed to get thru the days and meet the needs of each<br/>
family member, including yourself, especially with very little ones<br/>
around?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You mean there are people that can do this? WOW!! I certainly am not<br/>
one of them.:)<br/>
I doubt I ever know if I fully meet the needs of everyone including<br/>
myself, I just do the best I can and don&#39;t worry if things aren&#39;t just<br/>
right.<br/>
Heck, I can&#39;t meet everyone&#39;s needs including my own...I can only try<br/>
to help them meet their own.  Sure, I am responsible for<br/>
transportation and organizing and such, but if I told you I fully met<br/>
four children&#39;s, a spouse and my own needs everyday, I&#39;d be lying to you.<br/>
My needs are often about spending time traveling, being alone, working<br/>
on art projects etc.... but young children&#39;s needs take priority right<br/>
now.<br/>
My older boys needs have to do with constantly being with friends,<br/>
planning parties etc...not something I can meet everyday...again, I do<br/>
my best.<br/>
My dh&#39;s needs are more towards spending more time with me alone (HA!),<br/>
traveling and having a clean house.<br/>
As I speak, he is walking around grumping about the mess and cleaning<br/>
up. sigh....<br/>
No, I don&#39;t meet all of our needs on a daily basis, I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
what that&#39;s like.<br/>
We DO enjoy each others company, learn new things and have the life we<br/>
chose each and every day. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s damn good.<br/>
