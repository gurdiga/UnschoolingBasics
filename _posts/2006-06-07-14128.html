<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971201076">I am a newbie here but I have been homeschooling for 5 years.  I <br/>
have thought about unschooling alot but my husband is against it.  <br/>
He gets upset when my now 12-YO son makes a ton of misspellings <br/>
whenever he writes.  I haven&#39;t pushed spelling much with my children <br/>
and I try to unschool as much as possible.  However, I do make them <br/>
do Horizons math, EZ Grammar, and Wordly Wise for vocabulary.  But <br/>
that is about it.  Sometimes when I think of it, I tell them to do a <br/>
Rosetta Stone spanish lesson.  My 12 YO has a spelling workbook, but <br/>
I like him to do it later in the afternoon and he is only about 1/3 <br/>
of the way through it.  My husband thinks I need to be more <br/>
scheduled about the spelling.<br/>
<br/>
How do kids learn to spell if they aren&#39;t learning spelling words or <br/>
using a curriculum?  I imagine you are all going to tell me by <br/>
reading and writing.  My son has always been an avid reader, but his <br/>
spelling is still really bad and he hardly ever writes.  He has <br/>
Asperger&#39;s and he enjoys writing lists.  He makes lists of anything <br/>
he is interested in...right now it is baseball teams and players.  <br/>
Spelling is a big deal to my husband because he writes for a local <br/>
column everyday and he used to be a sports reporter on the local <br/>
news.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys hate doing the workbooks, even though they are minimal and <br/>
should take an hour.  But I struggle with stopping math and grammar.<br/>

spellers and some are not, and it doesn&#39;t matter whether they&#39;ve <br/>
unschooled all their lives or went through a full plate of primary, <br/>
secondary, and post-graduate education.  I am a medical <br/>
transcriptionist, and I can tell you for certain:  Doctors cannot <br/>
spell.  Doctors go through a ton of schooling, more than most folks, <br/>
I guess, and they&#39;re generally pretty smart people, but every <br/>
transcriptionist knows that doctors generally can&#39;t spell, and if <br/>
they start spelling a word for you, DON&#39;T TRUST IT! (It is pretty <br/>
entertaining, though!)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My brother had a full school career, including four years of college, <br/>
and he emerged from that experience with very lousy spelling <br/>
skills.  So, he uses a dictionary and a spell checker.  He&#39;s a very <br/>
successful entrepreneur, my brother is, and his inability to spell <br/>
has not hurt him or interfered with him at all.  I&#39;m a great speller <br/>
and I&#39;m poorer than dirt!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your husband needs to understand unschooling a little <br/>
better?  Shaming your son about spelling is not likely to help him <br/>
master it (or even want to)!!  In fact, it could have the opposite <br/>
effect, but more likely it could damage the relationship your son and <br/>
husband have, and is spelling really worth that?<br/>
<br/>
Spelling can be helpful in effective communication.  To that end, if <br/>
your son (like my brother) wants to know that he is being understood, <br/>
it will behoove him to spell words correctly.  If he understands that <br/>
importance, he will want to spell words correctly, and he&#39;ll pull <br/>
that together.  But, it may not be so important to him.  He may not <br/>
need to be a good speller right now.  If you can help your husband to <br/>
let that go, I bet everyone will be happier, including your husband!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes; I am going to say that they learn to spell from reading and writing.<br/>
We are surrounded by words.  There are words everywhere!  Words are<br/>
glorious.  One of the problems with English is that we are a &quot;hob gob&quot;<br/>
language with roots from Gaelic, German, Latin, French, Spanish, and Greek<br/>
(to name a few).  While we have some basic rules about spelling, we have no<br/>
hard and fast rules.  Look at i before e except after c or in words like<br/>
society, beige, and heifer!  I have two tools that I use often in writing.<br/>
A dictionary and spell check!  Dan, my co-parent, is a brilliant computer<br/>
programmer and network engineer.  Has one of those minds that soaks up<br/>
everything he reads or hears.  Stores stuff for years and is able to recall<br/>
them long after he has stored it.  Can&#39;t spell worth carp ;-)  As an<br/>
unschooler I would tell you to not get hung up about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the real problem is your dh&#39;s attitude towards you and your children<br/>
rather than your son&#39;s lack of spelling comprehension.  For some people<br/>
spelling just isn&#39;t the end all be all.  Ask yourself why your dh doesn&#39;t<br/>
trust you with your children&#39;s upbringing and education.  Better yet, ask<br/>
your dh why he doesn&#39;t trust you with your children&#39;s upbringing and<br/>
education.  Has he even read anything about unschooling?  Has he been to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com">http://www.sandradodd.com</a> and read the articles that many unschooling<br/>
families have shared?  How it really can work for *all* kids?<br/>
<br/>
My boys hate doing the workbooks, even though they are minimal and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; should take an hour.  But I struggle with stopping math and grammar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask yourself if you got anything from all the classes you took in school<br/>
that you hated doing.  Your boys are going to learn math and grammar as they<br/>
need math and grammar.  I&#39;m not sure if LeeAnn is on this list or not, but<br/>
I&#39;ll share this story anyway.  LeeAnn&#39;s son was 13 when he asked his mom<br/>
what this symbol (hmmm, can&#39;t find it on my keyboard - the division sign<br/>
little - with two dots.)  OMG a 13yo doesn&#39;t know what a division sign is?<br/>
LeeAnn told him it was a division sign and showed him how it effected<br/>
numbers.  Within a short time (I think it was like 30 minutes) her son was<br/>
able to do quite complicated division - maybe even &quot;grade level&quot;  (gasp!)<br/>
It was because he was ready and had an interest.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have a very dear friend who is a journalist and columnist for my<br/>
newspaper.   She admitted that she couldn&#39;t spell worth squat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534005456">How about show DH Time magazine, the New York Times, his own <br/>
newspaper, just about any large novel (and almost all the labels <br/>
under the paintings in the Cowboy Hall of Fame in OKC) ...there are <br/>
invariably at least half a dozen misspellings and/or misuses of <br/>
words (DH found one last night in a book he&#39;s reading, they used an <br/>
m in &quot;scenario&quot; instead of an n.) If all these publications produced <br/>
by professionals and ostensibly proofread at least once or twice can <br/>
still have spelling errors, he needs to cut a 12 yr old some slack.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to what to do *for* (not *to*) your kids - remove the <br/>
physical issues from the writing/spelling. That is, let them go at <br/>
it with email, word processing, IMing, online games (even a safe <br/>
place like NeoPets allows people to send messages to each other), <br/>
etc and uncouple the writing from the physical act of setting pen to <br/>
paper (after all, I doubt your hubby writes his final drafts by <br/>
hand). Most email programs as well as word processors allow you to <br/>
configure it to automatically underline or highlight in some fashion <br/>
anything it sees as misspelled. Ditto for grammatical questions.<br/>
<br/>
And, too, while it may be important to your hubby in his work, it is <br/>
NOT the be all end all of life as we know it to be able to spell <br/>
correctly in order to &quot;Be Successful&quot; (in the current cultural <br/>
understanding of that word). I work with folks, with college <br/>
degrees, who are in management making upwards of $75K per year who <br/>
can&#39;t spell for beans. I happen to be a word person (that&#39;s why I <br/>
notice typos in all sorts of things) but I know that not everyone <br/>
is. I come by it genetically (lol) - my dad has an NYU journalism <br/>
degree. My sister, however, same parents, same public schools right <br/>
through, college degree and everything, is a hesitant speller at <br/>
best - she has to stop and think about things if it&#39;s not something <br/>
she uses all the time. However, she is a marvelous artist while I <br/>
can&#39;t even really draw a straight line without help. When/if it <br/>
becomes important for your son to communicate in writing of some <br/>
form with others and he needs to spell better in order to <br/>
communicate clearly, then and only then will he work on improving <br/>
his spelling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272341423">My kids learned and are learning how to spell in all kinds of ways. Instant<br/>
messaging, email, Myspace....the older 3 have gotten to the point where they<br/>
care if things are spelled correctly. They each have their own methods for<br/>
checking. They can always ask me (which may or may not help), they love<br/>
m-w.com, and they&#39;ll type into word for automatic corrections.  On-line<br/>
games are another area. These are all things that they do as part of life<br/>
and those are the ways they learn. Some of their 4-H projects for Fair<br/>
require writing and there&#39;s another way they get experience. Artificial<br/>
writing does nothing.  I can tell you from personal experience that years of<br/>
spelling words and spelling tests did nothing for my spelling skills. I read<br/>
all the time as a kid and that didn&#39;t help either. Spelling is just not<br/>
something that comes naturally to me. I&#39;ve managed to survive quite nicely.<br/>
And I&#39;m quite proficient with spell-check! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039741414">My son has aspergers. He will pick up up, it&#39;s okay. I imagine that  <br/>
at this point he winces every time your dh looks his written word,  <br/>
because he knows that criticism will come. Is that maybe why he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to write? That&#39;s not a healthy way to live! If they hate  <br/>
doing workbooks, then why do they need to do them? What will they  <br/>
learn? Are they actually learning what&#39;s in there, or is the bigger  <br/>
lesson that mom can force them to do such and so? Or that dad&#39;s  <br/>
approval is based on what they produce, rather than on the innately  <br/>
good things about them? What&#39;s wrong with only writing lists? Does  <br/>
your son have a career already planned on writing? Perhaps he won&#39;t  <br/>
ever need to write more than lists!! That&#39;s what billionaire  <br/>
presidents and CEO&#39;s of companies do, write lists so that others can  <br/>
make some sense out of it! I will say that my son hates writing.  <br/>
Primarily because his disability makes the coordination necessary  <br/>
very difficult, secondly the brain isn&#39;t wired for the kind of fluent  <br/>
communication required in writing essays.<br/>
<br/>
As your dh is a writer, I&#39;m surprised he never uses spellcheck. Mine  <br/>
does ;-) Spelling isnt&#39; learn by writing words over and over. Some of  <br/>
it can be learned by learning the rules. But over the long run, it&#39;s  <br/>
all about reading. He&#39;s only 12...his job or livelihood does not  <br/>
depend on his spelling, so give him time!!! I&#39;m 32, and I&#39;ve never  <br/>
practiced spelling. What I do know that as I&#39;m typing, words look  <br/>
wrong. That comes from reading (and having Josh kick my butt at  <br/>
scrabble). Then I utilize tools to help me figure out how to do it  <br/>
right. Computer spellcheck, dictionary, webster.com. I would say that  <br/>
is more important, teaching him the tools that he has available, and  <br/>
then letting him know that it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Then let him  <br/>
practice. I like how someone said that once spelling became important  <br/>
to their teenager, then they figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you take this the right way. No one is criticizing, just  <br/>
offering opinions and suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
My now 15 yo was never much good at spelling until she hit around 12 and started emailing friends.  She became self-conscious and wanted to improve.  I showed her spell check to point out words she was mis-spelling and over time, the correct way to spell those words started to stick.  She just finished a writing class with kids who have done curriculum all their lives.  She handled it just fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just sent this post to my state group (apologies to those who are  <br/>
on both). I think it might be useful for those people who have kids  <br/>
who are reading later than they might feel comfortable with - but, if  <br/>
you read down farther, there is also a part about my 15 yo daughter  <br/>
and her spelling journey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have three daughters - the first read at four and a half years old<br/>
and LOVED to read, play word games, started writing her own stories<br/>
at five, etc. She still writes and even runs writing workshops and<br/>
poetry marathons at camps and where she works, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The second learned to read all on her own at three years old - spent<br/>
a few weeks driving her older sister crazy by constantly asking her,<br/>
&#39;What&#39;s this word? What&#39;s this word?&quot; and then she had it figured<br/>
out. &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t even know she could read - I wasn&#39;t expecting it,<br/>
wasn&#39;t looking for it, and it apparently happened so fast that I<br/>
missed it. My neighbor is the one who told me - she brought Roxana<br/>
back from playing at her house and said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe she reads<br/>
like that.&quot; I said, &quot;Hmmm, like what?&quot; She said, &quot;Well, she was<br/>
reading to the other kids.&quot; I had NO idea. So later I gave her some<br/>
books, ones we&#39;d never read together, and she read them. She&#39;s still<br/>
very very into words - at 18 she loves literature, linguistics,<br/>
etymology, theater, and anything else that has to do with words and<br/>
writing and will probably major in literature, in college. It is her<br/>
passion.<br/>
<br/>
My third child didn&#39;t learn to read until she was well into being<br/>
eight years old. She has a very very different learning style than<br/>
the other two and her focus was on other things. She&#39;s very physical<br/>
- loves sports (has been on a swim team, played soccer since she was<br/>
four, rides horses, and now is very into karate - and she&#39;s always<br/>
loved puzzles and games - especially strategy games and playing cards<br/>
(including figuring odds) and role-playing games. As the years went<br/>
by, she loved to listen to books and, as she got older, she got a<br/>
little frustrated that she couldn&#39;t read. I reminded her that<br/>
everybody is different and that she was learning all kinds of other<br/>
things and that reading would come, not to worry. I gave her some<br/>
help - we played a lot of word games, especially while driving in the<br/>
car, but, to be honest, she really wasn&#39;t &quot;getting&quot; the idea of<br/>
phonics and too much trying to play games based on phonics just got<br/>
her extremely frustrated and we&#39;d back off immediately. Slowly,<br/>
however, she built up a set of memorized words that she could easily<br/>
recognize. And she started trying to read words by guessing based on<br/>
the first letter and, a bit later, based on first and last letters.<br/>
We joined a theater group and she played the little Indian boy in &quot;A<br/>
Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream.&quot; She carried the script with her all<br/>
throughout the early rehearsals, just like everyone else, but &quot;I&quot;<br/>
knew she couldn&#39;t really read it. Night after night, she &quot;pretended&quot;<br/>
to be following the script. Then, one day, I walked in the front door<br/>
of our house and there she was, upside down, head on the floor, legs<br/>
up over the back of the couch &lt;G&gt;, reading out loud from the<br/>
Midsummer script, with GREAT expression, and reading ALL the parts,<br/>
not just her own. I thought - &quot;WOW - she&#39;s got quite a memory!!&quot; But<br/>
I had been fooled again - she was really reading (with a lot of help<br/>
from her memory of the show, of course). Somehow those weeks of<br/>
&quot;pretending&quot; to follow along in the script had allowed her to break<br/>
the code - she &quot;got&quot; the idea and she could suddenly read. That<br/>
ability transferred over to all reading material. That was it - she<br/>
read everything she could get her hands on. There were LOTS of words<br/>
she couldn&#39;t read, at first, because she didn&#39;t recognize them and<br/>
still wasn&#39;t &quot;sounding out&quot; well. But her reading improved super fast<br/>
and within a few months she was reading as well as my other kids had<br/>
been at eight years old - which was VERY advanced for their age -<br/>
high school, college level - as well as most adults.<br/>
<br/>
But, there is more - she STILL couldn&#39;t write anything that others<br/>
could understand because her spelling was SO poor. She couldn&#39;t<br/>
consistently spell common three-letter words correctly. She usually<br/>
got the right letters in the word, but added letters and mixed up the<br/>
order in odd ways. She spelled the word, &quot;dear,&quot; as &quot;derar,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;drenar,&quot; for example. Very far off - unreadable. And she had a habit<br/>
of sticking the letter &quot;n&quot; into words, seemingly randomly. Her<br/>
spelling problems continued for years - she was 13 years old and<br/>
still having trouble writing well enough for others to understand.<br/>
She wanted to do better, but I knew from my research that regular<br/>
spelling lessons were not likely to be helpful. I read a book called,<br/>
&quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell: Understanding and Assisting Your Child&#39;s<br/>
Literacy Development,&quot; by Richard Gentry. In that book, he talked<br/>
about a spelling disorder as a very distinct and separate thing from<br/>
other learning disorders, and he gave a lot of ways to cope with it<br/>
and to help a child or adult who really just can&#39;t spell. So, rather<br/>
than focus on her inability to spell and rather than banging our<br/>
heads against the wall with spelling lessons, etc.,  I helped my<br/>
daughter learn some of those coping skills. She liked that because it<br/>
helped her function better, immediately. Then she got AIM and started<br/>
talking, online, to friends. Her spelling was still so bad people<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand her, but one of her &quot;coping skills,&quot; was to just<br/>
try again with a different possible spelling. Turned out that if she<br/>
wrote a word a whole bunch of different possible ways, she could<br/>
usually recognize the correct spelling when she saw it, even though<br/>
she couldn&#39;t just write it down correctly, the first time. So, if<br/>
someone didn&#39;t understand her, she&#39;d just try again with a bit<br/>
different spelling. AND, she started to write stories - fan fiction -<br/>
online, too. For those she used spell checkers (which, as we all<br/>
know, only help so much), but, again, it was interesting that she<br/>
could nearly always pick the correct spelling out of the suggestions<br/>
made by the spell checker. Very slowly, her spelling was clearly<br/>
improving. She signed up for NANOWRIMO (National Novel Writing Month)<br/>
and wrote a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. Spelling wasn&#39;t great but<br/>
not NEARLY as bad as I&#39;d thought it would be. She continued to write<br/>
and chat with friends, online, and to read a lot. She did NANOWRIMO<br/>
again the next year. And after it was done, she went back and edited<br/>
it and painstakingly checked spelling until every word was correct<br/>
and Lulu press, a self-publishing company, published one copy of each<br/>
book completed by NANOWRIMO writers. So she got a lovely bound<br/>
published copy of her book. That was last November. She&#39;s 15. In the<br/>
months since then, she&#39;s become an outstanding speller - she spells<br/>
easily, now. She still asks, once in a while, to make sure she&#39;s<br/>
right, but she nearly always IS right. Last night she wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>
it should be &quot;resistance&quot; or &quot;resistence&quot; - but as soon as she asked<br/>
out loud she said, &quot;Oh, never mind, I know now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad that I didn&#39;t push her or insist on reading or spelling<br/>
lessons. I truly do not believe it would have helped her, I think it<br/>
would have created a power struggle between us and the main lessons<br/>
she would have learned would have been, &quot;Learning is hard,&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
not smart.&quot; Instead, I repeatedly pointed out the ways she WAS smart,<br/>
supported her in doing the things she was good at, the things she<br/>
loved, and put a high value on those things. I reassured her over and<br/>
over again, that reading would happen for her and I pointed out to<br/>
her how different people were different in so many ways. It helped<br/>
TREMENDOUSLY to have other families around who were also relaxed and<br/>
comfortable about later reading and who had kids who were later<br/>
readers. My daughter did read at 8, with isn&#39;t all that &quot;late&quot; - but<br/>
it was when she was showing no signs of learning to read at 5, 6, and<br/>
7, that things might have gone very differently, if I hadn&#39;t made the<br/>
decision to accept later reading as natural and normal &quot;for her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other kids I know well were still not reading at 8, 9, 10, 11, and<br/>
even 12 or 13. They now read, read very very well, love books, love<br/>
learning. As older teens, they are well-educated, well-informed, and<br/>
well-read kids. If you want to hear more about later readers and how<br/>
wonderful it can be to support them in developing in their own way,<br/>
come to the Live and Learn conference and don&#39;t miss Dan Vilter&#39;s  <br/>
talk - his son is turning 17 next week, didn&#39;t read until<br/>
very much later than the norm - and Dan has a LOT of insight to share<br/>
with those who are concerned about their later-reading children.<br/>

<br/>
My dd is 13, we&#39;ve only be at this for about a year.  She has always <br/>
had trouble with spelling (even though she has a wonderful <br/>
vocabulary, I love to hear some of the words she uses sometimes!).   <br/>
She&#39;s been mostly play on-line games which involves typing in <br/>
messages to other players.   She says the other players have been <br/>
bugging her from time to time about her inventive or shortcut <br/>
spelling (some of that is just quicker in a fast paced game, &quot;u&quot; for <br/>
you etc).   She didn&#39;t seem to care much at first but just lately <br/>
she said she&#39;s been spelling more words correctly, not switching <br/>
letters (heck, *I* do that when I&#39;m typing fast!) etc.   We IM each <br/>
other sometimes just to chat, and I HAVE noticed her spelling is <br/>
much improved.   Real life experience, not doing spelling workbooks <br/>
or writing words over and over in order to learn them.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how words are spelled phonetically does NOT work for her.  <br/>
She&#39;s a visual spatial learner and needs to see the entire word, <br/>
make a picture of it in her mind then store it.  Quick retrieval <br/>
does not happen, which is one of the reasons she was &quot;falling <br/>
behind&quot; in school.   Speed is not important, but learning things <br/>
that are important to her ARE.<br/>

By reading.  I would also investigate &quot;invented spelling&quot; to ease some of <br/>
your worries.  If they are constantly corrected, it is going to make them feel <br/>
like they are a bad speller.  Then the angst, shame and fear of the subject will <br/>
only make them believe this and perpetuate the cycle.  Good luck!<br/>
