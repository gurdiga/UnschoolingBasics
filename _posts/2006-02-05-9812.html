Â• DOES EATING SUGARY FOODS CAUSE A RUSH IN BLOOD SUGAR FOLLOWED BY A LOW ?<br/>
<br/>
Many people think that eating sugary foods causes a dramatic rise in<br/>
blood sugar followed by a crash, which causes tiredness and food cravings.<br/>
This is not true. In fact, in healthy people, blood sugar levels are<br/>
kept within a narrow range, and tiredness and food cravings are very<br/>
rarely due to low blood sugar.<br/>
People are often surprised to learn that eating table sugar (sucrose)<br/>
actually causes a smaller increase in blood sugar than eating starchy<br/>
foods such as baked potatoes and white or wholemeal bread.<br/>

This is true. We are a low carb household, my DH is diabetic and it runs on<br/>
both side of our families. My son does eat sweets but in moderation which is<br/>
the key. When there is a carb high - too much sugar or starchy foods (even<br/>
in a healthy person) it causes an insulin reaction which releases insulin<br/>
into the body and turns the extra sugar into fat to protect the body from<br/>
sugar crystals which can harm blood vessels.<br/>

I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189913549">While I agree that sugar has been unfairly demonized and singled out for the cause of various evils.  Drinking too much water can mess you up real bad, going without sleep for extended periods can cause psychosis; however, there are many nutritionists that would disagree that sugar causes only small changes in blood sugar.  It does if eaten with other more &quot;stabilizing&quot; foods, but many people who eat large amounts of carbohydrates (which turn to sugar in the blood stream)without combining them with proteins or fats will have blood sugar drops throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
I think sugar is a necessary food (not as necessary as my children do, but hey..).  It tastes good.  Without it in our blood, we wouldn&#39;t function.  However, it does work best in our bodies when combined with other foods.  I think we do well to help our kids understand how that works.<br/>
<br/>
We have a swimming pool with a deep end in our backyard.  We think it is necessary &lt;grin&gt; living here in Texas.  Everyone has fun and enjoys it as much as possible but the kids learned about how to enjoy it without causing damage to themselves.  They learned how water works.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, exactly.  That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s much better to focus on what we<br/>
NEED to eat to feel balanced, rather than what to avoid. Slight<br/>
difference, but we can help our children listen to their bodies<br/>
without demonizing sugar, which humans naturally love (Hmmmmm,<br/>
breastmilk?).<br/>
