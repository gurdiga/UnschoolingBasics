<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927484254">~OR.as it seems.a list for people who wish to be SCHOOLED in how to<br/>
comply with the ideas and practices of an elite few~<br/>
<br/>
This is so unecessary. How is it helping anyone unschool?<br/>
<br/>
First of all, to SCHOOL someone they&#39;d be required to be here. We&#39;d<br/>
make you read certain things, answer specific questions and give you<br/>
grades for not answering correctly. You&#39;d have no choice in the matter<br/>
and your grade would be at our whim. Comparing an email list that has<br/>
a very specific purpose to SCHOOLING you is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than whine about how a list is run, start one. <br/>
I get really tired of people telling me HOW to volunteer my time.<br/>
