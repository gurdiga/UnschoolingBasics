<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921772072">I&#39;ll bite, since I&#39;m going to turn this off in a minute and go to  <br/>
bed. I&#39;ll look for the flames tomorrow (if the computer is smoking, I  <br/>
won&#39;t even touch the power button)<br/>
<br/>
I used to force my kids to apologize, and felt like a hypocrite every  <br/>
time. How many times did i screw up and say sorry only to shut the  <br/>
other person up (or even worse &quot;Sorry, but...&quot;)? But then resent it  <br/>
the whole time? And stew?  And it wasn&#39;t (as someone mentioned  <br/>
earlier) about honestly feeling regret, it was all a power play  <br/>
(you&#39;ll say sorry because I said so, and I&#39;m saying so because I&#39;m  <br/>
embarrassed at your actions and because those other people expect it)  <br/>
You&#39;re teaching that it&#39;s okay to do whatever you want, as long as  <br/>
you say sorry! There&#39;s no chance to develop actual remorse, because  <br/>
suddenly the focus is on the whole &#39;apology power&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And my especial pet peeve, my friend, when someone apologizes to her  <br/>
children, makes them say &quot;It&#39;s okay&quot;, when it obviously is not okay  <br/>
to them, and they need some more time to grieve. :-( Talk about an  <br/>
immediate dismissal of emotions, devaluing someone&#39;s opinion, and  <br/>
removing power from them!  Breanna hits the girl sometimes out of  <br/>
anger, and sometimes just for a reaction, and when her mom says that,  <br/>
i say &quot;NO! It is NOT okay to be hit, and it hurts. I&#39;m sorry  <br/>
Elizabeth, that she did that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do still ask my kids if they would like to apologize, esp the  <br/>
little ones. Mostly because I think they are not sure about what  <br/>
steps they can take to help someone feel better after a run-in. I  <br/>
usually ask the older ones if they have any ideas on how they could  <br/>
help someone...whether they were the &quot;perpetrator&quot; (for lack of a  <br/>
better word) or not. I try to model a lot of compassion for the kids,  <br/>
by hugging someone who has gotten hurt or had some toy taken, or some  <br/>
other sadness, and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry that happened to you, what can I do  <br/>
to help you feel better?&quot; Sometimes just the validation is enough for  <br/>
the kids &quot;I&#39;ll bet that was not good for you&quot;, can open the way for  <br/>
the perp, and sometimes it just helps the victim (so to speak) I  <br/>
usually ask them &quot;Is it okay?&quot; or &quot;what can Joe do to make it up to  <br/>
you?&quot; to facilitate some discussion, since the boys are so young, and  <br/>
even Rachel and Emily are still building their tools. Josh is just  <br/>
getting to the age where he has his tool chest filled and he can access.<br/>
<br/>
They have the power to say no, which Dan does about 20% of the time.  <br/>
the rest of the time, he&#39;ll say (or sign) that he&#39;s sorry, and offer  <br/>
help. Most of the time the other kids do it on their own, although  <br/>
they have been known to say &quot;I&#39;m *NOT* sorry, you were being mean to  <br/>
me and wouldn&#39;t stop&quot; And they also are free to say &quot;It&#39;s not okay,  <br/>
what you did hurt me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ack. It&#39;s late and I think I just had a brain leak. I hope this makes  <br/>
sense....Good questions Kelly<br/>

*******<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I was never a forced apologizer (although caught myself doing it from  <br/>
time to time under pressure from the other mommies, bleck), but I learned a <br/>
tool  from THIS VERY GROUP a great thing that I have used a few times (Pam,  <br/>
maybe???Joyce????).<br/>
 <br/>
I have pulled my kids aside after an incident and whispered &quot;when things  <br/>
like this happen, people like to hear when you are sorry&quot;.  Sometimes  the child <br/>
will be able to easily to say it.  Sometimes the child has no  intention <br/>
whatsoever of saying it and I let it go.  I might go say to the  injured party that <br/>
I&#39;m sorry they got hurt.  And sometimes my child will  say &quot;I want you to say <br/>
it with me&quot;.  So either I&#39;ll say the apology or give  my child the words to <br/>
use.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and it doesn&#39;t always happen right away.  Sometimes there is a lag  time <br/>
between when I suggest it and when they feel OK about saying it.<br/>
 <br/>
Once I overheard a squabble between my kids and the five year old said, &quot;I  <br/>
think an apology would make me feel better&quot; and the older one said &quot;oh, I&#39;m  <br/>
sorry....let me see if I can fix your toy I broke.&quot;  Sweet.  How  much nicer the <br/>
world would be if adults could talk like this to each  other!<br/>

  Sweet. How much nicer the world would be if adults could talk like <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 Yeah---maybe fewer lawsuits!<br/>
<br/>
  Our organic lawn care guy sprinkled iron on our lawn. His young helper <br/>
accidentally blew some of the pellets into our *just resurfaced* pool. <br/>
I mean, like--it was resurfaced the week before! The iron left small <br/>
rust stains. Permanent stains.<br/>
<br/>
  I was perfectly within my legal rights to sue him for the $3500 it <br/>
would take to resurface the pool. Again. But it wasn&#39;t malicious. It <br/>
was an accident. I *know* Carroll felt horrible, and I know the young <br/>
man who did it will *not* do it again. So others pools in the area are <br/>
safe! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We agreed that he would cover a low-cost attempt to fix it without <br/>
draining and resurfacing. It didn&#39;t work---the spots faded for a few <br/>
days, but came back just as rusty. Carroll was willing to pay the whole <br/>
$3500, but that was silly. I can live with the rust spots.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve made a good friend in Carroll too. He goes out of his way to make <br/>
sure the lawn is healthy. (Not that he doesn&#39;t do that with everyone, <br/>
but we feel he makes a special effort with us now.) The goodwill we <br/>
share with our lawn care guy and the pool guy (he was shocked we didn&#39;t <br/>
sue), is good enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
  The same with our kids. By not viewing them or their acts as <br/>
malicious, we gain their trust and respect---AND they do the same with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
  I think children&#39;s being treated as &quot;malicious perpetrators&quot; has <br/>
contributed to our litigious society and to the seemingly ridiculous <br/>
need to be blameless---or to blame someone else. No one wants to get in <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
  Accidents *happen*. They do. Often they hurt. Bad. But because we get <br/>
into so much trouble for accidents, we refuse to accept blame and be <br/>
genuinely apologetic. Easier to blame someone else.<br/>

feel they did anything wrong to warrant an apology or feel as if <br/>
they were the victim and need to be apologized to.  These are their <br/>

I have a situation with a neighborhood family and forced apologies that has been bothering me for some time....I guess this is a good time to throw it out there and see how others might respond to it.  <br/>
  We have a very nice homeschooling family that lives down the street...we do many things with this family...see them for play dates at least four times a week (soemtimes more!!), kids are similar ages,  my oldest daughter is best friends with their oldest daughter, etc....normally everything works out well BUT....their 3 yo boy can be quite physical, especially with my 2.6 yo dd.  I&#39;m usually really on top of it, but there are those times that he gets in a good shove.  His Mom is on top of it, too, but after she sees something happen, she forces him to apologize to my dd.  He says, &quot;sorry, won&#39;t do it again&quot;, but it gets all sluured as it can when he says it so often, and actually sounds like,&quot;sorry, do it again&#39;...Then the Mom tells the little boy to give my dd a hug.  It&#39;s creepy b/c I know that he was just shoving her! I never force my kids to apologize, usually talk about what happened with the kids, problem solve for next time, and ask if they want to apologize.    <br/>
  Anyway, I need some help in dealing with the Mom&#39;s way of handling these situations.<br/>
  TIA!<br/>

we&#39;re handling our little ones, when they get a little rough with  <br/>
each other. I was thinking I&#39;d like to try something new - see if it  <br/>
helps. How about instead of getting them to apologize and hug, let&#39;s  <br/>
try this instead.....&quot;<br/>

In other words, come up with an alternative and include yourself in it.<br/>

BUT....their 3 yo boy can be quite physical, especially with my 2.6 yo  dd. <br/>
I&#39;m usually really on top of it, but there are those times that he gets in  a <br/>
good shove. His Mom is on top of it, too<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if you could talk to the mom and say that maybe you could handle  it <br/>
exclusively (unless she can prevent a shove).  I know I have found that  if <br/>
the other mom lets me do it, me talking to the child makes more of a  <br/>
difference than his own mom.<br/>
 <br/>
An example, I was visiting someone whose son was constantly picking and  <br/>
hurting on my toddler.  His mom was doing her best, but getting  nowhere.  I <br/>
finally looked him in the eye and said &quot;don&#39;t hurt my baby&quot;  very kindly but firmly <br/>
and he stopped.  I kept an eye on him afterwards,  letting him know I meant <br/>
business....this was *my* baby and he was not going to  hurt him!<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the mom will understand that you are not disciplining her son for  her, <br/>
but protecting your own child from getting hurt, and that perhaps that will  <br/>
come across more clearly to her son if *you* do it.<br/>
 <br/>
Then, you can keep it simple.  Stay on him constantly until he  understands <br/>
better.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I had the child that was aggressive and physical, not mean, but  <br/>
could definitely hurt someone.  I always appreciated other moms that  <br/>
understood this about my child.  They never shamed him, but sometimes they  got <br/>
through to him better than I could.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634813904">That sounds like a plan...I guess I have been hesitant to step on her toes, but by including myself, it may take the pressure off.  (She calls me the &quot;Master&quot;...(as in master parent, which is a little daunting, but I think she knows herself that there&#39;s a better way....)<br/>
  Thank you for the advice.<br/>
  Peace, <br/>

&gt; Then the Mom tells the little boy to give my dd a hug. It&#39;s creepy <br/>
&gt; b/c I know that he was just shoving her! I never force my kids to <br/>
&gt; apologize, usually talk about what happened with the kids, problem <br/>
&gt; solve for next time, and ask if they want to apologize.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I need some help in dealing with the Mom&#39;s way of <br/>
&gt; handling these situations.<br/>
&gt; TIA!<br/>
<br/>
Can you talk to her directly? Say, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about how <br/>
we&#39;re handling our little ones, when they get a little rough with <br/>
each other. I was thinking I&#39;d like to try something new - see if it <br/>
helps. How about instead of getting them to apologize and hug, let&#39;s <br/>
try this instead.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, come up with an alternative and include yourself in it.<br/>
