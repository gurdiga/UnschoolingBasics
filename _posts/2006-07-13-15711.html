<div id="ygrps-yiv-117271581">&quot;And, are there RU people out there who have raised children without<br/>
buying them everything for consumption they desire who have older<br/>
kids?  Are they totally eating the opposite?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve never bought EVERYTHING for consumption that they desire.<br/>
We don&#39;t happen to have a budget for that. But they DO have great<br/>
influence over the grocery trips and they do have choice. I always<br/>
look at the money and either give them an amount to buy what they wish<br/>
(just roughly, I don&#39;t hand them the money I just know about what each<br/>
kid can spend without gouging into the meals) or ask them what they<br/>
want in each section.<br/>
<br/>
They tell me what meals and snacks they want, I make sure we get the<br/>
ingredients. When they want something like cinnamon rolls, I might say<br/>
&quot;hey, let&#39;s make those ourselves, we&#39;ll get more and it costs less&quot;.<br/>
If they want an expensive chip, I might say &quot;let&#39;s get these instead,<br/>
they cost $1 less per bag&quot;.<br/>
Or I might look at the ingredients and say &quot;gosh, these have<br/>
_______,________ and ________, why don&#39;t we get this other brand that<br/>
has better ingredients&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not living in a void where the adults aren&#39;t sharing<br/>
information with them. I think hydrogenated oil is nasty. I think all<br/>
the processing we do to food can be awful. I think whole, pure foods<br/>
ARE better.<br/>
BUT, I also think that we can eat candy bars, sugary cereal and other<br/>
less healthy choices without shame, guilt or worry about health!! <br/>
And we do. If my child wants some Doritos, I&#39;m not going to make them<br/>
feel badly for that choice. If I have a better alternative up my<br/>
sleeve, I&#39;ll point it out, but sometimes they just really want Doritos!<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s how our diet started out and evolved. I went vegetarian when<br/>
pregnant with Jared in 1992. I was really INTO eathing healthy, to the<br/>
point that I&#39;d tell Trevor not to eat things at other people&#39;s<br/>
parties. Way too controlling.<br/>
I relaxed as the years went by, but I still did NOT buy items with dye<br/>
or hydrogenated oils blah, blah, blah. They were raised vegetarian.<br/>
When Sierra was little and Jalen was born I totally relaxed. I decided<br/>
certain things weren&#39;t stressing about, but still tried to buy the<br/>
healthier alternative, including soy milk.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?<br/>
All of my children like eating meat, none of them like soy milk (and<br/>
the two older boys were raised on nothing but), all of them like<br/>
sugary cereals and cow milk! So much for certain things tasting<br/>
&quot;foreign&quot;.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is a great plan.  I shop at one place primarily (and should have <br/>
a grocery budget, but don&#39;t), so that in itself might be limiting, <br/>
but it is still a great plan.  My oldest does come with me and picks <br/>
out food.  She is also in charge of the fruits and veggies for the <br/>
week and tries to find a new one each time (I just had fresh currants <br/>
for the first time -- sour!!!  but kinda good, too :).  She has money <br/>
to spend every week, but since a few trips to the bank with DH, never <br/>
wants to spend it and is obsessed with going to the bank to put it in!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me!  We have brownies and cheesecake and all of that, <br/>
but the ingredients are vastly different than standards.  Still, I&#39;ve <br/>
fooled everyone with them and they can&#39;t believe the ingredients!  <br/>
Those ones I buy though and they are pricey...haven&#39;t figured out how <br/>
to make them.  I do make lots of treats, but they still tend to taste <br/>
healthfoodsy to everyone but our family!)<br/>

<br/>
Me too!  I&#39;m just hoping that the balance is like 90% on the whole <br/>
and pure and 10% on the not-so-whole-and-pure! I&#39;m hoping that <br/>
exposure to lots of whole and pure foods combined with gentle <br/>
information will get them to stay there.  I&#39;m just not sure how to do <br/>
that without using scary terminology or overwhelming them with info <br/>
they don&#39;t want, etc.<br/>

was raised on (though I cannot say I didn&#39;t like it then or wouldn&#39;t <br/>
like it now - I just avoid certain things based on having more <br/>
information).  But you&#39;re right...it can go both ways I guess!  <br/>
<br/>
Did they just one day say, hey I want some meat, cow milk, sugary <br/>
cereal, etc. even though they hadn&#39;t been exposed and it was foreign <br/>
to them?  Unusual kid behavior (that urge to eat foreign foods LOL!), <br/>
but I&#39;ve seen stranger things happen!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399240653">~Yah, me, too. But seriously, what would (will) you do if they want<br/>
them? Say you provided good information in a loving way with no<br/>
guilt, etc. and they still want them? Will you buy them?~<br/>
<br/>
I might.<br/>
I really believe that smoking happens for reasons that don&#39;t apply to<br/>
most unschooled children. There&#39;s also the factor of genetics and<br/>
personality.  If my children choose to smoke, there&#39;s not much I can<br/>
do about it. They will become adults, they will have free access to<br/>
the same things in the world as I do. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t smoke. Why not? I have money and freedom to choose to smoke,<br/>
but I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t believe my children will either. Some of our best<br/>
friends smoke (more than one) and so far my kids think it&#39;s awful.<br/>
They also understand WHY some people choose to, and how addictive it<br/>
can be and so difficult to stop.<br/>
<br/>
As to buying them...yep, I just might. I&#39;m going on a hypothetical<br/>
situation, since none of my children have any desire to touch a<br/>
cigarette, but I can see a situation where I&#39;d be willing to fund<br/>
their habit. Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
IF one of my children chose to smoke regardless of the overwhelming<br/>
information and conclusive evidence that it is very unhealthy, then<br/>
they&#39;d choose to smoke. End of story right?<br/>
But WHAT they smoked would matter to me.<br/>
<br/>
Cigarette manufacturer&#39;s add arsenic (to make them burn faster), tar<br/>
(to make them addictive, the nicotine doesn&#39;t come from the tobbacco<br/>
itself), fiberglass filters and other extremely toxic additives. Much<br/>
worse than anything added to food.  If that was all my child could<br/>
afford, and refused to quit, then I&#39;d buy them American Naturals which<br/>
have cotton filters and pure tobbacco. <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think smoking is as bad for human beings as the<br/>
cigarrette is. Pure tobbacco smoked might be somewhat harmful, but<br/>
it&#39;s all the crap added that make them deadly. I&#39;d rather fund a<br/>
healthier alternative than have my child smoke the mainstream version.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735747460">~We all have to do what is best for us with the information we have.  <br/>
I&#39;m working to give the kids the info, but in the meantime........?? ~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe quit &quot;working&quot; at it.:)<br/>
Food is ideally a source of joy. If food tastes good, is eaten in joy<br/>
and a source of pleasure, then most of the concerns fall by the wayside.<br/>
Focusing on it so much, in a worried way, does not help anyone be<br/>
healthy either.<br/>
<br/>
The very fact that we can all discuss &quot;healthy&quot; vs. &quot;unhealthy&quot; and<br/>
organic vs. non-organic or any other food related discussion, is a<br/>
sign of extreme WEALTH. No matter the food choices, we all HAVE<br/>
choice. Even the most poor in our country, have more choice than<br/>
thousands and millions of people in the world.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re worrying about healthy food, or how to maintain the ideal<br/>
diet, just remember, the fact that you can consider any of this is due<br/>
to the overwhelmingly wealthy country we live in. We&#39;re all pretty lucky.<br/>

Uh..no.<br/>
<br/>
Meta-discussion is when a person is discussing posts themselves, or<br/>
how others should post, or about the list itself, rather than the<br/>
philsophy or idea being discussed. Everything you wrote was about food<br/>
that I could see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would be interesting to find out how many always-radically- <br/>
unschooled kids decide to smoke cigarettes. I know one of my older  <br/>
daughter&#39;s always-unschooled friends smoked as an older teen - but  <br/>
she stopped when she hit 20 or so. They&#39;re kids - they discount the  <br/>
future a LOT. But, I&#39;d guess it is a far lower proportion of teens  <br/>
than in the general population.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be especially interested in looking at how many smokers there are  <br/>
among the always-radically-unschooled kids with parents who don&#39;t smoke.<br/>
<br/>
With full information about the harm of smoking and the habit of  <br/>
making consciously thought-out decisions along with a deep sense of  <br/>
self-respect - seems unlikely that as many unschooled kids would  <br/>
choose to smoke.<br/>
<br/>
I know for sure mine won&#39;t smoke cigarettes. I can say that with  <br/>
absolute confidence - brave of me, huh? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
But - they&#39;re already at or past the usual age of starting and they  <br/>
are very clear that they think it is a dumb thing to get started  <br/>
doing. Plus, they are singers and wouldn&#39;t do anything to jeopardize  <br/>
the quality of their voices.<br/>
<br/>
I never once told them not to smoke. Really didn&#39;t say much about it  <br/>
one way or another, to be honest. They&#39;ve just picked up the  <br/>
information themselves and come to their own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t drink alcohol either - my dh or I. I assumed my kids would  <br/>
try alcohol and marijuana, at least a time or two. Roya has tried  <br/>
both a few times - didn&#39;t like either of them at all. Again, doesn&#39;t  <br/>
get the point of doing something that makes you think less clearly  <br/>
and lose any amount of control over your own behavior. The other  <br/>
girls haven&#39;t tried them yet, probably will, but maybe not. I have  <br/>
never told them not to drink or smoke pot -- and have openly talked  <br/>
about the reasons people like it - the benefits people get. Roya (21)  <br/>
has a zillion college friends who drink and smoke pot - she tends to  <br/>
go do something else when they do, because she thinks they get boring  <br/>
or annoying when they are intoxicated or high.<br/>
