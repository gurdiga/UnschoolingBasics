    Hello, I&#39;m Rhonda and I just signed on here. I will most likely be <br/>
very<br/>
quiet in the beginning as I&#39;m still learning what unschooling is. I&#39;ve <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, we try. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It *can* sound too good to be true. But many of us have *seen* it <br/>
work---and not just in an &quot;educational&quot; way, but as it relates to our <br/>
whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think everyone *can* unschool. I know that all children could, <br/>
if their parents would jump on board---because it&#39;s a natural way to <br/>
learn. But so many of us had it so thoroughly trained out of us that <br/>
it&#39;s just too hard to break away.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any specific questions, Rhonda?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775765947">Wow, the message about requirements in Germany were<br/>
very disheartening. To have your fate decided so early<br/>
seems so limiting to me. I have felt some of this with<br/>
my son when he was in public school when he couldn&#39;t<br/>
get into the gifted program because he&#39;s not good at<br/>
grammar or spelling (his lowest scores on the testing<br/>
they did). Despite a big description of the gifted<br/>
program as being for creative kids who can think and<br/>
integrate concepts quickly, all they really did to<br/>
assess him was one test and because his low scores on<br/>
those two areas put him below the required<br/>
percentages, that was it. I did pursue it further and<br/>
found that maybe richer and more complaining parents<br/>
than I might find a way to push into the program. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s when I truly gave up on the public schools. Now<br/>
he&#39;s taking classes he chooses at an alt ed ctr where<br/>
there are no grades, the teachers are lots of fun, and<br/>
so far nobody is pushing anything on us that we don&#39;t<br/>
want to do. <br/>
<br/>
I do have a comment on why it might be good for kids<br/>
to learn more broadly than specialists later in life.<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying this works for all kids or that it&#39;s<br/>
THE way to go. Just presenting the idea that I think<br/>
exposure to more choices and areas of expertise is a<br/>
goal of mine for my son and for education in general.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are people who know exactly what they<br/>
want to do/be at a young age and I&#39;d hardly get in<br/>
their way. However some of us might get fixated in one<br/>
area because we find it easiest right now, or because<br/>
it&#39;s all we know we&#39;re good at, or because it&#39;s what<br/>
we found first. My experience is that I wish I&#39;d had<br/>
more areas of choice made available to me when<br/>
younger. <br/>
<br/>
Taking on an identity as an &quot;art&quot; type or &quot;college<br/>
bound&quot; or whatever at an early age can also be<br/>
limiting. Getting real experience that you can do more<br/>
than one thing gives you a plan B at least.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I doubt we disagree in practice. I&#39;m sure<br/>
most children get experience out of the track they<br/>
might be focused on. And I&#39;d hardly push it on a child<br/>
who didn&#39;t want it. Just saying that sometimes when<br/>
young you just don&#39;t know all of the choices out there<br/>
unless someone offers them to you.<br/>
<br/>
best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369186491">Hi! Here&#39;s our day: <br/>
I have a 13 yo dd. Today she slept late, as usual,<br/>
(she&#39;s a night owl),up last night watching some<br/>
history channel stuff she had recorded off TV on our<br/>
new media center computer. This am she worked on her<br/>
computer game she is designing (www.rpgmaker2003.com).<br/>
We went to a birthday skating party, so we fixed<br/>
snacks and lunch to take. There were moms and maybe 30<br/>
kids from age 1 1/2 to 15. Then we went to the first<br/>
public day of the library book sale, and she bought<br/>
textbooks (physics--she wants to learn it)and some<br/>
classics and some science magazines. In a little while<br/>
she wants to take a pizza crust I bought (raw dough in<br/>
a bag)and figure out how to make a fruit tart out of<br/>
it---no recipe, just some experimentation--with the<br/>
lemon curd, strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi that<br/>
are in the fridge. Tonite she will be reading the<br/>
library books, watching the news with dad, surfing the<br/>
history channel, the 2 PBS&#39;s, watching the new<br/>
Simpson&#39;s, maybe building some new builings in her big<br/>
Lego area (4&#39;x9&#39;), playing with the cats, and probably<br/>
go to bed at 10pm.<br/>
<br/>
WE LOVE UNSCHOOLING!!! It works for us. I&#39;m the<br/>
facilitator and driver and she&#39;s enjoying her<br/>
childhood and exploring what she loves and looking at<br/>
some classes at the local commumity college this<br/>
summer.<br/>

long as a child knows that it doesn&#39;t have to be his/her only choice.<br/>
Exposure for exposure&#39;s sake isn&#39;t always a good thing for every child.<br/>
Some children will live for the new experiences and enjoy going and trying<br/>
something new.  Other children will never feel the ease to settle in on one<br/>
subject.  They aren&#39;t given the time to see if that is what they really want<br/>
to do because of the expectation of another subject coming around.  Are you<br/>
exposing him to all these different things because you feel he needs the<br/>
exposure or because he wants the exposure.  If you are doing it because you<br/>
feel he needs it then how is that any different than the school system<br/>
saying, &quot;Your child needs a &#39;well-rounded&#39; education.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which day?  It varies from day to day!  I&#39;ll take yesterday since it is<br/>
freshest in my memory :)<br/>
<br/>
Keon woke at 6:45 am and said, &quot;It&#39;s just too early.&quot; (Whoever decided that<br/>
we still need time changes is WRONG!  :) )  He curled up on the couch for a<br/>
while and flipped channels before deciding that he needed some breakfast.<br/>
We made an omelette together and he had a waffle to go with it.  He got<br/>
dressed so he could go outside and water the garden and check on the<br/>
plants.  He asked me if I would get dressed and come out with him.  I told<br/>
him I needed to shower first and was told to &quot;well make it snappy.  Those<br/>
plants are thirsty!&quot;  So I went and showered.  When I came out Mary Elayne<br/>
had woken (this was around 8:30)  I asked her if she was ok and she said,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m tired, but the house is too awake for me to sleep.&quot;  (Whoever decided<br/>
that we still need time changes is WRONG! :) )  She went and grabbed<br/>
something for breakfast and curled up in front of the tv for a while to eat<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Keon and I finally headed outside where we dumped the compost, gave the pile<br/>
a stir, watered the plants and refilled the buckets for the next watering.<br/>
We watched a red skink slink around the water spigot and inspected the<br/>
garden to see which plants were really starting to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Keon reminded me that Narnia was coming on dvd today and could we go buy<br/>
it.  Then he wanted to know if we could use the Dairy Queen coupons that<br/>
were in this past sunday&#39;s paper.  Sure, why not.  We asked Emily if she<br/>
wanted to join us (it&#39;s now around 11:00) and she asked if she could take a<br/>
shower to help her wake up because she really wanted to go to  Target with<br/>
us.  (Whoever decided that we still need time changes is WRONG! :) )<br/>
<br/>
Around 12:15 or so we got in the car and took off to DQ (food first ya know)<br/>
where we sat outside and watched the construction of the new interstate<br/>
bridge (our DQ overlooks a bay and the bridge that spans it was torn apart<br/>
by Ivan).  We watched barges pass underneath heading to the power station<br/>
and huge cranes lifting concrete and metal.  We talked about why the bridge<br/>
was destroyed and how it is being rebuilt much higher.  We enjoyed the<br/>
sunshine while we munched our lunch.  We went to Target, found the DVD and<br/>
bought some fun looking outdoor toys to play with when we got home.  And we<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s now around 2:30.  The kids played outside while I checked my e-mail and<br/>
processed a show for my business and made some phone calls to various people<br/>
regarding an unschooling family that has had a family emergency.  I got a<br/>
phone call from Barnes and Noble that a book Emily had ordered had come in.<br/>
I asked her if she wanted to go get it (she said, &quot;But of course!&quot; or maybe<br/>
it was &quot;duh&quot;? :) )  So the two of us ran up and found that it was the wrong<br/>
book so we had to put a reorder in.  We get back home and I remember that it<br/>
isn&#39;t 3:30 but really 4:30 (Whoever decided that we still need time changes<br/>
is WRONG! :) ) I have to leave for a PC meeting in half an hour and dinner<br/>
isn&#39;t made yet.  Emily asks if we can have one of the pork tenderloins and<br/>
baby carrots.  She offers to make dinner for which I am eternally thankful<br/>
that I shared with my kids the joy of cooking!  I thank her and head out the<br/>
door.  What they did from 5:00 until 11:00 I have NO idea except that when I<br/>
came home dinner had been cooked and eaten and the dishes were in the<br/>
dishwasher!  Keon crashed at 7:30 (Whoever decided that we still need time<br/>
changes is WRONG! :) ) and I went to bed.  Since the girls aren&#39;t up I have<br/>
no idea when they went to bed yet.  Emily spends half her nights on the<br/>
computer chatting with friends and writing at Fanfiction.com Mary Elayne<br/>
spends her nights watching tv, usually Myth Busters, Unwrapped, or anything<br/>
she can find that talk historically about mummies, zombies, pyramids, tombs<br/>
and other dark things.  She doesn&#39;t like movies with those elements but<br/>
loves the historical aspect of them.<br/>
<br/>
All intermixed in that description are long conversations about a plethora<br/>
of subjects ranging from caterpillers to sonic booms.  I spend countless<br/>
hours each week googling a million subjects that I know nothing about to<br/>
answer insatiable questions!<br/>
<br/>

  No, never. WE love the time change around here.  I spend all of March just waiting for that first weekend in April when it will be daylight until 7:30.  And not daylight until 7 am or so.  If we didn&#39;t do it around here, it would be daylight at 5 am by June.  As person who wakes at dawn -- just my body clock -- in a family of night owls, I&#39;m the one who needs the extra hour of dark in the morning just as much as we all enjoy the extra hour of daylight in the evening.<br/>

the longer evenings and later mornings.  When we were in Oregon it was<br/>
splendid to have daylight until 9:00 at night.  What I hate is the shifting<br/>
back and forth.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t lead a truly unschooled life because<br/>
I live with someone who has to meet deadlines and I have deadlines to meet<br/>
as well.  Getting up at 5am isn&#39;t that big of an issue unless your body<br/>
confused by 5am being at 4 am.  If we could just stay where we are it would<br/>
be ever so loverly!<br/>

  I&#39;ll share yesterday.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I was up at 6:30 to see dh off to work; spent some time at the &#39;puter catching up on email and posts.  Dan woke at about 7 am (his usual time) and we snuggled for a while.  I puttered around and thought about breakfast, while Dan watched some morning TV.  I made breakfast for me and Dan -- Andy had quietly gotten up around 9 am and fetched a bowl of cereal for himself. At Andy&#39;s request, I called the Mom we were meeting later in the day twice, first to say we&#39;d be later than usual and ask her to sign Andy up early (the workshop fills up fast), then to ask her son to bring his yu-gi-oh cards.  <br/>
   <br/>
  The boys played inside and outside for much of the morning, while I did some reading and searched my arcane filing system looking for the paperwork we&#39;ll need for the mortgage lenders next week when we meet (we&#39;re house-shopping!).  Several times thru the morning, Will asked what time it was, since he was scheduled to be at work at 2pm, and was still trying to sleep on the couch. Everyone had at least one turn at the computer to game or chat. I explained to Will that his work start-time conflicted with Andy&#39;s regular Tues activity, so Will offered that I could drop him off at work at 1:30 pm (he&#39;ll be moving into his own place this weekend, so one less person for me to cart around -- yippee!).<br/>
   <br/>
  At 1:15 or so we all headed for the car, with both me and Will heading back inside for one last forgotten thing (usual for us).  Dropped Will at work, hit the Wendy&#39;s drive up for nuggets and sodas, then off to the kids&#39; museum where Andy goes to a weekly computer-robotics workshop.  This is a relatively new thing for him.  Several weeks ago, we were there on a Tuesday, ran into a family of unschoolers we hadn&#39;t seen in more than a year and found that our boys hit it off great (the two older ones hadn&#39;t years ago).  Between us, there are two 9yo boys and two 5yo boys, and everyone had a great time playing.  G asked Andy to do the robo workshop with him, Andy loved it and we made a standing date to meet at the museum mid-morning Tuesday.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We all left the museum at 4pm, they to another date, we to try out the just-reopened (yesterday) playground/park across the street.  It&#39;s been a favorite playground, and we&#39;ve waited months for the update to be finished. The boys tried out all the new equipment, and the old stuff, enjoying the yummy spring day.  At about 5:20, we headed towards home, with a stop at Sonic for shakes to keep us company as we sat in rush-hour traffic.  <br/>
   <br/>
  At home the boys played, squabbled some, and hung out with their daddy.  People had dinner, watched TV or whatever thru the evening.  By 9:20, dh was back from picking Will up at work, Dan was asleep, and Andy was in his room playing with legos (his legos are out constantly, and he tinkers with them whenever he&#39;s in his room) and watching TV.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Dh and I set up his coffee and packed his lunch for today, then were in bed by 10, since he gets up at 4:30.<br/>
   <br/>
  Along the way in our day, the boys and I talked about music, the yard/moving sale we&#39;re planning, which toys and books we can sell off and what they&#39;ll do with their share of the income.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;re all talking lately about what we want in a house we&#39;ll buy sometime this summer (both boys have asked for stairs and Dan wants to be able to walk to visit his best friend), my niece&#39;s visit this July, Dan&#39;s soccer plans for August and Andy&#39;s desire to start archery lessons, but not until after his birthday in June (I don&#39;t know why he wants to wait, but they&#39;re his plans not mine) and the upcoming trip to Grand Canyon/Las Vegas in July to see the grandparents and a huge family reunion, so those conversations swirl thru most of our days lately.  <br/>
   <br/>
  This was harder than I thought it would be. When we spend our days living free lives, it all sort of runs together and becomes one big mural of life, with different moments and words relating to other thing in very stream of consciousness ways.  It feels to me like just the way life is supposed to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905022958">Yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
Dan (7) rescued a baby bunny that the cat was tormenting (the kids buried the poor thing this morning).  All the kids had breakfast and cared for their animals.  Dan and Marsie (9) went with me to the grocery store where Marsie spent her allowance (not tied to chores)on candy that she shared with her siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us went to park day with other homeschoolers where whoever wanted made cascarones (bird seed filled egg shells)with eggs from our chickens.  Dan spent the time catching crawdads in the creek.  Marsie and Michelle (6) played dolls.  Adriane (15) and Zach (12) stayed home to watch a movie on television.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home, I took Adriane to gymnastics.  Zach helped Dan with a video game while Marsie and Michelle went swimming.  We all went to Dan&#39;s baseball practice where we met DH.  We came home to find the neighbor furious that our dog (who is a big baby but can look scary) had gotten into his yard and frightened his little girl.  We made a plan to improve the fencing.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie, Michelle and Zach went with me to get pizza for supper.  Then the kids and DH watched sports on TV and eventually wandered off to bed.<br/>

&gt; everyone had a great time playing.  G asked Andy to do the robo <br/>
&gt; workshop with him, Andy loved it and we made a standing date to <br/>
&gt; meet at the museum mid-morning Tuesday.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  We all left the museum at 4pm, they to another date, we to try <br/>
&gt; out the just-reopened (yesterday) playground/park across the <br/>
&gt; street.  It&#39;s been a favorite playground, and we&#39;ve waited months <br/>
&gt; for the update to be finished. The boys tried out all the new <br/>
&gt; equipment, and the old stuff, enjoying the yummy spring day.  At <br/>
&gt; about 5:20, we headed towards home, with a stop at Sonic for <br/>
&gt; shakes to keep us company as we sat in rush-hour traffic.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  At home the boys played, squabbled some, and hung out with their <br/>
&gt; daddy.  People had dinner, watched TV or whatever thru the <br/>
&gt; evening.  By 9:20, dh was back from picking Will up at work, Dan <br/>
&gt; was asleep, and Andy was in his room playing with legos (his legos <br/>
&gt; are out constantly, and he tinkers with them whenever he&#39;s in his <br/>
&gt; room) and watching TV.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  Dh and I set up his coffee and packed his lunch for today, then <br/>
&gt; were in bed by 10, since he gets up at 4:30.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  Along the way in our day, the boys and I talked about music, the <br/>
&gt; yard/moving sale we&#39;re planning, which toys and books we can sell <br/>
&gt; off and what they&#39;ll do with their share of the income.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  We&#39;re all talking lately about what we want in a house we&#39;ll buy <br/>
&gt; sometime this summer (both boys have asked for stairs and Dan <br/>
&gt; wants to be able to walk to visit his best friend), my niece&#39;s <br/>
&gt; visit this July, Dan&#39;s soccer plans for August and Andy&#39;s desire <br/>
&gt; to start archery lessons, but not until after his birthday in June <br/>
&gt; (I don&#39;t know why he wants to wait, but they&#39;re his plans not <br/>
&gt; mine) and the upcoming trip to Grand Canyon/Las Vegas in July to <br/>
&gt; see the grandparents and a huge family reunion, so those <br/>
&gt; conversations swirl thru most of our days lately.  <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  This was harder than I thought it would be. When we spend our <br/>
&gt; days living free lives, it all sort of runs together and becomes <br/>
&gt; one big mural of life, with different moments and words relating <br/>
&gt; to other thing in very stream of consciousness ways.  It feels to <br/>
&gt; me like just the way life is supposed to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176938980">I&#39;m not much into force about anything except<br/>
health/safety. However I&#39;ve had many jobs where I<br/>
needed skills that weren&#39;t part of the major focus of<br/>
the job. For example as a social worker I needed to<br/>
type so I could do all the form filling required. As a<br/>
member of a community organization I needed to do<br/>
accounting to help keep the project together. In a<br/>
required art class I had to learn to do lettering and<br/>
it was later essential when I was making signs for a<br/>
street department I worked for.<br/>
<br/>
Sure I could have tried to learn these things at the<br/>
point when I desperately needed them at work, but it<br/>
was also nice to already have them. If I hadn&#39;t had<br/>
them I couldn&#39;t have done the job.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m just a dabbler, but I like knowing very<br/>
different things. Many are NOT things I was initially<br/>
drawn to by my personal interests. The interest<br/>
developed as I was exposed to the subject in some more<br/>
general class/ life requirement. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m just wondering how folks integrate doing<br/>
just what you want with things I consider tasks. Tasks<br/>
to me are things that I wouldn&#39;t do except I don&#39;t<br/>
have the money to hire someone else to do them. They<br/>
are things I&#39;ve learned to do as part of my life&#39;s<br/>
requirements. These include some things I do to keep<br/>
my house functioning (repairs/maint) and things I do<br/>
to keep my businesses going. Even with my own business<br/>
there are always aspects I find not very interesting<br/>
or motivating. Still they need to be done, so I do<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Do people find that kids learn this by having projects<br/>
they love and just letting them see that there will be<br/>
parts they have to learn to do that are outside their<br/>
interest area? Ideally I&#39;d see this as a reasonable<br/>
way to learn more things, but when I read people&#39;s<br/>
descriptions of what their kids do I rarely see this<br/>
mentioned. For example, a story like Jon loves animals<br/>
and so has many, and he&#39;s learning math, which he&#39;s<br/>
always avoided, as he has to calculate costs, food<br/>
intake, etc for his pets.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody has any stories like this, please share. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010306741">I don&#39;t have specifics to share at the moment (we&#39;re on the beginning edges<br/>
of unschooling ourselves), but I have also been thinking about this type of<br/>
question.  I&#39;d like to share some rambling, half-formed thoughts, and see<br/>
where they go. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The biggest difficulty I see in trying to &quot;teach&quot; our kids skills that might<br/>
come up later is this: how do we know what those skills will be?  I know my<br/>
husband&#39;s viewpoint in this is that a typical public school education will<br/>
cover everything, one way or another, and that way you know you&#39;re covered.<br/>
Of course the vast majority of that (IMHO) is boring, almost immediately<br/>
forgotten, or never really absorbed in the first place due to lack of<br/>
interest.  So there is all that time wasted (again, IMO) with info that they<br/>
may or may not need later on.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about my children&#39;s days, I can see where they are picking up the<br/>
basics of life without a major curriculum surrounding them.  To pull from<br/>
the examples you used below; they both love the computer, so typing is being<br/>
practiced all the time.  Accounting isn&#39;t something I know how to do, except<br/>
for the basics of balancing a checkbook - and that is learned when you get a<br/>
bank account, usually in your teen years.  I don&#39;t actually know what<br/>
&quot;lettering&quot; is in regards to art, so I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>
that, lol!  But if I was an artist I suppose I would have come across it at<br/>
some point.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can also think of plenty of skills that I needed for a job, but didn&#39;t<br/>
have when I got the job.  No biggie, I&#39;m a smart, curious girl, so I picked<br/>
those up as I went along.  I think most people do that without thinking much<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My hope is that my children will learn to learn.  They will aquire the<br/>
skills that enable them to figure out a problem, to find information that<br/>
they need, to learn essential skills.  That way, no matter what they do in<br/>
life, they will be well prepared to succeed.  Not because they have a bunch<br/>
of facts stuffed in their heads (although they might have that too, curious<br/>
little buggers that they are, lol!).  But because they know how to learn.<br/>
And anyway, who says typing will even be used in 15-20 years?  Maybe<br/>
everyone will be talking to computers in a Star Trekkie way!  So there is a<br/>
skill that a kid might never need to know.  Not that the knowledge itself is<br/>
worthless and bad.  But if they didn&#39;t want to know it in the first place,<br/>
but were forced to do so, that&#39;s what I want to avoid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219442930">&#39;The biggest difficulty I see in trying to &quot;teach&quot; our kids skills<br/>
that might come up later is this: how do we know what those skills<br/>
will be? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely!! You sound like a true unschooler.:)<br/>
<br/>
Not only do we NOT know exactly what skills our children need, the<br/>
coercion and crap surrounding &quot;teaching&quot; actually hinders the learning<br/>
process. With unschooling, learning is important but teaching does not<br/>
matter. I would go as far as to say there is no such thing as<br/>
teaching, only learning (to semi-quote a famous brainiac).<br/>
<br/>
If a skill is &quot;basic&quot;, that means it&#39;s basic to living, it&#39;s useful<br/>
for day to day LIFE.  If it&#39;s something &quot;basic&quot;, then we will<br/>
naturally come across it all the time. If it&#39;s &quot;basic&quot; to living, then<br/>
why would there be ANY need to teach it or try to instill it? It&#39;s<br/>
BASIC. Specialized information or skills take some seeking, but BASICS<br/>
are all around us and are used constantly....otherwise they aren&#39;t<br/>
basic.:)<br/>
<br/>
There is not ONE thing on this earth that everyone needs to know. In<br/>
fact, why don&#39;t some of you throw out a topic or subject you think ALL<br/>
humans need to know and I&#39;ll give you an example of someone getting<br/>
along just fine without it.:)<br/>
<br/>
Children will naturally pick up basics by LIVING and doing that which<br/>
we love.  I believe that if we are to really trust children, we must<br/>
first learn to trust the instinct to learn. If we trust the instinct<br/>
to learn, how can we doubt that the &quot;basics&quot; will be picked up as needed?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717606263">If a kid HATES writing, forcing it won&#39;t help - trust me on this one. <br/>
I&#39;ve had some of the most dedicated singleminded compulsive people<br/>
you&#39;ve ever met try to &quot;fix&quot; my handwriting with practice, techniques,<br/>
grips, bribes and anything else you could think of.  Nothing they did<br/>
EVER made a difference in my day to day writing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, however - without any of the pressure or nonsense - I&#39;m finding<br/>
that I can write neater with just a few adjustments.  Lately, I&#39;ve<br/>
been breaking a LOT of the rules of writing - forming my letters from<br/>
the bottom, making the lines out of order, etc. - but my handwriting<br/>
is becoming legible.  On its own.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be happening, but it is.  Go figure.<br/>
