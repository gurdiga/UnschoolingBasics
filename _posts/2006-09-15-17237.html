<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107858535">&quot;They could not let him in there- OSHA standards state no customers<br/>
allowed in work area. The woman got really uptight and told my husband<br/>
that they don&#39;t believe in telling their children &quot;no&quot;. He then said<br/>
that she went on a little about self directed learning, and used some<br/>
of the words I use (shows you how much men sometimes listen).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well....it shows a lack of respect for a public place in my opinion,<br/>
to expect the whole world to have their same values. If she thinks<br/>
everyone in the world is open to the idea of letting kids be right<br/>
there while they work, she&#39;s sadly mistaken. Yeah, it would be great,<br/>
but we&#39;re talking about a business,not a private residence. He DOES<br/>
have to consider liabilty issues.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great to let kids be up close and dabble with real stuff,<br/>
but I certainly don&#39;t expect everyone we meet to ensure this ideal.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how she never tells her child &quot;no&quot; unless they&#39;re just<br/>
really mellow kids. I think &quot;no&quot; can be just as mindful as &quot;yes&quot;<br/>
sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641283071">I had the same opinion as I was reading the story. I think in our  <br/>
case (and I&#39;ve said this to my kids before at the shop) &quot;You know,  <br/>
the rules of this place is that customers are not allowed (pointing)  <br/>
this sign says &quot;X,Y, Z&quot;. But I know we can figure out another way to  <br/>
see stuff up close&quot;. Then we call around smaller shops, or heck,  <br/>
visit my redneck in-laws who have most of the tools rusting in their  <br/>
front yards ;-)  I think stewing about it teaches kids to resent and  <br/>
stew, when it is very easy to open a learning moment about what we  <br/>
CAN do.<br/>
