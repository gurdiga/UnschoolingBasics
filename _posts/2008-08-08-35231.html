Yep, each of us will handle this differently -- how we express ourselves when our kids are into something we don&#39;t value.<br/>
<br/>
Here we see all sorts of &quot;dumb&quot; things on TV. Some we watch and laugh at together -- love to hate that Ninja game show. :) <br/>
<br/>
We also don&#39;t get bent out of shape when the other guy doesn&#39;t like something we like. We know the difference between liking a person and liking a TV show.<br/>

&gt; I am free to say I think it is dumb<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like people passing negative judgments (dumb, stupid, boring, <br/>
etc.) on what I like so I don&#39;t do it to the other people in my life.<br/>
