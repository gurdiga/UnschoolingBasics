<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857944604">Just wanted to share this newer forum with you all, just in case<br/>
anyone is intererested: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amimckay.com/forum/index.php">http://www.amimckay.com/forum/index.php</a><br/>
<br/>
Ami is a writer, currently working on her first novel (through a<br/>
publisher). I first found out about her at soulfulliving.com, where<br/>
she&#39;s written some awesome articles. Her blog is beautiful (I think<br/>
there&#39;s a link to it from soulfulliving).<br/>
<br/>
I read some of her blog and was inspired to write and tell her how<br/>
much I adored her writing and viewpoints. She wrote back and come to<br/>
find out, she&#39;s an unschooler!! That was several months ago...<br/>
So anyway, when she started her new forum, she invited me and asked<br/>
me to let others know about it.<br/>
She&#39;s got a thread for home/unschooling started, stuff for writers<br/>
and a place for lore on Nova Scotia. She&#39;s a really incredible free<br/>
spirit, and I think some of you would enjoy it.<br/>
