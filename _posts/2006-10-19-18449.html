<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393790158">I have followed the &quot;Learning to Read&quot; thread with great interest and thought I would weigh in.  We have four children (9, 8, 7 & 4 1/2).  With the exception of the 7 year old who attended 1st grade last year (home now), they have been homeschooled from the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
The three older children were taught to read using a book titled Phonics Pathways.  This was a very simple book using progressively more difficult lessons.  By the end of the book all three children were reading well.  Rather than boring them with phonics, I feel very strongly that they have been given a great gift and part of the mystery that is reading our language can now be carefully uncoded.  There are so many words that a child will never routinely encounter in day to day life.  Being dependent on someone else to help with each of these words can lead to frustration and ultimately a dislike of reading.  <br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old finished reading the Harry Potter books this summer.  I looked through The Goblet of Fire this morning to see if I could find some examples to illustrate my point.  Here are some words I found:  transmogrify, divination, parchment, dwindling, impartial, dormitory.  Will he have known the meaning to each of these words as he came to them?  Of course not, but just being able to pronounce them in his mind encourages him to look for meaning in the context.<br/>
<br/>
Now to my 7 year old daughter whose phonics instruction was interrupted when we made the bizarre decision to send her to first grade.  There she faced a room with labels on many objects and lists of sight words to memorize.  Her reading is at a completely different level than her brother&#39;s was at her age.  She does not particularly enjoy reading because she has to constantly stop and ask me about particular words.<br/>
<br/>
While they are definitely very different learners, I am convinced that resuming phonics instruction with her will make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
I have only recently begun to consider unschooling and my philosophy on reading is obviously not very unschoolingish, but perhaps some of you will consider my ideas as I have been considering yours for the last few months.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this.  Why would being able to pronounce a word <br/>
make someone want to know what it means more than if they couldn&#39;t <br/>
pronounce it?  IMO, people want to know what unfamiliar words mean <br/>
regardless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There she faced a room with labels on many objects and lists of <br/>

level than her brother&#39;s was at her age.  She does not particularly <br/>
enjoy reading because she has to constantly stop and ask me about <br/>
particular words.<br/>
<br/>
There is a world of learning to read between phonics instruction and <br/>
lists of sight words.  The process can be pretty mysterious really, <br/>
but both of my girls figured it out on their own without <br/>
frustration.  And even though they never had phonics instruction, <br/>
they can pronounce unfamiliar words quite well.  And they don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily memorize each individual word either.  Like I said, it&#39;s <br/>
mysterious :)  With my daughters, it just kind of sunk in, and soon <br/>
they were reading just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest dd began reading at 3, so my dh thought it was just a <br/>
fluke.  But my younger dd is now 6 and suddenly surprising us all <br/>
with what she can read.  Dh is amazed!  He was made to feel stupid <br/>
as a child because his younger sister was reading before he was, but <br/>
it is such an individual process.  I wish I could see inside the <br/>
brains of my girls because it is so interesting to see this unfold.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, my point is that if a group of kids are taught with phonics, <br/>
some kids will pick it up and some will be tortuously sounding <br/>
things out for years.  The same goes for memorizing sight words - <br/>
that may work great for some and be painful for others.  Why not <br/>
give them a chance to figure it out?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; While they are definitely very different learners, I am convinced <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that resuming phonics instruction with her will make a big <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
A big difference to her?  To you?  Is reading important to her right <br/>
now, today?  Is she frustrated because other people are trying to <br/>
tell her &quot;this is how you learn to read&quot; and she&#39;s not getting it?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have only recently begun to consider unschooling and my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>philosophy on reading is obviously not very unschoolingish, but <br/>
perhaps some of you will consider my ideas as I have been <br/>
considering yours for the last few months.<br/>
<br/>
We pretty much all went to school as children, and we probably all <br/>
encountered phonics instruction in school.  Maybe some of us <br/>
remember it fondly - I don&#39;t know.  I do remember SRA cards and how <br/>
incredibly boring they were.  It was all about doing the work and <br/>
moving on to the next level.  I just did what I needed to do and <br/>
then read for pleasure at home, but then reading came easy to me.  I <br/>
know that the huge box of SRA cards must have been overwhelming to <br/>
some of the other kids who weren&#39;t ready to read at 6 years old.  <br/>
Just like my dh, who thought &quot;I&#39;ll never read as well as my sister, <br/>
so why bother?&quot;  It took him years to get over that message and <br/>
realize that he is very smart, and he loves reading now.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have been considering our ideas, are you planning to try <br/>
any? :)  <br/>

<br/>
It really depends on the particular child. My daughter<br/>
(7) had figured out the phonics rules a long time ago,<br/>
i.e. when she was 4 or 5. She&#39;s still not reading much<br/>
because decoding every word phonetically is a pain.<br/>
Besides a great many words in English are not phonetic<br/>
at all. Now that she knows more words by sight she<br/>
starting to read more.<br/>
<br/>
My son(5) is a much more visual learner and I think<br/>
he&#39;ll learn words by sight. He did not learn any<br/>
letters by themselves. He learnt to spell his name and<br/>
then everyone else&#39;s name in our family. Now he&#39;s<br/>
encountered other letters in words that he sees around<br/>
like STOP on stop signs.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that knowing some phonics helps decode new<br/>
words while reading books. But a child who&#39;s made it<br/>
to that level of reading will have gathered some<br/>
phonics on the way anyway. I&#39;m just not convinced that<br/>
it&#39;s a good starting point for every child.<br/>

aren&#39;t common in their venacular.  :)  Being able to pronounce a word<br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily equate with being able to understand the meaning<br/>
of the word.  I have 2 children who never had &quot;official reading<br/>
lessons&quot; and both of them read very well, comprehend way above &quot;grade<br/>
level&quot; (whatever that really means - I just notice that they read<br/>
books that are more difficult than what are on the reading lists for<br/>
their ages) and have a huge vocabulary.  My son uses phrases like<br/>
&quot;engineering mechanisms&quot; and &quot;explosive ordinances&quot; and has for quite<br/>
some time.  I think word understanding comes more from use than from<br/>
being able to pronounce them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484461885">Michele, thanks for sharing your experience about phonics resources.<br/>
However, this sentence is the crux of unschooling, I believe: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Her reading is at a completely different level than her brother&#39;s was<br/>
at her age. She does not particularly enjoy reading because she has to<br/>
constantly stop and ask me about particular words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, it really doesn&#39;t matter if a child is at a<br/>
completely different level than another was at any age. My perception<br/>
is that the ability to read only distracts from opportunities to do<br/>
other equally valid activities. I don&#39;t believe that there is a lost<br/>
opportunity for a child not to be able to read, until they are seeking<br/>
to do so. For instance, our son learns though observation, auditory<br/>
intake of information and memory/recall, instead of relying on the<br/>
written word for storing or exchanging information. The ability to<br/>
enjoy a (non)/fiction story is not limited to the written word, of<br/>
course. In fact, I don&#39;t believe that the written word has greater<br/>
value than storytelling or media representation of (non)/fiction. It<br/>
is just a different tool of conveying information. <br/>
<br/>
The ability to sound out words, is discrete from the ability to<br/>
recognize meanings of words. The theory is that a person has exposure<br/>
to a larger vocabulary through the written word than through verbal<br/>
oratory. I guess that depends on if one is &#39;stoping to constantly ask<br/>
about particular words&#39;, or not. Our son deduces meaning from context<br/>
independently anyway, or occasionally he asks about a new word. So, I<br/>
don&#39;t see the merit of reading &#39;earlier&#39; especially if one &#39;does not<br/>
particularly enjoy reading&#39;, for whatever reason. When reading serves<br/>
its own value and enjoyment, there are many tools of enriching that<br/>
interest, beyond the use of a structured lesson since learning happens<br/>
all the time. Symbolic representation of meaning with words exists<br/>
everywhere; one doensn&#39;t need to read a phonics lesson to deduce how<br/>
letters are related to sounds. Our son just spontaneously pops out<br/>
with &#39;mama, boy starts with the b-sound&#39;. He wasn&#39;t taught that, he<br/>
figured it out. <br/>
<br/>
Respectfully, <br/>
<br/>
Pat</div>

Again, I&#39;m late weighing in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The three older children were taught to read using a book titled <br/>
Phonics<br/>

given a<br/>

be<br/>
carefully uncoded.  There are so many words that a child will never <br/>
routinely<br/>
encounter in day to day life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like Hermione? That&#39;s one of my favorite recent ones that so many <br/>
people mispronounce.<br/>
<br/>
How would phonics help that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Being dependent on someone else to help with each<br/>
of these words can lead to frustration and ultimately a dislike of <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Being dependent on your mom is the way it&#39;s *supposed* to be until <br/>
you&#39;re ready to do it on your own!<br/>
<br/>
Schools regularly lead to frustration and ultimately a dislike of <br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old finished reading the Harry Potter books this summer.  I <br/>
looked<br/>
through The Goblet of Fire this morning to see if I could find some <br/>
examples to<br/>
illustrate my point.  Here are some words I found:  transmogrify, <br/>
divination,<br/>
parchment, dwindling, impartial, dormitory.  Will he have known the <br/>
meaning to<br/>
each of these words as he came to them?  Of course not, but just being <br/>
able to<br/>
pronounce them in his mind encourages him to look for meaning in the <br/>
context.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s why we READ to them! That&#39;s why we answer questions about <br/>
pronumciation and spelling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Now to my 7 year old daughter whose phonics instruction was interrupted <br/>
when we<br/>
made the bizarre decision to send her to first grade.  There she faced <br/>
a room<br/>
with labels on many objects and lists of sight words to memorize.  Her <br/>
reading<br/>
is at a completely different level than her brother&#39;s was at her age.  <br/>
She does<br/>
not particularly enjoy reading because she has to constantly stop and <br/>
ask me<br/>
about particular words.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that&#39;s due to a lack of phonics instruction? Or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
due to being forced to read before she was ready. School does that a <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
While they are definitely very different learners, I am convinced that <br/>
resuming<br/>
phonics instruction with her will make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you are convinced, we can&#39;t change your mind.<br/>
<br/>
But I know she&#39;ll read when she&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have only recently begun to consider unschooling and my philosophy on <br/>
reading<br/>
is obviously not very unschoolingish, but perhaps some of you will <br/>
consider my<br/>
ideas as I have been considering yours for the last few months.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I could read before I went to school. I had EXTENSIVE phonics <br/>
instruction. I still have the phonics notebook in which I wrote each <br/>
and every phonics rule. I liked the phonics idea. It made sense to my <br/>
seven year old brain. But I could *already* read. I was looking at the <br/>
rules I was learning and comparing them to the words and &quot;rules&quot; I <br/>
already knew. Kind of like math: if you understand the theory in <br/>
practice, then it&#39;s simple to apply the formula.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys learned whole word language---Cameron in school and Duncan <br/>
at home in his own time. They both understand how letters and phonics <br/>
work---maybe not the RULES, but the principles. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
