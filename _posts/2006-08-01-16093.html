<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688606555">I&#39;ve turned our &quot;classical&quot; homeschooling family upside down recently.  <br/>
First came my announcement that although I was raised Catholic, I don&#39;t <br/>
believe in God.  Whew, that&#39;s out of the bag, although my mother still <br/>
doesn&#39;t know, shh!.  Second came the decision (mutually agreed with by <br/>
husband, whew, that makes it easier ;-) ) to unschool and then upon <br/>
further research to try to be a radical unschooler.  We have four <br/>
children: ds7, dd5, dd2 1/2 and dd5 months.  I already shocked both <br/>
sides of our family when we home birthed, and nurse well beyond <br/>
toddlerville and use cloth diapers and wear my babies everywhere I go <br/>
and live/eat as organically as affordable.  Homeschooling fit right in <br/>
to our attachment parenting lifestyle.  However, the private school <br/>
teacher in me (that I quit once I became pregnant with my first and <br/>
wizened up) is finally letting go of her schedules and lesson plans and <br/>
scopes and curriculum want lists and letting our children learn naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Enough about me and back to the question at hand.  I&#39;m learning and <br/>
trying every day to be a more mindful parent.  My biggest problem is <br/>
thinking fast enough; analyzing the current situation (example: sibling <br/>
spat) and trying to figure out the &quot;radical&quot; way to handle it.  So far <br/>
my hind sight is much clearer, especially after reading this list.  How <br/>
do you seasoned radicals think fast enough to avoid the raised <br/>
voices/threats/punishments?  and what will our kids think of us if we <br/>
constantly reconfigure how we handled a certain situation in the past?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

(you&#39;ll be hearing from me regularly I&#39;m sure....thanks for your <br/>
patience.  I am sooo grateful for everyone&#39;s advice!)</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do we &quot;think fast enough to avoid past actions?&quot;  Simple.  Time,<br/>
experience, pre-planning and screwing up.  :)  Seriously, not all of us were<br/>
raised in a radically unschooled (or at the very least attachment parented)<br/>
household and even when we try to do differently, those past influences<br/>
still haunt the best of us.  Read the archives and see all the times that<br/>
Deb, Ren, Rue, Kelly and Pam have &quot;confessed&quot; to learning something new!<br/>
<br/>
What will our kids think if we are constantly reconfiguring situations?<br/>
That we are caring, understanding, trusting, forgiving and forgiveable,<br/>
learning and kind.  My kids were shocked the first time their play got a bit<br/>
rough and something was broken (can&#39;t even remember what it was) and I<br/>
simply said, &quot;Wow, you guys have a ton of energy.  Why don&#39;t you take this<br/>
game out under the tree in the backyard while I clean this up?&quot;  I got the<br/>
&quot;deer in the headlights&quot; stare as they waited for me to blow my cool.  It<br/>
never blew and the kids enjoyed their game outside and later came in where<br/>
we had bowls of ice cream and laughed about the silly rules of their new<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to show kids you are flexible and changing.  Isn&#39;t that how we want<br/>
them to be?  How better for them to learn that than by witnessing that in<br/>
their parents.  :-)  Welcome to Unschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432904536">How <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do you seasoned radicals think fast enough to avoid the raised <br/>
&gt; voices/threats/punishments?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the things I learned from these lists is that I do not have <br/>
to think as fast as I thought I had to.  The recommendation to <br/>
breath before reacting has helped a lot.  The breath helps me keep <br/>
that first knee-jerk thing I think of in my head from exiting my <br/>
mouth.  I have also learned, in the case of sibling spats, that <br/>
silence is a fabulous tool.  It&#39;s amazing how easily an issue can be <br/>
resolved by my children&#39;s own devices.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t work, I still breathe first and try to separate my <br/>
own feelings from the situation.  I then try to really listen to the <br/>
child(ren).  In the case of a fight, I try to separate the children, <br/>
so that I can give each child my full attention while helping them <br/>
to calm down.  I then try to sympathize with their feelings and <br/>
validate them, if possible, by sharing my own experience in a <br/>
similar situation.  I also might explain to each child what the <br/>
other person&#39;s perspective might be and what that person might be <br/>
feeling.  I finally ask each child to tell the other how they are <br/>
feeling.  This can be very difficult because it&#39;s hard to articulate <br/>
what you are feeling when all you really want to do is throw a shoe <br/>
at the other person. :)  It is just amazing to watch the children <br/>
interact after I have taken them through this process.  They will <br/>
very gently tell the other how they are hurt/angry/upset and then, <br/>
this is the part that blows me away, actually make multiple <br/>
suggestions on how their sister/brother can avoid the incident in <br/>
the future.  They actually extend help to the other person that they <br/>
were mad at just a few minutes earlier.  Often times, after talking <br/>
they will run off to play together.  I know this sounds long, but it <br/>
takes about 5 minutes, 10 minutes max.<br/>

 How do you seasoned radicals think fast enough to avoid the raised<br/>
 voices/threats/punishments?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fast thinking. I think it&#39;s about <br/>
s-l-o-w-i-n-g-d-o-w-n! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Before you open your mouth, STOP. Breathe. Think. Then say what you <br/>
wish you could have heard when you were in that kind of position. How <br/>
would *you* have like to have been treated?<br/>
<br/>
  Also---you can stop long enough to think of at least TWO options. Pick <br/>
the nicer one.<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t always do what&#39;s right or best. Forgive yourself. Apologize <br/>
to your child(ren). Do better next time.<br/>
<br/>
 Slow down.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 and what will our kids think of us if we<br/>
 constantly reconfigure how we handled a certain situation in the past?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Hopefully, they&#39;ll realize that we can do better when we know better. <br/>
That we learn. That we can change. That we are constantly striving to <br/>
be better parents. Better people. That we love them enough to be work <br/>
at it and make things better. It could give them the same inspiration! <br/>
To make good their own mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think anyone would *regret* becoming gentler or kinder or more <br/>
generous or more patient or more trusting. Do you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346901118">Well, I just wanted to say that I don&#39;t analyze quickly or handle.  <br/>
One thing I&#39;ve learned about me is that THAT is the fast track back  <br/>
to the parenting I grew up with. So I learned to be comfortable  <br/>
saying &quot;We need a break&quot; or &quot;I really need time to think about this&quot;  <br/>
and best of all &quot;Wow, mom really blew that one, what&#39;s something  <br/>
better we can do?&quot; The kids respect me a lot more for saying sorry  <br/>
and asking for their advice, and for being able to retract my  <br/>
tendency to legislate or rule from on high (as Josh puts it) :-P<br/>
HTH a little anyway.<br/>

My  biggest problem is <br/>
thinking fast enough; analyzing the current situation  (example: sibling <br/>
spat) and trying to figure out the &quot;radical&quot; way to  handle it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For us, I don&#39;t try to handle the situation.  I encourage my boys to  talk <br/>
about it together.  Talk about their feelings.  If they can&#39;t do  it together <br/>
because they are too angry, then they willingly separate for a bit  and I talk <br/>
with each of them so that we all understand the feelings surrounding  the <br/>
situation, and each of them has articulated what they are wanting/needing at  that <br/>
particular time.  Once they can articulate this then they work towards  a <br/>
mutually agreeable solution.  When they were younger they needed more  help.  Help <br/>
with verbalizing their feelings, wants and needs mostly.   I have found that <br/>
they have always been the best at coming up with different  solutions.  As <br/>
they get older they need less and less help.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have been working at this since my boys were babies so it probably comes  <br/>
easier to me now.  But I do know that it is hard work.  My dh and I  talked <br/>
about these issues before we had children.  You know those old tapes  play over <br/>
and over in your head at times.  The voice of your mother or  grandmother.  I <br/>
grew up with controlling parents.  Naomi Aldort, in  her new book, articulates <br/>
this well, I think it was her book.  About  stopping when you want to speak <br/>
and letting that old way of thinking play out in  your head.  Say all the things <br/>
that come to mind, those knee jerk  reactions, just say them in your head.  <br/>
Then stop and say what you really  mean to say.  And if you find those words <br/>
actually spilling out of your  mouth.  It is OK to say let me start again.  Take <br/>
it back and think  about your response and start over.  After a while you <br/>
won&#39;t have to do  that, what you really want to say will be the first thing out <br/>
of your  mouth.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway this is early for me, LOL.<br/>
Long enough,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same way that you know how to ride a bicycle or drive a car or swim <br/>
or play tennis or whatever - over time practicing and &#39;tweaking&#39; and <br/>
trying again until certain ways of acting become second nature. Not <br/>
perfect ever really - it&#39;s a process, a path, a direction, not a <br/>
destination to arrive at. <br/>
<br/>
You do the best you can with what you know now and when you know <br/>
better, you try to do better. Give yourself that same opportunity to <br/>
change and grow that you give your kids. If they question it &quot;Hey <br/>
Mom how come last month when I jumped on the couch you yelled and <br/>
took away my GameBoy for a week and now you&#39;re helping me pile the <br/>
cushions on the floor to jump on?&quot; Keep it simple &quot;I&#39;m sorry I <br/>
yelled so much in the past and punished you like that. I&#39;ve come to <br/>
realize that yelling and all that was really not the way I wanted to <br/>
be so I&#39;m working on changing how I act.&quot; Not only is it explaining <br/>
to them what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s giving them a live example that it is <br/>
possible to change things, you don&#39;t have to be &#39;stuck&#39; with this or <br/>
that behavior or habit if you don&#39;t want to be. And, too, they see <br/>
that grownups aren&#39;t perfect - think of how often adults do things <br/>
to kids they wouldn&#39;t want done to them yet how little kids get <br/>
apologized to the way we would to another adult. For instance, if I <br/>
yelled at my DH for something, I&#39;d likely apologize when I cooled <br/>
down &quot;I&#39;m sorry I yelled - I was really frustrated because...&quot; and <br/>
we&#39;d discuss it. For some folks, if they yell at a child, they see <br/>
no need to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry I yelled, I was really frustrated <br/>
because...&quot; and discuss the situation. They just go on and assume <br/>
it&#39;ll all blow over and apologizing to kids is a sign of &quot;weak <br/>
parenting&quot; or something, a &quot;lack of control&quot; over the kids. <br/>
Apologies are often seen as a sign of weakness in our culture - only <br/>
the weaker party need apologize- if you&#39;re stronger, richer, more <br/>
powerful, etc. just go about your business no matter what you&#39;ve <br/>
done.<br/>
