currently using my father&#39;s world curr. but it is very hard to use <br/>
some of it because he isn&#39;t reading well yet.  He is very smart and <br/>
learns pretty quickly but he doesn&#39;t like to sit long. So we try to <br/>
make it fun, stimulating and fast.  My youngest is 3 and we will be <br/>
soon starting preschool learning with him not that everyday isn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
You are describing a great sounding, interested, fun kid. One of the<br/>
advantages of Unschooling is you get to keep this authentic child in your<br/>
life instead of overlaying a bunch of stuff and irrelevant information on<br/>
top of him.<br/>
<br/>
The best suggestion I have for you is to put an immediate moratorium on<br/>
*any* lessons, *any* curriculum, any thoughts of you &quot;making it&quot; fun, and<br/>
spend the next few weeks actually having genuine fun and allowing him (and<br/>
your younger one) to play and show you the stuff he is interested in.<br/>
Respond to requests for help or information. Be a driver to interesting<br/>
places. He will not &quot;fall behind&quot;, a concept that is anathema to Unschooling<br/>
with joy, in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, spend as much time as you have available (freed from all<br/>
that lesson planning and review) reading this list and its archives, reading<br/>
at www.sandradodd.com/unschooling , www.unschoolinginfo.com and<br/>
www.unschooling.com , reading John Holt, and observing your child learning<br/>
from his own explorations to give you courage and reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;My youngest is 3 and we will be <br/>
soon starting preschool learning with him not that everyday isn&#39;t <br/>
learning but more time for just him one on one.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t need to bother with him &quot;starting&quot; anything if you decide to<br/>
Unschool. Just let him continue to play with his myriad interests and watch<br/>
them morph and grow over time. <br/>
<br/>
I spend one on one time with my loved ones because I enjoy their company and<br/>
I believe they want my attention, not because they have some learning lack I<br/>
have to address. The motivation really does make a difference to the<br/>
interaction.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling means to follow your child&#39;s lead, trusting them to learn what THEY need to learn rather than what somebody else decides is important.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is asking you to help them learn to read that is fine and wonderful but if you are saying &quot;Come on, time for lessons.  I know you are busy but it won&#39;t take long.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>

It may help to read some articles at www.unschooling.com <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95668113">I am currently reading John Holt&#39;s book &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.  I <br/>
would encourage you to pick this book up from your public library <br/>
and read it before you do any more reading lessons with your son!  <br/>
What an eye opener!  <br/>
I think the reason this book is affecting me in such a profound way <br/>
is that I have been seeing EXACTLY what he is talking about in my <br/>
5yodd!  With my first 2 children I did do &quot;reading lessons&quot; and <br/>
although it didn&#39;t necessarily harm them (because I finally came to <br/>
my senses and stopped LOL) I believe we would have had a lot more <br/>
fun and they would&#39;ve enjoyed reading more had I just let them learn <br/>
in their own way, without &quot;lessons&quot;.  (i.e. UNSCHOOLING)<br/>
So, put your lessons away, and go get that book!<br/>
And, please, post again after you read it and tell me what you <br/>
think! <br/>
Here&#39;s a thought:  Instead of doing hooked on phonics, sit down <br/>
with &quot;Learning All The Time&quot; and read it.  Your son will probaby <br/>
snuggle up next to you with his own book or even ask you what you <br/>
are reading about.  At which point you could share a little with him <br/>
and then Voila!  a reading lesson, the unschooling way!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bridgette - I think the best way for kids to learn to read is from being<br/>
read to as much as they want.  I believe this is how my kids (now 10 and 12)<br/>
learned to read, but I didn&#39;t read to them to teach them to read.  I just<br/>
read to them because it was something fun to do together.  With my daughter,<br/>
I guess I showed her words every now and then, if it was something she<br/>
really liked.  For example, she loves animals, so I would show her the word<br/>
&quot;dog&quot; &#39;cause I think seeing a word you really like to hear written down is<br/>
so cool.  But if you read to your sweet children in the hopes they will<br/>
learn to read, then it won&#39;t work.  I promise they will pick up on the fact<br/>
that you find them not-quite-good-enough.<br/>
     I guess, to me, unschooling is looking for the things in my life and in<br/>
the world in general, find the things that feel joyful, and offer that to my<br/>
children.  Just seeing what they are interested in and helping them do<br/>
whatever it is will accomplish my overall goal for them:  enjoy their life.<br/>
My goal isn&#39;t &quot;be able to read,&quot; or &quot; learn to do this type of math<br/>
problem.&quot;  To me those are tools that they may need one day to enjoy life.<br/>
But why get the tool if you don&#39;t need it yet?<br/>
    Instead of trying to teach my kids anything, I just want them to look at<br/>
life and think, &quot;Wow, there is so much out there.  What do I feel like doing<br/>
today!&quot;   I also think it is important to help my kids do whatever it is<br/>
they feel like doing, rather than comparing them to other kids.  If I think,<br/>
oh, by this age, most kids are doing multiplication tables, and my kids<br/>
aren&#39;t...well that falls under competitve parenting, which is using your<br/>
kids to feel better about yourself.  Also, competitive parenting is<br/>
thinking, &quot;to be a &#39;good parent&#39; I have to, or my kids have to, &lt;fill in the<br/>
blank&gt;.  Unschooling for me has been trying to ignore those expectations.<br/>
    I&#39;ve ssen others say that to unschool, you can think of yourself as a<br/>
tour guide for your kids.  I like that comparison.  Life is so cool--just<br/>
relax and enjoy being with your kids and everything else will fall in line.<br/>

<br/>
Julie&#39;s right...that isn&#39;t unschooling and from my experience here that<br/>
would be the fastest way to kill the joy of learning anything.   I don&#39;t<br/>
expect my kids to interrupt their &quot;busy&quot; play/work/activity to attend any<br/>
other activity unless they are willing.  Not only am i respecting my child&#39;s<br/>
right to choice, but it&#39;s the truest indication as to what is really<br/>
important to them.  I&#39;ve noticed that as a result of allowing my kids to<br/>
choose when and if they want to do something they have developed a true<br/>
sense of personal (and community) responsibility and a exceptional ability<br/>
to voice their desires, opinions, concerns, ideas, thoughts.  Respecting<br/>
their ability to live in the moment has never hindered them from learning<br/>
something they were interested in.<br/>

<br/>
Relax and Just live.<br/>
examples: Today my 6 yo did her reading &quot;lesson&quot; at the restaurant where she<br/>
identified letters and words on the menu and receipt.  My 11 yo &quot;worked&quot; on<br/>
vocabulary word building, grammar, etc by listening to another book on tape.<br/>
<br/>
Listening to the radio while driving always brings up interesting topics for<br/>
discussion...social studies, geography, weather, earth science, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Notice what they are interested in and assist in finding or creating<br/>
opportunities to explore their interests in methods they enjoy.<br/>
example:  11 yo is knitting.  Hearing of a knitting 4H club in our<br/>
neighborhood she declined - would rather learn at her own pace and<br/>
privately.  Where as when hearing about a sewing class she jumped aboard<br/>
wholeheartedly.<br/>
<br/>
Allow them to change thier minds and quit in the middle.  If they know they<br/>
can always quit it will free them up to safely try new things.<br/>
<br/>
Listen carefully and never try to change their minds.  The more i let go of<br/>
my own agenda, the more i learn from my kids and we all gain tremendously in<br/>
more ways than can be mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, enjoy life and enjoy learning new things yourself.<br/>
