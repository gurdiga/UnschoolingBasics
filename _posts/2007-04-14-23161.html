<div id="ygrps-yiv-816518069">We have an appointment Monday afternoon with a new therapist who was recommended by one of my co-leaders.  Originally I was going to go with just my 7yo ds, but now I&#39;m planning to take the whole family (dh, 11yo ds, and 4yo ds).  While 7yo is the one who is chronically irritable (except for the weeks when he isn&#39;t!), aggressive, and has rages, it&#39;s definitely a whole-family issue at this point.  As soon as any of the kids is the least bit bothered by someone, it explodes into angry shouting, &quot;Be quiet!  You&#39;re too loud!  You&#39;re EVIL!&quot;  Also, I think 11yo&#39;s physical impulsiveness -- he&#39;s spending a lot of time trying to prove his &quot;alpha-dog&quot; status -- is often a trigger for 7yo&#39;s aggression toward 4yo.  11yo&#39;s not &quot;mean&quot; the way 7yo is, but he&#39;s not good at respecting &quot;stop&quot; -- especially some weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m a little concerned about helping the therapist understand that we&#39;re not looking for &quot;1-2-3 Magic&quot; or behavior-mod type solutions.  I want to get to the root of what&#39;s causing their (especially 7yo&#39;s) frustrations, and figure out how we can help them communicate and meet their needs better.  At this point, I think we need an outsider (therapist) and a designated time and place to help do this.  I guess I&#39;m afraid we need help but that the therapist (or the next 7 we try:-) will pressure us to use time-out (especially for the aggression) or other &quot;control&quot; methods we aren&#39;t comfortable with.  We did use &quot;time-in&quot; for the aggression for about 6 weeks last summer.  The aggression got worse, then improved, then seemed to slowly be increasing again, but I&#39;m not sure.  It definitely increased when we stopped the &quot;time-ins&quot;.  But we also were seeing a lot of, &quot;He pinched me, he needs a time-out!&quot; -- child looking for retribution, that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with either. <br/>
 (Although, maybe I would be more comfortable with that than the aggression and irritability we&#39;re seeing now.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my boys aren&#39;t exactly thrilled about this appointment.  11 yo&#39;s response was a whiny, &quot;I don&#39;t want to...&quot;  And 7yo&#39;s was, &quot;NO.  I&#39;m not going.  I won&#39;t go.&quot;  I&#39;m sure 4yo&#39;s will echo 7yo&#39;s, but I haven&#39;t brought it up with him yet.  But this is not a decision I think the boys are able to make, and having done some phone therapy sessions before, I also feel that we need a therapist who can actually meet and know the children, not just dh and myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, does anyone have any experience with or thoughts for approaching the therapist?  Or, alternatively, are we just crazy?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667062886">Hi Katharine,  I can sympathize with your frustration--my 3 kids are about<br/>
the same ages as yours, and we have days like you describe--maybe not as<br/>
chronic, but there are those days where I question myself about whether I&#39;m<br/>
doing things &quot;right.&quot;  I mean, I must be doing something wrong if everything<br/>
is sooooo chaotic!  And I have been parenting as non-coercively as possible<br/>
since the birth of my 10 yo, so mine have never really had a lot of no&#39;s or<br/>
limits.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to suggest was something my sister recently discovered.  She<br/>
has a very aggressive 4 yo, who has been that way since he became mobile.<br/>
She had twins shortly after his 2nd b-day and his aggression and frustration<br/>
really accellerated after that.  She found herself yelling and &quot;going off&quot;<br/>
on the kids a lot, and decided to try a naturopath.  She put her on some<br/>
liver cleansing herbs, and within a couple of weeks, my sister could not get<br/>
over how much less angry and like a &quot;time bomb&quot; she felt.  She felt able to<br/>
remain in control of her emotions even when the kids were falling apart.<br/>
After a couple of months of this, she put the 4 yo on the liver herbs and<br/>
found that his aggression greatly diminished and he was so much more mellow,<br/>
less jealous of the twins, and loving toward her (my sister).  It&#39;s like the<br/>
toxins were just not being efficiently purged by his liver, and the result<br/>
was all this anger and aggression.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if that helps, but may be worth checking into.  I am hoping to<br/>
check into this for myself after I have my baby, as I have &quot;rage&quot; tendencies<br/>
as well.<br/>

I know you have read Naomi. This articles, her book, and counseling has helped me a lot ( and still working on it!) when my ds is frustrated playing his video games and lashes out at me screaming that he wants to kill me or for me to kill myself ( he will be five end of June).<br/>
He is a very loving  kid but thsi used to drive me crazy and make me explode.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774357871">I don&#39;t have a lot of advice to give.  But something that helped me <br/>
feel better in the midst of a lot of turbulence at home was the <br/>
book &quot;Loving What Is&quot; by Byron Katie.  It&#39;s actually what a lot of <br/>
Naomi Aldort&#39;s parenting advice is based on.  I was able to do <br/>
written &quot;therapy&quot; about my own thinking about my kids.  Although not <br/>
the same situation, it had a lot to do with my oldest ds&#39;s rage and <br/>
my younger ds&#39;s provocation of that rage.<br/>
<br/>
I know this won&#39;t directly affect your son&#39;s rage.  But coming to a <br/>
peaceful place in your mind - that is, dealing with your own stress <br/>
about it - in the middle of the chaos can help you more clearly see <br/>
what you need to do for him.<br/>
<br/>
My ds and I have had many talks about anger.  He feels so helpless <br/>
to control his anger when he gets worked up to a rage.  He feels out <br/>
of control.  But he feels like he should be able to control himself -<br/>
 so he is conflicted and frustrated with himself.  And he even feels <br/>
like he is a bad person because of it.  I have pieced this together <br/>
from several little conversations with him about it because he does <br/>
not like to talk about it.  Last summer he broke our sliding glass <br/>
door with his heel in a fit of anger.  It was after that that I <br/>
started working on my own stress and anger and fears - writing it <br/>
all down.  I can&#39;t say that this one thing fixed the problem.  And <br/>
ds still gets extremely angry in certain situations.  But it is no <br/>
longer a daily event.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you are able to find a way to work through this.  I just <br/>
can&#39;t imagine how TOs and other means of controling would make <br/>
things better -- especially if you have already made the switch from <br/>
TOs to nonmanipulative parenting.  Every time my 8yo is angry with <br/>
his brother, it&#39;s because he thinks he should be able to control <br/>
him.  And I think it is a direct result of me trying to control him <br/>
for the first 6 years of his life.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Rachel<br/>

level worrying about the rages probably isn&#39;t helping!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting insight.  My son really doesn&#39;t talk about it at<br/>
all, but I do wonder at this point how much his rages are connected to<br/>
the fact that he already feels bad about himself for not being able to<br/>
control his anger.<br/>

I&#39;d hold them in my lap) for about 6 weeks last summer.  I&#39;d always<br/>
been opposed to them, but I finally got so desperate I decided I had<br/>
to at least try the conventional route.  The closest I&#39;d done before<br/>
was when he was littler if he would hit (which was rare before<br/>
5.5years), I would pick him up and remove him and talk about<br/>
alternatives he could do next time instead of hitting.<br/>

innate in wanting to control others just as we like to control the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818763706">Hi Katherine,<br/>
Just wanted to give hugs for tomorrow. I know a lot where you are coming from, Josh has <br/>
in the past been very violent, which was a shock coming from a child who always appeared <br/>
to be very calm and quiet. I would say that we&#39;re very lucky to have the psychologist that <br/>
we do. She diagnosed Breanna originally and when Josh was having so many problems, we <br/>
asked her for help as well. She has been very supportive of us homeschooling, and then <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that you do want his behavior to change (in reference to behavioral <br/>
modification) , and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Hurting people verbally or physically <br/>
is not okay. What you don&#39;t want is to use a source of power, positive (bribes) or negative  <br/>
(punishments) to do so. Josh has come a long way with our therapist doing this, and the <br/>
problem we had originally was looking at the source. In the end that isn&#39;t  the end-all <br/>
answer. It&#39;s helpful to know, yes, it was good for us to know that Josh has an actual wiring <br/>
problem in his brain, and it was helpful for OUR processing of the situation, but it didn&#39;t <br/>
change him one bit. What did help was Dr M being able to give him the babysteps that he <br/>
needed to succeed. We couldn&#39;t just say, you can&#39;t abuse people. We started with, when <br/>
you feel the urge to choke your sister come find me right away. We stayed very close, we <br/>
found alternatives, we changed our lifestyle to make it easier for him to make the safer <br/>
choices. We added a lot of supports. He has a visual wall chart of options. He has my very <br/>
close attention. he has a promise from me that BEFORE there is a struggle that I will drop <br/>
everthing to help him regain control. <br/>
<br/>
It helps that Josh has his OWN time. I was concerned when you said that you chose to take <br/>
the whole family. It might be better to work on the emergency issues right now, some <br/>
specific supports for him and let the 7yo have personal time to work on issues. Especially <br/>
since the other kids don&#39;t want to go, and he doesn&#39;t want to go, it might be easier to <br/>
compromise with him (This is really important for me that we do together, what can I do to <br/>
make this okay for you?) Just having time alone with mom may make it a better deal. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck tomorrow. Remember that you aren&#39;t a &#39;patient&#39; you are a consumer. You have <br/>
the right to say, I don&#39;t want this, I&#39;d like that. Can you do that or would you rather refer us <br/>
to another person?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455143316">Thanks, Melissa, that was truly very helpful.  Actually, I&#39;ve printed<br/>
it out and I&#39;m taking it with me in case I need help explaining what I<br/>
want!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking the whole family because I want her to at least meet<br/>
everyone and see what the mix is like.  I&#39;m increasingly realizing<br/>
that while 7yo&#39;s anger is mostly directed toward 4yo, it&#39;s often<br/>
(usually?) triggered by 11yo who is extremely energetic and impulsive.<br/>
 Maybe later I&#39;ll end up taking each of them alternately.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know.  I also want her to meet dh and we have no-one to babysit for us.<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, I also thought your post on unschooling on a budget/large<br/>
family/close spacing was great.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806010181">There is a non cohersive, gentle treatment that is<br/>
truly awesome.It is called EFT (emotional freedom<br/>
technique) It works for so many things and you can<br/>
learn to do it yourself for FREE! Please look at Gary<br/>
Criag&#39;s website called :www.emofree.com<br/>
Here is an excerpt from the child sub site on how a<br/>
child was shown EFT and how it worked for him for his<br/>
rage. It was at his school...but would be even easier<br/>
in a home setting. The &quot;tapping&quot; refers to the actual<br/>
treatment which consists of tapping on certain energy<br/>
meridians while stating things verbally. It seems like<br/>
it cannot work...BUT IT DOES. I have used it for so<br/>
many things it is unbelievable! Please read:<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Ann Adams shares with us this touching story of<br/>
&quot;Brandon.&quot; Copy this one. It is ideal to give to<br/>
parents and teachers that must deal with &quot;unruly<br/>
children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Gary<br/>
<br/>
P.S. A thank you to Shari Snow whose work made this<br/>
story possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Ann Adams<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes our very best teachers are the children. The<br/>
following story is certainly one of those a little<br/>
child shall lead them varieties. This seven year old<br/>
not only proselytizes for tapping but has also written<br/>
his own testimonial. My thanks go to Shari Snow who<br/>
currently volunteers in a school setting in Lexington,<br/>
NC, for sharing her work with &#39;Brandon&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The first day Shari met Brandon she was told he was<br/>
headed for a self contained class for students with<br/>
emotional/behavioral problems. Brandon had experience<br/>
difficulty since the day he entered school 2.5 years<br/>
ago. He was considered &quot;at-risk&quot; before entering<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
During the current school year there had not been a<br/>
day that he had not been sent to the principals<br/>
office. This day he had just trashed his classroom and<br/>
was working on trashing the principals office in<br/>
anger. He continued to throw things as Shari talked to<br/>
him about why he was so mad. When he realized she got<br/>
it, and stopped a moment to breathe, Shari stretched<br/>
out her hands and asked him to show how angry he was<br/>
with his hands. He stretched them out as far as he<br/>
could (indicating maximum anger). [Anns Note: Without<br/>
good rapport you get nowhere. The child must see you<br/>
as different from the other lecturing adults in his or<br/>
her environment.]<br/>
<br/>
Shari sat down on the floor in the office and said,<br/>
This looks really silly but just do what I am doing.<br/>
Brandon stopped the tantrum, sat down, and began to<br/>
follow the tapping. She tapped with him one round<br/>
before adding a set up statement for the second round:<br/>
&quot;Even though I am really mad and nobody will listen to<br/>
me, I am still a really good kid who people should<br/>
listen to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two rounds later, when asked how angry he was, Brandon<br/>
put his hands together (indicating little or no<br/>
anger). The school counselor watching this<br/>
transformation could not believe it. She described it<br/>
as &quot;watching the anger melt away&quot;. Brandon and Shari<br/>
talked some more about the issue that caused the<br/>
outburst and then, together, they made a plan for the<br/>
future. When it was time for Brandon to return to<br/>
class, he asked, Can I tap at home when I get mad<br/>
too? This child understood the power of this process<br/>
in 5 minutes! He got it quickly and made it a part<br/>
of his life.<br/>
<br/>
Shari writes: Brandon is now a seven year old<br/>
ambassador of energy therapies. He is tapping on his<br/>
own and is showing classmates how to tap. He has<br/>
people around him interested and looking for more<br/>
information. He is teaching me lessons on how to get<br/>
the message across. He has opened doors I did not<br/>
expect to open in the conservative rural community I<br/>
live in. This little guy deserves ALL OF THE CREDIT.<br/>
Me? I got lucky - what a wonderful teacher to learn<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
Brandon has not been back to the principals office.<br/>
Several weeks after the first tapping experience<br/>
Brandon told Shari he was ready to tell the story for<br/>
my friends. In the words of a seven year old, here is<br/>
Brandons version of using energy therapies.<br/>
<br/>
THE TAPPING STUFF<br/>
<br/>
By Brandon (as told to Ms. S)<br/>
<br/>
It makes the bad stuff not hurt as much.<br/>
<br/>
They look at me funny. But now they know why I do it.<br/>
<br/>
My friend got over his dog dying by tapping.<br/>
<br/>
I showed him how to help his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He told his mom to do it and she thought it was<br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I told him to do it anyways, just not let her see it.<br/>
<br/>
He made his hands get smaller when Ms. S helped him<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Lin (the counselor) reminds me to tap when I am<br/>
mad.<br/>
<br/>
I can tap in my classroom or ask to go see Ms. Lin.<br/>
<br/>
I am teaching Ms. Lin how to tap.<br/>
<br/>
She likes to tap by her nose. I like my forehead.<br/>
<br/>
I like school now because I am good.<br/>
<br/>
I got a treat from the principal for being good.<br/>
<br/>
I never did that before.<br/>
<br/>
My teachers did not like me because I was bad.<br/>
<br/>
I think my teacher likes me now that I am good.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is enough.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah I do the tapping at home when Nanna yells at<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Shari writes that In six weeks time, this child can<br/>
say  I like school now because I am good! His teacher<br/>
insists that it is a miracle  I insist it is a very<br/>
powerful message in the worth of all souls <br/>
regardless.<br/>
<br/>
Great work Shari! And hugs to all the Brandon&#39;s of the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
