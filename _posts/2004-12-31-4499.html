<div id="ygrps-yiv-587420684">&quot;Well, to the first part, you live in Florida!! You don&#39;t have to <br/>
test if you don&#39;t want to....and why would an unschooler want to <br/>
compare their children to other children on pointless topics if they <br/>
don&#39;t have to?:)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you don&#39;t have to test but don&#39;t you have to do <br/>
some sort of yearly review? I have just started to homeschool this <br/>
year and don&#39;t have any true unschoolers in my local that I&#39;m aware <br/>
of. My concern is that the reviewer&#39;s expectations of my son will be <br/>
different than mine. Is there any pro unschool reviewer list out <br/>
there? This is my first post but I&#39;ve been reading for awhile and <br/>
love it. Thanks. <br/>

And I bet he had plenty of schooling.<br/>
If you&#39;re bringing parts of that same system home, how is it going <br/>
to help? Schooling doesn&#39;t teach people. Interest does.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that your dh&#39;s strengths and talents are in areas <br/>
where he can ignore those subjects to a degree. He can creatively <br/>
learn ways to compensate now and if he&#39;d been honored for exactly <br/>
what he was GOOD at, rather than focus on his weaknesses, I bet he&#39;d <br/>
be a different person today.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the only way to truly honor the individual for who <br/>
they are, not who anyone else thinks they should be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483094334">I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and seriously considering unschooling. <br/>
My main question is, what do you write in your daily or weekly log (if <br/>

subjects and aren&#39;t there some weeks when you can&#39;t think of anything <br/>

   I was a school teacher so not having workbooks is kind of freaking <br/>
me out, but we have been trying it out for the past two weeks, and my 9 <br/>

I can get my husband to understand that all this lack of paper evidence <br/>

Hi Gen!<br/>
 <br/>
My state requires a daily log.  Currently, I use the Homeschool  Tracker <br/>
download.  It looks professional and I really don&#39;t have to fill in  much <br/>
information.  It depends on your state, but my state law is very vague  and I take <br/>
advantage of that.<br/>
 <br/>
There are some people here that are great at &quot;education-ese&quot; and can make  <br/>
anything sound like it came from a university lesson planner!  I just look  at <br/>
the subjects my state requires and see what we did that day that fits the  <br/>
criteria.<br/>
 <br/>
For example, yesterday my kids played with caterpillars, fixed a bike chain  <br/>
that keeps breaking, played a dinosaur board game, watched PBS, watched a  <br/>
neighbor build a fence and played restaurant.  I don&#39;t usually do this  type of <br/>
breakdown, but to illustrate how I translate their day to subjects I&#39;ll  be <br/>
more thorough.  So, Science is easy.....caterpillar study, simple  machinery, <br/>
dinosaur study, Zooboomafoo, physical structures and nutrition.  <br/>
 <br/>
Math:  comparison and estimation (differences in caterpillars, how  many they <br/>
found yesterday vs. today, etc.); probability (when will the bike  chain come <br/>
off again), board game: counting, planning, more/less; PBS:  watched <br/>
Cyberchase; fence: geometry; restaurant: estimation.<br/>
 <br/>
Social Studies: bike chain: the value of helping each other; board game:  <br/>
personal interaction, helping out someone who is behind, winning/losing, board  <br/>
game ethics/rules, game also had dinosaur fights with winners and losers based  <br/>
on criteria like strength, habitat, intelligence;  PBS: watched social  <br/>
situations on Arthur, Barney, Sagwa; fence: good neighbors, why do people have  <br/>
fences, other family interactions (they were building the fence together),  <br/>
neighbor&#39;s reactions to the fence; restaurant: duplicating social  activity.<br/>
 <br/>
Once you start investigating, you can see that everyday activities often  <br/>
cover nearly every school subject.  How can you live a single day without  social <br/>
studies?  Without science or math?  Sometimes you have to get  creative to <br/>
turn it into school language.  Every day my kids ask what the  weather will be <br/>
so they know what to wear......that&#39;s science!  I don&#39;t  know about you, but I <br/>
remember studying weather in school, it was nothing like  the real thing!  <br/>
LOL! <br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

watched an Alfred Hitchcock marathon, whatever. Don&#39;t even think <br/>
about &quot;what subject is this?&quot; or &quot;what did they learn this week?&quot; <br/>
Just write down everything - almost like a food log for dieters. As <br/>
best as possible, do it out of sight of the kids for the most part. <br/>
Use notes on the calendar to remind you &quot;oh yeah, yesterday we went <br/>
to the park and ....&quot; Then, once a month maybe or whatever, go back <br/>
and look at it - odds are there&#39;s learning all through it (playing <br/>
catch is all about physics so it&#39;s phys ed AND science). Remember: <br/>
learning does not usually look like school. I know of some folks who <br/>
have a 5 subject type notebook and they jot down things they&#39;ve done <br/>
in each subject area, and usually one thing fits multiple places.<br/>
<br/>
As far as legal stuff, really check into the laws and see if your <br/>
state actually requires you to keep a daily/weekly log of learning. <br/>
And, who sees that log? Many states require a portfolio at the end <br/>
of the year. Some require quarterly narratives. HOW you satisfy <br/>
those requirements, though, is up to you. Some folks scrapbook. Some <br/>
folks have big bins or accordion type folders to drop pictures, <br/>
ticket stubs, etc into. And so on. <br/>

under option 1, as I read it in the law, you have to present a system <br/>
of maintaining records as evidence of regular instruction including <br/>
some record of subjects taught, a portfolio, and a record of <br/>
evaluations, with semiannual progress reports to be submitted. If what <br/>
you&#39;re doing works for you, that&#39;s great (and sounds pretty easy too <br/>
which is a bonus). But, there is no legal requirement to have a daily <br/>
log.<br/>

There are 2 options in FL (in summary): you can jump a lot of hoops <br/>
and home school directly in contact with your school district <br/>
(recordkeeping, evaluations, etc) <br/>
OR <br/>
you can register with an &#39;umbrella&#39; group such as:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index_files/Page1087.htm">http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index_files/Page1087.htm</a> - <br/>
you register with them ($15 first year, $10 thereafter) and send <br/>
in &#39;attendance&#39; records on a regular basis (&quot;hey kids you here?&quot;) <br/>
and that&#39;s it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have a long way to go as I do catch myself <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When DH was 4ish he taught himself to read (by working through books <br/>
he knew by heart and matching the sounds to the print). MIL called <br/>
the school he would be attending and asked for ideas on how to help <br/>
him continue developing this. They told her NOT to &#39;let&#39; him read <br/>
because he&#39;d learn it &#39;wrong&#39;. She ignored them (thankfully).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t stick to it until it is &quot;learned&quot;.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning, like life, is cyclical. Something sprouts, blossoms, <br/>
fades, and goes underground for a bit then comes back up. Or, <br/>
another analogy, it&#39;s like eating - you don&#39;t keep eating until <br/>
you&#39;ve had every type of zucchini available. You eat a bit, digest, <br/>
eat more - maybe same kind, maybe different, digest, eat a bit more <br/>
and so on. You may never know every kind of zucchini but you&#39;ll have <br/>
tried all that you want/need to have. Those digesting times are <br/>
critical - that&#39;s when food becomes part of us. Without digesting, <br/>
we just pile in bite upon bite and regurgitate occasionally which <br/>
clears out the space for more bites but what goes out hasn&#39;t really <br/>
been assimilated.<br/>

&gt; I am brand new to the idea of homeschooling and am really interested<br/>
&gt; in learning more about unschooling.  My daughter turned 3 last week<br/>
&gt; and my son is due in early May.  I know that I don&#39;t want either in<br/>
&gt; public school.  I have tons of questions.  This post brought up one<br/>
&gt; for me.  How do I go about finding out the legal requirements of my<br/>

homeschool.  One (which most people do) is to send a letter of intent to<br/>
your school district and have your child evaluated by a certified (I love<br/>
that word) teacher each year.  Another (which I use) is to enroll my child<br/>
in a private cover school (there are several good ones) and send them your<br/>
attendance once a year.  (Not advocating this) there are many families who<br/>
do neither and just stay under the radar.<br/>
