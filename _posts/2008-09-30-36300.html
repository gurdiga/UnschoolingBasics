<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064964760">He&#39;s just turned 4. He&#39;s all boy and then some - dressing up in fairy<br/>
clothes and earrings, driving his dump truck through mud puddles, etc.<br/>
Typical four year old. He also wants everything he sees, NOW.<br/>
<br/>
He wants me to play a game with him, but when he sees something else,<br/>
to do that with him. He wants to watch a certain movie, but then sees<br/>
another one he wants to watch instead (which by now his sister is into<br/>
the first movie.) He wants every toy in the store aisle or thrift shop<br/>
NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I have to love his enthusiasm, as it mirrors my own! I often want lots<br/>
of things NOW, too. But unlike me, he doesn&#39;t always get that some<br/>
things have to wait, or that his turn will come (that&#39;s another thing<br/>
- he wants to have a turn at everything first, and cries when I<br/>
suggest that his sister gets a first try.)<br/>
<br/>
I actually don&#39;t have negative feelings toward him for doing this, as<br/>
opposed to friends who say they don&#39;t understand their children, but<br/>
at the same time, I&#39;m not sure how to respond in a positive way to<br/>
him. I know much of what he&#39;s going through is a phase and as he grows<br/>
and matures and gains more control over his world (as in getting<br/>
taller and stronger and more coordinated) he&#39;ll feel less at the short<br/>
end of the stick.<br/>
<br/>
But until then, what are some ways I can help make him feel important,<br/>
without letting everyone else&#39;s needs go unchecked? (I have a 6 year<br/>
old and two 15 month old twins, as well.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202954071">I had a suggestion about the TV.  You could get a small extra one (freecycle<br/>
from people who are changing up to big screens or yard sales.. just make<br/>
sure it has the sockets for video/sound) and these days everything&#39;s made in<br/>
China and cheap so that it&#39;s possible to get a DVD/VCP/CD player for about<br/>
$40.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think rather than focusing on finding a fix for his emotions,  <br/>
accept them as who he is right now. Offer sympathy.<br/>
<br/>
Even as adults our feelings aren&#39;t always reasonable. But if someone  <br/>
treats us as though reasonable thoughts should stop the feelings, it  <br/>
can just make us mad on top of what else we&#39;re feeling.<br/>
<br/>
You could try imagining what life would have been like if things had  <br/>
gone his way, or just in general playing around with the idea of  <br/>
getting everything you want immediately and how fun that might be.  <br/>
Often what we want is someone to just acknowledge that our feelings  <br/>
are understandable, not necessarily agree that we&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
I think too often mom&#39;s can get into the trap of being the fix-its of  <br/>
the world and we can feel like failures if our kids are unhappy.  <br/>
Unhappiness is a big alarm bell and should alert us when we and our  <br/>
(bullheaded) view of the world might be the cause of the upset. But  <br/>
sometimes life just sucks and the best thing is having a sympathetic  <br/>
ear to listen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How did you learn to be okay waiting? What sorts of things allow you <br/>
to access more of your own patience? Let him know that *you* <br/>
understand that waiting is hard. Is there a way to make it easier? <br/>
Sometimes there is. Help him look for options when Right Now isn&#39;t <br/>
going to happen for five eternally long minutes. Can you distract <br/>
him? Play two games at once? Can he play two different players in <br/>
the game so he gets more turns?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is important - what can you do to help him have more control <br/>
over his world right now? I know you have twin babies, so that&#39;s <br/>
going to make things challenging in terms of &quot;kid proofing&quot;, but <br/>
look for ways to make size and strength and coordination less of an <br/>
issue in terms of your guy getting his needs met. <br/>
