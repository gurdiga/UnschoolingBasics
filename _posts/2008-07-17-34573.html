<div id="ygrps-yiv-662189591">We had a local Spiral Scouts troop for a while and my girls loved it,  <br/>
but the energy fell off after 2 years because there weren&#39;t enough  <br/>
parent volunteers and the lack of an established structure. I have  <br/>
been thinking about just setting up a hearth (you can read about that  <br/>
option on their website), but unfortunately that doesn&#39;t address the  <br/>
need to be with other kids outside of our family.<br/>
