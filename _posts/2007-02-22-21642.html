<div id="ygrps-yiv-445827889">We have definitely been struggling with hitting in our family too, mostly on the part of my 7yo, and I understand this concern.  (I have 3 boys also, 10, 7, and 4.)  What I&#39;ve found most helpful is letting them know that I am there to help them communicate more effectively.  To say, &quot;You seem really frustrated because you want to play with that toy (or whatever I sense the issue is).  Let&#39;s see if we can solve this problem.&quot;  And then to talk through the problem with them.  Oh, and also to *be there* -- present, in the midst of whatever&#39;s going on so that I can step in between (if possible, sometimes he&#39;s too fast and I don&#39;t see it coming) before the hitting happens.<br/>
<br/>
The aggression has gotten better.  Of course, I want it to stop once and for all, but I can see it&#39;s improving.  But punishment doesn&#39;t really do that either.  They really need us to teach them, model for them, alternatives to hitting.  It takes a long time, and a lot of help, for some children to learn how to &quot;use your words&quot;.<br/>

Fear of what?  Each other? Hitting?  Losing the TV?  I&#39;m confused... what do<br/>
you want them to be fearful of?<br/>
<br/>
Taking the tv away won&#39;t instill fear either .  It will probably just make<br/>
them resent the one who hit and got the tv taken away even more.<br/>

understanding to be enough.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever known that you shouldn&#39;t do something: another cookie,  <br/>
staying up another hour, reading just a few more emails .... and yet  <br/>
you did it anyway? How long have you been on the planet, practicing  <br/>
those skills? And yet you&#39;re expecting perfect control of emotions  <br/>
and reactions from young beings who have only been here a few short  <br/>
years?<br/>
<br/>
Their actions are showing you that they still need your help solving  <br/>
problems. You need to be there for them, not expecting them to  <br/>
control their emotions, not expecting them to work it out themselves.<br/>
<br/>
By giving them information, you&#39;re expecting to be able to hand over  <br/>
responsibility of peaceful relationships to them. And they&#39;re failing  <br/>
at it. And it&#39;s frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Expectations are probably the ruin of more relationships than money!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a rule, but it should be a red flag that when we have  <br/>
expectations of someone else&#39;s behavior and they fail, we should  <br/>
examine our own behavior and why we&#39;ve set up those expectations.  <br/>
It&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s the expectations that are at the root of  <br/>
the unpleasant atmosphere than what someone did or didn&#39;t do.<br/>

each other? Some kids are pretty rough and use hitting as a way of <br/>
problem solving - that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing if both the <br/>
kids are okay with hitting as a solution. <br/>
<br/>
My 5yo&#39;s best pal is a year older than she is. Both girls are very <br/>
energetic and sometimes they choose to solve their differences in <br/>
very direct, physical ways - hitting, grabbing, etc. They also play <br/>
somewhat violent games consensually. Over time the other mom and I <br/>
have developed strategies with the girls for how and when *we* <br/>
should step in - its not intuitively obvious to us grown-ups. They <br/>
don&#39;t always *want* our help. So we&#39;ve all had to learn how to <br/>
communicate around this issue. <br/>
<br/>
Neither one of them plays in quite the same way with other kids. <br/>
They both tend to solicit rough play, but with kids they don&#39;t know <br/>
they are both also much more likely to attempt a peaceful solution <br/>
to a problem *first*. That&#39;s interesting and pretty reassuring to <br/>
me. Its not a case of them lacking better skills.<br/>

Oh, I don&#39;t mind them being physical.  What gets to me is that when the two younger get hit they come wining and crying to me or daddy.  After a discussion with the two children involved and a little hugging they go off and play again.  My middle child cries the same intensity to being wacked and not getting his way with his brothers.  <br/>

We talk it through, we talk about what is happening, we think of alternatives, we have done consequenses (finding here that is a BIG no-no).  I have alway let them deal with it on their own.  When they come to me is when in interject, or big screams are heard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43859191">When my kids come to &quot;tattle&quot; on someone else, I ask them, &quot;Why are<br/>
you telling *me*?  I didn&#39;t hit you.  If L hit you and you didn&#39;t like<br/>
it, tell him that you don&#39;t like it and ask him to stop.&quot;  When we<br/>
first started this method, I would even model the sentence &quot;L, I don&#39;t<br/>
like it when you hit me. (or it hurts when you hit me)  Please stop,&quot;<br/>
so they got the idea but they can do it themselves now.  (Of course,<br/>
they know if this doesn&#39;t work that they can come to me but I do ask<br/>
them to try to do it themselves first.)  This has done several things<br/>
for us:<br/>
1. They realize that Mom isn&#39;t the arbitrator and they can work things<br/>
out for themselves.  This helps because when you take away the mom<br/>
power of &quot;I&#39;m gonna tell her and get YOU in trouble!&quot;, it really<br/>
changes the dynamics.<br/>
2. The whining and crying is very minimal now (well, except for my<br/>
almost 2yr old...lol) and usually restricted to when they&#39;re REALLY hurt.<br/>
3. I&#39;ve even seen one accidentally hit the other, run to the freezer<br/>
and get an ice pack (that stays on for all of 10 seconds at best) and<br/>
apologize right away.  A simple &quot;I&#39;m sorry, are you ok?&quot; goes SUCH a<br/>
longer way for kids than some adults I know.  ;)<br/>
4. It really gives them a sense of power - and not in a bad way but<br/>
think about it...when adults allow kids to tattle, those kids feel<br/>
powerless to fix the problem themselves and always bring in a 3rd<br/>
party.  If we encourage them to stand up for themselves at a young age<br/>
with a safe subject (siblings), I feel they&#39;ll be much better prepared<br/>
for life.  I see my kids handling situations like this with their<br/>
friends and cousins already and it&#39;s nice to see.  I never felt I<br/>
could use my voice as a child and I&#39;m glad they haven&#39;t had the same<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really refreshing to see my 3(*just* 4 now) and 6yr old get along<br/>
so well.  I&#39;m sure some unschoolers would disagree with our method but<br/>
it&#39;s what works for us.  And more importantly than following<br/>
&quot;unschooling rules&quot; (LOL what a contradiction in terms!!) is finding<br/>
what works for your family.  <br/>

<br/>
Mom SHOULD be the arbitrator though. Kids NEED an adult that is<br/>
present and willing to be a facilitator for their difficult moments no<br/>
matter what. They don&#39;t have the skills to always work things out in a<br/>
peaceful  or respectful manner.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have me as an arbitrator at all times. This doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>
step in instantly, but if there is anything harmful going on I am<br/>
right there. I don&#39;t wait for it to become painful to arbitrate for<br/>
them either. <br/>
<br/>
Arbitrating doesn&#39;t mean anyone is in trouble here. It means an adult<br/>
is between two opposing parties helping them communicate and solve<br/>
problems calmly. My kids don&#39;t come &quot;tattle&quot; because we don&#39;t use<br/>
punishment as a tool (nor do I see it as a negative thing when they<br/>
give me information about a sibling)...but they DO tell me things that<br/>
are going on because they know I&#39;ll help them.<br/>

There are no unschooling rules. But there is an underlying philosophy<br/>
of respect that we are here to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
What works for some families is hitting, shaming and<br/>
punishing....we&#39;re not here to support &quot;whatever works for your<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Just to clarify. Consequences are NOT a big no-no here. Punishment IS.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding the difference between the two could be a HUGE step in <br/>
understanding the principles and philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Consequences happen naturally. You don&#39;t need to &quot;set up&quot; or <br/>
&quot;establish&quot; consequences. They happen whether you plan them or not. If <br/>
you go out to play in the rain, you get wet (unless you bring an <br/>
umbrella or raincoat).<br/>
<br/>
Punishments, on the other hand, are parent-imposed and have nothing at <br/>
all to do with the situation in the first place. If you go out to play <br/>
in the rain, you don&#39;t get to watch tv tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Children understand and appreciate consequences. They just resent <br/>
punishment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843202091">Gee Ren, did I strike a nerve?  Someone asked a question and I<br/>
answered.  You had the opportunity to add your opinion and yet felt<br/>
the need to send THREE posts to the entire group dogging my opinion<br/>
instead?  <br/>
<br/>
I will say that I DID state that my kids are very welcome to come to<br/>
me if they cannot resolve the issue between them (or if they choose<br/>
not to and they have never complained or stated that this is not<br/>
working for them.  In fact, they have had great success with it). <br/>
Again, this is what works for US in our &#39;unschooling<br/>
environment&#39;...letting them think for themselves, giving them their<br/>
own voices, letting them be heard by siblings and adults alike.  I<br/>
believe I am respecting my children by letting them &quot;peacefully and<br/>
joyfully&quot; deal with their own issues and by serving as their back-up<br/>
when needed.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve seen board issues erupt from posts such as these, I won&#39;t<br/>
be responding further.<br/>

they need help working out solutions and/or communicating. Kids <br/>

them if you are doing all of these things. That leaves them focussed <br/>
on the penalty, rather than the wonderful problem-solving.<br/>

myself - got one in the kitchen right now, making me dinner ;) Your <br/>
guy may need some help communicating his needs *and* some validation <br/>
that its okay to be sad and dissapointed. If he has that validation, <br/>
he&#39;ll likely not feel compelled to hit someone when he doesn&#39;t get <br/>
his way. He can have a bit of a cry and go back to the fun. Learning <br/>
to manage difficult emotions can take years - plenty of adult men <br/>
don&#39;t seem to have figured it out, so helping yours now will go a <br/>
long way to one man&#39;s future happiness. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232717406">And some kids don&#39;t know how to stop when told to stop.<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking about this with my 10yo yesterday.  He thinks he&#39;s playing with a younger brother and the younger will scream because it hurts or is scary.  I&#39;ll step in and say, &quot;Stop.  He&#39;s telling you to stop.  That hurts.&quot;  He&#39;ll reply, &quot;No, he wasn&#39;t saying, &#39;stop&#39;.&quot;  (He&#39;s *very* literal.)  It often will take my physically interfering to stop the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I talked with him and broke it down into 3 pieces to try and figure out where the difficulty was.  (1) Did he understand that it was important to stop when someone said stop/that they were being hurt and we needed to treat them the way we want to be treated?   (2) Did he, in the moment, not understand that their screaming or groaning meant &quot;stop&quot;?   (3) Was he unable to physically stop even though he understood #1 and #2?   He said he thought it was #3.  Good in that  at least he&#39;s gotten through the first couple steps, but not so good in that the other 2 seem easier to teach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974380213">I think my concern with the way this is worded is that it seems that it doesn&#39;t allow for <br/>
empathy. Tattling has such a negative connotation, and basically it seems that for some <br/>
people, &#39;tattling&#39; should lead to an adult coming in and mandating a solution. To say &quot;Why <br/>
are you telling me?&quot; in my house would mean basically &quot;So...I don&#39;t care, I didn&#39;t do it&quot;. So <br/>
when a child comes to me and says, &quot;So n so hit me&quot;, I&#39;ll say something compassionate <br/>
first, like &quot;Wow, I&#39;ll bet that did not feel good!&quot; and leave the conversation open. If the child <br/>
is capable of going further, and needing more, it usually follows with &quot;Yeah, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
like it,&quot; to which I could reply, &quot;So, what can I do to help,&quot; Or &quot;What&#39;s your plan?&quot; If they <br/>
don&#39;t know, then I could offer solutions and again, more empathy. Sometimes all they <br/>
need is some hugging, and they can think through what really happened, their role in it, <br/>
and find some better solutions. It really depends on the child, each of them have different <br/>
skill levels with conflict management.<br/>

<br/>
Just putting this out there into the mix FWIW - whenever DS (8 1/2) has<br/>
been in a situation where he was unable to stop, it often ties back to<br/>
his being beyond hungry and needing some protein. Back a few years ago<br/>
(3 or 4 now), he was doing something (poking me or something similar)<br/>
that was annoying and becoming painful (poking the same spot over and<br/>
over and over again eventually hurts). I asked him to stop, all the<br/>
usual stuff. He didn&#39;t. He said &quot;My brain won&#39;t let me stop&quot; Ah-ha Ding!<br/>
(see the light bulb? lol) Connection made: it was several hours since he<br/>
had eaten something. I offered a PBJ - he accepted. Behavior smoothed<br/>
out after the sandwich. Tested hypothesis subsequently (not in a lab<br/>
experiment make him wait for food and see what happens way, just<br/>
observationally as circumstances arose). Pointed out the connection to<br/>
him in a non-tense moment &quot;I&#39;ve noticed that when you .... it seems to<br/>
happen more if you haven&#39;t eaten anything, especially protein, for a<br/>
while. Maybe we can work on keeping an eye on that and see if it helps<br/>
your brain help you stop ...&quot; In that, we proactively offered foods like<br/>
PBJ or ants on a log or whatever - some complex carbs and proteins - and<br/>
it did indeed help. <br/>
 <br/>
YMMV<br/>

together, so i need to leave the room.  because of my need/discomfort we&#39;ve <br/>
discussed it and they&#39;ve assured me that no body was hurt they were having <br/>

how to use the word when they want to stop something.  Without direct <br/>

problem at all...something entirely different may arise &lt;lol&gt;<br/>
<br/>
there are occasions when i have heard the word stop used and it&#39;s not being <br/>
responded to.  I will then  step in and simply state that i&#39;ve heard the <br/>
word stop.  Its not done in anger or judgement - just a helpful reminding <br/>
voice - kind of like oh hand me the ketchup please.  This reminder of what <br/>
was said may be all your older son needs (especially since your above <br/>
mentioned conversation) in order for him to hear and respond to the <br/>

Yikes!<br/>

unschooling challenges me to be a better mom every day. It would <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful that George is supportive of this process. <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t any more convenient for him than it is for me, but <br/>
he&#39;s still willing to stick his neck out and gently remind me of <br/>
what my principles are, what kind of person I want to be. He knows <br/>
that &quot;whatever works&quot; is not the answer I&#39;m looking for. <br/>

enjoying the wisdom of your &quot;human-beingness&quot; &lt;g&gt;.  Even veteran unschoolers <br/>
can find ourselves pulling our hair out and need to step back in order to <br/>
regain our higher self.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all your shares.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470977114">That&#39;s an interesting thought -- I&#39;ll have to watch.  I have been offering a lot more snacks -- especially protein (lots of nuts and seeds)  -- since reading about the monkey plates and protein a few weeks ago.  But I&#39;ll try to see if I see a pattern between and what he last ate.  My inclination is to think that he never stops (quickly, anyway) regardless of when/what he ate last, but I hope you&#39;re right!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Just putting this out there into the mix FWIW - whenever DS (8 1/2) has<br/>
<br/>
been in a situation where he was unable to stop, it often ties back to<br/>
<br/>
his being beyond hungry and needing some protein. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295510521">What kinds of solutions did you use with your younger child?  We have talked, repeatedly, about body language different ways people say stop.  And, per my discussion with him the other day, he says he does know that they mean stop, but he just can&#39;t... however, because he is so literal and doesn&#39;t pick up social cues well, I&#39;m not fully convinced.<br/>

I have a younger child that doesn&#39;t read other people well, so that&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
a whole different issue and needs other solutions. But my older<br/>
<br/>
children figured out that the person didn&#39;t need to say<br/>
<br/>
&quot;stop&quot;...... showing displeasure meant &quot;stop&quot; too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923650131">Yes, I agree. I often hear parents say &quot;this works for our family&quot;, <br/>
but if fact, it works for the parents, not the kids. (not saying the <br/>
person who originally posted meant that). I think sometimes those <br/>
parents feel if their children are compliant, it must be working. <br/>
Good post Meredith!<br/>
