<div id="ygrps-yiv-933390605">Great news! A place only 10 minutes from us  does a program for girls my <br/>
daughter&#39;s age. It is a  gymnastics school run by HOMESCHOOL MOMS!Their uniforms <br/>
are MODEST  yet adorable, the cheers are innocent and happy, and the moves are  <br/>
athletic and pretty, no gyrating or sexual gestures. They learn  cheer, <br/>
ballet, tumbling, gymnastics, poise and sportsmanship. She  starts this week! One <br/>
thing that they do on  occasion (that made me BURST into tears over) is cheer <br/>
for  SPECIAL OLYMPICS KIDS!!!!!!! These moms are angels sent from heaven.  I am <br/>
sooooo relived. I am going to loose sleep at night out of  excitement over <br/>
her first class!   <br/>
