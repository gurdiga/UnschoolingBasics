<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192701132">***there is danger of confusing it with any of<br/>
several poisonous plants, ***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true the flowers look similar and the first year leaves can look <br/>
similar but the tubers are<br/>
different and the smell is very different and in the second year the mature <br/>
plants are quite different in appearance and not so easy to confuse.<br/>
<br/>
The root of the wild carrot smells very carroty. Unmistakable.  The Water <br/>
Hemlock root looks different, has no carrot smell and when cut open is <br/>
segmented with hollow chambers.   The whole plant of the water hemlock <br/>
smells something like a muskrat. &lt;g&gt;   Both are members of the Parsley <br/>
family.<br/>
And I think I might rather eat the Hemlock than have another of those <br/>
terrible bitter carrots. &lt;g&gt;  Water Hemlock is the more common Hemlock in <br/>
the rocky Mountains, so I know that one pretty well.   Wild carrot isn&#39;t <br/>
common in Montana.<br/>
<br/>
There are other edible and inedible family members with similar flowers. <br/>
The root of the<br/>
Yampa is a little carrot like in flavor and sweet.  MUCH better tasting than <br/>
the wild carrot.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357483637">***I still remember the taste of carrots from my grandmother&#39;s garden,<br/>
freshly picked and washed off under the hose! Danielle loves to eat<br/>
cherry tomatoes and green beans right out of the garden. ***<br/>
<br/>
My dad and his brother owned a commercial greenhouse when I was little and I <br/>
used to sneak into the tomato house and hide under the benches and snarf <br/>
tomatoes.   I had those tiny, paper Morton salt shakers strategically <br/>
stashed for easy access.   Ah, sun warmed tomato!<br/>
<br/>
Dylan used to like to help me in the garden when he was little.  He <br/>
especially liked looking for Daddy Longlegs in the green beans.  He&#39;d pick <br/>
them up and sometimes they&#39;d get away from him and he&#39;d come up to me and <br/>
say, &quot;Mom, I have a longlegs problem,&quot; and I&#39;d get the silly thing off his <br/>
head and put it in his hand again. &lt;g&gt;  I have a picture of him crouching in <br/>
the beans looking for Long Legs.    You can hardly tell there&#39;s a kid in <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
***Oh, and I&#39;ll<br/>
never forget her excitement when she found her first tomato hornworm a<br/>
few years back! (they ARE kinda cute!)***<br/>
<br/>
I agree, they are cute. &lt;g&gt;  We like garden critters.  Even the ones no one <br/>
else likes.   But a Montana garden is fleeting thing anyway.  When the <br/>
growing season is only about three months long and I can count on at least <br/>
one hard frost during each of those months, it doesn&#39;t pay to fret over <br/>
whoever or whatever finds my little patch. &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a small garden but I <br/>
still manage to grow enough to share. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dylan and I had great fun in the garden.  We used to grow pole beans on <br/>
makeshift teepee frames and he&#39;d have little bean forts to play in.   We <br/>
built spider web frames for orb weaving spiders and put them around the <br/>
garden and checked every day to see who&#39;d taken up residence.   Dylan would <br/>
help me dig potatoes with his Tonka backhoe and then he&#39;d haul them in the <br/>
dump truck over to the tarp under the tree. &lt;g&gt;   We always had pretty <br/>
gardens because he liked to put flowers in the garden rows and paths.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
He still likes to garden.  He still likes to pick up any longlegs he comes <br/>
across.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
