&gt; We need a family!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The time has come for us to find the right family for the next step of our film andwe need your help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of you know that over the past year we�ve been focusing on interviews with individuals and families who are already homeschooling, including many who have shared valuable knowledge and wisdom from years of experience. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if you�ve read our synopsis, you�ll also know that a big part of our film is centered upon documenting a family who are just starting out; a family who are making the transition from public or private school into the world of alternative education.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We�d like to follow their journey and we believe that documenting their experiences will be an effective way for people in the general public to gain a real understanding of what it means to make the commitment to homeschool. There are a lot of preconceived notions within the general public about what homeschooling is, who does it and for what reasons. We hope that the average person watching the film will be able to relate to this family and by doing so, will have many of their questions answered. They may even be inspired to do the same thing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you know of someone who is considering pulling their kids out of school to homeschool them who might be interested in being involved in our film, please let them know about our film, or ask them if we can contact them. Or if you have recently started homeschooling or are considering doing so, please contact us directly by visiting our website and filling out this form:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/get-involved/family-filming-application/">http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/get-involved/family-filming-application/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jeremy, Dustin, Roy and the Class Dismissed Team.<br/>
