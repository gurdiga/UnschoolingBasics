<div id="ygrps-yiv-28992247">&quot;We&#39;re in the process of starting a Spiral <br/>
Scouts group and I&#39;m having second thoughts about it because of the <br/>
use <br/>
of badges/pins. To me it is an extrinsic motivator and I don&#39;t get why <br/>
the kids need to do the badges. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it has to be a big deal.<br/>
Earning badges might be a lot of fun for your children, your attitude <br/>
will make the difference between harmful rewards and just something <br/>
they enjoy.<br/>
YOU know that a reward isn&#39;t a good way to motivate someone...so you <br/>
aren&#39;t going to use them to force your children to do an activity they <br/>
don&#39;t care for! That&#39;s the key in my mind.<br/>
If you used the badge to try and make them finish activities, THEN the <br/>
reward could be harmful.<br/>
If you let your children pick and choose what they want to get out of <br/>
spiral scouts, if you don&#39;t make an issue of the badges one way or the <br/>
other, if you treat the badges as you would grades (something that <br/>
does not define a person, nor has any weight in your family) but <br/>
something fun they&#39;re choosing to do (just as they might choose school <br/>
one day) then I think it&#39;s all good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care for all the external motivators our society <br/>
uses....colored belts in martial arts for example (NOT a tradition <br/>
from Asia, but an American thing), but I don&#39;t think keeping our <br/>
children away from all of it is a good idea either.<br/>
Your children will know that the badges are just part of the <br/>
package...they can choose to earn them or NOT.<br/>
Let them get what they want from this experience and I think you could <br/>
all have a lot of fun with it. :)<br/>
