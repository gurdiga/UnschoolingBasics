<div id="ygrps-yiv-205142531">I don&#39;t know if you or your kids are interested, but I just wanted to share <br/>
out experience.<br/>
<br/>
This past Friday my daughter participated in a mock election with 178 <br/>
hs/unschool kids. She LOVED it. They started from scratch nominating <br/>
different people to run, debates, campaigning, and a final election. The had <br/>
three parties running, but no democrats or republicans. The idea was to try <br/>
and keep kids focused on the issues and not the party, so they gave <br/>
themselves names.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting to watch the debates. The kids in the audiences asked <br/>
such great questions. I was in the back of the room just to sneak a peek, <br/>
and I was so impressed that my daughter asked such intelligent questions. <br/>
And being kids, there were lots of funny questions. But that even made it <br/>
better to see how each candidate answered. And yes, the same issue that come <br/>
up in the presidential campaign came up here. The big ones were abortion, <br/>
stem cell research, and immigration, but the hottest debate was over the <br/>
legal driving age.<br/>
<br/>
The kids ranged in age 10 ish to 20. You had to be 12 to run, but my 9 year <br/>
old was heart broken that I didn&#39;t sign her up. She joined in the <br/>
campaigning some on her own. Next time we see this come up, she is set on <br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 and 16 year old daughters wanted to do this when we signed up, but <br/>
only the 13 year old actually decided to go. She was so worked up by the end <br/>
of the day that she said she thought she had to much caffeine in her system. <br/>
Funny thing is, she hadn&#39;t had caffeine. I mentioned this to her and she got <br/>
uncontrollable giggles. It was like she sleep deprived or something. But she <br/>
talked to me for one solid hour about all of it and then when we got home <br/>
her Dad heard a solid hour,  it was great to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>
