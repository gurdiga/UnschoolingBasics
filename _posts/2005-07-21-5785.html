  A response to the NEA&#39;s Article - Home Schools Run By Well-Meaning <br/>
Amateurs<br/>
<br/>
This article has been floating around various homeschool email groups <br/>
and I wanted to put in a few words on it.<br/>
<br/>
Excerpt:<br/>

    Home Schools Run By Well-Meaning Amateurs<br/>
    Schools With Good Teachers Are Best-Suited to Shape Young Minds<br/>
    By Dave Arnold<br/>
<br/>
     There&#39;s nothing like having the right person with the right <br/>
experience, skills and tools to accomplish a specific task. Certain <br/>
jobs are best left to the pros, such as, formal education.<br/>
<br/>
     There are few homeowners who can tackle every aspect of home <br/>
repair. A few of us might know carpentry, plumbing and, let?s say, <br/>
cementing. Others may know about electrical work, tiling and roofing. <br/>
But hardly anyone can do it all.<br/>
<br/>
     Same goes for cars. Not many people have the skills and knowledge <br/>
to perform all repairs on the family car. Even if they do, they <br/>
probably don?t own the proper tools. Heck, some people have their hands <br/>
full just knowing how to drive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is actually an old argument that pops up from time to time in <br/>
various forms. The most common one I heard is the &quot;Surgeon&quot; analogy. <br/>
You know - &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want an amateur performing surgery on your <br/>
child, so why would you want someone untrained molding his or her <br/>
minds?&quot; In every form it relies on false analogies that are easily <br/>
refuted. Usually, simply modifying the analogy to actually fit a school <br/>
situation is a very effective method of refuting it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the author started with the analogy of home repair, so <br/>
lets extend it to fit the situation.<br/>
<br/>
1. For the author&#39;s analogy on home repair to apply to school, first <br/>
the &quot;home repair expert&quot; should be repairing thirty houses at once. He <br/>
will do this not by applying individual attention to the needs of each <br/>
house, but by instructing the owners to perform each task in unison <br/>
themselves with his instruction.<br/>
<br/>
2. Each home repair will be conducted on every house whether the house <br/>
needs the repair or not. The owner will be punished for &quot;failing&quot; to <br/>
adhere to this. working ahead will be discouraged except possibly for a <br/>
selected few owners who will be allowed to have &quot;advanced home repair&quot; <br/>
for one hour a week.<br/>
<br/>
3. Each home repair will be conducted within the same time frame and <br/>
the next repair will start whether the home repair has been finished or <br/>
not. Any resulting problems with this will be blamed on the home owner.<br/>
<br/>
4. The scope and sequence of home repairs will be decided by <br/>
politicians and administrators who have not actually examined the <br/>
houses in question. This will be nationalized and local variables such <br/>
as climate and resources will not be taken into account.<br/>
<br/>
5. The bulk of the &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; training will be in methods of <br/>
controlling the various owners to submit to this process - the actual <br/>
home improvement portion of his training will be a few general classes <br/>
on industrial construction and highway repair.<br/>
<br/>
6. Any tests of the &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; knowledge of specific home repair will <br/>
show that it is no greater than that of the average homeowner. Any <br/>
efforts to mandate scores in this area would result in massive job <br/>
losses and will, of course be fought by the unions.<br/>
<br/>
7. In addition to the regular course of home improvement, the home <br/>
owners will be subject to sociali... er.. &quot;interior decoration&quot; by the <br/>
other homeowners. This will result in - at best - interiors that <br/>
reflect the values of the other homeowners instead of the owner of the <br/>
actual home and at worst, vandalization and theft.<br/>
<br/>
8. In an attempt to mitigate the worst of point 7, a counse... excuse <br/>
me - interior consultant - will be employed to whitewash any obvious <br/>
damage and - in extreme cases - refer the owner to a certified (and <br/>
expensive) interior decorator.<br/>
<br/>
9. Any &quot;unique&quot; home designs will be discouraged since they are not <br/>
mainstream and therefore would make the &quot;home repair&quot; process more <br/>
difficult for the &quot;professional.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
10. If by some chance the results of the above results in a large <br/>
number of homes being &quot;not to code,&quot; the home owners will be blamed and <br/>
the home repair industry will call for more tax money to be collected <br/>
and spent to provide adequate shelter for home owners. The<br/>
poor results will also be used to discourage any &quot;do it yourself&quot; home <br/>
owners by offering it as proof that home improvement is too difficult <br/>
to be handled by amateurs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way - did anyone else notice that the actual author is &quot;head <br/>
custodian at Brownstown Elementary School in Southern Illinois?&quot; <br/>
Probably not a leading expert on education in general. Sometimes, when <br/>
evaluating information, you need to consider the source.</div>
