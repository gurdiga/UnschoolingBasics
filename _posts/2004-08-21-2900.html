<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991297611">Hi Kiersten,<br/>
<br/>
Our ds  established his own routine from birth.  It seemed odd to me that<br/>
that was acceptable when they were infants.  Of course we all fed on demand<br/>
and infants slept when they slept but between 1 and 2 society shifts and<br/>
doesn&#39;t extend this any more.  My son stayed up really late and bc i would<br/>
wake up for a couple of hrs every night, I couldn&#39;t get enough sleep by the<br/>
time he would get up.  I was a wreck.  Everybody around me was pushing for<br/>
me to do some sleep training.  I was having doubts about my choices bc I was<br/>
so tired.  I went to our ped for help.  He said, &#39;I look at you and see a<br/>
very tired mother.   I look at your son and see a very happy child.  If i<br/>
saw a woman completely wrecked by lack of sleep, I&#39;d suggest some sleep<br/>
training but I don&#39;t see that.  As long as you can do it, keep doing just<br/>
what you&#39;re doing.  Your son will get exactly the amount of sleep he needs.&#39;<br/>
That&#39;s all the support I needed to keep going.  i did make some changes<br/>
though.  My dh travels and I hired someone to come in in the mornings when<br/>
he was away for a few hrs so i could get extra sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might find a whole different child when you no longer make such<br/>
an issue of sleep.  What about the 2 kids sleeping together if you don&#39;t<br/>
feel comfortable having her sleep in you room.  I&#39;m sure there would be a<br/>
period of transition when it&#39;s all too too exciting but sleeping alone isn&#39;t<br/>
a pleasant proposition for a child. Perhaps your older child would shift his<br/>
sleeping until later so they could be on a  more similar schedule.  I think<br/>
you have to thing creatively about the situation.  Se what you can come up<br/>
with that wouldn&#39;t wreck you and could work for the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 4 1/2.  Sometimes he would be happy to stay up past midnight and we<br/>
just can&#39;t do it and I tell him, I&#39;m done for the night.  Got to go to bed.<br/>
We get into bed and he inevitably will come within a few minutes.  My basic<br/>
philosophy has been: we&#39;re a family and we all have needs.  I&#39;ll do my<br/>
darndest to meet those needs of everybody (including my own) but inevitably<br/>
sometimes those will collide.  Then we&#39;ll talk and see what we can come up<br/>
with.  I think it&#39;s good and important for my ds to know that i also have<br/>
needs and I&#39;m taking care of myself and won&#39;t be self sacrificing.  It may<br/>
look like self sacrificing to someone else but that&#39;s bc I&#39;d like to get to<br/>
a place where he gets what he needs.  But that definitely has limits.  And<br/>
those things can&#39;t be set in stone.  I think the negotiating and talking<br/>
that goes on bc of this is something he&#39;ll be able to build on throughout<br/>
his life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368913057">Hi Allison,<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have been talking about giving the kids the option <br/>
to sleep in the same room when they want to. I am going to see how <br/>
everything goes.<br/>
<br/>
Your point is a great one for me.<br/>
Emma is a really happy kid. About the only things she cries over are <br/>
teething and having to go to sleep. (And being in the car when she <br/>
was an infant)<br/>
<br/>
I think if I let go of this power struggle, I will get to enjoy her <br/>
even more. And I will like myself better too!<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to hear things worked out well for your family!<br/>
<br/>
