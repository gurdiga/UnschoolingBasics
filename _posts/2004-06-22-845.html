<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872728598">I have been lurking for a few days.  My name is Andrea, and my son is<br/>
Tobin (4).  I have belonged to other homeschooling/unschooling groups,<br/>
and am not surprised that there are some purists screaming for purity.<br/>
This is, after all an unschooling group where we are talking about the<br/>
basics of unschooling.  However, the term &quot;unschooling&quot; has so many<br/>
different meanings to so many different FAMILIES.  Since the time John<br/>
Holt began, unschooling has evolved and changed (just like any theory or<br/>
religion).  I&#39;m sure John Holt, after spending another 10 or so years,<br/>
would have said things that conflicted with original thoughts.  Is there<br/>
a rule book for unschooling?  Unschooling is very organic according to<br/>
each family, and would not be unschooling if there were a rule book.  I<br/>
do believe we all have wonderful things to offer to this group.  Some<br/>
may be more aggressively purist in their posts, and some may get their<br/>
feelings hurt.  We probably can all agree that as the parent, we have a<br/>
lot to learn.  There are ways to influence people without being<br/>
negative, or righteous.  There are also ways to hear criticism that<br/>
won&#39;t leave you feeling stupid.  This is not a religion.  This is a way<br/>
of raising our kids to be confident self-learners.  <br/>

<br/>
I second the motion.  New people like myself who are interested in an <br/>
unschooling/gentle parenting lifestyle should be treated with the <br/>
same respect we give to our children.  I love to read about everyones <br/>
views on unschooling and parenting.  I came to unschooling by reading <br/>
positive accounts of unschooling families.  The freedom to choose <br/>
what is best for my children is what I love most about homeschooling. <br/>
If I ask for advice I have the freedom to take what works for me and <br/>
leave the rest.  I choose to leave the negative stuff behind.<br/>
<br/>
And anyway, doesn&#39;t it seem that there is a continuum involved here.  <br/>
Can only the most radical unschoolers call themselves unschoolers?  I <br/>
feel like in my case I am easing into the waters instead of jumping <br/>
in head first.  We still have certain controls in our house like <br/>
bedtime for 3yo ds.  It&#39;s not set in stone, but there is a time range <br/>
we shoot for to have him in bed.  But 11 yo ds goes to bed when he is <br/>
tired and wakes up when he is rested.  Someday my 3yo will do the <br/>
same as my 11yo.  But not before it feels right.  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
I&#39;m not a gentle parent.  And it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t call myself an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998468641">Cheryl, <br/>
<br/>
I always tell people on my Texas lists that it&#39;s an easing in and that&#39;s just fine.  Some people can&#39;t jump into the middle.  Sometimes when controls have been very tight, jumping into the middle with your children can confuse and frustrate them--and YOU.  I think easing in is a great approach and I always advise this when someone in one of my groups is scared, or judging herself according to what the long-time unschoolers are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a local support group?  I find that local groups are much more supportive of where someone is right now, and helping her to take babysteps, or leaps, if that&#39;s what she needs.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, however, that Unschooling Basics is an information group, and not so much a support group.  I may be wrong about that .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743949499">&quot;Let&#39;s support each other as we get better at <br/>
this, not attack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There has been zero attacking done at this list, thus far.<br/>
An attack is calling people names, telling them they&#39;re wrong (this has not been done, but there has been discussion about how to bring unschooling philosophies into ALL of life) and being generally mean spirited.<br/>
I assume that all people here are adults, able to decide what applies to their lives and what does not. The people at this list are NOT my children, nor should any of us be expected to treat adult strangers like our children. <br/>
Respect goes both ways.<br/>
There are several long time unschoolers here, giving advice for FREE, spending time away from other things they could be doing in order to HELP people. Why? Because unschooling has brought such joy and happiness into our homes, we just want to share the possibilities with others.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about helping people understand unschooling. Discussions will get detailed. If you don&#39;t want help understanding unschooling, or helping others understand unschooling, this isn&#39;t the list for you. That&#39;s ok.:)<br/>
But that IS our purpose here. <br/>
<br/>
If someone posts about doing lessons, or units or teaching their children, YES, that flies in the face of unschooling. If it&#39;s about bedtimes or food or other parenting issues...not one person here has said &quot;then you aren&#39;t an unschooler&quot;, but again, it will get questioned.<br/>
<br/>
I have very clearly stated in the guidelines that there will be no discussion of how other people post. If it bothers you, either don&#39;t read it, or comment on the ideas being discussed, not the actual posting style. I&#39;ve seen lists erupt into chaos over a discussion about each persons posts....so we aren&#39;t going to let that happen.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like the advice given, that&#39;s ok. That&#39;s part of a large group of people having discussion!:) But we urge you to stick to discussing the idea. If you get off on a tangent about the advice being given (for free), and the content of what you THINK the advice should be about, then posts will have to be moderated.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t striving for agreement, we&#39;re striving for a healthy discussion of ideas.<br/>
If someone here has a problem with lessons/units and teaching being questioned, this is NOT the list for you.<br/>

experiences others may learn a bit here and there from me. In time, everyone may be as <br/>
free of all thought of anything that you call &quot;schoolish.&quot; Many of us aren&#39;t <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cheryl --<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means you don&#39;t preplan lessons, give assignments, follow a <br/>
curriculum, give tests or quizzes, or grade your child. You don&#39;t <br/>
decide FOR the child that he/she is going to study American history <br/>
this year and Ancient History next year or chemistry this month and <br/>
astronomy next month and so on. You do not have a little &quot;schoolhouse&quot; <br/>
at home with you as the teacher and all the usual trappings of school.<br/>
<br/>
What you do INSTEAD is going to be different in every family - and <br/>
change over time.<br/>
<br/>
It is the purpose of this list to talk about what unschooling is - to <br/>
explore answers to questions like: &quot;What is unschooling? How does it <br/>
work? How do unschooled children learn? Do they learn traditional <br/>
school subjects? Are they successful? (What IS success?) Without <br/>
structured lessons planned for them, how do they know what they should <br/>
learn? How do you know they HAVE learned, if they don&#39;t take tests? Can <br/>
they go to college? How do they learn to follow directions? How do they <br/>
ever learn to do things they might not &quot;feel like&quot; doing? What does it <br/>
take to unschool? Can all parents unschool? Are there kids for whom <br/>
unschooling is a mistake? How do we get started? What if my child has <br/>
been in school or we&#39;ve been doing a formal school-at-home format? Is <br/>
it unschooling if ---- I don&#39;t make my child learn anything? We use <br/>
textboooks?  I only make my child do math? We use a curriculum, but use <br/>
it flexibly? My CHILD wants to use a curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
All of the above and more are truly questions directly about <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
BUT -<br/>
The other stuff talked about by unschoolers - not having fixed <br/>
bedtimes, not having fixed limits on tv, letting kids choose their own <br/>
foods, etc., are all topics that can be seen more as &quot;potential side <br/>
effects&quot; or &quot;possible repercussions&quot; of living an unschooling <br/>
lifestyle. They don&#39;t define unschooling and there are plenty of people <br/>
who unschool and continue to impose limits on their kids in these and <br/>
other areas.<br/>
<br/>
The reason they come up in unschooling discussions so often is that <br/>
once people let go of control over their child&#39;s learning, and they <br/>
come to have confidence and trust in their children and themselves in <br/>
that<br/>
area, it seems they naturally begin to experiment with &quot;letting go&quot; in <br/>
other areas as well.<br/>
<br/>
So - when you&#39;re on an unschooling list, you are likely to run into <br/>
quite a few people who have questioned all these other kinds of control <br/>
over other aspects of children&#39;s lives, not just educational control.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the need to repeat, over and over, these are things that many <br/>
long-time unschoolers have discovered to be the natural result of <br/>
unschooling, but you certainly do NOT have to adopt them in order to <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
You unschool by dropping SCHOOLING - most especially the coercive <br/>
aspects of school!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what we&#39;re called. My older kids think of themselves as <br/>
unschoolers even though they both take community college courses in <br/>
which they are clearly not &quot;unschooled.&quot; I don&#39;t think they are <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; anymore - but unschooling is what they identify with - <br/>
they feel like, having been unschooled, they are now permanently <br/>
granted that particular identity. I don&#39;t care. If somebody said, &quot;But, <br/>
they aren&#39;t unschooling anymore!!&quot; I&#39;d agree. If somebody said, &quot;They <br/>
ARE grown unschoolers, still, because they were unschooled and now they <br/>
are taking those college classes by choice,&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;Yeah, okay.&quot; It <br/>
SO doesn&#39;t matter to me what they are called. I don&#39;t have a strong <br/>
urge to identify &quot;people&quot; by a particular title.<br/>
<br/>
But when I want to talk about unschooling - I want to talk about kids <br/>
NOT going to school and not being taught in a school-like way by their <br/>
parents at home. I want to know that THAT is what we&#39;re talking about - <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t make sense to say, &quot;We unschool using Calvert <br/>
Curriculum.&quot; I want the term to be useful in discussions about how <br/>
children learn without schooling of ANY kind. I don&#39;t want the <br/>
definition so watered down that self-proclaimed unschoolers are sharing <br/>
curriculum tips and lesson plans with each other.<br/>
<br/>
People ask, &quot;Is it okay if.....?&quot;  I dunno. That&#39;s the best answer I <br/>
can give. Do people want my permission? Why on earth would they ask a <br/>
list of complete strangers if something is okay? I cringe when I see <br/>
questions starting that way.<br/>
<br/>
But if they ask, &quot;Is it unschooling if....?&quot; I think that is usually a <br/>
question worth exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Is it still unschooling if we impose bedtimes? Yes you could still be <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Is it still unschooling if we have limits and restrictions on tv or if <br/>
we don&#39;t have a tv at all? Yes you could still be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Is it still unschooling if I make my kids eat their vegetables or <br/>
finish what they take or try a bite of anything new? Yes, you could <br/>
still be unschooling.<br/>

learning without the usual trappings of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you disagree with that? Would you go so far as to agree with a <br/>
definition of unschooling that included parent/teacher determined <br/>
textbook readings according to a preplanned schedule, assignments, <br/>
tests, and grades?<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;purists&quot; repeat over and over that unschooling will look different <br/>
in different families.<br/>
<br/>
When you say it will have different meanings to different families - <br/>
are you saying more than that it will look different in different <br/>
families? Are you including doing school-at-home as a kind of <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I see the whole point of talking about unschooling as talking about <br/>
what it is like to live and learn without schooling. So &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
means simply &quot;not schooling.&quot;  That&#39;s it - an easy simple definition <br/>
that we can talk about, apparently, forever! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Unschoolers and school-at-homers usually all consider themselves <br/>

You have so many ways to learn about unschooling and you can choose <br/>

books, articles, conferences, email lists, message boards, local <br/>
support groups, and, best of all, experience in your own families.<br/>

assignments, no formal preplanned curriculum, no breaking the subject <br/>
matter into little bitty increments, no testing, no grades.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459802013">And what if reaching true unschooling &#39;in your own time&#39; doesn&#39;t happen before your kids are grown?  Unfortunately, in parenting our children, we don&#39;t often have the luxury of taking babysteps in our own time.  We have to make our progress in our child&#39;s time, those early years that only come once and only last for a short time.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m speaking as the Mom of a grown child.  My oldest son is 19, and on his own now.  We didn&#39;t find homeschooling until he was 16 -- when he flat out told us he was not returning to school.  We registered him as a homeschooler, and let him learn on his own, with the requirement from us that he get his GED.  He did that, one year earlier than his scheduled graduation would have been.  A year later, we landed squarely into unschooling as a lifestyle, and the lives our younger sons (8 & 3) lead today are vastly better than the early years my oldest son lived.  I so wish I&#39;d known unschooling when my oldest was young.  He&#39;s living 19 better and happier than I did, but still there is so much he will have to undo and unlearn --  burdens I stuck him with because I was controlling in ways I have now given up.<br/>
 <br/>
It isn&#39;t always comfortable or easy to give up the controls, to let go of our timetable and cherished plans for our children, but it&#39;s essential if we&#39;re ever to recognize that their lives are their own.  In the grand scheme, it&#39;s much easier to just never set up those timetables and plans, sit back and watch our children&#39;s lives unfold, in their time.  Being a parent isn&#39;t about doing things in a way and time that meets our needs.  Being a parent, especially an unschooling parent, is about making sure our children have all the freedom and love they need to live their own lives.  It&#39;s about trusting that what the life they will live for their own soul will be so much more than we could have ever planned for them.  When our children are born, we don&#39;t know who they are or what they&#39;ll become, but if we plan it all out for them, we&#39;ll also never know what they could have become.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry if it&#39;s not always gentle to hear, but our kids don&#39;t have time to wait for us to feel comfortable in our own time.  It&#39;s not about us -- it&#39;s about them.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you, but some people will go running and screaming away with a general bad feeling about unschooling if they can&#39;t go at their own pace.  My feeling is that children and adults go at their own pace no matter what anyone else says.  Personally, I wanted to know everything there was to know about unschooling as fast I could know it, but it was a painful growing experience.  Now, I seek out growth experiences because I know they are so amazingly great for my family.  Not everyone is the same.  So, every now and then there is a little grumbling about letting people progress at their own rate.  My feeling is that any step toward unschooling is positive for mom, dad, children, ..... world.  I am changing every day, trying to understand and communicate better/more effectively with people about unschooling and other things.  I am a radical unschooler and I want to help people where they are.<br/>
<br/>
We both have the same goal in mind.  Mine approach is constantly changing, trying to get better.  I want everyone to find what s/he needs to get to the goal.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589524824">I don&#39;t usually care a heck of a lot if people call themselves unschoolers <br/>
all the while talking about teaching goals and planning next years course of <br/>
study - I figure they&#39;ll get it or they won&#39;t and it&#39;s too bad for them if they <br/>
don&#39;t. ::shrug::: But in this particular case, someone is planning to write a <br/>
book about their two year adventure through teaching goals and planning next <br/>
years course of study and call it unschooling - I think it&#39;s legitimate for <br/>
folks to pipe up with a &quot;Hey, wait a minute - I don&#39;t think you understand and I&#39;d <br/>
like you to be clear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having said that - I&#39;m *Fascinated* that Joanne is apparently doing something <br/>
I&#39;ve been promoting half seriously in homeschooling circles for years - that <br/>
even if folks can&#39;t homeschool all the way through they ought to skip junior <br/>
high (middle school, whatever they call it where you live) as those are the <br/>
years where most kids get their self esteem seriously punctured, where peer <br/>
dependence and family avoidance takes hold, where little gets learned about much of <br/>
anything except how to survive junior high. (Actually, I&#39;ve been known to <br/>
propose we blow up the junior highs but that&#39;s another story..)   So Joanne, I&#39;d <br/>
love to hear what and why you&#39;re liberating your kid for those years only!<br/>

***<br/>
 <br/>
I have to agree there.  IME, jr. high/midschool is the most violent, soul-sucking, horrific environment left in our society, well maybe second to prison, but likely a close second!  <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest went to school until late in his 10th grade year, and we moved btwn 7 and 8th grade, so he attended two mid-schools.  Both were culturally very similar -- incredibly cliquish, mean to anyone who didn&#39;t fit the mold, and it was all dismissed as &#39;kids will be kids.&#39;  Very much like my own mid-school experience.  Sr. High was still not great, but much better than mid-school.<br/>
 <br/>
If (big if here) either of our younger boys ever wanted to attend school, I would strongly discourage the mid-school years (I&#39;m tempted to say I wouldn&#39;t allow it).  I have to liken it to letting them play on the freeway.  My job is to protect them and mid-school is just awful and dangerous to one&#39;s identity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968425886">Hearing all of this really makes me feel validated.... and more and more convinced to home/unschool my kids (can&#39;t believe it is going to two this fall when I think of it this way)<br/>
<br/>
Public School was a horrible experience for me personally and I left there very damaged and today still work to heal from some of the damage inflicted on me while I was getting *socialized*. My dh had a rough time too but his personality and a family that supported him had him convinced it was the others that were wrong and him just getting through it. As hard as ps tried, it didn&#39;t kill his love of learning thankfully, but he did get kicked out in grade 12 for handing out birth control literature on the school grounds to the girls (yes this was back in the late 60&#39;s:)) and his mom went to war for him with the principle... I was in awe of them both. <br/>
<br/>
For me I learned that I was mostly wrong and others were mostly right and for him he learned that they were mostly wrong and he was mostly right. Two different learnings in the different yet similar environments... no matter the outcome, I will not put my gentle, loving, sweet little girl through that.<br/>

  even if folks can&#39;t homeschool all the way through they ought to skip junior high (middle school, whatever they call it where you live) as those are the years where most kids get their self esteem seriously punctured, where peer dependence and family avoidance takes hold, where little gets learned about much of <br/>
  anything except how to survive junior high. (Actually, I&#39;ve been known to propose we blow up the junior highs but that&#39;s another story..) <br/>
<br/>

  I have to agree there.  IME, jr. high/midschool is the most violent, soul-sucking, horrific environment left in our society, well maybe second to prison, but likely a close second!  <br/>
<br/>
  My oldest went to school until late in his 10th grade year, and we moved btwn 7 and 8th grade, so he attended two mid-schools.  Both were culturally very similar -- incredibly cliquish, mean to anyone who didn&#39;t fit the mold, and it was all dismissed as &#39;kids will be kids.&#39;  Very much like my own mid-school experience.  Sr. High was still not great, but much better than mid-school.<br/>
<br/>
  If (big if here) either of our younger boys ever wanted to attend school, I would strongly discourage the mid-school years (I&#39;m tempted to say I wouldn&#39;t allow it).  I have to liken it to letting them play on the freeway.  My job is to protect them and mid-school is just awful and dangerous to one&#39;s identity.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you think this list is not allowing you to learn about unschooling?<br/>
It&#39;s an honest question. I&#39;d like to understand why some people see coercion<br/>
and others see discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Do you equate being able to share and talk about what you do on a list as<br/>
part of doing and learning about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that people who love discussion lists (which this one<br/>
is) see the sharing and talking on the list as separate from the practice of<br/>
unschooling. The list is for ideas and information and things to think<br/>
about. It&#39;s like a book that talks back when they have a question :-) But<br/>
once they step away from the list, the ideas are theirs to do with what they<br/>
want. They can do them or not. Think about them or not. If they don&#39;t want<br/>
to let go of bedtimes, they don&#39;t have to. If they want unschool except for<br/>
math, they can. They can adapt what they read to suit them.<br/>
<br/>
I think talking about and sharing and trading what we do can be valuable but<br/>
it&#39;s a separate thing from discussion. I think of that as support. And there<br/>
are lists where the focus is support, where people kick back and share their<br/>
hopes and fears and frustrations and get sympathy and support for who they<br/>
are. There are face-to-face groups that are also for support.<br/>
<br/>
I think, like unschooling, it&#39;s a matter of recognizing what we want and<br/>
finding a way to get it. Discussion *is* what many people want so people who<br/>
like discussion make lists so they and others like them can meet their need<br/>
to discuss. Support is what many other people need. And there are separate<br/>
lists for them. Support and discussion are different needs and those needs<br/>
need to be met in different ways. For someone to stay unhappily with a<br/>
discussion list when what they need is support in order to unschool is like<br/>
a hands on child staying with books to learn about carpentry.<br/>

It isn&#39;t always comfortable or easy to give up the controls, to let go of our <br/>
timetable and cherished plans for our children, but it&#39;s essential if we&#39;re <br/>
ever to recognize that their lives are their own.  In the grand scheme, it&#39;s <br/>
much easier to just never set up those timetables and plans, sit back and watch <br/>
our children&#39;s lives unfold, in their time.  Being a parent isn&#39;t about doing <br/>
things in a way and time that meets our needs.  Being a parent, especially an <br/>
unschooling parent, is about making sure our children have all the freedom and <br/>
love they need to live their own lives.  It&#39;s about trusting that what the <br/>
life they will live for their own soul will be so much more than we could have <br/>
ever planned for them.  When our children are born, we don&#39;t know who they are <br/>
or what they&#39;ll become, but if we plan it all out for them, we&#39;ll also never <br/>
know what they could have become.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it&#39;s not always gentle to hear, but our kids don&#39;t have time to wait <br/>
for us to feel comfortable in our own time.  It&#39;s not about us -- it&#39;s about <br/>
them.<br/>

We don&#39;t, imo, need to be pushed. We need to be allowed to get where we need <br/>
to go in our own time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which is basically impossible for anyone to tell on a list. Nor the point<br/>
either. The list isn&#39;t to help people be &quot;good&quot; parents because &quot;good&quot; is<br/>
too vague. People who make their kids do their curriculum each day are being<br/>
good parents (by their definition). People who spank their kids for<br/>
disobedience are being good parents (by their definition.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important on a list is exchanging ideas in ways that are clear and<br/>
will help someone else get something the list is trying to offer.<br/>
<br/>
If someone talks about how she needs to make her child do math every morning<br/>
because he craves structure and she&#39;s a good mother and is giving him what<br/>
he&#39;s asking for, that doesn&#39;t help anyone understand the principles of<br/>
unschooling nor help anyone apply the principles in their family. Nor does<br/>
it help if a mother has struggled to come to the conclusion that she needs<br/>
to make sure her son gets 8 hours of sleep a night because of his special<br/>
problems and their unique situation at home.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for their unique situations they&#39;re right. (Maybe not.) But the<br/>
sharing of it doesn&#39;t help anyone get closer to understanding unschooling.<br/>
It might help people understand the principle of doing what feels right and<br/>
what works for their family. But parents who send their kids to school are<br/>
using that principle too. So it&#39;s not a very helpful principle when people<br/>
have come to a list to find a way to do something different, especially<br/>
something that&#39;s bound to make them uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more helpful to see the list as an information resource for<br/>
those who want to do what the list is offering to help people do. (What the<br/>
list offers is determined by Ren and Kelly and company.) People can come and<br/>
say &quot;I want to figure out how to let go of controls.&quot; And people can offer<br/>
ideas. But it&#39;s not a requirement that everyone should let go of controls.<br/>
(Nor an invitation to discuss how we should all just do what works for our<br/>
family.) There will be ideas and help in implementing those ideas that some<br/>
people won&#39;t have any interest in trying out. They can let that information<br/>
go by. Someone else might be finding it useful.<br/>
