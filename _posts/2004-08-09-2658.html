<div id="ygrps-yiv-201925800">Interesting.  I&#39;ll have to read that one.  I know four families who send<br/>
their kids there and I also get some insider feedback from a former staff<br/>
member there who currently unschools his family in the town where I live.<br/>
He and his wife&#39;s criticisms were that firstly, the school views unschoolers<br/>
as &quot;overprotective&quot; which is pretty sad since so much of the &quot;child led<br/>
learning&quot; philosophy is the same.  Secondly that he left primarily because<br/>
he felt there was actually a &quot;culture of leisure&quot; encouraged there...that<br/>
is, so many of the teachers had been driven so hard by parents in their<br/>
youth that they were really challenging older kids who asked to do or learn<br/>
something with &quot;Prove your parents didn&#39;t put you up to this!&quot; and thereby<br/>
discouraging them.  He felt there were lots of kids who might be choosing to<br/>
do other things, but they were making friendship bracelets all day instead<br/>
because that is what was promoted as &quot;culturally acceptable&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely a place with question marks, but not your standard school either.<br/>
It&#39;s the only school I know of where the kids go to town meeting, vote to<br/>
make their own &quot;rules&quot; to run the school by, and regularly play outside all<br/>
day if they want in the treehouses the older kids built, or sit around and<br/>
chat, or mingle with kids of all ages freely, etcetera.  They can bring<br/>
movies to watch or video games of any kind with equipment to play.  The<br/>
social code they have there really encourages kids to take responsibility<br/>
and care for each other.  Where at other schools, &quot;telling&quot; about an<br/>
incident of one kid picking on another for example, is often viewed<br/>
negatively, at SVS if you witness such an event you are required to report<br/>
it (again, not a rule handed down by adults, but one proposed and agreed to<br/>
by everyone).  I&#39;ve heard really touching stories about how the kids help<br/>
each other and care about each other there more than a more normal school.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that if one of my kids decided they wanted to check out<br/>
&quot;school&quot;, I&#39;d include it as an option for them to explore.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Very interesting place, and &quot;school&quot; is something of a misnomer for it.<br/>
It&#39;s been profiled on 20/20 I know.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is an interview by a Principal of one of them in the latest Life<br/>
Learning Magazine. He sprouts all the same old anti-homeschooling - school<br/>
is better than being at home for Socialization in the &quot;real world&quot;/ we are<br/>
the experts - malarkey.<br/>
<br/>
Just a school after all...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I seen some hints of that among some unschoolers - AFTER they&#39;ve grown <br/>
up and gone to college - then sort of talking the slightly younger kids <br/>
out of going to college. I understand that they see - from the vantage <br/>
point of having done it - that it wasn&#39;t all they&#39;d expected. But, <br/>
still, as a parent, it has bothered me to hear Peter Kowalke, for <br/>
example, sound like he is persuading kids to not go to college. Peter <br/>
is giving a talk at the HSC conference in Sacramento - here is his <br/>
blurb:<br/>
College Unschooling<br/>
  - Peter Kowalke<br/>
  Donâ€™t go to school just because you want or need a college education. <br/>
Unschool your way through college! Peter Kowalke, a grown homeschooler <br/>
who has written extensively on the topic, discusses why college is not <br/>
necessary and explores several unschooler-friendly alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
Now - don&#39;t get me wrong - I AGREE with him about alternatives being <br/>
possible. But he is very influential among the slightly younger kids <br/>
and I feel a little &quot;annoyed&quot; as a parent that kids I think are going <br/>
to LOVE college are being influenced to be &quot;cool&quot; (not Peter&#39;s word - <br/>
just my sense of things) - to think of themselves as more radical in <br/>
their unschooling - to sort of make a point - and not go to college. If <br/>
college isn&#39;t for them - then alternatives are awesome - I&#39;m a big <br/>
proponent of not going to college just because it is expected, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t like to see someone create (even inadvertently) a &quot;culture&quot; <br/>
where going to college is considered an affront to unschooling.<br/>
