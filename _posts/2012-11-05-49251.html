<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607597305">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
some of you will remember me. I&#39;m Johanna from Germany, Leipzig, and I&#39;m an editor and author for the &quot;unerzogen magazine&quot;. We publish articles about unschooling, respectful parenting, democratic schools etc. <br/>
<br/>
Some of you well known and experienced unschoolers have already written for us: Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen, just to mention a few. <br/>
<br/>
The next issue&#39;s topic is &quot;partnership&quot;. We want to explore the possibility of &quot;unschooling&quot; between partners/in your partnership. We know that there are parents/couples out there who have experience with this. Who after a few years of Unschooling realized that they weren&#39;t following the same principles with their own partner! And after realizing, started working on that. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has collected some of the ideas here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spouses">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br/>
<br/>
Is anyone willing to write an article for us? It could be from your own experience, from your experience working with others, an overview, a collection of tips... <br/>
<br/>
If so, please contact me under: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jgm@...">jgm@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to read your replies!<br/>
<br/>
~Johanna</div>
