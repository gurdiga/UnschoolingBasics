<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123292832">Danette - Welcome to the group!  We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 6 years now.  We morphed into unschooling about 3 years ago.  The kids are George (ds 12) and Nola (dd 10).   <br/>
<br/>
I am curious about something in your post:  What do you think the kids should be doing independently of each other?  I think it&#39;s fun to have someone around that shares an interest, and I really think it&#39;s cool if your kids feel like doing so much of what they do with each other.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now, my two are playing Animal Crossing.  It&#39;s Nola&#39;s game and file, but George is enjoying watching, making comments about what&#39;s going on.   If I wasn&#39;t on this computer, he might be playing Runescape online, but maybe not.  <br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt;      I am new to this group and new to unschooling. We have been<br/>
&gt; homeschooling for about 3 years now. I have 3 DDs ages 10,7, and 2.<br/>
&gt; While I can&#39;t say we are unshooling yet, it is something I want to<br/>
&gt; move towards.I will probably just be listening to you all for now and<br/>
&gt; then maybe pop in with a question or two. I am reading The Unprocessed<br/>
&gt; Child right now but also wonder if any of you have teens or older and<br/>
&gt; how it is going. Also how it is with more than one child? Mine play<br/>
&gt; alot together which is great. I am just curious as to how having more<br/>
&gt; than one affects the dynamics of unschooling( as far as following<br/>
&gt; Individual interests) They play so much together that I don&#39;t see them<br/>
&gt; doing as much independently. Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908045697">Hi ,<br/>
Thanks for the welcome. I  am not sure I can put it into words. I<br/>
guess I just mean that they spend ALOT of time playing &quot;make believe&quot;<br/>
and while their game are really cool and I know they are learning I am<br/>
sometimes afraid that the younger one doesn&#39;t get to do alot of what<br/>
she is interested in because the older is very dominate. The only time<br/>
they seperate is if they are not getting along and that is mostly<br/>
because my younger( Maddy) is fed up with  ( Sara&#39;s) control over all<br/>
their games. Does that make any sense?<br/>
Danette<br/>
Sorry I son&#39;t know how to just highlight the part that I am responding<br/>
to. Can anyone tell me hoe to do that?<br/>
