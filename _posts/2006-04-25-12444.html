<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214877938">&quot;I mean really neat stuff.  He said that on the<br/>
Mummy Returns there is even more stuff!  now I am not any more<br/>
interested in seeing the movies but I DO want to see those bonus<br/>
features!  How cool is that?  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really cool that you&#39;re seeing how ANY interest can lead<br/>
to learning. BUT, this is a good time for self examination too.<br/>
<br/>
Why were you SO excited when you saw some schoolish form of learning<br/>
spawn off of his fascination? Why wasn&#39;t his fascination with the DVD<br/>
enough, without the Egyptology section?<br/>
Interests can lead to learning that looks like &quot;subjects&quot;, but often<br/>
they don&#39;t. Either way, we should be excited because it&#39;s something<br/>
our children enjoy and get something from.<br/>
