<div id="ygrps-yiv-29769273">Hi - Yesterday I rec&#39;d the email below.  I know it advertises &quot;Connection Parenting&quot; and teleclasses, but I wanted to share it as Pam&#39;s &quot;Connection Parenting&quot; is a wonderful parenting resource and perhaps someone will be able to support her or contribute to the book being created for her.  Sincerely, Laurie Wolfrum (pasted below with permission from Ren and Kelly)<br/>
 <br/>
---------------------<br/>
Pam Leo has been ill since late 2008 and has been unable to involve herself with her life&#39;s passion of spreading the message of Connection Parenting to families around the world. Here at Consciously Parenting, we&#39;ve been keeping her classes running with her blessing, but we feel a deep loss that Pam can&#39;t be here to teach her own classes and share her wisdom.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Share Your Connection Parenting Story with Pam<br/>
 <br/>
We are creating a book for Pam from the people around the world who love her and want to let her know how much Connection Parenting has meant to them. If you would like to share a story of how Connection Parenting changed your family for the better, something that happened as a result of Connection Parenting, personal experiences with Pam or her work, etc., please consider writing them up for us to include. Pictures of your family, as well as a geographic location of where you are in the world, would be great.<br/>
 <br/>
If you know others who would enjoy participating, please pass this along to them. We&#39;d like to have all of the stories and pictures by September 8 to compile and get to her. If you&#39;d like to participate, please send your submissions to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:info@...">info@...</a>. Questions? E-mail the same address or call 888.631.4441 x2.  We need your help to find any many people as possible who love Pam! You can share this direct link with others, post it on Facebook, etc.    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://consciouslyparenting.com/classes/CP/support.php">http://consciouslyparenting.com/classes/CP/support.php</a> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
In the spirit of Pam&#39;s work, as well as to create some additional income for Pam, we&#39;d like to continue spreading the word of Connection Parenting. We have some FREE audio interviews I did with Pam that we are continuing to offer at no cost to you to spread the word. Listen to those here: Audio on Connection Parenting  and Audio on Alternatives in Discipline <br/>
 <br/>
We are continuing to offer Connection Parenting teleclasses so that families can continue to receive the support they need to make Connection Parenting happen in their homes. Part of the teleclass fee goes to Pam. We are also offering the mp3 of Pam reading her book, Connection Parenting. It is only available here. All proceeds go to Pam.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have other ideas or suggestions on how we can support Pam in this time, please let us know.  <br/>
<br/>
 Warmly, <br/>
 <br/>
