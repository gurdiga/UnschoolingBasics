<br/>
Past the &quot;norm&quot; according to whom?<br/>
Worldwide, the &quot;norm&quot; average is three years old. That&#39;s factoring in all these American Mums that only breastfeed a few months.<br/>
If you look at what is natural and normal for human beings, the suckling instinct often lasts until around 5-7 years of age. Sometimes longer, sometimes less, but 5 or 6 years old is definitely not uncommon.<br/>
I&#39;m still nursing my 3.4 year old....and I can&#39;t imagine trying to wean him right now. It would be advantageous for me, because I&#39;m dealing with some health issues I can&#39;t do a whole lot about until he&#39;s weaned...but it&#39;s not worth stressing this guy out. He LOVES his &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; and I love snuggling up in bed and kissing that sweet little head while he nurses.<br/>
He&#39;s never, ever been to a doctor over illness. Heck, he&#39;s only been sick a couple times in his entire life, and it didn&#39;t last long.<br/>
Breastfeeding long term is healthy for both mother and child...the only reason it seems not the &quot;norm&quot; is because of the way our society views breastfeeding...MAJOR hangups!<br/>

   I wasn&#39;t factoring in the entire world when I said norm.  Just the United<br/>
States and I wasn&#39;t condoning or approving of the fact that it is not common<br/>
in the United States to see 5 and 6 yo nursing.  I was just curiouse as to<br/>
the thoughts about it because my kids didn&#39;t want to nurse pass 1.5.<br/>
Truthfully I was trying to understand why for some people the breastfeeding<br/>
can last, but for me it ends rather ubruptly.  I can remember feeling like I<br/>
wanted to extend it, but my kids were having none of it.  Like I said just<br/>
curious didn&#39;t mean to insult you or anyone else.<br/>

<br/>
I wasn&#39;t insulted...honest. <br/>
Just trying to shed some light on why you might find it baffling, <br/>
it&#39;s a societal thing. Didn&#39;t know if you had the information I was <br/>
sharing.<br/>
If your children had loved breastfeeding at 1.5 years, maybe it <br/>
would be easier to understand. Many children don&#39;t show any signs of <br/>
weaning at 2 or 3 or beyond.<br/>
