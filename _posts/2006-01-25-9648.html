<div id="ygrps-yiv-514614788">He says it just like that, in the softest little voice.  It&#39;s been<br/>
driving my wife crazy, but discussing it, she realized that she never<br/>
had limits on candy growing up.  She also never had tv limits, and to<br/>
this day, the tv at Grandma&#39;s is almost always on.  Plus, the boys are<br/>
both eating as well as they ever did.<br/>
My youngest has been eating candy like crazy, and has actually eaten<br/>
up the stash.  There is a small pile of Tootsie Pops which he doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to like.  He ate all his leftover Halloween candy.  Today, he ate<br/>
a tiny bit of breakfast and just now brought me pop ice number five. <br/>
However, he found a sucker he does want on the way to bring me the pop<br/>
ice.  I have thrown away almost as much candy he&#39;s eaten, unwanted<br/>
suckers left on coasters or the table.  A couple days ago I had left<br/>
his lunch plate on the table, and it collected any amount of unwanted<br/>
candy.  He kept trying the peppermint patties, but several of them got<br/>
tossed missing one little bite.  I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at opening<br/>
the Pez just right so that the whole stack slides right into Chewbacca.<br/>
Watching tv whenever we want has meant that in the last few days I<br/>
could have watched some of my own favorite movies, though I was busy<br/>
elsewhere while the boys watched.  My wife got to sit and watch My<br/>
Neighbor Totoro with our youngest while I fixed breakfast this<br/>
morning. I wonder what Reid will pick when Evan finishes playing<br/>
Spider Man.<br/>
I can see our attitudes slowly changing for the better.  I can see<br/>
that my oldest son is a little unsure right now.  I talked to him last<br/>
night about all of us changing our attitude.  I explained that we&#39;ve<br/>
been treating each other pretty poorly and that we all need to work<br/>
together to change.  I think my own stress currently is realizing how<br/>
my attitudes were responsible for the tenseness around the house,<br/>
because I had pretty outrageous expectations not so long ago.  I kind<br/>
of feel like I was creating this really angry monster.  <br/>
The current mood around the house speaks for my efforts.  Our (me and<br/>
my oldest) bedtime is kind of messed up lately.  He&#39;s been staying up<br/>
really late, and I&#39;m not sure how comfortable I am with just letting<br/>
him be up by himself.  He&#39;s seven.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  So I<br/>
sit up late and sleep later.  I&#39;m used to restaurant hours, so it&#39;s<br/>
not that big a deal except for getting up.  I will sleep through the<br/>
alarm clock unless I know I have to be at work, and I feel guilty if I<br/>
sleep &quot;too late.&quot;  My wife works odd/long hours, so lifting bedtime<br/>
limits has actually given her more time with the boys.  <br/>
This started out about candy and turned into a report of sorts.  I<br/>
apologize to anyone that read this far for having bored you to tears.<br/>
 I&#39;ll try not to do it again.  I really should be moving on to the<br/>
housework.</div>

enjoyed the &quot;this moment&quot; posts and hearing from other &#39;new&#39; unschoolers is<br/>
really nice.<br/>
