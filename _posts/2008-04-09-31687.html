  Yep, We never have to. No one has to. It is a choice. You choose to.<br/>

  It is a lot about how you look at the situation and how you look at your child.It is  a huge shift in the way of mainstream thinking.<br/>
  Unschooling parents are not permissive.<br/>
  Permissiveness is neglect and unparenting. We are the opposite. We are MORE present, involved, connected.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not perfect at this but I&#39;m definitely working on it. But, no, you <br/>
never have to punish/reward/praise. You definitely have to change the <br/>
way you view everything about your relationship with your child. <br/>
Rather than looking at it as letting them do whatever they want in the <br/>
way I think you mean (mainstream spoiling), look at it as finding ways <br/>
to let everyone be happy and joyful and be themselves. It&#39;s about <br/>
being more present with your children. It&#39;s the antithesis of <br/>
permissiveness.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when my 4yo wants to jump on and off the couch I could <br/>
think of all the ways he might get hurt or the furniture might get <br/>
broken and not let him do that. Or, I could find ways to make it safe <br/>
for him and my furniture so that we could both have fun with it. <br/>
Rather than saying, &quot;Good job,&quot; when he makes something, I can <br/>
say, &quot;Wow. You worked really hard on that, huh?&quot; or even just, &quot;Look <br/>
what you made!&quot; If you don&#39;t force someone to do something they don&#39;t <br/>
want to do, you don&#39;t need to reward them when they do something. They <br/>
do it because they want to and don&#39;t expect anything for it. You can <br/>
say, &quot;Thank you,&quot; of course.<br/>

I just watched Alfie Kohn&#39;s video based on his book, &quot;Unconditional<br/>
Parenting.&quot;  He&#39;s got me hooked.  I&#39;m going to check out the actual book<br/>
 from the library tomorrow, and stop using punishments/rewards/praise <br/>
ASAP!<br/>
My question is this:  For those of you (most of you, I assume) who do <br/>
not<br/>
punish/reward/praise, how do you draw the line between practicing this<br/>
&quot;parenting with&quot; style (as Kohn calls it) and being a permissive parent,<br/>
letting them do whatever they want?  Any suggestions/advice on how to<br/>
implement this in real life?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Say &quot;yes&quot; more. Be the parent you wish you&#39;d had (or more correctly, <br/>
the parent your CHILD wishes he could have).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really NEVER have to punish/reward/praise?  Or is it more about a<br/>
change in how you look at each situation?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t ever HAVE to do *anything*. Each and every decision we make <br/>
can be a choice. It IS a choice. We can choose to be generous, <br/>
trusting, patient, kind, curious, and respectful. Or not.<br/>
<br/>
It is certainly a change in perspective. A paradigm shift. It&#39;s about <br/>
considering *why* we would choose to say &quot;no.&quot; Is it because it&#39;s what <br/>
was told to us? Why? What will it hurt? What&#39;s another option? How can <br/>
we *make* it work?<br/>
<br/>
If you can give me a good reason to punish my children and proof that <br/>
it works, maybe I&#39;ll start punishing them. I haven&#39;t found a good <br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
Rewards happen naturally. I don&#39;t need to come up with some rewards <br/>
&quot;system&quot; to get my kids to do things. If they want to do something, I <br/>
figure learning that thing is reward enough. What would I &quot;reward&quot; them <br/>
*for*? That whole Pizza Hut reading program simply pisses me off.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t say we don&#39;t ever praise. It just probably looks a little <br/>
different. Cameron has asked to make supper. Every night. Cool. Tonight <br/>
he&#39;s in there pounding chicken and stuffing it with basil and cheese. <br/>
He&#39;ll pour a white cream sauce over the top and serve it with <br/>
bruschetta and a salad. If it&#39;s good, I&#39;ll damn well tell him! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Duncan just got to level ten with a new WoW character last night. When <br/>
he told us he got a new pet for reaching that level, we all said <br/>
&quot;COOL!&quot; We were excited *for* him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m genuinely thrilled when they are pleased with what they accomplish. <br/>
I have no problem telling them so. But it&#39;s not empty praise so that I <br/>
can get them to do things---or to encourage &quot;good behavior&quot; or <br/>
anything. It&#39;s real and no more or less than I would give to my husband <br/>
or a friend.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We absolutely never punish. The very idea is foreign to my kids.  <br/>
Seriously - when they hear about it, they are sort of fascinated by  <br/>
the idea, but they don&#39;t understand why parents would do it.<br/>
<br/>
Reward? Praise? Some, yes. Very carefully, though, especially when  <br/>
they were young. It can SO easily backfire. I always tried to see the  <br/>
reality behind each situation. Was I praising or rewarding in hope of  <br/>
&quot;shaping&quot; the child&#39;s behavior? I tried not to do that. Were we simply  <br/>
celebrating together? That&#39;s just fine and dandy. Was I giving  <br/>
feedback that was requested and honest? Fine.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never punish or reward. Praise isn&#39;t really traditional praise, more<br/>
about sharing their excitement and pride. <br/>
<br/>
When I started my beehives I had several people leave comments at my<br/>
blog like &quot;way to go&quot; and such. That&#39;s sharing pride WITH me. My<br/>
feelings about it don&#39;t hinge on what anyone else thinks or says.<br/>
<br/>
Feedback is useful. Real feedback that gives a learner different ways<br/>
to view a situation (if they want it). Real feedback is NOT &quot;good job&quot;<br/>
or &quot;that&#39;s pretty&quot;...it&#39;s very specific. The kind of things you&#39;d say<br/>
to a friend. <br/>
<br/>
Adults in intimate relationships don&#39;t usually punish each<br/>
other...that wouldn&#39;t be viewed as healthy. Yet children are subjected<br/>
to this poor treatment all the time. Can&#39;t you remember feeling all<br/>
the adults were so unfair? I don&#39;t remember any of my punishments<br/>
feeling fair or really learning anything other than anger towards adults.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen was really getting grumpy a couple days ago, telling everyone<br/>
&quot;shut up&quot; and slamming doors. When he came back into the room after a<br/>
mild explosion (it&#39;s best to let him have a few minutes on his own<br/>
before approaching him again) I walked over and said &quot;you look really<br/>
frustrated Jalen, can I hug you?&quot; as I&#39;m leaning towards him. He<br/>
melted into my arms and we just sat and cuddled while he told me &quot;why<br/>
my life sucks&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I could have punished him for lashing out and being &quot;rude&quot; to<br/>
everyone. I could have told him he was rotten for saying &quot;shut up&quot;<br/>
when Sierra was being sweet to him. How would that help him when he&#39;s<br/>
so obviously overwhelmed at the moment? Hugs and love go a long ways<br/>
to smoothing over rough moments and I feel he is actually learning<br/>
MORE about how to cope and how to navigate life by having that safety.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment drives a wedge between the perpetrator and victim. It<br/>
lessens trust and it makes for a hierarchal relationship. Not what I<br/>
want with my children. <br/>
