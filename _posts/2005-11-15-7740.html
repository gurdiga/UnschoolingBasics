<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702382070">&quot;He went from thinking that we were making a mistake with<br/>
unschooling, to trusting me because I&#39;m passionate in my belief in it<br/>
and have spent alot of time reading about it, to understanding it and<br/>
believing this would work for our family!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard this over and over each year, it&#39;s SO cool. I&#39;m really glad<br/>
he had such a great experience there.<br/>
I remember standing in Kelly&#39;s yard two years ago and having Kim<br/>
Conti&#39;s dh tell me &quot;when my wife explained unschooling I thought it<br/>
sounded a bit nuts, but after being here this weekend and seeing all <br/>
these kids, I KNOW it&#39;s the only life for us.&quot;<br/>
Wow!<br/>
I think the more Dads that come the better.:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I&#39;m so grateful that<br/>
the &quot;gurus&quot; of unschooling are such eloquent writers and speakers and<br/>
share your time and life with us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that was one of the sweetest reviews I&#39;ve ever read. Thank<br/>
you, you made my day!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; But how do I handle times when I need him to come<br/>
with us and if we stay home, 3 other kids miss out on what they want<br/>
to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You bring him with you. I wouldn&#39;t give that advice if you weren&#39;t<br/>
already being so mindful and respectful of him...but everything you<br/>
just wrote says you&#39;re doing your best to give him options. There ARE<br/>
times that you run out of options and they have to come. It&#39;s not the<br/>
same in larger families as it is with an &quot;only&quot;.<br/>
My Jalen is very much like that.<br/>
On Sunday, we all had plans to visit the Bays Mountain park where we<br/>
could see wolves, otters and other critters. The kids were all<br/>
excited. He knew the plan, he&#39;d even helped bake cupcakes to take<br/>
along. But when it was time to leave he didn&#39;t want to go. I knew<br/>
Trevor didn&#39;t want to watch him and it would absolutely break the<br/>
other children&#39;s hearts to not go....plus dh and I had been looking<br/>
forward to it and the weather was glorius.<br/>
So I explained that no one could stay and watch him, we were all going<br/>
and he needed to come.<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s how it is.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t listen to his feelings deeply, offer up<br/>
information that will help him transition etc... But I needed him to<br/>
get in the car and come with.<br/>
After listening to him, explaining things further and telling him<br/>
there were no other options today, he sighed and said &quot;Ok&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We all had a fabulous time, especially Jalen. It was a wonderful place<br/>
for him...I knew he&#39;d have a great time once we got him there. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to be 4 sometimes.:)<br/>
<br/>
As far as the fighting...I&#39;ve found that when I am really present with<br/>
my children, there is a much lower rate of disintigration. I can offer<br/>
up peaceful solutions before things melt down. I&#39;m better at<br/>
communicating solutions than an 8 and 4 y.o. (the two that have the<br/>
hardest time) so I feel it is my duty to help them navigate this until<br/>
they gain these skills.<br/>
Our big thing around here is that you try and solve issues without<br/>
blame, without namecalling. When it happens I say &quot;that isn&#39;t a<br/>
helpful way to solve this problem,let&#39;s focus on how everyone can get<br/>
what they need right now&quot;<br/>
If someone is being truly mean, I stop it and get the victim away from<br/>
the angry child quickly. Once I give them a hug or comfort, I talk to<br/>
the offender and let them know that if they want to harm another human<br/>
being with words or physically, they need to be far away from that<br/>
other human.<br/>
We don&#39;t have a lot of problems with fighting most of the time, if *I*<br/>
am doing my job. That doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have upset children, or<br/>
possibilities for fighting..Jalen can really get everyone going. But<br/>
if I&#39;m there with them, picking him up and hugging him when I see a<br/>
potential problem, explaining that he can&#39;t scream at someone to get<br/>
what he wants, it seems to avert most of the major fights.<br/>
<br/>
Being present, being aware of needs and personalities, knowing what<br/>
the triggers are and trying to remove them, feeding them snacks before<br/>
they act hungry etc... these are some of the tools we&#39;ve used to<br/>
encourage peaceful solutions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can I just say &quot;oh yeah&quot; to everything Ren just said?  I think she <br/>
described quite well what it&#39;s like to live with multiple children and <br/>
try to negotiate everyone&#39;s needs, and how we try to work things here as <br/>
well. For anyone who didn&#39;t get to the conference, her talk on <br/>
Unschooling a Tribe would be well worth ordering, imo.<br/>
<br/>
What I would add is that although there are times when one young child <br/>
does get carted along because there aren&#39;t stay at home solutions to be <br/>
found, that&#39;s not the end of it or just the way it is (not that Ren was <br/>
saying that, just for explicit clarification). There&#39;s more to it than <br/>
that, for us anyway, and I suspect in Ren&#39;s family as well. As Ren <br/>
talked about, there&#39;s the validating and the attempt to find solutions <br/>
that may help even if staying at home isn&#39;t one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when Sam is carted along, I try to own that responsibility rather <br/>
than displacing it onto him or the other kids. I realize that in order <br/>
to enable my other children to do something sometimes means that I&#39;ll be <br/>
putting *all* of my energy into Sam while we are there, trying to help <br/>
him stay in a comfort zone. Sometimes this falls into place like Ren <br/>
described because the outing is fun and a good fit, but it just required <br/>
an energy shift to get these spirited kids through the transition. <br/>
Sometimes, however, things do not fall into place, and Sam needs all my <br/>
energy to get through the situation gracefully, and I find that I need <br/>
to be prepared to give him that energy without being resentful that <br/>
things aren&#39;t just falling into place.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where things get tricky, too, in making sure that this is not <br/>
happening too often. In other words, making sure that Sam isn&#39;t being <br/>
put into situations that are difficult for him too often simply because <br/>
the other kids like to do something. I think it needs to be an exception <br/>
rather than a rule, kwim. We&#39;ve given up some regular activities that <br/>
the girls really enjoyed because they took such a toll on Sam. We&#39;ve had <br/>
to go back and renegotiate what everyone&#39;s needs really are, and <br/>
sometimes going to that activity is not as important as everyone&#39;s <br/>
well-being nor is it necessarily the only way to meet the girls&#39; <br/>
needs--maybe just the most obvious or expedient way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You say, &quot;Okay, I get it that you really don&#39;t want to come and I bet  <br/>
you understand that I want you to come, right?&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Yeah, but I REALLY don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You, &quot;I know you really don&#39;t want to. Are you willing to consider us  <br/>
finding something we can do to make it less of a pain for you? What  <br/>
if we stopped for special ice cream on the way back?&quot; (OR, &quot;What if  <br/>
you could take my laptop, just this once, and play on that in the car  <br/>
and while you&#39;re waiting?&quot; OR - whatever.....make it special because  <br/>
it IS an imposition. Recognize that. Thank him for being willing to  <br/>
work it out.<br/>
<br/>
Then, don&#39;t take advantage of a kid&#39;s willingness to work it out. In  <br/>
other words, make sure it works the other way sometimes, too.  <br/>
Sometimes he says, &quot;I really don&#39;t want to go,&quot; and you find someone  <br/>
else to take the other kids, you get them a ride, you put them off by  <br/>
offering THEM something else to make up for it. OR you find someone  <br/>
else to stay home with him.<br/>
