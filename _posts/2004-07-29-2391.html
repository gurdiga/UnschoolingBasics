<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565626176">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Vijay Berry Owens. I am a 32 y.o. SAHM to one daughter, <br/>
Charlotte, who is 14 months old. My husband Charles is also 32. He works <br/>
at Best Buy during the day and is a jazz musician (tenor sax) at <br/>
night. :-)<br/>
<br/>
In between diaper changes, I am starting a nonprofit group which is a <br/>
wonderful challenge.<br/>
<br/>
We live in rural central VA on 100 acres. We recently (March) moved here <br/>
from NYC, so we are still adjusting to country life. We love it here <br/>
though. It&#39;s going to be a great place to unschool. DH and I joke that <br/>
when Charlotte asks for a pony we&#39;ll just say okay. Not the answer she <br/>
would have gotten had we stayed in our 1-bedroom in NYC!<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anything else you want to know about me, please feel free to <br/>
ask. I am usually running on fumes, so I apologize in advance if any of <br/>
my posts are nonsensical. I&#39;m going to provide some unintentional <br/>
amusement with my typos I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize some of the names I see here from unschooling.com and I look <br/>
forward to learning from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>
