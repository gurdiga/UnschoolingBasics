<div id="ygrps-yiv-866097125">So have most of you read this book?  What are your thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
I found it to be highly fascinating.. but difficult to see how to <br/>
apply her wisdom attained from the Yequana, to our Western ways.  <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have worn dd2 to my body, co-sleep and <br/>
breastfed since birth- thats not a problem.  But as the kids get to <br/>
that 2 year old stage, it seems that the more I ask what she wants <br/>
all the time, the more unhappy she is.  Liedloff seemed to view child-<br/>
centeredness as the issue because what she saw was the Yequana <br/>
children being rarely the &#39;center&#39; of attention, instead the adults <br/>
were focused on doing their work in order to survive, while the <br/>
children were steeped in this real-life learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I think my dd&#39;s are looking for me to be more of a leader.  To go <br/>
about more adult- real-world activities for her to view / be apart <br/>
of.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is the article by Liedloff about &#39;Whose in control&#39;..<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html">http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The problem I am running into is that I have no problem going about <br/>
my day- but I worry that my dd&#39;s are frustrated at the lack of &#39;adult <br/>
stuff I do&#39; when what they mostly sees is A.) Me on the computer and <br/>
B.) Doing static things like dishes and laundry, etc.  Whereas the <br/>
Yequana children, while not being the &#39;center&#39; of attention, were <br/>
entrenched in real-world survival skills around them all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
So this thinking led me to this AWSOME article by Scott Noelle about <br/>
this very subject;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottnoelle.com/parenting/child-centered.htm">http://www.scottnoelle.com/parenting/child-centered.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
WOW. AWSOME... <br/>
<br/>
&quot;My first suggestion is to reclaim the positive connotation of &quot;child-<br/>
centered&quot; and accept the label proudly: &quot;I am child-centered because <br/>
I am committed to making sure my child&#39;s needs are met.&quot; Then give <br/>
him your direct attention when it feels right to you. (When you&#39;re <br/>
attuned, it won&#39;t feel right to you if it&#39;s not right for him.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, this leads me back to the question of HOW to strike that <br/>
balance- of being in tune with my child&#39;s needs and also being a <br/>
leader while giving my girls a rich environment they can learn from?</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have the first part right, but not the second part.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the book, but primitive tribes have a lot of tasks  <br/>
children can join into (*and* feel useful and competent at). They  <br/>
also have easy access to other kids for when the task no longer  <br/>
interests them.<br/>
<br/>
But that idea needs examined before it&#39;s plopped down onto our  <br/>
culture. I think the part that works is attentive parents who are  <br/>
there to help their kids and freedom to explore in safety. A tribal  <br/>
parent can explain in a way that a child will grasp fairly quickly  <br/>
since it&#39;s part of the fabric of everyone&#39;s life around them, &quot;I need  <br/>
to do this or we can&#39;t eat.&quot; That&#39;s just the way life is. But not so  <br/>
our culture.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve picked up the wrong part of what works for them. It isn&#39;t  <br/>
parents going about their lives. It&#39;s parents being there for their  <br/>
children. Working on the computer just isn&#39;t that interesting to  <br/>
kids! And it isn&#39;t something they can help with and feel they&#39;ve  <br/>
helped the family survive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I think they&#39;re frustrated at the lack of things *they* find  <br/>
interesting to do. Don&#39;t look to the book to define what they should  <br/>
find interesting! Get to know them. Be in *their* world. Run parts of  <br/>
the bigger world that you think would interest them through their lives.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simple answer: Put down the book and look to your daughter for  <br/>
answers. She&#39;s *telling* you what she needs. One of the central  <br/>
points of mindful parenting and unschooling is learning how to listen.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re out of balance because you&#39;ve defined &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;rich  <br/>
environment&quot; as &quot;Mom going about her life&quot;. A mindful unschooling  <br/>
parent reads books to them and looks for outside activities and gets  <br/>
kids together to play and says &quot;Hey, want to help me fold laundry,&quot;  <br/>
and watches TV with them and bakes cookies with them (as much as  <br/>
they&#39;re able ;-) and gets out the art stuff for creating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741412640">it seems that the more I ask what she wants <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all the time, the more unhappy she is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s western society child-centerdness.  what is it?  what do you <br/>
want?  lets do something, what would you like to do?  to eat? to <br/>
wear?  <br/>
<br/>
Children do not need to hear this, they need to believe that we, <br/>
their parents, know ourselves, what to do, wear, eat...and that we <br/>
are hear from them to teach them, to show them the ways of our <br/>
cluture and society (even if it is one we are inventing, ourselves, <br/>
as we go along!)<br/>
<br/>
My dd just turned two, and she genuinely helps me throughout the day, <br/>
doing sewing projects, building toys and furniature--she has hammered <br/>
nails and used the screwdriver correctly-- and she helps fold laundry <br/>
and if it weren&#39;t for her, the dishes would never get done.  <br/>
<br/>
In helping me with the dishes, Ani has gone from just splashing in <br/>
the water, to scooping water with various objects, to scooping from <br/>
one object to another to pouring water from cups and bowls, to <br/>
pouring from one vessle to another.  She has also gone from dropping <br/>
dishes into the sink, to now, very carefully placing each dish, one <br/>
at a time, into the dish water.  In all this time, we have broken one <br/>
glass and one very old, already chipped small plate.  And we use zero <br/>
plastic, all materials in our kitchen are real.   <br/>
<br/>
I think both of my kids know, that if mommy doesn&#39;t get her work <br/>
done, like going to the grocery store, working the garden, cleaning <br/>
the kitchen, preparing meals, we really do not eat.  It is a matter <br/>
of life and death, the work we do and I take it seriously, and they, <br/>
too, grasp the seriousness of life&#39;s necessities.  <br/>
<br/>
DDs daddy, he just doesnt know what to do with her when he tries to <br/>
play with her, because he does the thing above, &quot;what do you <br/>
want&quot; &quot;what is it, Ani, what would you like to do?&quot;  She&#39;s two, she <br/>
wants YOU to do something interesting, something that she can learn <br/>
from, something that is a rich experience.  That&#39;s why she follows me <br/>
around all day, because I do interesting stuff, and take the time to <br/>
include her in it all.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, my son, who&#39;s much older (11 next Friday!), he&#39;s not quite as <br/>
keen on watching me work any longer, but he loved to watch me when he <br/>
was a baby.  Actually, I think that&#39;s where he got his love of <br/>
musical theatre, because I thought I should be talking to him as I <br/>
worked, but I didnt know what to &quot;say&quot; to a baby about cleaning and <br/>
cooking and so on, so I just sung about everything I did, all day <br/>
long, throughout the day.  Whistle while you work?  He wasn&#39;t as <br/>
physically included in the work, but he was still with me, being a <br/>
part of the larger plan that keeps life going.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point, though, he&#39;s beginning to embark on his own vocation <br/>
and isn&#39;t as interested in my daily drudgery.  He actually said one <br/>
day, &quot;I don&#39;t need to learn how to do dishes, I&#39;m going to be rich, <br/>
and I will not have to do dishes when I am older.&quot;  Good plan, and <br/>
he&#39;s probably right.  I think he&#39;s also afraid I may ask HIM to do <br/>
some of the work, and he&#39;s learned--from schooling--that &quot;work&quot; is <br/>
not fun or importatnt; rather it is a trivial time-waster.  We&#39;re <br/>
still deschooling, in that sense, with him.  So, I don&#39;t try to make <br/>
him find my work interesting, I let him pursue his own, and support <br/>
him in his interests.  Whenever he completes a lego vehicle or new <br/>
playmobil scene, he comes to get me, and I admire his ingeuinety.  He <br/>
knows that he is welcome to be a part of what I may be doing if he <br/>
does find it interesting, and I will slow down for him, too, to <br/>
include him in the work, if that is his need or desire. <br/>
<br/>
My biggest issue is that of the larger society, a society that does <br/>
not value children, women&#39;s work, or real work, in general.  Even <br/>
among the pro-child, activist circle in which I run, many of the <br/>
mothers, when they come out to do something (support Midwives, do LLL <br/>
functions, etc), they leave their children at home.  Many times, when <br/>
I am out in public, we (me & my children) are the only people, <br/>
anywhere, with children, unless it is a place specifically FOR <br/>
children.  I believe children belong in, and should be within, the <br/>
larger society, to learn, to grow, to contribute.  <br/>
<br/>
This is, to me, the Continum Concept, applied to our modern, western <br/>
life.  <br/>

She absolutely loves to work with the cows, feed the animals, clean, take care of them.<br/>
She has been like that since she was 15 months old.<br/>

she definitely wants, or doesn&#39;t want but often leans toward &quot;nothing  <br/>
jumps out at me so anything&quot;. Probably genetic. I&#39;m the same.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;d decide to go play with her toys and draw but I can&#39;t ever  <br/>
remember her saying &quot;Let&#39;s bake cookies!&quot; or &quot;I want to paint!&quot; If it  <br/>
involved me, I&#39;d have to come up with those ideas. Definitely no  <br/>
inclination towards directing other people!<br/>

Our culture is *way* different from Yequana.  I can&#39;t observe cultures (ours<br/>

similarity that I can see is that all cultures are creations of gazillions<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, its much easier for me to &quot;project&quot; onto Morgan, who is like me <br/>
in many ways than onto Ray, who is so very different. Parenting Ray <br/>
has always involved more s-t-r-e-t-c-h-ing on my part. That&#39;s been a <br/>
good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan almost always knows what she wants to do - the other day she <br/>
was sitting on the back porch and George asked her if she wanted to <br/>
do a project and she replied: &quot;No, I&#39;m doing Nothing. Its on my <br/>
list.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Ray doesn&#39;t necessarily know what he wants to do, but he often knows <br/>
if he wants to be social, be alone, be with a group, be with one <br/>
person.... The specific &quot;what&quot; isn&#39;t as important to him as the <br/>
social environment. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our culture is *way* different from Yequana.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. I think it can be really valuble to look to other cultures for <br/>
ideas - its a way of &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; of our own culture. <br/>
But I don&#39;t think its helpful to climb into someone else&#39;s box <br/>
wholesale, as it were.<br/>
