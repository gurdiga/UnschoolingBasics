<div id="ygrps-yiv-638877961">Hi to all that responded to my freaking out.  I needed that support, which<br/>
like I said before is not available to me or I just don&#39;t know where to<br/>
find locals with the same mentality.  In my heart, I know all this, just<br/>
hard to keep focused when there isn&#39;t enough support.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the advise!<br/>
Loretta  P.S.  Is there an unschooling convention happening this year?<br/>
<br/>
