However I could easily be wrong about his recent death. I remember when<br/>
everyone thought Sean Connery was deceased, and he had to go on Letterman to<br/>
show that the rumors were &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot; as the old joke goes.<br/>

I remember in college being disturbed by the death of Jean-Paul Sartre.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d assumed he&#39;d already been dead for a long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL  That reminds me of the movie Ed Wood (w/Johnny Depp).  Martin <br/>
Landau plays Bela Legosi in the movie and every time Ed Wood is <br/>
pitching a movie to a studio and he says it&#39;s staring Bela they always <br/>
look puzzled and ask, &quot;Isn&#39;t he dead?&quot;  Too funny.  Great movie too!<br/>
