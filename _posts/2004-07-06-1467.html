Your new babe sounds a lot like my DS.  I don&#39;t have your experience with <br/>
daughters as DS is my first, but he was definitely an in-arms kind of kid.  He <br/>
nursed all the time (still nurses about 3-5 times a day), slept in our bed <br/>
(still does at 17 months) and has always been high needs.  Get a sling if you don&#39;t <br/>
have one already.  That would be my main advice to you!  It was a life saver.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545903893">hi~ im jesika. my hubby mike and i have a 9m boy named<br/>
echo. i m very new to all this, but i do know that i<br/>
was planning on homeschooling echo- no public school!<br/>
i didnt even know there was such a thing as<br/>
unschooling until recently. i found out about a<br/>
discussion here in austin for plans for a commune-ish<br/>
place based on unschooling. so we will be in limbo<br/>
soon so i thought i&#39;d check it out..... somehow i<br/>
ended up here...so i am very interested in learning<br/>
from everyone...thanks~ jesika<br/>
