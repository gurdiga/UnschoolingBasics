<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358675743">Hi all,<br/>
Just joined the list a few days ago and wanted to say a quick hello.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Maryland and am the mother to three children ages 3, 5, and 7. <br/>
<br/>
Growing up, I spent 8 years in Europe -- 4 in the U.K. and 4 in Spain.  <br/>
I went to a variety of schools ranging from a formal large spanish <br/>
school to a small eclectic international school. <br/>
<br/>
I homeschool because I don&#39;t trust large bureaurcratic systems, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to replicate my experience of doing it only for the grades, I don&#39;t <br/>
want school to replace family, and because of other lifestyle choices <br/>
related to health and diet.<br/>
<br/>
I have worked with a curriculum called Enki that appealed to me based on <br/>
its foundation.  While I still use some of their materials, I got stuck <br/>
in the trap of losing my own creativity as I try to implement this <br/>
&quot;expert&quot; approach that uses creativity -- how ironic.    I am on several <br/>
homeschooling lists but tend to get the feeling I am once again copying <br/>
others and losing my own sense of connection -- so I decided to balance <br/>
things by joining an unschooling list and listening and learning. <br/>
<br/>
Glad this is an beginners list and look forward to seeing what unfolds <br/>
... I am a bit nervous as I don&#39;t think that I am the maverick (don&#39;t <br/>
know if that is the right word) that it takes to be a true unschooler.  <br/>
My image is that unschoolers are willing to buck all conventions -- how <br/>
ironic because I am quite unconventional in many areas of my life but I <br/>
also so crave some social conformity and acceptance. <br/>
<br/>
So I look forward to dispelling some old fears and preconceptions and <br/>
continue the path of finding my family&#39;s own center and path,<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Deborah</div>

What is schooling like in Spain?  We have had 2 exchange students from<br/>
Spain.  With one, we got into some very heated debates over<br/>
homeschooling, I didn&#39;t even try to discuss unschooling with him.<br/>
Just curious<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431042676">Hi Kathy,<br/>
Here&#39;s what I remember -- but it&#39;s a pretty limited memory.   It&#39;s not a <br/>
fair characterization of the spanish schools as we were foreigners -- <br/>
but it does give a sense of what it&#39;s like to go to school as a <br/>
foreigner anywhere ...<br/>
<br/>
We were put in the spanish schools without speaking spanish -  it was a <br/>
very difficult experience for me and my brother -- I was glad to have <br/>
learned spanish but I think I could have done it a different way.  In my <br/>
first school, as soon as I learned spanish well enough  I told my <br/>
teacher my mother needed us at home and we skipped school every <br/>
afternoon for months ... the only reason we were caught by my mother is <br/>
that we were walking around town and she saw us.  We tried to convince <br/>
her it was a holiday but she didn&#39;t believe us .... (chuckle)<br/>
<br/>
Then I was in a small eclectic international school called Yes and then <br/>
called Zoon.  I was in a class with three children and their mother.  <br/>
That&#39;s where I learned to hate art --it was the first subject I got a <br/>
poor grade in.  We had a lot of free time and all hung out in the living <br/>
room of the school.  Some pretty laid back teachers as well ...<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to a large spanish school --  we had to take two public <br/>
buses, wear uniforms, and the other children were mean to us.  My <br/>
brother still didn&#39;t speak much spanish and every day the teachers would <br/>
bring him to me in my class cause he was crying.  I remember in Math <br/>
that they divide differently than I was taught -- (they just do the long <br/>
division going up rather than down).  It was a frustrating experience <br/>
cause math was the only thing I could learn because there was still a <br/>
language barrier.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I went to a really cool international school that was quite hard. I <br/>
remember learning algebra and loving it.  I also remember having to sing <br/>
in front of my class and getting a poor grade -- very embarrassing for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking Kathy --  it was a very formative experience - quite <br/>
liberating and something I wouldn&#39; t have done in the States.  When I <br/>
returned, I quickly started following all the rules and getting good <br/>
grades.  Interesting enough, when I returned to the states they didn&#39;t <br/>
know where to place me.  They tested me and placed me two grade ahead <br/>
and three grades ahead in math.  It wasn&#39;t that I had the knowledge to <br/>
be placed ahead (well I did in math) - I had the thinking skills and <br/>
processing skills.  So despite not learning content in Spain due to the <br/>
language, I sure learned something. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving to the U.S. folks here,<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Deborah<br/>
