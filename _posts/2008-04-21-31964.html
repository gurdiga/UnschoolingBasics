<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059507152">I am trying to stay as close to my growing daughter as possible. I<br/>
find that this is hard because I have so many outside influences<br/>
telling me who she should be and how a &quot;normal&quot; 11 y/o should act,<br/>
etc. When she was little I just ignored people and basically parented<br/>
her how she needed me to. As she gets older I find this harder and<br/>
harder. She is awesome but so different from other kids her age. I<br/>
know that I shouldn&#39;t compare her and I definitely shouldn&#39;t compare<br/>
her to schooled kids or schooled at home kids.<br/>
I am worried that she is getting depressed. She has been very moody<br/>
for the past year, getting moodier. I am not sure if this is hormonal<br/>
or if their is anything I can do. She gets really moody and distant<br/>
after hanging out with her coop friends. After a few days she&#39;ll be<br/>
lively again and we&#39;ll talk. She says that her friends have changed<br/>
and they complain about their parents all the time. She says that they<br/>
aren&#39;t fun any more. She wants to play imaginative games and they want<br/>
to &quot;hang out&quot; and talk about stuff. But at the same time she won&#39;t<br/>
hang out with the younger kids in coop that still like to play those<br/>
games. She has joined in on the age segregation that happened this<br/>
past year. I don&#39;t like it at all. In fact I tried to voice my<br/>
concerns at co-op last year when others talked about the age split. I<br/>
have talked to my dd about this. She goes along with things because<br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to be excluded.<br/>
The other concern is we have had yet another family tell me that they<br/>
don&#39;t want to be friends with us because of my parenting. She said<br/>
that I allow me kids to watch tv shows that she doesn&#39;t approve of and<br/>
my kids mention things that she doesn&#39;t want her kids to find out<br/>
about. The exact incident was; my dd (11) said that something looked<br/>
like sex gel. And then told her kids (10 and 12) what sex gel was for<br/>
when they asked. At some point they told their mom. She said that my<br/>
kids were too worldly for her kids. I asked if she felt this was an on<br/>
going problem. She said that she didn&#39;t want to chance it so isn&#39;t&#39;<br/>
interested in hanging out with our family anymore. This really sucks,<br/>
as her dd 5 and my ds 5 are best friends. I haven&#39;t said anything to<br/>
either of my kids because I am hoping that she&#39;ll come around. BUT<br/>
this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened. Several families has<br/>
declined friendship with us because I allow my kids &quot;too much<br/>
freedom&quot;. It has been an ongoing issue for years. My kids are not<br/>
crazy or crass or inappropriate (any more that I have heard from other<br/>
kids). I just don&#39;t know what to do!<br/>
It is really frustrating because I don&#39;t judge their parenting. I<br/>
don&#39;t say I don&#39;t want to be friends with your family because you<br/>
restrict your kids too much for my tastes. I try and be consciensious<br/>
and respect of their ways.<br/>
<br/>
I have a really hard time articulating things, so I am sorry that this<br/>
is probably really disjointed. I am not re-reading this as the baby<br/>
needs me so forgive typos etc<br/>

I don&#39;t have the &quot;answer&quot; - but I did find it helps a lot to work out  <br/>

work well. Even my now-17 yo still likes to play with younger kids  <br/>
quite often.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe introduce her to role-playing games such as dungeons and  <br/>

imaginative play. This is also a good time for her to read lots of  <br/>
science fiction and/or fantasy books - maybe start a book discussion  <br/>
group. Maybe join a re-enactment group such as the SCA or a civil war  <br/>
living history group. Maybe she&#39;d like to take acting classes or  <br/>
audition for a community theater production.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us stop playing kid-like pretend games as we hit our teens,  <br/>
and some girls, especially, even earlier. But, some kids really love  <br/>
it and seem to need it much longer than others, and it really helps  <br/>
their mood and outlook on life when they get enough imaginative play!<br/>
<br/>
My second child needed it, loved it, a whole lot! She&#39;s an actress -  <br/>
still gets lots of pretend time! These days, when she&#39;s not in a show,  <br/>
she starts to get sort of moody and down. So - she&#39;s 20 years old and  <br/>
still has that need!<br/>
<br/>
Remember - support her interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604713209">Hi Faith,<br/>
<br/>
My ds is only 9.5, but we have the same problem with others deciding that we<br/>
are just ³too out there² to be friends with. As of right now, he has not a<br/>
single kid he can call and play with. Even the neighbors (all schooled). It<br/>
took us a while, but we basically found new people to meet. He is playing on<br/>
a soccer team for the first time. There are 2 teams with ³older² boys that<br/>
play each other each game ­ so he should get to know those 19 other boys<br/>
pretty well. He joined a boys dance class which has 4-5 other boys. We are<br/>
trying to go on more field trips with other homeschoolers (and I am ignoring<br/>
whether I like the parents). We are members of a bike club, and he is trying<br/>
to get other parents in club to bring their kids so he has someone to ride<br/>
with. This is just what we have found so far. Don¹t know any of these will<br/>
produce friends for him, but they make him happy right now.<br/>
<br/>
What can your daughter try that is with a new group of people? Maybe<br/>
something which is more activity oriented and less age oriented. That way<br/>
she can meet younger kids to play with and older kids to hand out and talk<br/>
about sex gel with (not at same time probably though :-).<br/>
<br/>
In Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107081051">My son is 11 and he is still very much into playing.He is the <br/>
second oldest in our homeschooling group which ranges in age from 6-<br/>
12.There is a lot of playing games and pokemon discussion.He does <br/>
mostly play with younger kids except for one 12 yr old who likes <br/>
games and playing just as much.<br/>
  I have had people tell me how he needs to start growing up and <br/>
acting his age. I look at other 10-12 yr olds and I see kids that <br/>
can&#39;t stand their parents or siblings,whose friends are all <br/>
important. The parent child bond appears to be broken.If that is <br/>
what &quot;normal&quot; children do then we will stay abnormal! <br/>
  In our group there is one 12 yr old girl and she is a bit aloof <br/>
with the other kids,but that might just be her nature, or maybe she <br/>
is going through something similar. They do travel alot so she hasn&#39;t <br/>
really spent a lot of time with the other kids to make any <br/>
connections. She has joined in a play production that was written by <br/>
one of the kids though, and that has seemed to help her be part of <br/>
the group.  She is still very comfortable plunking down on her mom&#39;s <br/>
lap for some cuddly time which I think is so amazingly wonderful <br/>
since most school aged 12 ys olds try very hard to act like the  <br/>
don&#39;t have parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210356482">I would definitely agree on trying to do something with people of <br/>
various ages... watching infants at church was the only thing I <br/>
liked, besides sports when I was 12-16 or so. I liked puppetry too! I <br/>
was one who NEVER fit. I never talked on the phone, gossiped, etc. I <br/>
was NOT imaginative in that I hated role playing but once I found sci-<br/>
fi-fantasy it did help me adjust to the world more and be less <br/>
depressed as a teen. I even started taking classes to volunteer at <br/>
the hospital. I wanted to be around infants as much as possible. Old <br/>
people scared me but I know some teens my age loved going to nursing <br/>
homes and doing projects with them, playing games, putting on plays. <br/>
I was an extremely shy teen and so my mother stuck by my side alot <br/>
and that helped me adjust to things I wanted to do but wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
do by myself. So try and think of what she can do and how to adjust, <br/>
not what she can&#39;t to enjoy herself :)<br/>
I know you do, as most people on here seem to. Just a reminder :)<br/>
<br/>
And I wanted to let you know I can relate to a degree about people <br/>
not wanting to be friends with you and your kids. We have just signed <br/>
my son (almsot 4) up for soccer and our fear was that the parents <br/>
would make it known to their children that they should not play with <br/>
our son. So far we have only been to one practice, so we will have to <br/>
see hwo things go. We have done nothing wrong but people don&#39;t like <br/>
us for various reasons (not being silent about injustices, not being <br/>
rich enough to live here, not thinking kids have to be in the best <br/>
schools to succeed, etc.) My son has never been schooled outside of <br/>
our family, besides a montesorri camp. He has not had any friends his <br/>
age either. We have had run-ins at the park but for the most part we <br/>
don&#39;t fit in and our son may have suffered as a result, maybe not.  <br/>
Even Dh&#39;s family has turned against us for various reasons through <br/>
the past yrs. Long story :) So I don&#39;t have any pointers for finding <br/>
solutions. But despite everything we have been through, I do think <br/>
you should stick to your guns when you feel the need. I don&#39;t regret <br/>
any of our decisions. Maybe one day people can live together and show <br/>
more love and tolerance. Or we should all find a way to have a <br/>
community together, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

More seriously, I wanted to chime in with all the suggestions to <br/>
find people of different ages as possible friends - not just older <br/>
and younger kids, but adults too. My stepson (14) has more adult <br/>
friends than kid-friends these days and part of the reason for that <br/>
is similar to what the OP posted - kids his age just don&#39;t have much <br/>
in common with him anymore. He doesn&#39;t want to stand around <br/>
complaining about his parents (and what would he complain about? <br/>
that we didn&#39;t have enough black tape for his new spear? yeah, the <br/>
other kids could really relate to that...) or break rules just for <br/>
the sake of breaking them.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking in terms of activities is a good idea, too. Its how adults <br/>
make friends, for the most part. <br/>

<br/>
My daughter is 11, too.<br/>

 &gt;She wants to play imaginative games and they want<br/>
 &gt;to &quot;hang out&quot; and talk about stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have noticed a split between girls of this age that we know also- <br/>
around 11/12. Some are &quot;growing up&quot; fast - flirting with boys, dressing <br/>
to show off their bodies, gossiping, etc. My daughter is not there <br/>
either, and sometimes feels left out by girls she used to play with. <br/>
This is really painful for me to observe- though I think a lot of it is <br/>
because it reminds me so much of myself at that age and situations in <br/>
which I felt very uncomfortable at school. A lot of listening is needed <br/>
and seeking out of comfortable situations. Girls are very different from <br/>
each other physically at this age- I think that has a lot to do with it. <br/>
I am trying to see that as okay and not judge the other girls or their <br/>
parents- some of it seems due to development and personality in addition <br/>
to parenting style in my observation. My daughter spends a lot of time <br/>
with her cousins- one a year younger, one a year older. They still play <br/>
and play- they spent the day Friday outside playing on the trampoline <br/>
and going on safari with an umbrella and picnic basket- they sew and <br/>
draw a lot- they have been making very cute bears and slippers. I think <br/>
the older cousin probably acts quite differently around other friends. <br/>
We do have a nice group of kids still who aren&#39;t as &quot;mature&quot;. I am <br/>
organizing a girls group that meets weekly that does different <br/>
activities each week- so far this spring we have baked bread, sewed <br/>
stuffed bears, and today we are meeting at a park- the girls also just <br/>
play a lot. The reason that we meet as girls only is due to that strong <br/>
preference by my daughter and the other girls.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;She said that my<br/>
 &gt;kids were too worldly for her kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone said this in relation to choices we were making- I think it was <br/>
allowing my kids to read comic books- Calvin and Hobbes, and Garfield. <br/>
Her kids would come over and spend the whole time reading comics- she <br/>
stopped calling us to get together after a while. I have also suspected <br/>
that other parents have chosen to curtail relationships due to this- <br/>
especially one waldorf homeschooling family. I actually would prefer to <br/>
hear it directly- wondering why a family doesn&#39;t call or avoids getting <br/>
together is more confusing- though it is still painful and awkward. I <br/>
have needed to tell other parents that my kids weren&#39;t interested in <br/>
playing with their kids for one reason or another, too. It is so <br/>
difficult to find the right way to say it and feelings seem to be hurt <br/>
even when I am careful. The families we are around really range in their <br/>
parenting styles and their choices. I think my kids have learned more or <br/>
less to be generally &quot;appropriate&quot; as they are 11 and 14, but it feels <br/>
kind of stilted and not so much fun to watch ourselves all the time so <br/>
as not to alienate or offend. I doubt my son does this around his <br/>
friends but certainly does around parents. This is really all tricky- <br/>
but my kids need people to be with so we try and try. I feel really <br/>
anxious at times about certain things that I am pretty sure others will <br/>
be judgmental about- mostly just avoiding the subject works though <br/>
sometimes I am inspired to explain myself and sometimes regret it. It is <br/>
like we are hiding part of who we are quite often and it doesn&#39;t always <br/>
feel so good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218903017">a big thank you to everyone. I am still frustrated and feel like I am<br/>
failing in some ways but I feel some support. We actually looked into<br/>
the SCA because it appeals to everyone in the family in different<br/>
ways. My dd has been &quot;hanging out&quot; predominately with boys as they are<br/>
&quot;easier&quot; to understand and relate to~~say dd. She has recently started<br/>
basketball and football (in the neighborhood) since we moved. She has<br/>
also asked about starting a book descussion group as the one at the<br/>
library isn&#39;t a good match, they put kids in age groups and not by<br/>
books they like. She was stuck reading &quot;the cricket in times square&quot;<br/>
and &quot;stuart little&quot; books I read to her when she was really small. I<br/>
am not sure how to go about it but I am thinking towards it. A friend<br/>
suggested a kids theater in town that I hadn&#39;t heard of, we had a bad<br/>
experience with the other one so we plan to try this out at the next<br/>
audition.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that the neighborhood stuff works out because I have totally<br/>
quit that co-op. And it is really firm decision as I just got a new<br/>
post with all the new rules and now the classes are compulsory and<br/>
there is 4 different age segregate groups! (including pre-school) My<br/>
dd is quite distraught over this as these kids have been her friends<br/>
for the past two years. She wants me to make play-dates with these<br/>
kids for her but their parents don&#39;t like me/the way I parent and<br/>
won&#39;t. I can&#39;t really figure out a way to break that to her. I also<br/>
suspect that some of the parents don&#39;t like her, but I would never<br/>
suggest that to her. She is a strong personality. But I know several<br/>
adults that are very similar to her and they are amazing people. I<br/>
don&#39;t want her to change just because she wants friends Now.<br/>
<br/>
I have been feeling really bad lately that I don&#39;t fit in. Not for<br/>
myself because I don&#39;t even like these people but my kids are<br/>
suffering. I am trying to figure some stuff out for myself. I started<br/>
reading this Byron Katie book which is what helped me to realize that<br/>
I don&#39;t even like these people. I was felling like there was something<br/>
wrong with me because I couldn&#39;t get them to like me, lol. There just<br/>
might be loads &quot;wrong&quot; with me but I just don&#39;t care to be around<br/>
these negative, controlling people.<br/>
Please feel free to send more wonderful suggestions and positive<br/>
energy. I wish I had a chance to met folks like you guys in real life!<br/>

&gt;  My second child needed it, loved it, a whole lot! She&#39;s an actress -<br/>
&gt;  still gets lots of pretend time! These days, when she&#39;s not in a show,<br/>
&gt;  she starts to get sort of moody and down. So - she&#39;s 20 years old and<br/>
&gt;  still has that need!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Remember - support her interests.<br/>

reading this Byron Katie book which is what helped me to realize that<br/>
I don&#39;t even like these people. I was felling like there was something<br/>
wrong with me because I couldn&#39;t get them to like me, lol. There just<br/>
might be loads &quot;wrong&quot; with me but I just don&#39;t care to be around<br/>
these negative, controlling people.~~<br/>

One of my favorite sayings is &quot;It is better to be hated for who you<br/>
are, than loved for who you are not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are people out there you will connect with and make positive<br/>
lifelong friendships. You have to be willing to CREATE the space for<br/>
that connection sometimes, by starting a new group or reaching out in<br/>
a new way rather than trying to fit into groups that already exist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121524519">we have been talking about this. we are going to the one next month in<br/>
New England because our relatives are up there as well. I did go to<br/>
the UWWG but didn&#39;t met anyone really. We had a great time anyway. I<br/>
am feeling much better about things. I quit that co-op just in time<br/>
:-) They have just come out with a huge list of rules including age<br/>
seg and compulse classes. I think I&#39;d like to start my own group after<br/>
I have relaxed a few weeks. I am sure I&#39;ll post some suggestions when<br/>
I am ready for that adventure. I think my kids need time to shift<br/>
gears from that as well.<br/>

I&#39;m looking forward to making a few badges/buttons with Max. My 12 year <br/>
old, Duncan, will be hosting the Konichiwa funshop---everything <br/>
Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee you&#39;ll meet me and Ren. We&#39;re loud, often together, and <br/>
pretty hard to miss. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rue will be there too---her quiet little self, so you&#39;ll have to *look* <br/>
for her. You won&#39;t miss her husband, Jon, though---he *more* than makes <br/>
up for Rue&#39;s gentle, quiet nature. &lt;g&gt; My husband is the quiet one of <br/>
our two-some, but NOT when he&#39;s with Jon Kream!<br/>
<br/>
Deb Rossing, you&#39;ll be there, right?<br/>
<br/>
Marji&#39;s a sure thang. And Joy Karim and Cris Trainor too.<br/>
<br/>
Laurie-alohabun said she&#39;ll be there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be a party! &lt;g&gt; I can&#39;t wait to meet you!<br/>

The cool winterpark gathering is just ONE of the many opportunities to <br/>
meet batches of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
This month, we have three: Next weekend there&#39;s the Toronto Unschooling <br/>
Conference in Canada---May 9-11. Then there&#39;s the New England <br/>
Unschooling Conference in Peabody, MA, as well as the LIFEisGood <br/>
Conference in Vancouver, WA. Both are on Memorial Day weekend on <br/>
opposite sides of the US.<br/>
<br/>
The *last* Live and Learn Unschooling Conference is in September near <br/>
Asheville, NC.<br/>
<br/>
Not Back to School Camps---for the teens only---are in August and <br/>
September. In Oregon and Vermont.<br/>
<br/>
The Pura Vida Unschooling Conference is being planned in Costa Rica in <br/>
December.<br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s planning her ARGH gatherings now---she&#39;s looking at one in the <br/>
spring and one in the fall, but dates aren&#39;t set yet.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s little in the dead of summer (when the rest of the world <br/>
travels), but GREAT things planned all year (when most kids are stuck <br/>
in school).<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you at one of these!<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>

<br/>
What I say after Jalen knocks the laundry over for the 10th time.;)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, seriously...it&#39;s a gathering of unschoolers or unschool curious<br/>
here in Eastern TN. We had our first small gathering last fall and<br/>
really enjoyed it! We&#39;ve decided to expand into an outdoor venue,<br/>
which at this point is close to Lake Wautauga.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called Sugar Hollow Mountain retreat and we plan to take over the<br/>
entire site for our next gathering. The idea is to keep it simple and<br/>
inexpensive. I think the entire cost for three days and two nights is<br/>
going to be about $160 per family. No registration, bring your own<br/>
food. The fee covers your lodging which might be a room shared with<br/>
another family...but it depends on requests and size and space<br/>
available. All lodges have bathrooms, running water, kitchens etc...<br/>
all the comforts of home.<br/>
<br/>
There are hiking trails, an outdoor stage, a nice size conference<br/>
center for the night owls to hang out and for fun workshops etc...<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind ARGH is that all participants contribute their<br/>
ideas..no speakers or agenda other than what we make it!<br/>
<br/>
There is a Yahoo list for anyone wanting to stay informed as this<br/>
event develops: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutodidacticRadicalGatheringofHomeschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutodidacticRadicalGatheringofHomeschoolers/</a><br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the baby stages but wanting this to become a twice yearly<br/>
gathering. It will be smaller than a conference, topping out at around<br/>
100 people or so. Oh, and tents spaces will be available at a lesser<br/>
rate if people don&#39;t care about having a lodge room. Tent campers will<br/>
still have access to the lodge bathrooms and kitchens etc...<br/>
