Thanks, Ren! That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m curious about showing religion and  <br/>
spirituality and all that stuff to my kids, but I&#39;m not sure how to, so I had at  <br/>
one time wondered about Veggie Tales. I am a Pantheist myself, raised by a  <br/>
serious Atheist and a Nontheist/Agnostic. I was raised to be a dabbler, have  <br/>
been Pagan and at age 10, due to my severe guilt of being a white girl that has  <br/>
a 100% German background, I decided to become Jewish ;) Pantheism seems to be <br/>
a  good thing for me - my heart is happy, as am I. So I do some things, and <br/>
discuss  holidays with the kids as they come, I discuss the idea of being <br/>
&quot;culturally  Christian&quot; (why we have a tree and do some Easter things) and try to <br/>
keep the  discussion open so we can talk, but I fear I am almost keeping them <br/>
from  things...No, that&#39;s not the right way to put it. I want to &quot;teach&quot; (lol, <br/>
show,  really, or have available) stuff about other religions, I answer <br/>
questions as  they come, such as &quot;Why does that lady have that on he head?&quot; kinda <br/>
stuff,  but...I guess I&#39;m just curious how this might be shown in other <br/>
families. I  mainly just try to remain open and talkative, kwim? Sorry for the novela <br/>
length  post, lol...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We owned many videos, I still have a silly sing along (no mention of God<br/>
anywhere in the silly songs with Larry) and Dave and the giant pickle in my<br/>
collection.<br/>
We borrowed first, then decided which we were okay with. Dave&#39;s just too<br/>
ding dang funny to let go of!<br/>
I treat bible talk just as I would someone making reference to any other<br/>
mythology book - we&#39;ve watched countless things that refer to the Iliad and<br/>
even Chaucer&#39;s Canterbury Tales. The Bible and THE God they discussed didn&#39;t<br/>
carry inordinate weight, because it just doesn&#39;t in our life. It was great<br/>
fodder for conversation and silly music. By the time the stories were over,<br/>
the kids were gone on to something else and missed the little wrap-up bible<br/>
verse/morality spiel at the end. Fine by me, either way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a woman of strong faith. It&#39;s a whirly-swirly faith that can&#39;t be<br/>
contained or specified. Definitely a theist (I&#39;d prefer to be polytheistic<br/>
over monotheistic - I like the idea of a team approach :::vbg:::). The only<br/>
absolute in my heart is there are no absolutes. I&#39;m not offended by others&#39;<br/>
beliefs, even if they aren&#39;t mine. I like to try on ideas like new clothes.<br/>
I&#39;m as in love with Catholicism for my need of ancient ritual as I am with<br/>
the UU faith for it&#39;s freedoms. Neither meet my universal need to connect,<br/>
so I take that on my own self-- the world a la carte :)<br/>
<br/>
It was cool to introduce these cultural stories to my kids (I really did<br/>
like Esther, too) and have discussions about them, free from the feeling of<br/>
*have to* when it comes to personal individual beliefs. (I think that *have<br/>
to* when it comes to church/faith/beliefs is what destroys our individual<br/>
relationship with the principles behind church/faith/beliefs -- whatever<br/>
happened to free will?? :::g::: alas, I&#39;ll take *that* discussion to my<br/>
blog)<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, they may be offensive to some. They weren&#39;t to me.<br/>
I still think *everyone* should hear the I Love My Lips song on YouTube!  :)<br/>
It&#39;s silly!<br/>
