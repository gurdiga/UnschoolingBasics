<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289070285">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
My son is 26mo, and spends most of his time at home naked. He&#39;s<br/>
learning to use the toilet and is quite thrilled with the whole<br/>
experience. He&#39;s particularly interested in his bottom and explores<br/>
that area with his fingers alot.<br/>
<br/>
This is significantly bothering my husband to the point where<br/>
yesterday he declared that we need to keep DS in diapers or underwear<br/>
at all times. I disagree, partly because DS will stick his fingers<br/>
underneath those anyway so it&#39;s pointless, but also because I don&#39;t<br/>
want to force him to do anything. I love that he&#39;s so interested in<br/>
exploring his body and I don&#39;t want to give him any complexes about it.<br/>
<br/>
What also bothers my husband is that our son used to love to wash his<br/>
hands and would do so at the mere suggestion. Now he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
and usually doesn&#39;t after going to the toilet, even though we&#39;ve<br/>
always modeled that. He&#39;ll also play with his bottom during a meal and<br/>
then go right back to eating with both hands. I keep a solution around<br/>
(water, vinegar, tea tree oil) that I used to use for diaper changes<br/>
around to clean his hands whenever possible, which he doesn&#39;t mind and<br/>
actually helps with. This is good enough for me but not DH.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried explaining that there are germs in your intestines and in<br/>
poop that you wouldn&#39;t want to get in your mouth because they can make<br/>
you sick -- but of course he hasn&#39;t gotten sick so clearly Mom doesn&#39;t<br/>
know what she&#39;s talking about. I&#39;ve also tried explaining that it&#39;s<br/>
perfectly fine to play with your bottom -- the bathtub is a great<br/>
place to do that, and so is using toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m left wondering... how important is hygiene between poop and<br/>
your mouth anyway? I mean I know we&#39;ve all been taught that it&#39;s bad<br/>
and I know that it&#39;s a major source of disease pathogens, but I also<br/>
believe that my two year old does not have the diseases that<br/>
historically get carried this way. I think that e.coli (not the really<br/>
scary one) can be found in your intestines but I don&#39;t know the<br/>
difference between that one and the one that was in the spinach scare<br/>
recently. So I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re just blowing this out of proportion<br/>
or not, and if not, I don&#39;t know how to communicate better with my son<br/>
about washing his hands between bottom time and any other time (mouth<br/>
time, playing time, etc). I&#39;ve been hoping that over time he will<br/>
understand more but since it bugs DH so much (he&#39;s not very unschooly,<br/>
yet another thing we&#39;re working on) I don&#39;t know how to approach it<br/>
for now.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560167749">One of the main causes of ecoli is improper washing<br/>
after defecating.  PLease don&#39;t take this one lightly<br/>
as a 26mo will mostly likely succumb to the Ecoli.  I<br/>
am a Vegan, and mostly raw and have researched much<br/>
about Ecoli after the scares in the past months with<br/>
vegetables.  Check out CDC.gov. or even webmd.<br/>
When it comes to life and death there is not room for<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234566345">***So I&#39;m left wondering... how important is hygiene between poop and<br/>
your mouth anyway? ***<br/>
<br/>
Reasonably important I think, but I wouldn&#39;t be too scared over it.   We&#39;ve <br/>
all heard stories of babies putting their hands in their poopy diapers and <br/>
having a taste or doing some finger painting or whatever.   And those of us <br/>
with cats probably have at least one disgusting litter pan story. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you think about all the times, out in public when you picked his <br/>
blanket (or binky or a toy) up off the ground or off a restaurant floor and <br/>
gave it a shake and handed it back to him, the potential for hand to mouth <br/>
contact with germs is pretty high.<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t know how to communicate better with my son<br/>
about washing his hands between bottom time and any other time (mouth<br/>
time, playing time, etc). ***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll understand better as he gets older.  Does he mind if you give his <br/>
hands a quick wipe with a washcloth?<br/>
<br/>
Would he like to have a finger bowl at the table?  Maybe if you all had one. <br/>
I think finger bowls were traditionally for after a meal (I&#39;m not of the <br/>
finger bowl crowd, I&#39;m of the finger licking crowd) but if you all had one <br/>
maybe he&#39;d think it was fun.   Maybe not a good idea if you have a valuable <br/>
antique table, though.<br/>
<br/>
Would he like to wash his hands more if he could just splash in a bowl or <br/>
basin of warm water?   Maybe you could put a step stool in the bathroom or <br/>
somewhere, with a towel under it &lt;g&gt; and put a little pan of mildly soapy <br/>
water there for him to splash in.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d like some of those pre-moistened wipes that he could help himself <br/>
to.  (And then, be prepared for him to help himself to a lot of them.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
The same e. coli that was in spinach is in our intestine - the problem is when too much gets put in there - that&#39;s the part that is disease causing.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if something else is going on as well - like is his bottom itchy.  Not sure what else could be going on down there to draw his attention so (beyond just mere exploring).<br/>
<br/>
I only know what I learned in my college classes that those pathogens in any feces are dangerous and can contaminate.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s not &#39;safe&#39; to be in flood water (could be sewage in there - which contains feces).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I did learn that our urine (majority of time) is sterile.  So, I stopped worrying so much about the peepee accidents - just cleaned up for smell.  Was MORE careful with the poopy accidents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our son is a bit older (4) but he also likes exploring and we went<br/>
through a period where his hands were *constantly* inside his<br/>
underwear. Our concern was that he was playing with his bottom and<br/>
then touching his mouth/eyes, computer, doorknobs, counters, food,<br/>
etc. We feel this isn&#39;t hygienic. And he also did it in public quite a<br/>
bit as well - at restaurants, the playground,  etc. We&#39;ve encouraged<br/>
him to use the privacy of his bedroom or the bathroom and then gently<br/>
reminded him to please wash his hands afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about germs and the human body and he has a fairly good<br/>
understanding of the need to keep hands clean. We&#39;ve also talked about<br/>
manners and public vs private activities. (There are many good<br/>
children&#39;s books on these subjects). We&#39;ve tried to carefully balance<br/>
this information with his need to explore and we&#39;ve been mindful to<br/>
treat it as a natural, healthy thing and not implant the idea that<br/>
certain body parts are dirty or off-limits.<br/>
<br/>
Our children enjoy being naked as well, but due to our very nosy,<br/>
conservative neighbors and our kids inclination to run to the<br/>
door/window and look out, we&#39;ve had to make underwear a must. They<br/>
don&#39;t have to be fully dressed and they&#39;re welcome to stay in pj&#39;s if<br/>
that&#39;s what they prefer, but at the very least they must have<br/>
underwear on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d go for wipes or a hand-sanitizer - which it sounds like you&#39;re <br/>
doing. Mo went through a phase of not wanting to wash her hands. We <br/>
had boxes of wipes all over the house, in the vehicles, in the <br/>
workshops... they were just everywhere for awhile. I still try to <br/>
keep a bottle of hand sanitizer around for times when the cats bring <br/>
us &quot;presents&quot;. Mo loves to pick up the little dead animals and look <br/>
at them and feed the snake with them, but doesn&#39;t understand why she <br/>
should wash her hands afterwards. She&#39;ll do the sanitizer, though. <br/>
<br/>
We had a brief period of UTIs with my stepson when he was little - <br/>
we had an outhouse at the time but no handwashing set up right there <br/>
next to it, so he wasn&#39;t washing his hands after a poop. Certainly <br/>
not the kind of crisis that e.coli can (potetially) be, but it was <br/>
uncomfortable for him - and for us, too, since he&#39;s a big-time <br/>
extrovert and had to tell Everyone that he had &quot;an infection in my <br/>
penis&quot;. The joys of parenting!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are actually different strains of e. coli, just like there are<br/>
different types of dogs, some of which are more dangerous than others<br/>
(just like with dogs). Any strain can be dangerous when the quantity is<br/>
large enough, though, I think. Pathogens are also more dangerous when<br/>
you&#39;re already weakened by some other disease, immunosuppressants or<br/>
other conditions (e.g., pregnancy). For an accurate risk assessment of<br/>
bacteria of all sorts you could try reading the studies about the<br/>
bacteria concerned on PubMed (often you can only read the abstracts,<br/>
but they tend to offer enough info). <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t looked up e. coli and feces, but I was shocked to learn that<br/>
fresh raw eggs in a normal, healthy pregnancy actually aren&#39;t<br/>
dangerous. The only studies relating to raw eggs/salmonella in<br/>
pregnancy were: a study among pregnant Tunisian women with AIDS (raw<br/>
eggs are dangerous to them, but then and again, just about anything is,<br/>
including the common cold); some case studies of pregnant women who had<br/>
eaten raw eggs that had been left out at room temperature for *several*<br/>
hours (their fetuses died, they were fine after treatment); and case<br/>
studies of flocks of pregnant sheep that lost their fetuses after<br/>
eating food that contained salmonella (I&#39;m not a sheep, plus the<br/>
quantity of salmonella in that sheep food was probably way higher than<br/>
in 1 fresh egg). Point is, science in conjunction with the media often<br/>
exaggerate risks. I&#39;ve got other examples, but this is not meant to be<br/>
an essay on our fear-based society. <br/>

Statistically, one in 450 eggs will contain salmonella and that&#39;s only among<br/>

in the listeria bacteria that eggs can contain. Both mother and child have<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are actually different strains of e. coli, just like there are<br/>

&gt; (just like with dogs). Any strain can be dangerous when the quantity is<br/>

&gt; you&#39;re already weakened by some other disease, immunosuppressants or<br/>
&gt; other conditions (e.g., pregnancy). For an accurate risk assessment of<br/>
&gt; bacteria of all sorts you could try reading the studies about the<br/>
&gt; bacteria concerned on PubMed (often you can only read the abstracts,<br/>
&gt; but they tend to offer enough info).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t looked up e. coli and feces, but I was shocked to learn that<br/>
&gt; fresh raw eggs in a normal, healthy pregnancy actually aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; dangerous. The only studies relating to raw eggs/salmonella in<br/>
&gt; pregnancy were: a study among pregnant Tunisian women with AIDS (raw<br/>
&gt; eggs are dangerous to them, but then and again, just about anything is,<br/>
&gt; including the common cold); some case studies of pregnant women who had<br/>
&gt; eaten raw eggs that had been left out at room temperature for *several*<br/>
&gt; hours (their fetuses died, they were fine after treatment); and case<br/>
&gt; studies of flocks of pregnant sheep that lost their fetuses after<br/>
&gt; eating food that contained salmonella (I&#39;m not a sheep, plus the<br/>
&gt; quantity of salmonella in that sheep food was probably way higher than<br/>
&gt; in 1 fresh egg). Point is, science in conjunction with the media often<br/>
&gt; exaggerate risks. I&#39;ve got other examples, but this is not meant to be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335091285">Hi Kelli,<br/>
<br/>
I have been involved in the aromatherapy industry using/creating  <br/>
products/researching essentials oils for the past 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
The link you were referring to cautions against the *undiluted* use  <br/>
of tea tree. This is correct. Any essential oil can cause  <br/>
sensitization if used undiluted. It may not happen the first time, or  <br/>
the tenth time, or the 100th time, but there is always the  <br/>
possibility of sensitization occurring at some point. Once you become  <br/>
sensitized, you probably will not be able to use that oil (and  <br/>
possibly any other oil with a similar chemical structure) ever again.  <br/>
Some essential oils, if used undiluted, can cause burns and scarring  <br/>
as well. All essential oils can be toxic if used undiluted, in large  <br/>
enough amounts.<br/>
<br/>
According to &quot;The Aromatherapy Practitioner Reference Manual&quot; (one of  <br/>
the most highly respected reference books in the field) tea tree has  <br/>
been &quot;tested at low dose non-toxic, possible skin irritant, not  <br/>
tested for sensitization at levels higher than 1% dilution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Common dilutions for use with most essential oils is 1% for babies/ <br/>
children and 2.5% for adults. Pregnancy is always an area of concern  <br/>
for topical application only because women commonly experience more  <br/>
sensitivity and skin changes during pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t mean to discourage anyone from using essential oils  <br/>
- they can be a wonderful, natural way to treat common illnesses/ <br/>
injuries and enhance health and wellness. The key is to educate  <br/>
yourself and always, ALWAYS dilute before use!<br/>
<br/>
I have a few articles with basic info on aromatherapy at my website  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>More or less the same here. :)<br/>
<br/>
You should be aware though that &quot;immunizing&quot; yourself that way only<br/>
raises the number of bacteria it will take to make you ill, and not<br/>
perfectly immunizes yourself. So don&#39;t touch the raw eggs that have<br/>
been left at room temperature for a day, and be a bit more careful when<br/>
you&#39;re already ill with something else. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reasonably used to eating raw eggs, so I&#39;m not altogether too<br/>
worried about eating them now that I&#39;m pregnant (although I think I<br/>
haven&#39;t yet, but then and again, with the exhaustion and morning<br/>
(day&night) sickness I haven&#39;t really been much in the kitchen at all.<br/>
I&#39;m going to take the advice on not eating soft cheeses, because I<br/>
normally don&#39;t, so my body isn&#39;t used to those bacteria, and it is a<br/>
fact that your body is weaker during pregnancy. <br/>
<br/>
Years ago, I read something about trash collectors, how they often are<br/>
ill a LOT during their first half year on the job and then after that<br/>
barely ever. Same kinda thing. <br/>

anything.&quot; Not very many happy looks, mostly judgemental angry ones. My kids also love the <br/>
raw cookie dough, and  once Breanna ate half a raw chicken breast because she didn&#39;t realize <br/>
it had just been browned, not cooked all the way through. THAT made me a little queasy! She <br/>
had no problems.<br/>
<br/>
We definitely have hit the self-innoculation point. As frequently as they share germs, they <br/>
have iron-clad immunities by now! Runs in my husbands family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006774218">vanessa,<br/>
<br/>
thank you so much for responding to my post! i have an<br/>
 expensive ($18.00/.33 oz) small tincture bottle of<br/>
tea tree oil. the label says: <br/>
<br/>
ESS<br/>
ORGANIC OIL<br/>
TEA TREE<br/>
CAUTION: DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. DO NOT USE UNDILUTED<br/>
ON THE SKIN. KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND EYES. DO NOT<br/>
USE DURING PREGNANCY.<br/>
<br/>
because the precautionary statement concerning<br/>
diluting for skin use has already been placed on the<br/>
label, i&#39;m assuming the manufacturer intends to<br/>
precaution consumers not to use the product AT ALL<br/>
during pregnancy. otherwise, they may have recommended<br/>
some alternate dilution or something. i guess i will<br/>
contact the manufacturer, who may likely advise me not<br/>
to use it at all to prevent any sort of<br/>
reaction/litigation. or i can use what i think is good<br/>
sense and continue to use it as i have been. *sigh* <br/>
it&#39;s really very effective against acne blemishes. <br/>
<br/>
thanks again for the info!<br/>

<br/>
Speaking of doctors and malinformation, I&#39;m currently reading &quot;The<br/>
thinking woman&#39;s guide to a better birth&quot;, which is actually pretty<br/>
well researched, despite the title. Some of the stuff in it really<br/>
makes me roll my eyes, even though I was already very skeptical of<br/>
hospital birth with all its interventions. It&#39;s a wonder obstetricians<br/>
don&#39;t get sued more often. Example: in around 1800, some doctor decided<br/>
that the average length of a pregnancy is 40 weeks. Nowadays, doctors<br/>
use that number to decide when to induce, which is quite often done at<br/>
41 weeks, although there are doctors that wait till 42 weeks. Still,<br/>
turns out that the average length of a first time pregnancy is 41 weeks<br/>
and a day, and for subsequent pregnancies 40 weeks and 3 days. So, the<br/>
average first time mom is overdue and should be induced? Gimme a break.<br/>
And I could obviously go on and on, but then I&#39;d be abusing Henci<br/>
Goer&#39;s copyright, I think. <br/>
