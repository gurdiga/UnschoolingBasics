<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459669361">***I don&#39;t want to get any material that<br/>
will bore him away from the subject because he is sincerely<br/>
interested.***<br/>
<br/>
Richard Dawkins has written several books about evolution.  Bigger reads <br/>
than your son wants, probably, but you could read them and share the good <br/>
bits with him.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan enjoyed Sara Stein&#39;s &quot;The Evolution Book.&quot;   But if your kid is <br/>
recently out of school or still deschooling I don&#39;t recommend that book. <br/>
It&#39;s formatted in a kind of encyclopedic/text book way that might remind <br/>
kids too much of school.   Dylan was never at school so has none of those <br/>
associations.<br/>
<br/>
***how random selection works as far as an animal changing<br/>
to where it doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; it&#39;s legs or anything like that...we&#39;re<br/>
completely clueless as to how evolution of that magnitude occurs<br/>
regardless of billions of years.***<br/>
<br/>
Richard Dawkins &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; addresses  this.   Evolution happens on a <br/>
genetic level and is not random.   You might like to browse some of the <br/>
articles at his website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/">http://www.richarddawkins.net/</a>  or Google Richard <br/>
Dawkins bibliography for links to other writings.<br/>
<br/>
***IMO, evolution has it&#39;s holes to but at the same time, I do not know<br/>
enough to make an informed opinion one way or the other.***<br/>
<br/>
Evolution does not have holes.  There&#39;s more than a century&#39;s worth of <br/>
scientific study and millions of years of evidence and now&#39;s a good time to <br/>
become informed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161701595">Thanks Deb.  I&#39;m sure after I finish learning about it more in-depth<br/>
instead of just surface knowledge that I will not understand &quot;why&quot; I<br/>
thought there were holes. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the recommendations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-860580369">I was just on Yahoo, and there was an article about<br/>
some Japanese fishermen that caught a bottlenose<br/>
dolphin, that had an extra set of fins, which could be<br/>
considered a set of legs.  It was an interesting<br/>
article, which someone might find fascinating.  It<br/>
explains a little bit of evolution.  Hope this helps<br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543665301">***Evolution does and should have holes. It isn&#39;t faith. It&#39;s science. But <br/>
the<br/>
basis, the theory, is sound.***<br/>
<br/>
In a recent conversation with my sister in law she said she believed a <br/>
scientific theory was an just any idea and that any other idea was just as <br/>
valid.<br/>
<br/>
Science has only been trying to answer the questions of life on earth for a <br/>
very short time.  Humans have been relying on superstition for a very long <br/>
time.  In a world thousands of millions of years old and where something <br/>
like 99% of all species that ever lived are now extinct, there will be <br/>
mysteries for us to ponder for a long time, I think. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But back to birds&lt;g&gt; When Dylan was very little, maybe five, he made up a <br/>
story about Sparrows learning how to sabotage cars.  He got the idea, he <br/>
said, from watching House Sparrows in parking lots, picking dead bugs off <br/>
car grills and head lights. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

article too...it was really interesting.:)<br/>
<br/>
My kids have enjoyed the books &quot;Cartoon History of the Universe&quot; which<br/>
has a bunch of evolutionary evidence layed out in it. Fun read for<br/>
anyone!  I believe there are three different volumes, we&#39;ve got the<br/>
first two. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ymj89l">http://tinyurl.com/ymj89l</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128667030">After you sent that I asked David (dh) if he knew if the pinker flamingos were more successful at getting mates. And Simon said, well, if they are pinker they&#39;d be healthier &#39;cause they&#39;d have better food. But maybe that would mean they&#39;d just live longer and have more mates. And then he said, well, no, if they were healthier probably more girls would want to mate with them. So, you&#39;d think the pinker boys would get more mates.<br/>
<br/>
I loved watching him think it through.<br/>
