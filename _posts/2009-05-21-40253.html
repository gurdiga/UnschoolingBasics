<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582463921">I was at my friend&#39;s law school graduation.  He was sitting next to his fiance, and I had just learned of their plans to work for the Foreign Service.  I thought about the life he had lived so far, which included a stint in the Peace Corp, where he met his fiance, 10 years ago.  And, his plans for the future which included a wedding in Africa and embassy work throughout the world.  And, when he asked me what I was doing, I told him - unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
The first thing he said and the first thing his mother, who was sitting next to me, said was &quot;Oh, that&#39;s wonderful!  What a great idea.  You will do such a good job.  The kids are so lucky.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
As the day progressed and I digested their support and his accomplishments and plans, I came to realize that he was where he was and had experienced the amazing things that he had experienced because his mother believed in him.  She thought him amazing and wonderful and bright and brilliant and full of good decisions.  I have known them since he was born, 34 years ago, when I was 10. And, I had never heard her question his choices or find fault in them.  He soaked all of that up and fully believed in himself and his choices. <br/>
<br/>
I could have told them I was doing any number of things with my life or my kids, and they would have found it stunning and right.  Because that&#39;s what they do, they believe and trust and stand in awe of life and love.  And, that&#39;s what I want to do with my kids.  He wasn&#39;t unschooled but she did surround him with unconditional love and firm belief in his capacity and vision for his own life.  I am do grateful for this model.  I am so grateful for their friendship.  I am so grateful to have found all of you, who see UNCONDITIONAL LOVE as the number one ingredient in healthy and whole families.  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
