<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129923948">Hello there, <br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s the German Magazine again: unerzogen. (www.unerzogen-magazine.de)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Johanna from Leipzig, Germany. I write for the &quot;unerzogen Magazin&quot;, a print magazine about unschooling, democratic education and respectful parenting. We look for German authors and interview partners mostly, but we also look abroad and then translate. Sometimes it&#39;s the well known authors, and sometimes we look for &quot;fresh&quot; authors. <br/>
<br/>
So far we have published many of the authors you probably know: Sandra Dodd, Ren Allen, Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy, Dayna Martin etc. <br/>
<br/>
Since we have explored nearly all aspects of Unschooling by now in our past issues, we are starting anew. We are looking for fresh authors - or people who have already written for us - to write simply about what Unschooling and/or Deschooling is or both. <br/>
<br/>
It can be a rather serious article or rather personal, from your own perspective or experience - depending on your style. If you have website you write for anyway, this is an opportunity to make yourself known - you&#39;ll get your own article in English after we publish it, and your website will be posted in the little biography box in the magazine. Many of our readers read US/English websites about Unschooling, since the concept is relatively new in German - and forbidden! (As Homeschooling is forbidden). Your article helps our movement grow and change the law little by little. Please contribute! <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you don&#39;t write yourself but have an idea for us - please send us a name and contact! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Please note that unlike a few years ago, I&#39;m not actively participating in the mailinglists anymore due to so many other projects. So for more information or if you want write for us, please send an e-mail to: <br/>

Thanks for reading!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838011158">Hi Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
If my blog is any use to you, please feel free to use it.  I first started blogging as a way to keep track of our journey so there&#39;s quite a bit I&#39;ve written about how unschooling works at our house.<br/>
<br/>

Original blog which has the beginning of our journey can be found at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschoolblogger.com/momflippediswow/">http://homeschoolblogger.com/momflippediswow/</a>  <br/>
This one was started when my son was age 8, after we pulled him from school and started on the homeschooling to unschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
Some articles were cross posted for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a short blog with a few articles at<br/>

<br/>
I had planned to only write about radical unschooling, but alas, life happens.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to use or not per whatever helps your cause.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and laughter!<br/>
