<div id="ygrps-yiv-589965757">I am wondering if when any of you started unschooling that you found that<br/>
you needed to deal with and heal those things from your past that hurt so<br/>
badly and begin to unschool yourself as well as your kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m just hoping to hear everyone&#39;s paths to unschooling and how you grew<br/>
yourself out of the decision to unschool your kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve already put myself out on a limb with those around me buy homeschooling<br/>
to begin with... now, I&#39;m going to be alienating myself from other<br/>
homeschoolers.  It&#39;s just like me to be radial and different with whatever I<br/>
do.  I&#39;m so glad that their are such great online unschool communities.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You&#39;re asking a question I posed earlier this year, in my seeking to <br/>
understand the profound ways that unschooling facilitates healing. I <br/>
already posted this link, but if you missed it, here it is again:<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a little piece that Sandra and I submitted for the conference <br/>
handbook, all about healing through unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about it on the list too, if you research the archives. I <br/>
don&#39;t have time to find the exact spot, maybe later....<br/>
