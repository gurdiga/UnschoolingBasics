WOW... we sure have a lot of newbies lately (here and on unschoolingbasics)<br/>
that don&#39;t like to be judged!  Why the fear of being judged?  What you all<br/>
don&#39;t understand is that these issues you&#39;re addressing are NOT NEW around<br/>
here.  We&#39;ve heard it all before.  And those who listen and trust and begin<br/>
to make changes actually come back and say... &quot;you know... you were right...<br/>
blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit defensive at first but I really took heart of what everyone was<br/>
saying and really questioned why I was getting defensive.  Maybe you all<br/>
might want to do the same.<br/>
