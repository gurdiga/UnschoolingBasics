<div id="ygrps-yiv-171554577">&quot;When and wheredoes the school work come in with homeschooling???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With homeschooling...whenever you feel like forcing it.<br/>
With unschooling, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
We are here to tell you that making a child do schoolwork is <br/>
detrimental to real learning. Please check our links section at this <br/>
website for resources and recommendations and learn more about <br/>
unschooling if you think it&#39;s something you&#39;d like to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
This list is to help people get closer to unschooling, to learn more <br/>
about unschooling and to discuss ways to help unschooling flow <br/>
better in your home. Not how to school kids.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought Latoya,<br/>
Your pushing them to bed earlier might actually be causing some <br/>
really great learning moments. If the little one is in bed early, <br/>
you could spend more time with the older kids. Sometimes our very <br/>
best learning moments happen late at night around here! If I made <br/>
them go to bed, we&#39;d be missing some amazing moments, not to mention <br/>
some lovely nighttime walks when the world is peaceful and dark.:)<br/>
