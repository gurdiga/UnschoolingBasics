<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111611881">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was checking my email this morning, and found this in my box.  I was <br/>
wondering if anyone has heard this to be true, or if it is a scare <br/>
tactic?:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool families in Michigan need to be on alert. If you are ever <br/>
visited by a school official demanding to see your curriculum, simply <br/>
say &quot;no,&quot; and quickly give HSLDA a call.<br/>
<br/>
I am still new to this, and into my 3rd week of unschooling.  We are <br/>
having a good time, and enjoying just learning and living a natural <br/>
life, without teachers, and books, and studying for tests, or bullying <br/>
problems, etc.  I have noticed alot of changes in my kids that are for <br/>
the better.  They have both told me that they love homeschooling.  <br/>
Especially since my son (11) asked me if there were any pop quizes in <br/>
homeschooling, and I told him NO.  I asked him why he thought there <br/>
would be, and he said that he got them all the time last year in 4th <br/>
grade.  I told him he wasn&#39;t in public schools anymore &lt;BG&gt;, and that <br/>
there isn&#39;t any kind of testing in homeschooling. (at least in the <br/>
kind that we are doing.)  It actually felt really good to say that to <br/>
him, and be able to mean it.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to also say a quick &quot;hello&quot; to all of the new members, <br/>
and also say thank you to all of you who have helped me.  It has meant <br/>
alot, you all have been tremendous.<br/>

There will probably be one circulating in every state this month now <br/>
that all the schools are back in session.<br/>

As long as you are following the law specific to your state, you&#39;ll be <br/>
fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649210885">Yeah, it&#39;s pretty typical - this is when they can &#39;get&#39; all the just <br/>
starting homeschoolers who are already nervous. BUT I would also check <br/>
out the local homeschooling community and find out IF there is <br/>
something going on in a particular district - sometimes when a new <br/>
superintendent starts, they can make things difficult for <br/>
homeschoolers just because they either (a) don&#39;t understand the law <br/>
(b) want to &#39;take control&#39; (and sometimes it&#39;s both). So, IF there is <br/>
indeed something going on locally, I&#39;d print out the pertinent legal <br/>
stuff and keep it in an envelope in the closet near the front door - <br/>
in Michigan, first off, how would they know who is homeschooling since <br/>
you don&#39;t have to file any notice of intent and second, there is no <br/>
requirement to have ANY curriculum or evalution or anything like that <br/>
to show anyone. nhen.org would be a good choice for finding an easy <br/>
link to the legal stuff. The H$LDA stuff is based on an apparent <br/>
circumstance where someone DID show up at someone&#39;s house and request <br/>
to see curriculum and had what appeared to be some sort of official <br/>
letter.<br/>

<br/>
 Still,<br/>
<br/>
  If you KNOW the law of your state and are following it, you should <br/>
have no problems. Certainly none that you would need H$LDA to help you <br/>
through.<br/>
<br/>
 If you feel you need legal info---try NHELD before H$LDA.<br/>
<br/>
  Hell, *I* would also advise that you not give *any* organization any <br/>
more info than absolutely necessary AND required by law. And I won&#39;t <br/>
charge you one red cent! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
