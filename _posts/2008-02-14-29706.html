<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019489502">Hi Kasey,<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever looked at RDI (Relationship Development Intervention) for your<br/>
son&#39;s autism?<br/>
<br/>
They do react differently to games and competition and doing things &#39;with&#39;<br/>
people than neurotypical kids, so you do probably need to take a different<br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
I have an autistic son, yet to reach school age. I&#39;ll be completely<br/>
unschooling my daughter but doing RDI with my son... they have different<br/>
needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143049088">Hi, Kasey,<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting is that your 8-year-old son is passionate about <br/>
playing and that he&#39;s really serious about it.  That&#39;s good.  As an <br/>
extremely wise person told me once (Deb Lewis or Diana maybe?), the <br/>
world needs more passionate people.<br/>
<br/>
This sentence you wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;He seems to be only playing the game for the win and not for the <br/>
&gt;pleasure of playing it<br/>
&gt;anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>suggests that you have a subjective opinion (redundant, I know) that <br/>
he *should* be playing these games for the pleasure of it.  But, <br/>
that&#39;s *your* opinion.  He&#39;s got his other reasons, and they are valid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;If he does not get to play if for some reason he also becomes very <br/>
&gt;nasty and screams and stomps through the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would want to do that, too, if I couldn&#39;t do something that meant a <br/>
lot to me.  Even more so if that thing were being deliberately <br/>
withheld from me!  If you can put yourself in his place, you&#39;ll see <br/>
what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have done time constraints and days off and all of it...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, by my lights, preventing him from doing something he loves <br/>
*cannot* help him be happier.  It can only lead to resentment and a <br/>
feeling perhaps of insecurity and frustration in his own home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...to letting him play as much as he wants.. It does not matter he <br/>
&gt;is just plain ole&#39; nasty about the<br/>
&gt;whole issue almost OCD over it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be that there is a new dimension for him of wondering when <br/>
he will be prevented from playing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But being a parent that believes in unschooling and letting him lead<br/>
&gt;the way it is seeming to be a challenge for me to just take it away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fortunately, those are not your only two choices.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My son, now 13, had a lot intense emotions around playing.  He still <br/>
does, in fact.  He loves gaming and it broke my heart to see him be <br/>
so upset over the games.  I couldn&#39;t comfort him, either, even though <br/>
I wanted to so badly; my attempts to do that only made him feel <br/>
worse.  I think it was because he couldn&#39;t retain his dignity; he <br/>
needed privacy to express his frustration.  I would have felt the <br/>
same way!  Plus, my need to fix things was interfering with his <br/>
ability to get what he needed to get from the experience.<br/>
<br/>
What I ended up doing was:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Allow him the space and privacy he needed to feel his feelings <br/>
without my interference, and<br/>
2.  I helped him (and still do) wherever possible, whether it is <br/>
getting him the guide for the game or looking things up on the <br/>
Internet.  This has made a huge difference, not only in his ability <br/>
to be successful while playing the games, but also in our closeness.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427845632">I LOVE The Sims- the original, on the PC. Last summer i found a whole set of them for one dollar a piece at the yard sale along with other games. I began to play them a little in my spare time I found. Jonah 7, began to watch and became interested in it and soon wanted to play. I did not think he would like it or be able to understand too much of it. I finally let him try it and lo and behold he loved it too! <br/>
     The big surpise to me is that souly due to that game, he learned money. He learned that one needs to work to make money. He learned more about place value and how to read numbers! Big numbers! <br/>
     I learned that we can&#39;t underestimate what or how a child can learn and this goes to both positive learning and negitive learning. I love that while a lot of kids are in the classroom sitting at hard desks that hurt are forced to do drills and worksheets while mine learned the same thing while playing a computer game!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455383193">My oldest ds went through this. If I remember correctly, he was a <br/>
bit older, around 12-14 age range. I tried punishments like limiting <br/>
his game and even taking away the game system all together to get <br/>
him to &quot;behave&quot; but he just wouldn&#39;t. (Who would want to under those <br/>
circumstances?) In fact, I think of all my restrictions just made it <br/>
worse. In spite of me, as he got older and matured he was able to <br/>
control himself better. Now he plays games and is still a pleasant <br/>
person to be around. Looking back knowing what I know now I wish I <br/>
had just let him do his thing. I don&#39;t know how that could help but <br/>
just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125405915">My kids are fast typers. They can calculate hit point averages, know <br/>
how much gold they need to buy what they want at the auction house. <br/>
Know how many copper it takes to make one gold. They can run a quest. <br/>
Meaning follow directions and work within the guidelines of a guild.<br/>
<br/>
They are practicing high level thinking including statistics, <br/>
interpersonal relations and language development. They share some <br/>
wonderful thing that has happened to them in a game or online daily. <br/>
They also have learned a fairbit about computer programing recently.<br/>
<br/>
At our house we have three computers. I have seven kids sharing them.<br/>
There can be a moment of tension when someone wants to play and someone <br/>
is still playing. We talk a lot about how each of us want to be treated <br/>
around the game. We try to make sure each person gets what they are <br/>
asking for.. That sometimes means they have to wait a bit, but that <br/>
usually turns into watching your brother or sister defeat the guy they <br/>
are battling and get the loot. <br/>
<br/>
We have been radically unschooling for three years now. Meaning no <br/>
limits for games, tv, food, sleep. Only a policy of mutual respect.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when we began this journey lots more bickering about gaming <br/>
and getting a turn. Not trusting that they would get what they needed. <br/>
That someone would block them.<br/>
<br/>
As far as emotional and hot tempers around the gaming. I have a very <br/>
emotionally sensitive guy who still sometimes gets upset at what is <br/>
going on in a game. He really needs for us to hear him and not stop him <br/>
from expressing his frustration. I used to want to be correcting him, <br/>
but when a partner with him, just like I want when I have a bad time <br/>
with something, it turns around fairly quickly. <br/>
<br/>
For younger sibs who have been the brundt of frustration sometimes it <br/>
helps to watch out for them. Help them know that the frustration is at <br/>
the game and not at them. Whenever I have asked my son, when he is done <br/>
venting, if so and so is really an idiot &lt;or whatever&gt; the answer is <br/>
almost always no.. With a real sorry to the offended party. Not one <br/>
that has been forced or coerced.<br/>
<br/>
I also love that the kids have really learned how to support each other <br/>
in their gaming. They will talk a game and understand each other all <br/>
the way through a meal. They patiently explain it to me. I am a big <br/>
animal crossing fan, but prefer to just watch the kids play other games.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I just wanted to say that gaming has been a wonderful addition <br/>
to our lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009304816">You have tried the let-him-play-all-day thing.  And, you have tried <br/>
the limit/take away thing.  Neither of which seems to be meeting his <br/>
needs at this point.  And, if neither is meeting his needs, neither <br/>
is unschooling, even though letting him play all day may seem so at <br/>
first.  Instead of thinking about letting him do this or letting him <br/>
do that, try not using the word `letting&#39; at all. Try using the word <br/>
helping, instead.   How can you HELP him?  Before you can help, of <br/>
course, you&#39;ll have to get down to what he really needs right now.  <br/>
You&#39;ll then have to ask yourself, what does help look like? <br/>
<br/>
What has been going on specifically in his game(s) in the last 6-8 <br/>
weeks?  If he has reached a level that he cannot beat, this may cause <br/>
his frustration and cause him to feel disempowered.   If this is the <br/>
case, then taking the computer away from him or limiting his time <br/>
will disempower him twice over.  If you could see all that is going <br/>
on in his mind with the game, it might be easier to understand where <br/>
he is coming from.    I would get as many details as possible about <br/>
what has been going on in the game(s).   See what goes on <br/>
specifically with him and his brother while playing.  Play the game <br/>
yourself to gain more appreciation.    As far as help goes, try <br/>
asking him directly how you can help.   Perhaps you could try the <br/>
following.  Get online and find out how other players have gotten <br/>
past the tough areas.  Find websites with cheats or pointers.   Look <br/>
for other games in that genre that may give him another avenue for <br/>
continuing his passion.  Ask him if he would like time to play by <br/>
himself without his brother. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is much confusion about the whole computer/video game <br/>
thing and unschooling.  It&#39;s easy to get the impression that <br/>
unschooling is about letting your child play video games all day, <br/>
every day, 24/7 NO MATTER WHAT.   There is so much darn focus on <br/>
video games and TV that the true message is obscured.  A broader <br/>
description might be, when your child is happy and content, what he <br/>
does and how long he does it is not so important.   One child&#39;s <br/>
happiness may look like playing video games a good portion of the <br/>
day.  Another child&#39;s may look like painting or reading or cooking.  <br/>
None are better or worse than the other.   When happiness is not <br/>
present however, the book, the food, the painting or the video game <br/>
is not to blame.  It&#39;s time to look for unfulfilled needs and see how <br/>
you can help out.<br/>
<br/>
-Dana<br/>
<br/>
My son had this to say about computer games.  &quot;I play games for <br/>
enjoying it and to feel like a god.  I call the shots and I come out <br/>
the other end in one piece. &quot;</div>

&gt; I think there is much confusion about the whole computer/video game <br/>
&gt; thing and unschooling.  It&#39;s easy to get the impression that <br/>
&gt; unschooling is about letting your child play video games all day, <br/>
&gt; every day, 24/7 NO MATTER WHAT.   There is so much darn focus on <br/>
&gt; video games and TV that the true message is obscured.  A broader <br/>
&gt; description might be, when your child is happy and content, what he <br/>
&gt; does and how long he does it is not so important.   One child&#39;s <br/>
&gt; happiness may look like playing video games a good portion of the <br/>
&gt; day.  Another child&#39;s may look like painting or reading or <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; None are better or worse than the other.   When happiness is not <br/>
