<div id="ygrps-yiv-47219386">Wondering what other&#39;s say or don&#39;t in situations where people make comments <br/>
concerning controlling children?<br/>
<br/>
In the situations that I&#39;ve had arise, the people either don&#39;t know we unschool or if they do <br/>
don&#39;t know much about it.  Some recent comments have been the following:<br/>
<br/>
-Two neighbor kids were over playing w/our 4 year old and my dh & I were conversing <br/>
with their parents in our backyard.  Damek (our 4 year old), came up a couple of times <br/>
asking for things (can&#39;t remember what now), and the neighbor made the comment &quot;yea, <br/>
our kids were very demanding at that age also, we put a stop to that quick&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
-My son just had his 5th birthday party yesterday and had a couple of neighbor friends <br/>
over, one of the mom&#39;s came to get her son and saw that the boys were all enamoured <br/>
with a couple of new gameboy games my son got.  The sister (age 9) of the boy was there <br/>
saying how much she wanted a gameboy and the mom said &quot;if we bought you a gameboy <br/>
you would never read books&quot;, and then went on to say &quot;it&#39;s hard enough to get you to read <br/>
without having a gameboy&quot;.  The girl then said &quot;my mom said that if I read a lot I can have <br/>
a gameboy&quot;, and then the mom said &quot;maybe&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
-My sister & her husband were watching our 4 year old along with their 3 kids.  We came <br/>
to pick him up and the boys were still having fun playing, so we stayed awhile and talked.  <br/>
Then my nephew wanted to watch a video, but my sister said it was too late and it was <br/>
getting to be bedtime.  My son said &quot;well he wants to watch it&quot;, and my sister said &quot;just <br/>
because he wants to do something doesn&#39;t mean he gets to do it&quot;.  My son just kind of <br/>
looked dumbfounded, as he doesn&#39;t encounter this attitude from us.<br/>
<br/>
In the first situation I feel like I could have said something as she was addressing us in <br/>
particular.  The second situation was sort of between the girl & the mom, but I was <br/>
included in the conversation as the girl was talking to me.  Would you say anything or just <br/>
keep your mouth shut?  I so want to promote unschooling, but I just don&#39;t think in these <br/>
situations with these types of people they would even attempt to &quot;get&quot; what unschooling is <br/>
all about.<br/>
<br/>
What do others do in these types of situations?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632237375">David (dh) is really good at talking about it later. So, later he&#39;d talk <br/>
with the girl&#39;s mom about how amazing the Pokemon gameboy games are for <br/>
reading, how much reading goes on in role playing games, how narrative those <br/>
kinds of games are. He might mention some of the studies talking about the <br/>
narrative value of video games. But it wouldn&#39;t be direct, it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
about the girl asking for a gameboy. It would be some side story, something <br/>
to maybe get her thinking about video games in a different light.<br/>
<br/>
To the first situation I&#39;d probably have said something along the lines of <br/>
thinking I&#39;d miss it if he did stop while smiling and looking fondly at my <br/>
son. Something sort of distracted. Maybe even something like &quot;oh, well, they <br/>
grow up so fast, I am appreciated so much who he is now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The last situation would depend on your relationship with your sister. If <br/>
you are comfortable teasing her, than maybe you could have said something <br/>
like &quot;Wow, you sound just like mom (or dad or some one in your shared past&quot; <br/>
and hope that she could see the link. And maybe helped her let her son watch <br/>
the video.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is hard to get people to see how being generous with your child <br/>
isn&#39;t going to produce a spoiled brat. I don&#39;t think it is situation where a <br/>
snappy comeback will help. It is very easy to make a parent feel defensive <br/>
about their decisions. And a defensive parent may make it more difficult for <br/>
your son to play with their kids. What is the line, &quot;be the change you want <br/>
to see in the world.&quot; Help other parents to see how good your life is with <br/>
your child by being gentle and loving and watching that child be gentle and <br/>
loving in return.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149107914">Schuyler,<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!  I probably should have rephrased the question, as I don&#39;t want to make a snide <br/>
comment, because I don&#39;t want them to get defensive, so usually I just say nothing.  I like <br/>
the idea of mentioning something as a side note concerning the subject of the comment <br/>
that was made.  Even though my dh & I are totally committed to radical unschooling, we <br/>
still have our share of learning to go, and I think that as it gets more & more comfortable <br/>
and like second nature it will be easier for us to just converse ru with other people.  Not so <br/>
much to convert them, but just to help them understand it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103983242">It&#39;s hard to hear that kind of thing, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I think what is most productive, is doing some of the same kinds of things we do for our own kids.  Express empathy, &quot;Yeah, children do need a lot of help -- it can be overwhelming sometimes.&quot;  To the daughter, &quot;You really want a gameboy, huh?&quot; or to the mother, &quot;You sound pretty worried about her reading&quot; (or maybe not, unless you&#39;re willing to get into a longer discussion of her woes:-)   You can do that without sharing their feelings or sounding overwhelmed or worried yourself.  You could also share your own experiences, although that might be better at some later point especially in the latter 2 instances which were more about other people&#39;s kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest thing we can do is live our own lives joyfully and with confidence.   Then, if people don&#39;t see us as judging them, they may in time express interest in our choices -- especially people you see regularly or know well like neighbors and family.  But if we appear judgmental or zealous, they probably won&#39;t be interested now or later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to admit I have stopped trying to convince other people or <br/>
win them over to unschooling.  John Holt wrote something about it in <br/>
one of his books (I can&#39;t remember which).  Every person has their <br/>
understanding of how life is.  It is their story  of the way things <br/>
are -- some would call it their world view.  Anytime a new idea is <br/>
introduced, that person has to fit it in to their story.  If the new <br/>
idea doesn&#39;t make sense to their story, two things can happen.  <br/>
Their story must change.  Or the idea must be rejected or <br/>
discounted.  When you introduce a concept as novel as peaceful <br/>
parenting, many people will find a way to reject it.  Otherwise it <br/>
will rock the foundation of their whole understanding of how the <br/>
world works.  I know that&#39;s what happened to me.  My story was <br/>
profoundly changed by this concept -- although change was slow.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to talk about unschooling with someone who shows an <br/>
interest.  But I don&#39;t bring it up.  Some people get angry or don&#39;t <br/>
want to hear about it.  And no wonder, you are threatening <br/>
everything they hold to be true.  My mil HAS to believe that the way <br/>
she raised her children was the right and best way.  It is <br/>
fundamental to who she is.  She doesn&#39;t like to talk much about how <br/>
things have changed around our house.  Life changing ideas make her <br/>
nervous.  I can&#39;t change her.  But she just might be moved by my <br/>
children as they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful to live peacefully and generously with children.  My <br/>
biggest challenge lately has been to extend that generosity and <br/>
acceptance to other people.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301009992">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group and reading this post. Please forgive me, but  <br/>
I am afraid I do not understand.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the 1st situation, I dont understand WHY it would be an  <br/>
issue. In the 1st instance, it seems that they offered parenting  <br/>
advice which was not asked for. Now unless you turned to them and  <br/>
said, &quot; I wonder if your little ones do that to you, how did you  <br/>
handle it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the other 2 , it just seems like those are their parents rules. I  <br/>
know lots  of parents who do not let their kids have video games. I  <br/>
even know some that do not even have a TV in the house. They have  <br/>
their reasons and their rules, and values...  Whether or not you  <br/>
disagree, aren&#39;t those still their rules and their kids?<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to be the bad person here, if I am missing something,  <br/>
please explain it to me. I mean, I say things like that to our kids  <br/>
too.. Just because they want it, does not mean they are going to get  <br/>
everything they want. Does not have to even do with spoiling them,  <br/>
that is just how life is.  And our kids do have video games, but they  <br/>
are limited in how long they are allowed to play, and they dont play  <br/>
everyday... There are so many things to do, I would not want them  <br/>
hooked on ONE thing all day long..... these are the rules in our  <br/>
house....<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Shellini<br/>

want to hear about it. And no wonder, you are threatening <br/>
everything they hold to be true. My mil HAS to believe that the way <br/>
she raised her children was the right and best way. It is <br/>
fundamental to who she is. She doesn&#39;t like to talk much about how <br/>
things have changed around our house. Life changing ideas make her <br/>
nervous. I can&#39;t change her. But she just might be moved by my <br/>
children as they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful to live peacefully and generously with children. My <br/>
biggest challenge lately has been to extend that generosity and <br/>
acceptance to other people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking for solutions and alternatives is a great way to help kids <br/>
touch base with the underlying needs driving their desires. That&#39;s <br/>
not something most of *us* learned as kids, so it can take some time <br/>
and practice. Finding ways to say &quot;yes&quot; more often is pretty <br/>
empowering, though. It doesn&#39;t give kids and unrealistic view of the <br/>
world - if anything, it helps them be more thoughtful and creative <br/>
when it comes to problem-solving. <br/>
<br/>
Its true that, even with the most creative problem solving in the <br/>
world, we can&#39;t always get what we want. As parents, though, we have <br/>
the opportunity to help our kids learn how to cope with that, rather <br/>
than shrugging off their wants as inconvenient to us. <br/>
Disappointment, sadness and frustration are difficult emotions. Our <br/>
kids need help figuring out how to deal with difficult emotions and <br/>
they need to know that their feelings are valuble to us.<br/>
<br/>
Its unreasonable to expect children to be sanguine about <br/>
disappointment - heck, many adults have trouble dealing with <br/>
disappointment! Personally, I think a great deal of parents&#39; wanting <br/>
kids to accept &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; is bc of our own <br/>
difficulties. When we can&#39;t give our kids what they want, *we* feel <br/>
badly but dont&#39; know how to acknowledge and move past that feeling. <br/>
Part of unschooling is learning to parent *ourselves*.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good place to start thinking about &quot;principles&quot; instead of <br/>
rules. <br/>
<br/>
I always find that when I&#39;m getting &quot;stuck&quot; going back to my <br/>
priciples makes a big difference. Early on in my unschooling <br/>
journey, I found that some of what I considered priciples were in <br/>
conflict with one another and I had to do some deeper &quot;work&quot; to find <br/>
the core values or priciples that I wanted to embody in my life. <br/>
<br/>
In the example above, I&#39;d guess that there&#39;s a principle of <br/>
moderation, but I&#39;d suggest digging deeper. Why is moderation <br/>
important? What&#39;s underneath that? Why is getting all wrapped up in <br/>
something fun, especially, such a problem? Would it be as much of a <br/>
problem if it were something &quot;educational&quot;, like reading? I suspect <br/>
there are some fears here that need to be examined. <br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with moderation, from an unschooling <br/>
perspective, is that people learn most easily from their passions, <br/>
and certainly most joyfully. People of all ages will take on amazing <br/>
challenges when they are inspired. My stepson will do the very <br/>
things playing video games or skateboarding that he flat-out refused <br/>
to do in school: he will do dull, repetitive exercises for the <br/>
purpose of &quot;getting better&quot; at a particular skill. He actually <br/>
*chooses* to do something he doesn&#39;t really like bc it forwards his <br/>
passions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479541031">Thanks for the John Holt quote, that is quite profound and certainly explains a lot about <br/>
why people are resistant to change.<br/>

I think what turned me onto radical unschooling was exactly what you said &quot;it&#39;s wonderful <br/>
to live peacefully & generously with children&quot;.  I also agree that it needs to be who I am <br/>
with everyone not just my children, and that is something that I work on constantly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to admit I have stopped trying to convince other people or <br/>
&gt; win them over to unschooling.  John Holt wrote something about it in <br/>
&gt; one of his books (I can&#39;t remember which).  Every person has their <br/>
&gt; understanding of how life is.  It is their story  of the way things <br/>
&gt; are -- some would call it their world view.  Anytime a new idea is <br/>
&gt; introduced, that person has to fit it in to their story.  If the new <br/>
&gt; idea doesn&#39;t make sense to their story, two things can happen.  <br/>
&gt; Their story must change.  Or the idea must be rejected or <br/>
&gt; discounted.  When you introduce a concept as novel as peaceful <br/>
&gt; parenting, many people will find a way to reject it.  Otherwise it <br/>
&gt; will rock the foundation of their whole understanding of how the <br/>
&gt; world works.  I know that&#39;s what happened to me.  My story was <br/>
&gt; profoundly changed by this concept -- although change was slow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am willing to talk about unschooling with someone who shows an <br/>

Your not the bad person here:)  Being new to the list and concerning your comments, I <br/>
think you might not be aware of what radical unschooling is. Just keep reading the list and <br/>
if your interested look in the archives to get a good picture of how radical unschoolers live  <br/>
with children.  I can speak for myself and say that this list and helped our family immensly <br/>
on our radical unschooling journey.<br/>

&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am new to this group and reading this post. Please forgive me, but  <br/>
&gt; I am afraid I do not understand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aside from the 1st situation, I dont understand WHY it would be an  <br/>
&gt; issue. In the 1st instance, it seems that they offered parenting  <br/>
&gt; advice which was not asked for. Now unless you turned to them and  <br/>
&gt; said, &quot; I wonder if your little ones do that to you, how did you  <br/>
&gt; handle it...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the other 2 , it just seems like those are their parents rules. I  <br/>
&gt; know lots  of parents who do not let their kids have video games. I  <br/>
&gt; even know some that do not even have a TV in the house. They have  <br/>
&gt; their reasons and their rules, and values...  Whether or not you  <br/>
&gt; disagree, aren&#39;t those still their rules and their kids?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not trying to be the bad person here, if I am missing something,  <br/>
&gt; please explain it to me. I mean, I say things like that to our kids  <br/>
&gt; too.. Just because they want it, does not mean they are going to get  <br/>
&gt; everything they want. Does not have to even do with spoiling them,  <br/>
&gt; that is just how life is.  And our kids do have video games, but they  <br/>
&gt; are limited in how long they are allowed to play, and they dont play  <br/>
&gt; everyday... There are so many things to do, I would not want them  <br/>
&gt; hooked on ONE thing all day long..... these are the rules in our  <br/>
&gt; house....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you!<br/>

because they are out of touch with real feelings.<br/>

see. My childhood training told me to bury the sadness and disappointment, and when you <br/>
do that long enough, it explodes as anger and resentment and negative behaviors. It turns <br/>
from disappointment to self-pity, and from self-pity to revenge. Maybe not all at once, but <br/>
it builds.<br/>

<br/>
I guess I am learning then.. lol.. Yes, I have never heard of radical<br/>

&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a good place to start thinking about &quot;principles&quot; instead of <br/>
&gt; rules. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I always find that when I&#39;m getting &quot;stuck&quot; going back to my <br/>
&gt; priciples makes a big difference. Early on in my unschooling <br/>
&gt; journey, I found that some of what I considered priciples were in <br/>
&gt; conflict with one another and I had to do some deeper &quot;work&quot; to find <br/>
&gt; the core values or priciples that I wanted to embody in my life. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the example above, I&#39;d guess that there&#39;s a principle of <br/>
&gt; moderation, but I&#39;d suggest digging deeper. Why is moderation <br/>
&gt; important? What&#39;s underneath that? Why is getting all wrapped up in <br/>
&gt; something fun, especially, such a problem? Would it be as much of a <br/>
&gt; problem if it were something &quot;educational&quot;, like reading? I suspect <br/>
&gt; there are some fears here that need to be examined. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the problems with moderation, from an unschooling <br/>
&gt; perspective, is that people learn most easily from their passions, <br/>
&gt; and certainly most joyfully. People of all ages will take on amazing <br/>
&gt; challenges when they are inspired. My stepson will do the very <br/>
&gt; things playing video games or skateboarding that he flat-out refused <br/>
&gt; to do in school: he will do dull, repetitive exercises for the <br/>
&gt; purpose of &quot;getting better&quot; at a particular skill. He actually <br/>
&gt; *chooses* to do something he doesn&#39;t really like bc it forwards his <br/>
&gt; passions. <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions!  I like the idea of just modeling our behavior for other people <br/>
to see.  I think a lot has to do with the age of my son right now (5), the age where <br/>
everyone thinks they need to curtail certain behaviors with children and set them on the <br/>
right path, their behavior is so out there and open & free at this age and it makes people <br/>
uncomfortable I think.  I will keep in mind to keep my focus on my child in these types of <br/>
situations and talk to him about the differences in families and how even if we don&#39;t agree <br/>
with how their family is run, that as long as the children aren&#39;t being abused, then we need <br/>
to respect the way their family is run.<br/>

&gt; representing what they are not doing.  If the conversation gets long and <br/>
&gt; indepth than the opportunity will occur naturally to use the word <br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
My husband and I, since totally embracing radical unschooling, have just had a shift in <br/>
how we were starting to handle conflicts in our home, and how we were starting to view <br/>
this next leg of parenting coming from a very attached style to begin with.  My son (who <br/>
just turned 5), was so easy going and laid back until about 3 years of age, and after a new <br/>
sibling, that we started reading all the positive parenting books, which are really still very <br/>
controlling and &quot;discipline&quot; oriented.  Soon after we discovered radical unschooling by way <br/>
of the Always Unschooled group and then this one, and WOW!!  It was like a bunch of light <br/>
bulbs went off.  You mean  you treat your children the way you want to be treated?  You <br/>
put your trust in them to make decisions regarding themselves and these amazing beings <br/>
can actually know what it is they need and what they have a passion for?  In a way it is so <br/>
much more complex then traditional parenting and using bribes/rewards/punishments, <br/>
but in the same sense it is so simple.  I&#39;m not saying we have zero conflicts in our home, <br/>
but for the most part they are easy to handle by just talking with our children and coming <br/>
up with solution that meet everyones needs.  We basically don&#39;t have limits on anything in <br/>
our home, and everything (minus somebody getting hurt or property being damaged) is <br/>
negotiable.  <br/>
<br/>
My son self-regulates himself on just about everything (t.v., video games, food, hygiene, <br/>
ect..) and does an amazing job IMO.  As an unschooling parent we are here to help our <br/>
children attain whatever it is they desire, and act as facilitators to their learning and life in <br/>
general.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definiately not an expert or veteran in radical unschooling, I just know what this type <br/>
of lifestyle has done for our family and can&#39;t be gracious enough that we discovered it <br/>
when we did.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep reading all you can and ask any question you haveo on this list and it will get <br/>
answered, probably much more eloquent than my answer.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

&gt; Hi Julie, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I am learning then.. lol.. Yes, I have never heard of radical<br/>
&gt; homeschooling till now. I am reading a little bit about John Holt on<br/>
&gt; the wikipedia site to get more of a feel. can you tell me more about<br/>
&gt; how this has helped your family, if you can. I would like to know more<br/>
&gt; and you can do it off list, if you prefer. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks !!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; think you might not be aware of what radical unschooling is. Just<br/>
&gt; keep reading the list and <br/>

can&#39;t always get what you want. Life teaches that<br/>
lesson in many different ways. There are real limits<br/>
to our finances and our energies. Plus unexpected<br/>
sickness and weather (especially here in New England<br/>
:) can throw our plans off kilter. <br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to learn that they can indeed have what<br/>

by working towards it.<br/>

WE are one of THOSE parents that give everything our kids ask for. Of course if we financially can at that moment. I have a very intense ds that will be 5 end of June and you know what??? We have given him so many presents, big presents, just because....and ALL the time.<br/>
It has not made him &quot;spoiled&quot;. If we cannot give him something at that moment we talk about it and discuss what we can do. He will either choose to wait till we can or to get something that we can afford that minute. And that can be a small trinket that costs 50 Cents when we are broke.<br/>
This past Christmas I kept asking what he wanted. Last Christmas he got so many presents. He said he wanted to get ME a Nintendo DS so we could play together. He did not want anything for himself but for his mom. <br/>
He will not learn to be spoiled if he gets everything he wants- no one gets every little thing they want. But he will learn that his parents will try to give him everything he wants - if possible.<br/>
He will learn about family budget and money and economics and most of all he will learn the joy of giving something that makes a loved one smile.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this a value?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the value you are really referring to is gratitude for what you do <br/>
have.  My kids place tremendous value in generosity rather than deprivation. <br/>
  I don&#39;t have to control what they can or cannot have or do - life dictates <br/>
that better than i can.  It doesn&#39;t have to be taught through money <br/>
controls.  On a simple level, not having what they want has been learned <br/>
through loosing a ball game.  To be very drastic in an example - not having <br/>
what they want has been learned through death of loved ones - friends and <br/>
family.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever seen something that really peaked your desire even though your <br/>
birthday had just passed?  A wise woman once said to me - if you can afford <br/>
it why would you withhold it from your child?  Do you withhold purchasing <br/>
something you want (even if it&#39;s not necessary) just because it&#39;s something <br/>
you like - a new pair of shoes, a handbag, piece of jewelry, a cd, another <br/>
sketch pad or journal, a cookie?  There have been times in my family&#39;s life <br/>
when we didn&#39;t have much money to spend on these things - and each purchase <br/>
had to be thought out very carefully against our budget.  I feel very <br/>
blessed that today i don&#39;t have to be as concerned - and want to pass that <br/>
blessing along to my kids.  It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t discuss the cost and <br/>
the possibility of putting money towards something other than what they&#39;ve <br/>
expressed interest in (like going to an unschooling conference&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were very small and didn&#39;t yet understand limits to spending - <br/>
i avoided stores with them.  And if that was not possible - i would budget a <br/>
few dollars into the shopping list so that they could pick out whatever they <br/>
wanted beyond the necessities - they knew they had this going into the store <br/>
and pretty much always worked within the budget.  They were also involved in <br/>
picking out what the necessities were.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He will learn to be spoiled if he gets everytihng<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This time it was a very wise man who said to me, &quot;something spoils only when <br/>
it is left on the shelf by itself to rot.&quot;  I think we can only &#39;spoil&#39; a <br/>
person by withholding from them not by giving them what they ask for - want <br/>
or need.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son is a sensitive child too.. If I left him to do what<br/>
&gt;he wanted, he would eat junk food and play video games all day long...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t know your background with this...but have you tried this?  My dd&#39;s <br/>
have complete control over anything they want to eat and they always end up <br/>
asking for &#39;good&#39; food when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Once my younger dd missed having ice cream after an evening out becaue she <br/>
fell asleep on the ride home.  she was anxious about getting into the car <br/>
because she knew this might happen.  I promised her that if she fell asleep <br/>
she could have ice cream for breakfast, in fact, i said to her, she could <br/>
have icecream for breakfast, lunch and dinner and snack in between if she <br/>
wished.  She could eat icecream all day long.  The next day - she did have <br/>
ice cream for breakfast and lunch.  But by mid day she came to me saying she <br/>
needed some &#39;real&#39; food in her body.  She was about 6 at the time.  She <br/>
loves telling this story (so do i infact) - and since that day (3.5 years <br/>
ago) she asked if she could do that again only once.  I said of course.  But <br/>
she has yet to take me up on the offer.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak personally about video games with my own kids - but i do have <br/>
a friend with a teen son who realized his lightheadedness and naseau came <br/>
from not taking enough breaks from his machines to eat and rest.  He learned <br/>
through personal experience the importance of breaks.  And someone else on <br/>
this list recently related their child asking for assistance to be reminded <br/>
to take breaks so he can accomplish other things that he&#39;s interested in <br/>
throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
I can personally attest to being sucked into a machine...but i can also <br/>
attest to the resentment towards those that try to control me rather than <br/>
giving me the time to work out my own solutions to self control when it <br/>
comes to machines - or food - or any other obsession i may have.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When i say no - my child will ask me why.  The truth is unless there is a <br/>
very real reason that is beyond my control for the &#39;no&#39; - i hear the <br/>
arbitrary nature of my &#39;no&#39; and then ask myself what&#39;s really important <br/>
here?  What is important is that i can be flexible.  How can i expect or <br/>
want them to exhibit the value of flexibility if i can not be flexible?  <br/>
That i can discuss with my kids ways to get to yes.  That they feel <br/>
empowered and a sense of control over their own life.  I have no problem <br/>
letting my kids know i can change my mind.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;No&#39; is an important word.  My very wise husband said (i surround myself by <br/>
wise people &lt;g&gt;), unless you can say &#39;no&#39; there is no real &#39;yes.&#39;  BUT - <br/>
saying no simply for the sake of being able to say no is punitive and <br/>
disempowering.  Sometimes if i feel the urge to say no i wait a few seconds <br/>
before responding.<br/>
<br/>
As important as it is for you to be able to say no - it is important for my <br/>
kids to be able to say no to me as well.  &quot;No - mom that is not ok with me <br/>
that i can not do that - or have that - or whatever.  This is important to <br/>
me&quot; they will tell me.  It doesn&#39;t always mean that i will be able to change <br/>
the situation, sometimes reality dictates all i can say is - &quot;yes, i <br/>
&#39;know&#39;its hard when things don&#39;t go the way you want.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which values? That&#39;s a serious question, not a snarky one. I found <br/>
being really really specific about my values helpful in <br/>
understanding unschooling, even to the point of breaking down big <br/>
values, like &quot;respect&quot; into smaller, component values. <br/>
<br/>
Its true that not everything in life is equally possible at the <br/>
moment, the question is: how do we deal with that? From my <br/>
perspective, I want my kids to have the skills to problem solve and <br/>
think critically *and* understand how to work through difficult <br/>
emotions. Saying &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; doesn&#39;t do any <br/>
of that.<br/>
<br/>
What if you switched to &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s just not possible&quot;? That <br/>
at least has the benefit of acknowledging the feelings involved. Of <br/>
course, it *does* set you up to answer the question &quot;why isn&#39;t it <br/>
possible?&quot; That&#39;s the sticker. If you don&#39;t have the quick-and-dirty <br/>
brush-offs like &quot;I&#39;m the mom, that&#39;s why&quot; and &quot;you can&#39;t always get <br/>
what you want&quot; you have to really think about and answer your kids <br/>
questions, and entertain some alternative solutions. Maybe even <br/>
change your position - not a bad thing at all! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He will learn to be spoiled if he gets everytihng<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t noticed my 5yo being any more rude or demanding than other <br/>
kids her age. She does try to find solutions and consider <br/>
alternatives, which is sometimes inconvenient to *me*! But its <br/>
certainly better than what I see her non-unschooled kid friends <br/>
doing, which is to sneak around behind their parents&#39; backs to <br/>
explore the same kinds of alternatives. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson, before he moved in with us, was a fairly &quot;typical&quot; surly <br/>
teen - that&#39;s the other dividend you get for &quot;can&#39;t always get what <br/>
you want&quot;, a teen who reflects that attitude back atcha. Last night <br/>
Ray was telling me some of the things he&#39;s done to &quot;teach his mom <br/>
she can&#39;t always get her way anymore&quot; - Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
At our house, he&#39;s a sweetheart. Yesterday was his first day up from <br/>
being sick and he was falling over himself to be helpful. We&#39;ve <br/>
never told him &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; - we&#39;ve <br/>
said &quot;lets see if that&#39;s possible&quot; and tried to make it happen. Not <br/>
always successfully, but he&#39;s seen us bend over backwards to help <br/>
him get what he wants, and he&#39;s grateful. He doesn&#39;t *say* that, but <br/>
it shows in the ways he&#39;s helpful and friendly and courteous. <br/>

&gt;long...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That *is* the way people react when limitations are lifted. My <br/>
stepson has spent the last...oh, six weeks, I guess, staying up all <br/>
night to play Runescape. He&#39;s decided to switch back to being awake <br/>
in the daytime, though, even though he knows it means less computer <br/>
time - one computer/phone line, four users. Natural limits. He <br/>
misses doing other things, though. Different limits. He&#39;s learning <br/>
to negotiate his *own* wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s gone a similar route with food - he started out eating all the <br/>
chips, cookies and soda he could get his hands on, and we <br/>
facilitated that as much as we could afford. He&#39;s been eating less <br/>
and less, and yesterday announced he didn&#39;t want any soda for <br/>
awhile, would we please not buy any? No pressure from us. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like the way it makes him feel. <br/>
<br/>
In the midst of my trying to get this posted, my neighbor&#39;s dh <br/>
stopped by to say she&#39;s sick and can&#39;t hang with Mo today while Ray <br/>
and I go to the skatepark. I explained to her that this is really <br/>
really important to Ray, and how could we make it possible for her? <br/>
She came up with some ideas and loaded up the car. She can&#39;t get <br/>
what she wants today, but she&#39;s thoughtful and creative and willing <br/>
to work to make the situation possible for All of us. Not bad for 5!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953858448">~~I am teaching my kids that they cannot always have what they want. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to help my kids see that they can have anything and<br/>
everything they want in this life and to trust their innermost desires<br/>
and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to unlearn the &quot;lesson&quot; you just wrote about in my own<br/>
life (after being raised by parents that taught it all too well) and<br/>
now realize I can have everything I want, just not all at once!:) I am<br/>
relearning to trust my instincts, my desires and my fantasies. I am<br/>
learning that &quot;you can&#39;t always have what you want&quot; is a big, fat lie<br/>
and the people that believe it are the ones that don&#39;t achieve their<br/>
goals and dreams.<br/>
<br/>
We work within natural boundaries of budgets, weather, moods and other<br/>
circumstances....but I want my kids to know they CAN have what they<br/>
want and what they want is not only important, but HUGE clues about<br/>
who-they-are and the journey they are creating in this life.<br/>
