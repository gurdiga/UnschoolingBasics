Xylitol - All Natural Sweetener <br/>
Xylitol - Our Sweet Salvation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Xylitol is not only a safe, natural sweetener without the bad side-<br/>
effects of sugar and artificial substitutes, it&#39;s also good for your <br/>
teeth, stabilises insulin and hormone levels and promotes good <br/>
health. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Americans have a mighty hankering for sugar. It seems that we just <br/>
can&#39;t get enough of the stuff. On average, a half a cup of sugar is <br/>
consumed per person every day. It is estimated that the average <br/>
American eats, drinks, slurps, stirs and sprinkles about 150 pounds <br/>
of it annually. Never in modern history has a culture consumed so <br/>
much sugar. <br/>
<br/>
Sugar truly does deserve its reputation as a &quot;white poison&quot;. Thinking <br/>
of sugar as a food is really a stretch of the imagination, because it <br/>
is more a chemical that is difficult for our bodies to utilise and <br/>
digest. Humans were really not designed to eat large amounts of sugar <br/>
in whatever form it may take: white and brown, corn syrup, sucrose, <br/>
dextrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, barley malt, honey, <br/>
rice syrup and maple syrup. Sugar is also highly seductive, acting <br/>
like an addictive drug that lures even the most well-intentioned <br/>
person back into its sweet clutches. <br/>
<br/>
According to Chinese wisdom, sweetness is one of the flavours <br/>
necessary for maintaining balance in the body. But regularly eating <br/>
large amounts of sugar will cause serious harm. Sugar can cause <br/>
hypoglycaemia and weight gain, leading to diabetes and obesity in <br/>
both children and adults. It leaches the body of vital minerals and <br/>
vitamins. It raises blood pressure, triglycerides and the bad <br/>
cholesterol (LDL), increasing the risk of heart disease. It causes <br/>
tooth decay and periodontal disease, which leads to tooth loss and <br/>
systemic infections. It makes it difficult for a child&#39;s brain to <br/>
learn, resulting in a lack of concentration. Both children and adults <br/>
exhibit disruptive behaviour, learning disorders and forgetfulness <br/>
from sugar consumption. It initiates auto-immune and immune <br/>
deficiency disorders such as arthritis, allergies and asthma. It also <br/>
upsets hormonal imbalance and supports the growth of cancer cells.<br/>
<br/>
So what are we to do? Will our sugar-cravings always hold us hostage, <br/>
or is there really a way to lick the sugar habit successfully? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol to the Rescue! <br/>
<br/>
During World War II, Finland was suffering from an acute sugar <br/>
shortage. With no domestic supply of sugar, the Finns searched for an <br/>
alternative. It was then that the Finnish scientists re-discovered <br/>
xylitol, a low-calorie sugar made from birch bark. It had, in fact, <br/>
been known to the world of organic chemistry since it was first <br/>
manufactured in 1891 by a German chemist. <br/>
<br/>
By 1930, xylitol had been purified, but it wasn&#39;t until World War II <br/>
that the sugar shortages forced researchers to look at alternative <br/>
sweeteners. It was only when xylitol was stabilised that it became a <br/>
viable sweetener in foods. It was also during this time that <br/>
researchers discovered xylitol&#39;s insulin-independent nature (it <br/>
metabolises in the body without using insulin). <br/>
<br/>
By the 1960s, xylitol was being used in Germany, Switzerland, the <br/>
Soviet Union and Japan as a preferred sweetener in diabetic diets and <br/>
as an energy source for infusion therapy in patients with impaired <br/>
glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Since then, many other <br/>
countries including Italy and China have been producing xylitol for <br/>
use in their domestic markets--and with remarkable health benefits. <br/>
It has been relatively unknown in the USA and Australia, primarily <br/>
because cheap supplies of cane sugar made the more expensive xylitol <br/>
less economically viable. <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol is a natural substance found in fibrous vegetables and fruit, <br/>
as well as in corn cobs and various hardwood trees like birch. It is <br/>
a natural, intermediate product which regularly occurs in the glucose <br/>
metabolism of man and other animals as well as in the metabolism of <br/>
several plants and micro-organisms. Xylitol is produced naturally in <br/>
our bodies; in fact, we make up to 15 grams daily during normal <br/>
metabolism.<br/>
<br/>
Although xylitol tastes and looks exactly like sugar, that is where <br/>
the similarities end. Xylitol is really sugar&#39;s mirror image. While <br/>
sugar wreaks havoc on the body, xylitol heals and repairs. It also <br/>
builds immunity, protects against chronic degenerative disease and <br/>
has anti-ageing benefits. Xylitol is considered a five-carbon sugar, <br/>
which means it is an antimicrobial, preventing the growth of <br/>
bacteria. While sugar is acid forming, xylitol is alkaline enhancing. <br/>
All other forms of sugar, including sorbitol, another popular <br/>
alternative sweetener, are six-carbon sugars which feed dangerous <br/>
bacteria and fungi.<br/>
<br/>
Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1963, <br/>
xylitol has no known toxic levels. The only discomfort that some <br/>
sensitive people may notice initially when taking large amounts is <br/>
mild diarrhoea or slight cramping. Since the body makes xylitol <br/>
daily, as well as the enzymes to break it down, any discomfort <br/>
usually disappears within a few days as the body&#39;s enzymatic activity <br/>
adjusts to a higher intake. <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol has 40 per cent fewer calories and 75 per cent fewer <br/>
carbohydrates than sugar and is slowly absorbed and metabolised, <br/>
resulting in very negligible changes in insulin. About one-third of <br/>
the xylitol that is consumed is absorbed in the liver. The other two-<br/>
thirds travels to the intestinal tract where it is broken down by gut <br/>
bacteria into short-chain fatty acids. <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol looks, feels and tastes exactly like sugar and leaves no <br/>
unpleasant aftertaste. It is available in many forms. In its <br/>
crystalline form, it can replace sugar in cooking, baking or as a <br/>
sweetener for beverages. It is also included as an ingredient in <br/>
chewing gum, mints and nasal spray. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol and Oral Health <br/>
<br/>
Tooth decay and gum disease are serious problems. According to the <br/>
American Dental Association, 75 per cent of American adults over the <br/>
age of 35 suffer from some form of periodontal disease.1 Needless to <br/>
say, diet plays a major role in dental heath. When there is an excess <br/>
of sugar in the diet, this weakens the immune system and creates an <br/>
acidic environment; thus oral health suffers. The mouth is home to <br/>
over 400 strains of bacteria. Most of these are benign, but when <br/>
sugar enters the scene it feeds the destructive strains, allowing <br/>
them to proliferate. <br/>
<br/>
Periodontal disease is basically caused by bacteria. These deposits <br/>
permit the growth of bacteria that cause inflammation of the gums. <br/>
The bacteria also release minute amounts of toxins that break down <br/>
gum tissue, thereby helping the infection to progress. Plaque is an <br/>
invisible, sticky film of saliva and food residue that constantly <br/>
forms on the teeth. Ongoing low-grade bacterial infection also <br/>
burdens the immune system. <br/>
<br/>
Bacteria help to create plaque and they also thrive within it. Unless <br/>
removed, plaque formed along the gum line can lead to gum disease. <br/>
When left untreated, plaque at or below the gum line hardens into <br/>
tartar. Periodontal disease takes two forms: simple gum inflammation, <br/>
called gingivitis; and a more severe gum infection, called <br/>
periodontitis, which may lead to tooth loss and receding gums. <br/>
<br/>
Gingivitis results from the build-up of plaque and tartar which <br/>
irritate the gum or periodontal tissue. The more advanced state of <br/>
gum disease, periodontitis, occurs when inflammation of the gums is <br/>
accompanied by bone and ligament destruction. Bleeding gums are <br/>
usually the first indication that gum disease is developing, but <br/>
obvious symptoms may not always be present. <br/>
<br/>
Gum infection can also lead to other serious health problems. It <br/>
doubles the risk of stroke, triples the risk of heart attack, <br/>
increases the incidence of premature, low-weight babies and also <br/>
contributes to bronchitis, pneumonia and emphysema. In fact, the same <br/>
bacteria that cause gum disease end up either directly or indirectly <br/>
infecting your heart and arteries. A study conducted at the <br/>
University of Minnesota in 1998 found that rabbits injected with <br/>
tooth plaque developed blood clots which led to heart disease.2 It <br/>
seems that the bacteria first attack the bones and gums in the mouth <br/>
and then enter the bloodstream through small cracks in the gums. <br/>
<br/>
Eating sugar causes tooth decay by creating a highly acidic condition <br/>
in the mouth. Acidity strips tooth enamel of minerals, causing it to <br/>
weaken and making it more vulnerable to attack by bacteria, leading <br/>
to tooth decay or demineralisation. Ordinarily, saliva bathes the <br/>
mouth with an alkaline solution that neutralises all acidity and <br/>
actually remineralises the teeth. Saliva also washes away leftover <br/>
bits of food and helps the digestion process. But when saliva turns <br/>
acidic because of too many sweets, bacteria in the mouth have a <br/>
feeding frenzy. These nasty bacteria, along with carbohydrate waste, <br/>
stick to the teeth and tongue and hold the acid close to the teeth <br/>
where it eats away enamel. Virtually whatever food you ingest, the <br/>
remaining particles become food for plaque-producing bacteria. Using <br/>
xylitol helps to raise plaque pH, thereby reducing the time that <br/>
teeth are exposed to damaging acids as well as starving harmful <br/>
bacteria of their food source. <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol is a dentist&#39;s dream. It reverses all these destructive <br/>
effects of sugar on oral health. Xylitol is non-fermentable and <br/>
therefore cannot be converted to acids by oral bacteria, thus it <br/>
helps to restore a proper alkaline/acid balance in the mouth. This <br/>
alkaline environment is inhospitable to all the destructive bacteria, <br/>
especially the worst variety, Streptococcus mutans. It also inhibits <br/>
plaque formation. <br/>
<br/>
Using xylitol right before bedtime, after brushing and flossing, <br/>
protects and heals the teeth and gums. Unlike sugar, it can even be <br/>
left on the teeth overnight. With proper use, xylitol actually stops <br/>
the fermentation process leading to tooth decay. Long-term use <br/>
suppresses the most harmful strains of oral bacteria, making a long-<br/>
lasting change in those bacterial communities. Xylitol even has the <br/>
ability to enhance the mineralisation of the enamel. It is most <br/>
effective in treating small decay spots. Although larger cavities <br/>
won&#39;t go away, they can harden and become less sensitive. <br/>
<br/>
Consistently using small amounts of xylitol tends to increase <br/>
protective factors in saliva. Xylitol stimulates saliva flow and <br/>
helps keep salivary minerals in a useful form. Prolonged xylitol use <br/>
increases the buffering capacity and protective factors in saliva. <br/>
Increased saliva production is especially important for people <br/>
suffering with a dry mouth due to illness, ageing or drug side-<br/>
effects. <br/>
<br/>
Since the oral environment becomes less acidic with continued xylitol <br/>
use, it is advisable to chew xylitol gum or suck a xylitol mint after <br/>
every meal or after eating sweet snacks. The best news is that <br/>
studies have shown that xylitol&#39;s effect is long-lasting and possibly <br/>
even permanent. <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol has recently received positive support in the Journal of the <br/>
American Dental Association. &quot;Xylitol is an effective preventive <br/>
agent against dental caries ... Consumption of xylitol-containing <br/>
chewing gum has been demonstrated to reduce caries in Finnish <br/>
teenagers by 30&endash;60 per cent. Studies conducted in Canada, <br/>
Thailand, Polynesia and Belize have shown similar results...&quot;3 A <br/>
study conducted at Harvard School of Dental Medicine concluded <br/>
that &quot;xylitol can significantly decrease the incidence of dental <br/>
caries&quot;.4<br/>
<br/>
Another unexpected benefit came from a Finnish study which showed <br/>
that children whose teeth are colonised between 19 and 31 months of <br/>
age by Streptococcus mutans bacteria are more likely to have a large <br/>
number of cavities. Most children acquire this bacteria from their <br/>
mother&#39;s saliva through food tasting, sharing cups and kissing. The <br/>
study showed a dramatic 70 per cent reduction in tooth decay among <br/>
children whose mothers chewed xylitol gum.5<br/>
<br/>
Xylitol, however, isn&#39;t just for the young. In a paper published in <br/>
the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, researchers tested <br/>
111 adults aged 60 and older over a 12-month period. All were frail <br/>
but healthy adults. In the study, one group of volunteers chewed no <br/>
gum, a second chewed gum containing xylitol, and a third group chewed <br/>
gum containing both xylitol and an antimicrobial. In the two groups <br/>
receiving gum, the participants chewed two pieces for 15 minutes, two <br/>
times per day. At the end of the study, the researchers reported that <br/>
the group who received xylitol gum had substantially lowered their <br/>
risk of developing thrush, a fungal or yeast infection that can cause <br/>
mouth soreness. (The group who received xylitol plus the <br/>
antimicrobial had equal benefits.) It had also reduced their risk of <br/>
developing angular cheilitis, a condition in which sores develop in <br/>
the corners of the mouth. The researchers noted that xylitol gum can <br/>
provide a &quot;real clinical benefit&quot; to frail, elderly people.6<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol and Ear, Nose and Throat Infections <br/>
<br/>
Recurring middle ear infections pose a great health threat to <br/>
children. Tubes are often inserted into the ear drum in children with <br/>
these recurring infections to reduce the fluid that is attempting to <br/>
wash out the infection from the middle ear. While this procedure <br/>
sometimes helps to reduce the frequency of infections, it is also <br/>
designed to help with hearing. <br/>
<br/>
Language, a critical part of learning, is built by auditory input <br/>
during the first two years of life--the same period when ear <br/>
infections are most common. If this input is dampened by infection or <br/>
fluid in the middle ear during this important period, it can cause <br/>
learning problems. One researcher demonstrated that even when <br/>
properly treated, recurrent middle ear infections during the first <br/>
two years result in significant impairment in reading ability up to <br/>
the age of nine.7 Another study followed children longer and showed <br/>
significant learning and social problems extending up to age <br/>
eighteen.8<br/>
<br/>
One of xylitol&#39;s versatile benefits is its ability to inhibit the <br/>
growth of bacteria that cause middle ear infections in young <br/>
children. In two recent studies involving over 1,000 children, <br/>
xylitol-flavoured chewing gum was found to reduce the incidence of <br/>
middle ear infections by 40 per cent, significantly decreasing <br/>
ongoing middle ear complications and the need for antibiotics. <br/>
<br/>
Regularly washing the nose with a spray containing xylitol decreases <br/>
the number of harmful bacteria and stimulates normal defensive <br/>
washing of this area. A clean nose reduces problems with allergies <br/>
and asthma that originate from nasal irritants and pollutants. <br/>
Current research shows how bacteria attach to cells in the body, <br/>
causing infection. Some sugars like xylitol are known to be able to <br/>
interfere with this binding, blocking the attachment of the major <br/>
infection-causing bacteria that live in the nose. Dr Lon Jones, a <br/>
physician in Plainsview, Texas, reported that the use of a xylitol <br/>
nasal spray in his practice prevented 93 per cent of ear infections <br/>
and resulted in comparable reductions in sinus infections, allergies <br/>
and asthma.9<br/>
<br/>
Xylitol has been shown to be effective in inhibiting Candida <br/>
albicans, a serious systemic yeast problem, and other harmful gut <br/>
bacteria including H. pylori, implicated in periodontal disease, bad <br/>
breath, gastric and duodenal ulcers and even stomach cancer. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol and Osteoporosis <br/>
<br/>
Another exciting benefit from xylitol is its role in reversing bone <br/>
loss. Studies in Finland found that xylitol maintained bone density <br/>
in rats that had their ovaries removed. Without ovaries, oestrogen <br/>
levels plummeted and so did the bone density in rats that were not <br/>
given xylitol. However, in the rats that had ovaries removed and were <br/>
given xylitol, bone density actually increased.10 Another study <br/>
showed that xylitol was effective in decreasing age-related bone loss <br/>
in older male rats by 10 per cent.11<br/>
<br/>
In an unprecedented action, the Finnish researchers made bold <br/>
recommendations for human application of their studies. They <br/>
suggested that an effective human dose would be about 40 grams daily. <br/>
The scientists speculated that xylitol&#39;s bone density enhancing <br/>
properties are due to its ability to promote intestinal absorption of <br/>
calcium. Including xylitol in one&#39;s diet is certainly an enjoyable <br/>
way to reap the benefits of greater bone density, along with other <br/>
health benefits. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Xylitol and Insulin Resistance, Diabetes Hypertension and Hormonal <br/>
Imbalances<br/>
<br/>
Consuming sugar and other refined carbohydrates results in the rapid <br/>
release of glucose, or blood sugar. In response, the pancreas <br/>
secretes insulin to usher glucose into the cells, where it is burned <br/>
for energy. Excess glucose stresses the system, and over time the <br/>
cells become less responsive to insulin. This condition, known as <br/>
insulin resistance, is a huge health problem and it is estimated to <br/>
affect half the American population. Insulin resistance is associated <br/>
with abnormalities in cholesterol and triglyceride levels, <br/>
hypertension, increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.<br/>
<br/>
The dramatic rise in type-2 diabetes since the mid-1900s directly <br/>
coincides with our increased consumption of sugar. One long-term <br/>
study of more than 65,000 women demonstrated that a high-sugar, low-<br/>
fibre diet increased the risk of type-2 diabetes by 250 per cent. <br/>
Another recent study found that excessive intake of sugar was the <br/>
single most important dietary risk factor for heart disease in women <br/>
and for men. It has been estimated that sugar intake may account for <br/>
more than 150,000 premature deaths from heart disease in the United <br/>
States each year.12<br/>
<br/>
Xylitol has been demonstrated in repeated clinical studies to be very <br/>
slowly metabolised. In fact, on the glycaemic index, which measures <br/>
how quickly foods enter the bloodstream, sugar is rated at 100 and <br/>
xylitol at just seven! Xylitol is a natural insulin stabiliser, <br/>
therefore it causes none of the abrupt rises and falls that occur <br/>
with sugar. In fact, it actually helps in stopping sugar and <br/>
carbohydrate cravings. Foods sweetened with xylitol will not raise <br/>
insulin levels. This makes it a perfect sweetener for people with <br/>
diabetes as well as those wanting to lose weight. There is a growing <br/>
consensus amongst anti-ageing researchers that maintaining low <br/>
insulin levels is a key to a successful anti-ageing program. <br/>
<br/>
Insulin resistance also plays a significant role in hormonal <br/>
imbalances, including those that lead to breast cancer. High insulin <br/>
levels increase the production of oestrogens, leading to an oestrogen-<br/>
dominant condition, and also interfere with healthy ovarian function. <br/>
Insulin resistance is a major cause of a growing hormonal problem <br/>
called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS causes the ovaries to <br/>
become anovulatory, which means that the normal cyclic production of <br/>
oestrogen followed by progesterone either ceases or becomes <br/>
dysfunctional. Insulin stimulates the ovaries to produce <br/>
predominantly male hormones, which, in combination with higher <br/>
insulin and glucose levels, increase weight-gain around the waist--a <br/>
body type that is a risk factor for breast cancer. Signs that the <br/>
body is being exposed to higher levels of the male hormones include <br/>
acne, loss of head hair and an increase in body hair. Lowering <br/>
insulin levels is crucial for not only treating PCOS but also <br/>
resolving most other hormonal imbalances, including those leading to <br/>
breast cancer.13 <br/>
<br/>
Dr John Lee, author of What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Breast <br/>
Cancer, explains the connection between insulin resistance and breast <br/>
cancer:<br/>
&quot;Overeating junk food makes you fat. Increased body fat and lack of <br/>
exercise lead to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to <br/>
further craving of sugary carbohydrates to generate energy for the <br/>
body. More insulin is released in response to increased carbohydrate <br/>
intake, leading to more weight gain. More fat leads to more <br/>
estrogens, which, in turn, lead to earlier breast development and <br/>
menstruation. Earlier onset of menstruation leads to more ovulatory <br/>
cycles and a greater lifetime exposure to oestrogens without adequate <br/>
progesterone. A greater lifetime exposure to estrogens increases <br/>
breast cancer risk.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Simultaneously, increased consumption of simple carbohydrates, <br/>
coupled with insulin resistance, leads to polycystic ovaries and lack <br/>
of ovulation during menstrual cycles, resulting in excess production <br/>
of androgens and estrogens, along with inadequate production of <br/>
progesterone. Excessive estrogen production in the absence of <br/>
progesterone production leads to estrogen dominance and increased <br/>
breast cancer risk. Use of contraceptive hormones increases insulin <br/>
resistance, exacerbating all the above problems.&quot;14<br/>
<br/>
Using xylitol instead of sugar as well as reducing intake of high-<br/>
glycaemic, refined carbohydrate foods helps to lower the risk not <br/>
only of PCOS but also of ovarian cysts, fibroids, endometriosis, PMS, <br/>
hot flushes, weight gain and depression. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Safer Sweetener<br/>
<br/>
Increased sugar consumption has bedevilled Western cultures with more <br/>
and more health problems, many of which are putting an enormous <br/>
strain on health care systems. Finally, there is an answer to our <br/>
collective prayers for something truly healthy that can also satisfy <br/>
our sweet tooth. Over 1,500 scientific studies have found that the <br/>
more you use xylitol, the more you can eliminate sugar cravings, <br/>
reduce insulin levels and alkalinise your body. It&#39;s a great aid on <br/>
the way to good health and long life. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine never having to feel those twinges of guilt when you bite <br/>
into a xylitol-sweetened brownie. Or how about increasing your bone <br/>
density while enjoying your favourite hot drink with two spoonfuls of <br/>
xylitol crystals, or knowing that xylitol-sweetened chewing gum is <br/>
preventing cavities and gum disease? <br/>
<br/>
With xylitol, you can now have your sweet tooth and treat it, too!<br/>
