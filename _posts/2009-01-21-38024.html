<div id="ygrps-yiv-675025636">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 year old daughter who attended a preschool for the last 1.5<br/>
years, while I finished up grad school.  Now, I am done and cannot<br/>
find a job, so I took her out of school to save money and to give us<br/>
some time to spend together (like we used to before I started school).<br/>
 She is a bright, sweet, loving child who has been AP&#39;ed from the<br/>
beginning.  She loved her first year of preschool, but the last<br/>
semester was a nightmare for both of us.  She became an outsider<br/>
because of one little girl who did not like her, and the teachers<br/>
would not listen to my concerns about the situation.  She has been so<br/>
much happier in the last six weeks since she left school, and I want<br/>
to explore my options in the next 7 months or so that we have before<br/>
pre-K starts.  (School starts at 4 here, but it&#39;s not compulsory until<br/>
age 7).<br/>
<br/>
What are some good ways to get started?  I plan to hit our local<br/>
library to see if I can find some books, but I&#39;d like some<br/>
recommendations for a book to buy.  Money is tight right now, so if<br/>
you could recommend one book for a parent considering unschooling,<br/>
what would it be?<br/>
<br/>
She is very verbal, she can remember complex words and use them<br/>
correctly after hearing them in context a few times.  She has little<br/>
interest in coloring, drawing or painting, except as a diversion when<br/>
she&#39;s bored with other activities.  She likes to help me cook and do<br/>
dishes, and she&#39;s fascinated with our garden.  So what do I do?  My<br/>
gut tells me to just keep her involved in what I&#39;m doing and follow<br/>
her interests from there.  We go to the library occasionally, and I<br/>
plan to do that more often these next few months.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is appreciated, I&#39;m glad I found this group!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66293073">I&#39;ve been Radically Unschooling our 3 children under 6 only for a year.  <br/>
<br/>
The websites recommended as well as Danielle Conger&#39;s website <br/>
<br/>
www.danielleconger.organiclearning.com   (I think)  were of great help for me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John Holt books at the library.<br/>
<br/>
connections.organiclearning.com     (not in production anymore but you can view the issues for free now.)  <br/>
<br/>
I have to 2nd the recommendation for Rue Kream&#39;s book.  &quot;Parenting a Free Child.&quot;  If you have a little money---that&#39;s the one I&#39;d get.  The rest you might be able to borrow from other unschoolers in your area.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a whirlwind getting started.  A little painful for me to deschool at times but also thrilling.  Your Dd is 4, you say?  That&#39;s pretty young.  You might be surprised at how little you have to &quot;do.&quot;  For a long while this year, I did quite a bit of worrying about &quot;doing,&quot; while my kids went about living their lives.  I&#39;ve decided to join them.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you.  Have fun!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574338259">Thanks for the resources Melissa and Brad.<br/>
<br/>
I am in a very, very &quot;red&quot; state, which has me doubtful that our local<br/>
library will have many resources on the topic.  I do know of another<br/>
family that is unschooling in our town, and we keep running into a<br/>
little girl at our favorite bookstore that is homeschooled.  She is so<br/>
sweet, she always wants to read to dd.  I intend to strike up a<br/>
conversation with her mom sometime, they don&#39;t seem like the &quot;doing it<br/>
for religious reasons&quot; type.  There is a homeschool group here, but<br/>
nearly all of them are religious and curriculum based.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the direction, I have a lot of reading to do!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, she will learn what she needs to (the medicine), because she&#39;ll<br/>
learn it to enable her to pursue what she&#39;s passionate about (the sugar)?<br/>
<br/>
She told me a couple of days ago that she wants to learn how to make<br/>
her own clothes.  So we went to the craft store over the weekend and<br/>
got some fabric to make no-sew pillows, for her dolls, and some yarn<br/>
and kid sized knitting needles.  I am now teaching myself some basic<br/>
knitting and I was able to find a large, blunt ended needle in my<br/>
mom&#39;s old sewing basket so she can learn to hand stitch.<br/>
<br/>
I am really starting to see how this could work for us.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
considered homeschooling, but didn&#39;t think it would work for us<br/>
because she doesn&#39;t like to do much of anything that I suggest.  My<br/>
husband is dubious, but supportive.  He felt the same way about AP in<br/>
the beginning.  It seems to me that unschooling is a logical extension<br/>
of AP, doing what is best for the child, following your intuition and<br/>
the child&#39;s cues.  I&#39;m so thankful that she and I have this time<br/>
together to explore unschooling.  It&#39;s been a lot of fun already!</div>
