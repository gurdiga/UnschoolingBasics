&gt; Sydney 9 1/2 has been unschooled since age 6 or so.  She periodically likes<br/>
&gt; to &quot;play school&quot; but she&#39;s very serious about it.  Anyway, she&#39;s asking for<br/>
&gt; &quot;school books :  Math, history, spelling, science, books.&quot;  I want to get<br/>
&gt; her stuff she&#39;ll find intenerating and that isn&#39;t obnoxiously schooly.  Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions?  books you like that are sort of subjects but in a fun way. <br/>
<br/>

I just ordered some Miquon math books and Cuisenaire rods for this very reason.  My dd11 is &quot;doing school&quot; right now.  She decides what she wants to study and then picks out her own stuff from what we have around the house, but she didn&#39;t like any of the math books we had.  She also likes Draw Write Now books, and asked me to get her another of those.   <br/>
<br/>
Scholastic has some books that are &quot;Homework Helpers&quot; that summarize subjects like American History, Science, and English.  I think she&#39;s reading through a couple of those as part of her schedule.   I really like those because the information is bulletted and easy (for me, anyway) to read.    <br/>
