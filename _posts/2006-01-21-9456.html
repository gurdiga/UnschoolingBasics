<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950807208">&quot;3) How do you deal with conflict in your homes?  I understand that with<br/>
mutual respect the ideal will be that conflict is hardly experienced but<br/>
with varying personalities in a household there is bound to be some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really wanted to answer about all the questions on kids fighting,<br/>
but I find it exhausting so I&#39;m just finally getting around to it......<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ve come so far in regards to this, the only two that seem<br/>
to have conflicts anymore are my youngest. Sierra is 8 and Jalen is<br/>
almost 5 and if it weren&#39;t for his intensity, I don&#39;t think even they<br/>
would fight.<br/>
But here&#39;s how we deal with conflict.<br/>
First of all (and most importantly) I don&#39;t view conflict as fighting.<br/>
It&#39;s a disagreement. Unless people are trying to hit or hurt in some<br/>
way, it&#39;s just a disagreement. Kids need to have disagreements with<br/>
each other (and with us) in order to figure out the world, develop<br/>
their own ideas and stake their ground on this earth.<br/>
<br/>
So conflict isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. It&#39;s HOW we &quot;discuss&quot;/argue<br/>
that matters.  And I expect young children to NOT have the necessary<br/>
tools for healthy disagreement, they just don&#39;t have the experience or<br/>
maturity for it yet.<br/>
So my presence is the most important factor. If they&#39;re having a great<br/>
day, things are going along smoothly, I still check in and connect<br/>
with them occasionally (this really helps Jalen especially).  If<br/>
things are rough, right from the get-go, I KNOW that&#39;s my cue to stay<br/>
present with them. It&#39;s a sign that they can&#39;t handle things on their<br/>
own and need an advocate.<br/>
<br/>
When a conflict arises &quot;MOM, Jalen grabbed my playdough&quot; I ask her to<br/>
please let me handle it and I talk calmly and quietly to him. I tell<br/>
him that he needs to give it back and can we find another color (or<br/>
whatever it is HE needs to feel safe enough to hand it back).<br/>
<br/>
It takes time and patience, but we&#39;re the adults and need to model<br/>
healthy behavior amidst conflict (I don&#39;t always do this btw, but it<br/>
gets easier and easier).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they both need to tell me how mad they are at the other<br/>
person, listening deeply to them solves the problem. Sometimes I have<br/>
to stay right there, because Jalen is provoking it all.....and if it<br/>
can&#39;t be solved that way, I get him AWAY from her.<br/>
<br/>
One of my other tools, is getting one of them busy with something fun<br/>
(the computer really works well) and spending some one on one time<br/>
with the other. If you have 3 or more that are dealing with conflict,<br/>
you might have to get really creative!:)<br/>
Finding a game to play, having some cuddle time, basically look at it<br/>
as &quot;filling them up&quot;. Once they have all the Mom love, the day can<br/>
really smooth out.<br/>
<br/>
Another tool is CHANGE OF SCENERY!  When there is conflict, or yucky<br/>
energy in the house, getting out and doing something different, or<br/>
just driving around can help. Make sure you know what is causing the<br/>
conflict first, because hungry or tired kids aren&#39;t going to make a<br/>
shift by going somewhere new!! It&#39;s just going to make your day worse.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, if it&#39;s just a general negative energy because maybe they need<br/>
different stimulation, then a park or drive or walk or throwing stones<br/>
in the creek or?? can really help.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to shift the energy is to bring out some new and<br/>
interesting foods or toys. I like having artsy stuff, or snacks that<br/>
we haven&#39;t tried yet or little (dollar store) stickers or toys hidden<br/>
away for desperate moments. That&#39;s a great distraction and can also<br/>
give you a bit of time with one child. Changes the energy in the home<br/>
very quickly most of  the time.<br/>
<br/>
We have a standing protocol here. If you have a conflict you use your<br/>
WORDS with the other person and tell them to STOP. If that does not<br/>
work,you go find an advocate (parent or older sib) to assist you in<br/>
dealing with the conflict. If  none of the above works, THEN you can<br/>
hit.  Well, we never get to the third phase, because the advocate<br/>
always works.:)  I coach them a lot as to &quot;you could try this next<br/>
time&quot; or &quot;use words&quot; or &quot;talk calmly when you&#39;re telling her&quot; etc...<br/>
<br/>
Just generally useful conflict resolution techniques. And they get<br/>
better and better at it as they get older. Amazingly better!<br/>
<br/>
If something does get to the harm stage, we definitely separate them.<br/>
Not as a punishment at all...it&#39;s a time to keep the victim safe and<br/>
talk with both of them about what happened (they usually need sympathy<br/>
on both ends and then ideas about how to handle it better next time)<br/>
and give lots of hugs.<br/>
When I&#39;m really in tune with them, being present, this just doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen. So when you hear a lot of conflict, ugly voices etc... that&#39;s<br/>
your cue to BE in their world completely and totally. It&#39;s just a cue,<br/>
not anything to get upset about, not anything more than your call to<br/>
be the best parent you can be at that moment.<br/>
