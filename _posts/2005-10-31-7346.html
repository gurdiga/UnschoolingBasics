<div id="ygrps-yiv-446658606">I just need to clarify I guess to feel if unschooling in the larger <br/>
sense is what we do.   If, a year or 2 or 3 from now Allie or Libby <br/>

deem &quot;educational&quot; or &quot;schoolish&quot; and did not want to read or be read <br/>
to or play games that involved math skills or did not want to <br/>
write/journal, etc. - and what they wanted to do was watch tv, play <br/>
video games (we don&#39;t even own any video games, but..).  Essentially, <br/>
they did not want to be involved in our real life activities or any <br/>
of their interests that involve these skills (I can&#39;t even IMAGINE <br/>
this happening).  They made a choice for an extended period of time - <br/>
I&#39;m talking beyond just a few months.   I would not shrug my <br/>

would talk, find out if there is something going on, if they are <br/>

(once again, I can&#39;t even imagine this for that long) I would not <br/>
think it was okay.   And if I am interpreting things correctly, THAT <br/>
would NOT be unschooling, right?  So keeping in mind that I can not <br/>
even fathom this circumstance  I am trying to stretch my brain and <br/>
overthink more than I typically do to imagine if this happened.  And <br/>
in our home/family that would not be okay.  But someone asked a while <br/>
back that same kind of scenario and stated that if I was not okay <br/>
with letting it go that that wasn&#39;t unschooling.  Could someone <br/>
clarify for me....I do not want to call ourselves something in our <br/>
home and to others that would give the wrong impression of what we do <br/>
or do not do or of what we think is acceptable or not.<br/>

<br/>
This is kind of a bizarre question. What is it that you would actually do in this case? Sit them down with workbooks, assign reading material, have them write essays? I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re thinking of here. <br/>
<br/>
I have a 16 year old son that LOVES video games. He hasn&#39;t always. He didn&#39;t get his first one until he was 13, but now he&#39;s passionate about them. He has friends online that he plays with, he reads magazines about them, searches for cheat codes, watches shows about them, dresses up as characters for Halloween, etc. Do I think it&#39;s okay. Yes. Do I also offer lots of opportunities to expand his world in other ways. Yes! And even with his passion for gaming, he also reads lots, goes to museums, nourishes his spiritual side, loves science and history shows, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I think in this case you&#39;re taking the scenario out to an extreme that doesn&#39;t exist. My son is a gamer first and foremost. He still has lots of other interests and pursuits. If you offer interesting options, they WILL take you up on some of them. <br/>

<br/>
Rebecca, I think I am qualified to answer this for you since I have <br/>
been there.  Children are going to go through periods of time that <br/>
they don&#39;t want to do anything but watch tv and play video games.  My <br/>
son is learning to read through video games along with a lot of other <br/>
things!  We went through an entire year (after a death in the family, <br/>
a move, and leaving a very legalistic church that we were raised in) <br/>
that we basically didn&#39;t do anything except sit around the house and <br/>
play and my kids are FINE!  We don&#39;t label things &quot;education&quot; <br/>
or &quot;schoolish&quot;, we live a fun and interesting life and they learn <br/>
things through living.  I don&#39;t really give any thought to what they <br/>
are learning or if it is &quot;educational&quot; but I know they are when I am <br/>
in the store trying to figure out a sale price (percentage) and my ten <br/>
year old, that does not do any kind of formal math, gives me the <br/>
answer.  How did he learn that?  Through living with a family that <br/>
leads an interesting life and involves their children in ALL aspects <br/>
of their lives including buying and selling real estate, paying bills, <br/>
managing a budget, etc.  I think the one thing that you are missing, <br/>
but you are almost there, is simply trusting that your kids will learn <br/>
what they need to know to get along in this big ol&#39; world.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t known a child, that is trusted and given the resources, that <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to figure out the world around them.  Kids are naturally <br/>
interested in knowing things.  The only instance, that I know of, that <br/>
a child will resist learning is when they are coerced to do so.  And <br/>
every child is going to have different things that they want or need <br/>
to know.  I have NEVER in my life used algebra so all the years that I <br/>
was forced to do algebra was wasted time that I could have used for <br/>
much more interesting things that would have been more meaningful for <br/>
MY life.  I think ONLY our children can be the judge of what <br/>
information they are going to need for THEIR lives.  Our job is to put <br/>
lots of interesting things out for them and expose them to lots of <br/>
different things but not to force anything.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the movies etc. that you feel they shouldn&#39;t be watching, <br/>
etc................Are there things that you watch or are exposed to <br/>
that you just don&#39;t care for and then decide not to watch or be a part <br/>
of?  Does your husband ever tell you &quot;Sorry honey, you can&#39;t watch <br/>
that, it is just not something you should be watching.&quot;  You decide <br/>
those things for yourself right?  The same should be true of kids.  <br/>
Otherwise, it is fear that is ruling you.   I am a Christian so I do <br/>
understand your thought process because I was there once, the problem <br/>
is that kids have to touch, feel, see to figure out how they feel <br/>
about certain things.  I remember watching horror movies (sneaking) at <br/>
friends houses that I could get away with it because I was intrigued.  <br/>
My parents said I couldn&#39;t watch them but did it stop me?  Absolutely <br/>
not.  I found out on my own that I don&#39;t care for them because they <br/>
freak me out so I don&#39;t watch them anymore. <br/>
<br/>
I had an incident last night where my daughter wanted to watch the <br/>
Prophecy and I was a little leary because I know she is very sensitive <br/>
and gets nightmares so my husband told her about every scary part of <br/>
the movie and we talked about how that might make her feel to watch <br/>
that.  She said that it would probably make her feel bad but she still <br/>
wanted to watch it.  I told her that I would be in my room so if she <br/>
got scared she could come sit with me.  Within five minutes she was in <br/>
my room telling me that her eyes told her they didn&#39;t want to watch <br/>
those things.  <br/>
<br/>
It is all about letting go and trusting that your kids will figure out <br/>
those things on there own.  Someone on one of these lists has this on <br/>
their signature line, from a website:  This deep self, our wise and <br/>
knowing simple animal being, when not interfered with unerringly, <br/>
instinctively moves us toward that which grows and nurtures us.  Just <br/>
as unfailing, it moves us away from all that endangers us on any <br/>
level.  Robyn Posin<br/>
<br/>
I know, from experience with my children, that this is very true.  It <br/>
is all about TRUST!!<br/>

was indeed taking my example to the extreme (I can&#39;t imagine them NOT <br/>
being interested in SOMETHING that was going to result in true <br/>
learning).  I guess I was wondering if that was something that went <br/>
on in your homes/lives.  Children &quot;choosing&quot; to not learn through <br/>
their interests/passions.  And sorry, I don&#39;t consider watching <br/>
television 8 to 10 hours a day for months and months on end very high <br/>
in the area of quality learning (yes, lots of learning comes through <br/>
television, even in our home - I think sometimes a shockingly large <br/>
amount - lol).  There&#39;d be some serious sparking of other interests <br/>
going on at that point in our home.<br/>

I do not want in their minds at this point in their young lives.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602205130">Rebecca, there is a difference between someone who calls themselves an <br/>
unschooler and someone who calls themselves radical unschoolers.  <br/>
Radical unschoolers or whole life unschoolers take the philosophy into <br/>
ALL areas of their lives.  This usually happens with most unschoolers <br/>
simply because if you trust them enough to know what they need to <br/>
know, why wouldn&#39;t you trust them in other areas of their lives?  <br/>
There is really no line there and you usually drift into whole life <br/>
unschooling without even realizing it (was the case for me). From what <br/>
I can gather from your posts I would say you are a beginning <br/>
unschooler, not quite grasping the philosophy completely but <br/>
questioning it enough that you might eventually get there. I think the <br/>
basic thing that everyone is trying to get across to you is to <br/>
question everything you do!  So many of our thoughts and actions are <br/>
reflex thoughts and actions based on how we were raised and what <br/>
society is telling us and we need to question that CONSTANTLY.  No one <br/>
can tell you how to live or parent, we are simply telling you how it <br/>
is when you live the radical unschooling life, the way we are <br/>
passionate about living, what you do with that is up to you.<br/>

call our little kids in and put them in a chair and say, &quot;Watch this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We carefully chose what WE watched when the little kids were around.  <br/>
And we fast forwarded through things, we muted the sound, we  <br/>

something I thought would disturb them, usually I&#39;d just get up and  <br/>

movie and I&#39;d watch it another time. Or we&#39;d just turn it to  <br/>
something else or turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do your 5 and 7 year olds want to watch something that you think is  <br/>
bad for them? Are they asking to watch something you think you need  <br/>
to filter?<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 20, 18, and 14. When they were little they wanted to  <br/>
watch Mr. Rogers and other PBS children&#39;s shows, mostly. They were  <br/>
thrilled with a few Disney movies (Beauty and the Beast, for example)  <br/>
and scared of others. I&#39;m wondering where your kids are getting the  <br/>
idea of watching things you think need to be filtered?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m STILL telling my kids not to watch &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot;  <br/>
because i think it&#39;ll be disturbing. There are movies I wish I&#39;d  <br/>
never watched (as an adult). But, these days, my kids are more likely  <br/>
to warn ME about something - tell me when they think I won&#39;t like it.  <br/>
My almost-21 year old rented the first season of &quot;Lost&quot; earlier this  <br/>
week. She told me I probably wouldn&#39;t like it - too gory in the first  <br/>
couple of episodes and it involves paranormal stuff which she knows  <br/>
always seems really boring to me (X-Files, for example, just put me  <br/>
to sleep).<br/>
<br/>
It SEEMS like you think that the kids will want to do some pretty  <br/>
stupid things if adults don&#39;t set limits - stay up all night, watch  <br/>
inappropriate tv, eat junk food?  AND this is typically true, so I  <br/>
can see how one would believe it. It is true of kids who live in a  <br/>
world of limits. But kids who live in a world of opportunities and  <br/>
support and help in getting what they want, rather than constraints  <br/>
and controls, seem to be able to &quot;choose&quot; intelligently for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie (my 14 yo) is at an overnight Halloween party tonight. I have  <br/>
absolutely no doubt that she&#39;ll eat well - probably won&#39;t even eat  <br/>
any candy at all - maybe will have a piece of pie, plus some regular  <br/>
food. She&#39;ll stay up a bit too late (it is a party) and she&#39;ll go in  <br/>
the other room and do something else if a too-scary movie is watched.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana is at a party where there will be alcohol - it is mostly  <br/>
college students, ages from about 16 to 30 or so. She won&#39;t drink,  <br/>
she won&#39;t get in a car with anybody who has been drinking. If there  <br/>
is too much drinking, she&#39;ll get bored and she&#39;ll get a ride home  <br/>
with somebody who hasn&#39;t had anything to drink or she&#39;ll call me. I  <br/>
picked her and another 18 yo girl up from another party earlier this  <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
Roya is asleep - she had a night class and came home at 10 pm and  <br/>
went to bed. She&#39;s busy with college and work and other activities  <br/>
and even though she &quot;could&quot; stay up as late as she wants, she chooses  <br/>
to go to sleep early so she&#39;ll feel good tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Better to let them start making all the choices possible when they&#39;re  <br/>
little, Rebecca, so that you can trust them to make good choices when  <br/>
they get older and the choices are serious ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489932384">You made some good points Pam, maybe that is the idea that I was <br/>
missing when I responded.  My kids, because they have been free to <br/>
make their own choices with the support of caring adults, they don&#39;t <br/>
want to do things or watch things or hear things that make them <br/>
uncomfortable.  At the same time, there are times that pop up where <br/>
they really want to do, watch, hear something that they &quot;think&quot; they <br/>
are going to like or are drawn to for some reason or another.  I <br/>
don&#39;t just say &quot;No way, you aren&#39;t going to do that.&quot;  We talk about <br/>
it, what they are going to see, do, whatever and how it might make <br/>
them feel but, ultimately I leave it up to them, but because I am <br/>
there to help and they have the freedom to choose, they choose <br/>
things that make them feel good.  Does that make sense?  It isn&#39;t <br/>
that I just say &quot;Do whatever you want, I don&#39;t care&quot;, they get a lot <br/>
of guidance and we often even discuss our spiritual belief&#39;s and how <br/>
that fits into some things but in the long run I don&#39;t try to <br/>
control them or make those decisions for them.<br/>
<br/>
*Of course they do. Do you think WE turn on &quot;Freddy versus Jason&quot; and<br/>
call our little kids in and put them in a chair and say, &quot;Watch <br/>
this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We carefully chose what WE watched when the little kids were around.<br/>

something else or turn it off.*<br/>
<br/>
I think this is another key, we don&#39;t purposely surround our kids <br/>
with things that we wouldn&#39;t want them to be exposed to.  We try to <br/>
keep our home a peaceful, loving environment filled with healthy <br/>
things, both emotionally and physically.  My family loves to watch <br/>
Medium too but some of the images are way too graphic for my <br/>
daughter but she likes the stories so when we know a scene is coming <br/>
we cover her eyes, which she prefers.<br/>

<br/>
This is because you don&#39;t (yet?) truly see how<br/>

Which is also why you say that you can&#39;t imagine<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103608556">&lt;&lt;7 and 5 year olds still need filtering in what they watch&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  But with my kids, I have found that they really do filter on their own if given a chance.  It is Halloween week, one of our favorite holidays.  Lots of scary movies on with the older kids, the younger ones go do something else or if they feel up to it, watch the movie and use the music as clues as to when to close their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
As far as graphic violence and sexual content, I have yet to see a young kid that actively seeks that out unless for some reason they see it as &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; or something that &quot;big kids do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t watch graphic tv or videos, just doesn&#39;t interest me.  My 14yo does.  I asked her to be considerate of the younger kids and not put that stuff out in front of them, that they will find it on their own soon enough.  She could understand that and is considerate.<br/>
<br/>
My little guys (2 six year olds) stumbled on some porn on the internet.  They immediately came and told me there was &quot;gross stuff&quot; on the computer and could I get them to Disney.com.  It didn&#39;t scar them, it empowered them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Rebecca, I think I am qualified to answer this for you since I <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; been there.  Children are going to go through periods of time <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t want to do anything but watch tv and play video <br/>
&gt; games.  <br/>
&gt; My <br/>
&gt; &gt; son is learning to read through video games along with a lot of <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; &gt; things!  We went through an entire year (after a death in the <br/>
&gt; family, <br/>
&gt; &gt; a move, and leaving a very legalistic church that we were raised <br/>
&gt; in) <br/>
&gt; &gt; that we basically didn&#39;t do anything except sit around the house <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; play and my kids are FINE!  We don&#39;t label things &quot;education&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; or &quot;schoolish&quot;, we live a fun and interesting life and they <br/>
&gt; learn <br/>
&gt; &gt; things through living.  I don&#39;t really give any thought to what <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; &gt; you are almost there, is simply trusting that your kids will <br/>
&gt; learn <br/>
&gt; &gt; what they need to know to get along in this big ol&#39; world.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am there....I see what goes on and just can&#39;t imagine it ever <br/>
&gt; stopping!  I read somewhere that an intense interest will lead <br/>
&gt; everywhere and that is absolutely at the core of what I believe.  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; was indeed taking my example to the extreme (I can&#39;t imagine them <br/>
&gt; NOT <br/>
&gt; being interested in SOMETHING that was going to result in true <br/>
&gt; learning).  I guess I was wondering if that was something that <br/>
&gt; went <br/>
&gt; on in your homes/lives.  Children &quot;choosing&quot; to not learn through <br/>
&gt; their interests/passions.  And sorry, I don&#39;t consider watching <br/>
&gt; television 8 to 10 hours a day for months and months on end very <br/>
&gt; high <br/>
&gt; in the area of quality learning (yes, lots of learning comes <br/>
&gt; through <br/>
&gt; television, even in our home - I think sometimes a shockingly <br/>
&gt; large <br/>
&gt; amount - lol).  There&#39;d be some serious sparking of other <br/>
&gt; interests <br/>
&gt; going on at that point in our home.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as the movies etc. that you feel they shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
&gt; watching, <br/>
&gt; &gt; etc................Are there things that you watch or are <br/>
&gt; exposed <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; that you just don&#39;t care for and then decide not to watch or be <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; part <br/>
&gt; &gt; of?  Does your husband ever tell you &quot;Sorry honey, you can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; watch <br/>
&gt; &gt; that, it is just not something you should be watching.&quot;  You <br/>
&gt; decide <br/>
&gt; &gt; those things for yourself right?  The same should be true of <br/>
&gt; kids.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Otherwise, it is fear that is ruling you.   I am a Christian so <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; &gt; understand your thought process because I was there once, the <br/>
&gt; problem <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I disagree...7 and 5 year olds still need to have filtering <br/>
&gt; done <br/>
&gt; with what they watch.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is all about letting go and trusting that your kids will <br/>
&gt; figure <br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; those things on there own. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7 and 5!!!  There are certain graphic, scary images and language <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; I do not want in their minds at this point in their young lives.  <br/>
&gt; Those things take a second to flash across the screen and are hard <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; get out of their little minds.  I don&#39;t think it has anything to <br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; with trust or not trusting.<br/>

very young children staying up till all hours of the to fully be able <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589512767">&lt;&lt;very young children staying up all night&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;balance and guidelines and a modicum of common sense&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both of these statements can be true though.  When she was 5, I would have been very comfortable with my now 14yo staying up way late without us.  She has always been extremely responsible, understanding of other&#39;s needs, etc..  Funny thing is that she is usually in bed no later than 10 because she has a pretty busy life.  She is frequently angry that people judge her due to her age based on what they assume ALL 14yos are like, rather than on who she is, what her strengths are.<br/>
<br/>
My now 6yo.....don&#39;t know if I will ever be comfortable with his being out of my sight &lt;sigh, grin&gt;.  He has very little concept of danger and is not patient enough yet to wait until somebody is able to help him do things.  So he ends up in situations that scare the pants off me...even when I am fully awake.  So Dan doesn&#39;t stay up late without us....sometimes we all stay up together, sometimes he sleeps with me, sometimes I massage his feet, sometimes I read him a story, but I &quot;gentle&quot; him into resting.  No yelling, no screaming, no tears, no arbitrary &quot;Bedtime is 8:00&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
No arbitrary limits doesn&#39;t mean that the kids (or I for that matter) do whatever we want regardless of the consequences.  We live in a family and so everyone&#39;s needs must be considered.  I try to think of it as living in consensus.  Trying to find a way everyone can be happy, if not completely satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
In consensus, if a member is not able to agree to the action, you try to find a way to meet the member&#39;s concern.  If they are still unable to agree, then the action is simply tabled.<br/>
<br/>
If Zach wants to stay up all night and he is safe and not interfering with others, no problem, everyone can agree to that.  If Zach wants to stay up but is loud and is interfering with people&#39;s sleep, then we try to find a solution.  If we are unable to find a solution and Zach is unwilling to tone down the noise, then Zach&#39;s staying up all night is tabled until we can find a solution.<br/>

&gt; Remember, we do not have arbitrary bedtimes and while you can put a<br/>
&gt; child to bed you cannot make them go to sleep.  I know this.<br/>
<br/>
There are parents who write here who ARE struggling - nearly always  <br/>
it is those who have had pretty inflexible parent-set bedtimes and  <br/>
then, often literally overnight &lt;g&gt;, they removed the set bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who have BEEN controlled and coerced will take time, sometimes a  <br/>
lot of time, to get over that. In the meantime, they&#39;ll often behave  <br/>
in ways that are clearly against their own self-interest (going to  <br/>
bed when sleepy, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
ALSO - the parents haven&#39;t built up a big pile of trust credit, yet,  <br/>
so they don&#39;t get to say, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re getting sleepy - want to  <br/>
cuddle with me and fall asleep?&quot; Their kids RESIST that (because, in  <br/>
the past, their parents made them try to sleep on an arbitrary  <br/>
schedule) - but those who have been raised in true freedom, have no  <br/>
resistance, they&#39;re HAPPY and content to recognize their own sleepiness.<br/>
<br/>
Lifestyles are different, too. There is one family here who has one  <br/>
child and very flexible scheduling in their lives and can pretty much  <br/>
work around any sleep schedule their daughter happens to choose. My  <br/>
family of three kids is very active and has lots of scheduled  <br/>
appointments and obligations - my kids keep themselves pretty well  <br/>
aware of what tomorrow will have in store for them and they adjust  <br/>
their sleep accordingly (being teens, they do sometimes choose far  <br/>
LESS sleep than I could handle as a 53 year old). Even when they were  <br/>
younger, though, they were very aware of the consequences of staying  <br/>
up too late and not having a good day the next day because of fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You say in the quote, above, that you think young kids need some  <br/>
guidance. It SHOCKS me that you&#39;d say that, after all the posts that  <br/>
have been written here - how can you possibly still think that we&#39;re  <br/>
not giving our kids any &quot;guidance?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re using &quot;guidance&quot; as a euphemism and what you  <br/>
really mean is that kids need some level of adult &quot;control&quot; in that  <br/>
area, not just guidance?<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;Pile of Trust Credits&quot; I mentioned earlier comes into play -  <br/>
when I give my kids &quot;guidance,&quot; they have good strong reason to pay  <br/>
attention to it - they KNOW I&#39;m not going to enforce something  <br/>
against their will. If I ask, &quot;Are you getting sleepy?&quot; they had no  <br/>
reason to immediately start claiming they&#39;re NOT sleepy - that&#39;s what  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen in other people&#39;s homes, over and over. Mom says, &quot;Are you  <br/>
getting sleepy?&quot; Kid says, &quot;No, no, no I want to stay up more.&quot; Mom  <br/>
says, &quot;Well, it is getting late, so how about 10 more minutes.&quot; Kid  <br/>
says, &quot;I&#39;m NOT sleepy, REALLY, Mom, pleeeeeease can&#39;t I stay up  <br/>
more?&quot; Mom: &quot;No, it is time for bed. If you don&#39;t go now, you&#39;ll be  <br/>
too sleepy tomorrow.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t HAVE those kinds of bedtime conversations. Never have had.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say, &quot;Are you getting sleepy? You have to get up for an early  <br/>
soccer game tomorrow.&quot; Kid: &quot;Well, yeah, I am starting to get sleepy  <br/>
but I want to finish this game.&quot; Me: &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll just turn down the  <br/>
lights a bit and turn the music off so we can start winding down.&quot;  <br/>
Kid will finish game and come cuddle up and go to sleep - or go get a  <br/>
book and get into bed with some stuffed animals - or sometimes put on  <br/>
a video and fall asleep watching it - or whatever. The kid is in  <br/>
control with the support and guidance of mom. KNOWING that mom isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to MAKE her quit her game and go to sleep when she isn&#39;t ready,  <br/>
there is no reason for the child to resist and that makes it FAR  <br/>
easier for her to go ahead and TAKE the guidance and advice of mom -  <br/>
mom who has been shown by past experience to have good sense about  <br/>
when to sleep, by the way &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

your children wanting to watch tv in the way you&#39;re &quot;imagining&quot; other  <br/>

<br/>
If the answer is yes, that you actually worry about that, then you  <br/>
have a very very different understanding of basic human nature than  <br/>
other unschoolers. Young humans are hardwired to want to learn. The  <br/>
urge to learn has to be crushed out of them, to get rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
If the answer is no, then stop worrying about it. It isn&#39;t going to  <br/>
happen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so...an example from yesterday - Libby (5 on Friday)has <br/>
recently gotten over being sick. We&#39;ve had some late nights and some <br/>
bad nights and I let her know yesterday that she should lay down and <br/>
try and take a nap.  We were going out trick or treating and then out <br/>
to dinner for her birthday with family...it would be another night <br/>
for and she has been reeeeaaaallly overly emotional the past few <br/>
days.  She did initially comlain about laying down but we did talk <br/>
about why, read a story, put her music in and then I rubbed her back <br/>
for a while and cuddled.  She did NOT fall asleep but she rest for <br/>
quite a while.   We did the same thing on Saturday and she did sleep <br/>
for 2 hours and again today and she is asleep.  (By the way, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t typically nap anymore so this is outside of our usual <br/>
routine.) To me that is guidance but not control.  But if I had asked <br/>
her if she was sleepy and felt she needed a rest and let it go at <br/>
that she would have said no.<br/>
<br/>
Mom says, &quot;Are you  <br/>

a set &quot;it&#39;s 8:00 - go to bed&quot; bedtime.  But I do let them know it&#39;s <br/>
getting late, what we have planned, how early everyone has to get up <br/>
or not get up or did get up that day.  And then we just do our <br/>
routine and they go to bed.  I guess I just don&#39;t see that as <br/>
controlling.  We also don&#39;t arbitrarily make them stop something or <br/>
leave in the middle of project or show because &quot;it&#39;s bed time&quot;.  I <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No Pam.  I cannot imagine this ever happening in our home.  And I <br/>
definitely need to stop worrying about what everyone&#39;s individual <br/>
interpretation of unschooling is...stop worrying/thinking/analyzing <br/>
if what we do is unschooling.  I need to stop worrying about <br/>
hypothetical situations that I cannot even in my wildest imagination <br/>
think would possibly happen.  I guess there is no point in imagining <br/>
how I would react if something happened that I don&#39;t ever forsee <br/>
happening happened and my reaction to that unimaginable happening was <br/>
not one of a true unschooler when I just don&#39;t see the imagined <br/>
situation happening at all, ever.  Whew....lol lol!<br/>
<br/>
You have all helped me though to see some things more clearly.  I <br/>
really don&#39;t feel comfortable saying that we&#39;re unschoolers based on <br/>
what I have been reading. I don&#39;t know that I would want someone to <br/>
make an association between some of the more radical unschooling <br/>
lifestyle ideas and what we do.  I think there is more of an <br/>
underlying philosophy to unschooling than I was completely aware of <br/>
and that I don&#39;t completely agree with. This realization isn&#39;t going <br/>
to change what we do, how we learn or what I believe in.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t feel comfortable with the correlation. Others may hear that we <br/>
don&#39;t do school, use any curriculum, follow our children&#39;s <br/>
interests/gifts and passions, use real life and real books and assume <br/>
that unschooling is what we do...but it&#39;s that underlying philosophy <br/>
and the extreme to which it can go that&#39;s just not us.  But I would <br/>
not have known that if not for your patient listening and answering <br/>
of my scads of questions.  I&#39;m happy to just continue living and <br/>
learning as we have been - respectfully and mindfully so - and not <br/>
worry about &quot;what&quot; we are or where we fit.  Unschooling is just a <br/>
word right?  What matters is what we do and how we live! <br/>

unschoolers, just not radical unschoolers.  As time went on it was <br/>

happened without me hardly noticing it, the trust and mindfulness just <br/>
extended naturally into all areas of our lives.  I can also say that <br/>
sometimes reading about radical unschooling doesn&#39;t make as much sense <br/>
as seeing it in motion.  I remember lots of times when my sister, Ren, <br/>
would challenge my thinking and it just seemed to me that she let her <br/>
kids do whatever they wanted and their household was just chaotic and <br/>
their kids hooligans; until I saw it at work and started being more <br/>

that we do before bed and I&#39;d be lowering lights and turning down the  <br/>
sound level, and maybe offering warm milk or a back rub or to read  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663997087">&quot;Even as adults we have to do things we don&#39;t always feel like<br/>
doing at the time (laundry, making dinner, going to work, etc).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
These are ALL choices. Sometimes we make a choice to do something we<br/>
don&#39;t care for a whole lot, because the consequence is worse than our<br/>
distaste for the activity, but it&#39;s ALL a choice.<br/>
<br/>
In my talk at the conference, I talked about these choices. There are<br/>
loads of options before we decide to do an activity...you can hire<br/>
someone, you can ignore the activity, you can ask for volunteers etc...<br/>
But once YOU decide an activity is worth doing, then you are down to<br/>
just TWO choices;<br/>
to do the activity poorly (with a bad attitude, with grumbling or an<br/>
unthankful heart) OR to do it well (with joy or at least with gratitude).<br/>
I don&#39;t always remember this, but I try.<br/>
<br/>
I think every single moment, of every single day, we can realize how<br/>
extremely fortunate we are to have the &quot;work&quot; we have. The dishes I do<br/>
are symbols of healthy people that I love, able to eat food and share<br/>
time together. The laundry I do is a symbol of happy, exploring<br/>
children, getting messy as they learn. The bills I pay are signs that<br/>
I have money, a house, nice clothing, a vehicle that takes us to<br/>
pursue friendships, adventures and exploration of the world.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on.<br/>
<br/>
If we see our lives as choices, it frees us up to make better choices,<br/>
rather than feeling &quot;stuck&quot; or like we &quot;have to&quot; do certain activities.<br/>
ALL of my life is a choice. I DO choose some distasteful things<br/>
because I don&#39;t like the consequences...but it&#39;s still a choice.<br/>

**********************************************<br/>
Rebecca, I&#39;ve been reading your posts and watching your struggle, and my  <br/>
suggestion, for now, is not to worry about it. You&#39;ll find that lots of people  <br/>
go through this process. My experience is that most people who embrace the  <br/>
learning parts of unschooling eventually find that it moves into other parts of  <br/>
their and their children&#39;s lives.  You seem to get the learning part pretty  <br/>
well, and my guess is that you WILL end up embracing other parts. Or maybe  not.<br/>
 <br/>
We grow up being told that education is the job of professionals, and that  <br/>
good parents are lovingly strict with their children. So, we&#39;re here saying <br/>
that  not only can kids learn at home, but that we don&#39;t even have at sit down at <br/>
the  kitchen table and teach them and test them. THEN we go on to say that we <br/>
can let  kids make decisions about bedtime and chores and other <br/>
stuff....argh! How scary  is that!?<br/>
 <br/>
Keep hanging out here, keep reading, maybe come to a conference and meet  <br/>
some of these weird people in person. See what happens. <br/>

I was watching _Alexander_ the other night. Duncan (9) came down and snuggled with me as I watched. I <br/>
probably would have turned it off any other night, but I really wanted to watch it and I&#39;ve been stressed <br/>
a bit lately and didn&#39;t want to change my plans. He asked what it was about, and I explained who Alexander <br/>
was and what he accomplished. I told him it would be bloody, for SURE, and maybe he wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>
watch (he has his own tv in his room). He stayed.<br/>
 <br/>
There were some very gory battle scenes and two rape scenes. He looked down or hid his head in my lap <br/>
if it got too ugly for him, and he wondered aloud why I would *want* to watch that! &lt;G&gt; I fast-forwarded a <br/>
few things! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I probably *could* have put my viewing off, but he was fine and didn&#39;t watch anything *he* found <br/>
disturbing.<br/>
 <br/>
Young children---even very young children---don&#39;t WANT to watch sex and violence (and this is a kid who<br/>
LOVES gory video games!). They will chose cartoons and animal planet and discovery channel over Freddie <br/>
Krueger (and _Alexander_ &lt;g&gt;) any day!<br/>
 <br/>
My older son, of course went to see _Saw 2_ (ugh!) on Halloween. He said it was actually *very* good and<br/>
was trying to convince me that the message was a very positive one! &lt;bwg&gt; But he was never made to watch <br/>
anything he wasn&#39;t comfortable with nor was he prevented from watching he thought he as ready for. <br/>
 <br/>
But _SAW_???? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Not if that were the only thing they were interested in....I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
find it natural for an extended period (not just days or weeks) of time <br/>
for a child not be interested in participating in the world, exploring, <br/>
working, playing, reading, etc.<br/>

Odd. Duncan has done ALL of those things *while* watching tv. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t believe that &quot;Saw 2&quot; beat out &quot;Zorro&quot;!  Our<br/>
whole family absolutely loved the &quot;Mask of Zorro&quot; and<br/>
we really want to see the sequel.  However, it will<br/>
have to wait until DVD because they&#39;d rather see<br/>
&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; :-) <br/>
<br/>
Hubby convinced me to watch the first SAW...yuk. <br/>
LOL... I like scary movies, some that I would never<br/>
watch again in my life but I&#39;m not a big gore fan. ;-)<br/>

Happy Learning,<br/>

I have NEVER in my life used algebra so all the years that I <br/>
was forced to do algebra was wasted time that I could have used for <br/>
much more interesting things that would have been more meaningful for <br/>
MY life.  <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
No, Heidi, NOOOOO!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
What you&#39;re NOT getting is that YOU have used algebra and you DOOO use algebra! Probably EVERY DAY!!!<br/>
 <br/>
School sucks!<br/>
 <br/>
When you are driving and decide when to use your brakes to avoid hitting the car in front, you are using algebra! You are considering the variables (condition of the road, the brakes, distance between cars, concentration level, laws) every time you step on that brake to avoid hitting a car!<br/>
 <br/>
When you are running errands and need to figure out how soon you need to leave the house in order to get it all done, THAT&#39;s algebra! If you spend too much time at the library, you may need to alter your plans a bit and go to the post office tomorrow in order to meet your sister for supper by 7:00 (considering if you want to be on time).<br/>
 <br/>
In cooking, if you change the ingredients, you may need to change the cooking time. <br/>
 <br/>
Painting---mixing colors is all about varying the amount you use to get the end result you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
 <br/>
Handicapping races or golf: Algebra!<br/>
 <br/>
Algebra (if I&#39;m not mistaken, Pam---please clarify!) is the use of variables. Those of us who multi-task are really GOOD at algebra!<br/>
 <br/>
We DO use it every day! We just don&#39;t necessarily need to know the formulae in order to do the work!<br/>
