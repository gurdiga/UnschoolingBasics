<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808959897">The following is a partial response to a mom who is interested in coming to  <br/>
the conference. Her husband is reluctant----in more ways than one. Ben wrote <br/>
to  encourage her to bring the whole family. I thought some of you might be  <br/>
interested in reading a dad&#39;s viewpoint. I&#39;ve deleted her questions and some  <br/>
specifics, but I think you&#39;ll get the gist.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m lucky.<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly<br/>
 <br/>
*************************<br/>
 <br/>
At least 10 dads (not to mention countless moms and kids) have had  <br/>
life-changing experiences at the past two conferences.  I can&#39;t pinpoint a  specific <br/>
event which made those things happen, so I must attribute it to the  entire <br/>
conference.  The presenters ... the funshops ... the dads&#39;  get-together ... <br/>
children experiencing some of their own ... the talent show ...  everything that <br/>
the conference offers (and leaves out) is important.   Complete submersion into <br/>
the entire conference will help more than just picking  and choosing certain <br/>
things to see and hear.  You can&#39;t submerge or pick  and choose if one of you <br/>
is not there.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that you mean my talk with the fathers  when you say &#39;your <br/>
talk&quot;; I actually am presenting in the main tent on &quot;Rules vs  Principles&quot;, also.  <br/>
For the sake of this e-mail, I&#39;ll go with my  assumption.  My get-together <br/>
with the fathers will give him some insight  into unschooling and ways that <br/>
others experience it in and outside of their  homes.  Unschooling is not the <br/>
product of an equation; there is no one  definition or way to do it.  It is the math <br/>
equivalent of  infinity because it is continuous and evolving and maleable <br/>
and has no defined  stopping point.  It must be lived and experienced correctly, <br/>
and it extends  the journey of learning.  As far as &#39;graduation&#39; and college <br/>
are concerned,  there should be people there with whom he can speak about <br/>
those subjects (in  fact, one of the speakers, Valerie Fitzenrieter, will be <br/>
talking about  her daughter, Laurie, who just began working on her  <br/>
doctorate---unschooled until college).  As far as successful goes, you&#39;re  treading on thin <br/>
ice with me.  My DW never graduated from college, and  she&#39;s been successful <br/>
from society&#39;s and unschooling&#39;s standpoint.   Maybe you both need to define the <br/>
meaning of being &quot;successful&quot;.  Bill  Gates would take exception to needing a <br/>
college degree to be &quot;successful&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your can&#39;t support or understand what he hasn&#39;t  experienced or read about.  <br/>
Having him there at the very least means  exposure; besides, he&#39;s agreed to <br/>
come already.  But if you think he&#39;ll  make it miserable for your son, you need <br/>
to ask whether or not you will continue  to unschool if your husband is not <br/>
supportive.  My get-together with  the fathers is crucial to his being in a <br/>
&#39;safe&#39; environment to discuss issues  specific to the dads.  Everything else at <br/>
the conference is just as  important because he&#39;ll see how fathers are <br/>
interacting with their children  every minute of every hour of every day of the <br/>
conference.  Not knocking  you moms, but that is a thing of beauty for me.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is more of a separate subject than the conference itself, but two  <br/>
things here: 1) what &#39;you&#39; want vs what he wants and 2) teaching vs  learning.  <br/>
What he wants is what your focus is in unschooling.  One of  the basic themes <br/>
throughout your note is how much you want this to work, and  that&#39;s good ... you <br/>
have to have the passion to do it.  But in the end,  it&#39;s got to be what he <br/>
wants.  I don&#39;t deny that being home in an  unschooling environment would be the <br/>
best thing for him, but he&#39;s gotta be the  one to make that choice.  His <br/>
choice will be to stay home if he realizes  that you will help him learn <br/>
absolutely anything that he&#39;s interested in.   If that means watching TV, playing video <br/>
games, playing cards, or coloring in a  coloring book all day for the next <br/>
two months, let him do it.  He&#39;ll be  &#39;deschooling&#39;, gaining confidence in <br/>
himself (and you), become more responsible  for his own learning, and experience <br/>
the value of self-led learning.  Your  responsibility is not to teach, but to <br/>
find ways to turn your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; into  &quot;yes&#39;s&quot;.  In his time, his responsibility <br/>
will be to make choices based  upon his passions and interests and not upon what <br/>
some faceless administration,  government official, or other self-appointed <br/>
expert thinks he should be  doing.  He will empower himself.<br/>
 <br/>

There&#39;s more----but I just thought I&#39;d share a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241567828">Thank you, Kelly, for sharing this.  I, even more now, want my <br/>
husband to attend the conference.  Right now he still doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to go.  I think if I pushed he would, though.  I have told him it <br/>
would mean a lot to me if he would be there with me, but he is <br/>
working on Friday and he might work Saturday morning, then he wants <br/>
time to relax before Monday and it all starts over again.  So, I see <br/>
his reason for not wanting to go, but I also know this is a once in <br/>
a lifetime opportunity for me to help him understand where I am in <br/>
my thinking.  (Next year is a whole nother year away!, plus he hates <br/>
Florida.)<br/>
<br/>
He mostly understands the academic parts of unschooling.  The things <br/>
I think he needs to understand is why I don&#39;t make the kids do a lot <br/>
of housework, like, when Erica is drawing and her drawing stuff is <br/>
all out around her along with a dirty dish or two and a drink, and <br/>
her laundry needs to be done, etc.  In his culture, girls my <br/>
daughter&#39;s age would be running the household--cooking and cleaning, <br/>
not drawing.  What makes it worse is our neighbor is like he is, the <br/>
women and girls spend their day taking care of the kids and the <br/>
house while the men work and fix cars.  I&#39;m hoping he might listen <br/>
to someone who is not me (ie, another man).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have going for me is that he is not my kids&#39; father.  I <br/>
do not have to wait to unschool until he &quot;gets it&quot;.  I wish we were <br/>
both on the same page, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Crystal, crossing her fingers that dh comes to the conference.</div>

<br/>
Last year at this time, I was feeling very out of sorts.  I knew that <br/>
homeschooling was right for us that I just couldn&#39;t go through another year doing <br/>
things the way we had always done them with a co-op and some sort of textbook <br/>
approach.   I thought I knew what unschooling was and had read some John Holt and <br/>
knew who Sandra Dodd was.  I came upon the Live and Learn Conference <br/>
information and it was only a 6 hour drive from our house!!  My husband does love to <br/>
go places new so I asked him if we could just drive up to Columbia for the <br/>
weekend...see the sights...go to the conference..:-) I know he wasn&#39;t thrilled <br/>
about the conference part but I think he did it just because it might help lift <br/>
my spirits a bit and he wanted to see some of North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
So we did.  We didn&#39;t know anyone or anything about it really but we wandered <br/>
around a little and people talked to us!!!  Kelly came up and welcomed us!!  <br/>
The kids were all having a wonderful time and I had never seen so much <br/>
giggling and fun going on in elevators!<br/>
My 13 year old daughter (who had brought her textbooks from her co-op with <br/>
us) was smiling and went right up to the front row at the talent show to listen. <br/>
My 10 year old son was in heaven with all the Yu-Gi-Oh cards floating around. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And the dads.  They were truly present and with their children.  One of them <br/>
sang the Sponge Bob song at the talent show.  Others were in the funshops <br/>
having every bit as much fun as their kids.  My husband didn&#39;t go to the Dad&#39;s get <br/>
together because we sort of just stumbled in not knowing anything about the <br/>
conference.  However, on the drive home we talked and laughed and I knew it had <br/>
been one of those &quot;life-changing&quot; moments.<br/>
<br/>
And it was. We came home and never looked back.  We deschooled and I read and <br/>
when I had doubts when our son sat in front of the TV for weeks on end he <br/>
reassured me.  He told me just last week that he is so proud of me for making all <br/>
the huge changes that I made this past year and knows it is the right path <br/>
for the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s right.  Its the right path for us all.  He made sure we had the hotel <br/>
reservations months ago and has printed out MapQuest for the drive.  This year, <br/>
I think its a 20 hour drive.  He is so excited and definitely plans on being <br/>
at the Dad&#39;s gathering.<br/>
<br/>
So I think a little pushing would be worth it.  It worked for us.  If you can <br/>
just get him there, the conference speaks for itself.  It is awesome!!!<br/>
