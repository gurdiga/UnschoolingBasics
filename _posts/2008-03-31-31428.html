<div id="ygrps-yiv-370072839">Have you ever been to a Scholastic Book Fair Warehouse Sale? Picture a huge  <br/>
room with tons of Scholastic books (which are usually drastically discounted  <br/>
anyway) at even greater discounts. Also toys, supplies, all kinds of things--  <br/>
really cheap and abundant.  <br/>
 <br/>
Well, this year they are offering one of their Warehouse Sales in Peabody,  <br/>
MA, the Thursday and Friday before the conference starts, EIGHT MINUTES  FROM <br/>
THE CONFERENCE HOTEL!!!!!!!!  The details are:<br/>
 <br/>
Spring Hill Suites/Boston/Peabody<br/>
43 Newbury  Street<br/>
Peabody, MA 01960<br/>
Thu., 05/22/2008 - Fri.,  05/23/2008<br/>
Thursday 12:00PM-8:00PM<br/>
Friday 10:00AM-6:00PM <br/>
