<div id="ygrps-yiv-119367304">Hello Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry there&#39;s no database of unschoolers---that&#39;s just not  <br/>
&gt; going to<br/>
&gt; happen! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s a shame for us. It fits to the general thinking of  <br/>
unschoolers. But for us in coutries where it is illegal it would help  <br/>
a LOT if there where such a database. Do you think if we started some  <br/>
kind of website where you can register anonymously as an unschooler,  <br/>
people would?<br/>
<br/>
See, we need every evidence! Nobody&#39;s gonna believe us. You wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
BELIEVE what hast just happened here!<br/>
<br/>
Vernor Muñoz, the Special Correspondent of the UN wrote a report for  <br/>
the Right to obtain education. He wrote about how it was bad that in  <br/>
Germany the circumstances are such, that people are threatend to be  <br/>
deprived of their right of custody when they tried to homeschool or  <br/>
other kinds of non-school education. He expressed that although he  <br/>
himself is pro compulsory education, homeschooling was a valid form  <br/>
of education.<br/>
<br/>
He writes:<br/>
“According to reports received, it is possible that, in some Länder  <br/>
&lt;=states in Germany&gt;, education is understood exclusively to mean  <br/>
school attendance. Even though the Special Rapporteur is a strong  <br/>
advocate of public, free and compulsory education, it should be noted  <br/>
that education may not be reduced to mere school attendance and that  <br/>
educational processes should be strengthened to ensure that they  <br/>
always and primarily serve the best interests of the child. Distance  <br/>
learning methods and home schooling represent valid options which  <br/>
could be developed in certain circumstances, bearing in mind that  <br/>
parents have the right to choose the appropriate type of education  <br/>
for their children, as stipulated in article 13 of the International  <br/>
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The promotion and  <br/>
development of a system of public, government-funded education should  <br/>
not entail the suppression of forms of education that do not require  <br/>
attendance at a school. In this context, the Special Rapporteur  <br/>
received complaints about threats to withdraw the parental rights of  <br/>
parents who chose home-schooling methods for their children.”<br/>
<br/>
In the translation to German though, they added: &quot;Distance learning  <br/>
methods and home schooling represent valid options which could be  <br/>
developed in certain circumstances, WHICH HAVE TO BE EXCEPTIONAL,   <br/>
bearing in mind that parent...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s incredible!! this has been done because the law here already  <br/>
states that &quot;in certain circumstances&quot; you could homeschool. But they  <br/>
just interpret that law as &quot;those circumstances have to be very  <br/>
exceptional&quot;. So now they don&#39;t want to change anything and do as if  <br/>
Muñoz said the same thing they&#39;ve been practising for decades.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, do you think unschoolers from the US would help us set up a  <br/>
database, if we try to set up a campaign, writing to all lists and  <br/>
asking people to help us? It would be nice to be able to tell: &quot;In  <br/>
the US there are alredy X unschoolers&quot;...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391449180">I would!  And it wouldn&#39;t need to be anonymous, maybe just if the<br/>
family desired it - I think there would be more validity with names,<br/>
locations, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821085660">Johanna, I sent this to your other email address, and then saw this <br/>
one. Figured I&#39;d try both! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THis is an old report, but it could be helpful, espcially how they note <br/>
the extreme *growth* of homeshcooling each year in the US. It seems to <br/>
almost double! ANd that was ten years ago!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
