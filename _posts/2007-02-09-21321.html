<div id="ygrps-yiv-45642544">The current dog thread has motivated me to post about my recent dog-related thoughts.<br/>
   <br/>
  Before my DS was born in &#39;06, my life had been ALL dogs ALL the time for about 10 years.  Search and rescue, agility, film work -- behavior modification, clicker training, positive reinforcement -- pack theory, dominance issues -- these were the primary focus of my thoughts, reading, training, etc. for years.<br/>
   <br/>
  Then along came Jake and I started questioning behaviorism. Cry-it-out is simply extinguishing an &quot;unwanted behavior&quot; right?  WRONG!!!  By the time he was just six months old I realized how my dog training experience had actually polluted my ability to parent in an unconditional way.  Thankfully I ran into Alfie Kohn&#39;s work last summer and I FINALLY found the answers regarding why behaviorism -- punishment or rewards -- doesn&#39;t work well for humans.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And now I&#39;m left wondering if it really works that well for my dogs.  Sure, they&#39;re well trained.  They know 70+ behaivors on command and can work in crazy environments.  And they&#39;ve always seemed to genuinely enjoy the training and the work.  But are they happy?  Fulfilled?  Who would THEY liked to have been?  (Of course I&#39;ll never know those answers &#39;cause I can&#39;t discuss it with them.  But I now wonder... :)<br/>
   <br/>
  Back to parenting though...  The most pressing question on my mind at the moment is: how do my behavior-modification-based interactions with my dogs influence Jake about how to interact with other living creatures?<br/>
   <br/>
  In other words... what kind of example am I setting!?!?  <br/>
   <br/>
  If I want to model an unschooling, empathic style of living, I believe that needs to include how I live and interact with our dogs.  If I coerce my dogs to be &quot;obedient&quot; through reward and/or punishment, how will Jake know that such coercion is only reserved for non-humans.  And now I&#39;m questioning if it should even be used on them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I understand that when raising a canine in a human environment, &quot;guidance&quot; is essential to help them live in harmony with us.  Their natural instincts to chew, dig, kill, etc., don&#39;t mesh well with modern human lives.  I&#39;ve come a LONG way from my early years of mostly using punishment, or threat of punishment, physical dominance and bullying (aka &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot; -- YUCK!!!) and for years now have almost exclusively used positive reinforcement and reward-based methods.  But now I recognize that even these gentler methods are still just external control mechanisms.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Now that I see how wonderful empathic parenting is in my life with Jake, and with my DH, I&#39;m aching to find a more empathic and organic way to live with my dogs.  But I&#39;m truly not sure how to do that, and have dogs that are enjoyable to live with.<br/>
   <br/>
  So, are there any recovering behaviorists out there who have thought these issues through and can provide some insight?<br/>
   <br/>
  How do you dedicated unschoolers live with your dogs?  Have you found a way to live an unschooly life with your dogs?  Or do you use &quot;traditional discipline&quot; with them?  If so, how do you justify -- to yourself and your children -- the difference between how you treat humans vs. nonhumans?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for any thoughts you all can share.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sincerely,<br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
   So, are there any recovering behaviorists out there who have thought <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Recovering behaviorist. &lt;bwg&gt; I&#39;ll have to remember to use that <br/>
sometime. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of my life, too, as been spent in the serious company of dogs. I <br/>
started training (Koehler & Strickland---jerk-praise---methods) in 1970 <br/>
when I was ten. I trained my mutt to UDTX level by 1973, but she could <br/>
never complete in trials back then, so she was untitled. Things have <br/>
changed so much. It&#39;s so nice to see folks making an effort to see <br/>
beyond that. It&#39;s nice to see dogs who are *eager* to work compared to <br/>
the dogs in competition in the 70s. I tend to take long breaks from <br/>
dogs and then come back to be amazed at the progress made in training <br/>
over time.<br/>
<br/>
There were the food incentives popular in the 80s. And whatever (balls <br/>
, toys, playtime) incentives of the 90s. Now, from what i&#39;ve observed, <br/>
it&#39;s more about seeing things from the dog&#39;s PoV and working from where <br/>
the dog is---learning his language---instead of teaching him ours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been &quot;in&quot; dogs, off & on for over 35 years. Breeding, showing, <br/>
obedience, agility, pointer field trials, tracking, handling, judging, <br/>
writing, and now mostly just grooming (specializing in handstripping <br/>
terriers).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m raising my second guide dog pup. That&#39;s an amazing bit of training. <br/>
The DOG&#39;s in charge! &lt;bwg&gt; Not in my house, of course. &lt;g&gt; But that&#39;s <br/>
the goal---ain&#39;t *that* some shit! *Trusting* and *respecting* that dog <br/>
and his decisions more than your own self?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   How do you dedicated unschoolers live with your dogs?  Have you found <br/>
a way to<br/>
live an unschooly life with your dogs?  Or do you use &quot;traditional <br/>
discipline&quot;<br/>
with them?  If so, how do you justify -- to yourself and your children <br/>
-- the<br/>
difference between how you treat humans vs. nonhumans?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not either - or. It&#39;s living together and takes both and neither <br/>
and all.<br/>
<br/>
I treat the dogs as dogs. They are NOT my children. They DO understand <br/>
pack order and dominance---very, very clearly. ANd if it&#39;s not clear, <br/>
they&#39;re happy to clarify *for* you! &lt;G&gt; (Why so many dogs end up in <br/>
rescue. *They&#39;ve* had to determine pack order.)<br/>
<br/>
I think after the pack order is established, everything else falls into <br/>
place here. I *do* use behavior modification. It works. BUT I also try <br/>
to work *with* the dog, rather than against him. I try to figure out <br/>
why he thinks the way he does and come at things from his PoV. It&#39;s <br/>
harder at first, but the pay-offs (like unschooling) are bigger and <br/>
better. Plus, it gets easier in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working with a friend who gived classes here in town, We&#39;ve known <br/>
each other since we were kids and training. She&#39;s very into <br/>
non-punitive training (for the most part). Mostly she&#39;s showing folks <br/>
how to &quot;understand&quot; &quot;dog-speak&quot;---it&#39;s wierd. Hard to go into in one <br/>
post. &lt;g&gt; But we work with the *dog&#39;s* language and his physiology to <br/>
communicate. We make sure he---and WE  *understand*--a lot different <br/>
from strict obedience!<br/>
<br/>
Working with guide dogs, I&#39;ve learned a lot about &quot;reasoning&quot;---and I <br/>
think many dogs do it really, really well. Especially of they are <br/>
exposed to many different situations. Back yard/couch potato dogs have <br/>
no reason to reason. &lt;g&gt; But working dogs are processing things every <br/>
minute. They&#39;re different. Not necessarily in ability---just in <br/>
exposure and out of necessity.<br/>
<br/>
As for my pets: the goal is harmony. And I think most of that is <br/>
accomplished with pack order first, then working *together*. I could <br/>
*force* correct heel position; but when a dog is attached for hours on <br/>
end, it&#39;s more of a *dance* than control or obedience: we work <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having issues right now with the smooth collie we&#39;ve taken over <br/>
raising as a guide dog (14 months old and with another family before <br/>
us). She doesn&#39;t come when called. She gets a cookie EVERY time she <br/>
comes inside. Why? Because it works AND because she needs to understand <br/>
that *I* am not the bad guy. As soon as she trusts me, we can wean <br/>
away. But right now, we need the reward. AFter she trusts me, I&#39;ll <br/>
start trying to use &quot;come&quot; again.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I&#39;m known for saying, &quot;You&#39;re a DAWG&quot; which is <br/>
shorthand for:  &quot;stop whatever you&#39;re doing---it&#39;s not proper behavior <br/>
for a dog. People come first.&quot; &lt;G&gt; That&#39;ll get the dog off the <br/>
furniture or out of the front seat or whatever quickly because he <br/>
really doesn&#39;t have the same rights. &lt;G&gt;  Overall though, our life with <br/>
dogs is fairly unschooly---well, I&#39;d rather use &quot;harmonious.&quot; It&#39;s not <br/>
really unschooly, but it&#39;s listening to the dog and trying to <br/>
understand where&#39;s he is at the minute. It&#39;s using his language and his <br/>
abilities to communicate---so in that it&#39;s unschooly.&lt;g&gt; I&#39;m making no <br/>
sense. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for my boys: they know who&#39;s human and who&#39;s not. &lt;bwg&gt; It&#39;s not a <br/>
stretch! &lt;G&gt; We communicate differently. We&#39;re different species. But <br/>
working WITH the dog certainly makes things easier all the way around.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--and we&#39;re tihnking about Search and Rescue later when the boys are <br/>
gone. I LOVE working dogs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624265518">Have you read Elizabeth Marshall Thomas&#39; The Hidden Life of Dogs?  (I don&#39;t see how you could have been into dogs for that long without having having read it, but thought I&#39;d ask.)  The theme of her book is this question of what makes a fulfilled dog -- left to their own devices, what would dogs choose to do:-)  It&#39;s a great book for any dog-lovers out there.<br/>
