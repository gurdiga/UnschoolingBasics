<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927162491">Again, rummaging through papers, I found this scrap (I used to print <br/>
them out and pin or tape them to mirrors or desks or walls), from &quot;Blue <br/>
Skies!&quot; Robin:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Adult-like behavior matures by the time we are adults.<br/>
<br/>
2) No expectations means no disappointments for us and no damaging <br/>
pressure for our children.<br/>
<br/>
3) Children respond best to modeling and leadership, not control<br/>
<br/>
4) Trust...and wait.<br/>
<br/>
5) Choose between the momentary convenience and your long-term goal for <br/>
your child&#39;s sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
6) Enjoy your child for who he is, not for whom you would like him to <br/>
be---he will never be this age again.<br/>
<br/>
7) Distinguish between your emotional needs and what your child feels <br/>
and needs. Act toward your child in harmony with her needs: take care <br/>
of your emotional needs elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
8) Celebrate your child&#39;s uniqueness as well as your own.<br/>
<br/>
