<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864007349">A few days ago, I looked out to see my 6yr old dd playing in a puddle <br/>
in our drive-way.  I chuckled to myself, because this activity would <br/>
have not been allowed to me growing up.  I think we probably all <br/>
heard our parents tell us to get out of or stay out of the puddles.  <br/>
Okay, I know in the past it wasn&#39;t safe to play in a puddle in the <br/>
city due to sanitation issues and disease-and even today it could be <br/>
questionable-even on a farm in the country where animals free range <br/>
there is a question of disease.  But here on our little farm in the <br/>
middle of the woods, my kids can play in the puddles and learn.  :)<br/>
My 2 yr olds dd saw her sister outside playing in the puddles and of <br/>
course wanted outside to play too.  So, I put on her sweater (no <br/>
shoes) and sent her out the door.  Off she was to go play in the <br/>
puddles along side her sister.  They played and played -or should I <br/>
say, they learned and learned,  ;)  until it was just too cold to <br/>
play anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
As I sat watching this, I got to thinking about how great it is to <br/>
let my children learn so freely.  This kind of learning they couldn&#39;t <br/>
get in any classroom setting.  It is so innocent, this <br/>
play/learning.  <br/>
<br/>
It also made me think about my own raising.  How when I was growing <br/>
up &quot;playing in puddles&quot; wouldn&#39;t have been allowed, but how now the <br/>
same parents-now turned grandparents, would allow their grandkids to <br/>
play in puddles.  Why the difference?  Well, honestly, our parents <br/>
were acting as they were taught to act.  It was automatic to them, <br/>
just as it can be with us if we aren&#39;t on guard.  The difference <br/>
comes from age and wisdom actually.  It comes from a place where they <br/>
are looking with hindsight and have come to see that what they once <br/>
thought was a bad thing, really isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
My younger kids have a benefit of being born later in our lives.  <br/>
They get the benefit of having parents that have that hindsight <br/>
already and know how important it is not to stifle a child&#39;s freedom <br/>
to learn hands on.  Even if it does mean getting soaking wet and <br/>
muddy playing in a puddle.  :)<br/>

I spent part of my childhood in Hong Kong during the mid-sixties. It may be<br/>
different now. Then it seemed to be one of the filthiest cities on earth,<br/>
and full of poverty. We had to boil all water before drinking, there was<br/>
garbage in the streets, wild smells, people expectorated constantly, there<br/>
were lots of stray dogs and we were always finding newborn kittens in the<br/>
streets that had ringworm. People really did hang their laundry out on<br/>
bamboo poles over the streets, which would then drip. Children were warned<br/>
not to pick up anything they saw in the street even if it looked like a toy<br/>
- because it was possible that it was a bomb, or so we were told. <br/>
<br/>
It never occurs to me that anywhere else that I lived since is remotely<br/>
dirty by comparison - not Sydney, Brisbane, Tahiti, even Los Angeles. Jayn<br/>
and I do lots of puddle jumping.<br/>

through there from time to time.  No bombs anymore as far as I know though.<br/>
