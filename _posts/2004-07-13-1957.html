<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066131673">Thanks for the responses to me freaking out about a 3rd child! I&#39;m <br/>
feeling calmer now.<br/>
<br/>
Caroline is so easy going that it will take effort not to neglect <br/>
her. I won&#39;t let that happen. Dh was the neglected youngest of 5 kids <br/>
and she&#39;s so much like him, so I think we&#39;ll do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022444026">&quot;So,gayle, by posting and really giving where you were , you gave me<br/>
the words to<br/>
where I was, and all the rest of you who responded to her, you helped<br/>
me , too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s one of the great things about online conversations...it<br/>
happens quite often I think, that many people benefit from a<br/>
conversation that starts out about one person.<br/>
I know I&#39;ve had lots of &quot;aha&quot; moments from conversations I didn&#39;t even<br/>
get involved in.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m glad there were some useful bits there for you.  Maybe we could<br/>
start a &quot;controllers anonymous&quot; 12 step program!! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517603241">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking about this list and was overwhelmed by a feeling  <br/>
which I wanted to share: I want to say thank you to all of you who  <br/>
have experience in this and who don&#39;t really need to be in this list  <br/>
(anymore), yet you do to help us newcomers.<br/>
<br/>
I find it so hard to change my parenting &quot;style&quot; and I really need  <br/>
this list and other sources for help. It feels like &quot;the world upside  <br/>
down&quot;. Everything is quite the opposite of what I was used to and I  <br/>
have a million questions. I hesitate to ask because I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
bother you all, you surely answered all these questions already a  <br/>
million times. I know this list is for asking but still :-) I can&#39;t  <br/>
help it. I will eventually though.<br/>
<br/>
But this post ist just a thank you post.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687343204">&quot;But this post ist just a thank you post.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s appreciated more than you know.<br/>
Most of us are more than willing to answer questions over and over and<br/>
over gain (I&#39;m constantly in AWE at Joyces posts that are immensely<br/>
detailed year after year) but it&#39;s always nice to have a little<br/>
appreciation. I can admit that I&#39;m not totally selfless about this<br/>
whole thing!!;)<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t be afraid to ask your questions, that&#39;s what the list is<br/>
for. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618751826">I am learning or should I say unlearning so much from all of you and your replies. I am looking at homeschooling with much less stress than before. Here I thought I was a failure because I wasn&#39;t forcing bookwork but encouraging Internet searches on topics that come up like the volcano, it brought about discussion this morning so we looked it up. We are becoming more eager to learn and happier all around.<br/>
