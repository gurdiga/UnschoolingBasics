<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736047349">Hi all,<br/>
I have been lurking here for a few months now.  We have been <br/>
homeschooling for three years, starting as what one might call, <br/>
relaxed homeschoolers, and quickly discovering that unschooling made <br/>
everyone happier (before we really even came to the <br/>
term &#39;unschooling&#39;).  Once we discovered the term for it, we came to <br/>
more information on radical unschooling and are currently devouring <br/>
everything we can read on the topic and making gradual yet important <br/>
changes each day!  We hope to attend the NEU conference too.<br/>
<br/>
That said, as far as &#39;school&#39; we are great at unschooling and <br/>
strewing, we also have easily relaxed our limits on bedtimes, tv, <br/>
food and chores and are seeing the positive results. We have an 8 <br/>
month old ds, 6 and 8 year old dd, and a 14 year old (my step son, <br/>
although we have custody, his mom will not allow us to homeschool <br/>
him...on a side note, he received a detention the other day for <br/>
being &quot;non productive in studyhall&quot; - he was reading a skateboarding <br/>
magazine, aarrgghh - but that is another topic for another place!)<br/>
Our challenge is really more the smaller, yet important, daily <br/>
frustrations: sibling squabbles, meltdowns, and more importantly - <br/>
my frustration point being lower than I would like.<br/>
<br/>
Long post, so sorry, but I am getting to my question - really!  I am <br/>
finding it useful to have some internal dialogue to help me to think <br/>
before I speak and to choose my words and actions <br/>
carefully.  &#39;Breathe&#39;, &#39;How can I help?&#39;, &#39;What if this were the <br/>
last day with my beautiful babies?&#39;...these are helping me.  I am <br/>
working on putting reminders all over (I am very visual) and would <br/>
love to hear other things you have said to yourself while in the <br/>
heat of the moment, as well as any daily mantras, to help remind me <br/>
to stop and think and make better choices. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
Bonnie</div>

&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t be mean!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not the unschooling, it&#39;s the _________!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s only four (or nine or twelve or 16)!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How important IS this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;STOP!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What if he were dead?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What if I died in an hour? Is THIS how I&#39;d want to be remembered?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and finally: &quot;WWJD?&quot;---&quot;What would Joyce do?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016210072">I like to remember my favorite quote.. &quot;Always changing, everything<br/>
for good.. nothing for nothing.&quot; by Flying Hawk a Sioux. <br/>
<br/>
 The &quot;nothing,&quot; in the quote reminds me of &quot;the nothing&quot; in the<br/>
Neverending Story.. :D <br/>

Oh---another two for me:<br/>

&quot;This too shall pass. Better carve it on your forehead or tattoo it on your ass.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&quot;Enjoy it while you&#39;ve got it: you&#39;re going to miss it when it&#39;s gone!&quot;<br/>
