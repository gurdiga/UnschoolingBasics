<div id="ygrps-yiv-510891103">Something I do for public talks, is a quiz. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t find a<br/>
copy of it in my conference notes, I&#39;ll post it verbatim if I have it<br/>
with me.<br/>
Basically, the quiz asks people to list their interests, hobbies, what<br/>
they do to earn money etc.... In the right hand column they make a<br/>
mark for each of those topics they learned to be capable at while in<br/>
school.<br/>
The average is 1-3 out of 13-25.<br/>
And once we hone in on what those learned in school are, they realize<br/>
it would have been an easy thing to learn outside of school. It<br/>
loosens people up and makes them realize how schooling hasn&#39;t<br/>
contributed much at ALL to their learning.<br/>

Thanks Ren, that sounds like a great tool (and nice to hear from you at <br/>
the conference...I&#39;m try to not be depressed!).  If you happen to have <br/>
it with you that would be great.   The info night isn&#39;t until next Thur <br/>
10/13.<br/>
