<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832406417">Well I couldn&#39;t sleep and was surfing the net, looking for inspiration<br/>
and discovered this group. I have been reading a bunch of recent and<br/>
older posts and liking the direction of the group discussions. I<br/>
haven&#39;t been able to find a group that mets my needs. I like the idea<br/>
of this being a group where you can come with concerns or issues and<br/>
have other more experienced folks talk you through this journey. I<br/>
feel so alone much of the time in our unschooling adventure. Kind of<br/>
lost and confused. I don&#39;t really know any other unschoolers irl. Our<br/>
family has been unschoolers in basic philosophy since birth (ap<br/>
parenting and then I never got into the &quot;schooly&quot; thing but not<br/>
necessarily radical) however I didn&#39;t discover there was a name for in<br/>
until my dd was older (6ish?) that was several years ago but still<br/>
have yet to met other unschoolers. I don&#39;t always feel confident in my<br/>
approach to life with my kids. I feel a lot of criticism from other<br/>
homeschoolers and question myself and our approach a lot lately. This<br/>
is our first year with other homeschoolers, in a co-op type thing.<br/>
Which I don&#39;t really like but my kids do and it is bringing up a lot<br/>
of confusion and issues for me. I don&#39;t really know how to articulate<br/>
things right now but I hope to try in the next few days.<br/>
I have a dd who is 10.5 and a ds who is 4.5 and this baby that&#39;s<br/>
*still* inside, coming any minute (wishful thinking) now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317456910">Hi Faith-<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been on this list too long but it has been SO helpful.<br/>
<br/>
We went to our first day of the fall session at our learning center <br/>
yesterday- (we have belonged and be very involved for 2 years)<br/>
The kids choose their activities and have really enjoyed the community. <br/>
I think it actually has served as a much better option than school for <br/>
my son who was strongly considering school before we joined. There are a <br/>
lot of really great things about it and it is totally up to my kids <br/>
whether they attend on any given day. They are both very social and it <br/>
really is a good thing (I have to keep repeating this to myself.).<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER- I have quite a bit of difficulty being there at times. It seems <br/>
that the families are moving even more towards Waldorf homeschooling and <br/>
school at home. Especially parents of young children, which is difficult <br/>
to observe. My daughter attended one class of a Waldorf program- and <br/>
says- I don&#39;t think I am a Waldorf kind of person. (Me either!)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had one mom tell me her son was unhappy with the assignments <br/>
she gave him this week- as he had been choosing his own up until now. <br/>
Her reason was that he had to be prepared for college in case the draft <br/>
was reinstated. I told her my theory of college preparation which is <br/>
that my kids, if and when they decide to go to college will be able to <br/>
start doing any preparation needed at that point in time whatever it <br/>
might be, if anything. Probably should have kept my mouth shut. It is <br/>
completely amazing the rationalizations people will come up with for <br/>
controlling their children. Another mom whose older son in now in high <br/>
school told us that her son does his school work more readily now than <br/>
when he was home schooled- this is someone who had claimed to be an <br/>
unschooler. I walked away from this one!<br/>
<br/>
I am involved in administration at the learning center so I think it <br/>
works to just stick with that subject and other neutral ones and stay <br/>
off homeschooling altogether. Of course I don&#39;t  always do this.<br/>
<br/>

PTSD. He will likely have his BS at a young age -- and if there is a draft, would he not then be draftable? <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  There is a lot of talk about a draft now.  I&#39;d be okay with that IF there were more options for non-military service, say for aid agencies and the like.  <br/>
   <br/>
  That said, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard about draft potential recently, thru my Mom who has a friend on the local Draft Board (which still exists even without a current draft)<br/>
   <br/>
  the current thought is that when a draft is instituted, this time around they&#39;ll choose older recruits -- starting with 22yo&#39;s and working down to younger people, so those in the 22yo age range are most likely to be drafted first (oh peachy - my oldest is 22!).<br/>
   <br/>
  the only deferment for college will be to allow draftees to finish the semester -- no more staying college til the draft/war ends.<br/>
   <br/>
  no marriage dependent deferments -- they won&#39;t care how many kids (or wives&lt;g&gt;) a draftee has.  After all, his wife is likely to work, too, so no big deal there.<br/>
   <br/>
  There will be CO (conscientious objector) status given still, but it&#39;s hard to get, and won&#39;t likely be given to men who chose not to register in the first place. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve spoken a bit with a cousin of my dh who offered to help me set up CO folders for our younger boys (apparently the draft board wants to see a record of one&#39;s pacifist leanings) but haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet.  Cousin is a Quaker and said their long history of CO status makes them a good resource for how to assemble a CO case for a draftee. <br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t worry so much about Andy -- we&#39;ve never had him diagnosed, tho we know he&#39;d land somewhere on the autism spectrum, but we&#39;d happily have him labeled if that would keep him out of a draft.  Dan, tho, is perfectly *normal* healthy, physically precocious -- an officer&#39;s dream!  And of course, Will is already draftable age -- but we have a back-up plan in place for him already.  <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  I don&#39;t know the details about that sort of thing, but I know I would fight heaven and hell to keep my only child safe!<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Ultimately, tho, dh&#39;s plan is that we&#39;d leave the country with our boys.  He&#39;s even explored how he could find work in Canada soon.  He grew up in the specter of Vietnam (had a draft card in &#39;73, but didn&#39;t get called up) and in those days wondered whether he&#39;d choose Mexico or Canada, because there was no way he was going to Vietnam.  And he grew up the child of a career Air Force officer!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492231645">From the Draft website at www.sss.gov/FSconsobj.htm -- this outlines <br/>
the Draft Board&#39;s definition of *conscientious objector*<br/>
<br/>
The local board will decide whether to grant or deny a CO <br/>
classification based on the evidence a registrant has presented. <br/>
<br/>
A man may appeal a Local Board&#39;s decision to a Selective Service <br/>
District Appeal Board. If the Appeal Board also denies his claim, but <br/>
the vote is not unanimous, he may further appeal the decision to the <br/>
National Appeal Board. See also Classifications.<br/>
<br/>
WHO QUALIFIES? <br/>
Beliefs which qualify a registrant for CO status may be religious in <br/>
nature, but don&#39;t have to be. Beliefs may be moral or ethical; <br/>
however, a man&#39;s reasons for not wanting to participate in a war must <br/>
not be based on politics, expediency, or self-interest. In general, <br/>
the man&#39;s lifestyle prior to making his claim must reflect his <br/>
current claims. <br/>
<br/>
SERVICE AS A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR <br/>
Two types of service are available to conscientious objectors, and <br/>
the type assigned is determined by the individual&#39;s specific beliefs. <br/>
The person who is opposed to any form of military service will be <br/>
assigned to Alternative Service - described below. The person whose <br/>
beliefs allow him to serve in the military but in a noncombatant <br/>
capacity will serve in the Armed Forces but will not be assigned <br/>
training or duties that include using weapons. <br/>
<br/>
ALTERNATIVE SERVICE <br/>
Conscientious Objectors opposed to serving in the military will be <br/>
placed in the Selective Service Alternative Service Program. This <br/>
program attempts to match COs with local employers. Many types of <br/>
jobs are available, however the job must be deemed to make a <br/>
meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, <br/>
safety, and interest. Examples of Alternative Service are jobs in: <br/>
<br/>
conservation <br/>
<br/>
caring for the very young or very old <br/>
<br/>
education <br/>
<br/>
health care <br/>
<br/>
Length of service in the program will equal the amount of time a man <br/>
would have served in the military, usually 24 months.</div>

The possibility of a draft being reinstated terrifies me.  I have a<br/>
nearly 16 yr old son who plans on starting college f/t next year.  He<br/>
has no desire to go into the military, and I suspect that it would be<br/>

PTSD.  He will likely have his BS at a young age -- and if there is a<br/>
draft, would he not then be draftable?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Scare tactics.<br/>
<br/>
First: the military doesn&#39;t WANT a draft. Draftees make AWFUL soldiers. <br/>
Not cohesive. Individualistic. Frightened. Self-serving. Downright <br/>
dangerous to the others in their units.<br/>
<br/>
The VietNam draft was time-specific. There&#39;s no way in hell they could <br/>
make it stick in this day and age.<br/>
<br/>
*I* would be the first to start the internet-based anti-draft movement. <br/>
I&#39;m not afraid of saving my children. Not one bit.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell you to send my proposal to every friend you have.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no way the government could make it work! There would be too <br/>
much backfire.<br/>
<br/>
They could *possibly* get in touch with every able-bodied <br/>
soldier-to-be, but they could NOT make all of them show up for the <br/>
physical. If they didn&#39;t show up for the physical, they could*possibly* <br/>
arrest them all. But where would they put them? In the prisons after <br/>
letting out all the potsmokers? Then if they did take all the arrested <br/>
objectors off to train, how would they get them to participate? <br/>
Threatening them? Then how could they get them to march? With bayonets <br/>
at their butts?<br/>
<br/>
If the objectors actually OBJECTED and simply SAT DOWN, there would be <br/>
nothing the government could do. They could even send them to war, but <br/>
a soldier who won&#39;t fight is not only worthless, but dangerous to <br/>
everyone with him.<br/>
<br/>
No way a draft will be imposed. The world is too connected now through <br/>
the internet. Simply ignore the request. If *everyone* ignores the <br/>
draft, there&#39;s no way to enforce it. Even if they find a way to enforce <br/>
the actual draft, they can&#39;t make someone fight. Simply canNOT.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And last:  Unschoolers have got to be THE worst draftees. &lt;g&gt; Too many <br/>
questions. Not enough &quot;YESSIR!s&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T let this keep you up at night!!!<br/>

____________________________________________________________<br/>
 <br/>
My son, James, just turned 18 on the 22 of this month. We talked about that  <br/>
- how he has to register and what the consequences are if he does not - and to <br/>
 be clear in his reasons to or not to register. I am hoping, to be fully <br/>
honest  here, that I can raise Julian, who just turned 5, to be a Conscientious <br/>
Objector  because of MY fears of the draft, war, death...and I know those are MY <br/>
fears.  I&#39;m not sure how to cope with that. I read an article/story in <br/>
Mothering  Magazine about a child raises as such and they kept his peace activist <br/>
works and  stuff he did in a portfolio, just in case. But would I be forcing my <br/>
ideas on my  son? And yet, is it possible for me to raise a child that would <br/>
WANT to go...?  (as in the way I am raising the kids, not &quot;possible&quot; in the <br/>
literal sense - I&#39;m  not sure I&#39;m saying that right) Gosh, this brought up a lot <br/>
for me! Wow! <br/>
 <br/>
I have the site on registering, btw...and that story I think is online, if  <br/>
anyone wants to see it, I&#39;ll be glad to hunt it down and post a link (to both). <br/>
 <br/>
As for your son, Linda, I *think* that certain &quot;mental conditions&quot; do  indeed <br/>
save a person from the draft. What a phrase, huh? But your story above  <br/>
reminded me of that Mothering article (which I can&#39;t remember the outcome, but  it <br/>
may help you out). I&#39;d also suggest just looking into reasons one can use  <br/>
against the armed forces for not being drafted. There MUST be something out  <br/>
there - and usually, it&#39;s information that helps calm my frazzled fears. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh geeze...lol...here it is: <br/>
