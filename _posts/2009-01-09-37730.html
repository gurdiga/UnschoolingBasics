<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971528344">So last night, I mentioned to my dh how my mother claimed that by not<br/>
&quot;making&quot; my kids go to school, they are more likely to have terrible work<br/>
ethic when they get older or some such, and it launched into me checking out<br/>
if he too feels like we&#39;ve been moving in different directions of late.  He<br/>
explained the allowance and chore thing to me further.  He started giving a<br/>
little more than a dollar per week (our oldest gets a dollar and 5 cents, 3<br/>
quarters, 3 dimes) and he made three piggy banks for them: save, give and<br/>
spend.  He&#39;s also instituted a list of chores that we could use help with,<br/>
which the kids seem to enjoy and he does not seem to want to tie to<br/>
allowance anymore.  He was upset that I shut down the conversation with the<br/>
curt &quot;No&quot; when he brought up tying allowance to chores, and I apologized<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the kids seem to be happy with what he has proposed, but I did<br/>
do some questioning of &quot;what if so and so doesn&#39;t do x&quot;, etc.  He seems okay<br/>
with that.  Then, I got a bit emotional, explaining that I think we are at a<br/>
crossroads with our oldest (7), who doesn&#39;t believe to his core that we love<br/>
him and respect him, even though we very much do.  Clearly, that indicates<br/>
to me that *we* need to make some changes.  I explained to him how much I<br/>
want it to be so that when he is 17 (or whatever age), and, for example, is<br/>
thinking about drinking when he goes out, that he can talk to us and make<br/>
arrangements for us to pick him up or what have you.  In short, I want him<br/>
to feel close enough and loved enough by us that he can be himself, so that<br/>
the guiding principle that I&#39;m trying to live by is &quot;does this build upon<br/>
our relationship or tear it down?&quot; when I interact with him (which I thank<br/>
you all for).<br/>
<br/>
I acknowledged that I&#39;ve failed miserably a few times recently, but that I&#39;m<br/>
trying to be aware and recognize it without beating myself up which only<br/>
seems to make it worse.  He said he felt better after the conversation, so<br/>
we&#39;ll see where this goes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve found that these kinds of conversations can be really valuble in <br/>
terms of helping partners move closer to unschooling. So much of <br/>
unschooling has to do with being kinder and more open with our kids. <br/>
Our partners can see that, and can find themselves wanting a piece of <br/>
the action! although they may not always be able to articulate that. <br/>
<br/>
Talking about mistakes can help, too - with partners *and* kids. It <br/>
helps to be able to see inside someone else&#39;s process, as it were, <br/>
even when (maybe especially when) that process doesn&#39;t produce a <br/>
perfect result. It makes us all more human, more genuine and <br/>
approachable. <br/>
