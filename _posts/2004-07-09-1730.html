<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125041735">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple of days, long enough to get *a lot* of mail ;-), and I just wanted to post with a few things. <br/>
First, thanks for being here. You are all a very thoughtful and articulate group of people, and it is wonderful to hear how much energy and creativity you put into parenting.<br/>
There was a discussion thread about &quot;demands&quot; disguised as &quot;requests&quot; and it is something that I&#39;ve been struggling with. I found your reminders to &quot;really let kids say no&quot; to be very helpful. I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;ve found that phrasing things using non-violent communication also goes a long way toward owning my own feelings instead of making authoritarian statements and it also helps my kids (and husband) understand clearly the impact their actions have on me. In short, NVC is objectively stating what you see, telling the other person how it makes you feel using I statements, telling them why you feel that way, and then telling them what you need. An example with Bethan (3.25).<br/>
Old way: <br/>
Me: I&#39;d like you to pick up your toys. I&#39;m happy to help you.<br/>
Bethan: I don&#39;t want to.<br/>
Me: Picks up toys with or without help, but feels resentful.<br/>
With NVC.<br/>
Me: When I see your toys on the floor, I worry that someone might trip on them and get hurt, and your toys might get broken. I&#39;m going to pick them up to keep everyone safe. Would you like to help me?<br/>
Bethan: &quot;I would be sad if someone got hurt, and I like my toys so I don&#39;t want them to get broken.&quot; (Helps pick up). Or..&quot;I think people should watch out where they&#39;re walking so they don&#39;t break my toys or get hurt.&quot; (Doesn&#39;t help and I pick up).<br/>
The difference here is how *I* feel about the process, I have a need for order, I&#39;m the one who&#39;s worried about the toys, so I am going to do something about it. Also, Bethan responds to &quot;I&#39;m doing this because it helps mommy feel better.&quot; Rather than &quot;I&#39;m doing this because it&#39;s the &quot;rule&quot; or the &quot;right thing to do&quot; is to keep clean.<br/>
Does that make sense at all? Anyway, maybe not the best example of NVC, but I think it&#39;s a wonderful communication tool.<br/>

I wanted to chime in here because I have been using some NVC techniques<br/>
myself and I know Jen (Hi, Jen!) ... I completely agree with what Kelly is<br/>
saying about the danger of having our children feel responsible for our<br/>
feelings.  I would never want my kids to feel like they are doing something<br/>
because they are &quot;making&quot; mommy feel bad by not doing it or &quot;making&quot; me<br/>
happy by doing it.  I do want to say that my perception of NVC, and the way<br/>
I use it, has nothing to do with responsibility for the feelings of others.<br/>
NVC works off the belief that all of us, children and adults, act in<br/>
accordance with our needs and the needs of others.  So when I use NVC with<br/>
my children, for me, it&#39;s about setting aside &quot;It&#39;s time to clean up now&quot;<br/>
and telling them about whatever my need is about cleaning up.  That gives my<br/>
child a choice to respond to my expressed need.  It also opens up the lines<br/>
of communication so that they can express their needs and we can see if we<br/>
can get all of our needs met together in some way.  If they say no, it&#39;s not<br/>
that they&#39;ve made me feel bad and it&#39;s okay for them to say no.<br/>
<br/>
So, to turn the situation around and look at my child&#39;s request to me...if<br/>
my child for instance comes to me late at night to ask me to play a long<br/>
barbie game for the zillionth time that day and I&#39;m really tired, I may say<br/>
&quot;Gosh, I&#39;m really tired.  Let&#39;s play it tomorrow.&quot;  My child may be okay<br/>
with that, or they may say &quot;No, mom.  I really need to play it again.<br/>
Please...&quot; etcetera.  I as a person have a choice to hear their need and put<br/>
aside my tiredness to meet that need because I love my child and it&#39;s<br/>
important to me to try to meet her needs.  That&#39;s healthy in my opinion.<br/>
IF, however, I feel somehow responsible for my child&#39;s happiness...ie I&#39;m<br/>
thinking that my child&#39;s unhappiness at my saying after hearing her out &quot;no,<br/>
I AM really too tired&quot; is my responsibility...and that conversely I&#39;m<br/>
responsible for her happiness if I do it, then I&#39;m in trouble.  Then I am in<br/>
the position of feeling that her feelings are &quot;forcing&quot; me to do things.<br/>
This is not &quot;choice&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I see the same thing to be true conversely for my kids.  They should not<br/>
feel they are responsible for how I feel, but I can express my needs, have a<br/>
conversation, and give them a choice to try to meet those needs if I can<br/>
express them at an age appropriate level and without loaded stuff like<br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215832249">Hi all,<br/>
I knew when I wrote &quot;making mommy feel better&quot; it didn&#39;t capture what I meant, but I was tired and lazy and assumed my short hand would be understood. Thanks for the opportunity to hone my communication skills ;-)<br/>
What I *meant* was more along the lines of communicating the overall notion: &quot;in our family, we enjoy contributing to each other&#39;s well-being and quality of life.&quot; So I say things while I&#39;m gardening like &quot;It makes me feel good to grow veggies for us that are healthy for your body and give you the energy you need to run and play.&quot;<br/>
I also want to say that although no one is responsible for another&#39;s feelings, our statements and behaviors have an impact on how people feel. Obviously we think so, otherwise this list wouldn&#39;t spend so much time talking about how adults can impact children! NVC allows me to tell my daughter about the impact of her behavior without it turning into a guilt trip. <br/>
&quot;When you use such a big voice to say &#39;GO AWAY&#39; when I come downstairs, I feel like I&#39;m not a fun person to be around. I can see how much fun you&#39;re having with grandma, and I just came down to let you know that I&#39;m going out to water the garden. You can join me if you want to. Instead of saying &quot;GO AWAY&quot;, could you say &#39;Mommy, I&#39;m in the middle of a project!, instead?&quot;<br/>
This both helps me hear &quot;GO AWAY&quot; for what it really is, and helps my daughter understand how to reframe her needs in a way that is easier for me (and others) to hear and respond to what she needs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763386225">So I&#39;ve been trying to think of an easier way to describe how it is that I<br/>
can feel responsible for my actions, for their impact on others, but not for<br/>
creating the specific feelings...for anyone else out there still mulling<br/>
this over.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve come up with...<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say that I jump out from behind a door and yell &quot;Boo!&quot; at two<br/>
children.  One is scared and cries.  The other one yells &quot;Boo&quot; back, laughs<br/>
and thinks it&#39;s a great game.  Obviously I did one action and got two<br/>
responses.  I did not pick the feelings or reactions of each child.  They<br/>
reacted as they did due to who they were and their perception of what I did.<br/>
Does that mean that the reaction of the child who cried is &quot;her problem&quot;?<br/>
Does that mean that I do not feel responsible for the impact of my yelling<br/>
&quot;boo&quot; on the child who cried?  Absolutely not!!  I would consider myself<br/>
responsible for choosing the action, I would feel responsible for it&#39;s<br/>
impact and so I&#39;d feel responsible to comfort the child and talk to them<br/>
about their feelings and needs.  But there is no direct causal relationship<br/>
to the feelings.  We do not control one anothers feelings like that.<br/>
<br/>
In case this is an issue for you, Kimmy, with the strong reaction you&#39;ve had<br/>
to these threads, I see this is true of my own upbringing too.  I was raised<br/>
in an emotionally abusive environment.  The things my parents chose to do<br/>
had a tremendously negative impact on me.  Are my parents responsible for<br/>
that?  Hell yes.  They are responsible for choosing their actions.  They are<br/>
responsible for the impact those actions had (that&#39;s not to say they have<br/>
taken any responsibility, but it is to say that I feel they are responsible<br/>
for that).  They did not however choose my feelings in response to what they<br/>
did.  Those came from how I perceived what they did and from my own<br/>
personality.  If you asked my siblings, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d express different<br/>
emotions and perceptions from the same experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223438124">Joan,<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for trying to explain that to me. I feel very conflicted <br/>
at this time as I am trying really hard to do what is best for my <br/>
little one and for my family as a whole. No family suppoer askide <br/>
from Hubby and he is just as new at this and so things come up daily <br/>
that we have to step back and question. And no local support as it <br/>
seems everyone in this area are strict homeschoolers what want you <br/>
to go to their church to be part of their groups. LOL Even the <br/>
churches have &quot;clicks&quot; it seems, you can not go to one church and <br/>
meet up with a group from another! I find it all silly and so I am <br/>
staying away, when I first brought up unschooling, you should have <br/>
seen the looks I got and then the lectures and questions. I deared <br/>
not tell them my faith! So then I come on here, trying to share as <br/>
much as I can so that others can help, and I feel it all turned <br/>
around on me. As if some people give all this respect to the kids <br/>
but not other adults. Feeling all out of sorts I lashed out and <br/>
found myself being extream! I am starting to wish like many others <br/>
that are not saying anything, that there was a basics, basics, group <br/>
where others do not expect us to know what we should be doing. LOL <br/>
<br/>
 -sigh- Chances are I am just trying to do what ever I can to make <br/>
sure I do not do to my child what my parents did to me. They did not <br/>
talk to the kids, just gave lists of work to be done and rules on <br/>
top of rules and when they where not followed... &quot;shiver&quot;  Still <br/>
scares of some of my family and I am an adult now. <br/>
<br/>
  It will get better though, I will keep trying to understand it <br/>
all, and I will not let people who upset me change my path. I want <br/>
my home to be peaceful and good for all of us. Thank you for trying. <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>

  Thank you for trying to explain that to me. I feel very conflicted <br/>
at this time as I am trying really hard to do what is best for my <br/>
little one and for my family as a whole. No family suppoer askide <br/>
from Hubby and he is just as new at this and so things come up daily <br/>
that we have to step back and question. And no local support as it <br/>
seems everyone in this area are strict homeschoolers what want you <br/>
to go to their church to be part of their groups. LOL Even the <br/>
churches have &quot;clicks&quot; it seems, you can not go to one church and <br/>
meet up with a group from another! I find it all silly and so I am <br/>
staying away, when I first brought up unschooling, you should have <br/>
seen the looks I got and then the lectures and questions. I deared <br/>
not tell them my faith! So then I come on here, trying to share as <br/>
much as I can so that others can help, and I feel it all turned <br/>
around on me. As if some people give all this respect to the kids <br/>
but not other adults. Feeling all out of sorts I lashed out and <br/>
found myself being extream! I am starting to wish like many others <br/>
that are not saying anything, that there was a basics, basics, group <br/>
where others do not expect us to know what we should be doing. LOL <br/>
<br/>
 -sigh- Chances are I am just trying to do what ever I can to make <br/>
sure I do not do to my child what my parents did to me. They did not <br/>
talk to the kids, just gave lists of work to be done and rules on <br/>
top of rules and when they where not followed... &quot;shiver&quot;  Still <br/>
scares of some of my family and I am an adult now. <br/>
<br/>
  It will get better though, I will keep trying to understand it <br/>
all, and I will not let people who upset me change my path. I want <br/>
my home to be peaceful and good for all of us. Thank you for trying. <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>

This is how it is for many, many unschoolers.   This is how it is for me.<br/>
 While my husband is supportive, he is constantly pressured, quizzed and<br/>
lectured by his family about unschooling and often needs *my* support to<br/>
withstand the garbage dump of their inner fears.  <br/>
<br/>
This is why there are unschooling lists where people can be engaged with<br/>
like minded individuals.   This is why I don&#39;t wade through the thousands<br/>
of general homeschooling lists.  If I want general homeschooling it out<br/>
my door and down two blocks and those kids won&#39;t be able to come outside<br/>
and play until after four. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you want people to sound if they disagree with you.  But<br/>
Kimmy, if people disagree with you that doesn&#39;t mean anything.  You still<br/>
have the freedom and power to live any life you want to with your kid.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter what your family says, what your community says, what<br/>
we say.  You are not the victim of any mysterious mental control from<br/>
this list.  You get to do whatever you want.  You get to think and <br/>
believe whatever you want.  <br/>
<br/>
But this list *is* for talking about the very basics of the unschooling<br/>
philosophy and building a foundation in unschooling.   That&#39;s what we&#39;ll<br/>
talk about here and you are free to use the parts you feel good about and<br/>
leave the parts you don&#39;t behind.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been out camping and hiking - on and off over the last few weeks and<br/>
I&#39;m hundreds of e-mails behind.  I&#39;ve only been able to pop in when the<br/>
guest room/computer room is empty and grab what mail I can.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling out of sorts and I don&#39;t know any other way to<br/>
say this but you can chose to find good stuff here and use it and ignore<br/>
what you don&#39;t like, or you can chose to complain that not everything is<br/>
good.  One of those choices will be better for you and your family and<br/>
this list and one won&#39;t. <br/>
