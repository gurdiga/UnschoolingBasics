<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642048765">An example at our house is that<br/>
DS *loves* Bionicles. Every 3 to 6 months, Lego comes out with a new<br/>
&#39;set&#39; of them - I think there are now about half a dozen or so sets of<br/>
Bionicles. There are Inikas, Baraki, Toas, and so on. I don&#39;t play with<br/>
them much. BUT I know the general name groups (though not each<br/>
individual character), which types of weapons there are (ratuka<br/>
spinners, zampherspheres, and squids). I spotted a book in the bookstore<br/>
that gave the backstory of the original Toas and picked it up for DS. We<br/>
spotted a Bionicle boardgame at a tag sale and picked it up. I suggested<br/>
to a relative that the Bionicle game for the PS2 might make a nice<br/>
holiday gift. And so on.<br/>

Duncan is on a Bionicle Kick right now. Luckily they&#39;re only $9-10 <br/>
each!<br/>
<br/>
Did you know Scholastic makes Bionicle books? A series. $5/book at <br/>
Barnes & Noble. I should look at Amazon or half.com.  Easier for *me* <br/>
to understand who&#39;s what and with whom and what their powers are and <br/>
why. I know most of them now, due to reading the books. The hardest <br/>
thing for me is pronouncing the names! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s some serious challenge <br/>
to make my tongue make some of those sounds! &lt;G&gt;  I *do* have most of <br/>
the characters down now. My faves are Mantax and Ehlek and Pridak. I&#39;m <br/>
looking to get him Vezon (or Vezak---I can&#39;t remember. Same guy, <br/>
different form) with Fenrak, the spider.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s offering a Bionicle funshop at the conference this year. We&#39;re <br/>
going to bring a big bag of parts so that newbies can make their own <br/>
&quot;designer&quot; Bionicles.<br/>
<br/>
My den is littered with Baraki and Toa Inikas in fun positions on every <br/>
available surface. They&#39;re like artist&#39;s models---you can position them <br/>
in so many cool stances. Some are playful, some attacking, some <br/>
sleeping. One&#39;s upside down! &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re really cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59573615">My ds Tyler is a Bionicle freak.  He has torn apart<br/>
all of them that he owns, and rebuilds them making his<br/>
own creations.  Although he has most of them, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any of the brand new ones yet, but loves<br/>
to play Bionicles.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a Bionicle board game that we got at a<br/>
garage sale.  My dh and ds has played it a couple of<br/>
times, but dd needs simple explanations of how to<br/>
play, and it looks very involved.  We also have the<br/>
movies and the games for the ps2.  Tyler has read all<br/>
of the books, and loves them.  They don&#39;t come out<br/>
very often, but when they do, and we have the money<br/>
for them, we buy them for him.  We also go shopping at<br/>
downtown Disney when we are in Florida, we always go<br/>
to the lego shop and look at all of the new and old<br/>
stuff.  That is one of the things that we always like<br/>
to do, is to encourage the things that the children<br/>
really enjoy doing.  I don&#39;t know all of the Bionicle<br/>
names either, but I do make sure to take the time out<br/>
to learn from ds.<br/>
<br/>
I have watched all 3 movies with him, and they<br/>
actually aren&#39;t too bad.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh man! Here we were having decided that since we&#39;re doing some other<br/>
&quot;big&quot; travels this year that we were going to skip the conference (even<br/>
though it is back on the east coast and more accessible) and now you<br/>
throw this into the mix! <br/>
 <br/>
And yeah it really is nice that they are not terribly expensive. Also,<br/>
there&#39;s a website that contains instructions for building them &quot;as<br/>
designed&quot; in case the original instructions have wandered away. I&#39;m not<br/>
sure whether it&#39;s the official Bionicle site or more of a &#39;fan site&#39; of<br/>
someone who has collected and scanned in all the instructions. If anyone<br/>
wants/needs it, I can check with DH for the link.<br/>
