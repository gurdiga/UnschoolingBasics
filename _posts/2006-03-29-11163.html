<div id="ygrps-yiv-358221488">Hi, just found you guys today.  My name is Shannon and I am the proud mom of two dd&#39;s, 12 & 7 (almost 8).  I wouldn&#39;t say that I am an unschooler; very eclectic in my approach and try to work with the girls where they are with whatever means seems to work at the time.  I joined this group because I am always trying to learn more to be a better mom/teacher/student and love haveing the interactions and support from other hser&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the DVR, we are a 5 Tivo family and I don&#39;t know how we would cope without them.  There is so much on TV that is educational from PBS, Discovery, History Channel, A&E, Animal Planet, TLC, HGTV . . . I could go on and on cuz I can find a lesson in almost everything!  We even have one that you can burn recorded programs on disc.  I just learned about the Comcast DVR&#39;s too and that they aren&#39;t that much more expensive and you can get more channels when you upgrade than we get currenlty.  If any of my Tivo&#39;s die, that will be the replacement.<br/>

&gt; Hi Leslie,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We got our DVR back in November or December when DirecTV was offering it<br/>
&gt; free with a rebate.  It only works on the TV that it&#39;s connected to.<br/>
&gt; We have it connected to our TV in our playroom, not our big TV (we have<br/>
&gt; a high-def TV).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We recently upgraded to the DVR with our cable service (found out it was<br/>
only a $6 difference from what we already had!)  This has been a lifesaver<br/>
for our family.  Keon can record all the Power Rangers Mystic Force he wants<br/>
and Mary Elayne can record something she wants that interferes with things<br/>
other people are watching and I can record a full season of Dr. Who and<br/>
watch it when I want to and zap all the (mostly stupid) commercials.  It has<br/>
saved countless arguments and saved my sanity!  The cool thing is that no<br/>
one even seems to argue over what gets recorded and what gets shown live.<br/>
And with our system we can record 2 different shows while we are watching a<br/>
third!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE my DVR!<br/>
<br/>

to watch something they enjoy without having to live their day <br/>
around the TV&#39;s schedule.   <br/>

I think that finding a lesson in everything ruins the fun.  And in <br/>
unschooling, I find that I am becoming more antagonistic to <br/>
schoolish words like &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;lessons.&quot;  It&#39;s just a TV <br/>
program.  Does my child want to watch it?  That&#39;s for them to <br/>

Well, I am not against anything educational and my kids love learning from the tv so it works for us.  <br/>
