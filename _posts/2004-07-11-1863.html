<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217866832">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m contemplating coming to the conference, and wanted to know if, in previous year, others have come alone with a toddler? My dd will be 29 months then...Dh may or may not be able to attend, too...<br/>

  &quot;We also couldn&#39;t leave<br/>
  the animals with no care, nor taking the time away from our kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s the beauty of an unschooling conference...it&#39;s for the whole <br/>
  family.  Do you not have neighbors that will watch the animals for a <br/>
  weekend?<br/>
  Time away from the kids is NOT an issue at Live and Learn!:)<br/>
