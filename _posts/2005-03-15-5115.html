<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; force<br/>
&gt; me to send her to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Homeschooling makes the schools very unhappy, so you might as well <br/>
forget unschooling if this is your priority.<br/>
I hope your priority is that little girl, not some government entity <br/>
that doesn&#39;t give a hoot about you or how healthy your child is.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t something you do to keep ANYONE else happy, other <br/>
than your children. They need to be the priority, their thoughts, <br/>
feelings, needs and desires matter more than what anyone else thinks <br/>
about school vs. homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to appease the schools, you&#39;re just bringing a lot of <br/>
potential misery into your life and inviting someone to control <br/>
aspects of your life that they have no business controlling.<br/>
Take control of your families choices now. The school need not be <br/>
part of your life any longer.<br/>
