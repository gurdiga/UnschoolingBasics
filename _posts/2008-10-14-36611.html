<div id="ygrps-yiv-683528414">Hi everyone-<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if you are getting this more than once- we x-posted to many lists..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please join us for Great Big Happy Life- An Unschoolers&#39; Conference Retreat<br/>
running from  Tuesday April 28, 2009- Friday May 1, 2009. The conference is<br/>
for everyone and anyone who wants to come -not just New Jerseyans. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The conference site is a gorgeous camp in Lebanon, New Jersey- it has nature<br/>
trails, a lake, an awesome creek for creek hikes, great stars, beautiful<br/>
grounds and wifi too! We plan to open up early bird registration in the next<br/>
few weeks. As with so many other unschooling conferences that have taken<br/>
root in the past few years, this one was inspired by the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference that just had its final magnificent run in September. Great Big<br/>
Happy Life will be a blend of inspirational presentations, awesome<br/>
participant led funshops, scavenger hunts,  informal discussions, intense<br/>
relaxation and just generally hanging out with other whole life/radical<br/>
unschooling families. You can visit the website at<br/>
www.greatbighappylife.com- we will be updating the site soon so check back<br/>
over the next week or two to read about accommodations, fees, programming,<br/>
and all that good stuff. We have many cool ideas, and we welcome your input<br/>
as we go forward. <br/>
<br/>
