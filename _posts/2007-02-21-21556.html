 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the policy where my daughter takes lessons. I wouldn&#39;t say  <br/>
it&#39;s split in two. It&#39;s just the responsibility of the rider to get  <br/>
there early enough to tack up the horse and, yes, clean its hooves  <br/>
and clean up after it. Then followed by a half hour lesson. ($34 per  <br/>
half hour.) (And if she doesn&#39;t get done by the time the lesson  <br/>
starts, it just eats into lesson time so that&#39;s a big incentive to  <br/>
get there early enough!)<br/>
<br/>
They provide helmets where she rides, but, who knows how long the  <br/>
previous wearer went before washing her hair ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You might check to see if they have a bulletin board where you can  <br/>
put up a helmet for sale (or buy a used one) if it doesn&#39;t work out.<br/>
<br/>
But, in terms of lessons, I bet horseback riding has the fewest girls  <br/>
who give up after a few lessons ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If a bit of poop stood between my daughter and riding, I&#39;d clean it  <br/>
up for her. It wouldn&#39;t be taking on a huge task, though, since she&#39;s  <br/>
been riding since June and I think the horse has only pooped once  <br/>
while it was being tacked up.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Very normal. It&#39;s called &quot;stable management&quot; and is a HUGE part of <br/>
horsemanship and horse ownership.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I mean it seems to me that we are paying (and not cheap) and then<br/>
having to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You go to an art studio---do you expect to walk away from the mess? Not <br/>
clean brushes or pick up stray clay? Not wipe down your surfaces? <br/>
Horses are messy. It&#39;s part of the deal. Plus---it&#39;s not as if you have <br/>
to *touch* it. You get to use a shovel/broom/pitchfork, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Somehow did not seem right to me..ok the saddle<br/>
and brushing is one thing..but I was also afraid to pick up the<br/>
horse leg and scrap the hoove with that metal pick and having to &quot;be<br/>
careful &quot; not to touch the sensitive part.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not *that* sensitive. Just be gentle with the frog. It&#39;s not as if <br/>
you have to avoid touching it at all---just be gentle.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I asked if the kids have<br/>
to clean the hooves and she said no because she has to think about<br/>
the saftey of THE HORSE and they could damage the hoove.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s her job tot hink of the safety of the horse. They&#39;re in her care.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, they weigh half a ton! And you don&#39;t want something that big hurt <br/>
or mad at you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids (especially little ones) don&#39;t necessarily have the dexterity it <br/>
takes to balance the leg and pick the hoof. I would usually hold the <br/>
leg while a young child would scrape. *I* don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much <br/>
about the scraping the frog as it is holding up that leg and maybe <br/>
throwing the horse or child off-balance---endangering both.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
she also said it is a state law that<br/>
minors have to wear a equestrian helmut..then she said we would have<br/>
to BUY THEM. We can borrow them the first few times only. They are<br/>
$40 each. That is a lot to spend in case my daughters up and change<br/>
their minds about this! If it is a law..should not they have to<br/>
provide them? ANYONE???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think all states now have a law about helmets and minors. $40 is <br/>
cheap. Most I sold 20 years ago were $50-$100. I guess they have less <br/>
expensive materials that are more durable now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s your kid&#39;s head. Why balk?<br/>
<br/>
You can always sell it to the next kid in line. You can also find used <br/>
ones at tack shops everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
As adults, our butts are heavier than our head. But until after <br/>
puberty, kids&#39; heads are heavier than their butts, so if they are <br/>
thrown or fall, they land on their heads. Buy the helmet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725037914">I have been riding since i was 6 and competativly riding in A  class grand <br/>
prixs (the stuff you see on ESPN) since i was 13.  I have  always riden at show <br/>
barns, so picking up after your horse (poop, brushing,  bath, blanket, put <br/>
away) isnt an option. You either do it or you dont ride  there.  The frog is the <br/>
sensitive part in the hoof, but really it&#39;s pretty  hard to damage it unless <br/>
you are stabbing the hoof cleaner into the frog.   Otherwise it is pretty <br/>
difficult to hurt the hoof if you are doing it  correctly.  The hoof of a horse is <br/>
just like out nails.  They are made  in essence out of the same stuff and have <br/>
no nerve endings.  Which is why  shoeing a horse doesn&#39;t bother them.  In <br/>
regards to a helmet, i would  be very carfeful if you buy a used one.  There are <br/>
really 2 different types  of helmets.  Certified and uncertified.  If your <br/>
daughter might show,  she CANNOT wear uncertified helm&#39;s till she is 18 and it <br/>
has to have a chin  strap.   In the horse world we call them bubble helmets <br/>
because they  are huge and look like a bubble.   <br/>

I am a horse owner and life-long avid equestrian. I  ride, my niece rides, my <br/>
3 kids ride. I have done dressage, show jumpers,  hunters, trail, etc...  And <br/>
I have fallen on just about every part of  my body and seen just about every <br/>
type of horse related accident there is.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, yes, cleaning up is part of the deal but  it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
called a 60 min lesson if 30 minutes is cleaning.  Generally, beginning lessons <br/>
should cost about $25 for each 1/2 hour.  So if you ride for 60 minutes it should <br/>
be $50 and then you should BE  THERE for about 2 hours total, saddling and <br/>
brushing for 30 minutes  before, and cleaning and giving a bath to the horse (if <br/>
it is FL  where I live and warm enough) for the last 30 minutes. If it is 30 <br/>
minutes  of riding, you should be there for 1 hour and 3 minutes but you <br/>
should  only pay for the time you are in the saddle and there should be barn  <br/>
assistants who teach and help the child with all the cleaning stuff while  the <br/>
teacher moves on to other riding lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as safety and the helmet is concerned; the helmet  should be on and <br/>
strapped the entire time the child is near or on the  horse. So when picking <br/>
hooves the helmet is on, when brushing, when  riding. All the time. A kick in the <br/>
head can be fatal without the  helmet. A lot of people only use the helmet <br/>
when ON the horse. That is  total nonsense. I learned this while working with a <br/>
British instructor who  said that in England children are never seen around <br/>
horses without their  hard hats. Your stable should not have to provide one. <br/>
Safety regulations  on them are always changing. If they have one and someone <br/>
fell while  wearing it, the helmet is no longer usable. They need to be CURRENTLY <br/>
 certified and up to all the highest standards.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I would not DREAM of putting my child near a  horse without a <br/>
helmet in the $175-400 range. There are  certain brands that are better than <br/>
others if you want to  email me privately. Yes, you can buy a certified helmet <br/>
(the  only kind that protects you) for $40 but it will not help your child as  <br/>
much as one that goes lower down toward the neck which aids in preventing  <br/>
paralysis and brain stem injuries. I also would always use long  sleeve t-shirts, <br/>
leather schooling chaps over breeches or jeans and boots  with a heal. All the <br/>
things I just mentioned can be found on eBay  sometimes for as little as a <br/>
DOLLAR each! The helmet MUST be new.  Otherwise it could have been in an accident <br/>
and of no use. <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
PS my kids are not allowed to pick out hooves without my  help. I don&#39;t think <br/>
it is safe.<br/>
 <br/>
PPS a great way to teach horse safety to your  child is to study Parelli <br/>
Natural Horsemanship. BTW Pat Parelli  homeschooled  his children. <br/>
