<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917200997">Hi<br/>
My name is Julie and we live in Florida. I unschool my daughter who is almost 8 years old. We are enjoying unschooling and meeting other people who unschool. I choose to unschool mainly because of my work schedule and my daughter does not do well with strict structure. She enjoys reading and math. Writing is a real hassel but I figure it will come eventually.<br/>
ARe there any other unschoolers in the Ocala area of Florida?<br/>
Our family wishes you and your family the best of hoilidays<br/>
Julie and Daughter Carrissa</div>
