<div id="ygrps-yiv-32823715">OK. There was a documentary about Hitler on, and I remembered Luke <br/>
mentioning Hitler to me a couple of times over the last few months, <br/>
so I told him it was on. He said he didn&#39;t want to watch it, so I <br/>
said no problem and sat down to watch it myself. After a few minutes <br/>
of watching it, I yelled into the other room to him, &quot;Hey Luke Did <br/>
you know Hitler was a sex maniac?&quot; becasue the docuimentary said he <br/>
was obseessed with sex. And Luke says--get this- I knew that! <br/>
<br/>
Apparently, he has been researching Hitler at least a little bit to <br/>
have known that. I&#39;m wondering what else he knows about him, but I <br/>
don&#39;t want to push the issue. So I let it drop. <br/>
<br/>
Then, Later in the evening,he is on the computer and I overhear him <br/>
say to his brother, &quot;Did you know we&#39;re descendants of &quot;homo-<br/>
erectus&quot; and he laughs. He liked the sound of the word because it <br/>
says &quot;homo&quot; in it. He had asked the questions about the origin of <br/>
man earlier today, and I ordered a book from the library, but I <br/>
guess he wanted to know more now. SO HE WAS READING IT ON HIS OWN!<br/>
<br/>
He still has a big problem with books, but reading on the web is <br/>
wonderful! I wish he didn&#39;t have his aversion to real books, but <br/>
maybe with time. <br/>
<br/>
Now my question is- what about math? My state requires that we cover <br/>
Algebra and Geometry and I don&#39;t know either topic. I can&#39;t see him <br/>
playing with Algebra and Geometry of his own free will.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get real life experience with Algebra and Geometry?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054868640">&lt;&lt;real life experience with algebra and geometry&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My family is not math happy folks....we aren&#39;t the kind of people that like to play math games for fun but we still have lots of algebra and geometry going on....the kids learned it differently than school kids though....it doesn&#39;t look the same.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra--There are seven of us and 18 cookies. How many cookies can each of us get?  7 times X equals 18.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring out how much would we needed for sheds and such.<br/>
<br/>
Geometry--getting the goat shed square when we built it. Playing pool, etc..<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned what the problems looked like in the physical world rather than how to write down a formula and work it.  Adriane (my 15yo) wants to attend the local hs next year (that is where all the 17yo boys are &lt;grin&gt;) and I knew she had limited experience in math notation.  So I hooked her up with a tutor over the summer.  The tutor says Adriane is already head and shoulders above most kids her age because she isn&#39;t afraid of math and understand the terms easily.<br/>
<br/>
This is just backwards of how school kids learn math.  They learn the notation first and then eventually, perhaps use that notation for real world problems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Algebra is figuring out an unknown element in a problem.  We do it all<br/>
the time.  When our checkbook doesn&#39;t balance by 52¢ there is an<br/>
unknown element that is causing it to be off.  That is algebra.<br/>
Algebra is figuring out how many servings of brownies you will get if<br/>
you have 5 batches.  There is nothing mysterious about algebra.  What<br/>
makes algebra mysterious are textbooks trying to make people think in<br/>
algebraic ways through a serious of ever increasing problems which<br/>
make no sense to the majority of people who are having to do them in<br/>
order to pass some class.<br/>
<br/>
Geometry is the math of shapes.  Most of it is totally irrelevant when<br/>
dealing with real life.  How often do *most* people have to figure out<br/>
what the volume is of a cone?  The only cone that most people deal<br/>
with on a regular bases seems to be an ice cream cone and the only<br/>
reason that one needs to worry about the volume is when it is full and<br/>
you have a nice scoop on the top to start with.  I would presume that<br/>
many of us took geometry in high school or college.  How many of us<br/>
remember how to figure out the volume of a cone?  We deal with shapes,<br/>
though, on an almost daily basis.  Putting boxes on shelves, cans in<br/>
cupboards, soup in bowls, cutting out art projects, drawing, doodling,<br/>
decorating, moving furniture etc.  We see volume in those same boxes<br/>
and cans.  When we cook we use geometry.  Measurements, volume,<br/>
placement of cookies on baking stones, having the right size pot for<br/>
mac and cheese.  Geometry is not a static activity.  Geometry most<br/>
makes sense when it is used in context.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t force math on him.  Instead find a way to translate what he is<br/>
doing into the requirements of your state.  It takes practice to see<br/>
those things and put them down to satisfy requirements because we<br/>
don&#39;t think in terms of, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m doing algebra&quot; or &quot;I think I should<br/>
use geometry to figure this problem out.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think that much of the answers you are looking for are only things that can be seen once your eye&#39;s have been opened.<br/>
Stop looking for school. It&#39;s not going to be there.<br/>
Deschooling is not just for children, IMO, it&#39;s more for the adults. If kids are given time to heal, they will heal. Just let them play, no matter their age.  YOU are the one who has to deschool. This may take you a year or even more if you have college, a Master&#39;s or more.<br/>
You are the one that needs to see what is outside of the box.<br/>
Many posters have given you many wonderful ideas and thoughts. They are all a great place to START.<br/>
So my suggestion is to start BEing with your kids. Enjoy them as you would a favored guest in your home. Look for Joy, look for Fun, look for Peace.<br/>
That&#39;s it for now. Take one year, just one, and get rid of all the have to&#39;s should be&#39;s and what if&#39;s.<br/>
Just BE.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Real&quot; books are just words and pictures on paper as opposed to words and pictures on a screen. They are both equally good at conveying the author&#39;s intent. And if you watch it in a movie or TV show you get moving pictures and narration. That can convey meaning and intent better in some instances. I wouldn&#39;t hold &quot;real&quot; books above other ways to get information.<br/>

a child graduate from a PA high school without completing algebra and<br/>
geometry?  I know it wasn&#39;t a requirement when I went to high school<br/>
and it isn&#39;t a requirement in the current public school system here.<br/>
Makes me wonder if the standards for homeschooling are higher than<br/>
those for public schooling.  Also does it say *how* these subjects are<br/>
supposed to be covered?  If not then hands on day-to-day use of math<br/>
and physical shapes should suffice.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82930729">There is a Yahoogroup called PAUnschoolers (I think)<br/>
They would be much better resources for questions that are specific to PA.<br/>
Personally, I think the best way to unschoool in PA is either to move out of PA or to go &quot;underground&quot; and not register as a homeschooler. The latter would be a difficult option once one has already registered.<br/>
When I lived there, I did not register my children after researching the truancy laws.<br/>
YMMV<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828717127">I forgot to answer the second part of your question...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t specify how it is to be covered or how in depth you <br/>
must go with it. The kids aren&#39;t tested or anything and don&#39;t have <br/>
to be proficient at either. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;ve got a few years there to &quot;cover&quot; it. Does it say how it has to be covered?<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you yourself have a good grasp of what Algebra and Geometry are? They are mathematical solutions for figuring out real life problems. You might want to read Algebra Unplugged just for yourself. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962781576/qid=1150158708/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6308429-2149547?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962781576/qid=1150158708/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6308429-2149547?s=books&v=glance&n=283155</a> It&#39;ll take away some of the mystery. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an equivalent for Geometry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358108824">erin, <br/>
<br/>
then everyday life would cover it. you have years to<br/>
cover it. and if you think about what happens in<br/>
public schools, then saying you covered it in the 12th<br/>
grade, really wouldn&#39;t be a lie. i knew many of my<br/>
friends who saved the subjects they hated for their<br/>
senior year. not, me i didn&#39;t have one. maybe i could<br/>
say i was an unschooler, that year, instead of what i<br/>
say which is &#39;i was a bum&#39;. lol; and now you have one<br/>
less worry. :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for some reason trusting my son, to learn in his life<br/>
is easy for me. i just need help with the radical<br/>
part. but i&#39;m getting better. <br/>
