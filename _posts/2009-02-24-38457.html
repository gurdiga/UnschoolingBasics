<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051070783">Hi. I&#39;m having a doubting day and I wonder what you people would have done<br/>
in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool group is having a poetry and pizza day tomorrow. My 9 yo<br/>
daughter and I thought it was last week and got prepared for it then. She<br/>
said to me, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s write out our poems,&quot; and I (surprised that she<br/>
would suggest it) agreed. We started and then looked at the calendar and<br/>
went, &quot;Oh, no, it&#39;s next week&quot; so we put the stuff away.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today, my daughter seemed a little bored - she gets a kind of pouty puppy<br/>
look which tells me she wants something to do. I said, &quot;Shall we do<br/>
something together?&quot; and got a nod. I said, &quot;Want to play a game&quot; and got a<br/>
head shake. So then I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we get our poems ready for tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
She had an immediate burst of enthusiasm and went off to get the poetry book<br/>
she wanted to copy from. <br/>
<br/>
We got to the table and I was sitting writing out my poem. She started,<br/>
wrote about 6 words and then scribbled it out and sat looking at it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everything ok?&quot; I said?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My poem is too long. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; She said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I said, &quot;I think you probably could.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, I can&#39;t,&quot; she said. And then,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you write it out for me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m writing out my own poem,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t really want to write yours<br/>
out too. I&#39;m sure you can write it. Maybe just start with four lines or even<br/>
one line and go from there. You could do it a bit at a time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She shook her head, and then just sat there.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t have to copy it out if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; I said. &quot;But I don&#39;t<br/>
want to copy it out for you. You could go and do something different if you<br/>
want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I then continued to copy out my poem (which was long) and even got to do a<br/>
second one.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t give off happy vibes, and after two minutes went to her room, got<br/>
a different poem and started to copy that. She finished it all (actually, it<br/>
was much longer than the original one) and then I finished too. <br/>
<br/>
Later, in the evening, she happily read out her poem to me.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her a little later how she felt about the writing and she said, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like writing much and I don&#39;t have much confidence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now, having seen from her notebook that she could put a whole page of words<br/>
down (it was an old notebook from school - she quit 12 months ago) I knew<br/>
she could write. I thought it was about getting over that &#39;starting&#39; hump<br/>
that I sometimes face when I set out on a project. Has she lost confidence<br/>
because she hasn&#39;t written in so long? She has gone from being a child who<br/>
believed she had a real talent for writing stories (and she does) to being<br/>
someone who now hates writing and says she definitely doesn&#39;t want to be a<br/>
writer when she grows up - yet 8 months ago that was her dream - at least,<br/>
that&#39;s what she said.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between strewing/helping/over-functioning?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Can I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>
achieve things in life? She doesn&#39;t seem very self-motivated in a lot of<br/>
things. But having written that, she has gotten herself through every book<br/>
in the Harry Potter series - even when the words were too hard.... perhaps<br/>
I&#39;m answering my own question.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Next question: As a teen/young adult I would have said I was very very happy<br/>
with the way I was brought up and educated. It&#39;s only as I got into my 30s<br/>
that I got a lot of depression and realised my upbringing had a lot to do<br/>
with it (strict, &#39;good child&#39; type stuff). So the unschooled teenagers who<br/>
seem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me? Will they get<br/>
into their 30s and go, &quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>
have no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; Crazy question?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688593771">Hi. I&#39;m having a doubting day and I wonder what you people would have done<br/>
in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool group is having a poetry and pizza day tomorrow. My 9 yo<br/>

went, &quot;Oh, no, it&#39;s next week&quot; so we put the stuff away.<br/>
<br/>
****If we were excited and thought it was fun, we&#39;d just keep doing it, even<br/>
though it was needed until the next week.<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
We got to the table and I was sitting writing out my poem. She started,<br/>
wrote about 6 words and then scribbled it out and sat looking at it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everything ok?&quot; I said?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My poem is too long. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; She said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I said, &quot;I think you probably could.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I would have stayed with how she is feeling. I might have said, &quot;You<br/>
think you can&#39;t do it?&quot; or &quot;You are feeling frustrated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, I can&#39;t,&quot; she said. And then,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you write it out for me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I would say of course. And write it out.<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m writing out my own poem,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t really want to write yours<br/>
out too. I&#39;m sure you can write it. Maybe just start with four lines or even<br/>
one line and go from there. You could do it a bit at a time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t see how this is helpful. It seems unkind. It is also negating her<br/>
feelings without acknowledging them. She FELT like she couldn&#39;t. Sometimes<br/>
my kids need my gift of helping with something they are capable in doing.<br/>
They need me to be there for them in their time of need.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
She shook her head, and then just sat there.<br/>
<br/>
***How do you imagine she felt?<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t have to copy it out if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; I said. &quot;But I don&#39;t<br/>
want to copy it out for you. You could go and do something different if you<br/>
want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
****It seems like she needed you to help her or at least problem solve with<br/>
her. You gave her an ultimatum. You do the writing or it doesn&#39;t get done. I<br/>
don&#39;t know what she needed but likely she would have. Perhaps in another<br/>
situation in the future you could ask her.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It seems we have a problem, you don&#39;t want to write out your poem but you<br/>
want one written. I am busy writing my own and I can&#39;t help you right now.<br/>
What can we do about this?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it because you felt strongly that she had to be the one to write it?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t give off happy vibes, and after two minutes went to her room, got<br/>
a different poem and started to copy that. She finished it all (actually, it<br/>
was much longer than the original one) and then I finished too.<br/>
<br/>
***I would have stopped copying my poem to be with her through this<br/>
challenging time.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Later, in the evening, she happily read out her poem to me.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her a little later how she felt about the writing and she said, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like writing much and I don&#39;t have much confidence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
****I would have talked with her a little more about that. What is she<br/>
lacking confidence with? Is it that she lacks confidence in her creativity<br/>
or in her handwriting or something else? Does she desire to improve it? Does<br/>
she just want help with making it &quot;perfect&quot;?<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Now, having seen from her notebook that she could put a whole page of words<br/>
down (it was an old notebook from school - she quit 12 months ago)<br/>
<br/>
****She and you are still de-schooling. That takes time, a lot of time<br/>
depending on the adults ability to let go of schooling thinking.<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
 I knew she could write.<br/>
<br/>
***Yes but she asked for help. I can clean the whole house but sometimes I<br/>
want/need help.<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
 I thought it was about getting over that &#39;starting&#39; hump<br/>
that I sometimes face when I set out on a project.<br/>
<br/>
****Her challenges may be different. At 9 my dd didn&#39;t like her handwriting<br/>
but was not interested in improving it. If she felt like she would be judged<br/>
then she may have wanted me to write it neatly. As far as creativity, she<br/>
might have needed me to write out fast so that she had the space to get her<br/>
thoughts out in a flow rasther than struggle with the writing and the<br/>
thinking. If it was just copying she would have found that rather tedious<br/>
and not been interested. I would have done it for her. Not at 12 she is a<br/>
voracious writer. She writes a couple hours per day (by choice, she is<br/>
writing a novel)<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Has she lost confidence<br/>
because she hasn&#39;t written in so long?<br/>
<br/>
***Ask her. Likely she had other issues or she is still hanging on the some<br/>
school thinking.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
 She has gone from being a child who<br/>
believed she had a real talent for writing stories (and she does) to being<br/>
someone who now hates writing and says she definitely doesn&#39;t want to be a<br/>
writer when she grows up - yet 8 months ago that was her dream - at least,<br/>
that&#39;s what she said.<br/>
<br/>
***Max, my 12dd has always been a story teller and then a writer. When she<br/>
discovered that you could write stories down and have then told over and<br/>
over again (3ish) She was ready to write! Yet she didn&#39;t have the skills<br/>
yet. SO I wrote for her. I wrote for her for years. She slowly developed the<br/>
skills to do her writing herself in private. By 9 she just wasn&#39;t there. She<br/>
needed me to help her a lot still. Writing was not comfortable or easy. And<br/>
that is ok. You don&#39;t need to write everyday or be forced to write to make<br/>
it easier. Time takes care of that.<br/>
<br/>
AS far as her dreams 8 months ago, well they will change a lot at this age.<br/>
Heck I am 35 and I still change my goals a lot. I love to explore new things<br/>
and ideas frequently. I have many dreams. Some I follow and some I let go,<br/>
so do my kids. Having been unschooled their whole lives my kids have never<br/>
thought about &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up&quot; they think in terms<br/>
of &quot;I am a writer.&quot; or &quot;I write stories.&quot; They are very much living their<br/>
own lives RIGHT NOW!<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between strewing/helping/over-functioning?<br/>
<br/>
***I am not sure I get this question but heres my take. Strewing is when you<br/>
leave things that you think someone might be interested laying around. I<br/>
might find a book about deconstruction clothes and show it to my 12dd<br/>
because she my like it. Or I pick up a havndful of little toys at a ward<br/>
sake and put it in t basket for my little ones.<br/>
<br/>
If someone asks for herlp and I am able I give it to them. I don&#39;t concern<br/>
myself over whether they really need it or not. I figure if they are asking<br/>
they want it for one reason or the other. If I can help I will help them<br/>
find a way to get their needs met.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>
achieve things in life?<br/>
<br/>
***She will need you there as a loving guide. She will need your hands and<br/>
heart to help her through.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t seem very self-motivated in a lot of<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
****Is that really true? Does she have no motivation in the things that<br/>
interest her most?<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
But having written that, she has gotten herself through every book<br/>
in the Harry Potter series - even when the words were too hard.... perhaps<br/>
I&#39;m answering my own question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***It seems she was interested.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Next question: As a teen/young adult I would have said I was very very happy<br/>
with the way I was brought up and educated. It&#39;s only as I got into my 30s<br/>
that I got a lot of depression and realised my upbringing had a lot to do<br/>
with it (strict, &#39;good child&#39; type stuff). So the unschooled teenagers who<br/>
seem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me? Will they get<br/>
into their 30s and go, &quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>
have no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; Crazy question?<br/>
<br/>
****I believe there is a great new group out where you can ask the grown up<br/>
inschoolers yourself! Perhaps some one who isn&#39;t nursing can scrap up the<br/>
link. I don&#39;t think so though. It would be hard to blame your parents for<br/>
supporting and understanding you. Or for helping you find ways to met your<br/>
needs. Or for loving you and guiding you through life in a respectful way.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be really weird for anyone to wish that someone would have<br/>
oppressed them. There would be bigger issues if someone was looking for more<br/>
force.<br/>

***&quot;My poem is too long. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; She said.<br/>
She shook her head, and then just sat there.***<br/>
Cecily~<br/>
Could it have been that at that moment, what you guys were doing felt an awful lot like school?  Could you have done it outside?  at a museum or park?  at the library?  put on some music, had a cup of tea?  made the writing into an event itself?  instead of a preparation for an event?  Maybe that is where the trouble came from?<br/>
<br/>
**&quot;She didn&#39;t give off happy vibes, and after two minutes went to her room, got<br/>
a different poem and started to copy that. She finished it all (actually, it<br/>
was much longer than the original one) and then I finished too. **<br/>
Maybe do these things in her room where she feels more at home, or more inspired?<br/>
<br/>
**&quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>
have no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; **<br/>
I don&#39;t think your parents could have given you &quot;inner Motivation&quot;  it defies the concept of inner;  they could have motivated you with money, or treats, or threats of punishment, but that is external motivation, not inner motivation.  <br/>
I hope the things that you choose or choose not to do today are choices that you make for your inner self, not for your parents, or anyone else.<br/>
Your child will do the same as she gets older, give her the confidence to motivate herself (which, if she did write the poem, she must have).  It is just figuring out what motivates her.  <br/>
Also, there are several writing/poetry groups online that she could practice and get feedback on her writing.  maybe she could join one.  My kids did for a while.  Also, maybe you could have her enter some contests?  or even write a little something for the local newspaper.  Get her excited about what she can do with her talents and that will be motivation for her.<br/>
Hope this helps...good luck<br/>

<br/>
Our homeschool group is having a poetry and pizza day tomorrow. My 9 yo<br/>
daughter and I thought it was last week and got prepared for it then. She<br/>
said to me, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s write out our poems,&quot; and I (surprised that she<br/>

went, &quot;Oh, no, it&#39;s next week&quot; so we put the stuff away.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What does the calendar have to do with writing poetry?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m writing out my own poem,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t really want to write yours<br/>
out too. I&#39;m sure you can write it. Maybe just start with four lines or even<br/>
one line and go from there. You could do it a bit at a time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would have been delighted to write out my child&#39;s poem. Is it about the *writing* or about the love of poetry?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t have to copy it out if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; I said. &quot;But I don&#39;t<br/>
want to copy it out for you. You could go and do something different if you<br/>
want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I then continued to copy out my poem (which was long) and even got to do a<br/>
second one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So it was about what *you* wanted to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could have written out both. You wrote down two anyway. You just *chose* to not help her? Why? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What was your motivation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I asked her a little later how she felt about the writing and she said, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like w<br/>
riting much and I don&#39;t have much confidence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could have helped her write AND have confidence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Now, having seen from her notebook that she could put a whole page of words<br/>
down (it was an old notebook from school - she quit 12 months ago) I knew<br/>
she could write. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about whether she *could*. I think it should have been about enjoying poetry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*I* can *do* lots of things, but sometimes I want help or company while doing them. Your daughter got neither of those.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between strewing/helping/over-functioning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Strewing is setting out cool things---both physically and figuratively---that your children might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In this instance, I&#39;d say it would mean buying/borrowing lots of books on poetry, reading poetry aloud, having lots of paper and writing implements for writing your own poems, maybe learning how to bind your own books for her collection of poems, playing with haiku and iambic pentameter, rhyming, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Helping is giving assistance when your child asks. Period.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what &quot;over-functioning&quot; could possibly be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=- <br/>
<br/>
Can I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>
achieve things in life? She doesn&#39;t seem very self-motivated in a lot of<br/>
things. But having written that, she has gotten herself through every book<br/>
in the Harry Potter series - even when the words were20too hard.... perhaps<br/>
I&#39;m answering my own question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Next question: As a teen/young adult I would have said I was very very happy<br/>
with the way I was brought up and educated. It&#39;s only as I got into my 30s<br/>
that I got a lot of depression and realised my upbringing had a lot to do<br/>
with it (strict, &#39;good child&#39; type stuff). <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you have options when you were a child? Did you know whether you had options as a child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My children KNOW that they have many, many options. We try to make that very, very clear. We discuss parenting styles and learning styles. Ben and I try to be very accepting of Who They Are Now, so we can be the best parents we can be for them. We question our parenting a LOT----and ask the boys to question us too. If things aren&#39;t working as well as we&#39;d (all) like them to, we discuss what changes we can make *as a family* to make things better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling was illegal in SC when I was in school---so not an option. I was spanked regularly as a young child (until 11 or 12 for sure---maybe 13). No option. I didn&#39;t even know anyone who wasn&#39;t spanked until I was ten. THAT was eye-opening for me! So as a child, I was clueless that there was another way. But as an adult, I now resent that my parents were so &quot;tool-less&quot; as to spank me. I could resent that they didn&#39;t choose to homeschool me, but it wasn&#39;t an option, so I&#39;m cool with that. But I know how<br/>
 much more I *could* have done had I been homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So the unschooled teenagers who<br/>
seem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me? Will they get<br/>
into their 30s and go, &quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>
have no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; Crazy question?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think that inner motivation comes from having others make you do things? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand how INNER motivation actually works?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My boys have plenty of inner motivation. They may not be motivated to do things *I* want them to do, but that&#39;s not what inner motivation is about. They often do things *for* me, but it&#39;s not because I make them; it&#39;s because they *want* to do kind things for me. That&#39;s what&#39;s been modeled for them: we do things for others out of kindness/generosity/empathy, NOT obligation/duty/guilt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think you might want to explore motivation. Have you read Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, Punished by Rewards?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m a little confused - did you offer to play a game and she agreed and <br/>
then you switched it to copying out a poem? That&#39;s not playing a game.<br/>
<br/>
I would have definitely agreed to copy the poem for her. I had a little <br/>
shocked feeling when I read that you refused her request and did your <br/>
own and then another one. I&#39;d have agreed to do hers and we&#39;d have had a <br/>
warm together bit of time while I did it. My daughter would probably <br/>
have kind of snuggled up to me while I wrote. I might have said, &quot;Do you <br/>
want blue or black ink or maybe some other color? Do you want me to <br/>
write on every other line or on every line? Should I indent here? In <br/>
other words, I would have done the physical writing, but it would <br/>
probably have been a team effort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s the difference between strewing/helping/over-functioning?<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
Strewing is offering what you think she might find fun and interesting. <br/>
It can be physical things or experiences.<br/>
Helping is supporting what she is interested in. It means doing some <br/>
parts of things so that she can do the parts she wants to do. Like you <br/>
could help her participate in the poetry event by copying out the poem <br/>
she&#39;d selected.<br/>
Over-functioning? No idea what you mean by that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>
&gt; achieve things in life?<br/>
Do you have something in mind she needs to achieve? I have a feeling you <br/>
need to put more focus on now - the future will be better if now is <br/>
better. What I want my kids to achieve is to have really good <br/>
relationships. I want them to expect their relationships to be warm and <br/>
kind and generous and caring. If that&#39;s what they live with, that&#39;s what <br/>
they&#39;ll expect to live with in the future, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; She doesn&#39;t seem very self-motivated in a lot of<br/>
&gt; things. But having written that, she has gotten herself through every book<br/>
&gt; in the Harry Potter series - even when the words were too hard.... perhaps<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m answering my own question.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
Please don&#39;t even notice weaknesses. Just ignore them. You&#39;ll do her <br/>
more good. Our learning builds on what we already know - we build <br/>
strengths upon strengths. Focus on her strengths and help her do what <br/>
she wants to do and she&#39;ll learn and grow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next question: As a teen/young adult I would have said I was very very happy<br/>
&gt; with the way I was brought up and educated. It&#39;s only as I got into my 30s<br/>
&gt; that I got a lot of depression and realised my upbringing had a lot to do<br/>
&gt; with it (strict, &#39;good child&#39; type stuff). So the unschooled teenagers who<br/>
&gt; seem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me? Will they get<br/>
&gt; into their 30s and go, &quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>
&gt; have no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; Crazy question?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
Well - my three young adult children have tremendous inner motivation to <br/>
get on with their lives, so I don&#39;t think THAT is going to be what they <br/>
suddenly start saying to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If nobody is making them do things, then they are developing their inner <br/>
motivation. If someone is making them do things, then that unused inner <br/>
motivation can become a very shrunken vestigial part of themselves.<br/>

<br/>
This is another one of those cultural things that my husband and i had <br/>
to learn. In his country, yes and no both involve the head moving <br/>
vertically, not horizontally. If the chin first moves up, it is yes and <br/>
if the chin moves down, it means no.<br/>

She shook her head, and then just sat there.***<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081717659">Just wanted to throw in my experiences to complement the other great <br/>
responses you received.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, having seen from her notebook that she could put a whole page <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of words<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; down (it was an old notebook from school - she quit 12 months ago) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I knew<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she could write. I thought it was about getting over <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that &#39;starting&#39; hump<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that I sometimes face when I set out on a project. Has she lost <br/>
 </span></blockquote>confidence<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because she hasn&#39;t written in so long? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For my DS (he&#39;s 9 and has been unschooling for 2 years after 2.5 yrs <br/>
in a private school), he didn&#39;t want to do anything too schoolish <br/>
until pretty recently. Not because he &quot;lost&quot; confidence but because <br/>
he never had any. He faced a lot of judgment in school and for awhile <br/>
afterward would still feel the echos of that in what he was doing. It <br/>
was this way with art, as well. He still heard the teachers words in <br/>
his head and now that he didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do it, he avoided it. I did <br/>
the reading or writing or math for him for a long time. Now he&#39;s <br/>
comfortable doing it himself again with only occasional help from me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was unschooled in high school, although we didn&#39;t have a name for <br/>
it. My mom saw how much I disliked high school and neither one of us <br/>
saw the point in school-at-home. A lot of people just looked at me as <br/>
a high-school drop-out but my mom was very careful in telling me that <br/>
I owned my experiences and learning, that school &quot;wasn&#39;t for <br/>
everyone&quot;, that I had the choice to do whatever I wanted when I so <br/>
chose. She empowered me, she reassured me. She made me feel like more <br/>
than just a &quot;drop-out&quot;. I don&#39;t regret that for a moment. I know I <br/>
could have chosen differently. I don&#39;t regret my choice or see her as <br/>
being responsible for it.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, she raised me with conventional parenting - control, <br/>
punishments/spanking, fighting between us. Those things are the <br/>
things that hurt our relationship, the things I wish were different. <br/>
Not the trust, the support, the empowerment. I&#39;ll never regret those. <br/>
They were the highlight of my childhood. :)<br/>
