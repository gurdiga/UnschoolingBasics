The idea of a super-hero kid, she thinks the show is funny, role-reversal, acquiring information about the &quot;law&quot; and &quot;jail&quot;, and my husband and I also find the show funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156607615">My just turned 5 year old daughter really loves Avatar The Last <br/>
Airbender because of Katara a waterbending girl.<br/>
I actually also now love the show. Katara is a warrior and fights with her <br/>
waterbending powers together with her brother and Aang,<br/>
the last airbender kid. Very into oriental philosophy with Ying-Yang, <br/>
meditation, the balance of  Water, Air, Earth and Fire.<br/>
 Other super heroes girls are in Barbie movie like Barbie and the 3 Musketeers.<br/>
Oh and my daughter just discovered Sailor Moon ( a japanese cartoon where the <br/>
girls Sailor Moon and Mini Sailor Moon are great)<br/>
OH OH OH and I forgot the series on the HUB channel ( was Discovery Kids)  based <br/>
on the book series written by Emily Roda called Deltora&#39;s Quest.<br/>
There is Jazmin who is a girl who grew up in the Forest of Silence and helps <br/>
Lief  find the 7 gems of the Deltora&#39;s Belt and thus run of the evil Shadow Lord <br/>
out <br/>
<br/>
of Deltora. She is a very powerful girl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214379411">My kids all love Word World I think its called. They get a kick out of<br/>
everything being made out of the letters. So for instance the sheep is<br/>
actually the letters s-h-e-e-p put together to look like the animal. All 3<br/>
of my kids like the show and they are ages 11, 5 and 3. It would be too<br/>
young &quot;educationally&quot; for my 11 y.o. but she&#39;s not watching it for an<br/>
education ;)  I think what they also like is that like some of the other<br/>
shows it&#39;s interactive, so the kids really feel like they need to help. Ok,<br/>
that&#39;s my two cents :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447142265">The PBS show Cyberchase is on Netflix stream, my family LOVED that show and cried when PBS took it off. They played all the cyberchase games on the pbs website and we got two computer games from Amazon too, Carnival of Chaos and can&#39;t remember the other one. THe show is smart and funny, The Hacker bad guy is absurd, and the kids love Digit the wise guy bird that hangs out with the kids.<br/>
