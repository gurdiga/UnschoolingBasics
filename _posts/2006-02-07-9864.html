<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264378871">Hi all, <br/>
I am currently unschooling my 3 children (7, 5 & 2).  I am <br/>
investigating possible sources of income that would allow me to <br/>
continue to home school.  <br/>
I had an idea about starting a business that would facilitate home <br/>
schooling for parents that aren&#39;t able to home school themselves.  I <br/>
would offer my home as a safe place to send their children while <br/>
they worked.  This may sound crazy, however, I know a few families <br/>
that have struggled with the idea of having to send their children <br/>
back to school.  I could offer a safe alternative.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I would offer a rich & supportive learning environment.  <br/>
I would not be responsible for home schooling their children <br/>
though.  Parents would ultimately be responsible for that (i.e., I <br/>
would not be teaching a child via a curriculum or keep track of <br/>
attendance.  If a parent used a curriculum they would be responsible <br/>
for educating their child during their off hours. Any comments or <br/>
advice. <br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Sandra</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713059850">If you lived in Southern California I might have your first client  <br/>
for you. I know someone who has been doing this - sending her kids to  <br/>
someone else (they are ALL unschoolers) while she works from 8 am to  <br/>
2:30 pm daily. But the caretaking family is moving away - and she&#39;s  <br/>
not been able to find anybody else, so far<br/>
<br/>
So - yeah - definitely a possibility that you could find someone like  <br/>
that where you live, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975015129">I think that&#39;s a wonderful idea.  You might start with making your services<br/>
available through your local home school groups and co-ops.<br/>
