It airs in Chicago between 7am-11am, so that would be 8a-12pm Eastern<br/>
time.  He said they&#39;d call me between 8a-10:30 Eastern time, so that<br/>
would be 7a-9:30a Central. <br/>
<br/>
If you can record it Alyssa, I&#39;d be most grateful. I don&#39;t know<br/>
whether it&#39;s available after the show or not and I&#39;d love to have it.<br/>
Hopefully I don&#39;t embarrass myself or get shredded!!:)<br/>
