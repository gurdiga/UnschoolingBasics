<div id="ygrps-yiv-153051787">We&#39;ve been slowly giving our daughters (7 & 10) more and more control <br/>
over their choices. We started with eating, then playstation and then <br/>
using the computer thats used for software (we have two, one has <br/>
internet, one is for software). They love going online and I&#39;ve found <br/>
some really cool sites that they love to visit. <br/>
<br/>
How do you handle internet access? Are your children able to surf <br/>
the &#39;net freely? Do you check out the sites they visit before they go <br/>
on? <br/>
<br/>
Also...what are their favorite sites? I&#39;d love to have a few more to <br/>
show them. I started a floppy disk for each of them and they enjoy <br/>
looking at it to see what new sites I added for them. :-)<br/>
Some of their interests are horses, barbie, disney, fairies, harry <br/>
potter, coloring pages, reading, art, writing, jokes, animals...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions you can give!<br/>

different uses. I firmly believe the computer needs to<br/>
be in a public place, but my kids don&#39;t have TV&#39;s in<br/>
their room either.  We have never restricted their<br/>
access with any kind of &quot;NetNanny&quot; type program or<br/>
prescreening but have always warned them about going<br/>
to places that were not appropriate and what to do if<br/>
they should land somewhere they felt they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be. Just make sure your virus software is up to date<br/>
because some of those kid places (gamespy comes to<br/>
mind) are hotbeds for junk. I also love using Mozilla<br/>
because I find the pop up ads on IE reprehensible. You<br/>
can check the history on your browser, I do<br/>
periodically and the kids know it. My ten yr old will<br/>
still ask me sometimes to help her find something but<br/>
my son now leave windows open for me to look at, I<br/>
used to do that for him (still do).  Oh, and if they<br/>
want to sign up for something they have to ask first<br/>
and they know to never give ANYONE their name or<br/>
location. My son even created a persona I let him use<br/>
when sites require info. The Internet is the whole<br/>
world at their fingertips!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DS is 7 and he has always had free access (as much as was possible <br/>
back when we had one computer, now we&#39;ve got 4, on a wireless network <br/>
so they all have Internet access). We put his favorite sites right up <br/>
front when he opens his browser. He knows that it is possible to surf <br/>
and he&#39;s seen us do it - he just has no interest in roaming the Web at <br/>
this point - partly, I think, because he doesn&#39;t see a need to, since <br/>
he has access to the things he wants and free range to find more with <br/>
our help if he wants it - and we proactively find things for him to <br/>
check out (as you are doing). Plus, surfing does require a bit of <br/>
spelling and he just has little interest in that at this point. One <br/>
time he was on a site that also had a pay-to-play section. He clicked <br/>
on the icon and it popped up a message that he needed to get his <br/>
parents for this. So he came and got me (obviously, since he couldn&#39;t <br/>
go forward). I read it and we discussed it - what it was, how much it <br/>
cost (I related the cost per month to number of Happy Meals so he <br/>
could grasp it - he was maybe 4 or 5 at the time), and he decided he&#39;d <br/>
rather not spend the money for it.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say for sure what he really likes now - he&#39;s more into network <br/>
gaming with DH (Age of Empires and StarCraft) than Internet gaming <br/>
right now. He did like neopets for quite a while and goes back to it <br/>
every now and again (I&#39;ve got a neopet also and I&#39;ll pop in and feed <br/>
both pets regularly so they don&#39;t &#39;starve&#39;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877472306">Thanks for the good tips. We have pop up blocker which is so great, <br/>
I have no idea how we got along without it. LOL <br/>
I&#39;m looking foward to giving them more and more control over the <br/>
internet. I wish the &#39;net was available when I was a kid! LOL<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t have any interaction with people online yet but I&#39;m sure <br/>
that will come soon. They love visiting their favorite sites and I <br/>
love finding sites for them. :-)<br/>

The timer is flexible, but the computer is not his, he&#39;s not the only one  to <br/>
use it. He knows when he has X-amount of time, and that in that time, he can  <br/>
do as he wishes. He doesn&#39;t mind the timer, it&#39;s better than a complete <br/>
meltdown  when someone else needs to use it. He has issues we&#39;re struggling with <br/>
(partly  why we choose to homeschool) and time is a very important thing with <br/>
him. He  needs limits, and gets all bent out of shape if there aren&#39;t any. We <br/>
went  camping for 2 weeks this summer and boy, was it ever difficult with him. <br/>
It was  a challenge for him. We are working with his counseler in dealing with <br/>
his  obsessive qualities and it&#39;s been a long road. So, for now, the timer on <br/>
the  computer stays for HIS benefit at the moment. That&#39;s what makes him <br/>
happy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031956013">My oldest two children are 15 and 13 -- and they<br/>
started having an interest in using the computer<br/>
regularly since they were about age 10.  We have no<br/>
computer limits, and never have.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t check up on my children and often times, they<br/>
are on the computer when I am not at home or I am<br/>
asleep.  We also don&#39;t have &quot;net nanny&quot; or any of the<br/>
other parental controls on our computer.  One time our<br/>
son happened upon a porn site and it was no big deal. <br/>
He was like &quot;whoa!&quot;, told us, we talked about it a bit<br/>
(I showed him how sometimes searching for something<br/>
something non-sexual can turn up porn), but its really<br/>
no big deal in our home.  <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t have site recommendation since what my<br/>
older two kids like and visit is likely to not be of<br/>
interest to your children.  I know that ds used to<br/>
loved neopets -- still kind of does.  My 4 year old<br/>
loves to play the games on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.noggin.com">http://www.noggin.com</a> but<br/>
that might be a bit young for yours.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a good idea to keep suggesting/finding<br/>
sites for them (.  You can also always keep handy<br/>
links to search engines for kids like<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahooligans.com">http://www.yahooligans.com</a> so they can learn to search<br/>
for things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622825724">We use Firefox and Netscape browsers and set up profiles for each <br/>
family member (and the neighborhood kids who visit regularly and <br/>
whose parents give the OK  :-D ) and set individual start pages with <br/>
picture links to our younger kids favorite sites.  (My 17 year old <br/>
thought it was cool and set up her own as well.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just simple html (we name each person&#39;s with their own name, ie: <br/>
 zack.html) in a specific folder on the C drive.  Then you go to <br/>
preferences and set your start page to that file.  VERY simple and <br/>
VERY effective.  (I love profiles!  We each have our own bookmarks, <br/>
too, because of having them.  I have a HUGE file and everyone else <br/>
innthe family has a smaller one, so it saves them having to go <br/>
through my stuff to get to their own.  :-} )<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t specifically sit there and monitor every second that they <br/>
are on but we have all of the computers in the front room (except my <br/>
daughter&#39;s - we recently ran a line to her room and she sometimes <br/>
goes online in her room and sometimes in the front room) so it&#39;s <br/>
easily seen by everyone in the room.  (They often bounce back and <br/>
forth between each other&#39;s computers checking out what they are each <br/>
on.)  They love playing games with each other and really love those <br/>
interactive sites where you create a play a character and interact <br/>
with other characters - we&#39;ve recently discovered Disney&#39;s Virtual <br/>
Magic Kingdom ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vmk.disney.go.com">http://vmk.disney.go.com</a> ) and the older kids like <br/>
MapleStory (do NOT let younger kids onn this one - the content is OK <br/>
but many of the players are not very nice.  (The Disney one has a <br/>
limited allowable vocabulary and is policed for appropriate <br/>
behavior.)  There is another one that I wanted to have them try <br/>
because it was recommended a while ago by homeschoolers (before they <br/>
got interested in these kind of games) as a safe and fun game but I <br/>
had it bookmarked on my old laptop (which blew it&#39;s motherboard) <br/>
where I can&#39;t currently access it.  :-{<br/>
<br/>
My youngest (7) always asks about new sites - he memorizes sites in <br/>
TV ads and magazines and asks if he can go see them.  Then look at it <br/>
with him (or the 17 year old does  :-} ).  If it&#39;s one he likes we <br/>
add it to his start page.  When he just wants to look specific things <br/>
up one of us will searh with him.  He likes using Yahooligans.<br/>
<br/>
The older ones (12 and 17) pretty much surf as they wish.  We&#39;ve <br/>
never had a problem with any of the kids winding up on a &quot;bad&quot; page.  <br/>
Guess we&#39;ve been lucky . . .   :-}  <br/>
<br/>
Neopets ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.neopets.com">http://www.neopets.com</a> ) is a good site (our whole family <br/>
does this one).  You &quot;adopt&quot; pets (all fictional animals - for <br/>
instance, one of mine is a Grrral - basically a Tyranosaurau Rex.    <br/>
:-D   You can feed them, play games for Neopoints (&quot;money&quot;), can have <br/>
a bank account, can buy and sell stocks, can own a shop and buy from <br/>
others&#39; shops, and so much more.  (Just check it out.  :-} )<br/>
<br/>
Power Pets ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.powerpets.com">http://www.powerpets.com</a> ) which teaches about caring <br/>
for animals as well as being fun - you &quot;adopt&quot; pets but they are <br/>
&quot;real&quot; animals (not created for the game like on Neopets) like dogs <br/>
and foxes and owls and many more.  You can play games (not as many as <br/>
on Neopets but they are slowly growing) for power points (&quot;money&quot;), <br/>
have a bank account, you can have your own shops and buy from other <br/>
people&#39;s shops, you can join neighborhoods, you can publish books <br/>
(well, you submit them for publication) that you and other players <br/>
can then read, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
Millsberry ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.millsberry.com">http://www.millsberry.com</a> ) is a little bit different.  <br/>
You create a character (human) and play as that character but it&#39;s <br/>
not interactive/live action like Disney VMK or MapleStory.  You can <br/>
play games for &quot;money&quot; (as well as building other characteristics but <br/>
I can&#39;t remember the names of them just now), have a bank account, go <br/>
to school, read books, buy costumes and clothes for your character, <br/>
choose a neighborhood and &quot;build&quot; a house (you start with three rooms <br/>
but can now add to that), create music mixes and more.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot at Disney, including a nice little game/quiz about <br/>
online safety.  I cant remember the exact URL - something like <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://go.disney.com">http://go.disney.com</a>  .<br/>
<br/>
My grandson loves NickJr.com ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nickjr.com">http://nickjr.com</a> ) and Sesame Street <br/>
(I think it&#39;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sesamestreet.com">http://sesamestreet.com</a> but I&#39;m not sure).<br/>
<br/>
I know there are others but that&#39;s all I can think of at the moment.<br/>

Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! Your post was very <br/>
informative to me and I really appreciate it. <br/>
My girls will LOVE that Disney interactive game! (I checked it out, <br/>
it looks like fun! I think I may play for a while before I have to <br/>
share with them! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it amazing how the kids today are so comfortable with a <br/>

We have no<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t check up on my children and often times, they<br/>
are on the computer when I am not at home or I am<br/>
asleep.  We also don&#39;t have &quot;net nanny&quot; or any of the<br/>
other parental controls on our computer.  One time our<br/>
son happened upon a porn site and it was no big deal. <br/>
He was like &quot;whoa!&quot;, told us, we talked about it a bit<br/>
(I showed him how sometimes searching for something<br/>
something non-sexual can turn up porn), but its really<br/>
no big deal in our home.</div>

they are ADDICTIVE!!!!   It&#39;s really fun, though, when I have my two <br/>

daughter on her computer in her room - all playing the same game with <br/>
each other!   The age range is 7 to 17 - all having a blast.<br/>
<br/>
And my daughter&#39;s best friend (in Texas - we&#39;re in Alabama) will <br/>
usually get on at the same time and play, too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just so cool to me.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning on getting webcams for all of the computers (we have <br/>
one) for Christmas - family conferences would be so cool!  Four <br/>
computers here, my brother five miles away, my sister nearly 500 <br/>
miles away and my aunt nearly 900 miles away . . . my usins kids in <br/>
Texas and my kids in Alabama . . .<br/>
<br/>
I get so carried away . . .   we&#39;re SUCH a computer addicted family!  <br/>
Our kids get on as soon as they can sit up - we even have baby games <br/>
(press any key and get a random picture and sound) so we start &#39;em <br/>
early.  :-}<br/>

realized what he was seeing?<br/>
<br/>
How we react can change how they view an experience.<br/>
<br/>
Was he upset or confused? If he was upset, why was he upset?<br/>
<br/>
Even if there are parental controls, they can&#39;t filter out  <br/>
everything. How will you react, how will you help him get what he  <br/>
wants when something he doesn&#39;t want slips through?<br/>
<br/>
A gasp of horror will color the experience differently than a laugh  <br/>
and &quot;Oh, that certainly isn&#39;t what you were trying to find. Let&#39;s try  <br/>
to get you where you wanted to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Give him the skills to get rid of stuff he doesn&#39;t want to see by  <br/>
clicking the close box and make sure he&#39;s confident that he can  <br/>
always come to you for comfort. If he sees something upsetting and he  <br/>
knows if he tells you it&#39;s going to upset you he&#39;s less likely to  <br/>
tell you. Be calm :-) Be useful to him :-)<br/>

I have done that as well... sometimes it&#39;s as simple as .com, .gov, .net,  <br/>
.org that can bring up an unwanted site. Imagine my horror when my mother and a  <br/>

I have to say, this is a wonderful thing... My brother was over in Iraq in  <br/>
2003-2004, and near the end of his time, when things calmed down a LITTLE over  <br/>
there and the Army was more established, they had webcams for the soldiers. <br/>
The  most wonderful experience was, he got to &quot;spend&quot; Christmas Eve with us. <br/>
And when  there were things going on over there, he is with the 101st Airborne, <br/>
and we be  on pins and needles with worry, he&#39;d email and say he&#39;d be on at <br/>
X-time and we  could see him. Such a relief it was. He introduced us to some of <br/>
his buddies  too. We&#39;d all be in conference chat (my aunt and uncle, my <br/>
parents, us,  sometimes my grandmother).<br/>
Great way to stay connected.<br/>

I think it depends on the child.  If he or she is sensitive to these  types <br/>
of things then you might need to help him/her avoid them.  To me it  is no <br/>
different than me not taking my easily scared children to the library  Halloween <br/>
party.<br/>
 <br/>
The thing is to discuss it.  You might say that there are ways to  prevent <br/>
bringing up unwanted sites but it will block some he might want to  see.  Work <br/>
together.<br/>
 <br/>
When my kids wanted to see the Penguin movie, I said &quot;I hear there are  scary <br/>
parts.  My idea is to wait until it is on DVD so we can fast forward  through <br/>
them.  What do you think?&quot;  They cheerfully agreed.<br/>
 <br/>
A child that has a trusting relationship will know you are looking out for  <br/>
*his* sensitivities and won&#39;t regard it as censorship or control.    But these <br/>
sites can also lead to good discussions.  I would consider the  child&#39;s needs <br/>
and maturity levels and if you are going to be right there to talk  about it <br/>
or not.<br/>

website for a zoo (I think it was the San Diego zoo)<br/>
on a computer with parental controls set.  I was<br/>
denied access to the site -- apparently it was not an<br/>
approved site.  <br/>

&gt; I have a  girlfriend that works for a company that<br/>
&gt; is contracted by the   <br/>
&gt; government.  They regularly get info off of sites<br/>
&gt; like   whitehouse.gov.  Of <br/>
&gt; course, <br/>
&gt; the dotcom version is porn.  She  said  about once a<br/>
&gt; month in her modern <br/>
&gt; cubicle office space, someone  goes  &quot;AAAAAAHHHHHH&quot;<br/>
&gt; and the whole office says <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; unison &quot;dot  GOV!!!!  dot  GOV!!!!&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I work in a library and while trying to pull up the<br/>
whitehouse site for a patron, I made the exact same<br/>
mistake.  I commented that perhaps I should google it,<br/>
instead ;)  <br/>
