<div id="ygrps-yiv-614035920">I just wanted to share our experience at dinner yeasetday.  My son, <br/>
11, daughter, 2 and myself went out for pizza last night.  The pizza <br/>
place we go to has recently added some wooden Tic Tac Toe boards to <br/>
its things for children to do while they wait, and Uriah pickied up a <br/>
board and pieces to play with.  <br/>
<br/>
Though we did play one short game (he and I ALWAYS tie), he and the <br/>
baby managed to spend the entire time we were there (nearly an hour) <br/>
playing with the game--stacking the pieces in various, and ever more <br/>
complicated ways.  Creating little games to play together and with <br/>
her doll, making pyramids, rolling the O&#39;s, trying to roll the Xs.  <br/>
It was amazing to me to see all the different things they could think <br/>
to do at their seat with that piece of wood and nine wooden Xs & Os.<br/>
<br/>
I said to Uriah, &quot;now this is the difference between an unschooled <br/>
child and a public schooled child--the public schooled child would <br/>
only know to play the actual game with these pieces, and you two have <br/>
entertained yourselves this whole time with them--while not even <br/>
playing the game!&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-612972813">Laura.  We get a lot more mileage from games by not playing the intended<br/>
games or making up our own rules.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to play a video game and be competitive with yourself and<br/>
quite another to lose a board game when you&#39;ve played your best.  Especially<br/>
at 4.  A little embarrassing maybe.  I love to find ways (and it&#39;s a<br/>
challenge) to play so that everyone wins.<br/>
<br/>
Like with Connect4 ...  how many rows can *we* make?  I can do a little<br/>
math, I thought, and find out.  Yet the actual turnout was more than I had<br/>
figured on.  If you can count each piece more than once, there&#39;s lots more<br/>
rows you can make.  Now what kind of picture does it make?  Ds loved that<br/>
idea too and laughed because he says it&#39;s silly.<br/>
<br/>
I bought several much cheaper versions of board games at $5 a piece.  They<br/>
were at a place called Family Dollar and were these neat little travel<br/>
compact versions.  Ds loves these little games.  I&#39;ve noticed he likes<br/>
miniatures.<br/>
