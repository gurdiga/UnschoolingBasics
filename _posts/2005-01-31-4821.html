I sympathize with Debbie and appreciate all the great advice people <br/>
gave her! I&#39;m trying to let go of college worries and worries about the <br/>
new asst. superintendent&#39;s expectations in order to do what we really <br/>
want. My 14-yr-old daughter believes she wants to be a children&#39;s <br/>
librarian, which requires college and an MA in library science. She&#39;s <br/>
addicted to books and organizing book shelves, etc...it&#39;s lovely to <br/>
see. She also hasn&#39;t imagined herself doing anything else for a long <br/>
time. I&#39;d like to make sure this will be possible for her, but I&#39;d also <br/>
like not to have to answer to anyone else&#39;s requirements. If I can get <br/>
past my town&#39;s issues (which are somewhat unknown because he&#39;s new and <br/>
I&#39;m loosening up simultaneously),  the community college path sounds <br/>
like a natural for her eventually.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a different question I want to raise... Several times I&#39;ve seen <br/>
people talking about if you supply a rich environment, your kids will <br/>
naturally learn all sorts of stuff from what you&#39;re doing, etc. I found <br/>
that true when our kids were younger -- rich was easy, because <br/>
everything was new to them.<br/>
<br/>
But, what if your environment is rich, say, in people analysis and <br/>
literature, but you&#39;re basically a stay-at-home, bookish, craftish kind <br/>
of family? What if you&#39;re not always out going to this and that museum, <br/>
cultural events, exploring all over the place? We did more of that when <br/>
the kids were younger, but my personal interests have gotten more <br/>
aesthetic and my husband&#39;s have only gotten more literary, and the kids <br/>
aren&#39;t interested in sharing in what we&#39;re involved with that much. <br/>
They have their own stuff going -- reading, Model United Nations, <br/>
library volunteer work for the eldest; writing, SIMS, fashion design <br/>
for the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
These are great interests and they do pursue them. But I still feel <br/>
kind of deficient on the &quot;rich environment&quot; part of things... we&#39;re <br/>
just not very broad-based, nor do we go that deep into anything either! <br/>
At the same time I worry about it, this is still very much our family <br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very interested in others&#39; perspectives on this and will try not to <br/>
be oversensitive!<br/>

I wonder this too.  I get too stressed out when I try to take all of <br/>
the kids somewhere too often because of their young ages. (six kids <br/>
ages 11 on down to 20 months) but we do what we can.  So often I <br/>
wonder if our environment is &quot;rich&quot; enough also.  <br/>

<br/>
I was reading this post waiting for the problem to be revealed.(g)<br/>
<br/>
I guess the problem is that you are worrying. I&#39;m interpreting the &quot;we&quot; in<br/>
&quot;nor do we go that deep&quot; as meaning your dh and yourself at home. Are you<br/>
happy and contented in your interests? <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your kids are pursuing a range of cool interests, some of<br/>
which take them out of the house (or maybe online). They must remember that<br/>
these other places of cultural enrichment exist because you used to go to<br/>
them. If their interests are the library and fashion design, respectively,<br/>
they are ideally placed to hear about current events that they may wish to<br/>
attend. I&#39;m finding it hard to visualize them as problematically isolated. <br/>
<br/>
Would they be likely to say to you, &quot;Gee I wish we still went to ... more<br/>
often&quot;, or would they respond to you sometimes saying, &quot;Do you want to go to<br/>
that museum we used to like any time?&quot; Of course a traveling exhibition of<br/>
clothing history or library architecture/history might have them champing at<br/>
the bit to go. I would think that talking to them about their stuff would be<br/>
the best way to discover the next connection.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about Unschooling is that the results look different<br/>
in every family. It allows different family cultures (nice phrase), as long<br/>
as they are meeting the needs of the members, to flourish, rather than be<br/>
undermined by the &quot;shoulds&quot; of school or mainstream culture. However that<br/>
very family uniqueness sometimes means parents worry that something might be<br/>
inadequate or underrepresented. I would suggest looking closely at your<br/>
kids. Are they happy and contented and engaged and curious?<br/>
<br/>
I know in our family dh and I have a tendency towards being sedentary, and I<br/>
have to push myself to be more social. We were talking it over and realized<br/>
that the physical activity area is one that our modeling is lacking for Jayn<br/>
- at least in the winter; in summer we swim in the pool every day. I<br/>
realized that Jayn finds all sorts of ways to be very physically active<br/>
every day, indoors and out, including suddenly saying &quot;Let&#39;s do some yoga&quot;.<br/>
She is modeling healthy activities for us instead! <br/>
<br/>
Today Jayn asked that Daddy be the one to take her to her regular dance<br/>
class and park event afterwards. I am using the time to do some emailing and<br/>
other stuff, but it sure is odd to be suddenly &quot;free&quot; for what will be<br/>
several hours, rather than just one or two.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540454929">Julia, I wanted to mention before when I read about<br/>
your daughter, but I didn&#39;t get around to it.  I have<br/>
worked for 4 different library systems as reference<br/>
librarian, children&#39;s librarian, and other library<br/>
work...and I don&#39;t have a MLS.  I do have a bachelors<br/>
in English, but I know that in small libraries no<br/>
degree is necessary.  My SIL was head librarian for a<br/>
small rural library as well, and she had only a high<br/>
school diploma.....<br/>

Julia.<br/>
Of course you&#39;re getting this perspective from a person who<br/>
considers herself to be &quot;bookish&quot;  as well, so let me be upfront about<br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
There are many good science presentations and documentaries on dvd and <br/>
video.<br/>
Maybe this could add part of that dimension that you sometimes worry is <br/>
missing.<br/>
Also, games.  We like the art games, but there are lots to  choose <br/>
from.  Why force<br/>
yourself to go out and about?  It&#39;s cold out there!<br/>

Maybe she can volunteer at your library.  If she loves it now there&#39;s no<br/>
reason for her to wait.  Go talk to your librarian and see if they can<br/>
use some help.  Find out if your library has a &quot;Friends of the Library&quot;<br/>
group.  If the library doesn&#39;t need a volunteer she could join the<br/>
friends and help decide about community programs and such.  If your<br/>
library doesn&#39;t have a &quot;Friends&quot; group your daughter could start one.  <br/>
