Unschoolers are particularly well-suited to facilitate this kind of<br/>

<br/>
Yes....and I think 11 is too young to worry about college requirements<br/>
unless she actually wants them. I know that when I had a serious<br/>
interest in Marine biology, and everyone told me all the math I<br/>
needed, I dropped that dream like a hot potato.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting until college is actually an issue, is ok. If someone has to<br/>
take a couple remedial math or english courses, big deal. In the mean<br/>
time, letting her hang out with people that have a passion for the<br/>
same itnerests, volunteering etc... as Danielle suggested, are ways<br/>
for her to not only explore her interests, but find out just how far<br/>
she wants to take it.<br/>
<br/>
What is an interest today, may not turn into a career, or it might.<br/>
Either way, keeping busy with the things you love is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has an intense interest in computers and technology. We had a<br/>
fellow unschooling Dad hang out at our house a few times and show him<br/>
parts, programming etc.. and Trevor ended up building his own computer<br/>
out of freebie parts.<br/>
Jay also took him to work a couple times and had him help run<br/>
networking wires and simple stuff that helped him learn all sorts of<br/>
interesting things. Very cool.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll do something in the field of technology one day,<br/>
in the meantime he games and reads and surgs the net mostly.:)<br/>
<br/>
Trevor is 16. When/if college is looming in the near future, we&#39;ll<br/>
help him deal with tests and requirements at that point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073724683">Thanks, Ren, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve shared your experience. I didn&#39;t<br/>
think about the fact that I could potentially turn her off to a life<br/>
choice by giving her &quot;too much information!&quot; (That&#39;s probably rooted<br/>
in MY desire to know EVERYTHING- that little controlling part of me!)<br/>
<br/>
I truly am enjoying her blossoming interests and talents- she is a joy<br/>
to be around! If she chooses a path that requires college, we have a<br/>
community college 5 minutes up the road. I&#39;ll be happy as long as she<br/>
is happy. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES - another reason to keep quiet about it. An 11 year old is very  <br/>
unlikely to be ready to know all the requirements and it could be  <br/>
really discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
Support current interests. Childhood is not about preparation for  <br/>
adulthood it is REAL LIFE right now. Treat it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily - supporting real life interests right now and providing for  <br/>
a happy, rich, stimulating, supported interest-filled life, IS the  <br/>
best way to prepare for the future because the characteristics that  <br/>
are important for future success are: stamina, positive outlook,  <br/>
confidence, enthusiasm, and JOY of living and learning. The academics  <br/>
can ALWAYS be learned and amazingly quickly when the motivation is  <br/>
there. But if a child grows up discouraged, believing learning is  <br/>
&quot;hard,&quot; pessimistic or even cynical, that&#39;s hard to overcome.<br/>

Most people in today&#39;s world are going to need the ability to adapt,<br/>
to be creative and make money in a variety of careers...I think<br/>
unschoolers are well suited for this adaptability!  The thinking that<br/>
I needed to choose A SINGLE career path really inhibited me in many ways.<br/>
I still don&#39;t know what I want to be when I grow up (ooh, yuck..do I<br/>
even have to grow up?) and I LIKE that about me.<br/>

 <br/>
True.  I know very few people, all traditionally schooled and groomed  for a <br/>
&quot;career&quot;, that have stuck with one type of career, much less a  job. <br/>
 <br/>
And while we are on this topic, something David Albert says that struck a  <br/>
chord with me, you don&#39;t have to be good at something to choose to do it, hobby  <br/>
or career.  That was an eye-opener for me.  I had pretty much based my  whole <br/>
life on &quot;good enough to do XXX.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Benefit of having kids (and unschooling!) is I never HAVE to grow up... I  <br/>
love doing &quot;kid&quot; things on a whim... My kids just handed me a paper and wanted  <br/>
me to draw a &quot;house&quot;. So, I drew a house. And they said it needed curtains in  <br/>
the windows. So, I drew curtains. A nice door. Flowers. Our van (mind you, I  <br/>
draw stick figures LOL). We added gardens. Daddy was mowing the lawn, Danny <br/>
was  walking the puppy, Kelsey was playing ball and Evelyn was &quot;finding her <br/>
teddy  bear&quot;. And Mommy? They decided I should be reading a book. In a hammock. <br/>
LOL!  Love it! Oh, and all our cats were in the windows, including the one we <br/>
lost in  2004. Our little masterpiece.  <br/>

touch at one point and that&#39;s it) but I have been in the same general <br/>
field (minus 2 years when DS was gestating and infant) since 1990. It <br/>
encompasses several companies but pretty much the same tasks/job - <br/>
software testing and support. I get to be a professional &#39;picky <br/>
person&#39; LOL<br/>
