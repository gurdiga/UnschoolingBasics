<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672175388">We have been pretty much unschooling all foods- very occasionally I limit, but its something <br/>
Im still working on. So for the most part DS (20 months) doesnt differentiate between <br/>
&#39;healthy&#39; foods and other stuff. So he might want a banana a lot more than a cookie because <br/>
he doesnt see one as better than the other. The thing I am struggling with is chocolate, <br/>
because all of the times I have let him have as much as he wants he has vomited each time. <br/>
He hasnt eaten very much (by my standards ;)). Something about the texture I think, it sticks <br/>
in the back of his throat. <br/>
<br/>
So what do I do? <br/>
Its very hard for me to give him something (especially at his age when he doesnt really see <br/>
cause and effect) that I know will likely make him sick. I also dont want to make chocolate <br/>
something that is a battle or is seen as something I dont want him to have- because I love <br/>
chocolate and want him to enjoy it too. Any advice?........</div>

At 20mos, the big autonomy issues around food have to do with ease of <br/>
access. 2yos like to be able to get what they want easily. But they <br/>
don&#39;t have the grand awareness that even 4yos have - its still <br/>
possible to make other fun options easily available without there <br/>
being a sense of Limiting from the child&#39;s perspective. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d rarely offer chocolate and keep yours on higher or closed <br/>
shelves, so its not an issue. Maybe experiment with tiny amounts - <br/>
chocolate spread on a cracker, for example, rather than a brownie. Or <br/>
a little bit of chocolate sauce in some milk. <br/>

Or maybe try Nutella---chocolate flavor without all that much chocolate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005312746">As far as chocolate, has it all been the same &#39;kind&#39;? For instance, has<br/>
it always been milk chocolate like standard Hershey bars and such? Could<br/>
it be that an ingredient in what he had was the problem (could be cocoa,<br/>
but it also could be milk, HFCS, coloring, etc)? If he has a cookie made<br/>
with semi-sweet bits, does it cause the same problem as a cookie made<br/>
with milk chocolate bits? That sort of thing. Look carefully into the<br/>
ingredients and see if perhaps there&#39;s a connection there to other<br/>
foods/ingredients.<br/>
