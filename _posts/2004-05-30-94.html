<div id="ygrps-yiv-939040110">Congratulations to Ren and Kelly on their new and fast growing list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Deb Lewis from Deer Lodge, Montana.  That&#39;s in sw Montana on I-90<br/>
between Butte and Missoula if anyone&#39;s ever passing through this way and<br/>
would like to stop and bounce on the trampoline for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I live with my son Dylan, who is twelve now and my husband David who is<br/>
creeping up on forty five.  I&#39;m forty one.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has never been to school.  Once, when David and I decided we should<br/>
consider what would happen to Dylan if we died, I said we&#39;d have to be<br/>
sure he was with someone who wouldn&#39;t make him go to school.   David said<br/>
not to worry, there was no one on earth could make Dylan go to school.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan loves animals, insects, the comics page in the newspaper, politics,<br/>
Godzilla movies, hiking, camping rock and fossil hunting, story telling,<br/>
popcorn, telling terrible jokes, and playing chess.   He has long hair<br/>
always wears sweats, walks through every puddle and climbs over every<br/>
rock and tree stump and we just found out he has psoriasis. = (  bummer. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s pretty sure he&#39;ll live in a motor home and travel and write novels<br/>
and comic books and make movies and work as an equipment operator at some<br/>
point in his very busy sounding future. &lt;g&gt;   I wouldn&#39;t be a bit<br/>
surprised. <br/>
<br/>
Happy unschooling, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
