 </span></blockquote>Is she truly regressing or is she acting her natural age for someone<br/>
who isn&#39;t forced into growing up so fast?  :)  This is probably her<br/>
way of deschooling - going back to a place where she remembers being<br/>
accepted for who she was rather than what she was doing.  She can be a<br/>
kid again.  She can ask for assistance.  She can play &quot;baby games&quot;<br/>
again.  She can abandon that grown up kindergardener in favor of her<br/>
&quot;childish youth.&quot;  I would see this more as healing than regressing.<br/>
Even the short amount of time that she was in school can leave an<br/>
impact on who she feels she is!<br/>
<br/>
About Girl Scouts:  Be aware that  Girl Scouts aren&#39;t always<br/>
unschooling friendly.  I was a Girl Scout my entire life and while I<br/>
loved souts, I found that my daughters didn&#39;t.  While they enjoyed<br/>
being with other girls, the structure of scouting and the drive to<br/>
finish badges and earn awards did not mesh well with them.  There is<br/>
an emphasis on completing things and earning the next level award.<br/>
Emily dropped out after her first year in Juniors because there was SO<br/>
much stress on working towards their Bronze Award.  She saw the other<br/>
Bronze Award recipients&#39; work and felt she couldn&#39;t come up with as<br/>
good of a project.  Mary Elayne got frustrated with Brownies because<br/>
she would start the work on a badge and decide that she had learned<br/>
all she wanted to on the badge and was ready to move on to something<br/>
else.  But because she didn&#39;t complete the badge she had nothing to<br/>
show (at least on her vest) for all that she had learned.  No badges<br/>
for half completed work.  Half completed work equated to not good<br/>
enough.  :(<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also important to remember that the majority of girls in scouting<br/>
are traditionally schooled.  They bring with them all the issues that<br/>
go along with school.  Depending on how comfortable your child is with<br/>
unschooling this may or may not be a problem.  There are homeschool<br/>
Girl Scout troops that can be a bit better, but again most people are<br/>
schooling at home (to some degree) and aren&#39;t living free, joyful and<br/>
unschooled lives.  There are much better ways of finding socialization<br/>
for your child than scouting.  If your primary goal is socialization<br/>
that is.<br/>
