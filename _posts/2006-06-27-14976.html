&quot;B) Hand it to him but tell him my honest feelings about being spoken<br/>
to like that. I would not tell him he was being rude; I would tell<br/>
him I didn&#39;t like being spoken to as though I was a servant and that<br/>
it didn&#39;t make me feel like helping him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have done a lot of that with Jalen.<br/>
I don&#39;t withhold whatever he shreiked at me about, but as I&#39;m handing<br/>
it over I say something like &quot;All you have to say is &#39;I want the<br/>
ketchup Mom&#39; and I&#39;ll get it for you, I&#39;m here to help you&quot;<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s bad enough for me to say &quot;Please don&#39;t scream at me, I<br/>
want to help you but that hurts my ears!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 5 now, and his method of obtaining what he needs is fairly<br/>
pleasant about 90% of the time. He slowly gets better and better at<br/>
picking up new tools.:)  He still has minor melt-downs. Minor to me,<br/>
because in the past it would take 1/2 hour or more to help him<br/>
calm....now it&#39;s usually short-lived. The best part about remaining<br/>
gentle and sweet even when they&#39;re unpleasant? They trust you, they<br/>
hug you, they are SO totally loving in between any unpleasantness!:)<br/>
It builds great relationships and that is the world to me.<br/>
