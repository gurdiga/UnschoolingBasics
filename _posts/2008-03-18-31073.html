<div id="ygrps-yiv-472645070">Is taking a mainstream path really an issue?  Forgive me if I have<br/>
missed something, I haven&#39;t been following this entire conversation,<br/>
but I wanted to chime in.  I don&#39;t necessarily think taking a<br/>
mainstream path is a bad thing.  I think being able to make informed<br/>
decisions regarding the paths we take would be more important.  My son<br/>
loves mainstream sports.  Since he is unschooled we feel that he is<br/>
better prepared to make decisions regarding whether he sticks to his<br/>
sport or not.  He&#39;s very competitive.  Something I learned last<br/>
weekend.  Wrestling is a very intense and emotional sport for a child,<br/>
but he LOVES it and has decided that the pros far outweigh the cons. <br/>
(read: being told what to do and yelled at from the sidelines)<br/>
<br/>
As far as art goes, I am fairly creative, but not terribly<br/>
spontaneous.  If your children want more art in their lives, or you<br/>
want to expose them to more art.  I don&#39;t see a problem with planning<br/>
at all.  Just don&#39;t be rigid in your plan.  Many times when we start<br/>
something arty, the kids take off on their own.  And BTW they may not<br/>
pursue a lifetime of art.   I don&#39;t think art is a &quot;prerequisite&quot; to<br/>
unschooling.  It&#39;s something that many children enjoy (i think kids<br/>
are naturally creative) and unschooling provides the perfect scenario<br/>
for children to be and stay creative.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know, you know, because I&#39;m so new to this and I have<br/>
misinterpreted before, but I didn&#39;t think the point of unschooling was<br/>
for us as parents to be feeding our talents and interests to our<br/>
children.  I *do* think that to a certain degree, either nature,<br/>
nurture or both, that kids take on the desires of their parents<br/>
naturally.  Well some do.  I am an animal nut.  I began working with<br/>
animals when I was 12.  I&#39;ve been a zookeeper, a large animal trainer,<br/>
a dog trainer, groomer, vet tech, and now I work with aggressive dogs,<br/>
using +P methods, helping to change the culture of force and<br/>
pain-based training for these dogs.  Both of my kids like animals.<br/>
One of my kids likes them as I do.  I didn&#39;t force it on him, I just<br/>
think he saw my passion and watched my involvement and it either<br/>
struck a chord in him or he took on what he saw.  Will he go into<br/>
animal behavior when he&#39;s older?  I don&#39;t know.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s necessary for me to pretend to be something I&#39;m not for him or<br/>
for him to pretend to an interest he doesn&#39;t have you know?<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t artsy, OK.  Are your kids?  Do they even seem<br/>
interested?  Maybe they&#39;d much rather spend time at a museum than<br/>
gluing macaroni to paper plates.  I think that&#39;s OK.  Not everyone has<br/>
the interest in everything else, and certainly not everyone has the<br/>
talent.  And I&#39;m *SURE* you are creative in other ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320884816">~~I&#39;m a scientist, an evolutionary<br/>
biologist. I am not creative in an arty way at all. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.:) Here&#39;s what I mean by that...<br/>
some people are naturally more abstract in their thinking, full of<br/>
color and pictures. Some people are more logical and concrete full of<br/>
questions and reason. We all have varying degrees of interests and<br/>
talents and natural leanings. We don&#39;t all need to be artists, that&#39;s<br/>
for sure!<br/>
<br/>
But, I believe that humans are born creative and expressive. It&#39;s not<br/>
about how they express that part of themselves, it&#39;s more important<br/>
they feel free to do so. You might express your creative self by<br/>
solving a complex scientific problem. <br/>
<br/>
We are all creative forces, we all need to express who-we-are in some<br/>
manner. That&#39;s part of being human in my opinion. I guess the question<br/>
I would have for you is when did you decide you weren&#39;t an artist? Is<br/>
this something you enjoyed as a child? Colors, textures and design<br/>
seem to be pretty natural for young children and they decide at some<br/>
point they aren&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot; or the ridicule and comparison they<br/>
receive shuts them down to even attempting art.<br/>
<br/>
Art is (at it&#39;s best) free expression. Not rules and &quot;how to&quot; and step<br/>
by step. It&#39;s manipulating colors or materials in a way that makes you<br/>
feel good, that expresses something within you!<br/>
<br/>
Again, some people won&#39;t find as much satisfaction doing those sorts<br/>
of activities and that&#39;s ok. But music and art and writing belong to<br/>
all humans, they don&#39;t belong exclusively to artistic types. Those<br/>
forms of expression are ultimately about human connections to<br/>
me....not about whether you&#39;re the next Picasso or Mozart or Thoreau!<br/>
<br/>
I have found that with children, you only need have a variety of<br/>
materials available and they will find ways to create with them just<br/>
fine. If we can approach art and other activities with the heart of a<br/>
young child, I believe we can find joy in the simple exploration of<br/>
such things. Watch them, they are young scientists about<br/>
it...observing, experimenting, analyzing, making conclusions etc..<br/>
<br/>
So ask yourself if you don&#39;t do those things simply because you have<br/>
zero interest in them, or if you don&#39;t do them because you&#39;re afraid<br/>
to explore them (or shut down to the idea of being artistic). Because<br/>
it matters.  It&#39;s one thing if you aren&#39;t interested, it&#39;s another<br/>
thing entirely if you&#39;re avoiding them the way I used to avoid math!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756329820">Ah, but evolutionary biology is one of the most beautiful things in the world. It is such a wonderful symphony of connections and growth and change. Oh, I can wax quite lyrical about evolutionary biology. Simon and Linnaea know a lot about the workings of the natural world because David (an evolutionary anthropologist) and I (another evolutionary anthropologist) are so in love with what we know, and excited by it, and often stunned by it. And we talk about it. <br/>
<br/>
There is an art to science. There is a creativity inherent in biology. They aren&#39;t separate things. In the preface to Richard Dawkins&#39; book Unweaving the Rainbow he says; <br/>
<br/>
   My title is from Keats, who believed that Newton had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to the prismatic colours. Keats could hardly have been more wrong, and my aim is to guide all who are tempted by a similar view towards the opposite conclusion. Science is, or ought to be, the inspiration for great poetry,...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there is beauty in symmetry and there is amazement in discovering that symmetry is a marker of health and the ability of the individual to overcome environmental insults. It is a wonderous thing to see how the beauty we find in the symmetrical is based on reproductive drive. <br/>
<br/>
Just like with all things unschooling, don&#39;t separate the scientific from the artistic. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m reaching clarity here, but really, there is a lot of overlap between the two.<br/>

new exciting stage of life lived in freedom. To me a huge breakthrough <br/>
has been to really accept that my kids could grow up and do anything at <br/>

that is not better than any other path. One never knows where any <br/>
interest can lead, but if it doesn&#39;t lead anywhere apparent- that is <br/>
wonderful, too. To assume that we as parents know what is a valid way to <br/>

his own money, and has a vision of himself becoming independent. It <br/>
seems that there is so much fear in parents that their kids will not <br/>
grow up and become independent that it becomes a self-fulfilling <br/>
prophecy. I would think that most kids would have their own motivations <br/>
to become responsible adults and that the parent is mainly there to <br/>
support and facilitate that path. Thought the timing certainly would <br/>
vary. It is so fun to be along with him on this journey- it inspires me <br/>
on my own continuing one-<br/>

their lives, not anything to do with a career or job choice, per se. I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181714876">I&#39;m a statistician and an economist. So is my husband.<br/>
<br/>
But our three kids are VERY &quot;arty.&quot; I&#39;m not sure how that happened  <br/>
other than that we really kept supplying them with materials,  <br/>
experiences, encouragement to pursue their own interests, and that is  <br/>
the direction their interests went.<br/>
<br/>
We did have a LOT of materials around - tons of paper, markers,  <br/>
crayons, paints, chalk, brushes, scissors, yarn, string, hole  <br/>
punchers, popsicle sticks, fabric, thread, beads, needles, wooden  <br/>
thingies, buttons, glitter, glue guns, glue sticks, white glue,  <br/>
&quot;stiffy&quot; glue, and on and on and on. Lots of homemade playdough. I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it mattered so much what the materials were - they were  <br/>
always just things that we picked up at garage sales, thrift stores,  <br/>
or the art or craft stores. Wander around in Michaels or another craft  <br/>
store - if the kids are interested, they&#39;ll see &quot;projects&quot; they might  <br/>
want to do. We kept lots of magazines around - they did a lot of  <br/>
collage-making while watching tv or listening to books on tape or to  <br/>
music.<br/>
<br/>
It was all &quot;free play&quot; - we didn&#39;t do very many predetermined crafts.  <br/>
The kids &quot;made messes&quot; mostly! (That&#39;s from other peoples&#39; points of  <br/>
view, not ours.) Most of those creative materials were always  <br/>
available for them to use in their pretend play - indoors or outdoors.  <br/>
Get some really good materials, too, for drawing and coloring and  <br/>
painting -- because there is a great joy in using high quality stuff -  <br/>
like PrismaColor colored pencils. They are expensive, so we took  <br/>
better care of them, the kids valued them and still have their large  <br/>
boxes of PrismaColor pencils, used so much that they are only an inch  <br/>
or so long, now.<br/>
<br/>
You could have fun looking through and ordering a lot of cool stuff  <br/>
from the Dick Blick art supplies catalog.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were young, we went for very quick trips to lots of  <br/>
museums, art galleries, stopped by the art department at the college  <br/>
where I teach, paused to look at paintings or photographs hanging in  <br/>
public places (like some MacDonalds have local artwork in them).<br/>
<br/>
Roya (23) is an artist - ceramics, painting, drawing and she knits and  <br/>
crochets - designs her own stuff. Roxana (20) doesn&#39;t create visual  <br/>
art of her own, but she is in Paris for three months and has a pass to  <br/>
the Louvre where she goes every time she has a spare couple of hours.  <br/>
And I&#39;m impressed by the artistry of the photographs she&#39;s been taking  <br/>
while living in Europe. Rosie (17) makes latch-hook rugs - she buys  <br/>
the kits. She also crochets and knits.<br/>
<br/>
Plus - all three of them sing a lot. Roxana performs a lot in  <br/>
musicals. Rox and Rosie both are into dancing and acting, too. We go  <br/>
to the theater a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
None of the development of all this arty side of life required me to  <br/>
teach them anything. It was all exposure and enjoyment and free play.  <br/>
When they got older - into their mid-teens, they started wanting more  <br/>
formal experiences. Roya enrolled in a ceramics class at the community  <br/>
college and continued with that for years. She joined a college vocal  <br/>
ensemble and performed with them for a couple of years. Roxana and  <br/>
Rosie take community college courses in musical theater, acting,  <br/>
dance, and technical theater like lighting design and stage make-up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127566979">I remember playing cards a lot with my dad when I was very young.  <br/>
Not much artsy going on in my house, either. And I DID have a  <br/>
traumatic experience with art, in school, in 4th grade.<br/>
<br/>
But, I want to say that it is worth it to get over it.<br/>
<br/>
Yet another chance to heal, to fill a gap in ourselves, through  <br/>
parenting our own children.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a good start is to focus on bringing the world of art to them by  <br/>
noticing what they notice. I remember we were in a shopping mall,  <br/>
once, and my oldest daughter mentioned something about the store  <br/>
fronts - how you could often tell what kind of merchandise was going  <br/>
to be inside the store, by what the design of the outside of the store  <br/>
was. What she said was  that it felt weird to her if the outside of  <br/>
the store didn&#39;t &quot;go with&quot; what was inside. HUH? I&#39;d have NEVER even  <br/>
noticed anything like that. So - we walked around the mall, looking at  <br/>
store fronts and guessing what was inside and then checking. Got ME to  <br/>
focus on &quot;design&quot; in a way I never had before and, ever since that  <br/>
day, I&#39;ve had a sort of sweet fondness for beautifully (and  <br/>
accurately) designed store fronts (facades?).  That was my little toe  <br/>
stepping into the waters of a growing appreciation of architectural  <br/>
design as art.<br/>
<br/>
Play some music in the car - try LOTS of different kinds and, instead  <br/>
of focusing on whether you like it or not, focus on your kids&#39;  <br/>
response to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is kind of like playing &quot;warmer and colder&quot; - do more of things  <br/>
that are warmer, less when the response is colder.<br/>
<br/>
Go to museums for quick trips - just find something interesting, enjoy  <br/>
it, and then leave. Make these visits short and sweet. My kids, as  <br/>
young adults, are now HUGE art museum lovers. I&#39;m really pleased for  <br/>
them to have this in their lives. But, amazingly, &quot;I&quot; am now also an  <br/>
art lover - and that was an unexpected side-effect of unschooling. A  <br/>
bonus for me.<br/>

 yes, it is step by step and logical BUT there&#39;s also an intuitive <br/>
creative aspect to science (and numbers) as well. Creativity is not <br/>
confined to papier mache and oil paints and writing poetry. There&#39;s <br/>
creativity in connecting the dots of the data in a new way that sheds a <br/>
different perspective on something.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, just because you aren&#39;t particularly interested in &quot;arty&quot; stuff <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t *facilitate* their access to the arts if that&#39;s <br/>
something of interest to someone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227771056">Thanks to everyone. You have helped me see that I am doing what I <br/>
can to facilitate my children&#39;s interests. I do provide a lot of art <br/>
materials and my son does play with them when he wants. He painted a <br/>
beautiful painting of yellow the other day, his fave color. I guess <br/>
I was just feeling like that wasn&#39;t enough if I didn&#39;t do something <br/>
with the stuff on a regular basis. We listen to music in the car. We <br/>
have CDs at home that my son can listen to whenever he wants. He <br/>
loves to dance and I love watching him dance. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m slowly learning that I am creative in my thinking. I never <br/>
thought of myself as that way before but I&#39;m pretty good at thinking <br/>
outside the box. It drives my husband batty, who does everything by <br/>
the book just because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s done. hehe<br/>
<br/>
This has also got me thinking more about my interest in art. I do <br/>
remember hating school field trips to the Smithsonian art museum. <br/>
Somehow those trips took all the fun and enjoyment out of the art. <br/>
And, as if once wasn&#39;t bad enough, I think I had to go every year <br/>
from around 5th grade on. Art doesn&#39;t move me like it moves some <br/>
people. I took an art class in the 8th grade. I don&#39;t remember being <br/>
discouraged about my work. I vaguely remember that I did well in the <br/>
class. I do remember, though, that I found it very boring because it <br/>
was so techinical. I just wanted to paint a picture. I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to have to worry about shading and perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not as limited as I thought.<br/>

I remember the *day* I decided I wasn&#39;t an artist. 1st grade (I can even<br/>
smell the classroom!) and we had Art class via television. You either kept<br/>
up or you didn&#39;t -- I didn&#39;t and I worked the next (too!) many years<br/>
supporting that kind of self-talk.<br/>
Then I questioned my own brains belief about myself. Challenged myself to<br/>
examine the Truths I was holding about mySelf. What if, just what *if* my<br/>
1st grade self was WRONG??<br/>
Turns out, I AM pretty creative!<br/>
I even have a painting (ala Bob Ross, complete with happy bushes) that will<br/>
go on display at our local coffee shop this summer :D<br/>

<br/>
But I wanted to address this because I really identified with your concerns. But I also have so much evidence that your concerns are unfounded. I have seven kids and every single one has such radically different interests. I spend all my spare time reading. I&#39;m not an artistic person, per se (although thanks to Ren I love ATCs lol) and my eight year old is a fantastic, immersed artist. She started so young experimenting with colors and perspectives. Because of those interests, I&#39;ve got to art galleries and museums and such, spending time with her. Emily LOVES to sew, and spends her time comparing fabrics and colors and sewing shapes to see what the 3D creates. I have NO idea where they get this....I&#39;ve sewn, sure, but one year decided my girls needed matching Easter dresses, and never sewed since. So I&#39;m definitely NOT modeling these interests, BUT I am aware of their interests and strew to ensure they feel supported in them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, got to give the laptop back to the boy, so I&#39;ll sign off now. Tomorrow morning I&#39;m getting up early to get mine back YAY!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve considered myself to be an artist for most of my life and we<br/>
certainly don&#39;t do anything on a regular basis!!:)<br/>
Unschooling can help us let go of that &quot;not-doing-enough&quot; syndrome.<br/>
When that feeling rises up it&#39;s a good chance to examine whether we<br/>
need to infuse our days with something new, or if it&#39;s just old<br/>
baggage clinging desperately. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one thing I love about keeping a blog. Anytime I feel that &quot;not<br/>

realize that even with all our hanging-out-watching-American-Idol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413424531">Ok on the subject of art and creativity.... two of my kids are VERY<br/>
skilled at drawing.... no one &quot;taught&quot; them to draw... they didn&#39;t<br/>
have lessons except for the older one having a few formal lessons<br/>
which she hated and the tiny bit of art that a kid gets at school in K<br/>
and 1st grades.   When the art lessons we were getting started<br/>
frustrating her we quit ( about 4 weeks in!)   Ok so flash forward now<br/>
she is almost 15... the other kiddo that draws is almost 13.... both<br/>
REALLY talented.  Every person that sees them drawing or sees their<br/>
drawings comments on how well they draw.   <br/>
I am happy to supply them with papers, pens, pencils and every other<br/>
art supply under the sun as I have done their entire lives.   The<br/>
thing I get really sick of is the constant nagging by other people<br/>
that they should take formal lessons!   My response is usually that<br/>
they developed to the point they are on their own (they occasionally<br/>
ask for technique books and so forth), neither has ever asked for<br/>
lessons or formal instruction...if they did I would provide it, and<br/>
frankly I think that sometimes natural talent or aptitude is damaged<br/>
by &quot;lessons&quot;.   The constant need that some people seem to have to<br/>
&quot;improve&quot; on everything really boggles me.   Both kids are happy with<br/>
their skill, they are not frustrated and they get so much pleasure and<br/>
joy from their artwork I don&#39;t see why that isn&#39;t enough for the world!   <br/>
<br/>
My oldest was told in school that she was not &quot;artistic&quot; (her<br/>
teacher&#39;s passion was drawing which my younger daughter excelled in) <br/>
it took years at home for her to discover she has a talent for<br/>
sculpting and for other types of art...jewelry, sewing, clothing<br/>
design etc.  Our youngest, the only boy, is very creative but in a<br/>
very different way...he builds all sorts of things with legos, knex,<br/>
tinker toys etc... everything he builds has to &quot;do something&quot;, has to<br/>
be symmetrical etc ... it&#39;s all very mathematical.    <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I am always surprised by the types of people who say they<br/>
aren&#39;t creative but then show some amazing wit for jokes or<br/>
impressions, draw or doodle with great skill or write computer<br/>
programs and such.   I think there is amazing creativity in lots of<br/>
things that aren&#39;t appreciated by alot of folks because they don&#39;t fit<br/>
some preconceived notion of what creativity or art is.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting discussion! <br/>

Yeah---don&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
Parents do it all the time, just as your school did. They want to <br/>
expose their kids to art or science or ---whatever, so they pack up and <br/>
pay to go to the place only to find that not everyone is having the <br/>
time of their lives. They persevere because they paid for the ticket <br/>
(and museum. zoo prices in many places have gone through the roof!) and <br/>
they feel the need to get their money&#39;s worth. So children are <br/>
d-r-a-g-g-e-d through the museum, barely looking. Or *mom* is <br/>
fascinated and wants to look at and read each and every plaque (that&#39;s <br/>
ME! &lt;g&gt;), so the kids have to stay with her while she piddles.<br/>
<br/>
Better to get a family pass and go for 20-30 minutes and leave while <br/>
it&#39;s still an interesting place. Better for mom to come back *by <br/>
herself* and spend hours reading all the plaques.<br/>

I remember being *good*, so I was given special &quot;art lessons&quot; at the <br/>
art museum. I wanted to scream, &quot;I HATE PEARS!&quot; Why do &quot;art teachers&quot; <br/>
feel the need to make children draw picture after picture of PEARS???<br/>

I learned to hate art class. I knew *I* would never torture my kids <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi ALyisa<br/>
I am right there in the non crafty boat with you.  Liz is very <br/>
interested in all things crafty and I do my best to support those <br/>
interests.  When she was small I would go with her to craft events and <br/>
do my best.  She also spent a lot of time with my sister and in the <br/>
craft & sewing groups at Girls Inc.  Now that she&#39;s a teen my support <br/>
is mostly financial & transportation.  Last night we started working <br/>
on cross stitch projects together.  That is the only craft I have ever <br/>
enjoyed.  Liz tried it before and was frustrated with it.  Maybe now <br/>
it will be something we can enjoy together.  I do consider myself to <br/>
be creative of thought.  I can see a lot of options and tend to think <br/>
outside the box.  I think this trait is very common with unschooling <br/>
parents, perhaps even universal.  Being creative means more than being <br/>
crafty or artistic or even having an interest in those things.  It <br/>
being able to see a way to support interests in your children that are <br/>
not your own.<br/>

<br/>
Blech, ptooey, yuck.<br/>
Even before my radical unschooling journey, I KNEW that was a really<br/>
yucky thing to do and I never wanted my kids to learn to hate poetry<br/>

<br/>
I remember having this really sad feeling because the poor kid should<br/>
not have been writing poems if she hated it. Defeats the entire<br/>
