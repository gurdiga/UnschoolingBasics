We are going through the same thing here.  My son, 6, loves to watch TV.  After leaving the restriction of what and how much he can watch behind, when we are home he is in front of the TV.  So much so, that he does not want to leave it to eat.  He has missed meals to continue to watch.  This has been going on for about 2 months now.  But I have noticed in the last few days a change.  When he gets up in the morning now, he wants to play on the computer instead of going straight for the TV.  He played for an hour and a half this am.  I am active with a homeschool group, so we are out of the house 3-4 days a week.  I see that he is learning from what he watches, and trust that he is getting what he needs from it at this time in his life.  I am confident that this will pass, as he finds new things that interest him, and I try to make available things that I think he would like.  I am learning to trust that he knows what is best for him and he is learning to trust that we will not impose<br/>
 restrictions on him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Karen, I may be no help, because I worship my TV :) <br/>
But I would suggest to anyone with TV problems....TIVO<br/>
is TV of the gods.  Pause live TV, go eat, come back<br/>
and not miss a thing.  Set it to record Kim Possible<br/>
EVERY DAY so you have them all on file and can pull<br/>
them up and watch your favorite, even when it&#39;s not<br/>
on.  I know it&#39;s very liberating, not to have to worry<br/>
about the time and to be able to watch your favorite<br/>
show any time, day or night....Plus, if you have a<br/>
special interest in, say, ancient egypt or insects or<br/>
what have you, you put that name in and do a search,<br/>
and you can record all the shows about that as well! <br/>
So, think about it ;)<br/>
<br/>
(I in no way profit from the TIVO company, lol)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second Tivo! I think a lot of the reason kids get glued to the TV after<br/>
restrictions is that they feel like if they don&#39;t watch it *now* it will be<br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
(You&#39;ll have to check with you cable/satellite provider to see if they<br/>
supply access to the programing. In our area it&#39;s only $5 extra and it&#39;s an<br/>
awesome deal. You&#39;ll also need to buy the Tivo box. Ours only holds 30 hours<br/>
(which sounds like a lot but isn&#39;t even for us that keep deleting after we<br/>
watch) but it was only $100. And it&#39;s more convenient to save to tape from<br/>
the Tivo box.)<br/>
<br/>
You can also buy entire seasons of some shows (and more coming out all the<br/>
time.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, they do eventually slow down on the TV when they feel confidant that<br/>
they can turn it off and won&#39;t come back to find it limited again.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;potentially destructive and disruptive&quot; when kids are given the<br/>
choice between doing things they like and things they don&#39;t like, they<br/>
choose things they like. When kids are give the choice between things they<br/>
are allowed to do and things they aren&#39;t allowed to do, &quot;aren&#39;t allowed&#39;<br/>
looks intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen a sign on a boring door that says &quot;No Admittance&quot; and<br/>
felt the urge to open it? If there were no sign you&#39;d not give the door a<br/>
second glance. But that &quot;No Admittance&quot; sign makes it intriguing, like<br/>
there&#39;s something special back there that you can&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what happens when things are labeled &quot;not allowed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things I could feel justified in preventing my daughter<br/>
from doing because they might be damaging. But she hasn&#39;t been damaged by<br/>
things that people fear (TV, video games) and hasn&#39;t chosen things that are<br/>
damaging.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 12 and has always had the freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
What is it that you fear?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142586672">We actually worked out some ideas that work for everyone.  My husband wants to have sit down dinners, so we either tape the shows so he can watch what he missed later, or we agreed to do dinner later sometimes.  This way it is not at the same time as the shows that are very important to him.  Also, I do let him eat dinner in front of the TV.  He likes to do this in my bedroom, on my bed, so it is when the food is not something that is going to make a huge mess on my bed.  Spaghetti and soups just do not fly in my room, but pizza and sandwiches are great. My ds is happy with the solutions we have come up with, but has yet to watch anything we have taped.  Too much on when he goes back to the TV to watch what was missed.  I guess just knowing that if he wanted to he could is enough for him!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592542992">Karen,<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re going through, believe me! I was raised without tv, convinced that it was this awful form of communication that rotted your brain. <br/>
HMPHF!<br/>
<br/>
My mind has obviously been changed.:)<br/>
A few years ago, when we went through the whole &quot;detox&quot; period, I thought my kids would never do anything else. It was mainly my oldest, who had the most controls in his life, that had problems walking away.<br/>
It took about a year...<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
He&#39;s still a bright, creative, wonderful individual...tv did nothing to alter that. I figured a year of tv as a child, was better than as an adult! Now his life is full of many different topics of interest, tv holds no power over him, but he still enjoys it immensely.<br/>
He&#39;s probably learned more from tv, than any other form of communication.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I got when dealing with my fears and frustrations, was to sit down and watch it with them! To get interested in the shows they like, talk about them, BE together. It showed my kids I was not the enemy where tv was concerned, and it opened up their world to me in a new way. It was another thing to connect over, not create conflict.<br/>
The other thing that I had to learn, was to make good options available more readily. If tv is the most interesting thing available in the house, then it just shows how intelligent the child is for choosing the most attractive option! So I tried to make sure we had some bubbly, fun things going on here and there, to make myself feel better. They gravitated back to the tv fairly quick though.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that helped me, was to see the tv as a learning opportunity, not something I needed to get them away from.<br/>
Once I saw the whole wide world as potential learning tools, I no longer felt stressed when they needed a lot of television. It was just another way they were learning. And learn they did!<br/>
<br/>
So....hang in there. Trust that your child is doing exactly what they need to for the time being. I can honestly say, 3.5 years later, that it was one of the best things I ever did. It has led to more joyful unschooling, better relationships and much learning. I have learned more than anyone probably, about letting go of my need to control and what a wonderful tool television really can be. <br/>

to it immediatly.  Then I have been thinking about it all morning.  <br/>
Thinking &quot;how can that be sad. It was his choice to miss the meal&quot;.  <br/>
It just hit me how very sad it is!!  He missed a meal because we had <br/>
not come up with a solution that was meeting his needs.  He felt he <br/>
had no other option but to miss a meal.  As a family we have come up <br/>

We really should get paid for this &lt;G&gt; I LOVE TiVo. Personally, I don&#39;t like tv. The noise alone pushes me right to the brink of insanity. ;-) Given my irritation by the television, dh was quite surprised when I suggested a TiVo. I must say it&#39;s the best television related purchase ever. I really despised feeling like what we needed to do was on hold because there was a &quot;we HAVE to watch this!&quot; show on. Now, just hit record. Freedom! I love it. Plus ff through all the commercials is a major plus. <br/>

<br/>
oohh TV....<br/>
<br/>
We are huge tv watchers, we have 3 right now, used to have 6. :)<br/>
we have vcrs, dvds, video games,(we are waiting to be able to afford tivo, my dad has it and he records and then tapes things he thinks we would all like.) It&#39;s pretty frequent that all 3 tvs are on all day. <br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t zone out in front of it, they are often coloring, reading, playing, dancing, jumping on the trampoline, painting, building, wrestling, building forts, eating, dozing, running...should I go on...the tv is there and is another one of the hundreds of fun things that are at their fingertips each and everyday.<br/>
<br/>
The list of things that we have all learned from tv and movies is huge. The discussions that have been sparked and lasted for minutes to months are innumerable. Tha passions discovered, the humor that has be understood, the words learned, the songs sung, the dances danced, the thoughts thunk....<br/>
<br/>
whew....<br/>
<br/>
I think the outlook of the parents towards tv will come into play alot during this time, have you completely let go our your tv=evil thing? When you can enjoy tv(maybe not as much as we do) I think you will see the benifits of your son watching, and not look at it as something he needs to grow board of and out grow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278864979">I never said I &quot;feared&quot; anything.  I also never said anything about <br/>
not being &quot;allowed&quot; to do anything.  My inquiry was (and remember...I <br/>
was not the original poster re: TV, I was thinking more about <br/>
limits...is that the wrong term?... in general) &quot;things that might be <br/>
not so good for them (too much TV might be an example...it&#39;s not <br/>
really an issue for us, I don&#39;t have any TV problems...another may be <br/>
sugar intake, staying up too late...running into the street???)or <br/>
something that is potentially destructive or disruptive (Examples of <br/>
this might be painting on the living room wall or picking all the <br/>
flowers in the neighbors garden or waking up houseguests a 6oclock in <br/>
the morning by running into the bedroom and jumping on the <br/>
bed....these things, painting and picking flowers and jumping on the <br/>
bed are all things I have no problems with...but implemeting limits <br/>
on how and when they should be done seems appropriate and that&#39;s what <br/>
I mean by disruptive or destrictive).  I ask these questions because <br/>
I have a very free-spirited out of the box kind of kid (he would <br/>
paint himself green and run down the street naked if I let him...ok, <br/>
he has done this...really...)...many times the way he does things are <br/>
a bit out of the ordinary and I struggle with letting him be who his <br/>
is and showing him some basic aspects of social appropriateness.  Is <br/>
there a balance here?  Am I using the wrong language when I say <br/>
limits?...do some kids need a little extra guidance when it comes to <br/>
these things?  My 2 yo seems to already naturally get the &quot;being <br/>
aware of other people and things&quot; and my 5yo is more in his own word <br/>
(more implusive and moves to the beat of his own drum).  OK, I&#39;m <br/>
rambling but I guess what I am looking for is a little advice on <br/>
keeping this unique personality intact....I don&#39;t want him to conform <br/>
to the world necessarily, I want the world to accept him as he <br/>
is...and since working with him is more feasable than working with <br/>
the whole world, I want to help him figure out ways to be accepted, <br/>
KWIM?  I really don&#39;t want to get into a big semantics exchange here <br/>
either so I hope I don&#39;t get an anwer back like &quot;why does the world <br/>
have to accept him?&quot;....the &quot;whole&quot; world doesn&#39;t.  I just want him <br/>
to have the skills to avoid his and other people&#39;s frustration in <br/>
some social situations.  Well, I really went off here...will be <br/>
interesting to see the responses I get...lol <br/>

Having  just lifted the restrictions on food and TV (I was one of those <br/>
people who  thought television was the Source for All Evil, followed by sugar  <br/>
consumption), my sons are glued to TV for hours now.  Please tell me this  is a <br/>
phase and they&#39;ll grow bored with it!  Has that happened to  others?  I&#39;m <br/>
looking for support in this process of trusting my wonderful  children, even as they <br/>
go off the deep end with zoning out to  TV.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a phase, and they&#39;ll grow bored of it-----but NOT until you lose  your <br/>
fear of it. Your fear is emitted through your pores too!  Not just  your voice! <br/>
This is the deschooling ourselves that we talk about a lot. You&#39;re  going to <br/>
have to *believe* it&#39;s not evil! Really.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this all morning. There&#39;s a conversation on the  <br/>
message boards about tv too. There we&#39;ve been criticized for being anti-book,  <br/>
when actually we&#39;re just pro-tv. We&#39;re NOT anti-book----in fact I&#39;d guess  ALL <br/>
of us are avid readers! It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t denigrate tv as evil and  make <br/>
books &quot;godly&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been called &quot;book worship&quot;---when the value of books is raised to  <br/>
incredible heights. Books are no more, and no LESS, valuable in our home than  <br/>
anything else. A hundred years ago, a book *might* be the most valuable  <br/>
possession a family owned. I doubt I could even guess the number we own  now---and many <br/>
are in *anything* but pristine condition.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
These days and times, we just have many more things that are just as  <br/>
stimulating, as inspiring, and as thought-provoking as books. TV, movies, games,  <br/>
computers---even our backyard! is often more stimulating than many  books.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Also, for young children:   I&#39;ve seen a lot of clammer that young  children <br/>
should not be exposed to tv or computers. I have a really hard time  with that. <br/>
I read articles all the time about how bad they are. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Let&#39;s say that everyone should have an apple a day----that was all the  rage <br/>
a few decades back. Apples are nutritious, crunchy, good for the teeth.  <br/>
Problem is that the very young and the very old---and a few hockey  players---CAN&#39;T <br/>
eat apples. No teeth. Applesauce is ok, but NOT as good as  apples because it <br/>
isn&#39;t crunchy, lots of vitamins are lost, you can&#39;t carry it  around, you <br/>
need a spoon, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
TV (and computers) is similar to applesauce, in that books are deemed  better <br/>
(by somebody). But children, who can&#39;t read, can STILL be wowed by so  much <br/>
information, movement, songs, stories, math, science, history,  geography, <br/>
philosophy, cooking, vocabulary....everything! from tv!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Even children who CAN read---as well as adults and old farts----can  absorb <br/>
SOOO much cool information withOUT books. It&#39;s right there! Why does it  come <br/>
across as evil? It&#39;s just another way to gather information. And it&#39;s  <br/>
ESPECIALLY handy for pre-readers! They can pick up so many words and see places  <br/>
they&#39;ve never been, animals they&#39;ve never seen.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
How is this evil? <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
How is it even remotely bad?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
As we get older, as we see more tv, it becomes just another source of  <br/>
information and entertainment. My bee hives are JUST as fascinating---to me! But  to <br/>
a child, tv is often HUGELY informational and entertaining. As it should  be.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Nevertheless, the facination often wanes as other things become more  <br/>
interesting. My 16 year old (who spent 18 MONTHS just watching tv, sleeping,  eating, <br/>
and talking on the phone as he deschooled) now rarely watches anything  but <br/>
&quot;Whose Line is it Anyway&quot; and maybe &quot;Family Guy&quot; (with his little  brother).<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s just too busy with his other interests.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard, with all the brainwashing that&#39;s been done to us, to believe  that <br/>
tv isn&#39;t evil. There have even been several books written about the  <br/>
*dangers* of tv. But when you look at it as just another  information/entertainment <br/>
source, it BECOMES just another  information/entertainment source.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Back off. Watch *with* them. Pick up knitting or macrame if the sitting  <br/>
bothers you. TV&#39;s just another cool way to learn about our world. But you have  to <br/>
believe that!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Or fake it &#39;til you make it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587607304">Examples of this might be painting on the living room wall <br/>
<br/>
****We&#39;re about to rip down all of the old paneling in this house <br/>
and I can&#39;t wait to see again all of the paintings that Laurie and <br/>
her friends did when they were young. They covered EVERY wall in the <br/>
house with paints, crayons, chalk. One niece was so schooled that <br/>
all she could think of to put on the wall was math problems.<br/>
<br/>
  I ask these questions because I have a very free-spirited out of <br/>
the box kind of kid (he would paint himself green and run down the <br/>
street naked if I let him...ok, he has done this...really...)<br/>
<br/>
*****I love it!<br/>
<br/>
  I just want him to have the skills to avoid his and other people&#39;s <br/>
frustration in some social situations.  <br/>
<br/>
*****I didn&#39;t make Laurie say &quot;please, thank you&quot; etc and that would <br/>
really burn some of the southern ladies up. I can&#39;t remember Laurie <br/>
being frustrated by other people not accepting her the way she was; <br/>
she seemed oblivious to their opinions until she got much older. <br/>
Laurie was also very precocious in her speaking and for some reason <br/>
that irked adults. She didn&#39;t want to discuss toys with adults; she <br/>
wanted to discuss whatever the adults were talking about. On her <br/>
second birthday she didn&#39;t want to wear the pretty little dress that <br/>
Mom got her and sit &#39;like a lady&#39;, she wanted to wear her jeans and <br/>
boots and listen to rock n roll. <br/>
<br/>
I guess none of these things is really disruptive (unless you&#39;re my <br/>
mom) but at those times I made sure I didn&#39;t appear to be upset (and <br/>
I wasn&#39;t upset) by anything she did. I let the other adults know <br/>
that what she did, how she did it and when was fine with me. I <br/>
supported her uniqueness. <br/>

***<br/>
<br/>
I think TV being considered bad is directly related to school and<br/>
homework and chores. <br/>
<br/>
TV interested kids in a way their text books and reading assignments<br/>
could never do.  TV was infinitely more interesting than taking out the<br/>
trash or mowing the lawn.  It couldn&#39;t be that school and homework and<br/>
chores were stupidly boring and time wasting and dull, so it had to be<br/>
that TV was corrupting otherwise decent kids into laziness and dismal<br/>
school performance. <br/>
<br/>
After hearing it so many times over so many years lots of people accept<br/>
it as true.  Experts tell us it&#39;s true.  They&#39;ve studied lots and lots of<br/>
school kids who&#39;d rather watch TV than do their homework. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the 1800&#39;s when dime store novels first appeared they were evil, too. <br/>
They were corrupting young people to all kinds of wickedness.  Some kids<br/>
even read dime store novels instead of doing school work.  Shameful. <br/>

******I didn&#39;t watch any tv for years; I just didn&#39;t have the time. <br/>
Now, we&#39;re all through with our stuff and ready to sit down at 9pm <br/>
to watch Whose Line. It&#39;s the only thing I watch, but I GOTTA have <br/>
it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135738493">Just some practical ideas...<br/>
<br/>
We have trays that we eat on, and they have lips and<br/>
hold a variety of goop, even if it&#39;s spilled and<br/>
played in....<br/>
<br/>
Plus, is a meal is going to be super-duper-messy,<br/>
like...say, BBQ ribs or...well, whatever, then a bath<br/>
towel goes beneath the tray, and that holds any<br/>
splatters that made it off the tray.<br/>
<br/>
We almost exclusively eat in bed, or on the floor of<br/>
the play room, and this keeps beds and floors clean.<br/>
<br/>
As far as crumbs go, we just sweep out the bed before<br/>
retiring at night...<br/>

&gt; provider to see if they<br/>
&gt; supply access to the programing. In our area it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; only $5 extra and it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; awesome deal. You&#39;ll also need to buy the Tivo box.<br/>
&gt; Ours only holds 30 hours<br/>
&gt; (which sounds like a lot but isn&#39;t even for us that<br/>
&gt; keep deleting after we<br/>
&gt; watch) but it was only $100. And it&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; convenient to save to tape from<br/>
&gt; the Tivo box.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can also buy entire seasons of some shows (and<br/>
&gt; more coming out all the<br/>
&gt; time.)<br/>

because I found a great deal on their DVR&#39;s (same as<br/>
Tivo)....we got three DVR&#39;s, each with 100 hours!  Now<br/>
we never fill them up!  Hooray!  And we got all the<br/>
machines for free, just have to pay for programming<br/>
each month!<br/>
