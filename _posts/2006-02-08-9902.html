<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797971293">&quot;Hi  ,  I know this sounds harsh but I say  to myself:&quot; is there a<br/>
PARENT in this house?!?&quot; and I put a foot down. No  mouthyness, not<br/>
without harsh repercussions. Once, I had a child that I  didn&#39;t allow<br/>
to speak for a whole day - not a word.  A couple of  lectures about<br/>
respect, responsibility, and future goals might be in order.  It&#39;s<br/>
tough being both parent and teacher, but you owe it to the kid to hang<br/>
 in there! You can do this! Days like that, I often declared Chore<br/>
Days. Once  they realize the choice is schoolwork or scrubbing<br/>
bathrooms, suddenly  essays didn&#39;t look so hard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d certainly offer up a different perspective, so the OP knows that<br/>
there are some other options! Cripes.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a happy household eh? Boy, I was raised pretty traditional<br/>
in many ways, but my parents would NEVER have been that cruel. Wow. <br/>
Poor kids. The worst part is they&#39;ll probably grow up to treat their<br/>
own children in a similar manner.<br/>
Maybe not...there&#39;s hope.<br/>
