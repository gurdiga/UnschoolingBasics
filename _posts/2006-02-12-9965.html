<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359297106">Hi. I am having a bit of a problem with my 9 year old son. I have <br/>
been unschooling him and his three younger brothers and he is showing <br/>
major frustration for friends and going places. I am limited for <br/>
going lot&#39;s of places because of the fact that I have a one year old <br/>
that if you interupt his nap schedual he is very cranky. And the fact <br/>
that my older kids like to stay up late and sleep in late. I try to <br/>
get out as much as I can and even participate in a homeschool group <br/>
once a week.<br/>
But My nine year old is not interested in much more than movies and <br/>
playstation no matter what we have going on and no matter what I <br/>
strew his way. <br/>
My family live far away and the ones that live close work and have <br/>
school. He is to the point where he is having crying spells because <br/>
he wants kids his age to do things with and to play. None in the <br/>
group are close to his age. I have asked if he wants to try out school<br/>
(even though I am against the idea) but he always says no. But i <br/>
don&#39;t know if he is basing his decision because he has never gone and <br/>
because of the negative things about it that i know he has heard from <br/>
me talking  to others about it. I really don&#39;t know what to do. Does <br/>
anyone else have this come up?Does anyone have thier children get <br/>
confused because they want more to do than whats at home but don&#39;t <br/>
want to go to school?<br/>
I am trying everything to get him out more and look for different <br/>
people to be around but it just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough. <br/>
I would appreciate some advice.            Thanks Tonya</div>

Hi. I am having a bit of a problem with my 9 year old son. I have <br/>
<br/>
been unschooling him and his three younger brothers and he is showing <br/>
<br/>
major frustration for friends and going places. I am limited for <br/>
<br/>
going lot&#39;s of places because of the fact that I have a one year old <br/>
<br/>
that if you interupt his nap schedual he is very cranky. And the fact <br/>
<br/>
that my older kids like to stay up late and sleep in late. I try to <br/>
<br/>
get out as much as I can and even participate in a homeschool group <br/>
<br/>
once a week.<br/>
<br/>
But My nine year old is not interested in much more than movies and <br/>
<br/>
playstation no matter what we have going on and no matter what I <br/>
<br/>
strew his way. <br/>
<br/>
My family live far away and the ones that live close work and have <br/>
<br/>
school. He is to the point where he is having crying spells because <br/>
<br/>

No, they don&#39;t have to be nine. in fact, my son gets along with basically  <br/>
all ages from 5 to 15. It&#39;s just still hard to find someone in the area that he  <br/>
can spend time with.<br/>
We live in a small back woods town and there is not much happening  here.<br/>
