This reminds me of when my son was little, he had such a hard time going to  <br/>
sleep and waking during the night.  He also had night terrors of some  sort.  <br/>
 <br/>
I had collected hours of Little Bear on video to have handy during the  day.  <br/>
The calm music and sweet stories always helped calm him out of a  tantrum.  <br/>
One night, in desperation, I put in Little Bear and it worked  like magic!  He <br/>
relaxed and went to sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
I should probably dig those out and use them myself!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC (still without DVR)<br/>

Actually, I find the true beauty of TIVO is that when the schedule <br/>
changes, that darn box KNOWS it and records your favorite shows at <br/>
their newly scheduled times :)  (assuming they are still on at all)<br/>
<br/>
Kiersten<br/>
mom to Jacob 4 1/2 and Emma 3<br/>
<br/>
who never wanted TIVO until we got it...<br/>
Commercials- what are those???<br/>
<br/>
And for late night holding of Emma when she can&#39;t sleep- WOW, all <br/>
these GOOD shows are waiting for me:)</div>
