<div id="ygrps-yiv-977479412">The LIFE is Good Unschooling Conference Early Bird Registration<br/>
deadline is 2 weeks away - Jan 31 2009!<br/>
<br/>
Make your hotel reservations and submit your registration right away!<br/>
<br/>
The third annual LIFE is Good Unschooling Conference will<br/>
be taking place just outside of Portland this year, May 21-24th, 2009.<br/>

<br/>
This is truly an unschooling conference - there are no &quot;experts&quot;<br/>
lecturing, and no &quot;curriculum&quot; or &quot;educational&quot; items being<br/>
feverishly pitched. Families are the experts and fun is the name of<br/>
the game - every activity is for the whole family, children are the<br/>
feature of the event and everything is open to them. The speakers are<br/>
either parents of unschooled children, or grown unschoolers<br/>
themselves. There are also more intimate interactive circle chats on<br/>
a wide range of topics, and loads of &quot;Funshops&quot; - like workshops,<br/>
only so much more FUN - where you can discover new talents and<br/>
skills, or share one of your own! The unschooling talent show is<br/>
always a huge hit, as is the big family barefoot boogie dance! Folks<br/>
of all ages can hock their handmade wares at the &quot;Un&quot;trepreneurial<br/>
Fair. And Amy Steinberg, who performed a fabulously energetic concert<br/>
last year will be back to do it again this year:<br/>

<br/>
And because we cannot bear to part at the end of all this fun, we<br/>
spend the Monday picnicing at a terrific nearby park.<br/>
<br/>
Dads are a huge part of the event too, speaking, leading funshops,<br/>
and having gatherings of their own that are sometimes referred to by<br/>
the beverage-inspired moniker &quot;SSUD&quot;s (the Secret Society of<br/>
Unschooling Dads).<br/>
<br/>
It is a pretty cool feeling just to be surrounded by families of all<br/>
ages who live unschooling every day, and totally get your life<br/>
without you having to explain a thing! We literally take over the<br/>
hotel, which is a sight in itself.<br/>
<br/>

En route, Seattle and Portland both offer amazing museums, science<br/>
centers, zoos, and children&#39;s museums. It is the perfect excuse for a<br/>
road trip!<br/>
