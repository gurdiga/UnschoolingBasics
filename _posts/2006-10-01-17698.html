Colleges Coveting Home-Schooled Students<br/>
By ALAN SCHER ZAGIER, Associated Press Writer<br/>
September 30, 2006<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA, Mo. - Bombarded by choices at a college job fair, Sara<br/>
Kianmehr quickly found her match: Columbia College, a small, private<br/>
school that didn&#39;t mind that her transcripts came from her parents.<br/>
<br/>
The college &quot;was the only institution that didn&#39;t have a puzzled look<br/>
and say, &#39;Home school,&#39; and ask me a million questions,&quot; the<br/>
19-year-old junior said. &quot;There was a big appeal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With colleges and universities aggressively competing for the best<br/>
students, a growing number of institutions are actively courting<br/>
homebound high achievers like Kianmehr, who took community college<br/>
courses her senior year of high school and hopes to eventually study<br/>
filmmaking at New York University or another top graduate school.<br/>
<br/>
The courtship can be as subtle as admissions office Web sites geared to<br/>
home-schooled applicants or, in the case of Columbia College, as direct<br/>
as purchasing mailing lists and holding special recruiting sessions.<br/>
<br/>
After years of skepticism, even mistrust, many college officials now<br/>
realize it&#39;s in their best interest to seek out home-schoolers, said<br/>
Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American<br/>
Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was a tendency to kind of dismiss home schooling as inherently<br/>
less rigorous,&quot; he said. &quot;The attitude of the admissions profession<br/>
could have at best been described as skeptical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooled students _ whose numbers in this country range from an<br/>
estimated 1.1 million to as high as 2 million _ often come to college<br/>
equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in higher education, said<br/>
Regina Morin, admissions director of Columbia College.<br/>
<br/>
Such assets include intellectual curiosity, independent study habits<br/>
and critical thinking skills, she said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s one of the fastest-growing college pools in the nation,&quot; she<br/>
said. &quot;And they tend to be some of the best prepared.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The number of home-schooled graduates enrolled at Columbia College is<br/>
small _ about a dozen out of a full-time undergraduate population that<br/>
hovers near 1,000. But they count among their supporters an influential<br/>
advocate.<br/>
<br/>
Terry Smith, a political science professor and the school&#39;s dean of<br/>
academic affairs, home-schooled three of his four children in the 1970s<br/>
and &#39;80s. Each of those children went on to graduate from college, with<br/>
two earning master&#39;s degrees.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All of my professional work has been influenced by this family<br/>
schooling experience,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re all teachers and learners.<br/>
They&#39;re just the apprentices, and we&#39;re the master learners.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The school&#39;s admissions standards for home-schooled students are<br/>
identical to those for traditional graduates _ minus the formal<br/>
transcript requirement. Some colleges and universities, though,<br/>
continue to require home-schoolers to earn a GED high-school<br/>
equivalency diploma or take subject-specific SAT tests along with the<br/>
standard requirements.<br/>
<br/>
At Stanford, sympathetic admissions officers have helped make the<br/>
university a beacon for high-achieving home-schoolers. The support can<br/>
be seen on the Stanford admissions office&#39;s Web site.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The central issue for us is the manner in which you have gone about<br/>
the learning process, not how many hurdles you have jumped,&quot; the office<br/>
advises home-schooled students. &quot;We look for a clear sense of<br/>
intellectual growth and a quest for knowledge in all of our applicants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jon Reider, a former senior associate admissions director at Stanford,<br/>
said the school&#39;s pursuit of home-schoolers fits its academic and<br/>
social mission.<br/>
<br/>
He also acknowledged that Stanford and other schools now realize that<br/>
home-school students are a prominent enough population that can only be<br/>
ignored at a university&#39;s own peril.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Part of it is driven by demographics,&quot; said Reider, now a guidance<br/>
counselor at a private high school in San Francisco. &quot;There&#39;s a surplus<br/>
of college spaces&quot; and attracting good students to them is important<br/>
everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Magdalene Pride, a first-year Columbia College student, was a<br/>
beneficiary of the school&#39;s aggressive recruitment of home-schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
After earning more than 50 credit hours through a combination of<br/>
community college classes near her suburban St. Louis home and online<br/>
Advanced Placement course, Price was awarded a four-year scholarship to<br/>
Columbia College that covers the school&#39;s $12,414 annual tuition.<br/>
<br/>
Among those who helped sell her on Columbia College was Kianmehr, a<br/>
student ambassador who spoke at a college fair Pride attended.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re so open to home-schoolers here,&quot; she said. &quot;No one looks down<br/>
on me, or treats me different. It&#39;s very accepting.&quot;<br/>
