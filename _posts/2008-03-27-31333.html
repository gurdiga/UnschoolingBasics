<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004556777">I have a five year old (my oldest) that keeps saying that he wants a<br/>
five year old friend.  He has lots of kids to play with from our<br/>
preschool co-op that meets 2 times per week and about 8 friends in our<br/>
neighborhood that he plays with in the afternoons.  The trouble that<br/>
he sees is that none of them are five, even though many of them are<br/>
within days of turning five.  His other complaint is that none of them<br/>
like the things that he LOVES: Star Wars, LEGOS, video games, movies.<br/>
 My DH and many relatives play all of these things with him.<br/>
I think that he really wants a buddy to do the things that he loves<br/>
and someone that &quot;gets&quot; him (he likes having serious conversations,<br/>
but he also has a great sense of humor and loves to be silly). Most<br/>
kids that we&#39;re around are nothing like him except maybe similar in<br/>
emotional levels.  I don&#39;t think that he always needs to be around<br/>
people just like him, but one similar friend would be nice. <br/>
<br/>
The other day my husband insisted on visiting a school to be sure that<br/>
unschooling was the best thing for Braeden.  His concern is that since<br/>
Braeden is so social that maybe he&#39;d be happier in a school.  We<br/>
visited the school and to my GRAND surprise Braeden LOVED it.  It was<br/>
a Montessori school and after the 10 minutes we were out of the room,<br/>
we went back in to see Braeden leading a pack of kids around the room<br/>
showing them the Egyptian statue and teaching them about Egypt.  All<br/>
day he kept saying, Mom I&#39;m so HAPPY! and singing &quot;school, school&quot; to<br/>
the Star Wars tune and said &quot;now I&#39;ll be like a normal five year old<br/>
because I&#39;ll go to school&quot;.  I really want to do what Braeden wants,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think that school is the best option for him and that the<br/>
friends are the real issue.  <br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling and all that it has given our family-a chance to<br/>
travel, unique, strong, opinionated, loving, intelligent, fun kids and<br/>
a chance to really know my kids.  I just can&#39;t come up with any other<br/>
ideas to help him meet friends.  He is not interested in any kind of<br/>
classes where he might meet other children.  I think that what he<br/>
liked about these children was that 1. they were mostly five 2. many<br/>
of them were highly verbal and thoughtful(as he is) 3. they were<br/>
willing to listen to what he had to say 4. some were boys (but who<br/>
knows if they share the same interests).  No one else that he plays<br/>
with meets these &quot;requirements&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it would be so<br/>
difficult to find children like this, but we have really struggled!! <br/>
First I need more ideas on how to meet better friends for him, second<br/>
I need ideas to encourage him to try new activities and third I need<br/>
thoughts on letting him try school even though it will be difficult<br/>
financially and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good fit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight!!<br/>
