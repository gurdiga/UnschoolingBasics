<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385446573">Hi everyone,<br/>
I was wondering if anyone on this list lives in South Florida?  I normally am in Trinidad - <br/>
Southern Caribbean - but am in South Miami Beach this week.  I used to live here up to about <br/>
2 years ago and now am trying to be back in this area about every 2 to 3 months for a week <br/>
or two.  It would be great to make some connections here.  I always found South Beach itself <br/>
to have very few homeschoolers - of any philosophy - so it would be great to meet other <br/>
homeschoolers in this area.  But if there are any unschoolers then that would be extra <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
Thanks a million<br/>
