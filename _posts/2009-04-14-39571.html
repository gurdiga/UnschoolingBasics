<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488669602">I&#39;d like to issue a personal plea to all posters - please please please <br/>
trim your posts - don&#39;t send the entirety of the post you&#39;re responding to <br/>
attached to your response. Please. :)   Many of us read on digest, and it&#39;s a <br/>
real chore sometimes trying to figure out where new posts start and end, or <br/>
worse trying to find the new content written in short little bits in the midst <br/>
of a previous long post.<br/>
<br/>
The *very* long post that started this conversation was very interesting to <br/>
read once, but it didn&#39;t need to be reposted another 20 or so times since <br/>
then. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks bunches!<br/>
