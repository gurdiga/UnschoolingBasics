<div id="ygrps-yiv-962517797">Hello list! My name&#39;s Stacy and I&#39;m mom to 3 great kids, Aidan 9, <br/>
Ashlyn 7, & Kian 13mos. We&#39;ve homeschooled from the beginning, but <br/>
after 4 years of relaxed school-at-home, we&#39;ve got issues. Somehow I <br/>
can take anything my kids are interested in and make it boring. <br/>
Mention a favorite game might have educational value, and they never <br/>
touch it again. Ask them to sit and do spelling or math, you know <br/>
the real important stuff ;), I get arguments and/or tears. This <br/>
isn&#39;t what I envisioned when I decided to educate my children at <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
So we just recently moved from a state with yearly testing to a <br/>
state that has very few restrictions, and I&#39;m thinking we should try <br/>
unschooling. I discounted it in the past as a really nice theory, <br/>
but something that wouldn&#39;t work for my family. I guess I didn&#39;t <br/>
really believe that my kids would learn what they needed by <br/>
unschooling. After reading several personal stories and lurking on <br/>
this list, I now realize that my idea of what my kids should be <br/>
learning is a little skewed and my assumption that unschooling was <br/>
just about education was completely off the mark. We&#39;re talking <br/>
total lifestyle change here! I don&#39;t have to only stop controlling <br/>
their education, I need to stop trying to control them!<br/>
<br/>
So my problem is how do you just suddenly let go and TRUST that <br/>
you&#39;re doing the right thing and the kids will learn what they need? <br/>
What should I be doing with myself? Should I be right there with <br/>
them all day long while they&#39;re playing? Should I encourage them to <br/>
watch a show with me or offer to read to them or play math games? <br/>
For instance, they&#39;ve been cooped up in my daughter&#39;s room since <br/>
yesterday playing barbies, only coming out occasionally to get a <br/>
snack or feed the pets. I can&#39;t go in there because the baby likes <br/>
to eat all those great barbie accessories, but I feel so guilty just <br/>
hanging out, surfing the net. I&#39;m really not sure they want me in <br/>
there anyway. What if they only want to play barbies and never show <br/>
an interest in the learning they&#39;ll need to get into college some <br/>
day (provided they want to go to college)? Please help, I feel like <br/>
I&#39;m on the verge of an anxiety attack! (I&#39;m only half joking. ;-))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033080786"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m on the verge of an anxiety attack! (I&#39;m only half joking. ;-))<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take a big deep breath. Now another. There. Now relax yourself. If <br/>
you&#39;re in panic mode, learning can&#39;t get in and you&#39;re more likely <br/>
to cling onto the flimsy branch you know than let go and FLY.<br/>
<br/>
First thing is don&#39;t do anything suddenly. Except maybe dropping the <br/>
textbook/workbook/&#39;school day&#39; stuff. That can go away and it can <br/>
be &#39;vacation time&#39;. All the rest of the control stuff (food, <br/>
bedtime, etc) needs to go slowly for everyone&#39;s sake or it&#39;ll get <br/>
really confusing and frustrating. Instead of an &quot;okay there are no <br/>
more rules&quot; pronouncement, just say Yes a whole lot more - &quot;Can we <br/>
stay up to watch one more show? Yes&quot; &quot;Can I have another freeze pop? <br/>
Yes&quot; and so on. Take a breath or two and think before answering No <br/>
to anything (except maybe &quot;No, don&#39;t use the baby as a speed bump&quot; <br/>
lol)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What they need&quot;? What *they* need or what the school system (which <br/>
is playing in your head) says they need? Those are usually different <br/>
things. The school system tapes say &quot;They have to learn <br/>
multiplication at age 8 and reading by age 6 and...&quot; Reality is that <br/>
those are tools to reach a goal not an end in themselves - which is <br/>
the way school is - you learn multiplication or reading because <br/>
someone else says so, not because you have a real life need for it <br/>
at the time. Do you go out and pound a dozen nails every day &quot;just <br/>
in case&quot; you need to do a bit of carpentry in 10 years? You&#39;ve <br/>
probably got plenty of other stuff to do I&#39;m sure - stuff that is <br/>
real and now and important to *you*.<br/>
<br/>
What to do with yourself: definitely spend some time with the kids. <br/>
Be involved with them sometimes. Be nearby sometimes - maybe read or <br/>
whatever in the big comfy chair while they&#39;re sprawled around the <br/>
living room watching Spongebob or snakes or Unwrapped or whatever. <br/>
Also spend time for yourself - get out the knitting or bonsai trees <br/>
or the bagpipes or whatever - something you&#39;ve put aside maybe or <br/>
something you&#39;ve wanted to explore for yourself. <br/>
<br/>
Live as though every day were vacation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if they only want to play barbies<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm fashion design, interior design, graphics, cosmetology, <br/>
screenwriting (soap operas for sure), and so on are all potential <br/>
directions that a love of barbies could go (and there are probably <br/>
zillions more. Get them barbie magazines. Find barbie websites for <br/>
them. And so on. barbie collectibles bring big bucks on ebay <br/>
sometimes. Oh and don&#39;t forget that sewing might be in there when <br/>
they want to expand the wardrobes and possibly carpentry (to make <br/>
miniature furnishings and such)...there&#39;s a whole world all <br/>
connected to barbie (where is malibu and why is malibu barbie so tan <br/>
and won&#39;t she get skin cancer and what is in sunscreen and ....) Be <br/>
prepared for lots of questions that you don&#39;t know the answers to <br/>
(there&#39;s no answer key to living life). Be willing to say I have no <br/>
idea but we can look it up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and never show <br/>
&gt; an interest in the learning they&#39;ll need to get into college some <br/>
&gt; day (provided they want to go to college)? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you&#39;re assuming their life for them a decade or more in advance. <br/>
Ten years ago would you have known that you&#39;d be living where you <br/>
are with a nice passel of kids? Do you know for sure what they&#39;ll <br/>
ned to know 10 years from now? Could you have imagined surfing the <br/>
Internet when you were their age? Computer skills are critical <br/>
today - and I graduated high school before the IBM PC was invented <br/>
and when I graduated college, I got a &quot;top of the line personal <br/>
computer&quot; as a gift - it was a Commodore 64! My college degree is in <br/>
Information Systems. Guess what I learned? Punch cards and IBM <br/>
Assembly language and Pascal and COBOL. Virtually NONE of what I <br/>
took in *college* has any relation to my current career. DH waited a <br/>
full decade after high school to consider college and choose to <br/>
leave a 5 figure salary to pursue something he was passionate about <br/>
via a college degree (that&#39;s where the resources he wanted were <br/>
lumped so that&#39;s where he went). Now he&#39;s a full time at home Dad, <br/>
by choice. He uses his degree on occasion. If you had asked him when <br/>
he graduated high school if he&#39;d ever have a college degree he&#39;d <br/>
have laughed at you. He got his high paying high tech job(s) without <br/>
so much as an ITT Tech certificate. The skills that got him those <br/>
jobs were those he learned *outside of school*.<br/>
<br/>
If you spend all your time now worrying about 10 years from now, <br/>
pretty soon it will BE 10 years from now and you&#39;ll have missed all <br/>
the now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So my problem is how do you just suddenly let go and TRUST that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start saying yes more and no less.  It&#39;s something you have to<br/>
deschool out of yourself as much as deschooling your kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What should I be doing with myself?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. What are your passions?  Seriously, your kids need to<br/>
see you involved in your passions as much as you need to see them<br/>
involved in their passions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Should I be right there with<br/>
&gt; them all day long while they&#39;re playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure.  Or as they want.  Let them get all the schooly stuff out of<br/>
their systems.  Your baby will be older then and you will be more<br/>
relaxed.  You can also play with them when the baby is napping or<br/>
after the baby has gone down for the evening (if you have such a<br/>
critter ;) )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Should I encourage them to<br/>
&gt; watch a show with me or offer to read to them or play math games?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they like math games.  We don&#39;t have any math games in our house,<br/>
but we do have games that one needs at least some math to do<br/>
(Monopoly, Life, etc.)  We don&#39;t play them to learn math.   We play<br/>
games because *games* are fun.  If they aren&#39;t fun then it is work.<br/>
I&#39;m not discounting that a math game can&#39;t be fun, just that they<br/>
aren&#39;t necessary to unschool.  Invite them into your world.  If you<br/>
have a show that interests you invite them to watch with you.  Want to<br/>
go somewhere that sounds fun, ask if they would like to join you.<br/>
Starting a new hobby or craft?  Maybe they would be interested as<br/>
well.  On the other hand, be involved in their world as well.  Help<br/>
them create new barbie fashions from their outgrown or tattered<br/>
clothes (or scraps of cloth or learn to knit some).  Help them make<br/>
dioramas for barbie adventures.  Have them outfit Barbie and all her<br/>
friends for an outdoor adventure and take them outin the yard(sans all<br/>
the itty bitty pieces that fall off easily and get chewed up by lawn<br/>
mowers).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m really not sure they want me in<br/>
&gt; there anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Might not right now if they associate you with schooling and being a<br/>
funsucker :-D  That will change as they trust that you aren&#39;t going to<br/>
turn every activity into a &quot;learning experience&quot; In that time you have<br/>
to trust that they will learn through playing and exploring.  What<br/>
wonderful creativity they must have if they can play constantly with<br/>
their dolls and not be bored!  Coming up for fresh air may happen in a<br/>
time near you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What if they only want to play barbies and never show<br/>
&gt; an interest in the learning they&#39;ll need to get into college some<br/>
&gt; day (provided they want to go to college)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go rent the movie Big with Tom Hanks (It&#39;s been playing on AMC and<br/>
Encore this month).  Seriously, this is a great unschooling movie.<br/>
Here&#39;s a &quot;kid&quot; who looks 30 and he knows toys best.  He gets a job<br/>
designing and testing toys.  My brother would have been great at a job<br/>
like that!  No college education, no high school education for that<br/>
matter.  Just a kid who &quot;grew up&quot; too fast.  (There are adult<br/>
situations in this movie)<br/>
<br/>
 Please help, I feel like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m on the verge of an anxiety attack! (I&#39;m only half joking. ;-))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Breathe in *and* out.  Repeat.  It&#39;s necessary.  :)  Baby steps and<br/>
remember, it doesn&#39;t have to look like school to mean something in<br/>
life!<br/>

references for answering questions you don&#39;t know the answers to <br/>
(but I&#39;m betting in about a year they&#39;ll be all dusty and ready to <br/>
go up onto ebay). If any of them really makes you get nervous <br/>
repeatedly, get rid of it fast. I gave away a few things I had <br/>
accumulated when DS was a baby &quot;just in case&quot; (like 100EZ lessons - <br/>
hey I found it on sale brand new for 30% off!lol) to our homeschool <br/>
group&#39;s lending library. I figure someone might want to look at it <br/>
before buying for themselves (and maybe they&#39;ll look at it and <br/>
decide not to buy any reading lessons at all lol).<br/>

no simply for your own convenience. If DS asks and I say No, it&#39;s <br/>
usually because I just don&#39;t want to do that. And that&#39;s okay - I&#39;ll <br/>
think about it, maybe ask a couple questions to define exactly what <br/>
it is he wants my participation to be, and decide if it is something <br/>
I am willing to do. Since No is considered and not constant <br/>
(sometimes I play, sometimes not, it depends on many factors, <br/>
including things like if he&#39;s asking me to play something long like <br/>
Monopoly or Risk at 10 pm). <br/>

curling up on the bed in the spare room to read while DH played <br/>
computer games on the computer in there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does this mean I no longer have an excuse for the dirty dishes in <br/>
&gt; the sink?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL - usually DH does the dishes at our house (he&#39;s home, I&#39;m at <br/>
work) but sometimes I&#39;ll do them. I make sure we&#39;ve got the dish <br/>
soap I like (the orange oil scented ones) and I&#39;ll treat it *as* a <br/>
treat - my guys will usually head off to play somewhere and I get <br/>
some quiet and I get to look out the back window and think long slow <br/>
thoughts. Sometimes I&#39;ll even use the time to pray if there&#39;s <br/>
something I need to really spend time praying on. Sometimes just <br/>
seeing the residue on the dishes can remind me of things <br/>
like &quot;that&#39;s the leftovers of DH&#39;s birthday cake - that was a nice <br/>
party - I&#39;m so glad to have him...&quot; or &quot;boy that chili was spicy!&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;m glad we had company over for pizza the other day&quot;. Sort of <br/>
triggers to being thankful instead of seeing it as a chore.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; See, this is part of the reason I&#39;m looking for another way to do <br/>
&gt; things. The kids aren&#39;t asking as many questions as they used to. <br/>
&gt;I <br/>
&gt; know it&#39;s my fault because I was always trying to turn every <br/>
&gt; question they had into some kind of a lesson. So I&#39;ve backed off <br/>
&gt;and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll start asking again. How do I handle it when <br/>
&gt;they <br/>
&gt; do ask? Just give a simple, strait-forward answer, then asking <br/>
&gt;them <br/>
&gt; if they&#39;d like to learn more? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>KISS lol &quot;Keep it simple Stacey&quot; If they want to know more, they&#39;ll <br/>
ask more. If the same types of questions keep coming up (for <br/>
instance, my DS kept asking why it&#39;s called... a window, a door, a <br/>
ceiling, a pillow, an armada, etc), find resources they can use - I <br/>
found a cool website that gives the etymology of hundreds of words <br/>
(you can search specifically or hit the first letter and scroll <br/>
through the list) and I bookmarked it on DS&#39; computer so he can <br/>
check stuff at will - he&#39;s somewhat independent from me (as <br/>
independent as he chooses - he can look it up, he can ask me if I <br/>
know, he can ask me to look it up). If you keep getting questions <br/>
about spiders, get a good field guide to spiders or bookmark a <br/>
website (or both).<br/>
