<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051749072">My kids are ages 6 and 9 and they play video games and watch tv all day. My<br/>
youngest will occasionally ask to do some headsprout or a little math. I<br/>
thought they&#39;d be done deschooling by now. My youngest has never been to<br/>
school but was in a preschool for a few months. My oldest was in school till<br/>
middle of second grade. My Dh is concerned cause he feels like they aren&#39;t<br/>
doing anything and that he&#39;d like to put them in private school. They have<br/>
said that they wouldn&#39;t mind going to school. I feel like I&#39;m failing them<br/>
too and that maybe I should start something more structured. Do you think<br/>
maybe if I limited tv/game time they&#39;d look for something else to do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208767445">Nope. I think if you offer interesting and fun stuff, they might  <br/>
choose something else. However, don&#39;t expect it to look like sitting  <br/>
at the table and doing math or headsprout. Expect it to look like  <br/>
crafts, or playing with dolls, or cutting up fabric to glue to  <br/>
posterboard.<br/>
<br/>
If you limit tv/game time, you&#39;re setting up a dynamic in which they  <br/>
feel deprived and they&#39;ll crave it even more. But they are saying  <br/>
that they want to do something else. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re house  <br/>
looks like or what&#39;s offered, but take a look at that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277619893">So - I&#39;m just a little bewildered by the apparent contradiction in  <br/>
your two posts, Stephanie.<br/>
<br/>
You say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids are ages 6 and 9 and they play video games and watch tv all  <br/>
day. My<br/>
youngest will occasionally ask to do some headsprout or a little math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But also you said this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, let&#39;s see they like to dance and asked for classes so they&#39;re in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you want to rephrase the first statement?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you meant - &quot;My kids spend more time playing video games and  <br/>
watching tv than I am comfortable with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think what I&#39;d suggest is that you get REALLY into those video games  <br/>
and tv watching with them. Get creative and find every possible way  <br/>
you can figure out to enhance their game playing and tv watching.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want ideas for that?<br/>

What games are they playing? My 10yo ds is so into World Of Warcraft<br/>
and it is not deschooling, it is his main pastime. I have played with<br/>
him, chatted about it, discussed how he gets new gear and honour<br/>
points. Before that the whole family got into watching him play Dark<br/>
Cloud 2 on PS2, excellent game, we watched it like a movie unfolding<br/>
and never wanted to miss when he got to a new place!<br/>
<br/>
If they like to dance, we have been using Project Playlist on the<br/>
computer, when someone thinks of a good song, we find it and mostly<br/>
the kids, and us are up dancing, even the one who was on the computer<br/>
in the first place. At the minute we are into finding cool songs in<br/>
different languages!<br/>
<br/>
Also we just started Alice Greenfingers on computer, the whole family<br/>
lke it. If you spend time with them while they do what they do, you<br/>
will see the math, logic, reading, time management, puzzle-solving<br/>
that goes on in most good quality games.<br/>

 Do you think maybe if I limited tv/game time they&#39;d look for something else to do?<br/>

If you limited the time I spent cooking, do you think I&#39;d look for something else to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I might start looking for more ways to get into the kitchen when you were gone. I might start <br/>
<br/>
sneaking in late at <br/>
<br/>
night to play in the kitchen. I might start watching more of the cooking channel. I might spend a <br/>
<br/>
lot of time reading cookbooks. Looking up recipes on the internet. Talking about casseroles with <br/>
<br/>
my friends and being envious of *their* time in the kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My time would certainly be *better* spent actually *cooking*, and I&#39;d probably resent that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
allowed to wear my apron or fire up my skillet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, I would probably look for something else to do.<br/>

Wow, that&#39;s a lot of different games! Its important to see that he&#39;s <br/>
playing *different things* rather than lump them all together into <br/>
your mind as &quot;video games&quot;. Each game has its own themes, characters, <br/>
and progression. <br/>
<br/>
I notice he&#39;s playing two different lego games - does he like legos <br/>
in general or is he more interested in those games as easier versions <br/>
of role playing games? You could certainly do more with legos as well <br/>
as all his characters outside of the games - decor, food, plus any <br/>
lego playsets that allow you to build characters from those games. <br/>
Has he discovered lego.com? Lots of fun stuff, there:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the most important &quot;first step&quot; is to make a concious effort <br/>
to spend part of every day watching and/or playing with them. Watch <br/>
them play video games the same way you would watch them play dress <br/>
up, or build with legos - interact as much as they want (or stay out <br/>
of the way as much as they want!) but soak up their fascination, <br/>
enthusiasm and joy. Chit chat about the games, characters, difficult <br/>
bits later on, too, the way you might about an interesting story you <br/>
were reading together. <br/>
<br/>
Tv, too - although with tv there may be more opportunities to chat <br/>
during the show. With tv it helps to try to step away from your &quot;mom <br/>
brain&quot; a little while you&#39;re watching and respond to the shows the <br/>
way you would if watching with a friend, as opposed to thinking &quot;is <br/>
this okay for kids? am I okay with them watching it?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If part of your concern is that they aren&#39;t getting enough exercise, <br/>
find ways for them to be active while watching/playing. Mini <br/>
trampoline, exercise ball, roller blades, tread mill... anything you <br/>
can think of that will fit in your home! If you can afford it, look <br/>
for hand-held versions of games that they can take outside to play <br/>
when the weather is nice.<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own projects into the same room as the tv. Hang out <br/>
together, each doing your own thing. They may get interested in what <br/>
you&#39;re doing or not - but they are far more likely to be interested <br/>
than if you&#39;re off in another part of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Look for ways to bring the characters and themes of their favorite <br/>
shows/games into other aspects of life. For example, Mo likes to wear <br/>
her hair the way some of the girls in pokemom shows do - either with <br/>
the bangs hanging over her eyes or two big pony tails. Okay, normal <br/>
little girl hair styles, but to *her* its &quot;Pokemon trainer hair&quot; and <br/>
that&#39;s what&#39;s important. She has a blue striped sweater that we call <br/>
her &quot;Blues Clues&quot; sweater, even though its *just* a blue striped <br/>
sweater, not something marketed for the show. She has special jumps <br/>
on the trampoline that are inspired by the show and game &quot;Avatar&quot;. <br/>
The important thing is to celebrate what interests your kids, however <br/>
you can!<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are wanting to do other things, make a wish list. Make <br/>
some plans. Recently my kids were complaining that George wasn&#39;t <br/>
spending enough time with them - they&#39;re so independent that he had <br/>
fallen into the habit of getting sucked in to his own projects. So I <br/>
talked with the kids and with George and came up with some ideas. I <br/>
dug out some old books, pulled out some boxes of stuff from storage <br/>
and did a little extra strewing. I sent out a plea to the <br/>
grandparents to send xmas presents a little sooner if they were <br/>
project sorts of things (grandma sent a volcano kit...oooooohhhhh, <br/>
ahhhhhhh!). I did some extra cleaning, which always helps motivate <br/>
people in my family.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, this is when its important to bring projects To the kids -<br/>
 into the same room, anyway. For example, George will set up paints <br/>
and just start painting for his own enjoyment. Mo often comes and <br/>
joins him, but he doesn&#39;t coax her. He just makes sure she knows its <br/>
happening. He might also go set up the trains just for kicks - he&#39;s a <br/>
longtime train fan, and even though these are pretty low-key trains, <br/>
he likes to play with them now and again. This past week he and Mo <br/>
have been talking about &quot;train furniture&quot; - making houses and bridges <br/>
and tunnels for the trains. The important thing to keep in mind with <br/>
all this is the idea *isn&#39;t* to lure kids away from the tv or video <br/>
games. The idea is to lay out options without any pressure (a kind of <br/>
strewing) so your kids are making real choices, not just defaulting <br/>
to the most obvious, simplest thing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506178282">&lt;&lt;Do you think maybe if I limited tv/game time they&#39;d look for <br/>
something else to do?<br/>

My kids have never been to school, and I tried not limiting their TV <br/>
or computer usage for the first 3 years of them using them. Here&#39;s <br/>
our experience...<br/>
<br/>
My kids weren&#39;t much interested in TV at first. They preferred to <br/>
play together...often for hours without fighting. I didn&#39;t turn the <br/>
TV on myself, so they just didn&#39;t know much about it. I did play some <br/>
videos and DVDs for them that were kids shows in other languages (my <br/>
kids are Korean and Chinese). They enjoyed them but usually preferred <br/>
to go back to playing after seeing one instead of seeing another or <br/>
the same one over again. <br/>
<br/>
Then one Summer, while on vacation, they discoverd PBSKids on TV and <br/>
fell in love. They watched quite a bit of PBSKids, not exploring <br/>
anything outside of that (on TV) for about a year. Since PBSKids (at <br/>
least in our area) stops kid programming at 6pm in the evenings, and <br/>
has very little weekend programming for kids, they couldn&#39;t watch <br/>
endless hours of it. They often turned it off voluntarily during the <br/>
day, too, when shows came on they weren&#39;t interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Then the following Summer we went to Panama and they found the <br/>
Discovery Kids channel...which, at least in Panama, showed PBSKids <br/>
and Noggin shows. Most of the shows were in English (with Spanish <br/>
subtitles), so they were able to learn about new shows that they <br/>
assumed they would be able to see at home. When we returned home, <br/>
they asked about a few shows they had seen and we found them on <br/>
Noggin. Noggin shortly became my daughter&#39;s almost constant <br/>
companion. My son watched it some, too, but preferred DVDs. I tried <br/>
letting my daughter regulate her own TV viewing, even when I felt it <br/>
was excessive, without my input (I said nothing about how I felt). My <br/>
son&#39;s movie viewing went up and down. He played more than viewed. <br/>
Then he found Sponge Bob. (Ugh.) <br/>
<br/>
After about a year of this, with the TV viewing getting heavier and <br/>
heavier, and the behavior getting worse and worse (screaming and <br/>
crying fits when the TV got turned off when we left the house, etc.), <br/>
I decided to try a different approach. I asked my kids what their <br/>
favorite shows were. We looked at the schedule to see what time they <br/>
came on, and we turned off the TV when one of these shows wasn&#39;t on.  <br/>
<br/>
The result has been MUCH more pretend play, MUCH more playing <br/>
together (with WAY LESS fighting), and they turn off the TVs <br/>
voluntarily now in order to play. No complaining, no crying fits, no <br/>
screaming. There is peace. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is our experience. I think you just have to feel out <br/>
what works for your family. Try different things, and also try to get <br/>
your kids&#39; input about the situation. &quot;Laying down the law&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>
appear to be very successful, in my opinion. I also try to include my <br/>
kids in decisions about their lives, and I always give them options <br/>
and ideas.<br/>
