The kids have made their choice, just as you have. At least for now. And that&#39;s that.<br/>

He needs to respect the choices that have been made, as he agreed. <br/>

How do we handle this, <br/>
and let dh know in a nice way, that he shouldn&#39;t push, and when the <br/>
kids are ready they will let him know? <br/>

<br/>
Thank you, and I totally agree.  I know he&#39;s hurting,<br/>
and I can totally understand that, but wouldn&#39;t the<br/>
kids be hurting if he forced them to go?<br/>
<br/>
I stand by whatever decisions the kids have made. <br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
