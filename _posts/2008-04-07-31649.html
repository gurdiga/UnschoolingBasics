<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427416037">Hi Robiin,<br/>
<br/>
My son, Quentin, attended 2 years ago when he was ten.  He did check out the<br/>
video game room & played<br/>
a bit of the Mario game on gamecube.  And did connect with someone - but<br/>
didn&#39;t know his name &lt;g&gt;,<br/>
and he never saw him again that weekend.    He was intimidated by the Halo<br/>
players and so didn&#39;t play that, which is<br/>
his favorite game of alltime.  In hindsight, I should have stayed there with<br/>
him & got him included in a game, but<br/>
he said he didn&#39;t want me to do that.  He stayed in his room & watched a lot<br/>
of tv & played his ds.<br/>
He did get out and swim with his dad.  And he did go to the water games<br/>
session &lt;fun!&gt;, but that was<br/>
 just with his little sister and her new friend, Asher.<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;d enjoy it more now because he&#39;s &quot;met&quot; some unschoolers on the<br/>
unschool gamers forum that<br/>
he plays with on Xbox Live.  If they were at the conference, he&#39;d go already<br/>
having friends...<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;m wondering how this conference would be for our son, 10 years old.<br/>
&gt; We started hs-ing and unschooling last Fall, and are still<br/>
&gt; deschooling to some extent. He is just beginning to be interested in<br/>
&gt; something besides being by himself with tv, and electronic games. He<br/>
&gt; still spends most of his time in that way. He has alwasy been slow to<br/>
&gt; warm up to a new crowd - real slow. So, though this conference sounds<br/>
&gt; great to me, what would it be like for him? What do 10-year old boys<br/>
&gt; do there?<br/>
