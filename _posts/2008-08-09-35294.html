<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177647115">OK that subject line doesn&#39;t sound quite right but I think you&#39;ll<br/>
understand my &quot;mental&quot; dilemma.  Here it is:   last year I had my<br/>
child go to kindergarten, but by mid-January we (my son and I) decided<br/>
to stay home....  FREEDOM<br/>
<br/>
Yet, my son has been wanting to go back.. I think it maybe the &#39;words&#39;<br/>
he has heard from his not for homeschooling/unschooling grandma and<br/>
his dad (who he see often -every other weekend for sure -- even though<br/>
he was ok with me homeschooling since I have a teaching degree:)  <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my mental dilemma -- send him to school or not!!  I flop<br/>
back in forth .  I really want to keep him home I found a great<br/>
diverse hs group that I just love and he&#39;s clicked with the kids and I<br/>
would like to see him grow in this group.  But if he is feeling like<br/>
he is missing something by not going to school I don&#39;t want to do that<br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought to myself --well I&#39;m the mother and we haven&#39;t even given<br/>
it a full year -- blah, blah<br/>
<br/>
Yet...  I&#39;m also worried I&#39;ll send him then he will want to come home<br/>
yet again and that will bring big attention to me from the school, and<br/>
dad etc..... <br/>
<br/>
any thoughts mine are becoming jumbled....</div>

Does he need more friends? does he want to ride the big yellow bus?<br/>
Does he want more activities? Does he want to do more things on his own?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501754298">That doesn&#39;t mean he wants to do schooly things.  I&#39;m not there but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like pride.  When children go to school a big part of the<br/>
feelings about their own competence become related in their minds with<br/>
school performance and academics.  It takes quite a bit of adjustment to<br/>
figure out what he wants.  Just go toward what he finds enjoyable or<br/>
relaxing or FUN: swimming, playing in any way he likes whether it&#39;s with<br/>
legos, in the dirt, video games, TV, talking, fingerpainting, blowing<br/>
bubbles, whatever.<br/>

meeting with other kids-- but only if he seems to want to.  Sometimes<br/>
changing everything all at once (which is ideal in most ways) is a lot to<br/>
acclimate to.  All of a sudden, his friends are back in school and he&#39;s<br/>
not.  It&#39;s normal to feel out of sorts with wholesale changes, and children<br/>
are either in school or they&#39;re not.  Not much middle ground to gradually<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160878834">Since *you* are unsure about whether or not he can be happy at home, it&#39;s<br/>
difficult if not impossible to convey that it&#39;s a happy thing.  Children are<br/>
like metal detectors sense the presence of negative vibes because they look<br/>
to adults to feel out situations.<br/>
<br/>
Putting on a happy face when you&#39;re feeling unsure might help to some<br/>
degree.  At the very least you can have the attitude of making an effort<br/>
that is thoroughgoing rather than half-hearted.  Let&#39;s try it!  How else are<br/>
you going to know if it&#39;s for you?<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I would find ways to grow in confidence within myself about<br/>
*why* it&#39;s good.  One way is to read about it... another way is to meetup<br/>
with other unschoolers.  And I&#39;m sure there are many other things to do<br/>
besides that.  I know me..... I would want some knowledge!  And then I could<br/>
make decisions about how I feel about it.  Others need different experiences<br/>
in order to feel comfortable about unschooling because they want different<br/>
kinds of information.<br/>

&gt; What you&#39;re going through sounds like what is spoken of at this list as the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; beginnings of de-schooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Until you&#39;re sure, your indecision around the subject will communicate a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to your child that is negative about having your child with you instead of<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942632965">We are also in the beginning stages of unschooling (still deschooling, I&#39;m sure) and my youngest is &quot;wanting&quot; to go back to school as well.  He is only five, but has been in school-type settings (early intervention preschool and TONS of therapy for ASD -- none of which we do now) since he was 2.  In talking with him, I have asked him if he really wanted to go to school or if he just wanted to stay home.  Eventually, he admitted that he wants to stay home and play.  He is a very agreeable child and loves to write, so I think he saw school as the place where he was allowed to write all the time and then got to play.  Knowing what he loves (things that seem &quot;schooly&quot;), I have made sure that we do arts and craft activities during the day, read lots of books, play outside, and write notes, lists, stories, etc.  As the other posters have also mentioned, I have made sure that on the days we can, that we have friends over.  Of course, those friends don&#39;t<br/>
 resemble the age-specific group he would have at school, but I think that is good.  He loves interacting with both older and younger kids -- which I think is more like the real world.  <br/>
Remember, you know your child best.  If you truly believe that having him at home with you is best for him, then it IS best for him.  Trust yourself and he will trust you too.  Good luck!<br/>

That doesn&#39;t mean he wants to do schooly things. I&#39;m not there but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like pride. When children go to school a big part of the<br/>
feelings about their own competence become related in their minds with<br/>
school performance and academics. It takes quite a bit of adjustment to<br/>
figure out what he wants. Just go toward what he finds enjoyable or<br/>
relaxing or FUN: swimming, playing in any way he likes whether it&#39;s with<br/>
legos, in the dirt, video games, TV, talking, fingerpainting, blowing<br/>
bubbles, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If he seems to be missing his school friends, you might be able to arrange<br/>
for some get togethers. Other than that if it were me, I would continue<br/>
meeting with other kids-- but only if he seems to want to. Sometimes<br/>
changing everything all at once (which is ideal in most ways) is a lot to<br/>
acclimate to. All of a sudden, his friends are back in school and he&#39;s<br/>
not. It&#39;s normal to feel out of sorts with wholesale changes, and children<br/>
are either in school or they&#39;re not. Not much middle ground to gradually<br/>
move through.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have experience dealing with taking a child out of school because<br/>
Karl has never gone to school. There are plenty of others here who do have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t be defensive, first of all. When he talks about &quot;my school&quot; - go  <br/>
with it. Say, &quot;Yeah, that WAS what your teacher said.&quot; Just let him  <br/>
own that experience without any sense of your judgment about it.  <br/>
Sounds like he&#39;s looking back and processing what happened. If you  <br/>
stay neutrally agreeable, you&#39;ll hear more of his thinking than  <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Do more stuff with the hsing group you&#39;ve clicked with - do some  <br/>
really fun things in the next week - call up a couple of his friends  <br/>
from the group and get together during the day. Mention gently to him  <br/>
that you won&#39;t be able to see much of them if he decides to go to  <br/>
school. What I&#39;m saying, is to help him really understand what he&#39;ll  <br/>
be giving up - picturing what a decision will mean, how it will play  <br/>
out, is not easy - help him with that.<br/>
<br/>
And if he decides to go, make sure you are both in agreement that he  <br/>
can stop going. Tell other adults in his/your life that you are going  <br/>
to experiment with it, but you&#39;re not committing to it and may change  <br/>
your mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290006753">I am new here to this group and to unschooling (we have been doign just <br/>
the schooly type since May and just switched to unschooling), but I <br/>
wanted to add a suggestion in here.  I had been concerned about my <br/>
daughter b/c she missed her friends from school.. I dont know any of <br/>
the parents to set up playdates or visits.. my dd is 8 yo by the way.. <br/>
we got her signed up for dance class again - where she will see some of <br/>
her old classmates.. and I also decided to start letting her go to the <br/>
skating rink on Fridays (all the local kids go there on Friday night - <br/>
it&#39;s a very small town so its safe and we know the owners of the <br/>
rink).. that is another opportunity to socialize and to see the friends <br/>
she missed.. perhaps you have similar things going on in the <br/>
community.. or even going to the area parks after ps lets out to let <br/>
her play with her peers.. I think it will make a world of difference.<br/>

            Since *you* are unsure about whether or not he can be happy at home, it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
difficult if not impossible to convey that it&#39;s a happy thing.  Children are<br/>
<br/>
like metal detectors sense the presence of negative vibes because they look<br/>
<br/>
to adults to feel out situations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Putting on a happy face when you&#39;re feeling unsure might help to some<br/>
<br/>
degree.  At the very least you can have the attitude of making an effort<br/>
<br/>
that is thoroughgoing rather than half-hearted.  Let&#39;s try it!  How else are<br/>
<br/>
you going to know if it&#39;s for you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I would find ways to grow in confidence within myself about<br/>
<br/>
*why* it&#39;s good.  One way is to read about it... another way is to meetup<br/>
<br/>
with other unschoolers.  And I&#39;m sure there are many other things to do<br/>
<br/>
besides that.  I know me..... I would want some knowledge!  And then I could<br/>
<br/>
make decisions about how I feel about it.  Others need different experiences<br/>
<br/>
in order to feel comfortable about unschooling because they want different<br/>
<br/>
kinds of information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682632491">My son (now 5) went through periods of this for a while even after <br/>
just one semester of preschool at age 3. I used to have a lot of fear <br/>
about him wanting to go to school before I had a chance to get us to <br/>
the free and happy unschooling life I had embraced in theory but not <br/>
yet fully in practice. Initially, joining a homeschool co-op helped <br/>
some as he had/has a place he can call his &quot;school&quot; with a &quot;teacher&quot; <br/>
(he does a Spanish class) and a playground. But I would feel <br/>
threatened when he talked about wanting to go back to preschool or <br/>
eventually to a school for bigger kids- I could feel it in the pit of <br/>
my stomach and knew my visceral reaction meant my thinking around <br/>
this was not clear and positive and he fully picked up on that <br/>
energy. But for a long time I had a really hard time figuring out how <br/>
to shift it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually just recognized recently what a big shift has happened <br/>
for us in this and it was reflected in a conversation we just had as <br/>
he&#39;s reacting to all the talk of friends going back to school soon. <br/>
It went something like:<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;Mom, I&#39;m not going to go to the school yet where I ride the <br/>
school bus, right?&quot; <br/>
Me: &quot;Yeah, you want to go back to your school in Munster&quot; (our weekly <br/>
homeschool co-op)<br/>
J: &quot;yeah&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;I was thinking you don&#39;t ever have to go to that school where <br/>
you ride the school bus because you&#39;d have to go every day, all day <br/>
long. But you don&#39;t have to go to that school to ride a school bus. <br/>
Hey, how about we ride a school bus to go to the fair today? <br/>
(Beautiful serendipity- we had plans to go to the county fair and I <br/>
knew they were running school buses as shuttles from the remote <br/>
parking)<br/>
J: &quot;But I want to ride one that picks us up at our house&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Well, they do that for kids that go to school every day- it <br/>
picks up everyone at their house and takes them to their school.&quot;<br/>
J: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;So should we check out the school bus that will take us to the <br/>
fair?&quot;<br/>
J: &quot;Yeah!&quot; (with big excited smile)<br/>
 <br/>
He loved it btw and I loved him loving it. I don&#39;t know if that <br/>
dialogue depicts the ease and lightness I felt in this conversation <br/>
with him, but that was the big difference. I feel much more confident <br/>
about the life we&#39;re creating and the fear of him wanting school has <br/>
dissipated over this year or so as we moved toward unschooling. We <br/>
had come from a pretty controlling place so I think trust-building <br/>
has been a big part of it and of course actually living what I *Know* <br/>
to be a free and happy life is the other part. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how we might have come to this place faster since it&#39;s <br/>
such a path and a process. But I know your question really helped me <br/>
to analyze where I was (and wasn&#39;t) in a way I couldn&#39;t at the time, <br/>
so maybe that will help you in some way. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>He really may not have a specific answer.  School is a big part of our <br/>
society.  Not only does he see it in his own community, but he sees it <br/>
on tv and in games.  Also, if he talks with kids in school, they see it <br/>
as a big part of their lives and will likely act freaked out if they <br/>
meet someone who doesn&#39;t do the same things that is expected of them.  <br/>
My children have all gotten negative comments from their friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Just recently, my dd16 who chose to not return to high school this week <br/>
was blasted by a very dear friend of hers.  It had her in tears.  He <br/>
told her she was going to be stupid and never amount to anything, she&#39;d <br/>
never make it to college and certainly wouldn&#39;t have a good job outside <br/>
of flipping burgers.  I had to help her realize that he was voicing his <br/>
own fears about himself because he needs to believe all that stuff or <br/>
face the possibility that what he&#39;s been doing for years and plans to <br/>
continue doing is really not necessary.  We&#39;ve encountered that type of <br/>
attitude from kids of all ages, not just teens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Often He will say things like : that&#39;s how we did at my school..<br/>

&gt; if he wanted??  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it isn&#39;t pride, but just experience.  How many years has he been <br/>
on this earth?  Everything he&#39;s personally done is his own experience.  <br/>
Be careful not to look at him through your experiences because he is <br/>
not you.  <br/>
<br/>
When my youngest would say things like that, I would try to direct her <br/>
to see the positives of being home without putting down school.  You <br/>
could say something like &#39;Oh, you did that in school?  Cool!  We can do <br/>
that at home anytime you want too.&#39;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225568832">Hi there! This post is long and kinda goes off on tangents, but it�s good.<br/>
I�m excited and refreshed and thought I would share my enthusiasm. J I�m new<br/>
to this list and unschooling, though not necessarily homeschooling. My<br/>
daughters, 6 & 8 years old, were both diagnosed with ASD as toddlers as<br/>
well. I spent the first several years doing much of the �therapy� in our<br/>
home by myself. My children have always benefitted from child-directed<br/>
learning. In fact, they resisted anything else. I am currently finishing a<br/>
master�s degree in behavior analysis (which I also have an undergrad degree<br/>
in). I would set up simple contingencies for my children (something like,<br/>
�say nana� and if they did they could have the banana) and their behavior<br/>
patterns looked like behavior under aversive control (coercion), which is<br/>
not at all what I meant to do. I just wanted to help my kids learn to talk.<br/>
I learned quickly to set up our environment in a way that promoted learning<br/>
and to gently lead my children to activities that might interest them (�Hey<br/>
girls, I found this neat butterfly art kit at the store! Wanna play with<br/>
me?�). If they *were* interested, I used that opportunity to help them<br/>
expand their language and knowledge. So, the unschooling philosophy<br/>
resonates with me because it appears to involve placing things in your<br/>
child�s environment that will promote learning and helping them expand their<br/>
repertoire based on their interests and assent, and also rapport building<br/>
(or, always putting the relationship first). Those are two of my favorite<br/>
parts of behavior analytic technologies. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, the school years have been very hard on all of us so far. I was<br/>
constantly having to advocate for my children (which parents always do, but<br/>
jeez� it gets tiresome to always be at odds with the school district), and<br/>
my older one especially was suffering physically and mentally from her<br/>
experience. She had stomach problems, behavior issues, she was sick ALL the<br/>
time� It was totally different from when they were home with me until<br/>
kindergarten and during the summers. She did not like school. She found it<br/>
incredibly aversive. To have come so far, despite all of the challenges<br/>
she�s faced, made me so proud of her. It hurt my heart to see all her<br/>
sparkle and love for life disappear. Last year was my younger daughter�s<br/>
first year of school. She felt compelled to keep up with her classmates. If<br/>
she couldn�t read as well as one of her classmates, for example, she would<br/>
steal his reading assignment  and try to decode it under the table during<br/>
�free� time. She was also suffering mentally from the pressures and<br/>
expectations. So, school is not okay for us. I want my children to be able<br/>
to choose whatever they want, but when my older daughter says she wants to<br/>
go back to school, I know she is not choosing academic pressure and stomach<br/>
aches and coercion. In her case, I know she just misses her friends. I take<br/>
that as a cue that she doesn�t feel like she�s had enough socialization<br/>
lately and make a lot of effort to connect with old friends or make new<br/>
ones. (Interestingly, my younger daughter does not have the intense need for<br/>
socialization that my older one does and, despite having a natural affinity<br/>
for all things academic, has NO desire to go back to school this fall.) So,<br/>
perhaps your son is just experiencing something similar. I thought everyone<br/>
gave really great advice, and I�m sure you have a bunch of ideas now. I just<br/>
wanted to let you know you�re not alone. J<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now I will go off on a tangent� I�ve read a lot of well controlled,<br/>
convincing research over the last 8 years or so, and I feel like sharing (I<br/>
hope that�s ok). The unschooling philosophy appears to be extremely<br/>
consistent with what I�ve learned at university about behavior. People that<br/>
operate under aversive control (threats), to escape or avoid negative<br/>
consequences (�Johnny, if you don�t stop right now, you�re going to time<br/>
out�), often engage in behavior that is hostile or aggressive; have strong<br/>
emotional responses; and seek to counter-control (either overtly by saying<br/>
�you can�t make me!�, or covertly through sabotage or under-achievement).<br/>
People that operate under punishment contingencies (instead of threatening<br/>
to put Johnny in time out, mom spanks him) seek to AVOID the punisher.<br/>
That�s so powerful to me. Do I really want my children to associate me with<br/>
power struggles? Do I want them to associate me with punishment, so that *I*<br/>
become a punisher and they seek to avoid me? I�ve learned that antecedent<br/>
strategies (putting something in the environment that will promote behavior)<br/>
is much more desirable than placing consequences (good or bad) on behavior.<br/>
By loving children unconditionally and allowing the environment to produce<br/>
the consequences instead of socially mediating, parents can associate<br/>
themselves with joy. J The environment then, according to the child�s<br/>
interests and talents, will select behaviors that function for the child. If<br/>
a child is not inherently �sporty�, the environment will probably not select<br/>
�sporty� behaviors, even if the child is exposed to sports. By that, I mean,<br/>
the environment (sports) will not provide consequences that are valuable to<br/>
the child.  By *making* the child be involved in sports against their will<br/>
to teach them �teamwork� or whatever else feels justified, people create an<br/>
aversive environment that the child will work to avoid. By allowing the<br/>
environment to provide the consequences, children do not rely on socially<br/>
mediated (arbitrary) consequences. You can be sure, then, that everything<br/>
they pursue is intrinsically valuable to them. They will be much happier and<br/>
their families will be much happier as a result. Everyone still operates<br/>
under *some* aversive control (like speeding tickets. Basically every law we<br/>
have is enforced by aversive control). There is no way to avoid it<br/>
completely. But, I can avoid being the source of aversive control for my<br/>
children and create an environment that promotes mutual respect (instead of<br/>
fear) and trust. *I* choose that!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks for reading. J<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Almost. I think it&#39;s more helpful to think in terms of &quot;placing  <br/>
things in your child�s environment that might interest them.&quot; *Trust*  <br/>
that what interests them they will learn from. But the learning won&#39;t  <br/>
look like school learning. It won&#39;t coincide with what we expect them  <br/>
to learn in schools, or what we think is important to learn. It will  <br/>
look like play and fun and enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
At first unschooling looks like a way to trick kids into learning by  <br/>
placing fun things around them they could learn from. But it will  <br/>
help people grasp unschooling faster to keep their own agenda to fun  <br/>
and feeding the kids&#39; interests and giving them opportunities to  <br/>
expand their interests. Treat a book about George Washington the same  <br/>
way you would a new cartoon. Is it something they might enjoy? If  <br/>
they say &quot;No, thanks&quot; will you have some emotional attachment to  <br/>
their answer?<br/>

A suggestion that was made to me for socialization. Start your own local homeschool support group. My husband and I have discussed this and once we are in our new home we will start one. For us we will probably use the local library since ours also has a play ground.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I am new here to this group and to unschooling (we have been doign just <br/>
the schooly type since May and just switched to unschooling) , but I <br/>
wanted to add a suggestion in here.  I had been concerned about my <br/>
daughter b/c she missed her friends from school.. I dont know any of <br/>
the parents to set up playdates or visits.. my dd is 8 yo by the way.. <br/>
we got her signed up for dance class again - where she will see some of <br/>
her old classmates.. and I also decided to start letting her go to the <br/>
skating rink on Fridays (all the local kids go there on Friday night - <br/>
it&#39;s a very small town so its safe and we know the owners of the <br/>
rink).. that is another opportunity to socialize and to see the friends <br/>
she missed.. perhaps you have similar things going on in the <br/>
community.. or even going to the area parks after ps lets out to let <br/>
her play with her peers.. I think it will make a world of difference.<br/>

&gt; Hi there! This post is long and kinda goes off on tangents,<br/>
&gt; but it’s good.<br/>
&gt; I’m excited and refreshed and thought I would share my<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm. J I’m new<br/>
&gt; to this list and unschooling, though not necessarily<br/>
&gt; homeschooling. My<br/>
&gt; daughters, 6 & 8 years old, were both diagnosed with<br/>
&gt; ASD as toddlers as<br/>
&gt; well. I spent the first several years doing much of the<br/>
&gt; “therapy” in our<br/>
&gt; home by myself. My children have always benefitted from<br/>
&gt; child-directed<br/>
&gt; learning. In fact, they resisted anything else. I am<br/>
&gt; currently finishing a<br/>
&gt; master’s degree in behavior analysis (which I also have<br/>
&gt; an undergrad degree<br/>
&gt; in). I would set up simple contingencies for my children<br/>
&gt; (something like,<br/>
&gt; “say nana” and if they did they could have the banana)<br/>
&gt; and their behavior<br/>
&gt; patterns looked like behavior under aversive control<br/>
&gt; (coercion), which is<br/>
&gt; not at all what I meant to do. I just wanted to help my<br/>
&gt; kids learn to talk.<br/>
&gt; I learned quickly to set up our environment in a way that<br/>
&gt; promoted learning<br/>
&gt; and to gently lead my children to activities that might<br/>
&gt; interest them (“Hey<br/>
&gt; girls, I found this neat butterfly art kit at the store!<br/>
&gt; Wanna play with<br/>
&gt; me?”). If they *were* interested, I used that opportunity<br/>
&gt; to help them<br/>
&gt; expand their language and knowledge. So, the unschooling<br/>
&gt; philosophy<br/>
&gt; resonates with me because it appears to involve placing<br/>
&gt; things in your<br/>
&gt; child’s environment that will promote learning and<br/>
&gt; helping them expand their<br/>
&gt; repertoire based on their interests and assent, and also<br/>
&gt; rapport building<br/>
&gt; (or, always putting the relationship first). Those are two<br/>
&gt; of my favorite<br/>
&gt; parts of behavior analytic technologies. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, the school years have been very hard on all of us<br/>
&gt; so far. I was<br/>
&gt; constantly having to advocate for my children (which<br/>
&gt; parents always do, but<br/>
&gt; jeez… it gets tiresome to always be at odds with the<br/>
&gt; school district), and<br/>
&gt; my older one especially was suffering physically and<br/>
&gt; mentally from her<br/>
&gt; experience. She had stomach problems, behavior issues, she<br/>
&gt; was sick ALL the<br/>
&gt; time… It was totally different from when they were home<br/>
&gt; with me until<br/>
&gt; kindergarten and during the summers. She did not like<br/>
&gt; school. She found it<br/>
&gt; incredibly aversive. To have come so far, despite all of<br/>
&gt; the challenges<br/>
&gt; she’s faced, made me so proud of her. It hurt my heart to<br/>
&gt; see all her<br/>
&gt; sparkle and love for life disappear. Last year was my<br/>
&gt; younger daughter’s<br/>
&gt; first year of school. She felt compelled to keep up with<br/>
&gt; her classmates. If<br/>
&gt; she couldn’t read as well as one of her classmates, for<br/>
&gt; example, she would<br/>
&gt; steal his reading assignment  and try to decode it under<br/>
&gt; the table during<br/>
&gt; “free” time. She was also suffering mentally from the<br/>
&gt; pressures and<br/>
&gt; expectations. So, school is not okay for us. I want my<br/>
&gt; children to be able<br/>
&gt; to choose whatever they want, but when my older daughter<br/>
&gt; says she wants to<br/>
&gt; go back to school, I know she is not choosing academic<br/>
&gt; pressure and stomach<br/>
&gt; aches and coercion. In her case, I know she just misses her<br/>
&gt; friends. I take<br/>
&gt; that as a cue that she doesn’t feel like she’s had<br/>
&gt; enough socialization<br/>
&gt; lately and make a lot of effort to connect with old friends<br/>
&gt; or make new<br/>
&gt; ones. (Interestingly, my younger daughter does not have the<br/>
&gt; intense need for<br/>
&gt; socialization that my older one does and, despite having a<br/>
&gt; natural affinity<br/>
&gt; for all things academic, has NO desire to go back to school<br/>
&gt; this fall.) So,<br/>
&gt; perhaps your son is just experiencing something similar. I<br/>
&gt; thought everyone<br/>
&gt; gave really great advice, and I’m sure you have a bunch<br/>
&gt; of ideas now. I just<br/>
&gt; wanted to let you know you’re not alone. J<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I will go off on a tangent… I’ve read a lot of well<br/>
&gt; controlled,<br/>
&gt; convincing research over the last 8 years or so, and I feel<br/>
&gt; like sharing (I<br/>
&gt; hope that’s ok). The unschooling philosophy appears to be<br/>
&gt; extremely<br/>
&gt; consistent with what I’ve learned at university about<br/>
&gt; behavior. People that<br/>
&gt; operate under aversive control (threats), to escape or<br/>
&gt; avoid negative<br/>
&gt; consequences (“Johnny, if you don’t stop right now,<br/>
&gt; you’re going to time<br/>
&gt; out”), often engage in behavior that is hostile or<br/>
&gt; aggressive; have strong<br/>
&gt; emotional responses; and seek to counter-control (either<br/>
&gt; overtly by saying<br/>
&gt; “you can’t make me!”, or covertly through sabotage or<br/>
&gt; under-achievement).<br/>
&gt; People that operate under punishment contingencies (instead<br/>
&gt; of threatening<br/>
&gt; to put Johnny in time out, mom spanks him) seek to AVOID<br/>
&gt; the punisher.<br/>
&gt; That’s so powerful to me. Do I really want my children to<br/>
&gt; associate me with<br/>
&gt; power struggles? Do I want them to associate me with<br/>
&gt; punishment, so that *I*<br/>
&gt; become a punisher and they seek to avoid me? I’ve learned<br/>
&gt; that antecedent<br/>
&gt; strategies (putting something in the environment that will<br/>
&gt; promote behavior)<br/>
&gt; is much more desirable than placing consequences (good or<br/>
&gt; bad) on behavior.<br/>
&gt; By loving children unconditionally and allowing the<br/>
&gt; environment to produce<br/>
&gt; the consequences instead of socially mediating, parents can<br/>
&gt; associate<br/>
&gt; themselves with joy. J The environment then, according to<br/>
&gt; the child’s<br/>
&gt; interests and talents, will select behaviors that function<br/>
&gt; for the child. If<br/>
&gt; a child is not inherently “sporty”, the environment<br/>
&gt; will probably not select<br/>
&gt; “sporty” behaviors, even if the child is exposed to<br/>
&gt; sports. By that, I mean,<br/>
&gt; the environment (sports) will not provide consequences that<br/>
&gt; are valuable to<br/>
&gt; the child.  By *making* the child be involved in sports<br/>
&gt; against their will<br/>
&gt; to teach them “teamwork” or whatever else feels<br/>
&gt; justified, people create an<br/>
&gt; aversive environment that the child will work to avoid. By<br/>
&gt; allowing the<br/>
&gt; environment to provide the consequences, children do not<br/>
&gt; rely on socially<br/>
&gt; mediated (arbitrary) consequences. You can be sure, then,<br/>
&gt; that everything<br/>
&gt; they pursue is intrinsically valuable to them. They will be<br/>
&gt; much happier and<br/>
&gt; their families will be much happier as a result. Everyone<br/>
&gt; still operates<br/>
&gt; under *some* aversive control (like speeding tickets.<br/>
&gt; Basically every law we<br/>
&gt; have is enforced by aversive control). There is no way to<br/>
&gt; avoid it<br/>
&gt; completely. But, I can avoid being the source of aversive<br/>
&gt; control for my<br/>
&gt; children and create an environment that promotes mutual<br/>
&gt; respect (instead of<br/>
&gt; fear) and trust. *I* choose that!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading. J<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86596877">At first unschooling looks like a way to trick kids into learning by  <br/>
placing fun things around them they could learn from. But it will  <br/>
help people grasp unschooling faster to keep their own agenda to fun  <br/>
and feeding the kids&#39; interests and giving them opportunities to  <br/>
expand their interests. Treat a book about George Washington the same  <br/>
way you would a new cartoon. Is it something they might enjoy? If  <br/>
they say &quot;No, thanks&quot; will you have some emotional attachment to  <br/>
their answer?<br/>
<br/>
Precisely. :) I put things in their environment that they can learn from if<br/>
they want to and if they are interested in it. I have just seen homes where<br/>
there aren&#39;t many toys, videos, games & books (especially families that have<br/>
kids with special needs. I have worked with children with special needs and<br/>
their families for a few years now and they often get discouraged by their<br/>
child&#39;s lack of engagement/interest with stuff and stop buying it). It makes<br/>
me really sad. That&#39;s not relying on the child&#39;s interest, that&#39;s just<br/>
neglect, I think. I wanted to make the distinction that you never know what<br/>
is going to spark your child&#39;s interest and to enrich it as much as<br/>
possible. You couldn&#39;t expect them to want to learn to read (about George<br/>
Washington even) if they never came into contact with a book. I feel like<br/>
it&#39;s my job to make the world available to my children, so they can decide<br/>
when and what they want to pursue further. I would never respond emotionally<br/>
if they didn&#39;t like a toy or book I bought them. But, maybe because of our<br/>
history together, that rarely (if ever) happens. Not only am I pretty<br/>
familiar with their interests, I try to make everything as fun and relevant<br/>
as possible for my kids. (And a lot of times, I think kids are looking for a<br/>
way to interact with their parents. That interaction is what they enjoy, not<br/>
necessarily the book or game or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
For example, on your website I read a discussion about grocery shopping (I<br/>
LOVE your website! It&#39;s a wealth of useful information). For our family,<br/>
when my girls were little, shopping was done first thing when we woke up in<br/>
the morning and the first stop we made was at the powdered donuts. They<br/>
munched happily as I raced through the store. As a single parent, sometimes<br/>
I have to get a little creative about maintaining our home. But, I let<br/>
natural consequences take effect. When my girls wake up and want chocolate<br/>
milk and waffles, they become concerned when we don&#39;t have any. It is highly<br/>
relevant to them and really important that we have their favorite foods! So,<br/>
they say, &quot;Mom, we need to go to the grocery store.&quot; Yes, we do. :) When my<br/>
girls got older, we made grocery lists together using pictures of their<br/>
favorite foods. Then they helped me find the food at the store, put it in<br/>
the basket, and check it off the list (only if they wanted to, but they<br/>
enjoyed it, so they usually did). Now, they can read and write, so we just<br/>
write the list. I don&#39;t make them do it, though. If they don&#39;t want to<br/>
write, I write it for them. But, they connect our lifestyle to the things<br/>
that make our lifestyle possible (like grocery shopping), and those things<br/>
have become important to them. <br/>
<br/>
That was long winded, but I wanted to relate that just because something<br/>
isn&#39;t inherently enjoyable doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make it enjoyable (with<br/>
enthusiasm and some sugar:). And if you can show a child the relevance of<br/>
things that aren&#39;t inherently enjoyable, they might still become important<br/>
(even to the little ones, though they will obviously have less tolerance for<br/>
such endeavors). I feel like *I* understand what you&#39;re saying about choice<br/>
and I really, really appreciate it. But, I can understand why people think<br/>
that unschoolers take a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to parenting. They see, for<br/>
example, watching tv as a passive activity. They don&#39;t see the active effort<br/>
you put into it as a parent. Yesterday, while watching tv, we looked up the<br/>
patella, what vitamins were in blueberries that made them good for you, and<br/>
martial arts (where we subsequently researched capoeira, kung fu, and tai<br/>
chi). This happened because my kids asked me questions that I didn&#39;t know<br/>
the answer to. (At one point during a show, my older daughter shouted, &quot;This<br/>
thing in my leg moves! What is it?&quot; It was very cute. She realized for the<br/>
first time that her knee wiggles. From there we learned that tendons connect<br/>
muscle to bone, and she giggled as I tickled her thigh right about where her<br/>
knee attaches to it.) They know that we can research things, so they ask to.<br/>
And next time we have blueberries for snack, or see Skunk Fu, or whatever<br/>
else relates, we will talk about the stuff we learned yesterday. That&#39;s not<br/>
passive learning at all. I would say we did a lot! (Not that passive<br/>
learning doesn&#39;t happen, it definitely does! I just think you are a much<br/>
more involved parent than some might think because you say your kid can<br/>
watch tv all day long if she wants. They neglect to read the part about you<br/>
being there acting as her guide.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me wax philosophical and stuff. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081650441">Hi!  I also had the experience of placing my two older children in public school and they suffered more than they excelled.  The youngest of the two (who was normally a very energetic, exciting child) absolutely lost hisexcitement and enthusiasm for life in general.  He constantly used the words &#39;dumb&#39; and &#39;stupid&#39; to describe himself and was in tears at home trying to do his three hours of &#39;homework&#39; IN KINDERGARTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!  The oldest of the two (who was previously homeschooled for K and First grade) was told after three weeks of second grade that he would have to return to first grade.  When asked why, we were told that theteacher was unable to teach him because he needed toooooo much &#39;hands on&#39; and he asked tooooo many questions.<br/>
 (Although when given the right &#39;learning environment&#39; he was considered well beyond his &#39;age level&#39;). Since bringing them back home, I have seen the enthusiasm for learning reappear over time,and the only thing the seem to miss about school is the &#39;equipment&#39;  that comes with goingto school.  And this has rubbed off on the younger two children, who have never attendedpublic school.  How I have helped their longings for riding a bus is we go occassionally on the city bus, back packs filled with &#39;school&#39; stuff, ie notebooks, pencils, crayons, coloringbooks, etc., their lunch boxes full of goodies, and we ride around for a while and getdropped off at parks, the beach, etc.  It&#39;s  a great fun day, it satisfies their need forbuses, backpacks, and lunch boxes, and we all come home tired, but happy.  ~Amanda<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
            My son (now 5) went through periods of this for a while even after <br/>
<br/>
just one semester of preschool at age 3. I used to have a lot of fear <br/>
<br/>
about him wanting to go to school before I had a chance to get us to <br/>
<br/>
the free and happy unschooling life I had embraced in theory but not <br/>
<br/>
yet fully in practice. Initially, joining a homeschool co-op helped <br/>
<br/>
some as he had/has a place he can call his &quot;school&quot; with a &quot;teacher&quot; <br/>
<br/>
(he does a Spanish class) and a playground. But I would feel <br/>
<br/>
threatened when he talked about wanting to go back to preschool or <br/>
<br/>
eventually to a school for bigger kids- I could feel it in the pit of <br/>
<br/>
my stomach and knew my visceral reaction meant my thinking around <br/>
<br/>
this was not clear and positive and he fully picked up on that <br/>
<br/>
energy. But for a long time I had a really hard time figuring out how <br/>
<br/>
to shift it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually just recognized recently what a big shift has happened <br/>
<br/>
for us in this and it was reflected in a conversation we just had as <br/>
<br/>
he&#39;s reacting to all the talk of friends going back to school soon. <br/>
<br/>
It went something like:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;Mom, I&#39;m not going to go to the school yet where I ride the <br/>
<br/>
school bus, right?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Yeah, you want to go back to your school in Munster&quot; (our weekly <br/>
<br/>
homeschool co-op)<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;yeah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;I was thinking you don&#39;t ever have to go to that school where <br/>
<br/>
you ride the school bus because you&#39;d have to go every day, all day <br/>
<br/>
long. But you don&#39;t have to go to that school to ride a school bus. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, how about we ride a school bus to go to the fair today? <br/>
<br/>
(Beautiful serendipity- we had plans to go to the county fair and I <br/>
<br/>
knew they were running school buses as shuttles from the remote <br/>
<br/>
parking)<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;But I want to ride one that picks us up at our house&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Well, they do that for kids that go to school every day- it <br/>
<br/>
picks up everyone at their house and takes them to their school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;So should we check out the school bus that will take us to the <br/>
<br/>
fair?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
J: &quot;Yeah!&quot; (with big excited smile)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He loved it btw and I loved him loving it. I don&#39;t know if that <br/>
<br/>
dialogue depicts the ease and lightness I felt in this conversation <br/>
<br/>
with him, but that was the big difference. I feel much more confident <br/>
<br/>
about the life we&#39;re creating and the fear of him wanting school has <br/>
<br/>
dissipated over this year or so as we moved toward unschooling. We <br/>
<br/>
had come from a pretty controlling place so I think trust-building <br/>
<br/>
has been a big part of it and of course actually living what I *Know* <br/>
<br/>
to be a free and happy life is the other part. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how we might have come to this place faster since it&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
such a path and a process. But I know your question really helped me <br/>
<br/>
to analyze where I was (and wasn&#39;t) in a way I couldn&#39;t at the time, <br/>
<br/>
so maybe that will help you in some way. <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Yet, my son has been wanting to go back.. I think it maybe <br/>
<br/>
the &#39;words&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; he has heard from his not for homeschooling/ unschooling grandma and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; his dad (who he see often -every other weekend for sure -- even <br/>
<br/>
though<br/>
<br/>
&gt; he was ok with me homeschooling since I have a teaching degree:)  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s my mental dilemma -- send him to school or not!!  I flop<br/>
<br/>
&gt; back in forth .  I really want to keep him home I found a great<br/>
<br/>
&gt; diverse hs group that I just love and he&#39;s clicked with the kids <br/>
<br/>
and I<br/>
<br/>
&gt; would like to see him grow in this group.  But if he is feeling like<br/>
<br/>
&gt; he is missing something by not going to school I don&#39;t want to do <br/>
<br/>
that<br/>
<br/>
&gt; either.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve thought to myself --well I&#39;m the mother and we haven&#39;t even <br/>
<br/>
given<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it a full year -- blah, blah<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yet...  I&#39;m also worried I&#39;ll send him then he will want to come <br/>
<br/>
home<br/>
<br/>
&gt; yet again and that will bring big attention to me from the school, <br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
