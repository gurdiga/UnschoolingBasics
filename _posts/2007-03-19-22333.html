***There are two topics this month. Answer both, one...or neither <br/>
and blog about something else  (#1) Use the letters U-N-S-C-H-O-O-L <br/>
to write about unschooling. Use what ever method you want, for <br/>
example you can use each letter like  &quot;U is for..., N is for..&quot;.  Or <br/>
you can  have each letter start a new sentence or paragraph or try <br/>
writing an acronym. (#2) A topic that comes up on the unschooling e-<br/>
mail groups a lot is TV/computer/video games and how hard it is for <br/>
parents to let go of control in those areas. What has been your <br/>
