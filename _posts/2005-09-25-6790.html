<div id="ygrps-yiv-210900191">HI everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 First to introduce myself, I am Dawn,and my husband is David<br/>
We have three great kids Heather,8,Zack,5, and Natalie,1 1/2. This <br/>
is our first year homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 I am here because the furthur we go along in this first year of <br/>
ours the more I hate &quot;schooling&quot; my kids. I admit coming from public <br/>
schools all my life and two of my children attending public schools <br/>
that is all we know. Workbooks and textbooks just are not working <br/>
for us. I feel horrible everyday sitting them at the dining room <br/>
table and saying no talking, and don&#39;t get up until you are done <br/>
with that Math. Kids need to be kids! They need to play and explore. <br/>
This is what my heart tells me, but than that &quot;school&quot; mentality <br/>
kicks in and I say &quot;get back to work&quot;. I am ready to STOP, but I <br/>
need help.<br/>
<br/>
 This will not be easy for me. I do not even know how to begin <br/>
unschooling. I am not very crafty, and we do not have to many places <br/>
to &quot;explore&quot; were we live. Also, how do you explain to relatives who <br/>
also have the school mentality? How do I de-school myself and my <br/>
children? Where do I find ideas? Also, we are in Maryland and have <br/>
to go to the board of education twice a year to go over our work. <br/>
What do I say to them?<br/>
<br/>
  I will take any help or suggestions. Thank you for having this <br/>
group to come to for us who have no idea what to do! <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Read everything about unschooling that you can get your hands on.<br/>
www.Sandradodd.com, <br/>
the archives of this list, and the archives of the unschoolingdiscussion<br/>
list are great places to start.<br/>
For books, try the Unschooling Handbook.<br/>
<br/>
Think of how much your kids learned before they were school aged and try to<br/>
give them a rich environment and an enthusiastic helpful mom.  They will<br/>
continue to learn without painful lessons at the dining room table.  It<br/>
often helps new unschoolers to document the learning that happens naturally<br/>
so you can see how much they&#39;ve been exposed to at the end of the month (or<br/>
week or quarter or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
As you continue to see your children learning and growing without formal<br/>
lessons, you will grow more confident in unschooling.  Bite your tongue when<br/>
you feel like imposing lessons on them and offer to take them somewhere fun<br/>
or play a game with them.  Let them help you cook and garden and tend the<br/>
animals, etc.  Work on making your home a place your children will be<br/>
enthusiastic to be.  Buy fun games and neat toys and books.  Follow your own<br/>
interests with enthusiasm and they will learn to do the same.<br/>

Welcome Dawn!<br/>
Have you found any local homeschooling groups to connect with?   <br/>
nhen.org lists them for every state.  I found by joining my local <br/>
homeschool group, I not only get notification about any &quot;field trips&quot; <br/>
etc they have planned (many are doing more traditional curriculum, <br/>
but sometimes there are things that interest us) but some of the <br/>
members list themselves as unschoolers, and I&#39;ve, slowly, been able <br/>
to connect with other unschoolers in my area.  Also, did you search <br/>
for a yahoo group for your state for homeschoolers (there&#39;s one here <br/>
in MA, they&#39;re again mostly more curriculum oriented, but were <br/>
INVALUABLE when I was writing my first letter of intent to homeschool <br/>
and helped with getting me started as far as what&#39;s REQUIRED).   This <br/>
site is wonderful for those of us new to unschooling (my dd just <br/>
finished 6th grade, we&#39;re currently deschooling and healing).   <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you can find some local unschoolers who can help you with <br/>
how they&#39;ve done their reporting and give you some tips.  I have a <br/>
list of &quot;educationese&quot; words that&#39;s helpful, we&#39;re writing a <br/>
narrative report once a year, but if you have to show work samples <br/>
(?) you might have better luck trying to find others in your state <br/>
who homeschool, and particularily unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Read as much as you can about unschooling.  It&#39;s hard to let go of <br/>
the old notions of &quot;school&quot; but if you feel in your gut that it&#39;s the <br/>
way to go for your kids (I wasn&#39;t sure at first, had never HEARD of <br/>
unschooling up until about a year ago!  but kept coming back to it), <br/>
then TRUST that and learn as much as you can.   Read here for a <br/>
while, and also check some of the archives and previous posts.<br/>
<br/>
And hopefully some unschoolers in your state will pop in here!<br/>
