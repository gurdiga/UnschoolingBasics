<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540939699">Here¹s another ³what would you have done² question:  our 2 cats each had 5<br/>
kittens.  Penelope got 5 and Athena got 5 (both DD¹s are 8).  Penelope gave<br/>
me one of hers and then another one of hers died (no, this is not a math<br/>
problem, LOL...... ³how many kittens were left²).  OK... just kidding....<br/>
Athena decided she wanted my kitten AND one of Penelope¹s.  Penelope got<br/>
upset.  The background here is that Athena wants these two other kittens<br/>
because a boy is here that she likes (their family is renting here for a<br/>
week) and he likes my kitten and Penny¹s.  Penny doesn¹t like change.  She<br/>
wants me to keep my kitten and for her to keep hers.  She doesn¹t want to<br/>
have to give up her kitten.<br/>
<br/>
I very ineptly messed up the situation, getting stuck somewhere between old<br/>
habits and new ideas.  I didn¹t know what to do.  I couldn¹t say yes to one<br/>
child at the expense of the other.  We tried to talk about it, but I ended<br/>
up making Athena feel bad for wanting our kittens (she¹d end up with 7 and<br/>
Penelope with 2), spewed the old ³how would you feel if you were Penny²...<br/>
ack..... I just didn¹t do it right.  Athena held tight to getting what she<br/>
wanted and Penelope felt threatened that she might lose her kitten.  I<br/>
didn¹t want to jump in and say that there are 9 kittens; I have one and so<br/>
Athena gets 4 and Penny gets 4.  That¹s what I would have done a few years<br/>
ago.  <br/>
<br/>
What could I have done better?  They did not solve the problem by themselves<br/>
(I was with them too) and the problem just got worse until Penelope left to<br/>
go upstairs to cry.<br/>
<br/>
They¹ve let it go now, but I still botched it up.<br/>
<br/>
So what would you have done?<br/>
