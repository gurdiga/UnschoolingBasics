<div id="ygrps-yiv-23617178">Please don&#39;t get offended by me being here with this group, and I&#39;m very  <br/>
brand new in joining with you parents here. We&#39;re still not in the works of  <br/>
taking my child out of school yet, but we&#39;re seriously thinking about it. In the  <br/>
meanwhile, we&#39;re watching, researching, and etc. because I think for many  <br/>
different reasons we&#39;re going to end up unschooling before next year&#39;s school  <br/>
year. Unfortunatly I&#39;m working with my 15 y.o. who loves all of her friends at  <br/>
school, and therefore doesn&#39;t want to leave school for this reason ONLY. On <br/>
the  other hand, I&#39;ve been to the district, and pretty soon my next step is <br/>
going to  be the Department of Education, because not only are they abiding by her <br/>
iep  (individual Education Plan, due to having a severe case of a.d.h.d and <br/>
being  real low in testing), but she&#39;s got a teacher who has stolen something <br/>
from my  daughter (as unbelieavable as it is sounds, it is true), lied to us <br/>
many times,  accused her of being a cheater then come to find out she corrected <br/>
the paper  incorrectly, she&#39;s accused my daughter of not handing in <br/>
assignments, but later  found them, she&#39;s told me it&#39;s not her job to pull my daughter <br/>
out of class for  testing, but yet it is her job and it&#39;s on my daughter&#39;s iep, <br/>
this teacher makes  comments to our kids that would make you fall over in <br/>
shock, and soooooo much  more. Yet this teacher, even with the proof of theft, <br/>
has gotten away with all  of this. What is the district&#39;s decision on the <br/>
matter? Let&#39;s just move my  daughter to another team of teachers. So, needless to <br/>
say, the 20/20 drove home  for me that these teachers have so many rights, some <br/>
time, as in my situation,  too many rights. Just because these teachers are <br/>
protected by the union they get  away with doing so many things to our kids, and <br/>
then they hide behind the  protection of the union. I didn&#39;t believe it when <br/>
I asked my advocate on this,  &quot;Why is this school letting this teacher get <br/>
away with these things?&quot; and her  reply was, &quot;because she&#39;s in the union, and if <br/>
the school did anything to her  they&#39;d have to cover their butts big time, so <br/>
they didn&#39;t get sued&quot; I, of  course, believed this, because I do know the <br/>
powers of a union, but boy did the  20/20 show drive this home for me, I was <br/>
totally amazed how this was a topic on  there last night. Another thing is that my <br/>
state does have school choice, I&#39;m in  Delaware, and I can select to send my <br/>
daughter to any school I want as long as I  provide transportation, of course <br/>
this just means public schools. Yet, I&#39;m  sorry, I don&#39;t see the competition <br/>
they were speaking of last night on 20/20.  This school choice has been the case <br/>
for 9 years so far, and it&#39;s changed  nothing. However, vouchers I think <br/>
would be a different school, I think if we  pay school taxes, than OUR children <br/>
should receive that money. If our children  are home schooled, than we parents <br/>
should receive that money for our supplies,  etc. Lastly, the thing that got me <br/>
on the show the most was how bad our kids are  behind in their education <br/>
because of the way their being taught. Not to mention  when they showed the list <br/>
where South Carolina was on the bottom for being the  worst on their kids <br/>
education, I saw where Delaware was like 4th to the bottom,  that&#39;s a crying shame. <br/>
No wonder our country is outsourcing jobs to other  countries, and etc. The <br/>
educational system stinks here in this country where  you&#39;d think we&#39;d be one <br/>
of the best. It doesn&#39;t surprise me though. Thanks for  letting me share, and <br/>
trust me I&#39;m 100% convinced that my kids need to be home  schooled or <br/>
unschooled, it&#39;s just convincing them about missing their friends.  I&#39;ve even tried to <br/>
explain that she&#39;d have more time to spend with them instead,  but that wasn&#39;t <br/>
enough either. Have any of you pulled your teens out and had a  hard time <br/>
convincing them it&#39;s worth it?  <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<br/>
But it should be her choice. You can make home more inviting, put out<br/>
lots of reassurance that you will make sure her friends can be over<br/>
often etc... but if you&#39;re going to understand unschooling, then<br/>
trusting HER choices is a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
If you force her home against her will, that is more damaging long<br/>
term than what she&#39;s getting at school. You can make school less<br/>
important by helping her do the things she loves and forgetting about<br/>
grades and all  the other BS that goes along with schooling. Make her<br/>
interests and selfhood all important, and diminish the importance of<br/>
school....and let her choose.<br/>
That&#39;s my advice. Glad you found the list...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533785412">I agree, Ren. I have one child, my oldest, who chose to stay in PS<br/>
when I took the other two out. I have told him, since he will be going<br/>
to High School next year, that the door is always open for him if he<br/>
should decide that High School isn&#39;t for him.<br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling has so much to do with letting my children lead the<br/>
lives that they choose, even if that means staying in PS. (As much as<br/>
 I don&#39;t like it!)<br/>
