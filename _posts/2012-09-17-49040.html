<div id="ygrps-yiv-458147278">The iPad is my favorite &quot;toy&quot; so I immediately am siding with the four year <br/>
 old. I do know what you mean though. My seven year old is also a huge ipad <br/>
fan.  He takes the ipad with him every day during his rest time and often <br/>
plays it for  two hours straight.  Like everything my family is interested in <br/>
it goes  through phases. How long as your son been playing with the ipad? <br/>
 <br/>
We have a storage area for the ipad where I ask that it be returned after  <br/>
each use so I can keep it fully charged and also know where it is if someone <br/>
 wants to use it (we have four kids). Also those things are EXPENSIVE so I <br/>
always  request that they keep it inside and we don&#39;t take it in the car. <br/>
 <br/>
IGN has a daily post where they share ipad apps that are free or lower in  <br/>
price than usual so every day I load the new free games. <br/>

As for hitting,  I try to redirect them and keep them physically  separated <br/>
when I can tell they are getting tired or upset. Telling someone that  it <br/>
is not okay to hurt another person or animal is not breaking any unschooling  <br/>
rules. It is the &quot;punishment&quot; that in my opinion is not part of an  <br/>
unschooling lifestyle so there are no time outs. Hitting someone tends to have a  <br/>
natural punishment. The other person is hurt/sad/angry and doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
play any more.  <br/>

We are  new to unschooling (son is 4 and daughter is 2). We are also new to <br/>
the  unconditional parenting style that comes along with the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.  I am thrilled to have found this unschooling and this particular <br/>
unschooling  community, but I am having such trouble practicing what I feel <br/>
in my heart is  right.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I KNOW that my son playing the iPad for hours a day  (even <br/>
though I am ever-strewing) is something he feels the need to do right  now. I <br/>
have loaded games upon games for him (educational and just-for-fun  silly <br/>
games), in order to strew on the iPad as well. But, the &quot;schoolie&quot; in me  keeps <br/>
having the fear that he will NEVER want to do other things (and that the  <br/>
iPad is inherently bad). Now, if we go outside and play and the neighbors are <br/>
 there, he will play, have fun, be active...do other things, but the minute <br/>
we  are inside or in the car, it is &quot;where&#39;s the iPad?&quot; Winter is coming, <br/>
so I  know this will be more of an issue as it gets colder outside. <br/>
<br/>
I find  myself resorting back to authoritarian/manipulative behavior by <br/>
saying &quot;it&#39;s  charging&quot; when it&#39;s not, and then helping him engage in some <br/>
other activity.  He always ends up finding something else to do --which makes me <br/>
think, then,  that taking away the iPad is sometimes a good move (but the <br/>
new unschooling  voice in the back of my head is telling me that I should not <br/>
have made that  decision for him). Do I just keep the iPad available to him <br/>
at ALL times and  let him play to his heart&#39;s content? I do sit with him <br/>
and play from time to  time, when he wants me to...most of this is going on in <br/>
my own  head.<br/>
<br/>
Now onto more of a parenting question...my son is starting to  hit. I could <br/>
be RIGHT THERE with them, and he&#39;s so fast that I can&#39;t stop him  from <br/>
hitting his sister in the face/head, etc. I always comfort her first, and  <br/>
lately it has been so frustrating to me that I end up raising my voice and  <br/>
telling him please do not do that, it&#39;s not nice (I know, I know...) I get so  <br/>
impatient with this behavior, and it&#39;s hard for me to imagine how not  <br/>
disciplining in a traditional sense (time out, go to your room, etc.) will  &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
someone that it&#39;s not right to clock someone in the head, especially  if he <br/>
keeps doing it over and over again. (I have suggested that he go to his  <br/>
room and relax for a bit...?) Should I not let them play together for awhile  <br/>
right now? I&#39;m not sure what I should do here to limit the blows to my 2 <br/>
year  old...other times they are great together. Usually, it&#39;s the iPads that <br/>
result  in this behavior....she is using his or vice versa -- they each hav e <br/>
one,  what more can I do? HE is also always suggesting the she play with <br/>
hers when  he&#39;s playing with his (even though she may be happily playing <br/>
Play-Doh,  coloring, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Not on to strewing...I&#39;ve been trying SO HARD to strew  interesting and new <br/>
things for both of my kids. The iPad wins out every.  single. time. Even my <br/>
2 year old is exhibiting the &quot;addiction&quot;. Do I keep  trying with him at <br/>
this point, or should I wait until he comes to me with an  interest? Recently, <br/>
we got some maps of prehistoric times at Costco, he loved  them for about 5 <br/>
minutes. We got new games to play...for the whole family to  play with <br/>
him...nope. Books, paper, painting, crayons, pencils, music,  toys...it all lasts <br/>
minutes to an hour or so, and then he&#39;s on to the iPad  again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking you might all tell me to just go with the iPad, I  think I <br/>
need to hear that that&#39;s ok or something. I am still de-schooling, and  it&#39;s <br/>
hard to wrap my mind around the fact that this is ok for a little person  who <br/>
has shown no real interest in reading, writing, numbers, etc. Just gaming.  <br/>
:) Any help is appreciated, lay it on  me!<br/>
