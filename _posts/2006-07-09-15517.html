<div id="ygrps-yiv-223404790">we only have a family of 3 but our food budget is what I think of as <br/>
tight (about 150.00 per month)<br/>
 I try to make it go farther by shopping at discount grocery (dented <br/>
can stores) and by making meals of beans and rice a couple times per <br/>
week.<br/>
 My son who is 11 could snack all dya and night and runs through <br/>
food at an amazing rate. so what we did was we have told him that <br/>
because we have a set ammount of money to buy food with that we will <br/>
buy what should last through the month but if he eats it all in the <br/>
first week there won&#39;t be any more. he is welcome to make the choice <br/>
to eat it all at once or spred it out. sometimes things are gone in <br/>
2 days, sometimes not. <br/>
 However I can&#39;t see that this would work with 7 people ;-) (of <br/>
course Ive never tried to feed 7 people daily)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622688698">I&#39;m borrowing this from AU, which is also having a discussion about<br/>
food. I thought Su&#39;s answer was really good and has some great points<br/>
to think about:<br/>

&gt; We have found in our house the only time our children really want<br/>
&gt; the sweets is right before breakfast. Normally I will allow a<br/>
&gt; serving, and give them a variety of choices that will let us get<br/>
&gt; through our day.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the word &quot;allow&quot; again. I have been thinking about that word<br/>
in recent months, and how powerfully it reinforces the idea of<br/>
parents being entirely in charge. But for a long time I couldn&#39;t<br/>
think of an alternative. And then I thought of putting it a different<br/>
way--not &quot;what am I doing&quot; but &quot;what am I not doing.&quot; And I started<br/>
saying, &quot;I don&#39;t interfere.&quot; This, to me, is a more accurate<br/>
description of what goes on--my kids want to do something or have<br/>
something, and I can interfere or not interfere. Or I can help them<br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
So I try not to say, &quot;We allow kids to sit on tables at our house,&quot;<br/>
but &quot;We don&#39;t interfere if kids want to sit on tables.&quot; Or, in this<br/>
case, I would not say, &quot;If Carl wants some chocolate before<br/>
breakfast, I allow it,&quot; but &quot;If Carl wants some chocolate before<br/>
breakfast, I don&#39;t interfere,&quot; or &quot;I help him get some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what a &quot;serving&quot; is and who decides. And what happens if<br/>
there is disagreement about it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Once they have eaten something to give them a little energy they<br/>
&gt; are free to have more of whatever they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I think this means they can have more of something sweet after<br/>
they&#39;ve eaten something else? I&#39;m always wary of schemes like this--I<br/>
was a kid who would eat a whole meal I didn&#39;t want or need just to<br/>
&quot;earn&quot; dessert. It would have been better for me to just eat the<br/>
dessert, if that was the only thing I wanted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739074558">I&#39;m sorry Maisha, but the whole idea of limiting WHEN a person can eat<br/>
just really bothers me. I keep thinking of different aspects to this....<br/>
<br/>
First of all, to think that 7 people would all need to eat at the same<br/>
time, that their body signals could somehow be aligned is crazy. This<br/>
means that some of the children are probably going hungry longer than<br/>
they&#39;d like, OR eating when they really don&#39;t need to because it&#39;s &quot;time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if my dh told me &quot;uh, uh, you can&#39;t have that piece of toast<br/>
right now, it&#39;s not eating time&quot; I&#39;d want to DECK him! Someone telling<br/>
me when MY body should have food would really bother me. It would be<br/>
seen as a form of emotional abuse if spouses did this to each other.<br/>
It&#39;s controlling things about another human being they have no right<br/>
to control.<br/>
<br/>
The right to bodily sovereignity is highly important to me. Eating is<br/>
such a part of daily human survival, I can&#39;t imagine taking that right<br/>
of choice from my children.<br/>

<br/>
You said &quot;you&#39;ve had to institute&quot;.....I&#39;ve found in my family it <br/>
works better (and makes more sense to the kids) if we find a <br/>
solution together. It also gives them a real life chance to problem <br/>
solve. <br/>
For example...we have a futon in the same room as playstation. <br/>
Sometimes when my husband gets home from work, he lays down for a <br/>
while before he has dinner. Sometimes, he&#39;s just closing his eyes <br/>
and regrouping, other times he takes a short nap. Because the sound <br/>
of the playstation bothers him when he&#39;s napping, I talked to the <br/>
kids about what we can do. One of them suggested, not putting it on <br/>
when he&#39;s napping. That&#39;s good, but sometimes, he&#39;s only resting and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t bother him then, it&#39;s only when he falls asleep. So they <br/>
came up with muting it when he&#39;s laying down. :-) Problem solving in <br/>
action. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are things your kids can do to help stretch your food <br/>
budget? Can they help look for sales? We&#39;re a family of five and <br/>
we&#39;re all big eaters. I have three supermarkets near me and my kids <br/>
help out with the shopping. They&#39;ve actually gotten me some pretty <br/>
good deals. My oldest is good for that because my husband showed him <br/>
how to look at the unit price and now he checks things as I buy <br/>
them. :-)   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434280804">Why do you think that given them freedom to make choices now will lead to them not choosing vegetables or fruits??<br/>
Were they free to make choices since they were little?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 4 ( just turned 4 on June 24th). He has always had free choice and ate whatever he wanted when he wanted it.<br/>
This morning he had chocolate milk and Peannut Butter Panda Uff ( All organic stuff even the milk)<br/>
on top of that he had three yellow popsicles and is having a rainbow pushems ( Ice cream form Schwanz).<br/>
He has choosen fruits and vegetables many times over &quot;junk&quot; . Sometimes he chooses &quot;junk&quot; over healthy stuff.<br/>
Like he will eat ice cream all day ( we buy breywers for better ingredients)<br/>
The other day he asked me if ice cream was healthy so I got the box and read the ingredients in that ice cream for him and we talked about what was healthy or not so healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189396384">Well, it does *sound* rather controlling. But I think Maisha&#39;s family  <br/>
is kind of like ours right now, where we are sliding on the spectrum  <br/>
of unschooling. If we jumped straight to where you&#39;re at, there would  <br/>
be problems. My children DO still choose to eat when they see someone  <br/>
eat, basically because they are worried about things being fair  <br/>
(that&#39;s mostly age and experience I think, in addition to the fact if  <br/>
you have nine people in your household, if two or three someones ate  <br/>
all they wanted of something, it&#39;s very possible that none would be  <br/>
left for the next seven or eight persons). If so-n-so gets a candy  <br/>
bar, it doesn&#39;t matter what their internal state is, THEY want a  <br/>
candy bar. So I would say that body signals right now are not the  <br/>
best way to judge hunger.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not really taking a choice away, we&#39;re just moving towards  <br/>
choice. It&#39;s getting better all the time (heehee, one of my favorite  <br/>
songs). If one of my kids had ever said they were starving, of course  <br/>
I would offer them some choices. If someone said they were a little  <br/>
snacky and just wanting to taste something, then I might say &quot;Well,  <br/>
dinner is in 15 minutes, could you wait til then?&quot; We don&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily even eat the same thing at dinner, but if my ten yo is  <br/>
just a little hungry, I think he could talk to me for fifteen minutes  <br/>
and then eat it with us.<br/>
<br/>
It might be different a little for us because i do leave a snack tray  <br/>
out all day...and that&#39;s helped a lot with the kids being able to  <br/>
learn themselves better. It also helps that ours our a little younger  <br/>
than some of Maisha&#39;s, so a little less ingrained, yes?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374284657">We usually have a snack tray out all the time, I just refill it every  <br/>
hour or so if it&#39;s getting low. I know about the big family, we have  <br/>
nine here, and they are still mostly young enough to not eat too  <br/>
much ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We also have to be very careful because we have two kids with serious  <br/>
food allergies, so it&#39;s important to 1) make sure they don&#39;t get an  <br/>
allergen, and 2) make sure that food bought for them is protected and  <br/>
available when they are hungry. So, my kids do ask a lot, is this  <br/>
okay to eat? I&#39;m sure if any RU&#39;ers  heard our house, they would be  <br/>
uncomfortable, but it&#39;s not really from control, it&#39;s from everyone&#39;s  <br/>
concern that things are fair for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Same for proportions, the kids usually ask how much they can have. It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;ve let control go of that. However, they ask  <br/>
because they are concerned about whether or not I plan on making  <br/>
something else with the graham crackers, or if it&#39;s the last of the   <br/>
wheat-free crackers it would be really uncool to eat it and leave Dan  <br/>
and Sam with less to snack on. And the gluten free snacks are WAY  <br/>
expensive! We also went through a phase where we measured out all of  <br/>
our food serving sizes to what they had on the box because it was  <br/>
funny to see in comparison to the FDA&#39;s food pyramid. One day we even  <br/>
set out our &#39;food for the day&#39;, eleven servings of grains, etc. We  <br/>
didn&#39;t do it to control food, but to see what exactly those crazy  <br/>
guys are talking about. We&#39;re all very visual learners!<br/>

&gt; In our house the kids are allowed to eat pretty much whatever they  <br/>
&gt; want. However....I have had to put limits on how often they go into  <br/>
&gt; the kitchen. We have a very fixed food budget, and I need it to  <br/>
&gt; last the whole month. I&#39;ve found that if one child gets something  <br/>
&gt; to eat, then another and another goes in the kitchen (even if  <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve just eaten). Next thing I know half the food is gone in 3-5  <br/>
&gt; days. So I&#39;ve had to institute a time for &quot;breakfast&quot;, a time for  <br/>
&gt; &quot;lunch&quot;, a time for &quot;dinner&quot;, and a time for &quot;snacks&quot; just so that  <br/>
&gt; people aren&#39;t eating &#39;cause some else is. With 7 ppl in our house  <br/>
&gt; the food can go quite fast and I need it to last a bit. That&#39;s just  <br/>
&gt; what I&#39;ve done and it works for our family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you implying that people who take a radical unschooling approach to <br/>
food have kids who don&#39;t even know what fruits and vegetables ARE? <br/>
Because that&#39;s how that read to me. And it&#39;s interesting to me that you <br/>
mention unhealthy choices in the future: giving kids zero chance to <br/>
practice making choices now in my opinion generally leads to an <br/>
impaired ability (to varying degrees) to make good choices in the <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
Just to be perfectly clear: people who radically unschool when it comes <br/>
to food don&#39;t offer their kids chips and cookies constantly, or have <br/>
only those items in the house. They simply aren&#39;t forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for all other unschoolers, but we know all about fruits <br/>
and vegetables! We live on a farm and grow our own lettuce, radishes, <br/>
onions, tomatoes, peppers, watermelon, pumpkins, corn, beans, okra, <br/>
cucumbers, turnips, and probably a dozen other items. We also have wild <br/>
blackberries on our property. So be careful what assumptions you make <br/>
about other people&#39;s families if you don&#39;t have the whole picture!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter eats a lot of different foods (in rotation, and separately, <br/>
i.e. she&#39;ll eat cereal and fruit, but not cereal with fruit on it) and <br/>
she even knows a lot about foods that she chooses not to eat. She will <br/>
help me cook stuff all the time that she knows is daddy&#39;s favorite but <br/>
she won&#39;t want any because for example it&#39;s got mushrooms in it. But <br/>
still she likes to help. Granted she won&#39;t eat most of the stuff we <br/>
grow, but her food choices are changing and evolving all the time <br/>
according to her own tastes and what her own body needs at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Last month&#39;s favorite falls by the wayside and she tries something new <br/>
and adds it to the menu of what is acceptable to her. Then it changes <br/>
again. She used to eat only plain bread. No toasting, no spreads of any <br/>
kind. Now she eats toast with butter or french toast but not plain <br/>
bread. She took about a year off from eating eggs other than in french <br/>
toast and now she asks for scrambled eggs often. I used to be <br/>
positively alarmed at how many pistachios she would eat. I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
one pass her lips in 6 months. But now she suddenly likes to lick <br/>
peanut butter off a spoon. It&#39;s very interesting to me that she will <br/>
eat bologna and cheese but not a bologna and cheese sandwich. She has <br/>
her reasons I guess!<br/>
<br/>
Right now as far as fruits and veggies go she loves carrots, apples, <br/>
blueberries, and peas. My younger daughter loves squash, peaches, <br/>
avocadoes, sweet potatoes, and bananas. My older daughter wouldn&#39;t eat <br/>
any of those things if her life depended on it, lol. And that&#39;s fine. I <br/>
feel like a surefire way to make her stop liking peas is to withhold <br/>
popsicles or cookies until she eats all of her peas (not saying you do <br/>
this, just saying that many many people do, and it&#39;s a bad idea in my <br/>
opinion).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make peas the enemy! Eat popsicles in the bath! Worried about how <br/>
many cookies/brownies your kids are eating? Make a healthy version that <br/>
you can feel good about saying yes to at any time of the day. Model <br/>
healthy eating. Leave bowls of fruit and trays of veggies and dip out <br/>
for them. There was a study that people are something like 30-40% more <br/>
likely to eat fruit if it&#39;s washed and displayed in plain sight than <br/>
stored somewhere hidden. And mini carrots with ranch dressing was more <br/>
popular with the kids (ages 3-14) at my DD&#39;s 3rd birthday party than <br/>
the brownies. Color me shocked, lol. I remember hovering by the food <br/>
table at birthday parties when I was little and scarfing M & Ms and <br/>
cupcakes like there was no tomorrow. Because there WAS no tomorrow for <br/>
sweets for me -- until the next party.<br/>
<br/>
You know this thread has inspired me to post some pictures of my kids <br/>
in the photos section. Might take a while as I&#39;m on dialup (ugh!) but <br/>
it&#39;s important to me that people reading this SEE how beautifully <br/>
healthy they are on a diet of their own choosing. A diet that includes <br/>
lots of the crunchy group, the frozen group, and the chocolate group, <br/>
lol. We have a food dodecahedron in our family, forget the pyramid!<br/>

kids to eat less food?<br/>
<br/>
So - are you thinking they&#39;ll eat when they&#39;re not hungry?<br/>
<br/>
The thing about not limiting food is that kids eat what they need to  <br/>
eat - eat when they&#39;re hungry, they don&#39;t binge now for fear of there  <br/>
not being enough later. Setting up a condition of food being scarce  <br/>
induces  people TO eat when they&#39;re not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that the transition might not drain your bank account  <br/>
and I do understand not wanting to do that - but, from the way both  <br/>
of you describe how you limit food, it makes it sound like the kids  <br/>
will be eating less food when you limit it. I must be missing  <br/>
something -- but Maisha - don&#39;t they just eat MORE during the times  <br/>
the kitchen is open? And Diana - if he eats all the food in the first  <br/>
part of the month - I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t really mean you don&#39;t let him  <br/>
eat anything the rest of the month. So ???<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why wouldn&#39;t the kids want to have dinner together, if it is so fun?  <br/>
I&#39;m not seeing why you&#39;d have to make them do that. We don&#39;t eat  <br/>
dinner together every night, but we do when we can (my kids are 15,  <br/>
18, 21 and busy).<br/>
<br/>
Also - why is the food wasted just because they don&#39;t eat it at the  <br/>
same time as you do?<br/>
<br/>
I make food - people eat it together or separately. Right now we have  <br/>
rice and chicken in tupperware containers, left from yesterday. I&#39;m  <br/>
going to heat some up for lunch for Rosie and me, in a few minutes.  <br/>
We won&#39;t be home when my dh gets home - but he&#39;ll heat some up for  <br/>
himself. Roxana will have it later tonight when she gets home from a  <br/>
rehearsal.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning, sometimes I make pancakes early - I leave them on a  <br/>
plate, covered, and leave all the &quot;fixens&quot; sitting out. People eat  <br/>
what they want when they get up and are hungry. After everyone has  <br/>
had what they want - either the last person will clean up or I&#39;ll  <br/>
notice and do it myself. Or we have lots of good cereal or oatmeal  <br/>
and fruit and nuts around - people eat breakfast and put what they  <br/>
want on it. Same with lunch - they eat what they find available - so  <br/>
I make sure that there are good, nutritious choices available of  <br/>
things they like. Dinner - if I know everybody&#39;s schedules are going  <br/>
to work out so that we&#39;ll all be home - like yesterday - then  <br/>
sometimes i cook a more elaborate dinner and make a lot, so we&#39;ll  <br/>
have good leftovers. But usually we have something simple enough that  <br/>
people can make their own. I might shred lettuce, grate cheese, and  <br/>
chop up tomatoes and cook some beans with Mexican seasoning.....then  <br/>
each person can make tacos or burritos for themselves when they get  <br/>
hungry.<br/>

onto the snack tray?<br/>
Given budget constraints - that&#39;s a good solution and an excellent  <br/>
transition from food restrictions to more freedom. I mean - I STILL  <br/>
do that - put out nutritious snacky stuff. My family isn&#39;t restricted  <br/>
to that - but they&#39;ll usually choose what is most convenient unless  <br/>
they really have a desire for something else. I make popcorn a lot  <br/>
when they&#39;re sitting around watching tv/movies/sports -- because they  <br/>
like to munch on something and I&#39;d rather offer popcorn than see them  <br/>
eat bags of chips. But - we HAVE chips around if that&#39;s what they  <br/>
really want.<br/>
<br/>
Rox will almost always eat whatever I&#39;ve set out on the counter in  <br/>
the kitchen - she doesn&#39;t want to spend time finding or making  <br/>
anything - just wants to satisfy her hunger. She&#39;ll almost always eat  <br/>
fruit if it is available. Rosie will have urges for specific foods -  <br/>
so she&#39;ll go in the kitchen and make guacamole or mashed potatoes or  <br/>
get a slice of cheese or something she really wants. She knows what  <br/>
she wants when she goes to the kitchen - Rox goes to the kitchen to  <br/>
figure out what she wants.<br/>

side with the peanut butter. It&#39;s not pushing one thing or <br/>
withholding another but simply leaving all things be equal, <br/>
providing information, and removing the emotion from the equation. <br/>
When it&#39;s not forbidden, there&#39;s no sense of &quot;getting away with&quot; or <br/>
guilt about food. Then true choices about what your body wants <br/>
aren&#39;t getting interfered with by the emotional side of things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re valiantly trying to grow tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, bell <br/>
peppers, hot peppers, chives, and black beans this year -<br/>
 &quot;valiantly&quot; because the long cold spring and super sodden summer so <br/>
far have made it rather a challenge - they&#39;re *finally* showing <br/>
signs of wanting to grow rather than hiding from the weather lol! <br/>
And we&#39;ve got wild blackberries too! DS (8) has been going out daily <br/>
to harvest those that are ripe. We&#39;ve made berry jam (combo of the <br/>
wild berries and store-bought strawberries, blueberries, and red <br/>
raspberries). He also requested some blackberry pancakes the other <br/>
day, ate about 4 of them (with a dab of honey) and I froze the rest <br/>
for quick snacking - he&#39;s eaten several of those toasted up with <br/>
honey since then. <br/>
<br/>
Warning: shocking content ahead ....<br/>
<br/>
Saturday evening we had salad for dinner: DS had lettuce, carrot, <br/>
tomato, celery, sliced hard boiled egg and shredded cheese, no <br/>
dressing, and said it was a &quot;great dinner&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, maybe not shocking to some of you but probably shocking to <br/>
others who wouldn&#39;t believe that an 8 year old would eat a salad, <br/>
short of parental pressure (eat your salad or no dessert).<br/>

set out a real spread of stuff - chips and dips and cookies and <br/>
veggies and dip. I was getting a beverage or something and my aunt <br/>
came over and said &quot;Can your son have broccoli and dip?&quot; I <br/>
said &quot;Sure&quot;. Then she said, &quot;well, you might want to check on him&quot; I <br/>
was a bit confused so I went over to the adjacent dining room where <br/>
the food was laid out. And there was DS - he had gotten himself up <br/>
on a chair to reach the table and he was elbow deep in the ranch dip <br/>
munching raw broccoli quite happily. I grinned at my &quot;dipped&quot; boy, <br/>
cleaned him up a bit, and scooped out a big scoop of dip onto a <br/>
separate plate and surrounded it with broccoli and moved him to <br/>
another location where he could eat messily safely. I think my aunt <br/>
was a bit puzzled by a 3 yr old who beelined for the broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, I was shopping and came home (with some chocolates for the <br/>
family) to find DS helping DH with some yardwork. After a bit, I <br/>
said &quot;Time for a chocolate break&quot; DS, who already knew I had brought <br/>
home his absolute favorite Lindt white chocolate, said &quot;In a minute <br/>
as soon as I finish what I&#39;m working on&quot; Okay, guess he&#39;s not <br/>

I buy 150.00 worth of food per month.<br/>
it is our entire food budget.<br/>

if My son eats all the apples I have bought then there are no more.<br/>
if he eats all the cerial there is no more till next month.<br/>
if we have bought Icecream and it is gone in 1 day then there is no <br/>
more for the rest of the month.<br/>
if we buy a box of cupcakes and our son eats them all in a sitting <br/>
then there are no more cupcakes for the rest of the month.<br/>
<br/>
there are always plenty of beans and rice and pasta. There are many <br/>
diferent types of food avalable but I do not have the financial <br/>
position to spend my food budget and then go and spend money I do <br/>
not have on more food because our son wants more of somthing he has <br/>
already ate the entire months worth of.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not being mean and nobody is starving. My husband and I often <br/>
eat only 1 meal a day in order to stay within the budget and we are <br/>
not starving. We often eat the same things several days in a row <br/>
because it is economical to do so. a pot of soup beans can last 3-4 <br/>
days when eaten with cornbread one day, rice the next and tortieas <br/>
on the 3rd day.<br/>

<br/>
I should add that the adults in the house have the exact same choices. <br/>
if *I* want to eat all the icecream or apples or cerial then its all <br/>
gone and there isnt any more for the month. I often make the choice to <br/>
leave some to spred out through the month.<br/>
<br/>
and I am not saying we dont have &#39;fun&#39; junkfoods sometimes, we do have <br/>

As to eating salad for dinner...<br/>
Jalen sometimes eats nothing but brocolli for a meal. At four years<br/>
old he would do this. He&#39;ll also eat nothing but ice cream sometimes.<br/>
It all balances out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
By purchasing more and more of the things they eat quickly, I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten to the point where those things aren&#39;t so focused on. They are<br/>
just there. Ice cream bars have been going quickly still, so I just<br/>
keep stocking up on them. It becomes a non-issue that way, they don&#39;t<br/>
have that fear of loss that causes so many problems.<br/>

I don&#39;t think an atmosphere of lack, is an ideal unschooling situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664271101">off of food for a while, on the other hand you could say<br/>
Not &quot;We don&#39;t allow our kids to sit on the table&quot;, but you could say  <br/>
&quot;We offer our children many different ways to feel safely bigger when  <br/>
they sit&quot; or &quot;We offer our children a chance to sit on the table when  <br/>
the stakes are low (no food or crafts set up that could get flubbed)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the discussion, I think that Sue has a great perspective, again  <br/>
going into words having power. If you are saying we allow, or we  <br/>
don&#39;t allow, it&#39;s self-fulfilling even if you don&#39;t intend the words  <br/>
the way you are saying them. Interfere itself sounds really negative,  <br/>
what would it sound like if we said the kids want something, and I  <br/>
help facilitate. SO...they want to do something, and I can choose to  <br/>
facilitate or to not facilitate. I don&#39;t disallow my children  <br/>
chocolate in the mornings, but i do facilitate choice. It may be that  <br/>
they would appreciate something else equally sweet, but it&#39;s too  <br/>
difficult to get an apple that easy to eat, but if someone peels it  <br/>
and chops it up it&#39;s more appealing than chocolate, whereas they can  <br/>
get chocolate quickly and not worry about a lot of preparation. Or  <br/>
because of so many kids, there is a fear that someone else will eat  <br/>
it if it is not eaten now, so we can say, do you really want the  <br/>
chocolate now, or are you wanting to ensure you&#39;ll have it later?  <br/>
Alot of our deschooling has been letting the kids know that we are  <br/>
totally here and willing to do the extra work to get them what they  <br/>
truly desire. Honestly, a candy bar in the morning has just as much  <br/>
sugar as the boxed cereal :-P  I&#39;ve defended my choice on the cereal  <br/>
to the moms who sniff when my kids are picking it out...I LOVE  <br/>
pointing out to them that their kix has as much sugar as the trix LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Servings for us is quick and dirty, it says on the box what a serving  <br/>
is. They are almost always smaller than what we anticipate, and once  <br/>
we did the measuring day, it was very much fun for us to see that our  <br/>
normal bowls of cereal were two or three servings. It&#39;s given the  <br/>
kids alot to think about, we personally don&#39;t limit to just one  <br/>
serving, but mindful eating is as important as mindful parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134283792">We do pretty much the same thing---we have 7 kids and I do one big shopping<br/>
a month, the rest of the time I just run to the store for milk and produce.<br/>
I get snacks and pop once a month---and they know that they have to make it<br/>
last.  I have also tried letting each kid pick out their choice of pop and<br/>
snack and they are in charge of it and can choose whether to make it last or<br/>
spread it out---with the 6 kids who are old enough to choose, that got<br/>
pretty expensive.  Now, I just buy stuff they all like in bulk at Sam&#39;s and<br/>
I put a little out at a time and hope they make it last.  I have lots of<br/>
fruits and veggies available as well and I ask that people eat at meal times<br/>
and snack times (3 meals a day and 3 snacks), otherwise the teenagers will<br/>
be making 3 course snacks in the middle of the night or right before dinner.<br/>
It&#39;s a hard thing to juggle, trying not to be demanding about the food while<br/>
also trying to ensure that we have some left before next payday.  If I don&#39;t<br/>
put some sort of restriction on, the teenagers and my 8 year old would eat<br/>
us out of house and home in 3 days!  One thing I have been doing---I hide<br/>
some of the good stuff, so later in the month when supplies are getting low,<br/>
I pull out something yummy and just put it in the snack jars without telling<br/>
anyone---and they just happen to find it and are thrilled!  Also, I bake a<br/>
lot so they have fresh breads and cookies or granola bars available to<br/>
them--which I prefer them to eat over the processed junk they love so much!<br/>
Each week we all get to choose what we&#39;re baking and we make big batches.<br/>
This has cut down on my snack bill considerably and the kids are eating<br/>
healthier as well!  As long as there is something homemade available, they<br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to have the processed junk food so much--and the great<br/>
thing is that they are making these choices themselves!<br/>

In our house the kids are allowed to eat pretty much whatever they want.<br/>
However....I have had to put limits on how often they go into the kitchen.<br/>
We have a very fixed food budget, and I need it to last the whole month.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that if one child gets something to eat, then another and another<br/>
goes in the kitchen (even if they&#39;ve just eaten). Next thing I know half the<br/>
food is gone in 3-5 days. So I&#39;ve had to institute a time for &quot;breakfast&quot;, a<br/>
time for &quot;lunch&quot;, a time for &quot;dinner&quot;, and a time for &quot;snacks&quot; just so that<br/>
people aren&#39;t eating &#39;cause some else is. With 7 ppl in our house the food<br/>
can go quite fast and I need it to last a bit. That&#39;s just what I&#39;ve done<br/>
and it works for our family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312282680">Got it.<br/>
<br/>
What wasn&#39;t clear was that you meant that if one specific thing was  <br/>
gone, then that was it for that item, for the month. You made it  <br/>
sound like if he ate all the food, then that would be all the food he  <br/>
could have - no more eating (at all) until next month.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe you&#39;ve misunderstood the way the word, &quot;unlimited&quot; is  <br/>
being used.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have food budgets, I&#39;m sure. None of us can afford to buy  <br/>
absolutely everything our family might wish for.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Food limits&quot; refers to conventional parenting methods of the parent  <br/>
deciding exactly what food will be purchased, what will be served,  <br/>
when it will be served, and how much a child must eat, often whether  <br/>
they like it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Not having such limits doesn&#39;t mean we magically have the ability to  <br/>
buy everything everybody wants, all the time. Real life requires  <br/>
living within budget constraints.<br/>
<br/>
However - the question is do the kids have a say-so in how much of  <br/>
the family budget goes toward food? That $150 per month - is that  <br/>
something everybody understands and agrees with or would they like to  <br/>
try to find some way to give up something else and have a little more  <br/>
money for food? In other words, with such a limited budget, we&#39;d  <br/>
probably make it a family decision. Another possibility would be to  <br/>
give each kid a small amount of that money to decide how to spend -  <br/>
in other words, find ways to let them help with the decision making,  <br/>
even though it is within a constraint. When I get ready to go  <br/>
shopping, I ask everybody - &quot;Anybody want to put something on my  <br/>
list?&quot; They say things like broccoli, bananas, milk, cucumbers,  <br/>
specific cereals, popcorn -- they almost never say ice cream or cake  <br/>
or cookies. Just once in a while does anybody straight out ask for  <br/>
something like a box of Oreos - if they do, I make an effort to get  <br/>
it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing something similar.<br/>
<br/>
Once the food is home and in the kitchen, they can choose what and  <br/>
when to eat (except if something was special for one person, I  <br/>
sometimes put someone&#39;s name on it OR if I have plans to cook with  <br/>
something, I might tell people not to eat it). If they eat all the  <br/>
ice cream the first day after shopping - that&#39;s okay.  But if I see  <br/>
one person eating a whole lot of something, I&#39;d probably remind them  <br/>
to make sure they consider others who might want it. Doesn&#39;t happen  <br/>
too often - but occasionally somebody eats up something that someone  <br/>
else was looking forward to - when it does happen, I just make sure  <br/>
to get that person some of it the next time I shop and make sure that  <br/>
this time they get some of it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; So - are you thinking they&#39;ll eat when they&#39;re not hungry?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The thing about not limiting food is that kids eat what they need<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; eat - eat when they&#39;re hungry, they don&#39;t binge now for fear of<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt;&gt; not being enough later. Setting up a condition of food being<br/>
&gt; scarce<br/>
&gt;&gt; induces  people TO eat when they&#39;re not hungry.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not saying that the transition might not drain your bank<br/>
&gt; account<br/>
&gt;&gt; and I do understand not wanting to do that - but, from the way<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt;&gt; of you describe how you limit food, it makes it sound like the<br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt;&gt; will be eating less food when you limit it. I must be missing<br/>
&gt;&gt; something -- but Maisha - don&#39;t they just eat MORE during the<br/>
&gt; times<br/>
&gt;&gt; the kitchen is open? And Diana - if he eats all the food in the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt;&gt; part of the month - I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t really mean you don&#39;t let<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt;&gt; eat anything the rest of the month. So ???<br/>

At 18 she started experimenting with other foods and, at 19, she eats  <br/>
a relatively wide selection. She&#39;s not adventurous in her eating -  <br/>
not at ALL. But she&#39;s strong and beautiful and healthy and she does  <br/>
NOT have an eating disorder and I&#39;m so glad my sister (her mother)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044364665">While we do have snack times and meal times---the kids choose when they eat<br/>
between meals and what they get to eat.  We have a pretty loose schedule so<br/>
I tend to make meals when all of us are hungry--which means we can eat lunch<br/>
as early as 11 or as late as 4 and dinner at 9 or whatever.  They all eat<br/>
breakfast when they feel ready to---I know when my 8 year old wakes up he&#39;s<br/>
gonna want his over easy egg whites and toast with cream cheese--the<br/>
teenagers tend to all get up at different times so they just get themselves<br/>
some cereal.  All the kids can eat whenever they want---but I also have<br/>
snacks available for them between meals that I make at certain times.  If a<br/>
kid says they are hungry, I offer them something to eat---no one is ever<br/>

<br/>
Well, it does *sound* rather controlling. But I think Maisha&#39;s family <br/>
is kind of like ours right now, where we are sliding on the spectrum <br/>
of unschooling. If we jumped straight to where you&#39;re at, there would <br/>
be problems. My children DO still choose to eat when they see someone <br/>
eat, basically because they are worried about things being fair <br/>
(that&#39;s mostly age and experience I think, in addition to the fact if <br/>
you have nine people in your household, if two or three someones ate <br/>
all they wanted of something, it&#39;s very possible that none would be <br/>
left for the next seven or eight persons). If so-n-so gets a candy <br/>
bar, it doesn&#39;t matter what their internal state is, THEY want a <br/>
candy bar. So I would say that body signals right now are not the <br/>
best way to judge hunger.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not really taking a choice away, we&#39;re just moving towards <br/>
choice. It&#39;s getting better all the time (heehee, one of my favorite <br/>
songs). If one of my kids had ever said they were starving, of course <br/>
I would offer them some choices. If someone said they were a little <br/>
snacky and just wanting to taste something, then I might say &quot;Well, <br/>
dinner is in 15 minutes, could you wait til then?&quot; We don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily even eat the same thing at dinner, but if my ten yo is <br/>
just a little hungry, I think he could talk to me for fifteen minutes <br/>
and then eat it with us.<br/>
<br/>
It might be different a little for us because i do leave a snack tray <br/>
out all day...and that&#39;s helped a lot with the kids being able to <br/>
learn themselves better. It also helps that ours our a little younger <br/>
than some of Maisha&#39;s, so a little less ingrained, yes?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sorry Maisha, but the whole idea of limiting WHEN a person can eat<br/>
&gt; just really bothers me. I keep thinking of different aspects to <br/>
&gt; this....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all, to think that 7 people would all need to eat at the same<br/>
&gt; time, that their body signals could somehow be aligned is crazy. This<br/>
&gt; means that some of the children are probably going hungry longer than<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d like, OR eating when they really don&#39;t need to because it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &quot;time&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Secondly, if my dh told me &quot;uh, uh, you can&#39;t have that piece of toast<br/>
&gt; right now, it&#39;s not eating time&quot; I&#39;d want to DECK him! Someone telling<br/>
&gt; me when MY body should have food would really bother me. It would be<br/>
&gt; seen as a form of emotional abuse if spouses did this to each other.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s controlling things about another human being they have no right<br/>
&gt; to control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The right to bodily sovereignity is highly important to me. Eating is<br/>
&gt; such a part of daily human survival, I can&#39;t imagine taking that right<br/>
&gt; of choice from my children.<br/>

It&#39;s not so much &quot;making him aware of choices&quot; as it is scolding <br/>

you would.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have &quot;meal times&quot; though we do sit down to a dinner together<br/>
sometimes.  And I DO have teens making food in the middle of the<br/>
night, when THEY are hungry, as they should. If a person is hungry<br/>
before dinner, that&#39;s when they should eat. If they&#39;re hungry in the<br/>
middle of the night, that&#39;s when they should eat. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
trying to control when and what and how much my children ate with the<br/>
RU principles in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hearing a lot about mealtimes and how the family could not afford<br/>
to feed all these children if the kids had free access. So one of two<br/>
things is happening, either the children are NOT getting enough food<br/>
to satisfy them, OR the parents are assuming because there have been<br/>
controls in place that the binging would be a continual thing.<br/>
<br/>
Kids, like all humans, are going to eat a certain amount to be<br/>
satisfied. So if food has to be restricted to afford keeping up with<br/>
all these kids, are any of them really getting what they need/want?<br/>
If they need a certain amount of food regularly, it would be about the<br/>
same amount from day to day, would it not? So how does free access<br/>
equal a higher grocery budget?<br/>
<br/>
What is basically being said, is that without controls, kids eat MORE.<br/>
Maybe they NEED more.<br/>

***********<br/>
My oldest son is overweight. He&#39;s a big kid anyway (6&#39;5&quot; 300 #s give or take) So obviously, part of that is genetics, but I think that the biggest reason is that  for the years that he lived with his father and step mother, she controlled his food intake - doling out portions, fixing his plate (at 13) and limiting his time in the kitchen. He used to wait until everyone in the house was asleep and sneak upstairs to the kitchen and eat in front of the fridge.<br/>
Sad. Thank goddess he&#39;s here now. He can eat whatever he wants.<br/>
