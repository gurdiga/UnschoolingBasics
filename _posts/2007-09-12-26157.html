<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099417396">Hi all, Just wanted to introduce myself and maybe get a bit of input <br/>
about my situation. I have a son who is 11 years old and is currently <br/>
enrolled in public school. He is having a lot of difficulty in both <br/>
academics and in the social life there.  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling as <br/>
I homeschooled my daughter for three years between 6th and 9th grades. I <br/>
took her out for the same reason I am thinking about taking my son out, <br/>
bullying by other students, and low academics, not because they can&#39;t <br/>
excel, but because the constant pressures of other kids in the school <br/>
causes them to hate the whole school experience.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was bullied constantly, and had low scores because she <br/>
couldn&#39;t concentrate. Both of my kids aren&#39;t the athletic, popular <br/>
types, they both tend to march to the beat of a different drummer due to <br/>
bipolar disorder, and tend to get singled out by other kids in the <br/>
school environment. I had zero cooperation from the school system back <br/>
then with my daughter because their whole attitude was you had to let <br/>
kids work things like that out amongst themselves. Since Columbine, <br/>
attitudes have changed and my son&#39;s school has been quicker to stop the <br/>
harassment,  but have not put an end to it. Other kids know my son is <br/>
quick to come to tears and seem to like to try their best to push his <br/>
buttons. His grades have been falling steadily over the past few years <br/>
due to this. He had an IQ test early on and he is brilliant, like my <br/>
daughter, but can&#39;t get past the reams of homework on his bad days, and <br/>
is constantly in turmoil due to the bipolar disorder and environment at <br/>
school. He is getting more depressed and I feel like the school system <br/>
is just making his symptoms worse.<br/>
<br/>
I allowed my daughter to be in charge of whether or not she was <br/>
homeschooled and eventually she decided she wanted to go back and I <br/>
honored that choice. She went back much better able to do the school <br/>
work and much better able to handle things other kids threw at her. She <br/>
is now 25 and attending a community college.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of unschooled my daughter for the years I had her at home, in <br/>
that I didn&#39;t have a super structured curriculum, but would really <br/>
prefer to unschool my son completely. I&#39;m just wondering if there are <br/>
others out there who have gone from years of structured public schooling <br/>
to unschooling and how hard was it to make the switch? Should I expect <br/>
my son to go through a period of not wanting to do anything at all, or <br/>
should I try and just do things that pique his interest and let it go <br/>
from there?<br/>
<br/>
Another question for anyone out there who went from public schools to <br/>
unschooling is, should I wait until the beginning of a school year to do <br/>
it, or just yank him out in the middle of a year? With my daughter, we <br/>
started at the beginning of a new school year, so there were no problems <br/>
really, other than some nasty comments from the principal of the school <br/>
she was supposed to be going to. I work seasonally, so can&#39;t really take <br/>
him out just yet, due to not having anyone to be here at home with him. <br/>
My work ends in November though, so I would be able to do it at that <br/>
time, then make arrangements by next summer before work picks up again.<br/>
<br/>
At this point it really is a matter of his mental health that is so much <br/>
of an issue. I don&#39;t know if he can handle this kind of stress much <br/>
longer. I have talked with him openly of course, and want it to be his <br/>
decision like it was with my daughter to stay or leave the PS system and <br/>
he is all ready to give it a whirl, but I&#39;m just not sure if I should go <br/>
the unschooled route or the more structured route.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening if nothing else!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189592072">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Vanessa, and I am in my second year of<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My son, had the same problems as your children, accept<br/>
he isn&#39;t bipolar.  Although his grades didn&#39;t suffer,<br/>
he was always bullied.  Like you, we tried going<br/>
through all of the channels to get these problems<br/>
taken care of, and nothing worked.  He only liked art,<br/>
and only liked gym, because of the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
My son isn&#39;t athletic, and had few friends.  His best<br/>
friend, moved right during Easter break, so he lost<br/>
his last friend then.  He had been an &quot;easy&quot; target,<br/>
because he is a big kid, and at 11, he&#39;s almost as<br/>
tall as I am.(and I am 5&#39;9&quot;)  He was always the smart<br/>
kid.  The school thought he needed help, so we agreed<br/>
to have his speech tested.  When he was tested, he<br/>
tested above his age, on most of them way above his<br/>
age.  He was also labeled as someone with high anxiety<br/>
disorder (which I don&#39;t believe.)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to pull him out before school ended, but<br/>
hubby wanted both kids to finish out the year.  My<br/>
daughter was also bullied, but not to the same extent.<br/>
<br/>
They say hind sight is 20/20, and looking back now, I<br/>
wish I would&#39;ve pulled them out when I wanted to. <br/>
I&#39;ve been through the depression (if that&#39;s what it&#39;s<br/>
called) with him.  One summer he told my<br/>
parents--what&#39;s the point in going on.  He was in<br/>
second grade then.  He had a really good teacher in<br/>
3rd grade, but the bullying continued, and nothing was<br/>
done about it.  By the time he hit fourth grade, it<br/>
was a nightmare.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t wait.  I would pull your son out of public<br/>
school, when it is possible for you.  We went from<br/>
public school to unschooling right away.  We did<br/>
deschool, and sometimes I feel that we still are. <br/>
There is still alot of anger in me and my children,<br/>
although it has lessened some.  Unschooling is so<br/>
awesome for us.  We are able to do alot of things that<br/>
you just don&#39;t get in public schools.  It&#39;s about<br/>
living life, and learning from those experiences.  We<br/>
haven&#39;t done anything schooly.  We have touched on the<br/>
subjects that my kids talk about, and we learn<br/>
together.  We chose unschooling, because it is what<br/>
fits our family the best.  It&#39;s taken some time to get<br/>
used to it, but I enjoy my kids, and love the things<br/>
that they are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Public school messed with them alot.  We have battled<br/>
with the principal and the teachers so many times, and<br/>
even had the principal lie to me, right to my face. <br/>
We didn&#39;t feel comfortable leaving the kids in a place<br/>
where they couldn&#39;t trust the teachers, and we<br/>
couldn&#39;t trust the principal.  Now that we have been<br/>
doing this for a year, it is so amazing the changes we<br/>
see in our kids.  They are more relaxed and happier,<br/>
and they are starting to get their self-confidence<br/>
back.  It has changed them so much for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.  Enjoy the time you can spend<br/>
with your son, and pull him out as soon as you can. <br/>
It really makes a difference, and you&#39;ll be glad you<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775846746">Thanks for the input Vanessa! I think I am going to go ahead and take <br/>
him out after the Christmas holidays. That way it should give me enough <br/>
time to get up with the state and meet the requirements for <br/>
homeschooling, plus by that time work will be over and I won&#39;t have that <br/>
causing problems. I definitely won&#39;t wait till the end of the school <br/>
year, it&#39;s just getting really bad for him mentally staying in school. <br/>
If I can get my ducks in order I may even do it after the Thanksgiving <br/>
holiday break.<br/>
<br/>
I was actually shocked and amazed at some of the reactions I have gotten <br/>
from family members over this. I was expecting some friction from some, <br/>
just because of the whole homeschooling thing, not to even mention <br/>
unschooling, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My husband was quick <br/>
to agree to taking him out of school, knowing what kind of difficulties <br/>
he has been having lately. The biggest surprise was my sister though. <br/>
She is normally a bit less open minded, yet when I started talking to <br/>
her about his troubles, she actually brought it up; &quot;Maybe you should <br/>
homeschool him&quot;. She balked a bit when I took my daughter out of school <br/>
years ago, but this time she really has been very supportive, and <br/>
although she was a bit skeptical about the unschooling idea at first <br/>
this time, she really seemed to see the point of it after a bit of <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
It will be extremely nice this go around having it being a bit more <br/>
accepted by close family members and friends than it was back in the <br/>
early 90s when I did it before. Glad to see it has become more <br/>
mainstream these days and more generally acceptable than it was at that <br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636300617">Hi, Julie,<br/>
We have been basically unschooling our son since last March- we took <br/>
him out of 4th grade. It was a short school week; they only had <br/>
school Monday-Wednesday that week, as there was a 4-day weekend after <br/>
that. I chose this time to take him out for a few reasons: <br/>
<br/>
1) Although we planned to start homeschooling at the beginning of the <br/>
school year, he wanted to be on the 4th grade basketball team with <br/>
his friends, and he had to attend school to do that.<br/>
2) We had just attended a homeschooling conference that really got me <br/>
pumped up to start asap! My husband wasn&#39;t thrilled, but I knew I&#39;d <br/>
feel that way once we got home from the conference.<br/>
3) The 4-day weekend was the earliest &quot;easy out&quot; I could get. It went <br/>
rather smoothly, since he was out of school the 4 days, as the rest <br/>
of the school was, and then he just didn&#39;t go back.<br/>
4) He was begging me to do it asap, and didn&#39;t want to wait until the <br/>
end of the school year. I had to side with him on this, even though <br/>
my husband wanted to wait. I didn&#39;t see much good in making him go to <br/>
school a few more months when we were going to be &#39;deschooling&#39; soon, <br/>
anyway.<br/>
5) Homework was getting to be unbearable, and the more we thought <br/>
about homeschooling, the less he wanted to do the work, and the less <br/>
I wanted to &#39;make&#39; him get it done...<br/>
<br/>
We just wanted to get on with our REAL LIVES!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to unschool from the start. Since we were in the process <br/>
of &#39;de-schooling&#39;, it was basically unschooling. In the first few <br/>
weeks, my son built a wooden catapult, and a rope ladder to climb a <br/>
tree in our yard. He was so excited to have the time to do the things <br/>
he really liked to do, but didn&#39;t have time while in school.<br/>
As time went on, my husband started worrying... out loud... that our <br/>
son was not learning anything, and so we bought a couple of workbooks <br/>
that we did maybe 2 pages of, and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of this school year, I announced that this was the 1st <br/>
school year that we weren&#39;t enrolling him in school! It was nice.<br/>
<br/>
My son asked for some sort of curriculum, and although I was <br/>
surprised, this is unschooling- child-led, so I got him a book from <br/>
the book store, &quot;Complete 5th grade Curriculum&quot;. I was a bit <br/>
skeptical, but he enjoys occasionally working on pages- especially <br/>
math!<br/>
I also purchased a placemat with the periodic table of elements on <br/>
it, since he said he wanted to learn about that.<br/>
We don&#39;t make him work in the workbook; he just does it when he&#39;s <br/>
interested. He said he wants to finish it by the end of the school <br/>
year. <br/>
That&#39;s fine with me! As long as he is comfortable with it- he is <br/>
setting his own goals, and that is so much better than what we were <br/>
dealing with at school before he left.<br/>
<br/>
I definately recommend leaving school as soon as possible, as long as <br/>
that works with the rest of your life. I don&#39;t think there is any <br/>
perfect time (other that NOW, or YESTERDAY!.. LAST YEAR!).<br/>
<br/>
But I do feel that the less mental stress your child has, the better, <br/>
and if that means leaving school now, then that sounds about right to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all, Just wanted to introduce myself and maybe get a bit of <br/>
input <br/>
&gt; about my situation. I have a son who is 11 years old and is <br/>
currently <br/>
&gt; enrolled in public school. He is having a lot of difficulty in both <br/>
&gt; academics and in the social life there.  I&#39;m not new to <br/>
homeschooling as <br/>
&gt; I homeschooled my daughter for three years between 6th and 9th <br/>
grades. I <br/>
&gt; took her out for the same reason I am thinking about taking my son <br/>
out, <br/>
&gt; bullying by other students, and low academics, not because they <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; excel, but because the constant pressures of other kids in the <br/>
school <br/>
&gt; causes them to hate the whole school experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My daughter was bullied constantly, and had low scores because she <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t concentrate. Both of my kids aren&#39;t the athletic, popular <br/>
&gt; types, they both tend to march to the beat of a different drummer <br/>
due to <br/>
&gt; bipolar disorder, and tend to get singled out by other kids in the <br/>
&gt; school environment. I had zero cooperation from the school system <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; then with my daughter because their whole attitude was you had to <br/>
let <br/>
&gt; kids work things like that out amongst themselves. Since Columbine, <br/>
&gt; attitudes have changed and my son&#39;s school has been quicker to stop <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; harassment,  but have not put an end to it. Other kids know my son <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; quick to come to tears and seem to like to try their best to push <br/>
his <br/>
&gt; buttons. His grades have been falling steadily over the past few <br/>
years <br/>
&gt; due to this. He had an IQ test early on and he is brilliant, like <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; daughter, but can&#39;t get past the reams of homework on his bad days, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; is constantly in turmoil due to the bipolar disorder and <br/>
environment at <br/>
&gt; school. He is getting more depressed and I feel like the school <br/>
system <br/>
&gt; is just making his symptoms worse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I allowed my daughter to be in charge of whether or not she was <br/>
&gt; homeschooled and eventually she decided she wanted to go back and I <br/>
&gt; honored that choice. She went back much better able to do the <br/>
school <br/>
&gt; work and much better able to handle things other kids threw at her. <br/>
She <br/>
&gt; is now 25 and attending a community college.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I kind of unschooled my daughter for the years I had her at home, <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; that I didn&#39;t have a super structured curriculum, but would really <br/>
&gt; prefer to unschool my son completely. I&#39;m just wondering if there <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; others out there who have gone from years of structured public <br/>
schooling <br/>
&gt; to unschooling and how hard was it to make the switch? Should I <br/>
expect <br/>
&gt; my son to go through a period of not wanting to do anything at all, <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; should I try and just do things that pique his interest and let it <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; from there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another question for anyone out there who went from public schools <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; unschooling is, should I wait until the beginning of a school year <br/>
to do <br/>
&gt; it, or just yank him out in the middle of a year? With my daughter, <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; started at the beginning of a new school year, so there were no <br/>
problems <br/>
&gt; really, other than some nasty comments from the principal of the <br/>
school <br/>
&gt; she was supposed to be going to. I work seasonally, so can&#39;t really <br/>
take <br/>
&gt; him out just yet, due to not having anyone to be here at home with <br/>
him. <br/>
&gt; My work ends in November though, so I would be able to do it at <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; time, then make arrangements by next summer before work picks up <br/>
again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point it really is a matter of his mental health that is so <br/>
much <br/>
&gt; of an issue. I don&#39;t know if he can handle this kind of stress much <br/>
&gt; longer. I have talked with him openly of course, and want it to be <br/>
his <br/>
&gt; decision like it was with my daughter to stay or leave the PS <br/>
system and <br/>
&gt; he is all ready to give it a whirl, but I&#39;m just not sure if I <br/>
should go <br/>
&gt; the unschooled route or the more structured route.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening if nothing else!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842604010">~~I think I am going to go ahead and take<br/>
him out after the Christmas holidays. That way it should give me<br/>
enough time to get up with the state and meet the requirements for<br/>
homeschooling, plus by that time work will be over and I won&#39;t have<br/>
that causing problems. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be really blunt here. Just picture me as a good friend<br/>
sitting and having tea with you and discussing unschooling.:)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re aiding and abetting the damage of school. You are part of the<br/>
hurt he&#39;s experiencing in his life right now. It is your job to be his<br/>
advocate and get him OUT of that environment as soon as possible.<br/>
There is no need to meet state requirements first. Get him OUT first,<br/>
then worry about the legalities.<br/>
<br/>
Take him to work with you or find a friend for him to hang out with.<br/>
I&#39;m being so blunt here because I screwed this one up myself! I have<br/>
nothing but regret for making my child finish the school year (I<br/>
realize you aren&#39;t doing this, but any day spent in torture is one day<br/>
too many) in kindergarten and he still remembers the stress quite clearly.<br/>
<br/>
It is undermining your relationship with him to make him go somewhere<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to be. Unschooling is hugely about relationships and<br/>
trust. He needs an adult he can trust to protect his spirit right now.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please get him out of there right now. It&#39;s crushing<br/>
his soul. It might be hard to take that first leap into the unknown,<br/>
but the net will appear, I promise.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771954687">Thanks so much for your input, that helps a bunch. We have decided to <br/>
take him out of school in November, not even wait for the school break. <br/>
The main thing is waiting until my work is over in the beginning of the <br/>
month then I will be completely free.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to have to do a bit of de-schooling first too. I need to <br/>
make him enjoy learning again, not forcing him back into the same thing. <br/>
which is why I have decided to unschool not homeschool. It&#39;s funny too, <br/>
because I thought about making a trebuchet with him! What 11 year old <br/>
boy does not want to fling things? ;) At any rate, we won&#39;t be doing <br/>
anything structured or remotely schoolish for the rest of this year <br/>
unless it is something HE wants to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092464803">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate that! Sometimes you need a bit of a kick in the rear <br/>
instead of sympathy to get you in gear! I won&#39;t be waiting much longer <br/>
at all, but I do have to get through this work season. I could take him <br/>
with me, but due to the work I do, it would be highly unhealthy for him. <br/>
  I contract survey work with the department of agriculture, and taking <br/>
him out with me would mean subjecting him to a lot of harsh and damaging <br/>
chemicals, including herbicides, pesticides and defoliants. Not exactly <br/>
the healthiest of situations. Heck, I&#39;m even thinking seriously about <br/>
quitting myself after this year due to the chemicals.<br/>
<br/>
However, I will be taking him out the moment my work ends for the year, <br/>
which is a lot sooner than Christmas. Probably the beginning of November <br/>
at the latest. I will however, change my schedule and keep him at home <br/>
on any days he has bouts of severe depression, rather than sending him <br/>
to school on those days. If that doesn&#39;t equate to the need for a &quot;sick <br/>
day&quot; nothing else will.<br/>
<br/>
Already he is healing, just knowing that it is only for a limited time. <br/>
It seems to have given him a boost in the past few days just knowing <br/>
that this isn&#39;t going to be going on for long. He is such a sensitive <br/>
and bright young man and really one of my best friends even at such a <br/>
young age.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for being blunt, I appreciate it!<br/>

should have said, &quot;I want to see him enjoy learning again on his own.&quot; I <br/>

that being around me will probably convey that love of learning more <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895352599">I have a suggestion for you, if you haven&#39;t thought of it yet - do his <br/>
homework for him for these last few weeks of school if you can&#39;t pull <br/>
him out and the school requires the stuff. I did Ray&#39;s the few weeks <br/>
after he moved in but we didn&#39;t have &quot;permission&quot; from his (custodial) <br/>
mom to homeschool and it massively reduced his stress level - at his <br/>
school a missed hw assignment meant lost recess or detention! If your <br/>
guy&#39;s school isn&#39;t as harsh, then naturally you can drop the homework <br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
One of the other advantages I found in doing Ray&#39;s hw those few weeks <br/>
is that I could see exactly what kind of trivial crud was being fed to <br/>
him in the name of education. It certainly gave me a boost of <br/>
confidence!<br/>
