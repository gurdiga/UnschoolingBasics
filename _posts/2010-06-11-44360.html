<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727358479">I know a family, the Millers, who have traveled all over the world by<br/>
bicycle with their four children (ages 7-13).  Their blog and website is at<br/>

They aren&#39;t &quot;technically&quot; unschoolers -- a lot of what they do might be<br/>
considered &quot;schooly,&quot; but they have been all over Europe, northern Africa,<br/>
parts of Mexico and Guatemala, and various other places I can&#39;t remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518543598">My friend, Lisa, has started writing a series of kids books about an RV<br/>
homeschooling family. Lisa is an unschooler so the characters are pretty<br/>
unschooly too.  She also has a link &quot;RV families&quot; on her page with<br/>
interviews you might find interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133645769">I know there is a group of unschoolers on www.couchsurfing.com  They are not<br/>
typically full time travelers, but it is an interesting way to connect with<br/>
unschooling families who travel. If you explore the site/ group I am sure<br/>
you will discover some interesting blogs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814358692">Hello Rachelle,<br/>
Even though we are currently finishing some<br/>
long-term writing and research projects in Montreal, we consider travel<br/>
to be an integral aspect of our living in and learning about the world.<br/>
I haven&#39;t been updating our travel blog regularly lately, but plan to<br/>
take care of that this autumn. I hope you&#39;ll find useful and<br/>
interesting what we have there so far:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368773052">Hi, I was just wondering if anyone knows what kind of work my web developer husband or I could do while living out on the road? I would love to drive across canada and the states with our 3 children. I&#39;m not sure how we would earn enough money to pay for gas/diesel, campground fees, food, clothing and other things like scrapbook supplies (love scrapbooking). If you&#39;ve got any tips I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
just a little background info:<br/>
my husband&#39;s not too keen on being a handyman. he likes technology and gadgets. he says it would be nice to build websites for contract work while on the road. i finished highschool and (insert sarcasm here )have no post secondary pieces of paper that say i&#39;m certified to do anything, except speak french, which i hardly do ;). i do like to crochet and sew, even though i&#39;m not a superstar at it yet. oh and i love to cook!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13441875">oooh what a timely post :) We are just starting to talk about something like this. We&#39;re tired of moving new places only to get a bit settled and then be ready to up and move again. Wondering if it wouldn&#39;t be lots more fun to simply take the &quot;house&quot; with us. Maybe eventually we&#39;d find the place we want to put down roots...and maybe not ;) <br/>
