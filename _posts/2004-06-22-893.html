<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474000831">&quot;That poster was talking about her intentions to continue to direct the<br/>
teaching of her children. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree with Robyn.<br/>
I kind of figured we had a newer member to the list, that is definitely interested in unschooling, but not actually unschooling yet. That&#39;s ok. This list is to help people learn about unschooling, we don&#39;t expect everyone to have the same understanding. But if someone posts about her teaching units she&#39;s got planned, it WILL be questioned here. That&#39;s what the list if about.<br/>
In the guidelines we specifically remind people to not post about that which they don&#39;t want to discuss...if you post it here, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s discuss how teaching never needs to happen in an unschooling home. Let&#39;s talk about how teaching implies the power is with the teacher, not the learner, and how unschooling kids KNOW they have the power to learn anything in their own way, because they&#39;ve not had the notion crammed into their heads that they NEED someone else (with all the answers/power) to teach them.<br/>
<br/>
My dear, sweet stargirl..Sierra, informed me that she didn&#39;t need gymnastics class anymore. She told me to call them and tell them she won&#39;t be back, because she can teach herself gymnastics just fine.<br/>
We called for a refund yesterday.:)<br/>
<br/>
Teaching and learning do not go hand in hand, as we&#39;ve all been taught to think (imagine that!) We don&#39;t need to &quot;delve into history&quot; because history is all around us, everyday and we explore it with the same interest that we pursue all else. Not in units, not in packages, not in a curriculum of any kind, just real life as it naturally swirls into our paths.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295802914">Great idea -- I think we can encourage people to this way of thinking about <br/>
learning. It is not a change that happens overnight, however. Like most big <br/>
changes. <br/>
<br/>
If someone mentioned unit studies to me, I might ask something about what <br/>
their child enjoyed during the unit, how they took off from there, etc. <br/>
<br/>
One example of using a structured learning tool in my house was the book I <br/>
bought for DD when she demanded to learn how to read -- &quot;Everyone but me knows <br/>
how to read! I want to know NOW!&quot; She was about 6, had some smattering of <br/>
reading ability, recognized letters/sounds, a very beginning reader I would say but <br/>
did not have a firm grip on reading and was frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
We went online and browsed books and together we chose the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; <br/>
book. Now, if you have seen this book, you will know it is not particualrly <br/>
unschooling. In and of itself. If I told you I was using this book to help my <br/>
daughter learn to read, you&#39;d blink hard if I said it was unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
But for us, it was.<br/>
<br/>
We opened the book and realized that about the first 1/3 was stuff she <br/>
already knew, we jumped ahead to things she did not know, and proceeded from there. <br/>
We did about the middle 1/3 of the book and then stopped. We stopped because <br/>
she could then read well enough to do what she wanted to do and has since just <br/>
read everything in sight, going to the library all the time, picking out her <br/>
books, etc. She is 9 now and an excellent, confident reader.<br/>
<br/>
So, there are ways and there are ways, imo, to use material. I think people <br/>
may rely on schoolish things for a while as they transition to more unschoolish <br/>
ways. Or, like us, they may use a schoolish tool when it is appropriate to <br/>
learn something -- not all such tools are useless. <br/>
<br/>
Encouraging others to see that using whatever tool works, but owning the <br/>
knowledge and the decision to use the tool; seeing a positive step when it is <br/>
taken, a step toward learning and away from rigid hierarchical learning setups; <br/>
supporting people along the bumpy road as they individually get as far as they <br/>
need to -- these seem helpful to me in supporting unschoolers.<br/>

I think the word teaching is fine to use.  One needs to really examine ones<br/>
attitude when sharing/ teaching so that we can catch ourselves if we become<br/>
too controlling or condescending.  Once the mutual respect is in place in<br/>
the relationship, there is no need to wory about whether we are teaching,<br/>
instructing, facilitating learning, pointing out something interesting,<br/>
whatever.  It&#39;s all good in the context of a mutually respectful<br/>
relationship.  I say Trayton taught me something.  And truly, I was not<br/>
interested in Mario per se except that it&#39;s something that interests him. A<br/>
lot.  And I love *him*.  So having him teach me that level was enjoyable for<br/>
me because I got to admire how beautifully he communicates and enjoy his<br/>
passion.  I think to say I learned from him instead of he taught me does rob<br/>
a little of the due credit from him.<br/>
<br/>
I do think the underlying message of Ren&#39;s first response is really<br/>
important though.  That is, as I understand it, We as the big people are not<br/>
here to drive the learning that takes place in our children.  They get to<br/>
drive.  We are guides and facilitators not dictators and controllers.  I<br/>
think teaching can be done in a controlling relationship but that is not the<br/>
only place it is done.  Many of us take private lessons in one form or<br/>
another and are taught the basics of piano or ice-skating or marshal arts.<br/>
Some instructors are bad, unkind, or ineffective others are wonderful<br/>
empathic people for whom teaching is their highest calling.  The word is<br/>
loaded because of the many times it is used to mean &quot;making someone learn.&quot;<br/>
So if I have gotten past that particular prejudice I&#39;m inclined to reclaim<br/>
the word for my own altruistic purposes.</div>

try really hard not to think about &quot;teaching&quot; - but to replace it with <br/>
&quot;learning.&quot;<br/>

My mom used to get so irritated with me because I said I never taught <br/>
my children to read. She said I did ALL the right things to create a <br/>
print-rich environment so that they would learn to read happily and <br/>
easily when the time was right for them - and that THAT was the best <br/>
teaching there is.<br/>
<br/>
She was right. But - still - if you&#39;re new to unschooling it will <br/>
benefit you greatly not to think about teaching, just learning. It is <br/>
looking at it from a different perspective and it is helpful to do <br/>
that.<br/>

a greater understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But even at home, if we&#39;re using teaching to mean learning, when our kids<br/>
are immersed in a world where learning means being taught, it has the<br/>
potential to not help them think clearly during the times when the<br/>
distinctions are important.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a given or a mandate. No one can reach into your home and make<br/>
you stop. And obviously I have no way of knowing even what goes on in my own<br/>
daughter&#39;s head ;-) It&#39;s just an idea to try on and turn over and examine.<br/>

<br/>
Gently....very gently.<br/>
If a teen is used to the idea that she must be told what/when to learn, it&#39;s going to be a bit scary to have the idea thrown at her that SHE is now responsible for her own learning.<br/>
Don&#39;t make her feel she&#39;s on her own, be her partner in this. Talk, talk, talk...about what she loves, what she would love to do (help her plan the PERFECT day) and show her that you are there to help her get where she needs to go. There is nothing worse than feeling like you&#39;re on your own with no idea of where to go.<br/>
Be her access to the world and her partner in learning.<br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll want to pursue some schoolish looking things for a while, if that helps her get through the transition..fine.<br/>
But point out the lovely, meandering side paths you could check out.<br/>
Do things for the pure joy of it, help her reclaim that childlike joy of discovery.<br/>
Great healing happens when joy is the focus, you can help her with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780386097">*** How would you go about explaining to a teen, who expects<br/>
to be taught, that the reigns are being turned over to them?  That it is<br/>
their responsibility to learn, not your responsibility to teach them?***<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.  If a person has come to believe, through public schooling or<br/>
school at home, that learning is something must be imparted by a teacher<br/>
- someone trained - an expert,  it could be very intimidating to be told<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; is now their responsibility.   I wouldn&#39;t talk about it in<br/>
those terms at all.<br/>
<br/>
I would talk about my own developing ideas about learning.  I would<br/>
explore with that person, my new view of learning and teaching and the<br/>
value of self discovery.   I would try to find examples of people who<br/>
pursued a passion and ended up doing the things they love.  I would talk<br/>
about the way humans learned before there was school.   I would talk<br/>
about the fact that each child is born already suited to life as a human,<br/>
and will naturally be interested in the things humans are interested in. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would try to let go of any expectation I might have that the person<br/>
needed to be making progress toward a goal.  The stress of other people&#39;s<br/>
expectations of us, especially when we&#39;re young, can be stifling to<br/>
imagination and creativity and possibility.   They might be making<br/>
progress in ways that aren&#39;t visible.  They might be gaining self<br/>
confidence, adjusting to new freedom, exploring feelings, etc.  I would<br/>
work at trusting their process.  <br/>
<br/>
I would offer to help them find the things they&#39;d like to do.  I&#39;d be<br/>
sympathetic if they had trouble deciding.  I would  try to give them more<br/>
exposure to things they like and I&#39;d take them to new and interesting<br/>
places. <br/>
<br/>
I would not say the equivalent of &quot;It&#39;s all up to you now.&quot;  I think that<br/>
could be intimidating if someone had always believed they needed the help<br/>
of an expert in order to learn.   They could feel unprepared and<br/>
unqualified.  <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t exactly do that either. What I&#39;d probably ask is, &quot;If you had all <br/>
the time and resources you needed, what would you do? What would you learn <br/>
about?&quot;<br/>
I&#39;d listen, maybe even take notes if it would help get it all. Then I&#39;d say, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll help you, if you like.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As adults we have resources and experiences that our kids and teens don&#39;t <br/>
have. We can drive. We have money. We know more people and know more about what&#39;s <br/>
in the world. We can be a major resource for our kids.<br/>

Barbara Sher is going to one of the speakers at the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling conference. Her book, Wishcraft, has influenced my own unschooling journey <br/>
more than any other, and it&#39;s not a book about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an excerpt from the book (available online and free, by the way, at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wishcraft.com/)">http://wishcraft.com/)</a> that made me an unschooling mama (although I didn&#39;t know <br/>
it at the time):<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;4. Were you encouraged to explore all your own talents and interests even <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if they changed from day to day? <br/>
That means when you came in at the age of 7 and said, “Mama, I am going to be <br/>
a movie star,” she said, “You know, you might be good at that.” Then she got <br/>
out the Super-8, let you put on her makeup, took a movie of you, let you see <br/>
it, and showed you and your best friend how to use the camera. And two days or <br/>
two months later, when you announced, “I’m given up my career as an actress. <br/>
I’ve decided to be a fireman and rescue people, “ she said, “Sounds good to <br/>
me. Want to go over to the firehouse and look at the engines?” The key word is <br/>
explore. Childhood is a great time for trying out all the myriad <br/>
possibilities of your being. (Adulthood isn’t a bad time for doing that either, as you’ll <br/>
find out as we go along.) And taking a child’s talents and interests “<br/>
seriously” does not mean expecting a 7-year-old to choose her lifetime career.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Even if you just read that one chapter of Barbara&#39;s book, it can change <br/>
everything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366319729">Dear Ren, Jamye, Cris, Deb, and Kathryn:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your responses to my question about handing over the<br/>
reigns to a teen.  You&#39;ve given me a lot to consider.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear stories of anyone else who has experienced this transition.<br/>
