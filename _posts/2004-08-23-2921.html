<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963864209">I need some help from those of you who are having to keep records.<br/>
I have the educationese terms, but am having such a hard time <br/>
figuring out what applies to what.<br/>
  Like when they are in battle with GI Joes, or they are shooting <br/>
rubber band guns at pop cans.  They gotta be learning something, <br/>
right?  or am I wrong on this one????<br/>
  They get so envolved in their &quot;dramtic play&quot; with their things that <br/>
I just get lost on how to word this in our portfolio.  <br/>
  BTW, we don&#39;t have to turn this in to anyone, but the state of MO. <br/>
says to keep for evidence in case we are questioned. So far school <br/>
has turned us in one time when we stopped PS, I&#39;m hoping that was the <br/>
end of it all.  So i&#39;m not sure how deep i have to go into this day <br/>
to day record keeping (but it has opened my eyes to how they are <br/>
learning while playing).  So thats why i&#39;m wondering how to word the <br/>
above &quot;dramtic play&quot; in school terms, as most days are spent doing <br/>
nothing but that.  well, for now anyway, i think summer was spent <br/>
with they xbox!<br/>
  thanks<br/>
syndi  oohhh, one more thing, do you all think we should sign up for <br/>

<br/>
just my 2-cents<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m christian -- so i joined in the wee beginning of this journey.  Came to <br/>
realize that I didn&#39;t need to take my very hard-earned money and give it to <br/>
someone on the &#39;off-chance&#39; that someone &#39;might&#39; come knocking.  Plus, I began to <br/>
gain more confidence in our decision and became more comfortable with our <br/>
choices.  So we only did the HSLDA thing for one year.  It just didn&#39;t make sense <br/>
to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that we are &#39;unschooling&#39; -- I don&#39;t even think in terms of &#39;explaining&#39; <br/>
myself to anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
With regard to your having to document -- keep a journal.  It&#39;s a great way <br/>
of looking back over the years.  And take lots of pics!  They grow so fast!  If <br/>
you go somewhere - grab the camera!  If they make something - take a pic.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, just my 2-cents.<br/>

Others have addressed the HSLDA issue.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of educationese for your state, the local home education community<br/>
is probably your greatest resource. Try www.NHEN.org for local statutes and<br/>
organizations. <br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with having to do this &quot;subjecting&quot; is the fluidity and<br/>
connectivity of all that our kids enjoy is compromised in our minds. It sure<br/>
is annoying to have to be reversing the thought processes we have sometimes<br/>
struggled to move out of in our own deschooling journeys. Have you tried<br/>
simply journaling what they did, without the educationese necessarily? Maybe<br/>
that would be enough when you look at the big picture at the end of a month<br/>
or a year. You can&#39;t stop them from learning really.<br/>
