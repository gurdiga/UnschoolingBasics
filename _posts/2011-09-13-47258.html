<div id="ygrps-yiv-567879611">Hello everyone! I&#39;m Kimmie, from Fort Worth, TX. I have 3 boys, ages 9 (almost 10), 8, and 2. They had been in public school until this year, except for a 6 week stint at home &quot;schooling&quot; two years ago. That was awful, because I wasn&#39;t sure what to do, and was freaking out, and let other people inform me and those ideas made them worse, so I just sent them back because I was so depressed.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844800665">Hi Kimmie, I&#39;m Meredith. I have one &quot;always unschooled&quot; daughter who is 10 and a stepson who will be 18 in two weeks! Wooo Hoo! He&#39;s gone through some homeschooling and then school and finally unschooling so I&#39;ve had a chance to see just how much unschooling can benefit a kid who has had a rough ride through traditional education and parenting. I soooo wish we&#39;d started sooner!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you haven&#39;t found them yet, here are some good sources of information about whole life unschooling:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995251489">Hi Kimmie,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! I am originally from the DFW area too.  I live in North Carolina now.  I had my oldest in public school too until she started 3rd grade.  It was not a good experience.  I have been unschooling for a couple of years now and life is so <br/>
much better!  <br/>
