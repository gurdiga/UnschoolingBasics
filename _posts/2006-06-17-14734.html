<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What&#39;s hard for me to get ahold of here is that I&#39;m acquainted with<br/>
&gt; so many people in my life who are the most loving, happy, serene,<br/>
&gt; sure, successful, and settled individuals who were raised in what<br/>
&gt; many here would call &quot;conventional&quot; households, so I&#39;m not making the<br/>
&gt; connection with mindful vs. conventional.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &quot;mindful vs. conventional&quot; thing as much as it&#39;s<br/>
degrees of mindfulness.  There are mindful parents I know, that do<br/>
some things in a more conventional manner. The difference is they<br/>
listen and try to understand their children, are calm and kind etc...<br/>
BUT, I can&#39;t separate respecting my children in certain areas, but not<br/>
in others. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think those that are more mindful in LIFE (not just parenting) are<br/>
most capable of navigating this journey we&#39;re on. Mindfulness is a<br/>
high level of awareness, a way of BEING that transcends circumstances.<br/>
The more mindful we are, the more balanced/healthy and successful we<br/>
are in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness as applied to parenting fosters deep and abiding trust<br/>
between ourselves and our children. It&#39;s important for that awareness<br/>
to be present for this Radical unschooling thing to work.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking at the conference with some people I admire very much.<br/>
We discussed that the FREEDOM part is only half of the picture!!<br/>
Kids running amok, damaging property or not being concerned about how<br/>
they affect anyone is NOT radical unschooling. AWARENESS must be<br/>
present for the freedom part to work well.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that some manner of conventional parenting (rules,<br/>
bedtimes etc..) is better than freedom without awareness. They go<br/>
together.<br/>
