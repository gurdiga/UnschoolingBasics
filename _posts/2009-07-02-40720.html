      Welcome to sign our petition <br/>
      The Swedish Government is trying to pull the rug from underneath the few already hard pressed home-educating families in Sweden, in their proposal for a new School Law. <br/>
<br/>
      We will not sit still and passively watch while our kids are forced (!) to school, after so many years in what they love: To learn in their own pace, in a safe environment, and to develop without social limitations. <br/>
<br/>
      A legal and very successful alternative to school is about to be erased, without any grounds or research! <br/>
<br/>
      For this reason, we ask you to join in supporting our work - sign the petition! <br/>
<br/>
      Please note: You will need to validate your signature in an email you will receive shortly after signing. This email contains a link for yoiu to click on. Only after you have clicked on the link, your signature will count. <br/>
