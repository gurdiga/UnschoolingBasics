<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581953245">I have a 15 yo ds who uses tv shows vs books so....how would I go about <br/>
putting that into a portfolio/transcript.  I wondered if there are any <br/>
resources with examples of these documents from unschooling perspective <br/>
so I can get an idea of how to communicate this.  My son isn&#39;t sure <br/>
what he wants to do so I want college to be an option if he chooses.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would help tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kim S</div>
