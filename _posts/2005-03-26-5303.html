<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102948883">I also forgot to add, that I&#39;m the resident &quot;expert&quot; on Florida, and <br/>
you&#39;re right, it&#39;s a very easy state to unschool in.<br/>
<br/>
If you email me offlist, I may be able to put you in contact with <br/>
other unschoolers in your area. Heck, if you&#39;re near Pensacola, have I <br/>
got a GREAT group for you!;)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Robyn and Danielle (also here at this list) run <br/>
Alwaysunschooled, a list for younger &quot;pre-unschoolers&quot; if you&#39;re <br/>
interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome.<br/>
