<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510020865">Hi everyone!<br/>
I&#39;m new here. My two oldest children have both graduated from public <br/>
school, but my &quot;baby&quot; has had difficulty since he started kindergarden. <br/>
He is incredibly smart, but &quot;bookwork&quot; drives him nuts! Even his <br/>
teachers have said that he doodles when he should be taking notes, but <br/>
when asked about the lesson, he can almost repeat verbatim what she <br/>
said. So, to avoid another year of struggle, I decided to home school <br/>
this year. OMG!!! Bookwork drives the child nuts, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
concentrate worth a flip! However, if we go on a field trip, he pays <br/>
very close attention and gets so much from it. <br/>
My problem... how do I document this for &quot;report cards&quot;, and have paper <br/>
work to show if the child wants to attend college? How do I get over <br/>
this feeling that I&#39;m doing something wrong by not using books all of <br/>
the time?<br/>
Geez, sorry to make this so long, but this has really been bothering me.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Tina</div>

This was my child in school as well!   She&#39;s a right brained learner <br/>
and doodling helps her to concentrate.   Check out <br/>
www.visualspatial.org and the book &quot;Upside Down Brilliance&quot; by Linda <br/>
Silverman.   Her difficulites in school drove me to find the &quot;answer&quot; <br/>
and I eventually came to homeschooling and unschooling (which I had <br/>
never heard of 3 or 4 years ago).  My dd is 14 and I pulled her from <br/>
school after 6th grade.  <br/>

Each state is different as far as what they require (is that&#39;s what <br/>
you mean by &quot;report cards&quot; or are you referring to grades for a <br/>
diploma?).  Have you read any books etc about unschooling? The book <br/>
that first that &quot;did it&quot; for me was &quot;Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden <br/>
Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot; by John Taylor Gatto&quot;.   Others <br/>
are &quot;Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With <br/>
or Without School&quot; By Grace Llewellyn and &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot; By <br/>
Grace Llewellyn.  Anything by John Holt (Learning All The Time, How <br/>
Children Learn, How Children Fail, Teach your own etc).<br/>
&quot;Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life&quot; by Rue Kream is <br/>
wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
There are some great websites as well (hopefully someone can post <br/>
them quicker than I can, I can&#39;t find my list!).<br/>
<br/>
How old is your son?  How long has he been out of school?   He needs <br/>
to deschool.   The common &quot;rule&quot; is one month of deschooling for <br/>
every year he was in school.   (I included K and day care!).    Let <br/>
him heal.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s definitely a paradigm shift.  You will find YOU need to deschool <br/>
even more than your child, to change the way you look at learning.   <br/>
Before I started reading and understanding, I, too, thought that my <br/>
dd had to fit into the way the schools were &quot;teaching&quot;.   What I know <br/>
now is that she is not &quot;broken&quot; and does not need to be &quot;fixed&quot;!<br/>
