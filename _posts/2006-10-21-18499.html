It might be helpful to stop thinking of our children&#39;s things as &quot;mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have stuff around the house don&#39;t we?  We put rugs on the floor and we <br/>
put doo-dads, plants, baskets, photos, vases, collectables, around the <br/>
house.  Why are those things &quot;decor&quot; and our children&#39;s things &quot;mess?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true, my household &quot;decor&quot; is different from my rug making stuff when <br/>
I&#39;ve pulled it out and I&#39;m cutting, or whatever.  And it&#39;s different from my <br/>
writing stuff when I have post-it notes sticking on everything or recipe <br/>
card notes spread out on the coffee table.   But I seldom think of my stuff <br/>
as &quot;mess.&quot;  I think of it as &quot;stuff.&quot;   Is that not enough difference to <br/>
wonder about? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you think of your own stuff as &quot;mess&quot; maybe you could change that in your <br/>
minds to &quot;stuff.&quot;   Then you could begin to make that shift from negative to <br/>
positive.  If you can view your things, your stuff, and your children&#39;s <br/>
stuff as belonging in the house equally with rugs and photos and whatnot <br/>
then it is less stress to you when &quot;stuff&quot; is left out.<br/>
<br/>
There will be times when you want to move some stuff so people can sit and <br/>
eat or sit and watch TV or get up and dance but if it&#39;s not a &quot;mess to clean <br/>
up&quot; and it&#39;s simply &quot;stuff to move or put away&quot; it&#39;s different in your head, <br/>
it&#39;s not stress inducing, doesn&#39;t attach bad feelings or resentment.<br/>
<br/>
I think my house could be a lot more convenient to my husband if I didn&#39;t <br/>
have a potted plant on every flat surface.  He could stack his car manuals <br/>
there instead.   If I didn&#39;t have wooden ducks on the piano he could put his <br/>
baseball caps up there.  So, my &quot;decor&quot; really could be viewed by other <br/>
family members as &quot;mess in the way of their stuff&quot; if they wanted to look at <br/>
it like that.<br/>
<br/>
If you (generic/general you) didn&#39;t have that table crammed with <br/>
photographs, couldn&#39;t your kids use it to build a Lego castle?  Why haven&#39;t <br/>
you cleaned up that mess? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids should be able to have their things around them.  Kids are closer to <br/>
the floor and the seats of chairs and sofas.  Those are the natural, logical <br/>
places for kid things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Good point.<br/>
Last summer when we were visiting family in Alaska, we stayed at my<br/>
Grandma&#39;s house for a few days. One afternoon we were all in a hurry<br/>
to get somewhere and we left a lot of toys all over her basement. On<br/>
the way out the door I said &quot;Sorry we&#39;re leaving a disaster, we&#39;ll get<br/>
it when we get back&quot;  to which she responded<br/>
&quot;Children&#39;s play is NOT disaster!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just hugged her and told her how cool she is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489808324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It might be helpful to stop thinking of our children&#39;s things <br/>
 </span></blockquote>as &quot;mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My original post was just stating that the sunroom and their bedrooms <br/>
are theirs to create whatever they will and I don&#39;t have to nag them <br/>
about picking it up off the floor.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that their <br/>
stuff is &quot;mess&quot; and mine is &quot;decor&quot;.  I just conveyed our solution to <br/>
our family cleaning up process.  We all clean up our own mess in the <br/>
common areas of the house (family room, kitchen, dining room) but <br/>
other areas like our bedrooms and the sunroom are ours to do with as <br/>
we please.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I was trying to say, was I don&#39;t mind when their areas <br/>
become messy, i.e. not orderly.  When our sunroom has more toys on the <br/>
floor than floor space I do think that is messy.  Just when I have <br/>
more sewing fabric on the table than table space that is messy.  Or <br/>
when hubby leaves his hunting supplies and magazines all over the <br/>
bedroom floor while he&#39;s organizing for this year&#39;s season it is messy.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s things by <br/>
calling them &#39;mess&#39;.  I just meant that I don&#39;t mind their things <br/>
being strewn all over their spaces as far as cleaning went.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
