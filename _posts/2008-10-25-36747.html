<div id="ygrps-yiv-943775990">Warning this post is whiny so I really dont blame you if you stop ready now and hit delete :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a really hard time not turning into militant mom today. Im having to stop and breathe to keep myself from barking orders at the girls even though this isnt their fault really. <br/>
<br/>
My son has been difficult all day. I went to try and scrub the poop he smeared on his walls last night and he goes and gets a canister of sea salt and dumps it all over my living room carpet. <br/>
<br/>
Vacum that up and the rest of the crumbs all over the living room floor and he goes into the bathroom wanting to take a bath. So i get him started on that and go back to the floor . I come back to check on him and find that he has smeared poop all over the counter and toilet. <br/>
<br/>
Get him dried off and a diaper on and the bathroom cleaned up. Then he is wanting to be held. i got stung by a bee yesterday and had to have ephedrine and zyrtec so i could breathe ok and still feel crappy and dizzy today so i sit down and hold him . Then think ok he needs attention so I take him running outside for a while and get him something to eat. <br/>
<br/>
I try to get back to cleaning. Loading the the dishwasher and I hear a crash. Its Nate dumping laundry soap all over the floor. <br/>
<br/>
Im exhausted. My house is no cleaner than when I started 6 hours ago. Im stepping all over clothes that he drug out of the baskets, and crumbs and hanger he threw all over the place. <br/>
<br/>
The girls nor dh are in any mood to be at all helpful today. <br/>

Chalk it up to some rough moments and go buy yourself a shop vac girl!;)<br/>
I swear, the shop vac I purchased has changed my life. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
wax poetic about such a tool, but I could. Those messes that just wore<br/>
me out in the past are no big deal now.<br/>
<br/>
When things are a bit rough around the edges, I try to change up the<br/>
activities. Bring out something different and fun, get some water play<br/>
going, anything where you can just BE with them for a while and get<br/>
everyone distracted with some fun. Even though you won&#39;t feel very fun<br/>
at that moment maybe.<br/>
<br/>
The other part of this, is learning to simply be ok with a messy,<br/>
exhausting day. That&#39;s part of living. I think there is sometimes this<br/>
illusion that unschoolers don&#39;t have really overwhelming moments or<br/>
days and feel like things aren&#39;t clicking. Life is messy! But mess<br/>
means that the people we love are right here with us, exploring away.<br/>
They&#39;re right here with us, not on a breathing tube or six feet under.<br/>
So it&#39;s all good. Even when it seems bad.;)<br/>

<br/>
lol there is also dish soap that Ive got to shampoo out of the carpet and there have been many other things. If its in my cabinets it has probably ended up on my floor &lt;g&gt;... and child locks do no good he has figured them out<br/>
<br/>
Hope things are going better and try to find a way to laugh at it&gt;?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A good nights sleep helped :) and yes I tend to end up laughing .... the fact that he has this angelic smile helps ! :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1 I&#39;m sure your wondering why is he doing this ??&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He is severly autistic and its a sensory thing. <br/>
<br/>
 my mom always said funny things to me like -- it just seemed like the thing to do&gt;  go figure.  It may be a bit late but I&#39;ll send some loving, calm, take a deep breath positive energy your way.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134896">Lol! I was looking at a shop vac a couple days ago. I&#39;m constantly clogging my reg vac hose up so maybe it will help ? <br/>
<br/>
Btw if it came across that i was upset at the girls I didnt mean it that way. they are often VERY helpful ...far more than Id ever expect ...We went drumming fri night though and they were just ready for a quiet relaxing day tucked back in their room doing their little nails, watching movies etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder about being ok with messy. Nate will be at school Monday. Im going to just ignore any mess that isnt harmful to anyone today and take him and anyone else that wants to go out to the park and to run a few errands with me. Monday I can get the place looking significantly better within a couple hours. <br/>
