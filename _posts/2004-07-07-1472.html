<div id="ygrps-yiv-806499299">Advice needed. <br/>
<br/>
 Once again I am feeling like a bad mother. Hubby and I rented a <br/>
movie, Starship Troopers 2, set the kids up in another room with lots <br/>
to do and freedom to do it. As it turns out all our daughter wants to <br/>
do is be with us. We tell her it is a scary movie about bugs and that <br/>
we would rather she not watch it. We try to explain it. But she <br/>
insists and so taking advice found here, I give in and let her. <br/>
<br/>
 OMG that was the worst, grossest, freakiest, movie I have ever seen. <br/>
Worst then resident evil. And my daughter watched it all... did not <br/>
even flinch. She wanted to watch it again after it was over. I tried <br/>
to talk to her about it. She thinks the big spiders are real, she <br/>
thinks everything on TV is real and I have no clue how to explain it <br/>
to her that it is not. And even though she wants to see it again, she <br/>
is not wanting to sleep alone or let any of us sleep in our rooms. <br/>
<br/>
 I just can not believe I let her watch that. She is only 4 years <br/>
old! I think I am the one in shock. I wish I had not seen it. <br/>
Now she will not go into a dark room alone... I asked her to draw a <br/>
picture of the monster she thinks is in my bathroom. Happy she did <br/>
not draw a spider, just a one eyed monster that is very tall! LOL <br/>
<br/>
 Ok, so I know I might be over reacting, but I remember still the <br/>
horror movies my parents let me watch as a child, and I wish they <br/>
hadn&#39;t. We do not always know what is best for us, never mind at age <br/>
4!<br/>
<br/>
  Crystal the Brave... leaving lights on for years to come! <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>
  Kimmy<br/>
<br/>
 P.S. I must say, I am doing a great job not showing her how freaked <br/>
I am about all this. Trying not to react till I have a better idea <br/>
how best to do so for her!</div>

 <br/>
Is the movie on DVD and do the possibly have any extra features?  The sometimes show the making of the movie, and show how they create the special effects.  If you sit and watch it with your daughter, showing that all of the spiders and stuff was created using a computer, it may help her see that they are not real.  Also, seeing the actors acting out some of the scenes may drive it home that it is all fake.  KWIM.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371083765">Okay, I know this sounds really wierd, but maybe you should let her <br/>
watch it over and over until she has it &quot;processed&quot; in her mind.  <br/>
Sometimes that is what they have to do to get it all figured out so <br/>
that they aren&#39;t afraid anymore.  That has happened here in our home <br/>
and as much as I wanted to &quot;protect&quot; my dd from seeing this stuff <br/>
again, I found that she really NEEDED to see it over and over to put <br/>
it all into perspective.  (Hope that makes sense.)   <br/>
<br/>
Just my humble opinion and experience.  :)<br/>

could she have insisted on watching it simply because YOU told her you <br/>
didn&#39;t want her to?  You didn&#39;t give her the option of watching for a <br/>
minute or so (without comment) for HER to decide if she wanted to stick <br/>
around or not.  Could be a possibility I suppose.<br/>

over.  They were 4 and 2-1/2 at the time.  They weren&#39;t freaked out by <br/>
the movie at all and they just wanted to watch it again and again as if <br/>
it were just another Disney movie.  LOL  They were free to watch it as <br/>
often as they wanted to and they got bored with it.  They don&#39;t really <br/>
mention it much.  They&#39;ve since seen both of the sequels at the theater <br/>
with us and they think they&#39;re just great movies.  I agree!  LOL<br/>

really don&#39;t have any advice for you on this issue other than &quot;why <br/>
can&#39;t she sleep with you?&quot;  Can&#39;t she &quot;camp&quot; on your bedroom floor <br/>
using a raft or the couch cushions?  If she wants to sleep near you <br/>
then let her sleep near you.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726979995">HI Kimmy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Not sure I have any advice, but this is one of the reasons, why I like when<br/>
dd goes to bed earlier than me and dh. We can watch what ever movie we want<br/>
then and I think as a couple we deserve some time to ourselves to watch<br/>
adult content shows that might not be appropriate for her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As a person who is still afraid of the dark (I am almost 41) and just<br/>
recently have found using EFT helping with my inability to sleep with an<br/>
open door or window in my room, because of the horror movies I watched as a<br/>
child (and then added terrorism by brothers) I am protective of my dd. She<br/>
just does not get it when I tell her it is too scary, she thinks she can<br/>
handle anything... great. but it is up to me to protect her from somethings<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Not sure what you can do now, except lots of talking and reassuring and<br/>
snuggling and no forcing her to deal with the dark sooner than she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I am no help, but I can really feel for you,<br/>

 As for why she watched the movie. It could have been her wanting to <br/>
spend time with us, she had spent all day with her Daddy and I <br/>
already and seemed very ready to go do her own thing. It would have <br/>
been best for us maybe to just set things fun up for them to do and <br/>
let them have at it if they chose without makeing it seem like it <br/>
was something to do other then being with us. I do not think she <br/>
knows we would have put the movie off to be with her, and honestly I <br/>
do not think we would have. With hubby now having one day off a week <br/>
and it having been his birthday, we wanted some time alone and <br/>
seeing it was midnight and do not force her to go to sleep at a <br/>
certain time, we seem to have little choice. He could only stay up <br/>
so late as he had a double shift today to be ready for. I envy those <br/>
people who have a bendable lifestyle and job, but my husband does <br/>
not. He is a soldier, and in his job of MI, he has to be in top <br/>
shape at all times, there is no being late to work, or being sleepy <br/>
at all on the job. I swear she only sleeps 1. when hubby is working, <br/>
and 2. when she can not possibly stay awake any longer. Some things <br/>
are very hard to make flexable. He and I both deserve to have time <br/>
together, relax and watch tv. And Goddess forbid, sometimes, be <br/>
alone even! <br/>
<br/>
 And that brings me to our bed room. On occation we let her sleep <br/>
with us, mostly when my hubby is away on missions. Sadly my husband <br/>
feels very strongly about personal space and on some things I agree. <br/>
A friend, another soldier was convicted of being a child molester by <br/>
a little girl who we believed was talking into it by her scamming <br/>
mother. In short, the military has over an 80% conviction rate. No <br/>
evidence was found, just her word against his. He lost. In this day <br/>
and age, we have to worry about such things. My husband does not <br/>
even baby sit now. We are stiving to teach Crystal that bed rooms <br/>
are personal spaces and bathrooms are to be used alone. Sorry if <br/>
this bothers some people. Not everything works for everyone. And we <br/>
must respect our feeling as much as our childs. Some people NEED <br/>
more space then others. <br/>
<br/>
  As for letting her watch it over and over. This is something I <br/>
need to think about more. I talked to hubby about it and he said it <br/>
might de-sencitise her to things and that is not something we want <br/>
or she needs. But also, it is NOTHING like the matrix, have any of <br/>
you seen it? It is the grossest movie I have ever seen. I do not <br/>
think I want it in the house, disturbing! <br/>
<br/>
 A sci-fi movie was on today, an old one called spiders. I put it on <br/>
and asked her if she wanted to watch it. She stopped for a sec, then <br/>
went back to playing. I was very happy to find something else to <br/>
watch! <br/>
<br/>
 Sorry if it seems like I am fighting advice again. Just explaining <br/>
things. VERY greatful for all the ideas, even ones I do not agree <br/>
with because it does not mean I will never agree with it and who is <br/>
to say I will not need it someday!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405440594">Jayn is afraid of only real spiders, flies, moths, beetles, roaches, small<br/>
dogs and snails (for crying out loud, snails? Yup). Sometimes she won&#39;t go<br/>
into dark rooms and other times doesn&#39;t care at all - for the same room. She<br/>
still sleeps with us regardless of whether she is in a scared mood or not. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn watches movies over and over. She asks me to fast forward scary scenes,<br/>
none of which seem to relate to her real fears as noted above, but often<br/>
(but not always) have to do with loud noises or explosions and demolitions.<br/>
Usually what may scare her the first time, like the Spiderman movie, will<br/>
subsequently become not scary when she revisits it on her own timetable.<br/>
Often she is scared by animated things ahead of live action. It is really<br/>
quite baffling and pretty much unpredictable.<br/>
<br/>
All I can do is honor all her fears, chase away the flies, and go with her<br/>
into the dark rooms as much as she wants me to. In Jayn&#39;s case (which seems<br/>
to place her entirely in the minority to judge by other folks&#39; stories) I do<br/>
not try to warn her in advance re movies or tv - since she just digs her<br/>
heels in, and usually I am wrong anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886665589">Hi Geneva,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful name!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
EFT, is Emotional Freedom Technique. All info about it from the person who<br/>
designed it can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emofree.com">http://www.emofree.com</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emofree.com/">http://www.emofree.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Essentially, you use your fingers to tap on certain areas of your body<br/>
(meridian and acupuncture points) while thinking of an emotional issue. So<br/>
you could get yourself REALLY afraid of the dark. feel it, immerse yourself<br/>
in it get it right in your face, then tap on the spots while thinking about<br/>
it. Amazingly at the end of it, you will likely feel less fear of that<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For me I had to go back to specific issues as a child that had triggered<br/>
this fear and get myself emotionally involved in the story again, then tap<br/>
on it and now I am leaving the door between the bathroom and my bedroom open<br/>
WITH the bathroom window open all night long! To me that is no small<br/>
victory. I can&#39;t leave the door open out of the bedroom yet, or the sliding<br/>
doors, but am working on it. It is literally the most powerful technique I<br/>
have ever come across and has helped me immensely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The best part is old knee jerk reactions I would have to my mom or brothers<br/>
say from childhood, that I just didn&#39;t feel like I had any control over,<br/>
have been cleared up with this. So that now, we get together and my brother<br/>
will try to push the old buttons, I see him and it for what it is and don&#39;t<br/>
react the same old way which just leaves him completely flustered and<br/>
without a clue what to do next. It has made the small amount of time I spend<br/>
with him tolerable and the time I spend with my mom, less emotionally<br/>
charged and more pleasant for us all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a manual on the site you can download and you can learn how to do<br/>
it (it is so simple, my 4 year old daughter does it on herself and us) and<br/>
start chipping away at the old things.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

Amen - I&#39;m 29 and scared of the dark too...What is EFT?  <br/>
Geneva <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure I have any advice, but this is one of the reasons, why I like when<br/>
dd goes to bed earlier than me and dh. We can watch what ever movie we want<br/>
then and I think as a couple we deserve some time to ourselves to watch<br/>
adult content shows that might not be appropriate for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a person who is still afraid of the dark (I am almost 41) and just<br/>
recently have found using EFT helping with my inability to sleep with an<br/>
open door or window in my room, because of the horror movies I watched as a<br/>
child (and then added terrorism by brothers) I am protective of my dd. She<br/>
just does not get it when I tell her it is too scary, she thinks she can<br/>
handle anything... great. but it is up to me to protect her from somethings<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what you can do now, except lots of talking and reassuring and<br/>
snuggling and no forcing her to deal with the dark sooner than she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I am no help, but I can really feel for you,<br/>

old, same old.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Advice needed. <br/>
<br/>
Once again I am feeling like a bad mother. Hubby and I rented a <br/>
movie, Starship Troopers 2, set the kids up in another room with lots <br/>
to do and freedom to do it. As it turns out all our daughter wants to <br/>
do is be with us. We tell her it is a scary movie about bugs and that <br/>
we would rather she not watch it. We try to explain it. But she <br/>
insists and so taking advice found here, I give in and let her. <br/>
<br/>
OMG that was the worst, grossest, freakiest, movie I have ever seen. <br/>
Worst then resident evil. And my daughter watched it all... did not <br/>
even flinch. She wanted to watch it again after it was over. I tried <br/>
to talk to her about it. She thinks the big spiders are real, she <br/>
thinks everything on TV is real and I have no clue how to explain it <br/>
to her that it is not. And even though she wants to see it again, she <br/>
is not wanting to sleep alone or let any of us sleep in our rooms. <br/>
<br/>
I just can not believe I let her watch that. She is only 4 years <br/>
old! I think I am the one in shock. I wish I had not seen it. <br/>
Now she will not go into a dark room alone... I asked her to draw a <br/>
picture of the monster she thinks is in my bathroom. Happy she did <br/>
not draw a spider, just a one eyed monster that is very tall! LOL <br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I know I might be over reacting, but I remember still the <br/>
horror movies my parents let me watch as a child, and I wish they <br/>
hadn&#39;t. We do not always know what is best for us, never mind at age <br/>
4!<br/>
<br/>
  Crystal the Brave... leaving lights on for years to come! <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>
  Kimmy<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I must say, I am doing a great job not showing her how freaked <br/>
I am about all this. Trying not to react till I have a better idea <br/>
how best to do so for her!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222157347">Hi Kimmy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have seen both movies and I agree with you Starship Troopers is not in the<br/>
same realm as The Matrix movies.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would hesitate to use the &quot;de-sensitize&quot; her idea as well. This might work<br/>
for some kids, it might de-sensitize them to things you don&#39;t want them to<br/>
be de-sensitized too and on another hand, it might just serve to heighten<br/>
the sensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In my family, de-sensitizing was the theme for me, as I was always perceived<br/>
to be TOO sensitive. So it was believed that if I was just tormented enough<br/>
I would stop being TOO sensitive. I had rubber spiders and snakes thrown at<br/>
me regularly, to this day I still shake when I see them in stores and can<br/>
not touch a page with them on it. I was forced into dark rooms and am still<br/>
afraid of the dark. I was forced to eat worms and still am afraid of them.<br/>
It went on and on.. I won&#39;t bore you. The end result is, all these things<br/>
were/are still funny to my family, my reaction is still funny and I am even<br/>
MORE sensitive than before. None of it de-sensitized me. it heightened my<br/>
sensitivity to having an expectation of people doing the worst to me always.<br/>
Lots of work to get over it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not suggesting that you are doing any of this, just saying that I<br/>
immediately felt caution about the idea of letting her watch it over and<br/>
over as it MIGHT de-sensitize her, but it might not. Only you will know<br/>
which way it will go as she is your child, just wanted to add that caution.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And I just wanted to say I understand your caution about the privacy issue.<br/>
I think people in the military live in a different world than the rest of us<br/>
with a completely separate list of fears and concerns, and if this is a<br/>
boundary issue for your family then you need to listen to that,<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the help. I had not thought about showing her the <br/>
making of the movie. Sadly hubby already returned the movie before <br/>
going to work. But we will rent it again. <br/>
<br/>
As for why she watched the movie. It could have been her wanting to <br/>
spend time with us, she had spent all day with her Daddy and I <br/>
already and seemed very ready to go do her own thing. It would have <br/>
been best for us maybe to just set things fun up for them to do and <br/>
let them have at it if they chose without makeing it seem like it <br/>
was something to do other then being with us. I do not think she <br/>
knows we would have put the movie off to be with her, and honestly I <br/>
do not think we would have. With hubby now having one day off a week <br/>
and it having been his birthday, we wanted some time alone and <br/>
seeing it was midnight and do not force her to go to sleep at a <br/>
certain time, we seem to have little choice. He could only stay up <br/>
so late as he had a double shift today to be ready for. I envy those <br/>
people who have a bendable lifestyle and job, but my husband does <br/>
not. He is a soldier, and in his job of MI, he has to be in top <br/>
shape at all times, there is no being late to work, or being sleepy <br/>
at all on the job. I swear she only sleeps 1. when hubby is working, <br/>
and 2. when she can not possibly stay awake any longer. Some things <br/>
are very hard to make flexable. He and I both deserve to have time <br/>
together, relax and watch tv. And Goddess forbid, sometimes, be <br/>
alone even! <br/>
<br/>
And that brings me to our bed room. On occation we let her sleep <br/>
with us, mostly when my hubby is away on missions. Sadly my husband <br/>
feels very strongly about personal space and on some things I agree. <br/>
A friend, another soldier was convicted of being a child molester by <br/>
a little girl who we believed was talking into it by her scamming <br/>
mother. In short, the military has over an 80% conviction rate. No <br/>
evidence was found, just her word against his. He lost. In this day <br/>
and age, we have to worry about such things. My husband does not <br/>
even baby sit now. We are stiving to teach Crystal that bed rooms <br/>
are personal spaces and bathrooms are to be used alone. Sorry if <br/>
this bothers some people. Not everything works for everyone. And we <br/>
must respect our feeling as much as our childs. Some people NEED <br/>
more space then others. <br/>
<br/>
  As for letting her watch it over and over. This is something I <br/>
need to think about more. I talked to hubby about it and he said it <br/>
might de-sencitise her to things and that is not something we want <br/>
or she needs. But also, it is NOTHING like the matrix, have any of <br/>
you seen it? It is the grossest movie I have ever seen. I do not <br/>
think I want it in the house, disturbing! <br/>
<br/>
A sci-fi movie was on today, an old one called spiders. I put it on <br/>
and asked her if she wanted to watch it. She stopped for a sec, then <br/>
went back to playing. I was very happy to find something else to <br/>
watch! <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it seems like I am fighting advice again. Just explaining <br/>
things. VERY greatful for all the ideas, even ones I do not agree <br/>
with because it does not mean I will never agree with it and who is <br/>
to say I will not need it someday!<br/>

&gt; seeing it was midnight and do not force her to go to sleep at a<br/>
&gt; certain time, we seem to have little choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The early years can leave us with the feeling of &quot;When&#39;s it *my* turn? I<br/>
keep giving and giving and not only is no one giving to me, I can&#39;t even<br/>
take.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that&#39;s the reality of those years and it helps loads to accept<br/>
that that&#39;s how it is for now and that it *will* change. She will get older.<br/>
She will be able to understand things on a different level.<br/>
<br/>
From how you described your old style of parenting, Crystal knew that her<br/>
needs had to be sacrificed when you decided your needs had to be met. So<br/>
even if you just express that you have needs, she&#39;s still going to hear &quot;so<br/>
here&#39;s what you have to sacrifice,&quot; even if you don&#39;t mean that any more.<br/>
It&#39;s going to take her a while to gain confidence that you having needs<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean she *has* to give something up.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to gain confidence that her needs are number one in your book.<br/>
(Your own needs are also number one but you won&#39;t find it acceptable to<br/>
sacrifice her needs for yours any more. Your goal is to find a solution that<br/>
works for both of you.)<br/>
<br/>
So rather than setting her up with something to do so you can cross your<br/>
fingers and hope you can snatch alone time, it would help if you&#39;re honest<br/>
with her and tell her what your needs are. For instance: &quot;Daddy and I<br/>
haven&#39;t gotten to watch one of those movies adults like and kids don&#39;t for a<br/>
long time and I&#39;d like to give that to him as a present. How could we do<br/>
that? It&#39;ll take about 2 hours so how could we work that out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then one of the hard parts is actually hearing those suggestions and<br/>
taking them seriously. You might need to think outside the box! If she<br/>
suggests watching at 4AM it might seem easy to laugh and dismiss it, but<br/>
you&#39;ll need to consider whether it might actually work. (But don&#39;t be afraid<br/>
of honestly saying when something won&#39;t work.) The more she&#39;s treated as<br/>
doing the best she can, the better her best will be. :-)<br/>
<br/>
She migtht come up with a great solution and then not be able to follow<br/>
through -- like she might suggest she play a game with your friend&#39;s son for<br/>
2 hours but the game only lasts 10 mintues (so it&#39;s helpful to come up with<br/>
contingency plans with her!) -- but that doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t work. There<br/>
are going to be rocks in the road and you&#39;ll have to accept that her actions<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily reflect her intent. She may want to give you two hours but<br/>
not be able to understand what that really means or how to go about it. So<br/>
you can remind her that she was helping you give Daddy 2 hours to watch a<br/>
movie, so how can she make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As for letting her watch it over and over. This is something I<br/>
&gt; need to think about more. I talked to hubby about it and he said it<br/>
&gt; might de-sencitise her to things and that is not something we want<br/>
&gt; or she needs. But also, it is NOTHING like the matrix, have any of<br/>
&gt; you seen it? It is the grossest movie I have ever seen. I do not<br/>
&gt; think I want it in the house, disturbing!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s *asking* to watch it again, that&#39;s different than making her watch<br/>
it. Perhaps part of her is understanding that it&#39;s not real and another part<br/>
is saying it is real so she understands her need to watch it again is a way<br/>
of showing the &quot;It&#39;s real&quot; part of her that it&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I&#39;ve seen it. And, yes, it&#39;s gross. I *think* it was deliberately<br/>
over-the-top gross as an attempt to be a satire on graphic violence.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d second the suggestion to watch any &quot;making of&quot; extras on the DVD. (Do<br/>
you have access to the local library system or only if you live off base?<br/>
The movie has been out for a while so it might be in one of the nearby<br/>
libraries for free. Another option might be checking on Half.com<br/>
(http://www.half.com) and buying a used one. It&#39;s possible it might be<br/>
cheaper than renting -- and then you can sell it when she&#39;s done if the<br/>
process is something that might take a week or two to work through.)<br/>
<br/>
What about you sleeping with her in her room until she works through this?<br/>
You can reassure your hasband that it won&#39;t be forever and that the more she<br/>
feels you&#39;re there for her through her fears, the less time it will take.<br/>

<br/>
I think the troublesome desensitizing comes when someone is *without choice*<br/>
repeatedly exposed they find disturbing but they need to put up with. None<br/>
of us wants to be desensitized to real suffering, but if our choice seems to<br/>
be to learn to ignore it or to suffer ourselves, we often choose to shut<br/>
that part of us off and become desensitized to suffering.<br/>
<br/>
If Crystal was being exposed to violent movies that she didn&#39;t want to see<br/>
and couldn&#39;t get away from, that&#39;s different than choosing to watch a<br/>
violent movie, or choosing to watch it repeatedly so she can get over<br/>
feeling upset.<br/>
<br/>
I can watch horror movies that aren&#39;t set in modern times. But that hasn&#39;t<br/>
at all desensitized me to real gore. I *don&#39;t* want to see traffic<br/>
accidents. I *don&#39;t* want to see real people&#39;s heads blown up. Same with<br/>
choosing to play violent video games. There&#39;s a clear division between<br/>
what&#39;s acceptable to see pretended and what&#39;s acceptable to allow to happen<br/>
in real life to real people.<br/>

Sorry if it seems like I am fighting advice again. Just explaining <br/>
things. VERY greatful for all the ideas, even ones I do not agree <br/>

************************<br/>
Actually, Kimmy, I&#39;ve been pretty impressed by how you&#39;ve held all of the <br/>
advice you&#39;ve gotten. Sometimes people get really defensive, and you haven&#39;t at <br/>
all. Getting advice here does NOT mean you have to take it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about your daughter and the scary movie, and it made me <br/>
think about Bruno Bettelheim. He wrote a book called &quot;Uses of Enchantment,&quot; <br/>
which mostly discussed how children use fairy tales to work out psychological <br/>
issues in their development. For example, lots of fairy tales have dead moms, and <br/>
kids might use those to process their fears of losing their mothers, or even <br/>
their occasional anger at parents. (I haven&#39;t read the book in a LONG time, so <br/>
this might not be an accurate example.)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if your daughter might be using the movie in the same way. Clearly, <br/>
she is processing SOMETHING. Mostly, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it a whole lot. <br/>
While her fears as a result might be difficult for you to deal with right now, I <br/>
suspect that she got a whole lot more out of that movie than you did. (From <br/>
your description, it sounds like a perfectly horrid movie! ;)  )<br/>
