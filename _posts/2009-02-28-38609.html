<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880467461">I posted this request for help on AlwaysLearning and received some  <br/>
great feedback just before we went on vacation. I&#39;m back from  <br/>
holidays, now, and would like to ask the same question here.  TIA<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
<br/>
I am the raffle/silent auction coordinator  for the Life is Good  <br/>
conference in Vancouver, WA this year and wanted to ask if anyone had  <br/>
some ideas (either from experiences at conferences with their own kids  <br/>
or observing what happens with other families) to help sensitive  <br/>
children deal with the disappointment of &quot;losing&quot; a raffle item or  <br/>
being outbid on a particularly tempting auction basket.<br/>
<br/>
We already have an &quot;Instant Gratification Table&quot; with mostly little  <br/>
kid stuff for a $1 ticket, which helps. But both young and older kids  <br/>
have fallen apart when the results of the raffle and auction are known.<br/>
<br/>
A few of us have discussed the possibility of a less &quot;competitive&quot;  <br/>
fundraising method (and that&#39;s a topic for another time, I think), but  <br/>
we&#39;re not at that stage yet. We just want to be able to help  the  <br/>
sensitive kids and their parents navigate this part of the conference,  <br/>
in that rarified atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning to talk about this on the Life is Good conference list,  <br/>
too, and appreciate any insights or ideas you all might have for me to  <br/>
bring there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Robin B.</div>
