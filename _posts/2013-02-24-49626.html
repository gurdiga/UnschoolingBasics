<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085865521">I like it!<br/>
As a relative newbie, what I&#39;d find additionally helpful, would be a quick (if that&#39;s possible) summary about how radical unschooling extends to sleeping, food, media, etc.  When I looked around at lists to join, it seemed like this one, since it&#39;s called &quot;basics&quot; it was going to just handle reading, math, etc., and that other lists would focus on the radical whole-life approach.  <br/>
<br/>
One other note: in my world, &quot;crunchy&quot; is a nickname for a person who is involved in hippie culture, particularly as concerns making one&#39;s own food.  Granola, raw milk, sprouting grains, etc.  The way crunchy is used in this description sounds to me like it&#39;s for crunchy lifestyles in particular.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289526537">Hmm, I hope you&#39;re kidding :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I jut reread it, and I  like the list description the way it is right now (the original one I mean, not the one in your post.)  <br/>
<br/>
But then again, I don&#39;t think most newcomers pay much attention to the list description... that might be a good way to get their attention, or to tell if they read it at all ;-)  (It might scare some people right off too ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I was thinking about adding something to that effect, but here&#39;s the issue I have, and it&#39;s right there in Regan&#39;s comment - the list description absolutely does mention sleeping, food, media, chores and &quot;parenting issues&quot; and all those things were added to the description specifically because others have complained they didn&#39;t know that&#39;s what the list was about. <br/>
<br/>
I might play around with blending the current description with the new idea - I really want it to read as a kind of warning, albeit a playful one. The current &quot;everything you think you know is about to be challenged&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to convey that strongly enough. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852916823">I could add a clarification note about my own confusion -- why is the list called &quot;Basics&quot;?  To me, that means simple, for beginners, just the essential parts, etc.  What does &quot;Basics&quot; mean when it&#39;s applied to unschooling?  I expect a basics list to be especially good for beginners, since new people would naturally join a place called basics first.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the addition of the new warning is helpful because of terms like analysis, vigorous dissection -- those more accurately reflect the actual activity of the list.<br/>

Wait! This group might not be what you think it is!<br/>
<br/>
This group exists to help new unschoolers who want to change.<br/>
<br/>
Here you will find help in making the choices that support your children in discovering what&#39;s meaningful to them and to growing closer relationships with them. <br/>
<br/>
Here you will find deep examination of ideas that will move you closer to unschooling and ideas that will move you away.<br/>

Some people find what&#39;s offered here exactly what they wanted. Some people find it makes them uncomfortable. <br/>

That&#39;s something I wasn&#39;t sure of - if it would reinforce the stereotype or poke fun at it while also... owning it a bit. I want to own it or parts of it. Because we absolutely do carve up posts into itty bitty bits and chew on them and I&#39;m tired of downplaying that. The dragon bit was a cute conceit, and I wasn&#39;t sure the humor would carry or not. I&#39;m more interested in keeping the word &quot;dissect&quot; in the description, or saying something every bit as strong. &quot;Deep examination&quot; doesn&#39;t get there. And &quot;dissect&quot; or something like it will Still reinforce the same stereotype.<br/>

What else does Yahoo Groups offer to inform people as they join? The monthly reminders are a good idea. Can there be some sort of waiting period before the newbies can post? Or a way to screen posts and refer posters to the list description when they clearly need it? Or is that just more work for the moderators?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s the problem with humor - it can come across in exactly the wrong way. <br/>
<br/>
Probably the list description is fine as it is - it already has everything Regan suggests in it. The only thing I&#39;d add would be a warning of some kind at the top - maybe &quot;this is not a support group!&quot; Something really direct. People still won&#39;t read it, but I&#39;ll feel better.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any opinion at all about a monthly send-out, other than that the yahoo system seems kind of glitchy in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (Kelly maybe, this whole discussion started off list) suggested an FAQ and I&#39;ve been in the mood to write so I cobbled together a draft of one. It&#39;s in the files, but not set to be sent out, just there to be stumbled over. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m just annoyed with the drama on the internet in general. I&#39;m in one of my phases where I want to have a philosophical discussion and can&#39;t find one, and I&#39;m lousy at thread starters so I can&#39;t figure out how to start the kind of discussion I want to have. I&#39;ll think about that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What else does Yahoo Groups offer to inform people as they join?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very little!<br/>
<br/>
List owners can:<br/>
<br/>
* send out automatic emails after someone joins. -- Problem one: Yahoo automatically sends out an email that&#39;s a waste of people&#39;s time. Problem two: We&#39;re inundated with &quot;friendly&quot; emails inviting and welcoming that have no substance.<br/>
<br/>
So I think most people don&#39;t read them. The one on Always Learning even says &quot;Don&#39;t post without reading!&quot; or something like that. It gets ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Problem three: I suspect many may sign up with an email address they don&#39;t use because they intend to read at the website, so emails are useless for reaching them.<br/>
<br/>
* send out periodic (monthly, weekly) emails to the list. --Problem one:  If you join right after an email goes out, it can be 30 days before the next one. Most people butt heads with the group in the first few days of joining.<br/>
<br/>
Problem two: The emails get annoying to the people who&#39;ve been on the list for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
* require approval for everyone joining. -- With that everyone gets an email they must respond to. Question they need to answer can be added. Problem one: If someone signs up with an email they don&#39;t use, they won&#39;t see the email.<br/>
<br/>
Problem two: lots of people don&#39;t like them. It feels like you&#39;re being scrutinized. I personally like joining lists quietly so I can see if I like them. I don&#39;t like feeling I&#39;m being vetted first! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
The ways to use and get onto lists has expanded a great deal since Yahoo first began offering them. What it really needs is some kind of interactive join feature so a message can be put before the eyes of everyone before they join. But that&#39;s not (yet) possible. And, of course, there would *still* be people who wouldn&#39;t read. BUT, at least it&#39;s something to point at when someone gets flustered. Then you can ask &quot;Well, did you read the guidelines that you said you did when you joined?&quot; ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009612185">If you do go with the dragon humor, I&#39;d suggest that maybe it&#39;s the ideas that are crunchy and go well with ketchup, not the people :-) <br/>
<br/>
Ideas and philosophies and thoughts are fun and interesting to ponder and consider and dissect.  And this list (and Always Learning, and maybe others I&#39;m not thinking of) are great places to do that because experienced idea-havers are here and are willing to talk :-)<br/>
<br/>
The process of bringing an idea and having it crunched up, dipped in ketchup, and devoured scares some people - I think in part because they get confused and blur the line between themselves and their ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
And then a dragon :-) says &quot;that idea doesn&#39;t sound quite right, in a unschooling light, and this is why...&quot; or &quot;that idea doesn&#39;t sound quite in keeping with how children *really* learn, and this is why...&quot; and the idea-bringer hears instead &quot;YOU ARE WRONG AND STUPID AND HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING AROUND DRAGONS&quot; even though that&#39;s not remotely what was actually said :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I am my ideas, then it&#39;s easy to get insulted and upset when people criticize or question or dissect or dismiss my ideas.  If I am simply Me - a person with ideas, ideas that I allow to change and grow and evolve over time - then it&#39;s easier to stand objectively to the side while my ideas get batted around and sometimes devoured.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something to say somehow to people new to the list would be along the lines of (not these words necessarily, but this idea :-))<br/>
It&#39;s not about you - it&#39;s about the ideas and words and concepts you bring to the dragon-table, but it&#39;s not about you.  Really.  You are not your ideas.  Dragons are friendly to people, but they love to crunch on ideas :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not - or maybe it&#39;s been tried, or maybe what I&#39;m thinking doesn&#39;t make sense.  But trying really, really hard not to take things personally seems key in any good and productive discussion :-)<br/>

<br/>
It does Some newcomers to the list, but for others the &quot;basics&quot; include the philosophical underpinnings of unschooling. In a way, it&#39;s a difference in learning styles - some people want to start with nuts and bolts, some with theory, and some with the intersection of theory and practicality. This list focuses on the intersection.<br/>
<br/>
To me the &quot;basics&quot; part of the name is really important from that standpoint - I&#39;d rather people were annoyed at the list than feel like they can&#39;t &quot;jump in at the deep end&quot; as it were and get into the... well, the basics of what unschooling is all about. <br/>

<br/>
basic: &quot;forming an essential foundation or starting point; fundamental&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The list doesn&#39;t offer a specific starting point. We do offer a place where beginners (and others) can ask questions. The two aren&#39;t the same because the answers won&#39;t be basic! <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it could be called Answers to Radical Unschooling Questions.<br/>
<br/>
A bit long but perhaps more descriptive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a list that discusses the easier parts and consepts of unschooling<br/>
&gt; and a list that helps beginning unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a list where beginners can begin. It isn&#39;t, though, a list for people who want to do a little bit of unschooling while being supported in whatever they&#39;re comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because there *isn&#39;t* a little bit of unschooling. People can use one, two, a handful of unschooling ideas. But thats not unschooling. It&#39;s using a handful of unschooling ideas! It&#39;s using them all together as a package that makes it unschooling. Just as eating more vegetables isn&#39;t vegetarianism. Though someone who wants to eat more vegetables could certainly draw on the ideas in a vegetarian forum.<br/>
<br/>
Though your expectations are a really good jumping off point to discuss thoughts on learning something new!<br/>
<br/>
If someone picks up an introductory book, goes to an introductory class, that person expects it will start with the simplest, basic ideas and build from there.<br/>
<br/>
That approach makes it easy to pour in a chunk of knowledge. (The down side is that since they aren&#39;t building their own understanding, they may have memorized rather than understood. Which means the knowledge will fade.)<br/>
<br/>
But humans don&#39;t naturally learn like that. Usually we aren&#39;t asking questions that can be pulled out of context and answered simply. If someone says &quot;I&#39;m worried my 8 yo isn&#39;t reading yet,&quot; it&#39;s a beginner question, but there isn&#39;t a &quot;beginner&quot; answer to it. The answer delves in pretty deeply to how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
Every time these beginner questions are answered, someone&#39;s understanding of the big picture grows, not just of that one thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
And part of the problem is that the &quot;simplest, basic ideas&quot; change from person to person. If you go to a basic yoga class, you might get a lot of breathing, or sun-salutes, either of which would be considered too advanced by another teacher, one who prefers to start everyone out with standing poses. And someone else will start with theory. <br/>
<br/>
What are the basics of unschooling? I think probably the biggest confusion about radical unschooling discussions (other than the obvious) is we rarely state those in any kind of straightforward manner. We let people derive them, come to their own conclusions. That&#39;s not an unalloyed good thing, though, because the people who have posted here for a long time (like me) have some definite opinions about what&#39;s at the core of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
People learn. People learn differently. Children are people. <br/>
<br/>
Those are the unschooling basics, right there. Everything else - everything we discuss on this list - derives directly from those. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should just add that as a tag line to all my posts... I certainly post enough.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a magazine doesn&#39;t publish every article and letter sent to them, are they censoring? With a magazine there&#39;s the *expectation* that you *won&#39;t* get every opinion out there. That you *will* get what the editors believe is worthwhile. And if you want a different take on the subject you know there&#39;s hundreds of other sources where you can easily find them.<br/>
<br/>
The list isn&#39;t a magazine. There are important differences, but there is the aspect of keeping the ideas focused on what supports human relationships and learning. There&#39;s the aspect of *using* that focus to filter out the ideas the &quot;editors&quot; believe won&#39;t. Not everyone will filter with the same criteria the long time posters use. BUT NO ONE IS LIMITED TO THIS FORUM BY SIGNING ON. If you want more ideas, they&#39;re out there!<br/>
<br/>
The problem lies in people assuming this is a social group where *everyone* trades ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The problem lies in not being able to explain what the list is instead of a social group before people jump in and get hurt. But it&#39;s not for lack of trying!<br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn what something is isn&#39;t to depend on someone else to tell you what it is. It&#39;s to try it out! See if you like it. If you don&#39;t, find something else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the foundation of unschooling! It&#39;s how humans learn. It&#39;s how kids learn and what parents should be supporting.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big problems with trying to explain this list is that most people didn&#39;t know this is what they wanted until they try it. There&#39;s nothing people are familiar with that will help them get what this list is before they try it. It&#39;s not a class. It&#39;s not a magazine. But it shares more with them than it does a support group.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; warn prospective new members about your censorship <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The above is a *profound* misuse of the word censorship. It&#39;s dismissive of the people in this world who truly are censored, who can&#39;t get their words out so others can hear or read them.<br/>
<br/>
No where in the world can anyone say anything they want anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
In the US everyone is free to create their own forum and put their words out for others to read. Yahoo. Facebook. Blogger. Twitter. Tumblr. You can print pamphlets and hand them out. And loads of others.<br/>
<br/>
If you have ideas you believe are important for people to know that don&#39;t get through to the list, make your own forum. Invite people to read it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not true in many countries. If someone&#39;s words can&#39;t appear in one place they *can&#39;t* go somewhere else. They are censored by the government.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re calling censorship is filtering. Filtering helps keep information focused. It&#39;s a *service* to people. As with a magazine, you find someone whose voice you like. If you don&#39;t like their voice, you find someone else. If you don&#39;t like any filtering, there&#39;s the whole wide world open to you.<br/>

The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106876508">The tennis ball idea is also what allowed me to really &quot;get&quot; it too. I<br/>
think it&#39;s worth being a part of the description. And FWIW, I love the<br/>

-----------It&#39;s just an idea...I&#39;m sure my choice of words may not be the best! I assume it will be pulled apart, but now that I am familiar with how this site works, it&#39;s all good =)<br/>

<br/>
Learning is a central human endeavor.<br/>
Learning is inextricably dependent on the perceptions and perspectives<br/>
of the individual.<br/>
Children are motivated by the same human needs, emotions, and responses as adults, including those related to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhh. I feel better now. <br/>
