<div id="ygrps-yiv-496965027">I am still new to the yahoo group thing, so I am posting this on <br/>
several sites, sorry for the inbox filler if you belong to all of <br/>
them like I do! I had a website maintained for a log time and it <br/>
crashed, but the group thing is fairly new and I&#39;m not sure of the <br/>
multi group netiquette.<br/>
<br/>
I would like share something that might be interesting or maybe <br/>
helpful to some of you.<br/>
<br/>
I was pulled from public school when I was 12, my parents unschooled <br/>
me my whole life, but didn&#39;t &quot;pull me&quot; until we moved.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading some of your post on punishments and thought it <br/>
might be interesting to know that my parent never spanked me, <br/>
grounded me, or anything else that might be considered punishment. <br/>
If it matters,I am one of 11 children. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was taught through example and discussion to talk to my <br/>
brothers when I was mad at them. My parents would help me define my <br/>
emotions, using terms like, &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel&quot; at the right time. <br/>
Instead of saying &quot;I feel like he&#39;s being mean.&quot; I would be asked <br/>
if &quot;I felt mad and thought he was being mean&quot; was more what I was <br/>
trying to say. They were real big on helping me find the real issue. <br/>
It was fine if I wanted to smack my brother in the head, but I <br/>
learned to tell him instead of do it most times. <br/>
<br/>
The funny part is, that when all else failed, and because of <br/>
violence or failed discussion, my parents were brought in, we <br/>
thought that was punishment! We all agreed on one thing, that it was <br/>
easier to work it out somehow, even if it meant a difficult <br/>
compromise. Not because my parent would be angry or anything, it was <br/>
just that they had us work it out with so much talking and listening <br/>
to each other. We were even taught the old, &quot;hit the pillow instead <br/>
of the person&quot;. I still use that when I release the urge for <br/>
physical anger.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I think that is good or bad, I still use all of it <br/>
in my own way with my children. But I didn&#39;t know I was an <br/>
unschooler until my oldest was in 2nd grade, I just thought I was a <br/>
bad homeschooler! :)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113867744">I just hate the idea that my kids might consider me punishment, or at least <br/>
that style of parenting punishment. But when I look back at it, I loved to <br/>
be around my parents any other time. I do have to admit that they were <br/>
talkers, as am I. So I have to actively work at listening to my children and <br/>
silently watching them. My parents wanted to teach my SO much about the <br/>
world and how to make a difference that it was sometimes like a lecture <br/>
because they get so passionate about things. Now as adult I understand!<br/>

&gt;That is a great story.  Your parents set such a wonderful example.  And it <br/>
&gt;sounds like you are doing a wonderful job with your own children.  Now if I <br/>
