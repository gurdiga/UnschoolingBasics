 </span></blockquote>As to question two - what do you need to make you unsnappy? Do you <br/>
need more food, more sleep, more help around the house, a good cry, a <br/>
nice comfy bath, a romantic dinner - cooked and cleaned up by someone <br/>
else, 3 uninterrupted hours at the library, air conditioning, other? <br/>
If you can pinpoint an item or two that would feed your own self, try <br/>
to arrange for them on a regular basis. You might even get a sitter to <br/>
come over and play with your toddler while you take a nap. Also, after <br/>
the fact, don&#39;t spend the time feeling guilty, apologize and move on. <br/>
There&#39;s nothing that says a mommy can&#39;t apologize to a toddler. &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry I was grumpy at you sweetie&quot; and you&#39;ll likely get a sloppy kiss <br/>
and a hug and life goes on. <br/>
<br/>
When DS was 2 or 3, we still had &#39;bedtime&#39; - a generally flexible time <br/>
somewhere around 9 pm which was when he usually was acting tired. We&#39;d <br/>
start slowly moving toward bed - brush teeth, play a little, PJs (if <br/>
he wanted them - he&#39;s a nakey boy mostly and slept in just his diaper <br/>
much of the time), stories and snuggling then sleep. Sometimes he was <br/>
asleep early, other times he wanted to be up a little later and we&#39;d <br/>
put a quiet video on and all snuggle on the couch. Sometimes a little <br/>
bath time would help unwind him. In general, there was a &#39;bedtime&#39; but <br/>
a loose one based on his signs of tiredness - we&#39;d adjust it earlier <br/>
or later on his signals and by the time he was 5 we just dropped it <br/>
altogether. And yes when we finally dropped it (not a big announcement <br/>
just saying OK when he wanted to stay up to watch one more episode of <br/>
whatever) he did stay up later than usual - for maybe 3 or 4 days. <br/>
Then he decided that snuggling with mom before mom was mostly asleep <br/>
was more to his liking than staying up to watch something he knew he <br/>
could watch some other time (since his favorite shows repeat often). I <br/>
still let him know when I head up to bed (I WOH DH is the at home <br/>
parent, so I need to be in bed before they do) that I&#39;ll be up for a <br/>
while reading/watching TV/unwinding or that I&#39;ll be falling asleep <br/>
soon. If I&#39;m up for a while and he (and/or DH) are not heading to bed, <br/>
I&#39;ll let him/them know that now I&#39;m going to sleep, last chance to <br/>
snuggle before I fall asleep so they can decide. Sometimes they come <br/>
snuggle. Other times they are in the middle of a video game or <br/>
something and I&#39;m asleep by the time they come up to bed.<br/>

too--luckily dh is a guy who can live on a lot less<br/>
sleep than I can, so if I crash in the evening he can<br/>
man the fort just fine without me...<br/>
<br/>
As far as toddler bedtime--We family bed and I would<br/>
get into bed when I was tired and they would follow<br/>
me...or if they were tired earlier they would ask me<br/>
to come and nurse them to sleep.  They never wanted to<br/>
stay up without me.  Now that they&#39;re 7 and 13, they<br/>
often stay up much later than I can, but still the 7<br/>
yo watches tv in the family bed (quietly, thank you<br/>
son!) until he falls asleep (which is often 2+ hours<br/>
after I&#39;ve fallen asleep).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937963233">I hadn&#39;t heard of unschooling when my kids were that little but I still<br/>
listened to each child and did what worked for that child.  Not having a<br/>
bedtime doesn&#39;t mean not listening to their cues of tiredness and helping<br/>
them to fall asleep in a way that is comfortable for them.<br/>
<br/>
My older child thrived on things being consistent and she still does at age<br/>
10.  She likes to know what&#39;s going on and when we are doing what.  She<br/>
wakes up at the same time every day, no matter what time she goes to bed at<br/>
night.  (It&#39;s actually gotten a bit better as she&#39;s gotten older, but I used<br/>
to be able to set a clock by her.)  <br/>
My younger dd, age 8, enjoys flying by the seat of her pants, just like me.<br/>
Bedtime for her isn&#39;t an issue because no matter when she goes to bed, she<br/>
will sleep 9 or 10 hours and then wake up refreshed.  <br/>
<br/>
Both my girls have always enjoyed having me lay with them while they fall<br/>
asleep and it&#39;s been a ritual that I&#39;ve enjoyed too, which has always made<br/>
bedtime a nice time for us.  <br/>
<br/>
When I am tired and grumpy I lie on the couch and shut my eyes for 20<br/>
minutes or so.  My kids were always right there under foot when they were<br/>
little so I didn&#39;t feel like anything catastrophic would happen that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be aware of, but then again, my girls were pretty easy toddlers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788786174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Both my girls have always enjoyed having me lay with them while <br/>

has always made bedtime a nice time for us.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This will be our first year unschooling (dd just finished 6th <br/>
grade).  We are ALL night owls and she always has a hard <br/>
time &quot;turning off her brain&quot; or ending the day.  I realize now this <br/>
is no longer an issue, but when she had to get up in the morning to <br/>
get the bus at 7:15 AM and she had been up until midnight the night <br/>
before, it was.<br/>
<br/>
I quit my job in June and this is the first time I&#39;ve NEVER worked or <br/>
had to get up!  I&#39;m having a harder time adjusting to it than she is, <br/>
but I&#39;m getting there.  She won&#39;t stay up if we&#39;re going to bed, so I <br/>
announce to her (about 1/2 hour before I think I&#39;ll REALLY be ready <br/>
to go to sleep) that I&#39;m tired and going to bed soon.  Then I mention <br/>
it a couple more times (she&#39;s really into an on-line computer game, <br/>
so she needs time to finish up and log off).  Usually by the 3rd <br/>
time, she&#39;s really good about stopping.  I&#39;m not trying to make her <br/>
stop, but it&#39;s because we HAVE to do our bedtime ritual.  She needs <br/>
it and can&#39;t end the day without it.<br/>
<br/>
After brushing teeth etc, we get her bed settled, she&#39;ll talk for a <br/>
while about something that she did on her game that day etc (I have <br/>
to allow for that too, especially if I&#39;m REALLY tired and ready to <br/>
sleep), then we do our &quot;goodnights&quot; (I don&#39;t know when this started, <br/>
but we&#39;ve been doing it for several years now and she expects it).  <br/>
I&#39;ll say first &quot;good night&quot; (she says the same thing), then &quot;I love <br/>
you&quot; (she says I love you too). Then SHE starts it again, I start it <br/>
again and it ends with her starting it last.  Hugs, kisses, <br/>
additional &quot;I love yous&quot; and then she&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
Plus she&#39;s REALLY enjoying being able to sleep in and get up when <br/>
she&#39;s done sleeping!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is one of my favorite things - DS can sleep however much he needs <br/>
to sleep, whether it&#39;s 8 hrs or 10 hrs. And he can fall asleep <br/>
whenever in the afternoon if he&#39;s needing a bit extra (usually growth <br/>
spurts and colds and sometimes seasonal/daylight savings shifts will <br/>
do this). Sometimes it gets a little bittersweet when I know DS is <br/>
curled up cozily in bed and I drive to work (I&#39;m at work by 8 am) and <br/>
see kids his size standing out waiting for their school bus.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293791637">I&#39;m no expert, but this used to confuse me too. I<br/>
thought people meant that they let their two year old<br/>
just do whatever til all hours, and eventually they<br/>
would fall asleep in the middle of the floor in<br/>
exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are two and four. What &quot;no bedtimes&quot; means to<br/>
me is that 1) We don&#39;t have to rush to get to bed at a<br/>
particular time if we don&#39;t want to. Like, we don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about the concept of &quot;school nights.&quot;<br/>
(And yes, everyone I know with a four year old does,<br/>
at least to some extent.) <br/>
<br/>
And 2) that &quot;bedtime&quot; is pleasant. We snuggle up, read<br/>
books together, talk, etc. It&#39;s not something we<br/>
struggle or fight about. I can&#39;t imagine my girls<br/>
thinking, &quot;Oh no, not bedtime!&quot; as if it were a bad<br/>
thing.<br/>

<br/>
Dylan and I had a nice bedtime thing like this too, just silly stuff that<br/>
we did for years.  He slept in our bed exclusively until he got his own<br/>
bed when he was seven.  He still slept with us frequently until he was<br/>
eleven but now sleeps in his own bed.   He&#39;s thirteen.  Sometimes he&#39;ll<br/>
wiggle in beside me for awhile but not the whole night.  <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan got to the place he wanted to stay up later than us I told him<br/>
he could wake me and we&#39;d still do the tucking in bedtime stuff.   That<br/>
might be an option for you at some point.  If you&#39;re not too groggy. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

That&#39;s definitely a possibility.  I&#39;m finding that now that there are <br/>
no limits on what she does during the day (unlike just a couple of <br/>
months ago when she was still in school and had to get up at a certain <br/>
time), she doesn&#39;t mind when I &quot;end the day&quot; (and giving her plenty of <br/>
preparation time).  She seems to like it, she&#39;s said it&#39;s so hard to <br/>
stop the game and doesn&#39;t mind that I give her a reason to (I&#39;m ready, <br/>
and SHE needs her ritual).  In fact, just last night she was saying how <br/>
weird it was at first (since her last day of school in June) that she&#39;s <br/>
been able to do whatever she wants all day (which right now is World of <br/>
Warcraft), and she was wondering (not ASKING me, just wondering outloud <br/>
to herself), when she&#39;ll want to do something different for a change.  <br/>
I only said &quot;you&#39;ll know&quot;.  I&#39;m pleasantly surprised at how far she&#39;s <br/>
come since we quit school.  She&#39;s relaxing (and I am too, in fact a few <br/>
times she&#39;s said it &quot;creeps her out&quot; that I&#39;m so easy going) and I <br/>
reminded her that this is unschooling, just living life.   I think <br/>
she&#39;s liking it &lt;g&gt;<br/>

   I have two questions I guess. one is I know alot of unschoolers<br/>
don&#39;t have &quot;bedtime&quot; What about for 2 or 3 year old? And What do alot<br/>
of you do when your feeling really tired and grumpy. I am having<br/>
another baby and find myself feeling that way alot!! I don&#39;t want to<br/>
be snappy but I find that I am doing that alot and then later I feel<br/>
really guilty.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Danette,<br/>
<br/>
First: apologize when you&#39;re grumpy. Children appreciate that!  Also, <br/>
if you can warn them that you are tired and may snap at them, they can <br/>
learn to do the same. Still apologize when you do snap! But I found <br/>
that, if I&#39;m getting touchy and creepy, if I tell the boys that I&#39;m <br/>
grouchy, they will be a little kinder and gentler with *me*! I do the <br/>
same for them. If we can learn to recognize when our tempers are <br/>
getting short, we can better learn to deal with it and ask other for <br/>
help too!<br/>
<br/>
As for no bedtimes: that does not mean that you can&#39;t make the <br/>
surroundings conducive to sleep! Lights low, warm drink, soft music, <br/>
sweet book or songs, warm cuddle....I&#39;m getting sleepy already! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On a humorous &quot;wake me&quot; note: DS will sometimes want to stay up and <br/>
I go to sleep. Other times, I tuck him in his bed and later in the <br/>
night/wee hours he&#39;ll climb back into our bed. He usually taps me on <br/>
the arm or shoulder or side to let me know to let him in. I just <br/>
half-wake, open the blankets and shift over to give him space. So, <br/>
one night, I was really really asleep, it was maybe 3 am or <br/>
something. I felt a tap on my hand, so, without opening my eyes, I <br/>
slid over, lifted open the blanket and said &quot;c&#39;mon in&quot;. But then I <br/>
noticed two things <br/>
(1) I didn&#39;t feel the added body weight and warmth, that accompanies <br/>
DS <br/>
(2) I did feel something kind of tickly on my hand<br/>
So, I opened my eyes and there stood our Lab, tail wagging, looking <br/>
for a little attention (his whiskers were tickling me). I patted his <br/>
head and told him to go back to sleep and he did. Glad he&#39;s <br/>
*finally* learned not to jump on the bed or he&#39;d probably have taken <br/>
me up on the invitation when I said &quot;c&#39;mon in&quot;. I had to LOL at <br/>
myself when I saw him there.<br/>

 Hi, Stacy!<br/>
<br/>
  I saved your last e-mail to respond to later. But your question is <br/>
rather involved, and I didn&#39;t want to just post something quickly.<br/>
<br/>
  Rather than give a long, drawn-out explanation, I will give you a <br/>
*very* short overview and send you to a couple of other sites where you <br/>
can read and read and read.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is a form of homeschooling.The word was coined by John <br/>
Holt, an educator and school reformer on the 60&#39;s & 70s. He eventually <br/>
realized that school are inherently bad and were unreformable and <br/>
advised parents to simply take their children out of school and let hem <br/>
lead rich, exciting lives where their passions are honored. He <br/>
suggested that children were capable of *real* work for *real* <br/>
purposes---that they could do *real* things and learn from that. He <br/>
really didn&#39;t believe in &quot;busy&quot; work! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  He said that children are hard-wired to learn, that they are learning <br/>
MACHINES! That school can and does inhibit the drive to learn through <br/>
coercion.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is about learning through passions. Through total <br/>
immersion. Through joy.<br/>
<br/>
  The listowners and moderators here are all radical unschoolers who <br/>
also believe that children can learn *everything* this way---including <br/>
eating, sleeping, cleaning, etc. We live joyful lives full of <br/>
interesting and interested people. We fill our lives and those of our <br/>
children with new ideas and things.<br/>
<br/>
  We see everything as equally educational---video games and pools and <br/>
bird feeders and algebra and skateboards and guitars and WWII and <br/>
terrariums and cycling and gardening and Yu-Gi-Oh! and sewing and Jimmy <br/>
Neutron and chemical equations---all equal in &quot;educational&quot; value. We <br/>
don&#39;t divide the world into educational and non-educational. We don&#39;t <br/>
divide the world into subjects: math is art is science is history is <br/>
music is physics---they&#39;re all connected and inter-connected. <br/>
Everything is connected!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you can imagine what the world and the lives of kids would be like if<br/>
there was no school; And if you can imagine it as a positive thing, then<br/>
some of the explanations of unschooling might make sense to you.  <br/>
Otherwise, I&#39;m afraid, unschoolers sound pretty nutty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For my son, (14) unschooling has been living life.   Pretty simple.  He<br/>
never went to school.  He never studied academic materials.   He never<br/>
memorized spelling lists or multiplication tables.   He never had reading<br/>
lessons.   He never took a quiz or test and never got a grade.   He has<br/>
been living his life.    And it turns out that humans learn all the time,<br/>
so that in daily living one is naturally picking up the bits and pieces<br/>
of information that all come together and become knowledge we use<br/>
everyday.   So, without lessons and schedules and workbooks and textbooks<br/>
and teachers and tests, humans learn what they need to know.   They learn<br/>
by playing, by going about life, by exploring interests.   <br/>
<br/>
It would be easier to answer specific questions, if you could throw some<br/>
out there.   <br/>

Close your eyes for a moment and feel a hug.<br/>
<br/>
You are tired. Focus on good nutrition and treating your thyroid. <br/>
Help the kids to know that mom figured out she has been sick and <br/>
grumpy, and she wants to get well and happy. Tell them you need their <br/>
help. Tell them you love them, and aim for a hug every hour with each <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Make preparing meals a fun time for all but the youngest to help get <br/>
the meal together. Nutritious meals don&#39;t have to be cooked. <br/>
Sandwiches, cereal, fruits and many vegetables can all be served with <br/>
minimum preparation time.<br/>
<br/>
Your oldest isn&#39;t reading. When you have the energy, go to the <br/>
library. Get the Dr. Seuss books. Let the kids pick out books that <br/>
look interesting. Read to them every day, even if just for five <br/>
minutes. Let there always be books around for them to look at. <br/>
They&#39;ll learn how to read the words in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve forgotten how to have fun playing with them. Aim for five <br/>
minutes each day for one-on-one time with each child. Do something <br/>
that child wants to do with just you.<br/>
<br/>
If you have faith, share it. I wish you the best.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Natalie,<br/>
I am sure you will get lots of answers to this one.  I am assuming here <br/>
that by &quot;work&quot; you mean what would look like &quot;school work&quot;.  It really <br/>
has nothing to do with how much work is or is not being produced but <br/>
rather why the child is doing it.  There are unschoolers who do use <br/>
text books or classes.  But it is the why that is important.  Is it <br/>
because the child is doing the &quot;work&quot; to get him closer to his goal?  <br/>
Because he feels it is important for him at this moment in time?  It is <br/>
the best way out of many alternatives for him to get the informatino he <br/>
needs?  <br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226512052">&quot;What is the dividing line between homeschooling and unschooling? Is<br/>
it the type of work, the amount of work, or whether their is work at<br/>
all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has absolutely NOTHING to do with what work anyone is doing and<br/>
EVERYTHING to do with the motivation behind the action.<br/>
Unschooling is all about the learner choosing exactly what they want<br/>
to learn, when they want to learn it and for their own reasons. That&#39;s<br/>
why you can&#39;t say &quot;workbooks aren&#39;t unschooling&quot; because sometimes<br/>
they ARE.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage families new to this journey, to get away from anything<br/>
schoolish because all of that can be a stumbling block. But with my<br/>
unschooled from birth daughter, she has no hang ups about what<br/>
learning is or isn&#39;t and she chooses schoolish looking activities<br/>
sometimes. I don&#39;t worry that she&#39;s valuing it above other kinds of<br/>
learning though.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an attitude, a lifestyle, a belief that only the<br/>
learner has the power to gain information and only they can know what<br/>
is important for their own life journey. There is no way to pick out<br/>
activities and label them as unschooling or not. It&#39;s a philosophy,<br/>
not a set of actions.<br/>
