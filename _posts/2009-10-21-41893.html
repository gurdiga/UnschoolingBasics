<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651614806">Hi all,<br/>
I am Stephanie and I have 4 children, Ashton 18,Cody 7, Abby 4, and Avery 1 yr.<br/>
My oldest was a combo of public and homeschool and I am currently unschooling the younger ones. I have been struggling to &quot;de school&quot; my mind and trust the process. My 7 yr old has Aspergers and sensory issues and I know that the unschool way works best for him. Most days I feel ok in my decisions, but I often wonder- does he know what he should? Is he behind his age group? Am I providing enough? Is he getting it? etc...etc... <br/>
I know those are mostly &quot;school&quot; questions and I ask myself who is to say what you &quot;should&quot; know at what age and just why are you comparing your kids to anyone? But the doubt keeps coming.. <br/>
I belong to some homeschool groups but they are like others have posted before (just doing school, but at home)  I really believe in more organic learning, so its hard to fit in at times. <br/>
I am happy that I found this group and hope to get to know some of you better. <br/>
If anyone is in Oklahoma please let me know. We are just NW of OKC.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; does he know what he should?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s not part of his world, does he need it for his right now  <br/>
self? A better question to ask is what does your unique 7 yo need to  <br/>
know to be best at being his 7 yo self?<br/>
<br/>
The most powerful knowledge he can possess is knowing that he can  <br/>
learn whatever he puts his mind to. People are born assuming that!  <br/>
Society&#39;s messages about needing experts to learn something make  <br/>
people doubt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is he behind his age group?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they know things that he doesn&#39;t, what are they using that  <br/>
knowledge for?<br/>
<br/>
What does your son know *instead* of that knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
Educators *say* it takes 12 years to learn all this stuff. Some even  <br/>
say that once they fall behind they never catch up. But that&#39;s  <br/>
because educators are using methods that run counter to how humans  <br/>
naturally learn. If all you&#39;d ever known was leaky buckets with  <br/>
sieves to fill them, wouldn&#39;t you think filling buckets was hard?  <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you believe -- actually know from personal experience --  <br/>
that if you took a break from filling that it would be hard to catch up?<br/>
<br/>
Educators know nothing about how kids naturally learn. But they don&#39;t  <br/>
even realize it!  How could they? No one who believes in the school  <br/>
system would allow their child to be in the control group where  <br/>
they&#39;re given no instruction!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645339975">Hi Stephanie!!<br/>
 <br/>
I am Jana, and we do NOT currently live in any state but we travel full-time, and so we live in a bunch of states at different times.  My mother lives in NW OKC too and we are there fairly often.  She&#39;s off NW Expwy, which I think should be Piedmont but is actually Yukon?!  LOL   Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I also have 4 kids boys from 19 down to 12 but only 2 are home (traveling) with me now.  Would love to &quot;hook-up&quot; when in the area!<br/>
 <br/>
PEACE!!     Jana<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951212389">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I think that I have seen posts from you on other lists :0) I was actually on the FYI list last year and attended a meet up at Martin Park. I got kicked off the list for not participating enough. I was pregnant and it was hard for me to make it to most of the stuff because it was across town. I also have long periods that I am not on the computer so I received the &quot;good bye&quot; letter from the group. <br/>
We can be very active at times, but with my guy, we have to just take it day by day. Sometimes we need periods that we don&#39;t do much. <br/>
Thats one reason I love the &quot;unschooling&quot; concept! <br/>
