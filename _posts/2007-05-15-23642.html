The piece of the puzzle that you&#39;re missing is that unschooling <br/>
parents should be *with* their kids, being aware of what they&#39;re <br/>
seeing, open to discussing whatever comes up.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t necessarily need to sit next to them, but we can be in the <br/>
same room with them so we know what&#39;s going on in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s totally different than conventional parents sending their kids <br/>
off to do whatever they want so the parents can do family maintenance <br/>
without the kids bothering them.<br/>
