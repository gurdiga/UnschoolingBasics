<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563389358">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just didn&#39;t know what else to title this: &quot;She is driving me crazy&quot;? &quot;I am<br/>
loosing my mind&quot;? &quot;my beautiful daughter has become a misery&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What ever I thought it was all so negative, and maybe that is all I need is<br/>
a good solid kicking of an attitude adjustment, that is administered gently<br/>
given my 8 months pregnancy situation?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, I just know I am so sad at the way things are these days.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant child<br/>
for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at me.<br/>
mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of energy<br/>
in the last month?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>
screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>
&quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>
screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she has<br/>
ever had. I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how they<br/>
are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong thing<br/>
(no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction to<br/>
the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>
her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>
all something I have to do for her, and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>
know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>
rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>
to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>
anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>
now&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for hours,<br/>
if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear each<br/>
other, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a show,<br/>
after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts talking<br/>
and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as possible.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
OK. so it is becoming obvious to me as I read this that some of this<br/>
behaviour is a reaction to my seeming to have less time and energy for her.<br/>
Yes I have less time and energy for her so where do I find it for her so she<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel so ignored? I spend all day with her, I give her all I can. by<br/>
the end of the day I am drained by her constant chatter and demands and<br/>
tantrums. Hmmmm. she is constantly pulling me closer to her and wanting to<br/>
control and dominate me and then when I get with her, she pushes me away.<br/>
Ok. so what approach do I take, what can I do to fill her up with what she<br/>
needs? What does she need? How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t really an unschooling issue, but I really appreciate any<br/>
insight you wonderful women can shed, I respect your opinions and life<br/>
experiences so much, thank you in advance for your help,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-660884537">Dear Sheri-Lee<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful post. Really, really. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m looking at this from the Law of Attraction perspective. Hannah is<br/>
matching with her behaviour something that you are not aware of and<br/>
acknowledging within yourself, most probably. At 8 months preggies you may<br/>
want to spend some time with yourself and with the little one to come. You<br/>
may want someone else to &#39;do&#39; things for you. You may feel very much out of<br/>
sorts with yourself and this body that is not as you might define beautiful<br/>
and lovable. And nothing fits! There may also be some thoughts of<br/>
apprehension. Quite a lot may not be the way you want it to be.<br/>
And all of this is not appropriate because you want to be a good mother and<br/>
do all the other stuff which is &#39;right&#39; and according to the books.<br/>
<br/>
Could you give yourself a break? Could you stop to beat up on yourself for a<br/>
moment? Could you acknowledge that you are doing great and the best you can<br/>
under the circumstances. Can you allow yourself a breather, knowing that the<br/>
most important person at this moment should be you (and baby) and that you<br/>
get your needs met first. If your little one does not know what she wants,<br/>
do you know what you want? I don&#39;t say that you should follow her lead and<br/>
throw a temper tantrum, but you may allow yourself the knowing that you are<br/>
worthy of being loved.<br/>
<br/>
You feel disempowered because you see that even if you stood on your head<br/>
she would not be satisfied. This just shows us that is is never about the<br/>
things we do for others that make them happy. btw, it also not the things<br/>
others do that make us happy or unhappy. Not really! :) It is how we<br/>
interpret what happens that results in our feeling good or bad. And we can<br/>
re-interpret everything to mean something better about ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Take the moment where she wants you to mind read her preferences and rejects<br/>
all your suggestions. I could interpret that as &#39;If she does not know what<br/>
she wants I&#39;ve failed (again).&#39; or &#39;If she does not know what she wants I am<br/>
responsible.&#39; or &#39;If she does not know what she wants it&#39;s nothing to do<br/>
with me.&#39; or &#39;I would love to know what I want and go for it.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
You know that Hannah shows all the symptoms of &#39;OMG I have to share mommy&#39;s<br/>
love.&#39; And that is something we can&#39;t live with. We want ALL the love to<br/>
flow to us at all times. This cannot be rationalised ever. The only way to<br/>
soothe this pain is to love, unconditionally. First yourself and then<br/>
Hannah.  And you can do that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116045841">&lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>

screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she has<br/>
ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>
one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell Institute<br/>
(and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>
be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>
would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>
but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your very<br/>
pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>
the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how they<br/>
are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong thing<br/>
(no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>
between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>
request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does take<br/>
the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>
spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>
me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>
you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>
go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>
get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction<br/>
to<br/>
the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>
her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>
all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>
to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>
can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>
and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>
service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>
Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>
know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>
rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>
to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>
anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>
now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>
solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>
for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>
you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>
after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
(without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>
behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>
like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>
just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>
playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>
&quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>
she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>
negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>
eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>
particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>
resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>
for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>
of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>
attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
&quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>
the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>
behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>
moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
months ago. <br/>
<br/>
This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>

I just want to send you a (((hug)))), bless your heart.  I agree w what Ulrike said, that Hannah is probably reflecting some of your misery.  These little folks are so in tune with their Mamas anyway, and also you know how they say when you perceive something about someone you are reacting to something about yourself<br/>
For concrete suggestions...does Hannah like to play on the computer?  My Will plays for hours without a peep and this is my best idea when I need him to give me time, space, or peace...I usually keep a new game for just such an occasion.  <br/>
I agree that you need to get your dh to pick up some slack; help to entertain Hannah when he is home, wash dishes, cook food, pick up toys, whatever.  And yes, of course, get all the rest that you can!  Bless your heart; I am sorry you are having a rough time of it!  Good luck w the impending birth!<br/>
Love,<br/>
Millie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817852655">Wow, Robyn, what a great post.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everything Robyn said (especially about getting all the help <br/>
that you can with everything around the house).<br/>
<br/>
Lydia was often as you describe your daughter at 4.5 (when I was 8 mos preg <br/>
with her brother).   At nearly 7, she is not like that at all.  Once the <br/>
baby was born, though, I faithfully arranged to have at least an hour every <br/>
day just with her, while the baby was napping, interacting with my husband, <br/>
etc.   That was very hard (because I wanted that time to just be ALONE), but <br/>
I think it really  helped her adjustment to having another member of the <br/>
family.  After the baby was born, I also spent 3 or 4 afternoons a week at <br/>
the house of friend with a child Lydia&#39;s age. The kids played, the baby and <br/>
I napped on the couch, and the friend brought me juice at intervals.  That <br/>
was really a lifesaver for me.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is really to breathe and remain calm and cheerful, so that <br/>
you are not modelling unpleasant behavior to her, and wait it out.  Smell <br/>
her head.  Look at her baby pictures.  Remind yourself that it will get <br/>
better.<br/>

<br/>
I think you are right on target that she is reacting to the changes in you.  <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest lots and lots of cuddle time.  If you are watching tv, ask her to join you.  If she is coloring, walk past and kiss her head.  Take lots of warm bubble baths and perhaps a backrub with lavender oils when she starts to get wound up.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard but try to remember that she isn&#39;t attacking you....she is unsettled by the changes that she can&#39;t understand and she is asking (in a 4yo way) for you to reassure her that everything is ok.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I just didn&#39;t know what else to title this: &quot;She is driving me crazy&quot;? &quot;I am<br/>

  the end of the day I am drained by her constant chatter and demands and<br/>
  tantrums. Hmmmm. she is constantly pulling me closer to her and wanting to<br/>
  control and dominate me and then when I get with her, she pushes me away.<br/>
  Ok. so what approach do I take, what can I do to fill her up with what she<br/>
  needs? What does she need? How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
  Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I know this isn&#39;t really an unschooling issue, but I really appreciate any<br/>
  insight you wonderful women can shed, I respect your opinions and life<br/>
  experiences so much, thank you in advance for your help,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88225076">Hi Sherri-Lee,<br/>
I can&#39;t believe that you are going through the exact same thing that <br/>
I am going through. I just read what you wrote and I was amazed. I&#39;m <br/>
9 months pregnant due any day. And my 7yr.old is doing exactly what <br/>
your daughter is doing. He can&#39;t decide on anything on his own. I <br/>
have to guess what he wants to eat, to play or to do. I get Sooooooo <br/>
frustrated. And just want to scream. He is my youngest child and <br/>
number 4 will be here any day. This all started in my 3rd trimester, <br/>
when he realized he wasn&#39;t going to be the baby any more. I know <br/>
what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;m living it right now. All I can tell <br/>
you is that I have to seperate myself from him just to breath. Sorry <br/>
that I don&#39;t have good advise. I just wanted to let you know that <br/>
I&#39;m in the same boat that you&#39;re in. <br/>
Good Luck, and I hope that things get better soon. <br/>
Mila<br/>

<br/>
What a fantastic post, this is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I *knew* her behaviour was age appropriate, not pleasant but not surprising<br/>
for her age. I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>
increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>
<br/>
I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a much<br/>
better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>
approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me and<br/>
not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>
noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>
<br/>
She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to ignore<br/>
it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>
<br/>
Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for articulating<br/>
it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my opinion,<br/>
doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in his<br/>
parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>
been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot. He<br/>
spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>
her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
that and did even more today.<br/>
<br/>
I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after the<br/>
baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>
house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that I<br/>
am sure will help.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating but<br/>
reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>
of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you know?<br/>
Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>
<br/>
I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>
harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>
your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>
this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>
<br/>
I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>
unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had done<br/>
recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>
dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the case<br/>
I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>

Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] help<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>
child<br/>
for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at me.<br/>
mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of energy<br/>
in the last month?<br/>
Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>
screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>
&quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>
screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she has<br/>
ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>
one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell Institute<br/>
(and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>
be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>
would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>
but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your very<br/>
pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>
the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how they<br/>
are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong thing<br/>
(no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>
between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>
request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does take<br/>
the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>
spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>
me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>
you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>
go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>
get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction<br/>
to<br/>
the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>
her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>
all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>
to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>
can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>
and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>
service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>
Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>
know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>
rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>
to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>
anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>
now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>
solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>
for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>
you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>
after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
(without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>
behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>
like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>
just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>
playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>
&quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>
she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>
negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>
eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>
particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>
resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>
for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>
of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>
attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
&quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>
the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>
behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>
moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
months ago. <br/>
<br/>
This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658083993">Hi Millie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
My dh has been doing more around here that is for sure and with her.<br/>
However, he works very hard, having his own business and all and is well....<br/>
old LOL... so he only has so much energy too it seems. I am going to get<br/>
someone in to help out more with the housework etc which should help.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah does like playing on the computer. She has some games now and has<br/>
spent time each day playing (we got a new Dora game for her today) and she<br/>
loves it... but she isn&#39;t quite there with doing it on her own, unless she<br/>
has played the game a few times. But it is a nice break yes.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure my &quot;rough time&quot; is of my own creation, so I have to work on my own<br/>
attitude I think,<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I feel like I just want to be left alone, for one day just one<br/>
day to just sit and veg and watch TV and play on the computer and not have<br/>
to talk to ANYONE unless I want to. Selfish huh? And would that really make<br/>
that much of a difference? I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

Sherri-Lee,<br/>
I just want to send you a (((hug)))), bless your heart.  I agree w what<br/>
Ulrike said, that Hannah is probably reflecting some of your misery.  These<br/>
little folks are so in tune with their Mamas anyway, and also you know how<br/>
they say when you perceive something about someone you are reacting to<br/>
something about yourself<br/>
For concrete suggestions...does Hannah like to play on the computer?  My<br/>
Will plays for hours without a peep and this is my best idea when I need him<br/>
to give me time, space, or peace...I usually keep a new game for just such<br/>
an occasion.  <br/>
I agree that you need to get your dh to pick up some slack; help to<br/>
entertain Hannah when he is home, wash dishes, cook food, pick up toys,<br/>
whatever.  And yes, of course, get all the rest that you can!  Bless your<br/>
heart; I am sorry you are having a rough time of it!  Good luck w the<br/>
impending birth!<br/>
Love,<br/>
Millie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708865492">Hi Cat,<br/>
<br/>
These are really good suggestions. Thank you. I will have to make sure to<br/>
schedule time alone for me and Hannah each day after the baby is born. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have a friend I could impose on like that, lucky you!<br/>
<br/>
My dh has committed to taking Hannah to her classes after the baby is born<br/>
at least so that part of her routine won&#39;t be disrupted too much.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, you gave me more to think about,<br/>

Wow, Robyn, what a great post.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everything Robyn said (especially about getting all the help <br/>
that you can with everything around the house).<br/>
<br/>
Lydia was often as you describe your daughter at 4.5 (when I was 8 mos preg <br/>
with her brother).   At nearly 7, she is not like that at all.  Once the <br/>
baby was born, though, I faithfully arranged to have at least an hour every <br/>
day just with her, while the baby was napping, interacting with my husband, <br/>
etc.   That was very hard (because I wanted that time to just be ALONE), but<br/>
<br/>
I think it really  helped her adjustment to having another member of the <br/>
family.  After the baby was born, I also spent 3 or 4 afternoons a week at <br/>
the house of friend with a child Lydia&#39;s age. The kids played, the baby and <br/>
I napped on the couch, and the friend brought me juice at intervals.  That <br/>
was really a lifesaver for me.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is really to breathe and remain calm and cheerful, so that <br/>
you are not modelling unpleasant behavior to her, and wait it out.  Smell <br/>
her head.  Look at her baby pictures.  Remind yourself that it will get <br/>
better.<br/>

Hi Sherri-Lee,<br/>
I can&#39;t believe that you are going through the exact same thing that <br/>
I am going through. I just read what you wrote and I was amazed. I&#39;m <br/>
9 months pregnant due any day. And my 7yr.old is doing exactly what <br/>
your daughter is doing. He can&#39;t decide on anything on his own. I <br/>
have to guess what he wants to eat, to play or to do. I get Sooooooo <br/>
frustrated. And just want to scream. He is my youngest child and <br/>
number 4 will be here any day. This all started in my 3rd trimester, <br/>
when he realized he wasn&#39;t going to be the baby any more. I know <br/>
what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;m living it right now. All I can tell <br/>
you is that I have to seperate myself from him just to breath. Sorry <br/>
that I don&#39;t have good advise. I just wanted to let you know that <br/>
I&#39;m in the same boat that you&#39;re in. <br/>
Good Luck, and I hope that things get better soon. <br/>
Mila<br/>

You are so right, thank you! It is so hard to remember that she isn&#39;t<br/>
attacking me personally when it feels that way and of course the hormones<br/>
make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
It has been hard to see her as unsettled about this when outwardly she has<br/>
been so excited about the baby all the time. But I see looking a little<br/>
closer that perhaps that is the case, she is feeling unsure of all of this<br/>
and of course it is hard to hear mommy say &quot;I can&#39;t do XXX because of this<br/>
big belly&quot; over and over. Or to have me so tired all the time because of it.<br/>
Guess we could be breeding some resentment in her huh? <br/>
<br/>
WOW this is SO hard. I often wonder what have I done? <br/>

I think you are right on target that she is reacting to the changes in you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest lots and lots of cuddle time.  If you are watching tv, ask<br/>
her to join you.  If she is coloring, walk past and kiss her head.  Take<br/>
lots of warm bubble baths and perhaps a backrub with lavender oils when she<br/>
starts to get wound up.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard but try to remember that she isn&#39;t attacking you....she is<br/>
unsettled by the changes that she can&#39;t understand and she is asking (in a<br/>
4yo way) for you to reassure her that everything is ok.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527252474">Sherri,<br/>
<br/>
The way you described your dd sounds like some of my desperate posts <br/>
to various lists from not so long ago.  She was 4.5 and I was in my <br/>
3rd trimester.  I was as drained and frustrated as you with the <br/>
behavior, demands and conflicts.  From the wise people on several <br/>
boards and a myriad of parenting books, I learned that much of it  <br/>
indeed was/is NORMAL for her age.  <br/>
<br/>
I began to emotionally detach myself from it, which is a lifesaver.  <br/>
It is hard to let our child express their emotions when they make us <br/>
uncomfortable, and not to take them personally.  It is also difficult <br/>
to step away from the need to feel respected at all times, and work <br/>
on being respectful and accepting of the child no matter what.  <br/>
<br/>
We cannot expect them to act like adults, but the secret, really <br/>
seems to be giving them the same acceptance and respect as other <br/>
adults. We model what we want. The benefit in doing so, I am finding, <br/>
is that it then frees me up to share wuth my dd how what she is doing <br/>
makes me feel.  It has really helped to let her in on my perspective -<br/>
&quot;boy, when you yell at me like that it makes me feel sad&quot; or &quot;sure <br/>
I&#39;ll try to help you but I would appreciate if you asked me nicly <br/>
next time&quot; or &quot;I need your understanding and help right now&quot; or &quot;it <br/>
really frustrates me when you ____&quot; or &quot;try that again sweetly, <br/>
please&quot;.  I just started talking and talking to her like she was/is <br/>
another adult, and she listens.  Her behavior did not immediately <br/>
change but over time, I am seeing that she is responding.  <br/>
<br/>
I also began naming/validating her feelings more without offering <br/>
a &quot;fix&quot; for the situation -- &quot;you seem really angry.  How can I help <br/>
you feel better?&quot;  And I have also been offering positive time-outs, <br/>
as in &quot;I see you are very frustrated right now. Perhaps it will help <br/>
if you take a break to calm down and feel better.  Can I help you to <br/>
your room (or other chosen place)?  Would you like to bring a toy?  <br/>
Would you like me to sit with you for awhile?  When you feel better, <br/>
we can talk.  Come out when you are ready.&quot;  I also have been giving <br/>
myself time-outs - &quot;I am feeling very bothered right now, I think I <br/>
need to take a break in the other room until I feel better.&quot;  It has <br/>
really seemed to help for her to see me do this, and she almost <br/>
always shifts her focus away from herself out of concern for me.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like alot to undertake when very pregnant, but even though I <br/>
too just wanted to be ALONE, I decided that since that was mostly not <br/>
an option, I made it a mission to be carried out in slow motion.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t do much else (had to let many things go, like housework) but <br/>
it was worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you believe, pray about it.  I pray all day, at every neccessary <br/>
moment.  Sometimes she looks at me like I am crazy, because I have <br/>
such a delayed reaction while I search for wisdom.  But it often <br/>
diffuses.  So does a blank look and &quot;I love you&quot; when she is <br/>
shrieking for something or giving me a nasty look.<br/>
<br/>
I also played &quot;Everything&#39;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; by Deanna Carter and <br/>
other inspirational music on repeat for all to hear many a day (still <br/>
do).<br/>
<br/>
Bless you,<br/>

I don&#39;t know how you are handling this but open-ended questions can be overwhelming for young kids, like &quot;what would you like for breakfast?&quot;, particularly kids not used to making those kinds of decisions or that are currently stressed.<br/>
<br/>
You might try offering her a couple of options and if those don&#39;t appeal to her, perhaps a couple of more options, like &quot;How about oatmeal or cheerios?&quot;<br/>

Just a thought.<br/>

  What a fantastic post, this is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
  I *knew* her behaviour was age appropriate, not pleasant but not surprising<br/>
  for her age. I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>
  increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>
<br/>
  I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a much<br/>
  better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>
  approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me and<br/>
  not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>
  noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>
<br/>
  She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to ignore<br/>
  it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for articulating<br/>
  it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my opinion,<br/>
  doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
  expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in his<br/>
  parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>
  been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot. He<br/>
  spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>
  her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
  appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
  that and did even more today.<br/>
<br/>
  I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after the<br/>
  baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>
  house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that I<br/>
  am sure will help.<br/>
<br/>
  It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating but<br/>
  reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>
  of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you know?<br/>
  Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>
<br/>
  I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>
  harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>
  your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>
  this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>
<br/>
  I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>
  unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had done<br/>
  recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>
  dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the case<br/>
  I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>

<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>
  child<br/>
  for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at me.<br/>
  mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of energy<br/>
  in the last month?<br/>
  Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>
  screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>
  &quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>
  screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she has<br/>
  ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>
  one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell Institute<br/>
  (and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
  irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>
  be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
  typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>
  would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
  Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>
  but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your very<br/>
  pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
  physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>
  the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
  I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how they<br/>
  are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
  this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
  what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong thing<br/>
  (no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>
  between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>
  request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does take<br/>
  the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
  mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>
  spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
  When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>
  me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>
  you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
  her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
  still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>
  go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
  her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>
  get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
  she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction<br/>
  to<br/>
  the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>
  her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
  opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
  her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>
  all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
  lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>
  to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
  your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
  much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>
  can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>
  and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>
  service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>
  Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
  inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
  rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
  decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>
  know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>
  rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
  melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>
  to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
  decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
  decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>
  anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>
  now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
  personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
  communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
  hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>
  solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
  coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
  responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
  emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
  One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>
  for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>
  you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>
  after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
  (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>
  behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
  you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
  hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
  response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>
  like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>
  just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
  business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>
  playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
  audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>
  &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>
  she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>
  negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>
  eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
  show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
  talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
  possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>
  particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>
  resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>
  for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>
  of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>
  attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
  attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
  Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
  &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>
  the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>
  behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>
  moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
  months ago. <br/>
<br/>
  This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>

To  be honest, I feel like I just want to be left alone, for one day just  one<br/>
day to just sit and veg and watch TV and play on the computer and not  have<br/>
to talk to ANYONE unless I want to. Selfish huh? And would that really  make<br/>

*I* feel that way with two independent boys, 16 and eight! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

So *that* is not just being pregnant with a four year old! &lt;BWG&gt; She  whether <br/>
you could arrange that. Maybe your husband and daughter could go visit  his <br/>
mom for the weekend. Ben used to do that (until the tension got too thick).  <br/>
Now they&#39;ll all go camping without me. I get the house to myself, I can eat what <br/>
 I want---or not, I have full control over the remote, I can garden, sleep, <br/>
play  on the &#39;puter, talk with friends, stare at the ceiling---whatever----for <br/>
two  days! Two or three times a year is all I need----but I *do* need it. And <br/>
I ask  for it.<br/>

Maybe ask? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165080934">&lt;&lt;&lt;I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>
much better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more<br/>
positive approach. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>
articulating<br/>
it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my opinion,<br/>
doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in his<br/>
parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>
been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot. He<br/>
spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>
her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
that and did even more today.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is another illustration of the phenomenon that made the &quot;Mars/Venus&quot;<br/>
guy a fortune. Men do seem to communicate differently than women do.<br/>
<br/>
My dh, James, just has to be asked for help. He will always assume that I am<br/>
OK unless I tell him otherwise, and hints or irony go right past him. He<br/>
also assumes he is doing enough unless I ask for more help. Plus even the<br/>
tiniest amount of appreciation goes a huge way with him, just as even the<br/>
tiniest criticism just about destroys him - the broken little boy comes back<br/>
and then gets defensive. It can be disconcerting to realize that our big,<br/>
grown husbands sometimes seem to respond best to the same strategies that a<br/>
doggie will respond to, rather than like a rational person. ;) <br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus modeling gratitude, approval and appreciation as primary<br/>
techniques for maintaining a loving marital relationship is also good for<br/>
our children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>
but reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what<br/>
colour of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>
know? Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is<br/>
doing?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A sound notion. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn just wants me to sit with her, and I really try to do so as<br/>
much as possible, even though sometimes I feel driven crazy by boredom. I<br/>
sometimes have a book with me. Picture us: I am sitting on one chair, with<br/>
Jayn sitting either on my lap or between my knees. She is using the computer<br/>
mouse and key board, while I hold a book or magazine out to the side to<br/>
read, while still answering her questions and helping her to read the<br/>
screen.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I know all about that particular website believe me - one of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
favorites. :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>
unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had done<br/>
recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>
dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the case<br/>
I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there is a certain appearance of wildness as the freedoms are<br/>
grasped, but things calm down over time. Sometimes it is a reaction to the<br/>
fear that controls will be reinstituted and so &quot;let&#39;s grab all we can now&quot;,<br/>
although that doesn&#39;t sound like the dynamic you have described.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by pulling back? I mean what actions would you be then<br/>
taking? It might be counter-productive if it ends up being more work<br/>
(emotionally draining) for you to have to enforce certain choices. Maybe<br/>
look back at why you wanted to live this way in the first place....<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Hannah just needs more practice at getting good at making choices and<br/>
gaining the feeling of confidence in herself. I have to say that we have<br/>
always lived this utterly free way, so my thoughts in this area may be less<br/>
helpful than others who have been through the process of changing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778110638">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this. I remembered it this morning as my dd ranted and railed<br/>
because her father stopped playing with her after 30 minutes of wrestling,<br/>
to go back to work. She was then over hungry and frustrated and mad and I<br/>
got the brunt of it. Screaming and shouting and kicking. Screaming go away<br/>
and leave me alone, but the second I get up to do what she wants, she is<br/>
grabbing at me, tripping me and screaming &quot;please stay with me mommy!&quot; I<br/>
find this SO hard. But I think I did well. I literally folded my lips up<br/>
between my teeth and just sat on the bed and listened. When she was rude to<br/>
me I would say &quot;of course I will do so and so for you, but then I would do<br/>
it if you asked politely too&quot;. This went on for over 30 minutes, hardly<br/>
makes 30 minutes of play seem well... worthwhile. Wanted desperately to say<br/>
&quot;if you keep this up daddy won&#39;t play with you in the mornings anymore&quot; but<br/>
I didn&#39;t. But I have to say I felt resentment at being left to deal with the<br/>
fall out of the play.<br/>
<br/>
She wanted me to carry her down the stairs, I said I would piggy back her,<br/>
but being this pregnant I wasn&#39;t comfortable carrying her on my front down<br/>
stairs anymore. Well that set her off again. Totally refusing the piggy<br/>
back. Finally she wanted me to go ask her dad to come get her, which he did,<br/>
thankfully. <br/>
<br/>
Then when we got downstairs, she tells him how mean I am to her, because I<br/>
got mad at her upstairs. Which I did not. I am so damned hormonal, I just<br/>
started to cry and looked at her told her that hurt my feelings and that it<br/>
was unfair. She just didn&#39;t care and went about her business. <br/>
<br/>
Not a great start to the day. It has not gotten a lot better except when she<br/>
is on the computer playing her new Dora game. It is my computer though and I<br/>
don&#39;t get any time on it now, because asking her to share is like asking<br/>
Bush to leave Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to be detached from her emotions today, but it is hard.<br/>
<br/>
I know she is acting this way partly because she is hungry, but she won&#39;t<br/>
stop on the computer to eat, so I get the end result. She won&#39;t leave the TV<br/>
to eat so I get the fall out. I am feeling really angry and resentful that I<br/>
ever let her on the computer or released limits on the TV when this is the<br/>
end result. Yes she can eat in front of the TV and we do that, but I will<br/>
not let her eat while on the computer. It is my laptop that I worked long<br/>
and hard to pay for and she will not eat while on it. So she says &quot;leave it<br/>
over there and I will come and have a bite&quot; but then she doesn&#39;t and gets<br/>
too hungry and I am the one who gets the fall out.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this is SO off topic and just a bunch of whining. Thank you for<br/>
listening and thank you for your support,<br/>

Sherri,<br/>
<br/>
The way you described your dd sounds like some of my desperate posts <br/>
to various lists from not so long ago.  She was 4.5 and I was in my <br/>
3rd trimester.  I was as drained and frustrated as you with the <br/>
behavior, demands and conflicts.  From the wise people on several <br/>
boards and a myriad of parenting books, I learned that much of it  <br/>
indeed was/is NORMAL for her age.  <br/>
<br/>
I began to emotionally detach myself from it, which is a lifesaver.  <br/>
It is hard to let our child express their emotions when they make us <br/>
uncomfortable, and not to take them personally.  It is also difficult <br/>
to step away from the need to feel respected at all times, and work <br/>
on being respectful and accepting of the child no matter what.  <br/>
<br/>
We cannot expect them to act like adults, but the secret, really <br/>
seems to be giving them the same acceptance and respect as other <br/>
adults. We model what we want. The benefit in doing so, I am finding, <br/>
is that it then frees me up to share wuth my dd how what she is doing <br/>
makes me feel.  It has really helped to let her in on my perspective -<br/>
&quot;boy, when you yell at me like that it makes me feel sad&quot; or &quot;sure <br/>
I&#39;ll try to help you but I would appreciate if you asked me nicly <br/>
next time&quot; or &quot;I need your understanding and help right now&quot; or &quot;it <br/>
really frustrates me when you ____&quot; or &quot;try that again sweetly, <br/>
please&quot;.  I just started talking and talking to her like she was/is <br/>
another adult, and she listens.  Her behavior did not immediately <br/>
change but over time, I am seeing that she is responding.  <br/>
<br/>
I also began naming/validating her feelings more without offering <br/>
a &quot;fix&quot; for the situation -- &quot;you seem really angry.  How can I help <br/>
you feel better?&quot;  And I have also been offering positive time-outs, <br/>
as in &quot;I see you are very frustrated right now. Perhaps it will help <br/>
if you take a break to calm down and feel better.  Can I help you to <br/>
your room (or other chosen place)?  Would you like to bring a toy?  <br/>
Would you like me to sit with you for awhile?  When you feel better, <br/>
we can talk.  Come out when you are ready.&quot;  I also have been giving <br/>
myself time-outs - &quot;I am feeling very bothered right now, I think I <br/>
need to take a break in the other room until I feel better.&quot;  It has <br/>
really seemed to help for her to see me do this, and she almost <br/>
always shifts her focus away from herself out of concern for me.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like alot to undertake when very pregnant, but even though I <br/>
too just wanted to be ALONE, I decided that since that was mostly not <br/>
an option, I made it a mission to be carried out in slow motion.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t do much else (had to let many things go, like housework) but <br/>
it was worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you believe, pray about it.  I pray all day, at every neccessary <br/>
moment.  Sometimes she looks at me like I am crazy, because I have <br/>
such a delayed reaction while I search for wisdom.  But it often <br/>
diffuses.  So does a blank look and &quot;I love you&quot; when she is <br/>
shrieking for something or giving me a nasty look.<br/>
<br/>
I also played &quot;Everything&#39;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; by Deanna Carter and <br/>
other inspirational music on repeat for all to hear many a day (still <br/>
do).<br/>
<br/>
Bless you,<br/>
Melissa Z.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745646472">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I have said &quot;what would you like?&quot; because if we don&#39;t start with that and<br/>
she has something in mind, she gets very angry at us having the nerve to<br/>
suggest anything. So that is the first question. If she has nothing in mind<br/>
then she says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and I start making suggestions. I always tell<br/>
her what I am having first, because she often wants that too and then I only<br/>
have to make one thing. If it is rejected, then I offer other  things to her<br/>
as you suggest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas, they confirmed what I was doing in that department was<br/>
ok at least:)<br/>

I don&#39;t know how you are handling this but open-ended questions can be<br/>
overwhelming for young kids, like &quot;what would you like for breakfast?&quot;,<br/>
particularly kids not used to making those kinds of decisions or that are<br/>
currently stressed.<br/>
<br/>
You might try offering her a couple of options and if those don&#39;t appeal to<br/>
her, perhaps a couple of more options, like &quot;How about oatmeal or cheerios?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

  What a fantastic post, this is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
  I *knew* her behaviour was age appropriate, not pleasant but not<br/>
surprising<br/>
  for her age. I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>
  increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>
<br/>
  I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>
much<br/>
  better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>
  approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me<br/>
and<br/>
  not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>
  noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>
<br/>
  She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
ignore<br/>
  it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>
articulating<br/>
  it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my<br/>
opinion,<br/>
  doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
  expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in<br/>
his<br/>
  parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>
  been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot.<br/>
He<br/>
  spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>
  her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
  appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
  that and did even more today.<br/>
<br/>
  I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after<br/>
the<br/>
  baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>
  house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that<br/>
I<br/>
  am sure will help.<br/>
<br/>
  It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>
but<br/>
  reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>
  of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>
know?<br/>
  Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>
<br/>
  I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>
  harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>
  your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>
  this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>
<br/>
  I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>
  unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had<br/>
done<br/>
  recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable<br/>
of<br/>
  dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the<br/>
case<br/>
  I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>
  child<br/>
  for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at<br/>
me.<br/>
  mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of<br/>
energy<br/>
  in the last month?<br/>
  Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>
  screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>
  &quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>
  screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she<br/>
has<br/>
  ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>
  one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell<br/>
Institute<br/>
  (and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
  irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>
  be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
  typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>
  would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
  Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>
  but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your<br/>
very<br/>
  pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
  physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>
  the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
  I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how<br/>
they<br/>
  are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
  this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
  what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong<br/>
thing<br/>
  (no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>
  between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>
  request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does<br/>
take<br/>
  the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
  mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when<br/>
she<br/>
  spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
  When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce<br/>
off<br/>
  me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge<br/>
on<br/>
  you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
  her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
  still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She<br/>
will<br/>
  go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
  her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting<br/>
to<br/>
  get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
  she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in<br/>
reaction<br/>
  to<br/>
  the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing<br/>
with<br/>
  her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
  opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
  her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more<br/>
toys<br/>
  all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
  lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>
  to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
  your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
  much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>
  can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>
  and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>
  service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>
  Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
  inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
  rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
  decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read<br/>
and<br/>
  know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest<br/>
is<br/>
  rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
  melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I<br/>
have<br/>
  to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
  decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
  decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to<br/>
explain<br/>
  anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear<br/>
you<br/>
  now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
  personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
  communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
  hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>
  solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
  coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
  responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
  emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
  One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the<br/>
possibilities<br/>
  for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>
  you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>
  after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
  (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the<br/>
meltdown<br/>
  behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you<br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
  you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
  hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
  response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
  like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes<br/>
I<br/>
  just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
  business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has<br/>
been<br/>
  playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
  audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>
  &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>
  she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without<br/>
first<br/>
  negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>
  eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
  show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
  talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
  possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>
  particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>
  resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a<br/>
DVD<br/>
  for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In<br/>
terms<br/>
  of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>
  attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
  attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
  Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
  &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her<br/>
and<br/>
  the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>
  behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at<br/>
the<br/>
  moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
  months ago. <br/>
<br/>
  This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>

<br/>
I am glad I am not alone, but not overly happy to hear this feeling lingers<br/>
for so long:)<br/>
<br/>
My in laws are both dead and my dh is on the outs with his brother over the<br/>
execution of the will, so there is no family of his to visit like that<br/>
sadly. My family is all over 3 hours away so no quick visits there either.<br/>
<br/>
As I have said, my dh has really been great lately picking up the slack and<br/>
doing more with her and taking her places and he really is trying to help<br/>
thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to arrange his sister to come play with Hannah one day next week<br/>
so I can have some time alone upstairs at least, but she is someone that is<br/>
only ok on a very occasional basis, as we found out earlier in the year when<br/>
we over used her LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions,<br/>

To  be honest, I feel like I just want to be left alone, for one day just<br/>
one<br/>
day to just sit and veg and watch TV and play on the computer and not  have<br/>
to talk to ANYONE unless I want to. Selfish huh? And would that really  make<br/>
that much of a difference? I don&#39;t  know.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

*I* feel that way with two independent boys, 16 and eight! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
So *that* is not just being pregnant with a four year old! &lt;BWG&gt; She<br/>
whether <br/>
you could arrange that. Maybe your husband and daughter could go visit  his <br/>
mom for the weekend. Ben used to do that (until the tension got too thick).<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;ll all go camping without me. I get the house to myself, I can eat<br/>
what <br/>
 I want---or not, I have full control over the remote, I can garden, sleep, <br/>
play  on the &#39;puter, talk with friends, stare at the<br/>
ceiling---whatever----for <br/>
two  days! Two or three times a year is all I need----but I *do* need it.<br/>
And <br/>
I ask  for it.<br/>

Maybe ask? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733079144">Hi AJ,<br/>
<br/>
No hijacking... I love hearing that I am not alone. It is too easy to get<br/>
into talking about all the great things our kid do, which seems to be<br/>
opposite to the mainstream way, that I sometimes forget that the people I<br/>
admire on my lists aren&#39;t always perfect parents:)<br/>
<br/>
I had never thought about a growth spurt causing melt downs but of course it<br/>
makes sense. I am stymied about the food thing, because she is so clearly<br/>
hungry but simply will not eat unless I completely make her turn things off<br/>
and come to the table. It has never been a battle before but all of a sudden<br/>
she is so interested in what she wants to do that she doesn&#39;t want to stop -<br/>
I understand that, but simply she has to eat or she is screaming at me all<br/>
the time and I can&#39;t take it.<br/>
<br/>
I had hired a woman to come last fall with her daughter who was the same age<br/>
as Hannah. They would come and play and I would either be upstairs working<br/>
or go out to do something. It worked very well for awhile and then the girls<br/>
started to have conflicts and the mom stopped being involved. I would come<br/>
in and find her copying recipes out of a magazine I had left out, while the<br/>
girls were in the house running around and around the kitchen screaming at<br/>
the top of their lungs, until one of them just lost it. Not value for my<br/>
dollar. So we stopped last Christmas and it was obvious it had just become<br/>
that Hannah was spending too much time with them.<br/>
<br/>
Then this spring when I found out I was pregnant, I asked my SIL (who<br/>
doesn&#39;t work) if she wanted to come over and spend time with Hannah 3 times<br/>
a week for 2 hours each time. They got along great and she made some money.<br/>
That lasted for awhile, but then it just became too much again. She is very<br/>
rigid and stiff and unimaginative and Hannah would just get sick and tired<br/>
of her rigidity and she was screaming at her too much. So we slowed that<br/>
down a lot. Now it is just rarely that we use her and although Hannah<br/>
resists at the idea, they have fun once she gets here.<br/>
<br/>
So will try to get her in next week and see how that works... Hannah has<br/>
agreed in theory so far so that is good. Believe me I have thought about<br/>
sticking her in preschool just to get a break, but how can I do that, when I<br/>
totally disagree with school and have told her we homeschool for the last<br/>
year LOL... I can&#39;t be using it as a baby sitter service just because life<br/>
is getting tough.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the comments, good to hear from you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279520789">This is probably going to get me in trouble here but I can&#39;t say that I would just sit and swallow everything if someone (anyone, adults included) was continually yelling and screaming at me when I was doing my best to try and help them.<br/>
<br/>
The occassional meltdown or even not so occassional I can do.  My 5yo can be one to go off on people over and over again for the slightest provocation so I understand where Sheree is coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would do the things I can think of to help out...offering limited choices to help with decision making, making sure there was cuddle time, trying to listen through the anger....but if it went on and on, I would probably remove myself from the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Dan (5) had gotten to where no matter what anyone did if they weren&#39;t reading his mind and knowing just exactly what he wanted done, he would yell at them, throw things, call them names, etc..  I can usually make a joke and get him out of it but he was doing it to the other kids in the family as well.  It wasn&#39;t fair for the other 5yo to be hit or yelled at because she did something that was perceived by Dan as a slight of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
So I stopped Dan in the beginning of one of his torrents and said &quot;It is ok to be mad or sad.  You can come to me and I will hug you and rub your back until you feel better but it is absolutely not ok to scream and yell at people.&quot;  and I bearhugged him and walked off.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, he comes runnning to me out of the blue a lot and just hugs me for a minute and says he loves me and runs back off to play.  He still has meltdowns ever so often but he really is trying to use me as a resource.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

  Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
  I have said &quot;what would you like?&quot; because if we don&#39;t start with that and<br/>
  she has something in mind, she gets very angry at us having the nerve to<br/>
  suggest anything. So that is the first question. If she has nothing in mind<br/>
  then she says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and I start making suggestions. I always tell<br/>
  her what I am having first, because she often wants that too and then I only<br/>
  have to make one thing. If it is rejected, then I offer other  things to her<br/>
  as you suggest.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the ideas, they confirmed what I was doing in that department was<br/>
  ok at least:)<br/>

  I don&#39;t know how you are handling this but open-ended questions can be<br/>
  overwhelming for young kids, like &quot;what would you like for breakfast?&quot;,<br/>
  particularly kids not used to making those kinds of decisions or that are<br/>
  currently stressed.<br/>
<br/>
  You might try offering her a couple of options and if those don&#39;t appeal to<br/>
  her, perhaps a couple of more options, like &quot;How about oatmeal or cheerios?&quot;<br/>

    What a fantastic post, this is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
    I *knew* her behaviour was age appropriate, not pleasant but not<br/>
  surprising<br/>
    for her age. I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>
    increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>
<br/>
    I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>
  much<br/>
    better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>
    approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me<br/>
  and<br/>
    not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>
    noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>
<br/>
    She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
  ignore<br/>
    it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>
<br/>
    Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>
  articulating<br/>
    it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my<br/>
  opinion,<br/>
    doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
    expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in<br/>
  his<br/>
    parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>
    been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot.<br/>
  He<br/>
    spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>
    her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
    appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
    that and did even more today.<br/>
<br/>
    I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after<br/>
  the<br/>
    baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>
    house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that<br/>
  I<br/>
    am sure will help.<br/>
<br/>
    It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>
  but<br/>
    reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>
    of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>
  know?<br/>
    Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>
<br/>
    I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>
    harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>
    your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>
    this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>
<br/>
    I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>
    unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had<br/>
  done<br/>
    recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable<br/>
  of<br/>
    dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the<br/>
  case<br/>
    I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>
<br/>

    &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>
    child<br/>
    for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at<br/>
  me.<br/>
    mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of<br/>
  energy<br/>
    in the last month?<br/>
    Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>
    screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>
    &quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>
    screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she<br/>
  has<br/>
    ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>
    one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell<br/>
  Institute<br/>
    (and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
    irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>
    be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
    typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>
    would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
    Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>
    but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your<br/>
  very<br/>
    pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
    physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>
    the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
    I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how<br/>
  they<br/>
    are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>
    this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>
    what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong<br/>
  thing<br/>
    (no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>
    between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
    If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>
    request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does<br/>
  take<br/>
    the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
    mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when<br/>
  she<br/>
    spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
    When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce<br/>
  off<br/>
    me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge<br/>
  on<br/>
    you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
    her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
    still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She<br/>
  will<br/>
    go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
    her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
    Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting<br/>
  to<br/>
    get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
    she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in<br/>
  reaction<br/>
    to<br/>
    the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing<br/>
  with<br/>
    her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
    opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>
    her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more<br/>
  toys<br/>
    all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
    lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>
    to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
    your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
    much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>
    can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>
    and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>
    service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>
    Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
    inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
    rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
    decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read<br/>
  and<br/>
    know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest<br/>
  is<br/>
    rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
    melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I<br/>
  have<br/>
    to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>
    decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
    decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to<br/>
  explain<br/>
    anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear<br/>
  you<br/>
    now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
    personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
    communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
    hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>
    solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
    coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
    responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
    emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
    One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the<br/>
  possibilities<br/>
    for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>
    you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>
    after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
    (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the<br/>
  meltdown<br/>
    behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you<br/>
  think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
    you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
    hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
    response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes<br/>
  doesn&#39;t<br/>
    like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes<br/>
  I<br/>
    just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
    business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has<br/>
  been<br/>
    playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
    audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>
    &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>
    she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without<br/>
  first<br/>
    negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>
    eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
    show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
    talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
    possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>
    particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>
    resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a<br/>
  DVD<br/>
    for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In<br/>
  terms<br/>
    of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>
    attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
    attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
    Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
    &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her<br/>
  and<br/>
    the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>
    behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at<br/>
  the<br/>
    moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
    months ago. <br/>
<br/>
    This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>

LOL.  I am very much an extrovert but I tend to find that I need time alone to get re-centered.  Otherwise, I find things start to spin out of control.<br/>

  Introverts recharge in alone time. Extroverts recharge with other<br/>

  &gt; The feeling doesn&#39;t linger. It&#39;s just Who You Are. *I* am the kind of  person<br/>
  &gt; that needs some alone time.  We&#39;ve talked about this several times  over the<br/>
  &gt; years on different lists. Some folks need time with groups of people to<br/>
  &gt; recharge their batteries; some need time to themselves. I&#39;m a &quot;time-to-herself&quot;<br/>
  &gt; kind of gal. You too, maybe.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Maybe there&#39;s another mom in your area (LLL maybe?) who could work out a<br/>
  &gt; play date for Hannah while you get some rest.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If you don&#39;t ask, no one knows you need help! All of us are  willing----but<br/>
  &gt; too far to be of physical assistance! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

through a growth spurt earlier in the year, you can tell something is <br/>
wrong. They don&#39;t usually get so worked up over such little things. I <br/>
know it&#39;s not a personality trait and that it will not last forever. <br/>
Okay, sometimes that doesn&#39;t help, but...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s different than the habit ds has of getting very worked up over <br/>
innocent things people say to him. Yes, I acknowledge his sensitivity <br/>
to words, but it&#39;s not okay for him to continue to yell at people <br/>
when he gets upset. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still struggling mightily to find something to help. The <br/>
situation is much better at home because we are all more gentle in <br/>
general than we used to be. Saying anything to Mikey (almost 4) once <br/>
he&#39;s upset is likely to make things worse. So when we are among other <br/>
people, with all their negative comments and near complete lack of <br/>
caring about upseting a 3-4 yr old, he gets upset a lot. I sympathize <br/>
with him, but I also know I can&#39;t change the world for him. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm. I&#39;ve had some success talking about how babies/toddlers are <br/>
likely to push down block towers and rip up track and how two year <br/>
olds sometimes hit and don&#39;t wait their turn and his expectations are <br/>
more realistic now so he doesn&#39;t get as upset. Maybe I need to talk <br/>
more about how he felt when so and so said &quot;you laugh like a girl&quot; <br/>
and an adult asked &quot;do you go to school?&quot; and talk about why people <br/>
say these things etc. Preparing him usually helps, but I think I got <br/>
off track and was only talking about how he should and shouldn&#39;t <br/>
respond...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Julie, for making me think outloud!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477453510">Sherri, I haven&#39;t read any responses by others yet but I wanted to say that it sounds like <br/>
your daughter&#39;s and your connection is broken right now. I went through it when I was <br/>
pregnant too. I was so exhausted. Yes, I was with her 24/7 but NEVER had time to myself <br/>
so when I was with her I wasn&#39;t truly &quot;with&quot; her. I was overwhelemd and needing some <br/>
head space. It is MUCH easier to connect with Ella (also 4.5) when I have taken care of <br/>
myself too.<br/>
<br/>
It will get easier. I think working on rebuilding your connection to each other would help a <br/>
lot! There is a book called &quot;I Love You Rituals&quot; by Becky Bailey which has some good ideas <br/>
for reconnecting with your kids.<br/>

Hang in there!<br/>
