<div id="ygrps-yiv-790990575">In WA, you can get an &quot;instruction permit&quot; at 15 if you are enrolled in a driver&#39;s ed program or at 15 1/2 if you pass a written test (meaning you have to have a licensed adult with you in the car at all times), but you must be 16 for a &quot;full license&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192323291">In New Mexico, it&#39;s 15 for a provisional license, then after 6 mos of incident/ticket-free driving kids can get a full license. At 15.5 they can have an unrestricted license.  <br/>
   <br/>
  They have to complete driver&#39;s ed to include 35 hrs of classroom time and 50 hours of documented supervised time, with a driver&#39;s permit to qualify for the provisional license.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135541336">In Idaho you can begin driver&#39;s training at 14.5 -- student license once<br/>
completed where you have 4 months with a licensed adult driver in the<br/>
passenger seat and 50 hours drive time (10 of which must be after dark).<br/>
Then no age restriction you can go in and get a full license.<br/>
