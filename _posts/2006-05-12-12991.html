don&#39;t mean the same thing that a 6 yo does.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; and said the two of them had been playing there together (not just  <br/>
&gt; side by<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which isn&#39;t an indication that she&#39;s emotionally ready to handle a  <br/>
friendship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do try and do this it&#39;s just not always easy to do before she hits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You shouldn&#39;t be trying. You should be doing. You need to be right  <br/>
there next to her at all times because you&#39;ve chosen to put her in a  <br/>
social situation she isn&#39;t ready to handle. It&#39;s your responsibility  <br/>
to prevent her from hitting either by not putting her near children  <br/>
she can hit or being right there paying attention. Treat this as  <br/>
though it were a busy road next to a playground that she had a  <br/>
penchant for running towards. You wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Well, I try to stop  <br/>
her but it isn&#39;t always easy.&quot; You either don&#39;t go to that playground  <br/>
or you get better at being on top of her keeping her safe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also try to take this into consideration, but even if one of  <br/>
&gt; those is the<br/>
&gt; culprit I feel she needs to learn that it&#39;s never okay to hit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is your sticking point. You&#39;re trying to teach her but  <br/>
she isn&#39;t ready. She may understand your words but she isn&#39;t ready to  <br/>
make rational decisions about the emotions that well up in her. Which  <br/>
means she isn&#39;t ready to learn. Do give her information. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need to be an explanation. No is good in this case. Let the actions  <br/>
-- removing yourself, your husband or her -- speak.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the times you may have had more cookies than you really  <br/>
wanted, or read longer than you meant to, or zoned in front of the  <br/>
TV, or spent more than you thought you should on something, or got  <br/>
more angry than a situation called for. You&#39;ve had 20+ years of  <br/>
practice and still haven&#39;t entirely mastered your emotional  <br/>
responses. And you&#39;re expecting better from your daughter after only  <br/>
2.5 years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I were to drop playgroups, I think I&#39;d go crazy. LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It needs to be about and for your daughter. If you have needs to  <br/>
connect with other adults or to be away to refresh, you&#39;ll need to  <br/>
find another way, one that isn&#39;t at your daughter&#39;s or other  <br/>
children&#39;s expense. (Ask on the list! See what other parents have  <br/>
done. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you do<br/>
&gt; when they need time in a comfort chair but don&#39;t want to go?  How  <br/>
&gt; do you get<br/>
&gt; started with it, and can I start at this age?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think ask a different question! Ask what other parents have done  <br/>
with emotional 2 yos. Unless you&#39;re asking about hitting then I don&#39;t  <br/>
think she needs cooling off. She needs more of what others have  <br/>
suggested.<br/>
<br/>
It is *really* hard not to judge kids abilities by their verbal  <br/>
abilities. I&#39;ve done it with my daughter without her being verbally  <br/>
precoscious, just with age average abilties. I&#39;ve judged her against  <br/>
her friends who seem so much more mature because of the way they  <br/>
speak and act. But the inside isn&#39;t as mature as the outside and that  <br/>
needs to be taken into account.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to read Your Two Year Old. The methods aren&#39;t always  <br/>
attachment parenting friendly but lots of people have said they&#39;re  <br/>
spot on as far as development. (They didn&#39;t work for my daughter, but  <br/>
there&#39;ve been way more people who said they worked than not.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for putting that out there.  I&#39;ve been struggling with this<br/>
the past month w/ my 23.5 month old.  She&#39;s very verbal and I think I<br/>
have been assuming emotional ability based on verbal ability.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are 18, 15, and almost 2.<br/>
I&#39;ve made a deliberate decison to keep my youngest daughter from<br/>
day-care situations and to homeschool for at least the first 3 years.<br/>
 As I&#39;ve researched the options, unschooling sounds more and more like<br/>
what I want for our family.  But it also sounds like it is going to be<br/>
very hard for me to let go of the *control* that has always seemed to<br/>
elude me. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m overwhelmed reading these discussions.<br/>
<br/>
2 year olds *really* don&#39;t need to play w/ other kids??<br/>
That goes against everything I&#39;ve ever been told, read or inferred<br/>
about child development.  However my gut is screaming that you are<br/>
right.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Renee, as a mom of 2 boys, one almost 5 and one 17mo, I can attest <br/>
that 2yos don&#39;t *need* to play with other kids.  I think it&#39;s more the <br/>
moms that need the interaction than the kids.  I know that&#39;s the case <br/>
for me.  I needed to get out and talk with other adults, so it was just <br/>
easier to do it with moms that had kids who were the same age.  If you <br/>
really watch 2yos playing, they&#39;re really playing independently, or <br/>
side-by-side and not really &quot;with each other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was just at a playdate on Wednesday with a bunch of other moms I <br/>
know.  All of the kids, except for my oldest, were under 3.  All of <br/>
their older kids were either at preschool or Kindergarten.  If you <br/>
watched, the kids played independently.  None of them said, &quot;Let&#39;s go <br/>
blow bubbles together,&quot; but when a mom started blowing the bubbles, a <br/>
few of them came over to play with the bubbles, but none of them grabbed <br/>
another kid and pulled them over to play with the bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t think kids *want* or *need* to play with other kids <br/>
until they are older, like 4 or 5, depending on their verbal skills and <br/>
their maturity.<br/>
<br/>
Also, listen to your gut!  You know your child and what&#39;s right for your <br/>
child.  Don&#39;t ever ignore that gut feeling, it&#39;s there for a purpose!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;The Experts&quot; have said that children *need* to form social circles early.<br/>
Why?  Playgroups are so unnatural.  Rarely in our history do you hear<br/>
stories of lots of parents getting lots of children together to create<br/>
social circles.  We are trying to make our babies grow up so quickly today<br/>
that we are forcing our social circle patterns on them.  Children play best<br/>
at a young age by themselves or with another child who is older than them.<br/>
Groups of 10 two-year olds is a disaster waiting to happen.  And as I have<br/>
seen in most modern playgroups, &quot;playgroup&quot; means that all the children are<br/>
thrown into a melee together while the mothers stand over to the side and<br/>
chat.  Most mothers want to attend playgroup because *they* can interact.<br/>
It&#39;s *their* time, not necessarily time for their children.  I can&#39;t count<br/>
the number of fights, hurt feelings, hitting, biting and tears shed at the<br/>
playgroups I used to attend.  I&#39;m sure if you asked most 2 year olds what it<br/>
was that they liked about playgroup they would probably mention toys,<br/>
playground equipment or &quot;getting to go somewhere.&quot;  Rarely will they mention<br/>
friends.<br/>

little fists on her hips and replied &quot;I AM Oma, I&#39;m only 5 you know.&quot;  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s SO easy to fall into expecting more of kids than they&#39;re able to do, <br/>
especially when the child seems &quot;mature&quot; because of verbal precocity. Keep <br/>
reminding yourself she&#39;s not even 2 yet. It helps.<br/>
