My almost-3 yr old daughter is starting to really enjoy the computer. Can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756024841">My 3.5 y/o really enjoys playing the games on the Peep and the Big Wide<br/>
World website.  He loves that he can play the games and navigate between the<br/>
games on his own.  I think it helps that he is a fan of the show as well ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954084304">Nickjr.com and pbskids.org have some fun, easy games my son enjoys playing.  We have played with the Jump Start Preschool program, and while he enjoyed it for a week or so the previous sites have been mainstays for a year.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144656143">Over here we love noggin.com, nickjr.com, cartoonnetwork.com, bigfiahgames.com (they have a kids section but you do have to pay after your free try is up), mynoggin.com (another pay one that my son asked for and loves), we have some CD&#39;s like dr seuss, jumpstart preschool that my mom got him that he likes to play, starfall.com (teaches letters he asked one day for me to find him a game to teach him letters and we found this site), playhousedisney.com, neopets.com, and I am sure there are others I am forgetting about. He is 4 and has been playing computer games since about 2 1/2. This kid just amazes me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798478682">My young daughter loves PBSkids.org. It has lots of games, coloring,<br/>
and other activities, all organized by favorite character (Dragon<br/>
Tales, Mr. Rogers, Teletubbies, etc). I&#39;m not sure if the games will<br/>
be a little too advanced for an almost 3yo, but my dd started playing<br/>
at 4 so it&#39;s worth a try. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905523046">My gal adored poissonrouge.com which has scads of little interesting  <br/>
things to do.  She also likes starfall.com which is a learn-to-read  <br/>
site but is full of animated stories that it will read to you, which  <br/>
she liked.  Also, mothergoose.com has some fun little games.  She  <br/>
learned the keyboard playing babykeys from that site.  Not a site, but  <br/>
an excellent, free program, tuxpaint.org is an amazingly intuitive  <br/>
drawing program that she has spent hours and hours playing with.  Be  <br/>
sure to download the &#39;stamps&#39; add-on for lots of cool collage-like  <br/>
drawings.  Now that my girl is 4, my 2.5 yr old is starting on these  <br/>
sites/games.  He has just figured out how the mouse works and asks for  <br/>
&#39;red fish&#39; (poisson rouge is french for red fish) and &#39;penguin&#39; (the  <br/>
mascot of tuxpaint) frequently.  The four year old has moved on to  <br/>
Animal Crossing for gamecube (ancient, I know), which I read for her,  <br/>
for the most part, though she can figure out a lot of the repeat  <br/>
messages (like selling fruit she has picked to Nook, to make money to  <br/>
buy clothes, her favorite).  Animal Crossing is a total hoot--the  <br/>
adults in our household were totally obsessed with it for a few months  <br/>
when we first got it.  Even the two year old likes to make the little  <br/>
characters walk around and talk to the animals (I read for him).<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923952143">I have to say, despite the name, ALL my kids enjoy playing with this! It&#39;s BabyType. We actually spent the $20 to purchase the CD. And it&#39;s changed a lot over the years! It &quot;disables&quot; the important buttons on the keyboard, and, depending on what mode it&#39;s on, it makes sounds and pictures (a duck quack with a duck picture, a bell ring with a bell picture), or on another mode, it will display the actual key pressed and say it. My older ones love this. They like typing their names and seeing how they sound (&quot;Mom! My name is Moo-Cluck-Ding!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.raize.com/CProducts/BabyType/Default.asp">http://www.raize.com/CProducts/BabyType/Default.asp</a><br/>
They have a 10-day free demo to try, no obligations. Even my husband has been known to find the cow button and hit it a few times!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212974651">My 3-yr-old just discovered clubpenguin.com. It&#39;s a multiplayer game. You have a penguin <br/>
avatar and walk around to different places, and there&#39;s minigames to play. It&#39;s meant for older <br/>
kids, but quite a few of the games are easy enough for him to play -- he just doesn&#39;t get as <br/>
many points.<br/>
<br/>
We also just bought him a gameboy, which you can buy pretty cheap on ebay. He loves to <br/>
take it to the park for homeschool park day -- and sometimes he&#39;ll play it for awhile so <br/>
mommy or daddy can use the computer for awhile!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258745611">Oooh!  I second Club Penguin for 3 year olds!  Mine loved it for a<br/>
very long time.  He didn&#39;t care much if he had a membership.  He<br/>
really liked the mini games and exploring the different areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Gameboys are also great.  One of his favorite games is Pac-Man.  <br/>
<br/>
He also really likes any game his older brother plays.  Even games<br/>
that don&#39;t seem suited to a 3 year old might be fascinating for<br/>
him/her anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19858379">Hey, all:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As great a resource this discussion group is for me, there is one source of<br/>
frustration.  Many times some of you would list Web site links, but many of<br/>
them would turn out to be inaccessible to me as a Braille reader.  I am sure<br/>
that what you&#39;re point to is very relevant to the discussion at hand, but it<br/>
can be lost on me.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, if it&#39;s possible, please paste the passages you want to bring to our<br/>
attention.  If not this, please say a few words in summarizing the contents<br/>
or main points.  A few words may not be as good as reading the whole thing,<br/>
but they can go a long way in helping me follow the course of a discussion<br/>
and get the most important ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate this a lot, and perhaps there are others on this list who<br/>
would, too!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681923404">My 3 year old daughter loves Pirates of the Caribbean online.  She  <br/>
got into it because her brother was playing it all the time.  But she  <br/>
uses it completely differently from him.  She spends all the time  <br/>
making new pirates and dressing them - mainly females.  The dressing  <br/>
up part has more options than most of the Barbies, Bratz or other  <br/>
dress up sites that she normally visits because you can decide on  <br/>
height, body shaper, nose length, lip shape, and lots lots more.  She  <br/>
also likes the www.123pokemon.com where there are lots of different  <br/>
games including dress up - her favourite these days.<br/>
