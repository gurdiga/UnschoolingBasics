<div id="ygrps-yiv-423263355">Since we were on the subject I thought I&#39;d throw this one out there.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old daughter has ADD and really other than some mild <br/>
attention problems she is just a regular, great kid.  Now my 6 year <br/>
old daughter has Sensory Processing Disorder, and exhibits some <br/>
symptoms of Aspergers.  Now for the most part I can reason with my 8 <br/>
year old as to why she should not hit her sister or another child, <br/>
and she gets it.  My 6 year old is a whole other story.  First off <br/>
with her issues she is very prone to flying into a rage......which <br/>
as time has gone by she has learned to go to her room where she <br/>
screams, kicks the door and gets it out of her system.  But what <br/>
really bothers me is she has no empathy or compassion (a very common <br/>
symptom of SPD/AS kids), so I can not reason with this child as to <br/>
why she should not hit her sister or another child.  My poor 8 year <br/>
old gets punched, kicked, pinched, etc. on a regular basis and it&#39;s <br/>
usually unprovoked.  I could talk to my six year old till I was blue <br/>
in the face and she does not get it.  She generally can&#39;t play with <br/>
other children without me being there.  Socially she is a disaster, <br/>
which I&#39;ve been told is another trait of AS/SPD.  When someone <br/>
wrongs her she hits or punches them.  And it could be over something <br/>
as simple as they won&#39;t play the game she wants to play.  Punishing <br/>
or talking would do no good......we have been that route.  We have <br/>
tried the role playing, etc. with no luck.  I&#39;ve tried to tell her <br/>
the only thing she can hurt is a pillow.....no luck.  Today she <br/>
tried to run over the neighbors cat with her bike for the 100th <br/>
time, and for the 100th time I tried explaining to her why she <br/>
should not do that.  I feel like I&#39;m just spinning my tires over <br/>
here.  Now I should add that my six year old is also very bright.  <br/>
She figured out how to read all on her own when she was 4.  She was <br/>
reading chapter books in kindy, while the other kids were learning <br/>
their ABC&#39;s.  Public School bored her to tears, and it was one of <br/>
many reasons I decided to take them out.  So anyone out there have <br/>
any suggestions on how to not punish her, but to help her get the <br/>
message to not hit and punch.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556179427">Hi Kelly, I can empathize with you.  It is very difficult to know how  to <br/>
help these kids when you know you aren&#39;t able to connect them with the  problem <br/>
(did that make sense??).  My son was also not very verbal, so I  might as well <br/>
have been talking to a wall.<br/>
 <br/>
Please know this will all get better with time, but it is much work!<br/>
 <br/>
I highly recommend Ross Greene&#39;s The Explosive Child.  <br/>
 <br/>
What I do is break it down.  First, protect people and animals as much  as <br/>
you can.  For example, can you talk to the neighbor about keeping the  cat <br/>
indoors?  I often have to separate my children.  Sometimes that is  all I can do.<br/>
 <br/>
Next, work on the trust between you and your children.  My son doesn&#39;t  seem <br/>
to have the same natural level of trust as other kids, so I had to work  twice <br/>
as hard to develop it.  Respectful, mindful parenting will help  here.  Also, <br/>
working to set up a good &quot;yes&quot; environment.  For my kids,  we would go do <br/>
something special, like eat at a favorite restaurant.  Find  some places where <br/>
you normally wouldn&#39;t go the extra mile for your kids and do  it consistently.  <br/>
One friend of mine quit going on the family outings on  their boat because her <br/>
son didn&#39;t really like it, he would go  reluctantly.  They started having fun <br/>
days together doing what *he*  wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
You are right, you have to be around for her social interaction.  Try  to <br/>
play with the kids when possible and help them resolve their issues.  It  helped <br/>
me (thanks to Anne Ohman) to think of this as my time to show him by  example <br/>
How to Interact.  I also had a montessori teacher friend who taught  me about <br/>
conflict resolution.  Most children are just told to work it out  themselves, <br/>
you are doing your children (and the neighborhood kids) the skills  of dealing <br/>
with others!  I have not been doing this lately and I really  need to get <br/>
back in the habit.  I&#39;m thinking of getting some of the  Non-Violent <br/>
Communication material.<br/>
 <br/>
I have occasionally used coercion in the form of not letting him ride the  <br/>
bike if he was running over a cat, my son needs big gestures to get those points <br/>
 sometimes.  It was the only way I could get him to understand.  I try  to <br/>
only use these gestures when it involves safety and/or immediacy.  It is  not <br/>
random though, like I try not to say &quot;you can&#39;t go to the park if you don&#39;t  <br/>
brush your teeth&quot;.  More like &quot;you may not play in your sister&#39;s room if  you are <br/>
going to hit her&quot; sort of common sense consequence.  I find though,  that he <br/>
just gets mad at me and doesn&#39;t always connect that *he* is the cause of  the <br/>
problem, so I work as much as possible on other ways to do things.  But  <br/>
sometimes it is the only thing that works!  I have found with time that  these <br/>
ideas are making more sense to him.<br/>
 <br/>
He just turned ten and things are so much better.  Just keep doing  what you <br/>
can and learning about how to help your kids.  I am far from  perfect, but I <br/>
do see results.  I also find supplements, diet, energy work  to be very, very <br/>
helpful.  We have recently begun homeopathy which is  helping tremendously.<br/>

the signs she&#39;s getting to the boiling point and change the <br/>
situation: whether it&#39;s simply intervening a little to <br/>
help &quot;translate&quot; for her &quot;I&#39;m sorry Janie but she&#39;s not wanting to <br/>
do that right now&quot; (when she&#39;s so frustrated she can&#39;t explain <br/>
verbally) or help her transition to something else, help her learn <br/>
to walk away to cool down or take a breath or whatever. It takes <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944504864">Leslie,<br/>
  I think I met you on another yahoo group.  I am also in SC.  I swear fish oil has practically cured my daughters ADD, and helped my own ADD tremendously.  So I am all for the natural/alternative route.  If I feel good, and the kids feel good things are a whole lot better around here.  Homeopathy I&#39;m sure would help my daughter with SPD and possibel AS, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the budget right now.  I think I have come a long way in my own parenting skills in the last year, and just last night my husband complemented me on what a wonderful Mother I was.  I used to have no patience and was just frustrated all the time.  Over the last year I&#39;ve changed everything, and look at everything differently now.......obviously I had to change my thinking because my stinky attitude just was not working.  So I&#39;m hoping that in time Mariah will &quot;get it&quot;.  She has so many other wonderful qualities, and I want those qualities to stand out instead of them being over-shadowed by the fact<br/>
 that she is being obnoxious, and hitting.  Thank You for the advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82952992">You may be onto something.........I&#39;m not sure.  I think what I need to do is read up some more on Aspergers Sydrome, because she has a LOT of those traits.  And well we already know she has Sensory Processing Disorder.  Everything I have read about SPD tells me these kids have a really hard time with social skills.........and oh, so many other issues......too many to mention.  But the SPD is a neurological issue.  I have to put it all in perspective.  It&#39;s not her fault, and she&#39;s not doing it on purpose.  She REALLY can not help a lot of these behaviors.  And she does get easily frustrated, so you are right I need to acknowledge that.<br/>

has a LOT of those traits. <br/>
<br/>
This is what I used to think as well.  I thought if I just kept <br/>
reading, I might find something to help my dd.  Well, the more I <br/>
read, the worse things got and the more despair I felt.  Once I <br/>
decided to stop all the reading about disorders and really <br/>
concentrate on thinking loving thoughts when I looked at my <br/>
daughter, I felt so much better about everything.  No, behavior did <br/>
not change right away, but we felt more relaxed and behavior has <br/>
changed a lot over the past several years.  It has been a very <br/>
gradual maturing process, and my 11yo dd still has a hard time with <br/>
impulse control and negative thinking, but it is oh so much better <br/>
than when she was 6 & 7.<br/>
<br/>
I have read a lot of posts from other people who have had the same <br/>
experience.  I am not nearly as evolved in my relationship with my <br/>
daughters as a lot of other people or as I wish I were, but I am <br/>
doing better all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
*And I still don&#39;t even take a shower unless my younger daughter is <br/>
settled in my bed, watching something and ready to sleep:)  At least <br/>
not while my dh is gone, which he is right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270610182">Hey,<br/>
I have two kids on the spectrum, both with SPD, auditory processing  <br/>
disorder, one has verbal apraxia, so I know the problems you are  <br/>
talking about. However, I have to agree with Kelly when she said that  <br/>
you have to be with them all the time. When Bre was little, we never  <br/>
left her alone with anyone, because we never KNEW for certain that it  <br/>
was safe. She sat in the bathroom and played with toys, or eat  <br/>
snacks, or shower with me. Or I didn&#39;t bath until a friend or dh  <br/>
could be in the house to watch her.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that she&#39;s not doing it on purpose is helpful to *your*  <br/>
brain, but doesn&#39;t help other people. She may not at this point be  <br/>
able to help herself, but it&#39;s your job to help her help herself.  <br/>
You&#39;re her translator, mediator, and close companion until she does  <br/>
get it. And it does happen, it takes longer, and it takes a lot of  <br/>
intensive time on your part. I wanted to emphasize what someone said  <br/>
when they said you have to catch her meltdowns before they happen,  <br/>
and walk her through more appropriate stages. At this point, she has  <br/>
ingrained so many bad reactions that it is second nature for her, and  <br/>
it&#39;ll seem much more intense for a while. But soon you&#39;ll start to be  <br/>
able to trust her for five minutes, or ten, or even an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Having SPD means that things are really intense for her, and I&#39;d  <br/>
suggest lots of opportunity for activity, lots of full body activity  <br/>
like jumping on the tramp, swinging, climbing, riding a bike, and  <br/>
lots of fine motor play with playdough, clay, origami, bubbles. Not  <br/>
only does it help get rid of the nervous energy created by the  <br/>
constant onslaught of input, it also helps the nervous system mature.  <br/>
SInetwork.org is a great website if you need ideas or maybe a  <br/>
consultation with an OT, sometimes just getting ideas is worth it.<br/>

&gt; Processing Disorder. Everything I have read about SPD tells me  <br/>
&gt; these kids have a really hard time with social skills.........and  <br/>
&gt; oh, so many other issues......too many to mention. But the SPD is a  <br/>
&gt; neurological issue. I have to put it all in perspective. It&#39;s not  <br/>
&gt; her fault, and she&#39;s not doing it on purpose. She REALLY can not  <br/>
&gt; help a lot of these behaviors. And she does get easily frustrated,  <br/>
&gt; so you are right I need to acknowledge that.<br/>
