<div id="ygrps-yiv-658051913">18 months ago I left full-time work.  7 months ago we started home-schooling.  6 months ago we discovered un-schooling.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, ages 8 and 11, love it.  My oldest has had a harder time with de-schooling, but I think she is getting over the hump.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s business is struggling and I may need to go back to work full-time.  If I can get good pay, then he can stay home with the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I am learning so much about myself by staying home with this kids and I would miss them terribly if I get a job.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need any advice right now, just emotional support - encouragement and understanding - and maybe a few stories of how folks have worked through this themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I will take a deep breath right now and believe that everything will work out for our family.  Today is perfect and tomorrow will be too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Almost two years ago George hurt his shoulder badly enough to have to let go his sawmilling business and I went to work full time. He&#39;s been home with the kids ever since. Its been a change, that&#39;s for sure. While I&#39;d rather be home, I&#39;m glad to know that I&#39;m able to take care of the people I love in this way - that means a lot to me. <br/>

Is she settling in? That&#39;s good. Maybe she&#39;s just needed time to wrap her mind around this crazy new idea ;)<br/>
