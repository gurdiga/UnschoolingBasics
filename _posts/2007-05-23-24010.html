<div id="ygrps-yiv-497292518">Since I did post about my 13 yo ds telling me that he thinks he&#39;s not very intelligent, I decided to share some recent great things, too.  This same person, just last night, came in the kitchen at 10:00pm, just when I was getting ready to take the other kids upstairs to bed.  He wanted to learn to make chili.  He had asked me to get hamburger and so we were sorta ready.  He didn&#39;t want a recipe, just wanted to fly...had to adapt to whatever we had. By 11:00 pm we were all eating his first (delicious) attempt at chili!  He seems so amazing to me.  A few nights ago, I went outside with the 7 and 10 yo kids to collect hotwheels cars left outside.  Then they asked me to stay outside and play (it was dark) and they made a whole town, digging roads with a hoe, then took photos from up above and right on the ground with the digital camera.  &quot;See how real it looks!  See how the flash makes it look like daytime!  See how the lower you hold the camera the more 3-D it looks!&quot;   (see<br/>
 how mom&#39;s heart swells with happiness) I am glad my son would tell me he doubts his intelligence, I just felt sad about it too.  Thanks! Cameron <br/>
