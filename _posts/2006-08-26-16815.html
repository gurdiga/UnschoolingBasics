<div id="ygrps-yiv-417726151">&quot;this child is seven!  Backwards letters and poor spelling are very<br/>
common in young children. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly!!<br/>
Looking for a label and &quot;disablity&quot; in a 7y.o. child is NOT going to<br/>
help unschooling blossom. It&#39;s VERY normal for young children to<br/>
reverse letters. All of mine have done that so far, and not one of<br/>
them has had any problem at 13years of age. 13 seems to be the magic<br/>
age for my boys.....Sierra is catching on a little bit earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Letter reversal and poor handwriting is so normal and common. Heck, I<br/>
have terrible handwriting (I should have been a doctor I guess;) but I<br/>
can formulate an article and communicate ideas just fine (on a good<br/>
day anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Children need TIME. Time and development and help feeling comfortable<br/>
with exactly where they are at this very moment, with no comparisons<br/>
to other children. THAT is the most helpful remedy for writing problems.<br/>
Not all of us are meant to be writers anyway. I think I&#39;m going to<br/>
start labeling people with hang-ups about drawing and painting. I&#39;ll<br/>
call it dysartsia. I&#39;ll formulate a curriculum and therapy to help<br/>
people that are stuck creatively. I bet I can make millions teaching<br/>
people how to label their children &quot;dysartsic&quot; and convince them that<br/>
it&#39;s a  horrible disability. What a shame.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;ll call it IMAGINATION TRIBE!! Tadah.:))<br/>

It&#39;s so cool when you wait and let writing unfold naturally and you get to<br/>
be witness to it.  Just this summer my almost ten year old found a reason to<br/>
write neatly (pen pals and pony club) and it&#39;s amazing how far she has come.<br/>
She stopped writing in all capital letters, began punctuating more, and made<br/>
great strides in neatness.  I never made an issue out of her writing even<br/>
though when she was seven she wrote in all capitals and it was messy and it<br/>
wasn&#39;t punctuated correctly.  Her spelling has also come naturally and I&#39;m<br/>
still amazed at how well both my girls spell without ever having a spelling<br/>
list or test.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some of the fun things she has done in the last few years include getting<br/>
her own email account, dictating and writing a TON of stories, getting<br/>
penpals (of which she has six now), spent a lot of time using Microsoft word<br/>
and making forms and letters, writing in notebooks (I buy tons at the school<br/>
sales for cheap and let them have at them). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Up until recently she always typed letters to pen pals.  Her penpals kept<br/>
writing back in long hand and it was much neater than her writing and it<br/>
gave her the incentive to try to write more neatly.  The last couple letters<br/>
to pen pals were written in long hand and I didn&#39;t even recognize the<br/>
writing, it was so neat.  :-)<br/>
