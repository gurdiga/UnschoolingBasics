<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551033756">I saw this post and thought I&#39;d chime in with something that happend in our home on Monday.  I&#39;ve been trying to teach myself to knit, and my 13 yr old dd crochets quite well and frequently.  My 10 yr old ds decided he&#39;d like to try to crochet and wanted to get his own needle and yarn this past weekend.  He had a great time picking out just the right color from all those neat looking balls of yarn!<br/>
   <br/>
  Let me just put in here before I begin relating this incident that my dh at one time would have been horrified to find his son crochetting/knitting.  I&#39;ve been telling him all I&#39;m learning about unschooling and letting the kids live and learn the way they need too.  I&#39;m never sure what he&#39;s taking in and what he&#39;s actually letting in one ear and out the other. On to my story.......<br/>
   <br/>
  Monday morning my 12 yr old son went hunting with his dad.  He shot a deer, and was very proud to say the least.  He came home and they done all the things that needed to be done to skin and clean the deer.  This took quite some time, and the other kids just sort of came in and out of the garage taking part or just watching at different times.  At one point, dh asks....Where&#39;s Josh?  (my 10 yr old son) I replied, not knowing how he was going to react, &quot;He decided he wanted to learn to crochet and is on the couch working at it.&quot;  I was very thrilled with his reply of.....&quot;good for him.  Sticking to something he wants to do.&quot;   Then sort of as an afterthought he says...&quot;It used to be very common for men and boys to crochet or knit their own hats, scarves, or socks.&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  This might not mean much to many but when you&#39;re trying to lead them gently into an unschooling way of thinking, then this was a huge &quot;YAHOO&quot; for me!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for reading.  I know that not everyone on here are pro-hunting.  I don&#39;t mean to start a raging discussion on hunting, just needed to use that to help make my story clear.  <br/>
