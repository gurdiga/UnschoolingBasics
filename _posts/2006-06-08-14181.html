<div id="ygrps-yiv-382087124">Hello everybody<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;d like to apologize for my rusty English and awkward <br/>
sentences ... English is not my first language. I&#39;ve learned it ... <br/>
at school ;), in books and also a bit at work - but it was in some <br/>
forgotten geological age !<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a mother of three (5yo, 3yo and ... 1/2 yo), living in Geneva <br/>
and ready, after zillion of sleepless nights thinking hard about it, <br/>
tons of reading on the subject and countless discussions with <br/>
friends, to unschool my 5yo son. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that it is very difficult here to UNschool. You can <br/>
HOMEschool if you like, providing you get the authorization, but you <br/>
have to follow the curriculum and people come to check if you do it <br/>
properly. I&#39;m quite desperate about it, as I&#39;m deeply convinced by <br/>
the benefits and the good sense of unschooling ... (When you say <br/>
that humans are natural learners, I would add that all living beings <br/>
are so - even bacteria learn how to resist ...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I read with very much interest and enthusiasm, and I&#39;d like <br/>
to thank you all for this yummi food for thought<br/>
<br/>

unschoolers in your area and how they have dealt with this<br/>
requirement?  Are there other ways in which you could homeschool that<br/>
maybe aren&#39;t publicized as much?  I&#39;d go google but, um I only speak<br/>
English and don&#39;t read &quot;Swiss&quot; at all (Isn&#39;t Switzerland sort of a<br/>
combination of French,  Greman and Italian because of its local?)<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d hunt for local unschoolers and see how they have managed<br/>
the curriculum or found other choices.<br/>

Most of us are in the US, but we have state differences here rather<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651871341">Thanks for the welcoming !<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to contact some unschooling families here in Geneva, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to find them ... There must be 3 of them (there is a <br/>
researcher at our University who wrote his ... what&#39;s the word ... <br/>
the thing you write to obtain your degree ... about homeschooler and <br/>
he really had a hard time finding any of them).<br/>
<br/>
I have to ask for authorization if I want to keep my children at <br/>
home, it is the law. I really don&#39;t know how I will manage to truly <br/>
unschool while making believe to authorities that I homeschool, <br/>
though I&#39;m quite sure I&#39;ll find a way (making friendly with the <br/>
inspector and trying to show him the benefits of it ????)<br/>

PS about Switzerland : we have 26 different states, with different <br/>
laws - probably a bit like US, some laws are federal laws, some vary <br/>
from one state to another, and 4 different languages : German, <br/>
French, Italian and Rumantsch (in order of importance, ie of people <br/>
speaking them). <br/>

googled it in your own language you would find better hits, but it is<br/>
a start.  I&#39;m presuming if there are this many on this one website<br/>
there have to be other homeschoolers as well.  Oh and the word is<br/>
dissertation or thesis.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may depend on what you are wearing when you answer the door ;-)<br/>
Seriously I would try to find other home/unschoolers that are in the<br/>
same restrictions as you are in and find out how they are doing.<br/>
Maybe find out who the inspector is for your area and ask him/her<br/>
(because you want to make sure that you comply with the law correctly)<br/>
what s/he is looking for when doing an inspection and how often these<br/>
inspections would occur.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the information.  26 states in such a small country!  I&#39;m<br/>
always amazed when I look at a porportionally correct map and see how<br/>
small some countries are in comparison to the US.  Maybe we would have<br/>
fewer problems if we weren&#39;t so huge.  :)<br/>
