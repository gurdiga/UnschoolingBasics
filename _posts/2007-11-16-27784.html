<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380666969">All, I&#39;m shaking mad. Please, can I have some advice? I can&#39;t think evenly  <br/>
now. I need help. This is from my daughter&#39;s father - Grace is 15 now. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I have been thinking about your home school and my concern is your  ability <br/>
to educate Grace consistently and over a long period of time.   So, I met with <br/>
a lawyer, talked to a judge, and completed the  paperwork.  Based on the <br/>
history she would be ordered back to  CHS, but I&#39;m not sure that is the solution.  <br/>
You told  me you would send proof of her work on a regular basis.  I need  <br/>
that proof and an expectation of how often. My hope is that you can  make this <br/>
happen, if not I will have to file.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance. Going shopping now...be back later. I&#39;m so  upset...<br/>
 <br/>
Karen <br/>

School At Home, with homework (?) grades, the whole spiel.  Grace  herself is <br/>
not ready for Unschooling, so we have been sampling things here and  there to <br/>

still feels &quot;book stupid.&quot; I am doing what I can to rid that of her by  allowing <br/>
her to...actually, providing, her with, a smattering of things to try  and <br/>

BIG BREATH. Thank you. I feel like I get lost in the shuffle on these yahoo  <br/>

 and unsteady - especially when it comes to him.. Thank you SO much! <br/>

You&#39;re doing something that he can&#39;t trust. He&#39;s asked for some help  <br/>

You can&#39;t imbue him with an understanding of unschooling. But you can  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632972807">To Joyce<br/>
<br/>
Your post is absolutely amazingly awesome! As I was reading it I was immensely soothed even though my own trepidation with the subject is only second hand and indirect.<br/>
<br/>
You managed to put into words the most loving and respecting attitude I&#39;ve come across in a long time. A real PeaceMaker post.<br/>
<br/>
Karen, if you can get to this position yourself you will know exactly what to do to soothe him into trusting that all is well with Grace and your unschooling path. Part of it is soothing your own doubts. That is what we share on this list. <br/>
<br/>
When you give him &#39;reports&#39; make sure that they come from an inner stance of power, from wanting to share the wonderful good fortune of which your heart is so full that you just have to tell it to the world not from a stance of protection and defensiveness. <br/>
<br/>
Our children are extraordinary people who created us and our willingnes to unschool with them so that they may grow into who they really are unlimited by mediocre control systems.<br/>
<br/>
You said that you&#39;ve been unschooling/deschooling for 3 weeks only. Reconvalesence from some diseases takes much longer than that. If she feels more secure in doing some schooly things, then why not provide that to her? Just because we unschool does not mean that we can&#39;t immerse ourselves into subjects that sound schooly. Ah, and real learning happens so much without books, too.<br/>

______________________<br/>
for the most part, I agree with you. He is also, however, a super  <br/>
controlling person. Rules, chores, punishments, MAKE her do stuff, all of that  <br/>
conventional route with the added control issues. <br/>
 <br/>
I know he loves her deeply. But I also know that thee is a LOT of this that  <br/>
stems from his continued bitterness over our divorce and his anger towards me. <br/>
 We SEEM to be reaching some understanding now at least...after 15 years of  <br/>
separation and 12 of divorce and a new marriage for each of us...and still the <br/>
 bitterness overflows at times. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Joyce<br/>
True. Right now, we have agreed that we will email weekly summaries of what  <br/>
we&#39;ve been up to, and she brings her books and workbooks and all that jazz <br/>
with  her when she goes to visit. I handed him the folder with everything in it <br/>
this  morning at the drop off. I hope it helps. I reminded him that this is a <br/>
slow,  but steady progression forward, and that helping to show Grace that she <br/>
is NOT  stupid (something she believes to be true right now due to her school  <br/>
performance) is my first priority, and that means easing her into things like <br/>
 reading and writing - big challenges for her. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope he is ok with this. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s Punny - I use blogspot :) Blogger.com is the form I&#39;m most familiar<br/>
with, it was pretty easy to set up and I find it incredibly user friendly<br/>
(moreso after I figgered out some HTML, just fine before then, too ::g::).<br/>
You can check out mine, though it&#39;s not as focused as the one you&#39;d want to<br/>
make for XDH, it should be easier for you to envision the kinds of<br/>
*snapshots* of your life together you&#39;d like to share (plenty of links on<br/>
the side to other unschoolers&#39; blogs, too). Enlist Grace&#39;s help, if she&#39;d<br/>
like, that communal task alone covers several topics (current events,<br/>
keyboarding, computer programming, photography, graphic design,<br/>
english/reading/composition/spelling, to begin...). Be sure she knows you&#39;re<br/>
going to bat for her, doing what you can to protect her from the (seeming)<br/>
scorn that&#39;s hiding something far more pleasant (concern/love). Once she<br/>
realizes you&#39;re on her team and really believes it, life will be much<br/>
smoother than it is today.<br/>
Have you seen Accepted? In the film (which is hilarious) the (invented)<br/>
school&#39;s curriculum is a gigantic whiteboard with any and everything that<br/>
anyone there wants to know more about. Maybe putting one up and<br/>
brainstorming over the next, oh, 10 years or so ;) and just listing whatever<br/>
tickles her fancy (or you put up anything you think *may* tickle her fancy)<br/>
you&#39;ll end up with a map of sorts of where to go from here (as far as<br/>
*doing*). That original list is easily adapted to the *curriculum speak* at<br/>
the previous link.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, don&#39;t forget to breathe ::::vbg::::<br/>
