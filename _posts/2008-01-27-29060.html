<br/>
I need your perspective.<br/>
<br/>
This is our scenario:  DW has been working all day to stay connected with<br/>
dd2 (4.75), who is hitting her sister, throwing things, and spitting in DW&#39;s<br/>
face.  Add to this at dinner, DW&#39;s mom comes over and talks to us about kids<br/>
needing to respect their parents.  Enter frustration, anger, and<br/>
discouragement.  And this kind of stuff has been happening a bit more often<br/>
than we&#39;d like (esp. the &quot;concerned mother&quot; bit).  Understandably, DW is<br/>
about to strangle someone or something at the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my question.  If this were you, what things could your DH do to<br/>
help encourage you?  What could he do to really help you feel good about the<br/>
decision to parent the way you do?  Despite the really rough days, and<br/>
despite when they seem to occur close together?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559918075">Wow, that sounds like a really rough patch.  I promise not to whine about anything at all (for a few days anyway!).<br/>
   <br/>
  Could dw&#39;s mother *not* come over for awhile??<br/>
   <br/>
  I love that you&#39;re asking the question about how best to support your wife.  I don&#39;t have much experience here yet so I&#39;m going to let the experienced ones reply and look forward to the suggestions along with you...then pass them on to my dh!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What an amazing question to ask!  Do you have any brothers?  (Just kidding!)<br/>
<br/>
Rob, the thing that I have always needed and craved most of all from <br/>
my husband when things were going rough for me has been simply his <br/>
loving support in the form of empathic, reflexive listening.  He <br/>
tends to want to fix things and tell me what I should do, but unless <br/>
I&#39;ve specifically asked what he thinks I should do, I don&#39;t want or <br/>
need someone fixing my life.  *I* can fix my life.  What I need is <br/>
someone who loves me, who hears that I&#39;m in pain, and holds a loving <br/>
space for me to get through my rough feelings.  He&#39;ll listen, and the <br/>
feedback I most want is, &quot;Wow! That sounds really hard!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After she&#39;s gotten through the roughest of her feelings, you might <br/>
also *offer* to brainstorm ideas with her for dealing with her mom <br/>
and ways your wife can hold it together while your daughter is going <br/>
through *her* rough patches.  Does your wife post here?  (That could <br/>
be one of the ideas.)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that you probably already do this, but picking up some <br/>
of her responsibilities would probably also help tremendously (i.e., <br/>
getting dinner together or hanging with the kids while your wife goes <br/>
off and replenishes herself).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little.  That&#39;s a very loving question to ask!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I forgot something:  You have to be careful when you&#39;re doing this, <br/>
because you it&#39;s important to honor your wife&#39;s feelings*, but to the <br/>
extent that you do that, you might also gently show her where she&#39;s <br/>
being effective and successful.  I&#39;m not saying that you should <br/>
praise her or anything like that, but noticing her successes can be <br/>
very encouraging, especially if she&#39;s feeling down on her parenting ability.<br/>
<br/>
*By this, I don&#39;t mean agreeing with her when she says something <br/>
like, &quot;I suck at this!&quot;  But you can hold her and say, &quot;Those are <br/>
such rough feelings to have!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One more thing:  Ask her what she needs from you.  She may have very <br/>
specific ways in mind that you can support her.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  One last thing, I swear!  &lt;bwg&gt;  She might benefit greatly <br/>
from having a session or sessions with a parenting coach, like Scott <br/>
Noelle.  See if this might be a fit for your family:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949190449">Hi Rob for me what helps is when I am having a bad moment and I am ready to explode I call DH and he comes to the house ( we farm so he is just outside) and is very calm and non judgmental towards me or the kids. He also listens well.<br/>
  He just comes in and plays with the kids and tries to figure out what we all need. Me time to cool down, the kids someone calm to be there for them.<br/>
  So I guess you could be that person for her. Don&#39;t try to fix things , be the calm that sweeps in and takes over the kids so everyone has a moment to calm down.<br/>
  Later you can talk about it if that helps.<br/>
  As for the MIL  I don&#39;t know. Sometimes if my DH has a doubt I just try to put him in the kids shoe so he can see with their little eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8077622">Hey,that IS me! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
What my dh does is come home every day, and take over for an hour or  <br/>
so. Just having that time to look forward to keeps me strong in the  <br/>
face of anything. I have one day a week that I just leave the house,  <br/>
and he takes over. Everyone loves it...the kids get time with just  <br/>
dad, I get time alone, and dad gets some time to just be with the  <br/>
kids. Its just as hard for him to be gone away from them all day, as  <br/>
it is for me to be on nonstop.<br/>

im going to add to this though im not a &quot;lady&quot;... actually i dont  <br/>

and for her to know when not to say anything. So not try to find  <br/>

will ask a few questions which will allow me to step back and examine  <br/>
what is happening.<br/>

I think for me it works best when she is there to support, listen but  <br/>
also trust that i can work it out... so she does not try to &quot;save the  <br/>

its interesting for me though because when the tables are turned and  <br/>
she relates how she had a stressful day with the kids i start  <br/>
spurting out things ive read and ideas to make it better, i also tend  <br/>
to do my (as she calls it) &quot;pseudo pop psychology&quot; to try to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556974734">Yes, Arun is right. Listening and validating  are essential. When you try to fix it makes her think she was wrong and if she was she needs no reminder at he moment.<br/>
  Listen, validate, but I think very important for you to model when you interact with your children. <br/>
  Model to her , she Will pick up tool on her own form that. And if she asks then you can have a discussion on it in a moment of peace.<br/>
  I hope I am explaining it well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728893048">I can&#39;t really give a lot of advice since I WOH fulltime and DH is at<br/>
home with DS (9 1/2) - very different dynamic there. But, I just wanted<br/>
to second (or third) both kudos to you for even ASKING how to help as<br/>
well as the reminder to not try to just &#39;fix&#39; the situation without<br/>
first providing some listening and empathy. A couple things to throw on<br/>
the table once you get to the &quot;okay, how do WE deal with this?&quot; (the We<br/>
part is important)<br/>
- let &quot;Mom&quot; know that she&#39;s welcome to come over for dinner on Thursdays<br/>
(or Mondays and Wednesdays or whatever you choose) but that you&#39;d like<br/>
to have dinners be just family times the rest of the week (maybe even<br/>
quote all those &quot;the family who eats dinner together...&quot; public service<br/>
commercials. That you appreciate her concern but what would really help<br/>
most is for you and DW to have some uninterrupted time with the girls.<br/>
- give your DW some space regularly to have a soak int he tub or<br/>
whatever she finds refreshing - maybe even something like a<br/>
stitch&#39;n&#39;bitch group at the local Starbucks or a yoga class at the<br/>
community center. Whatever it is that helps her feel refreshed and<br/>
renewed and re-centered.<br/>
- do a bit of an &quot;autonomy&quot; inventory regarding your little one. That<br/>
age can be particularly rough in general and particularly if the child<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel heard or allowed to be more autonomous. Things like being<br/>
able to get her own juice, snacks, etc may seem like small things but go<br/>
a long way toward getting through this age. Include in the discussion<br/>
things like when is the negative behavior (hitting, throwing, spitting)<br/>
most likely to occur - tired? hungry? hurried? etc I know that if I try<br/>
to hurry DS, he can dig in and find any number of ways to make things<br/>
&quot;difficult&quot; because he&#39;s feeling pressured. Or, if we overstay someplace<br/>
that he&#39;s reluctant to be in the first place - for instance, FIL has<br/>
been hospitalized for the last two months and, while DH goes to visit on<br/>
his own, there are times when he&#39;d like to have me with him - which<br/>
means bringing DS along as well. If we stay at the hospital more than<br/>
about an hour, despite a bag full of things (handheld videogames, puzzle<br/>
books, snacks, sketchpad, etc - all things DS chooses to bring), DS gets<br/>
more and more in my face (and DH&#39;s - and I mean literally as in putting<br/>
his hands over my eyes or poking my neck with his finger repeatedly) to<br/>
make it clear &quot;We need to leave&quot; rather than simply saying &quot;Can we<br/>
leave?&quot; he expresses his frustration physically. [PS yes, we have cut<br/>
back the number of times and duration that DS is at the hospital and<br/>
we&#39;re trying to figure out some sort of child care arrangement - but<br/>
this is going to be long term, possibly for the rest of FIL&#39;s life, that<br/>
he&#39;ll be in some sort of caregiving institution so there&#39;s a bit of<br/>
complication there]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910565225">Hi Rob,    <br/>
Forgive me, but I do not understand all the abbreviations....  Anyway, sounds like a day at my house!!  If DH refers to husband then he usually is good at &quot;words of affirmation&quot;, to me regarding my parenting and lets me know that I am doing a great job.  He realizes this isn&#39;t an easy task 24/7.  He will go and have a talk with them and give me some time to breath.  My kids are older 9, 8, 6, and 20 mo.  We tend to have to revisit the same issues daily.  As long as you and your wife are on the same page with parenting, disciplining issues, and the like, and be consistent with follow through on things then hopefully you will be gracious to her if she phones you during the day for encouragement or to vent to you.  That always helps in my situation.    <br/>
You need communication and compassion between each other, and turn your family into the &quot;Saxon Team&quot;.  Have a family meeting  and discuss the &quot;team motto&quot; and what team work means.  Let your kids see they are part of the family, their importance to the team, &quot;The Saxon Team&quot;, and your family.  This helps them to see again their value and position they hold thus, they will hopefully be more likely to &quot;follow the rules&quot;, respect the &#39;team leaders&quot;, DH, DW, and have more responsibilities especially during those times  when DW needs to have one on one time with another team member.  Give rewards where needed, not bribery or they will expect it in order to get what YOU want.  You can even make a tee-shirt with your own family team name on it, a wall mounted Team motto and what you stand for.  Something tangible to see to remind you you are all part of this endeavor together in the good and bad.  Positive words of affirmation to the hurting one is key, and offering to help by &quot;their&quot; direction is also key.  Don&#39;t try to &quot;fix it&quot;, DW just wants you to listen #1, and then go on her lead as to what you can do to help.  Yelling, getting angry are no no&#39;s.  Work together to solve the issue.  It also works both ways if the shoe happens to be on the other foot.  Just be careful not to condemn the caregiver and unload about the day you have had, know what I mean?  It only makes it worse.<br/>
    <br/>
 We try this as well, it works if there is consistancy,<br/>
        <br/>
best to you<br/>

  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] What kind of support from DH?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  RU Ladies,<br/>
<br/>
  I need your perspective.<br/>
<br/>
  This is our scenario: DW has been working all day to stay connected with<br/>
  dd2 (4.75), who is hitting her sister, throwing things, and spitting in DW&#39;s<br/>
  face. Add to this at dinner, DW&#39;s mom comes over and talks to us about kids<br/>
  needing to respect their parents. Enter frustration, anger, and<br/>
  discouragement. And this kind of stuff has been happening a bit more often<br/>
  than we&#39;d like (esp. the &quot;concerned mother&quot; bit). Understandably, DW is<br/>
  about to strangle someone or something at the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
  So here&#39;s my question. If this were you, what things could your DH do to<br/>
  help encourage you? What could he do to really help you feel good about the<br/>
  decision to parent the way you do? Despite the really rough days, and<br/>
  despite when they seem to occur close together?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for your time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205830358">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your responses!  I&#39;ve been loaned out to another department<br/>
and trying to get my feet under me, ergo no response for a couple of days...<br/>
<br/>
Seana and I read through these posts, and found them most helpful.<br/>
Definitely, encouragement that we&#39;re doing the right thing, esp. when she&#39;s<br/>
feeling overwhelmed is the biggest thing for her.  I have an aversion to<br/>
fixing something for someone else unless they ask for it, but that led me to<br/>
mostly not saying much of anything at all.  And I could see her straining<br/>
under the pressure.  My encouragement to her really seems to be what she<br/>
needs for both the kids AND for her mother.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thanks for coming through!  Now it&#39;s bck to work..<br/>
