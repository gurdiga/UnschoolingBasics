<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598208468">Just in case some of you aren&#39;t at the Liveandlearnconference list,<br/>
thought I&#39;d post this here too.<br/>

<br/>
One of the funshops is an ATC trade. That means you need to be making<br/>
your ATC&#39;s NOW, because we&#39;ll all be getting together for a trade at<br/>
the conference. If you are interested in learning more about ATC&#39;s<br/>
(Art Trading Cards), visit this website:<br/>
