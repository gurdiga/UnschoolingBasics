<div id="ygrps-yiv-545155004">Hi Everyone,<br/>
Just wanted to pass on a quick note.<br/>
We cleaned out my Dad&#39;s storage locker this week and found an old<br/>
typewriter.  A good quality one (Remington) that probably works the way it<br/>
did the day it was bought.  It has brought HOURS of fun to my 3 kids, 2, 4<br/>
and 6.  Its hilarious to just sit and watch and listen, it&#39;s amazing what<br/>
they figure out!  I never would have thought of putting it out for them if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t read his books......<br/>
