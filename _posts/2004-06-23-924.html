<div id="ygrps-yiv-377876419">Ok,<br/>
I am new at this unschooling journey, so please be patient with my<br/>
questions!<br/>
So if an unschooling child decides to take some classes at a community<br/>
college or such, they are NOT unschooling<br/>
anymore?<br/>
What if a child is taking gymnastics, or music or ice skating lessons<br/>
because they want to learn those specific things, are they NOT unschooling<br/>
either?  What is the difference between going to school for one class to<br/>
learn something and taking some sort of lessons?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983777490">I&#39;m not an expert on this subject (yet!) BUT, yes, they are an unschooler if <br/>
they are taking college class&#39;s of THEIR choice and because they want to.  And <br/>
as far as the other class&#39;s you mentioned, music, gymnastics and such, yes, <br/>
they are still unschoolers, as far as the child is taking them because they <br/>
want to.<br/>

&quot;...since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out <br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to <br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

can call what they do?<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of discussing what is and isn&#39;t unschooling is to help people<br/>
get a better grasp of what unschooling is. Once someone does grasp<br/>
unschooling, then they can decide for themselves where they&#39;ll draw the line<br/>
at the edge and whether they will classify kids taking community college<br/>
classes as unschooling or not. I could probably give a good argument either<br/>
way ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to some people to discuss the fringes to see the arguments<br/>
people make for how to classify something. To other people it&#39;s just<br/>
confusing.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s confusing to you, don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Somehow by the time my kids were taking college level courses, I <br/>
stopped caring if this or that &quot;is unschooling.&quot; I mean - I don&#39;t care <br/>
if they are or are not unschooling, they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
The point of talking about unschooling is to talk about how people <br/>
learn without schooling.<br/>
<br/>
So if my kid is taking a college class, it isn&#39;t particularly useful to <br/>
an unschooling list to talk about how well written the syllabus is, how <br/>
organized the teacher is, how well the textbook cuts up the subject <br/>
into little increments, and what kind of exams the teacher designs. <br/>
NONE of that is about unschooling - it is all about schooling.<br/>
<br/>
When unschooled kids do take college classes, they frequently stand out <br/>
for their passion for learning, their desire to understand the subject <br/>
matter and not just figure out what the teacher is going to put on the <br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are different - they&#39;re not just like other young college <br/>
students. I&#39;m comfortable with just saying they were unschooling and <br/>
now they&#39;re taking college classes.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think focusing on &quot;who&quot; is or isn&#39;t an unschooler is <br/>
particularly useful - what is useful is focusing on how kids can learn <br/>
without schooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are nuances that are worth talking about, though, in the context <br/>
of an unschooling discussion - for example I also see it as really <br/>
different when a kid chooses to take a class or study something in a <br/>
formal way versus when a parent decides a kid needs to be taught <br/>
something in a formal way. The child&#39;s experience is going to be very <br/>
different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234795716">I agree that Unschooling is not school, but my perspective on it is a<br/>
little different than what I&#39;ve heard so I guess I&#39;ll put my two cents in.<br/>
    My daughter is public schooled.  I don&#39;t like it, but she is.  We do<br/>
however take a very Unschool like approach to the rest of her life and those<br/>
of her younger brothers who are and will be exclusively Unschooled.  We<br/>
could care less about grades, homework, bedtime schedules etc...  She&#39;s her<br/>
own individual; blue hair, different color socks, a clothing style like no<br/>
one else in her class.  Is she exclusively Unschooled; No, but her life is<br/>
so much better than it ever could be if she was strictly public schooled.<br/>
    Am I making any sense?  Someone, can&#39;t recall who, was making it sound<br/>
so cut and dry, but it isn&#39;t because everybody is different.  We are making<br/>
due with the situation we have been handed in the best way we can.  I guess<br/>
we see Unschooling as more of a lifestyle choice than an academic choice.<br/>
I&#39;m not TEACHING my kids using an Unschooling lifestyle, I&#39;m allowing them<br/>
to live their life and make their own choices, my public school child is<br/>
included in that.  Maybe there should be a name for people like her - she&#39;s<br/>
truly the greatest person I have ever known.   Any ideas?<br/>

and see the difference. It was as if she was from another planet. <br/>
There were a few homeschooled kids in some of our classes, but they <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to have the same passion for learning that she had. They <br/>
appeared to be tired of being taught just like the kids from ps and <br/>
saw college as more of the same. <br/>

Well, I think it IS cut-and-dry in that, when you&#39;re in school, you ARE  <br/>
schooled.<br/>
 <br/>
But children who are allowed to unschool to the point of *going* to school  <br/>
out of choice ARE different----but they&#39;re not unschooled (because they&#39;re  <br/>
schooled). &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s going with a different mind-set  all-together----and she&#39;s <br/>
learning on her own terms, knowing she can quit at any  time.<br/>

she is.  We make the best of the situation by taking on a totally different<br/>

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been on this list long enough perhaps to know this<br/>
situation.  I&#39;m curious as to what your daughter&#39;s situation is that she has<br/>
to be public schooled?... if you feel like sharing that part...<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to pry so tell me to butt out if you want, but can I ask why  your daughter MUST remain in school? Can&#39;t she just drop out now and be unschooled with the rest of your kids? Of course there might be very personal reasons for this and as I said I dont&#39; mean to intrude, I am just curious to hear you say that being public schooled is not her choice and I am wondering what is limiting that choice for you all?<br/>

  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been on this list long enough perhaps to know this<br/>
  situation.  I&#39;m curious as to what your daughter&#39;s situation is that she<br/>
has<br/>
  to be public schooled?... if you feel like sharing that part...<br/>
<br/>
  In sympathy with what sounds like a crazy situation for you all,<br/>
<br/>
  Joan<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not TEACHING my kids using an Unschooling lifestyle, I&#39;m allowing <br/>

&gt; is<br/>
&gt; included in that.  Maybe there should be a name for people like her - <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; truly the greatest person I have ever known.   Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why I think it is more useful to talk about &quot;unschooling&quot; as <br/>
opposed to &quot;unschoolers.&quot; The point isn&#39;t to get into some club, to get <br/>
a badge that says, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m an UNSCHOOLER.&quot; The point is to talk about <br/>
learning - and most particularly about how kids can live great <br/>
wonderful full rich childhoods without going to school and grow up and <br/>
live great wonderful (hey, even rich, if that&#39;s what they want) <br/>
adulthoods, too.<br/>
<br/>
So - my answer to you, AnnMarie, specifically is: I wouldn&#39;t consider <br/>
her &quot;an unschooler,&quot; I think my kids might (and maybe they &quot;get it&quot; <br/>
better since they are living breathing real unschoolers and I&#39;m just a <br/>
mom who let it happen), but she&#39;s enjoying the benefits of your <br/>
understanding of unschooling, so that&#39;s great and what difference does <br/>
it make what it is called? Heck, how kids can live a good life with <br/>
being stuck IN school might even be one of the most significant <br/>
outcomes of learning about unschooling. Grace Llewelyn&#39;s newest book - <br/>
Guerilla Schooling - is about that and so is some of Linda Dobson&#39;s <br/>
book, &quot;What the Rest of Us Can Learn.....&quot; (Sorry - don&#39;t have access <br/>
to the exact titles right now.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See - I gave up long ago. I don&#39;t try to define my own kids - what they <br/>
&quot;are.&quot; Too hard to keep track of - they change.<br/>
<br/>
Roya (19) has been taking a full load of academic college courses - she <br/>
does nothing but go to class and study - this is summer school - an 18 <br/>
week semester condensed to 4 weeks. She&#39;s bleary-eyed and sick of it - <br/>
at the end of the third week.<br/>
<br/>
But she considers herself a radical unschooler - LOVES unschooling - is <br/>
an unschooling activist. She intends to spend her life promoting <br/>
unschooling - sees it as a major part of her life&#39;s work - her mission <br/>
in life.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to some people&#39;s opinions &lt;G&gt; - I&#39;m modest about my own <br/>
understanding of unschooling. My kids have surpassed me because they <br/>
didn&#39;t start with my long years of indoctrination - they came into it <br/>
unhandicapped, like I was, by having fully bought into the educational <br/>
system. My understanding of unschooling is still &quot;self-conscious&quot; and <br/>
always will be - theirs is absolutely natural and normal and accepting. <br/>
  I have to think hard about it to &#39;get it&#39; - they  &quot;know it when they <br/>
see it&quot; because they just do.<br/>

<br/>
Ok,<br/>
I am new at this unschooling journey, so please be patient with my<br/>
questions!<br/>
So if an unschooling child decides to take some classes at a community<br/>
college or such, they are NOT unschooling<br/>
anymore?<br/>
What if a child is taking gymnastics, or music or ice skating lessons<br/>
because they want to learn those specific things, are they NOT unschooling<br/>
either?  What is the difference between going to school for one class to<br/>
learn something and taking some sort of lessons?<br/>

<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is unschooling, then what &quot;works&quot; might not be<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For some families what sounds right and what works is to send kids to school<br/>
or to have them do just one page of math from a workbook each day or send<br/>
them to their rooms for misbehavior or making them clean their plates.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants the goal of &quot;what&#39;s right for my family&quot;, they&#39;ll need to<br/>
pick and choose from the ideas here (and elsewhere) to cobble something<br/>
together that&#39;s uniquely their own. If someone wants to give the gift of<br/>
unschooling to their family, then they need more information than doing what<br/>
sounds good.<br/>

Like I have said many times; I don&#39;t consider my daughter to be Unschooled.<br/>
But I wish that every parent thought about public school like I do.  I side<br/>
with her always, never check or even care whether she&#39;s doing her homework,<br/>
grades don&#39;t matter as long as your happy, let her have as many days off as<br/>
she wants, she doesn&#39;t have to attend any school function if it doesn&#39;t<br/>
interest her etc...  She may not have a choice to be in school, but I&#39;ll be<br/>
damned if I&#39;m going to make it hell by imposing a bunch of arbitrary<br/>
expectations on her.  I&#39;m hoping that until her situation changes we can get<br/>
through the public school years with as little &quot;trouble&quot; as possible.<br/>

statistics. She didn&#39;t have much interest in either one of them, <br/>
really, but they were offered during the summer and they fulfill her <br/>
last two requirements for transferring to a university as a junior.<br/>
<br/>
She WANTS to transfer and so these are a means to her own goal.<br/>
<br/>
But - the &quot;schooling&quot; going on the classrooms is so very definitely not <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; - so - there ya go. She&#39;s an unschooler who has a dream <br/>
and wants to fulfill it and part of making her dream come true is to <br/>
take a couple of classes that she&#39;s not that interested in and in doing <br/>
that she is &quot;schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can live with the paradox - I don&#39;t need clean black and white <br/>
answers on this.<br/>
For me the point isn&#39;t whether or not &quot;she is an unschooler.&quot; The point <br/>
is that she&#39;s making her own choices and looking ahead toward how to <br/>
achieve her own goals.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for talking about what is or what isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; is to <br/>
help us all in &quot;getting it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t need help in &quot;getting it.&quot; They live it and aren&#39;t at all <br/>
hung up on what label is attached to them - they simply live a life <br/>
which allows them to learn in every way that works for them and they <br/>
expect that. They are aware that not everybody is as free as they are - <br/>
and they feel bad for those other people. For them it is a matter of <br/>
freedom as well as a matter of being responsible - they don&#39;t see <br/>
schooled kids as being allowed to be either free OR responsible.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure that they are &quot;allowed&quot; 5 absences PER semester -- not <br/>
for the whole school year.  Double check on that, of course.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
My youngest sister goes to the same high school that your DDs are <br/>
attending and believe me.... she&#39;s home fairly often and not always <br/>
with a doctor&#39;s note in hand.  My mom has called her in absent to <br/>
attend something with me and my kids (like going to COSI or something).<br/>
<br/>
Even if you have doctor notes, schools can give you a hassle -- when I <br/>
was a senior there I got pneumonia and was out of school for 3 weeks.  <br/>
I had many notes from my doctor, and did ALL of my homework, and made <br/>
up every test that I had missed, yet they almost didn&#39;t let me graduate <br/>
because I had too many *excused* absences!  D U H<br/>

I think you&#39;ve seen this before, but Sandra&#39;s article &quot;Public School on <br/>

Great idea, but it doesn&#39;t work above the elementary level in our <br/>
district.  Their strict attendance policies start at the Junior High <br/>
level.  :(  A doctor&#39;s note is required for an excused absense.  It&#39;s <br/>
absurd, in my opinion, but what ya&#39; gonna do?<br/>

You&#39;re right.  It is per marking period, I just wasn&#39;t specific <br/>

to mention that two tardies equal an absence, so that makes it even <br/>
trickier.  I just think it&#39;s ridiculous.  If the child is maintaining <br/>
passing grades, does all their work and stays up to speed why the <br/>
heck should it matter?  I know how much time they &quot;waste&quot; so that <br/>
doesn&#39;t help me be any more willing to comply with their program.  <br/>
I&#39;m just a rebel at heart anyway.  What&#39;s a girl to do?  Only one <br/>
more year, and NO MORE children in Roseville Public Schools!  <br/>
YIPPEE!!!<br/>
