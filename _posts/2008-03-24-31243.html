<div id="ygrps-yiv-413615287">I have been trying to figure out how to handle my ds aggression. He is<br/>
5. He will strike first, talk later. This is generally directed at his<br/>
older sister but sometimes towards me or his father. And recently<br/>
towards other children in our homeschool playgroup. What I do is<br/>
usually ask him to stop. This is enough most of the time to get him to<br/>
physically stop and then we can talk. Other times, I physically step<br/>
in an stop him, i.e. hold his arm so that he is physically unable to<br/>
strike the person. I talk to him directly about what is going on. I<br/>
ask him how he is feeling and ask/assess what his needs are/might be.<br/>
If I can I try to facilitate a discussion between the two children to<br/>
work out an agreement. This works pretty well/ But sometimes, I get<br/>
the feeling like this isn&#39;t enough for other parents. I always try to<br/>
be fair and diplomatic.  I allow both children to say their piece and<br/>
come to their own agreement. Occasionally I may offer a suggestion.<br/>
But don&#39;t require the kids to use my suggestion. I think that I am<br/>
being respectful to all parties invovled but I get the feeling that<br/>
some people think I should do more, i.e. punish or time out or<br/>
something.  Is this reasonable or is there something I could be doing<br/>
differently in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Then at home with his sister, I am often unsure how much to step in.<br/>
We try to convey that everyone in our home needs to feel safe. Is is<br/>
disrespectful to my son to physically remove him if he refuses to<br/>
control himself? Like when he is hitting his sister and won&#39;t stop. He<br/>
will occasionally say &quot;blah, blah, blah.&quot; when he doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>
what we have to say, including &quot;stop hitting&quot;. I feel like I try to<br/>
reason with him until he becomes unreasonable. I am just really unsure<br/>
how to be respectful. Would I would like is some outside perspective<br/>
and possible practical ideas to try.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading Raising ourselves raising our children and finding<br/>
that helpful in many ways but not this instant, I still feel confused.<br/>
We have been ap parents from the birth of our first child and have<br/>
always unschooled &quot;educationally&quot; but felt confused and unsure with<br/>
parenting after &quot;pre-school&quot; age. I have always tried to listen to my<br/>
kids and let them be my guide but eventually received so many<br/>
conflicting ideas (some helpful some less than) that I sometimes still<br/>
feel confused. I want to be respectful and loving to me kids AND I<br/>
want them to feel respected and loved. I am not sure that is always<br/>
coming acrossed. I know in part the aggression is coming from the<br/>
birth of his little sister and his feelings of confusion of being<br/>
displaced. And in part from having lead poisoning as a small child. I<br/>
don&#39;t need to stop his aggression in total, I just need to be<br/>
respectful and to help him feel good about himself. He generally feels<br/>
awful after an uncontrollable aggressive outburst. He is generally a<br/>
sweet and empathetic child,<br/>
<br/>
I have internet access again and would be grateful to anyone who can<br/>
help me sort this out. I can answer questions if more information is<br/>
necessary. I wish that there was someone irl to talk this through.<br/>
Part of my confusion was from meeting people who claimed to be<br/>
unschoolers but were not. I am so happy that I found this group and<br/>
that you guys will pick everything apart and discuss it. I feel like I<br/>
can really wrap myself around ideas and impliment them in our lives<br/>
more effectively. I feel good when i come here.<br/>
thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212050080">There has been three situations. In the first one he and another boy<br/>
were hitting each other. After talking about i found out that the<br/>
other boy had jumped on his friends crackers after they had asked him<br/>
to watch out. So easy pushed him off the crackers then the other kid<br/>
hit him...etc<br/>
the second situation was another little guy kept poking Easy, he asked<br/>
him to stop several times. Easy walked away, kid followed him still<br/>
poking him and laughing. At this point I got up from nursing. Before I<br/>
got over there Easy had smacked his hand away. I asked Easy to keep<br/>
his hands to his self and placed my body between him and the other<br/>
kid. I ask the kid to stop poking. He wouldn&#39;t. His mother said that<br/>
he was &quot;just playing&quot;. I tryed to talk with the boys but the mom keep<br/>
interjecting and being quite negating. I dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
The last incident was today, a little girl kept pushing Easy but I<br/>
didn&#39;t know. he appearently got fed up and pushed her back. We talked<br/>
a little but the girls mom said shes been doing that and not to worry.<br/>
<br/>
The other parents do time outs and take away privileges. I don&#39;t know<br/>
if leaving the playgroup would be warranted in these situations. They<br/>
weren&#39;t OK for him to hit but they weren&#39;t unprovoked either. I feel<br/>
like I talked about it with him. Do you think I should have left? I am<br/>
having a hard time with drawing lines ( I was parented with ever<br/>
changing boundaries and have a hard time making good boundary<br/>
discions) Where exactly should I draw the line? If he hits at all or<br/>
if he hits first or what?<br/>
<br/>
Playgrooup use to mostly be kids from 8-14 with Easy and two other<br/>
kids being the little sibs (they are all the same age), recently we<br/>
had a large influx of people and there are now like 15 kids between<br/>
4-7. So there are more social interaction issues coming up, not just<br/>
with mine. But i don&#39;t smack my kid or give him a time out. So should<br/>
I just give him a time out instead of take him home because thats what<br/>
everyone else does?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145772923">I&#39;m just sharing my $0.02, since I have a 4yo who can be aggressive lately.<br/>
Faith, from what you are describing below, I don&#39;t think your son has an<br/>
issue with hitting.  Sounds like he is trying to resolve situations with<br/>
other kids, not being successful, and resorting to physical means to make<br/>
the other kids stop.  That&#39;s totally normal, I think.  From what you said in<br/>
the first post, it at first sounded like he was the instigator, and<br/>
regularly hit other kids as a bullying or sensory overload reaction, and<br/>
that this happens on a daily or weekly basis.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m dealing with<br/>
in my house.  My little one is very sensitive and will only work to solve a<br/>
problem verbally for about 30 seconds, then resorts to hitting - and not<br/>
just a shove, it&#39;s windmill arms and kicking feet and being very physical,<br/>
without being able to stop himself when we say &quot;stop&quot;.  That&#39;s totally<br/>
different than a child who occaisionally falls back on physical solutions<br/>
when the more mature routes aren&#39;t working (or they just can&#39;t remember to<br/>
use them!).  In *my* situation, we often have to leave the park/playdate<br/>
because he&#39;s not being at *all* safe with other children.  I have also been<br/>
known to leave a park/playdate when I felt that another child was not being<br/>
safe to my children, and the parent was doing nothing to help me resolve the<br/>
situation.  The kids and I also talk about how playing with some of the<br/>
friends at our homeschool group usually ends up with someone hurt or crying,<br/>
and it might be best to play with someone else instead.  That doesn&#39;t always<br/>
work, but we talk about it. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493972750">I don&#39;t think 3 times in 6 weeks warrants leaving the playgroup next <br/>
time it happens, esp since it sounds like the other kids were getting <br/>
physical also.  It sounds like you are doing a good job trying to <br/>
help him through it at the HS group.  I don&#39;t think it is right to <br/>
give him a time-out to appease other parents.  What you might <br/>
consider doing is to have him come sit with you and take a break to <br/>
cool off, if it appears he needs to.  Otherwise, you talked to him, <br/>
so you handled it.  In new situations, it might be wise to keep close <br/>
to him since you know he is prone to hitting.  That way if you see a <br/>
situation escalating, you can intervene.  <br/>
<br/>
At home, I would absolutely remove him from a situation if he started <br/>
hitting and did not stop.  I don&#39;t think stopping a child from <br/>
hitting is disrespectful to him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This post presents the situation a bit differently than the first. So  <br/>
- the first thing I suggest is you print both posts and read them  <br/>
carefully and think more about how you are perceiving things. Try to  <br/>
get a really clear and honest picture of what is really going on. Your  <br/>
confusion about what to do about it is partly, at least, because of  <br/>
your lack of clarity about what is really happening.<br/>
<br/>
You started your previous post with:<br/>
&quot;I have been trying to figure out how to handle my ds aggression. He is<br/>
5. He will strike first, talk later. This is generally directed at his<br/>
older sister but sometimes towards me or his father. And recently<br/>
towards other children in our homeschool playgroup. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
  But now you&#39;re saying this has happened just 3 times. And, according  <br/>
to the second post, he didn&#39;t strike first, he was provoked by another  <br/>
kid&#39;s poking or pushing, tried to get away and/or even asked the other  <br/>
kid to stop, and then resorted to pushing. That&#39;s not &quot;strike first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not complaining about being misled - I&#39;m saying that it will help  <br/>
you to get the &quot;issue&quot; clear first, before looking for solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Remind your son that when other kids are bothering him in some way -  <br/>
&quot;get help from a grown-up&quot; should come before &quot;hitting or pushing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents talk too much. Check whether you&#39;re doing that - you  <br/>
don&#39;t want to talk so much that he tunes you out. Make things simple.  <br/>
&quot;As soon as you think you might hit or push, stop and come and ask me  <br/>
for help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, don&#39;t even pay attention to what other parents might be doing to  <br/>
their kids. You know better, you have to try to live up to your own  <br/>
ideals, not down to theirs.<br/>

own sister frequently. Many times without talking to her about whats<br/>
bothering him first. he had never hit another child until recently,<br/>
that freaked me out a bit (when it happened). My fear was that it<br/>
would escalate to more aggressive behavior. I realized (thanks to you<br/>
asking me to examine my perspective) that he was not being aggressive<br/>
but just handling the situations in a less than ideal manner. I have<br/>
been helping him work out those issues so my fear is unfounded, unless<br/>
it escalates and I can &quot;cross that bridge...&quot;<br/>

thought you might want to put out a call for more like-minded parents. lol<br/>

I just read a notice today for a playgroup here, where the e-mail said<br/>
something like &quot;we practice respectful positive parenting and conflict<br/>

is a problem. Hover! I recently heard the term &quot;helicopter mom!&quot; It is  <br/>
used to describe over-controlling mothers who don&#39;t let their kids  <br/>
handle their own problems. I don&#39;t see that as being a common problem.  <br/>
But parents being a bit unavailable, a little too detached --- that I  <br/>
see a LOT. Even in homeschooling/unschooling parents.<br/>

When you are at home, you apparently need to be more present when he  <br/>
and his sister are together. If you&#39;re more aware, you&#39;ll see things  <br/>
leading up to him hitting her and you can step in. Lots of times you  <br/>
can just sense the tension rising in him and you can say some little  <br/>
thing to distract him - or even invite him to go do something with  <br/>
you. Break the tension.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re out with other kids - the temptation is to sit with the  <br/>
moms and gab, but you need to be nearby your son to be able to help  <br/>
him. He doesn&#39;t have the impulse control, yet, to stop his anger long  <br/>
enough to go get an adult to help him. So be RIGHT there ready to  <br/>
help. He won&#39;t need you to do that forever, just for this  <br/>
developmental stage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702268796">I am curious, does that mean we need to step in every time kids get<br/>
angry?  I&#39;ve been told &quot;boys are boys, let them work it out&quot;. Is that<br/>
ever valid advice and when?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am also wondering abt a situation we had last night.<br/>
<br/>
A friend gave the twins a Spiderman costume.  Both of them wanted to<br/>
wear it.  Armand got to it first so I negotiated with them that Azel<br/>
gets the costume when we arrive home.  When we got home Azel was<br/>
asleep. So Armand played with it more. Azel woke up, puttered around a<br/>
little. Hours later he wanted the costume. He got upset and started<br/>
squealing - then I asked Armand to give him the costume since its<br/>
Azel&#39;s turn. He refused, so I told Azel Armand doesn&#39;t want to share<br/>
so we&#39;ll have to wait a bit.<br/>
<br/>
At some point I find Armand pummeling Azel - (remember I can&#39;t hear if<br/>
they&#39;re talking or screaming at each other) - and I physically remove<br/>
him. He says Azel said he was stupid, and Azel says he told Jael to<br/>
stop (whatever he was doing on the computer). I explain what Azel was<br/>
saying and perhaps shld have watched him longer because I find Armand<br/>
hitting again and remove him.  &quot;You are not being safe!&quot; I put him in<br/>
the hall and say to stay there - &quot;You are being mean and hitting<br/>
people - that is not safe. When you calm down and feel you can be safe<br/>
around others, then you can come out.&quot; Armand comes out on his own and<br/>
later takes off the costume so Azel can have it.<br/>
<br/>
All this time I&#39;m trying to pack and wash clothes for our trip today.<br/>
This situation, they got angry at different points. Which portions<br/>
could have been resolved without me, because I only seem to have<br/>
served as a stopgap measure?  I didn&#39;t stop Armand from punching his<br/>
brother until after the fact, because I didn&#39;t see him in time.  What<br/>
didn&#39;t I think of?  What would you do?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There have been so many stories over the years that adults tell of  <br/>
being kids left to figure it out themselves and what happened was the  <br/>
stronger one intimidates the weaker one. The parent doesn&#39;t see even  <br/>
a small portion of what the stronger one is doing. It&#39;s really nasty.<br/>
<br/>
When you see things escalating, call one away to do something fun  <br/>
with you: get snacks, carry laundry for you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hours later he wanted the costume. He got upset and started<br/>
&gt; squealing<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like he doesn&#39;t trust that he can get what he wants and  <br/>
doesn&#39;t trust that you&#39;ll help him. So he needs to escalate immediately.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like a problem that&#39;s running deep. They don&#39;t trust that  <br/>
they can have what they need so they need to fight to hold onto it  <br/>
and fight to get it. Even if you&#39;ve changed parenting them, it&#39;s  <br/>
going to take a while before they trust that you&#39;re on their side.<br/>

Have you read Siblings Without Rivalry?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely do stop them from hitting. Tell them everyone needs to  <br/>
feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
But the way you&#39;ve worded it is as a rule. Kids don&#39;t hit for no  <br/>
reason. When the focus shifts away from what they were trying to get  <br/>
to the way they were trying to get it, they feel like no one  <br/>
understands and no one&#39;s listening.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if someone were saying foul things to you on and on and  <br/>
on and you got to the point where you couldn&#39;t think what else to do  <br/>
but punch them, and someone grabbed you and went on and on about how  <br/>
you shouldn&#39;t punch people, how would you feel?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284147671">I&#39;ve been watching this discussion, as I&#39;ve got a girl who fights, dd2, who<br/>
is about to turn 5.  I do believe that she hits and destroys things for a<br/>
reason.  She feels hurt, ignored, curious (she just LOVES the scissors --<br/>
and has to try it out on EVERYthing), etc.  I know that this is how she<br/>
handles the hurt that&#39;s inside her, and how she sometimes handles her<br/>
exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning how she handles her hurt feelings, we&#39;ve been trying to work with<br/>
her for a couple of years now.  And I feel almost completely out of patience<br/>
(some days I have less than zero patience).  We&#39;re so utterly frustrated<br/>
with this, we&#39;re reacting more to her instead of responding mindfully (NOT<br/>
good).  Hitting, spitting, throwing things at the object of her anger is her<br/>
first response.  Her second is to let it sit, and hours later systematically<br/>
shred a picture dd1 had made.<br/>
<br/>
No, we have not read Siblings Without Rivalry, but it sounds like we need<br/>
to.  dd1 does not like to be around her sister.  I&#39;m afraid this is really<br/>
hurting their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Hovering may be good for us until she learns to pause before mixing it up.<br/>
Leaving the park immediately would be good except that it seems unfair to<br/>
dd1 who&#39;s been doing just fine.  No-win, but leaving early is probably the<br/>
better choice.<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, I&#39;m rambling and venting.  Just had to get this out.<br/>
Arrrgh!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966497609">~~I also did a lot of coaching them to ask for a turn, and <br/>
to wait until the first one is finished. I would entertain the one <br/>
who had to wait until the first was finished with the toy. I felt <br/>
very strongly that whoever was playing with the toy first should get <br/>
to examine it and enjoy it without someone continually pestering them <br/>
for a turn. When they know they will get to fully enjoy something, <br/>
they are much more willing to share it.~~<br/>
   <br/>
  I definitely stick close by, and even if I&#39;m doing laundry or something else, I am very attuned to every communication and if they&#39;re getting along or not.  It can go from 0 - 100 *so* fast though, that sometimes I don&#39;t catch it in time.<br/>
   <br/>
  I really like the idea of each one getting to fully enjoy whatever it is they&#39;ve chosen, I think this is key.  It might be the part I&#39;ve been missing.  I often feel bad for them that they have to be looking over their shoulder waiting for the other one to come and grab something they&#39;re enjoying.<br/>
   <br/>
  I do coach them constantly to take turns (instead of saying &#39;share&#39;), because they seem to get what taking turns means.  It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re always willing to do it, but they get the concept.  I will try entertaining the one that is waiting and see if that gives them a ltitle more breathing room, that&#39;s a great idea.<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563554989">I&#39;ve been watching this discussion, as I&#39;ve got a girl who fights, dd2, who<br/>
is about to turn 5.  I do believe that she hits and destroys things for a<br/>
reason.  She feels hurt, ignored, curious (she just LOVES the scissors --<br/>
and has to try it out on EVERYthing), etc.  I know that this is how she<br/>
handles the hurt that&#39;s inside her, and how she sometimes handles her<br/>
exploration.<br/>
===================<br/>
Redirection is a good tool to have if someone is exploring in a dangerous way, or even a way that can add stress. I wrote about Linnaea and her friend playing with flour the other day at the bottom of the stairs. David (dh) got upset. The floor there is parquet, so lots of little bits of wood with lots of little crevices. Instead of telling them to stop or him to mellow out, I moved the play to a better room and made sure that I was the one to clean it up when they were done. If I&#39;d let it unfold the way it was beginning, with tension and resentment building, it could have blown up into an aggressive encounter.  By moving between the two parties and coming up with something that allowed both goals to be met, flour not on parquet floor and flour play period, it didn&#39;t get to bad feelings. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea tends to feel jealous over things. Last night she felt jealous that Simon was going to sleep with me (David had chosen to sleep in another room as he had to work this morning and we were up late watching My Name is Earl so there was a spare space in the parental bed). She felt bad about feeling jealous. Like it meant she wasn&#39;t a good person or that it wasn&#39;t fair to Simon that she felt so jealous. I said that I love that she wants to be with me so much that she wants all of my time. And it is true, it is a compliment to me how much she wants my attention. I said I wish her desire to be with me didn&#39;t leave her feeling bad. And she snuggled deeper into me and I read to her. I don&#39;t know if it helped, but it made me feel better. It helped me to have a less angry stance on her jealousy, her competition with her brother. I know that when I look at the direct time I spend with Linnaea and the direct time I spend with Simon, I spend far more with<br/>
 Linnaea. Sometimes it is easy for me to feel angry or bitter or resentful that she is saying that she doesn&#39;t want Simon to get my attention. It helped last night to look at it from a different perspective. <br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
Concerning how she handles her hurt feelings, we&#39;ve been trying to work with<br/>
her for a couple of years now.  And I feel almost completely out of patience<br/>
(some days I have less than zero patience).  We&#39;re so utterly frustrated<br/>
with this, we&#39;re reacting more to her instead of responding mindfully (NOT<br/>
good).  Hitting, spitting, throwing things at the object of her anger is her<br/>
first response.  Her second is to let it sit, and hours later systematically<br/>
shred a picture dd1 had made.<br/>
<br/>
=====================<br/>
What is she like when she isn&#39;t hurt or angry? Can you think about her in that light more frequently? I went through a period of walking on eggshells around Linnaea of defining her more by her angry and reactive moments than by her joyful and laughing ones. It helps me to be kind to her when I can think of her as funny and engaging and joyful and sparky and interesting and chatty and filled with motion and light. It doesn&#39;t change her, I can&#39;t do that. I can&#39;t make her not jealous or not angry or not reactive. But I can be kind to her when she needs me to be kind. I can be filled with patience and energy and generousity. It helps me to be the parent that I want to be.<br/>
====================<br/>
No, we have not read Siblings Without Rivalry, but it sounds like we need<br/>
to.  dd1 does not like to be around her sister.  I&#39;m afraid this is really<br/>
hurting their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Hovering may be good for us until she learns to pause before mixing it up.<br/>
Leaving the park immediately would be good except that it seems unfair to<br/>
dd1 who&#39;s been doing just fine.  No-win, but leaving early is probably the<br/>
better choice.<br/>
===================<br/>
If you left early to dd1&#39;s dismay, could you go do something else that they would both enjoy? Something like go and get ice cream or go to a video store and pick out a DVD to watch when you get home or something instead that makes it feel not like punishment but like what it is, avoiding an unpleasant encounter. In my experience, hovering tends to help eliminate a lot of the need to bail on an activity. If you come to the park with lots of cool things to play with and are totally prepared to play Billy Goats Gruff over and over again, there isn&#39;t a lot of need or stress about being at the park. <br/>

I wanted to respond to this. I&#39;ve always figured that Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t have to like each other. I have very little contact with my brother. I don&#39;t think it is because we don&#39;t like each other, but because we don&#39;t have a lot to talk about. So I figure that Simon and Linnaea may only spend a small part of their lives (I hope) together under my roof. The only relationship that I can make good is the one they have with me. I make sure that they are safe and that they aren&#39;t harrassed by each other. I step in when I feel that I need to, but I can&#39;t make them like each other. Amazingly enough, they often do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164146076">I agree with you, very frequently parents ignore their own children&#39;s<br/>
part in conflict and scapegoat other children. I have deep issues with<br/>
this being &quot;normal&quot; in playgroups. In the situations that I wrote<br/>
about once was very respectful, the parent of the boy and my son and I<br/>
talked and helped the boys work things out. The other two occurrences<br/>
were me trying to work things out between the kids as respectfully as<br/>
possible, most parents thinking and have said that it is too much<br/>
trouble to mediate. They are the ones that openly or passively voice<br/>
their expectations that I punish. One mother is so oblivious to her<br/>
kids it hurts. She is constantly negating them, even the baby. I<br/>
really long to find some more like minded parents but haven&#39;t found<br/>
others who parent gently after the &quot;pre-school&quot; years. Its like AP<br/>
parenting flies out the window at 4 or something.<br/>

  I have found this too, seems like it&#39;s easy to grasp trust and respect with babies, but when the babies grow up and start speaking up, the trust and respect seems to part company with many families.  I am part of a large AP group in my city, and lots of the kids are getting older.  The talk now centers on finding the perfect preschool and finding the perfect discipline method to have perfect little compliant kids.  I find I am just sort of naturally moving away from that group and more towards my local unschooling crowd.  With the unschooling families my girls and I get to hang out with parents who trust and respect their kids so much, and it&#39;s beautiful to see how settled and happy the kids are.  We&#39;ve had many many playtimes where there hasn&#39;t been a single conflict between any of the kids - they just seem more relaxed about life in general.  It&#39;s so challenging for us to be around other families that aren&#39;t living consensually that we just don&#39;t choose to do it very<br/>
 often anymore.  When I speak up about what we&#39;re doing I get looks like I&#39;ve just landed from another planet.  Lots of this stuff wasn&#39;t an issue when all our kids were babies, but the differences are really showing up now.<br/>

&gt;  I think you should do that, be there for him. But, do it before there<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do that, so I am glad to hear that I am dong the best thing<br/>
possible. I do have a small baby (6 months) so I am occasionally<br/>
distracted with her needs. I tend to hang out with the kids more than<br/>
the adults. The adults are so hard to be around, I start to feel<br/>
panicked. They mostly sit and chat, or complain about their kids. I<br/>
try to interact with mine and other kids. My oldest doesn&#39;t want me<br/>
around during co-op because all the other kids hate their parents and<br/>
even though she likes me she doesn&#39;t want to appear too different. I<br/>
tend to watch the littler ones in the sand box or on the play gym or<br/>
rocks. I am moving more towards leaving this co-op. It is better than<br/>
the other local homeschool group which is xtain school at homers. And<br/>
my kids like it better than the option of not being involved with any<br/>
group. I know there has to be another option or two.<br/>

&gt;  can just sense the tension rising in him and you can say some little<br/>
&gt;  thing to distract him - or even invite him to go do something with<br/>
&gt;  you. Break the tension.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I have definitely been slipping in this area.  Like I said we<br/>
just had a baby 6 months ago and then (what was I thinking) we bought<br/>
a house a couple months ago. So I have been overwhelmed with all that<br/>
*needs* to happen. I am still not unpacked and moved in. Plus, my dh<br/>
has been working 15-16 hour days 7 days a week on a project, that will<br/>
hopefully be done soon. And he is going to be away for 2 weeks<br/>
starting this friday (arg) and those things have been adding pressure.<br/>
I don&#39;t really have any support system.<br/>
I try to spend as much time with the kids as possible. The break downs<br/>
usually occur at the end of the day when everyone is tired (of course)<br/>
BUT I did realize that I have been viewing my son as the &quot;problem&quot;<br/>
instead of being a partner in figuring things out with him. I have<br/>
been observing much in the last few days and can feel this awakening<br/>
to a new perspective. He one big blow up the other day, I remained<br/>
clam and focused on him. Since then he has been feeling better.<br/>
Seeking me out instead of butting heads.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  When you&#39;re out with other kids - the temptation is to sit with the<br/>
&gt;  moms and gab, but you need to be nearby your son to be able to help<br/>
&gt;  him. He doesn&#39;t have the impulse control, yet, to stop his anger long<br/>
&gt;  enough to go get an adult to help him. So be RIGHT there ready to<br/>
&gt;  help. He won&#39;t need you to do that forever, just for this<br/>
&gt;  developmental stage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe this should be another thread but I HATE talking to other<br/>
mothers. Not all of them but most. I loathe co-op days. I only go<br/>
because my 11dd NEEDS it. She is very social and has always craved<br/>
people. We have been going since we moved here about 2 years ago. They<br/>
are her friends and as I don&#39;t want to talk to their mothers much we<br/>
don&#39;t do too many playdates. I am wondering how everyone one here<br/>
found other unschoolers? Their is a PA unschoolers yahoo group I<br/>
belong to but no one lives down here. And most aren&#39;t radical. I have<br/>
thought to start my own group but I am not sure how. What are the<br/>
logistics of a group. I am very socially inept.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969190848">I joined the local AP group (well it is a hour away). But I have yet<br/>
to go as all the sessions are geared towards babies or at oldest<br/>
toddlers. I am almost a LLL leader which I really enjoy but I still<br/>
find that even long term lll people still parent mainstream after a<br/>
few years. I have always tried to maintain AP philosophies and parent<br/>
gently and respectfully but find it harder as they get older. We have<br/>
always unschooled (before I had even heard of such a thing) and AP&#39;d<br/>
but not &quot;perfectly&quot; as I have had a lot of confusion (I was ill<br/>
parented and abused as a child) and not really much guidance I felt<br/>
good about.<br/>
<br/>
I am really glad I finally found this group a few months ago as it has<br/>
been a breath of fresh air and really helped with some difficult<br/>
questions. I really need to be able to hear a loving perspective<br/>
instead of mainstream views when I feel confused.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most parents have a hard time with autonomy issues.<br/>
Most parents I met have a hard time with my children&#39;s autonomy, since<br/>
their own children;s are suppressed. I often wonder what other<br/>
unschooled kids &quot;look like&quot; as the kids I know are so, well the<br/>
antithesis of free. I think sometimes I do oppress my kids<br/>
unintentionally as I am unsure about the difference between freedom<br/>
and license. But slowly I am figuring it out. My kids tend to let me<br/>
know :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all on this list who write the hard truths and don&#39;t sugar<br/>
coat it when people are being oppressive to their kids. I really<br/>
appreciate that.<br/>

play with him and squeeze in a few things while he is doing his own<br/>
thing. Any suggestions on getting more done? And still having a happy<br/>

sometimes helps me unpack. She prefers to &quot;give me an hour&quot; and then<br/>
go off and do her own thing. Which is great but still our house is<br/>
very slow to come together. I am getting the basics done, laundry,<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Yeah, I have definitely been slipping in this area. Like I said we<br/>
&gt;  &gt; just had a baby 6 months ago and then (what was I thinking) we bought<br/>
&gt;  &gt; a house a couple months ago. So I have been overwhelmed with all that<br/>
&gt;  &gt; *needs* to happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Do you use a sling for the baby? I didn&#39;t really need it for the first<br/>
&gt;  babe - and my second was sort of &quot;easy&quot; - she&#39;d be happy in one place,<br/>
&gt;  very content, etc. But for the third, the sling was awesome - I could<br/>
&gt;  do almost anything while wearing the baby &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

parenting flies out the window at 4 or something.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this really hit home!  I feel like you were talking about ME!  I was a<br/>
very active AP when my son was first born.  I had never really heard about<br/>
it before I was a mom.  But when my son was about 3 or 4 months old, I<br/>
stumbled across Dr. Sear&#39;s Baby Book, and everything just made sense to me.<br/>
I had bought a crib before DS was born, but he only slept in it a handful of<br/>
times, because it just didn&#39;t feel right.  After reading the Baby Book, I<br/>
felt confident to trust my instinct, read my baby&#39;s cues and officially<br/>
declared myself an AP parent.<br/>
<br/>
6 years, and 2 more children later, I stumbled across unschooling in a<br/>
similar way.  A friend let me borrow The Unschooling Handbook.  It hit me<br/>
the same way that AP did.  It all just seemed to make sense to me.  I was<br/>
like, &quot;Yes!  THIS is the way I want to raise my children!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I also felt a little removed from it. As I read, I started feeling more<br/>
and more like this was the kind of parent I USED to be.  Somehow I had<br/>
veered away from AP ideals a bit.  I wondered at what point did I stop<br/>
listening to and trusting my children?  Why did I ignore them sometimes on<br/>
the playground just so I could have an adult conversation?  When did<br/>
housework become more important than playtime?  When was the last time I<br/>
just sat down and hung out with my kids?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I read &quot;Parenting a Free Child,&quot; I wanted to go back to how<br/>
things were before.  And I am now working towards that.  We&#39;ve only been<br/>
unschooling for about a month or so, and already I can see a change in the<br/>
way my kids respond to me!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why some AP parents throw everything away as babies grow up.<br/>
Maybe we feel social pressure to &quot;get them ready for school.&quot;  Maybe we feel<br/>
like we need to have &quot;perfect&quot; little children so others will think we are<br/>
&quot;good&quot; parents.   I&#39;m not sure.  I just know that I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;ve had<br/>
the chance to be redirected back to a parenting style that I truly feel is<br/>
right.  This group has been very helpful!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in a similar boat. I have a 4yo and a 9 month old. I bought a <br/>
house and moved the family when my bab was only 2 weeks old and <br/>
while my dh was deployed. He was gone from January 2007 to January <br/>
2008. I had the baby in June 2007. At the time that I had the baby <br/>
and moved I also had my teenager with me. It is now almost 10 months <br/>
later and the garage is still a mess and there are boxes around the <br/>
house and nothing is quite put together. I can&#39;t do much with the <br/>
baby in a sling, either, and I&#39;ve tried a ring sling, a mei tai and <br/>
a wrap. My back hurts too much. I love my slings and use them all <br/>
the time, just not for housework or unpacking. My dh is home and <br/>
working on things but it&#39;s still very slow going. He goes to work <br/>
during the day and still has to leave for a few weeks here and <br/>
there. When he is home we&#39;d much rather do things together and with <br/>
the kids than one of spending all our time cleaning or unpacking or <br/>
organizing. So, it&#39;s just going very slowly. Most days I wonder if <br/>
it will be done before we have to move again. It causes me a lot of <br/>
stress if I let it. I try to just understand things will be slow <br/>
going and then let it all go. That may be all anyone can do in such <br/>
a situation. Sorry I don&#39;t have much practical help, just <br/>
commisserating.<br/>
