<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309038577">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My 13 year old daughter & I are new to unschooling.  As I was reading <br/>
through information the school has sent me, it states that at the end <br/>
of the year a test muct be administered to see the childs progress.  It <br/>
does state I get to choose from: Iowa test of basic skills; California <br/>
Achievement test; Stanford achievement test; Metropolitan Achievement <br/>
Test or a state Education Department test.  I was wondering if there <br/>
are any practice tests she could take for she is getting very nervous <br/>
that June is coming so quickly. I tried googling them put it only <br/>
explains what they are.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions or any related material in passing one <br/>
of these test?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> It depends on your state. In Hawaii it seemed that they required <br/>
periodic testing but at the very end of the law it stated that a <br/>
portfolio or other statement showing progress could be presented. <br/>
Read the actual state law before you do anything.<br/>
