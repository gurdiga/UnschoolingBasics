<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558605510">The &quot;tag line&quot; of the accountability association I run in SC to allow <br/>
families to homeschool is &quot;Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I get reminded of this every now and then. Not that I <br/>
don&#39;t *need* to be reminded. It&#39;s just that I wish I weren&#39;t reminded <br/>
in such a harsh way.<br/>
<br/>
I think most traditional, conventional parents think of something <br/>
different when they hear or read it. I think they start considering <br/>
that we only have this one chance to push our children to do better, to <br/>
be better, and to strive harder for that medical degree or career <br/>
choice or...&quot;success&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the message I get.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about what to write now for several days to honor <br/>
the memory of Hannah Jenner, who died two years ago on February 24. I&#39;d <br/>
wanted to toss out there that we really DO only have so much time to <br/>
spend with our children---and even though we *think* have the rest of <br/>
their lives to do and be with them, there&#39;s no guarantee that they <br/>
won&#39;t be taken from us a whole lot sooner than we think. The time they <br/>
spend with us should be full of joy and fun and happy, happy thoughts. <br/>
Their time with us should be filled with *our* joy in them---that they <br/>
know that our world is a better place *because* of them.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah&#39;s short life is a tough reminder for me to enjoy the children I <br/>
have---and every single minute. And not a day goes by that I don&#39;t <br/>
think of Hannah (and Sam Wilkerson and Jacob Strebler). &#39;Cause I just <br/>
don&#39;t know what I would do without Cameron and Duncan. But sometimes, <br/>
when I&#39;m not my best and my temper is short, I *need* that little <br/>
reminder---that this time is a gift.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too often, parents can work so hard helping our children &quot;become&quot; that <br/>
we forget to enjoy Who They *Are*--right now, this minute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lisa Heyman&#39;s passing yesterday has stunned this community. And I just <br/>
can&#39;t imagine the pain and loss the Gauchmans are experiencing right <br/>
now. But I *know* that the girls, Roxy and Fire, will know that their <br/>
mom truly valued the time she had with them. She chose to keep the <br/>
girls close and let them grow &quot;In Their Own Way, In Their Own Time.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s a gift we can ALL give our children. To accept Who They <br/>
Are---and to revel in it!<br/>
<br/>
We have that choice.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa understood that childhood is not a dress rehearsal. Lisa worked <br/>
hard to give her girls he space they needed to grow. She gave them <br/>
inspired, joyful childhoods. There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind that Roxy <br/>
and Fire will thrive in spite of their huge, huge loss. And a big part <br/>
of that is the love and acceptance Lisa showered on them. They will <br/>
kept warm with her light.<br/>
<br/>
Her passing will continue to be a reminder that *my* time with my kids <br/>
is limited as well. I can choose to make the most of each moment with <br/>
them as she did. Our world is brighter because of Lisa. And I&#39;m glad I <br/>
got to know her.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love and Many Hugs to Larry and Roxy and Fire.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922577541">Kelly, you&#39;ve written a beautiful tribute to Lisa (and to Hannah, Sam and Jacob). My thoughts <br/>
are with Lisa&#39;s dh and girls, as they are with the other families who lost their loved ones.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the reminder about &quot;In Their Own Way, In Their Own Time.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This came up just last night, after *I* had a meltdown. I thought, &quot;I can&#39;t let this be our last <br/>
exchange,&quot; so I went back to dd&#39;s room and we sat and talked for almost an hour. This hardly <br/>
ever happens! Dd&#39;s not only very private, she feels cornered sometimes when I want to talk. I <br/>
write her a lot of letters &lt;g&gt;. So, it was a sweet, close time. Later on, she couldn&#39;t sleep and <br/>
asked to crawl into bed with me. I felt so lucky to have the opportunity to turn things around, <br/>
and to have my &quot;big&quot; girl physically close again, if only for a little while. I will remember that <br/>
our time is finite. And to allow her to grow in her own way, in her own time.<br/>
<br/>
That mantra will be Lisa&#39;s legacy, at least for me.<br/>
