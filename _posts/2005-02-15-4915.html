<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151745834">I started a Yahoo group for child-led, life learners, unschoolers,<br/>
etc. and now it&#39;s in danger of being shut down because I don&#39;t have<br/>
any members - apparently I need to advertise more! The group is<br/>
called the Open Path Network, I origionally started it for any<br/>
location ~ and I would still welcome anyone from any location who is<br/>
into the same theories ~ I just hope to get some &quot;locals&quot; as well so<br/>
perhaps we could plan some outings or have some playdates,etc. I<br/>
know there is a group for KS but we;re closer to Columbia or Jeff<br/>
City. I hope it&#39;s okey with the board owners that I post the link<br/>
here:<br/>
