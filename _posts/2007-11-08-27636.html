<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693677711">&lt;&lt;So, whatever words DS hears us say, he is free to say (which makes  for a <br/>
strong<br/>
incentive to ONLY use words we&#39;d be comfortable with DS saying  to his<br/>
grandparents lol). &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Dh and I swear sometimes at home, but neither of the kids choose to, at  <br/>
least around us, even though we&#39;ve told them they can.  They both even go  out of <br/>
their way to avoid it, like they&#39;ll say &quot;bleeeep&quot; when they&#39;re reading  <br/>
something aloud from a book, or they&#39;ll explain something someone said by  telling <br/>
me what the word rhymes with.  (They say they&#39;re not offended by  our swearing, <br/>
and that we&#39;re not as bad as South Park.  lol)<br/>
 <br/>
The information we&#39;ve given them about swearing is that some people are  <br/>
offended by it or might think less of you for it, so it&#39;s tricky because if  you <br/>
don&#39;t want to offend or repel certain people in certain situations  you have to <br/>
figure out who&#39;s who, and learn when to turn it on and off,  which even I <br/>
have difficulty doing.  My son, who&#39;s 12, has created own  policy of &quot;don&#39;t swear <br/>
until sworn to&quot; with his friends, which he says  helps keep himself out of <br/>
trouble with other kids&#39; parents.  He say he  just doesn&#39;t want to swear around <br/>
us.<br/>
 <br/>
My dd who&#39;s 11 doesn&#39;t swear because she says that it would probably sound  <br/>
weird to adults coming from a kid, like how to her, if her four-year old  <br/>
cousin swore it&#39;d be a bit shocking.  <br/>
 <br/>
So I&#39;m curious what other swear-ers out there do, and what &quot;results&quot; you&#39;re  <br/>
getting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wil say that I went through a &quot;Swearing phase&quot; in college mostly <br/>
as an acquired habit which went bye bye pretty quickly somewhere <br/>
around senior year as the professional &#39;real world&#39; got closer. What <br/>
really annoys me is not the particular words but the folks who <br/>
simply have no other words to use &quot;It was, like, f***in, y&#39;know, <br/>
like, f***in crazy on the highway&quot; We&#39;ve got a zillion words in <br/>
English to convey all sorts of shadings of emotion and situation <br/>
(except we&#39;re way short on words related to love - Greek has 4 to <br/>
differentiate between the type of the love whether it&#39;s mom or <br/>
spouse or whatever) and I think they should get at least equal use <br/>
to the &quot;expletives&quot; because, yeah, sometimes only those will do. <br/>
But, using it every other word, to me, really waters things down. <br/>
For example, I work with some folks who use f***in day in and day <br/>
out. But when I named a variable in a program fntoolbar my boss knew <br/>
PRECISELY how aggravated I was because I don&#39;t habitually use that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and when DS was aggravated at the double standard for kids and <br/>
adults, he decided what would work best is for us to all just use <br/>
food words if we needed to express something strongly - Oh popcorn! <br/>
or Hot chocolate!! or whatever. That way it was &#39;safe&#39; for him to <br/>
say around others. I thought it was a pretty creative solution he <br/>
came up with, even though, as noted, he could say whatever he heard <br/>
us say (typically fairly mild).<br/>

See, now I think *that&#39;s* cool.  I have to admit I feel a little twinge of <br/>
hurt when they *won&#39;t* swear in front of me.  They do talk to me about all kinds <br/>
of things though, so I don&#39;t take it as a sign that they&#39;re trying to cut me <br/>
out of their lives or anything.  <br/>
 <br/>
Funny how there are so many parents out there &quot;demanding&quot; respect.  Here I <br/>
get a little bit and I don&#39;t even appreciate it.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m curious what other swear-ers out there do, and what &quot;results&quot; <br/>
you&#39;re<br/>
getting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I swear like a sailor and have been known as a potty mouth. When I <br/>
write (which is exactly how I speak), I have to go back and delete <br/>
certain words that might offend this list.<br/>
<br/>
But I keep it under-wraps when I take the dog to the retirement home. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; I keep it down when I&#39;m at a christening. &lt;g&gt; I try pretty hard <br/>
when I&#39;m public speaking (that&#39;s harder because when I get going about <br/>
something I&#39;m passionate about,....). &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE colorful language. A LOT. Well, I like *language* a lot. And, <br/>
while I agree that words are powerful, I think that when people *give* <br/>
power to certain words by making them...&quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or <br/>
&quot;profane&quot;---that gives them a...::different::...kind of power. Not a <br/>
good kind.<br/>
<br/>
Words are just words. And even &quot;acceptable&quot; words can be a lot meaner <br/>
than &quot;bad&quot; words depending on how we say them.<br/>
<br/>
In that u-tube clip of the mom screaming a week&#39;s worth of orders at <br/>
her kids, she ends with &quot;I love you&quot;---but it didn&#39;t sound very loving.<br/>
<br/>
Around here, no words are off-limits, but the boys know when and where <br/>
some words are inappropriate to use. THAT is what I think is important.<br/>
<br/>
My neice (six at the time) once told me that she wasn&#39;t allowed to <br/>
watch Rugrats because they use the &quot;S word.&quot; Now, I racked my brain <br/>
trying to figure out WHEN Tommy said &quot;shit&quot;---I mean..puhleeze! It&#39;s <br/>
RUGRATS! I asked her, and it took quite a while to pull it out of her. <br/>
&quot;You know---the &quot;S <br/>
word&#39;&#39;&#39;---Sssssssss....ssssstt...sssstttttoooooo...sssssttttoooooooooopid<br/>
,&quot; as her eyes darted around to make sure no one else heard her say it.<br/>
<br/>
Stupid is NOT a bad word. It can certainly be unkind if you *call* <br/>
someone stupid. It can be unkind to call someone &quot;pretty&quot; too if it&#39;s <br/>
meant derogatorily!<br/>
<br/>
My nephew (cousin, not brother of the neice) got his mouth washed out <br/>
with soap a while back. His mother was laughing as she told Ben that <br/>
she did it. He asked where Patrick had heard the word, his mom said <br/>
probably from her. I asked whether she washed her own damned mouth out <br/>
then. She quit laughing. *I* was the bully then.<br/>
<br/>
Making *some* words &quot;grown-up words&quot; makes them all the more attractive <br/>
to children who really want to be as grown up as they can be. Making <br/>
*all* words acceptable and accessible and knowing when to use them is a <br/>
much better skill to have.<br/>
<br/>
The only word we don&#39;t use around here is the &quot;C word&quot;......Curriculum. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544905555">Okay, the vision of Ms Kelly swearing like a sailor is one I can  <br/>
hardly create in my head...lol!<br/>
<br/>
I also have a potty mouth. But I&#39;ve stopped looking at it like that,  <br/>
I am just really passionate and my emotions need BIG EFFECTIVE words  <br/>
to feel right to me. And I look at my kids the exact same way. They  <br/>
see that I have places I don&#39;t use it (so much) and places where it  <br/>
is more okay, and I think they follow along for the most part. My  <br/>
oldest is very uncomfortable with using ANY  word with emotion, so  <br/>
he&#39;ll tell me so if I let out a big loud cuss word. My husband was  <br/>
also raised in a household where no cussing was allowed, and he&#39;s  <br/>
really uncomfortable with it. We&#39;ve worked really hard for him to  <br/>
realize that the kids are their own people, and that he can&#39;t choose  <br/>
for them.  He does model more socially acceptable communication, but  <br/>
doesn&#39;t get on to them anymore unless we are at weddings or funerals.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite story is a few months ago at Target, Dan was really  <br/>
upset. And he turned to me and said very loudly (as only a four year  <br/>
old can, i think) &quot;MOM! That really PISSES ME OFF!&quot; Dead silence from  <br/>
around us, everyone staring to see what my reaction would be  <br/>
(obviously I would beat him, yes?) Looks of shock when all I said was  <br/>
&quot;I can tell you&#39;re really angry, really really really angry! What can  <br/>
we do?&quot; bwahahaha. (For the record, he wanted toy that was over $100  <br/>
right before payday...can you say cashless? His solution was to pick  <br/>
out a $1 toy and then write me a letter reminding me to buy it when  <br/>
we had enough money. Not bad, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, thanks for the story about the nephew. We had a similar issue  <br/>
at our in-laws house last time we visited. Josh got killed off in a  <br/>
boss stage, really after a lot of work without saving, and he said  <br/>
quickly and savagely under his breath &quot;damn!&quot; Boy, there was tattling  <br/>
all over the place as every one of our nephews and nieces went to  <br/>
their particular parent to tell on him. Everyone looked at me and all  <br/>
i could think was how each one of those hypocritical adults had  <br/>
probably cussed at least twice since the family gathering began! I  <br/>
shrugged and said something like he&#39;s probably pretty upset, at least  <br/>
it&#39;s not road rage.<br/>

<br/>
One day when my son was three I was in the kitchen juggling a dozen<br/>
things when he asked for a cookie. After putting him off a few minutes<br/>
so I could make sure dinner wasn&#39;t burnt to a crisp he finally got<br/>
exasperated, climbed up on the counter and yelled, &quot;I want an f&#39;ing<br/>
cookie!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids learned how to swear properly from an early age. You<br/>
gotta have priorities, you know.<br/>

Try watching the Vagina Monologues (w/ Eve Ensler).  You&#39;ll never look at<br/>
the &quot;c&quot; word as being off-limits again!  You&#39;ll CLAIM it!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just watch it, you&#39;ll understand!<br/>
