<br/>
I wanted to share my response.<br/>
<br/>
-----Original Message-----<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me an idea of how<br/>
long you typically leave new members on moderated status before you <br/>
trust them<br/>
enough to allow them to post freely? I totally get the reason behind <br/>
initial<br/>
moderation, but it&#39;s hard to keep up with posting when my posts are <br/>
held up<br/>
during an ongoing conversation and then all sent in a wad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It varies. For several reasons.<br/>
<br/>
We have four moderators. Usually posts come through within seconds of <br/>
being posted---that&#39;s when one or more of us are online at the time and <br/>
keep reading and clicking.<br/>
<br/>
But there *are* hours (and even an occasional day or two), when we&#39;re <br/>
ALL busy---off with our kids. Sometimes all at the same time <br/>
(sometimes, even toGETHER! &lt;G&gt;). That&#39;s when messages get sent in <br/>
&quot;bulk.&quot; It&#39;s because no one&#39;s there to actually do the work. It&#39;s not <br/>
that we&#39;re purposefully leaving them in the queue; it&#39;s just that no <br/>
one&#39;s available at that time.<br/>
<br/>
As for how long one remains on moderation, that depends on the <br/>
individual. Some groups moderate just to make sure the new member isn&#39;t <br/>
a Spammer. We have deeper reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, a member is on for years---posters that lurk and post only <br/>
very occasionally may never get off moderation because we never get to <br/>
know the poster. They don&#39;t seem to mind. &lt;g&gt; The ones that get off <br/>
moderation the fastest are the ones who seem to want to <br/>
understand---who ask questions, reflect on the answers, and ask more <br/>
questions. Also---the ones who give advice that is in keeping with the <br/>
philosophy of unschooling. Sometimes that can be just a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Moderation stays on if a member repeatedly gives advice that won&#39;t help <br/>
others understand unschooling (advice that hinders others on the path). <br/>
And members who seem to want to argue instead of *learn* will stay on <br/>
moderation. Members who insist on attacking the list will stay on (or <br/>
be put back on) moderation until the attacks stop.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we let &quot;questionable&quot; posts through because we realize that, <br/>
although they might be contrary to the philosophy, they will be greatly <br/>
helpful for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We use moderation to keep the list moving as smoothly as possible. <br/>
Unschooling and mindful parenting are not easy concepts to understand. <br/>
So we want *all* advice to move the posters TOWARDS unschooling, not <br/>
away. People teetering on the fence, almost there, need a gentle <br/>
*shove* forward, NOT a pull back. It&#39;s so much easier to fall back on <br/>
what we&#39;re already familiar with. It&#39;s sooo much harder to take that <br/>
tiny step forward. Allowing newbies to constantly keep pulling each <br/>
other back *won&#39;t* help them move forward. Moderation helps prevent <br/>
some of that.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, that, occasionally too, yahoo glitches and posts take a <br/>
while to arrive (no fault of the list!). I had a post that took four <br/>
DAYS to post. So it&#39;s not always *us*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I understand if you feel you<br/>
should keep this going for a while, but I think if that&#39;s the case I <br/>
will look<br/>
for another group. After reading some of the posts of other members, <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
not sure my input is going to be very popular, anyway, and that&#39;s<br/>
okay. Diff&#39;rent strokes, and all that.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I see you have now unsubbed. But you left before reading any responses <br/>
to your &quot;teaching&quot; question. I&#39;m forwarding Joyce&#39;s answer on to you.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not unusual for folks to unsub and then come back later eager to <br/>
learn more because *something* rang true.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe your &quot;input&quot; won&#39;t be popular, don&#39;t post---or be ready <br/>
to defend why if you do. (That&#39;s true of all lists, really. And in <br/>
life!)<br/>
<br/>
Different strokes, yes. And although there used to be only one list <br/>
available, there are now dozens and dozens of unschooling lists to <br/>
choose from. One will fit right.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474205257">Thank you for posting this, I have joined this group hoping to learn about<br/>
Unschooling and appreciate the &#39;protection&#39; that you are offering. As a new<br/>
student of this philosophy, I am certain that I will never post enough to be<br/>
taken of moderated status, but hope that the knowledge that I gain will help<br/>
be grow into the HS mom that my kids need.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to many an informative discussion that I can be a silent<br/>
participant in.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings<br/>
