<div id="ygrps-yiv-262042188">Hello, I am new to the list.  I started homeschooling our dd of 9 years old about a month ago.  First we did curriculum for 4 weeks 6 subjects a day it soon became a horrible experience for us.  <br/>
<br/>
So I researched other ways of homeschooling and came accross unschooling.  My husband isnt to fond of it and suggests we do at least 1 subject a day besides bible reading and have thurs and fridays free besides bible reading.<br/>
<br/>
However, I find that she plays toontown online ALL DAY  from 9am to 9pm with only bathroom breaks, eating breaks, and to do her one chore.  I am feeling this is just as unhealthy for her to sit in one spot and stare at a screen as it was to do 6 subjects a day.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling really torn.  but she is the type of personality that will sit and play online games even into her adulthood and not know how to go to a job and work because she just doesnt want to.<br/>
<br/>
Any help pls.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208330631">Hi! I am Jacquie- happily married to Jeff 12 years and we have homeschooled our son since birth. We are trying to do as much unschooling/child led learning as possible. We live in the state of Indiana now. We have a Basset hound named Flas, a Pug named Sadie and two cats named Tia and Ashley and a Guiena pig named Oreo. I hope to learn more ways to unschool from all of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103072450">Hi Kelley! I have an always unschooled 12 yr old son so I don&#39;t have a lot of specifics for your daughter. Just wanted to say Hi - DS was born at Mercy Hospital up on the northwest corner of OKC (we lived on the OKC/Edmond border at the time).<br/>
<br/>
But, what I would suggest, in general, is to take some time off - act like it&#39;s a vacation. Go explore those places that she/you never got to do when school was in session (like the science center or the zoo - way less crowded at 10 am on a Tuesday during the school year). Take time to just Be. Then, see what stuff bubbles up &quot;Gee, I&#39;d like to...&quot; whether it&#39;s learning to knit or bake soufflés or properly taxidermy animals. It&#39;s going to take some time to just start breathing again. Continue to remind yourself (and her too as needed) that there&#39;s no deadline - you don&#39;t have to &quot;be done&quot; at 18. We were in OKC for 4 ½ years while DH was getting his bachelor&#39;s degree - he started when he was 27, having burned out on school and just barely getting his high school diploma. After several years of working at various jobs (started with a mailroom job, ended up doing phone support, software testing and website development for a software company), he found something he was passionate about and college/university had all the resources in one tidy bundle. After a frustrating and lackluster high school experience, he excelled in college (3.9 GPA) because he was interested in what he was doing, he was doing it because HE chose to, not because it was expected.<br/>

after we married. Took 7 years, but he also found something he loves.<br/>
<br/>
I have many acquaintances that act like we&#39;ve done something incredibly<br/>
and irreversibly stupid, so it&#39;s good to hear a thumbs up!<br/>
<br/>
And I was thinking -- so what if it takes an extra semester or even an<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325411295">It doesn&#39;t sound to me like unschooling is necessarily a &quot;good fit&quot; for your situation. It actually takes quite a bit More engagement on the part of parents to unschool successfully, rather than less. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, if you can shift your thinking away from &quot;subjects&quot; and see all life as learning, then its possible you and the kids could arrange schedules so that they mostly sleep while you&#39;re working and you can spend some quality time together while you&#39;re home. One of the odd things about unschooling is that most of the &quot;work&quot; for parents is on the communication and relationship end. You make yourself into the best possible friend and resource. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413298578">I&#39;m curious about what unschooling means to you as far as it being &quot;a way to<br/>
keep my children home&quot;.  How are you looking at unschooling as different<br/>
than what you do now?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think knowing this might help us better understand what kind of<br/>
information you need so we can help.  But in a nutshell, unschooling is<br/>
life.  Generally unschooling means breaking down the ideas that learning is<br/>
separate from living, that a child needs to be taught in order to learn, and<br/>
that anyone outside of a child&#39;s own self can determine what he or she needs<br/>
to know.  This takes as much parental involvement as schooling- it&#39;s just<br/>
involvement of a different sort- its connection and relationship instead of<br/>
lessons and tests.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am about to go back to school and am looking at unschooling as a  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re picturing unschooling as something that doesn&#39;t need as much  <br/>
work as a curriculum, you need to let go of that idea! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about being responsive to a child&#39;s needs. So sometimes  <br/>
it&#39;s backing off and letting them explore freely. Sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>
strewing their lives with new opportunities that they can pick up and  <br/>
explore, or pick up and drop or ignore. Sometimes it&#39;s being right  <br/>
with them, being involved in what they&#39;re doing as much as they need.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need to be done during school hours. It can be done  <br/>
whenever a parent is available. &quot;It&quot; will look different depending on  <br/>
what the children&#39;s needs are in the moment. Sometimes it will mean  <br/>
reading while they play. Sometimes it will mean being the main &quot;maker  <br/>
of things happening&quot;. Sometimes it will be watching cartoons or video  <br/>
games when you&#39;d rather be taking care of the laundry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I worry about things like reading, writing, and math.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty normal to worry about those things. Kids do learn them by  <br/>
living lives where those are a natural part. But it doesn&#39;t &quot;just  <br/>
happen&quot;. It happens because parents are there to answer questions,  <br/>
occasionally point out cool things, offer cool opportunities (that the  <br/>
kids can turn down if they aren&#39;t appealing), are willing to see the  <br/>
learning that happens in playing, especially video games.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s several good pages. Each has links to other pages. The answers  <br/>
can&#39;t be found on one page because unschooling is really about turning  <br/>
your thoughts completely upside down on how kids learn.<br/>
