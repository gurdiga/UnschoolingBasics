<div id="ygrps-yiv-456102673">Hi Chaela,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Virginia.  My son is 5, so I opted him out of kindergarten this year, so we are not &quot;officially homeschooling&quot; in VA yet.  Unless you are a certified teacher, your kids will either have to be tested each year (but only in language arts and math) or you could do a portfolio review.  Most use the CAT test.  There are a bunch of VA Unschooling lists on yahoo groups, based on what part of VA you are in (also check out VA Eclectic).  You should familarize yourself with www.heav.org (Christian-based) and www.vahomeschoolers.org (all-inclusive).  Both of these sites have all the information you need on filing your NOI (notice of intent) to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some!<br/>
<br/>
