<div id="ygrps-yiv-372806179">Okay, I have to share something remarkable with you all. (You all -- not  <br/>
y&#39;all -- this is a NORTHEAST conference.)  I had a really, really, really  good <br/>
time this weekend!<br/>
 <br/>
Conference planning and running is exhausting, and this one certainly was.  <br/>
And it can be stressfull, and there were moments of that too. But I have to say <br/>
 the atmosphere and energy at this conference was amazing and spectacular and <br/>
 sweet and loving and fun and supportive. <br/>
 <br/>
From new unschoolers to oldtimers, from gorgeous wee babes to those  hugging, <br/>
funny teens to caring and working and playing moms and dads, you were  open <br/>
to learning new things, to laughing and finding the joy, and creating  <br/>
community.<br/>
 <br/>
Some moments stand out for me: The glowing, lovely Jillian, who charmed all  <br/>
of us, along with her very cool mama Angel; Our Famous Ren, who along with  <br/>
her two talks and Funshop, also made many of us up for hours, creating an  <br/>
interesting new look for Ben Lovejoy and butterflies for young admirers; the  <br/>
unrelenting, albeit odd, loving support of Jon Kream, and the spectacular arts  and <br/>
crafts room from Rue; the hugs and knowing of Ben and Kelly; the way 25-30  <br/>
people happily worked together to clean the arts and crafts room in less time  <br/>
than we could have imagined; watching Julian spend blissful time with loving  <br/>
looks with his first love; the really neat conference &#39;zine, the DOZENS of  <br/>
people who told me and Beth that this has changed their lives....   Wow...<br/>
 <br/>
You are all amazing and I love you all.<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
