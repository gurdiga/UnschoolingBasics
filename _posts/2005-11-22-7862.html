 </span></blockquote>Not really. But that&#39;s more because we&#39;re not big coffee drinkers <br/>
(the coffee maker is in the closet collecting dust until the next <br/>
time we have guests). If my 7 yr old asked, we&#39;d give him a taste (a <br/>
small serving of his own or a sip from our cup, whichever). Based on <br/>
past history, my guess is he would probably not go for it - unless <br/>
maybe he went for my &#39;doctored&#39; version which is to take a packet of <br/>
instant cocoa, a half tsp or so of sugar, a little dairy (milk, <br/>
cream, half&#39;n&#39;half, but NOT the dry non-dairy stuff), mix that to a <br/>
paste then fill with coffee instead of hot water. Frothy mocha!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087752295">Yes, but not on a regular basis.  Once every so many<br/>
weeks or months my 7yo dd and I will have afternoon<br/>
coffee together.  I fix it up how she likes it but I<br/>
usually only do half a cup of coffee and then add half<br/>
and half for the rest.  Occasionally she&#39;ll have a cup<br/>
for morning.  Nine out of ten times she&#39;ll start the<br/>
morning cup but then go off and play, when she gets<br/>
back it&#39;s cold and nasty so she doesn&#39;t finish it. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475126547">Duncan, nine, is the only one of us who&#39;ll drink coffee. I hate the smell as much as I hate the taste, so I rarely fix it---only for guests, and only when I can get out of that! &lt;G&gt;). When I do, Duncan always asks for a cup (high end, brewed). But we have instant in the cupboard that he drinks *maybe* once or twice a week in the morning. Usually he has hot chocolate at night before bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533585037">My younger kids drink coffee.  Not daily,  usually on weekend mornings when their Dad is home.  Sometimes  it&#39;s decaf, tho usually it&#39;s just regular coffee.  They take it  with some sugar and much more milk than dh does.  Sometimes, we  add chocolate Ovaltine to make mocha coffee.  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don&#39;t drink coffee myself -- just can&#39;t get past the bitter taste,  tho I do love the way it smells. I think mostly their interest in  coffee has to do with being like Daddy, and it probably doesn&#39;t contain  more caffeine than the occasional soda drink.<br/>
  <br/>
  I know that my grandmother began drinking coffee at 6yo, as it was  standard practice in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s to wean kids from milk onto  whatever adults drank.  In her house it was coffee with cream, no  sugar.  My Mom was drinking coffee as a teenager, as did all her  sisters I&#39;m sure.  <br/>

Chai from India is a spiced milk tea that has become increasingly popular<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; throught the world. It is generally made up of:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; � rich black tea<br/>
&gt; � heavy milk<br/>
&gt; � a combination of various spices<br/>
&gt; � a sweetner<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The spices used vary from region to region and among households in India.<br/>
&gt; The most common are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and pepper. Indian<br/>
&gt; chai produces a warming, soothing effect, acts as a natural digestive aid<br/>
&gt; and gives one a wonderful sense of well being. It&#39;s difficult to resist a<br/>
&gt; second cup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use half and half and honey (unlike regular tea, the milk or cream is<br/>
important in chai).<br/>

Chai from India is a spiced milk tea that has become increasingly popular<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; throught the world. It is generally made up of:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  rich black tea<br/>
&gt;  heavy milk<br/>
&gt;  a combination of various spices<br/>
&gt;  a sweetner<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The spices used vary from region to region and among households in India.<br/>
&gt; The most common are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and pepper. Indian<br/>
&gt; chai produces a warming, soothing effect, acts as a natural digestive aid<br/>
&gt; and gives one a wonderful sense of well being. It&#39;s difficult to resist a<br/>
&gt; second cup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use half and half and honey (unlike regular tea, the milk or cream is<br/>
important in chai).<br/>

&gt; &gt; (high end, brewed). But we have instant in the cupboard that he drinks<br/>
&gt; &gt; *maybe* once or twice a week in the morning. Usually he has hot<br/>

&gt; &gt; night before bed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; My younger kids drink coffee. Not daily, usually on weekend mornings when<br/>

&gt; Sometimes, we add chocolate Ovaltine to make mocha coffee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t drink coffee myself -- just can&#39;t get past the bitter taste, tho I<br/>
&gt; do love the way it smells. I think mostly their interest in coffee has to do<br/>
&gt; with being like Daddy, and it probably doesn&#39;t contain more caffeine than<br/>
&gt; the occasional soda drink.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that my grandmother began drinking coffee at 6yo, as it was<br/>
&gt; standard practice in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s to wean kids from milk onto whatever<br/>
&gt; adults drank. In her house it was coffee with cream, no sugar. My Mom was<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter (13) loves decaf iced coffee!   She doesn&#39;t have it much <br/>
in the winter, maybe one every couple of weeks (it varies) in the <br/>
warmer weather.  She also loves coffee ice cream.   We were on <br/>
vacation in Provincetown (the tip of Cape Cod) and she wanted an iced <br/>
coffee, but it had caffeine (a small &quot;fancy&quot; coffee shop), which <br/>
aggravated her bladder and she had to hit the bathroom a lot, so she <br/>
staying away from caffeine in coffee, but still loves decaf iced.<br/>
<br/>
I had to give it up, the caffeine gave me heart palpitations and upset <br/>
my &quot;final&quot; digestion and I don&#39;t like hot decaf (although I&#39;ll <br/>
occassionally do a decaf iced).   We also like tea, (the caffeine in <br/>
tea doesn&#39;t do the same thing, go figure), with just sugar (she likes <br/>
it that way too, dh has it with milk and sugar, funny how you pick up <br/>
your preferences for things like that).<br/>

Espresso drinks actually have less caffeine than regular drip coffee. The taste is so strong that you use very little in each drink, just a shot or two.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466676705">I have a good friend whose 3-year-old drinks coffee with cream. Does  <br/>
that count? He likes to sip it out of espresso cups, and it has to be  <br/>
coffee--warm milk, for instance, is not an acceptable substitute. He  <br/>
likes to have his coffee poured out of her cup into his, so part of  <br/>
the appeal for him is sharing what she has. She has not worried about  <br/>
it even when people seem to look at her askance because he does not  <br/>
seem to have any adverse reactions to the amount of caffeine he is  <br/>
getting, and he really loves it. Also, she has had people say to her,  <br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re letting him drink coffee!&quot; while their kid is  <br/>
two feet away drinking a half-liter bottle of Coke, so it seems to  <br/>
her that &quot;coffee is not for kids&quot; is a pretty arbitrary decision for  <br/>
some people, rather than being out of a concern about caffeine or  <br/>
nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
Until I met her, I would not have let my kids have coffee. I would  <br/>
have said, &quot;Not for babies!&quot; But her argument is so reasonable, it  <br/>
convinced me. So now if my 20-month-old asks for a sip out of my cup,  <br/>
I will let him try it. Usually one sip is enough for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984526560">Our children (ages 15 & 13, and even our 4  year old sometimes) drink it occasionally, however, I used to forbid it  a couple years ago.  When I was growing up, I was not allowed to  drink it.  I could also not drink tea (hot or cold) when I was  younger.  So, when I became a mom, I did it this way too, thinking  that the caffiene was not good for them.  But, I let them drink  soda -- not a lot when they were younger, but more as they became teens<br/>
  <br/>
  Hubby is a big coffee drinker -- he drinks it everyday.  When we  began unschooling, I started thinking more about why I didn&#39;t allow it  and decided that I would leave the choice to the kids.  So, maybe  once a week or so, Noelle will get herself a cup.  Our 13-year-old  likes it too, but drinks it less often.  They also really like  frappachinos and such from places like Starbucks or other  coffeehouses.   Noelle and I really like drinking tea though,  so we tend to go for that more.  <br/>

When I designed a play set in Russia we borrowed a Samovar and a set of<br/>
glasses with the little metal holders - kind of a delicate filigree with a<br/>
handle. You may be able to find something that you like by searching Russian<br/>
importers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144198354">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Does anyone here have kids (under 16) who drink coffee? I&#39;m in a<br/>
discussion about it at work. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn, now 6, does periodically. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I said at the conference on the topic:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; For a while Jayn always wanted a coffee when we went to our local<br/>
store, which gives out samples. The first time she had some, she went a<br/>
little wild – evidently caught unawares by the energizing effect of<br/>
caffeine. Subsequently however I guess she knew what to expect, and after<br/>
listening to my concerns that I really needed her to be calm and pleasant at<br/>
the store, she assured me that she wouldn’t go crazy, and she never did<br/>
again – at least not in relation to having a coffee. It was only in<br/>
preparing this presentation that I realized that she hasn’t asked for a<br/>
coffee for a while. Apparently she’s had all she wants for the time<br/>
being.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Ah..yes.  I would really love for you to bring those cups to <br/>
Albuquerque Pam, how cool.<br/>
I adore those Russian Samovars and have been planning to buy one for a <br/>
while. Off to persue the web once again...thanks everyone.<br/>

Occasionally my daughter (14) and I will have lattes. The espresso in  <br/>
them is stronger than coffee (but doesn&#39;t leave that nasty sour taste  <br/>
that coffee seems to.) She hasn&#39;t shown any interest in regular coffee.<br/>

  Still catching up....<br/>
   <br/>
  I work at a coffee hut on weekends and one of the first things that I learned is that the caffine in a normal espresso drink is less than a coffee of the same size.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sooo, a lg. coffee(20oz) has @5 times the amount of caffine as a mocha or latte of the same size.<br/>
   <br/>
  The sour taste left by coffee has a LOT to do with the roasting process the bean is the same. Most coffee, if gotten at a shop, has also sat in a caraf for a while, depending on the day and how busy we are, our coffee may sit for hours, by the endof the day it is really bitter. Espresso shots are brewed fresh and the process is much faster than brewing coffee. Coffee done in a French Press tends to be less bitter as well. Oh, and the quality of your water is really important, tap water can change the taste and bitterness of your coffee as well.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry if that was waayy more info than anyone wanted about coffee, I&#39;m recouping from a very busy and long weekend at work with coffee thoughts and talk floating around my brain...:p<br/>

Espresso drinks actually have less caffeine than regular drip coffee. The taste is so strong that you use very little in each drink, just a shot or two.<br/>

I would love to find those glasses. If they&#39;re anything like the <br/>
glasses in the  movie &quot;house of sand and fog&quot;...I WANT some.  <br/>
I don&#39;t remember if that family was Turkish though.<br/>
They served tea in little glasses with a metal handle. I adored them <br/>
and have been looking for that style ever since.<br/>
<br/>
btw, it&#39;s really good to have you here Christie...we miss you.:)<br/>
