<div id="ygrps-yiv-679517432">Hi Sher. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome! You&#39;re in the right place to learn about unschooling. :-)<br/>
May I suggest reading some of the older posts? There is so much <br/>
information there and you can read it in your own time. <br/>
<br/>
For me personally, I found that before I could really start <br/>
unschooling, I had to look at myself and the way I thought about <br/>
education. <br/>
<br/>
Good for you for reaching out and wanting something better for your <br/>
son. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s reading while playing games.  Trust me.  That&#39;s how my son learned to<br/>
read.  There is SO much reading in most of the video games today.<br/>
Characters talking to each other, finding out new clues or directions, and<br/>
all the signs and symbols used in video games.  Also, I have found that<br/>
video games eventually lead kids to want to read other things.  For instance<br/>
let&#39;s say that your child is playing Kingdom Hearts (a recent favorite in<br/>
our house.)  That leads to them wanting the KH players book which is filled<br/>
with statistics on all the characters, ways to defeat Oogie Boogie, and sub<br/>
story lines that you wouldn&#39;t get if you just played the game.  From that it<br/>
leads to the child wanting to watch the movie Hercules (for clues of course)<br/>
and then the child says, &quot;Mom, how accurate is Disney&#39;s version of<br/>
Hercules?&quot;  So you run to the bookstore (or library) and get a book about<br/>
the Greek and Roman dieties and the next day your son shows up to breakfast<br/>
in a bedsheet.  :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a day in the life of an unschooler.  Video games, movies, books and<br/>
bedsheets.  I think my big turning point between being an eclectic relaxed<br/>
homeschooler and being a radical unschooler was when I allowed myself to<br/>
play and create.  When I stopped giving myself, &quot;you shoulds.&quot;  I realized<br/>
that many of the things that I thought I &quot;should&quot; do are society imposed.<br/>
Aside from the things that really need to be done (like pay bills, and keep<br/>
a sanitary house (note I didn&#39;t say clean as a whistle LOL!) and keep up<br/>
with my business contacts) there isn&#39;t a lot that I *need* to do.  I allowed<br/>
a set of societal &quot;norms&quot; dictate my life.  And my life really isn&#39;t all<br/>
that &quot;normal.&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
To unschool YOU must learn to have fun too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981802701"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I think Ren had a questionaire that went thru<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something like this.<br/>
<br/>
**I saved Ren&#39;s questionnaire - it&#39;ll be added to .info&#39;s collected posts<br/>
next time I update.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted the conference version, but could NOT find the original<br/>
of this &quot;test&quot; I&#39;ve used at various talks.<br/>
<br/>
Finally found it last night...the joys of moving eh?<br/>
<br/>
1) List all the ways you&#39;ve earned an income in your life:<br/>
   (include side jobs and career paths)<br/>
<br/>
2) List some hobbies you pursue in your leisure time:<br/>
<br/>
3)What are driving passions and interests that make life meaningful<br/>
and fulfilling for you?<br/>
<br/>
4)List ALL the interests you would like to pursue or learn about<br/>
before you die?<br/>
<br/>
5)What would you be doing right now if there were NO obstacles in<br/>
your path?  (dream big)<br/>
<br/>
After the participants fill this out, I have them tally up all the<br/>
items listed. THEN, have them go back through the list and tally up<br/>
how many of those items they got proficient at, by attending school,<br/>
or COULD have gotten proficient at by attending school (through 12th<br/>
grade, not counting college or any post high-school since that isn&#39;t<br/>
compulsory).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a variety of answers, but it does get people thinking<br/>
about how meaningful the learning is that happens outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Some other questions I added, but only did verbally;<br/>
<br/>
How many of you have one or more degrees?<br/>
Of the people that have degrees, how many of you are actually using<br/>
that degree in your work today?<br/>
If you are using your degree today, do you really LOVE your work?Are<br/>
you passionate about what you do?<br/>
<br/>
This might be a good &quot;quiz&quot; for those reluctant partners. If they&#39;re<br/>
willing to play around with it, it could get them thinking about the<br/>
ways that humans really learn in a meaningful way.<br/>

My son&#39;s writing skills are getting better each day from his intense gaming, online role playing, and emailing. He&#39;s gone from a kid who HATED to write to one who writes for purpose and pleasure. <br/>
<br/>
Right now though I&#39;d suggest just taking a complete school vacation. Deschooling we call it. It will give you all time to reconnect, regroup and heal from the forced teaching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629632434">It really helped that back when I joined there was a thread going on that<br/>
everyone was writing what they and the kids were doing. So, I am going to<br/>
start it again.<br/>
<br/>
Today I got up late, around 9:30, started a load of laundry, my new habit, I<br/>
am a flybaby. Checked my email, made some phone calls... a fellow<br/>
homeschoolers had a doctor&#39;s appointment for her youngest and asked if I<br/>
would watch the other two and she dropped them off at around 10. The oldest<br/>
woke my son up. While he worked on waking up I put in Chicken Little.<br/>
<br/>
While his friends watched tv, we had a discussion about Zombies. We are a<br/>
family of horror movie watchers, but I really don&#39;t know where the question<br/>
came from. I answered the questions that he asked.<br/>
<br/>
Their mom got back right about the time the movie was over and by that time<br/>
my son had decided he was going outside to dig and &quot;plant seeds.&quot; We have a<br/>
ton of Hibiscus bushes and he likes to break the pods open and plant the<br/>
seeds.<br/>
<br/>
When he came in he got out his computer game book and picked Chicka Chicka<br/>
Boom Boom. He played while I went to lay his sister (15 months) down for a<br/>
nap. When I came out, I asked him if there was anything he wanted to do with<br/>
just me since DD was asleep.<br/>
<br/>
We spent most the afternoon excavating bones from a Dino Kit and putting the<br/>
bones together. Then he spent the rest of the time until his dad got home<br/>
breaking the rest of the brick to tiny bits. We cleaned up and then he<br/>
painted the Saber Tooth Cat with water paints.<br/>
<br/>
Now we are watching Shaun of the Dead because it was the least scary Zombie<br/>
movie since DS was asking again and again to watch a Zombie movie. DH and DS<br/>
are watching in the kitchen and discussing the movie while playing blocks on<br/>
the kitchen table.<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like a nice idea.  I usually blog about my day, but I&#39;ll <br/>
add a little here, too.  <br/>
This morning we got up at 12:30 when my mom called and said, &quot;The <br/>
birthday party starts at 1:30!&quot;  We hurried and got ready and went to <br/>
her house for my nephew&#39;s birthday party.  The girls played inside and <br/>
out...it snowed some and they had a blast in that!  They started a <br/>
club, Nature Protectors, I think.  &quot;To investigate and protect nature&quot; <br/>
is what they told me was their motto was.  They played a long time <br/>
with the birthday candles...the kind that won&#39;t blow out. :)  When <br/>
they got tired they watched some movies and my older dd took a bath.  <br/>
 When we came home they started playing on the computer.  They started <br/>
with a Barbie game and now they are playing something else with Daddy, <br/>
but I haven&#39;t gone in to see what game it is.  It sounds like they are <br/>
fishing or something.  Dd10 just said &quot;It said that one was, like, 28 <br/>
pounds.&quot;  lol<br/>
I am going to go clean the kitchen, cook, and start a load of <br/>
laundry.  While we eat we will probably watch a movie, then the tv <br/>
will probably be on the rest of the evening, one or both might go back <br/>
to the computer.  My older dd will probably go to bed at about 12, but <br/>
the younger will go about 3.  <br/>
AHHH, just another lovely day. :)<br/>
