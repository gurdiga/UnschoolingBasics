<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857751221">&quot;I guess this is my fear. I don&#39;t want my daughter to be<br/>
without guidance because I see the irreversable dicisions I made<br/>
under this type of parenting. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stick around...you&#39;ll see many examples that show just how involved <br/>
and focused these unschooling parents are.:)<br/>
<br/>
My children trust my guidance because it isn&#39;t offered up with <br/>
punishment. I DO believe in being an example and I don&#39;t control <br/>
anything that doesn&#39;t need controlling. They are free to be who they <br/>
are, but they also know I&#39;m totally available.<br/>
<br/>
I get a bit coercive if anyone is trying to harm themselves or <br/>
others....and occasionally the house is SO disgusting, that I&#39;ll be <br/>
a bit more forward than usual. &quot;I have to have help today, when can <br/>
you help me out?&quot; might happen if I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed. Not &quot;WILL <br/>
you help me?&quot; but &quot;WHEN will you help me?&quot; :)<br/>
They have so much freedom and lead such happy lives overall, that <br/>
they&#39;re really very receptive when I reach that point.<br/>
I try to always help them with everything....bringing drinks and <br/>
food to each other (rather than the &quot;get it yourself&quot; that I often <br/>
got as a child or &quot;your legs look healthy to me&quot;), helping each <br/>
other clean or cook or many other kindnesses that help this family <br/>
be more peaceful.<br/>
There are crabby/tense moments, we&#39;re all human. But the unschooling <br/>
philosophies have changed our lives dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about leaving kids to figure things out on their own, and <br/>
it&#39;s not about controlling their choices. Unschooling is the <br/>
opposite of neglect, it takes a ton of energy and time to make it <br/>
joyful and bubbly the way it should be. But as the kids get older, I <br/>
think it&#39;s the easier route...because the focus is on happy, strong, <br/>
respectful relationships and when you have those, everything else in <br/>
life just falls into place.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, I needed to hear that.  I can see that after reading more <br/>
the last few days.  It&#39;s good to know that guidance is hugely there <br/>
and that the idea is to still step in when absolutely necessary.  <br/>
I&#39;m glad to be here!<br/>
