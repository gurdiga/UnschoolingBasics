<div id="ygrps-yiv-965310176">We also like &quot;Set&quot; since just about any age can play it. I bought &quot;5 <br/>
Crowns&quot; last year, but we haven&#39;t pulled that one out yet.<br/>
<br/>
This new game store we discovered, has a really intense strategy <br/>
game based on WW11, called &quot;Memoir 44&quot;.  Jared was at a friend&#39;s <br/>
house this week and apparently they both loved it. It looked a bit <br/>
complicated to me, but if you have any gamers that like fantasy or <br/>
war game type stuff, they might love it.<br/>
He also asked me to buy &quot;heroscape&quot;, which has a 3-dimensional <br/>
playing board and cool fantasy pieces to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
I was also told at that store, that many girls (and some guys) are <br/>
really hooked on this game called &quot;Killer Bunnies&quot;. Too <br/>
funny...reminds me of Monty Python&#39;s &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;.  So we&#39;ve got <br/>
some new ones to try.<br/>
<br/>
Brandie also recommended the Sudoku (sp?) games...we haven&#39;t really <br/>
checked it out yet. Sounds like something my dh would love, he&#39;s so <br/>
dang good at brain teasers and puzzles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008637288">Oh! I forgot to mention scrabble the first time, which is definitely <br/>
a favorite at our house. Sometimes it is difficult to play with young <br/>
kids because their vocabularies are not as large as an adult&#39;s, but <br/>
my dd doesn&#39;t seem to care. For example, I would generally *go easy* <br/>
on a young child in a game so that we could both enjoy ourselves, but <br/>
with scrabble my dd really LIKES to see the &quot;advanced&quot; or otherwise <br/>
cool moves. So I just play like I would with anyone else and neither <br/>
of us cares about the scorecard.<br/>
<br/>
We also like Quiddler, which has elements in common with scrabble in <br/>
that you make words out of a group of letters, only it is a card <br/>
rather than board game.<br/>
<br/>
Other fun ones include Connect 4 and Equate (like scrabble only with <br/>
math equations). Sometimes I play variations of Nim with my daughter <br/>
which is sort of a mathy/logic game, but we can only play because she <br/>
hasn&#39;t yet realized that you are guaranteed to win if you go first <br/>
(and use the right strategy). So she always goes first. :) She likes <br/>
the Sudoku puzzles as well, but I&#39;m not really a fan of them.<br/>
