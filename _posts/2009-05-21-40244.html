It may not be possible with the mix of kids you have or with the expectations of the parents that you have. You may need to transition from a &quot;daycare&quot; if those rules hold you back. You may need to rethink about those rules. Pick one and figure out what it really requires at a minimum and whether you want to live with that. Then figure out how you can comply with the rule and live as you like and treat the children the way you would like to treat your child. Etc. It would take some step-by-step work, approaching each decision from a new perspective. But this is about figuring out how you want to live. How you want your child to live. <br/>
<br/>
It is not at all the same thing, but I run a private school. It is for unschoolers and other hsers in my state. There are some regulations that I have to comply with. But these do not at all impact the families or my own family in the way we live as unschoolers. I fill out the forms and count the heads and collect paperwork and it is all completely meaningless and disconnected from our actual lives. <br/>
<br/>
But I could be very schoolish in the way I run my school. Beyond the minimum the law requires from the families (attendance and enrollment paperwork), the school owner can require the students and their families to do all sorts of things. If I had it in my head that everyone needed to send me a report on their activities, or read a certain curriculum, or meet once a month, or whatever, I could require that. Many schools do require these things. But they are not required by law. Of course, many people want that additional interaction and/or oversight. Some parents new to my school have a hard time not reporting additional information to me. But the law does not require more than X and I don&#39;t require more than X. (It&#39;s not a &quot;homeschool freedom&quot; or any other sort of battle for me -- it&#39;s just how I live.) <br/>
<br/>
All to say that complying with regulations does not always have to determine the actual content of your life. And that I hope you find a way to have it all -- your business (in whatever form) and your family&#39;s happiness. :)<br/>

&quot;PS I would love to run an unschool daycare and kind of do, but there<br/>
are regulations I need to follow to be licensed so running a true<br/>
unschooling daycare wouldn&#39;t be possible.  If anyone wants to chat more<br/>

Thanks for the advice, I think that is how I look at it.  I operate my program in accordance with the regulations, but I don&#39;t let it dictate what I do in my day to day interactions with the kids.  I have a schedule and curriculum, but I go with the flow of the children.   If they are happy free playing I don&#39;t stop them to do a &quot;planned&quot; activity (I have an activity planned for each day that ties in with the theme of the month).  I am required to have a curriculum as proof I am teaching so I create it but don&#39;t always get to the activity.  I usually put out various materials such a books and toys that relate to the theme so the children are exposed to the concepts but in a way that fits their interests.  Of course I realize that everything they do is learning, but I need proof for my licensor so I develop a theme and concrete activities.  <br/>
<br/>
If it is nice out we&#39;ll stay outside and play instead of coming in at a particular time just because it is the scheduled lunch time.  I don&#39;t require children to give up bottles or other objects they need for comfort just because they are a certain age (I know of other daycares that do).  My goal is to nurture each child and provide a safe and stimulating environment.   <br/>
<br/>
The beauty of having the daycare is that I try to fit it around my family not the other way around.  I operate on a school calendar (closed whenever the school are) and am done by 3:30-4pm.  I also only work 4 days a week.  So far the parents have been very accommodating with my schedule and have often picked up early if I needed to be somewhere for my older dd.  It is far from perfect and does not allow me to fully embrace an unschooling lifestyle but it is what works for now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jen<br/>
