<div id="ygrps-yiv-702188828">Hello everyone - <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve got a question, one that I&#39;ve struggled with since my two<br/>
were born (my son is 8 and my daughter is almost 11 now).  How do we,<br/>
as a family, weave together everyone&#39;s desires when it comes to<br/>
sleeping, beds, and sex (okay, so the sex has to do with me and my Hot<br/>
Hubby, not the kids)?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got:<br/>
<br/>
I love it when my kids sleep in my bed with me.  <br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t like it.  <br/>
Our kids LOVE to sleep in our bed with us.<br/>
<br/>
We have a king size bed.<br/>
The kids each have full size beds (one is a loft bed my husband built<br/>
for my daughter)<br/>
<br/>
My husband sometimes falls asleep on the couch (although, now that I<br/>
am NOT harshly judging the TV and computer, he is more likely to<br/>
follow me up to bed when I go up around 9 or 10 pm.  THANK YOU<br/>
un-schoolers for leading me to accepting and rejoicing in the<br/>
pleasures of TV and computers!!!  My family is much more happy now!!)<br/>
<br/>
I am tired at night and usually want to fall asleep around 9 pm.<br/>
I love getting up early!<br/>
I have rheumatoid arthritis, and sometimes sleeping with kids snuggled<br/>
up against my body makes me ache more.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and son love to sleep in late and go to bed late.<br/>
<br/>
My son and daughter typically come up to bed when I go up and they<br/>
love to snuggle with me in my bed and fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is easily transferred to her bed when HH comes up (at<br/>
least, she will go there and not come back later).  Although, if she<br/>
knows that we are going to ask her to move to her bed during the<br/>
night, she will usually want to fall asleep in her bed.  Getting up<br/>
into a loft while she is half asleep doesn&#39;t feel safe to her.<br/>
<br/>
My son can be carried to his bed, but when he wakes up he comes in and<br/>
asks to get into our bed, at which point, my husband yells &quot;NO!&quot; and<br/>
then there is a back and forth all night long, or my son turns on his<br/>
I-pod stories in his bedroom so that we all can hear, or loudly calls<br/>
the dog to his bed.  This can go on throughout the night and into the<br/>
morning until my sweet son sneaks his way into our bed again (usually<br/>
after I am up and about for the morning).<br/>
<br/>
My daughter gets jealous if her brother is sleeping in my bed and she<br/>
is not.  Same is true the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
If I am in the middle of the bed, which is where everyone wants me so<br/>
that they can be next to me, my body aches!!  I need room to move<br/>
around and get comfortable.  Rheumatoid arthritis is often worse at night.<br/>
<br/>
And, where in all of this do Hot Hubby and I fit sex??<br/>
<br/>
One thought I had, was to let the kids know that we will be going to<br/>
the bedroom for a while after dinner a couple of nights each week, and<br/>
they can enjoy TV or reading or what ever, on their own.  And, that<br/>
this would let mom and dad get some time to connect, which would make<br/>
sleeping arrangements more flexible.  <br/>
<br/>
I like this idea because it makes our couple time intentional, rather<br/>
than a catch as catch can.  <br/>
<br/>
Within flexible sleeping arrangements, we would all need to be<br/>
sensitive to the fact that I need SPACE in which to feel comfortable<br/>
while I sleep.  So, maybe some brainstorming around how to help mommy<br/>
feel comfortable at night, could also help.  (of course, HH&#39;s answer<br/>
to that is make the kids sleep in their own beds, where they belong!!<br/>
 So, perhaps some more advice on husbands would help here.)<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of my idea??<br/>
Does anyone have any other ideas or experience??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
:):):) That&#39;s a great idea and a great start!  Sex and sleeping are <br/>
two sperate and very enjoyable actitivies in our houses.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Within flexible sleeping arrangements, we would all need to be<br/>
sensitive to the fact that I need SPACE in which to feel comfortable<br/>
while I sleep. So, maybe some brainstorming around how to help mommy<br/>
feel comfortable at night, could also help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:):):) First not knowing to much about your conditon, I would ask, is <br/>
there anything you can do for yourself to easy the discomfort, before <br/>
and during sleep, like a hot bath, a heating blanket (does heat help <br/>
or hinder RA pain?), maybe a &#39;special&#39; massage from said Hotty DH.<br/>
<br/>
Second I would share that we 4 (DD&#39;s 8&10,DH, me) also mostly sleep <br/>
on one King size bed.....and we are seriously considering moving a <br/>
double bed that we have in our spare room, into our small master <br/>
room, along with pulling out some of the dressers..and making what <br/>
would be my fantasy all &#39;Bed&#39; room.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about making really simple changes in the way your precieve <br/>
things ought to be...for instance in our home both DD&#39;s have thier <br/>
own bedrooms, and to anyone else that is exactly what they look <br/>
like...bedrooms...but we know different, thier beds are extra comphy <br/>
extended play/cudddle areas, thier draws, places to keep thier toys <br/>
and treasures in.  Just a shift!  In fact the joke in our house is... <br/>
that we all have our own closet! <br/>
<br/>
Hope this gets ya thinking...it is possible.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something that wasn&#39;t clear to me is where the kids beds are in <br/>
relation to the &quot;family&quot; bed? It can be really helpful to have extra <br/>
beds or even simple &quot;nests&quot; on the floor next to where the parents <br/>
are sleeping (or even in a big closet, weird as that sounds) - it can <br/>
provide enough separation for aching bodies *and* grownup fun while <br/>
still letting the kids be close to mom and dad for comfort. Its also <br/>
much much easier to shift a child Down than up or even over, iykwim? <br/>
<br/>
Something else to consider... do you and dh need that king size bed <br/>
if its just the two of you? I mean really physically need that much <br/>
space? You could keep that as the family bed, you see, and you and dh <br/>
have a separate bed of y&#39;all&#39;s own - you and he could move, rather <br/>
than shifting the kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764260838">Sex? Kids go to sleep and we have the whole house for ourselves!<br/>
It can be tricky but since I go to bed late dh has asked me to wake him up.<br/>
We have also sneaked when kids where happily playing during the day.<br/>
I also found out that flirting and being more physical with my dh makes him feel happy and wanted/desired.<br/>
