<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002145768">The DS Lite has a brighter backlit screen. In comparing them side by side,<br/>
the difference really is huge. The game is just so much easier to see with<br/>
the Lite.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I haven&#39;t found any difference except the slight change in<br/>
shape that isn&#39;t really that noticable.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re buying one, I&#39;d definatly go for the Lite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745727751">The lite is smaller and lighter  and the do a little better in more light. That is it. They are the same in any other way. OH the little stencil pen is thicker in the lite also.&#92;&#92;<br/>
We have both and like both.<br/>
I see they started to show up at the stores again so I would wait just a couple more weeks so not to pay more thatn $129 for the lite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366259423">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
Liam actually discovered on the lite a couple of nights ago that you can adjust the brightness of the screen; so make it duller for use in the sunlight and brighter for night time use. I can&#39;t remember how he did it, I think he pressed one of the (A, B, X, Y) buttons whilst onthe opening screen (before you log in to the game).<br/>

  Where do you live that stores have Nintendos?  I called every Target, Toys R Us, Circuit City, Best Buy and Game Stop in Albuquerque (I even called the evil Wal-mart) -- no one has even one.  They don&#39;t really expect any til next month, but can&#39;t know for sure since Nintendo gives no advance notice of what/when they&#39;re shipping to retailers.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I was asking because I&#39;d gone online and found some regular DS&#39;s at amazon.com for reasonable prices --- all the DS Lites at ebay and amazon are $200 or more.<br/>
