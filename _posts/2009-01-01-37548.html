Origin and First Use of the Word �Yooper�<br/>
Twenty-nine years ago today on August 5th, 1979 the Upper Peninsula�s  <br/>
identity changed forever. That date marks the earliest known  <br/>
publication of the word �Yooper�.<br/>
Contrary to popular belief, the term Yooper isn�t very old. Many  <br/>
people who recall going to college in the Upper Peninsula during the  <br/>
�70s do not recall use of the word. However, there are others that  <br/>
argue the word was still in use earlier than 1979, but there is a  <br/>
lack of evidence to support this. By all means, if you know of  <br/>
additional evidence to support the first uses of the term Yooper, we  <br/>
would like to know.<br/>
<br/>
According to an article by Professor Richard W. Bailey at the  <br/>
University of Michigan, it was The American Heritage dictionary that  <br/>
discovered the first published use of the word Yooper.<br/>
<br/>
On August 5th, 1979 the Escanaba Daily Press hosted a competition for  <br/>
people to come up with the best word to describe residents of  <br/>
Michigan�s Upper Peninsula. For those out there who have laughed at  <br/>
the word Yooper, take a look at some of the other nominations that  <br/>
day in the newspaper�<br/>
<br/>
Skeeter-eater (as in mosquitoes)<br/>
Michupper<br/>
Bush turkey<br/>
Pastian (as in pasty)<br/>
After seeing a few of the other submissions, Yooper seems to be as  <br/>
good of choice as any.<br/>
<br/>
Brett Crawford of Bark River was credited to submitting the term  <br/>
Yooper, and he will forever go down in history as a legend, creating  <br/>
one of the greatest influences in Upper Peninsula history.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Yooper is derived from the abbreviation of Upper Peninsula  <br/>
(U.P.) plus �-er�. As in, �He�s a U.P.-er�. Bailey reported that the  <br/>
Pittsburgh Press used the term spelled as U.P.-er in a 1987 edition.  <br/>
That was 21 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the term Yooper is still being published in mass media and was  <br/>
recently used by Stephen King in his latest novel. It has also been  <br/>
used in one episode of Jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
To date, The American Heritage dictionary remains the only dictionary  <br/>
to recognize Yooper as an official word�<br/>
<br/>
SYLLABICATION: Yoo�per<br/>
NOUN: A native or inhabitant of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.<br/>
ETYMOLOGY: From UP.<br/>
