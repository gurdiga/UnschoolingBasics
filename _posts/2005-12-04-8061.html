<div id="ygrps-yiv-245601070">Hello to Everyone -<br/>
<br/>
I am so happy to have found this group!  Our family has homeschooled <br/>
for 5 yrs now.  When I first heard about unschooling I ran the gamut of <br/>
opinions - from shocked to curious and intrigued.  I tried deschooling <br/>
last year but went back to &quot;the schedule&quot; when I felt our day was too <br/>
unstructured. It&#39;s been a slow process, but over the last few months I <br/>
have come to realize that the routine of rushing my children (12 yo dd, <br/>
7 yo dd, 7 yo ds) to get up, eat breakfast, brush teeth, and do <br/>
school.....was no longer working for us.  My 7 yo son was the catalyst <br/>
in this revelation, as he had become increasingly unhappy and <br/>
disinterested in his schoolwork.  My girls (especially the 12 yo) are <br/>
what you might deem the &quot;studious&quot; type, so they didn&#39;t complain much.  <br/>
Still, I knew in my heart something had to change.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the past few months we threw caution (and curricula :) to the <br/>
wind and just started living life.  We are enjoying and appreciating <br/>
one another so much more now....I sure wish I&#39;d started sooner.  Though <br/>
I am tempted to beat myself up over it (spending all those years re-<br/>
creating school at home), I know that doing so won&#39;t help us.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Kids Learn&quot; and &quot;Learning All the Time,&quot; and <br/>
Thomas Armstrong&#39;s &quot;In Their Own Way.&quot;  Next on my list is Alfie <br/>
Cohen&#39;s &quot;Punished by Rewards.&quot;  If anyone has other reading suggestions <br/>
that may be helpful to me, I would love to hear them.  <br/>

Thank you for sticking with this rather long-winded intro :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603651381">Hi, Sharon!  I&#39;m Anastasia, from MI also.  We&#39;re deschooling right now, first year home together, having fun and witnessing changes in our lives and relationships.  I just got done reading John Holt&#39;s, &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  It was as good as the other two of his books you mentioned, and got down to the business of unschooling as a concrete day-to-day thing, not just a bunch of ideas.  How was the Thomas Armstrong book?  I don&#39;t think I have that one on my to-read list yet.<br/>
   <br/>
  Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you!  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check our library for &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  If they don&#39;t have it, <br/>
I&#39;ll hunt it down :)    <br/>
<br/>
The Thomas Armstrong book helps you find your child&#39;s personal <br/>
learning style and work with it.  It gets a bit more in depth than <br/>
other learning styles books I&#39;ve read.  He describes 7 distinct <br/>
styles, and feels that most of us have characteristics from more than <br/>
one.  Linguistic, spatial, kinesthetic, logical-mathematical, <br/>
musical, inter-personal, and intra-personal.  Also talks about <br/>
turning some of the labels kids get saddled with (refers to them <br/>
as &quot;lead&quot;) into &quot;gold.&quot;  Learning disabled/learning different; <br/>
agressive/assertive; plodding/thorough; daydreaming/imaginative; <br/>
phobic/cautious; irritable/sensitive.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all, I thought it was worth reading and I think I gained some <br/>
insight into my own kids personal styles.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the welcome :)<br/>
