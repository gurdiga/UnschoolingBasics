<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056634437">I want to, and need to, apologize for my terse outburst over the seatbelt <br/>
issue. That, and the dentist, are trigger issues for me because of real life <br/>
experiences that were terrifying, and led to sadly unpleasant long term strife.  <br/>
When I reread my post today, I was surprised at how angry and fearful it <br/>
sounded.  I know that I am angry and fearful and depressed, but I was surprised that <br/>
it leaked so heavily into my post! I am stuck in a loop of &#39;avoiding agony&#39;, <br/>
so a logical philosophical question turned into a diatribe on life and death <br/>
extremes.  Sorry, for bringing my baggage along here.<br/>
As Shannon, who is rather new to unschooling, was asking about the <br/>
temperament and habits of other unschooling parents on safety topics, somehow my demons <br/>
were unleashed.  <br/>
I was not suggesting that anyone force or coerce a child to do anything, but <br/>
that the adults set the standard and must figure how to make it work, and not <br/>
drive until it is safe as can be, within our power. So I was agreeing with <br/>
Shannon&#39;s perspective.  It was the other mom&#39;s complaint, arguing to let her kid <br/>
be unbuckled while in someone else&#39;s car, that really set me off. [And what <br/>
would any of us seatbelt advocates do, if instead, the other mom had been the <br/>
driver?  If we were riding with a family who, we discovered on the spot, did not <br/>
buckle in? It is their car and their choice.  I would still ride along that <br/>
one time, buckled in, without making a scene. But probably not ever again, <br/>
without some discussion about it]          <br/>
Other than a few times when my kids were infants rejecting their carseats, we <br/>
rarely had battles over seat restraints. As infants, there was no reasoning <br/>
conversation to be had, only the empathetic energy of mother and child. So we <br/>
might sit in the car nursing and listening to music, or play babygames, or take <br/>
a catnap until we could drive safely.  Several times I repositioned the <br/>
carseat or cover, and it seemed to help. No big deal. The buckles were as necessary <br/>
as the key, to get the motor running.  When they were older, if there was <br/>
resistance to getting in the car, it was about a real stuff that we tried to deal <br/>
with in the moment, negotiating rather than enforcing. <br/>
For me, as a long time unschooler, the real struggle happens when a child&#39;s <br/>
absolute refusal conflicts with some kind of real deadline. If that occurs once <br/>
in a while, each situation is different and adaptable.  If it is occurring <br/>
every week, then IMO, it is up to the parent to get to the root reality, and to <br/>
adjust their own schedule, or their attitude, or the overall atmosphere as <br/>
necessary, without relinquishing anyone&#39;s safety.<br/>
Again sorry for the tirade.  I usually wait overnight, and reread or edit, <br/>
before posting emotional responses anywhere. <br/>

Hugs Robin. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling depressed. Can we help? I&#39;ve been there, believe me!!<br/>
