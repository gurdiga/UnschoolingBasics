<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820758342">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for someone willing to write back and forth to me off <br/>
list.  Probably at first suggesting reading material (I&#39;m overwhelmed <br/>
with all that&#39;s out there and I just haven&#39;t picked a place to start <br/>
yet) and maybe just be a sounding board for questions and someone to <br/>
discuss my fears with.  I believe my son needs to be unschooled but I <br/>
keep struggling with the how.  I&#39;ll be honest that I feel that I need <br/>
someone who is understanding and gentle.  I&#39;ve got some big fears <br/>
about all this and right now I&#39;m very sensitive about feeling like <br/>
I&#39;m failing my son no matter which way I go.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like I have much to offer in the way of reciprocation <br/>
but I hope someday I can pay it forward by helping someone with what <br/>
I have learned and experienced.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone feels that they have a bit of energy and time to share <br/>
please write me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:smccann@...">smccann@...</a><br/>
<br/>
In appreciation,<br/>
Sarah</div>
