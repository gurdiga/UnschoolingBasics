<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737451379">Hi April,<br/>
<br/>
You definitely are not the only one.  My dd (adopted at the age of 18months) didn&#39;t have a pacifier  but has always sucked on her tongue.  Not her thumb but her tongue. When she first came here, she actually made major teeth marks on her tongue. I actually had never heard of anyone sucking their tongue ;)<br/>
<br/>
She is now 11 and still does it.  I think when she was a baby her bottle/paci was taken away way too early & this was her substitute.  I think as long as they need it, let them have it.  It drives my dh insane when she does it & will say &quot;Please stop doing that&quot; . I try & tell him she doesn&#39;t do it on purpose just to drive him crazy ~ sometimes he takes things so personally &lt;g&gt;.   I know its something she does subconsciously, mostly when she is upset about something or is really concentrating on something she is doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190993542">My dd just turned 7, and she still chews on things a lot - mostly <br/>
her blanket and sleeves.  She never used a pacifier, as she has <br/>
always been a thumb sucker.  She still sucks her thumb occasionally <br/>
during the day, but only when she&#39;s having a little rest with her <br/>
blanket or something, and she sucks it at night when falling <br/>
asleep.  Not that I control it in any way.  She just never sucks her <br/>
thumb unless she&#39;s holding her blanket.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s much you should (or can) do really.  Like <br/>
you said, he will find things to chew on.  I would say yes, there is <br/>
a need there.  Is there some reason it&#39;s a problem, or were you just <br/>
wondering if there were other kids who do this?  My older daughter <br/>
also sucked her thumb, but she stopped at around age 5.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723810756">April, <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried offering substitutes during the day, like chewing gum?<br/>
I&#39;m a speech therapist and work with some children who have big oral<br/>
needs. Sometimes offering chewy and crunchy foods throughout the day (<br/>
bagels, thick pretzels) helps to quench their mouthing needs. Also,<br/>
having those rubber scrunchy key chains (the spiral ones that you can<br/>
wear on your wrist) or  small pieces (6 inches) of aquarium tubing<br/>
available for the times when he has the need to chew.   For most kids,<br/>
pacifiers just become a habit and they don&#39;t want to part with them,<br/>
but in your son&#39;s case, he is showing that he has a physical oral<br/>
need, as he&#39;s trying to substitute the paci. when he doesn&#39;t have it.<br/>

April,<br/>
<br/>
Pacifier, thumb, whatever, it&#39;s all self comforting behavior. DD13.5 <br/>
still sucks her thumb when no one is looking and she&#39;s tired or <br/>
stressed. I think it was Berry Brazelton, the child psychologist, that <br/>
said something like &quot;braces are cheaper than therapy&quot;. When I was <br/>
really worried about it when dd was 6 or 7, LOTS of MOMS told me they <br/>
had sucked their thumb til they were 16! If you take the paci away, <br/>
the self comforting paci might be replaced with a behavior you (or <br/>
other adults) find much more unacceptable. You would also be telling <br/>
your child that they are not good enough and that they don&#39;t know what <br/>
they want and need. Besides, how are the adults who think your child <br/>
should dump the paci comforting THEMSELVES???.... with alcohol, <br/>
cigarettes?? Stick up for you child&#39;s right to do what they need to do <br/>
to cope. The stress over it will only cause them to have more to cope <br/>
with! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830482662">I�m afraid that there is a good reason to discourage<br/>
extensive use of a pacifier: muscles can pull bones out of shape. At one time<br/>
there was a website put together by a dentist, Dr. Brian Palmer, who did a good<br/>
deal of research on this topic. I don�t know whether it is still up but it<br/>
would be worth looking for. It seems that a pacifier has enough substance so<br/>
that the muscles of the mouth in order to accommodate it pull the bones out of<br/>
alignment, creating dental and other problems. I seem to recall Dr Palmer<br/>
saying that these abnormalities are so common now in the age of bottles and<br/>
pacifiers that many dentists don�t even realize that they are not normal. I<br/>
wince when I see a mother pop a pacifier into the mouth of a quiet and<br/>
contented baby in anticipation of later need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What you can do about a 5.5 yr old who is very much attached<br/>
to his pacifier, I don�t know. Long, long before I read Dr Palmer, I let my son<br/>
use a pacifier until it finally wore out. He rejected the new ones I bought<br/>
because they didn�t have the old, comfortable feel in his mouth. He was 3 or<br/>
maybe 4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
April, you wrote: �when there&#39;s no paci, he chews on<br/>
ANYTHING he can find, cloth, paper, blankets, his denim jacket. So there�s some<br/>
kind of an oral need? What&#39;s going on?� I think you are asking the right<br/>
question when you look for the cause of the behavior (beyond simply being a<br/>
habit), the oral need. What does he say?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Presumably he�s sucking or mouthing things for comfort. I�m<br/>
sure you�ve considered stresses in his life that would make him seek comfort<br/>
but could there be some imperceptible problem, such as an allergy or bone<br/>
misalignment, that makes him uncomfortable? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in sleuthing and let us know how things work out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032765877">~~My older daughter<br/>
also sucked her thumb, but she stopped at around age 5.~~<br/>
<br/>
I have one child that sucked his thumb until age 11ish, one that never<br/>
sucked anything (other than the breast), one that still sucks her<br/>
thumb occasionally at night and youngest that never sucked anything<br/>
other than the breast either, but didn&#39;t self-wean until age 4.:)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s VERY natural for most children to need something to suck<br/>
on until age 6-8, and some kids before or after that range. Other<br/>
children need something in their mouths regardless of the need to<br/>
suck, I notice Jalen wanting to chew on things occasionally even<br/>
though he&#39;s never had a thumb or pacifier.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in a child&#39;s right to bodily autonomy. I don&#39;t believe<br/>
anyone should force a child to give up a paci, thumb or any other<br/>
self-comforting tool. I agree wholeheartedly with Priscilla that<br/>
dental work is a lot cheaper than a psychiatrist!! <br/>
<br/>
If my child isn&#39;t harming another person or themselves, I just can&#39;t<br/>
see the point in trying to re-channel the behavior. Quit taking the<br/>
paci away during the daytime, trust that he needs it! I wouldn&#39;t like<br/>
it if someone took my tea away because they decided I drank too much<br/>
each day. It feels a lot worse for a child that needs to comfort<br/>
themselves to have that item removed.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason parents typically feel the need to remove those items,<br/>
is societal pressure. I say we owe our children, not the rest of<br/>
society and they deserve to be protected from any of that pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my long-term thumbsuckers have very straight teeth btw.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958021901">My dd is 14, rejected pacifiers when an infant, had trouble latching <br/>
on to the breast (combined with flat nipples, she never did), <br/>
rejected most nipples on bottles (finally found a really bulbous <br/>
one), and used it until she was 3 or 4 (at night mostly, then we <br/>
found a sippy cup top to replace the nipple in the bottle so she <br/>
still held the bottle).   She&#39;s always been very oral, it caused <br/>
problems in day care because she would put things in her mouth (or <br/>
one time it was a paperclip that was on the floor) etc.   I didn&#39;t <br/>
know it then but looking back I realize she was comforting herself <br/>
with whatever the item was by holding it in her mouth, moving it <br/>
around, it was something she could control herself.<br/>
<br/>
She still chews on things, her finger nails (she has none) paper, <br/>
soda can pop tops (although she&#39;s worked hard to stop after <br/>
discussing it with the dentist and how it&#39;s chipping her teeth), raw <br/>
spagetti (she goes through phases of needing to crunch and eat tons <br/>
of it!), and especially GUM.  We always try to have gum, she needs to <br/>
be moving her mouth.  <br/>
<br/>
Two things that I&#39;ve learned about how and that have helped are that <br/>
she&#39;s a Highly Sensitive Person (book by same name, also Highly <br/>

NOT trying to suggest labels, only sharing what I&#39;VE been through <br/>
(we&#39;ve only found unschooling in the past couple of years), things I <br/>
wish I had known back at the beginning of her life.   It would have <br/>
saved me many, many hours of pain and anguish because I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand.  I&#39;ve read MANY, many books, some of which didn&#39;t help, <br/>
some that did.  I take what works and leave the rest.<br/>

There&#39;s plenty of research to refute that too.  There&#39;s &quot;research&quot;<br/>
that dentists spout off, without much thought. Including how terrible<br/>
long-term thumb sucking is for the mouth. I know several long-term<br/>
thumbsuckers in my life (9-13 years of age) and only one had any kind<br/>
of malformation of the mouth. Interestingly enough, her sister had the<br/>
same buck teeth and overbite and never sucked her thumb. My own sister<br/>
sucked until close to teen years and has perfect teeth, never had<br/>
braces like me who stopped at five! Two of my children sucked the<br/>
thumb long-term and have straight teeth, so whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of what they attribute to thumb or paci sucking is just<br/>
genetics. If not, I reiterate my point that dental work is cheaper<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445368107">People have posted a lot of what I was going to say already :) I have an autistic son who has a major oral need. He constantly puts everything in his mouth including rocks! <br/>
   <br/>
  The only reason I quit giving him paci&#39;s is that I can find one that he dosent bite the nipple part off of the day he gets it and Im afraid of choking. <br/>
   <br/>
  My 7 year old also has a huge oral need. She has chosen to go to school and is having a hard time handling it but wants to say . The things we do to help fill the oral need are.........<br/>
   <br/>
  Ill bring her a milk shake at lunch that she will drink through a straw, we put aquarium tubing on the end of her pencil to chew on, and lots of hard candy and gum . She says the sucking and chewing helps calm her. <br/>
   <br/>
  However since your son ( Im assuming) isnt going to school and dosent seem to want to quit the paci why not let him have it?  <br/>
   <br/>
  If other people have a problem with your son&#39;s paci use its their issue that they need to deal with :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79014612">Hi--<br/>
My ds is 7 and sucks and chews all sorts of things. He&#39;s doing it <br/>
right now as I type and he&#39;s reading over my shoulder---which is very <br/>
exciting for me because his reading is pretty brand new around <br/>
here. :) <br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t worry about the paci. I believe there&#39;s some studies <br/>
on sucking and brain developement and that connection. Maybe it was <br/>
La Leche League where I heard it from? It&#39;s worth a look. Maybe your <br/>
dh would appreciate that line of investigation. <br/>
My partner said something interesting right now (as we are all <br/>
talking about this as I write)...he said there *is* no age limit for <br/>
sucking a pacifier, the limit is when or if damage occurs---and it <br/>
may never occur, as others have pointed out. And as far as the social <br/>
aspect to it--our society is truly unfriendly towards ANY kind of <br/>
self care or nurturing, so it&#39;d be up to you to...what&#39;s the <br/>
word?..protect/help/guide your son so that he can navigate any <br/>
potential flak given by relatives or whatever. And continue to suck <br/>
his paci if he wants to.<br/>
ok...I&#39;ve been working all day, my family&#39;s hankering for my <br/>
attention..gotta go. :)<br/>

&gt; ~~At one time there was a website put together by a dentist, Dr. Brian<br/>
&gt; Palmer, who did a good deal of research on this topic. ~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s plenty of research to refute that too.  There&#39;s &quot;research&quot;<br/>
&gt; that dentists spout off, without much thought. Including how terrible<br/>
&gt; long-term thumb sucking is for the mouth. I know several long-term<br/>
&gt; thumbsuckers in my life (9-13 years of age) and only one had any kind<br/>
&gt; of malformation of the mouth. Interestingly enough, her sister had the<br/>
&gt; same buck teeth and overbite and never sucked her thumb. My own sister<br/>
&gt; sucked until close to teen years and has perfect teeth, never had<br/>
&gt; braces like me who stopped at five! Two of my children sucked the<br/>
&gt; thumb long-term and have straight teeth, so whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think a lot of what they attribute to thumb or paci sucking is just<br/>
&gt; genetics. If not, I reiterate my point that dental work is cheaper<br/>
&gt; than counseling or psychiatric treatment!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264774482">I should add that I took Simon&#39;s pacifier away from him when he was almost <br/>
4. I&#39;ve always said it was because we couldn&#39;t find any pacifiers in Japan, <br/>
and that was true (although we did find a few a couple of months later) but <br/>
I could have gotten my mom or dad to send some from the U.S. I didn&#39;t like <br/>
them. And so he found other things to suck. He doesn&#39;t suck anything now at <br/>
9. But he needed at almost 4 and I didn&#39;t make room for that. I decided that <br/>
it wasn&#39;t important enough, or that it was wrong and made me look like a <br/>
bad, indulging mother. If I were the mother then that I am now, he&#39;d have <br/>
pacifiers until he was done with them.<br/>

helpful than I would have received elsewhere. The main reason it&#39;s<br/>
even an issue is the hole he&#39;s chewed in his jacket (a BIG hole :))<br/>

The thing is, I had a paci until I was 6 (nighttime only, but<br/>

that&#39;s why.<br/>

keeps taking them, though. She&#39;s not a big chewer, but they&#39;re <br/>
pretty, so she uses them for jewelry. <br/>

My mom used to tear the corners off paper and chew on them (among <br/>
other things). My brother and I had a standing joke - my Mom ate my <br/>

She was actually chomping on spaghetti when I wrote that last night!<br/>
Wish I had known this long ago, which is why I shared.(it wasn&#39;t <br/>
limited to those items, it was many a small toy in years past, the <br/>
neck of her tee shirts were constantly in her mouth and ended up with <br/>
holes, nothing was exempt!  I&#39;ve forgotten a lot of it to be <br/>
honest!).   The first 6 years of her life were awful for her, because <br/>
I didn&#39;t know about the highly senstitive temperament and didn&#39;t <br/>
always know what to do to help, it&#39;s just who she IS (and dh too!).   <br/>
It&#39;s helped me be able to handle the &quot;differences&quot; (from me!) so much <br/>
better.  And it&#39;s lessened as she&#39;s gotten older, but I think the <br/>
need will always be part of her.   As long as she keeps it safe etc <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698792072">My physician doesn&#39;t use growth charts.  As long as we know we are providing them with a healthy diet, and they clearly are growing then everything is fine.  I don&#39;t know if this is true for growth charts today but I do know that for many years the growth charts were based on a study of an Ohio town in the 1950&#39;s.  At that time in our history and still common today, different ethnic groups tended to live in the same neighborhoods.  The Ohio town in the study was primarily caucasian with the same racial heritage (I don&#39;t remember what heritage).  So when you are in the 25th percentile, your child is the same size as 25% of the children in &quot;whiteville&quot;, Ohio in the 1950&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404959363">My 8 1/2 year old daughter is 41 lbs., not sure about the height, but she is extremely short.  Believe it or not (and I won&#39;t bore everyone with the long story) I actually got accused of starving her.  Yes, I was turned into social services.  She is adopted first off.  Hubby and I took her to a top notch Pediatric Endocrynologist who went to bat for us.  He said &quot;There is nothing wrong with this child.&quot;  He said not only does the blood work prove she is healthy, but look at her beautiful skin and hair.......she would not have those if you were starving her.  We proved to the state that our child was healthy and just fine.  The thing that pissed me off so bad is my daughter is not even skinny, thin & petite yes, skinny no.  But they looked at this little tiny kid and assumed something must be wrong.  Our daughter is not even anywhere close to being on the chart.  Her birth mother is 4&#39;9&quot; and the Endo said that our daughter will also be about the same height as her birth<br/>
 mother.  My daughter is also hispanic with a birth mother from Mexico.  My kid is always gonna be a peanut, but she is fine.  She does not need growth hormones or anything like that.  So if you ask me growth charts are just a tool, but not always an accurate tool.  You have to consider ethnic background, genetics, etc.  I look at all the little chinese girls being adopted from China.  There is no way you can use a standard growth chart with them.<br/>

cross section of the nation, including ethnic backgrounds and feeding<br/>
preferences, though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not perfectly representative.  The<br/>
CDC was trying to put together another set of charts for long-term<br/>
nursing infants, as they tend to gain weight differently than formula<br/>
fed babies, but the charts haven&#39;t been made yet.  Still, the new 2000<br/>
charts (you can get them on the CDC website) take in a larger number<br/>
of breastfed babies - somewhere around 25%, I think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The best way of using growth charts is over time. It&#39;s not where a<br/>
child is at a particular point. It&#39;s more important that the child is<br/>
following a particular curve across time and that the child isn&#39;t<br/>
crossing two percentiles in a short time (either up or down). Of<br/>
course, there are always exceptions - alot of small babies might make<br/>
a huge leap in growth, which is their natural genetic tendency. Same<br/>
with larger that average babies from birth (partic. true in babies of<br/>
moms with gestational diabetes. <br/>
<br/>
25% is fine. Not everyone can be perfectly at 50%, nor would you want<br/>
it that way.  Another thing to watch for is that the weight and height<br/>
are within one percentile of each other. If there is a big gap (95th<br/>
weight, 25th height) then the drs. will be more watchful of a pattern...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784199661">Wow, what a great amount of info!  My daughter weight<br/>
is also in the same percentile, so she is<br/>
proportionate.  I guess I will try not to dwell on<br/>
things.  Everyone always says how cute and small she<br/>
is etc. So I measured her and looked up the CDC<br/>
charts.  Guess I need to stop obsessing.  She used to<br/>
be in the 95th percentile as an infant through about<br/>
18months.  But then grew slower and slower.  BUt DOES<br/>
grow.  She is healthy and had bloodwork at her last<br/>
visit so I guess I need to just stop obsessing!! :)<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if this is true for growth charts<br/>
&gt; today but I do know<br/>
&gt; &gt;that for many years the growth charts were based on<br/>
&gt; a study of an <br/>
&gt; &gt;Ohio town in the 1950&#39;s.  At that time in our<br/>
&gt; history and still <br/>
&gt; &gt;common today, different ethnic groups tended to<br/>
&gt; live in the same<br/>
&gt; &gt;neighborhoods.  The Ohio town in the study was<br/>
&gt; primarily caucasian<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the same racial heritage (I don&#39;t remember<br/>
&gt; what heritage). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, the growth charts were re-done in 2000 and<br/>
&gt; are a greater<br/>
&gt; cross section of the nation, including ethnic<br/>
&gt; backgrounds and feeding<br/>
&gt; preferences, though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not perfectly<br/>
&gt; representative.  The<br/>
&gt; CDC was trying to put together another set of charts<br/>
&gt; for long-term<br/>
&gt; nursing infants, as they tend to gain weight<br/>
&gt; differently than formula<br/>
&gt; fed babies, but the charts haven&#39;t been made yet. <br/>
&gt; Still, the new 2000<br/>
&gt; charts (you can get them on the CDC website) take in<br/>
&gt; a larger number<br/>
&gt; of breastfed babies - somewhere around 25%, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019845039">My ds has had his own little line off the growth chart since birth. <br/>
He looks &quot;normal&quot; to me, but apparently his head measures smaller <br/>
then his peers or something, whatever! Doesn&#39;t seem to mean much when <br/>
I buy him a bike hat, lol!<br/>
<br/>
He jumps around in other areas too. At his last visit the nurse went <br/>
nuts because &quot;he had not grown enough!&quot; He went from the 95 th <br/>
percentile to the 70th in height (odd - he is really tall), yet his <br/>
weight went from the 20 th to the 50th (uh - he is really skinny). He <br/>
grew 4.5 inches and lost 2 pounds from his 3 year old checkup. The <br/>
doctor said he was great.<br/>
<br/>
The next week we went to WIC and they (well the lady we had) went <br/>
nuts that my kid was too skinny. Mind you she measured him an inch <br/>
taller and three pounds heavier then the dr. I started to leave when <br/>
they wanted to take ds&#39;s blood dispite his wellness review from the <br/>
dr, but he consented to the prick. That person thought he was in <br/>
great shape and his hemocrit was great. Still the other lady began to <br/>
lecture me about his diet. She did not care that his doctor said he <br/>
was a perfect weight and build. He was in the at risk range on her <br/>
growth chart and required intervention! I told her what the dr said <br/>
again, and she told me very mater of factly that she had a growth <br/>
chart that compared all of the children in my state and he was only <br/>
in the 20th percentile or some crap. She went on to explain <br/>
percentiles to me. I explained to her that I simply could not help it <br/>
if the other kids in my state were fat, and maybe she should be more <br/>
worried about childhood obesity.<br/>
<br/>
Also, according to the groth charts I was supposed to be 5&#39;11 +. Well <br/>
I have been 5&#39;6 since I was 11. <br/>
<br/>
If your kid looks and acts healthy I wouldn&#39;t sweat it.</div>
