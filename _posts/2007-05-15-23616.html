<div id="ygrps-yiv-400113671">I have a complex question...it seems complex to me anyway. I guess at the root of it, though, is whether limits are ever appropriate, and when? And can a child say that they want to do something, but hope that you won&#39;t allow it? I will say at the outset that everything below has been discussed at length with my son. Our dialog has been extensive but has not lead to a resolution. I&#39;d like to simplify my question, and invite responses to that simpler question. Below that I&#39;d like to elaborate on the questions more as they pertain to my particular child, for those with the patience or time to read that!<br/>
   Here goes: The simple question/problem is this: my 13 yo ds has been wanting to watch TV alone from about 8:00 pm until 5:00 am for about 10 weeks. He occasionally wakes me up to watch a movie or look at something on the internet, but mostly he prefers to be alone. I have seen that some of the shows don&#39;t seem very good to me. I have at times brought up concerns, when he has (rarely) let me watch with him. But last night there was a reason he watched several hours with me nearby. The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very carefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They filled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was so sorry to find included my son. I am not naive; I am 46, have been through much in life and I work in an ER. I am not that easily shocked. I doubt that my feelings were unreasonable. I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went on for a while, but no agreement could be reached. He at<br/>
 first thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so frequently, could harm him, that I lacked trust in him. I went over again my belief that frequent exposure to anything will begin to influence almost anybody. He began to say..&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t allow this.&quot; But he did not say that he wouldn&#39;t watch it again. I said that I was so torn...that I did not want to control what he watched. I asked him how he&#39;d feel if I disallowed these shows, and the words felt alien in my mouth. But a part of me felt almost like he was looking for a firmer guide. This feeling is very concerning to me, like my intuition is telling me that he wants me to forbid these shows. So...I&#39;d love opinions on this case in particular and on the question about limits in general. Thanks you!!<br/>
    Although I planned to continue here, this is enough for now. Thanks again to anyone willing to comment!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can happen with a child who was previously conventionally  <br/>
parented. It&#39;s so common for parents to say or imply that the rules  <br/>
are because they love them. So if we let go of the rules, it can feel  <br/>
like love is let go. If we loved them enough to keep them on the  <br/>
right path before, letting them choose their own path can feel like  <br/>
an abandonment of love.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s happening.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He at first thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s true, even if you managed to argue it out of him.<br/>
<br/>
The fear oozing from you *isn&#39;t* saying it *could* happen. Your fear  <br/>
is saying that you don&#39;t think that he can handle it and that it will  <br/>
be pure luck if he isn&#39;t affected. And his &quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t let  <br/>
me,&quot; is an indication that you&#39;ve managed to whittle away at his own  <br/>
trust in himself.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than telling him it&#39;s something to fear and making him feel  <br/>
small and helpless and someone who needs his mommy to turn the TV off  <br/>
for him, help him gain power over it.<br/>
<br/>
Give him a big hug. Tell him you were wrong. Tell him you *do* trust  <br/>
him. Tell him you let your fears overwhelm you so that you saw him as  <br/>
less powerful than the TV and that you&#39;re sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Give him information. You could suggest a mental check in the  <br/>
mornings to see if he&#39;d like to do something special to counteract  <br/>
anything that saw last night. It might be talking about it. It might  <br/>
be doing something completely different, like a happy movie or happy  <br/>
music or dancing. Give him tools he can use throughout his life to  <br/>
combat depression.<br/>
<br/>
Do invite him to talk about the programs -- *without* the fear that  <br/>
what he&#39;s telling you is leading down a dark path.  If a friend of  <br/>
his who seemed happy was talking about programs he&#39;d seen you  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be filtering it through fear that he&#39;s headed for  <br/>
depression. So sometimes it&#39;s easier to look at our children as  <br/>
though they&#39;re someone else&#39;s kids who are sharing stuff that  <br/>
interests them  than a son that instinct tells you you need to  <br/>
protect from the scary world.<br/>
<br/>
*Trust* him. But don&#39;t take trust to mean ignore him. Invite him to  <br/>
share with you. Check in with yourself! Ask yourself if you are  <br/>
acting as someone he would want to share with or are you becoming  <br/>
someone he&#39;ll want to hide things from. (If you&#39;ve warned him that he  <br/>
could sink into depression and he does because he wanted to test his  <br/>
limits and he can feel changes in him but the only technique you&#39;ve  <br/>
given him is to turn the TV off, then he&#39;s less likely to go to you  <br/>
for help.) Your fear could make him *act* as though he has no  <br/>
problems because he doesn&#39;t want to feed your fears. Embrace the fact  <br/>
that he still trusts you enough to talk about the programs! :-)  <br/>
Nurture that. *Be* open. *Be* someone he&#39;ll want to share with. *Be*  <br/>
someone he&#39;ll want to come to when something bothers him (because  <br/>
right now your fears and discussions on what you&#39;d rather he do are  <br/>
setting up the opposite.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids *can* whack their thumb with a hammer. If we hover over them  <br/>
fearfully discussing how they could hurt themselves until they agree  <br/>
that hammering is dangerous, living and learning and growing is going  <br/>
to be squashed. They&#39;ll be filled with fear and distrust in their own  <br/>
abilities.<br/>
<br/>
If we instead say &quot;Here&#39;s the hammer and nails. Don&#39;t bother me,&quot; we  <br/>
aren&#39;t being a part of their lives and aren&#39;t welcoming them to come  <br/>
to us with problems.<br/>
<br/>
If we instead *trust* them, and show them -- to the extent that they  <br/>
want -- the basics and are open to them coming to us with problems --  <br/>
even if they hit their thumb! :-), it&#39;s all part of learning about  <br/>
their own abilities.<br/>

I always believe that offering or adding is tapping into the creative force so much more than responding negatively. Thanks also for not responding to me like I am control-happy and judgemental.

  Just a quick thought -- we&#39;ve had something like this come up.  One of my children has some very OC behaviors and feelings, and sometimes he asks me for my help in helping him reach goals, which does require setting limits.  The difference I see is that A) he chooses the limits and B) he asked me to remind him of the limits he chose and C) when he tells me he has chosen to ignore his own limits (knowing well the risks/consequences because we&#39;ve discussed them at length) and I respect that.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We arrived at this point when he told me he was disappointed to miss some of his goals and needed help limiting himself.  I told him I won&#39;t impose my own limits on him, but if he would like me to remind him, I would.  Have you asked your son if he&#39;d like you to help him set limits on his TV viewing?  Have you discussed with him your specific concerns with the TV shows he chooses?  If you&#39;ve done both of these and he still chooses those shows, and tells you he doesn&#39;t want you to limit him, then I&#39;d suggest you just back off the TV thing for a while and let him come to his own conclusions. <br/>

This is really hit home with me. How in the world does one know!?! And of course I did communicate my concerns to my ds. Great suggestion to ask if he wishes I&#39;d set more limits.

  Whether or not anyone else is &#39;conscious&#39; of wanting limits, you already got your answer from your son.  He doesn&#39;t want you to set limits on his TV watching.  Trust him to know what he does want, and tha the doesn&#39;t need you to second-guess what you think he might want from you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a perfectly legitimate question. But I think to those used to  <br/>
conventional parenting -- especially *victims* of conventional  <br/>
parenting! ;-) -- it has that snarky tone [conventional] parents use  <br/>
to ask a question the child is supposed to have memorized the  <br/>
parent&#39;s answer to by this point.<br/>
<br/>
The question isn&#39;t &quot;Why in the world would a child do that?&quot; meaning  <br/>
&quot;You know he wouldn&#39;t and your obviously haven&#39;t been paying  <br/>
attention to even ask that question.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The question Deb is asking is to think about why someone would ask  <br/>
another person to limit life for them. What would cause someone to  <br/>
feel they need someone else to erect boundaries around them? Why  <br/>
would they feel their own boundaries for themselves weren&#39;t good enough?<br/>
<br/>
Without boundaries a free person is free to go where ever they want  <br/>
and do whatever they want (within the law).<br/>
<br/>
Despite what those who have been raised with restrictions believe, a  <br/>
person who is raised free -- as children of long time unschoolers are  <br/>
-- *don&#39;t* go everywhere and do everything. They do what they want to  <br/>
do and avoid doing what they don&#39;t want. They create boundaries of  <br/>
choice basically. They choose not to punch someone to take what they  <br/>
have. They choose not to watch pornography. They choose not to read  <br/>
Harry Potter. They choose not to be friends with someone that makes  <br/>
them feel uncomfortable. They choose not to watch Seventh Heaven.  <br/>
They choose not to watch Blade.<br/>
<br/>
But why would someone with the freedom to choose or not choose  <br/>
something, come to feel they need someone to stop them from making a  <br/>
choice?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an important question to ask because it isn&#39;t conducive to  <br/>
happiness and wholeness to want someone else to limit your life for  <br/>
you. Certainly people *have* reached the point where they have asked  <br/>
other to limit them. But it doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen.&quot; There is a cause,  <br/>
a reason and dealing with that reason will help someone return to a  <br/>
path to wholeness.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who is asking someone else to limit them rather than limiting  <br/>
themselves has lost trust in themselves. They had the freedom and  <br/>
they&#39;re saying &quot;Take it away. I can&#39;t trust myself with it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It can be comforting for a parent to hear a child ask for limits.  <br/>
Trusting is scary! What parent doesn&#39;t feel a pinch of fear when  <br/>
their child takes the car keys to drive on their own for the first  <br/>
time? It would be very comforting to those fears to hear the child  <br/>
say &quot;Don&#39;t allow me to drive further than 2 miles from home,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t let me drive at night,&quot; or &quot;Put a curfew on me so I&#39;m home by  <br/>
9PM.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that comfort is a trap. It might feel good to us but won&#39;t *help*  <br/>
a child grow towards happiness. (It&#39;s not that a child will be  <br/>
damaged by imposing limits. It&#39;s that it won&#39;t *help* him grow.  <br/>
Sometimes kids come out of something unhelpful we&#39;ve done perfectly  <br/>
fine. But they&#39;ve done it *despite* what we&#39;ve done, not because of  <br/>
it. We put up a roadblock but they managed to get around it.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way better to *help* them grow than to nurture roadblocks that  <br/>
they might or might not navigate around unscathed.<br/>
<br/>
 From what you wrote it sounds like he initially asked you to limit  <br/>
him after your long discussion. It could be you scared him and he  <br/>
lost trust in himself (for a moment since he&#39;s changed his mind now,  <br/>
but even a moment isn&#39;t helpful to him). It could be he got  <br/>
frustrated with the discussion and saw you imposing limits as a way  <br/>
to stop you from dumping your fears on him.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like, from your upsetness, that you want to hear people say  <br/>
&quot;Yes, kids *can* want us to set limits.&quot; It *would* be a relief. You  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to feel scared for him any more. But the regular  <br/>
posters know that asking for limits indicates something has  <br/>
interfered with his trust in himself and it&#39;s more important for him  <br/>
and your relationship with him to investigate that something and  <br/>
examine your fears than to choose the path that soothes and comforts  <br/>
your fears.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it will help you to look at your initial posts as though  <br/>
written by someone else. You *are* trying to change him by expressing  <br/>
your fears to him. *You* see it as trying to convince him of  <br/>
something that&#39;s obvious to you. It&#39;s not so obvious to him. He&#39;s  <br/>
seeing the situation very differently. And it&#39;s frustrating you why  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t see your point of view because you feel it&#39;s so sensible.<br/>
<br/>
He undoubtedly feels the same way about your inability to see his  <br/>
point of view! From his point of view they&#39;re just shows that he  <br/>
finds interesting.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem is that he loves and trusts you and he knows you  <br/>
have more experience. That&#39;s an incredible power and we can --  <br/>
sometimes unconsciously -- use to shape our kids in ways we feel are  <br/>
legitimate. It *is* a form of control even if it isn&#39;t a &quot;Here&#39;s the  <br/>
rules&quot; kind of control. It feels subtle on our part to envelope them  <br/>
in words of (what we feel is) wisdom to convince them to change their  <br/>
minds -- but to our kids it feels like a sledgehammer. (And perhaps  <br/>
why he asked you to limit him. It might have at the time felt easier  <br/>
to ask for limits than to continue listening to your (maybe even  <br/>
rationally stated) fears for him.)<br/>
<br/>
You have the great big huge fear that the late night shows could harm  <br/>
him. It&#39;s reasonable to want that fear to go away. It&#39;s an easy  <br/>
solution to grasp at the possibility that your child wants you to  <br/>
limit him so the situation that&#39;s creating the fear will go away.<br/>
<br/>
But none of the regulars will agree that a child in a healthy  <br/>
environment will ask someone to limit him.<br/>
<br/>
As an alternative, they&#39;re asking you to rationally look at your fear  <br/>
and examine the validity of it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s comforting to hold onto fears. It&#39;s *very* hard to examine them  <br/>
and work (hard!) at rationally working them out of us. But when a  <br/>
fear is interfering with learning and interfering with a relationship  <br/>
and damaging a child&#39;s trust in himself, then to help that child,  <br/>
it&#39;s necessary to do the hard thing rather than the easy (but  <br/>
damaging) thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful to examine what effect conventional parenting  <br/>
has on children&#39;s needs rather than assuming the needs of  <br/>
conventionally parented children are the universal needs of children.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not untypical for a conventionally parented child to feel lost  <br/>
and alone, to feel like they&#39;re navigating the world on their own. In  <br/>
fact society is big on pushing the concept of independence. Lots of  <br/>
conventional parenting advice is about getting kids to not need their  <br/>
parents. The idea that preschool is good for kids because it fosters  <br/>
independence is very popular!<br/>
<br/>
But when we step back away from that particular tree marked  <br/>
&quot;independence&quot; to look at the forest, why would it be a good idea for  <br/>
a *3 yo* to be independent of his family? If we were to go into a  <br/>
natural tribe and tell them we needed to take their 3 yos away for  <br/>
several hours a day so they could learn to figure out life on their  <br/>
own not only would the tribe think we were crazy but so would the  <br/>
rest of the world! And yet we think it&#39;s a good idea to foster  <br/>
independence in American 3 yos.<br/>
<br/>
What kids -- all people really -- need is a nest of safety to stretch  <br/>
their wings in. They need a place where they feel safe to test their  <br/>
limits.<br/>
<br/>
No unschooling child should feel lost and alone. No unschooling child  <br/>
should feel they&#39;re navigating the world by themselves. It&#39;s feeling  <br/>
lost and alone that needs fixed, not imposing limits.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* what you&#39;re asking is: It was only after a lot of  <br/>
&quot;discussion&quot; (you telling him your fears) that he said he wanted  <br/>
limits. You want to know if that need was buried deep and you managed  <br/>
to uncover it and how can you uncover those deep seated needs more  <br/>
easily?<br/>
<br/>
What people are trying to explain is that it *isn&#39;t* natural to want  <br/>
limits. Something made him distrust himself. *You* think it&#39;s the TV.  <br/>
We&#39;re certain it&#39;s your own fears.<br/>

<br/>
And this child isn&#39;t asking for limits.   His mother wants to believe he <br/>
subconsciously wants limits and she&#39;s trying to get us to help her believe.<br/>
<br/>
According to his mom he has said, right out loud, he doesn&#39;t want limits.<br/>

After what must have seemed like hounding from his mom he said, &quot;Maybe you <br/>

<br/>
***I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went on<br/>
for a while, but no agreement could be reached. He at<br/>

 <br/>
This may have already been discussed.  I must admit to not reading all  of <br/>
the posts in the thread.  But I think yes.  There may be situations  where a <br/>
child or an adult may want to limit things, but not be in a relationship  where <br/>
they feel they can express that.  So they might keep that inside, but  really <br/>
want to limit themselves and not know how exactly to go about setting  goals, <br/>
limits, etc.  I do think it has to come from inside the person  though.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think anyone can set limits for another person without  setting that person <br/>
up for failure (or success I guess).  I haven&#39;t really  thought a whole lot <br/>
about it because my boys have never asked for limits.<br/>
 <br/>
I think self imposed boundaries are always in flux.  I may set limits  on <br/>
things for myself, but I may decide that it is OK to go outside those limits  on <br/>
occasion, or not.  I have the power to control those boundaries.  I  might <br/>
share those decisions with my family or friends and then again I might  not.  But <br/>
for me there is no failure.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t see that as your situation though.  I think you have concerns  for <br/>
the content of the programs your child is watching and you have asked if he  is <br/>
wanting limits and he said no.  I am not sure he shares your concern for  his <br/>
TV watching.  Maybe you need to really think about what it is you  want/need.  <br/>
And maybe he as well.  Do you really want him to stop  watching or do you <br/>
want a healthy, happy child, who, when not in your presence,  can watch TV and be <br/>
able to make decisions for himself that he will be happy  with etc etc.  Are <br/>
you afraid that watching the programs he is watching  will lead him to <br/>
.......(I guess you have to fill in the blank).<br/>
 <br/>
If it were me I would think about it myself, what it is I really want/need  <br/>
out of the situation, and my relationship with my son.  And then approach  it <br/>
from that angle.  Talking to him about what it is he needs/wants and  find <br/>
mutually agreeable solutions to the problem where you both get what you  want and <br/>
both of you are happy with the outcome.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a couple of my thoughts this morning.<br/>

still remains: can a child subconsiously desre limits and indicate this to an  <br/>
attuned mother&#39;s mind? I am not a naturally controlling person at all. But I am  <br/>
sort of worn out with the intensity of most of these responses, though I am  <br/>
thankful to all who give them. Cameron&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I understand why, but I think you are mistaking enthusiasm and passion  for <br/>
anger. We often get excited about  this stuff. It&#39;s not personal,  and we still <br/>
like you ;)<br/>
 <br/>
First, let me say that this process can be challenging. What I often tell  <br/>
people is that we&#39;re given messages that education is best left to the  <br/>
professionals. Just homeschooling is a big deal -- actually trusting kids to  learn??? <br/>
 Oh my!<br/>
 <br/>
You are worried that your child will be hurt by these images and concepts  t<br/>
hat you find disturbing. And I can tell you -- probably not. Depends on your  <br/>
kid. If he has other big issues, and you would probably know, it could. If he&#39;s <br/>
 basically an untroubled, happy kid ... nope. <br/>
 <br/>
There are lots of TV shows I find disturbing. For the life of me, I have no  <br/>
idea why anyone likes &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond.&quot; Every person is mean and all  <br/>
the humor seems to be based on this family being cruel to one another. <br/>
 <br/>
Unless you really believe these shows are hurting your son (specifically  <br/>
because he has other stuff going on), ask what it is that he likes about them.  <br/>
It might just be something silly and gross that you&#39;re not going to get because <br/>
 you&#39;ve never been a young boy. (That said, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, my <br/>
lovely,  beloved wife giggles every time a local DJ says her name: Joanne Doody.)<br/>
 <br/>
You asked if any parents of teens would be willing to talk you  <br/>
through....e-mail me off-list and I&#39;d be delighted to give you my number. I have  a 17 year <br/>
old son.<br/>

feedback. I find it really helpful to assume posititve intent behind <br/>
every post, even those that are strongly disagreeing with me or <br/>
picking my words apart. One of the things that helps *me* do that is <br/>
to imagine a kind &quot;tone&quot; to the words I&#39;m reading, especially if <br/>
those words seem harsh. <br/>
<br/>
I also find it helpful, if I&#39;m reacting strongly to a certain kind <br/>
of feedback, to look carefully at my own reaction. Usually an <br/>
intense reaction on my part indicates some old baggage is underneath <br/>
whatever issue I&#39;m trying to work through. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I&#39;d like to call to your attention the fact that <br/>
you seem to be reacting very defensively to posters who say they <br/>
enjoy the kind of programming you find &quot;hideous&quot;. I think it would <br/>
be worthwhile to consider if your ideas and feelings about this kind <br/>

threads often go off on tangents, or spawn new discussions <br/>
completely separate from the original issue, or go on long past the <br/>
point where the original poster intends. Personally, I love that <br/>
aspect of discussion lists - its facinating to see the connections <br/>
people make! <br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Were you conscious of wanting limits from your mother at the time,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I wanted from my parents was consistency, and I suppose there  <br/>
have been times in my life when I would have said, &quot;I wanted limits.&quot;  <br/>
My parents made rules but enforced them capriciously--they let any  <br/>
given behavior go until they couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, and then  <br/>
exploded. I never knew whether any given thing I did would be ignored  <br/>
or punished--and if they said they were going to punish me, I never  <br/>
knew whether they were going to follow through or whether I could get  <br/>
out of it by cajoling or crying hard enough. I do still think that a  <br/>
parent with a lot of rules who applies them consistently is doing a  <br/>
better job than my parents did, and it would have been a huge relief  <br/>
to me as a kid and as a teenager if my parents had become that kind  <br/>
of parent. If they&#39;re read a book like Love and Logic, that makes me  <br/>
shudder now, it would still have improved my life tremendously!<br/>
<br/>
Even better than that, though, would have been loving engagement and  <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine there being times when kids, just like grown-ups, can  <br/>
benefit from their loved ones helping to support a goal. Right now,  <br/>
I&#39;m on a very restrictive diet to try to improve chronic headaches,  <br/>
and my partner is helping me think about what foods I can eat,  <br/>
helping me to remember to eat meals when I&#39;m feeling like I can&#39;t  <br/>
think of a thing to eat, and so on. He&#39;s not setting limits for me,  <br/>
but he is saying things like, &quot;Have you remembered to have lunch? Can  <br/>
I help get you something?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has a 10yo son who decided he wanted to learn to  <br/>
read last year. The two of them researched programs and he chose one.  <br/>
It was very stressful for him and the work was hard, but he was  <br/>
committed to doing it. After a few weeks, he asked her to push him a  <br/>
little to do the lessons--he told her than he could handle how hard  <br/>
the lessons were for him and he was still committed, but handling the  <br/>
work AND being responsible for finding time in his day to do it were  <br/>
too much for him. He asked her to carry part of the burden for him,  <br/>
by taking responsibility for reminding him at the time of day they  <br/>
had agreed on to sit down with his workbook, and helping him get  <br/>
settled. That&#39;s not quite the same as the question about limits, but  <br/>
it seemed somewhat related.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us--me or my 10yo friend-- would probably have been too  <br/>
happy if someone else had said, &quot;Su, it&#39;s time to go on this  <br/>
incredibly restrictive diet where you can&#39;t eat 10 of your very  <br/>
favorite foods,&quot; or &quot;R., it&#39;s time for you to learn to read! Sit down  <br/>
and get to work!&quot; But we both asked our families for help in  <br/>
achieving our own goals to do things that are really hard for us but  <br/>
that we think are worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: My parents tended to let me do things but harangue me  <br/>
about them. I watched my mom do this with my niece awhile ago:  <br/>
&quot;Taylor, you shouldn&#39;t be drinking another Coke. You&#39;re already  <br/>
getting heavy; women in our family tend to be fat, you know, so you  <br/>
really need to watch it! And with your ethnic background you are at  <br/>
very high risk of diabetes, so you should be really watching the  <br/>
sugar! You should have some water, you should think about losing a  <br/>
few pounds instead of doing something that will just put weight on!&quot;  <br/>
The whole time Taylor was drinking her Coke. I wanted to scream and  <br/>
my mom, &quot;Mom! Either let her have the Coke or take it away from her,  <br/>
but either way JUST SHUT UP!&quot; That&#39;s what my whole childhood and  <br/>
adolescence were like.<br/>
<br/>
The OP said that her son said to her at one point, &quot;Maybe you just  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t let me watch it,&quot; or something like that. One way to  <br/>
interpret that is that he was looking for someone else to make the  <br/>
decision for him about whether he should watch certain shows. Another  <br/>
way to interpret a statement like that from a kid--any kid, I&#39;m using  <br/>
the OP as an illustration here, not talking about her son per se--is  <br/>
that he wants his parent to just stop lecturing and cajoling and  <br/>
sharing feelings; to just piss or get off the pot. Either let him  <br/>
watch his show in peace or make it off-limits, but either way, just  <br/>
shut up already.<br/>

I was brand new I would ask questions and some of the answers were<br/>
hard for me to take because they caused me to look at myself and my<br/>
beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Being challenged in our thinking is a good thing and causes only growth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984601898">Well,I was told that I was manipulating others, and several other pretty accusatory things about my motives. <br/>
  No matter how sure that one is about someone else&#39;s thoughts and motives, the potential exists to be wrong or to be so abrasive that right things aren&#39;t heard. I am very resilient but that was very taxing. And assumptions about others are potentially flawed since humans aren&#39;t omniscient. Sometimes rushing in without clarification and good listening skills makes us fix what isn&#39;t broken and leave broken something else.  <br/>

I really appreciate all the answers given to the question below. Even <br/>
those who<br/>
seemed angry at me or seemed to be discussing things I didn&#39;t intend <br/>
still put<br/>
effort into this. At this point, I feel that I have some questions <br/>
specific to<br/>
this child, not really for the whole list. Is there anyone who offers <br/>
advice or<br/>
a listening ear offline who has raised or is raising teens? For pay or <br/>
for<br/>
kindness? It&#39;s fine if not. Time fixes many things anyway. Cameron<br/>

NO ONE here is angry---really!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to get you to see the situation from your child&#39;s point <br/>
of view.<br/>
<br/>
We can see it because many of us have been where you are now, but <br/>
we&#39;ve made this HUGE shift in our way of viewing the world and our <br/>
children. If you can just shift around a bit, you&#39;ll be able to see it <br/>
too. That doesn&#39;t mean that you will be able to DO anything about it <br/>
right away (that takes some more time, usually). But simply seeing the <br/>
problem for what it *really* is, and not what you want to make it, is a <br/>
big, BIG step. Then you can start making the changes for the *real* <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think I scare you? I&#39;m really pretty sweet. &lt;bwg&gt; So&#39;s Deb! &lt;G&gt; NO <br/>
one&#39;s out to get you---we&#39;re here to HELP! But you&#39;ll need to drop your <br/>
defenses and accept what we&#39;re saying as kind and helpful. Seriously!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 19 year old (Cameron) and an 11 year old (Duncan). Cam came <br/>
out of a private college prep school at the end of 6th grade. We went <br/>
through a silent hell for a few months as we tried to implement what I <br/>
was learning on the lists. It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s not easy!<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s attacking you. We&#39;re just trying to get you to shift your <br/>
perspective!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372107318">What a rich email this was for me. Confusing but so thought provoking. Thanks!!!! I relate to the Coke harangue. Internally for me it goes like this: I don&#39;t want to control my son&#39;s diet. He is healthy. Oh! He drank 5 cokes today! Oh! Another one! Instead of taking it away I will remind him of why a different choice is better...then I have offered him the choice and slightly relieved my anxiety without controlling him. You see my intent, I see your feelings on the receiving end. Great insight for me. Thanks again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I can remember at that age pushing my<br/>
&gt;&gt; mother to be firm and feeling really lost and alone<br/>
&gt;&gt; when she was unable to offer me the firm guidance I<br/>
&gt;&gt; know I needed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Were you conscious of wanting limits from your mother at the time,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; or only in retrospect?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I wanted from my parents was consistency, and I suppose there <br/>
have been times in my life when I would have said, &quot;I wanted limits.&quot; <br/>
My parents made rules but enforced them capriciously- -they let any <br/>
given behavior go until they couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, and then <br/>
exploded. I never knew whether any given thing I did would be ignored <br/>
or punished--and if they said they were going to punish me, I never <br/>
knew whether they were going to follow through or whether I could get <br/>
out of it by cajoling or crying hard enough. I do still think that a <br/>
parent with a lot of rules who applies them consistently is doing a <br/>
better job than my parents did, and it would have been a huge relief <br/>
to me as a kid and as a teenager if my parents had become that kind <br/>
of parent. If they&#39;re read a book like Love and Logic, that makes me <br/>
shudder now, it would still have improved my life tremendously!<br/>
<br/>
Even better than that, though, would have been loving engagement and <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine there being times when kids, just like grown-ups, can <br/>
benefit from their loved ones helping to support a goal. Right now, <br/>
I&#39;m on a very restrictive diet to try to improve chronic headaches, <br/>
and my partner is helping me think about what foods I can eat, <br/>
helping me to remember to eat meals when I&#39;m feeling like I can&#39;t <br/>
think of a thing to eat, and so on. He&#39;s not setting limits for me, <br/>
but he is saying things like, &quot;Have you remembered to have lunch? Can <br/>
I help get you something?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has a 10yo son who decided he wanted to learn to <br/>
read last year. The two of them researched programs and he chose one. <br/>
It was very stressful for him and the work was hard, but he was <br/>
committed to doing it. After a few weeks, he asked her to push him a <br/>
little to do the lessons--he told her than he could handle how hard <br/>
the lessons were for him and he was still committed, but handling the <br/>
work AND being responsible for finding time in his day to do it were <br/>
too much for him. He asked her to carry part of the burden for him, <br/>
by taking responsibility for reminding him at the time of day they <br/>
had agreed on to sit down with his workbook, and helping him get <br/>
settled. That&#39;s not quite the same as the question about limits, but <br/>
it seemed somewhat related.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us--me or my 10yo friend-- would probably have been too <br/>
happy if someone else had said, &quot;Su, it&#39;s time to go on this <br/>
incredibly restrictive diet where you can&#39;t eat 10 of your very <br/>
favorite foods,&quot; or &quot;R., it&#39;s time for you to learn to read! Sit down <br/>
and get to work!&quot; But we both asked our families for help in <br/>
achieving our own goals to do things that are really hard for us but <br/>
that we think are worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: My parents tended to let me do things but harangue me <br/>
about them. I watched my mom do this with my niece awhile ago: <br/>
&quot;Taylor, you shouldn&#39;t be drinking another Coke. You&#39;re already <br/>
getting heavy; women in our family tend to be fat, you know, so you <br/>
really need to watch it! And with your ethnic background you are at <br/>
very high risk of diabetes, so you should be really watching the <br/>
sugar! You should have some water, you should think about losing a <br/>
few pounds instead of doing something that will just put weight on!&quot; <br/>
The whole time Taylor was drinking her Coke. I wanted to scream and <br/>
my mom, &quot;Mom! Either let her have the Coke or take it away from her, <br/>
but either way JUST SHUT UP!&quot; That&#39;s what my whole childhood and <br/>
adolescence were like.<br/>
<br/>
The OP said that her son said to her at one point, &quot;Maybe you just <br/>
shouldn&#39;t let me watch it,&quot; or something like that. One way to <br/>
interpret that is that he was looking for someone else to make the <br/>
decision for him about whether he should watch certain shows. Another <br/>
way to interpret a statement like that from a kid--any kid, I&#39;m using <br/>
the OP as an illustration here, not talking about her son per se--is <br/>
that he wants his parent to just stop lecturing and cajoling and <br/>
sharing feelings; to just piss or get off the pot. Either let him <br/>
watch his show in peace or make it off-limits, but either way, just <br/>
shut up already.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853777">And the same is true in the reverse...you are assuming that people are attacking you, and <br/>
after reading all of the emails, I haven&#39;t seen that. I&#39;ve seen a lot of moms who&#39;ve been <br/>
there, done that, respond in a very passionate way. And yes, perhaps without all the <br/>
information, but you didn&#39;t post more information. They only had what they posted with. <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to feel that you have to defend yourself. But no one is asking you to, what they <br/>
are asking is that you look at the entire situation outside of where you already are, and <br/>
that&#39;s the opportunity you have! By seeing how we are seeing the situation, you have the <br/>
opportunity to see it outside of yourself. I think you are so close that you feel abraided.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one of the hardest things I ever heard on this group, was after I posted <br/>
something and Sandra Dodd told me that if I did not like how people were perceiving my <br/>
family, then I needed to be much more precise in describing the situation. We aren&#39;t <br/>
&#39;rushing&#39; into conclusions per se, but asking a million questions to verify something does <br/>
take a lot of time, something most of us don&#39;t have a lot to spare. It did very much seem <br/>
to me that you spent a lot of time &#39;talking&#39; with your son explaining how you felt about the <br/>
show, and then was frustrated that he didn&#39;t agree with you at the end. I don&#39;t know that I <br/>
would like the show you described either, and I can assure you that unschooled children <br/>
who have freedom of choice, and are not interested in the show, will not choose to watch <br/>
that show. They will leave or change the channel or complain. Kids who are interested are <br/>
obviously understanding *something*, it doesn&#39;t even have to be the sexual innuendo. My <br/>
eight year old would watch that and not even catch it...she would be engrossed in the idea <br/>
of eating worms, but the sex would not even be heard. My 12 year old would totally catch <br/>
it and be intrigued and embarrassed because of hormones, but talking with me or dad <br/>
would clear up a lot of that. If he felt embarrassed and then felt judged by me, then he <br/>
might choose to not watch, and then I&#39;d feel my own sort of shame for providing an <br/>
unnecessary limit. My husband would probably laugh his butt off, and I&#39;d be in another <br/>
room playing with the people who were not interested. <br/>
<br/>
Are limits ever needed? Well, yeah, I don&#39;t let my daughter (18 months) play in the street <br/>
during rush hour. I will find a better place for her to run, whether it be another street, the <br/>
park, our backyard. Are TV limits ever needed? I like the way Ren described it. That&#39;s what <br/>
we do in our family. Our kids can watch what they want, I&#39;m totally there. We have several <br/>
TV&#39;s so that the little&#39;s feel that they have a choice if a big kid is watching something they <br/>
don&#39;t like. We have LOTS of other things to do, crafts and books, mud and toys, video <br/>
games and movies. Computers are very popular here, and Josh actually now watches more <br/>
stuff online to help Sam and Dan have more opportunity to watch what they like.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling only because the kids are putting on their own &#39;movie&#39; about Teddy <br/>
Bear cannibals that eat cotton underwear when they can&#39;t catch one of their own, and I <br/>
have about ten minutes before the laundry loads need changed. WOohOo! Just know that <br/>
it&#39;s the hardest journey, but one which is so rewarding. We&#39;ve been unschooling a year and <br/>
a half, and I&#39;ve seen so many benefits. it&#39;s taken a long time for us all, but we&#39;re settling in.<br/>

  I think you do lack trust in your son and now after discussing YOUR views and opinions on those shows you have made him doubt himself also.<br/>
  You told him that anyone watching those shows over and over again will be harmed by it. You son pribably trusts you enought that he is starting to think that they will indeed harm him. At the same time he likes those shows. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575140367"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is very hard to get advice that doesn&#39;t agree with what we think <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is right. I have to say, though, that Deb Lewis is one of my favorite <br/>
posters on this list because she is so often painfully right on. <br/>
Kelly is quickly becoming my 2nd favorite. And I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
curry favors, just that these women seem to have found the way to <br/>
keep their eyes, minds, and hearts open.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re serious about someone to talk to, you may want to check out <br/>
www.naomialdort.com and www.naturalchild.org/counseling. Neither one <br/>
is cheap, but what is these days? I have not used either service, but <br/>
I can say&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

   I agree  with talking to Naomi or Jan . I have myself had counseling from both of them and they are awesome.<br/>
  You can start by reading their books and websites and that will already help you a lot!!!!!<br/>
