BEAR is  in the yard!!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t talk to her just go get her in doors physically!  explain on the  way!  <br/>
(all this coming from someone who has no bears around!  Just  what i would <br/>
do!)<br/>

&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

ALSO:  Wouldn&#39;t ignoring a request by someone also be considered  <br/>
disrespectful?  If we ignored our kid&#39;s needs and requests they would  <br/>
feel it as disrespectful.  IYKWIM.  Isn&#39;t it the same in  reverse?  <br/>
How do we teach them this?  Or is it something that is  just learned <br/>
in time?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Question is---have you ever ignored her requests &quot;to do it right NOW&quot;?  Maybe <br/>
she got that from you? <br/>
 <br/>
I think it IS learned over time. They don&#39;t pop out respectful. They pop  out <br/>
needy. They will learn respect if they are respected. And how to be  <br/>
disrespectful if not respected.<br/>
 <br/>
I have no idea how it worked for us. My children and my dogs: if I yell,  <br/>
&quot;NO!&quot;----they all automatically stop and sit and stop whatever they were doing,  <br/>
whereever they are. They NEVER hear &quot;NO!&quot; unless it&#39;s an emergency. When I  <br/>
scream, &quot;NOW!&quot;---they all come running to me. Again, I never yell &quot;NOW!&quot; unless  <br/>
it&#39;s an emergency. I don&#39;t know what I did to reinforce this. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
it&#39;s  all in the tone of voice and the look of fear in my eyes: they KNOW I&#39;m  <br/>
serious.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could set up a scene where you talk about there being a bear or  <br/>
something else scary nearby. This is what you&#39;d yell, and this is what she  <br/>
should do----run straight for you because you&#39;re scared for her life. <br/>
 <br/>
I know a lot of Cameron&#39;s friends would not &quot;hear&quot; their moms call for  <br/>
them----thinking that they would be called in from playing outside and from  having <br/>
a good time. &quot;Selective&quot; hearing. I wanted to avoid that. I&#39;d call out  <br/>
&quot;Cameron Check!&quot;, and he&#39;s answer, &quot;Mommy Check!&quot;  And vice versa: if he  needed to <br/>
know where I was, he could call out, &quot;Mommy Check!&quot; and I&#39;d answer,  &quot;Cameron <br/>
Check!&quot; All that was was a way for each of us to know that the other  was <br/>
nearby. I never used it to find him to tell him it was time to go or to stop  him <br/>
from playing. It was just a &quot;check&quot;----to make sure he was close.<br/>
 <br/>
I think if there were bears in my yard, I would let her know in NO  uncertain <br/>
terms that she needs to come when I call. That&#39;s not open for  debate. I <br/>
think my children need to come when I call at all times, but  at the same time, <br/>
they KNOW I won&#39;t call them unless it&#39;s important.<br/>
 <br/>
That looks funny when I read back what I wrote. But they KNOW when I NEED  <br/>
them to do what I say when I use that tone of voice. They never ask questions  <br/>
when they hear that tone.<br/>

I LOVE the idea of &quot;checking&quot;!   That is a great idea.  I do have to <br/>
check on them and usually just call a name and they answer because I <br/>
can&#39;t say I have ever made them come inside from playing.  lol!  My <br/>
kids are pretty free to do what they want.  I have asked dd to tell <br/>
me when she is going outside to play and why I need her to do that <br/>
and she always does.  She is a very &quot;spirited&quot; child and has been <br/>
since birth.  (I am not into labels-this is just the only way to give <br/>
you an idea of her personallity.)  <br/>
DD really can and does rub people the wrong way A LOT.  To the point <br/>
where they don&#39;t want to be bothered with her.  This makes me very <br/>
sad for her and I don&#39;t know what to do about it.  She also acts out <br/>
when this happens.  We are dealing with this right now. Her older <br/>
sister and her boyfriend just moved on our property (a very temporary <br/>
situation) and her boyfriend treats the 2 yr old dd (Heather) all <br/>
sweet and he pushes 6 yr old dd (Spring) away.  And even when he <br/>
doesn&#39;t, you can tell from his stiff body language that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want her near him.  Spring can &quot;feel&quot; this.  Everyone can.  My mother <br/>
does the same thing, so when she visits life is horrible.  Spring is <br/>
out of control the whole time her grandmother is here.  (Not saying <br/>
we control her-it is her own actions that become out of control.)  My <br/>
loving child becomes a monster!  <br/>
I have my home set up child friendly.  Which means that they <br/>
basically have total freedom.  If they are hungry they can reach <br/>
foods to eat and don&#39;t have to ask-though I have tried to get them to <br/>
let me know they are hungry in case it is almost dinner time and we <br/>
will be eating real soon (and I still tend to feed them a quick snack <br/>
because they are hungry and shouldn&#39;t have to wait).  :)   <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions about how to handle this situation above with others <br/>
not wanting her near?  I am really lost on this one.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect my kids to act &quot;right now&quot; unless it is a dangerous <br/>
situation.  They know they can say &quot;wait a minute&quot; just like we can <br/>
if necessary.  Sometimes things do have to wait.  (Like when you are <br/>
in the bathroom and they need something &quot;right now&quot;-lol!)  There are <br/>
times in our family life when we all have to wait a minute or two for <br/>
something.  We do try to meet all needs asap simply because it is  <br/>
important no matter what age they are.  DH and I always try and make <br/>
sure one of us is available to them at all times.  This can be <br/>
challenging when you are out rounding up a calf that has just gotten <br/>
out of it&#39;s pen.  lol!  But we try.  Treating kids with respect is <br/>
the only way to go.  (Now if I could just get my mother to understand <br/>
this.)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

he would just &#39;&#39;do&#39;&#39;things,,with out alot of thought ,,,,what changed him was <br/>

computers,,he can  build a working computer in less than 10 minutes,,,he loves it <br/>
,,it all started when a friend at my church,after i was clueless as to what to <br/>
do cause hubby hasnt helping an already bad situation,, sort of took him under <br/>
his wing and mentored him for most of a year,,,it sparked something in <br/>
him,,,!,hes  working doing what he loves ,,,being inside a computer and making it <br/>
work         11he still does &#39;&#39;stuff&#39;&#39; but he understands better when someone is <br/>
getting aggitated or when someone willnot find him funny at all and to <br/>
chill,,,,,takes time,,<br/>
they feel the negative energy and i think it feed what ever it is ...i told <br/>
my husband once it was like he was being pinched by something we dont see and <br/>
it would make him do &#39;&#39;something irratating,,,,,he&#39;sgrown out of 90% of it <br/>

***************************<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We had a situation a few years ago, where by my MIL showed clear favortism  <br/>
to one of our children, nearly ignoring the other two and often saying hurtful  <br/>
things to them that would send me out of my mind.<br/>
 <br/>
I spoke with dh about it and he agreed.  The next time his mother came  over, <br/>
he pulled her aside and told her in no uncertain terms, that while we  loved <br/>
her and valued her company, it was absolutely unacceptable to continue her  <br/>
behavior with the kids.  We added, that if it continued, we would have no  other <br/>
choice than to bar her from visiting any of them.<br/>
 <br/>
She really is a wonderful woman - she admitted her mistake, apologized and  <br/>
has clearly been making mindful choices ever since.  She is 86.  It&#39;s  never <br/>
too old to learn.<br/>
 <br/>
I believe, rather than fretting and wondering what to do, you need to speak  <br/>
up.  You can say, &quot;Gee, I know ________ seems like a handful sometimes, BUT  <br/>
........ , kwim?  We did with love and with the best interest of our  children <br/>
at heart.  It worked.<br/>

We are working on her each time we speak.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
If we have any problems again, we will be asking her to not visit <br/>
until she can respect our family&#39;s way of living.  I hate the idea <br/>
(and I do not do confrontation well at all), but it has to be done.<br/>
