<div id="ygrps-yiv-566046855">Darling Daughter - &quot;Homeschooling is great because you get to spend all day with the people you love most in the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Son - &quot;Mom, thanks for respecting me.  You know I like war, and I know that you don&#39;t, but you are still taking me to meet the Air Force guys.  I really appreciate that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Un-schooling for all of us continues to grow each day.  We are new to this, with an 8 year old son and 11 year old daughter.  We just started in December 2008.  I feel like I am growing and learning soooo much about myself and my kids.  I love it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of your support from this fabulous Yahoo Group.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
