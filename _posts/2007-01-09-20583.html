<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390967125"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I;m assuming this means your children have gone over  month without a <br/>

curious  :)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My boys have both gone months without a bath, LOL.  It isn&#39;t *sad*  at all.  <br/>
They are happy, healthy boys.  My oldest is reaching a point  where his hair <br/>
gets greasy if he doesn&#39;t bathe more often so he is wanting to  wash his hair <br/>
more regularly.  I can say that I don&#39;t worry about the  *germs or dirt* they <br/>
carry.  I believe their bodies are used to it, can  handle it.  They are not <br/>
sick any more than any of their friends, so I  believe they are not picking up <br/>
any more unmanageable bacteria or viruses than  other children. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe their bodies are stronger because they come in contact with more  <br/>
&quot;dirt&quot; who knows.  But I choose not to live in fear but instead to seek out  the <br/>
best information I can from different sources and make informed  decisions.  I <br/>
encourage my children to do the same, and am more than happy  to help them <br/>
gather information.  I have so much to say on the &quot;teeth&quot;  issue also but no time <br/>
to type it all out.  But I think that fear based  decision making in any <br/>
situation is not a good thing for me or for my  children.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
