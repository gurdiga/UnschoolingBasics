<div id="ygrps-yiv-219854940">&quot;I have been following this thread with interest because my younger<br/>
son (10) feels like I don&#39;t really ever punish older brother (12)<br/>
when he teases or bullies him. He accuses me of &quot;not really doing<br/>
anything about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you? Why wouldn&#39;t you be actively, immediately doing something<br/>
about it?? Just because punishment is not advocated here, does not<br/>
mean &quot;do nothing&quot;!!<br/>
I&#39;ve seen &quot;gentle&quot; parents that let the older sibling harrass the<br/>
younger (or something the other way around) and stand there doing<br/>
NOTHING. That isn&#39;t gentle parenting btw. I&#39;ve also heard &quot;just ignore<br/>
her&quot;<br/>
WHA???<br/>
Just ignore someone that is bullying, teasing or otherwise invading<br/>
your space??? What kind of advice is that?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in our household deserves peace and safety. Sometimes a child<br/>
isn&#39;t interested in peace or safety for another person and it&#39;s my job<br/>
to ENSURE that peace and safety for that smaller/less aggressive person.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very mindful to let someone pick on another person.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s great that your child doesn&#39;t feel you do enough to<br/>
protect him. How are you stopping this? Why is the younger one feeling<br/>
he doesn&#39;t have an advocate to help him? Why on earth would any child<br/>
be allowed to make someone else miserable?<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing instead of punishment?<br/>

<br/>
Ren, I fully agree with you, but I&#39;m at a loss as to<br/>
what to do in that kind of situation. Currently in my<br/>
life, my son is picking on two little kittens his<br/>
daddy brought home. I&#39;ve talked to him about why he is<br/>
doing it. I think I understand at times, but he won&#39;t<br/>
stop. I don&#39;t know how to make him stop. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost it a few times, and spanked him. For which I<br/>
cry more than he does. I apologise for spanking him,<br/>
and tell him it&#39;s wrong to spank him. Some days I<br/>
think he understands and others I feel he just doesn&#39;t<br/>
get it. Seperating them doesn&#39;t seem to help. Because<br/>
he waits till I&#39;m busy and then goes in the room they<br/>
are in and just hurts them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told him, that I am seriously considering giving<br/>
the kittens back to the lady that gave them to us.<br/>
I&#39;ll be sad, and he doesn&#39;t want them to go, but I<br/>
don&#39;t know what else to do? <br/>
<br/>
I will value any help with this. We are in the middle<br/>
of moving too. And under a lot of stress, which I<br/>
believe contribute to this behavior. I just don&#39;t want<br/>
him to be mean to animals. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Danie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236621568">I had kittens with very young children and they just didn&#39;t understand that<br/>
you can&#39;t handle the kittens ALL day long.  I solved the problem by building<br/>
a cage out of those white wire shelves and wire ties.  I made it big enough<br/>
to fit a small litter box and food and water and a bed for the kitties.<br/>
When I felt the kittens had had enough handling they went in the cage for<br/>
their nap.  The kids could gather round the cage and still see them but they<br/>
knew it was the kitties sleep time and they didn&#39;t bother them.  I also was<br/>
constantly there with my kids, playing with them, loving them, and meeting<br/>
their needs. My house was a wreck but my kids had their needs met.  What are<br/>
your priorities?  Be with them, really with them.  Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
