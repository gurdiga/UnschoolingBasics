<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373184657">From a discussion on this list...<br/>
<br/>
**I tell my son that he has to do something else for a while then can go <br/>
back. I know this does go against unschooling but sometimes I really feel we need <br/>
to do something else.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really REALLY wondering why people seem compelled to give advice they <br/>
KNOW is anti-unschooling on this list? <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to help people understand unschooling. How does <br/>
advice like this help anyone, reader or poster, to better understand <br/>
unschooling and move toward an unschooling life?<br/>
<br/>
Please. Please. Don&#39;t post advice that &quot;does go against unschooling&quot; here. <br/>
Even if you post a disclaimer. There are THOUSANDS of places for folks to get <br/>
that sort of advice. This shouldn&#39;t be one of them. It&#39;s unfair to the members <br/>
who&#39;ve come here looking for unschooling advice, and it&#39;s unfair to the <br/>
longtime unschooling advocates who will then feel compelled to not only spend time <br/>
posting unschooling compatible advice but also writing about why the &quot;does go <br/>
against unschooling&quot; advice is a bad idea. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if people personally decide to follow anti-unschooling practices in <br/>
their own families. I&#39;m just asking folks not to promote practices that are <br/>
anti-unschooling here. That&#39;s not the purpose of this list.<br/>
