<div id="ygrps-yiv-945374329">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  I&#39;m Kim Griffin, mother of 2 beautiful =<br/>
children (dd is 4 and ds is 2).  I&#39;ve been reading this list and =<br/>
unschooling.com for a long while now and am definitely headed down the =<br/>
unschooling path.  You all seem like a wonderful bunch and I have =<br/>
learned from you all...so, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Now for my question.. I may be a single mother soon; however, I still =<br/>
want to stay home with my children.   Do any of you out there work from =<br/>
home?  If so, what do you do and do you have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your help...Thanks : )<br/>
<br/>
