<div id="ygrps-yiv-982335031">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my son for 2 years now.  He started high <br/>
school in 2006 school year.  We have had a lot of &quot;life&quot; happen <br/>
since the beginning of 2007 and I find that it is becoming hard to <br/>
keep up with &quot;doing academics&quot; each day.<br/>
I would like to know if there are any other parents that are <br/>
unschooling their high school child and exactly how you go about <br/>
doing it?  I also have a toddler and realize that it&#39;s easier with <br/>
him learning at his pace, learning what he wants.  But with my teen <br/>
son, I want to make sure that he is getting the proper &quot;education&quot; <br/>
so that he may have a transcript at the end of 12th grade for me to <br/>
be able to give him a high school diploma...I would also like to <br/>
know how to create a transcript for him.  He is planning to go to <br/>
Art School and I know the one he is interested in requires high <br/>
school transcript and a diploma.<br/>
Any help or advice is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Angel</div>

I have been homeschooling my son for 2 years now.  He started high<br/>
school in 2006 school year.  We have had a lot of &quot;life&quot; happen<br/>
since the beginning of 2007 and I find that it is becoming hard to<br/>

I would like to know if there are any other parents that are<br/>

Unschooling is NOT the lazy mom&#39;s way out of making her kid do this <br/>
schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Cameron, left school at the end of 6th grade. Unschooled from <br/>
thirteen on. He&#39;s 19 now.<br/>
<br/>
The way we did it was to allow him time to deschool (18 months of not <br/>
doing much at all---phone, tv, computer, sleeping). Then he slowly <br/>
started to do little more each day. Now he&#39;s so busy we hardly see him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I also have a toddler and realize that it&#39;s easier with<br/>
him learning at his pace, learning what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee it&#39;s easier to do  that with a teen too!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But with my teen son, I want to make sure that he is getting the proper <br/>
&quot;education&quot;<br/>
so that he may have a transcript at the end of 12th grade for me to<br/>
be able to give him a high school diploma...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then send him to school or keep schooling at home. Seriously. Is that <br/>
your *goal*? My goal was that my son would love to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Not that you *can&#39;t* make a transcript for him. Kathryn Baptista&#39;s son, <br/>
Julian, has a lovely transcript.<br/>
<br/>
*I* can make him a diploma! &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s just a piece of paper. I could <br/>
calligraphy it for him too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to know how to create a transcript for him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen high school transcripts? Can you write one?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  He is planning to go to Art School and I know the one he is interested <br/>
in requires high<br/>
school transcript and a diploma. Any help or advice is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you actually talked with the dean there? Did you ask about <br/>
&quot;special students?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Generally homeschooled and older students are looked at separately from <br/>
the rest of the herd---because they&#39;re different. They have different <br/>
backgrounds. For an art school, I think a portfolio would be MUCH more <br/>
important. Where has he shown his artwork? How many different <br/>
galleries? Who has inspired him? How?<br/>
<br/>
Art schools in particular want people who think outside the box.<br/>
