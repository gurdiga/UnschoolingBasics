HI!  We are unschooling academically already but the more I read the<br/>
more I like about radical unschooling.  The whole life unschooling<br/>
really appeals to me in many ways.  I am hoping to read more about it<br/>
because I just don&#39;t get how to implement it in.  Its such a drastic<br/>
change and going all at once does not seem like it would work very<br/>
well.  So I am here and will most likely be lurking and devouring any<br/>
thread that catches my eye (or posting tons of questions) LOL.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992296246">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
As many have said over much time and many threads, go easy. Don&#39;t pull<br/>
the rug out from under everyone - it just gets messy. Instead, just say<br/>
Yes more; say Why not? Instead of No; think through that first reaction<br/>
- what is your reason for saying No to that, is it a real thing (based<br/>
in some real situation such as No hitting your sibling) or is it a<br/>
leftover tape of Mom has to be in control at all times and they have to<br/>
learn that they don&#39;t always get their own way. And, too, when a No<br/>
arises (as in I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t make a banana smoothie because we&#39;re<br/>
out of bananas), find a Yes in it - (...but I can write bananas on the<br/>
grocery list right now so I don&#39;t forget and I&#39;ll be going shopping in<br/>
two days when it&#39;s pay day. Or, No, we can&#39;t get to the beach today, the<br/>
car is broken. How about we have a picnic lunch outside and then play in<br/>
the sprinkler in the back yard? And, if you don&#39;t have a sprinkler or a<br/>
backyard, a living room picnic and maybe getting in the shower with your<br/>
clothes on would be silly fun) Bottom line is look for ways to be a<br/>
helpful partner to your kids - you&#39;ve got the car keys and the money,<br/>
you can facilitate their exploration of the world...or not, your choice<br/>
- rather than being their adversary enforcing your view on them rather<br/>
than helping them embrace their own view of the world.<br/>
