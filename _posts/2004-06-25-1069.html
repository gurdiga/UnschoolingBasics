I&#39;m a stepmom to a PSer.  My husband (his dad) and I plan to unschool our son <br/>
and all future children.  We talked to his mom about homeschooling before <br/>
Kindergarten and she wasn&#39;t going for it, mostly because it was something that I <br/>
was interested in (and heaven forbid she go along with anything that I&#39;m <br/>
interested in).  Luckily at this point my stepson doesn&#39;t even understand what <br/>
homeschool is about because our son is young.  We&#39;re just now starting to talk <br/>
about it and be around other homeschoolers/unschoolers.  It&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s the <br/>
way it goes.  I think it will be harder for us as he gets older, like your <br/>
daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
Just wanted to let you know there is another person on the list in a similar <br/>
situation.<br/>

       Thanks for letting me know you&#39;re out there.  I think that the older<br/>
they get the more difficult it becomes for them to let go of public school.<br/>
They seem to become hooked on it like a junky to heroin.  It may be<br/>
different in you case, but in mine I think Priscilla&#39;s dad has just<br/>
convinced her that she can&#39;t live without the friends she&#39;s made and the<br/>
teachers she&#39;s met.  The funny thing I realized though is that she was<br/>
&quot;absent&quot; more this past year than any year in her life.  If she stays home<br/>
for a mental health day, as we like to call it, we just go all over the<br/>
place doing things or we sit home and play on the computer.  I think she has<br/>
really come to love these days.<br/>
     I have hope that some day she will tall her father the way it is and<br/>
just leave school.  She is more than aware of the legal age to drop out of<br/>
school, which she found on her own by the way, in Vermont and I think she<br/>
plans to take advantage of that.<br/>
    We&#39;ll see....<br/>

able to homeschool their foster kids and MADE IT WORK!  I do not <br/>
recall all the details, but they managed to show it would be best for <br/>
the kids and the county finally allowed it.  <br/>
