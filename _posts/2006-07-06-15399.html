<div id="ygrps-yiv-139307338">~I feel the struggle and tension in my body which I feel all my<br/>
life, when I am lost, out of connection with my heart, my breath...~<br/>
<br/>
You just hit the nail on the head. Your own being &quot;out of connection&quot;.<br/>
So the real question is, how do you connect with your own heart, your<br/>
breath? How do YOU feel connected the whole that is life once again?<br/>
<br/>
In the &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; talk last year, I quoted this from<br/>
&quot;Wherever You Go There You Are&quot;:<br/>
&quot;All of Walden Pond is within your breath.  The miracle of the<br/>
changing seasons is withing the breath; your parents and your children<br/>
are within the breath; your body and your mind are within the breath.<br/>
 The breath is the current connecting body and mind, connecting us<br/>
with our parents and our children, connecting our body with the outer<br/>
world&#39;s body.  It is the current of life.  There are nothing but<br/>
golden fish in thsi stream.  All we need to see them clearly is the<br/>
lens of awareness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For me, if I&#39;m feeling out-of-whack, it&#39;s my clue to stop and evaluate<br/>
what is doing that. Am I feeling disconnected from those I love? Am I<br/>
ignoring some area of my life that needs attention?  Do I just need to<br/>
slow down, be more aware?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, a simple task like cleaning the kitchen can make me feel<br/>
better. It&#39;s silly, but at an internal level it&#39;s something I can<br/>
control when life feels uncontrollable. <br/>
If cleaning something, or taking a walk, or painting can make you feel<br/>
better, then do it.  <br/>
<br/>
These changes are so simple, yet so difficult.  Keep walking towards<br/>
the things that bring joy into your life, and all will be well. Pay<br/>
attention to that which brings you joy...true joy!<br/>
What colors or textures or objects grab your attention...notice them.<br/>
What feels good for your body? Jumping, walking, a warm bath, a cool<br/>
swim, a hike? Do those things.<br/>
What activities bring you joy? Painting, watching a movie, having<br/>
friends over, going to a wine tasting, playing tag, creating a<br/>
book....pay attention to the things you love.<br/>
<br/>
I think as parents, we get hyperfocused on what our kids need, what<br/>
our kids &quot;have to&quot; learn, how to keep them healthy and we forget<br/>
ourselves in the process.  But the most effective parents, are<br/>
following their bliss, with their children right alongside them, both<br/>
worlds as one.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean we follow our bliss instead of being present for our<br/>
children, one can be present AND doing the things we love. Your<br/>
children deserve to know the very BEST of you and be invited to join<br/>
you in that pursuit of joy.  Let them dabble in and out of your<br/>
activities as they grow. Bring in things that help them explore the<br/>
world. There is a lovely rhythm and pulse in the family where all<br/>
members are doing that which they love!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603367720">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
You wrote: There are nothing but golden fish in this stream.  All we need to<br/>
see them clearly is the lens of awareness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I struggled today... I feel so lonely... I am living woth the kids for<br/>
almost three weeks now. My dh is working many, many hours and I start to<br/>
feel so sad without real connections with adults. The care of the children,<br/>
which means that I don&#39;t find time to write, which is what I like most, is<br/>
knocking me down today.<br/>
<br/>
I am sick and sad of trying to solve this problem, which I have to face for<br/>
so many years. We meet other people with which we can connect for a short<br/>
time but after awhile people go away because we are too radical. Too<br/>
different. We live in a neighbourhood where all children go to school and<br/>
they act like that. Children who are very aggressive or very polite and<br/>
doing whatever the adults wants. Jesse is different. He is asking questions.<br/>
&quot;Why can&#39;t we play together?&quot; Because you played with each other yesterday.<br/>
&quot;And what is important about that? We like to play now&quot;. <br/>
&quot;If I say no, than it is no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I feel isolated, down and so sad. I sit here, waiting for my dh to come<br/>
home. I can write with all of you but you are not here. And apparently I<br/>
need people around me who I can &quot;play&quot; with, with who I can connect, learn,<br/>
talk....<br/>
<br/>
To me this is the hardest part of radical unschooling.... being so<br/>
overwhelming alone.... It hurts badly... <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am blind. But than I am too blind to see where I am blind...<br/>

There&#39;s lots of us at the conference!!:)<br/>
I know that&#39;s a very long ways for you, but is there any chance you<br/>
all could move somewhere that more alternative types exist? Is there a<br/>
possibility that some are in your area and you just haven&#39;t found them<br/>
yet?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds to me you just need a good girl friend!! ;)  Some of my closest <br/>
friends, do not unschool.  They don&#39;t even homeschool.  But they are <br/>
people I can connect with.<br/>
<br/>
You might just need to find some homeschooling families.  They might <br/>
surprise you!!  Usually when I am around other homeschoolers, I <br/>
usually mention we unschool unless I really get to know them.  The <br/>
other day I was talking to a mom, her kids and my kids play together <br/>
quite a bit and I mentioned unschooling and explained it a little.  <br/>
She said that was kind of what they did.  But she called it organic <br/>
learning. She said she does use workbooks sometimes but she doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe in forcing her kids to do things when they don&#39;t want to.  <br/>
Just that little conversation I found someone very similar, we already <br/>
got a long great and now we have this new connection.  Cool.   <br/>
<br/>
It just takes time.  Hang in there...:)   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25307993">I don&#39;t have anyone either. I can&#39;t even seem to find any other<br/>
homeschoolers much less unschoolers (we live in a rural area). I can<br/>
understand exactly where you are coming from. It gets lonely sometimes. My<br/>
dh works long hours and has an hour commute each way so we don&#39;t see him<br/>
much during the week either. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429759692">I know lots of homeschoolers, but sometimes that is just as bad as  <br/>
not knowing any. While it gives me a grownup to meet up with during  <br/>
the day, sometimes they think I am crazy! There is an unschooling  <br/>
group here in our state as well, but very few of those are radical  <br/>
unschoolers, and I feel even more uncomfortable with them because  <br/>
when THEY start to talk about curriculum or &#39;sneaking&#39; in educational  <br/>
opportunities, it makes me feel even stranger. Like maybe I&#39;m too  <br/>
radical. KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
I have a few homeschooling friends that I&#39;m very comfortable with,  <br/>
but I have other things in common, such as one family is from church.  <br/>
THey are extremely different than us...flirted with unschooling but  <br/>
then enrolled their kids in a part time christian classical academy.  <br/>
And then another family that we&#39;re close to because they hold similar  <br/>
philosophical bent on religion and medication, but they were strict  <br/>
school at homers (although I think we&#39;re rubbing off on them!) I&#39;ve  <br/>
met online a few local unschoolers, but only we&#39;ve met in person once  <br/>
or twice because even in the same state it&#39;s hard to mesh schedules,  <br/>
yes?<br/>
<br/>
Most of my friends are adults that are at the places my kids love to  <br/>
go, librarians, stock clerks at the pet store, the comic book store  <br/>
owner. One cashier at McDonald&#39;s LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Almost all of my support is online<br/>

there are LLL groups in the Netherlands.  Even if you aren&#39;t<br/>
breastfeeding, they might have a playgroup you could join in on.  LLL<br/>
folks tend to be a little more &quot;crunchy&quot; than your regular folks and<br/>
are more open to ideas such as homeschooling and unschooling even if<br/>
they don&#39;t do those things themselves.  Go to the parks during school<br/>
hours and see who else is hanging out with their school aged children.<br/>
 Heck, go anywhere during school hours and see who else is hanging out<br/>
with their school aged children.  :-)  Search on the internet for<br/>
homeschooling groups.  Get in touch with the NVVTO (found that by<br/>
googling Netherland homeschooling, but you will probably get better<br/>
hits on google.nl than in regular ole google) and see if they have<br/>
some resources for other homeschoolers.  You may not find many<br/>
unschoolers, but then again you might!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And do you guys have many people around you that are unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  There are a few unschooling families in our resource group, but<br/>
few actually show up to our resource days.  Most of the families at<br/>
our resource days do some sort of structured organized even forced<br/>
curriculum.  But we get along.<br/>
