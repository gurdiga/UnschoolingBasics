<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801581380">&quot;Bad&quot; by conventional parenting definition, that is! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I keep stumbling across pictures of mothers gazing down in awe at  <br/>
their sleeping infants with the caption, &quot;I will love you no matter  <br/>
what.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Right. There&#39;s a real test: loving a sleeping infant. (Can you  <br/>
feel the sarcasm?)<br/>
<br/>
And it struck me what really illustrates love, what gets to the core  <br/>
of unschooling is when we&#39;re up to the challenge of still being there  <br/>
for kids when they push us out of our comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve created a blog called:<br/>
<br/>
I Will Always Be There For You<br/>
OR The Radical Unschooling Philosophy Illustrated &lt;-- That&#39;s the  <br/>
subtitle. Not an indication I can&#39;t make up my mind ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolingphilosophyillustrated.blogspot.com/">http://unschoolingphilosophyillustrated.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added the first post as an example :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I need your photos!<br/>
<br/>
Examples like (but not limited to):<br/>
<br/>
* Kids who&#39;ve done something that conventional parents would get mad  <br/>
about.<br/>
--&gt; Like emptying a cupboard into the hall. Like pulling up &quot;weeds&quot;  <br/>
that really weren&#39;t weeds. Like extending the driveway chalk painting  <br/>
onto the car and the house and the cat ...<br/>
<br/>
* Kids you&#39;ve helped do something that conventional parents wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
allow.<br/>
--&gt; Like messy painting. Like going up the slide instead of down. Like  <br/>
marker tattoos on any bare skin showing (one of my daughter&#39;s  <br/>
favorites!) :-)<br/>
<br/>
* Doing things with kids that most parents don&#39;t have time for.<br/>
--&gt; Like playing video games together. Like going to anime conventions  <br/>
together. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
ALSO include:<br/>
<br/>
* Caption you want under the picture.<br/>
<br/>
* Any credit for the picture.<br/>
<br/>
* A brief bit about what unschooling has meant to your relationship or  <br/>
anything else that might help people understand why what&#39;s happening  <br/>
in the photo is valuable to understand.<br/>
<br/>
* I may add a bit of unschooling philosophy to it. (And I may crop the  <br/>
photos a bit to make them fit the blog format unless you let me know  <br/>
it&#39;s not okay.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love love to have photos to help illustrate this :-) You can find  <br/>
some, send them to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jfetteroll@...">jfetteroll@...</a><br/>
<br/>
At some point I&#39;ll start a Facebook group for it. The kind that sends  <br/>
you alerts and emails that there&#39;s been a new post. (I am a noob at FB  <br/>
so if anyone can offer tips, I&#39;d sure appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to start a job (one that like pays you cash for doing  <br/>
stuff!) working in the bakery at the grocery store, so like I really  <br/>
need a new project! ;-) But this one won&#39;t let me go and keeps nagging  <br/>
me to start it. I can&#39;t promise the pictures will go up fast! But I  <br/>
will do my best to get them up there since I think it could be quite  <br/>
lovely and useful for explaining unschooling. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337019468">Is it just me?<br/>
<br/>
I am in the midst of scanning years of family photos and, even if I felt comfortable posting pictures of my kids anywhere, which I don&#39;t, mostly the kids are having fun and playing. Even by the standards of someone looking for something &quot;bad,&quot; I&#39;m not seeing it. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am just looking through unschooling glasses. And we&#39;re pretty messy to start with. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How many moms dress up to go to anime conventions with their  <br/>
daughters? How many teen daughters *want* their moms to dress up?<br/>
<br/>
And yet I hardly think about it. It&#39;s just the two of us doing  <br/>
something we both enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Kat enjoys going to rock concerts with her dad too. But rock concerts  <br/>
are one of those rebel things for many teens to do and going with  <br/>
their parents would kind of kill much of the point. ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even if I felt comfortable posting pictures of my kids anywhere,  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Different comfort levels for different folks. There&#39;s been pictures of  <br/>
Kat on the internet for years. *And* we have a unique name. I know  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s had way more pictures up even more prominently. Neither of us  <br/>
have had problems.<br/>
<br/>
The only bad story I&#39;ve heard is someone put up a nekkid kid picture  <br/>
and she later found it got way many more hits than her non-nekkid  <br/>
pictures. :-P (So naked pictures will be safely cropped!) I think the  <br/>
shear massive volume of kid pictures out there is what makes it safe.  <br/>
Regular kid pictures are as exciting as pennies to creepy people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to change your mind! Just throwing out a different take  <br/>
since the &quot;Oh, my god, why would you put pictures of your kids on the  <br/>
internet? Are you crazy?&quot; fear is much more commonly expressed.<br/>

If there are any in particular that inspire you to words, that would  <br/>
be cool. :-)  I think people&#39;s personal takes on what unschooling has  <br/>
inspired for their family adds another dimension to what&#39;s being  <br/>
illustrated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847849916">My daughter wears a tail.  We are members of a Viking era re-enactment group and for whatever reaseon they all like to wear tails, even though it is not historically accurate.  So on regular, non-viking days, my 13 year old still likes to wear her tail.  It&#39;s about 12-14 inches long and is grey, black and white.  It has a small chain on the top and she uses a large safety pin to attach it at her waist and then pulls her shirt down so people can&#39;t see the pin. She wears most every day and everywhere she goes.  Her dad and I have never had a problem with it and we have never given it a second thought.  Other kids see it and LOVE it.  Other parents, not so much. We get a lot of questions about it generally followed by commetns like &quot;well you are brave parents&quot;, which just cracks me up.  In my view point she is a kid being a kid. <br/>

crazy people think I am when I post something I think is relatively<br/>
innocent.  By the way, you will see a person named AlandDiane &quot;liking&quot; all<br/>
my photos and always having something kind to say.  That is, believe it or<br/>
not, my mother in law!  Oh yes I hit the jack pot there.  She loves how<br/>
freely I enjoy the girls.<br/>
<br/>
I personally know many people who would not consider themselves unschoolers<br/>
that do not punish for &quot;bad&quot; things, but that&#39;s because I purposely surround<br/>
myself with people like this.  They would say they use positive/gentle<br/>
discipline.  One mom in particular always cracks me up with her posts -<br/>

floor..... again!&quot;  This is nearly daily, and she never seems ruffled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for actually participating in things that seem unconventional as a<br/>
parent, some things you may see pics of are - encouraging the kids to draw<br/>
on eachother with markers.... how I got asked to leave the huge playscape at<br/>
Kalahari because apparently parents are allowed in only if they do not play<br/>
with reckless abandon.  I drew whiskers on my youngest daughter every<br/>
morning for 2 months because that&#39;s what she wanted.  I let her scrub the<br/>
dishes and pile them as high as she could, and of course when they came<br/>
crashing I wasn&#39;t fast enough to catch them.  (oops)  Oh and she slept in a<br/>
cardboard box every night for several weeks.  You may see my husband dressed<br/>
like a dragon storming a castle.....  We let them use real knives to cut<br/>
food at 3, well supervised, instead of insisting she don&#39;t touch them.....<br/>
 today we all dressed up like Harry Potter wizards and I taught a Potions<br/>
class as well as a hoopdance class, at a festival.<br/>
<br/>
I do try to keep my posts on FB upbeat, so I hope you can find something you<br/>
can use.  My youngest has a penchant for pushing buttons, and I know I have<br/>
pictures that illustrate this but may not have posted them.  I just posted<br/>
one with her painting the bathroom with soap.  She was &quot;cleaning&quot;  and I<br/>
encourage that even if her being helpful is actually creating a bigger mess,<br/>
but I know my own mother would have had a fit ;)<br/>

There are parents who aren&#39;t so much &quot;gentle&quot; as foolish and negligent - and I would put a mother who set her toddler up to get into the cleaning products on a regular basis in that category. A child who is very inquisitive is going to get into more &quot;interesting&quot; situations and make more messes, sure, but that&#39;s not a reason to shrug aside the potential for accidental harm. Busy, inquisitive kids need More adult engagement, not to be left to their own devices. <br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with &quot;gentle discipline&quot; is that it can still set parents up to think in terms of discipline and supervision rather than engagement and partnership.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reckless? Maybe you mean you were being silly or loud, but reckless implies you weren&#39;t being very thoughtful of others or the space. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to ban recklessness! <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t some kind of &quot;get out of rules free&quot; card. It&#39;s great to help kids understand the reasons behind rules and look for ways to get their own needs and desires met in ways that are respectful of their surroundings. It&#39;s not so great to say &quot;heck with the rules, who needs &#39;em?&quot; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Sara was implying necessarily, but I think its important to be clear that unschooling isn&#39;t &quot;whatever whenever&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112797046">I see the need to clarify any points for people reading (I always<br/>
appreciate this when it&#39;s done, it does help me understand unschooling).<br/>
But I admit it still leaves me feeling frustrated that I didn&#39;t find the<br/>
perfect words the first time.  Let me tell you exactly what happened (while<br/>
making a mental note to be very careful with my words, as I know they are<br/>
being picked apart).  I was giggling, following my 4 year old around as she<br/>
yelled happily &quot;chase me!!&quot; through the structure, saying &quot;weeeeee!&quot; maybe<br/>
louder than she was.  Parents are allowed in to guide their children in<br/>
there.  Apparently when the parent starts actually *enjoying* the playtime<br/>
as much as the child is, that must mean they aren&#39;t the parent.  I was<br/>
approached by the employee there and in a sweet voice one would use with a<br/>
child (I do have a young face), she said &quot;Oh sweetie, you&#39;re too old to play<br/>
in here&quot;.  I looked at her and assured her I am just following my child.<br/>
She was a little abashed at that point....  I think she just honestly<br/>
assumed I was an older sibling because of the way I was ******playing<br/>
uninhibited yet not in a reckless or endangering way to anyone ******.<br/>
Using the phrase &quot;reckless abandon&quot; was my cheeky way of saying I let loose<br/>
like a child.<br/>
<br/>
As for the friend and the laundry detergent, I agree with you on the<br/>
supervision point.  I did not mean she gets into detergent or dangerous<br/>
things daily although I could see how that would be read as such.  I meant<br/>
she is inventive and curious and even mischevious daily, and mom does not<br/>
punish this curiosity.  She takes the responsibility onto herself if she<br/>
wasn&#39;t being watchful enough, as opposed to some parents who might punish<br/>
the child.  Maybe it was an example that was too far off topic.  Thanks for<br/>
the help in clarifying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037734586">Good. I was wondering how she could afford all that laundry soap. <br/>
<br/>
Things do happen -- even when you try to keep dangerous things out of reach, the darned kids grow or figure out the childproofing -- but it doesn&#39;t have to mean a meltdown from Mom every time.<br/>
