<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050074332">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Last years &quot;Intent to Homeschool&quot; letter was a breeze: Horizon Math, <br/>
McRuffy Phonics, Story of the World History, First Language Lessons and <br/>
so on.  What can I write this year for my radical ways?  Anyone have an <br/>
example of theirs?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Amy in Charles Town</div>
