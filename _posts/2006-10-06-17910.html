<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687618281">This is the UNschooling list. Unschooling is different<br/>
from homeschooling. Unschooling is living as though<br/>
schools didn&#39;t exist. What you do with your kids does<br/>
not magically change just because they hit a<br/>
particular age. You continue reading books, playing<br/>
games, listening to music or whatever you do right now<br/>
to make your lives interesting and worth living.<br/>
Learning happens as a side-effect of living<br/>
interesting and full lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So have you been keeping your children on a shelf in a box?  You<br/>
*have* ben homeschooling them all along (unless they are in that box.)<br/>
 UNschooling is simply an extension of what you have already been<br/>
doing.  Taking time to BE with your kids.  Reading them stories,<br/>
taking them to the park and the library and the zoo and to see<br/>
grandma.  Recognizing their interests and continuing to pursue those<br/>
with them.  You don&#39;t have to DO schoolwork with them.  They are going<br/>
to learn, trust that.  There is no preschool curriculum in<br/>
UNschooling.  There is nothing special that is required to let them be<br/>
toddlers.  Just let them be kids!  Enjoy them.  Be free with them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423096249">Can I ask some questions?<br/>
1) When you close your eyes, what do you see happening in a typical  <br/>
preschool?<br/>
2) When you imagine doing this in your home, how do you see yourself  <br/>
starting a homeschool preschool?<br/>
3) What your children learning RIGHT now?<br/>
4) What do your children enjoy doing?<br/>
5) At what age to people start to learn? When do they stop? Why at  <br/>
those ages?<br/>
6) Why are you looking into unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s it, I just know that it&#39;ll help start some conversations!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, I&#39;m in Oklahoma. My kids are all in the  <br/>
signature line.<br/>
