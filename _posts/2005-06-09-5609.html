<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735563298">Thought this was quite cool. I am off to get some paper plates & bobby pins<br/>
to start trying to make some myself, whether or not Dan joins in or not, I<br/>
care not - I thought they were just beautiful!<br/>
 <br/>
Hey - thanks for everyone replies BTW to my other post (the &#39;newbie<br/>
unschooler&#39; one).. I have been sick with flu this last week, and havn&#39;t had<br/>
energy to reply. I will get to it!<br/>
 <br/>
Bye<br/>
