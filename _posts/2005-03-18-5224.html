<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449337404">I laughed at my DH when he bought some. We have a well which is very new and <br/>
alot of silt comes through the filters. Anything that&#39;s white turns brown <br/>
after repeated water contact. Our white bathtub was brown after about a week and <br/>
any kind of spray stuff only got the discolor off after intense scrubbing and <br/>
the rough traction area on the bottom never got clean. So, Joe sprayed the tub <br/>
while I was &quot;relaxing&quot; on the throne and when I got up and walked by the tub <br/>
there where bright white streaks wherever the Ka-Boom touched. I finished <br/>
spraying the areas and called joey up. Look!! I didn&#39;t even wipe it!!<br/>
Absolutely amazing.<br/>
