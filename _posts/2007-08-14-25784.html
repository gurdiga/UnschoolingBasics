Kathryn, I wish your daughter could meet mine. I NEED her to meet some <br/>
unschooled kids ;) (Yes, *I* need it, she is not too sure of this whole thing, but <br/>
I&#39;m steady! lol!)<br/>
<br/>
She sounds like a great person. An interesting young woman that I wish I <br/>
*could* meet in person. She inspired me, well your writing of her, to just <br/>
continue the process, watch it unfold and see what I can do to gently direct along <br/>
the way. I&#39;m struggling with Grace being a schooled child while I attempt an <br/>
unschooled lifestyle - anyway, lol, I&#39;m so happy to read about her <br/>
development and your development. It&#39;s so encouraging! <br/>
<br/>
Karen <br/>
