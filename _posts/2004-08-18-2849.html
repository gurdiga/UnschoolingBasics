<div id="ygrps-yiv-351994273">I was working on a speech about Learning vs Teaching that I&#39;m giving <br/>
at the Sacramento conference this coming weekend. I paused to <br/>
continue &quot;the education of Maelu,&quot; my nine month old dog. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to get her to shake my hand but without much luck. <br/>
It&#39;s never been difficult to teach that to a dog before, so I <br/>
decided to sit back and really watch her for signs that I was doing <br/>
it wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m right-handed, so I always put out my right hand. She&#39;d <br/>
just look at me, at the treat in my hand, and wait me out. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I had a DUH moment and held out my LEFT hand. She politely <br/>
put up her left hand and shook.<br/>
<br/>
Guess she taught me something... or did I learn something? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this must be my opening to ask about unschooling dogs! Yes, <br/>
it&#39;s silly, but I&#39;m really wondering. It seems like most people I <br/>
know who have dogs keep them in cages a lot of the time. And my <br/>
neighbor got a puppy and worked hard to get him on a schedule, which <br/>
is so, ya know, un-AP! <br/>
<br/>
I know dogs are different than humans, though. We will get a dog <br/>
someday and I&#39;ve never liked the idea of animals in cages. Heck, we <br/>
had birds (and my mom still does) that were rarely in their cages and <br/>
did NOT have their wings clipped...<br/>

Well,  this must be my opening to ask about unschooling dogs! Yes, <br/>
it&#39;s silly,  but I&#39;m really wondering. It seems like most people I <br/>
know who have dogs  keep them in cages a lot of the time. And my <br/>
neighbor got a puppy and  worked hard to get him on a schedule, which <br/>
is so, ya know, un-AP!  <br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know about a schedule, but using a crate is a really nice way  to <br/>
live with a dog.   I don&#39;t feed my animals on a schedule.  We  use autofeeders <br/>
and the food is available all the time.  None of my pets  are overweight, but I <br/>
would guess if I had one that woofed its food down that  I&#39;d think twice about <br/>
autofeeders.  But I&#39;d probably leave it out and see  if the dog would ever <br/>
get full.  I&#39;d bet it would relax after a while and  not be so crazed about <br/>
getting it all.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son and his wife have rescued 3 cats, and everyone of them are really,  <br/>
really overweight now.  They dole out the food once or twice a day, and  it&#39;s <br/>
even weightloss food.  The cats don&#39;t eat it all at once.  But  they live in a <br/>
small 1 bedroom apartment, so the cats don&#39;t have as much room to  roam as mine <br/>
do.  My son and I are trying to figure out why his cats are so  fat (all <br/>
about the same age) and mine are not.  I think it has to do with  the very idea <br/>
that the food supply is controlled for his cats and not for  mine.  I think his <br/>
cats eat more because they know sometimes the  bowl gets empty, and they never <br/>
know when it might be their turn to visit  the bowl after the last cat just <br/>
ate the last morsel.  So they  gobble.  <br/>
 <br/>
Our house is open to the pets.  We have a pet door into the kitchen,  and <br/>
they have the whole acre lot fenced in for their to use.  (The cats  don&#39;t stay <br/>
in the fence, though.)  My dog would leave the yard and visit  around the <br/>
neighborhood if there weren&#39;t a fence, but she&#39;d come back because  she knows where <br/>
her bed is.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re about as AP &lt;g&gt; as you can be with animals, but they ARE  animals, and <br/>
not children.  <br/>

her collar on when we go for a ride in the car to get her an ice <br/>
cream cone. I had to teach her to sit for her treats and when I&#39;m <br/>
outside with her. She&#39;s big enough to knock me down. The handshake <br/>
was just for me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
