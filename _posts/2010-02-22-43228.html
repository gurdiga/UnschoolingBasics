<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065912245">I&#39;m new on the list, and I know you&#39;re supposed to lurk awhile before posting... But I found this so thought-provoking that I just couldn&#39;t keep it in :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that it all depends on your definition of &quot;nice&quot;. If by nice you mean sweet in a fake (even manipulative) way, then, yes, we should all scrap it in favor of authenticity! But if by nice you mean kind and considerate, then I fully maintain that you can at least most of the time be that and still be authentic. I have found in my life very few situations where, if you try, you can&#39;t be both authentic and considerate/kind. Sometimes it takes a bit of forethought, and maybe some would say that forethought=inauthenticity, but I disagree. To me, kindness is about finding and connecting with the humanity in another person, even if that other person is not acting in a particularly humane way in that moment. I really have found that most people, if you reach out to them with kindness and humanity and respect, even if you&#39;re telling them something that is very difficult for them to hear (e.g. giving a fundamentally harsh criticism), will respond on a<br/>
 similar frequency. This is not about saying/doing only things that please the other person, but rather about finding a way to communicate something difficult in a way that does not denigrate them. I really do believe that can be done in an authentic way. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe I&#39;m completely missing your point about what &quot;niceness&quot; is! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anyone here with training in/knowledge of nonviolent communication methods and any opinions about this??<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the idea behind what he&#39;s saying but I think his  <br/>
explanation that involves the words &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; can get  <br/>
people&#39;s thoughts twisted up.<br/>
<br/>
First, he defines &quot;nice&quot; to mean &quot;Only say and do things that please  <br/>
others.&quot; People often do use nice to mean that, but they *also* hold  <br/>
several other definitions of nice. And they&#39;re not always clear -- to  <br/>
themselves or others -- which definition they&#39;re using. In fact  <br/>
people don&#39;t even realize they have multiple definitions that vary  <br/>
with context. If asked, they&#39;d be able to define what they mean by  <br/>
nice in a particular context but unconsciously it&#39;s assume there&#39;s an  <br/>
agreed on understanding of what the word &quot;nice&quot; means in the context  <br/>
it&#39;s being used in.<br/>
<br/>
(And they do that because that&#39;s how their moms used the word &quot;nice.&quot;  <br/>
Moms say &quot;Be nice&quot; and kids have to figure out what nice means in  <br/>
that context. Does it mean don&#39;t punch your sister? Don&#39;t use an  <br/>
outside voice? Don&#39;t run? Don&#39;t touch?)<br/>
<br/>
(Good and bad are also words with a mish mosh of meanings. They&#39;re  <br/>
all bad ;-) for clarity.)<br/>
<br/>
And that variable definition problem happened to you with this post  <br/>
of his. Probably happened to most people who read it. When you said  <br/>
&quot;really got me to thinking about asking/coercing our children to be  <br/>
nice&quot; I&#39;m betting you didn&#39;t mean you want to ask and coerce your  <br/>
children to &quot;only say and do things that please others.&quot; You meant  <br/>
that vague changeable definition of nice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d absolutely agree kids shouldn&#39;t be made (or asked) to &quot;only say  <br/>
and do things that please others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But should kids be made or asked to be &quot;nice&quot; as in polite, kind,  <br/>
thoughtful, respectful, helpful? (Those are the words I used around  <br/>
Kathryn. I think they&#39;re much clearer.) A better approach than making  <br/>
or asking kids, is for the parents to *be* polite, kind, thoughtful,  <br/>
respectful, helpful *to the kids* and others. Use and live by the  <br/>
principles. In general kids need to feel the value of those  <br/>
principles before they feel a reason to put in the effort to offer  <br/>
them to others. They need to feel those practiced on them. They need  <br/>
to see them offered to others. They also need to see how you choose  <br/>
less direct paths to a goal (your own or while helping the kids get  <br/>
what they want) in order to be respectful (and so on) of others.<br/>
<br/>
If you are polite, kind, thoughtful, respectful, helpful to the kids,  <br/>
they will, when they&#39;re developmentally able, be polite, kind,  <br/>
thoughtful, respectful, helpful. And if they aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not because  <br/>
they&#39;re being deliberately mean. It&#39;s because they still need help  <br/>
finding the more complex routes to a goal that takes in those other  <br/>
factors.<br/>
<br/>
As for authentic ... I&#39;m really disliking that word the more I hear  <br/>
it used ;-) People are taking it to mean acting on or letting people  <br/>
know their feelings.  It&#39;s the opposite of keeping your feelings to  <br/>
yourself and only saying and doing things that please others.  <br/>
*Neither* of those is good. The first is totally selfish and the  <br/>
other totally selfless. There are better options, options based on  <br/>
meeting your own needs without stomping all over others.<br/>
<br/>
LIttle children do have authentic feelings. Their reactions are based  <br/>
on recent events. If they punch Sarah it&#39;s because Sarah just grabbed  <br/>
the toy from them or they needed to eat an hour ago, not because  <br/>
Sarah wouldn&#39;t let them have a toy last month.<br/>
<br/>
But as they get older, the more hurt they build up that&#39;s ignored or  <br/>
the parents are oblivious to, the more their past influences their  <br/>
current feelings and, consequently, behavior.<br/>
<br/>
A mother who blows up at her kids may feel authentically angry with  <br/>
them. Maybe her parents yelled at her. Maybe she&#39;s hugely stressed  <br/>
for the last few months and at the end of her rope. But acting on or  <br/>
releasing the anger at the kids won&#39;t help. It&#39;s going to do more  <br/>
damage. Stuffing the anger down won&#39;t help either! Better -- and   <br/>
much more difficult but far more worthwhile in the long run -- is to  <br/>
work on the other factors that cause her to feel like blowing up at  <br/>
the kids. Kids need a mom&#39;s support and help, not be the release  <br/>
valve for her &quot;authentic&quot; feelings created by her past.<br/>
<br/>
I think for most adults it&#39;s really hard to have &quot;authentic&quot; -- eg,  <br/>
childlike, not based on past experience -- feelings. In some ways  <br/>
that&#39;s good! Our need to grab something we like from someone else  <br/>
really doesn&#39;t need supported ;-) And feeling love for someone  <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily give us the skills to show it in a way that our  <br/>
loved one understands. But someone who grew up rigidly controlled and  <br/>
when he&#39;s on his own feels like a wild animal released from a cage,  <br/>
no matter how &quot;authentic&quot; those feelings are, acting on those  <br/>
feelings is harming himself.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is to be &quot;authentic&quot; they&#39;re likely to damage  <br/>
relationships. They might feel more powerful and less damaged from  <br/>
their past, but they&#39;re going to trample on relationships.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is relationships, they will need to work on  <br/>
&quot;authentic&quot; feelings that damage relationships when released so they  <br/>
don&#39;t derail themselves from the path to their goal.<br/>

<br/>
The trouble comes when it turns into some kind of rule in your head - Be Kind. That&#39;s something that can be a big issue for moms, in particular - some moms get wrapped up in an idea of who they are as women and mothers that&#39;s tied to this Rule of Nice, as Scott calls it, and will push themselves beyond their own limits and boundaries for the sake of more kindness. <br/>
<br/>
Its an issue that comes up a lot in unschooling discussions, actually, although this is the first time the idea of a Rule of Nice has been articulated in those terms (that I know of). Suggestions to new unschoolers include such advice as &quot;say yes more&quot; and &quot;its okay to be kind to your kids&quot; and because so many unschoolers are trying to be better parents that sometimes leads to parents allowing their own personal boundaries to be squashed - not all parents, but like I said, its an issue that comes up frequently: &quot;don&#39;t I get to have boundaries?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
To some extent, that sort of pendulum-swing is part of how some people learn about unschooling. The vast majority of us grow up used to rules, so it makes sense to think about unschooling as a new set of rules to apply at first. That&#39;s a challenging hurdle to overcome (was for me, although I didn&#39;t have a Rule of Nice, mine was &quot;Better a Bitch than a Doormat&quot; - I Get to be nice, now, and I like that). <br/>
<br/>
At the same time - given what I said about my own internal rule - there are personality issues that play into this topic. I suspect that people who are naturally inclined to please others can have a Rule of Nice and it feels perfectly &quot;authentic&quot; until they run out of energy! <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d be willing to be a lot of the Big Voices on unschooling lists aren&#39;t natural pleasers - any takers?)<br/>

Speaking of good ideas that can turn into rules in people&#39;s heads! I&#39;ve mostly seen NVC in real life used as a (sometimes vicious) tool for manipulation. I like a whooooole lot of the ideas and principles, though - I think they&#39;re a fantastic set of tools for the understanding side of communication, which is arguably the important side ;)<br/>
