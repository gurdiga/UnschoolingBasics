<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616616538">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Someone had written on another list I belong to:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There is a homeschooling working parent yahoo group - not specific <br/>
&gt;unschooling - so my understanding is that there is much talk about <br/>
&gt;getting school work done etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, I decided to change!  The new group is called WRU - Working <br/>
Radical Unschoolers. I just started a new group specifically for <br/>
folks who work and radically unschool their younguns.  Here&#39;s the <br/>
partial list description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This list description is under construction for now, but this is a <br/>
group specifically for Radical Unschooling moms and dads who work, <br/>
either part time or full time, outside the home or inside the home. <br/>
The intention in creating this list is to hold a space for people who <br/>
radically unschool and work (or have worked in the past while <br/>
unschooling or see this coming up in the future). That can be tricky <br/>
to do, and while I have found resources for homeschoolers who work, I <br/>
have yet to find a discussion group for radical unschoolers who work. <br/>
So, I&#39;m creating one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, here&#39;s the address for folks interested in joining:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WRU/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WRU/</a><br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to pass this on!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Marji, who doesn&#39;t have enough to do! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really great!  There have been comments about Mum&#39;s who work<br/>
outside the home before at some of the lists that sounded pretty<br/>
harsh, and it&#39;s nice to know I can connect with other RU parents that<br/>
choose to work outside the home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Marji!<br/>
