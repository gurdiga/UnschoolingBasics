I laugh about this all the time! Newbies come on and say what you said. <br/>
Or they say thatmost people seem to talk about teens all teh time. What <br/>
about little ones? Or all of you seem to have large families, what <br/>
about onelies? Or most families seem to have onely one or two kids, <br/>
what about large families? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure what kind of info I am looking for, but my<br/>
teenagers tend to only want to play video games yet they get bored<br/>
with them. My 15 yo seems to feel that something is missing, yet he<br/>

labor (gets that from his Dad, not me).<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron went through this stage too. I think it&#39;s just the calm before <br/>
the storm! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Science is a broad subject. Can you break it down to something more <br/>
manageable? Geology? Anatomy? Entymology? Ornithology? Zoology? <br/>
Astronomy? Chemistry? Physics?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt all branches of science are equally fascinating. I hate <br/>
rocks---but Deb loves &#39;em! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cars---what about them? Design? Speed? Motors? Racing?<br/>
<br/>
Hard, physical labor---Gardening? Building? Chopping? Toting? Picking <br/>
cotton? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From 12.5 to 14, Cameron pretty much did nothing. Deschooling. Healing.<br/>
<br/>
But at 17, he is soooo busy!<br/>
<br/>
Has he thought of starting his own business? Fifteen can do so much!<br/>
<br/>
Are you coming to the conference? Meeting other teens who are active <br/>
and involved can be so helpful!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know some unschoolers who seem to be motivated to find activities<br/>
that they are interested in, but mine don&#39;t seem to have that<br/>
motivation. Also, our funds are very limited to do ongoing classes<br/>
and such.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
He still may need to heal. I thought Cameron would never come around. <br/>
But he started skateboarding, which led to filming, which led to <br/>
drumming, which is his now passion.<br/>
<br/>
Working is also wonderful. Cameron has met so many people (almost all <br/>
are older). It&#39;s given him a lot of confidence and self-assurance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71996439">Rose - there are LOTS of us here with teenage (and even older) <br/>
unschooled kids. I have three - 14, 17, and 20.<br/>
<br/>
Still - I&#39;m having trouble responding to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just need to get more interesting stuff going on in your <br/>
family life? Take a trip? Get a series of great movies? Start a tv <br/>
series from the beginning (We&#39;ve been watching West Wing starting with <br/>
the first season. My 20 yo has been watching The Sopranos, starting <br/>
with the first season -- getting them from Netflix, by the way). Cook a <br/>
big feast? Have a party? Remodel the kids&#39; rooms? If they still like <br/>
video games but seem bored with them, too, then get them started <br/>
playing online multiplayer games maybe?<br/>
<br/>
What do YOU do that is interesting?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147776489">Sometimes my 15 y/o finds a video game that he likes and stays up all night<br/>
playing it...and if it&#39;s really one he likes, I may not see him but just a<br/>
few minutes here and there for a few days &lt;grin&gt;. But he&#39;s also in 4-H<br/>
(president of the club), has a part-time job that he loves (working at the<br/>
local feed store), and bow hunts about 4 months out of the year :)  He<br/>
recently came back from Washington DC (4-H trip), but called every night<br/>
saying it was ok, but that he missed us and wished he were home (definitely<br/>
sounds like he&#39;s a child slave, doesn&#39;t it? LOL)  He also rides his bike to<br/>
the local rec center to swim and workout with friends.   He took a college<br/>
entry algebra class last year (was free, and taught by a senior university<br/>
student who had been homeschooled), simply because a homeschool friend of<br/>
his was going. Turned out that he liked the class :)<br/>
<br/>
Lately he&#39;s been becoming more involved with the youth group at church and<br/>
thinking about going to South America as a youth missionary.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s never been what I would call a motivated child, so what I do is keep my<br/>
eyes and ears open for any opportunity that involves youth, and then pass<br/>
the info on to him. Sometimes he just shrugs and says he&#39;s not interested,<br/>
and other times he take the idea and runs with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465522126">Hi Pam, Thank you for not evaluating every word I said.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are right, we do need to get more interesting stuff <br/>
going on in our family life. We definitely don&#39;t need any trips. We <br/>
have spent the last two years taking trips to visit and care for my <br/>
Mother who had been sick. I guess I am trying to figure out once <br/>
again how to concentrate on helping my children find what they need <br/>
to make life more intersting. We watch movies, they play online <br/>
games, they&#39;ve done all that stuff and it just seems to be boring. <br/>
They&#39;re just tired of it. The only thing we haven&#39;t done is have a <br/>
party. That sounds like a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
I guess it used to be easy when they were younger and they would go <br/>
outside for hours looking for bugs, snakes, lizards and whatever <br/>
creature they could find and research them so much they could <br/>
embarrass most adults with the amount of info they have in their <br/>
heads about wildlife. They&#39;ve built ponds after researching how to <br/>
do it, even building their own bio filter.<br/>
<br/>
They used to play legos or k&#39;nex for hours upon end, but even my <br/>
youngest doesn&#39;t do that much anymore. They&#39;ve built a dog/cat <br/>
house, mouse houses, invented mouse traps and dog treat dispensers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for a specific solution on how to fix anything. <br/>
Maybe I just was wondering, just wishing I could peek in on the <br/>
lives of other unschoolers who have already gotten to this point in <br/>
their lives and worked through it.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of someone bashing this inarticulate little post of mine, <br/>
could you please just maybe give me something like &quot;a day in the <br/>
life of a teenage unschooler&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Please be gentle with me.<br/>
Rose<br/>

So quit worrying about them?  What have you always wanted to do?  What have you secretly thought &quot;Someday....&quot; about?<br/>
<br/>
Well, consider today to be &quot;someday.&quot;  Get out, get interested and before you know it your kids will be there with you.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am learning gardening, how to make cheese, developing a sourdough bread recipe, making an afghan for our exchange student to take home, having an exchange student &lt;grin&gt;, and just learned how to make lace by hand (tatting).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070196417">Hi Pam,<br/>
Thanks again for the response. I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the <br/>
head. We had been active in our lovely unschool group but have not <br/>
been able to get together over the summer. Also, there has been a <br/>
lack of older teenage boys in the group. Now, Ren is leaving us and <br/>
taking away one of those teenage boys! I guess I am going to have to <br/>
figure out how to attract more teenage boys, and girls too, of <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
I really do appreciate hearing what other unschool teenagers do. <br/>
Just mentioning what your teens do can help inspire ideas for other <br/>
teens and parents of teens. Thanks for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that Aaron has found one new outlet for social <br/>
interaction. Our local Hospice has a teen volunteer program which he <br/>
has participated in. Previously he had not really worked with other <br/>
teens much doing this, but now he is helping with the teen council <br/>
and seems to be enjoying it. Maybe he can get more of his homeschool <br/>
friends to join in!<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas coming people. I bet there are many other unschoolers <br/>
on this list that need ideas for teens, too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707321563">&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt; Because I suggest so many things and they shoot it<br/>
down. So, Im getting bored.&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think Julie&#39;s advice is stellar!<br/>
If YOU are leading the life of your dreams, if YOU are following your <br/>
passions and interests, your children will have the best example of <br/>
ALL!!<br/>
<br/>
I think homeschooling parents have a tendency to focus on their <br/>
children..what are they learning?, how can I GET them to do <br/>
something?, HOW do I get them out the door?.<br/>
Let it go.<br/>
<br/>
I bet they&#39;re perfectly happy with their lives and if they aren&#39;t, <br/>
they certainly aren&#39;t going to seek out new experiences with a parent <br/>
that is trying too hard to get them to try new things.<br/>
Trying new things should just be an extension of a house full of <br/>
happy, interesting people, pursuing their lives.  I get really <br/>
excited about new information...some of it excites the kids, some of <br/>
it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
Either way, I&#39;m not invested in the outcome because it&#39;s TRUE <br/>
excitement...not for the purpose of &quot;getting&quot; anyone to do anything.<br/>

My boys  are also uninterested in ANYTHING organized.  It is very<br/>
discouraging  to me.  Because I suggest so many things and they shoot it<br/>
down.   So, Im getting bored.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The absolute best advice I ever got when first unschooling was to  follow my <br/>
own passions.  It has steamrolled into lives for both for us all  that are <br/>
busy, exciting and fun!<br/>
My kids understand that each day is filled with possibilities because they  <br/>
have seen my enthusiasm and love for the things I do.<br/>
 <br/>
I was a structured rule oriented parent who learned to trust her  children <br/>
and allow delight to come into our lives.  This week I have 6  kids here from <br/>
ages 12-16 and today I bought lots of water  balloons and some red pool dye.  I <br/>
really wanted to see what the pool  would look like red and it is so cool!!  <br/>
Three of the kids have been  in it much of the day and all of them thanked me <br/>
for coloring the pool.   Such a simple thing....a few dollars....a lots of fun. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t suggest things that often in the summer because it&#39;s seldom that  all <br/>
five will want to do the same thing....I usually say something like..&quot;.I&#39;m  <br/>
headed to Barnes and Noble and the pet store for awhile..anyone want to  come?&quot; <br/>
 Sometimes I&#39;ll get one or two for that trip.  Next time, it  might be my <br/>
husband saying..&quot;I really want to watch the shuttle go up on  Tuesday...anyone <br/>
want to go?&quot;  Last week, two of the boys went with him and  they plan on trying <br/>
again when it goes up next week.  I&#39;m a big believer in  spontaneity.  They <br/>
also all have different interests and at some point  we&#39;ll do something each of <br/>
them loves that may lead to other connections for  them. Occasionally we&#39;ll <br/>
all do something together like the beach or dinner out  but that is less and <br/>
less as they get older.<br/>
 <br/>
In the last week, either I or my husband or both of us has taken some  of the <br/>
kids to the beach, to play miniature golf, to drive go-carts, to the  shuttle <br/>
launch, to a guitar store, to Jo-Anns, to the library, to Target to buy  <br/>
Apples to Apples,  to a pizza place for dinner, to Barnes and Noble, to see  a <br/>
movie, to Walmart of get a frisbee, to rent movies......<br/>
 <br/>
The kids have played guitars, listened to music, played mulitiple monopoly  <br/>
games, swam in the pool, gotten henna tattoos from Brenna, used slingshots to  <br/>
shoot berries off the tree from the top of the house, played Apples to Apples, <br/>
 played video games, played Scrabble, spent time on the computer, and had <br/>
endless  conversations both with each other and with us.  They also stay up much  <br/>
later than us and I&#39;m sure have entire lives after we go to bed! :-)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m available to take them places but I also find time to read or get on  the <br/>
computer or do other things I love  (or pack which is my latest  passion <br/>
because I&#39;m moving across the country in 10 days!)   <br/>
 <br/>
I continue to believe that if a parent is excited and happy about  my  their <br/>
own life, it can only carry over to everyone in the  family.  It may take <br/>
awhile but it&#39;s contagious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953588862">When my dad was dying we only spent a few months travelling back and forth to <br/>
see him, not two years. It was still very very hard to fit back into our <br/>
regular lives. Some of course was the sadness left behind after his death. Some <br/>
was that the world had changed forever - how my kids saw me and our <br/>
relationships to each other, their relationship to a world where people they loved could <br/>
suddenly go from mostly healthy to dying, their sense of what was important and <br/>
what wasn&#39;t. We had a little bit of struggle in figuring out what they really <br/>
wanted to do in this shifted world. <br/>
<br/>
Things that have gone on long enough to become commonplace, like trips to <br/>
care for ailing relatives, leave holes when they end, no matter how they end. <br/>
<br/>
Possibly, the teens ennui has more to do with those big life changes than <br/>
just with them being teens?  <br/>

Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Sunday and I&#39;m fairly new to the list.  Just been listening<br/>
in.  I have two boys, seven and three.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for less<br/>
than a year and are probably just moving out of the de-schooling phase.<br/>
I LOVE all the information and ideas that are given. I absolutely plan<br/>
to be a completely radical unschooler one day!   Don&#39;t worry about<br/>
hurting my feelings in your response.  I&#39;m here to learn!!!  (You can<br/>
hear the &#39;good student&#39; in my already.)<br/>
 <br/>
My comment is about Gail&#39;s quote above.  I&#39;ve heard this again and<br/>
again, and what I find is that it&#39;s hard for me to translate my passions<br/>
into anything my kids would be interested in.  I&#39;m not crafty, artful or<br/>
musically inclined.  I don&#39;t necessarily like games.  I work out of my<br/>
home, and I&#39;m on the computer or on the phone when I work, if I&#39;m not<br/>
out at meetings or speaking engagements.  I&#39;m a &#39;big idea&#39; person and a<br/>
visionary in the adult world, but not so good with the minutia or<br/>
translating those big ideas to my children.  I loved school and have<br/>
been a perpetual student all my life.   I love to read, read, read.  The<br/>
only things I know how to &#39;strew&#39; are books.  (This can only go so far<br/>
with two small energetic boys.)   <br/>
 <br/>
Although I love unschooling and believe in it wholeheartedly, my<br/>
confession is that sometimes I think I&#39;m not cut out to be an<br/>
unschooling mom.  In my moments of frustration, I think unschooling only<br/>
works for crafty, energetic, creative, get on the ground, get messy<br/>
kinds of moms.   Are there other moms like me who are successfully and<br/>
joyful unschooling?  Since my boys are young I&#39;ve got some time to grow<br/>
into it all, just let me know there&#39;s hope!<br/>
 <br/>
I look forward to connecting faces to names at the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference in October!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

Hi Sunday (waving from Tucson),<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To me, the importance in following YOUR own passions doesn&#39;t mean that your<br/>
kids need to share those same passions.  You are modeling the process -<br/>
&quot;follow your passion&quot; - to them.  Sometimes your children will end up<br/>
sharing your passions, sometimes they won&#39;t.  Like reading - you might hope<br/>
your children will share your passion for reading - maybe they will, maybe<br/>
they won&#39;t.  But even if they do, they won&#39;t necessarily be interested in<br/>
the same reading material.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of my passions is dancing.  This means my dh & I are out many - 4 or 5<br/>
nights a week.  It takes  a lot of work to follow our passion & for me to<br/>
arrange playdates, sleepovers, childcare, etc for my kids.  My kids don&#39;t<br/>
share our passion yet.  Well, I take that back.  My daughter, Sierra, 6,<br/>
does love to dance.  I suspect that she will want to learn West Coast Swing<br/>
when she is older so she can share our specific passion with us.  I suspect<br/>
that my son, Quentin, 9, won&#39;t.  Maybe when he is older - who knows?  He is<br/>
very particular about what kind of music he enjoys listening to.  And some<br/>
of it includes music that we dance to.  Everything is connected :-)<br/>
<br/>
He  is passionate about pokemon LOL.  He mentioned the other day that he&#39;d<br/>
like to go to Japan because that is where Pokemon originated!  So we may<br/>
have to make some travel plans.   He is also passionate about his X-box<br/>
games and playing with his best friends.  <br/>

<br/>
Hi Sunday,<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to translate your interests.  Your interests are just that....yours.  Do what you love, enjoy your life, be an example of a life long learner.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am playing with sourdough cultures.  My kids aren&#39;t interested in baking much less eating sourdough.  But they end up hanging on the periphery, if not jumping in the middle of what I&#39;m doing.....<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Danny was sitting on the counter talking to me while I cleaned the kitchen.  I pointed out to him that the sourdough culture sitting next to him will occassionally &quot;breathe&quot;.  He thought that was amazing, went to get his sisters, they all crowded around and we got to have a great discussion about live vs. dead food, nutrition, microbiology, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to get Danny interested in sourdough per se....I just pointed out a kind of cool thing that I thought would appeal to a 6yo boy.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing could be done with anything...with computers.  If you think your son would think it was cool to see how the computer cuts and pastes...and he is hanging with you...show him.  If he likes it, cool.  If not, that is cool too.<br/>

LOL, my 12yo son also loves Pokemon.  He is also big into 4-H which has a student exchange program with Japan.  Tomorrow, we pick up a 12yo Japanese boy who will be staying with us for a month and ....you guessed it, he loves Pokemon too.  My Zach can&#39;t wait.<br/>
<br/>
Because the boy is coming, we decided to redecorate Zach&#39;s room.....it really needed it.  My 14yo and I ripped out walls and ceilings.  We all did lots and lots of painting, lots of shopping and price comparisons, Dh learned how to install parquet flooring &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Because we will actually be having several house guests during the exchange time, we are maneuvering sleeping arrangements, etc., and kids are negotiating, making offers, thinking of others......<br/>
<br/>
It really is all connected.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709489566">Hi Sunday<br/>
I&#39;ve heard this again and<br/>
again, and what I find is that it&#39;s hard for me to translate my passions<br/>
into anything my kids would be interested in.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not remotely interested in anything I am interested in. I am a herbalist and if I get my stuff out the kids roll their eyes to the ceiling but they love planting herbs and growing them and drying them and that has led on to one of my dd being interested in homeopathy and the other aromatherapy.  It just happened cos of me and my herbs. My other dd likes painting them. My sons are computer orientated. Whereas my only interested in the  computer is for e mailing and surfing e bay lol but they saw me on it and use it themselves for what interests them. My children see me as a life long learner. I have them to thank for that. They inspire me tbh. I am 44 and still try out new stuff and do new things. They see that learning does not stop at 16. Nor does it have to be confined to courses or books.<br/>

<br/>
My dd just finished 6th grade and we&#39;re (both!) deschooling big <br/>
time.  Right now she&#39;s into World of Warcraft, a computer game with <br/>
online interaction.   She also likes video games, gameboy for when <br/>
we&#39;re on our way somewhere or waiting.  I&#39;m getting ready to submit <br/>
my first LOI this week, so I&#39;m finalizing that.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to comment on is the life long learner aspect.  Ruth, <br/>
I&#39;m glad you wrote that, as that&#39;s how I see myself, I&#39;ve always <br/>
liked learning new things, whether they be indepth or just passing <br/>
interests.  I&#39;m hoping this is what I pass on to her most of all.  I <br/>
love to read, my dd doesn&#39;t.  She hates math, has a very negative <br/>
mindset towards it because of school.  So, while she&#39;s deschooling, <br/>
and I&#39;m not working for the first time ever in my life, I&#39;m reading <br/>
and doing things I enjoy, hoping that when she&#39;s ready, she&#39;ll move <br/>
on to some of her other interests.   Also not knowing how our town <br/>
will respond to our LOI, will determine how much &quot;schooly&quot; stuff we <br/>
may have to do (I&#39;m going to submit a narrative at the end of the <br/>
year, hoping they won&#39;t try to push for a standardized test, very few <br/>
in my town homeschool, no unschoolers, one family with 2 kids in elem <br/>
school submit a portfolio).   So, my biggest concern, this first <br/>
year, is what we will actually have to provide.   Once I send my <br/>
letter and (hopefully) hear back positively I&#39;ll relax more and move <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to stand back and unschool.  I know it&#39;s what&#39;s best for <br/>
our family and I have to constantly work on my attitude about it and <br/>
relax more!<br/>

I&#39;m not looking for a specific solution on how to fix anything.<br/>
Maybe I just was wondering, just wishing I could peek in on the<br/>
lives of other unschoolers who have already gotten to this point in<br/>
their lives and worked through it.<br/>
<br/>
could you please just maybe give me something like &quot;a day in the<br/>
life of a teenage unschooler&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s 17. Right now he&#39;s at Not Back to School Camp in West <br/>
Virginia. I understand he&#39;s having a blast. I can&#39;t give you an example <br/>
of a specific day, but I can give you an idea of some of the things he <br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
The last three weeks, he has been housesitting, so he hasn&#39;t even been <br/>
at home except to visit. He started this business when a friend of ours <br/>
needed someone to look after her dogs one weekend. It&#39;s turned into an <br/>
almost full-time gig. He stays at the house---doesn&#39;t just feed the <br/>
dogs, but cares for the house too. He walks the dogs, brushes them, <br/>
makes sure they get meds, waters plants, takes care of mail and papers, <br/>
waters lawns---whatever. He&#39;s in high demand!<br/>
<br/>
He works for two caterers parttime---it&#39;s sporadic. Some weeks he works <br/>
5-6 days per week. Others, he hardly works at all. He delivers a local <br/>
newspaper on Wednesdays. They&#39;ve told me he&#39;s their best employee.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s started a band---took it upon himself to search out members. He <br/>
set up the practice schedule (Tuesday & Friday nights, sometimes on <br/>
Sundays). They meet in our garage. He contacted a guy a couple of weeks <br/>
ago to record them. That happened the night before he left for camp. He <br/>
has a CD! &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re writing their own music and are now looking to <br/>
set up a playing gig in town. Cameron plays the drums. He&#39;s out in the <br/>
garage 2-4 hours per day---sometimes more. The house-sitting puts a <br/>
dent in drumming some days! :-(<br/>
<br/>
He volunteers one night a week (Mondays) at the local independent film <br/>
theatre. He gets to watch the week&#39;s movie for free and has met some <br/>
really neat people. He worked with a few of them on a movie short last <br/>
fall as a camera operator.<br/>
<br/>
He swore he&#39;s never read again after he left school, but he subcribes <br/>
to two drumming magazines, Modern Drummer and Relix. Reads them cover <br/>
to cover. He&#39;s also into Phish and The Grateful Dead and Jimi <br/>
Hendrix---reads all about them and the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a hippie! &lt;g&gt; He shops at thrift stores and makes some of his own <br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
He has a girlfriend (dating for over two years now). He spends time <br/>
with her almost every day.<br/>
<br/>
He pays his own car insurance and gas and maintenance (the car was a <br/>
gift from us).<br/>
<br/>
He draws. Not as much as he used to, but he still dabbles. I bet that <br/>
will pick up after we finish the room above the garage. We&#39;re putting a <br/>
bathroom and AC up there and dividing it into a music room for the band <br/>
and an art studio.<br/>
<br/>
He helps me out around the house. He has certain things he prefers to <br/>
do---like empty the dishwasher (and I HATE doing that!) and garbage <br/>
collection (my hippie insists that I don&#39;t recycle nearly enough, so he <br/>
does it for me! &lt;g&gt;). He does some heavy lifting of things I&#39;m getting <br/>
too old to do---especially garden work. He takes care of our two cats <br/>
and the rabbit. I care for the dogs, the rats, and the bees.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t watch much tv. He records That 70&#39;s Show and the Cosby Show <br/>
on TiVo---that&#39;s pretty much all he watches regularly. He likes movies, <br/>
though, so he&#39;ll watch with us.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s into meditation and occasionally goes to the Buddhist temple.<br/>
<br/>
He loves to travel. This year, he&#39;s been to Albuquerque, NM to visit <br/>
friends and West VA for camp. We all went to Orlando and DisneyWorld <br/>
for a week in February. He&#39;s going to England and Scotland with my dad <br/>
in September for ten days. He&#39;ll be at the conference with us in St <br/>
Louis in October. He loves music festivals and went to Bonaroo (TN) <br/>
with his dad in June. He&#39;d like to do more festivals this fall; <br/>
hopefully he can make LEAF in NC the weekend after the conference.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s REALLY busy. But this happened after months and months and months <br/>
of lying around after we took him out of school at the end of sixth <br/>
grade. He did almost nothing for 18 months---just sleeping, eating, <br/>
watching tv, IMing on the computer, and talking on the phone. He <br/>
deperately needed time to heal.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so exciting  to watch him do so much and be so happy. He knows he <br/>
has a pretty sweet life---especially when he sees the lives of some of <br/>
his friends---school and homework and chore lists. He&#39;s truly doing <br/>
what he loves to do---almost all the time!<br/>
<br/>
Does that give you some idea of what all he&#39;s involved in? It&#39;s not a <br/>
&quot;typical day&quot; but it comes close to how he has to manage his time to do <br/>
all he wants to do.<br/>

Gail wrote:<br/>
&quot;The absolute best advice I ever got when first unschooling was to<br/>
follow my<br/>
own passions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sunday and I&#39;m fairly new to the list.  Just been listening<br/>
in.  I have two boys, seven and three.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for less<br/>
than a year and are probably just moving out of the de-schooling phase.<br/>
I LOVE all the information and ideas that are given. I absolutely plan<br/>
to be a completely radical unschooler one day!   Don&#39;t worry about<br/>
hurting my feelings in your response.  I&#39;m here to learn!!!  (You can<br/>
hear the &#39;good student&#39; in my already.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very cool!  Open and eager! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My comment is about Gail&#39;s quote above.  I&#39;ve heard this again and<br/>
again, and what I find is that it&#39;s hard for me to translate my passions<br/>
into anything my kids would be interested in.  I&#39;m not crafty, artful or<br/>
musically inclined.  I don&#39;t necessarily like games.  I work out of my<br/>
home, and I&#39;m on the computer or on the phone when I work, if I&#39;m not<br/>
out at meetings or speaking engagements.  I&#39;m a &#39;big idea&#39; person and a<br/>
visionary in the adult world, but not so good with the minutia or<br/>
translating those big ideas to my children.  I loved school and have<br/>
been a perpetual student all my life.   I love to read, read, read.  The<br/>
only things I know how to &#39;strew&#39; are books.  (This can only go so far<br/>
with two small energetic boys.)<br/>
<br/>
Although I love unschooling and believe in it wholeheartedly, my<br/>
confession is that sometimes I think I&#39;m not cut out to be an<br/>
unschooling mom.  In my moments of frustration, I think unschooling only<br/>
works for crafty, energetic, creative, get on the ground, get messy<br/>
kinds of moms.   Are there other moms like me who are successfully and<br/>
joyful unschooling?  Since my boys are young I&#39;ve got some time to grow<br/>
into it all, just let me know there&#39;s hope!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh---I&#39;m one of those &quot;crafty, energetic, creative, get on the <br/>
ground, get messy&quot; kind of moms! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it depends on what kind of kids you have too---or what you can <br/>
think of to help them get what they need.<br/>
<br/>
Genetically, your kids could be a lot like you: you might luck out <br/>
there! &lt;g&gt; If not, you might need to find them outlets that would spur <br/>
their interests. Like a Lego team or robotics group or 4-H or <br/>
---whatever their interests are. You may do more driving than some of <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;big idea&quot; part of you could be involved in making things happen. <br/>
Like a conference! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important for them to see you passionate about things. If <br/>
you like reading and discussing philosophical points---let them see you <br/>
do that. Join Toastmasters. A debate team. Write your own book. Join a <br/>
poetry club. Host a mystery dinner. Do what you love.<br/>
<br/>
It doens&#39;t matter that it&#39;s not something *they* would be interested <br/>
in. They may or may not join you. But they *will* see that it&#39;s <br/>
important to follow a dream or or pursue a passion.<br/>
<br/>
LET them see that. They&#39;ll either join you or realize that there&#39;s <br/>
something else calling them!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to connecting faces to names at the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference in October!<br/>

This is encouraging, my dd just finished 6th grade and is pretty much <br/>
on the computer for the greater part of the day (she just got World of <br/>
Warcraft, a game with online interaction, so she&#39;s totally exploring <br/>
it.  Before that she was big time into Runescape, another online <br/>
interactive game.  Her typing skills have improved, however her <br/>
spelling is the shortcut style because they use short, quick posts).  <br/>
She loves to sleep in and get up when she&#39;s done sleeping.  We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about getting together at the traditional start of school in Sep <br/>
to talk about how we&#39;re going to proceed, (she thought Sep wouldbe a <br/>
good time to do this because she&#39;s ALWAYS been in school and, even <br/>
though she&#39;s so happy to be home, she occassionally feels a little <br/>
strange about how it&#39;s going to be).  We&#39;re going to discuss things <br/>
that need to be done around the house etc (I&#39;m home full time for the <br/>
first time EVER!) but I want her to have a say in what we do.  For kids <br/>
to learn to be respectful and responsible they need to be respected <br/>
themselves, for their opionions, input, thoughts, likes and dislikes.  <br/>
This is personally important to me because my mother and I didn&#39;t have <br/>
a very close relationship and I always felt she was angry at me <br/>
for &quot;something&quot; (she passed away almost 11 yrs ago to cancer).  <br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful post Kelly.  Your son has such a full life!   Thank <br/>
you for sharing.<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;ll need plenty of sleep and even more time and patience on your <br/>
part. School can suck a huge part of them O-U-T. They need time to <br/>
heal! Sleep and play and good food will do wonders.<br/>

Do it tomorrow! Or wait until November! Don&#39;t let school still rule <br/>
your lives! Do things AGAINST their clock, not with it!<br/>
<br/>
Look at what you&#39;ve done already this summer--trips, computer time <br/>
(that&#39;s really important in school), movies, cooking---whatever---and <br/>
have your &quot;school year&quot; start retroactively in June---just after she <br/>

Sure, but remember the healing that needs to happen! If she were to <br/>
have been in a bad car accident, you would allow her time to heal <br/>
before you started to assign jobs and make requirements. Think of her <br/>
time in school the same way. Do for her a llittle more. Be with her a <br/>

<br/>
Good point.  We HAVE been discussing it for a long time, because it <br/>
took her longer than me to embrace leaving school.   I was honoring <br/>
her suggestion to have that discussion then, but I&#39;ll just wait and <br/>
see and not &quot;schedule&quot; it, how&#39;s that?!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Look at what you&#39;ve done already this summer--trips, computer time <br/>

you have hours and hours or days and days of school already <br/>
documentable!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing this - in fact, one thing I first wrote down was when <br/>
she started writing a book &quot;just for herself&quot;, not for a school <br/>
assignment, back in January, got quite a few chapters done.  Yes, I <br/>
agree, it doesn&#39;t have to be stuff done &quot;after&quot; the beginning of the <br/>
school year.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cameron had a hard time that first year because all his friends <br/>

and  unprepared for the &quot;real world&quot;-----be careful that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
get caught up in that!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s always been a &quot;loner&quot; in school, not a crowd follower, spoke <br/>
her mind (politely) when harrassed, and stuck up for the underdog at <br/>
times.   She had a few friends in school, but none that will bug her, <br/>
in fact, they&#39;re jealous and wish they could homeschool too (me too, <br/>
but not something I can do anything about).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Sure, but remember the healing that needs to happen! If she were to<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely!  Again, this is something SHE wants to do, she wants to <br/>
be involved in household stuff, but I am mindful of choices and not <br/>
assigning jobs or making requirements.  My husband, fortunately, is <br/>
pretty good about &quot;housework&quot; (he LOVES water, I think he didn&#39;t have <br/>
enough water play as a child, so he loves any job involving it, <br/>
toilets, dishes, etc!).  We were both working full time, so we would <br/>
work together on weekends to get the worst of it done, because it&#39;s <br/>
important to us (my house is NOT perfect!  I&#39;m talking about vac, <br/>
dishes, laundry etc).   Now that I&#39;m home, one of the things we&#39;ve <br/>
(dh and I) agreed to is that I would be able to keep up with the day <br/>
to day clutter, a little each day.   Let me stress that I&#39;m not <br/>
making a big deal about having an immaculate house, it&#39;s just <br/>
something that has always bugged us as a family when we both working <br/>
FT and now it&#39;s something that, as part of our new unschooling life <br/>
style, we want to change.   We just built a new house and have lots <br/>
of stuff to unpack and organize - we talk about doing what we enjoy, <br/>
well, I want to organize (finally!) all my stuff.  It&#39;s part of what <br/>
I want to do (joyfully!).<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve come to unschooling and read about a whole different way <br/>
of living than a lot of people I know go about their days, I&#39;ve found <br/>
myself doing things for dh and dd (i.e. get them a drink when they <br/>
needed one but hadn&#39;t done anything about it yet etc) or if I was <br/>
near the frig and they asked for one etc.  I also find now that dd <br/>
will ask me &quot;do you want a drink?&quot; sometimes if she&#39;s in the frig <br/>
(I&#39;m just using the drink as an example).  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m <br/>
expressing myself the way I want, but it&#39;s nice to see the beginnings <br/>
of the choices to do things for each other made freely that I see <br/>
written about so much here and other places.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s always been close to me, is rather cautious.  She knows that I <br/>
respect her as an individual and she&#39;s able to talk to me (the good, <br/>
the bad and the ugly we call it!) where I was never able to have an <br/>
opinion when I was growing up.  I want that to be different for her <br/>
than it was for me (and I think I&#39;m heading in the right direction).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, once again for your input.  It helps me sort things out.<br/>

Good point.  We HAVE been discussing it for a long time, because it<br/>
took her longer than me to embrace leaving school.   I was honoring<br/>
her suggestion to have that discussion then, but I&#39;ll just wait and<br/>
see and not &quot;schedule&quot; it, how&#39;s that?!<br/>
<br/>
Better! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You&#39;re expressing it just fine---and we see that too. Frequent &quot;can I <br/>
get you anything from the kitchen?&quot; questions as they walk out of the <br/>
den. They&#39;ve heard it so much from me or Ben that it&#39;s almost <br/>
automatic! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Cameron had a hard time that first year because all his friends were<br/>
still in school and would IM him about how he would be stupid and<br/>
unprepared for the &quot;real world&quot;-----be careful that she doesn&#39;t get<br/>
caught up in that!!!<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
I have this problem too.  How DO you keep them from getting caught up in<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hell if I know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I struggled with it so much! He&#39;d bought into it after so many years in <br/>
school---and a private prep school to boot!<br/>
<br/>
I sat next to him one night while he IMed one girl from school. She <br/>
went on and on about how he would never amount to anything without <br/>
school---how he&#39;s never learn algebra or history or phyisics or a <br/>
foriegn language or....<br/>
<br/>
I helped him write back---asking her about certain things and <br/>
reassuring him that he&#39;d be just fine.<br/>
<br/>
What helped the most was time. He left school at the end of sixth <br/>
grade. His friends were starting algebra and writing and reading TONS. <br/>
He did not much of anything: he was proving her point! Then he slowly <br/>
climbed out of that. If I had stopped nagging and whining at him a bit <br/>
sooner, I feel *sure* he would have climbed out faster---My bad! He <br/>
started slowly finding interests and getting out and doing. He was <br/>
skateboarding and filming--he was finally active. He got his driver&#39;s <br/>
license. I supported all of it---financially and emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while, but he watched as his friends, who were die-hard <br/>
school-is-mandatory-at-all-costs. He watched them become more and more <br/>
disillusioned with school. Four of his friends were asked to leave the <br/>
private school because they would eventually bring the high school <br/>
numbers down---they weren&#39;t competeive enough. They all went to public <br/>
schools and goofed off. They hated their schools, their teachers, their <br/>
parents, their lives. Two of them were arrested. One&#39;s mom told him she <br/>
never wanted to see him again; he lives with his dad now. They&#39;re <br/>
really good, sweet kids who just rebelled at what they perceived as <br/>
injustices.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily (or not?), Cameron avoided all these horrible things that were <br/>
happening to his friends. He can look at it more objectively now. I <br/>
think that had he remained in school, it would have sucked the very <br/>
life out of him. He would have been a solid &quot;B&quot; student. He would have <br/>
struggled, but done OK, school-wise. But the rest of him would have <br/>
died. He knows this too. Now. Now he&#39;s as gung-ho as anyone could be <br/>
about unschooling. I think he knows it saved him.<br/>
<br/>
I hope others who pull their kids out don&#39;t get caught up in this. It&#39;s <br/>
just so hard to get through. Meeting other really cool unschoolers <br/>
helped---helped him see they weren&#39;t as odd as some of the homeschooled <br/>
teens he&#39;d met. Time helped the most---and distance from the schools.<br/>
