<div id="ygrps-yiv-170260314">Not sure what the policies are in Italy but there are a few homeschool groups I&#39;ve seen around. I would be careful mainly because since your son holds dual citizenship that could bring him directly under the laws of Italy. I would suspect they are similar to Argentina where our daughter also holds dual citizenship and where it would be illegal to homeschool our daughter were we to live there full time. Just check carefully. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905028984">homeschooling is basically possible in italy. we plan to do so. like  <br/>
everything in italy, it is not really clear, it needs a bit of  <br/>
research to find out how it is actually working. for further  <br/>
information, there is an italian mailinglist for homeschoolers with  <br/>
also some unschoolers. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/scuolafamiliare/">http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/scuolafamiliare/</a><br/>
