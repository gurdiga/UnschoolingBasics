<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448406431">My three kids (ages 8, 11 & 13) had a neighbor kid over (9 year old <br/>
boy in public school) yesterday, playing in our backyard. I was in <br/>
and out and didn&#39;t detect any issues or problems. <br/>
<br/>
Later that night, Jacqueline (the newly turned 8 year old) was <br/>
telling me what happened. She said that the boy was trying to hit <br/>
Shawna (my 11 year old) with a stick and that Shawna told him to <br/>
stop, which he did. Then, he was trying to hit my son (13 years old) <br/>
with a baseball. Again, they asked him to stop. Jacqueline told me <br/>
that Shawna asked him &quot;Why are you like that? Where do you think you <br/>
learned to be like that?&quot;. <br/>
LOL A therapist in the making. <br/>
Jacqueline told me that she said to him &quot;We&#39;re not violent in this <br/>
family-we&#39;re unschoolers! You need to stop!&quot;. <br/>
That&#39;s my baby...advocate for peaceful unschooling. :-) <br/>
I asked them why they didn&#39;t tell me and the girls said that <br/>
they &quot;wanted to try and talk to him first, kid to kid, and see if <br/>
they could get through to him&quot;. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924849565">Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve missed so much being busy with packing, and<br/>
looking for a new place to live, I see I&#39;ve missed a<br/>
lot. I thought I&#39;d share what I learned about my son. <br/>
I knew he was upset that we had to get rid of his cat.<br/>
I thought that was the main reason for attacking the<br/>
new kittens. To me that sounded about right. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. I feel so bad for not<br/>
seeing it sooner. But my son was/is distraut (I think<br/>
that&#39;s the right word) over moving. <br/>
We&#39;ve looked at some bad offers, and some nice places<br/>
didn&#39;t work out. We are hoping the place we look at on<br/>
Tuesday works out, because this is so very upseting<br/>
for him and us. I wish things were going more<br/>
smoothly, for all of us. <br/>
Ren, I wasn&#39;t ignoring him. I don&#39;t think he could<br/>
tell me. Sometimes I wonder if he&#39;s autistic. I know<br/>
it&#39;s just who he is. He has a hard time getting us to<br/>
understand him. I&#39;m so thankful for his tantrum,<br/>
because that&#39;s when he finally let out that he just<br/>
wants to move and that he hates this house. <br/>
I feel like a really stupid mom, for not seeing it.<br/>
Back to playing legos, take care everyone. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611632269">Our biggest behavior problem at hime right now is the boys interaction with our kittens.  My boys are 5 and almost 4.  We have two kittens.  The younger one has been with us since she was 3 days old and is now 6 weeks.  The older one is about 12 weeks.  The boys will lift the kittens by their necks or hold on around their necks to keep the kittens from getting away.  They also will sometimes use their legs in the same way.  It happens wherever I am.  Sitting right next to them or in the other room.  I try to tell them the kittens don&#39;t like it, but they insist they do.  I don&#39;t think they are purposefully abusing them, but they are very rough.  (They are rough with each other as well.)  I have many times talked to them about easy it is to injure the cats, but the behavior continues.  The boys have numerous scratches on their arms and faces, but it does not bother them at all.  I would love any advice as it is a constant struggle when we are home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248777956">I remember my sister and her friend did this and worse when they were  <br/>
that age. They wanted to teach them &quot;flying&quot; by throwing them from  <br/>
the loft bed, and teach them &quot;going down the stairs&quot;, by pushing them  <br/>
down the stairs and so on. After a few weeks the kittens were so  <br/>
wounded, we (my parents that is, I was young at the time) had to kill  <br/>
them to relieve their pain. Most of their bones were broken and as my  <br/>
parents worked and were not much around, no one would really stop the  <br/>
kids from doing that :-( My sister now (24) rellay regrets this and  <br/>
doesn&#39;t really want to hear about it. She LOVES cats and she did this  <br/>
without knowing it would hurt them, now matter what we&#39;d tell them.  <br/>
She truely wanted to just play and hlep them.<br/>
<br/>
What your kids are doing doesn&#39;t sound as harmful, but if it really  <br/>
becomes harmful, I&#39;d give the kittens away for their sake. Not as  <br/>
punishment but maybe your kids are just too young to handle that! In  <br/>
another (tcc) list I read that someone had a similar problem, they  <br/>
put the kittens in a cage, which was a solution, but for me it  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be. Cats are already in a &quot;cage&quot; at home with us, especially  <br/>
if they have no garde (which many cats don&#39;t have), so putting them  <br/>
again in a smaller cage just doesn&#39;t feel right. They&#39;d build a big  <br/>
cage though, I think..<br/>

<br/>
You need to say &quot;No. Everyone in the family deserves to feel safe. I  <br/>
won&#39;t let someone hurt you. I won&#39;t let someone hurt your brother. I  <br/>
won&#39;t let someone hurt your dad. I won&#39;t let someone hurt the kittens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need to be a rule. It&#39;s just a no.<br/>
<br/>
Rules have anger and enforcement and punishment and implications that  <br/>
someone breaking them is mean and bad.<br/>
<br/>
Nos are just nos.<br/>
<br/>
Be understanding that kittens are fun to play with but you can&#39;t  <br/>
allow them to be hurt.<br/>
<br/>
If you slugged someone who was assaulting you and then someone  <br/>
accused you of being violent and being in the wrong, how would you  <br/>
feel? Would you be angry at the person assuming bad things about you?<br/>
<br/>
Your kids aren&#39;t trying to be mean. They don&#39;t understand, possibly  <br/>
*can&#39;t* understand. My daughter was the same. She wanted animals to  <br/>
be like living toys that would do what she wanted and participate in  <br/>
her play. Fortunately we didn&#39;t have kittens but full grown cats who  <br/>
could run and hide where she couldn&#39;t get them. And it lasted longer  <br/>
than I would have expected but she eventually grew out of it and is  <br/>
now kind and gentle. She is old enough to understand empathically.  <br/>
But at 4 and 5 I wouldn&#39;t have trusted her to understand that her  <br/>
play would hurt kittens.<br/>
<br/>
You need to be the kittens&#39; protector. (As well as the protector of  <br/>
the rest of the family!) Role model that we don&#39;t let family members  <br/>
be hurt. Put the kittens in a room where the boys can&#39;t get to them.<br/>

<br/>
It was my family that built a cage for the kittens when my girls were small.<br/>
The kittens were just babies and they just needed a break from the kids<br/>
playing with them. (even though they weren&#39;t very rough)  They didn&#39;t live<br/>
in the cage all the time, but went there for breaks when the kids just<br/>
couldn&#39;t seem to leave them alone.  It was big enough for beds and a litter<br/>
box and food and two kittens.  It was nice that the girls could sit there<br/>
and look at them but at the same time they were safe. <br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t take long before the newness of having kittens wore off and the<br/>
girls stopped lugging them around every where they went. Then we didn&#39;t need<br/>
the cage but it was a life saver for a while. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116215571">Most of what you described your little ones doing, is<br/>
normal. This is our 3rd round of kittens. Which is<br/>
kinda why the things my son was doing, I found a<br/>
little scary. He would go up and kick them. <br/>
Anyways, I&#39;ve done what has been said. When the<br/>
kittens cry, I pretty much put them in a kennel or<br/>
another room. That seems to work the best. Talking<br/>
only helps so much. Your boys aren&#39;t kicking, which is<br/>
great. Quick thought- maybe a stuffed kitten that they<br/>
can dance or play with? That worked with Parker. When<br/>
he goes to give one of the kittens dance lessons, I<br/>
find his toy. That seems to help. <br/>
Kittens can enjoy kennels just like dogs. We had a cat<br/>
that loved his. Even when the door was open, he&#39;d go<br/>
in there. He kept his &#39;kills&#39; in there. Another one,<br/>
would bring her &#39;loveies&#39; in there so no one else<br/>
could play with them. Our dogs, prefer their kennels<br/>
to just being out. I think because they get stepped on<br/>
or fallen over, so it&#39;s just safer to lay in their<br/>
kennels when not outside. I feel even pets have a<br/>
right to a safe place all their own. <br/>
I hope this helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270413877">I can&#39;t wrap my head around any of this.  We have always had kittens, puppies, foals, kids (baby goats) and such.  No form of meanness was every allowed, but then our kids just never were abusive.  We taught them from the beginning how to treat the babies and they just did.  If I ever found one of our pets being abused, I would have found the pet a new and better home AND corrected my child.  At one point, we had over 150 &#39;pets&#39; (counting all the chickens and turkeys, all hand held and friendly).  Granted we live on a farm but abuse is abuse.  Hitting, kicking and biting is just not nice behavior at any age.<br/>

 I&#39;m not sure if this is in response to my post or not.  The boys don&#39;t do any of this.  They are just rough.  (Patting on the head, grabbing legs, holding tight, straightening ears)  They are getting better all the time about grabbing the animals necks.  I was hoping someone had a great suggestions, but it is clear there is no easy answer.  I continually talk to the boys about proper behavior and we are starting to lock the animals in our room when it gets to rough in the rest of the house.  I think we will also build the kittens a higher climbing post to get away from the kids easier.  I think it is just an issue where some kids are gentler than others.  I am trying to help the kids find ways to love on the animals properly.  They really do love them!<br/>
   Thanks for some good suggestions,<br/>
