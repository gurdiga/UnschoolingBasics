<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082310150">I think it was on this list that Ren posted something about how kids <br/>
would hate to play baseball if it were taught like we teach <br/>
history.  Instead of just experiencing baseball they are first <br/>
taught the history of baseball and then the positions and the key <br/>
players in history then all the rules, etc. And *then* tested on how <br/>
much they know about baseball instead of just experiencing the <br/>
game.  (Sound familiar?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was chatting with one of Emily&#39;s friends who is in middle <br/>
school and asked how school was going.  &quot;Fine.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you doing anything exciting?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, we are studying softball in PE.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh really?  What position are you playing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh we don&#39;t play softball.  We are just studying it right now.  YOu <br/>
know the rules and how it all got started.  That kind of stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you actually going to get to *play* softball?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe.  We have a test next week and then I guess we will play it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was just floored.  It seemed so odd that Ren prophesied what is <br/>
going on in our school systems.  The one class each day that kids <br/>
can &quot;play&quot; and they can&#39;t even play anymore.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751109175">That&#39;s not really all that &#39;new&#39;. I graduated high school in 1979 and <br/>
we had actual final exams in phys ed. Things like rules of soccer and <br/>
names of the positions (there&#39;d be a small scale picture of a soccer <br/>
field and we&#39;d have to label certain designated areas for example). <br/>
Generally, though, that part of it was over and done with after the <br/>
first class (depending on the particular activity) and we got on with <br/>
mostly just playing. Some things, like gymnastics, had more <br/>
instruction and information along the way as we got to more and <br/>
different types of appartus. But, in younger years (1-6 grades), gym <br/>
was mostly for running and playing. Of course, back in my grammar <br/>
school days, we&#39;d wear &#39;hot pants&#39; (boy am I dating myself there lol!) <br/>
under our skirts so we could change for gym easily and then change <br/>
back - jeans weren&#39;t allowed at all and I was in 5th grade by the <br/>
time &#39;pant suits&#39; were even allowed.</div>
