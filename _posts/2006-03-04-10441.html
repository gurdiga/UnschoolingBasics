<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361178716">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We often get asked schoolish things when out and about, like are you out of school today. My favor answer is, &quot;we homeschool,  and we are learning from you today&quot;. It starts up lively conversations, at the dentist, the store, the tire repair place, whereever. People get into the joy of learning right along side us.<br/>
