<div id="ygrps-yiv-191819704">Hi Ren and Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
These traits you are referring to are actually the representational system<br/>
that the person processes and records data through.<br/>
<br/>
There is Visual, Auditory, Olfactory, Gustatory and Kinesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
I believe these kids who are labeled ADD and ADHD actually are kinesthetic<br/>
learners. They process and record things thought feelings. They need to be<br/>
moving to learn, they seem distracted and to not be listening, because they<br/>
might not be looking you in the eye (which most teachers demand as a sign of<br/>
respect). They learn in a different way, not worse or better just different.<br/>
The current school system doesn&#39;t allow for kids who learn differently, it<br/>
just isn&#39;t practical for a class of 35 to have 10 of these kids bouncing on<br/>
rebounders while they listen and participate in the class. However, I<br/>
believe that if they could they would be learning as quickly as other kids,<br/>
because their personal learning needs were being met. Being forced to sit<br/>
still in a chair and not talk and look in one place for any length of time,<br/>
is similar to torture and in my experience results in the total<br/>
disconnection of the learning process for these kids.<br/>
<br/>
The words the teacher uses can also affect their ability to learn. SO if the<br/>
teacher was a visual learner, she would be using words like see, visualize,<br/>
imagine, focus, clear, bright, colourful and shiny etc. While a kinesthetic<br/>
learner wouldn&#39;t be able to process those words, they would be looking for<br/>
words like feel, touch, grasp, caress and rub to help them internalize and<br/>
process their learning.<br/>
<br/>
Well that was a fun way to remember my NLP training and to remind me why<br/>
Hannah and I have some of our conflicts we do... I am predominately visual<br/>
and she is predominately kinesthetic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You phrased it better than I did.  LOL!  I look back at my brother&#39;s life growing up.  Had we been born in a different era he would have been classified as ADHD.   He had all the character traits for ADHD.  What my mom figured out was that A)  my brother reacted certain ways to certain foods (primarily caffeine, sugar and corn) and B) my brother did better in classes where he could move or do something rather than sit and listen.  He did well in sports not because he enjoyed sports but because he enjoyed moving.  Had we been products of the 90&#39;s rather than the 60&#39;s he would have been doped up on ritalin.  Fortunately, that wasn&#39;t an option when we were kids.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  It&#39;s like Keon and his autism.  He has enough &quot;markers&quot; to be technically classified as autistic.  I&#39;ve never told him that he is autistic and rarely think about it myself (except on those really trying days when I remind myself that he is acting this way because of the socio-tactile-physical displacers that are causing him to act out - and then I act appropriately to try to work with these needs of his.)  I&#39;ve never looked at his autistic tendencies as disabling.  If anything they allow him to do and feel things that he might otherwise not notice or be concerned.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with you to a point.  There is evidence though that for &quot;some odd reason&quot; the children of today have a higher incidence of &quot;hyperactivity&quot; (the key word from my youth) than kids of the my generation.  Since the 1960&#39;s we have increased the amount of additives, preservatives, colors and artificial sweeteners that are children are exposed to.  We have higher incidences of allergies to wheat, corn, eggs, and milk than we did 50 years ago.  I really believe that the many of our children who are labeled ADHD and our adults who are labeled &quot;AADHD&quot; actually are suffering from some form of environmental exposure.  <br/>
<br/>
I read a study 2 years back about a school district that allowed a natural foods company to provide the meals for their school cafeteria (it was done at just one of there schools as a test).  The children were fed both breakfast and lunch of all natural foods with no additives, preservatives, chemicals, colors, etc.  Lots of whole grains, lean meats, fesh fruits and veggies.  Within a few months test scores were up, children who previously had been labeled ADD/ADHD were fewer than before.  Attention spans increased and the class problems lessened.  By the end of the year it was a completey different school and many children had crossed over their diets to their home lives as well.  Parents commented about how much better their children were doing in school and that their kids were in less trouble with authorities.  The parents were thrilled and were willing to pay the extra cost to continue the food program the next year.  The school district refused and &quot;oddly enough&quot; the school reverted back to the way it was.  :-(  <br/>
<br/>
I do believe that there are children who learn from kinesthitic opportunies.  In fact I think that many children learn well this way.  It doesn&#39;t make them ADD/ADHD.  <br/>

No, no....I figured we agreed. I just like to clarify when there is <br/>
an opportunity.<br/>
My brother has been in and out of prison his entire adult life...I <br/>
could write scads about ADD and Ritalin.:) I&#39;ve often wondered how <br/>
he&#39;d be doing now if he hadn&#39;t been taught that he had <br/>
a &quot;disability&quot; and given drugs from a young age. He&#39;s an addict, but <br/>
other issues like FAS obviously play a part. My family adopted him <br/>

<br/>
&quot;I read a study 2 years back about a school district that allowed a <br/>
natural foods company to provide the meals for their school <br/>
cafeteria (it was done at just one of there schools as a test).  The <br/>
children were fed both breakfast and lunch of all natural foods with <br/>

year.  The school district refused and &quot;oddly enough&quot; the school <br/>
reverted back to the way it was.  :-(  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have also read the results of some studies that suggest diet may <br/>
be the number 1 factor in some of these kids. Specifically, I have <br/>
read about the ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 fatty acids (&quot;good fats&quot; <br/>
vs. &quot;bad&quot; fats) Those fats found in salmon, flax seed, nuts, <br/>
avocado, etc appear to help the body while the types of fats found <br/>
in most animal meat, processed oils, etc. tend to be damaging when <br/>
consumed in proportions that are very high. In other countries, <br/>
where the ratio is about 1:2 there is far less incidence of the the <br/>
behaviors we call ADD/ADHD. Here in the U.S., they think the ratio <br/>
is more like 1:6 in the average child.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this, however, I do think that schools are highly unrealistic <br/>
to expect a kid to sit still for almost 6 hours a day and pay <br/>
attention. Heck, I can barely do that! And why would I want to???<br/>
For that matter, why would I ever want my child to sit still that <br/>
long either?<br/>
<br/>
And we wonder why our nation is getting fatter and more unhealthy!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t have the studies cited (this is just stuff I read <br/>
about, presumably in &quot;Scientific American&quot; as that is my major <br/>
source of science news.<br/>

I read about ADD last year and it explained so much about how my <br/>

your strengths are over here and you may need/want to compensate for <br/>
some of these weaknesses.&quot; Much different than &quot;you need to apply <br/>
yourself more and try harder&quot; at things like school work.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d understood myself better in college, I could have broken up <br/>
studying with frequent breaks, avoided 1.5 hr classes, etc. <br/>

So I&#39;m all for &quot;diagnoses&quot; that help us understand ourselves, but it <br/>

I wanted to add to this thread about ADD. When my 7 yr old son was on Kindergarten, they tried to tell me he was ADHD and needed to be on Ritalin. I was more naive then about the workings of the public school system when it came to ADD/ADHD and ended up complying with their &quot;demands&quot;. I had him on Ritalin for 3 weeks and it was awful. He was such a happy, loving child up until that point. After the first week, he cried all the time for no apparent reason. He also lost his appetite during that period. It made my husband and I sick and we took him off the medication. We researched his diet, changed the way we ate.. dyes, preservatives, sugar and so on. It made a wonderful difference. We also pulled him from school and started to work with him at home. I do notice plenty of differences as to how his brain works when compared to my daughters. His birth was extremely difficult and he was clinically dead for 6 minutes. We know that there were residual affect of this. However, he seems like a happy.. articulate, smart and curious little boy. <br/>
<br/>
As for the fact that everyone&#39;s brain works differently, I witnessed something really amazing with my son yesterday. He has tried to play checkers with his sister on countless occasions, but each time can not grasp the simple context of the game. To most people it is as easy as tying your shoes.. the concept any how. Well, he started to play chess just yesterday. We went over the rules of the game and how to play it. We talked about the goal of checkmate. He instantly went to playing with his 11 ye old sister (who beats mom and dad almost regularly) and as I watched I realized that he grasped every single aspect of the game. He lost the first few matches, but not with out a fight, and then beat her in the last 3 games. I, myself still have a hard time with chess and was fascinated to see him process this game with out any trouble. He still can&#39;t play checkers and has trouble tying his shoes.. but was a champion at chess. It was certainly proof to me that the brain works in mysterious ways.<br/>

champion at  chess. It was certainly proof to me that the brain works in <br/>
mysterious  ways.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And not always in a &quot;logical&quot; sequence! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

THEN became interested in checkers and a variant called fox and <br/>
hounds (I think that&#39;s the name) where on red checker and 4 black <br/>
checkers face off and the red one tries to reach the other side of <br/>
the board, no jumping pieces allowed. We were at Cracker Barrel one <br/>
day, browsing the store part where they have that giant <br/>
checkerboard. DS was looking at it (we have one at home) and an <br/>
older gentleman invited DS to play a game. I smiled and nodded when <br/>
DS checked to see if it was okay so the game got underway. Partway <br/>
through, it was obvious that the gent had to change tactics and stop <br/>
playing as if DS is a kid (even though he was 5 at the time). The <br/>
man&#39;s wife roamed by and said &quot;Don&#39;t let him cheat&quot; I said &quot;I think <br/>
he&#39;s losing so I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s not cheating&quot; That caught her <br/>
attention and she watched for a bit. He kept giving DS obvious open <br/>
jumps that would then set DS up to be double and triple jumped. DS <br/>
didn&#39;t fall for it and ended up ahead. The older gent resigned the <br/>
board and told DS he had played a very good game. Boy, DS was on <br/>
cloud 9 at that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and now DH is coordinator for a chess club at our homeschool&#39;s <br/>
co-op day. One mom held back until she found out that DH was in <br/>
charge of things then signed her DD up. And, I&#39;ve heard from several <br/>
moms that their kids love it and can&#39;t wait to go back each week. <br/>
Mostly, I think, because DH doesn&#39;t lecture and quiz and all but <br/>
let&#39;s them play and points out strategies to them that they can use. <br/>
Wait until they find out that the last day of the session he&#39;s going <br/>
to take them all on - all 16 of them, 16 simulatenous games - he&#39;s <br/>
figuring he&#39;ll probably losing at least half.</div>

they do playing one on one.<br/>
