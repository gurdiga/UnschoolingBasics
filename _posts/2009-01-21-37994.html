<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841202913">Luke (10) and I joined an RP (role playing) PVP (player vs. player,  <br/>
fighting other people&#39;s characters, as opposed to computer controlled  <br/>
characters) guild in World of Warcraft.  Luke saw this guild doing  <br/>
some interesting things in the game, one of which was being very  <br/>
generous and handing out bags freely in Brill.  I researched a bit of  <br/>
information on them, and found out how he could join them, and I  <br/>
followed shortly thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we had in-game RP training, to learn more how to role play.   <br/>
And we got homework!  :::laughing::::  I have more homework than  <br/>
Luke, because he knows more of the WoW storyline.  I&#39;m supposed to  <br/>
look up some cinematics and stories of the game to learn about the  <br/>
history in WoW, so I can create a believable character and play along  <br/>
with some of the set story line.<br/>
<br/>
A side note... the woman leading the training, which was all done in  <br/>
the chat box, said to excuse her misspellings, that her mod (extra  <br/>
download modification) was not working.  So here&#39;s this incredible  <br/>
role player (she&#39;s been doing it for 9 years), who is not a good  <br/>
speller, but has found a way around it, to share her wealth of  <br/>
information.  And, geez she was fast at typing.<br/>
<br/>
We also have some question to answer to create a background to our  <br/>
characters, like &quot;Who am I?&quot;, &quot;Where am I from?&quot;, &quot;What have I done  <br/>
in my life?&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We are having so much fun in this guild, and I&#39;m enjoying playing and  <br/>
sharing this with Luke.<br/>

Very cool Jill.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughters both role play.  Abbi(14) used to a lot but not as much anymore.  Kyra(11) does a lot now and she&#39;s also in a role playing guild.  Her&#39;s isn&#39;t PVP which I can imagine that would really bring a whole new perspective to the game!  You could get really creative with story lines!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Abbi read and researched the history (or they call it lore) a lot.  She had a lot of fun doing it and just recently wanted to delve into it deeper, since the expansion.  She had read the manga/comic book style books of the lore before but now she has the novels. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in the books you can find them at Blizzard&#39;s website:<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
All the kids have had a lot of fun discussing how the characters got to the point that they are now in the game.  And the girls have had a blast creating storylines about their own characters.<br/>
