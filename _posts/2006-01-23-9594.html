<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837815606">&quot;Just make sure to check your home schooling laws before you do that<br/>
to make sure you are in compliance. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but if it comes to some damn law or my children&#39;s health<br/>
and peace, I choose my children!!<br/>
I don&#39;t believe there is a single state in the entire country where<br/>
the law states WHEN the &quot;education&quot; has to take place. Maybe someone<br/>
from NHEN can chime in here...Pam?<br/>
There are some pretty strict states, but even those don&#39;t say when the<br/>
child has to recieve the education.<br/>
<br/>
Having a caring Grandparent keep the children happy while you work is<br/>
a great option...it sounds like she&#39;d let him have fun at her house<br/>
and not try to school him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to always work our two schedules out so<br/>
that one of us is home with the children. I&#39;ve worked off and on our<br/>
entire marriage and been part-time since Jalen was just 8months old.<br/>
It&#39;s worked very well for us, mainly because I worked hours dh was<br/>
with them. We didn&#39;t have grandparents in the area though...I think<br/>
that&#39;s a wonderful soluation if everyone is happy with the arrangement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787471937">Woo! I am all for doing whatever it takes to make your children happy. I<br/>
only mentioned checking laws because I know in Maryland that it states the<br/>
parents must do the teaching. They do accept outside classes as well as<br/>
coordinating with other parents however if you are under the school board<br/>
then you need to follow their rules or pay the consequences. There are lots<br/>
of ways to bend rules or getting under an umbrella group that is approved by<br/>
your state.<br/>
<br/>
I would hate to remove my child from PS and then find out that because I<br/>
didn&#39;t check things out - the state makes me return him to PS on a<br/>
technicality. <br/>

I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not that simple. Even in states that are less than lenient, they<br/>
can&#39;t just swoop in and force your child into public school easily.<br/>
And even in MD, it would be perfectly fine to have the child with a<br/>
caregiver all day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly - if you provide the proper notice and keep a portfolio <br/>
available for review as provided for by law in MD (max 3 reviews per <br/>
year - they have to request it, you don&#39;t volunteer anything), then <br/>
they have no say over -how- you do anything because they have no way <br/>
of *knowing* how you do anything. They have no way of knowing where <br/>
your kids spend the day (with you, with a caregiver, whatever) <br/>
*unless* that information is provided to them by someone else (since <br/>
you&#39;re not going to do it). And even then, so long as it is proper <br/>
supervision (your child staying with grandma all day for example), <br/>
then there&#39;s not much they can do about it.<br/>
