<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348932176">Howdy!<br/>
I&#39;m now a SAHM with a 5 yr old and an almost 3 yr old - both boys.  <br/>
It&#39;s been an adjustment for me over the past year from working 60+ <br/>
hours to working part-time from home, and it&#39;s given me time to <br/>
realize that I REALLY like my kids and am not too thrilled with what <br/>
they&#39;ve been learning in pre-school.  It&#39;s not the curriculum, it&#39;s <br/>
the words like &quot;nasty&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; they are picking up from peers.  <br/>
It&#39;s that my son (5 yr old) when I ask what he did today, instead <br/>
gives me a &quot;police report&quot; on who got their clip pulled and who did <br/>
what to whom.  That isn&#39;t fun, and it certainly isn&#39;t what I want <br/>
him concentrating on!  So I&#39;ve decided to withdraw them both (don&#39;t <br/>
really need full time care anymore anyway!) and try home schooling, <br/>
with emphasis on unschooling.  My 5 yr old reads well, so I figure <br/>
we&#39;ll start with some library excursions and see where it leads us.  <br/>
This is all new to me and I have a doubting husband in the wings.  I <br/>
don&#39;t picture myself as a &quot;school at home&quot; type person, so <br/>
unschooling is very appealling to my spirit.  We&#39;ll see if it works <br/>
for my boys!  <br/>
<br/>
I have read through a few of the posts and am wowed by how open and <br/>
helpful everyone is.  I hope that I can offer some tokens along the <br/>
way in recompense!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663169240">Hi Pamela!  Welcome!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m from Memphis, although I haven&#39;t lived there in years.  I am  planning on <br/>
a trip this spring to see the family.<br/>
 <br/>
I know what you mean about the police reports!  LOL!!  And  unschooling goes <br/>
even beyond that, your children aren&#39;t judged and watching  other people being <br/>
judged all day for what they know and don&#39;t know!  When  I come across this <br/>
stuff now, my mind screams &quot;surely this is some sort of child  abuse...why <br/>
isn&#39;t anyone noticing how crushed these kids are?!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
We went to the zoo recently and we saw a lady talk about the  penguins.  She <br/>
said &quot;who knows where penguins are from?&quot; and my 5 year old  piped up &quot;the <br/>
North Pole!!&quot;.  The lady said &quot;no, you probably saw that on  TV.  They are only <br/>
from the South Pole.&quot;  I saw my daughter look at  the lady for a second then <br/>
walk away and stop paying attention.  She  started zooming around the room and <br/>
got her friends to join her, kinda  disrupting the lady.  I thought, no wonder <br/>
they have so many behavioral  problems in school, these kids are trying to <br/>
protect themselves from being hurt  and set up and told they are wrong all day.  <br/>
 <br/>
Guess I needed to get that off my chest, LOL!<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun getting used to your new life, Pamela!<br/>

So funny, my 7yo recently told me that the commercial at the movie theater for coke was all wrong because they showed a polar bear with penguins and polar bears live in the north pole and penguins live in the south pole...this she told me she did learn from TV.<br/>
