<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747145433">Hey again...<br/>
<br/>
...and then we have another problem. Of course, she&#39;s been playing  <br/>
computer ALL day long. That&#39;s no problem and she needs to catch up. I  <br/>
really don&#39;t mind. BUT I read in unschooling sites that we shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
restrict the *kind* of games either (for instance violent games). Nor  <br/>
the kind of TV programs even if they are for adults (?) We really  <br/>
don&#39;t know how to handle this because... for instance, we don&#39;t have  <br/>
any violent games and she wouldn&#39;t want them now either, but we have  <br/>
The Sims for instance, a game which I enjoy very much as well. But  <br/>
there is a thief with a mini-bag who comes and puts extremely big  <br/>
things in his very small bag. She played that all day long and really  <br/>
enjoyed it, but now she is afraid that this thief with a small bag  <br/>
would come. She was even afraid to talk about it loud, because she  <br/>
thought he could hear us form outside. Now The Sims is rather  <br/>
harmless! In the game, you can have a an alarm and then the police  <br/>
automatically comes. Now she said, we didn&#39;t even have an alarm. I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to buy an alarm now, this was really somethign we never  <br/>
wanted because we hate security freaks who close everything 5 times  <br/>
and everythign, i don&#39;t want to imprison myself, and plus, it&#39;s  <br/>
expensive. We do have a little &quot;chain&quot; to double lock the door which  <br/>
we never use. But yesterday we used it, extra for her. Now I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking, THe Sims is SO harmless, she cannot even handle that, how  <br/>
will she handle other more scary games. And with TV, my boyfriend  <br/>
asked if she could watch everything for adults as well. I said that I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t sure and so on, I guessed yes. We are absolutely SURE that as  <br/>
soon as her computer catching-up need is over, she will switch to TV  <br/>
and she WILL stop at (soft)-pornographic programs (which are on  <br/>
normal TV very late at night) and/or scary movies! Then SHE said, she  <br/>
&quot;liked&quot; scary movies. Well... maybe she does but she is already  <br/>
scared of a stupid unrealistic comic style thief with mini bags! I  <br/>
didn&#39;t even know how I could help her with her fear because just  <br/>
saying &quot;there is no thief&quot; is not helpful at all, and also, the  <br/>
possibility that a real thief comes is not high, but there is a  <br/>
chance, so it&#39;s a lie anyway. The chain didn&#39;t help (and what if he  <br/>
has something to destroy it?), and that we could call the police  <br/>
neither (and what if we don&#39;t hear him?) and that we didn&#39;t have  <br/>
anyting worth stealing neither (and what if he steals me?) and so  <br/>
on... How could I explain there are no aliens and all the other  <br/>
unrealistic scary things there might be??<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

It sounds as if you are reading about Unschooling as if there are some rules<br/>
to follow and if you just follow them correctly, you&#39;ll get the results you<br/>
want and that some of us already have.  The problem is, you have to listen<br/>
to your child.  Your child is telling you (not in words maybe) that the Sims<br/>
game bothers her.  Can you help her to understand (through regular talking<br/>
during other times) that the Sims thief isn&#39;t real and that even though<br/>
there are some thieves in real life it&#39;s unlikely that they&#39;ll ever come to<br/>
your house.  My kids always worked through things that bothered them by play<br/>
acting.  Maybe you could take turns playing the thief if you think it&#39;ll<br/>
work for her.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 It sounds like she is sort of rebelling against rules you have had and<br/>
wanting to do things that were once off limits but not with really making<br/>
conscious choices about what she wants to do.  If you know scary movies will<br/>
bother her, tell her that but not in a way that makes her think you are the<br/>
know it all and she doesn&#39;t know enough, but in a way that you would a<br/>
friend who doesn&#39;t like scary movies.  My kids, who have been free to watch<br/>
as much TV and whatever, since they were maybe 4 and 6 years old (I began by<br/>
just saying yes more when they asked to watch and it was Arthur and animal<br/>
planet that they liked) have never decided to watch scary movies just<br/>
because they could. They have no interest in any movies that are overtly<br/>
sexual and they say yuck and close their eyes when people kiss.  (They are<br/>
almost 10 and 11.75)  Despite their freedoms they aren&#39;t drawn to porn, soft<br/>
or not.  (actually they don&#39;t know it exists)  They aren&#39;t drawn to scary<br/>
movies and they know that I don&#39;t warm them off a show for any other reason<br/>
than having their best interests at heart.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if you just told your dd that she has no rules now that you<br/>
are unschoolers or what but it can be VERY overwhelming for a child with a<br/>
lot of rules to all of a sudden have no rules.  It works much better if you<br/>
just start saying yes more often to things you might have said no to before<br/>
without having thought about it.  &quot;Can I stay up to finish watching this<br/>
show?&quot;  YES  &quot;Will you stay with me while I go to sleep?&quot;  Sure.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I asked a few days ago here if I should tell her &quot;officially&quot;  <br/>
that we were unschooling now and that there would be no rules. People  <br/>
told me to just say yes more and to  not use arbitrary &quot;nos&quot;, and  <br/>
suggested that only if she asks we should tell her. So I did, and  <br/>
that was actually also in my mind. But a day after my question in the  <br/>
list, she actually asked me, wondering &quot;where do you have that all  <br/>
from?? why am I allowed to do xx and yy?&quot; So I told her that we have  <br/>
been informing ourselves about new ways of raising our children and  <br/>
that we wanted our children to grow up in freedom. We talked a bit  <br/>
about it and although I never said anything about lifting rules, she  <br/>
kind of derived from our conversation that it would be so. She&#39;s very  <br/>
clever :-) Before yesterday for example, she happily helped us  <br/>
cleaning the kitchen, drying the dishes. My boyfriend had to suddenly  <br/>
tak care of ds (1) who needed to be fed and whatever. And so she  <br/>
said, hey, where is Maurice?? He should be helping us! or something  <br/>
like that. Then I said, well, he has to take care of ds. And then she  <br/>
said &quot;nobody HAS to do ANYTHING!!!... (actually my bf and I  <br/>
afterwards commented that she&#39;s been saying that a few times and she  <br/>
always SHOUTS it out loud, as to tell the WHOLE world, that she is  <br/>
FREE now :-) Which we kind of like).. then I was like err err..  <br/>
hum... well yeah.. and I remembered Joyce Fetterols Website where  <br/>
somewhere it is written that we should be aware of the fact that  <br/>
actually, we don&#39;t HAVE to clean up, etc, we CHOOSE to, because we  <br/>
don&#39;t want the (natural) consequences to happen. So I told her, well  <br/>
yeah, he doesn&#39;t HAVE to but he doesn&#39;t want to hear ds whining and  <br/>
so on. But from then on I understood that she kind of &quot;got&quot; it  <br/>
already without us saying anything. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said  <br/>
anything about &quot;freedom&quot;, but I was really unprepared brecause I  <br/>
didn&#39;t expect such a question so quickly. Probably she wondered  <br/>
instantly because before we had a million rules. *Sigh* what can we  <br/>
do now?<br/>
<br/>
Now that she has no bedtimes, I have the feeling she won&#39;t ever want  <br/>
to go to bed before us, at least knowing that we will be awake doing  <br/>
something fun. Buhuhu, I want my own freedom back ;-) But I can never  <br/>
go back to coercive methods again because now they seem very cruel to  <br/>
me. And I believe it is the best for my child and how can I just do  <br/>
something which is not the best, only because I&#39;m too lazy?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you have suggestions how to clean up what I messed up already...<br/>

 ****Why would you do something she would view as fun after she goes to bed?  We plan family activities and include the boys.  A movie or a game we would all like.  What would she view as fun?  The idea of watching boring adult tv will cease to be fun when she is allowed to watch things that interest her.  I would try to offer her the same activites during the day or whenever you have more energy.  Put on a bathing suit (or not) and get in the tub with her if she wants.  Whatever activities she feels like she is missing do with her during the day.  When you want to do things with your SO at night, settle her in another room.  Listening to music, playing computer, or watching tv.  At some point you may have to tell her that you have had enough for today.  My boys are 5 and 3, and they know that I sometimes need a break.  Sometimes I can just ask them to play for a few minutes alone, but it often goes much better when I help them.  Like now when they are watching tv and I am<br/>
 on the computer.  I admit sometimes it goes better than others, and you will have to use different strategies with a 1 yo, but think creatively and solutions will come.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810177682">Do you lay with your dd when she goes to sleep or does she go to her own<br/>
room?  If you sleep with her and if you know she is tired and you go to bed<br/>
with her, you could get back up after.  If she doesn&#39;t think she is missing<br/>
anything then maybe it won&#39;t matter.  You don&#39;t have to tell her your<br/>
getting back up.  But also, maybe once she finds out that she isn&#39;t missing<br/>
anything that is interesting to her she&#39;ll be ok to go to bed while your<br/>
still up.  (my kids don&#39;t want to do that though but I need MORE sleep than<br/>
they do so I always go to bed when they do anyway.)  could she fall asleep<br/>
on the couch while you are watching TV?<br/>
