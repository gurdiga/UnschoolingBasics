<br/>
Yup, she&#39;s 7(!), and like her mother, her life is<br/>
overscheduled.  I think that my sister has fallen into<br/>
the trap of, &quot;If I don&#39;t have my children signed up<br/>
for a million activities, I am not a good mother.&quot;  My<br/>
sister and I were raised by our own parents to be<br/>
&quot;human doings,&quot; not &quot;human beings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I will need to unschool myself from this for the<br/>
sake of my own DS.<br/>
<br/>
More challenges for me:<br/>
<br/>
My nephew is 3.  He has been spending a lot of time<br/>
with me and my son (as has my niece).  My<br/>
overscheduled sister loves it when I am here because<br/>
it gives her some relief from her hectic life.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew has a lot of behaviors that are difficult<br/>
for me to deal with.  Most of them are what I think of<br/>
as the typical &quot;terrible two&quot;--or in this case,<br/>
&quot;terrible three&quot;--behaviors: whining when he doesn&#39;t<br/>
get what he wants, temper tantrums, throwing things,<br/>
etc.  He often does things that almost feel like he is<br/>
testing me: throwing all of my clean, folded laundry<br/>
onto a pile on the floor was the one that got my goat<br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, I am a new parent, so I am<br/>
learning about child behaviors.  Maybe this is<br/>
something that children do: they test the adults<br/>
around them to get a sense of what they can expect?<br/>
<br/>
In the case of my niece and nephew, their parents tend<br/>
to give them a lot of orders (do this, don&#39;t do that,<br/>
stop that, etc.) and a lot of time-outs.  My devilish<br/>
little nephew gets a lot of time-outs.<br/>
<br/>
So it doesn&#39;t surprise me that he tests me.  He has<br/>
come to know what to expect in reaction to his &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
behavior from his parents.  He already senses that my<br/>
reaction is going to be different.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t know how to deal with him.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
how to react when he throws all of my clean laundry on<br/>
the floor--or the many other &quot;naughty&quot; things that he<br/>
does all day long.  I love this little boy.  Yesterday<br/>
we had some other kids over that were close to his age<br/>
to play with some sprinklers and wading pools that I<br/>
had set up out back.  He was so filled with joy and<br/>
freedom as he played.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he is just bored from being cooped up with me<br/>
and my 7 mo. old.  It is too oppressively hot outside<br/>
to play out there much. And my sister has asked that I<br/>
not allow her kids to watch TV, play video games, or<br/>
use the computer, but hasn&#39;t given me much to keep<br/>
them entertained with.  And my baby gets very tired if<br/>
I drag him all over town.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, what goes on for me is that I look at my<br/>
sweet but devilish little nephew and I wonder if my<br/>
own son will be devilish like him.  And if he is, how<br/>
will that be for me as a parent?  I want to &quot;do&quot;<br/>
things differently so that my own son will be<br/>
&quot;better.&quot;  All the while knowing that I can&#39;t control<br/>
him.  Will I be up to the task?  Will my own son push<br/>
my buttons in the way my nephew does?  Will I be<br/>
constantly tempted to take the easy way out<br/>
(punishment, bribes, threats)?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the answers to these questions are &quot;yes.&quot; <br/>
And so begins my task of learning how to parent in a<br/>
non-violent and respectful way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for &quot;listening&quot; if you&#39;ve made it this far. <br/>
Would appreciate your feedback and comments.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88935280">Elena,<br/>
<br/>
Being a guy, I have some suggestions for the frustrating behavior.  Hope I<br/>
won&#39;t bore you with stuff you already are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:<br/>
1a. Do some re-winding and pre-planning.  Imagine how you would like to<br/>
respond to that situation.  Play that out in your mind several times.<br/>
1b. For the dumped laundry:  Stop.  Breathe.  Breathe again.  Do it again if<br/>
necessary.  Then act out how you planned in the previous step.<br/>
2. Begin modifying your own environment to accommodate his &quot;devilish&quot; side,<br/>
if he&#39;s going to be over a lot.<br/>
3. If his mother is not going to allow TV/computer games/etc., then ask her<br/>
to please provide some things for him to do.<br/>
4. If possible, figure out why he&#39;s doing those devilish things.<br/>
<br/>
My dd2 (4.25) is very challenging.  I wouldn&#39;t call her devilish, as to me<br/>
that sounds playful and mischievous.  But some of the behaviors are<br/>
simliar.  She will dump all the clothes onto the floor that were just hung<br/>
not 5 minutes previous.  She hits.  She gets into throwing things, and as<br/>
you&#39;re trying to fix/repair/keep it from falling, she&#39;s onto something else<br/>
to knock off a table or throw across the room.<br/>
<br/>
When she does this, more often than not she is in desperate need of a<br/>
connection from us.  She has lost her &quot;power&quot; and is striking out.  It has<br/>
taken great effort for us to stop, breathe, breathe again, and then attempt<br/>
to engage her as much as she&#39;s willing to let us.  Sometimes it&#39;s direct<br/>
contact (hugging, stroking, telling her we love her), sometimes it&#39;s just<br/>
mentioning that she looks really angry.  If she&#39;s taken something from her<br/>
sister, we do not take it back from her, and we have to reassure her that<br/>
we&#39;re NOT going to take it from her (we did enough of that already --<br/>
yuck!).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that we stopped &quot;treating&quot; her behavior and watched to see<br/>
what it was that she needed.  She&#39;s scared that we will stop loving her<br/>
and/or will abandon her (wish we&#39;d known when she was an infant what we know<br/>
now).  That is her issue.  And sad to say, she&#39;s afraid of that because we<br/>
DID for a while take back things from her that she took from others.  We<br/>
gave her time-outs (i.e. separation).  When we ran out of ideas, we yelled<br/>
at her and spanked her.  Guess what?  made it worse.  We figured out what we<br/>
were doing wrong and and what she needed.  And she has really blossomed.<br/>
<br/>
Have I babbled enough?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509559790">I&#39;m a long time unschooler and a very (most people call it) laid back <br/>
mother. I never ever had a child who was a &quot;terrible two&quot; or a child <br/>
who tested my limits... I was firm and unyielding when necessary <br/>
(&quot;can I go play in the street?&quot; or &quot;Can I pour this hot wax on the <br/>
carpet?&quot;) and rarely said &quot;no&quot; to them (maybe when they were sticking <br/>
something into the electrical outlet...)  But we have had very &quot;well <br/>
behaved&quot; (in the opinions of others) children! I never over scheduled <br/>
them, or me (we rarely scheduled anything LOL) and I have always done <br/>
the &quot;follow them around and see what they are learning&quot; type of <br/>
homeschooling. Our homes were always and still are, child friendly. <br/>
There is very little they can get into that I don&#39;t want them in. <br/>
(Hm, except that now the 10yo has been climbing on the counter and <br/>
playing with matches and candles and making wax sculptures... <br/>
sometimes that annoys me!)<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t think *every* child develops into a little devilish <br/>
dervish. Of course mine did things that many would consider <br/>
naughty.... I remember being on the phone helping a mom with a new <br/>
baby and my little son, about 2 I think, was gleefully running around <br/>
the living room spreading cereal, some flake, all over the room.... I <br/>
ignored him and when we got off the phone we vacuumed it up. Things <br/>
like that happen with kids! I (usually) have been able to take it all <br/>
in stride and realize they are not out to get me, they are just learning!<br/>
<br/>
Was the 3yo vying for your attention? Could he help fold the laundry? <br/>
My kids loved to &quot;help&quot; do anything I did...  was he mad about <br/>
something?  I very rarely gave (or give) my kids orders... I <br/>
sometimes make suggestions, ask for help or whatever, but their days <br/>
are really their own. With the younger ones of course, I was way more <br/>
actively engaged; as they get old, they want to do it without me <br/>
helping or hanging around. My guess is that the 3yo needs someone to <br/>
play with him - you! (since mom isn&#39;t willing or able.)  3yos do need <br/>
quite a bit of hm... where&#39;s a good word... not &quot;direction&quot; or <br/>
&quot;supervision&quot; ... but loving guidance. And patience LOL, tons of that.<br/>
<br/>
Things 3yos like:<br/>
-playdoh (homemade is easy if you don&#39;t have any)<br/>
-marbles and chutes (toilet paper tubes, cardboard)<br/>
-ping pong balls if marble are too small - my little ones loved ping <br/>
pong balls!<br/>
-water play - on towels on the floor - bubbles and spoons and bowls, seives...<br/>
-sand - we bring in snow in the winter, a sand table - or sand in a <br/>
baking dish - with cars and water and little people...<br/>
-card games - they make up the rules - very entertaining.....<br/>
-finger paint<br/>
-being read to<br/>
-writing a story book<br/>
-sliding down the stairs on sleeping bags<br/>
-big boxes to play in and decorate<br/>
-forts made out of blankets<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rather than seeing them as naughty, see them as a request for more <br/>
engagement. He&#39;s looking for things to do *and* some company. If you <br/>
can help him get what he needs, you won&#39;t be spending so much energy <br/>
reacting. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, this may well be how his mom got into the trap of <br/>
scheduling a zillion things for her kids in the first place - these <br/>
kids may well need a lot of things to do. They don&#39;t necessarily <br/>
need to be classes and outings all the time, but some kids do have <br/>
higher energy needs than others. <br/>
<br/>
When incidents like the laundry thing happens you have a chance to <br/>
look at his behavior as an opportunity to connect and engage with <br/>
him. What if you were to grab a tshirt out of the laundry (you can <br/>
fold it later) and start dancing around waving it in the air like a <br/>
flag or scarf? That&#39;d be fun. Let him have one, too. Put some music <br/>
on. I bet the baby would love it, too - you could even do a sort of <br/>
peek-a-boo game with it if you wanted. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there&#39;s no guarantee that your little one will be anything <br/>
like your nephew. That being said, you have a lovely opportunity to <br/>
do some thinking now and discovering some strategies. The first is: <br/>
don&#39;t expect to get anything done for a few years. Energetic kids <br/>
need parenting more than clean sheets ;) The next is: start looking <br/>
for ways to arrange your home with energetic play in mind. Look for <br/>
ways to open up floor space. Get rid of lamps and things that tip. <br/>
Think in terms of minimizing the need to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  Its also good to look for toys and indoor play options that use <br/>
lots of big muscle groups. You let the kids jump on the furniture, <br/>
right? Maybe think about an air-mattress or extra cushions so they <br/>
can jump from the furniture to the floor and back. Really big balls, <br/>
like exercise balls or the bouncy things with the handle on top, can <br/>
be great fun. A small slide. Skateboards to use as scooters. Sit-n-<br/>
spin. Any weird thing to put on feet and make walking exciting. With <br/>
the baby, you may not want to get a bunch of balloons, but that&#39;s a <br/>
blast with slightly older kids. See if you can get some of the foil <br/>
kind at a dollar store. Scarves, or just big, flimsy pieces of <br/>
fabric. Streamers. Badminton raquets and birdies. Tunnels. A tent. <br/>
If the space is big enough, a swing or trapeze. Look at your <br/>
basement and attic, too, if you have either of those, with an eye to <br/>
making more indoor play areas. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously you don&#39;t need all this right now! But its something to <br/>
keep in mind when you&#39;re out and about just in case you run across <br/>
something really neat or on sale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951955109"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our first day here, my niece invited us to her last day of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>camp to see her final project. Afterward, she wanted to come home with<br/>
me and the baby. Her mother (my sister) reminded her that she had swim<br/>
team practice which she had already missed earlier in the week. My<br/>
niece became very upset, crying and insisting that she wanted to spend<br/>
time with her baby cousin. At which point my sister dragged her<br/>
kicking and screaming away to her own car&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
What I would take from watching this exchange is that it that there<br/>
should always be opportunity to discuss options and consequences of<br/>
those choices before a decision could be made. Taking the opportunity<br/>
to validate the child wanting to see her cousin but gentle reminders<br/>
to make sure the child is seeing the whole picture. Children&#39;s<br/>
emotions are so in the moment that they can&#39;t always see the whole<br/>
picture. I think we have to always be prepared to discuss and change<br/>
gears if need be. As was stated in other posts this is not always<br/>
possible to find the win win in every situation but participating in<br/>
the process will give the tools and foster trust and respect.<br/>
<br/>
e.g  Mom, I want to go with aunt and baby. ...well sweetie, I know how<br/>
much you enjoy seeing your cousin and it is very exciting they are<br/>
visiting , before you make this decision you may want to remember you<br/>
have already missed your swim practice earlier this week and I know<br/>
how much seeing your friends and swimming means to you.  I want to<br/>
remind you that your Aunt and cousin are going to be here for x amount<br/>
of time. It is important to keep our commitment to the team but if you<br/>
feel that strongly about it, I am sure your team will understand that<br/>
you have family visiting.<br/>
<br/>
I think this would help the child make an informed decision rather<br/>
than a rash emotional one-<br/>
<br/>
Another option could have been to invite Aunt and baby to swim<br/>
practice as well.<br/>
<br/>
I just think this is a good example of trying to get win-win<br/>
situations and using the process that was talked about earlier in the<br/>
week. Obviously your sister does not parent that way and in a quiet<br/>
moment where you and your sister are connecting perhaps you could<br/>
share your budding philosophy with her. She could be completely<br/>
frustrated and wanting a different perspective as I up until recently<br/>
totally parented as she does. (at least with this example) I also find<br/>
that observing how parents interact are great learning tools of how I<br/>
would do the same or differently.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Later, I asked how swim team practice had gone. My niece said that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it had been great, that she had spent a lot of time afterward playing<br/>
in the pool, and that she hadn&#39;t realized how much she needed the time<br/>
in the pool.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I could be way off but this comment sounds to me like she is repeating<br/>
something your sister must have said to her after practice was over to<br/>
prove herself right in forcing her to go.( again because I have<br/>
parented this way and still am learning not too) Not to say that she<br/>
did not have a good time and did not benefit from the swimming.:) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My nephew has a lot of behaviors that are difficult for me to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>deal with. Most of them are what I think of<br/>
as the typical &quot;terrible two&quot;--or in this case, &quot;terrible<br/>
three&quot;--behaviors: whining when he doesn&#39;t get what he wants, temper<br/>
tantrums, throwing things, etc. He often does things that almost feel<br/>
like he is testing me: throwing all of my clean, folded laundry onto a<br/>
pile on the floor was the one that got my goat today.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my world! My 3.5ds is the child who is teaching me to<br/>
mindful parent. He is very physical and emotional and when he is not<br/>
getting his needs served he hits he punches, he dumps things and does<br/>
this really annoying whine pant.The slightest sense that he is being<br/>
restricted in anyway makes him rebellious.What scares me is his<br/>
rebellion against safety issues as I really try not to restrict<br/>
him-e.g. he sneaks in the street. He can be very physical even when he<br/>
is not mad too. As i now really look hard at his behavior to try and<br/>
understand him I have discovered that he gets very physical with his<br/>
brother when he is bored ( I have ds9 and ds6) This is when I have to<br/>
change his surroundings get him outside try and engage him in<br/>
something but he does not always transition well depending how far<br/>
gone he is in his emotional state.  Tantrums: I stay near ..I ask him<br/>
what he needs, sometimes he says sometimes he just rages. I quietly<br/>
offer him solutions which  may or may not be accepted. Mostly I ask<br/>
him if he wants me to hold him and if he says no I say that I am here<br/>
when you are ready for me. I repeat after a minute or so and he<br/>
usually comes to me. I tell him how sorry I am that he is upset and I<br/>
want to help him make it better. This process can take anywhere from 5<br/>
minutes to an hour depending on the severity of the tantrum and the<br/>
cause and or his state of mind going into it: tired/hungry/sugar buzz.<br/>
---I try not to restrict what he eats and he does get a lot of treats,<br/>
 but recently I am trying to see if there is a trend in his behavior<br/>
regarding his sugar intake. I have not seen anything conclusive but he<br/>
picked out on his own sugar free icepops last week. He ate them for a<br/>
few days and now won&#39;t touch them. I wonder if he is unconsciously<br/>
aware that the are not giving him the sugar rush he is used to and<br/>
that is why he does not like them anymore Hmmm?.<br/>
<br/>
It is way too early to worry about how your baby will be at this age.<br/>
Enjoy him where he is... it goes so fast! So many times I had to catch<br/>
myself to stop and just enjoy, the dishes would eventually get done<br/>
but my beautiful boys are this big for a millisecond:). . By all means<br/>
though practice and formulate you ideas about parenting and use it on<br/>
your niece and nephew. You are lucky to get an early start as I am<br/>
just getting here, a little late but still my kids are young enough to<br/>
reap the benefit.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly lurk here and glean from these wise and wonderful people. It<br/>
has helped me so much, I can&#39;t even begin to share how grateful I am<br/>
that I found this board.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend the NoMoreSpanking yahoo group, I have learned a<br/>
great deal there too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He may not be&quot;testing&quot; you. He may want to play in the empty laundry <br/>
basket, he may want to see how the clothes will fly through the air. <br/>
Or he may have done this before with his parents and gotten a HUGE <br/>
response and he wants to see that adult big emotion again. Even if it <br/>
was scary.<br/>
<br/>
My older boy is an observer, he hardly ever did anything &quot;naughty&quot; <br/>
when he was little, he was too busy watching everything (as I <br/>
understand now). My younger boy is a do-er and an imp. He is so sweet <br/>
and he loves getting reactions. He likes pinching me to see my <br/>
reaction. He&#39;ll be smiling when he does it. If it doesn&#39;t really hurt <br/>
I&#39;ll make a game of it and chase him around the house with us <br/>
pinching each other. If it does hurt I&#39;ll tell him it hurts and ask <br/>
him to please stop. But then I&#39;ll immediately distract him with <br/>
something new since at a few months under three he can&#39;t possibly <br/>
stop himself much of the time. He went through a stage of temper <br/>
tantrums and so did my older boy at more like age 4 than 2. They have <br/>
so little control of their emotions and life can be very frustrating <br/>
for little ones at times. Even just being little gets frustrating <br/>
sometimes. I feel its important to validate their feelings and try to <br/>
give them words for them - &quot;You seem frustrated (disappointed, <br/>
annoyed...) to me&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s upsetting when ... happens, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clean laundry thrown around? I hate to say it but get used to it! I <br/>
have changed my cleanliness, messiness and even personal hygiene <br/>
standards tremendously since having kids. If something like this <br/>
happens again with him try humor - put a pair of the shorts on your <br/>
head or something. Accept that he&#39;ll make a mess of the pile but <br/>
he&#39;ll also learn that he can trust you to be playful and not lecture <br/>
or time-out him for being playful and childish.<br/>
