<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896155312">Ya gotta get out of the house.<br/>
It&#39;s very easy to get wrapped up (and I know I get lazy) in what&#39;s  happening <br/>
inside. But after a while, and particularly as we head into winter,  you have <br/>
to get out.<br/>
 <br/>
Think about where you live...there is SO much to do around!!!! You can head  <br/>
into Boston for dozens of museums, etc.  If money is an issue, most of the  <br/>
libraries have free passes. Heck, we&#39;re members of the Science Museum, and I  <br/>
have free passes I&#39;d be happy to give you. Danielle has an interesting sense of  <br/>
humor -- go visit the Museum of Bad Art! <br/>

 <br/>
Wander around Salem for an afternoon. Go to the Guitar Center and let her  <br/>
play with guitars you can&#39;t possibly afford for a while. If you can afford to  <br/>
join the Family Resource Center, do it... Julian and I used to spend time  <br/>
looking at the new newsletters and decide what things to do. The activities once  <br/>
you&#39;ve joined are usually pretty cheap, and you put it on your calendar, and,  <br/>
voila! Structure that you&#39;ve chosen!!! Stuff to look forward to!<br/>
 <br/>
Structure isn&#39;t bad...enforced structure is!  Make plans... Do  stuff!  <br/>

I think also I&#39;ve been holding it all together for so long with all <br/>
that&#39;s been going on this past year, I&#39;M stuck (and I think I need a <br/>
good cry!)<br/>

<br/>
She went on so many &quot;field trips&quot; to MOS in school, she&#39;s not really <br/>
excited to go right now (there have been things planned with the <br/>
homeschool group etc).  But thanks!   I&#39;ll keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about going into Boston on the train to check out some <br/>
places, (her dad works in Boston, we could meet him for lunch), but <br/>
again, a big part of the problem is getting her up in the morning.  <br/>
She likes to sleep until noon.<br/>

I&#39;ll definitely check that out! (yes, she does have an interesting <br/>
sense of humor!)<br/>

<br/>
I got your email and one from Julian (I&#39;ll respond!).  When I told <br/>
her about Julian offering to go check out guitars at the Guitar <br/>
center, her eyes lit up!   (We&#39;ll talk about that off line).  I&#39;d <br/>
like to join the FRC but it seems many of the events she might be <br/>
interested in start in the AM, which means she&#39;d REALLY have to want <br/>
to go to be able to get up early enough to drive there (they&#39;re not <br/>
all 20 mins away).   Can you see my dilemma?<br/>
<br/>
We have been talking about planning to get out more.   The dialogue <br/>
continues.<br/>

Read here about teens and staying up at night and sleeping late the  <br/>
next day - it is a biological thing!<br/>

Go to the very bottom of that page and there are three articles about  <br/>
teens and sleep - very important information for parents of teens.<br/>

<br/>
I should have been more specific!   I have NO problem with her <br/>
sleeping! I DON&#39;T comment on it.  I have read those articles <br/>
(thanks! - I&#39;ve been reading EVERYTHING I can get my hands on for 2+ <br/>
years before we pulled her out of school).  The problem comes at <br/>
night, because she won&#39;t stay up alone, and even though I&#39;m a night <br/>
person, I&#39;m finding lately I need to get to sleep earlier than 2 or 3 <br/>
AM because I can&#39;t sleep later than 10 AM (I&#39;m usually awake after 8 <br/>
AM or so, my back starts bothering me).   We&#39;ve discussed this, and <br/>
she wants me to help her get to bed earlier (we have a bedtime <br/>
ritual, another reason she won&#39;t do a sleepover, which is fine), we <br/>
were starting to do better, but then this week and her period has had <br/>
us up late with long conversations, which I&#39;m glad for, but it IS <br/>
again catching up with me (I don&#39;t do well with a nap during the day <br/>
usually, once in a while if I&#39;m really exhausted).<br/>
<br/>
My dh gets up early to take the train into Boston, so by the end of <br/>
the day, he&#39;s beat (plus it&#39;s been very stressful at work for him <br/>
lately, so he looks forward to coming home to veg).   But that&#39;s not <br/>
to say it won&#39;t appeal to him sometime.<br/>
<br/>
We have to go to my MIL&#39;s house on the Cape (Cod) tomorrow (dh has it <br/>
off from work) to do some final consmetic fixes.   We want to leave <br/>
by 10, so she&#39;ll have to get to bed earlier as she&#39;s going with us.   <br/>
She&#39;s going to help us paint some closet shelves etc (she likes to <br/>
paint!).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll get outside that box, I promise!   <br/>

<br/>
One of the things I do, have done in the past more than now but still do<br/>
sometimes, is set up a bed for myself on the sofa in the living room (the<br/>
room Jayn and I are in at night - being our only other choice in a 1 bedroom<br/>
apartment). I have become good at snoozing with a pillow over my head for<br/>
noise/light reduction. I get somewhat broken up naps, but it is better than<br/>
no sleep at all. <br/>
<br/>
It may not apply if she actually wants your engaged attention rather than<br/>
merely your presence. It is a shorter walk to the kitchen from the sofa than<br/>
from the bedroom for Jayn&#39;s near inevitable corn dog request before<br/>
sleeping.<br/>
