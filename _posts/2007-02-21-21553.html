<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395469164">Both of my children are unvaccinated. Some family<br/>
accepts it... some family think I&#39;m trying to kill my<br/>
children.  Most medical practioners think I&#39;m stupid.<br/>
I have my own feelings on the dangers of vaccinations,<br/>
but if nothing else, I must agree that subjecting an<br/>
infant to several diseases each month when their<br/>
immune system is not even fully developed is lunacy.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I talk about it with another parent who is<br/>
considering not vaccinating.... I generally try to put<br/>
it from the angle of &quot;You can always vaccinate later,<br/>
especially once the immune system is better developed,<br/>
and at a slower pace than what the doctor&#39;s office<br/>
wants to do them at.&quot; I think it helps to relax<br/>
parents who are woried that it&#39;s an all-or-nothing<br/>
deal that they can still vaccinate should they decide<br/>
it&#39;s necessary. But for us, I plan to see to it that<br/>
my children never have another needle stuck in their<br/>
body unless they choose to themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675399571">My sister&#39;s best friend was going to delay<br/>
vaccinating, but when her child was born, the doctors<br/>
told her they would not release the baby until she<br/>
allowed them to vaccinate. She was naive enough to<br/>
believe them. That sort of thing just burns me up,<br/>
especially for Ohio where she could have said,<br/>
&quot;Philosophical exemption,&quot; and that should have been<br/>
the end of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732961527">Yes. Two of my sister-in-laws have avoided it as well<br/>
as my own sister. Three births were in Ohio and one in<br/>
Washington. They simply told the doctor/nurse they did<br/>
not want to vaccinate, and that was that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207840413">You might try looking for a DAN doctor. Granted, DAN<br/>
stands for &quot;Defeat Autism Now&quot;... but our DAN doctor<br/>
(Ann Arbor, Michigan) is very much into homeopathy. We<br/>
found out my son had a yeast overgrowth, and the<br/>
results came back with two different ways to treat it.<br/>
One was a prescription and one was herbal. He<br/>
recommended the herbal over prescription. Same thing<br/>
when my son had scabies. We could have treated it with<br/>
the prescription cream (which he said would be okay),<br/>
but that if we wished to go the other route.. then we<br/>
should give these supplements and cover the affected<br/>
areas with neem oil every day. It took as long to get<br/>
rid of as it would have taken with the prescription,<br/>
and was a lot healthier, IMHO. <br/>
