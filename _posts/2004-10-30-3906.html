I am  kind of confused.  I tried to change to the digest version both here <br/>
and  at unschooling basics and I am still getting every email.  Then over at  <br/>
unschooling basics, I clicked on NO EMAIL and I still get every message in my  <br/>
inbox.  it says it&#39;s been updated but it&#39;s not working.  Do I need  to <br/>
unsubscribe and resubscibe to make it go?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No, just be patient. It usually takes a few hours to a few days.<br/>
