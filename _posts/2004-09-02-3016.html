<div id="ygrps-yiv-513544721">How do you handle differences of opinion with family members?  To <br/>
make a long story short...my son hit my sister w/a wiffle ball bat.  <br/>
He was trying to hit walnuts at their new car.  The incident occured <br/>
while she was babysitting.  She went over to him to take the bat and <br/>
he hit her. During that time my mom had stopped by as well as my <br/>
other sister.  There was alot of activity and Ethan enjoys an <br/>
audience.  He is very high energy and easily overstimulated. (I am <br/>
not making excuses for him...although that is what my sister thinks) <br/>
<br/>
I told my sister that we had been using bats and tennis rackets to <br/>
hit the walnuts into the woods the week before.  I spoke to Ethan the <br/>
next day about what the bat is for and that hitting someone is not <br/>
okay. I apologized to my sister.  Today I got an email and she just <br/>
had to get &quot;some things&quot; off her chest.  She said that the behavior <br/>
was inexcusable and she expects respect for herself and her property. <br/>
She doesnt agree w/our &quot;discipline&quot; and thinks he should know <br/>
better.  She feels he is crying out for more structure and a more <br/>
punitive discipline style.  I tried in vain to explain our position <br/>
which is gentle discipline/attachment parenting (i didnt use those <br/>
words because I would have totally lost her).  <br/>
<br/>
Please help with any advice or similar situations.  I am really <br/>
feeling bad about how this is affecting our relationship as well as <br/>
her relationship w/my children.<br/>

She feels he is crying out for more structure and a more<br/>
punitive discipline style.  I tried in vain to explain our position<br/>
which is gentle discipline/attachment parenting (i didnt use those<br/>
words because I would have totally lost her).<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not clear how old Ethan is; my Sam is 4. I can tell you that with my <br/>
guy a more structured/punitive style of parenting would not work--it <br/>
would, in fact, escalate the issues. Have you read _The Explosive Child_ <br/>
by Ross Greene? It&#39;ll really back you up in what you *know* in you <br/>
heart. Greene is a PhD, psychologist--use that with your sister. Maybe <br/>
the credentialed expert will help back you up and make your point.<br/>
<br/>
What helps with my guy is loving limits and as much freedom as possible. <br/>
When he starts raging (not what Ethan was doing, I know) or becomes <br/>
destructive, I often have to physically remove him from the situation <br/>
because he DOES need to know that hitting and destroying isn&#39;t <br/>
acceptable--your sister&#39;s right about that much. Sam protests, and I <br/>
often bear the brunt of that. But as he gets older, it is getting <br/>
better. I take him into the bedroom, lay down on the bed with him, hold <br/>
him or rub his back and gently explain why I couldn&#39;t let him continue <br/>
what he was doing. And, within short moments, he is usually collapsed in <br/>
tears and so sorry for the way he handled his emotions. He IS GETTING <br/>
BETTER at dealing with his strong emotions; he IS NOT escalating with <br/>
his behavior, which is what some people predict will happen with this <br/>
kind of child if you don&#39;t &quot;lay down the law&quot;. Greene&#39;s book is really <br/>
excellent on that point.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I was away from him for really the first time, and my dh, <br/>
who is more *traditional* than I, was with him at his parents&#39; beach <br/>
house. I&#39;m not sure what went on--something in between gentle parenting <br/>
and spanking, something rough but short of spanking, I&#39;m sure. But...I <br/>
am now picking up those pieces. Sam keeps lashing out and then saying, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m a mean guy, aren&#39;t I?&quot; My heart is breaking because these kids are <br/>
so incredibly sensitive. Yes, they rage, test boundaries, but it cuts <br/>
them to the quick--it comes at such a great personal cost in a way <br/>
that&#39;s almost compulsive. These kids--if your Ethan is *anything* like <br/>
my Sam--need to know that they are loved no matter what and that really <br/>
seems to be what they&#39;re testing. To keep their selves intact, to keep <br/>
their self-image positive, they look to us, and if the messages that <br/>
we&#39;re sending are that they are somehow less than whole, less than <br/>
human, less than kind--well, that just destroys them from the inside out.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please continue to listen to your own instincts. <br/>
Apologize to your sister and assure her that if you were there, you <br/>
would have guided Ethan away from hitting the walnuts at her car. Arm <br/>
her with specific techniques that will improve the situation rather than <br/>
disintigrate it further. And, maybe, consider not leaving Ethan alone <br/>
with them anymore--I know that&#39;s what I&#39;ve vowed with my Sam.<br/>
<br/>
And...read *anything* you can get your hands on by Anne Ohman, a regular <br/>
at the now-unavailable Unschooling.com boards. You can read some of her <br/>
stuff at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/specialunschooling">http://www.sandradodd.com/specialunschooling</a> . She is an <br/>
absolute inspiration for how to parent high-need children against the <br/>
prevailing opinions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good grief, he&#39;s 4 1/2?!? Reading your original email, I thought your<br/>
sister was so worked up because he was, like, 12 years old. Isn&#39;t a<br/>
four and a half year old sort of feeling out the boundaries of his<br/>
world? Like, if I do A, what will happen? Oh, B. &#39;Kay, got it.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of teaching a child &quot;right from wrong,&quot; to me, is one of<br/>
the most miserable excuses on record for those people whose idea of<br/>
discipline more or less amounts to yelling and snatching things away -<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to imply that your sister thinks that way, although it<br/>
sure is easy to make grand pronouncements about parenting when you<br/>
don&#39;t have any yet. ;) I have seen more people than I care to mention<br/>
berate THREE YEAR OLDS about &quot;right and wrong&quot; - &quot;You know it&#39;s wrong<br/>
to take his toy! That&#39;s not yours! Tell him you&#39;re sorry!&quot; That&#39;s<br/>
meaningless to a child of three! I just think &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are<br/>
very complicated concepts, and it takes a long time and a lot of<br/>
experience to truly learn them. Well, anyway, just a thought. It&#39;s<br/>
amazing how, when you stray from the &quot;regular&quot; or mainstream or<br/>
whatever path in life, people take it as a cue that they do not have<br/>
to keep their opinions to themselves. I have no real insight to give<br/>
you, just babble; but I hope you&#39;re feeling a little better about the<br/>
whole thing. :)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, sorry for all the blah blah.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Karen, this is such a difficult thing to go through. It is hard to juggle <br/>
family relationships when there is a difference of philosopy/belief  about <br/>
discipline. I had a similar situation with my mom. <br/>
I listened to what she had to say, and said that while I understood that to <br/>
her it looked like what I was doing with my children was not normal or what <br/>
others do, it is what my husband and I choose to do, and is really very well <br/>
thought out. I explained very short form about what we believe in, and said if she <br/>
wanted more info I could supply it. I also said, very kindly, that we will <br/>
not be changing what we are doing, and I hoped she could come to terms with <br/>
that. It was one of the harder things I have ever had to do, and for a short time <br/>
things were a bit awkward, but now I think she respects me for doing what I <br/>
really believe in and for doing what I think is the very best thing for my <br/>
children. <br/>
She also sees that my kids are great, and I bet  your sister will also. Hard <br/>
stuff to do tho, I have NEVER asserted myself with my mom before, and it was <br/>
quite free-ing to  do. <br/>
Just my experience<br/>
