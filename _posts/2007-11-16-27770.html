She  wants to lay in my bed, hug on me (which<br/>
I love) but then she doesn&#39;t get  anything done and I will not allow<br/>
those rabbits to sit out there hungry  and thirsty while she gets her<br/>
tummy filled.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just focusing on the rabbits.  I see that your concern is that the  rabbits <br/>
need to be fed.  Your daughter has other things on her mind, which  she is 7 <br/>
and will probably take reminding.  I am assuming that the rabbits  are something <br/>
she wants to do.  If she takes care of them around  the same time each day <br/>
then they will be fine.  They don&#39;t know what  she is doing, that she is eating, <br/>
snuggling, playing.   Also what we  have here are the automatic water and <br/>
food dispensers.  So we don&#39;t have to  worry about them, and can go on vacations <br/>
etc, without concern.  That might  be something to consider as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think looking at things from both sides helps.  When my boys want  <br/>
something and I want something different, it helps to step back look at the  <br/>
situation, try to understand each other&#39;s wants and needs and work out a  solution that <br/>
is agreeable to all of us.  I am sure if you think about it  more you could <br/>
come up with other solutions as well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Welcome to unschooling!!  You should try to find at  least one other <br/>
unschooling family near you to hang out with, talk to etc.   It is so nice.  But the <br/>
whole change in your thought process can be a  little overwhelming for some <br/>
people.  And it can be hard to let go of old  habits.  Just try to think about <br/>
why you do things the way you do, is it  because of habit?, what are your <br/>
daughter&#39;s thoughts on the topic  etc. ?   <br/>
