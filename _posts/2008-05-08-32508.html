<div id="ygrps-yiv-617730848">I can&#39;t remember if it was on this group or AlwaysUnschooled that <br/>
Ren&#39;s quiz about what we learned in school was posted. Since there <br/>
are a lot of the same people on both I figured I&#39;d post this here. <br/>
It seems more appropriate for here. *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I asked my husband if he thought he used anything that he <br/>
learned in K-12 school today in his job. His answer surprised me. He <br/>
said that he thought the stuff he learned in 1st-6th grade was very <br/>
important to his daily life, basic math and reading. He said the <br/>
stuff he learned in middle and high school he probably could&#39;ve <br/>
learned on his own. That seemed backward to me. It seems to me that <br/>
the basics in math and reading would be more easily learned without <br/>
school. The more advanced stuff like Algebra or high school <br/>
Chemistry or Physics (in terms of formulas and theories and such, <br/>
not practical application) might require at least the help of <br/>
someone knowledgeable in those areas but those are things that not <br/>
everyone needs to learn.<br/>
<br/>
That lead to us discussing learning to read. He did not agree with <br/>
me that people could learn to read without being taught even though <br/>
he can&#39;t really remember being taught to read. He said, &quot;You think <br/>
someone can just pick up a book and start reading without being <br/>
taught?&quot; Of course, my answer was yes but he didn&#39;t buy it. I went <br/>
on to explain that we are facilitating learning to read when we read <br/>
to the kids so it&#39;s not like they will ever be in a situation where <br/>
they&#39;ve never seen a printed word and then all of a sudden decide to <br/>
read. However, I do believe that a person could do that if/when they <br/>
really wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I just found my husband&#39;s perspective interesting and thought I&#39;d <br/>
throw that out here for discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940803810">Well i dont agree with it being necessary to go to school for 1st-6th grade ...or any grade for that matter. I do agree that whats normally taught in those grades is more essential. Basic reading and math skills, an idea of how to read a map ( or use mapquest, or ask for directions) so you can find where you need to go are more important than knowledge of traditional high school subjects. <br/>
   <br/>
  There are many many jobs out there.....all to one degree or another where people go through high school and /or college then realize that as far as the job is concerned they dont know *%$@ but pick up what they need to know quickly because it is useful and interesting to them. <br/>
   <br/>
  If a person decides to become a dog trainer to train service dogs, or search and rescue or whatever they would want to gather information about things like dog behavior , breed traits, history, etc. Basic knowlege of reading and math would be extremely useful as would experience working with others of different ages and backgrounds ( something not gotten in ps) . However unless their favorite weekend pasttime is making bombs all those high school chemistry and physics classes will probably be useless. <br/>

<br/>
Then how do so many of us have children that did exactly this!? They<br/>
don&#39;t just &quot;pick up a book&quot; one day...they DO figure out how to read<br/>
one day though. In my home, there are many books, video games, printed<br/>
words on packages etc...and a person would be exposed to those things<br/>
for years. So yeah, it looked like one day, a kid just picked<br/>
something up and read it. Like magic.<br/>
<br/>
But they were decoding language all along. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way, from a certain point of view, he&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
People can&#39;t learn to read in a vacuum. In a culture without print,  <br/>
you couldn&#39;t hand a person a book and expect them to read.<br/>
<br/>
But *how* does someone acquire the knowledge necessary to read?  <br/>
Because teaching reading is universal in the culture, we think the  <br/>
ability to read comes from teachers putting the knowledge into kids  <br/>
heads. We think that&#39;s probably the best way since everyone does it  <br/>
that way. (And since it&#39;s (supposedly) the best way, and since some  <br/>
kids have problems reading, then reading must be really hard to learn.<br/>
<br/>
The assumptions are wrong, of course. Unschoolers have oodles of kids  <br/>
who have learned to read without being taught. Not only do we have  <br/>
full literacy -- though it occasionally comes much later than schools  <br/>
expect it -- but it works *much* better than being taught.<br/>
<br/>
It makes no sense until you see it happen. Kids figure out reading  <br/>
the same way they figured out how to speak: by observing, by trying  <br/>
things out, by using it to get something they want. In a world full  <br/>
of STOP and McDonalds and moms willing to answer questions (and read  <br/>
to them) and video games where you get good feed back on why it&#39;s  <br/>
important to recognize the phrase &quot;Do you want to save?&quot; ;-) kids  <br/>
can&#39;t *not* figure it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495194950">This morning my 6 yr old asked the little boy that we are fostering<br/>
right now why he had to go to school... the boy replied that you HAD<br/>
to go to school to learn so you could get a good job... Jack thought<br/>
about it for a second and said &quot;what happens if you don&#39;t get a GOOD<br/>
job?   I think I would rather have a fun job&quot;    Funny how some adults<br/>
don&#39;t even get this and my 6 yr old has it figured out! <br/>
<br/>
Oh and for the record... my father never took a woodworking class and<br/>
builds beautiful furniture which he learned to build from a book.. the<br/>
tools he uses ...learned to use those from a book also...my mother<br/>
learned to make beautiful baskets from a book, my husband learned car<br/>
repair from a book none were ever &quot;taught&quot; by anyone.   One summer I<br/>
taught myself to play the alto saxophone... when I returned to school<br/>
and told my music director I wanted to switch from clarinet to<br/>
saxophone that I had learned over the summer he refused to let me<br/>
until I lied and said I took lessons!   All of my children have<br/>
learned tons of things from books while never being taught by anyone<br/>
else.   Anyone ever heard of &quot;independent study&quot;???   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120295371">I have to agree that anything taught after 5th or 6th grade is far less <br/>
useful than grade school, for general knowledge, but after sending 5 kids <br/>
to public school the thing I noticed the most was how much their learning <br/>
slowed when they entered school.  Four of the five were avid readers before <br/>
kindergarten and struggled with boredom with the primitive books they had <br/>
to use in school.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember consciously teaching them to read.  Between Sesame Street, <br/>
which was new when my oldest was a toddler, and the fact that they were <br/>
read to daily, and were part of a family that always read, they learned <br/>
because they wanted to learn.  Same with basic math.  They understood <br/>
addition, subtraction and multiplication because it was in games we played <br/>
when we were together.  They also understood basic parts of search because <br/>
we talked about it.  If they said they were cold, I&#39;d asked where cold <br/>
lived, and they would answer, &quot;On adjective street.&quot;  Sometimes I would say <br/>
something like, &quot;that&#39;s right, right next to chilly and across from <br/>
freezing.&quot;  It was always a fun game for all of us.  They loved comparing <br/>
descriptive words and finding similar terms. They would have fun make their <br/>
own list of neighbors.  We were free to follow their interests as far as <br/>
they wanted.  And free to not follow an interest if it didn&#39;t fit.    My <br/>
youngest did not become an avid reader until about fourth grade.  She <br/>
learned to read at about 6 years old, but was always too busy to sit still <br/>
with a book. Now she&#39;s 12 and loves to read as much as the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Subjects taught in middle and high school might be more suited to a group <br/>
situation with a teacher, but there has to be a better way.  While some of <br/>
the knowledge taught in school is valuable, learning it in school, was, for <br/>
the most part, inhibiting, stifling, frustrating and most of all boring.<br/>

don&#39;t know any different yet because we haven&#39;t experienced it but <br/>
it certainly can be done.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that basic math and reading are probably more important <br/>
than the specialized subjects that are taught in high school. I <br/>
don&#39;t agree with my husband&#39;s idea (fear) that those things can only <br/>
be learned through teaching.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been making a point of telling him about all the ways our 4yo <br/>
is starting to learn to read without any teaching. It&#39;s amazing to <br/>
me. I wish my husband could experience it first hand but he&#39;s not <br/>
home a lot. He doesn&#39;t see the little steps every day. Last night we <br/>
were reading a book and my ds went through reading each of the <br/>
letters in a few words and then pronouncing the words with me. He <br/>
wanted to do it, asked me what the letters and words were, pointed <br/>
to each one and read what he could. It was such a joy to witness and <br/>
be a part of.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is true with everything---not just reading.<br/>
<br/>
We have a pool, so Duncan has been in the water almost every summer day <br/>
since he was born. He swam &quot;magically&quot; one day at four or five. Of <br/>
course, it didn&#39;t all happen *that* day. The learning was happening for <br/>
years and years. The &quot;appearance&quot; of being a swimmer was simply obvious <br/>
on that day.<br/>
<br/>
I train dogs. It&#39;s part of my life. My kids *understand* how to work <br/>
with dogs because it&#39;s just a large part of our lives. They see me work <br/>
with them and are surrounded by dog training. I would say that they are <br/>
also &quot;dog trainers&quot;---but I can&#39;t say *when* that happened.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently become a gardener. They see me in the garden every day. <br/>
They are surrounded by beautiful plants and fruits and vegies. I talk <br/>
about my wonders and woes. It&#39;s a part of who we are---all that <br/>
growing. What *day* are they considered gardeners?<br/>
<br/>
We all love to cook. Both boys have been in the kitchen preparing and <br/>
playing with food since they were born. I don&#39;t know that any of us <br/>
knows &quot;when&quot; they became cooks---it was a process, but everyone&#39;s <br/>
comfortable in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I don&#39;t play musical instruments, so that&#39;s NOT a daily part of <br/>
our lives. We nevertheless have (at least one) musical child. He didn&#39;t <br/>
get that from simply living with us and being exposed to instruments on <br/>
a regular basis. We had to make a special effort with music <br/>
learning---it wasn&#39;t by &quot;osmosis&quot; like lots of these other things, but <br/>
it happened anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is BY FAR easiest when we are surrounded by and immersed in <br/>
whatever we&#39;re learning.<br/>
<br/>
I tell you what---does your husband speak another language?<br/>
<br/>
If so, is he fluent? How did he learn that language?<br/>
<br/>
If not, was he &quot;taught&quot; a language in school? How many years? If he <br/>
isn&#39;t fluent, why NOT?<br/>
<br/>
Learning a language by being completely immersed in the language and <br/>
culture is incredibly EASY. I mean---AMAZINGLY easy! Schools, though, <br/>
don&#39;t teach that way. Learning a second language in a &quot;schooly&quot; fashion <br/>
(by being TAUGHT by rote) rarely (although I admit it&#39;s not impossible) <br/>
produces a fluent speaker. It&#39;s HARD that way.<br/>
<br/>
Living with a native-speaking family in the foreign country for six <br/>
months can produce a confident, fluent speaker---with lots of <br/>
colloquialisms and slang and figures of speech. Four years of a typical <br/>
high school language class often produces someone who can&#39;t even find a <br/>
bathroom in the foreign country.<br/>
<br/>
Immerse your child in the written word (which is hard NOT to do in our <br/>
culture), and he will read as soon as he is ready.<br/>

Grandparents&#39; registration ONLY is free. *I* can comp that. But the BRA <br/>
still charges me for food and lodging for each person, so it must be <br/>
covered.<br/>
<br/>
As darling as your mom may be, she still needs to pay for room and <br/>
board. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ben missed half of last year&#39;s conference due to a last minute change <br/>
in his schedule. This year&#39;s military exercise better NOT change to <br/>
conference weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Ben should be slammed at work from mid-Sept through Dec due to some <br/>
crazy exercise. It&#39;s the last one for a while. Maybe then we can plan <br/>
better! He&#39;s had some awesome opportunities he&#39;s had to turn down <br/>
because of this two-year-long exercise and its planning. it&#39;s what he <br/>
likes doing---logistics and all, but he *has* to be there.<br/>

Where&#39;s your husband heading?<br/>

   If a person decides to become a dog trainer to train service dogs, or <br/>
search<br/>
and rescue or whatever they would want to gather information about <br/>
things like<br/>
dog behavior , breed traits, history, etc. Basic knowlege of reading <br/>
and math<br/>
would be extremely useful as would experience working with others of <br/>
different<br/>
ages and backgrounds ( something not gotten in ps) . However unless <br/>
their<br/>
favorite weekend pasttime is making bombs all those high school <br/>
chemistry and<br/>
physics classes will probably be useless.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, about training service dogs---or doing ANYTHING: all <br/>
those &quot;school subjects&quot; get learned simply by immersing yourself in <br/>
this passion.<br/>
<br/>
If you are *into* training dogs, for example, you WILL *study* math and <br/>
science and history and art and social studies and literature <br/>
and---everything.<br/>
<br/>
But it won&#39;t necessarily *look* like what they study in school.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d learn that basic math by feeding the dogs and calculating how <br/>
much food you&#39;ll need to order, etc. By estimating the distance to the <br/>
next block or by figuring how many calendars you&#39;ll need to sell. You <br/>
could learn to read by reading DOG books ---you know---what&#39;s <br/>
interesting to *you*! &lt;g&gt; So you *could* learn those &quot;basics&quot; just by <br/>
doing what you love!<br/>
<br/>
History of the different breeds and their origins, breeding, nutrition, <br/>
dogs in art (there&#39;s a museum in St Louis devoted to ONLY that! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
genetics, physiology, physics, form follows function, psychology, human <br/>
nature/dog nature,...<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a passion that I can think of that wouldn&#39;t cover all the <br/>
school subjects if you were immersed into that passion completely. (In <br/>
SC, we have to &quot;cover&quot; reading, writing, math, science, social studies, <br/>
literature and composition. I used that as my guide. Note---no PE, art, <br/>
drama, or music.)<br/>
<br/>
Just because you *think* &quot;bomb&quot; classes would be useless---what if you <br/>
were training bomb detection dogs? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Okinawa or on a MEU. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way for us to know <br/>

No, you would NOT be charged for lodging if you don&#39;t sleep at the BRA. <br/>
You would be responsible for the commuter meal plan though.<br/>

happen at 2:00am that could change your life. Seriously. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

off-site! &lt;G&gt; But if can possible swing it, you&#39;d be happier on-site.<br/>

Lat year, there was a young teen whose family stayed at the KOA. He <br/>
couldn&#39;t leave at night. Just couldn&#39;t. So he stayed in one of our <br/>

Imagine that! I just learned something OUT of the high school chemistry <br/>
classroom! As a 47 year old.<br/>
<br/>
And I did NOT learn it when I was IN high school chemistry class---not <br/>
in Chemistry I OR Chemistry II. Didn&#39;t learn it in college Chemistry <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Did they not *teach* it at the top private prep school in the state? Or <br/>
did I just not listen? Maybe they *did* &quot;teach&quot; it, and maybe I just <br/>
memorized it for the final exam and immediately forgot it.<br/>

I think if you were to go look for &quot;research&quot; on &quot;critical thinking <br/>
skills,&quot; you would find that from 15 on is when we do a LOT of critical <br/>
thinking. It&#39;s the &quot;age&quot; of deep thinking.<br/>
<br/>
NOT that *I* don&#39;t believe that even infants engage in critical <br/>
thinking, but &quot;research&quot; would show that a LOT of deeper, *more* <br/>
critical thinking happens in mid-to-late teens years and beyond.<br/>

Yeah---$1,500/night---payable in small, unmarked bills. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The room rates vary, depending on where you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Try this: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnshop.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=32_19">http://liveandlearnshop.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=32_19</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s by going to the &quot;shop&quot; and clicking on &quot;2008&quot; and clicking on <br/>
&quot;accommodations&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then click on each of the selections to see what&#39;s available. As little <br/>
as $240 for a &#39;sleeps two&#39; in Abbott and as much as $1600 for a &#39;sleeps <br/>
16&#39; in one of the cottages---that&#39;s for all four nights.<br/>
<br/>
The average is $360-$400 for a sleeps four for all four nights, so from <br/>
$60-100/night, depending on your needs and size of your family.<br/>

health by searching above and beyond the medical system.<br/>
<br/>
And there is emotional sick.<br/>
                 As others on this list, my family KNOWS it can be caused by the system.   <br/>
Still many people obviously don&#39;t.  <br/>
They don&#39;t TEACH that school might be bad...in school!  <br/>
<br/>
Yep!  Critical thinking is required for THAT one!! <br/>

chemistry. I&#39;ve read them in real life from non-textbook sources.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re confusing the distilled information that might come from a  <br/>
Chemistry class with information that might get labeled &quot;Chemistry.&quot;  <br/>
You don&#39;t need a chemistry class to acquire information about  <br/>
chemistry. Chemistry exists in the world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *much* more useful to know how to question things and how to  <br/>
research something than it is to memorize what someone else thinks  <br/>
might be useful to know. One reason is that if an answer doesn&#39;t come  <br/>
with a need to know, it&#39;s likely to be forgotten. (That&#39;s where 2  <br/>
years of Spanish went!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lets see as we start to postulate what is making our kids sick in  <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; environment, unless we have some understanding of such things we will<br/>
&gt; discount many of the baseline information that can be quite helpful in<br/>
&gt; pointing us and our doctors in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And people learn to question experts by sitting in classrooms for 12+  <br/>
years under the philosophy of &quot;Sit down, shut up, do what you&#39;re told  <br/>
and we&#39;ll hand you what you need to know&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you attend an unschooling conference you&#39;ll meet kids who aren&#39;t  <br/>
facing life unexamined. Can the same be said of schooled kids? How  <br/>
many schooled kids reach the end of high school with no idea what  <br/>
they want to do? How many go onto college, switching majors until  <br/>
they hit on something that isn&#39;t too hard?<br/>
<br/>
If a schooled kid comes out of school critically thinking it&#39;s in  <br/>
spite of school not because of it. Unschooled parents know that  <br/>
because our kids *do* think critically without school. (Though my  <br/>
daughter did attend 2 months of 2nd grade. Maybe that was key and why  <br/>
she thinks critically now!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I actually while<br/>
&gt; really leaning on those critical foundational issues of the early<br/>
&gt; elementary education am of the sense that my high school years and<br/>
&gt; beyond is where i really learned to critically think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But apparently not to write clearly. Big words and unclear sentences  <br/>
can flummox people into believing that someone knows what they&#39;re  <br/>
talking about, but it won&#39;t fly here. Everything that passes through  <br/>
here is scrutinized and turned inside out and upside down. Lack of  <br/>
clarity just wastes time. Please reread what you write before  <br/>
clicking send. Please put in paragraphs to separate topics. Don&#39;t  <br/>
waste your and our time.<br/>
<br/>
If I understand what you said above, I&#39;d counter that if everyone  <br/>
gave children walking lessons beginning at 9 mos then everyone would  <br/>
think the walking lessons were responsible for children walking.<br/>
<br/>
That sound ridiculous, and yet, without a control group of kids who  <br/>
are not schooled, you and 99% of the people in the US assume that  <br/>
people learn because of school. Why *would* they believe anything  <br/>
else? If school is unnecessary for learning, if school just exists  <br/>
and the kids would learn anyway, then all those people who&#39;ve  <br/>
dedicated their lives to education are wasting their time.<br/>
<br/>
That statement is too broad. Unschooling takes more than removing  <br/>
schools. It takes parents dedicated to their kids and helping them  <br/>
explore the world. Not every parent wants to or is in a position to.  <br/>
But unschoolers do know from experience that learning not only  <br/>
doesn&#39;t require schools, schools get in the way of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you see thinking<br/>
&gt; is no wonder, fish think, but critical thinking is one of the things<br/>
&gt; that truly separates even many people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I see is someone who is critical of what he&#39;s reading. That&#39;s  <br/>
not the same as critical thinking. Understanding something new often  <br/>
involves setting aside what we already believe to be true to see from  <br/>
a new point of view. To see from a new mountain top, you need to get  <br/>
down from your current mountain top. After examining everything from  <br/>
the new mountain top if you decide you like the old one better, you  <br/>
can always go back.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a Buddhist parable:<br/>
=================<br/>
When a Zen Master meets a new student, there is a tea ceremony. Tea  <br/>
is poured into the student�s small hand-held cup until he or she  <br/>
gives a small gesture to indicate �enough, thank you.�<br/>
<br/>
A long time ago there was a mind-full, accomplished, self-certain  <br/>
monk who arrived at a temple for training. The Master poured tea. The  <br/>
young monk gestured and gestured to stop pouring, but the Master kept  <br/>
pouring tea until the cup overflowed. Why?<br/>
<br/>
The Master explained, �When you arrived, your cup was already so  <br/>
full, there was no room for new. Empty your cup. . .�<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
As long as you continue to question from what you believe to be true,  <br/>
you&#39;re not going to be able to understand. You can&#39;t shout at us over  <br/>
on our mountain top that what we see isn&#39;t true unless you&#39;ve been to  <br/>
our mountain top. We&#39;ve already been to yours and have examined it  <br/>
top to bottom. Nearly every single one of us grew up over there. Many  <br/>
of us sent our children. We know yours. You don&#39;t know ours.<br/>

Funny, I never learned this in my Honors level Chemistry class.  I <br/>
actually learned the part about the toothpaste when I read <br/>
Faulkner&#39;s &quot;A Light in August&quot; which was totally unrelated to <br/>
anything in school.  I learned the part about the antifreeze from my <br/>
dad - who never took a chemistry course in his life. So your point <br/>
is...<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
all learning can be used by most people from every walk of life.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
I once learned to calculate the sum of two to the nth power as n <br/>
approaches infinity.  I find this a fun and amusing thing to do, but <br/>
I seriously doubt that more than a small percentage of the world&#39;s <br/>
population actually has need of that information.<br/>
<br/>
I once learned how to graph vector fields and solve differential <br/>
equations.  I would be very hard pressed to find five people on my <br/>
street who even know what diff eqs are much less use them in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Have you used any astrophysics lately?  I once learned a little of <br/>
that, too.<br/>
<br/>
How about brain surgery?  No, I haven&#39;t learned how to do that, and <br/>
at present I have no need to know.<br/>
<br/>
There is a vast amount of learning available in this universe that is <br/>
useful to only a select few people.<br/>
<br/>
ALL learning?  MOST people?  ALL walks of life?  That&#39;s just like <br/>
when my three year old says her brother is ALWAYS mean to her.  It&#39;s <br/>
just plain not true.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
am of the sense that my high school years and beyond is where i <br/>
really learned to critically think.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
And you think school is responsible for this?  Have you actually read <br/>
much Piaget lately?  Or any other prominent figure in the field of <br/>
cognitive development?  To sum up a few years of graduate level <br/>
cognitive development courses that I took while working on my <br/>
master&#39;s degree... The human brain changes qualitatively, not <br/>
quantitatively, during the course of it&#39;s development.  These changes <br/>
occur at specific age ranges.  Formal operations, the stage to which <br/>
you are refering, begins during adolescence.  It has nothing to do <br/>
with school level.  It has to do with biological maturity.  Only <br/>
about 30% of high school graduates actually achieve formal <br/>
operations.  If high school was responsible for critical thinking <br/>
skills, then 100% of high school graduates would achieve this level <br/>
of brain funtioning.  A child in a RU environment, where he is <br/>
challenged to think and make decisions for himself, is more likely to <br/>
reach formal operations than a child who is expected to do as he is <br/>
told all day long.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with correlation vs. causation.  Just because two things <br/>
happen at the same time doesn&#39;t mean one caused the other.  But, I <br/>
guess those statistics courses I took in college haven&#39;t been very <br/>
useful for you &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

I, too, have little patience for those who claim they are capable of <br/>
critical thinking, yet they can not write a gramatically correct <br/>
sentence.  Apparently grammar is NOT included as part of &quot;All <br/>
learning is useful to most people in every walk of life.&quot;  However, <br/>
we have to remember this is the same guy who thinks he knows how RU <br/>
