<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506241206">I just viewed the photos that are posted on the site. What beautiful <br/>
pictures.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that you all posted them. It is nice to see the faces of <br/>
other kids not in school. :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998247769">I posted some pictures of our last unschooling group potluck.  I think <br/>
the album is called &quot;North Idaho Unschoolers&quot;.  We tye-died T-shirts but <br/>
our kids all went crazy and decided to tye-dye themselves!  I am so so <br/>
lucky to have a group of friends up here who all unschool and are ok <br/>
with having their kids dyed bright red and green. <br/>
