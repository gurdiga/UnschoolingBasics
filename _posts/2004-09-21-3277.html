<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630207740">Hi robyn!<br/>
I think I know you! I was in Peabody and I think I sat beside you <br/>
during Anne&#39;s &quot;second rendition&quot; (were you wearing a silly hat?) I <br/>
am new to all of this and probably need to check the list more often <br/>
to get to know people better (I made the mistake of joining WAY too <br/>
many lists when I got back from MA!) Anyway, I was (am?) the <br/>
Canadian who was terrified. You were so nice to me.<br/>
Well, I was feeling really confused and overwhelmed today b/c I was <br/>
JUST starting to let go of some of my old fears around my boys and <br/>
the amount of tv/video, whatever they choose, and then I read Wendy <br/>
P&#39;s article about too much tv for kids, etc. I was SO flustered, and <br/>
then I picked up the next issue and there you were, standing up for <br/>
what I&#39;m TRYING to believe in! You were lovely and eloquent and <br/>
RIGHT ON, Sista!<br/>
So, thanks, I needed that.<br/>

Hi Sandy, glad you made it here!! Do try and read all you can at<br/>
www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling  There is a whole section about tv/videos<br/>
that is very comforting, as well as deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
BTW my letter was edited - the main point (from my pov) was left out - which<br/>
was that the article itself (and the study apparently) used much schoolish<br/>
language and reflected schoolish concerns like curriculums, milestones,<br/>
grades and subjects.<br/>
