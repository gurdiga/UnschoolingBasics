<br/>
Right.  So.  Here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading online recently about a woman who &quot;needed a break&quot; from her<br/>
kids.  Most responses to her post were shock, surprise, and in general not<br/>
really understanding why someone would NOT want to be with their kids.<br/>
There were a  couple of &quot;sure, I hear you.&quot;  And there were other issues<br/>
involved that I don&#39;t want to touch on here.  But I fully get this.  This is<br/>
an issue for me.  My kids DO wear me out, physically, emotionally, and<br/>
mentally.  And I&#39;m the one who goes to work during the week.  DW feels the<br/>
same way, only more so sometimes.  Most of the time things are fine.  But<br/>
sometimes we get really stressed, and when it happens to both of us at the<br/>
same time, then life is not good.  NOTE:  Some is baggage from my own<br/>
father, who came across to both me and bro that we were taking up his time.<br/>
So having that set up...<br/>
<br/>
I have three questions, but I&#39;ll put the big one up first.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do you EVER get to the point where you&#39;re NOT feeling this way?  If so,<br/>
HOW did you get there?  I&#39;m really interested in more than just &quot;keep<br/>
following unschooling/consensual living/&lt;insert buzzword here&gt; path.  More<br/>
information, please.  How did YOU get there?  Were you already there?  What<br/>
signs did you see?<br/>
<br/>
2.  What do you do to take a break, if you do?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Am I just making a mountain out of a molehill?<br/>

<br/>
I often wish we could follow the &quot;only one person gets to have a breakdown<br/>
at a time&quot; rule, but it just doesn&#39;t work that way, does it? The stressful<br/>
times hit both of us, here at least.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading &quot;stumbling into happiness&quot; and was struck by his<br/>
section on childbearing- it has changed the way I look at parenting and<br/>
happiness in general- mostly to the point where I am more willing to<br/>
question what causes me to feel happy, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am eager to read your responses, but wanted to throw out a quick practical<br/>
thing- I enjoy packing up a favorite book and going outside- it&#39;s a change<br/>
of pace for all of us, and I get to &quot;escape&quot; into a book. Generally, I feel<br/>
more refreshed if it isn&#39;t a parenting book, but sometimes a good parenting<br/>
book can also &quot;refresh&quot; me by giving me some new perspective.<br/>
<br/>
hth, looking forward to others ideas.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t perfect since I was perfectly capable of filling full days  <br/>
with writing or reading or other fun things before Kat was born. It&#39;s  <br/>
easier now since she&#39;s out of the house on her own more.<br/>
<br/>
While finding time to carve out &quot;me  time&quot; is important, I think even  <br/>
more important is becoming aware of the build up so you can take  <br/>
small breaks rather than letting yourself get to the breaking point  <br/>
where being alone for a week seems like the only cure ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329480088">Rob, you have YOUNG children.  They are, by nature, much much needier<br/>
than older children.<br/>
<br/>
And you have two close in age, with different enough needs, yet<br/>
similar enough level of needs, that it is even harder.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>
mountain out of a molehill -- but it is a common concern.<br/>
<br/>
I only have one child, now 15 3/4, so I didn&#39;t have it as intense as<br/>
you, but yes, there were times when I just needed down time.  Heck,<br/>
once, when he and I went to visit my folks w/out dh, about 20 minutes<br/>
after we were home again, dh said, &quot;I need a break from listening so<br/>
much!&quot;  (Our ds was a real talker!)  <br/>
<br/>
Things that helped me maintain some more sanity (though there are some<br/>
who would claim I have never had that!) were: play dates (I got some<br/>
adult-talk time while the kids played, and there were other adults to<br/>
help if intervention was needed), taking turns watching kids (play<br/>
dates w/out parent there, basically -- though I didn&#39;t do that often,<br/>
and only with those I really trusted), occasionally grandparents (they<br/>
lived far, though, so that was rare).  Take advantage of times when<br/>
the kids are amusing themselves helps, too.   And feel free to tell<br/>
your kids, &quot;I need a rest right now.  If there is an emergency, come<br/>
get me, but I&#39;m going to...&quot; (fill in the rest of that sentence as<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
And take heart - the older they get, the more independent they get! <br/>
Then you get to the point where you feel sad at the thought of them<br/>
moving on....  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, some of the conversations you have with your kids over the years<br/>
can be really thought-provoking and interesting.  I used to (jokingly)<br/>
threaten to hold my ds back a year, so I had an extra year before he<br/>
went to college.  But as it turns out, he had other ideas, and we are<br/>
making this our last year, and he starts college (locally) full-time<br/>
next year.  He told me, after I joked about holding him back, &quot;Much as<br/>
I love you guys, and love living with you, I want to get on with my<br/>
life.&quot;  Sigh, I know, dear, and that&#39;s as it should be.  Sniff! <br/>

<br/>
Why is it about being around your kids that is stressing you and your wife <br/>
out. Is it the noise level, the kids calling on you a lot, can you pin point <br/>
if it is certain things?<br/>
<br/>
I know it happens to me and my husband and was harder when they were little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>there?  What<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; signs did you see?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First it is &quot;normal&quot; to want to have time to get your own stuff done <br/>
or not to &quot;hear&quot; the kids or to go somewhere alone-- <br/>
<br/>
that being said if your mindset is that they kids should go away <br/>
while you have &quot;time&quot; it is going to be hard. Right now my 4.5 yr <br/>
old and 3 yr old are in the tub at 4:30 in the afternoon- while I <br/>
take a few minutes to &quot;myself&quot; to read e-mails- but my husband is <br/>
talking about military orders and my teenager came out to say he got <br/>
a new pet on wow- <br/>
<br/>
My husband used to say &quot;what about adult time&quot; and I said &quot; there is <br/>
not adult time but family time&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  What do you do to take a break, if you do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I take a book and read on the toliet<br/>
I take a few minutes to do what I want inbetween three million other <br/>
things they want from me<br/>
I stay up later to do what I want because I like sleeping in<br/>
If they agree I run to the store by myself<br/>
I get the kids all wore out so they fall asleep earlier<br/>
I tell myself that in so many years they will not want my attention <br/>
so much<br/>
I take advantage to when they want to go stay at grandma&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Am I just making a mountain out of a molehill?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes- no- maybe-<br/>
<br/>
take small breaks, realize they will not always be there, if they <br/>
were to die tomorrow would you regret the times you took a break to <br/>
be away from them, <br/>
<br/>
it is a mindset and you have to tell yourself that they are small <br/>
being that WANT to be around you- my girls have been following me <br/>
around (even to the bathroom but sometimes when it stinks they go <br/>
away for a while-- lol---- but I get 3 minutes of deep breathing and <br/>
peace) for a year and last night was the first time the little one <br/>
stayed home with dad. <br/>
<br/>
when you feel like you have had enough- take a break with them and <br/>
declare tickle time or chase time-- sometimes they want attention <br/>
and then after so many minutes they will paly alone to give you more <br/>
time alone doing your thing.<br/>

***If so, HOW did you get there?***<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is time.  Your kids will get older.   Part of it is not <br/>
waiting until you feel burned out before getting a break.  Part of it <br/>
is changing your perspective.  But it all gets easier as kids get <br/>
older.  And there is a little magic trick you can try.  Get some <br/>
exercise every day if you can.  Go for a bike ride, start running, <br/>
beat a punching bag...something.  I&#39;m not really fit, I&#39;m not a jock, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to be a life changing regimen to be mood changing.  <br/>
Maybe try some mood altering substance like magnesium or pasta or <br/>
light therapy.<br/>
<br/>
*** What do you do to take a break, if you do?***<br/>
 <br/>
I get up earlier than my kid.   I take long showers.   I do things I <br/>
enjoy every day.  (What do you love to do?)  If I&#39;m cranky or moody I <br/>
go into a room alone for five minutes and calm myself with breathing <br/>
or yoga and positive self talk.  Or I go out and bounce on the <br/>
trampoline.  It is impossible to be cranky while bouncing. &lt;g&gt;  I <br/>
take a walk almost every night - three or four miles- (usually with <br/>
my kid&lt;g&gt;)  and I find the dark big and peaceful and calming.  (and <br/>
full of bears, lately, and sometimes skunks.  Apparently I am calmed <br/>
by stinky critters.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Could you be depressed?  <br/>
Are you feeling stuck or trapped or like you have no choices?<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little and David was away a lot I would imagine he was <br/>
home with me.  It helped me be patient with little Dylan to imagine <br/>
there was a witness who held me in some regard.  How would you behave <br/>
with your children if someone you admired was right there in the room <br/>
with you?  Even if a little trick like that gets you through one <br/>
tough moment, that&#39;s a moment of sweetness with your kids that you <br/>
can gain strength from in the next tough moment.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has reminded people to hug their children and smell their <br/>
heads.  It can reconnect us with our kids in a primal kind of way <br/>
that makes us feel protective of them instead of crabby. <br/>
<br/>
My husband listens to music when he needs to recharge.  <br/>

<br/>
Some really good ideas here, a good number of which I hadn&#39;t thought of.<br/>
Nice to know I&#39;m not crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it never occurred to me to question that I needed an occasional<br/>
break until I read those series of messages (wish I could find them for<br/>
reference now).  So I needed a sanity-check, and get some more (better?)<br/>
tools for living through and mitigating my own stresses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542701127">Regarding the changing of outlooks, attitudes, or something like that...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen some changes in us, which I believe has translated to a more<br/>
respectful (and therefore peaceful) atmosphere here.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday or so, the girls were very needy.  Both of them.  My cup was full,<br/>
and DWs was near-empty, so she got sent to the office for some her time.<br/>
But anytime there was a fuss, a hurt, some kind of upset, (what I hope was)<br/>
loving attention was given repeatedly.  If something could be addressed<br/>
and/or rectified respectfully, then it was.  They were given a lot of<br/>
latitude to do what they wanted, all that.  By the time they were ready for<br/>
bed, they seemed to have mellowed out a good bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to remember that Tuesday, b/c it was one of the &quot;yes it could have<br/>
been bad but it wound up really good.&quot;  It was as if I just kept throwing<br/>
love at them and they ate it up until they felt safe.  But my cup was full<br/>
when I got home, and keeping it full is the real goal for me.  If I can do<br/>
that, evenings like that can happen more often.<br/>

<br/>
:: Infinite Love ::<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows 1+1=2. But what is infinity plus one?<br/>
It&#39;s still infinity! In other words, infinity doesn&#39;t<br/>
play by the rules of simple math.<br/>
<br/>
To love *unconditionally*, you have to play the<br/>
infinity game. You have to transcend the zero-sum game<br/>
that says love is scarce.<br/>
<br/>
You have to question the belief that every time you<br/>
give love to your child, *less* love is available to<br/>
your other child... or your partner... or yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Today, practice remembering your connection to<br/>
Infinite Love. Every time you give from that Love,<br/>
imagine your &quot;Love Account&quot; balance becoming Infinity<br/>
minus one, which is still Infinity!<br/>
<br/>
When you drop the belief that love is a scarce -- that<br/>
it must be divided &quot;fairly&quot; between family members --<br/>
and you just follow your heart instead, you&#39;ll begin<br/>
to *experience* that Love really IS infinite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109597019">~~  So I needed a sanity-check, and get some more (better?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tools for living through and mitigating my own stresses.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I  think it&#39;s really easy for all of us to share the joyful moments<br/>
here at the lists and somehow create the illusion that stressful<br/>
moments and learning-takes (also called mistakes) don&#39;t happen.<br/>
Honestly, when I read someone describing their child&#39;s life and saying<br/>
how that child was ALWAYS respected or ALWAYS anything, I question<br/>
their memory!:)<br/>
<br/>
I need breaks. I need breaks from PEOPLE. My dream is to have a cabin<br/>
in the woods like Thoreau and go spend a weekend writing and drinking<br/>
tea all by myself.:) Dreamy eh?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not going to happen just yet. I already spend time away from my<br/>
family to provide an income. Every bit of time I&#39;m off, I want to<br/>
connect with them. I get online when dh is playing a fierce game of<br/>
Monopoly (hurts my brain) with them, or when everyone is asleep. Going<br/>
to a conference here and there is even being questioned at this point,<br/>
because I want my family with me.<br/>
<br/>
So.....yeah, we need breaks. I feel that you summed it up nicely<br/>
above. We are the adults with more tools and experience, hence it is<br/>
OUR responsibility to fill the proverbial cup BEFORE stresses happen<br/>
so we are better equipped when things start to disintegrate.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in the mornings I have a little conversation with<br/>
myself...stating how I want to BE that day. &quot;I respond with love and<br/>
kindness. I connect with my child&#39;s needs. I am calm and patient.&quot;<br/>
etc.....<br/>
<br/>
We all have different tools. It&#39;s important to find ways to nourish<br/>
the calm, beautiful and powerful center in ourselves so we can better<br/>
share it with our children....and the world.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558869111">Robert, <br/>
   My husband has some of the same baggage as far as sort of feeling<br/>
in the way or like he owed his father something just for being there<br/>
etc so he sometimes has a more difficult time dealing with the noise,<br/>
chaos, constant needs that children have.    The biggest thing that<br/>
has helped is during those times when we are both spent each of us<br/>
consciously tries to take up the slack of the other... if he is<br/>
getting frustrated I try to have more patience if I am blowing my top<br/>
he tries to step in and take the weight off.   It&#39;s a dance really!  <br/>
<br/>
To answer your other questions.... I have four kids ages 17, 14, 12<br/>
and 6.... as the kids get older and are able to step in and help with<br/>
the younger kids I have felt less overwhelmed.    Your kids are little<br/>
and believe me it&#39;s lasts for such a short time so don&#39;t wish them<br/>
big!    It does get easier when you change your thinking gradually...<br/>
demands become needs (mindset starting off is that your child is<br/>
demanding this or that...eventually you see they are expressing a need<br/>
and you are looking for a way to meet that need)  you begin to spend<br/>
more time listening to what your child is really saying rather than<br/>
what is coming out of their mouth (there are many ways of speaking,<br/>
watch your child&#39;s eyes and body language is the ice cream really what<br/>
the issue is or are they asking for YOU and YOUR attention?<br/>
--hypothetical ice cream my example!)    You also begin to understand<br/>
how to be more honest with your children... I do tell my children that<br/>
I need a break, I do tell them no (not knee jerk no but when<br/>
circumstances just won&#39;t allow something...no money, no time other<br/>
people&#39;s rules etc)  but I try to help them to do or get the things<br/>
they want.   I think it would be a disservice to never let your child<br/>
know you are sad, tired, or whatever... don&#39;t use your feelings as a<br/>
club but being open and honest.... saying &quot;you know I really would<br/>
love to play legos with you but for 10 minutes Daddy really needs to<br/>
sit quietly and recharge&quot;   that&#39;s being honest and communicating your<br/>
needs as well.... it&#39;s much better than playing legos and resenting it<br/>
or being half hearted about it (no one likes a half hearted lego<br/>
Daddy!)   I do have days when I am exhausted and my 6 yr old demands<br/>
more than I feel up to doing ...there are days when I handle it well<br/>
and others when I have to negotiate alot to meet his needs and my own.<br/>
  It really comes down to changing your thinking about what your child<br/>
is asking for.    Consensual living is not just about kids getting all<br/>
of their needs met... it&#39;s about everyone in the family having their<br/>
needs met.    I heard a speaker at a conference once speak about this<br/>
type of thing (not an unschooling conference so it was from a<br/>
different &quot;place&quot; than most of us are but relevant all the same!) <br/>
Anyway the title of her workshop was something along the lines of<br/>
&quot;Putting on your own Oxygen mask first!&quot;    While I don&#39;t put my needs<br/>
ahead of my children&#39;s needs I do consider them in the scheme of my<br/>
life..... I am no good if I just do and do and do for everyone else<br/>
and never take care of me.   I read before bed.... sometimes that is<br/>
at a decent hour but some nights it&#39;s not because everyone was up<br/>
really late but I still do it because it feeds my need to relax and<br/>
recharge.   My husband is a napper... he works weird hours so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get enough sleep most of the time because he wants to spend<br/>
time with the family (he works from 3 am until around noon so instead<br/>
of going to bed early he hangs out with us until 10or 11pm)  A lot of<br/>
afternoons he comes in and really needs a nap... so he will make a<br/>
deal with the kids if they want him to do something ...he gets his nap<br/>
and at a certain time they can wake him up to do what they wanted to<br/>
do.   They are good about respecting his need for rest because they<br/>
know he will play when he is rested.   There are times when our 6 yr<br/>
old really doesn&#39;t want to wait so they make a deal that he will play<br/>
for a while and then take a nap.   Anyway because he is honest with<br/>
them about this need they don&#39;t bother him while he is napping.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a process... all of it... some days I think I am highly evolved<br/>
and then some days I hear myself snapping at some child to be quiet<br/>
because I am tired or overwhelmed and not handling it well.   I feel<br/>
like an idiot on those days but almost always I realize I am ignoring<br/>
MY needs too much.  If I take a break and get some quiet I am always<br/>
much better!  <br/>
<br/>
I think the fact that you are being honest about having baggage (you<br/>
can&#39;t change something you don&#39;t acknowledge!)  and honest about<br/>
having days when you feel overdone is a great step to examining what<br/>
you can change to make everything happier for everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
It does get easier as the kids get older and learn that their needs<br/>
will be met and get a little less intense about their needs (some kids<br/>
never lose this intensity so just know you might have one or even two<br/>
of those so you will have to figure out what will work for your family<br/>
if that is the case!) <br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256194654">Hi Rob, new here so I feel like I am butting in, but my husband and I <br/>
worked out a way to get time out for us if necessary without causing <br/>
problems for my son.<br/>
<br/>
My son can be difficult to deal with at times, simply because he is very <br/>
needy emotionally. That&#39;s fine most of the time but it can often feel <br/>
like I have more than one child at a time. I actually have two, but they <br/>
were really spread out, so it is like I have two only children if that <br/>
makes sense. My husband has two from a previous marriage, but they were <br/>
13 and 11 when my daughter and I came into the relationship when she was <br/>
2 years. Then when my son was born (the only child between my husband <br/>
and myself) my daughter was 12 and his kids were full grown with their <br/>
own families. Now my son is 11 (nearly 12) and my daughter is full <br/>
grown, though still living with us.<br/>
<br/>
Caleb has always been incredibly emotional as he has early onset bipolar <br/>
disorder. However I am also bipolar, my husband has problems with <br/>
depression, and my daughter is also bipolar so the emotions in this <br/>
house can run pretty high at times. Sometimes in order to keep the <br/>
sanity, one of us needs a time out. My husband and I have a running <br/>
agreement that if one of us gets stressed out, we get time to be on our <br/>
own. I have to have that time as it can be highly unhealthy if I don&#39;t. <br/>
Being an artist, I will basically go into my studio and turn on the <br/>
music and take time for myself for an hour or several and just create, <br/>
until I feel like I can be with Caleb again and be a loving, caring <br/>
adult. During that time, my husband takes over, and keeps him occupied. <br/>
Caleb doesn&#39;t feel this is me being neglectful of him, because he gets <br/>
alone time with Dad at that point, I get some sanity time, and the same <br/>
goes for my husband if he needs time out.<br/>
<br/>
I used to do this more often years ago, but now that Caleb is older, he <br/>
is spending more time doing his own thing. He goes to visit his friends <br/>
in he neighborhood, is outside playing, or has other friends over that <br/>
keeps him occupied. It does get MUCH easier as they get older. I <br/>
actually feel a bit left out now that he doesn&#39;t need me as much <br/>
anymore, but I know that this is just a part of growing up. Once we <br/>
start unschooling we will have plenty of together time once again, <br/>
because there won&#39;t be time at school and time with friends, it will be <br/>
time with me and time with friends.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a good time to sit down with your wife, and offer time out <br/>
for her and ask for a bit of time out for yourself when you need it as <br/>
well. These can be made special times for the kids as well.  I know that <br/>
  you may want more time alone together with your wife, but these short <br/>
time outs with everyone&#39;s blessing can be a lifesaver as well. If there <br/>
is something special that your kids love to do, make that the special <br/>
time to spend with Dad while mom takes a break, or vice-versa. Then the <br/>
kids might look forward to those times just as much as each of you do!<br/>
<br/>
It may be as simple as being able to go to the store alone, or to go for <br/>
a walk for a while to regroup, or go into another room and read, do <br/>
exercises, or whatever floats your boat. They have been a mental and <br/>
emotional lifesaver for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Julie<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This is a cross-post, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be many duplicates.  Sorry<br/>
&gt; if this nails you twice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right.  So.  Here goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was reading online recently about a woman who &quot;needed a break&quot; from her<br/>
&gt; kids.  Most responses to her post were shock, surprise, and in general not<br/>
&gt; really understanding why someone would NOT want to be with their kids.<br/>
&gt; There were a  couple of &quot;sure, I hear you.&quot;  And there were other issues<br/>
&gt; involved that I don&#39;t want to touch on here.  But I fully get this.  This is<br/>
&gt; an issue for me.  My kids DO wear me out, physically, emotionally, and<br/>
&gt; mentally.  And I&#39;m the one who goes to work during the week.  DW feels the<br/>
&gt; same way, only more so sometimes.  Most of the time things are fine.  But<br/>
&gt; sometimes we get really stressed, and when it happens to both of us at the<br/>
&gt; same time, then life is not good.  NOTE:  Some is baggage from my own<br/>

&gt; So having that set up...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have three questions, but I&#39;ll put the big one up first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Do you EVER get to the point where you&#39;re NOT feeling this way?  If so,<br/>
&gt; HOW did you get there?  I&#39;m really interested in more than just &quot;keep<br/>
&gt; following unschooling/consensual living/&lt;insert buzzword here&gt; path.  More<br/>
&gt; information, please.  How did YOU get there?  Were you already there?  What<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802972091">Hi Rob,<br/>
<br/>
I have one very interactive 7 1/2 year old.  He likes to be involved  <br/>
w/ doing things w/ me or someone lots of the time.  We go do things,  <br/>
we have play dates but the thing that has helped the most to get some  <br/>
time for myself is I put out a message on our unschoolers group. I  <br/>
asked whether there was a young person who would like to be a  <br/>
mother&#39;s helper.  What we found was a lovely 11 year old girl who  <br/>
likes playing w/ Asher. I&#39;m always home and it&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve  <br/>
got the day off.  But enough so that I can have some time to do  <br/>
things I need or do nothing in particular (actually that seems to be  <br/>
more likely than actually getting stuff done!) That might be harder  <br/>
w/ 2 younger kids but it could still help I think if you can find the  <br/>
right person.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a stressful year for me and having that time has been  <br/>
really helpful.  And doesn&#39;t break the bank!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of COURSE small doses are not acceptable!  ;-)  Well, okay, but only<br/>
if you have a medical condition... got a doctor&#39;s note, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My theory is that people long ago had such short life expectancies<br/>
(okay, I know, infant mortality reduced the average a lot, but they<br/>
were still less likely to live as long as now) because they had no<br/>
chocolate.  No reason to live.<br/>

<br/>
OKAY LOL Large doses (but the &#39;studies&#39; all say to not overdo it because<br/>
of the sugar and calories involved). <br/>
 <br/>
Not to mention that chocolate is connected to everything in the world!<br/>

Sorry I never answered this one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is it about being around your kids that is stressing you and your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wife out?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they both really demand attention NOW and CONSTANTLY or life is<br/>
bad.  I need to drop what I&#39;m doing immediately (sometimes before I even get<br/>
inside the house from work) and keep on being with them.<br/>
<br/>
I really try to, but it&#39;s when they tag-team me that just sends me.<br/>
dd1: &quot;Daddy, would you do this?&quot;<br/>
Me:  &quot;Sure...&quot;<br/>
dd1: &quot;OK, now do this<br/>
dd2: &quot;Daddy, come here!&quot; (from the other room)<br/>
Back and forth, back and forth, I&#39;m a yo-yo and it gets faster and faster<br/>
until they&#39;re both talking on top of each other trying to get my attention<br/>
and be with them, individually.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
So, they&#39;re competing for my attention.  They also do this with DW.  Each<br/>
girl by themselves is really wonderful to be around.  But sometimes when<br/>
they&#39;re together, it&#39;s constant vying for and demanding attention.  Scarcity<br/>
of resources.  One-upsmanship?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how to address this one now, will have to thnk on it some more.<br/>
Good question, thank you.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047418172">Wow!  You people are fantastic!  Thanks for all the input, I&#39;ve got loads to<br/>
go through.  Since there was so much stuff here, I thought I&#39;d summarize all<br/>
the wonderful answers that were shared.  A number of them were repeated, so<br/>
there are definitely some common tools that work for a lot of us.  There<br/>
were also some very creative answers.  Once again, thank you all.<br/>
<br/>
Here you&#39;ll find some of your stuff quoted, a lot paraphrased.  I tried to<br/>
break up the answers based on the questions originally asked so that it<br/>
would make sense.  Hope y&#39;all find this helpful.<br/>
<br/>
--Rob<br/>
<br/>
Q1. Do you EVER get to the point where you&#39;re NOT feeling this way?<br/>
A1:  As they get older and need less<br/>
A2:  It&#39;s normal to need some down-time.<br/>
A3:  The desire is normal, and take the time where you can.  But &quot;there is<br/>
not adult time but family time.&quot;<br/>
A4:  Sometimes.  It&#39;s several pieces of a puzzle.  Kids will get older.<br/>
Don&#39;t wait until you&#39;re burned out before getting a break.  Change your<br/>
perspective.<br/>
A5:  Changing perspectives:  have a conversation with myself...stating how I<br/>
want to BE that day.<br/>
A6:  Changing perspectives:  children are not &quot;demanding this or that...&quot;<br/>
they are expressing a need and you are looking for a way to meet that need.<br/>
You begin...listening to what your child is really saying rather than what<br/>
is coming out of their mouth.&quot;<br/>
A7:  Changing perspectives:  Tell self that in so many years, they will not<br/>
want my attention so much<br/>
A8:  Changing perspectives:  Smell your kids&#39; heads.  Connect in a primal<br/>
kind of way with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Q2. What do you do to take a break, if you do?<br/>
a. Carve out &quot;me&quot; time (NOTE: There are LOTS of examples of this, I just had<br/>
to put them all in here.)<br/>
b.  Get up early<br/>
c.  Martial Arts classes<br/>
d.  Computer games<br/>
e.  non-child movies on weekends while spouse takes a shift<br/>
f. Read a book<br/>
g.  Read a book on the toilet<br/>
h.  Do what I want in-between the 3 million things they want fro mme<br/>
i.  Stay up later<br/>
j.  If they agree, run to the story by myself<br/>
k.  Get the kids all worn out so they&#39;ll fall asleep earlier<br/>
l.  Exercise every day if you can...it doesn&#39;t have to be a life-changing<br/>
regimen to be mood changing.  Maybe try some mood-altering substance like<br/>
magnesium or pasta or light therapy.<br/>
m.  Take advantage of when they want to stay and grandma&#39;s<br/>
n.  Take a break WITH them.  Declare tickle or chase time.  After so many<br/>
minutes they will play alone to give you more time alone doing your thing.<br/>
j.  Take long showers.<br/>
k.  If I&#39;m cranky...go into a room alone for five minutes and calm myslef<br/>
with breathing or yoga and positive self-talk.<br/>
l.  Bounce on the trampoline.<br/>
m: Become aware of the stress build-up and take breaks early on so as not to<br/>
explode later.<br/>
n: Play dates<br/>
o: Take advantage of times when kids amuse themselves<br/>
p: &quot;I need a rest right now.  If there&#39;s an emergency, come get me...&quot;<br/>
q: Imagine there was a witness who held me in some regard (what to do when<br/>
it&#39;s tough)<br/>
r: Listen to music<br/>
s: Put on a movie.<br/>
t: You and spouse consciously try to take up the slack for the other when<br/>
they&#39;re feeling the stress.  &quot;It&#39;s a dance really!&quot;<br/>
u: Alternate weekend activities with spouse to let the other one do stuff<br/>
(usually un-fun stuff, but solo stuff nonetheless).<br/>
v:  &quot;...I put out a message on our unschoolers group.  I asked whether there<br/>
was a young person who would like to be a mother&#39;s helper...&quot;<br/>
w:  &quot;...if one of us gets stressed out, we get time to be on our own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Q3: Am I just making a mountain out of a molehill?<br/>
A1: No.<br/>
A2: Yes- No- Maybe-.  If they died tomorrow you&#39;d regret the many times you<br/>
took a break from them.  They are small, and they WANT to be around you.<br/>
A3: Maybe.  Depends on who you are.  But if you don&#39;t do some self-checking,<br/>
you could be headed for a big crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Other Comments:<br/>
1. Scott Noelle&#39;s web site and &quot;Daily Groove emails.  www.enjoyparenting.com<br/>
2. Regarding a shift in attitude:  Drop the belief that love is a zero-sum<br/>
game, that love is a scarce resource.  Love really IS infinite.  See whole<br/>
post at www.enjoyparenting.com/infinite-love<br/>
3. Consensual living is not just about kids getting all of their needs<br/>
met...it&#39;s about everyone in the family having their needs met.<br/>
4. It&#39;s a process...all of it... some days I think I am highly evolved and<br/>
then some days I hear myself snapping at some child to be quiet...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230123117">Update to the list of answers.  GMail doesn&#39;t always group conversations<br/>
together properly.<br/>
<br/>
Q2. What do you do to take a break, if you do?<br/>
a.  &quot;We have a peaceful chair...a chair that anyone can go to and take a<br/>
time out if they need some space.&quot;<br/>
b.  &quot;Sometimes removing myself from the situation isn&#39;t the answer but<br/>
rather engaging more with the kiddos is.&quot;<br/>
c.  CHOCOLATE, and LOTS of it!  Not only is it a mind-altering food, it<br/>
keeps the dementors away.  (I just LOVE this one!)<br/>
