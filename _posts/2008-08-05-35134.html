<div id="ygrps-yiv-570166917">I think that many of us are our children&#39;s best ally.  And for me  <br/>
that means that when I see them being mistreated I have to find a  <br/>
way, often a creative one, to be on their side.  And many times it  <br/>
means finding a way to remove them from the situation.  When people  <br/>
make snide comments about my children&#39;s hair, their clothes, their  <br/>
love for the computer, their outspoken language, whatever, it is  <br/>
usually a good time to skillfully try to change the subject or if  <br/>
they are persistent with the comments then to leave the place.<br/>
There are some gender differences for sure.  Usually being an ally to  <br/>
my son means finding ways to support him expressing his emotions -  <br/>
especially crying.  And that includes encouraging other boys to feel  <br/>
their feelings and express them.  He is always hearing - you are too  <br/>
old (eg to co-sleep - he is 8 1/2), you have to control yourself  <br/>
(when he cries deeply), and you have to learn to face the real  <br/>
world.  And for my daughter being an ally usually means standing up  <br/>
for her when people say she &#39;can&#39;t&#39;.  She is always hearing - you are  <br/>
too young, you won&#39;t understand, are you sure she&#39;s able to (the last  <br/>
one addressed to me in front of her).<br/>
So stand up for your child the way that you seem to be doing.  There  <br/>
will be constant challenges to your confidence and once in a while it  <br/>
is so wonderful when your children let you know how much they are  <br/>
aware that they can count on you to be on their side.<br/>
