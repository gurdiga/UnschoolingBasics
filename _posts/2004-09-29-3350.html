<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188068739">Hey Dear Readers: <br/>
for those of you that attended the recent Live and Learn Conf,  I am referring to Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s article in our attendee&#39;s binder entitled: &quot;The Three Stages of Unschooling&quot; Stage 1. To reference my thoughts, here is part of Kelly&#39;s writing:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are NOT taught in any grade, Middle or HIgh School *!* know of. But I wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons and dog obedience classes, They paid for dog and horse shows and equipment..........&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Now Kelly, as a child, was &quot;bold&quot; (bold may not be the proper  nference here!) enough to ask, mention or suggest to her parents , her interests. and they responded. But what if you have a child ( maybe a really shy one in the family)  who may not want to &quot;bother &quot; his parents with his needs (maybe really feel not worthy to deserve them) or just afraid to ask, for feeling that he may be rejected,,,,,, Some kids are truly gifted to be frugal and may not see the need or feel the need to buy things for just themselves. They may be thinking that spending the money on themselves is/would be a waste of money. <br/>
How do you go about telling a child that it is OK to think about their personal wants as not being selfish, self-centered or such.? And let the child to gradually see that their wants are important too! <br/>

PS maybe Kelly was raised as an only child !!<br/>

 <br/>
&lt;g&gt; I only WANTED to be an only child----and I acted as if I were!  &lt;G&gt; Still <br/>
do.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re assuming a lot, Colleen!<br/>
 <br/>
I dreamed about horses. I talked incessantly about them. I drew them. I  read <br/>
about them---fiction and non-fiction. I pretended to BE one----but I never  <br/>
asked. Horses are expensive----and I knew that. Keeping a horse is even MORE  <br/>
expensive----cheapest thing about a horse is the horse itself! &lt;G&gt; I  also knew <br/>
that money doesn&#39;t grow on trees. I never asked.<br/>
 <br/>
One day, Daddy took me out into the car (only quiet place) and said that I  <br/>
was now 13 and would soon be &quot;discovering boys.&quot; He thought I should be able to <br/>
 pursue this horse passion before I got &quot;boy-crazy&quot; ,so he thought now was <br/>
the  time to buy me a horse! <br/>
 <br/>
HUH? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It didn&#39;t take long to locate Bullet, my first horse!<br/>
 <br/>
I tell my kids that their happiness is very important  and that I&#39;m willing <br/>
to go without a few things in order to help them find  their passions. I do <br/>
that every day. Most of our $$ right now goes  towards &quot;education&quot;---and since <br/>
our &quot;educational plan&quot; involves finding  their passions, well....it&#39;s pretty <br/>
easy to do that! &lt;G&gt; And  to justify it! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Does he have NO passions? Hell, I&#39;d just BUY it---whether he thinks he&#39;s  <br/>
worth it or not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
By treating that child as though they are important and by modeling &quot;taking care of your needs&quot; for your child.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the child may not be interested in buying things for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m not a big fan of presents for me.  I don&#39;t want flowers or cards or jewelry or any of that kind of stuff.  When I buy something it is usually for some family project but it makes me happy.  When presents are &quot;required&quot;, I usually ask for something to go with one of these projects.  (Dh is secretly thrilled but has trouble explaining to his co-workers that I really did want an egg incubator for our anniversary.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your child is more interested in time, &quot;elbow room&quot;, activities, etc., rather than things?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598713642">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And the boy crazy thang never came. Horses lasted for YEARS!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I knew a family once that absolutely lived horses.  They went without many things so the kids could ride and show.  The mom told me once that was her &quot;discipline plan&quot; (to use the term extremely loosely).  She said as long as she allowed her kids to be &quot;knee-deep in manure&quot; there were no serious problems with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
People have a tremendous amount of physical, mental and spiritual energy.  I think when kids get to follow their passions wherever that may lead it allows them to focus all of that into something positive.  <br/>
<br/>
The energy is going to go somewhere....it will probably be best if it goes into something you love.<br/>

Cameron sadly told me yesterday that every one of his friends is on  <br/>
probation. They&#39;re all also in school. <br/>
 <br/>
His passions keep Cameron busy enough and focussed enough and engaged  enough <br/>
to keep out of &#39;trouble&#39;. His friends have nothing to engage them----it&#39;s  as <br/>
if they&#39;re *looking* for trouble. And boy, do they plop right down into it!  <br/>
They&#39;re all good, sweet kids----they really are. Just lost and without  <br/>
passion.<br/>
