I&#39;m in MA as well.   What town are you in?  (we&#39;re in No Reading).  <br/>
Have you read the ahem.info site thoroughly?   You don&#39;t need to <br/>
provide a &quot;curriculum&quot; per se, you just have to state that you will <br/>
cover all the subjects (history, math, etc).   They cannot tell you <br/>
HOW to do it.  Plus we have 3 forms of assessment to choose from, <br/>
this has to be MUTUALLY agreed upon between the school (or whoever <br/>
you go through in your particular town) and the parents; a <br/>
standardized test, portfolio of dated work samples OR a narrative <br/>
report, you only have to provide ONE.  If they don&#39;t like what you <br/>
have chosen, the burden of proof rests with them.<br/>
<br/>
Are you on the masshomelearningassoc yahoo group?   They&#39;re more <br/>
traditionally oriented, but they&#39;ve been helpful this first year for <br/>
us in getting established and dealing with the &quot;legalities&quot;.   If <br/>
you state where you live there, you can hopefully find others in the <br/>
same town that can give you some idea how it is to deal with the <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>

HOTBED of unschooling! Many of our regular posters are from MA!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---that patience is something else! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What else you might want to try: reading back in the archives. Almost <br/>
every question asked has been asked and answered before. Just go read <br/>
starting from the beginning of this list. You will read for weeks! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

Hi Tammy,<br/>
I see that you ARE on the mhla group!   Should have checked first!  <br/>
Are you looking for help on how to report as an unschooler?   Have you <br/>
seen what Carol Narigon uses (on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site)?   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re submitting a narrative/progress report and I&#39;m keeping it <br/>
simple, a paragraph for each &quot;subject&quot; (because the SCHOOL thinks in <br/>
subjects!) and list of books read, field trips, concerts and arts <br/>
events, etc.  I&#39;m also sending in my LOI for next school year at the <br/>
same time.   This is my dd&#39;s first year out of school (13, 7th <br/>
grade).  We had no problem getting the &quot;OK&quot; but this will be our first <br/>
end of year report so I&#39;m not sure how it will go (but they DID <br/>
approve my choice of narrative/progress report, so I&#39;m expecting it to <br/>
be fine!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423142240">I have a similar problem. In my state (Swiss state, MUCH smaller <br/>
than yours ;p), homeschoolers are tested once a year to check if <br/>
they keep up with the public school curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
I talked to one of the inspectors, they seem quite nice and <br/>
understanding, but they still want the parents to comply to a <br/>
certain plan. I don&#39;t see how I could unschool and meet up their <br/>
standards - it seems that I can&#39;t avoid a certain amount of school <br/>
at home ... I&#39;m a bit worried with that.<br/>
<br/>
I know that my son is amazing with these kinds of worries (for <br/>
instance, IF not influenced by me or anyone, he&#39;s perfectly able to <br/>
decide to learn how to read the week before the test, it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
the first time). I also plan to discuss a lot with the inspectors.<br/>
<br/>
But still ... Is there anything you could tell me to tranquilize me ?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>
Helen<br/>
