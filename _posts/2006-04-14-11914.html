your older child without sacrificing naptimes. My 16 month old takes two naps a  <br/>

When babies are young I wear them on my front but after they become to  <br/>
big/heavy for front carries I switch to my back. Baby is happy  <br/>
(carried/sleeping/watching) and the older ones are also having fun exploring  without being <br/>

Thanks for the suggestion. I wore him in a sling alot while he was<br/>
little. When that got uncomfortable, I got a mei tei. I really like it<br/>
but I&#39;ve not had much success getting him to sleep in it. Maybe I just<br/>
haven&#39;t given it enough chances. I have also heard good things before<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What kinds of things does he want to do? Maybe you could arrange for regular special outings with Connor while someone watches James. When you&#39;re at home during nap time on the other days, make that a special Connor time as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so hard to believe, but this time will pass so quickly. My &quot;baby&quot; is 12 now. How the heck did that happen?!<br/>

only -- is 14, and I am having such a hard time accepting how fast he <br/>
is getting older.  On the plus side, he still looks 12 -- no growth <br/>
spurt yet!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191994957">**The problem with this is that I have a one year old in addition to my 10 yr <br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to do lots of things that are hard to do with a toddler.**<br/>
<br/>
I can sympathize. I remember living and learning with a pair of one year <br/>
olds, a 9 year old, and a 15 year old. Lots of conflicting needs and very little <br/>
convergence of desires!<br/>
<br/>
When my twins were toddlers, we time shifted what we could. When my husband <br/>
got home from work I&#39;d take the older kids to the library or whatever <br/>
businesses they wanted to go to. We also did way more things on the weekends than I&#39;d <br/>
have wished, not enjoying the weekend crowds. :)<br/>
<br/>
**We live in a rural area and by the time we drive where he wants to go and<br/>
<br/>
browse around for a bit, it&#39;s time for James&#39; nap (he still takes 2<br/>
<br/>
2-hr naps a day). And when we sacrifice the nap to do fun stuff, James<br/>
<br/>
is miserable for the evening.**<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really tough. Will he sleep in the car? Any chance of napping in a <br/>
stroller? If you&#39;re not already slinging him it might be hard to start, but it <br/>
would be worth trying - I know quite a few toddlers who nap well in a sling. If <br/>
he&#39;ll sleep in the car, any chance of hiring an older homeschooler to sit with <br/>
him while he sleeps while you browse with Connor? That way he could be safe <br/>
napping in the car and if he woke you&#39;d be available. Any friends in town you <br/>
could visit for nap time, and if so would the little one settle down there into <br/>
a nap?<br/>
