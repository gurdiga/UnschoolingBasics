<div id="ygrps-yiv-762481414">OH NO...it is really not that bad, it seems over whelming, but we sent in two pages, very <br/>
general, and I think Ellen, you are making this harder than it needs to be.  LOOK at the unit <br/>
studies pages.  And remember you are unschooling, you can&#39;t write a specific curriculum and <br/>
expect your child to follow it, to the letter or at all.  My 8 yr old daughter and I sat down and <br/>
brainstormed topics she THOUGHT she MIGHT be interested in.  Then I wrote &quot;possible&quot; ways <br/>
to cover them.  Nothing is written in stone. Melanie in VT</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168124991">Hi Melanie - I don&#39;t have a Unit Studies page.... I got the &quot;Guidelines for Home Study in Vermont&quot; dated 8/23/2005 and a Vermont Home Study Newsletter 2005-2006 with the appropriate forms to fill out.  Can you give me an idea of what it says or where I&#39;d find it?<br/>
