<div id="ygrps-yiv-553151511">I&#39;m sure this is a redundant question given the nature of our lifestyles....but do you *sometimes* (LOL) feel alone in this?<br/>
   <br/>
  I was talking to my mother last night to see if Safiya and Dakari could come and stay with her for a while.  Just to get them out of this stress that we&#39;ve been living in.  Now I understand that my mom has dr&#39;s appointments and such - that&#39;s understandable.  The kicker was when she said &quot;I can only keep them for a week or so.  I can&#39;t homeschool for a long period of time.  Are the schools there better than where you were before?&quot;  UGH!!!!!!  My response: &quot;I&#39;m not sending them to school for a babysitter, mom.  And that&#39;s what it would be.  And no, the schools here aren&#39;t better than where we were.&quot;   UGHHH!!!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  She *still* doesn&#39;t get that I&#39;m homeschool.  She definitely wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling.  To her it would just look like I&#39;m a negligent parent.  That&#39;s when it really hit me: she just doesn&#39;t get it.  None of my family does, and they probably won&#39;t.  And I felt soooo sad....and jealous of those of you who at least have a sibling that understands!  LOL.  My younger sister is a teacher and doesn&#39;t get it.  My younger brother...well....I think he would understand the concept, though he wouldn&#39;t get how it really works.<br/>
   <br/>
  I feel like it&#39;s me (and sometimes hubby when he&#39;s really on board) against the world.  My kids are chided for skipping, running, talking to loudly in my sil&#39;s house.  It&#39;s like they must be &quot;seen and not heard&quot;.  Khalid, my spirited almost 4 year old gets the brunt of the stress, I think.  He&#39;s trying to still be the baby like Khidar (who will be 2), and my mil and sil don&#39;t seem to get that.  He&#39;s not doing stuff &quot;on purpose&quot; to be disrespectful.  My mil and sil are *big* into that old-school parenting stuff of listening to an adult just because they are an adult.  UGH!!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry....I&#39;m just venting here because right now I want to go run away with my kids and dh and go homestead somewhere!  LOL<br/>

place of your own? I&#39;m sure that would help tremendously. <br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re living with your sister-in-law, try to take your kids out <br/>
of the house as much as possible, even just to hang out in a park. Can <br/>
you enroll them in some fun classes, like karate or dance, maybe <br/>
something where they could use up some energy and have fun at the same <br/>
time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683951869">I found it was much harder to feel confident in my parenting when my <br/>
neighbors were staying in my home for a couple months. They are <br/>
wonderful people and &quot;theoretically&quot; like the idea of unschooling, but <br/>
the day to day details were new and overwhelming to them. I got a lot <br/>
of quiet disapproval. George was affected a lot by that and started to <br/>
fall back on a lot more &quot;traditional&quot; parenting techniques. I felt <br/>
like my parenting was being challenged all the time from every angle <br/>
and that was really hard. Yuk.<br/>
<br/>
Being in someone else&#39;s home with your kids must be even harder, <br/>
especially if things are still up in the air and you don&#39;t know how <br/>
much longer y&#39;all will be there. Having a regular schedule was helpful <br/>
for *us* - just knowing *when* I was going to have to be more <br/>
proactive and direct with Mo and when I would be able to relax helped <br/>
me both to ration my energy and to adjust my expectations. It also <br/>
helped me to remind myself that it wouldn&#39;t be forever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655010830">Oh, Sweetie. I know exactly what you mean. I won&#39;t even go into my family, my mom is <br/>
convinced that I am raising untrained beasts to rule our lives. Which is ironic considering <br/>
how awesome my kids are...and how much she resents my 26yo brother who still lives at <br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
We were just having trouble last night, we have a weekly potluck at our house with friends <br/>
that we&#39;re very close to, three families from the church we used to attend. When I say <br/>
close, they are the families we were considering building a community with. One couple <br/>
seems intent on &#39;training&#39; our Avari (14 months) to not climb on our coffee table or to <br/>
touch their drinks when they leave them in accessible places. The table is something that <br/>
we dont have a problem with, it&#39;s relatively safe, and she loves to jump off. We leave our <br/>
drinks where they can&#39;t be reached. <br/>
<br/>
We  have in the past tended to parent each others children, and while this has never before <br/>
been a problem, you can tell that their conventional parenting is leading to some <br/>
problems. When I asked one set of brothers if they would help tidy a path through the toys <br/>
before dinner, they were pleased to help. The dad went ballistic though and threatened all <br/>
sorts of punishments if they didn&#39;t do a good enough job. I was shocked. When they LEAVE <br/>
their children here, we have no problems. I no longer leave my kids at their houses <br/>
unattended however, because it has become too hard for the kids to handle. <br/>
<br/>
It just reminds me that yeah, we&#39;re pretty mucy alone. Even I desert myself sometimes and <br/>
have to remind myself of the path I&#39;ve chosen. I wish you the best though, and good luck. I <br/>
read your blog and think you guys are doing so good, and just wish you the best to <br/>
continue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39999952"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m sure this is a redundant question given the nature of our lifestyles....but do you *sometimes* (LOL) feel alone in this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! My husband is on board and we have a few friends & family members<br/>
who have a basic understanding of homeschooling (meaning they don&#39;t<br/>
hound us or question us, they just accept that we&#39;ve made different<br/>
choices). But I&#39;ve found that most of them don&#39;t understand *our*<br/>
reasons for homeschooling and unschooling is a whole other level they<br/>
don&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago one of my closest friends mentioned that her daughter<br/>
(who is the same age as mine and the two are also close friends) had<br/>
asked to be homeschooled. My friend said she took that opportunity to<br/>
explain that we homeschool because our daughter has special needs and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to learn at school like the rest of the kids. You<br/>
could have knocked me over with a feather! I was just shocked. I think<br/>
my jaw dropped open and I was a bit speechless.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter was labeled with a medical diagnosis in her younger<br/>
years, but we&#39;ve moved away from that label because using it seemed to<br/>
have a limiting effect (i.e. people could only see her through that<br/>
designation versus seeing her as a whole, functioning person with a<br/>
unique set of traits and potential). My friend had no clue about our<br/>
homeschooling philosophy and views regarding compulsory schooling,<br/>
forced learning, children being treated with indignity, etc. She saw<br/>
homeschooling as acceptable only in the context that we had an<br/>
exception because there was something wrong with my child, as if all<br/>
normal kids go to school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The kicker was when she said &quot;I can only keep them for a week or so.  I can&#39;t homeschool for a long period of time.  Are the schools there better than where you were before?&quot;  UGH!!!!!!  My response: &quot;I&#39;m not sending them to school for a babysitter, mom.  And that&#39;s what it would be.  And no, the schools here aren&#39;t better than where we were.&quot;   UGHHH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been there! My mom held out hope for a long time that we&#39;d<br/>
eventually move and find a wonderful school to enroll our children in.<br/>
She would make comments like, &quot;Sure, homeschooling is fine for now,<br/>
but when you find a good school...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I feel like it&#39;s me (and sometimes hubby when he&#39;s really on board) against the world.  My kids are chided for skipping, running, talking to loudly in my sil&#39;s house.  It&#39;s like they must be &quot;seen and not heard&quot;.  Khalid, my spirited almost 4 year old gets the brunt of the stress, I think.  He&#39;s trying to still be the baby like Khidar (who will be 2), and my mil and sil don&#39;t seem to get that.  He&#39;s not doing stuff &quot;on purpose&quot; to be disrespectful.  My mil and sil are *big* into that old-school parenting stuff of listening to an adult just because they are an adult.  UGH!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same thing here! You know, for a long time dh and I just had no idea<br/>
that there was a different way of raising children because all our<br/>
lives we were surrounded with (and raised by) the old-school parenting<br/>
methods. It was definitely &quot;seen but not heard&quot; and punishment (rather<br/>
than understanding) was doled out regularly. By the time my sister and<br/>
I were in early elementary school we&#39;d been trained to sit quietly on<br/>
a sofa, twiddling our thumbs and staring at the ceiling for an hour<br/>
while the adults interacted.<br/>
<br/>
My family doesn&#39;t understand that I don&#39;t want to raise my children<br/>
that way. Yes, I want them to have manners, etc, but not at the cost<br/>
of their own voice and personality. My son is also 4 and very<br/>
spirited! He is just an absolutely bundle of energy, is quite the<br/>
thinker and talks aloud a lot. My parents&#39; house and my sister&#39;s house<br/>
are not child-friendly and when the kids visit it&#39;s a whole scene<br/>
about how Alaska did this and Alaska did that and how he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
listen and blah blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I might complain about my own child sometimes when I&#39;m feeling<br/>
especially overwhelmed but I don&#39;t want a list of things that are<br/>
wrong with him from other people, you know? Especially when their main<br/>
goal is to get him to sit down and be quiet and all their complaints<br/>
stem from his inability to do so. Rather than just seeing him as an<br/>
exuberant, creative child with strong will and determination, they see<br/>
him as a problem child. And then look at me as if I&#39;ve done something<br/>
wrong. They get upset when I try to explain or defend him, and<br/>
sometimes I feel they&#39;d rather I just take their side and dislike my<br/>
own kid. It took me a while to realize that their perception of him<br/>
was affecting MY perception of him. I had to get their voices out of<br/>
my head and see the joy in my child&#39;s personality.<br/>
<br/>
I should mention that my daughter is very laid back and spends long<br/>
periods of time being quiet, not because she&#39;s complying with them,<br/>
but because she enjoys time to herself and needs that quiet time. It&#39;s<br/>
ridiculous that one child is &quot;good&quot; and another &quot;trouble&quot; simply<br/>
because they have two very different needs and personalities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Sorry....I&#39;m just venting here because right now I want to go run away with my kids and dh and go homestead somewhere!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;re definitely not alone in your experiences! I try to look<br/>
at like this: I&#39;m the forerunner, doing things a new way instead of<br/>
raising children to be robots, trained to respond as programmed. I&#39;m<br/>
parenting the first generation of kids in our family who will<br/>
experience life without school. I&#39;m breaking the cycle of using<br/>
physical punishment and heavy-handed child-rearing methods. It&#39;s not<br/>
easy to be the one to shake things up and break new ground within a<br/>
family that has done the same old thing without question for<br/>
generations. It gets tiresome to constantly bump up against their<br/>
brick wall way of living and thinking. I sometimes I let their<br/>
attitude slow down my attempts at learning to parent the way I want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398412642">I&#39;m new to this group and joined for the same reasons: feeling alone and judged by family <br/>
and friends. I live in CT with very liberal HS laws :)  I, unfortunately sometimes, live right <br/>
next door to my mother. she constantly asks what he did or learned today. I&#39;ve talked with <br/>
DS about some responses to say like &quot;I did some projects&quot; or &quot;I read a couple books and <br/>
we went to the library&quot;. He&#39;s not usually far off the actual truth. <br/>
  Another main reason I joined was to pose a question to veteran Unschoolers:  When does <br/>
all this glorious &quot;wanting to learn&quot; start? I truly believe in learner directed unschooling, <br/>
John Holt&#39;s book are like doctrine. All I&#39;m seeing is wanting to watch movies in his room <br/>
and play computer games. The *closest* thng I&#39;ve noticed is him playing a game called <br/>
&quot;Stronghold&quot; set in the middle ages that has sparked an interest in that part of history. <br/>
yay!!!! <br/>
  He felt stupid in school. He was not up to their standards in reading and became the <br/>
clown so no one would notice. After alot of thought, I pulled him out. We&#39;re both happy <br/>
but I can&#39;t help being worried and stressed, especially with no support. I&#39;m not the kind of <br/>
person who needs a support network. I just can&#39;t handle blatant vocalized bashing <br/>
expressed as *worry* from my mom. When I tell people I HS, They look at me like I must <br/>
be crazy, especially when they ask about testing,grades,text books... &quot;you mean your not <br/>
regulated?&quot; they ask. AAAGGGHHH! Okay, *breathe*!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like all his glorius learning is going along fabulously. It&#39;s<br/>
not usually the kids that have any problems with unschooling, but the<br/>
parents. You&#39;re still seeing &quot;learning&quot; as schoolish type subjects and<br/>
discounting the actual learning he is doing right now. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learning every day that he&#39;s alive. Video games are a wonderful<br/>
way to learn. Anything he&#39;s interested in, or fascinated with is a<br/>
learning experience. Just not anything that may resemble a schoolish<br/>
type of subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to trust our children is the biggest factor in successful<br/>
unschooling. Sit next to him and find out what is fascinating about<br/>
those games. BE a part of his world, don&#39;t just wait for him to<br/>
express an interest that you understand....get into the things he<br/>
loves and you&#39;ll create connections.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not much unfortunately. We were walking into an event at the<br/>
time and her comment to me came right as she opened the door to go in.<br/>
I was sputtered something about &quot;there are so many other reasons we<br/>
homeschool&quot; and we went in. I haven&#39;t brought it back up again. Her<br/>
daughter is in public school and I just... well, I&#39;m concerned that it<br/>
would be impossible for me to *really* express my true feelings on the<br/>
subject without causing hurt or making her feel defensive. I just<br/>
don&#39;t know that it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory that people with kids in public school who, for<br/>
whatever reason, can&#39;t or won&#39;t consider homeschooling as an option,<br/>
cannot ever truly understand the concepts/messages of John Holt and<br/>
John Taylor Gatto. If they did, how could they continue to justify<br/>
sending their kids to school? They have a switch that prevents them<br/>
from really hearing/seeing and understanding it.<br/>
<br/>
My friend, for example, is wonderfully philosophical and open-minded<br/>
about nearly every topic in the world, but her situation is such that<br/>
she cannot pursue any alternative to public school at this time. All<br/>
the information in the world wouldn&#39;t do anything except stress her<br/>
out and make her feel bad, because she can&#39;t change the way things are<br/>
right now. So she&#39;s elected to be blind and deaf when it comes to the<br/>
negatives of public school. I think it&#39;s an automatic mental health<br/>
protection mechanism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are definatley not alone. I am a single mom of a very spirited <br/>
boy staying with family. It is so hard to not have your own space. My <br/>
family loves ds dearly, but they just don&#39;t get ds. They also do not <br/>
respect me as a parent, or as an adult. It is very hard, but for now <br/>
it feels like the best choice. I thought this would be a temporary <br/>
situation, but he has been going on for 2.5 years! This is definatley <br/>
not how I wanted to do things, but I am working really hard on <br/>
enjoying my ds. <br/>
<br/>
We spend most of our day out. This really helps. We go to free days <br/>
at musuems, stores, parks, where ever we can.<br/>
<br/>
As I am moving along in my deschooling (even before I knew about <br/>
unschooling), I have found myself very isolated in my parenting <br/>
beliefs. <br/>
I have parented ds &quot;differently&quot; from birth. I am the only stay at <br/>
home mom in my &quot;friend&quot; circle. I have tried to be very supportive of <br/>
my friends&#39; choice to return to work, yet they openly critizie my <br/>
decision to stay home. <br/>
<br/>
I have always noticed other&#39;s parenting, but now I seem even more <br/>
sensitive to how people disrespect children. I am always amazed at <br/>
the crap that my friends spew in explanation for how they treat their <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
I always thought that my best friend was of a similar mindset but <br/>
recently I have watched as the spirit of her precious daughters  is <br/>
being broken in the school system , as she just stands by, actually <br/>
agreeing that they need to be taught these lessons.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I too feel very lonely. I am so glad for this group and the <br/>
other group I am on (always unschooling). Thanks everybody for the <br/>
support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136892970">&lt;&lt;All I&#39;m seeing is wanting to watch movies in<br/>
his room<br/>
and play computer games.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right on, this is some glorious learning taking place.  My son is <br/>
learning how to read, thanks to video games.  Sometimes it is <br/>
exhausting sitting there for hours helping him read words but it is <br/>
what has given him the motivation to read.  My oldest son records all <br/>
kinds of shows like Modern Marvels, Ripleys Believe it or Not and <br/>
watches them at odd hours (usually while the rest of us are <br/>
sleeping).  It is incredible what he has learned from some of these <br/>
shows.  In fact, some of our deepest conversations begin with South <br/>
Park, I show I cringed to think my kids would want to watch two years <br/>
ago.  <br/>

  Ah Joanne....it&#39;s funny you should ask that question.  We were just kicked out of my inlaws house, so now we are nowhere near closer to having a place.  For the weekend we will be staying with my sister, and then we&#39;ll be nomads for a bit.  Sometimes this seems like someone else&#39;s life, ya know?

<br/>
Wow, I just read your blog.  I don&#39;t get along with my<br/>
in-laws either, but yours is just being rediculous.  I<br/>
am so sorry your kids had to see this, and hear things<br/>
they shouldn&#39;t ever have to.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you and your family find a place soon. <br/>
Can you stay with your mom?  Or is it too far away?  I<br/>
really hope that things get better for you, but am<br/>
glad you are away from your in-laws.  It sounds like<br/>
they expected so much from you and your kids.  Don&#39;t<br/>
they know that a child is the most precious gift that<br/>
you can ever have?<br/>
<br/>
As to your other post about feeling alone, I know<br/>
where you are coming from.  I have some friends I met<br/>
when my kids were in school.  I have been asked the<br/>
usual-how are you doing, how are the kids, what are<br/>
they learning, are they reading books, and what kind<br/>
of books, etc.  The one that got me the most was<br/>
asking me how I was doing with being around my kids<br/>
all the time?  I just say, that I love being with<br/>
them, and wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  Some of<br/>
these questions were fired at my kids at Christmas<br/>
time at my in-laws.  I wasn&#39;t there for obvious<br/>
reasons, but I hate always being questioned.  For that<br/>
reason alone, I never tell anyone that we unschool,<br/>
partially because of the questions, but mainly because<br/>
I know people from my family, and my husbands family,<br/>
and friends wouldn&#39;t understand.  I just tell people<br/>
that the kids are happier than they&#39;ve ever been, and<br/>
that they are learning.  (sorry, I got off track).<br/>
<br/>
The main thing is that if you are happy, and your<br/>
in-laws are nasty, then you don&#39;t need that kind of<br/>
negativity.  You are doing what is best for you and<br/>
your family.  If they can&#39;t see that, than to bad for<br/>
them, because they are missing out on really beautiful<br/>
children, who are very much loved by their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m from Michigan, so we don&#39;t get out your way.  As<br/>
hard as I&#39;ve tried, I don&#39;t think my mother approves,<br/>
but she can accept it.  My dad does much better with<br/>
it.  I still think they feel we&#39;re making a big<br/>
mistake, but after all my kids have been through, I<br/>
can&#39;t with a clean conscience put them back in public<br/>
school.  It&#39;s done too much damage to them, that we<br/>
are still working on.<br/>
<br/>
I will definately be a support person for you. <br/>
Anytime you need to talk, you can email me off list,<br/>
if you would like.   I know how hard it is.  I have a<br/>
couple of friends, that will ask how things are going,<br/>
and how the kids are.  They both know that we<br/>
homeschool, but know nothing about the unschooling. <br/>
For us, the unschooling fits our lifestyle better, and<br/>
the kids are more at ease.  They still learn, but<br/>
about fun things they are interested in, not the<br/>
things that they are forced to learn.<br/>
<br/>
My mother in-law is bad enough, where my kids don&#39;t<br/>
even want to see her.  They came over a couple of<br/>
years ago for Christmas, and she made a nasty comment<br/>
to me right infront of my son.  She had said she<br/>
should take a picture, and I thought maybe she was<br/>
talking about taking a picture of my son, but said she<br/>
should take a picture of my clean floor.  Since that<br/>
day, they are not allowed in my house, unless I am not<br/>
home.  She constantly critcizes me, and offers advice<br/>
on how to do thing.  I am not living in a house that<br/>
has no dust, etc, but one that we are comfortable<br/>
with, and one that looks like people actually live<br/>
here. (her house is worse than mine, and there is only<br/>
two of them there.)  She, along with my brother<br/>
in-laws girlfriend were asking questions to my<br/>
daughter and son about what they were learning, and<br/>
what books they are reading.  If they don&#39;t want to<br/>
read, I don&#39;t make them.  They pretty much have free<br/>
roam to do what they want, accept for a few things. <br/>
(Sorry I am rambling, I understand what you are going<br/>
through with you mil.)<br/>
<br/>
Email me anytime, and I will answer as soon as I can. <br/>
I haven&#39;t been to any conferences either.  They sounds<br/>
intersting, but not sure when we can afford to go to<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and I hope all goes well for you and your<br/>
family.<br/>
