<div id="ygrps-yiv-687160895">Some of you have heard about the Alphabet Soup: 2009 Calgary<br/>
Unschooling Conference I&#39;m hosting this September 18-20, 2009. I&#39;m<br/>
so excited to announce that a splash page for my website has just<br/>
gone live!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/">http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
A fleshed out site, with online registration, links to our Alphabet<br/>
Soup yahoo discussion group and more information about our speakers<br/>
and about unschooling will be progressing over the next few weeks,<br/>
with e-commerce, (for registration and book buying) going live by<br/>
March 16.<br/>
<br/>
For now, our yahoo discussion group is already operational:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Check back regularly to not miss out on any details. This *will* be<br/>
a sell out conference. If you&#39;re interested in attending, make sure<br/>
you register early!<br/>
