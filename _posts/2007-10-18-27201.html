<div id="ygrps-yiv-416642347">Apologies for the cross-posting but I wanted to get the word out  <br/>
quickly --<br/>
<br/>
Steve Cooperman contacted me a couple weeks ago about arranging an  <br/>
opportunity for he and Eli Gerzon to speak to unschoolers in Iowa.  <br/>
Iï¿½m excited to announce their presentation: The Unschooling/ <br/>
Worldschooling Experience: What Happens When You Follow Your Passion?  <br/>
on Sunday, October 28, 2007 from 2:30 - 4:30 p.m. at the West Des  <br/>
Moines Library Community Room.<br/>
<br/>
Seating is limited so please email me at:  iowaunschoolers at gmail  <br/>
dot com to reserve your seats.<br/>
