<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124082182">I also posted on the Always Unschooled list.<br/>
<br/>
However, since I am not entirely sure if my kids have been always unschooled (they are 1 and 3 and we have practiced attachment parenting/consensual parenting since birth, we had an unassisted birth, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
but anyhow, I thought I would check this list out.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of unschoolers go by Sandra Dodd&#39;s book, but a friend of mine lent me another book today, titled &quot;Radical Unschooling: A Revolution Has Begun&quot; by Dayna Martin, and I am looking forward to another perspective on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read it? Is it any good?<br/>
<br/>
Would you recommend it as a good intro to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443629968">I have not read either book, but have read a lot at Sandra&#39;s website/blogs and Dayna&#39;s blog. I have also watched both of them speak in YouTube videos. A bit of background on both authors:<br/>
<br/>
Dayna&#39;s children are fairly young...I believe her oldest is just barely a teenager (or may still be a tween); she has been unschooling for less than ten years. She blends the Law of Attraction with her style of unschooling. Dayna bills herself as the &quot;leading voice&quot; in pioneering radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s children are grown (her youngest is 18-ish and her oldest is in his mid-20s), so she has been unschooling for about twenty years. Her approach is secular. Sandra is described as an unschooling advocate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980762010">I&#39;ll reply on this list to say the author is a big proponent of the Law of Attraction philosophy - which some people find consistent with unschooling and others don&#39;t. If you like LOA (you are exactly where you need to be, call the energy of the universe to your aid, etc) then its probably a good match. If you aren&#39;t into that stuff it will probably drive you away from unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
A note on internet etiquette - cross posting the same question to related lists is rude, since there&#39;s generally a bit of cross-over. At best, it creates confusing as people can&#39;t recall what&#39;s been said where if the threads get long. At worst, it peeves off the longtime writers and you get less gracious replies!<br/>
