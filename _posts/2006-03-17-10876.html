<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053350535">Hi all,<br/>
I &#39;m just curious as to how many other former (or current) public school  <br/>
teachers are on this list.  We&#39;re currently an &quot;in-the-closet unschooling  <br/>
family&quot; as I teach at public school and do not yet have tenure.  However,  this year <br/>
is not going great right now for me because I&#39;m having a hard time  <br/>
justifying what my students face every day with how I feel about how education  should <br/>
be.  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to do my part to make the school experience better for my group  <br/>
of high school special education students, but still, the arbitrary rules and  <br/>
obnoxious state testing (we&#39;re in NY- tons of tests!) have really been getting <br/>
 to me lately.  When they (students) complain about school I want to tell  <br/>
them all -  HOMESCHOOL!<br/>
But this seems to be the career I&#39;m settled with for now (didn&#39;t word that  <br/>
quite right but can&#39;t think of how to say it..)<br/>
Just wondering how many others have become (or always been) unschoolers  <br/>
after having experiences working in the public school system. <br/>
 Gotta go, the kids and dh are begging to play their Gettysburg game,  but <br/>
tomorrow they are getting their own used computer just for games,  yippie!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to work FT in the the public schools before I had my own <br/>
kids, and I loved it. I&#39;m a music teacher and was always <br/>
given &quot;something else,&quot; like, say a drama class.<br/>
<br/>
It worked really well for me, and it was probably very different <br/>
from a &quot;regular&quot; teacher job ... because first of all, I was a <br/>
traveling teacher, so nobody ever really knew where I was and I got <br/>
out of a lot of meetings and stuff, because during the meeting I <br/>
would be at my other school.<br/>
<br/>
Also, nobody really cares about the music and drama classes, unless <br/>
they&#39;re impressed, so I almost literally could do whatever I wanted <br/>
and people almost never complained. For my music classes, I always <br/>
made up my own stuff; I didn&#39;t follow the textbook or other <br/>
expensive supplies. For example, I taught my middle school kids <br/>
about the I-IV-V chording pattern and we played &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; <br/>
on the Orff instruments, that kind of thing. We also played a <br/>
modified version of the board game &quot;Encore.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I would bring to them anything I thought was interesting <br/>
or worth sharing. <br/>
<br/>
And for drama there was *no* curriculum or objectives or anything, <br/>
so I just did whatever struck my fancy. I used to record Whose Line <br/>
is it Anyway and we would watch some, then do our own. I&#39;m sure I <br/>
was breaking some district rules by doing that, but nobody ever <br/>
called me on it. <br/>
<br/>
So, I didn&#39;t have to worry about standardized testing, or following <br/>
a specific set of books, or whatever it is that it sounds like <br/>
teachers often have to worry about. When I was told to do dumb <br/>
things like tie in my lesson to the &quot;Value of the week&quot; or whatever, <br/>
I would just smile graciously, then put the info in the trash after <br/>
the person left the room.<br/>
<br/>
I still teach private music lessons. I also sometimes go into the <br/>
public schools as a contract worker, to accompany chorus concerts. <br/>
Even though I enjoy doing it, it is often sad for me because the <br/>
environment is so clearly unpleasant in most classrooms. I always <br/>
make an effort to smile a lot and try to chat with the kids a little.<br/>

hi I went to school for three and a half years to be a ps teacher, after working in a school <br/>
for 6 months, i realized that i could never be happy there.  I wish i had remembered that <br/>
when Lil wanted to go to ps, i wish i could have convinced her how un happy she would <br/>
be, but i guess that was another thing she wanted to learn on her own. Melanie in vt&gt;<br/>
