<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868373452">&quot;I did mention to Renee&#39;s dad that there is a way to play Musical Chairs that<br/>
is non-competitive and every kid ends up laughing instead of crying, but got<br/>
a few &quot;what is the matter with her&quot; looks. Oh well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten that kind of response too...it&#39;s so annoying.<br/>
We play the cooperative musical chairs also, if we even play organized games at a party. The adults, when told about our cooperative version, smiled wanly and said &quot;Oh, how interesting&quot;, or &quot;You&#39;re so funny Ren&quot; with a look on their face like &quot;poor addled liberal&quot;.<br/>
Interestingly enough, the kids that come to our parties always go home talking about how much fun they had. We don&#39;t have tears, or anyone feeling left out, what is so weird about THAT?<br/>
This competition driven society is just plain sick in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
One time, we had prizes. The children all played cooperative musical chairs and then everyone picked a prize! They were all SO shocked when I told them all to go pick something....like they weren&#39;t sure I was for real. After each and every game (I think there were two or three) everyone picked an item from the box. I loved the looks on their faces.<br/>
It was dollar store stuff, but I tried to pick things I knew they&#39;d all like....teapots, cars, notepads etc...<br/>
<br/>
These days, the kids come up with their own games,usually involving hiding or the woods/creek behind our house. And the friends we have are either home/unschooled or schooled kids that know how we operate.:)<br/>
<br/>
As to Renee&#39;s sexual interest...that all sounds normal for her age, what is NOT normal or healthy is her desire to control other human beings to the extent of ignoring their boundaries. But it sounds normal for HER house. Yuck.<br/>
I applaud you for dealing with this family, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d have the fortitude in your position.<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with limiting toxic people in your life...that isn&#39;t snobbery, it&#39;s sanity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748864412">It&#39;s so good to hear others that like the non-competitive games!! I&#39;ve never<br/>
liked group games that only allow one &#39;winner&#39;, even as a kid....and two of<br/>
my kids don&#39;t like losing in groups. They don&#39;t have a problem with winning<br/>
and losing at board games...just group games like musical chairs and such.<br/>
I instituted a new tradition at our church.  I love our church...but I&#39;m<br/>
continually challenging the &#39;way it&#39;s always done&#39; mentality.  Piñatas are<br/>
fun...but I hate the run and grab all you can method. So I insisted on<br/>
everyone grabbing what they can and adding it to a big bag. The older kids<br/>
were much more likely to let the younger kids &#39;find&#39; some of the treasure to<br/>
add to the bag since it wouldn&#39;t take away from their portion.  When all the<br/>
treats and treasures are scooped up, the adults or older teens divide the<br/>
loot evenly into smaller bags for everyone.  The adults thought I was<br/>
crazy...but when it was all over, the kids were happy and content.  After<br/>
seeing this the other adults are like &quot;Wow, what a great idea.....&quot;   We are<br/>
still working on some of the other games they want to play...there seems to<br/>
be a need to &#39;teach them how to lose&#39; and &#39;teach them they can&#39;t win every<br/>
time&#39;.  As if that won&#39;t happen in the course of everyday life.  I&#39;d much<br/>
rather let them all work together and have fun.  My kids always have the<br/>
option of sitting out if they don&#39;t want to play so it&#39;s not a big<br/>
deal...but little by little, I challenge others to look at the world a bit<br/>
differently. They may never agree with me, but they do respect our choices.<br/>

That&#39;s a good idea, too.  What I did with our pinata is put the candy  <br/>
pre-sorted into containers inside the pinata, just enough for everyone at the  <br/>
party.  (They were actually small plastic pumpkins.)  The kids (all  unschooled) <br/>
were kind of shocked when they saw what came out, but they quickly  understood <br/>
that if they picked up more than one than someone wouldn&#39;t get any  candy.<br/>
 <br/>
I really felt like a spoil-sport for doing it that way, and I was afraid  <br/>
someone would say it wasn&#39;t fun that way.  But my son, the one who always  gets <br/>
pushed away from displays at the zoo by crowds of school kids, is also the  one <br/>
who gets the least candy from the pinata.  He&#39;s just not going to be  <br/>
aggressive and act greedy to get the most candy.  (Nice guys finish last,  you know?)<br/>
 <br/>
So it worked out.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935246763">What we did at a recent piñata party was to give all the adults little<br/>
bags of candy to throw around just as the piñata broke and kids started<br/>
to scatter, effectively increasing the area of candy coverage by a lot.<br/>
It worked really well.  There were no tears and only the bigger kids<br/>
seemed to notice the trick and they didnt care.<br/>
