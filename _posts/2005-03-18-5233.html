I just rejected two posts for being put-downs,rather than useful <br/>
discussion, but I thought one of the ideas was worth discussing for <br/>
it&#39;s sheer illogical point.<br/>

It was a response to this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, joke! Heck, I sometimes wish t.v. my kids would get into a<br/>
state like this simply by having them watch t.v. My boys 6,5, and 2<br/>
watch t.v. 99.9% of the time and 99.9% of the time are literally<br/>
bouncing off the walls!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The poster was implying that television would make kids hyper!!<br/>
***********************<br/>
That&#39;s not what I got from her post at all. I read it as &quot;It&#39;s ridiculus to <br/>
say it makes them Comatose.  My kids are far from that and they watch alot of <br/>
TV. AND they watch, not BECAUSE they watch.<br/>
