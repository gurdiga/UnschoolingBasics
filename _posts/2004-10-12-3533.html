<div id="ygrps-yiv-757536613">I&#39;m no expert with unschooling, but my advice is to just drop the curriculum<br/>
entirely and let everyone take a very long hiatus from any kind of<br/>
structured school like stuff. Maybe some de-schooling is in order? I&#39;m sure<br/>
you will get some very good words of wisdom from the folks here. Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Well, you could choose to keep on doing damage instead. I think <br/>
changing our minds when something isn&#39;t working, shows our children <br/>
we&#39;re willing to admit we were WRONG and able to learn.:)<br/>
Is change worse than continuing to make your lives miserable?<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine doing anything with my children that would cause our <br/>
days to be less than joyful. Our focus is on living joyful, <br/>
interesting lives, not cramming any kind of information into anybody.<br/>
<br/>
And I bet you&#39;ve done something similar before, so maybe you&#39;re just <br/>
going back to what you used to do. Did you use a curriculum when she <br/>
was a baby and toddler? Or did you just play with her, read to her, <br/>
find interesting things for your home? Did she learn while being <br/>
surrounded by a rich environment? I bet she learned beautifully.<br/>
Unschooling is trusting that the child WANTS to learn and only <br/>
forcing can shut down that love.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned ABEKA...I assume you&#39;re a strict Christian? If you <br/>
are, you might want to be prepared for some flak from your Christian <br/>
friends over the choice to unschool. I can post some Christian <br/>
unschooling sites if you&#39;d like.<br/>
