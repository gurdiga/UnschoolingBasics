<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823468410">Hi, I&#39;m Amanda.  My family consists of Justin age 5 1/2, Madison age  3, DH, <br/>
and pets- dog, cats, chickens.  We live in an off-the-grid home in  rural New <br/>
York State.  <br/>
My son is attending private school this year (when I&#39;d been planning for  the <br/>
last 2 years to unschool) after my husband and I both found employment at  <br/>
about the same time.  We moved to the country a little over a year ago and  I <br/>
accepted a teaching job (I teach high school special education- that&#39;s  another <br/>
long story, but is a big part of why we want to homeschool) because my  DH was <br/>
unable to find work in this very rural area.  So shortly after I  went back <br/>
to work (was SAHM for 4 years), DH accepts position.  So we  think, yippie, I <br/>
can go back to staying home and we can unschool... then, his  company anounces <br/>
that they will be closing within a few years but layoffs will  begin anytime <br/>
now.  So, it looks like I will continue working  afterall.  We decided to send <br/>
our son to school for K since we were both  working this year.  Next year, if <br/>
DH still has position, we would like him  to continue working as long as he <br/>
can to pay off the land that we purchased when  we moved here. <br/>
 <br/>
We will be able to live (barely) off my salary after that, but aren&#39;t  <br/>
worried about that as prior to now, we&#39;d been living off one salary for years  <br/>
anyway.<br/>
Ok, so that&#39;s my background info.  next year, I&#39;d like my son to not  go back <br/>
to school.  My mom lives nearby and watches my 3 year old.   She says she <br/>
will watch my son too, but is very concerned about his  schooling.  I&#39;m talking <br/>
to her about unschooling, but she doesn&#39;t quite get  it.  At this point, I&#39;m <br/>
kind of now teling her that I can &quot;teach&quot; him in  the evenings, weekends, and <br/>
summers, and could she just watch him and play with  him during the day while <br/>
we&#39;re working?  Like she does with my daughter who  has a ball at grandma&#39;s with <br/>
the baking and the dress up , and the library  trips, you know.<br/>
 <br/>
My son has been complaining this year already that he doesn&#39;thave enough  <br/>
time to play because he&#39;s in school, and why can&#39;t they have longer recess (at  <br/>
least his school actually has recess), etc.  He&#39;s excited about the stuff  he&#39;s <br/>
been learning at school, but would prefer not to go.  We have a  housefull of <br/>
fun stuff to do, books to read, woods to play in, animals to care  for, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has homeschooled with 2 parents working?  <br/>
 <br/>
My son would love it home with grandma as her place has tons of stuff to  do. <br/>
 He told me last night that if he didn&#39;t have to go to school he could  sew <br/>
with grandma (she makes quilts and great costumes), do airplane models with  <br/>
grandpa, play legos, and sleep in!  Plus paint, draw, write, and listen to  <br/>
grandma read books.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess that even though I had been plainning on homeschooling all along,  we <br/>
got off track this year with working and sending him to K. It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve <br/>
 lost the courage to keep him home next year, I had just always thought I&#39;d <br/>
be  the one home with him having all the unschooling fun!<br/>
 <br/>
Also, where we live there is not a homeschooling group.  There are a  few <br/>
very rigid Christian school at homers, and about 1 1/2 away is a more  relaxed <br/>
group, but a long drive for a playdate.<br/>
 <br/>
ANY THOUGHTS?  <br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
AMANDA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888447022">Grandma&#39;s house sounds wonderful. I&#39;d go for that, for sure. And -  <br/>
telling her not to worry about his &quot;education,&quot; that you&#39;ll handle  <br/>
that in the evenings and on weekends is very reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
As far as homeschool groups - you don&#39;t need one. Keep in touch with  <br/>
any kids in school - make play dates. Maybe, IF your son seems to  <br/>
desire more social interactions, join in on an activity that he&#39;d  <br/>
enjoy - Campfire Boys and Girls is a good one, if you have that near  <br/>
you. But, your kids are little, don&#39;t rush and don&#39;t feel like they  <br/>
NEED a group.<br/>

  So, why wait?  How about pulling him from Kindergarten now and letting him hang out with g&#39;ma & g&#39;pa and his little sister tomorrow?  If he&#39;s already not happy there, and they could have him, seems to me there&#39;s no reason to wait for May.<br/>

If it helps to tell her that the &quot;teaching&quot; happens at night then go ahead. You will know that the learning happens all the time. Grandma&#39;s sounds like a pretty cool place to hang out to me!<br/>

sure you are in compliance. <br/>
