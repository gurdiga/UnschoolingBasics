<br/>
Just this week I had a 6-year-old ask me why I was &quot;small like a teenager?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 5 ft. 1 in. on a good day.<br/>
<br/>
(If only I really was small all around like when I was a teenager!)<br/>

(they sell them by waist and length) and discovered I was *square* -<br/>
same length and waist measurement! <br/>
<br/>
Can I come to your house - I&#39;ll feel &quot;tall&quot; - I&#39;m all of 5&#39;4&quot; when<br/>
gravity eases up :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266273843">If it makes anyone feel better, I am 4 feet 11-3/4 inches.  I&#39;ve<br/>
shrunk since high school (scoliosis).  My tallest days were 5 feet<br/>
1-1/4 inches.   I&#39;m taller than one of my aunts, and my grandma was<br/>
4&#39;10&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I like to wear shoes with thick soles, sometimes a boot with a chunky<br/>
heel.  It makes me feel taller - even just in the kitchen standing at<br/>
the counter.  Makes me feel a little bigger than the vegetables I&#39;m<br/>
chopping. <br/>
<br/>
When I was in my early 20s working as a nursing home administrator, my<br/>
residents all thought I was a kid.  One said she thought was 12! <br/>
Tough crowd!  (One nice thing about that job was that I was actually<br/>
taller than some of my little old lady friends.)  <br/>
