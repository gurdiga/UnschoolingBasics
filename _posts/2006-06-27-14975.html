<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556198656">&quot;I&#39;d look at them as they were being their delightful, amazing, curious,<br/>
light-filled selves and started to realize that in many of those<br/>
moments I feel they are rude and destructive it really can be just a<br/>
matter of perspective...a slight shift in thinking reframes it all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aha! I enjoyed the more detailed account of the changes going on..thanks.<br/>
It IS mostly perspective isn&#39;t it?  I&#39;ve found that the way I choose<br/>
to view my children greatly affects my ability to problem solve<br/>
peacefully. Assuming the best every time, really leads to better<br/>
outcomes.:)<br/>
<br/>
As to the conference craziness...yes, I saw that too. I think when<br/>
children are all together in a venue like that, it CAN get a bit crazy<br/>
and they DO need reminders of what is appropriate for that venue.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I have the opportunity to be around large groups of children just<br/>
about everwhere I go right now (summertime camps and such) and the<br/>
high energy of the conferences is SO different from the truly<br/>
destructive energy I see from the overly controlled children.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of young children together means parents need to be more present,<br/>
more aware, more available to help them in a place they&#39;re not used<br/>
to. I still don&#39;t equate that with &quot;spoiled&quot; or &quot;out-of-control&quot;<br/>
though. The mess in the craft room made MY chest seize up too...so<br/>
don&#39;t feel badly!!:) I&#39;m not a big fan of styrafoam, uck.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve had some whopper messes with flour and water and other gooey<br/>
materials. If I can wipe it up, I&#39;m not stressed.  And interestingly,<br/>
my kids all join in without being asked....the last time Jared said<br/>
&quot;we can&#39;t leave Mom with all this mess, we need to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So yes...it works.<br/>
And I think what you&#39;ve figured out is the very discussion we had at<br/>
the conference about freedom and awareness (mindfulness) being parts<br/>
of the whole. Freedom without awareness is just craziness (and<br/>
sometimes destruction or disrespect). We need both.<br/>

&quot;I&#39;m so fickle. I need to set a goal for my future and make a plan  <br/>

<br/>
I said, &quot;You&#39;re so wonderfully flexible, you change your plans when  <br/>
you realize they aren&#39;t working for you. You&#39;re willing to  <br/>
experiment, you have an open-mind about things, and you try on lots  <br/>
of ideas. You think ahead, but you don&#39;t follow a plan just for its  <br/>
own sake, you constantly re-evaluate what you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was flabbergasted. Seriously. He said, &quot;You think more highly of  <br/>
me than I do.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;m a LOT older than you and I do have a  <br/>
better sense of what traits are important in a happy life. You have  <br/>
been told, over and over, about how important it is to stick to  <br/>
things, but I have seen with my own eyes that it is important to  <br/>
sample and experiment a lot, first, and I know that you WILL stick  <br/>
with something when you find something worth sticking with. You won&#39;t  <br/>
have to decide to do that, you&#39;ll do it because you&#39;ll want to do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - he&#39;s been feeling guilty and awful about himself for being  <br/>
&quot;fickle.&quot; (It is how his own parents see him.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope he&#39;ll see himself a little differently - reflected back by me  <br/>
(and others) in a different way, because thinking of himself as  <br/>
&quot;fickle&quot; (what a horrible word) isn&#39;t helping him - it is stifling him.<br/>
<br/>
Kids internalize what we think about them - that&#39;s how they think of  <br/>
themselves. And it is so hard to change that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s awful. My dad once commented that I was &quot;always a nickel short <br/>
and a minute late&quot; and I&#39;ve never forgotten it. I was maybe 7 or 8 at <br/>
the time and the implication that I was never going to do anything <br/>
right was extremely defeating.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think some parents realize that what are for them offhand <br/>
remarks or descriptive terms, are actually very hurtful and are being <br/>
internalized by the kids and sometimes remembered for the rest of their <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
I run into trouble with this when people ask me if my two girls are <br/>
very similar. They couldn&#39;t be more different, but it sounds so <br/>
negative to call Charlotte &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;high strung&quot; or other <br/>
similar terms, when describing Violet in the same breath as &quot;laid back&quot; <br/>
or &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;mellow&quot; right in front of them. So I just say, &quot;They&#39;re <br/>
opposites in most ways,&quot; and let them figure it out from there using <br/>
their own observations.<br/>
<br/>
I know it drives me nuts when my mom compares my sister to me <br/>
(unfavorably) always in the context of how smart I am or how I read so <br/>
much (and learned how so early) and such. We&#39;re 1/2 sisters 17 years <br/>
apart! Of course we&#39;re different. But even if we were twins it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be right to rub it in the way she does.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with being a dabbler. There is nothing wrong <br/>
with being a specialist. The important thing is to be true to yourself, <br/>
do what you love, and love what you do. Here&#39;s an excerpt from a cool <br/>
article in the washington post about happiness and flow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has slogged through a dead-end job counting the hours until <br/>
quittin&#39; time already knows that the right job is a big part of <br/>
day-to-day happiness. But finding good, meaningful work -- what Haidt <br/>
refers to as a &quot;calling&quot; -- is easier said than done. (That&#39;s why they <br/>
call it work, Grasshopper.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People often think &#39;I&#39;ll be happy when,&#39; &quot; says Pete Cohen, a life <br/>
coach and co-author of &quot;Feeling Good for No Good Reason&quot; (How To Books, <br/>
1999). But then we get whatever it is we&#39;re chasing -- a raise, a <br/>
promotion, a good solid kick of the pigskin -- and it turns out we <br/>
never really find joie de vivre.<br/>
<br/>
The key is to tap into what Hungarian-born psychologist Mihaly <br/>
Csikszentmihalyi describes in his book &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal <br/>
Experience&quot; (Harper & Row, 1990) as the total immersion that happens <br/>
when &quot;people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to <br/>
matter.&quot; Instead of focusing on the destination, we&#39;d do better to <br/>
enjoy the journey -- the work that leads to the raise rather than the <br/>
raise itself.<br/>
<br/>
Not a 9-to-5 type? Don&#39;t fret. Debbie Gisonni, author of &quot;The Goddess <br/>
of Happiness (Inner Ocean Publishing, 2005), recommends thinking back <br/>
to childhood and remembering the things that made you happy then. Maybe <br/>
your pathway to &quot;flow&quot; is raising kids, painting murals, singing in the <br/>
church choir -- anything that plays to your strengths and is rewarding <br/>
for its own sake, rather than for the end goal.<br/>

&quot;I&#39;m so fickle. I need to set a goal for my future and make a plan<br/>
and stick with it.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I remember in my twenties and on to nearly age thirty, sitting around<br/>
w. my husband and his sister and her husband and talking about our<br/>
jobs and wondering about jobs that we didn&#39;t know about.  This was a<br/>
big topic of conversation at our infrequent gettogethers for *years*.<br/>
 We all described our job experiences to each other and talked about<br/>
what we liked and didn&#39;t like, but at the time we really wanted to<br/>
know more about how it would feel to try on different jobs.  This is<br/>
really hard stuff to &quot;get&quot; from just looking outside.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
going to take investigation and trial and error for your friend to<br/>
&quot;find himself&quot;.  And if he doesn&#39;t get that done until he&#39;s thirty, I<br/>
don&#39;t think he&#39;s really behind.<br/>
<br/>
Does he have interests that his parents don&#39;t fully support? <br/>
Something &quot;frivolous&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, I tend to think degree programs and required courses<br/>
are too big a time sink and to prefer diving into learning by doing<br/>
some kind of project.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great time for your friend to pursue breadth rather than<br/>
depth -- but I can&#39;t make him believe that.<br/>

We&#39;ve introduced him to theater and music and dance and he really  <br/>
likes all that. He plays games - D&D and Magic, the Gathering. He&#39;s  <br/>
brilliant at spatial puzzles and games - and really really loves them  <br/>
- things like Rush Hour.<br/>

&gt; As an unschooler, I tend to think degree programs and required courses<br/>
&gt; are too big a time sink and to prefer diving into learning by doing<br/>
&gt; some kind of project.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His parents won&#39;t let him have much time to dive into other things -  <br/>
he has to be going to school (college, now that he got himself out of  <br/>
high school) and/or working full time, all the time. But, we&#39;re  <br/>
helping him squeeze a real life into the time and space he has  <br/>
available. Mostly he&#39;s going without sleep a lot to fit it all in.<br/>

&gt; This is a great time for your friend to pursue breadth rather than<br/>
&gt; depth -- but I can&#39;t make him believe that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah - but he&#39;ll be at the HSC AND the L&L conferences, we hope, and  <br/>
I think that&#39;ll be really eye-opening for him. Those who are there,  <br/>
watch for him and TALK to him, please. The more interaction with  <br/>
caring and respectful adults and other teens, he has, the better for  <br/>
him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597171712">** As list owner, I might be able to encourage more posting on the<br/>
UnschoolingStories list, I suppose. But I, personally, don&#39;t feel<br/>
passionately about regularly sharing anecdotes about our lives just<br/>
for the sake of sharing anecdotes - I&#39;d rather share them in the<br/>
context of making a philosophical point about unschooling.**<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think I tend to chose to post one of my stories when I think<br/>
someone *needs* it, when it&#39;s relevant to something someone is trying<br/>
to sort out.  The last story I posted was about navel-gazing about my<br/>
career in my twenties, because I thought the story was appropriate for<br/>
your teenage friend who feels he should buckle down and focus.  (I was<br/>
rereading week-old posts in the archives here.)<br/>
<br/>
Often I can&#39;t remember enough details of my old stories, beyond the<br/>
bottom-line moral of the story.  If I post just a &quot;moral&quot; here, I<br/>
don&#39;t think that means I&#39;m &quot;moralizing&quot;, but maybe it sounds like it<br/>
to someone.  &lt;g&gt;  (Sometimes all I can remember about a book is<br/>
whether I liked it or not.  Maybe I&#39;m an &quot;emotional learner&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
** Yeah - but he&#39;ll be at the HSC AND the L&L conferences, we hope,<br/>
and I think that&#39;ll be really eye-opening for him. Those who are<br/>

for him.**<br/>
<br/>
You can introduce me to him, but I&#39;m not sure whether my story of late<br/>
maturity will comfort him or not.  Rhetorically I&#39;m thinking &quot;how can<br/>
you know where you want to live if you&#39;ve never been there?&quot;  The same<br/>
goes for knowing what you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
(Hmmm... &quot;finding a calling; finding a job&quot; is a potentially tappable<br/>
topic for UnschoolingStories.)<br/>
<br/>
My 50 year old brother-in-law is taking a &quot;what career is right for<br/>
you&quot; class at his local community college.  He really likes it -- but<br/>
HE doesn&#39;t have parents breathing down HIS neck.  (He&#39;s currently, no<br/>
kidding, a rocket scientist, but the field IS volatile. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
