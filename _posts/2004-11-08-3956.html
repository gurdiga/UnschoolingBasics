<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725187840">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Leslie.  I have two beautiful boys, Parker age 5 and Aidan age 3.  I decided to homeschool while pregnant with my first son.  It was quite a battle to get my husband understand the concept.  Fortunately, we are both on the same page and we are both looking forward to this journey as a family.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am getting stressed out.  I lie awake at night worrying about whether or not I am doing the right thing.  Could anyone give me some pointers on where to start with unschooling?  I know some homeschooling methods have a curriculum.  I&#39;ve done some reading on unschooling and I feel it would work out best for my children as well as myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.  I look forward to reading input from other like minded people.<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie<br/>

This has been in my inbox for quite a while now. I meant to respond---and  <br/>
figured someone else would. Maybe someone did----I don&#39;t remember. Sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
The best places to learn about unschooling would be *HERE* &lt;g&gt;,   <br/>
_www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling_ (http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)  ,  <br/>
_www.unschooling.com_ (http://www.unschooling.com)  &#39;s message  boards and <br/>
essays,  <br/>
 _www.unschooling.info/forum_ (http://www.unschooling.info/forum)  ,  <br/>
and since you have littlun&#39;s : _alwaysunschooled@yahoogroups.com_ <br/>
(mailto:alwaysunschooled@yahoogroups.com)    . <br/>
There&#39;s also _unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com_ <br/>
(mailto:unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com)   , which is usually more high volume.<br/>
 <br/>
None of these are &quot;support lists&quot;. They are ALL discussion lists.  ALL  will <br/>
question you and encourage you to question yourself----not always easy!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d advise reading, reading, and reading some more before you post  questions <br/>
at most of those places: I&#39;m betting ALL of your questions have been  asked <br/>
and answered more than once at each place. Plus, if you read the archives  a <br/>
while, you&#39;ll get the feel of the place and the posters&#39; styles. That way you  <br/>
won&#39;t take offense when none was meant! &lt;G&gt; (We can all be a little  radical in <br/>
our thoughts and exuberant in our opinions! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Magazines: _Life Learning_  and  _Live Free, Learn Free_ are the  two <br/>
unschooling &#39;zines.<br/>
 <br/>
Books: All of John Holt (our patron saint) , in order, so you can watch his  <br/>
thoughts and perceptions grow and change.<br/>
 <br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s  _Dumbing Us Down_ & _The Underground History  of <br/>
American Education_   He gets the husbands on board pretty quickly!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Mary Griffith&#39;s  _The Unschooling Handbook_<br/>
 <br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_----super even for a mom  <br/>
of toddlers. Don&#39;t miss the &quot;cute little story&quot; at the beginning!<br/>
 <br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_<br/>
 <br/>
Our own Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s _The Unprocessed Child_  . Valerie&#39;s a  <br/>
regular contributor here and other places---&quot;one of us&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
There are a few boooks that are more parenting-related: _The Continuum  <br/>
Concept_,  _How to Talk so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk_,  <br/>
_Siblings Without Rivalry_, &  _Mindful Parenting_.<br/>
 <br/>
Movies include _Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off_, _The Sound of Music_, &  _Pippi <br/>
Longstocking_.<br/>
 <br/>
Fiction: _Skellig_ &  _StarGirl_.<br/>
 <br/>
Others will come along and add to these lists, I&#39;m sure!<br/>
 <br/>
Finally: Trust your children. Respect your children. Enjoy your children.  <br/>
Live in the moment. <br/>

Try to relax! Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily have a<br/>
beginning or an end. If you&#39;re already letting your<br/>
sons learn freely, then you&#39;ve already begun.<br/>
