  I loved the Graduate; so many memorable scenes and such great music by Simon and Garfunkel.  I&#39;ve seen it several times and never picked up that it was about disenchantment with education.  But, then I was just a little kid when it came out and haven&#39;t seen it since having my own kids and homeschooling.<br/>
   <br/>
  I wonder how the author will portray the homeschool family of Benjamin and Elaine ?  I suppose they&#39;ll be a really dysfunctional family, especially if  Grandma (Mrs. Robinson) gets involved!  <br/>

   <br/>
  Elusive American writer Charles Webb said Wednesday he has signed a publishing deal for a sequel to his 1963 novel &quot;The Graduate,&quot; .<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Home School&quot; picks up the lives of Braddock and Elaine about 10 years on, living in upstate New York with their two children and trying to keep Mrs. Robinson at bay.<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Home School&quot; is based on Webb&#39;s own experience of pulling his children out of the California school system in the 1970s. <br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Not a lot of people picked up on it, but the title of &#39;The Graduate&#39; was supposed to convey it was about education,&quot; he said. &quot;Benjamin is disenchanted with education, and once his kids enter the system he finds it intolerable.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  Random House said it planned to publish the book in Britain in June 2007.<br/>
