<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409653730">Wow. More really helpful responses. I&#39;m grateful and will re-read the  <br/>
last bunch of posts often. Just want to clarify: I have no interest in  <br/>
following the school department&#39;s requirements -- but I do have to gain  <br/>
approval of an ed plan and submit a progress report at the end of the  <br/>
year. I&#39;m only interested in making sure I&#39;m free to homeschool. So  <br/>
either I have to do stuff that they consider equivalent in nature (but  <br/>
not identical), or I have to be able to explain what we really do in a  <br/>
way that satisfies their criteria. When the kids were younger, it was  <br/>
easier to take an unschooling month and find so much stuff in it that  <br/>
was &quot;equivalent in nature&quot; to what the schools expected. As they get  <br/>
older, it gets a lot harder to pull that kind of terminology out of  <br/>
what we really do. Though, again, I&#39;ve got no problem doing that in  <br/>
certain curricular categories, but quite a bit of a problem in the  <br/>
other ones. Personally, if I didn&#39;t have to report, we&#39;d never think  <br/>
again about those categories!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to make sure you get where that pressure is coming from.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: college and rich environment<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the encouraging words. I am a worrier, and I feel better! My<br/>
&gt; husband is a librarian and where he worked (at the Boston Public<br/>
&gt; Library -- he&#39;s a curator at a private institution now) you need an MLS<br/>
&gt; to be considered a &quot;professional.&quot;  I believe most of the big research<br/>
&gt; libraries are the same. But I was clueless about smaller libraries. I<br/>
&gt; guess the trade-off would be salary, as always! But that&#39;s often a<br/>
&gt; worthwhile trade if everything else falls into place, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, these guys know all about what&#39;s out there to explore -- we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not far from Boston and the local support groups organize stuff all the<br/>
&gt; time. We just don&#39;t tend to hook up with them much anymore. But we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; certainly not isolated, either. My oldest does volunteer at 2 libraries<br/>
&gt; so she&#39;s getting experience. Joanne got the science thing, alright.<br/>
&gt; Fear of spiders and bees has kept us out of nature for the last bunch<br/>
&gt; of years, so the first part of the year was spent trying to work<br/>
&gt; through curriculum stuff because the kids thought that would be a good<br/>
&gt; way to &quot;get some science.&quot; But it goes against all of our grain and we<br/>
&gt; just plain dropped it. We&#39;re starting to explore (like, this is our<br/>
&gt; first week!) the many videos and NOVA programs that don&#39;t include<br/>
&gt; arachnids or blood and guts (that takes a little research).  And I<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;re actually liking it. I certainly am, so maybe that helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I guess it&#39;s okay to ignore all the stuff about your kids needing to<br/>
&gt; be well-rounded and let them round themselves however they like<br/>
&gt; (barring requirements from the school dept.)? They are basically<br/>
&gt; happier, and will be happier and happier the less we feel obligated to<br/>
&gt; do stuff...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for you thoughts --<br/>
&gt; Julia<br/>
&gt; p.s. we&#39;re working on that physical activity thing, too!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In answer to Jill&#39;s question about Model United Nations: They happen<br/>
&gt; all over the country, usually organized by the political science<br/>
&gt; departments of various colleges. They have them at both the Middle<br/>
&gt; School and High School levels -- teams (which might represent several<br/>
&gt; countries) are usually formed at schools, but we have a homeschooling<br/>
&gt; group preparing for and participating in them. This year we&#39;re doing 2<br/>
&gt; different MUN&#39;s in a year. I think it basically took one homeschooling<br/>
&gt; mom&#39;s total diligence and devotion to make it happen here. She first<br/>
&gt; taught an Introduction to the UN course, and followed with a course to<br/>
&gt; prepare kids for the actual MUN. Now she repeats the process every year<br/>
&gt; and we&#39;re all eternally grateful to her! She also dovetailed in a trip<br/>
&gt; to NYC to the United Nations, including 2 days of meetings with<br/>
&gt; officials and NGO&#39;s (Non-governmental organizations recognized by the<br/>
&gt; UN).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you get more specifically interested, I can pass along your e-mail<br/>
&gt; to her so you can connect for info/advise...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could be so wrong about this, but I like it so I&#39;ll share!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I heard that &quot;well-rounded&quot; came from the days of the leisure upper   <br/>
&gt; classes.<br/>
&gt;  They had little else to do with their time except learn to make  good  <br/>
&gt; social<br/>
&gt; conversation.  Being a well-rounded person, being able to  converse on  <br/>
&gt; a wide<br/>
&gt; range of topics, was important (so you weren&#39;t bored  stiff!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The middle classes always wanted what the upper had, so when the middle<br/>
&gt; class started to become &quot;educated&quot;, they believed they wanted  <br/>
&gt; well-rounded  too.<br/>
&gt; Plus, it is a great time filler in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So well-rounded, unless it is a personal goal, is just an intellectual<br/>
&gt; superiority complex and a keep-up-with-the-jones&#39; mentality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leslie in SC, brought up to be well-rounded (and achieved it   <br/>
&gt; physically!)<br/>

&gt; Ooh.....you&#39;re including requirements from the school dept.? Yuck!!<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not going to bring you any closer to unschooling Julie. Try<br/>
&gt; to live as though school didn&#39;t exist, including<br/>
&gt; their &quot;requirements&quot;, which even schooled kids may not understand!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re trying to keep school requirements in your lives, that<br/>
&gt; would probably keep you from enjoying LIFE. Unschoolers have decided<br/>
&gt; that school requirements STOP learning from happening, why would we<br/>
&gt; want to hang onto any of it?<br/>

&gt; Subject: What is &quot;well rounded&quot; anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is interesting that this has come up. I recently was part of an  <br/>
&gt; on-line<br/>
&gt; conversation on a non-unschooling homeschool list about unschooling.  <br/>
&gt; It was<br/>
&gt; brought up because of an article I was part of in the local paper about<br/>
&gt; unschooling. The conversation was very respectful which isn&#39;t always  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; case on non-unschooling lists...anyway, being &quot;well rounded&quot; was  <br/>
&gt; brought up<br/>
&gt; and discussed. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve run into that concern in  <br/>
&gt; regards to<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  The concern expressed was basically &quot;if I don&#39;t force my  <br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; to learn certain things, they will not be &#39;well rounded&#39;&quot; We discussed  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; definition of &#39;well rounded&#39; which of course, had different meanings to<br/>
&gt; different people so defining our meanings cleared up a lot. It seems  <br/>
&gt; to me<br/>
&gt; that in this day and age it is impossible to know &#39;a little about<br/>
&gt; everything&#39; (one of the definitions that was used) and being exposed to<br/>
&gt; different things, places, people, etc is going to be limited to some  <br/>
&gt; degree<br/>
&gt; by one&#39;s income, location, interests, etc. regardless of how one is<br/>
&gt; educated. I&#39;m not particularly worried about my kids being &#39;well  <br/>
&gt; rounded&#39;.<br/>
&gt; My kids have areas of interest they pursue...but because of friends,  <br/>
&gt; my own<br/>
&gt; interests, activities they&#39;re involved in, they become exposed to  <br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; they wouldn&#39;t on their own.  They are more &#39;well rounded&#39; than some,  <br/>
&gt; less<br/>
&gt; than others....but what seems right for us at this time.  So though  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; worried about it, I find it an interesting topic of conversation and<br/>
&gt; thought.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, first of all, dividing the world in to science and not-science  <br/>
&gt; just won&#39;t work with unschooling. Everything is science. To &quot;not do  <br/>
&gt; science&quot; because it&#39;s bugs and blood....yikes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just because you have aversions to bugs and blood---well, science  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t just insects and the circulatory system! There&#39;s botany and  <br/>
&gt; physics and geology and astronomy and chemistry and......and each of  <br/>
&gt; those can be broken down into smaller -ologies. Isn&#39;t there even  <br/>
&gt; LIBRARY SCIENCE?? I&#39;m sure you could find one that would satisfy the  <br/>
&gt; school board of you *had* to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cooking is commonly used as &quot;science&quot; by homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an unschooler, though, I can see that making &quot;Stone Soup&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; *just* &quot;science&quot;----it&#39;s chemistry, of course, but it&#39;s also full of  <br/>
&gt; art, history, literature, sociology, math, biology,----possibly even  <br/>
&gt; foreign language/customs, depending on the soup!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I guess it&#39;s okay to ignore all the stuff about your kids  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needing to be well-rounded and let them round themselves however  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they like (barring requirements from the school dept.)? They are  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basically happier, and will be happier and happier the less we  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feel obligated to do stuff...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you actually KNOW an adult who is well-rounded? My dad is about the  <br/>
&gt; closest to well-rounded that I know---kind of a renaissance man----but  <br/>
&gt; he is totally in the dark when I talk about John Holt (or unschooling)  <br/>
&gt; or bees or a poodle&#39;s pompons! He&#39;s NOT well-rounded in *my* world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would be a fish out of water at a NASCAR event---and that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; not part of my world. I&#39;m not well-rounded when it comes to NASCAR.  <br/>
&gt; But if I wanted to be (let&#39;s say I divorced and married Mario  <br/>
&gt; Andretti&#39;s grandson---you can tell how out of the loop I AM! &lt;g&gt; OHOH!  <br/>
&gt; Jeff Gordon---he&#39;s one, right? &lt;g&gt;), I could probably learn myself  <br/>
&gt; right into that world in no time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Each person&#39;s world is different. Well-rounded has nothing to do with  <br/>
&gt; anything because...well, life (and the world) changes. It used to be  <br/>
&gt; important to know how to chop wood properly. Well, lots of folks have  <br/>
&gt; no need of wood. Do I still need to know how? Am I not well-rounded if  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how? In Montana, maybe!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (barring requirements from the school dept.)? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Too much school talk! There&#39;s NOTHING they can require that you can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; provide just by living. Honestly! My kids can cover more in one day  <br/>
&gt; than a school can cover in a week. We just look at things in a  <br/>
&gt; different way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Start looking at your world with unschooling eyes and you&#39;ll be able  <br/>
&gt; top see the art and literature and chemistry and biology and physics  <br/>
&gt; and history and life and love in a pot of soup!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My children are sleeping later and later in the mornings. I have<br/>
&gt; been trying to give unschooling a chance so we can both learn more<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt; They go to bed usually at 9pm and don&#39;t awake until 9am.<br/>
&gt; So I decided to have bed time earlier, 7:30pm, for the past 2 days.<br/>
&gt; They are waking at 8am. It takes them about a half hour to be up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then to eat and get dressed, takes an hour. so by time they are<br/>
&gt; done, it will be 10:30. my kids ages are 10,3,1. the 3 and 1 year<br/>
&gt; old NEEDS to go down for a nap by 1:30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to start cooking by 3pm.I work in the evenings when my<br/>
&gt; husband comes home so I want to do things with them in the mornings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The little time we get between 10:30-12 is spent fussing over who<br/>
&gt; needs my attention. Because the 10 year old wants to have more of my<br/>
&gt; attention than the smaller children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also if I don&#39;t think of something to do between those times, the 10<br/>
&gt; year old either wants to watch TV or paint or play games on the<br/>
&gt; computer. My 3 year old is always so busy doing something and the<br/>
&gt; one year old follows.  Some times the 10 year old will follow the<br/>
&gt; two of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When and wheredoes the school work come in with homeschooling???<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been wondering something along these lines too.<br/>
&gt; Specifically, how would you veteran unschoolers handle a child who,  <br/>
&gt; when given total freedom to direct their own learning, will choose to  <br/>
&gt; plop down in front of the television set or their Gameboy every day,  <br/>
&gt; rather than go outdoors to inspect nature, or read a book, or do a  <br/>
&gt; baking or science project, or do any physical activity, etc.?   I  <br/>
&gt; realize television can be educational, but what if that was all the  <br/>
&gt; child ever wanted to do?  OK, I can see an obvious answer - get rid of  <br/>
&gt; the television! LOL, but seriously, even if there is no TV in your  <br/>
&gt; home, how would you handle a child who is lazy about anything to do  <br/>
&gt; with education, such as writing or reading something now and then,  <br/>
&gt; etc.?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The concern expressed was basically &quot;if I don&#39;t force my kids<br/>
&gt; to learn certain things, they will not be &#39;well rounded&#39;&quot;<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;When and wheredoes the school work come in with homeschooling???&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You said you were wanting to unschool?  There is often very little in  <br/>
&gt; unschooling that looks like schoolwork.  The kids play, paint, do  <br/>
&gt; computer stuff, explore, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May I suggest reading some books by John Holt and reading some of the  <br/>
&gt; essays at www.unschooling.com<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   My children are sleeping later and later in the mornings. I have<br/>
&gt;   been trying to give unschooling a chance so we can both learn more<br/>
&gt;   about it.<br/>
&gt;   They go to bed usually at 9pm and don&#39;t awake until 9am.<br/>
&gt;   So I decided to have bed time earlier, 7:30pm, for the past 2 days.<br/>
&gt;   They are waking at 8am. It takes them about a half hour to be up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Then to eat and get dressed, takes an hour. so by time they are<br/>
&gt;   done, it will be 10:30. my kids ages are 10,3,1. the 3 and 1 year<br/>
&gt;   old NEEDS to go down for a nap by 1:30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have to start cooking by 3pm.I work in the evenings when my<br/>
&gt;   husband comes home so I want to do things with them in the mornings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The little time we get between 10:30-12 is spent fussing over who<br/>
&gt;   needs my attention. Because the 10 year old wants to have more of my<br/>
&gt;   attention than the smaller children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Also if I don&#39;t think of something to do between those times, the 10<br/>
&gt;   year old either wants to watch TV or paint or play games on the<br/>
&gt;   computer. My 3 year old is always so busy doing something and the<br/>
&gt;   one year old follows.  Some times the 10 year old will follow the<br/>
&gt;   two of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   When and wheredoes the school work come in with homeschooling???<br/>

you&#39;re giving them more information than you need to in your progress<br/>

There are links to two more at the bottom of that page.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I sent 2 years ago when she was in &quot;6th grade&quot;. I don&#39;t plan to<br/>
do anything differently when she&#39;s in high school -- except divide it up<br/>
into different subjects ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reading:  Reading an adult level book slowly. Comprehends well and reads<br/>
&gt; complex instructions for meaning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Writing, spelling, grammar: Nintendo Writing Class and Dungeons and Dragons<br/>
&gt; Writing Class. Also continues to write prolifically, both comic books and<br/>
&gt; beginning to dabble in fiction writing. Spelling is decent. She seems to have<br/>
&gt; more problems with common words (such as spelling never as neaver) that she¹s<br/>
&gt; been spelling wrong long enough that the wrong spelling look familiar than new<br/>
&gt; and more complex words. But even the misspelling of familiar words are<br/>
&gt; becoming fewer with time. She loves the spell checker on the computer which is<br/>
&gt; probably responsible for improvement of her spelling of common words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Science: Pony care camp, gardening. Fascinated by anthropology and delving<br/>
&gt; into that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Math: Programming games which involves algebra. Origami for geometry. Working<br/>
&gt; her way through a computer Algebra program and a beginning Algebra book with<br/>
&gt; her father.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; History/Social studies: Beginning Century Kids series that will follow an<br/>
&gt; American family decade by decade from 1900 to 2000. World mythology. Dabbling<br/>
&gt; in both American and history of Western Civilization. Did a lot of traveling:<br/>
&gt; LA, Albequerque, South Carolina, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Las Vegas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Health:  Becoming personally aware and concerned about nutrition and exercise.<br/>
&gt; Working on increasing her endurance by jogging around the track.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Art and music: Drawing nearly every day. Listening to a variety of music,<br/>
&gt; getting into parodies which sparks a curiosity about the originals.<br/>
