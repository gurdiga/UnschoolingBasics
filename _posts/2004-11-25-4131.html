<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254377258">Greetings to Everyone, <br/>
My name is Gia and I am mamma to two boys 9mo and 3.5<br/>
years.  We joined this list because I do not intend on<br/>
sending my children to school and I am not organized<br/>
enough to &quot;school at home&quot; LOL.  My dh is a musician<br/>
and he travels alot.  We are hoping that our family<br/>
will be able to join him in the near future.  I am in<br/>
grad school studying anthro/urban studies.  We are<br/>
typical AP parents I suppose.  I do extended<br/>
breastfeeding/child-led weaning.  My oldest was 3 when<br/>
he weaned.  We co sleep, don&#39;t vaccinate or circumsize<br/>
and try our best to live simply so that we can<br/>
personally impact the planet and raise eco conscious<br/>
children.  It is difficult sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
My mother( as a single parent) unschooled my now 20<br/>
year old sister.  She didn&#39;t know that there was a<br/>
name for what she was doing she just knew it wasn&#39;t<br/>
quite homeschooling.  After reading Holt, Hygeia<br/>
Halfmoon, Jean Liedloff I was happy with my decision<br/>
to homeschool, but as I began reading more I realized<br/>
that this would not suffice.  My oldest you see is<br/>
very SPIRITED to say the least.  I am here to learn<br/>
more, release control over my children&#39;s learning<br/>
process, share and support others in their vision.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now my dh is in NYC and we are in New Olreans so<br/>
I have been a single mother for the past three months,<br/>
I am tired, I have school, and I take my baby to class<br/>
with me so I would like to learn more about how to<br/>
balance my children with school or career and my<br/>
marriage as a young mother- whew that&#39;s about it I<br/>
just wanted to introduce our family to the boards. Oh<br/>
and if there is anyone in NYC that I can connect<br/>
withthat would be great too!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gia- just happy to be alive :)<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re over on Staten Island. You&#39;re welcome to email<br/>
me offlist if you&#39;d like. I&#39;m in NC on vacation right<br/>
now, and we&#39;re quite possibly moving back down here in<br/>
about a month, but maybe we can meet and say hello if<br/>
the move doesn&#39;t go through. <br/>
