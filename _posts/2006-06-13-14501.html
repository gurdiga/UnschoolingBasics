<div id="ygrps-yiv-814148114">I just went back and looked at the archives to find the original <br/>
post.  As I feared, this one post morphed into a myriad of topics <br/>
which becomes vague and concerns and points get lost.  I think I <br/>
mixed up a few different people in all my responses so maybe my <br/>
posts weren&#39;t as helpful as I hoped they&#39;d be.<br/>
<br/>
How about we just start all over again?  But instead of just asking <br/>
lots of &#39;what if&#39; questions over and over, let us open a true <br/>
discussion.  I may be living a radical unschooling life with my <br/>
children right not but there are doubts still lingering and I <br/>
imagine they&#39;ll always be there.  That&#39;s my personality, to worry <br/>
about things.  My DH says if there is nothing to worry about, I&#39;ll <br/>
create something.  :)<br/>
<br/>
In my own mind, I am not in the least bit worried about Math or <br/>
Grammar.  I am positive my kids will learn what they need to learn <br/>
for whatever reason.  If they decide to take the SAT they can study <br/>
the prep books.  I just don&#39;t see a need for Math and Grammar, day <br/>
after day, year after year.<br/>
<br/>
However, my biggest worry is Writing.  But that is a hangup within <br/>
myself.  My high school did not prepare me well in that subject.  <br/>
When I went to college, I absolutely hated Writing assignments.  I <br/>
flat out refused to do any research reports because I had no idea <br/>
how to do them.  It felt overwhelming.  So I dropped classes instead <br/>
of learning how to do the work.  I just feel it was the coward&#39;s way <br/>
out.  I don&#39;t want my children to feel the same way.  During the <br/>
times we&#39;ve been homeschooling with curriculum, I pushed Writing <br/>
more than anything else.  I no longer push it, but it does sit in <br/>
the back of my mind.  I&#39;m just telling myself over and over... My <br/>
kids will show me what they want when they want.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you unschool they shouldn&#39;t because writing assignments are never<br/>
going to be viewed in the same way in which you viewed them.  If you<br/>
live your life fully, follow your passions and are constantly seeking<br/>
new information then you ARE doing research &quot;reports.&quot;  Especially if<br/>
you are coming back here and expressing your findings!  :-)  If you<br/>
strew for your kids and teach your kids to strew then that is just a<br/>
form of research!<br/>
<br/>
I think we all have our fears and concerns that are related to our own<br/>
disasterous school experiences.  Mine is math because I was always<br/>
told that I wasn&#39;t &quot;math smart.&quot;  I learned the numerals 4 and 5<br/>
backwards so I made horrid mistakes all the way through 8th grade<br/>
(when a really good teacher figured it out for me!).  I can remember<br/>
my teachers telling my mom, &quot;She just doesn&#39;t get it.  Sometimes I<br/>
think she understands a mathematical concept and then she blows a huge<br/>
test.  She just isn&#39;t &#39;math smart.&#39;&quot;  I always thought I understood<br/>
the concepts but when I would do poorly on a test I would doubt<br/>
myself.  Now that my children are asking me 1,982 math questions a day<br/>
I have come to realize that I truly do understand a lot more about<br/>
math than I was lead to believe.  But that &quot;not math smart&quot; still runs<br/>
through my head.  I know that it is *my* problem, so I try not to<br/>
stress about my children&#39;s &quot;lack of formal math education.&quot;  Heck,<br/>
they probably understand these math concepts better than I do because<br/>
they aren&#39;t hindered by the things that hindered me!<br/>

<br/>
 Writers write.<br/>
<br/>
  Just as *you* are writing now, so will your kids when they are ready. <br/>
Or not.<br/>
<br/>
  Making them write will not make them *want* to write. Nor will it make <br/>
them good writers.<br/>
<br/>
  But making sure that the opportunities when they *do* choose to write <br/>
are pleasant and enjoyable may plant writing &#39;seeds&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 Many people never find a need to write. Those that do, will.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
