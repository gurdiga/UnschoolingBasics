<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953084429">As others have, I wanted to share our great day.  We have our best friends<br/>
visiting from the SF area this week.  All of our kids and their kids are<br/>
into Webkinz, so their kids brought their Webkinz toys down.  Yesterday<br/>
afternoon they decided they were going to have a Webkinz party.  My oldest<br/>
daughter Heather, 11, made a yellow layer cake from scratch, a Cooks&#39;<br/>
Illustrated recipe, and they spent the evening planning.<br/>
<br/>
This morning they arranged an intricate party, all of the girls dressed up<br/>
in floatie dresses (skirts hiked up to their armpits and bound with various<br/>
silks).  Heather made a veggie tray, a fruit tray, and a cheese tray, and<br/>
punch, and dusted her frosted cake with powdered sugar.  My 9 yr old<br/>
daughter created a &quot;pin the tail on the cat&quot; game and a collage for the<br/>
partygoers to assemble.  They of course arranged all of the stuffed animals,<br/>
including mine (they got me two Webkinz for xmas so I can play with them).  <br/>
<br/>
There was an impromptu break in the middle of the party for them to all go<br/>
run around outside.  We live on a small 2.6 acre farm and the sunroom that<br/>
the party was in overlooks an acre of pasture that I guess was too inviting!<br/>
<br/>
Then they were back in for cake and punch.  Elvis was, of course, playing on<br/>
the CD (we are the ones who made the trip to the Elvis Quiz Show last<br/>
month).  All of the six kids paired off and were dancing to some of his<br/>
slower songs - my oldest daughter with my 4 yr old son, my daughter Isabella<br/>
with my son Luke (in itself amazing as they were intensely engaged in<br/>
sibling rivalry six months ago), and our guest boy and girl.  <br/>
<br/>
After playing outside on our boulders (a 30&#39; wonderful plateau) and then<br/>
inside for the next couple of hours, they all found themselves gathered on<br/>
the front pasture again.  I had bought a bag of grass seed designed for<br/>
horses, and they decided to go throw the seed on the pasture.  Since the CA<br/>
storms are past and the ground is damp it&#39;s a perfect time to spread the<br/>
seed.  I was in the kitchen making stew for supper and enjoying the sight of<br/>
them darting about the pasture.  Our guest&#39;s daughter had a white gauzy<br/>
skirt/dress, and she looked like a sprite dashing down the hill.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls came inside and took a shower (all 3 together), then put on sweats<br/>
and were back outside with the boys.  The next thing I saw they were all<br/>
log-rolling down the pasture, over and over.<br/>
<br/>
I put some apple cider on the stove to heat up, and when it got dark they<br/>
all trooped in, got a mug of cider, and sat down to Shrek 3.  Of course more<br/>
miscellaneous playing and Webkinz play happened until they all were tired.<br/>
<br/>
It just seemed like &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot; - a day filled with fun with their<br/>
best friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9158285">It sounds like a wonderful day!  Don&#39;t you just love the days that<br/>
make you say to yourself &quot;given the chance and unlimited funds I would<br/>
do nothing different from what I am doing this moment!&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
I love the &quot;best day ever&quot; comment.... My highly intense 6 yr old son<br/>
says that 4 or 5 times a week (along with &quot;you&#39;re the best mom ever!&quot;<br/>
 )  it really reminds me of how little &quot;stuff&quot; kids need and how much<br/>
&quot;us&quot; they do need!   Most of his &quot;best days ever&quot; are simple days<br/>
filled with simple things where we are all engaged in being together<br/>
and just enjoying life!<br/>
