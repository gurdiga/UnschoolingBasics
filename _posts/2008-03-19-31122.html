<br/>
How old is your son?  If he&#39;s &quot;mature&quot; enough you could enroll him in<br/>
an adult continuing ed class with you.  My little brother and my mom<br/>
took accounting together when Brian was 12.  Maybe this would give him<br/>
the &quot;feel&quot; he thinks he needs?  Or maybe you could get him some Sylvan<br/>
tutoring the beauty of that is I think you can turn it on and off at<br/>
will (you&#39;d have to check if they have a long term contract) but then<br/>
he&#39;d see what he knows and what he doesn&#39;t.  Or he can be taught in a<br/>
schooly way if he thinks he&#39;s missing that but it wouldn&#39;t be school.<br/>
You could just do like an hour a week.  Or maybe get him a tutor from<br/>
a local college to come to the house to tutor him.  If you think he<br/>
just wants to try it out this might be a good compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ignore if that&#39;s not going to work for your boy.  Just<br/>
random ideas I had but may also not be unschooly enough.  My kids<br/>
haven&#39;t been asking for math.  They want a compound microscope and<br/>
agar plates.  =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180277033">Been there. Done that.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron felt the same way. I contacted Pam Sorooshian about some books <br/>
that might make him feel better---&#39;cause, well, that&#39;s what he asked <br/>
for. But Cam was 18-ish, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Math for Dummies, All the Math You&#39;ll Ever Need---and one more, but I <br/>
can&#39;t remember its name. I&#39;ve heard The Math Devil is fun, but we don&#39;t <br/>
have that one.<br/>
<br/>
He went through two of them, did several of the problems and realized <br/>
that he&#39;s just fine. &lt;g&gt; He made plenty of mistakes; but after looking <br/>
at the answers, he knew where he went wrong. It helped him understand <br/>
some concepts.<br/>
<br/>
For Cam, it was more about reassuring himself, I think. As soon as he <br/>
was satisfied, it became a non-issue again.<br/>
<br/>
It was a much bigger deal when he was younger. At 13, 14, and 15, he <br/>
really thought he was stupid---and would always be stupid because he <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;do math&quot; and because I didn&#39;t make him read. I asked whether he <br/>
thought doing math worksheets would make him smarter. He said no. &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
asked whether he thought he would like to read more if I made him. He <br/>
said no. &lt;g&gt; I also (as you did) told him all the different ways he WAS <br/>
being exposed to math. That wasn&#39;t the same to him either.<br/>
<br/>
It was important to me that he not think that school learning was the <br/>
best/only way to learn. But I&#39;d done plenty of damage when he was <br/>
younger by telling him that school was his &quot;job&quot; and all that. Plus, he <br/>
had all his schooled friends who were always busy &quot;studying.&quot; How could <br/>
he ever be as smart &#39;cause all *he* did all day was play? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It took time. It&#39;s been really good for him to see Duncan&#39;s progress <br/>
withOUT school. He also knows NOW that he has his entire life to learn <br/>
WHATEVER he wants to. He knows NOW that he&#39;s a passionate learner. <br/>
Didn&#39;t help his teen years though! Just so much comparing that goes on <br/>
in those years! He&#39;s come out the other side very confident that he CAN <br/>
learn though---and that&#39;s *wonderful* for me to see! (Him too, I guess! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot stress enough how empowering an unschooling conference can be <br/>
for him as well as you!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing---and becoming friends with---other unschoolers shows them that <br/>
they are not always &quot;on the outside.&quot; He can meet older unschoolers who <br/>
have never had a &quot;math lesson&quot;---and he&#39;ll see that, not only has it <br/>
not held them back, they are amazingly smart and comfortable with Who <br/>
They Are.<br/>
<br/>
Try, try, TRY to get to one, if at all possible. It&#39;s a great <br/>
jump-start!<br/>

DD wanted something and we looked around and she picked Singapore Math and we ordered a few and after she blew through the workbooks and felt she had caught herself up to what she had in mind, she put them aside and is doing other things. For now anyway. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087669007">How old is your son? I&#39;ve read that the male brain experiences a  <br/>
growth spurt in the &quot;math side&quot; earlier on in development. He might  <br/>
be craving more challenges in this area and thinks a workbook could  <br/>
provide them because he believes the kids going to school are  <br/>
&quot;specializing&quot; in it in a sense. I&#39;m new to these boards and am no  <br/>
expert, but it seems that the philosophy of unschooling is to trust  <br/>
whatever our children are interested in and to go with it (unless  <br/>
it&#39;s jumping off a 500-foot-high cliff into jagged rocks below,  <br/>
without a parachute). Of course, it&#39;s important to question and  <br/>
discuss everything--and you&#39;re doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I know an independent-thinking, multi-faceted woman-- <br/>
I&#39;ll call her Bee--who was unschooled from birth for several years  <br/>
until she started coveting her friends&#39; school workbooks. Months  <br/>
later, she had one burning, relentless desire: to go to public  <br/>
school. Her mom resisted for a long time but eventually gave in  <br/>
because, she said, she realized she was being conditional with a  <br/>
philosophy that was, at its core, unconditional. Bee went to school  <br/>
and LOVED it--she says she loved the structure, the workbooks, the  <br/>
predictability, the assignments, the homework, and all that stuff  <br/>
that I personally HATED when I went to school. To this day Bee thanks  <br/>
her mom, and her mom says, half-jokingly, &quot;Well, we unschooled when  <br/>
she wasn&#39;t in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not telling this story because I think your son&#39;s interest in  <br/>
workbooks will lead to a serious desire to go to school. I just think  <br/>
the story illustrates why it&#39;s important to have an open mind and  <br/>
trust our children to show us how to do things their way, all the  <br/>
while keeping our own beliefs intact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002094565">We found a book at the bookstore that was sort of an overall &#39;guide&#39; to<br/>
arithmetic - it started at counting and went up through probability and<br/>
such. Just little topical blurbs - roughly a paragraph of text and<br/>
examples (a tad more for some concepts). It&#39;s designed more to just<br/>
&quot;review&quot; the information but DS has found it helpful whenever he decides<br/>
he wants some &quot;number questions&quot; - I write out the questions and<br/>
parenthetically note which page in the guide has more information if he<br/>
needs it. Wish I could remember what it was called but it was in the<br/>
Math section of the children&#39;s section at Borders.<br/>

We were there looking for Sir Cumference and the First Round Table<br/>

which is a lot of fun).<br/>

after watching me signing checks. I showed him a little and he wanted <br/>
more. So, we went out and got a couple simple &quot;guides&quot; to help - he <br/>
helped me pick them out at the bookstore. Another 20 minutes or so <br/>
and he was done with it - but we still have that stuff around should <br/>
he want it again. Likewise, we have a few &quot;math&quot; workbook type things <br/>
we&#39;ve picked up over the last few years as DS has said he wanted <br/>
more &quot;number&quot; stuff and more &quot;math&quot;. It&#39;s there for him to use or not <br/>
use at will and it does go in cycles. He&#39;ll be heavily into something <br/>
for a time then it sits and collects dust for a while then he&#39;ll go <br/>
back to it and around it goes. Kind of like a spiral staircase.<br/>

<br/>
Interestingly, I just went through this with Naturalist.  It hasn&#39;t come up before, since I <br/>
don&#39;t compare what we do with any other &#39;grade&#39; or &#39;school&#39; or &#39;person&#39;.  But, Golfer and <br/>
she were working on something having to do with math and he said something like, &quot;You <br/>
don&#39;t know how to do this?  Everyone else can.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
After reminding him that everyone learns things at different times, I then found her crying <br/>
really hard and panicking about being behind everyone.  :(  I think she had flashbacks of <br/>
3rd grade.  :(  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been finding math game and puzzle books on sale recently at Borders, and so we&#39;ve <br/>
begun doing that together during the day.  Her dyslexia makes math difficult--not <br/>
conceptually, but on the written page--and working it out in puzzles is tolerable and <br/>
actually fun.  <br/>
<br/>
In the school world, so much is based on performance, comparison, and feeling superior <br/>
to other people.  The attitude is very stark for my kids, especially when we work so hard to <br/>
make a little haven of acceptance, respect, and cooperation in our home.  I&#39;m hoping that <br/>
they are learning to stand up for themselves and everyone&#39;s differences when they&#39;re with <br/>
their schooly friends, but sometimes they feel insecure about it.  <br/>
<br/>
This didn&#39;t really have any suggestions, but just wanted to say &#39;I feel ya!&#39; on this one.<br/>
