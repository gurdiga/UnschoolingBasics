<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016446381">Summoning Ren!!  My sister, Ren, is very good at this sort of <br/>
advice!  I will give it my best shot though.  I do think that moving <br/>
into the radical part of unschooling needs to be done slowly and <br/>
with much thought, kind of slithering into it at a natural pace.  <br/>
For our family it was a slow process simply because I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>
it all at once, it just seemed to happen naturally, for the most <br/>
part.  I think kids do better when they know what to expect and when <br/>
you just do 180 degree shift they don&#39;t know what is going on.  I <br/>
like to think of myself as someone who helps guide my children into <br/>
the things that feel right for them, and helping them to know what <br/>
their bodies are telling them and how to listen to that.  I also <br/>
like to think as a team, in that we have to work together so that <br/>
everyone is happy and joyful; sometimes that means not always <br/>
getting exactly what you want, but enough of what you wanted that <br/>
your joy is not taken.  Does that make sense?  Letting your children <br/>
do whatever they want, at the expense of others emotional well-being <br/>
is not healthy.  <br/>
<br/>
*Ds (5) digss up all the shale from the back path to make a volcano.<br/>
DH and I both have strong feelings but work it through had allow him<br/>
to proceed without dumping any further judgment on him.*<br/>
<br/>
Could you have found other materials for him that would have pleased <br/>
him just as much, allowed him to do his project, and not destroyed <br/>
your path in the process?<br/>
<br/>
*Another episode, DS is<br/>
now choosing to stay up very late (way past us guessing 3:00 a.m. or<br/>
so) and is sleeping past noon. When we wake him for his horseback<br/>
riding lesson he is angry that he has been woken. Now dh and I are<br/>
wondering if we are doing the wrong thing allowing him to choose<br/>
when he is sleeping half the day and so cranky. *<br/>
<br/>
Are there things you can do to help him wind down earlier and <br/>
make &quot;bed-time&quot; a WONDERFUL time of the day so that he wants to go <br/>
to bed?  I think at 5 years old it is very hard for them to listen <br/>
to their bodies, I think that comes with age and experience.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be a thing where you say &quot;You have to go to bed now&quot; <br/>
but just helping to guide him and helping him to listen to his <br/>
body.  It also isn&#39;t safe for a 5 year old to be up by himself <br/>
unless there is someone up with him.<br/>
<br/>
*Another episode, ds<br/>
goes to store and gets overstimulated (my fault ad choice for him)<br/>
and climbs up the metal staircase for employees and won&#39;t get down.<br/>
Then when he does runs all over the store as I try to chase him (and<br/>
catch him). *<br/>
<br/>
We have all had episodes like this, it is part of having little <br/>
children.  I either wait when I know my kids are going to handle it <br/>
well or I wait until my dh is home with them.  When my kids were <br/>
little my husband did all the shopping on his way home from work.  <br/>
Another thing you can do is have a little bag with drawing stuff, <br/>
little wind up toys, little hand puzzles and such that you save just <br/>
for errands like the store.  <br/>
<br/>
*Another episode, after dinner Ds wants<br/>
me to play tag (again) with he and his friend. I say (which is<br/>
consistent on my part) that after dinner mommy likes to wind down.<br/>
I like to read and be quieter and get ready for bed.*<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much advice on this one except sometimes we do have to <br/>
buck up because the kids are only little once and there will be a <br/>
day when you wish you could play tag again.  The other thing is to <br/>
talk, talk, talk so that he understands your need to settle down <br/>
after dinner.  I have that problem later in the night.  I need to <br/>
read before I fall asleep, it is my way to settle down.  My kids <br/>
know that when it comes around 10:00 mom is in her room settling <br/>
down and if they need something they should probably ask before <br/>
then.  We have been through it enough times that they just know <br/>
now.  I usually do the 1/2 hr reminder, &quot;okay, mom is headed to the <br/>
bedroom, anyone need anything before I settle down?&quot;  Of course, <br/>
they know if there is something important, that they can&#39;t handle on <br/>
their own, I will be there. <br/>
<br/>
Remember too that it takes time for kids to listen to their bodies <br/>
and to recognize what they need and how to go about getting it when <br/>
they have been told what to do and how to do it before.  They learn <br/>
a lot from our model too.  I have other thoughts but at this time I <br/>
can&#39;t find the words for them so let me dwell on them for a while.  <br/>
Hang in there!!!!!  The other thing that helped me A LOT is to read, <br/>
read, read!!!  Anything that had to do with unschooling or gentle <br/>
parenting, I read!!  My favorite when we first started transitioning <br/>
to radical unschooling was Living Joyfully With Children.  I am <br/>
beyond it now but at the time it really helped with transitioning, <br/>
especially with my thinking.  I recommended that to someone else so <br/>
forgive me if that was you and I am repeating myself.<br/>

Something we do at our house, which has worked well for everyone, is, we  <br/>
have a routine where my middle child gets ready for bed at 7:30, and we go in  <br/>
and sing her a song (both older kids still request &quot;Hush Little Baby&quot; :)), and  <br/>
then she is allowed some books, toys, something of HER choosing, and she can  <br/>
quietly do that in bed. She still needs to fall asleep with her light on, so <br/>
she  will quietly amuse herself until she falls asleep. She&#39;s usually out by 9. <br/>
Our  son, same deal. He gets ready for bed at 8, we sing and then he picks  <br/>
some books, toys or whatever to play with quietly. He usually engrosses himself <br/>
 in LeapPad or something else like that. And he calls us when he&#39;s done and <br/>
wants  his light out. He&#39;s usually done by 10.<br/>
The kids are happy and DH and I are happy because we still get time to  <br/>
ourselves to do as we please too. We&#39;ve never had a complaint about going to bed  <br/>
in the house.  <br/>

<br/>
One thing that is very helpful here is a foot massage.  The kids ask me every night.  I ask them to take a bath so their feet are clean and to meet me on the couch.  We watch tv while I massage their feet.  Normally, the kids are asleep before I finish and I just carry them to bed.<br/>
