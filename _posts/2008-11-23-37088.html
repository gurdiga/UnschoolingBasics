<div id="ygrps-yiv-759188765">Hi all,<br/>
I am Lynn and am new to this group.  I have a question to start off with.  You may want to refer me to some older posts or files if this has already been discussed.<br/>
How do I fulfill the state requirement of composition and literature with an unschooling approach?<br/>
Thanks to all,<br/>
Lynn </div>

 </span></blockquote>What is legally required in your state? Do you have to turn in <br/>
portfolio samples? If so, how much is needed? Does it have to show <br/>
simply that you&#39;ve &quot;covered&quot; the subject or does it have to <br/>
show &quot;adequate annual progress&quot;? Are there alternative assessments <br/>
available? Knowing what state you&#39;re in might surface folks who are <br/>
familiar with unschooling in your state - not all states <br/>
have &quot;requirements&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that reading anything counts as literature. Make a <br/>
list of the books that get read (some folks find that handy anyhow so <br/>
that the stuff that comes home from the library eventually gets <br/>
returned to the library). Writing anything counts as composition. <br/>
Emails, letters, stories that are made up (and you might be the <br/>
scribe taking dictation on it - handwriting is not necessary for <br/>
composition), whatever. Doesn&#39;t require any lessons. Mostly it <br/>
requires your time and energy to make lists, make copies, whatever. <br/>
It can be almost transparent to your offspring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307844026">thanks Deb!  I&#39;m feeling very encouraged b/c we already do most of those things, so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll &quot;make the grade&quot;. LOL<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Lynn<br/>
