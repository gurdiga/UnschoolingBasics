<div id="ygrps-yiv-553284803">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you know, that I gave birth last night to Benjamin<br/>
Morris at 3:21 am. He is a cutie and is nursing and doing all he is supposed<br/>
to be doing at this stage. So because of that, I am going to go no mail on<br/>
my lists for awhile as we bond as a family and figure it all out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to email me privately I will still be checking email and<br/>
when time permits I will come back to the lists as I can.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
