Could you ladies share with me some of your favorite Mindful <br/>
Parenting book titles and authors?<br/>
=====<br/>
One of my current favorite ones is a very different kind of advice book.  <br/>
It&#39;s called The Parent&#39;s Tao Te Ching - Ancient Advice for Modern Parents by <br/>
William Martin (a local unschooler/non-coercive mother recommended it to me).  <br/>
It&#39;s made up of free style type verses, and it&#39;s absolutely become my &#39;bible&#39; : ) <br/>
Whenever I&#39;m having a &#39;bad moment, I can always just open this little book <br/>
wherever it falls, and it never fails to bring me back to center.  I&#39;ll give you <br/>
an example!  I&#39;ll just open it now and share a random verse:<br/>
<br/>
Finding Balance<br/>
<br/>
There are so many paradoxes in parenting<br/>
that it is difficult to find balance.<br/>
Some don&#39;t even try.<br/>
They just plunge ahead<br/>
ignoring the subtle whispers of wisdom.<br/>
Others try half-heartedly,<br/>
but resort to old methods<br/>
when they get confused.<br/>
But some hear wisdoms&#39; quiet voice<br/>
and make it their own.<br/>
<br/>
They find strength in softness,<br/>
power in flexiblility,<br/>
prfection in mistakes,<br/>
success in failure,<br/>
clarity in confusion,<br/>
and love in letting go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444285943">My &quot;parenting bible&quot; would be &quot;Everyday Blessings, The Inner Work of <br/>
Mindful Parenting,&quot; by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn.  It continues to offer <br/>
me so much as a touchstone and source of inspiration whenever I&#39;m <br/>
feeling defeated or just plain lost.<br/>
