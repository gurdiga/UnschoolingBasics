minister with a great sense of humor. I have read a couple of the stories,<br/>
and had a good laugh. You may be interested in the, um, alternative<br/>
presentation of Scripture at  &lt;outbind://60/www.thebricktestament.com&gt;<br/>
www.thebricktestament.com. Truly, God works in mysterious  ways...<br/>

I don&#39;t think a warning is necessary ;p<br/>

My deacon, bible study goin, worship team leader of a husband showed our son<br/>
this site a while back and they both just loved it.  <br/>
