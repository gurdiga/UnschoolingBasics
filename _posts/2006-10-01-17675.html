<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097071898">The other night Tristan and I nearly pulled an all-nighter so he could make a video for his dad.  You can&#39;t pull the creative mind away from the computer for something as trivial as sleep. ;o)  He told me tonight that he wished he could send the URL to a large group of folks for their opinion....so I thought I&#39;d post it here for him. :o)<br/>

<br/>
I just finished watching the video Tristan did for his<br/>
dad.  What an awesome job he did.  I hope and pray<br/>
that your husband/his dad makes it home safe and<br/>
sound.<br/>
<br/>
Tristan is a very talented young man.  I am sure you<br/>
are very proud of him, as well as his dad is.<br/>
<br/>
My little brother just got back last year from being<br/>
in the war, in Afghanistan.  I am sure is it very hard<br/>
for you guys to be apart.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the video, and the music.  What a<br/>
great song to put with all of the pictures.<br/>

dad?  Are the pics ones his dad took or just images found online?  I<br/>
liked all the changes he used from picture to picture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334857327">Please tell Tristan that I am so very proud of him and impressed.  I have come to understand that regardless of where we stand on the war in Iraq, there are mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, PEOPLE over there.  My sister in law just returned from a year in Iraq.  Her daughter anxiously awaited her return and this video has helped me to remember the sadness I felt for them during their separation.  I am so touched by a sons love for his father.  What better hero than your own father?  SO SPECIAL!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this gift!  I hope that you continue to grow in this cinematography gift that you have, Tristan.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste and Peace<br/>

LOL, as it is in ours.  I think this night ended around 4AM, I new record I believe.    <br/>
<br/>
All the pics were either ones Jody (hubby) or other members of his squad took.  Jody is in a number of the shots, especially the series of pics towards the end of a soldier in camo but no combat gear (he was part of a supply run one day that went up to Kurdistan, a peaceful area).  The final pic on the video is also Jody. :o)  I didn&#39;t realize that Tristan had found a few videos that the squad had shot until he showed me the completed video.  In the first one they are actually being fired upon by enemy forces (thankfully Tristan didn&#39;t realize that!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342514195">Thanks Vanessa :o)<br/>
<br/>
Tristan was really happy on how it turned out and is so eager for Jody to see it.  We may have to send it along in a care package as the computers over there are giving Jody fits when it comes to downloading anything.  I know Jody will be really touched when it sees it, and the song couldn&#39;t be any more appropriate.  Tristan poured through all the pictures Jody has sent over the year and really put his heart into this project.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so thankful your brother returned to y&#39;all safe and sound.  These deployments are surely one of the most difficult things a family can endure.  We got word last night that Jody should be coming home sometime in Dec.  He&#39;s already been gone 13 1/2 months so I truly hope that is the case.<br/>

I hope and pray that your husband comes home soon. <br/>
Coming home in December would be an awesome Christmas<br/>
present.  God bless you and your family.  If there is<br/>
anything I can do for you and Tristan, please let me<br/>
know, and I will do my best.<br/>

I really wish I could see Jody&#39;s reaction when he gets to see the video for the first time.  We told him to go to the link, but I think he&#39;s probably thinking it&#39;s a silly little movie that Tristan had made....not something like this. :o)<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;ll be 10 at the end of the month.  I bet Jody is thinking the movie will be one of Tristan&#39;s crazy creations involving monster masks and cinematography reminiscent of the &quot;Blair Witch Project.&quot;  He&#39;s going to be SO surprised when he sees it. :o) :o)<br/>

My husband is in the military as well, and I got a little teary-eyed <br/>
watching the video.  I think it is just really nice that Tristan spent <br/>
so much time on it.<br/>
