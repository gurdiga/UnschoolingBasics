You know, everything&#39;s relative. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having a teen (granted, much older!) who got pierced for the first time <br/>
last year---it really seems like NOTHING now that he&#39;s contemplating <br/>
the tattoo thang next week. Two friends are going; they will all get <br/>
the same &#39;ttoo.<br/>
<br/>
I know several littluns with piercings. Duncan, at 11, says he wants no <br/>
one &quot;mutilating&quot; *his* body. But we also know that could change at any <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s military too, but he&#39;s just learned to &quot;go with the flow&quot; <br/>
about the long hair and earrings and possible tattoos. He&#39;s even <br/>
embraced them wholly. &lt;g&gt; These are NOT *our* bodies. Their bodies <br/>
belong to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My niece and Cam&#39;s girlfriend wanted tattoos and piercings that were <br/>
&quot;forbidden.&quot; Guess what? Lauren and Carly both got their tongues <br/>
pierced so that their parents would notice---and they didn&#39;t for months <br/>
and months because the girls avoided speaking directly to their <br/>
parents. As soon as she turned 18, Lauren got her last name (Lovejoy) <br/>
tattooed down her back in Chinese characters (it&#39;s actually very <br/>
pretty---just HUGE). Carly turned 18 last November and is getting &quot;This <br/>
too shall pass&quot; tattooed on her lower back next week. Yes, the irony <br/>
that that is the ONLY thing that will last is not lost on me either. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; That&#39;s what Cameron&#39;s considering as well. The *good* thing is that <br/>
he&#39;s seriously *considering* it---not just running off to do it because <br/>
he&#39;s legally old enough to!<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; them to direct their bodies, they will end up doing <br/>
things they may regret later. But if they are empowered to know that <br/>
their bodies are their own---even at a very young age, they may still <br/>
get the tatts and piercings, but it will be a *choice*, an action---not <br/>
a REaction.<br/>

<br/>
-My only concern would be regarding whether some of the younger children have a true understanding that they are doing something to alter their bodies permanently (?).  I suppose my fear would be that my child would resent me later for NOT discouraging them from doing something to permanently change their bodies when they were not old enough to really know what &#39;permanent&#39; means.  (they might think they know, but....I would be skeptical about my own boys because as it is now, they often change their minds about things at the drop of a hat ;  what foods they like, what toys they like, what hairstyle, etc.,... its all fine because we can easily change these things without a problem).  On the other hand, the earrings can be taken out forever if your son changes his mind and the old earrings holes will be barely noticeable.  - Good luck :-)   Paula<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563209800">Will he be any different when you look in his eyes?  For me, both me and my husband were military, it matters not what the outside has.  If he had a huge visible scar or birth mark, would that change him?  If he was missing an ear, would that change who he is?  Those things are far more permanent than earrings.  My hubby and I both have had earrings, and at present, don&#39;t wear them.  No one sees it, so it &quot;never happened&quot; as far as the public is concerned.  I guess what I&#39;m really trying to say is what Kelly did - he will have more ability to know what he wants to do with his body when he has jurisdiction over it.  Out of all the &#39;crazy&#39; things kids may want to do, earrings dont&#39; rank high as a concern.  They can be taken out and it&#39;s back to &#39;normal&#39;.<br/>

  Will had one ear pierced at 11yo.   It was an adoption gift to him from us when Gary adopted him (Will&#39;s from my first marriage).  He wore an earring for about 4 yrs, then he did a couple of years in high school JROTC and the earring wasn&#39;t allowed by them, so he let it grow over.  <br/>
   <br/>
  At 17 he got his first tattoo, with our consent.  He was visiting my sister and a friend who is a tattoo artist did a beautiful (and big) chinese dragon on his lower right leg.  It goes from knee to ankle, and almost all the way around his leg from calf to shin in some places.  It is an awesome tatt!  Took three daily sessions to finish -- my sister says Will swore and sweated his way thru most of the &#39;coloring&#39; sessions on days 2 & 3!  He came home very happy with it. He has since added another smaller one, just above his ankle bone, inside, on the same leg and is saving his money for one more, a band name if I remember correctly.<br/>
   <br/>
  With both the piercing and the tattoo, Will thought and planned in depth.  I remember several days over which ear to pierce and which stud he wanted.  He took care of it all himself and never had any problems.  He and I talked over several weeks about where/what to get for his tattoo.  He wanted one that wouldn&#39;t be impossible to hide -- no neck or lower arm tattoos -- but would be easy to show to others when he wanted to. He thought about the stomach, but heard that really hurts; the back, but wanted to be able to see it himself, etc.  He chose the lower leg, figuring that if someday he gets a job where tattoos are okay, it&#39;ll be one where he can wear shorts -- if he gets an office job someday, he&#39;d like to be able to roll up his sleeves or unbutton a collar without exposing the tattoos.  Again, he was responsible for the after-care, going thru lots of lotion/cream in the weeks after the tattoo, but it is a pretty one!<br/>
   <br/>
  Gary was initially not thrilled about the ear piercing, and isn&#39;t a tattoo guy himself, so ihe didn&#39;t understand why Will would do those, but he was fine with it. We were both pleased to see how much thought Will gave to the whole process.  When it was all healed,  looking at the tattoo was intriguing to everyone -- even my mil had to have a peek when she visited a couple of months later.  <br/>
   <br/>
  On reading Kelly&#39;s post about Carly&#39;s tatt -- I have to wonder about those lower back tattoos.  I know that&#39;s a popular place, and I guess with the current crop-tops they&#39;re a popular look, but it just seems a strange place to me!  Then again, I have no tattoos -- I&#39;m a needle wimp and worry I&#39;d be allergic to the ink.  I ampretty sure, tho, that I&#39;ll go along for a piercing when the tattoo trip happens at the conference.<br/>
   <br/>
  I agree with Kelly -- our kids&#39; bodies aren&#39;t ours.  For me it&#39;s not about allowing them to do what they want, but my respect for their sovereignty that&#39;s most important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537828878">My husband and I own a tattoo shop, so I&#39;m somewhat<br/>
lenient on the piercing issue. Someone else did bring<br/>
up a good point though... if we try to control what we<br/>
allow them to put on their bodies, it could really<br/>
backfire. In our tattoo shop, we get people who don&#39;t<br/>
want to pay $200 for a tattoo that someone in some<br/>
apartment offered to do for $50. At the very least,<br/>
your tattoo might not come out the way you want it to.<br/>
Worse, you could get scarring. Even worse yet,<br/>
contract a blood-born disease.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, this is much less an issue with piercings.<br/>
But... piercings aren&#39;t permanent. Your 9 year old<br/>
might decide in a few years he doesn&#39;t want his ears<br/>
pierced anymore. And it&#39;s as simple as taking the<br/>
jewelry out, and letting the holes close up.<br/>
<br/>
But, if it were *my* child...unless he had a really<br/>
good reason for wanting his ears pierced (one that he<br/>
could convince his dad with), I&#39;d probably tell him to<br/>
wait a few years. Maybe as a birthday present for a 12<br/>
or 13th birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to think about what my kids are<br/>
going to do with tattoos once they get older. Both my<br/>
DH and I have several tattoos. And my 5 year old is<br/>
well known for having full sleeve tattoos of Sharpie<br/>
markers on various occasions. <br/>

&gt;about this and what type of earrings to get that would look boyish. I<br/>

&gt;I always think of teen boys getting piercings, not 9 yo....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Liam (now 12) got his ear pierced the first time at 9 or 10.  It <br/>
closed up spontaneously and he had it re-pierced last year when he <br/>
was 11 (which amazed me that he would do it again &#39;cause it *did* <br/>
smart when he first did it).  His decision to re-pierce demonstrated <br/>
to me his strong desire to have a pierced ear.<br/>
<br/>
We have been able to find him really cool earrings that he loves <br/>
(right now, he&#39;s wearing a sort of black-and-white skull), but we&#39;ve <br/>
found lightning bolts and swords and also just a clear, colored stone <br/>
to wear.  I&#39;m really happy for him.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to understand that your fears (looking <br/>
girlish, etc.) are yours, and it would be good if you could recognize <br/>
that and not pass them on to your son.  One of the best things I have <br/>
heard to do in almost any situation is to ask myself this <br/>
question:  &quot;How can I best support my son?&quot;  Certainly, laying my own <br/>
fears on him is not what I would consider to be supportive.  So, any <br/>
qualms I may have about something he wants to do, I deal with on my <br/>
own and I hold that up to that question:  How can I best support Liam <br/>
through this?<br/>
<br/>
If there is an obvious serious safety issue, I know that supporting <br/>
him best would be helping him understand the risks *and* helping him <br/>
mitigate them, if he still wants to go forward.  I *trust* him to <br/>
know that he does not want to injure himself, and we research stuff <br/>
together, and whatever he does, he does so with fully informed consent.<br/>
<br/>
More than gaining pierced ears, he gains the experience of learning <br/>
how to research his options and make informed choices.  He also <br/>
trusts me to support him.  I don&#39;t remember feeling that way towards <br/>
my folks when I was a kid; their default response was set to &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The *best* part about this is that he does things for the right <br/>
reasons:  He wants to.  A wrong reason would be *because* I say <br/>
no.  The wrong reason would be to prove to me that I have no <br/>
authority of him or his body.  That would lead to him sneaking around <br/>
behind my back (as I did with my folks) because I&#39;m blocking his <br/>
path, thereby actually *encouraging* him to go underground to get <br/>
what he wants.  That doesn&#39;t make a good environment for unschooling, <br/>
in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, that&#39;s my two cents on the subject.  I hope that helps!<br/>

Marji, who apologizes if this answer is redundant; I&#39;m seriously <br/>
backed up on reading email so someone else may have already put this <br/>
out there, and probably more eloquently and concisely than I did!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008072389">Well, my ds and I talked about earrings and about how male earrings<br/>
often send messages.  We talked about what message he wanted to send<br/>
and of course he had the option to just do whatever kind of earrings<br/>
he wants and to hell with the &quot;message&quot;.  He finally opted for a<br/>
single CZ in his left ear which he is very happy with.  And dad was<br/>
fine with it.  So everyone is happy.<br/>
<br/>
Like many of you said, I truly value my relationship with him over any<br/>
piercing or self-expression.  I would never ever want him to have to<br/>
hide something from me or feel that I valued him less because of<br/>
something he did.  <br/>
<br/>
If it were just us and other unschoolers in the world, my dh and I<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t have batted an eyelid over the piercing.  I think<br/>
our fear was based more on what kind of flak *we* would get from other<br/>
parents for &quot;letting&quot; our son pierce his ear!  It seems to me that as<br/>
the kids start approaching their teen years and becoming adults, our<br/>
society expects parents to start &quot;cracking down&quot; and really<br/>
controlling their lives so they don&#39;t &quot;run amok&quot;.  I don&#39;t know any<br/>
other 9 yo boys who have their ears pierced.  Usually for males, this<br/>
is something they do on their own perhaps in direct defiance of their<br/>
parents.  So I guess I was just afraid for me!  Afraid that other<br/>
parents were going to wonder what kind of mom I am for letting my son<br/>
pierce his ear so young.  I know it is dumb.  <br/>
<br/>
But you know what?  I am really glad that we found unschooling so that<br/>
when my son asks to get his ear pierced, we can go out and have a good<br/>
time doing it and the only thing bothering me is a little niggling<br/>
fear that other people are going to think bad about me.  That is such<br/>
a small fear and easy to get over compared to all the traditional<br/>
households out there that would have seen their&#39;s son&#39;s request as<br/>
evidence that he is going astray.  And they would not only fear what<br/>
other people think but a whole slew of other things too.  Which would<br/>
have resulted in a big argument that would have diminished their<br/>
relationship instead of strenghtening it.  I am glad that I don&#39;t have<br/>
to live my life in fear.  I am glad that I can love my son for who he<br/>
is, piercings and all. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142257551">Hi Alice,<br/>
    I am glad to hear you getting to the heart of your internal fears and blocks with parenting on this issue. For me, that is the most beneficial part of this style of parenting is that it makes me really look at where my hesitations and reactions are coming from. I don&#39;t get the whole &quot;army&quot; thing, primarily because your home isn&#39;t the army. Things make sense it different contexts, so what goes on in the military or any job doesn&#39;t need to go on in a family. If what is really going on with DH is that the intense homphobia and sexism present in the military (as well as everywhere else) that is still unfortunately tolerated there, is creeping in and making him either fear the responses his son will get (because he sees it happen a lot), or feel those emotions toward his son (because the response is conditioned), then that is definately something to explore and work with as a couple. Irrespective of ones beliefs about gender and sexual orientation, like any area of our kids lives, imposing our fear based values and judgments causes them distress and makes for an alienated relationship.<br/>
    My kids dad is on first glance a pretty sensitive new age guy whose good with the gay. But having two sons has brought out very intense and untapped emotions for him around gender expression and homophobia. He has found himself saying things to them about their clothing choices, or expressions of wants materially (including earrings) that are extremly sexist or heterosexist, and we try and be gentle with each other around that since it is nearly impossible to grow up here and not be socialized to experience discomfort with gender variances and anything except monogomous heterosexuality. <br/>
    Humans experience a wide range of behaviors, and not all of them fit with their cultures present dictates around gender norms. It helps to think in terms of three different things: Gender identification- what you identify your gender to be, gender expression- what you feel most comfortable expressing as a gendered behavioral or asthetic sense, and sexual orientation- the gender of people who you partner with or have sex with. And even this dileniation is narrow because people are attracted to specific gender expressions as well. Some women are attracted to males, but ones who are very femme for example. And it is also important to see that these things exist on a continuum and change throughout the life cycle. While the culture pushes people to behave consistently a specific way, peoples desires, fantasies and needs really vary a lot over the course of a long life. The primary model for understanding the laws of the univers have been dichotomies- either or&#39;s. This or that. What many of us have come to realize, is that what is true for us is all of it some of the time. We feel like dressing this way over here, and that way over there. We fall for and enjoy dating this person here, and someone totally different over there. It&#39;s really the idea that everyone has to partition into camps with definitions that is the problem, and babies are born knowing this, and when raised freely, show that fluidity throught childhood too.<br/>
    The reason I bring all this up, is that it helps to recognize that how someone expresses their gender isn&#39;t the same as their gender identity or their sexual orientation, and when boys especially act in ways that are culturally identified with &quot;femininity&quot;, the trigger point is sometimes that this means they are gay, or that they are actually wanting to be women. And it doesn&#39;t. Either of those possibilities may also exist in a person, but they are not givens. Most people probably think &quot;of course!&quot; when they hear this, but actually, we can know things cognitively and then experience it a whole different way when confronted with it in our kids.<br/>
<br/>
    I live in a really really queer community. Most everyone we know is either gender queer- androgenous, transgendered or sexually queer. And people have a really wide variance for expressing their identified genders that makes it hard to know what anyones chosen pronouns might be. It might seem in light of this that my kids expressions of gender variance would be easy for me, but not so. I feel fear, I say ridiculous things to them, I find myself slacking on consiously choosing books that present a less narrow perspective of the world. And I feel fear a lot about wanting my kids lives to be easy, and knowing that if they are trans, or gay, or neither but behave too sensitively even, then the external world will be cruel and harsh to them in some ways I want to spare them from. I see sometimes that what I say and do comes from that head space, and then I can stop and recognize the absurdity of it. The truth that life will sometimes be hard for everyone, and that it will be hardest actually for people who feel they are trapped inside bodies or lives they hate and don&#39;t feel real in. That this would be the wore fate actually. And then there is the reality that I am not in charge anyway. Probably 90% of the folks I know who are trans grew up in very heterosexist and gender normative nuclear families with religious training. They ended up who they are anyway, but with really estarnged or not present relationships with their families. So I don&#39;t believe that I can actually affect this beyond giving the message of unconditional love and acceptance. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like a long way to go from an earring, but with parenting, the nerves that are touched are always much much deeper than the surface:)<br/>

As long as our kids know all the facts first, they are able to decide <br/>

got 2 holes pierced in the same ear on the same day, & he does not <br/>
recommend that at all...too painful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697366619">In todays world people are homophobic with an Puritan based society.<br/>
When my son was 9 he wanted to have his ear pierced and I told him he<br/>
could when he turn 13 . This way he would have a few years to think<br/>
about it before we have it done. I also knew that his father would<br/>
have a issue with it. Since he was raised in a Baptist background. I<br/>
never told his dad. So on Logan&#39;s birthday he reminded me that he<br/>
wanted his ear pierced.  So off we went and his dad called home to say<br/>
Happy Birthday to Logan and the other boys told him where we went. So<br/>
I had to listen to him when we got home. He accused me if the boys<br/>
wanted to drink beer that I would buy it for him. I ended up  saying<br/>
that kids has no real control in their life that hair and having their<br/>
ear pierced was minor.<br/>
	Logan also did Ballet and tap, that was another issue with poor old<br/>
dad. You should of saw him when I bought Logan a Native American and a<br/>
Horse. The problem was that the only ones that I could find was in the<br/>
girls section and the boxes were pink. The in-laws also had a issue<br/>
with it. I ended up changing a lot of the families programmed thought<br/>
patterns. When Logan turn 8 paternal grandmother bought him a doll.<br/>
Funny that there was no comment on that.  <br/>
	My other son when he was 5 wanted finger nail polish and when my ex<br/>
asked me what he wanted I told him about a turn table that had<br/>
sprinkles, files and polish. He had major issues with that even saying<br/>
that i was going to turn the boy gay. Little Colby did get some nail<br/>
polish in his sock for Christmas. You never saw a happy kid. Father&#39;s<br/>
face was not happy when Colby showed him, but that was that. <br/>
	Today my three sons are 18,17 and 15. they are handsome lads two with<br/>
long hair and the eldest did have long hair but now it is cut real<br/>
short. I work hard on them being happy with themselves since in this<br/>
world kids have issues with self-esteem.<br/>
<br/>
just my thoughts<br/>
