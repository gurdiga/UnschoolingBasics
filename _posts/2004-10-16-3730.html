<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096248849">Mikey just turned 4. A couple months ago, I started giving him $5 a <br/>
week. (Just because it made the math easy, lol!)<br/>
<br/>
One of my motivations for doing it was that I was going insane with <br/>
all the requests for toys. He wants so much. He&#39;ll pick up a catalog <br/>
and spend hours looking at it, talking to me about what he wants, <br/>
asking for it, begging for it, etc. This will go on for a few days, <br/>
then settle down.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t changed that much since he started having his own money. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure the amount is a good fit for him. He only saves the <br/>
money if we don&#39;t go to a store! There&#39;s a toy he&#39;s wanted for a <br/>
couple months, but he never saves up to $15 to get it. He just got a <br/>
new Thomas catalog in the mail and is asking for tons of expensive <br/>
stuff. He&#39;d have to save for 2-3 months for some of it and that ain&#39;t <br/>
gonna happen. <br/>
<br/>
I have been spending a lot less on toys, due to some financial <br/>
issues, so I&#39;m reluctant to buy some of this expensive stuff. I could <br/>
raise his allowance to $7 or even $10, but 1)he might continue to <br/>
spend it on whatever is in the store and not be any closer to <br/>
the &#39;big toys&#39; and therefore still be unhappy and 2)I&#39;m not sure it <br/>
would be enough to meet his need for shopping and buying. I don&#39;t <br/>
know how high I&#39;d have to go for that, and I don&#39;t know if we can <br/>
afford to find out!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I could also match funds if he saves--when you save $10, I&#39;ll <br/>
add $5...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one right answer, but I&#39;m <br/>
completely confused about what I&#39;m trying to provide for him. I guess <br/>
I was hoping that giving him control over a small amount would be <br/>
better than not having control over a larger amount. Maybe not...<br/>
<br/>
--aj, off to ebay to see how much cheaper we could get some of <br/>
Mikey&#39;s current favorites</div>
