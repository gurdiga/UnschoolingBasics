<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474438602">Hi! I have 5 kiddos- 12yo,8yo,7yo,3yo and 19m- and we are new to <br/>
hsing, but newer still to unschooling. My 2 oldest kids (boys) have <br/>
been diagnosed with ADHD. Until last year all my kids were in school, <br/>
with my 12yo in his first year of middle school. What a DISASTER!! <br/>
Long story short, I decided I couldn&#39;t possibly do any worse and <br/>
brought them all home. I&#39;m really trying to let go of the text books <br/>
and workbooks and schedules, but find that I have to constantly keep <br/>
on myself to not nag them about getting &quot;work&quot; done. Any suggestions? <br/>
And how do you handle portfolio reviews if they spend a large chunk of <br/>
the year deschooling? Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444500683">Well what works for me is biting my tongue, liberally. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We started homeschooling two+ years ago, and the L&L conference is  <br/>
our anniversary of unschooling, two years at the first of September.  <br/>
I have seven kids, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 4 and almost two. Most of our  <br/>
kids have or could have labels, so I can imagine what it must look  <br/>
like in your house. It was very hard to deschool in our house, not  <br/>
just because of me, but because the kids were already so brainwashed  <br/>
into believing what the school said. What truly helped me was telling  <br/>
myself that my kids needed me now, more than ever, to let them heal.  <br/>
There have been serious injuries to their spirit and their mind, and  <br/>
it took my twelve yo (who was ten when we started) almost two years  <br/>
to deschool.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to do portfolios, so I&#39;m lucky there. But I seem to  <br/>
translate naturally in my head to keep my family off my back.  When I  <br/>
first started, I used &#39;notebook&#39; on my computer. Then try to  <br/>
categorize. For example, last night and today we played with lego&#39;s  <br/>
most of the time. As Breanna was snapping another layer onto her  <br/>
montage (she makes patterns with the blocks and colors) I was amazed  <br/>
at how she was figuring ratio&#39;s, how many small blocks to fill a  <br/>
space, how she was making patterns, how she was balancing color,  <br/>
there were several subjects that we could define this really cool  <br/>
activity under. *If* I was trying to track for my portfolio (I assume  <br/>
that you have to do it for legal reasons) I would be quick to write  <br/>
it down. The best thing for ME has been to stop keeping track. Of  <br/>
course, it probably did help me keep my nagging under control in the  <br/>
beginning, because I could see how they were engaged every day with  <br/>
really cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t worry about the portfolio, when do you have to show it  <br/>
to someone? Is it yearly? It would be at the end of the school year,  <br/>
yes? So don&#39;t worry about having masterpieces or signs of genius,  <br/>
number one, keep everything, number two, and then pick out some  <br/>
favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, lost track of where I was going with this, really cool  <br/>
construction trucks in front of our house! Have a nice day....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600567639">First thing is check out what *exactly* is required in a portfolio <br/>
by law where you are. For instance, here in CT, IF someone chooses <br/>
to do a portfolio, all it has to show is that the requisite subjects <br/>
were *presented* - they cannot comment on grade level of materials <br/>
or anything, just Yes, there&#39;s math, reading, history, etc... If you <br/>
have to &quot;show progress&quot; or some such wording, keep something from <br/>
September (a book title they read perhaps) and something from May or <br/>
June (whenever your &#39;school year&#39; ends). It need not be a lot, <br/>
generally the less the better and it&#39;s up to them to request <br/>
additional information if there&#39;s a thin spot. Also, see if it&#39;s <br/>
required that it be handed in or if you just bring it and leave with <br/>
it and just &#39;show&#39; them the materials. And, too, see if there&#39;s an <br/>
outside reviewer type option where you find a local homeschooler who <br/>
can review it and sign a thing saying &quot;I checked it. Okey dokey. <br/>
signed Certified Teacher Person&quot; (okay well they&#39;d have to put it <br/>
in &quot;educationese&quot; lol) See if there&#39;s a Narrative Option to the law -<br/>
 where you write out a summary of what has been going on &quot;Jr has <br/>
spent this last year exploring wildebeests through sources including <br/>
but not limited to books and magazines (such as nat geog), videos <br/>
(What Gnu? video nat geog), field excursions (trip to Zoo B and game <br/>
reserve M). Jr has continued to progress in numeracy through use of <br/>
arithmetic and mathematical materials including but not limited <br/>
to ...&quot; (and list off some number related games like Smath or <br/>
whatever). Basically, this is stuff that you&#39;d note in a dayplanner <br/>
or calendar page without intervening in their day to day activities. <br/>
Don&#39;t try right off to figure out &quot;what is it?&quot; just jot down &quot;spent <br/>
2 hours playing Guitar Hero with cousins and neighbor kids&quot; (that&#39;d <br/>
count as music/fine arts and, from what I&#39;ve seen of the game, phys <br/>
ed! plus it&#39;s got that &#39;social&#39; aspect as well).<br/>
