<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096192552">My DD(with T21) who will be three next month needs glasses.  She has <br/>
strabismus and is farsighted.  She only crosses her eyes when she is <br/>
looking at things up close.<br/>
<br/>
She will not understand why we are making her wear these glasses.  I <br/>
imagine this will be a struggle with her.  We have drops to use every <br/>
three days to make it hard for her to see without her glasses.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to force her.  But we only have 2 months to see if the <br/>
glasses help.  Hopefully they will, if not she will need eye surgery.<br/>
<br/>
How do you handle things like this?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any thoughts.<br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t have personal knowledge with this situation but I can try offer  <br/>
unschooly advice.<br/>
If faced with your situation I would try to go at it from a highly  sensitive <br/>
perspective. For instance.. I may try to have the glasses feel like  pretend <br/>
goggles or a mask that children play with. My 2 yr old wears a pair of  safety <br/>
goggles often for fun. He loves the strap and the silly feel. I may being  <br/>
the seriousness of the situation try to recruit the other children (if you have  <br/>
any) to play the glasses play also. Like have a few pair with regular lens  <br/>
so they can help. Or even you can do it.<br/>
Children don&#39;t like to be controlled and if they feel that they will revolt  <br/>
away from what we want or need them to do.  <br/>
I hope the next couple months resolves the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680914815">Why will she need eye surgery? My son has the exact same thing, but  <br/>
the doc said we should wait until at least eight to make decisions on  <br/>
surgery. Do you have her wear an eyepatch? We used one alternatively  <br/>
on eyes and it really did help strengthen them.Other than that I  <br/>
don&#39;t know. Josh was so happy to get his glasses because he could see  <br/>
better. He was not happy about the eyepatch because everyone under  <br/>
the sun made jokes about being a pirate.<br/>
