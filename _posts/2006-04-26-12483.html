<div id="ygrps-yiv-203175481">....and wish we hadn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night we celebrated Sierra&#39;s birthday as a family. She isn&#39;t<br/>
having a traditional party this year so my sister threw together a<br/>
last minute home celebration.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were running around with some tissue paper that was really<br/>
colorful, making it into &quot;dresses&quot; and &quot;scarves&quot;.  I was lamenting the<br/>
loss of ATC material and said &quot;hey you guys, why don&#39;t we save that<br/>
for a project?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LeaAnn says &quot;They ARE using it for a project&quot;.<br/>
Gawd, I love radical unschoolers.:) It was a big &quot;DUH&quot; moment....the<br/>
kind where you really wonder how it popped out of your mouth.<br/>
Tissue paper is CHEAP and I was wanting to save it for some future<br/>
project when they were joyfully creating things???!!! If I&#39;d been <br/>
holding a book, I would have smacked myself in the head with it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo,<br/>
we talked about how many thoughts/ideas don&#39;t just go away, but we<br/>
learn to keep our mouths shut better! LeaAnn and I both react to<br/>
certain projects internally with &quot;ooh, we can&#39;t waste food&quot; or such<br/>
things, but we&#39;ve simply learned to ignore that voice and let our<br/>
children explore joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
So what we&#39;re doing as parents, is not only shifting thoughts, but<br/>
learning to LIVE with some of them and not act on them. That&#39;s how<br/>
unschooling has a chance to really take hold.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194734670">If you save any paper that&#39;s left after they&#39;re done with their project, It will be wonderfully rumpled and have the added  memories of their joy to put into your altered/scrap book.<br/>
