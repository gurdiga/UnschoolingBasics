<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431105827">Has anyone else had the experience of suddenly realizing that when<br/>
people challenge what you do (unschooling) or your style of parenting<br/>
that you no longer feel compelled to explain, justify etc???   <br/>
<br/>
Before I was constantly trying to explain to others , win others over<br/>
to my side etc regarding our lifestyle... now I am wondering if I have<br/>
evolved into this &quot;higher&quot; place of understanding or respect for their<br/>
need to find out on their own.   Of course it just could be that I<br/>
don&#39;t give a damn what anyone thinks anymore? HA!   <br/>
<br/>
I always hated the discussions that I got into with people who said<br/>
&quot;well that works for your kids but it won&#39;t work for MY kids&quot;   or<br/>
those that said &quot;if I gave my kid access to junk food all day they<br/>
would eat junk food all day every day and never stop EVER!&quot;  and well<br/>
you have all heard those speeches!   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I feel more peaceful that what I am doing for my family is<br/>
right for my family...it may not look like other families or even<br/>
other unschooling families but my kids are happy and healthy and<br/>
growing up into amazing people.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening!<br/>

<br/>
People seldom challenge me - kind of ridiculous at this point with my  <br/>
kids almost all grown up. But when negative comments are made about  <br/>
unschooling or unparenting or even just homeschooling, I am very  <br/>
likely to ignore them and, truly, hardly give them a passing thought.<br/>

JUUUUSSSTTT DOOOOON&#39;T CAAAARE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen it - it&#39;s a really good whole-family movie.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask for ideas, help, information, advice, etc., I&#39;m there  <br/>
for them. But I&#39;m not defending our choices anymore.<br/>
<br/>
That compulsion to explain or justify or defend really comes out of  <br/>
our own feelings of insecurity; we act as if more people believing in  <br/>
something will make it more likely to be true and right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584164578">I&#39;m sort of in the middle now: I don&#39;t care what other people choose <br/>
(well, I do care if I see them hitting or yelling at their kids), but <br/>
I don&#39;t want them attacking me, either. That&#39;s when I feel <br/>
defensive.  But it&#39;s also helped me to go deeper in unschooling to <br/>
the point where I read more, think more on why I believe what I <br/>
believe, and then feel more confident of my choice. I don&#39;t argue <br/>
back much, but I go over their questions and comments in my head <br/>
until I find what answer I would give them, if I did.  I have also <br/>
gotten to a point where I&#39;m not afraid to talk to anyone about my <br/>
beliefs. It makes me feel more authentic to let people know where I <br/>
stand.  If I sense that they are not interested, are getting <br/>
defensive or are starting to attack me, then I just bow out, because <br/>
I haven&#39;t seen where arguing does any good -- too stressful for me, <br/>
and does not convince anyone of my way. <br/>
<br/>
I hope to get to the point where I&#39;m confident all around and not <br/>
concerned about what others think. However, I really appreciate this <br/>
journey!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229232957">Dear all,<br/>
Last evening my DH brought home a night lamp and it was wrapped up in <br/>
a newspaper. he came home and tried to lure DS abt the suprised in the <br/>
packet. DS ran behind him and DH kept running away...to an extent that <br/>
he cried. DH kept laughing....finally giving in to the tantrum...he <br/>
showed the lamp and a the tantrum subsided. This is a very recurring <br/>
play pattern than my DH take up. AND I AM JUST NOT OKAY WITH IT! I am <br/>
also not able to reason it out to him...pls help, maybe one of u could <br/>
be able to express better than me as to how this tease-play pattern is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568017931">It sounds like your dh needs to do some growing.  Though it may not be  <br/>
right, a lot of adults feel that it&#39;s &quot;their turn&quot; to do all the  <br/>
things that adults did to them.  It takes a lot of strength to be  <br/>
willing to give that up, and the parent that is not doing all the  <br/>
reading and research is going to have a harder time of it.<br/>
<br/>
When my dh does something like this, something that many grown-ups  <br/>
feel is &quot;funny&quot; to do with a child, I tend to discuss it with him in  <br/>
an adult-to-adult example.   &quot;What would happen if your boss did that  <br/>
to you with promotion paperwork?&quot;  or &quot;What would happen if you did  <br/>
that to a store clerk with the money for a purchase?&quot;  or simply,  <br/>
&quot;What would happen if you did that to another adult?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once I have his answer (which usually involves a negative consequence  <br/>
for the trickster), I point out that if it&#39;s not okay to do to an  <br/>
adult, then it&#39;s not okay to do to a child. Then I remind him that if  <br/>
he is not going to respect ds, then he will have to go through me,  <br/>
because until he can respect ds, I *will* protect ds.  I point out  <br/>
that ds already knows that his dad&#39;s behavior isn&#39;t right, and I will  <br/>
support ds.<br/>
<br/>
It may take longer, and he may need many reminders or discussions like  <br/>
the one above, but eventually, dh will start to follow your lead and  <br/>
come around.  Mine finally is!<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Been there.  We were there a lot when our son was born, even before <br/>
the unschooling.  Everything we did, compared to both our families, <br/>
was &quot;weird&quot; and had to be constantly defended.  We didn&#39;t circumcise, <br/>
didn&#39;t vax.  Breastfeeding alone sent our respective families into <br/>
fits.  They just couldn&#39;t get it.  The fact that our son was still <br/>
breastfeeding at 4 was way too much for them to understand!  We all <br/>
slept together in a family bed.  We just didn&#39;t do anything the <br/>
way &quot;normal&quot; people did.  So the negative feedback from everyone <br/>
around us was constant, relentless, and really quite annoying.  When <br/>
we would go over to my wife&#39;s family with our nine month old son and <br/>
spend a few minutes showing them the signs the boy made and <br/>
recognized so they could &quot;talk&quot; to them, they looked at us as if we <br/>
were crazy - until he started signing at them!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not good at listening to people comment on my decisions.  I have <br/>
a tendency to tell people where to stuff it, but I was trying to be <br/>
more gentle with my family and my wife&#39;s family.  I tried to explain <br/>
everytime someone would ask about one or another of our decisions.  <br/>
But it quickly became apparent that the person asking the question <br/>
(Why do you breastfeed?) wasn&#39;t really interested in hearing our <br/>
response or in learning something new, they just wanted to get the <br/>
conversation started so they could attack with their pre-<br/>
arranged &quot;brilliant&quot; comeback (You know, that will cause him to end <br/>
up gay.)  Ok, so I don&#39;t have the most progressive family in the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
But, given that we were surrounded by people who disagreed with so <br/>
many of our choices, and who had such poor manners that they didn&#39;t <br/>
know that constantly poking us on it was rude, we had to spend a lot <br/>
of time being defensive.  In a case, for example, where you&#39;re still <br/>
nursing a three year old, it isn&#39;t enough simply to not care what <br/>
everyone thinks - you have to go on the offense as well.  My three <br/>
year old son could understand when people made negative remarks about <br/>
us, our decisions, our practices, etc and my wife and I would just <br/>
now allow it.  I was not about to have someone make my son self-<br/>
conscious about the fact that he nursed, so snarky comments when my <br/>
children were present would result in an immediate rebuke from me <br/>
(with my family) or my wife (with hers).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, long story short, eventually they all got over their <br/>
squeamishness when they saw that 1) our kids refused to succumb to <br/>
all of the horrible things they were sure would happen because of our <br/>
choices and 2) either my wife or I would tell them where to stuff it!<br/>
<br/>
So now (eight years and three kids later) nobody says much and we <br/>
don&#39;t have to spend so much mental energy feeling defensive and <br/>
planning how we&#39;ll handle it when nutty Uncle X says something <br/>
offensive at Thanksgiving dinner.  Although, when our son was born <br/>
three weeks ago, I could feel them wanting to say something about the <br/>
fact that we did a lotus birth!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279289060">You might be able to explain it from your son&#39;s perspective in this way:<br/>
your father is someone you should be able to trust more than other<br/>
adults - he is one of your protectors, one of your caregivers, someone<br/>
who should only want to see you happy; when that trusted figure taunts<br/>
you, taking obvious pleasure in your lack of pleasure (i.e., not getting<br/>
the surprise after it is offered), it is cruel and, therefore,<br/>
confusing, given the expectations you, as a child, have of your parents<br/>
and the roles they play in your life. It is especially frightening<br/>
because the person who should be most helpful and understanding of your<br/>
wants and needs is exerting great control over your obtaining pleasure<br/>
and expressing glee in thwarting it.<br/>
<br/>
My father did and still does things like this with my niece and nephews<br/>
(I don&#39;t let him do it to my children). It horrifies both me and my<br/>
husband (thank goodness DH is on my wavelength.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope things get better.<br/>

Has he read any of the responses so far?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d tried to get through to him gently and he still refused to <br/>
comply, the next time, I&#39;d grab the damned &quot;surprise&quot; myself and give <br/>
it to my child.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t allow it to go on and on and on.<br/>
