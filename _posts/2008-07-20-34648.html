on the sites and sign up for their newsletters.  One point that hit home <br/>
with me was that to allow someone to inject anything into my body, or the <br/>
body of my child, means that I am bestowing the greatest amount of trust I <br/>
can bestow.  My doctor does not really know what is in the needle he is <br/>
using.  A large corporation is making billions of dollars by providing this <br/>
mandatory injection.  Would I trust this corporation with my, or my my <br/>
child&#39;s, life?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737223409">One of the problems with not vaccinating is that you are exposing others who may be less able to cope to diseases. It is a public good issue. <br/>
There are a lot of studies out there that demonstrate the good of vaccines and a few that argue for the negative. Some of the studies that argue for the negative are about following the money, so looking at who funded what study. It can get quite overwhelming when you read the information. <br/>
Simon and Linnaea and David and I are all vaccinated. David would be dead if he hadn&#39;t been, quite probably, given the areas where he was raised as a child.Â Polio is a real thing in much of the world. My step-mother worked with a man who helped to get vaccines to some of the areas of South Africa where polio is rife and the people who she met who suffered at the diseases hands were quite debilitated. There is this fantastic book called Wisconsin Death Trip which is a series of newspaper articles put together about death and crime in Wisconsin in the late 1800s that really demonstrates the change in mortality in 100 years based in some part on vaccinations and in some part on water quality measures. <br/>
When Simon was 3 months old we went to Belize, there were people who David interviewed who had 8 out of 10 children die from childhood illnesses. Vaccinations do save lives, they are less likely to in a population that is largely vaccinated merely because the illnesses that are being vaccinated aren&#39;t around due to the vaccinations (herd immunity--David wants me to put that in for clarity&#39;s sake <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020898269">My second son had seizures for the first 3 weeks of his life.  He had the<br/>
Hep B in the hospital but then had nothing else until he was almost 5.  I&#39;m<br/>
very anti vaccine in animals and kids.  And I&#39;m quite sure that whatever it<br/>
is 20 vaccines before age 2 is horrifically stressful to a developing immune<br/>
system...and since I have autoimmune issues myself, I kept Liam from having<br/>
them until we had to get ready to send him to school.  (Had I known about<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling he likely wouldn&#39;t have had any at all.)  I also<br/>
didn&#39;t take him for any well baby check-ups.  He was my second child and I<br/>
wasn&#39;t a scared new mom anymore.  I didn&#39;t need a Dr telling me he had a big<br/>
head and was such and such on the growth chart.  He was peeing and pooping<br/>
and growing and that was enough.<br/>
<br/>
None of that gives you any real answer to your question.  I didn&#39;t research<br/>
it...I just knew in my gut it was wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653515408">I have a lot of friends who do not vaccinate.  There was a small<br/>
Measles outbreak in a town near by.  Maybe the herd immunity is<br/>
starting to lessen with all the non-vaccinators?  <br/>
<br/>
Do some people wait until the child is a bit older?  Injecting all<br/>
these things into a tiny little body does concern me a bit.  I wonder<br/>
if there are benefits of waiting a little while?  Until their bodies<br/>
are stronger?  <br/>
<br/>
My second son was vaccinated with the varicella vaccine without my<br/>
knowledge, which is one reason I&#39;m digging for info.  I knew at the<br/>
time I did not want him to have it, yet the doctors just assumed, gave<br/>
him the shot, and told me afterward.  I don&#39;t see a point to the<br/>
chicken pox vaccine before age 9 or so.<br/>
<br/>
All the info I find leans so heavily one way or another.  Isn&#39;t there<br/>
a middle ground?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074911344">Dr Sears has a website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/">http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/</a><br/>
<br/>
There is an alternative vaccine schedule somewhere on this website.  I<br/>
am traveling right now or I would spend the time finding it for you. <br/>
The big thing is how the sheer number of vaccines have grown since we<br/>
were kids and trooping off to the doctor.  <br/>
<br/>
The research is just not there yet to know if this huge number of<br/>
shots (20+ in by age 2) has any side effects.  Each vaccine is<br/>
considered safe by itself based on trials (but drug trials in children<br/>
is whole other topic...) but it is the combination of so many of them,<br/>
over a short period of time, in a small developing body that has not<br/>
been adequately studied.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I appreciate Schuyler&#39;s point about developing<br/>
countries.  I have lived in SE Asia and traveled widely in Latin<br/>
America and have witnessed mothers rioting in the street to get access<br/>
to vaccines for their children. When less than half of your children<br/>
make it to age 5 due to childhood illnesses, vaccines look pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
My son has had a passport since he was 6 months old.  We knew that if<br/>
we were going to travel with him, we would have to vaccinate.<br/>
Additionally, the spring before I became pregnant I had had whooping<br/>
cough and it was a horrible experience so I knew I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
expose a tiny baby to that trial.  There are regular whooping cough<br/>
outbreaks in Tucson and I knew I would go along with the DTaP. <br/>
<br/>
I tried to selectively vaccinate on an extended schedule, though found<br/>
it challenging with my current pediatrician. I also regularly dosed<br/>
him with 1000mg of Vitamin C prior to each shot (I believe I got this<br/>
recommendation from my Dr Sears Baby Book.)  The only vax we had<br/>
trouble with was the MMR.  My son had a significant fever and general<br/>
unwellness that I would not want to repeat.  We recently had a measles<br/>
outbreak in Tucson and my friends with young children (under age 2)<br/>
who were still going to frequent well-baby visits were getting<br/>
pressured to give ANOTHER MMR shot to their children.  This didn&#39;t<br/>
make sense to me and it is in this way that I think the proponents of<br/>
vaccinations lose their credibility even when there may be a vital<br/>
reason to vaccinate.<br/>
<br/>
Tough topic and very challenging to parse the different sides as the<br/>
vested interests have so much at stake from the altruistic, i.e.<br/>
public health concerns, to the economic, the huge profits of Big<br/>
Pharma as well as the current economics of running a pediatric<br/>
practice - vaccine reimbursements are the foundation of their finances.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://snipurl.com/31xk7">http://snipurl.com/31xk7</a>  Stephanie Cave is a doctor that treats vaccine <br/>

I don&#39;t vax my kids.  My first was vaxxed until 12mo and then I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374372120">You&#39;re right.  Everything out there is very pro or very anti-.  That&#39;s a<br/>
good thing.  Read both.  See where your lifestyle, your child&#39;s health,<br/>
and basically your reality fit in.  For example, are you exclusively<br/>
breastfeeding?  Do you plan on daycare?  Travelling?  Any allergies to<br/>
worry about?  Or religious beliefs?  Likelihood of contracting a<br/>
disease?  Effects of contracting the disease?  You may also consider<br/>
whether there are some diseases you want your child to get naturally. <br/>
You should really tailor it to your child&#39;s needs.  It will all boil<br/>
down to a risk /benefit analysis for each vaccine.<br/>
<br/>
You already did that with hep b.  Probably because the baby didn&#39;t need<br/>
it, thereby exposing him/her to any of the risks seemed ridiculous given<br/>
the fact that there was zero benefit, not to mention that the effects<br/>
are likely to wear off by the time he/she may be at risk.  You may find<br/>
this to be true with several other of the recommended vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
Books I recommend are &quot;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About<br/>
Children&#39;s Vaccines&quot; by Stephanie Cave, and my favorite, &quot;The Vaccine<br/>
Guide&quot; by Randall Neustaedter.  The former is more neutral.  The latter<br/>
is pretty anti-vaccine, although I find it objective, but I lean very<br/>
much towards his philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I believe you have plenty of time to educate yourself<br/>
on the subject.  The ones you may want to start learning about<br/>
immediately, because they affect small infants, thus time becomes more<br/>
of an issue are:  the meningitis vaccines, pertussis, rotovirus, and<br/>
polio (only if travelling).  If you&#39;re nursing, do some research on the<br/>
effects of exclusive breastfeeding on immunity wrt vaccine preventable<br/>
diseases as well.  Feel free to contact me off list if you&#39;d like more<br/>
info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515171341">I think it is fair enough to weigh the pros and cons. I even think it is reasonable to question my reasons for vaccinating my children &lt;BWG&gt;. I think that at some level the anti-vac versus pro-vac discussions are much like the anti-abortion versus pro-choice discussions, it is about a certain level of faith. My faith, my questioning ends up with me trusting much of what the scientific community has found, your faith leads you to questioning those backed by the government or big business/drug companies. My great-uncle Murvail died of diptheria. He was 3 years old. My dad gave Simon a plated silver bowl and plate set that Murvail owned. They both have Simple Simon rhymes on them.  His last words to his mother, my grandmother&#39;s adopted mother, were &quot;The water is so deep and so cold.&quot; His mother believed that you passed over a great body of water before you died because of what her son said, her little boy. If I could I would vaccinate Murvail. I would DTaP<br/>
 him just as I did Simon and Linnaea. <br/>
<br/>
The polio outbreak that you cited, the one in China, demonstrates nicely &quot;herd immunity&quot;. To sum up, for those who are vaguely interested but didn&#39;t follow the link, China irradicated wild polio in 2000. It isn&#39;t mentioned in the article, but in India, where there is still wild polio, prior to introduction of a vaccine 1000 children a day were suffering paralysis at polio&#39;s hands, post vaccination it is down to 5 a day. I can&#39;t find the citation for that. I can find the 1000 a day, easily, but the 5 a day was from an interview with Nick Grassly that I can&#39;t find again. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_17-11-2006-13-18-5">http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_17-11-2006-13-18-5</a> says 1000 a day and down to 1500 in 2006 through November). In China 6 children had acute and residual paralysis. They were in a population that had a 72% uptake of the polio vaccine. On the Wikipedia page on herd immunity the threshhold is 80%-86% of the population needs to be immunized for<br/>
 there to be a herd immunity affect for polio. The vaccine was live polio, which is no longer used in the U.S. And it doesn&#39;t spread among those who are vaccinated, interestingly enough, none of the paralysed 6 were vaccinated. And it was stopped by immunizing the rest of the population. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a lot to be said for herd immunity. I think that one of the considerations if you are going to wait to vaccinate is the uptake of vaccine within the area you live. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity</a> has a really nice table to use for risk assessment. If most people are vaccinated then not vaccinating is pretty safe. The poster who said that we don&#39;t carry illness about in our person is right, but if we get chicken pox or measles or diptheria or whooping cough, than we do put those who are immunocompromised, or unvaccinated, at risk. <br/>
<br/>
I found an article at the New York Times from before the varicella vaccination that talks about the risks of chicken pox to some and the halcyon days of yore : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA143CF936A15751C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1.">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA143CF936A15751C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1.</a> <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there isn&#39;t a varicella vaccine in the UK. It wasn&#39;t deemed a necessary public expense. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567390725">Hi there!<br/>
   <br/>
  How wise of you to look into this! My daughter is 15 months old and has not had any well-baby visits or vaccinations. My intuition tells me not to vaccinate. My husband says he wants to research before making a fianl decision, but so far, he has done no research- I think ultimately he believes that the risks of vaccinations are greater than the benefits. <br/>
   <br/>
  There are some vaccines, like the chicken pox, that I am not sure why this is needed. I had chicken pox, and though it was uncomfortable for a week, I survived, and am now stronger for it. If we never give our immune system the opportunity to overcome sickness, then we will become weaker overall. With questionable ingredients, and aggressive schedules, I don&#39;t feel good about, nor do I trust, those that tell me that I should blindly trust the doctors and associations that encourage all of these vaccinations. Vaccination does not equal immunity!<br/>
   <br/>
  That being said, here are some really great resources for you:<br/>
   <br/>
  Vaccinations by Aviva Jill Romm- she is very informative. It would be hard to guess what her stance is on the issue as this book is all about giving facts, not her own personal opinion. <br/>

   <br/>
  I have not done a ton of research on these links, they are just what I have in my &quot;when I have spare time&quot; pile of links to look through. As with any resource, take it with a grain of salt and follow your intuition. I would also recommend finding a Natropath as they know natural ways of combating concerns over diseases, viruses, etc. Natropaths work WITH your body and nature to find optimal health. I believe most doctors work against your body by pushing prescriptions and other highly medicalized procedures. <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that this is helpful! Good luck in your research!<br/>

It&#39;s more about faith in nature and my body&#39;s own ability to deal with<br/>
these things when in a healthy environment. I think people will die of<br/>
diseases forever. I believe in our rush to make everything padded and<br/>

about your uncle is, he could have died from the same disease if he<br/>
had the vax. That vax is considered one of the most problematic and<br/>
even when we had a more mainstream doc he advised against it.<br/>
<br/>
Living with damage from vaccinations is no picnic either.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of history, viruses ebb and tide. I believe we are on<br/>
the cusp of a rise and people with vaccines will not be any safer. As<br/>
with anything, I could be wrong. Time will tell whether vaccines are<br/>
truly useful or whether we simply introduced them at a point in<br/>
history when there was a natural ebb of disease.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I think it&#39;s good to question people who say they have our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621612326">My under informed gut feeling is that if there are issues vaccines <br/>
are causing that lots would disappear if they waited until kids were <br/>
older.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I wanted to delay and pick and choose vaccinesÂ and now that Gigi is almost 30 months old and I am thinkingÂ time for Â tetanusÂ  would be good since we do live in a farm with lots of manure I cannot do it.<br/>
How can I hold her down for someoneÂ elseÂ to come inflict pain on her?<br/>
She is too young to understandÂ if we talk about it.<br/>
I know I will hurt the trust she has in me if IÂ do that so I guess I will have to wait even longer to get those shots.<br/>

My older dd had &quot;normal&quot; vaccine reactions of high fever, high- pitched<br/>
screaming, large red-hot welts at site of injections, and lethargy- all<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; the doctor said.  Then I started to do my own research. <br/>
Needless to say we didnt vaccinate our 2nd dd, and wont be vaccinating<br/>
any more.  i had no idea that aborted fetal tissue was used in the<br/>
making of certain vax&#39;s...  not to mention formaldahyde (a known<br/>
carcinogenic).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770681648">Dr. Sears says that the most important time to vaccinate is during <br/>
infancy and if you aren&#39;t going to vaccinate until 2, then you may as <br/>
well not do it at all. (Thats if you believe vaccines work). But then <br/>
he also says that if you are breastfeeding and don&#39;t have your babies <br/>
in daycare then its very very unlikely to catch these diseases. <br/>
<br/>
He recommends a (somewhat) delayed and alternative vax schedule in <br/>
his book. (What some would call middle of the road).<br/>
<br/>
Measles used to be a common childhood illness, like chickenpox used <br/>
to be.  I never knew anyone die from chickenpox..  but ofcourse now <br/>
they scare you into vaccinating &#39;or you child could die!&#39; Some <br/>
believe that it is to our detriment that these diseases aren&#39;t around <br/>
anymore- that they stimulate the immune system.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an interesting article on measles and what the cdc says;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880536470">We have a 4 y.o. DD and one due in 3 weeks. Our first was vaccinated<br/>
up until her 3rd bday, when I started doing major research. This baby<br/>
will not be vaccinated at all. I highly recommend watching Dr. Sherri<br/>
Tenpenny&#39;s DVD titled &quot;Vaccines: What CDC Documents and Science<br/>
Reveal&quot;. It&#39;s very informative, thorough, and the information is<br/>
trustworthy, because she goes over actual CDC documents in detail. <br/>

bad enough to require ER care, they usually (in our area anyway) give  <br/>
(or offer) a tetanus shot regardless of when your last vaccination  <br/>
