I have a friend who does not purchase curriculum ,but they do take a<br/>
lot of  hands on classes for homeschoolers. The kids seem to enjoy the<br/>
classes, but it does not seem that the classes are specifically<br/>
following the kid&#39;s interests. Are they just replacing curriculum with<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know. It depends. Are the children *wanting* the classes, or <br/>
are they simply the only options the parents are giving the children?<br/>
<br/>
Locally, we have HUGE homeschool co-ops that basically look like <br/>
school. Except that the parents are teaching the classes and not <br/>
&quot;certified&quot; teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Is she making them do the work? Do the kids want to be there? <br/>
(*Enjoying&quot; the classes isn&#39;t the same as *choosing* to be there <br/>
because it&#39;s cool and fun and interesting.---*I* enjoyed LOTS of my <br/>
school classes, but that doesn&#39;t mean I was there by choice---OR <br/>
unschooling.) Can they stop if they&#39;re not enjoying it any more?<br/>
<br/>
Is she calling the kids unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Classes can certainly replace curriculum----I mean, classes ARE the <br/>
curriculum in school (Or are the curricula the classes? &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Both of my boys have taken a class or two---and I know several <br/>
unschoolers who LOVE co-op classes and other &quot;organized&quot; educational <br/>
stuff. But if the classes *become* the curriculum and the children <br/>
don&#39;t have a choice, I wouldn&#39;t consider it unschooling. To me it would <br/>
be...maybe...eclectic homeschooling through the co-op? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058949772">My family participates in a large home school learning center(70 <br/>
families meeting 5 days a week). Many members use it as school, though <br/>
we and several other families unschool and treat it like anything else <br/>
we would offer our children- totally up to them day by day. We tend to <br/>
sign up for sports, games, and art programs as that is what my kids are <br/>
interested in though they have also enjoyed some writing and science <br/>
classes at their own choice. It is a challenge to co-exist with the <br/>
school-at -home families but the kids love to be with the other kids and <br/>
as long as I don&#39;t expect too much out of relationships with the other <br/>
parents it is okay. My kids love it so much and feel very sad when there <br/>
is a break between sessions (which is one school-like things about it <br/>
that doesn&#39;t work so well for us.)<br/>
<br/>
I have organized some meetings of a unschooling group at the center - <br/>
the interest is growing. I think having us be there and be confident in <br/>
our choices really helps other families see unschooling as a viable <br/>
option. I think there is a lot of pressure and contagious fear about <br/>
meeting state requirements that spreads among parents- especially those <br/>
with young children. Many families have joined specifically so that they <br/>
can use the classes at the learning center as a substitute for following <br/>
curriculum at home. Such a fearful way to live! I do see that our <br/>
excitement in following our own interests in learning and living can be <br/>
contagious also.<br/>

to get at though, the difference between choosing to be there because <br/>
it&#39;s fun and interesting and enjoying being there(but not necesarily <br/>
the class the child would have chose on thier own.) It&#39;s not like the <br/>
kid had an interest in woodcrafting or art so the parents set up an <br/>
art class to help the kid follow thier own intersest. It&#39;s more like <br/>
the Seaport is offering classes once on month on these various <br/>
subjects (immigration, navigation, force and motion) and all the <br/>
local homeschoolers take them,so my friend does too. They do they <br/>
work of the class because that is what everybody is doing, but I <br/>
don&#39;t see her daughter just coming out with &quot;Hey, I want to study <br/>
immigration, is there a class for that?&quot; I suppose it could be being <br/>
presented as the mom showing the kids all the classes available and <br/>
asking if they want to take them. In that case  would the only <br/>
difference would be parental suggestion and not really following a <br/>

am wondering about driving from class to class though. They are going <br/>
somewhere every day. I am trying to pin down the exact difference <br/>
between using a class in a unschooling manner or using the class as   <br/>

classes as curriculum. There is a nature science class,book club, <br/>
chess club,Seaport(history), sports and Spanish currently being <br/>
offered. It is true that the classes are hands on and we have done a <br/>
few of them, but we don&#39;t do all of the session or use it as a <br/>
curriculum. For example the Seaport had a class at the planetarium.At <br/>
the time we had just gotten a telescope and were learning to use it <br/>
so the kids really wanted to do this one. Shortly after they lost <br/>
interest .<br/>

<br/>
Hard to say; but if Mom isn&#39;t very creative or energetic, that may be <br/>
the children&#39;s best way to be exposed to the world.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true of school though sometimes: if mom can&#39;t make unschooling <br/>
fun and interesting, school might be a better choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is why I&#39;m trying to figure this out. She defines the term<br/>
unschooling as they don&#39;t buy a curriculum or do a school at home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how some people define unschooling. To me, it&#39;s much more than <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the problems in actually *defining* unschooling: it means <br/>
different things to different people. *I* certainly have a stronger and <br/>
deeper definition. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I am wondering about driving from class to class though. They are <br/>
going<br/>
somewhere every day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There have been times we were going somewhere every day. There are <br/>
other periods in which we stay at home a LOT (like now). Some folks <br/>
LIKE to be out and about a lot---it depends on the family.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am trying to pin down the exact difference<br/>
between using a class in a unschooling manner or using the class as<br/>
curriculum (expensive tutoring) aren&#39;t you just paying someone else<br/>
to teach you kids? What is the difference between that and private<br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s the main way the parents are handling the learning, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound very unschooly. It really depends on the kids though.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of forcing the kids to do anything---and even if <br/>
the parents aren&#39;t forcing the kids to these classes, my guess is that <br/>
the children feel coercion from the &quot;teachers&quot; in some way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So how can you tell if it is an unschooler who loves the classes or<br/>
if it is an ecclectic homeschooling  with co-op?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter. &lt;g&gt; Do we really need to tell? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if they choose<br/>
to go but show no other interest in the subject outside of the class?<br/>
What if they would not be going if all of their friends were not<br/>
going too?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then *I* think the parents aren&#39;t working hard enough. &lt;bwg&gt; All that <br/>
can be accomplished withOUT classes and co-ops. Certainly getting the <br/>
kids together often can be accomplished without classes.<br/>
<br/>
But you know, sometimes it IS what the kids want. Sometimes mom&#39;s not <br/>
feeling up to the job, and it may be the children&#39;s best option. <br/>
Sometimes children just like group dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for unschoolers to place more value on <br/>
organized classes and co-ops than on tv and games and playing in mud.<br/>

Both are probably very true. It IS just a building, and <br/>
alwaysunschooled kids don&#39;t have the issues we schooled adults have <br/>
with the idea of school classrooms.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT unschooling, but it seems better than school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a free---or *democratic*---school. The teachers and children have <br/>
equal voting rights---it&#39;s a democratic process---in making school <br/>
decisions. The children can even vote a teacher OUT if they want.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents are making all the decisions FOR the children and FOR <br/>
the school, it&#39;s not a Sudbury-type school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935377837">Unschooling is a set of principles, not the particular actions that  <br/>
result from living by those principles.<br/>
<br/>
In some families, living by the principles of unschooling may include  <br/>
the kids choosing to take classes. In other families, kids taking  <br/>
classes would necessarily involve some level of coercion or pressure  <br/>
by the parents.<br/>
<br/>
What is unschooling?<br/>
It is bringing the world to the child and the child to the world,  <br/>
supporting the child&#39;s interests, and recognizing that learning  <br/>
happens all the time, except when it is forced.<br/>

<br/>
When my now 23 year old daughter took an English course in college,  <br/>
one of her very first college courses, she was THRILLED. She came out  <br/>
of the class meeting just grinning from ear to ear and saying, &quot;I just  <br/>
can&#39;t believe it this is so COOL that someone is paid to read my  <br/>
writing and edit it and critique it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was ecstatic. It didn&#39;t bother her at ALL that this person was  <br/>
called a teacher and that she met with her in a school building. It  <br/>
didn&#39;t bother her much that she was getting graded. She didn&#39;t pay  <br/>
much attention to the grading aspect throughout all of college, in  <br/>
fact. She said to me that if the other students would stop thinking  <br/>
about grades and think about the course content, their grades would  <br/>
improve.<br/>
<br/>
So - my point is that she definitely didn&#39;t have the baggage about  <br/>
schools and teachers (or even about grades) that we might have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She said it was what<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it entirely voluntary? Is it boring? Are there tests? Are there  <br/>
grades? I mean - just being IN a school building doesn&#39;t make it school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She used the model of a<br/>
&gt; Sudbury school,free school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t use that model because even in Sudbury-style schools, the  <br/>
kids have to go a certain amount - it is required.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; children to choose what classes to to take ,it is still a school,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone thinks the only way to learn is through classes and from a  <br/>
teacher - then they haven&#39;t understood unschooling. But, once they do  <br/>
understand that learning happens all the time, anywhere, in an  <br/>
infinite number of ways, most often incidentally, then some classes  <br/>
might be very enjoyable, especially the social aspect of being in a  <br/>
group all focusing on learning about the same thing together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is still a  separation between teachers (even if they are  <br/>
&gt; parents) and students. Am<br/>
&gt; I just way off here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is better for people new to unschooling to avoid teachers  <br/>
and classes for a while, because it is too easy to revert to thinking  <br/>
THAT is real learning, as opposed to the more natural learning of real  <br/>
life. But for more &quot;advanced&quot; (for want of a better word) unschoolers,  <br/>
classes can be a part of the overall unschooling life. My KIDS don&#39;t  <br/>
think of karate or dance classes or voice or guitar lessons  <br/>
differently than classes or lessons for writing or math. The classes  <br/>
are out there and represent one possible way to learn something.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be a little hard for us always-schooled adults to think  <br/>
like our own unschooled kids. We have baggage! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

unschooling, with one big thing in common. They do have a huge focus  <br/>
on supporting the interests of the kids as opposed to deciding for  <br/>
them what they should learn. But, a huge part of the focus is also on  <br/>
the democratic nature of the school - it isn&#39;t a parent/child  <br/>
relationship that they create there. The students and teachers are all  <br/>
equal - everyone gets one vote - on everything including the hiring of  <br/>
teachers and the rules of the school. There ARE lots of rules and  <br/>
there are punishments, too, again decided on by the kids and adults  <br/>
together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656635056">The way we participate in our learning center is this:<br/>
<br/>
We talk about what programs(this is what our group calls them- not my <br/>
name) our family would like to participate in or offer- We will either <br/>
plan a program ourselves or with others, or find someone with <br/>
willingness and skill to lead a program that my children request. The <br/>
program can be just about anything from very structured to very open <br/>
ended. We also just wait and see what other families come up with and <br/>
try things out to see if we have interest. Each family offers a program <br/>
or contributes in some other way each session(3 a year)- this is the end <br/>
of the third year. It is in no way an easy way out- I have personally <br/>
devoted a huge amount of time to organizing, scheduling, preparing for <br/>
activities, meetings, etc. My daughter loves to lead craft activities <br/>
with me so we do this often- she loves sharing skills with other kids. <br/>
My son mainly likes sports and hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the things that we do at the learning center are things that <br/>
aren&#39;t aren&#39;t as much fun(in our opinion) with three: basketball, <br/>
soccer, cooperative games, group games, dancing, board games, card <br/>
games, general playing outdoors. My kids have also been introduced to <br/>
some stuff by people who are truly excited about what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
My kids do some things that they are interested in outside of the <br/>
learning center, other times they are just trying something that sounds <br/>
interesting- and sometimes it isn&#39;t, sometimes it is. They both really <br/>
love being out of the house and seeing other people- and this was <br/>
difficult for me to arrange enough of without the learning center, <br/>
though I tried and tried. Many families just weren&#39;t open to getting <br/>
together often. In fact, I think my older child is likely to have <br/>
attended public school if it weren&#39;t for the learning center. We could <br/>
certainly arrange other group things outside of this institution and do <br/>
but since most home schooled kids in the area attend and my kids want to <br/>
be with them often, we want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly my children might find themselves being coerced by another <br/>
parent/leader. We read the descriptions carefully and avoid situations <br/>
that seem uncomfortable, and drop out of others that become <br/>
uncomfortable, which is rare.<br/>
 <br/>
Just my experience- don&#39;t know what your friend&#39;s is.  Classes or <br/>
learning coops that aren&#39;t organized by parents of course don&#39;t take as <br/>
much effort- and their are many members of our own center that don&#39;t out <br/>
much into it and use it in a very different way. I run into a lot of <br/>
people who have a very different definition of unschooling than I do- I <br/>
can feel a bit annoyed by that- but I don&#39;t own the word, after all. <br/>
People say they unschool and force their children to work in a math book <br/>
or are just so negative and disappointed about their children that even <br/>
if they call it unschooling it isn&#39;t anything I recognize as such.<br/>
<br/>
Once an unschooling kid chooses to go to school- are they no longer <br/>
unschooling? Once an unschooling kid chooses to take a lot of <br/>
school-like classes or buys some text books are they no longer <br/>
unschooling? Maybe the parent in either case is not able to provide an <br/>
unschooling life without these experiences that is satisfying- or maybe <br/>
this is what the child truly wants to experience of all that is out <br/>
there- you&#39;d have to look pretty close to tell. I would think this would <br/>
mainly be important to determine about yourself and your own children. <br/>
Some people really really want to experience group learning or are <br/>
willing to put up with the group learning to experience what they love <br/>
about the greater experience of being at school or other type of class. <br/>
I have to face the fact that I am humanly unable to provide my children <br/>
with all experiences possible or even all that they desire- due to where <br/>
we live, our income level, other people&#39;s willingness and availability. <br/>
We can try and try harder, but there are limits though we work very hard <br/>
at letting go of any arbitrary and invented ones. I know that there are <br/>
things that could be better and I love this list in that it challenges <br/>
me to seek out experiences for my kids that fit them better. Some people <br/>
aren&#39;t looking for that.<br/>

In some families, living by the principles of unschooling may include<br/>
the kids choosing to take classes. In other families, kids taking<br/>
classes would necessarily involve some level of coercion or pressure<br/>
by the parents.<br/>
<br/>

I wrote about this a while ago. Sandra has it on her website:<br/>

<br/>
It helps to understand the underlying *motive* behind taking classes. <br/>
There can be baggage to unload before feeling comfortable in classes, <br/>
but it&#39;s doable.<br/>

Anyways, I was discussing unschooling ideas with my husband and he<br/>
asked if the *freeschools* were unschooling schools.   Would anyone<br/>
here describe them as such?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nope, not me.<br/>
<br/>
But they seem like a better place to be than traditional public/private <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
I think they could be &quot;unschoolish&quot;---except that <br/>
they&#39;re...ummmm...SCHOOLS. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The kids still have to be there. And some of them can be pretty <br/>
rigorous (not necessarily academically), if that&#39;s what the kids and <br/>
teachers decide. It&#39;s democratic, so majority wins. If you&#39;re not one <br/>
of the majority, you lose! And that won&#39;t change unless they vote <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a film of one. Maybe someone remembers which one. A very <br/>
unschoolish school (oxymoron). All the kids were pretty young. It was <br/>
in....Sweden? Maybe? I don&#39;t think they spoke English, but I could be <br/>
wrong. Seems that I remember translators/subtitles for the kids...most <br/>
of the adults spoke English, but not all.<br/>
<br/>
But it looked like a cool place to spend a day, if you have to go to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
But mine don&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids are happier. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I thought long about what I would consider failing --- and my fear is<br/>
that I don&#39;t provide enough stimulation for the boys.<br/>
<br/>
They are doing wonderfully though, our home is set up in a unique way<br/>
that they can play freely.  The boys love legos and Blues Clues and<br/>
Power Rangers (I was getting a little worried that the craze wouldn&#39;t<br/>
end but the twins are on Super Why now whew - not that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
supportive, I just don&#39;t like the mock fighting and resulting tears<br/>
:/). They read, talk, (mostly) get along with each other. Sometimes<br/>
Azel even helps cook.<br/>
<br/>
The boys are interesting people and we are still learning how to<br/>
communicate with each other in healthy ways.   When I thought of<br/>
&quot;failing&quot; originally I thought of not going out to field trips often<br/>
enough and the like - schooly-think, right?<br/>
<br/>
How do you deal with the feeling of &quot;we should be doing more&quot;? That<br/>

<br/>
We do more. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We go through &quot;waves&quot; here of doing a LOT and of just hanging out not <br/>
doing much of anything (so it seems).<br/>
<br/>
When those days of doing &quot;nothing&quot; seem to out-number the active days, <br/>
I try to schedule something to get us out of the house and DOing <br/>
something. We go to Charleston for the day. Or Camden. Or Charlotte. <br/>
All are a bit of a drive, so we get that car-talking time in (which is <br/>
good for jump-starting other possibilities) and (when we get there) <br/>
some sight-seeing in and walking and inspiration---and lots of art, <br/>
architecture, and history.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a great place very nearby called the Congaree National <br/>
Swamp---a boardwalk built through a swamp---absolutely beautiful, with <br/>
all kinds of critters to hunt for. I have friends who have seen wild <br/>
boar there, but we haven&#39;t yet---got my eyes peeled though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bringing a friend over for an extended stay is helpful. Bo&#39;s here now. <br/>
He&#39;ll stay for a week. That always livens things up a bit. Visiting <br/>
friends too: Duncan will be flying up to Boston to visit Shaun next <br/>
month (his first solo flight! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Recently, when it seemed that we are stuck in the house too much, I <br/>
asked Duncan whether there was anything he especially wanted to <br/>
DO---active-wise. He surprised me by saying tennis. So I got him (and <br/>
Cameron) a few lessons with the local pro, and he and Cameron like to <br/>
go down and hit a few balls around.<br/>
<br/>
If *I* am feeling that we&#39;re not doing enough, chances are we aren&#39;t. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; There are times I feel we&#39;re in a rut---and *I* can get VERY <br/>
comfortable in a rut. &lt;G&gt; At those times, I need to push myself to get <br/>
out and do. But once that ball is rollling,....<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, if we&#39;ve been going and going and going, it can be <br/>
really nice to just hunker down and enjoy NOT doing for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, to *me*, if you feel that you need to be doing more, the solution <br/>
is probably to do more. And maybe not more of the same thing, but <br/>
something *different*.<br/>
