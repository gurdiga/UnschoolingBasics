<div id="ygrps-yiv-646405075">I am having a hard time understanding why someone who is so interested <br/>
in &quot;critical thinking&quot; would choose to believe schools.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of a single group of people who think more critically <br/>
than unschoolers. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling parents I know virtually as well as IRL think HARD <br/>
about the choices they make. Every day. They&#39;ve made very difficult <br/>
choices regarding learning after MUCH consideration and questioning and <br/>
thought. Often it leads further than simply academics, and it causes <br/>
the families to think beyond---into religion and eating and chores and <br/>
bedtimes and ....and the whole lifestyle. WHY we do what we do. WHY we <br/>
behave as we do. WHY we think as we do.<br/>
<br/>
Questioning one thing leads to questioning others.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t accept &quot;because I said so&quot; as an answer. Neither should anyone <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
Many people seem to want research---as if research will answer their <br/>
questions. Research only answers the questions the researchers are <br/>
looking for. What I want to see is how it affects TWO people---MY <br/>
children. It just so happens that unschooling and mindful parenting <br/>
works for every family that embraces it. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s <br/>
important to me. What&#39;s important is Cameron and Duncan. Only. I have <br/>
can see the difference in them. That&#39;s enough for *me*.<br/>
<br/>
Million of parents send their children every day to schools, not <br/>
questioning ONE thing the schools say or do. They require homework and <br/>
early bedtimes and limit games and TV because schools and teachers and <br/>
educators say so---never asking why or whether it&#39;s important. They <br/>
accept that what schools require is necessary---often because it <br/>
justifies the parents&#39; own time in school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are the only group which *critically* questions the status <br/>
quo.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can think critically and yet still choose to send a <br/>
child to school. That defies logic. There is NOTHING in school that <br/>
cannot be found in the real world---and PLENTY in the real world that <br/>
cannot be found in school.<br/>
<br/>
I want my children&#39;s worlds to be so much bigger than *any* school <br/>
could pretend to be. And I&#39;ve though a LOT about this. Critically.<br/>

<br/>
Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re the only ones saying &quot;no more&quot; and actually LIVING that<br/>
&quot;no more&quot;.<br/>
