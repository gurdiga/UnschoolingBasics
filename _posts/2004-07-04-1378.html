<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205586373">Robin, thank you for your concern and your post. <br/>
<br/>
 It made me think about a lot of things, and the first things was <br/>
that no one here could understand how the last few years of my life <br/>
have  been and why I would use the word broken. I am an Army wife, my <br/>
husband was in Iraq and I was alone with my daughter and pregnant for <br/>
the second time with a surrogate baby. The timeing was horrible, who <br/>
would have guessed we would go to war? My health, there is very <br/>
little I can do that I have no already done to help it. It is just a <br/>
wiating game on the Drs. Who by the way think they know why my throat <br/>
feels like it is closing every so often and why I throw up so often <br/>
for weeks and then it goes away, just to come back, it is not my <br/>
thyriod after all, my a problem with acid in my stomack eating my <br/>
throat. I go for an upper GI and other tests next week. And as for my <br/>
love for helping people who in the end effect my family negatively, I <br/>
am working on that. <br/>
<br/>
 That is part of unschooling I think because of why I do it. I do it <br/>
because like many I was programmed to only find self worth in the <br/>
opinions of others. I want to make others happy. Working on that just <br/>
as surely as I am working on letting my own child be who she is love <br/>
what she loves. <br/>
<br/>
  So worry if you will, I do not depend on my child for my emotional <br/>
health, I just now notice more often the wonderful things she does, <br/>
and I take the time to enjoy it. I have a new Dr and with the files <br/>
from all the others, this one agrees as well that I have sutational <br/>
depression and right now she said all I need is a good a friend. Only <br/>
problem is, that my friends are dependent on me for things and I just <br/>
can not count on them, so I came here to vent because one of my <br/>
biggest problems is trying to let go of all the schooling so that my <br/>
daughter can grow up happy and so that I can learn to change to make <br/>
sure that happens. <br/>
<br/>
  I am very thrilled to have been given the http://www.aldort.com/ <br/>
page because right at the top is what, says what I am looking for: <br/>
Raising our Children, Raising ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
 One last thing, it is not a shock to me to here people talk about <br/>
getting help, but often they mean medication, and that is very sick <br/>
to me as I see it so often. People are told to not show their <br/>
emotions and that is the sickness to me. I came here very honest <br/>
about how I am feeling and what is going on, looking for advice on <br/>
how to fix things, and it seems, though I could be wrong, that many <br/>
here would rather me be on medication so I am not honest about my <br/>
feeling for I would not even be feeling them. I can not change how <br/>
any of those people feel about me. Most of those people also seem to <br/>
forget that most of the brightest inventors and amazing artist and <br/>
writers where all full of passion and where often called crazy as <br/>
well. I rather be a person of passion, dare I even say a little <br/>
dramtic and feel it all, ups and down, then be one of the &quot;well <br/>
agusted people&quot; that the schools have tried to turn all of us into. <br/>
People to me, seem to have forgotten how to live. <br/>
<br/>
 I was raped when I was 4 years old, and maybe emotionally at times I <br/>
have not gone past that point. I know my 4 five year old lives with a <br/>
lot of passion.... <br/>
<br/>
  I would not change any of it. <br/>
<br/>
  I can just hope to change the future. <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>
  Kimmy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869173355">I&#39;m glad you found the aldort website helpful.  I also mentioned <br/>
something about seeking counseling with Naomi Aldort or Jan Hunt.  I <br/>
hope you didn&#39;t think that I was recommending you go on any <br/>
medication.  I do not think that is the case, nor would I ever <br/>
assume to make that kind of recommendation on such a forum.  An over <br/>
the phone session with Naomi or Jan would not lead you in that <br/>
direction either.  In fact, I would actually recommend &quot;against&quot; <br/>
seeking &quot;just any old&quot; counseling, not only because they might just <br/>
try to give you a quick fix by putting you on medication, but also <br/>
it is very hard to find someone who understands certain alternative <br/>
life choices.  I have talked to Jan on numerous occasions and she <br/>
has helped me through some rough spots.  It does seem to me you have <br/>
had more than your fair share of lifes challenges.  I hope you find <br/>
some support and comfort.  You really seem to have your head in the <br/>
right place as far as I can see, it just seems you are in dire need <br/>
of some good support and a few less curve balls thrown your way.  <br/>
Peace and Light to you.  Wendy<br/>
