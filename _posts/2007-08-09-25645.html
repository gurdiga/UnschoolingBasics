<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391749468">This mainly is one of me venting. I am awaiting and answer  from the cover <br/>
school I have chosen to use, questioning when after I pay the  enrollment fees <br/>
can I take my son out of public school.<br/>
 <br/>
Each morning, I feel so horrible having to make my son go to  school. He <br/>
thinks of new things so he does not have to go. Today was he had a  fever, which I <br/>
took and he did not.<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday he came home from school, he was so frustrated. They  have a <br/>
supposed system if you do something wrong you get a card pulled. Well he  told me he <br/>
had a card pulled because he did not know there was a president who  had a <br/>
birthday the same as his. How foolish is that.<br/>
 <br/>
I am so hoping this cover school gets back to me so I know  when I can <br/>
withdraw him out of public school. He is so unhappy everyday having  to go to school<br/>
 <br/>
Saddened,<br/>
 <br/>

him have the day off!! & the next three.. or five... the rest of his life!!<br/>
;)<br/>
Chances are they&#39;re not going to come check up on him -- a chicken pox fib<br/>
should cover the time you need ;) He&#39;s FAR more important than the karmic<br/>
cost of a little white lie to the school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445886935">Debi, what would be the worst case scenario if you just pulled him out now?  <br/>
It sounds as if his days at school are really negative with few if any <br/>
redeeming  qualities. Can you just have him not go? <br/>

Hi Debi<br/>
Been there, done that, total empathy.  My solution was to just let <br/>
my daughter stay home earlier than we had planned.  I sent all my <br/>
paperwork in to the school district and made a phone call to the <br/>
principal.   Two weeks later I still hadn&#39;t heard anything so I made <br/>
a phone call.  It turned out the person who was supposed to process <br/>
it was on vacation and hadn&#39;t seen it on her desk yet.  SHe back <br/>
dated the approval to my application date.  In the meantime I got <br/>
the absence letters and a third quarter report card with 50 absences <br/>
and an F for every class.  Once I had a clear understanding that in <br/>
my state the buden of proof shifts to the school dept. to prove you <br/>
can&#39;t give an equitable education if they deny you I stopped <br/>
worrying. It&#39;s your right to accept the reponsibility of your childs <br/>
education.  As long as you meet the legal requirements of your state <br/>
you&#39;re good.  Be clear on the law in your state and don&#39;t let anyone <br/>
get you down, not even yourself.  Rock on sister!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361074410">We took a son out of the middle of seventh grade<br/>
because he was so sick and then did not want to go<br/>
back for anything. We just told them we are looking<br/>
into homeschooling, had some meetings etc. but then<br/>
that was that.  I think that after taking him out you<br/>
have some days (in MA I believe it was 30 days or so) <br/>
to resolve the matter.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Ah, it sounds worth it to pay the fee. Just my honest opinion, but fees are  <br/>
just money and it sounds like he is hurting too much to take a chance, kwim? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the cover school I chose has a fee which I am trying to  come  up with as <br/>

Might be a good idea. I know how frustrating it is to lose money, but I  know <br/>
too how much worse it is to lose your Self. Or, your child&#39;s Self. (been  <br/>
there, done that...ugh...)<br/>
 <br/>
Take care!! <br/>
