I&#39;m  just not sure what I should be doing to help him understand what<br/>
his &quot;job&quot;  is. I just feel like he&#39;s missing out and the farther behind<br/>
and he&#39;s not  in the least interested in doing schooly type stuff or<br/>
learning how to  write/type so he can talk with kids online, doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem interested in  friends or prettymuch doing anything new.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I had a couple of questions.  How do you know he is &quot;behind&quot; in  schooly <br/>
things?  Is he required by the state to keep up with his age  peers?    And one <br/>
more, what do you consider his &quot;job&quot; to  be?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
