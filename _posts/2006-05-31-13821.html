highlights the whole rules issue so nicely:<br/>

&gt; You know, I was at an antique show this weekend and they had the<br/>
&gt; coolest old cast iron spitoon -- it looked like a turtle and when<br/>
&gt; you stepped on the head the shell openned up and you spit in the<br/>
&gt; tray there.  In some of our subcultures and some foriegn cultures<br/>
&gt; spitting is normal, expected, and accepted -- I mean look at<br/>
&gt; baseball and the Chinese!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See, this right here encapsulates, for me, the sheer beauty and wonder<br/>
of RU parenting and how the learning emerges from the partnership<br/>
inherent in the parenting.  This is exactly the problem with making<br/>
across the board rules--they&#39;re narrowing and limiting and downright<br/>
false in certain situations.<br/>
<br/>
A mainstream parent would make a rule--no spitting--that looks the<br/>
same for every mainstream parent out there, and they&#39;ll all support<br/>
each other on it and pat each other on the back about such a common<br/>
sense and obvious rule. Quite the contrary, we could sample 10 RU<br/>
families and find 10 inspirational and different solutions to a<br/>
problem that involve really cool and amazing and interesting and<br/>
fascinating connections made along the way.<br/>
<br/>
God, I love unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Cathy!<br/>
