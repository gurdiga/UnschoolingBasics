<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284579338">But I am <br/>
grateful to have learned some strategies (times to give examples of <br/>
anguage, etc), and I think that it has helped my children. <br/>
<br/>
*******<br/>
<br/>
Yep. We are starting this process with my 22-month-old nephew. My kids never had the problems this child has and even though, as I explained to one of the therapist coordinators yesterday, we homeschool and don&#39;t push, this child needs some help. He has had a very difficult start in life and needs us to do more than what came natural with our own kids. OTOH, I will not participate in anything that I don&#39;t feel comfortable with and have been assured that all the interventions -- he has multiple problems -- are play based and very gentle. We&#39;ll see how it goes and feel free to use what helps and reject what doesn&#39;t. And we always have to keep in mind that this is a child who will be going to public school, which changes the equation a bit.<br/>
<br/>
But all of this reminds me of the &quot;swimming lessons&quot; I took my son to when he was about one or so. They were more for me to learn how to help a little kid learn to swim than for him. He had fun but after a few we stopped going and I never needed to take DD to lessons. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515831872">There&#39;s also the misconception that those in the medical community<br/>
tend to advocate - that learning sign prevents the child from<br/>
speaking. Even though I started off with Signing Exact English I&#39;m<br/>
thankful my mother ignored that &quot;advice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was also unaware of ASL and the deaf community until I was older. Is<br/>
your child aware of those options and given exposure to it? Like Joyce<br/>
says about schooled kids thinking force was better because it was all<br/>
they know, those you talked with, and what your daughter says now may<br/>
be because of those factors.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter is still deaf when the batteries die.  I would suggest<br/>
looking into signing community events so that she can have that option<br/>
now. There are great children&#39;s stories in ASL on DVD (at<br/>
harriscomm.com ). Being 4 years old, the visual aspect would be a<br/>
bonus.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, who says that speech therapy and hearing aids will help<br/>
your child have a &quot;normal&quot; life? There are deaf lawyers, college<br/>
presidents, business owners, internationally competitive athletes, and<br/>
no, they do not all work within an &quot;isolated community.&quot; They interact<br/>
with a full spectrum of people, globally -- without having to speak<br/>
and hear.<br/>
<br/>
...Now, it&#39;s true that the deaf/signing community is not perfect,<br/>
there is still a lot of pain and hurt from &quot;intervention&quot; among even<br/>
older adults.  You will see varying reactions if not already.  Take<br/>
the cochlear implant, for example. But one reason why it exists is<br/>
because like the unschooling community, there is joy in being among<br/>
other like-minded people who accept each other for who they are.<br/>

&gt; No, your dd&#39;s desire to hear better than her ears allowed or speak<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t see this statement as being about the child. It&#39;s also based<br/>
&gt; on an assumption that not having amplification and therapy would&#39;ve<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061586355">If I might add something: Deaf children are already normal.  The human body,<br/>
in whatever form it takes, is extremely limited and weak.  It cannot fly on<br/>
its own; it cannot move very fast; it cannot see without light; it cannot be<br/>
underwater for long.  Yet technology makes it possible for us to do these<br/>
things.  Deaf people do everything, only they do some things differently<br/>
sometimes.  It is society that likes to put down people for different<br/>
irrational reasons, just so that a few are considered superior to all<br/>
others.  Deafness is one of the many excuses society uses to do this.  But<br/>
society will use anything it can use, so the answer to being okay is NOT<br/>
trying to fit its ideal but coping with what you are in spite of that silly<br/>
ideal.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe some of the people here unschool their kids because they can<br/>
provide their children with an environment in which they are absolutely<br/>
okay, no matter what labels sick people have for them based on gender, skin<br/>
color, learning style, whatever.  The kids are REALLY okay; unschooling is a<br/>
great way to reinforce this.<br/>
