that right LOL!)  And then be able to add later that he found 2<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831782665">Hi, Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
I just put a little one together and will email it to you directly as an <br/>
attachment. It&#39;s a pretty simple one but I think it will do the trick - a <br/>
separate column for the number of each item (pennies, nickels, etc.) and <br/>
then a column where that number is multiplied by the currency value (.01, <br/>
.05, etc.). Hope it helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482967136">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this spreadsheet is what you&#39;re lookin&#39; for, but you may want to<br/>
have a look anyway:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
ps/ Google Spreadsheets (which is what you should get clicking on the above<br/>
link) are, in my humble opinion, more intuitive than Microsoft Excel<br/>
(simpler interface, basically). Therefore, it might be easier to start<br/>
learning spreadsheet calculations by using them instead of Excel. Just a<br/>
personal opinion, though.<br/>
