<div id="ygrps-yiv-855347630">Kelly asked about Turkey, so I&#39;ll share a little.  We&#39;ve been here <br/>
for almost a year now.  We stay on the base nearly all the time.  Dh <br/>
is &quot;in the know&quot; as far as terrorism and threats to the base, etc., <br/>
so he&#39;s not always comfortable going out and about.  Besides, it&#39;s <br/>
scary driving into the city here!  Adana is quite a big city, and <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t believe how people drive over here - totally crazy!  <br/>
It&#39;s very stinky too.  There is often a smell of burning <br/>
rubber/plastic/something in the air.  I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>
recycles.  We&#39;ve been on a couple of little trips, but it&#39;s not easy <br/>
travelling here, especially with 2 girls who are very squeamish <br/>
about strange bathrooms (4yo lets me know when I need to clean the <br/>
toilet!)  You never know what the bathrooms will be like.  Also, gas <br/>
is extremely expensive too.  It is about $2 on base right now and <br/>
probably double that off base.<br/>
<br/>
The main thing we don&#39;t like though, is that we haven&#39;t found any <br/>
friends.  The base is small.  There is a youth center that we tried <br/>
a couple of times, but the kids who go there are all about sports.  <br/>
Darcy (9yo) is SO not into sports.  She loves computers and books <br/>
and anime and animals.  We just don&#39;t seem to meet anyone that we <br/>
click with.  I&#39;ve never been a good friend-maker either.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
shy really.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have good days though.  Brenna (4yo) is really into horses, <br/>
and there is a small stable here.  We go and ride occasionally, and <br/>
we go for walks a lot.  We catch ladybugs, butterflies, spiders, and <br/>
snails - lots of snails here!  We had a crab in our backyard last <br/>
week, no idea where that came from.  We play on the computer a lot <br/>
and watch a lot of movies.<br/>
<br/>
We REALLY wish we could go to the conference!  We may be coming to <br/>
the states this summer because my BIL is having a trial, but we <br/>
don&#39;t know when it is yet.  If at all possible, we&#39;ll make it to <br/>
Boston.  Who knows where we&#39;ll move next year - hopefully close to <br/>
some unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know anything specific about Turkey, just ask!<br/>

story.&nbsp; I understand about the friends thing.&nbsp; I&#39;m not such a good 
friend maker either.&nbsp; You probably don&#39;t find a lot of Unschoolers in the 
Services do you?&nbsp; I know in the whole state of Vermont I don&#39;t know of any 
Unschooling families so finding something in common with someone is kind of 
difficult.&nbsp; It is sad to think that we are the minority.&nbsp; Well, from 
one shy person to another, we can at least be friends on the 
list......</font></span></div>

<div>Hi Christy</div>
<div>&nbsp; We are in the almost the same boat here.&nbsp; We are in the states, but finding like minds is so hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; My oldest ds has friends in school, my youngest ds was only in school a month.&nbsp; So, finding people to hang out with has been a challenge. So far, there is no one!&nbsp; Oh I take that back, I em&#39;d someone on a chance they would em me back, and she did, and they live ony 30 mins from here.&nbsp; We&#39;re all hopeing to get together sometime soon!</div>
<div>&nbsp; But during all this time my boys have found friendship in each other.&nbsp; I&#39;m almost positive they would not be as close if they were in school all day apart from each other.&nbsp; </div>
