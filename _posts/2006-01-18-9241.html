I am new here, but I see that TV is a big part of a lot of people&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel like it&#39;s more of a drug than dessert, and while I&#39;m not a Nazi <br/>
about a little sugar or caffeine, I wouldn&#39;t sit by and let my children <br/>
try cocaine, and I couldn&#39;t live with myself as a mother if I allowed a <br/>
steady diet of TV. I&#39;ve heard many people say that if allowed to <br/>
self-regulate, kids will tire of it (and decide to choose healthy foods, <br/>
and so on...). And maybe some kids do. But mine have had lots and lots <br/>
of time to cut back on that kind of thing, and they just can&#39;t do it <br/>
themselves. If anything, they&#39;ve become even more addicted. What I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed about this that is unacceptable to me is twofold:<br/>
<br/>
1) I find that they learn what our society considers &#39;normal&#39;, and how <br/>
you are supposed to behave in it. Not in an objective way, but much the <br/>
same way they would learn it if they were peer-socialized in a public <br/>
school. Not good. A lot like being brainwashed.<br/>
<br/>
2) I also find that there is a direct relationship between how much TV <br/>
they watch and how rudely, impatiently, and disrespectfully they <br/>
interact with other people. They&#39;re great kids, but when they watch too <br/>
much TV, they&#39;re just plain mean.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that if humans didn&#39;t require extended parenting, we would <br/>
mature in far fewer years and be capable of caring for ourselves. In all <br/>
things, moderation...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406450078">Nobody is advocating being a &quot;hands off&quot; parent.  But it is good to really take a long, hard look at beliefs and see if they are based in reality.<br/>
<br/>
A schooled kid sits at a desk for 7 hours per day and then comes home and watches 3 hours of tv and does 2 hours of homework.  That is 12 hours of sedentary activity.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooled kid watches tv for 5 hours....that is only 5 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Many kids do binge on tv when they are first given control of it.  It is a novelty and from their standpoint, they are concerned it may be temporary.  Eventually, they will have seen most of what is on and self-limit to a few shows they actually enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
If I did have a kid that was watching many hours of tv after the initial binge, I would perhaps worry that she was bored or depressed.  I would offer fun things to do, like the zoo or the beach.  I would see if she were interested in 4-H, pottery, raising bees (just got my hive yesterday, yippee!!).  I would do fun and interesting things myself and see if she wanted to come along for the ride.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741045933">So how do you explain those of us who don&#39;t put limits or controls on tv and<br/>
dont&#39; have disrespectful, rude, impatient, mean kids?  I&#39;m not waiting for<br/>
my kids to &#39;cut back&#39; on tv.  They are free to watch as much or as little as<br/>
they want. Most of the time I watch more than they do (I like having it on<br/>
for background noise).<br/>
<br/>
How do you get from sugar and caffeine to cocain? I do not limit sugar or<br/>
caffeine and I have yet to have to decide whether to sit by and let my<br/>
children try cocain. There isn&#39;t a connection. And even though I don&#39;t limit<br/>
sugar and caffeine, none of my kids eat them excessivly most of the time. In<br/>
fact, they probably eat healthier than the average kid.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how much or little tv my kids watch, how much or little<br/>
sugar, caffeine or anything else they consume. These amounts don&#39;t effect<br/>
how much parenting my kids get. They get all the parenting I can give them<br/>
whatever they are doing, whatever they are interested in, whatever they need<br/>
at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
You are not trusting your kids to regulate themselves. You are assuming they<br/>
cannot make the choices that are best for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453328290">My daughter was 10 years old and she watched tv pretty much non-stop for 4 months.  Now at 15, she has maybe 5 shows a week that she really enjoys, other than that, she doesn&#39;t watch it much, the occassional movie.<br/>
<br/>
I admit...it was hard to watch her sit there for those months.  I bit my lip many, many times.  Finally, she became grumpy and so I would occassionally ask her if she thought that might be do to lack of movement, that she simply wasn&#39;t working her body and so it was sluggish.  I NEVER villainized the tv.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that she learned some things, even while watching fluff tv.  She made some comment about Harriett Tubman and I asked her where she had heard of her.  Adriane said it was an episode of &quot;Sister, Sister.&quot;  Those kinds of things....she also learned that tv shows tend to follow the same arc of story line, there is little basis in reality, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103665874">Good points on the bored or depressed part...if there aren&#39;t things  <br/>
in the house or neighborhood that are interesting, what&#39;s the point  <br/>
of not choosing?<br/>
<br/>
I would also look and see if the TV watching is actually being  <br/>
unmoderated, or if the kids feel vilified. Even if they were actually  <br/>
able to choose how much tv they watched, was it moderated in other  <br/>
ways (limited to educational or programs that only parents approve  <br/>
of?) Also, were their choices met with raised eyebrows or scathing  <br/>
comments? Every time I try to say that they are choosing too much tv,  <br/>
it&#39;s instantly met with the subconscious &quot;Oh no, mommy is going to  <br/>
turn it off, quick, cram as much in as you can!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I only ask because I know I made that mistake the first time I tested  <br/>
their selflimiting. Once I let go and let them watch as much as they  <br/>
wanted without negative comments, even my four yo stopped it. Even  <br/>
five hours is only two movies and a tv show....it&#39;s really not much  <br/>
more than what most adults watch when they get home from work.<br/>
<br/>
And tonight watching Madagascar was awesome. I was curious about how  <br/>
they got by Madagascar when going to Kenya, admitted I had no idea of  <br/>
where Kenya was (embarrassing, I know) and then I got the globe out  <br/>
to look it up. The kids were interested too, came over for about 20  <br/>
seconds, and went back to the movie. But all throughout, they were  <br/>
making comments that I paid to learn in college about how most of the  <br/>
animals were lemurs, since it was an island, there wasn&#39;t any way for  <br/>
other animals to move in without a boat, we talked about how  <br/>
indigenous animals on islands are overrun by introduced species and  <br/>
compared it to Australia. It was amazing the connect the kids made  <br/>
while watching this movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478980571">Keep the power out of tv by setting a different example yourself. If  <br/>
they see you in front of it, it becomes natural for them. If they  <br/>
want to watch tv, fine, but you get up and do stuff. walk around your  <br/>
backyard, paint a picture, whatever it is you like, show them there  <br/>
are options. I don&#39;t think tv is addictive. I think it seems that way  <br/>
when people who are stressed all day at work and school come home and  <br/>
use it to destress. There&#39;s a huge difference neurologically between  <br/>
people who are blanking out in front of the screen and families who  <br/>
are actively engaged in what they are seeing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we also eat dessert before dinner, so take it the way you  <br/>
want. We&#39;ve removed the power of sugar in our lives too, by eating it  <br/>
when we like. No urge to cram it, no urge to hoard it. We eat fresh  <br/>
fruits and veggies when we like as well. But the kids know what they  <br/>
really want. Sometimes I offer junk, and they ask for fruit.  <br/>
Sometimes I say I&#39;m going to watch a movie, and they want to play  <br/>
outside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051091662">Hello Breezy!<br/>
<br/>
I have had concerns about TV.  My son was on TV overdose when I decided to embrace radical unschooling.  He really is becoming self-regulated with respect to TV watching.  At age 5 yrs he will tell me that he is bored with TV.  This is after being regulated somewhat to quite a bit up until that point.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that when I stopped caring about how much TV he watches, that the TV became an instant nonissue.  I will say that when he is in TV all the time mode, I feel it is because there is nothing more interesting going on.  When I am doing interesting things that may or may be directed to my sons, they watch less TV.  I have often heard on this list that it really is all about the parents getting into their children&#39;s worlds.  I think that is the case at times with my son.  If we are engaging each other, he watches less TV or at least talks throughout the entire program, which helps me to realized how great he is as an oral communicator and how well his memory is because he can tell stories verbatim.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you much success on your unschooling journey. <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or it could be a stage. My daughter went through a period from 10ish  <br/>
to 11ish where she watched a lot of TV and she&#39;s always unschooled  <br/>
and always had the freedom to watch as much as she wanted. She said  <br/>
she had writer&#39;s block. Perhaps she was filling up on stories. It  <br/>
didn&#39;t look like there was much going on. Yet now at 14 she writes a  <br/>
tremendous amount and watches little TV.<br/>
<br/>
And some other parents have said their preteens went through that  <br/>
phase too.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it was not wanting to miss what might be coming on. I  <br/>
think there were two factors. There were a lot of programs she liked  <br/>
and she felt like she was at the mercy of the programmers who might  <br/>
sneak a new episode in or replay one of her favorites. I think TiVo  <br/>
would have helped by letting her capture everything she wanted to  <br/>
watch and letting her watch it when she wanted to. But in the  <br/>
meantime she got older and her interests changed.<br/>

 <br/>
Right. I make up monkey platters for Duncan. I&#39;ll have pita chips with hummus, carrots & cucumbers with dill dip, sliced pears, nuts, graham crackers wth peanut butter, and chocolate chips. The kids *may* eat the chocolate chips first---I don&#39;t notice. But when they deliver the platter back to the kitchen, it&#39;s empty.<br/>
 <br/>
If the TV is just one choice of many---AND ALL THE CHOICES ARE EQUAL IN *MY* EYES!---then they will choose what they want because they *can*. They won&#39;t choose it because that&#39;s what&#39;s considered dessert---the forbidden fruit.<br/>
 <br/>
And how do you explain all of us who *have* stopped the arbitrary limiting? ANd our kids don&#39;t eat ice cream all day and are eager to drop TV for some other activity?<br/>
 <br/>
It works. It really does!<br/>

&gt; category as eating chocolate or ice cream all day, something that <br/>
&gt;even <br/>
&gt; as an unschooler I wouldn&#39;t allow - I still feel that I need to help <br/>
&gt; my child develop healthfully. So am I totally off-base on that? Does <br/>
&gt; anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not <br/>
&gt; particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just curious!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Susan<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s no bigger a part of our lives than any other thing, from books to <br/>
music to Legos. Just as ice cream or chocolate are no more or less <br/>
than a part of a whole balance of eating. Developing healthfully is <br/>
learning balance of things, not separating out certain things as &quot;bad <br/>
for you&quot; or &quot;only a little bit now and then&quot;. There are times when I <br/>
want lots of chocolate, so I eat lots of chocolate. There are times <br/>
when one or two individual chocolate morsels is plenty and there are <br/>
times when I&#39;d rather have strawberries. Just so, there are times when <br/>
I want lots of TV, times when I watch one or two favorites and that&#39;s <br/>
all and times when I am doing other things entirely. Balance. By <br/>
setting TV (or ice cream or cake or video games) out as something that <br/>
has to be rationed and earned (by finishing all the peas or reading 2 <br/>
chapters or spending an hour out in the yard), it sets those things <br/>
apart as more desirable *because* they are rationed. (BTW have you <br/>
ever considered the whole &#39;finish all your supper before you have <br/>
dessert concept? Basically what it is saying is fill yourself up and <br/>
then you can have what you want, but by that time you&#39;re full, but you <br/>
still want the cookie so you over fill - seems like if you just ate as <br/>
much peas and as much chicken and as much cookie as you wanted it <br/>
would all balance without over eating). DS calls ice cream et <br/>
al &#39;dessert&#39; since that&#39;s what it is called in the larger culture <br/>
(check a restaurant menu for instance). However, if he chooses, he can <br/>
have ice cream and then have a sandwich or can have both at the same <br/>
time (except the ice cream tends to get melty if he&#39;s going back and <br/>
forth). Manys the time that I&#39;ve brought a double chocolate donut home <br/>
from work (when our summer interns leave, for instance, tradition is <br/>
that they bring donuts on their last day. I&#39;ll grab one and bring it <br/>
home for DS). When I get home from work, dinner is usually cooking if <br/>
not ready already. I&#39;ll give him the donut. Sometimes he saves it <br/>
until after eating whatever is for dinner. Other times he eats the <br/>
whole thing right away. And sometimes he&#39;ll eat part then eat dinner <br/>
then eat the rest. Since it has no greater or lesser weight than <br/>
anything else, no emotional ties, no hint of &#39;forbidden or <br/>
restricted&#39;, he eats it as he chooses when he chooses in response to <br/>
what his body says at the time. Of the three of us (me, DH, and DS) DS <br/>
is the most likely to eat one cookie and stop or leave a dish of ice <br/>
cream half eaten because he is done eating ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Same for TV - he watches when he wants, what he wants, and when he is <br/>
done, he moves to something else (and often he&#39;s doing something else <br/>
in the middle of TV watching also) and vice versa - when he&#39;s done <br/>
inthe yard or playing with Legos or whatever (when he&#39;s filled up on <br/>
how much of it he wants) he can move to TV or video games if he <br/>
chooses, if he has a &#39;taste&#39; for it. Of us all, he is the least likely <br/>
to &#39;veg out&#39; in front of the TV. He&#39;ll leave the room or turn it off <br/>
or simply ignore it (as he chooses) when he doesn&#39;t find anything he <br/>
wants to watch, whereas DH and I will flip channels back and forth <br/>
rather than turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
But, in food and TV and other things, we&#39;re learning a lot about <br/>
balance and listening to our insides from DS and we&#39;re getting better <br/>
about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590345873">Hi Breezy:<br/>
<br/>
My 11 yo dd watched TV, played neopets and played PS2 almost non-stop <br/>
for 6 months while she was deschooling.  Now we enjoy all kinds of <br/>
things together.  We play PS2 and neopets together and watch some TV <br/>
together.  My biggest concern was the way she was shutting me out. Now <br/>
she can&#39;t stand it if I&#39;m not involved with what she is doing, (she&#39;s <br/>
my youngest and only child at home).<br/>
<br/>
Let your son deschool, you and your hubby need to deschool too. It is <br/>
not easy, I really struggled with whether I was ruining her life by <br/>
letting her do this stuff all day.  You will see the fruits of your <br/>
relaxing when this stage is over.<br/>

  I agree with you April.  As I read this discussion about TV, I wan to to say HUH?????  My kids learn so much form TV.  Right this minute they are watchinga History channel show about Houdinni.  I hear gasps of WOW, that is cool, Hey mom, come look at this  etc...  They had not heard of Houdinni before today, they were scrolling through the tv guide and one asked mom, who is Houdinni (thye even need help reading the name, but I was there for that!)  I gave a brief explanation based on what I knew.  They were curious, they wanted to watch, they learned, tv was the tool.   True learning happens when kids get to interact with stuff that is meaningful to them.  Tv is just one tool in making that happen.  It makes their world bigger, it seems to me, lack of tv would make their world smaller.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018804091">Of course every family will implement the ideas and philosophy of<br/>
unschooling differently. How unschooling looks will be different with each<br/>
family. No problems there. But TV isn&#39;t just another option if you refer to<br/>
it as the &quot;boob tube&quot;. This is a very negative connotation. This will be<br/>
reflected in the how much and what kind of an option it is to your kids. TV<br/>
can be a wonderful tool. It can be the source of a lot of learning. It can<br/>
be a much need way to relax and unwind. It can be a great bonding time.<br/>
Sometimes it is watched a lot, sometimes a little, every family will be<br/>
different. Even within our family we go in cycles and seasons. Sometimes we<br/>
can go days without it on, other times it&#39;s on all the time. Either way is<br/>
just as acceptable and never is it referred to in a derogatory way. How it<br/>
is referred to is a much bigger issue and concern than how much or little it<br/>
is watched. How do the kids feel when they really want to watch something,<br/>
but knowing to you it is a less desirable and good option. They might watch<br/>
it, but they will keep with them the knowledge that Mom thinks this it&#39;s is<br/>
just a &#39;boob tube&#39; and doesn&#39;t have any real value. Then they live with the<br/>
idea that something they like and want doesn&#39;t have value to Mom.  That&#39;s<br/>
not &#39;just another option&#39;, now it&#39;s a lesser choice or a bad choice<br/>
according to Mom.  Our words say a lot about what we think and convey to our<br/>
kids.<br/>

You may certainly refer to TV as &quot;the boob tube&quot; in your home. The connotation is negative and will probably effect how your family sees the TV. It will *seem* evil and not a good option.<br/>
 <br/>
But on *this* list, it is NOT to be referred to in a negative manner. <br/>
 <br/>
In an unschooling family, *everything* is educational, and TV is another tool. Vilifying it only makes it dangerous and something to be avoided. That&#39;s stupid.<br/>

I am new here, but I see that TV is a big part of a lot of people&#39;s <br/>
lives. I have always thought that watching TV all day fell in the same <br/>
category as eating chocolate or ice cream all day, something that even <br/>
as an unschooler I wouldn&#39;t allow -<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Who says I won&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; any of that???<br/>
My boys may certainly eat ice cream or chocolate all day. But they choose not to. Because they have a <br/>
REAL choice.<br/>
 <br/>
They may also choose to wacth TV all day. Sometimes they do, more often not. But it&#39;s a choice that <br/>
belongs to *them*. It&#39;s real.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve had days that I&#39;ve lain on the sofa ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT. Veging out. Law and Order or West Wing or <br/>
M*A*S*H marathons. You bet! I ate Ben & Jerry&#39;s for breakfast this morning. I can do whatever I want. And <br/>
someitmes I choose to do just that. Most days I don&#39;t. My children have that same freedom. Amazingly, <br/>
they choose a variety of foods and choose whether or not to turn the TV on or off.<br/>
 <br/>
True choice.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 I still feel that I need to help <br/>
my child develop healthfully. So am I totally off-base on that? Does <br/>
anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not <br/>
particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
You&#39;re totally off-base in your attempt.<br/>
 <br/>
Try modelling the behavior you&#39;d like to see. They really do want to be big and make good choices.<br/>
 <br/>
I certainly don&#39;t feel that TV is addictive or unhealthy or should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;---it&#39;s NOT.<br/>

If your starting point is calling the TV a boob tube, then don&#39;t you think that will color the reactions of the boobs who think it&#39;s fun to watch it? Won&#39;t that negative energy surrounding the kids choice of TV send back negative energy into the family?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not pro-TV  by the way. I&#39;m pro using positive words and thought patterns wherever possible. The more I glow about my kids, the more they glow in return. When I used more negatives labels in my thoughts and words, that&#39;s what I saw more of in my home.<br/>

It&#39;s important to remember that as unschoolers our goal is not to feed our kids a steady diet of TV. Our goal is to provide a rich, full and interesting life. It&#39;s to provide  them choices and opportunities for how they choose to spend their time. If TV is the best choice for them, we should look at why that is.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629126912">I guess I just don&#39;t understand the whole TV argument.  As an adult I&#39;m<br/>
drawn to my interests and the TV programs I watch (i.e. forensic science<br/>
shows like Cold Case Files and Forensic Files, and fashion with shows like<br/>
Project Runway) keep those interests alive in my busy life.  <br/>
<br/>
I see no difference in allowing my daughter to explore her interests and<br/>
that includes watching TV.  She likes animals so she&#39;s always watching the<br/>
Animal Planet network.  She obviously likes home decorating (at age 9) since<br/>
HGTV is on a lot in her room.  Yes, she still watches Cartoon Network and<br/>
Nick but it&#39;s not nearly as much as she did just a year ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t pooh-pooh any of her interests.  I let her live in freedom just as I<br/>
do.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s important to remember that as unschoolers our goal is not to feed our<br/>
kids a steady diet of TV. Our goal is to provide a rich, full and<br/>
interesting life. It&#39;s to provide  them choices and opportunities for how<br/>
they choose to spend their time. If TV is the best choice for them, we<br/>
should look at why that is. What are they getting from it or what are they<br/>
not getting in other activities that TV is providing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383436921">***I see that TV is a big part of a lot of people&#39;s <br/>
lives.***<br/>
<br/>
I would say it&#39;s more like TV is *one* part of a BIG life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Does anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not <br/>
particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)***<br/>
<br/>
Have you thought much about why you have negative feelings about TV? <br/>
I have an idea most who feel negatively about TV do so because all their<br/>
lives they&#39;ve heard negative things about TV.  Teachers and parents have<br/>
said too much TV is &quot;bad.&quot;   And after years of negative brainwashing<br/>
about TV people get comfortable blaming the TV for choices *they* make. <br/>
( I watched this movie instead of cleaning house, TV is like a drug!)  <br/>
<br/>
Educators at first thought TV was going to be a great tool of education. <br/>
 But a population of depression weary, war weary and post war Americans<br/>
found that TV entertainment was a delight in their joy starved lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon, teachers discovered kids would rather talk about the latest<br/>
episode of their favorite program then about William Henry Harrison and<br/>
would rather watch TV then do their homework.   But that&#39;s not a problem<br/>
with TV.  The problem all along was with boring teachers, mind numbing<br/>
curriculum, compulsory school attendance and the pointless busy work of<br/>
homework.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents found out kids would rather watch their favorite programs than do<br/>
chores or homework.  That&#39;s not a problem with TV,  that&#39;s a problem with<br/>
inconsiderate parents and you know, that homework thing again. <br/>
<br/>
Teachers told parents, &quot;Limit that TV time&quot; because they had to get kids<br/>
to do homework.   Parents told kids &quot;That TV is turning you into a<br/>
zombie!&quot; because kids liked  what the people on TV were saying more than<br/>
what their nagging mom was saying. <br/>
<br/>
If a kid grows up in a &quot;do this, do that&quot; household with week after week<br/>
of  &quot;do this, do that&quot; school, he&#39;d have to be an idiot not to want<br/>
something fun and wonderful of his own choosing.     <br/>
<br/>
Is TV really the problem if a mom is nagging, demeaning a child&#39;s choices<br/>
and badgering a kid to do something he doesn&#39;t want to do?  Is TV the<br/>
problem if a mom&#39;s telling a kid outright or in subtle ways he&#39;s weak<br/>
minded if he&#39;s watching  TV?   Is TV really the problem if it&#39;s more<br/>
pleasant than the controlling, demanding adults in a child&#39;s life? <br/>
<br/>
I think year after year kids grow up hearing how bad TV is.  TV is the<br/>
reason they won&#39;t clean their room.   TV is the reason they won&#39;t set the<br/>
table.  TV is the reason they&#39;re failing history.   TV is the reason they<br/>
won&#39;t listen to their moms.   So they reach adulthood, feeling guilty<br/>
over whatever little pleasure TV brings, having learned by example to<br/>
blame TV,  and vowing not to let evil TV ruin their kid&#39;s lives. <br/>
<br/>
I know what people say about TV.   Their kids are cranky if they watch<br/>
too much.  I&#39;d like everyone who ever said that to look at the dynamic<br/>
between parent and child and see what else is going on because there&#39;s<br/>
almost always something else.  Almost always one or both parents has a<br/>
negative attitude about TV and makes negative comments about TV in the<br/>
presence of their children and is making it hard for a child to just<br/>
peacefully enjoy TV.   <br/>
<br/>
As adults I&#39;m sure all of us have had what we thought was a great idea<br/>
and had someone shoot it down.  Nothing will make a person cop an<br/>
attitude faster than that feeling of being judged and found lacking by<br/>
someone we love.   Parents do that to kids in regards to TV (and other<br/>
things) all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s always easier to blame something else if our kids seem<br/>
unhappy or cranky but it will benefit every family member if as parents<br/>
we look to our own actions and behaviors first and consider how those<br/>
actions infuse our kid&#39;s environment with negative or positive energy.   <br/>

*****************<br/>
 <br/>
One of the ways Joyce explains things really resonates with me and I think  <br/>
it would be a good example of this.  She reminds us to think how would we  <br/>
approach our spouse about the same issue.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband has to be up very early in the morning for work.   Sometimes, he <br/>
gets glued to the computer and goes to bed late and then  can&#39;t go to sleep.  <br/>
He knows this and he has shared it with me.  So if  he&#39;s on the computer and it <br/>
is his &quot;bedtime&quot;, I might call his attention to the  time or that he has an <br/>
extra busy day tomorrow.  He is of course free to be  on the computer all night <br/>
long if he wants, but it is nice to know that someone  cares enough to help <br/>
him either make information known (he didn&#39;t realize the  time) or help make <br/>
the transition (&quot;I was just thinking the same thing&quot;).   Maybe I&#39;ve even said in <br/>
the past &quot;I notice that after you are on the computer,  you have a hard time <br/>
going to sleep.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It isn&#39;t controlling, it is just part of a supportive life together as  a <br/>
family.  It might take a child a little longer to make those connections,  but <br/>
they are invaluable!<br/>
