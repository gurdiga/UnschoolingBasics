<div id="ygrps-yiv-221449261">&quot;I do believe he&#39;s looking for a new direction, but either can&#39;t<br/>
verbalize where he wants to go, or, doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s out there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trevor used to get kinda cranky and irritable when he got restless at<br/>
that age, sometimes acted mean towards his family. It was hard to help<br/>
him find anything new, because he didn&#39;t particularly care for my<br/>
ideas usually.:)<br/>
He would eventually come up with something on his own, after bouncing<br/>
stuff off of me for a while. I was good for ideas, but everything came<br/>
from him in the end. He went through some of that restless/angst kinda<br/>
behavior from 9-11 roughly and now he&#39;s super mellow and interesting<br/>
and not a very moody guy at all. He&#39;s 16.5. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451139532">Thanks, Ren!!  Imh expert opinion, that&#39;s what I think it boils down to -- that he&#39;s looking for what&#39;s next.  I became a tad bit too bogged down in getting through the day to day with all parties surviving and avoiding incoming attacks, that I really didn&#39;t thoroughly sit down and think until yesterday.  Turns out, Christopher was an AVID gamer up until we bought the last game, then he went cold turkey. Done!!  I *do* think he&#39;s looking for something new, and we&#39;ll just keep sticking things in his way until we find something he likes.  <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t mind hunting, searching, et al, but I *do* mind the getting there!!  Hopefully this will get easier the further we go along!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks again!!<br/>
  <br/>
