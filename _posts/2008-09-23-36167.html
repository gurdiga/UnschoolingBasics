<div id="ygrps-yiv-118099997">Sometimes the situation warrants a break from negative people for a while.<br/>
I did that.  I didn&#39;t make any ultimatums or statements about it but simply<br/>
cut back going over to my folks for some time.<br/>

My friends wouldn&#39;t dare tell me how to raise Karl.  I&#39;ve only had a couple<br/>
of misunderstandings which a friend brought up to me in order to apologize.<br/>
It was no big deal.<br/>

Family is different.  I simply stopped engaging in any debate about<br/>
*anything* and changed the subject whenever the conversation turned to<br/>
something that might get a little contentious.<br/>

<br/>
More likely to receive criticism because confidence means not being worried<br/>
about someone&#39;s opinion of me so much that I can&#39;t hear the things I might<br/>
find useful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m less likely to receive useful info if I don&#39;t have the confidence to<br/>

there is nothing profound about it.  If you are confident, even if you<br/>
just ACT confident, it makes a HUGE difference whether people hand out<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511998426">My kids are younger than &quot;school age&quot;, but I never get any flak from <br/>
anyone about any of my parenting choices (extended nursing, <br/>
cosleeping, respectful parenting, planning on homeschooling, etc).  I <br/>
have never figured out if it&#39;s because people in general either:<br/>
1) don&#39;t care what I do, <br/>
2) think I am a nut, <br/>
3) consider me too intimidating to challenge or <br/>
4) know I don&#39;t care about what they think about my personal choices<br/>
5) are overwhelmed by the confidence I exude :)  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is is ok with me!  It&#39;s hard enough to do what I feel is <br/>

without someone else trying to sabotage it!<br/>

Same here.<br/>
I think if you are truly confident in your choices, then you feel less<br/>
of a need to defend anything. I can usually make a couple of great<br/>
points that leave them unable to respond and then change the subject.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601286787">To temporarily deal with criticism, one technique called fogging is a way to<br/>
partly agree with disagreeable statements using qualified yes&#39;s.  With<br/>
perfect strangers, this technique is fine for the whole interchange.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling my way around something new, I may keep the criticism at a<br/>
low level, even with people I know well.  Often I lead in with fogging and<br/>
then decide in the conversation if I want to find out more, either right<br/>
then or later.  If I want to go beyond fogging, I ask more about a person&#39;s<br/>
thinking.  I may repeat something to clarify.  Sometimes someone tells me a<br/>
perception about me that I&#39;m not aware anyone would have, and it may give me<br/>
the idea to change my presentation a bit or decide to do something a little<br/>
differently.  Some people just want to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.therapy-now.com/assert_tech.htm">http://www.therapy-now.com/assert_tech.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
FOGGING This method is used to combat criticism. It basically involves<br/>
agreeing with the other person enough to let them think you [might] follow<br/>
their advice.<br/>
<br/>
In this example, someone is criticizing the way you look:<br/>
Other Person: Your skirt is kind of short. Don&#39;t you think you should wear<br/>
them longer? The style is longer skirts now.<br/>
You: You&#39;re probably right. The style is longer skirts now.<br/>
Other Person: I think that if your hair was shorter, it might be easier to<br/>
take care of.<br/>
You: You could be right. Short hair is easier.<br/>
Other Person: You&#39;d look much more feminine if you used lip liner.<br/>
You: You&#39;re right. I hadn&#39;t thought about it. I might look more feminine<br/>
with lip liner.<br/>
Other Person: You really should set a good example for your daughter. She<br/>
copies you.<br/>
You: Yes, she does copy me.<br/>
<br/>
Fogging is useful in situations where you want to minimize communication.<br/>
You don&#39;t want to listen to advice and you don&#39;t want to argue. Fogging is<br/>
not always good for situations with partners or friends where you wish to<br/>
keep communication open and give the other an opportunity to get their<br/>
feelings out. In such instances, it&#39;s best to listen to other people until<br/>
they&#39;ve spoken their mind. Then you can comment.<br/>
<br/>
I still have all the space I need to do what I want to do.  I haven&#39;t given<br/>
up, I haven&#39;t answered for myself, and I haven&#39;t fought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t totally agree with the definition above from the site I gave.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of fogging as agreeing with someone enough to get them to<br/>
think anything.  I don&#39;t usually care *what* they think.  It&#39;s their mind,<br/>
not mine.<br/>
<br/>
Fogging the way I use it is to agree as much as you honestly can and not<br/>
explain why you don&#39;t agree with someone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Persistent positivity!<br/>
<br/>
That sounds silly, I know, but I find I rarely receive criticism <br/>
when I&#39;m focused on the positive aspects of my kids and our life <br/>
together. I don&#39;t vent about my kids to friends or extended family - <br/>
although my partner and I vent to each other from time to time. To <br/>
anyone out of the daily reality of unschooling life - its Fantastic! <br/>
My kids are So Cool! They do the Neatest Things All the Time! And <br/>
really, its true, they are fabulous people, and I love our <br/>
unschooling life. <br/>
<br/>
The upshot of all this positivity is that people rarely try to tell <br/>
me I&#39;m &quot;doing it wrong&quot;. Sometimes I&#39;ll get questions like &quot;but <br/>
don&#39;t you think they need discipline?&quot; and I&#39;ll tell some happy <br/>
story of one of my kids persevering and succeeding in a personal <br/>
goal, or being kind and thoughtful, or whatever. Or, when Mo was <br/>
still putting her shoes on the opposite feet, for example, I&#39;d smile <br/>
brightly at the adult pointing this fact out to me and say &quot;oh, yes <br/>
she&#39;s So Independent! She loves to Dress Herself!&quot; as if that were <br/>
the most wonderful thing in the world (it was!). <br/>
<br/>
The other wonderful effect of being actively positive, is that it <br/>
helps *me* when things aren&#39;t going so well. When I find myself <br/>
getting bogged down, complaining to myself and my partner about the <br/>
kids, I can start to actively shift my words and thoughts to <br/>
something more positive. For me, since I seem to think better &quot;in <br/>
print&quot; I&#39;ll sometimes start a long, whiny post for this board or <br/>
the &quot;Always&quot; board, get halfway through and start editing. By the <br/>
time I&#39;m done I have a paen to my wonderful kids and you&#39;d never <br/>
know I logged on to complain about them. Even better, I don&#39;t feel <br/>
like complaining any more.<br/>
<br/>
There, now y&#39;all know my secret ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; What is it in person that makes them more/less likely to receive<br/>
&gt; &gt; criticism?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Persistent positivity!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That sounds silly, I know, but I find I rarely receive criticism<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m focused on the positive aspects of my kids and our life<br/>
&gt; together. I don&#39;t vent about my kids to friends or extended family -<br/>
&gt; although my partner and I vent to each other from time to time. To<br/>
&gt; anyone out of the daily reality of unschooling life - its Fantastic!<br/>
&gt; My kids are So Cool! They do the Neatest Things All the Time! And<br/>
&gt; really, its true, they are fabulous people, and I love our<br/>
&gt; unschooling life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The upshot of all this positivity is that people rarely try to tell<br/>
&gt; me I&#39;m &quot;doing it wrong&quot;. Sometimes I&#39;ll get questions like &quot;but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t you think they need discipline?&quot; and I&#39;ll tell some happy<br/>
&gt; story of one of my kids persevering and succeeding in a personal<br/>
&gt; goal, or being kind and thoughtful, or whatever. Or, when Mo was<br/>
&gt; still putting her shoes on the opposite feet, for example, I&#39;d smile<br/>
&gt; brightly at the adult pointing this fact out to me and say &quot;oh, yes<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s So Independent! She loves to Dress Herself!&quot; as if that were<br/>
&gt; the most wonderful thing in the world (it was!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other wonderful effect of being actively positive, is that it<br/>
&gt; helps *me* when things aren&#39;t going so well. When I find myself<br/>
&gt; getting bogged down, complaining to myself and my partner about the<br/>
&gt; kids, I can start to actively shift my words and thoughts to<br/>
&gt; something more positive. For me, since I seem to think better &quot;in<br/>
&gt; print&quot; I&#39;ll sometimes start a long, whiny post for this board or<br/>
&gt; the &quot;Always&quot; board, get halfway through and start editing. By the<br/>
&gt; time I&#39;m done I have a paen to my wonderful kids and you&#39;d never<br/>
&gt; know I logged on to complain about them. Even better, I don&#39;t feel<br/>
&gt; like complaining any more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There, now y&#39;all know my secret ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310996513">I agree.  People will avoid messing with a person who doesn&#39;t fix their<br/>
uglies.  Cuts out a whole lot of rude (nonconstructive) criticism.  :)  To<br/>
someone in a power position or close, like an employer or a spouse, it might<br/>
yield some unintended backlash.  (And maybe it&#39;s to be used with caution in<br/>
those situations.)<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;don&#39;t want to disagree&quot; line is great!  It can be taken to be sincere<br/>
and caring and not the least bit nasty.  Sort of gently putting someone on<br/>
their toes... with the ball in their court.  Very handy.<br/>

          I found that to be so true for me also. My best friend of 27<br/>
years does not speak to me anymore since I told her I was going to<br/>
homeschool and my sister who I thought would go through the roof and<br/>
ask me if I was nuts, stands behind me 100%. <br/>
