<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218935062">Hi all, <br/>
In case you are in Southern California, you may want to know about this <br/>
workshop.  Sunday there is a unique peace education workshop in beautiful Topanga <br/>
Canyon that will interest some of you.  The following info is from Kim <br/>
Driscoll.  Her number is listed near the end of the message to RSVP, or you can reply <br/>
to me and I will let her know if you are coming.  Lots of lovely families, <br/>
interested in learning and teaching about the great peacemakers in history, NVC <br/>
and conflict resolution skills, will be attending.<br/>
To quote Kim, the organizer of the event: &quot;There have been thousands of young <br/>
people, and many educators, who have been inspired by the work of Colman <br/>
McCarthy. By having his son John come to speak about his work, and his father&#39;s <br/>
work, the hope is to spread the word, spread the books, and spread the vision of <br/>
a world at peace.&quot;<br/>
So, please share this with anyone who might be interested, and I hope you can <br/>
join us there.~Robin<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dear Friends,  <br/>
&gt; In 1982 Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy was invited to teach a<br/>
&gt; course on writing at an impoverished public school in Washington, D.C. He<br/>
&gt; responded, &quot;I&#39;d rather teach peace.&quot; Since then, he has had more than 5,000<br/>
&gt; students in his classes on nonviolence, pacifism, and conflict management. <br/>

&gt; &quot;A question settled in my mind a few years ago and refused to leave until I<br/>
