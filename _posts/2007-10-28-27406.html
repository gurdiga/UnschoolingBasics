<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773902112">Meet Juliette Low, Founder of America&#39;s Girl Scouts<br/>
<br/>
The women&#39;s alliance will host a living history performance on Tuesday<br/>
the 6th of November at 7 pm at the First Unitarian Society of Newton,<br/>
1326 Washting St, Newton, MA when Kate Carney, award winning Stand-up<br/>
Historian, in costume and character as the free-sprited &quot;Daisy&quot; Low,<br/>
reveals how she lived life to its fullest<br/>
before she found Scouting – and her life&#39;s true purpose .  Helping<br/>
girls find their talents, she discovered her own!   Listeners will<br/>
interact with this eccentric visionary as she tells her funny, moving<br/>
life story – and what it was like to live from the Civil War through<br/>
World War I. This is a 45 minute long family program for people age<br/>
nine and up.<br/>
<br/>
This will be an entertaining and educational evening.<br/>
