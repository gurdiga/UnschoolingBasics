<div id="ygrps-yiv-851332251">I certainly will read Unconditional Parenting and would like a reminder of the name of Rue Cream&#39;s book and want to hear about other books that might help us.  I think children who have developmental delays or emotional scars (mine are clearly significantly harmed by my marriage&#39;s years of woe and our subsequent divorce) are extra confusing.  My kids don&#39;t fight all day, and our times of sweetness are increasing daily since we fully committed to RU (not quite a month ago).  This method of life suits me constitutionally, so that helps a lot.  However, there is a lot of very cruel talk towards me and rather a lot of hitting between all of them.  We have been to a therapist off and on since 1996, and that has helped.   But it really wears me down to be spoken to so cruelly.  I have modeled patience, honoring all people, etc beyond what I could have imagined.  Lots of people have told me things like &quot;you must be the most patient person on the planet.&quot;  But I can snap.   And<br/>
 sometimes advice that works on children who are less scarred or quirky is hard to apply because these kids can and do hurt others (kids and adults) quite badly. I really appreciate the concerns of the person below regarding the kids&#39; future relationship.  My oldest just pretty much avoids the 2 younger ones so as to cut down on the screaming and fighting, and longs for times they are away.  And they so often speak to me like I am a stupid erring servant.  I am patient with this most of the time (depending on what is happenning, like running late to work I may have to ignore it).  But last night I snapped and said sharply &quot;Oh!  I am so tired of this!  How could you speak to me this way!  I wouldn&#39;t talk to a dog in the gutter like that!  I am a person with feelings!  A real person!&quot;  I specifically explained (again, again) how it made me feel.  I wanted to escape! I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to model tolerating verbal abuse which I feel like I am doing sometimes.  Yet<br/>
 Iwant to model patience and be their safe haven too.  OK, guess that&#39;s the problem.  How to be their safe haven when they are abusive to me and I don&#39;t want them to learn to abuse others either.  Thanks! <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is trying to be rude or disrespectful to you. Let me put a bit of a different spin on it. I have two girls 7 & 8. My 7 year old has ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder and Non-Verbal Learning Disability. My 7 year olds social skills and ability to cope are more like that of a 3 year old. She can not get along with her sister, and she is bigger than her older sister. I can not just tell them to work it out or play together when the 7 year old is pummeling the 8 year old. For my 7 year old it&#39;s not about attention. She has no self control, no impulse control and no ability to keep her hands to herself. I as a parent have to step in and protect my 8 year old. I have to step in and model appropriate behavior, and I have to separate them if need be. And I can&#39;t turn away. It does bother me when my 7 year old hits, punches, pinches, bites....... you name it. I can&#39;t let my 8 year old be tortured. When my husband and I are long gone, it&#39;s just gonna<br/>
be the two of them. It&#39;s my responsibility to help them form a loving, life long relationship.<br/>

I had an older brother who was just plain violent. If my mom would have forced<br/>
us to &quot;play&quot; with each other exclusively, I&#39;d be dead. Sad part is that&#39;s not<br/>
an exaggeration. Plus, he would have attacked her which he finally did when he <br/>
was 17yo, after attacking me. He had one weakness; a sensitive scalp. Somehow<br/>
I had managed to pin him by holding his hair at the back of his head, and holding his<br/>
head down to his knees so he couldn&#39;t hit me. We danced like that till my mom <br/>
finally got home and opened the front door. I yelled for them to leave the door open and move. I shoved him and ran so fast out the door and kept right on running. I told her<br/>
I would never come back as long as he lived there. She kicked him out then blamed it on me. The truth was, that when he lost me as his target, he attacked her, and she had finally<br/>
felt the abuse first hand.<br/>
<br/>
This shaped the way I raised my kids. I don&#39;t believe in hitting my kids and I have never allowed them to hit each other. This doesn&#39;t mean it has never happened, but it&#39;s been rare.<br/>
I think groups like this and the books you all have mentioned are very needed in this world.<br/>

    I certainly will read Unconditional Parenting and would like a <br/>
reminder of the<br/>
name of Rue Cream&#39;s book and want to hear about other books that might <br/>
help us.<br/>

<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info">http://www.freechild.info</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I think children who have developmental delays or emotional scars (mine <br/>
are<br/>
clearly significantly harmed by my marriage&#39;s years of woe and our <br/>
subsequent<br/>
divorce) are extra confusing.  My kids don&#39;t fight all day, and our <br/>
times of<br/>
sweetness are increasing daily since we fully committed to RU (not <br/>
quite a month<br/>
ago).  This method of life suits me constitutionally, so that helps a <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good. It can be *very* healing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
However, there is a lot of very cruel talk towards me and rather a lot <br/>
of<br/>
hitting between all of them.  We have been to a therapist off and on <br/>
since 1996,<br/>
and that has helped.   But it really wears me down to be spoken to so <br/>
cruelly.<br/>
I have modeled patience, honoring all people, etc beyond what I could <br/>
have<br/>
imagined.  Lots of people have told me things like &quot;you must be the <br/>
most patient<br/>
person on the planet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you said, &quot;DON&#39;T TALK TO ME THAT WAY!!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;re working so hard to be kind and gentle and even-keeled <br/>
that they don&#39;t know we&#39;re at the end of the rope. Sometimes we need to <br/>
be heard too, and &quot;I CAN&#39;T TAKE IT ANY MORE&quot; is OK.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But I can snap.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We all do. And it&#39;s not a bad thing for the kids to see you snap AND <br/>
(more importantly) how you deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes advice that works on children who are less scarred or <br/>
quirky is hard<br/>
to apply because these kids can and do hurt others (kids and adults) <br/>
quite<br/>
badly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us some examples? Everything&#39;s relative---*how* badly? And <br/>
remind me how old they are. ??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And they so often speak to me like I am a stupid erring servant.  I am <br/>
patient<br/>
with this most of the time (depending on what is happenning, like <br/>
running late<br/>
to work I may have to ignore it).  But last night I snapped and said <br/>
sharply<br/>
&quot;Oh!  I am so tired of this!  How could you speak to me this way!  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t<br/>
talk to a dog in the gutter like that!  I am a person with feelings!  A <br/>
real<br/>
person!&quot;  I specifically explained (again, again) how it made me feel.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OK---you DO! &lt;g&gt; But you&#39;re doing it angrily? If they&#39;re getting <br/>
*anger* in return---maybe that&#39;s what they expect and react in kind. <br/>
Kind of like when someone hits you, you hit back in anger---but with <br/>
words. When mine hit me when they were little, rather than get angry <br/>
(which was my first response), I would get &quot;hurt.&quot; They would respond <br/>
with compassion instead of anger. Am I explaining that well?<br/>
<br/>
Someone hits you (physically or verbally) and you react with <br/>
anger---either hitting back or yelling---you evoke anger in THEM.<br/>
<br/>
Someone hits you and you react with surprise and hurt---you evoke their <br/>
compassion and sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hard thing for me to change---my brother and I fought like <br/>
cats and dogs, and my parents both used spankings---so hitting made me <br/>
ANGRY. Changing that feeling to hurt (which is what it IS, <br/>
REALLY!---that anger is just a defense.) is an honest reaction and will <br/>
evoke a different response.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy with my kids---but if Ben or my parents hurt me, I still <br/>
react immediately with anger. I&#39;m *really* hurt and should show it, I <br/>
guess. I need to work on that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-==-=<br/>
<br/>
  I wanted to escape! I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to model tolerating <br/>
verbal abuse which<br/>
I feel like I am doing sometimes.  Yet I want to model patience and be <br/>
their safe haven too.  OK, guess that&#39;s the<br/>
problem.  How to be their safe haven when they are abusive to me and I <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
want them to learn to abuse others either.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
During a cool spell when everyone is getting along, discuss the <br/>
problem. Say that you&#39;re feeling tromped upon and don&#39;t know how to <br/>
handle it. Ask for their ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Did your husband treat you that way? Verbally abusive? Is that the <br/>
model they&#39;re used to? Maybe let them know that they will have a hard <br/>
time surviving a marriage (as y&#39;all did) if that is the way they expect <br/>
a marriage to look.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know of a family with GOOD communication skills? Can you visit <br/>
and talk with them? You can come down here a few days! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do THEY want to change? Have you asked them? Do they like living like <br/>
that? How do they think you can fix it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s that yucky. It IS fixable...IF they will work at it. <br/>
Their ages will matter though. Just to get everyone on board.<br/>
