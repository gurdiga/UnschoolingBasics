<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919837918">&quot;I may never be able to undo the damage done to me by public school or my family, but I can move forward and give love and respect to my children. I can communicate with them in a manner that doesn&#39;t destroy their curiosity and creativity or squash their self-worth. I can work to reverse the damage done by other family that thinks control and authority is the way to parent by showing that I don&#39;t have to be that way. At least, I hope I can.&quot; <br/>

You can.  Have you ever read &quot;Parenting from the Inside Out&quot;?  Great book to help parent yourself as well as your children in a healthy way.  It helped me so much!!!  Too many of our parents fell prey to society&#39;s pushing and shoving children into a mold.  I&#39;m so glad to see so many parents getting back to good parenting.  <br/>
