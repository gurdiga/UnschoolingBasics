Well it&#39;s not that he never hears thank you.  It&#39;s that pre-USing the<br/>
major commodities around here were the conventional things like toeing<br/>
the line with keeping a clean room and helping to clean up.  So I<br/>
think they still see it as having more value than something else.<br/>
Maybe.  I&#39;m not entirely sure what anyone but me actually thinks.  And<br/>
I kind of panicked there and didn&#39;t want to hurt John or Liam.<br/>

said something like, &quot;Good job!&quot; Expressing appreciation for <br/>
something is not the same. I always try to express my appreciation <br/>
for things the people around me do.<br/>

to do or hasn&#39;t found that one or a few things that he really likes <br/>
doing. You could try giving him some suggestions of things he could <br/>
do with the understanding that he doesn&#39;t have to, no expectations <br/>
attached, or asked him if there are particular things he would like <br/>
to do. The other thing I can think of is to express your <br/>
appreciation for other things that John does. Those things don&#39;t <br/>
have to be tied to you, either. It could be the way he plays a video <br/>
game or dances around when he&#39;s listening to music, fun things.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh? Sure you can - just as you&#39;d ask a spouse or friend for a hand when<br/>
you actually NEED a hand - for instance, I&#39;ll ask DS to get the mayo out<br/>
of the fridge for me while I&#39;m making tuna sandwiches, just as I&#39;d ask<br/>
DH if he was closer to the fridge at the time and it&#39;s something I&#39;d go<br/>
ahead and do if I was the closest person to the fridge (as in, I&#39;m<br/>
making sandwiches and they&#39;re in another room entirely). Last night, DS<br/>
got out the pretzel sticks and the pumpkin butter and asked me to open<br/>
the pumpkin butter (it&#39;s actually quite tasty and the pumpkin butter was<br/>
one of our &#39;experiments&#39; last fall - YUMMY). So, I did. Then, when he<br/>
was done, he brought the pretzel sticks and the pumpkin butter back to<br/>
the table and closed the pumpkin butter (the jar was a little stuck<br/>
getting it open but closed easily). I was reading a magazine article at<br/>
the table and said &quot;Hey, would you put the pumpkin butter back in the<br/>
fridge? Thanks&quot; (as he took it to the fridge).<br/>
<br/>
What the root of things is is getting out of the habit/mindset of<br/>
demanding that they do &quot;chores&quot; in return for something (praise, money,<br/>
&#39;privileges&#39;, etc) or &quot;to teach them a lesson in responsibility&quot; or<br/>
whatever. Asking for assistance when you need it is something *everyone*<br/>
in the family should feel free to do. Receiving appreciation is<br/>
something that should be reciprocal among all family members.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your new &quot;rule&quot; is &quot;Don&#39;t ask them to do anything?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like you are looking to people on this list to tell you how to  <br/>
parent. We talk about it, we offer our own experience, we offer our  <br/>
analysis, our opinions - but we&#39;re not telling you what you are to do  <br/>
or not to do. When the principles make sense to you, you&#39;ll follow  <br/>
them because they make sense, not because someone told you how to do it,<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have chore lists. We don&#39;t tie allowances to working around  <br/>
the house. We don&#39;t punish for not doing house or yard work. We often  <br/>
live with bigger messes than we would if we made our kids do  <br/>
housework, too. We focus on doing our housework with joy - we focus on  <br/>
it being a choice that we make for good and sweet reasons, to make our  <br/>
home a comfortable place where we love to be.<br/>
<br/>
If what you understood was that you weren&#39;t to ask them to do  <br/>
anything, then you&#39;re missing the bigger part of the picture. Live  <br/>
joyfully. Treat children like real people whose feelings and wants and  <br/>
needs and interests REALLY matter, but, at the same time, remember  <br/>
that they are children who don&#39;t see the world through adult eyes and  <br/>
don&#39;t have adult concerns. Live &quot;together&quot; - this means live in ways  <br/>
that bring joy into family life. Forcing housework and yard work on  <br/>
kids doesn&#39;t bring joy. Working together can bring great joy, though.  <br/>
Rosie came in while I was cleaning the kitchen and we were talking.  <br/>
After a few minutes I handed her a dish towel and asked, &quot;Want to dry  <br/>
while we talk?&quot; We spent 20 minutes doing dishes together and it was  <br/>
VERY sweet. She won&#39;t think of doing dishes as a terrible task to be  <br/>
avoided, she is building joy-filled memories, instead. A few days  <br/>
later, the dishes had piled up and we were super busy. I left to go do  <br/>
some errands and said, &quot;Hey, if you have time and you feel like it, it  <br/>
would be great if you could make some headway on the kitchen mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? I came home and she&#39;d cleaned the kitchen. I shouted from  <br/>
the kitchen, &quot;Hey - great, you did it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was watching tv and she asked me, &quot;Hey mom, can you get me a glass  <br/>
of water when you get a chance?&quot; I did it immediately - got a big  <br/>
glass and even put ice in it. She thanked me.<br/>
<br/>
So it was a big sweet thank-fest! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
MANY times I&#39;ve mentioned something about the kitchen being a mess and  <br/>
nobody else did it and it got worse and then I finally got time and  <br/>
did it. That&#39;s okay, too. I really am happy to have the sweet times to  <br/>
savor and probably my biggest regret is that I occasionally stressed  <br/>
out, got mad, shamed and angered the kids when they were littler and I  <br/>
was still demanding housework. Wish I could have a &quot;do over&quot; on that.  <br/>
Still, time seems to have healed those old wounds and housework has  <br/>
ceased to be any kind of issue.<br/>
<br/>
Karen - it concerned me to hear you saying how much you love your son  <br/>
and you&#39;re so glad he&#39;s your son, etc., because it felt that doing  <br/>
housework was being treated like WAY too big a deal. Yes, it is nice  <br/>
that your 9 yo did it, but was he doing it because he wanted it done  <br/>
or to get your positive attention? Seems like his brother thinks he  <br/>
was doing it to get on your good side - and was angered that you &quot;fell  <br/>
for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thanking him, another option would be to have said  <br/>
something positive about how it feels to have done it..&quot;Great! Now you  <br/>
have room to play with your Legos.&quot; Or whatever is true in your  <br/>
particular situation. Draw his attention away from doing it to get  <br/>
praise from you and more to the benefits/reasons to do it for himself.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like we write that we don&#39;t have bedtimes or require <br/>
chores or limit food----and everyone thinks the kids run WILD and never <br/>
sleep and trash the house and never help and only eat sugar.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t *ask*. It&#39;s just that we&#39;re OK hearing &quot;no.&quot; <br/>
Asking the kids to pick up or take out the trash here isn&#39;t an ORDER. <br/>
They have every right to say no. And do, occasionally. But not often <br/>
because they *want* to help. And they *more* often do things without <br/>
being asked at all.<br/>
<br/>
Ask. Don&#39;t have any expectations. Be respectful of their time and <br/>
abilities. Don&#39;t nag. If they say they&#39;ll do something and don&#39;t, don&#39;t <br/>
get mad: realize that they&#39;re young and still figuring things out and <br/>
maybe forgot or got busy or got distracted.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;ve had chores or been expected to do for a long time, it&#39;s best <br/>
NOT to ask for a while, so that they can start to heal from your <br/>
earlier demands. But after they heal (and it sounds as if that&#39;s what <br/>
happened with *one* child), they&#39;ll start DOing because they WANT to.<br/>

<br/>
OK we haven&#39;t always done this way of parenting or living and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to change that.  To that end I haven&#39;t asked the boys to do<br/>
anything.  Three times this week Liam (9) pitched in and washed some<br/>
dishes and cleaned their room without being asked to do so.  When he<br/>
told me he was clearly looking for praise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was looking for appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I felt (and may have been<br/>
wrong but in the moment I went with my gut) that praising him was the<br/>
right thing to do.  So I said &quot;Hey thank you very much.  That was a<br/>
big help to me.&quot;  He was happy and it was exactly what I would have<br/>
said to my husband had he done it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then my 11 yr old was upset<br/>
because he said &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that Liam got to do that and<br/>
I didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That Liam got to clean? Or got thanked? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ARGH what do I do there?  At the time I said something like &quot;Well, he<br/>
just did it.  I didn&#39;t ask him to but he did it to help out and I<br/>
appreciate it when I get help.&quot;  I was trying not to take anything<br/>
away from Liam while comforting John.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not getting why John needs comforting?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think he was upset?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I did tell John that I loved<br/>
him and was glad he was my son but I didn&#39;t know how to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What needs fixing?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The<br/>
option to pitch in and help is always there, there is plenty to do in<br/>
a day around the house.  Liam doesn&#39;t always do things like that.  So<br/>
it&#39;s not as if John wouldn&#39;t have the chance.  He just doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to...but he doesn&#39;t want Liam getting praise I think.  I really don&#39;t<br/>
know.  I probably screwed this up.  This is so hard when there is more<br/>
than one kid to tend to especially when their needs directly conflict<br/>
or preempt each others&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it sounds as if you did everything right.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something amiss with John and *something*. I think that&#39;s where <br/>
to look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186701488">I&#39;m not going to quote everyone because it&#39;s cumbersome but what you<br/>
all said is the basic stuff behind not asking.  For too long doing<br/>
what they were TOLD was a commodity in this house so I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
asking/demanding anything but not to touch each other in mean ways (ie<br/>
punching etc) because that&#39;s just too far for me.  They fight less now<br/>
though because they are less stressed.  But yes, as a transition from<br/>
the old way I&#39;ve stopped asking them to do anything.  TBH though I<br/>
thought the majority of you never asked your kids to do anything at<br/>
all.  But with mine, the past has been &quot;I&#39;m bigger and control the<br/>
resources so do it or I&#39;ll be mad&quot; and I&#39;m trying to heal us all from<br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737104503">&quot;Hey thank you very much. That was a<br/>
big help to me.&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  That is not praised. It sounded like you appreciated his help. I say thank you to my kids anyway. The difference is in the intent.<br/>
  I say thank you because I mean it not because I want to reinforce the positive ( in my opinion) behavior.<br/>

          OK we haven&#39;t always done this way of parenting or living and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to change that. To that end I haven&#39;t asked the boys to do<br/>
anything. Three times this week Liam (9) pitched in and washed some<br/>
dishes and cleaned their room without being asked to do so. When he<br/>
told me he was clearly looking for praise. I felt (and may have been<br/>
wrong but in the moment I went with my gut) that praising him was the<br/>
right thing to do. So I said &quot;Hey thank you very much. That was a<br/>
big help to me.&quot; He was happy and it was exactly what I would have<br/>
said to my husband had he done it. Then my 11 yr old was upset<br/>
because he said &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that Liam got to do that and<br/>
I didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ARGH what do I do there? At the time I said something like &quot;Well, he<br/>
just did it. I didn&#39;t ask him to but he did it to help out and I<br/>
appreciate it when I get help.&quot; I was trying not to take anything<br/>
away from Liam while comforting John. I did tell John that I loved<br/>
him and was glad he was my son but I didn&#39;t know how to fix it. The<br/>
option to pitch in and help is always there, there is plenty to do in<br/>
a day around the house. Liam doesn&#39;t always do things like that. So<br/>
it&#39;s not as if John wouldn&#39;t have the chance. He just doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to...but he doesn&#39;t want Liam getting praise I think. I really don&#39;t<br/>
know. I probably screwed this up. This is so hard when there is more<br/>
than one kid to tend to especially when their needs directly conflict<br/>
or preempt each others&#39;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went through quite a long time where I didn&#39;t ask the boys to do<br/>
anything, because we, too, were healing from my controlling ways with<br/>
cleaning. (Why is it I could let go of so much, but not that? It took<br/>
a while!) But now I&#39;ll ask - and honor whatever answer they give. More<br/>
often than not, Evan (15) will jump in and help. Seth (9) doesn&#39;t.<br/>
He&#39;s the kind of kid lots of people would say needs more limits,<br/>
because he&#39;s very... contrary. At first, I wondered, too, because some<br/>
people say sometimes boys respond best to firm limits, especially the<br/>
ones that like to push. That&#39;s why I hang out here! Because that<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem right in my heart. I think he&#39;s strong-willed and<br/>
contrary for a reason.<br/>

And that&#39;s probably what they needed. But it&#39;s NOT a forever thing...as <br/>
you have discovered. They just need to heal from the previous damage.<br/>

Really? And you read the archives?<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t demand. We don&#39;t require. But we do ask. And it is perfectly <br/>
acceptable for the kids to say no---just like any other human---adult <br/>
OR child.<br/>
<br/>
But as this as a way of life, they hardly ever do. Because they know <br/>
it&#39;s the kind thing to do.<br/>

&quot;There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its <br/>
hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.&quot;  ~Illusions<br/>

antiauthoritarianism helped me see my own. I was always so...<br/>
obedient! On the outside. hee hee  But would *self* sabotage as a kind<br/>
of twisted way of &quot;getting back&quot; at da man. Now I can express my own<br/>
rebelliousness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288114786">~~OK now I&#39;m confused.  I thought I wasn&#39;t to ask them to do anything?~~<br/>
<br/>
So if we say don&#39;t ask your kids to do anything, you&#39;ll do what we say?;)<br/>
<br/>
Too much right/wrong here. There aren&#39;t unschooling &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;right<br/>
and wrong&quot; to follow. Just ideas about how to parent more connected<br/>
and peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
I see your logic in not asking for a while, to initiate healing. Nice!<br/>
But treating them as useful human beings is ok too.:) As long as there<br/>
isn&#39;t an agenda behind a request, it&#39;s just a request right?<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of it going on today, in preparation for Sierra&#39;s<br/>
birthday. &quot;Here, you grab the cake and I&#39;ll get the soda&quot; or &quot;Would<br/>
you get the scissors from downstairs and bring the cat down with <br/>
you?&quot; Lotsa stuff like that. <br/>
<br/>
We were all working together with a common goal in mind...getting<br/>
ready for friends to come celebrate! It was fun. There WAS expectation<br/>
that the person being requested would help out, because they had<br/>
indicated their willingness! The expectation was there because of what<br/>
was happening right in front of us, because of willingness to share<br/>
the experience. No expectation existed outside of the activity<br/>
everyone was willingly participating in.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t get that right now&quot; is an acceptable answer. I still have<br/>
chips on the stairs that Jalen didn&#39;t want to clean up after he<br/>
spilled them. It takes less energy to go clean them up than to nag<br/>
him. It&#39;s a natural give and take.  <br/>
<br/>
I make requests of others every day. I fulfill requests for others<br/>
everyday. It&#39;s just how we live. Knowing you have a choice, children<br/>
knowing they truly have a choice makes all the difference  in how it<br/>
flows.<br/>

still expected him to do them. I tried to be &quot;lenient&quot; about it by not <br/>
telling him he had to stop what he was doing or expecting it to be <br/>
done a certain way. I still expected it to be done, though. He didn&#39;t <br/>
really have the choice of saying no. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what I <br/>
would&#39;ve done if he had said no. I probably would&#39;ve ranted and raved <br/>
and whined and complained about having to do everything myself. He <br/>
never did say no. He just wouldn&#39;t do whatever it was. Once I realized <br/>
and accepted that I couldn&#39;t actually make him do anything, I stopped <br/>
expecting him to do things. I still asked, though, and after a while <br/>
he would do a lot of the things I asked and even many things I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo says no to me a lot when I ask him to do something. I don&#39;t try <br/>
to force him. I try my best to do it myself, happily. I&#39;m still <br/>
working on the happily part.<br/>
