Most of the talk here is about the Live and Learn Conference because I <br/>
started it *and* I am list-owner. So I have my reasons to promote the <br/>
L&L here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the Rethinking Education Conference is in TX with host, Barb <br/>
Lundgren. I know Barb has an awesome weekend planned. She and I have <br/>
the similar goal of bringing unschoolers together to share a few days <br/>
each year. The more unschooling conferences we could swing, the better!<br/>
<br/>
Barb and I usually chat at about this time each year as we pull our <br/>
hair out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll just probably find more from *this* list going to L&L.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Live and Learn conference is the same cost no matter whether you <br/>
stay at the hotel or not - it&#39;s a separate thing, that way people <br/>
can make their own arrangements for accommodations however they want <br/>
to without there having to be lots of juggling of the &quot;how much is <br/>
the conference?&quot; question. It&#39;s one price for the conference, <br/>
everything else you figure out however you want to.<br/>

My guess is that for the hotel, you&#39;ll have a choice<br/>
of staying in the same hotel at a discounted rate or<br/>
booking separately at nearby hotels.<br/>

    Hi again.  so then how much is the conference. and how much is the <br/>
hotel?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Special conference rate is $89/night---BUT that rate expires on August <br/>
6th! Even if you&#39;re on the fence and *might* come, I&#39;d suggest at least <br/>
getting a room booked. You can always cancel the room at the last <br/>
minute. The regular hotel rates are HIGH (this is a NICE hotel!), and <br/>
there&#39;s nothing I can do about the rate after the 6th!<br/>
<br/>
The conference is $350 for the whole family for Wednesday evening <br/>
through Sunday afternoon. OR $110 per adult and $75 per child. The <br/>
family deal works best if there are four or more family members coming. <br/>
Price jumps up considerably after August 10th, with no family discount. <br/>

Dozens of funshops and speakers and just great things to do and people <br/>
to meet. It&#39;s a BUSY few days, but a lot of fun!<br/>
