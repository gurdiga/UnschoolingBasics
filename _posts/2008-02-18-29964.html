<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968263662">How can i let my dh understand it&#39;s not spoiling when i suggest<br/>
redirecting our son when he wants to run around a store or when i<br/>
suggest other ways to meet his needs when we are out and about but ds<br/>
is bored,whiney, just high energy. and i offer suggestions but my<br/>
husband says that i&#39;m spoiling him because he thinks our son should<br/>
just *behave*<br/>
thanks<br/>
p.s. son is 6yo</div>
