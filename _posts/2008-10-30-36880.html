<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086565599">I have been brainstorming and trying to figure out ways to keep sane<br/>
with my own personal chore dilemma.  Sometime in the middle of the<br/>
night last night, I suddenly remembered that I had already figured<br/>
this out once before!  When we lived in Columbia, my therapist<br/>
suggested I hire help to clean my house.  As someone already<br/>
mentioned, paying someone to clean house for us can seem like quite a<br/>
chunk of money to some of us.  I can easily spend the $40.00 that was<br/>
mentioned on fast food in a week and not blink twice.  It&#39;s just how<br/>
we rationalize it.  It&#39;s food, we have to eat, and I don&#39;t keep a<br/>
clean kitchen,  nor do I cook often.  Nor do I grocery shop often. <br/>
Ha!  I also see the flip side of the coin though, where if I did keep<br/>
a clean kitchen, it&#39;d be much easier to cook meals, pack food for<br/>
outings, etc.  So, since that is the side of the coin I want to be on,<br/>
I need to get help cleaning!  The solution:  Cleaning Playdates.  When<br/>
I lived in Columbia, a friend and I took turns helping the other clean<br/>
up.  I&#39;d bring my kids to her place and they&#39;d hang out while we<br/>
cleaned up.  She&#39;d pick an area she wanted to work on before I got<br/>
there and we&#39;d plow through it till it was done.  Usually, since the<br/>
kids got along so well, we ended up getting much more done than we<br/>
planned for.  Then the next week, she&#39;d bring her kids to my place and<br/>
we&#39;d do the same thing.  When I told my Mother in Law all about this<br/>
bright idea of mine, she said that&#39;s nothing new!  She and a good<br/>
friend used to live across the street from each other and they helped<br/>
each other daily!  They&#39;d get one house cleaned and dinner in the<br/>
crock pot, and then go to the other one and do the same.  Anyway, I&#39;ve<br/>
got a Cleaning Playdate request out on both the local Yahoo lists I&#39;m<br/>
on and just wanted to share in case anyone else could benefit from this.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060936719">With being chronically ill and having a bad week, DH being away on business.<br/>
I asked Faith to help me clean up her food wrappers, plates, glasses and<br/>
cups.  She and I also cleaned up a huge mess of toilet paper the dogs<br/>
chewed.  She asked me this week why I thought she didn&#39;t remember to clean<br/>
up after herself.  I said I wasn&#39;t sure.  We talked a little while about it<br/>
and I asked her if she wanted me to remind her for awhile and she said yes.<br/>
I am pretty sure I didn&#39;t handle this right. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The crazy thing is that she keeps not flushing the toilet and loads it up<br/>
with toilet paper to the point that it won&#39;t go down.  Twice this week I had<br/>
to reach in and grap the paper and pull it out and throw it away to unstuck<br/>
the toilet.  Thank God there were no logs in there if you know what I mean.<br/>
I went into her bathroom last night and she hadn&#39;t flushed it in so long it<br/>
stunk when I opened the door.  I just don&#39;t have a clue what to do about<br/>
this.  We have 3 bathrooms and her favorite ones to use are off the computer<br/>
room and mine.  I don&#39;t think to check her bathroom often as she won&#39;t<br/>
shower in there.  I have no clue why, so she uses the one off the computer<br/>
room.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On the other side of life, today Faith came up with the most beautiful poem.<br/>
It was in the style of Shakespeare, which she is into.  My little math a<br/>
phobic, also came up with a little chart on her own about addition and<br/>
sixes.  I don&#39;t have a clue why she did it, there&#39;s no reason for me to<br/>
know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went through various stages like this. For a while, maybe just keep  <br/>
going around flushing toilets in each bathroom - make it a habit to do  <br/>
it a couple of times per day. It will take you about 10 seconds each,  <br/>
probably.<br/>
<br/>
About kids wanting reminders - I think that&#39;s fair and it didn&#39;t sound  <br/>
to me like you&#39;d handled that badly at all. A little hint that might  <br/>
help you in helping her is to use notes rather than use your own  <br/>
voice. Sometimes your own slight irritation at her for needing to be  <br/>
reminded could come through in your voice, even if you think you&#39;re  <br/>
hiding it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that reminds me - I remember sticking post-it notes on the  <br/>
toilet that had silly little rhyming lines to remind users to flush.  <br/>
And a few months ago I stuck a post-it on the inside of the pantry  <br/>
door that said, &quot;Close me, please.&quot; (The dog had discovered the open  <br/>
door and was dragging things out of the pantry, across the house,  <br/>
through the doggy door, and the chewed up trash was all over the back  <br/>
yard.)<br/>

immediately important to her and doesn&#39;t notice.<br/>
<br/>
My 17 yo daughter sheds clothes wherever she is. Not because she  <br/>
expects me to pick them up but because she&#39;s thinking of something  <br/>
else, probably about whatever she&#39;s changing for, and is oblivious.<br/>
<br/>
We have a bright hallway downstairs and I always forget to turn off  <br/>
the light in the bathroom when I&#39;m done because there&#39;s no visual  <br/>
clue that it&#39;s on to remind me. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to save  <br/>
electricity. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t notice.<br/>
