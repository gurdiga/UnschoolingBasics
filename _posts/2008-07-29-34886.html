<br/>
Anyone is welcome to submit a blogpost for consideration. Blog<br/>
carnivals are a list of posts linking to lots of different bloggers,<br/>
on a specific topic.<br/>
<br/>
This Blog Carnival is for unschoolers and only unschooling blogposts<br/>
will be included. Your blog does not have to be about unschooling<br/>
though, just the post you include for the carnival.<br/>
<br/>
Go check it out! Instructions and topics are up for the month of August.<br/>
