<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597832378">Duncan has decided (again, but I think this time is for real) to cut <br/>
off his long hair. It&#39;s long and *very*  thick---I&#39;m terribly envious! <br/>
With my thin, fine hair, I ADORE his long locks. But he&#39;s about ready <br/>
for a change and wants to donate to Locks of Love.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else done it? Are there better salons to use? I mean---are <br/>
some used to this process and handle the cutting correctly? Do you have <br/>
any advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589060315">I&#39;ve done it a couple of times. Their website has lists of places that <br/>
they work with. Or, you can simply have whoever you usually go to tie <br/>
the hair into a pony tail and cut it then place it in a ziplock bag <br/>
and send it in to them yourself (there&#39;s a form on their website as <br/>
well, so they know the &#39;origins&#39; of the hair and you can donate in <br/>
memory of someone and that sort of stuff). It cannot be hair gathered <br/>
up from the floor or anything - that&#39;s why tying it up first works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011670638">Well, I *thought* I&#39;d seen that list on their website the last time <br/>
Dunc thought he wanted to cut it.  But I didn&#39;t see it this time. I&#39;ll <br/>
go look again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170998066">Hi Kelly, We went to the salon at JCPenney and my daughter cut of 12&quot; <br/>
of hair!  They know about the program but basically, any salon can cut <br/>
of the hair and then you send it in with the form that you download <br/>
from the Locks of Love site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761260170">My 14 yr old did this ...she has lovely curly curly hair... she grew<br/>
it out specifically to donate to Locks of Love.   I took her to<br/>
Fantastic Sam&#39;s (it was listed on the website) and I will have to say<br/>
although I was a bit apprehensive about the caliber of chain hair<br/>
places she got a very nice haircut (totally free) and they handled all<br/>
the paperwork and mailing the hair.  It was a really good experience<br/>
for her! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467052177">I just did locks of love!  What a great feeling,<br/>
knowing that my 14 inches of hair can be used for<br/>
someone else who really needs it.  My 10 yo dd cut it<br/>
after I put it in a pony tail.  It has to be clean and<br/>
in a pony tail or braid....then in a zip lock plastic<br/>
bag and mailed away, using the form from their web<br/>
site.  It was really fun for both of us ( and she did<br/>
a great job cutting it!)<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Beth <br/>
