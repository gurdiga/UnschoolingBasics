<div id="ygrps-yiv-981414134">We don&#39;t have insects but we just started up our second 20 gallon<br/>
aquarium and got 2 snails and 2 african frogs (the kind that live<br/>
underwater and just surface occasionally for a gulp of air). We were<br/>
amazed at how FAST those snails move, compared to the stereotype of<br/>
snails. They&#39;ll surely not win any foot races (especially since they&#39;re<br/>
gastropods and walk with their stomach and not feet as we know them lol)<br/>
but they move quite rapidly when they choose to. And it&#39;s fun watching<br/>
the frogs swimming around rather than the usual hop hop hop. Once these<br/>
guys are settled in, we&#39;ll be picking up a few fish - we were looking at<br/>
the Australian rainbow fish in the fish department and they looked<br/>
really cool so we might get a couple of those. Anybody have any favorite<br/>
tropical community type fish? Oh, and no live breeders - our momma molly<br/>
in the other tank is doing terribly well in delivering live babies...<br/>
<br/>
Definitely WON&#39;T be reading the Green Pants Dr Seuss story - that<br/>
freaked DS out too much...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really want to encourage DH in water fights - LOL when we were<br/>
dating, I was often at his parents&#39; home for dinner (since he still<br/>
lived there) so we&#39;d offer to clean up afterward (hey, no one else<br/>
wanted to do the dishes so we got some private talking time while we<br/>
cleaned the kitchen). Anyhow, we almost invariably ended up, one of us<br/>
with the sink sprayer and one with a plant mister or two and well, let&#39;s<br/>
just say I often had to borrow a dry t-shirt to drive home in :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459576653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Guppies...lots of &#39;em!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL Is there any way to only have a couple guppies? We bought 1, just<br/>
one, dalmatian molly around Jan 2007. We have now had at least 3 broods,<br/>
averaging 5 to 6 mollies per brood. That&#39;s why we have two tanks - two<br/>
weeks after we brought her home, we noticed these little &quot;things&quot;<br/>
swimming around in the tank - baby mollies! To many (what with the other<br/>
fish we had in there) for the tank to be healthy so we got another tank,<br/>
got it going, transferred  momma and several other fish to that tank.<br/>
Tank two eventually died off bit by bit and we cleaned it all out (right<br/>
down to washing the plastic plants and gravel) and waited a bit before<br/>
re-setting it last weekend. Within the last two weeks, the momma has<br/>
had, as best we can tell by their sizes, two broods. Mollies are<br/>
interesting in that not only are they live breeders but the female, once<br/>
fertilized, can decide WHEN to have the babies. If she feels stressed in<br/>
any way (aggressive fish pestering her, overcrowding, too warm/cool, pH<br/>
or ammonia levels not to her liking) she can choose to not have any and<br/>
can wait for up to something like 6 months before popping those little<br/>
ones out, all at once or in small batches. Guess she likes us LOL<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re thinking of the Aussie rainbow fish and maybe some gouramis -<br/>
we&#39;re trying to balance the colors, sizes, and preferred &#39;living spaces&#39;<br/>
(some prefer the bottom third of the tank others the midsection and<br/>
others swim nearer the top) so that they&#39;re not all bumping into each<br/>
other in the bottom half of the tank. We don&#39;t want any live bearers<br/>
anymore and we&#39;re trying to get away from the black & white &#39;theme&#39; of<br/>
the tank full of mollies.<br/>

Apparently not! I keep thinking it would be fun to add a different<br/>
kind of fish in there, but then I remember how crowded they are<br/>
already and decide against it. There IS a plecostamis (sp?) in there<br/>
too. We used to have snails but they all died and I have NO idea why.<br/>

water tank. DS picked some silver barbs for it. He kept saying he <br/>
wanted sharks but picked the barbs instead. He thinks they look more <br/>
like sharks than the sharks do. LOL <br/>
<br/>
We bought a clownfish yesterday to start our saltwater tank again. <br/>
That fish was expensive! Wasn&#39;t expecting that so I didn&#39;t even ask <br/>
about the price. If it survives, we&#39;ll get some damsels, an anemone or <br/>
2, some shrimp, maybe a yellow tang and a seahorse (if the tank is <br/>
safe enough). <br/>
<br/>
I love the sound of the water in the tanks and I love watching the <br/>
fish swim. I remember the first time I realized one of my fish came up <br/>
to greet me when I came close to the tank. That was cool.<br/>

Do you have an aquarium nearby---I mean the BIG kind?<br/>
<br/>
Our aquarium at our zoo gets clownfish ALL the time from folks who <br/>
can&#39;t care for them. They have an overabundance of clownfish. Always.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask whether they will part with a few?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how generous they would be; I know their first concern <br/>
would be the welfare of the fish. But I know the head of the aquarium <br/>
here in Columbia (and she&#39;d be NUTS to give *me* a fish!), but I know <br/>
they have too many. I didn&#39;t ask whether they would part with any, but <br/>
I&#39;d ask! What do you have to lose? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479758851">Well, in addition to the two snails (we named them Banana and Blueberry<br/>
because, well, one&#39;s yellow and one&#39;s blue lol) and two african dwarf<br/>
frogs, we now have an Australian Rainbow fish (which is way prettier at<br/>
home than in the bright store lighting) and two hatchet fish because we<br/>
thought they looked kinda cool and unusual. In a week or so, we&#39;ll go<br/>
back and pick up a couple more fish of some kind - we&#39;re looking for<br/>
bright colors and not too big (given the tank size we want to keep to<br/>
fish that don&#39;t get more than about 4&quot; long so we can have several<br/>
kinds). We decided against tetras (for now) because they need to school<br/>
and we don&#39;t want to just have a group of them. Our last tetras didn&#39;t<br/>
last all that long - we came to the conclusion that schooling fish just<br/>
didn&#39;t feel comfortable in our unschooling household LOL<br/>

REALLY?!! Cool! Haven&#39;t heard ours sing - they&#39;re mostly busy<br/>
rearranging the gravel in the bottom of the tank to suit themselves (so<br/>
are the snails for that matter). How do you hear them when they&#39;re<br/>
underwater?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve decided that Banana, the yellow shelled snail, is a Xtreme games<br/>
types snail. It (I always want to call Banana &quot;she&quot; and Blueberry &quot;he&quot;)<br/>
climbed itself to the top of the tank wall, right to the water line,<br/>
then wiggled loose and floated down to the floor of the tank, landed<br/>
right side up and started crawling away. It&#39;s a very active snail (and<br/>
pretty fast as snails go). It&#39;s really amazing to watch as it climbs up<br/>
the plants then extends the gastropod and transfers to the wall of the<br/>
tank without a slip or hitch. Wow! Blueberry is more &#39;traditional&#39;, slow<br/>
moving, generally less active.<br/>
