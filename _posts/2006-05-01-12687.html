<div id="ygrps-yiv-383922979">This is a snipit I recently posted on my blog, it certainly got me <br/>
thinking- what if these questions were asked of kids who do not go <br/>
to school. what would the numbers show then?<br/>
<br/>
 How do you think Homeschooled/unschooled people change society as a <br/>
whole? Do you think our kids grow up and leave home to become <br/>
victims because the world is primaraly made up of people with the <br/>
beliefs described below? Do our kids go on the premise that they <br/>
will be treated equaly and fair because of their abilitys and not <br/>
discriminated against or harmed because of who they are?<br/>
<br/>
 My son, having been in the PS system got just a small taste <br/>
of &quot;those people&quot; his age and didnt like it. I doubt &quot;those people&quot; <br/>
are going to get any better over time. He might remember what it was <br/>
like when he steps out into the world but he might have forgotten <br/>
and what about kids who never knew? do you feel they are prepared?<br/>
<br/>
(please note, these are just random questions flitting through my <br/>
head brought to light by this peice and I thought I would share them <br/>
and see what others think- Im not trying to state that kids who do <br/>
not go to PS are not prepared or use this as a reason why it isnt a <br/>
good idea)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Rape Cycle<br/>
It starts early. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what middle-school kids think about rape, according to a <br/>
survey of 11-14 year-olds:<br/>
<br/>
51% of boys and 41% of girls believe that a man has a right to force <br/>
a woman to kiss him if he has &quot;spent a lot of money on her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
32% of boys and 32% of girls say it&#39;s not improper for a man to rape <br/>
a woman who has had past sexual experiences.<br/>
<br/>
87% of boys and 79% of girls say rape is okay if a man and woman are <br/>
married.<br/>
<br/>
47% of all those surveyed say it&#39;s okay for a man to rape a woman he <br/>
has been dating for more than 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound too good, does it? By middle school, Many American <br/>
children have already drunk deeply from the patriarchy: they believe <br/>
that men have the right to sexually possess women, that women can be <br/>
bought, and that women who aren&#39;t virgins are fair game for rape.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps it&#39;s not so surprising what happens when they get to <br/>
college:<br/>
1 in 4 college women report being victims of rape or attempted rape.<br/>
1 in 12 college men admit to committing acts that meet the legal <br/>
definition of rape.<br/>
<br/>
35% of college men indicate some likelihood that they would commit <br/>
rape if they could be assured of not getting caught.<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t stop when they get married<br/>
<br/>
10% of women are the victims of rape or attempted rape by a husband <br/>
or intimate partner in their lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
33-46% of husbands who beat their wives also rape them.<br/>
 or have children:<br/>
<br/>
About 20% of all rapes are committed against children under the age <br/>
of 18 by their own family members.<br/>
<br/>
20-40% of women and 10-20% of men report having been sexually <br/>
victimized as children (this includes sexual abuse other than rape).<br/>
And then you go to the top and start all over again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wondered the same thing.  I&#39;ve worked in rape crisis before being a rape<br/>
survivor.  Many girls equate sex as rape.  They don&#39;t realize that they have<br/>
a choice to say no.  I saw this over and over during rape counselling.<br/>
Teens who had been date raped felt that they owed the boy sex or that they<br/>
didn&#39;t have a right to say no because they were on a date afterall and he is<br/>
a boy afterall.  They willingly have sex because they don&#39;t know there is an<br/>
option to say no.  Many women equate rape to something violent and don&#39;t<br/>
associate date rape or familiar rape with &quot;real rape.&quot;  As long as she<br/>
wasn&#39;t hurt she wasn&#39;t really raped.  It&#39;s that two extremes definition.  My<br/>
girls have a pretty good understanding of the definition of rape, but then<br/>
we&#39;ve talked a lot about sex and rape and what is good and what isn&#39;t.<br/>

At 11 I personaly was already having sex as were several of my <br/>
friends.<br/>
at 14 I was on birth controle and had been for a while.<br/>
that was YEARS AND YEARS ago and the world has changed dramaticly <br/>
even since that time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You did misquote the article the correct quote is:<br/>
 41% of girls believe that a man has a right to force a woman to <br/>
KISS him if he has &quot;spent a lot of money on her.&quot;<br/>
(which is assault not rape)<br/>
<br/>
At 11 years old my son has a good understanding of what sex is.<br/>
he knows on an intellectual level what sexual asault and rape are as <br/>
well. He learned about this at home and through the PS system where <br/>
these things were discussed. <br/>
 Lots of these things came about as discussions spurred by events in <br/>
world knews as well as questions he had for me about things that <br/>
were discussed at Public school.<br/>
 One of those things being &quot;what is oral sex?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IMO the children in middleschool are much more sexualized than even <br/>
their own parents may realize. I also believe a good majority of <br/>
them know on an intellectual level what rape is but do not <br/>
understand the emotional side of it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76625778">Having been a rape victim, I thought I deserved it. He<br/>
was my boyfriend. I thought I owed him. I kept my<br/>
mouth shut for so long, because of fear (many forms).<br/>
I think if my parents had given me a sex talk at least<br/>
of some kind it might have helped. I&#39;m a survivor<br/>
because of my own doing. He had power over me for so<br/>
long, YEARS after the raping. (It went on for 3-4<br/>
months, him and two friends.) I was still afraid he&#39;d<br/>
find me and kill me, because I spoke about it. I was<br/>
14 when we started dating, I was 15 when he started<br/>
raping me. I think we need to teach our children about<br/>
sex at an earlier age. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not uncommon in PS for 9 y/o to have sex. <br/>

<br/>
****I definitely agree with you Joyce! They don&#39;t understand what rape is. <br/>
Rape is not about sex, as we all know, it&#39;s about violence, period. Obviously <br/>
these schooled kids are not informed at all. Our dd&#39;s went to school until 3rd <br/>
and 4th grade, this mentality in schools is one of the many reasons we pulled <br/>
them out. I do not worry about our dd&#39;s becoming &quot;victims from not going to <br/>
school.&quot; I think just the opposite, I think our kids will be MORE empowered from <br/>
NOT being with & learning from other kids & adults about such things as rape. <br/>
Kids do not *learn* about rape, or for that matter, about healthy <br/>
relationships at school. Schools seem to be so anti family these days and, as we all know, <br/>
it&#39;s the parents job to show kids by example what good, healthy relationships <br/>
look like and also to *educate* (so to speak&lt;g&gt;) our kids on what dangers <br/>
there are out there. At 11 & 12 our dd&#39;s know what sex is and what rape is.....to <br/>
a degree. The 12 yo knows a bit more. When the subject comes up from a TV <br/>
show, the newspaper, etc., they ask questions and we discuss things with them <br/>
gradually. I don&#39;t think hs&#39;ed kids go off on their own with no knowledge of what <br/>
life is like in this world.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that survey and your thoughts, it got me thinking!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The term &quot;sexual assault&quot; was brought about in order to broaden the<br/>
definition of rape.  Sexual assualt is any assault that is sexual in nature<br/>
- be it intercourse, disrobing, penetration with foreign object and a number<br/>
of other things.  The &quot;official definition&quot; is no longer rape.  This was<br/>
done because many rape victims/survivors were told that they were not<br/>
&quot;raped&quot; because the attacker used a pipe or a bat or didn&#39;t actually<br/>
penetrate her or &quot;only&quot; took her clothes off.  Now someone who &quot;only&quot; takes<br/>
another person&#39;s clothes off (non-consensually) is still charged with<br/>
&quot;sexual assault&quot; and will serve or is supposed to serve) the same sentence<br/>
as someone who had sexual penetration with a person.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And no, being told by a cop that you were &quot;not actually raped&quot; and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;rape doesn&#39;t exist&quot; doesn&#39;t go over well with survivors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No police officer EVER should tell a woman that!  I used to work with a rape<br/>
crisis center and we used to do teaching sessions for police officers to<br/>
help them be the first source of counselling to victims since most victims&#39;<br/>
first contact is with the police.  Never never never are police supposed to<br/>
deminish an assualt by changing the language!!!!  Any police officer that<br/>
says that there is no such thing as rape needs to be reprimanded and written<br/>
up!  GRRRRRRRR!!!!<br/>
