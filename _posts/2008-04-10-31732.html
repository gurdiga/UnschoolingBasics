<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819629593">Hello, my name is Patience.  I have two young children..  Sean who<br/>
will be 5 in July and Sara who just turned 2 in January.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has ADHD.  We tried Focalin, but we didn&#39;t like how he acted,<br/>
we wanted our old Sean back.  We had him in preschool for a few<br/>
months, but pulled him out - for two reasons - it was too pricey for<br/>
us, and he wasn&#39;t doing too well.  He learned when he was paying<br/>
attention, which didn&#39;t happen very often.  Teacher said he would get<br/>
up and walk away during learning time and had a hard time sitting still.<br/>
<br/>
DH wants to homeschool our children.  At first I was against it, but<br/>
then prayed about it, and got this feeling like it was the right thing<br/>
to do.  Granted, he&#39;s still young, but we want to start soon, atleast<br/>
with reading.  I worry about his social skills, but my boy is so<br/>
social, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll have a problem.  I also worry that I won&#39;t<br/>
do a good enough job... but then again, the best teacher my boy could<br/>
ever have is my husband and I.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m just now starting to look into what homeschooling in Indiana<br/>
has to offer.. so far it&#39;s one of the best 5 states to homeschool or<br/>
so I&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
So, I hope to get to know all of you, along with what happens with<br/>
unchooling/homeschooling.. I&#39;m very thrilled about it all!<br/>

At this list, we talk a lot about how being a &quot;teacher&quot; of your child<br/>
is unecessary. He&#39;ll learn to read naturally, without lessons if you<br/>
learn to trust the process. Please read some of the recent messages<br/>
and archives before posting, just to give you a feel for what we<br/>
promote here.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list! I also recommend reading some John Holt books or<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781448068">Hi Patience<br/>
<br/>
Indiana is a great state for home learning.  We live next door in <br/>
Kentucky, which is also a decent do it at home state, but Indiana is <br/>
even better.  In Ky, we have to send a letter to the board of <br/>
education once a year at the beginning of the school year saying that <br/>
we&#39;re homeschooling.  That&#39;s it, really.  In Indiana, as I understand <br/>
it, you don&#39;t even have to do that.  Sweet!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and toss out a couple of links.  <br/>
I&#39;ve long held that there&#39;s no such thing as ADHD, that they are in <br/>
fact manufactured diseases designed to sell drugs to children, and <br/>
that children have a tremendous amount of variation in their ability <br/>
to pay attention to adult stuff.  I only throw this out because if I <br/>
were in the process of tossing out school, I&#39;d also be thinking about <br/>
tossing out the ADHD label and just enjoy the son you have.<br/>
<br/>
As for social skills, I find that my kids, who have never been inside <br/>
a school, are extremely social, even though both my wife and I are <br/>
fairly introverted.  They now drag us to participate more with <br/>
people.  I also find that unschooled/homeschooled children, when in <br/>
social settings like parks, playing together are so much nicer, <br/>
friendlier and accepting than traditionally schooled children.  I <br/>
would suggest that institutional schools de-socialize children and <br/>
that social skills are something that will take care of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It also sounds as if, as someone new to this, you&#39;re still leaning <br/>
more toward homeschooling than unschooling at this point, which makes <br/>
sense.  I gathered that from what you said about starting your son on <br/>
reading.  My wife and I, to give a counter example, didn&#39;t do <br/>
anything in terms of &quot;teaching&quot; our son to read, he pretty much <br/>
taught himself.  At 7, he&#39;s a fine reader.  My daughter, who&#39;s 4, <br/>
loves to draw, and she&#39;s currently teaching herself to write.  She&#39;ll <br/>
sit and write page after page of letters, lovely pictures of letters, <br/>
and we&#39;ve never even suggested that she should learn to write.  <br/>
<br/>
My sense of all of this is that its important to throw out the school <br/>
in your head, the psychologists, the experts of all sorts, everyone <br/>
who draws a paycheck from an institution of any sort, the labels and <br/>
the shoulds and should nots, and just relax and focus on living your <br/>
life with your family, fully and joyously. At least that&#39;s what I try <br/>
to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146942985">Patience, I had an ER nurse (who was treating my DS for a broken arm<br/>
when he was 4, he&#39;s now almost 10) tell me when she found out we planned<br/>
to homeschool him, that she had homeschooled her 3 boys until high<br/>
school and in her opinion a classroom was the exact WRONG place for<br/>
young boys because that&#39;s not how they&#39;re designed. Small boys are<br/>
developing big muscles, big motor control, hand-eye coordination (like<br/>
throwing and jumping and such), balance, stuff that requires lots of<br/>
movin&#39; and shakin&#39; goin&#39; on. Classrooms require slow, quiet, sit, fine<br/>
motor control. Poor fit.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW my DS has never been &#39;schooled&#39; - we&#39;ve never been his &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>
except insofar as all people learn from other people in one way or<br/>
another just by interacting. No lessons, no &#39;teachable moments&#39;, no<br/>
workbooks, no textbooks, no &#39;school time&#39;, etc. Yet &quot;somehow&quot; he can<br/>
read, handle basic number skills, find China (and Hungary, and St.<br/>
Croix, and Antarctica, and...) on a world map or globe, and so on. He<br/>
loves sushi and sashimi and MASH and Star Wars and campfires and<br/>
videogames and lots of stuff and it&#39;s ALL connected. Life is a big web<br/>
of connection, it&#39;s not a whole bunch of separate little<br/>
end-in-themselves boxes. The written word, numbers, finding places/using<br/>
maps, etc are all tools that have meaning in *his* life so he absorbed<br/>
them, uses them, asks about them, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
While unschooling is legally a &quot;form&quot; of homeschooling, the paradigm is<br/>
very different in practice - it&#39;s more about taking &#39;school&#39; out of<br/>
living life in this big wide world. It&#39;s more akin to what parents do<br/>
naturally with a toddler - providing a helping hand, resources, etc but<br/>
you don&#39;t do walking lessons or talking lessons (barring some sort of<br/>
physiological issues). You provide a safe space and a helping hand as<br/>
needed. As many of us can attest, there&#39;s no reason to change what you<br/>
do simply because of a birthdate on a calendar - the resources change,<br/>
interests change, abilities and developmental stages change, but the<br/>
bottom line &quot;philosophy&quot; or attitude is the same. People learn.period.<br/>
When what where how why and from whom need to be internal to the<br/>
learner.<br/>
