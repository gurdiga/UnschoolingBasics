<div id="ygrps-yiv-958179766">Is there<br/>
a rule book for unschooling?  Unschooling is very organic according to<br/>
each family, and would not be unschooling if there were a rule book.  I<br/>
do believe we all have wonderful things to offer to this group.  Some<br/>
may be more aggressively purist in their posts, and some may get their<br/>
feelings hurt.  We probably can all agree that as the parent, we have a<br/>
lot to learn.  There are ways to influence people without being<br/>
negative, or righteous.  There are also ways to hear criticism that<br/>
won&#39;t leave you feeling stupid.  This is not a religion.  This is a way<br/>
of raising our kids to be confident self-learners.<br/>
<br/>
Well put Andrea.  Thank you.  At times with those more &quot;purist&quot; I get the<br/>
feeling it is religion in the fanatical sense and was beginning to question<br/>
whether or not I should refer to myself as an unschooler.  In my heart and<br/>
from all I have read so far it is what I am but I wondered if perhaps I<br/>
missed out on the rule book somewhere along the line.  I have plenty to<br/>
learn but trusting there is a safe place to come and pose a question or two<br/>
or share an experience without being attacked means a lot.  There is a yahoo<br/>
group for radical unschoolers.  Always Learning seems to be for the old<br/>
timers too but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  Basics to me means beginnings.<br/>
Most people crawl before they walk.  It doesn&#39;t mean they have no intention<br/>
of walking or should be judged harshly for crawling.  It simply means they<br/>
may be new to the path.<br/>

IMO -- go next year. Or not.<br/>
