<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361775251">Hi.  I&#39;ve done/am doing this!  We thought we&#39;d do<br/>
Campfire.  The regional director is here in Tucson AND<br/>
she was a homeschooler.  BUT we had to agree to sell<br/>
candy bars and another fundraiser.  We weren&#39;t allowed<br/>
to choose to do something different to get out of the<br/>
candy bar sales, OR to just donate the money<br/>
ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
So I did some searching - I think I actually found out<br/>
about this on a homeschool/unschool list, but I don&#39;t<br/>
remember which one - and we ended up starting a Roots<br/>
& Shoots club.  This is a Jane Goodall organization<br/>
for kids.  Focus is one caring for the earth, caring<br/>
for people, and caring for animals.  They offer<br/>
&quot;lesson plans&quot; for younger kids.  I guess a lot of<br/>
their clubs are in schools.  But the California office<br/>
interviewed me & put a little blurb on their &quot;new,<br/>
improved&quot; website last year.  <br/>
<br/>
It is VERY flexible and NO badges/beads stuff which is<br/>
exactly what I wanted PLUS we are linked to an<br/>
international organization which is pretty cool (for<br/>
me anyway LOL).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to share some of the cool stuff we&#39;ve<br/>
done , if you are interested.  You can check out their<br/>
website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rootsandshoots.org/">http://www.rootsandshoots.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool blurb is under &quot;Communities&quot; and<br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot;.  (Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers Roots &<br/>
Shoots club)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sincerely,<br/>

You can use any of the materials of those organizations in an unschooling  <br/>
friendly manner.  What I had the hardest time with in my Camp Fire club was  <br/>
having to include schooled kids.  I just had to deal with them differently  than <br/>
I did unschooled kids.  I couldn&#39;t reach them unless I spoke in  language they <br/>
understood (school speak).  <br/>
 <br/>
Camp Fire doesn&#39;t require that you do anything the way it is written,  unless <br/>
you&#39;re going to compete in national things.  We were very free form  in our <br/>
club.  And I never considered the beads and emblems as &quot;earned&quot;,  really.  I <br/>
stressed that they were momentos of an experience they had,  something to remind <br/>
them of a good time.<br/>
 <br/>
If you could get a whole club full of unschoolers, I can imagine that would  <br/>
be one awesome club.  <br/>
