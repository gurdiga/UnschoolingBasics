<div id="ygrps-yiv-569866308">Hi everyone.  I have 2 sons 12 and 4.  We have been unschooling for <br/>
almost a year now and just today my mother asked my if ds12 was doing <br/>
any &quot;work&quot;.  I had hinted to her last year that if I had the courage <br/>
we would drop all the &quot;school work&quot; completely but that seemed to be <br/>
too much for her to digest.  When she asked me that question today I <br/>
vaguely answered &quot;Oh yeah, all the time&quot;.  &quot;Well,&quot; she replies, &quot;i <br/>
hadn&#39;t heard you talk about it lately.&quot;  I would like to give her a <br/>
nutshell explaination of unschooling, something I can print or send <br/>
her in email.  If I try to discuss it with her I think we will get <br/>
off on too many tangents.  I want her to have to read through a basic <br/>
description without having me there to grill.  Can someone point me <br/>
in the right direction?  I feel like trying to explain unschooling to <br/>
someone for the first time is like trying to explain ice to someone <br/>
who saw water.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911921956">Wow, I wish I could help with this one, but the above conversation <br/>
now has my own head spinning.  Just when I THOUGHT I knew what I was <br/>
doing.<br/>
  <br/>
 When anyone ask about my kids and their &quot;schooling&quot; (ha) I simply <br/>
reply that they are learning new things every day.  And I leave it at <br/>
that.  So far no one has taken it any farther, but I do understand <br/>
how moms can be ;)<br/>

better to give her what she expects to hear by talking about the things the<br/>
kids are doing. Overwhelm her with what&#39;s going on: places you&#39;ve been,<br/>
things kids have talked about, things they&#39;ve figured out on their own that<br/>
surprise you. Keep a notebook open on the kitchen counter and jot things<br/>
down.<br/>

I use references that they know.  We talk to family and friends about projects the kids are involved in....gymnastics, 4-H, helping in the garden.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824443508">This is where an online BLOG comes in handy!! You can write about your <br/>
days, take pics, etc and send the link to all those doubting relatives! <br/>
That&#39;s what I did ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninfreedom.blogspot.com/">http://learninfreedom.blogspot.com/</a> ) and its <br/>
working! One of my &quot;teacher&quot; relatives even commented on what a cool <br/>
thing we were doing (with the unschooling) and how school is not the <br/>
greatest place to be these days...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

And both are fine! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The proof is in the pudding. It may take YEARS for them to get it, but if  <br/>
you keep plugging along, true to what you believe----the kids will be  <br/>
fine----well, MORE Than fine! Your kids will be GREAT, and *they* will be all  the <br/>
proof you need to skeptics. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also use educational jargon that was used in schools in the late <br/>
80&#39;s, early 90&#39;s - &quot;integrated curriculum&quot; meant that subjects were not <br/>
separated - they didn&#39;t have separated reading, writing, social <br/>
studies, science, etc. They didn&#39;t have tests or grades, they used <br/>
&quot;authentic assessment&quot; which literally meant that the teacher watched <br/>
them working on stuff, talked to them, and observed things they <br/>
created.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll say - it is sort of like an &quot;integrated curriculum&quot; with <br/>
&quot;authentic assessment.&quot; That usually convinces them that I have some <br/>
clue what I&#39;m doing and it sounds like &quot;something,&quot; at least. So after <br/>
that I just talk about whatever the kids are doing - places we&#39;ve gone, <br/>
whatever. I go on about those enough that people have heard enough of <br/>
it and don&#39;t ask what they&#39;re doing with the rest of their time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I absolutely KNOW what you mean, Jessie. I also keep earplugs around - <br/>
packages of them. I use them - at first I didn&#39;t like the feeling, but <br/>
I got used to it. I use them at unusual times, I guess - like in the <br/>
bathtub &lt;G&gt;. My kids are REALLY noisy - they all sing ALL the time. And <br/>
my husband has the tv on a lot of the time and always wants music on if <br/>
the tv isn&#39;t on. I just crave QUIET!!!<br/>
