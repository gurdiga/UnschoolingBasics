How do you handle situations with people who just don&#39;t <br/>
get what you are saying?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
We stay away from/avoid people who treat us or our kids poorly.  I&#39;ve found <br/>
that its not usually about people &quot;not getting it&quot;, its about them not wanting <br/>
to get it.  <br/>
<br/>
Its hard to deal with one&#39;s family.  I would address their cruelty and gently <br/>
let your in-laws know that what they did is not acceptable.  Ever.  Name <br/>
calling (lazy?) is way out of line. Maybe you could have helped Grandma with the <br/>
chair and set your daughter free before the attack began?  If you want to <br/>
continue to have a relationship with these people who mistreated your child (and <br/>
you), it might be a good idea to go over some options on how they can <br/>
appropriately handle their anger.  &quot;Beat some respect into&quot; your children?  That&#39;s <br/>
beautifully worded.  Sometimes it helps just to repeat the exact same words back to <br/>
them.  &quot;If you don&#39;t stop belittling and screaming at my child, I&#39;m going to <br/>
beat some respect into you!&quot;  One really effective thing I&#39;ve used (got it <br/>
from this list) is that if you wouldn&#39;t treat your spouse or another adult in a <br/>
certain way, it is not acceptable to do it to a child.  Saying those words <br/>
usually gets them (cruel adults, that is) thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
If my in laws ever tried to punish my kids for not obeying orders by not <br/>
allowing them a turn on a tractor, I&#39;d let *everyone* know how wrong that is and <br/>
would request &quot;my turn&quot; and take everyone for a ride.  If dear grandpy had a <br/>
problem with that, he&#39;d have to admit that he wanted to punish me.  Then, look <br/>
out!   We&#39;d be out of there, after we toured the town on the tractor, that is. <br/>
<br/>
These are cruel people.  Family or not.  I&#39;m sorry for your poor husband.  He <br/>
had to grow up with that and probably learned to suck it up and obey.  How <br/>
miserable.  Your daughter is blessed to have you.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin in MA, who learned the hard way that we must always defend our precious <br/>
children from mean, miserable people.  Regardless of who they are.  <br/>
