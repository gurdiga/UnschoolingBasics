<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035869631">Hi Karen --<br/>
<br/>
Nance Confer here in FL -- unschooling our little tushies off.<br/>
<br/>
You have been misinformed about the laws that govern hsing in FL.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that we need a PAC or anyone else working to change FL&#39;s hsing laws. None of the concerns you list below are true. <br/>
<br/>
There are two basic ways to comply with the compulsory attendance law as a hser in FL (4 if you want to count it that way) and I will be happy to email with you about it. Or we can bore the list with the details if anyone cares.<br/>

While this is interesting to learn...I think I wasn&#39;t clear with my<br/>
question so let me try again.<br/>
<br/>
Is there some group of folks, I guess an organized group, who are<br/>
either watching laws and law makers or are actively working to reverse<br/>
laws we have on the books now, to make unschooling easier or at least<br/>
keep the politicians from taking away what little right we have to<br/>
educate our children as we see fit?<br/>
<br/>
Because here in Florida when you &quot;homeschool&quot; you have to keep a<br/>
record, submit to random testing and entrance into your home or<br/>
deliver your child to a school for &quot;assessment&quot; if the State decides<br/>
to. Some states are easier than that and others are way harder. So I<br/>
was just wondering if there was a push on to reverse the antiquated<br/>
idea of school as we know it or a group actively promoting unschooling<br/>
as a legitimate and legal way of &quot;educating&quot; a child?<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is true. But they tend to ignore the umbrella school option because<br/>
technically your child would be considered a &quot;private schooled&quot; child<br/>
and HSLDA benefits when they can track statistics on &quot;homeschooled&quot;<br/>
children. So they don&#39;t talk about umbrella school options much, in<br/>
fact FPEA in Florida will actively DISCOURAGE people from using the<br/>
umbrella school option. <br/>
<br/>
I remember talking about looking into it because it was less invasive<br/>
and people said things like &quot;Oh, it doesn&#39;t look as good when they<br/>
need to get into college&quot; and other such crap which it TOTALLY untrue.<br/>
It&#39;s fear. In the case of HSLDA it&#39;s about profit and legislation. If<br/>
they can show legislators that homeschoolers are statistically better<br/>
off (higher grades etc..) they have more power.<br/>
<br/>
Florida is easy.<br/>
We DID register there for several years and did the yearly evaluation.<br/>
I found an unschool friendly evaluator and it was actually a lot of<br/>
fun for my kids. We mostly just showed her a photo album and took<br/>
along a few projects they had done. No big deal. If you choose the<br/>
portfolio evaluation just remember that YOU get to choose the teacher<br/>
you use. The state has no say in that. You can even choose a certified<br/>
teacher that isn&#39;t working in the school system currently. As long as<br/>
they have their FL certification you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend this group for staying informed of legal issues in<br/>
Florida, finding great resources and local inclusive groups: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeofflorida.blogspot.com/">http://lifeofflorida.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Our unschool group was part of their network when I formed it and I<br/>
found it to be very inclusive and helpful. They stay active<br/>
politically and watch for legislation issues without any agenda. They<br/>
make no money for doing any of this, so I trust their motives more<br/>
than any HSLDA type group (think FPEA here).<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that I had social services called on my in Florida<br/>
because my children were playing outside during school hours. The<br/>
issue was cleared up immediately when I showed them we homeschooled<br/>
under an umbrella school. It was scary for a second, but if you&#39;re<br/>
legal in FL there is absolutely no reason to worry. <br/>
<br/>
If you decide to go with the umbrella school option, you will need to<br/>
inform your local school district that you are registered with, that<br/>
you are terminating your homeschool program. You can simply write them<br/>
a letter stating that you are removing (fill in children&#39;s names) from<br/>
their district&#39;s homeschooling program and that&#39;s it. If they want to<br/>
know anything more, you can simply say &quot;we&#39;re putting them in a<br/>
private school&quot; to avoid confrontation. They have no right to ask that<br/>
legally, but it&#39;s an easy way to avoid a bunch of nosy school personnel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43835241">HSLDA has never had the correct info on their website about the<br/>
private school option in FL.<br/>
<br/>
I have asked them to correct it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the option listed below, this is the option where you send a<br/>
letter of intent to the county school superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
A simple letter stating that the Home Education Program for X student<br/>
has been established. With identifying info.<br/>
<br/>
Your eval is due one year from the date of that letter.<br/>
<br/>
The eval may be a test. Or you may choose to have a teacher who does<br/>
evals and who gets unschooling review your portfolio and other items.<br/>
You hire the evaluator after interviewing them to find out if they fit<br/>
the way your hs. Not the other way around. Fees for evals run $30-35<br/>
and up.<br/>
<br/>
You get a letter from the evaluator stating that your child has made<br/>
progress appropriate for him and you mail that form in.<br/>
<br/>
You keep copies of everything of course!<br/>
<br/>
These are the broad strokes but the point is that either option --<br/>
HEP/letter of intent or private/umbrella school -- involves some<br/>
amount of paperwork but is not any more intrusive into how you hs than<br/>
you make it. The HSLDA looks more intimidating than it needs to for<br/>
this option. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714621759">Not that it makes much difference, but I believe FPEA has gotten<br/>
better about this. They corrected/added info on their website about<br/>
the private school option, I think it was, a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
But the HEP (register with the county) option is the one you hear<br/>
about most. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, the guess I&#39;ve heard is that about half the hsers here do it one<br/>
way and half the other. <br/>
