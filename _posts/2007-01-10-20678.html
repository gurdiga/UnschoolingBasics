the paste has very low fluoride level the rinse is much higher so <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077962080">My three kids haven&#39;t had a cavity for over a year now (knock wood), but prior to that at least one of them had a cavity every check up, usually more than one kid had a cavity or one kid had more than one cavity.  My husband takes minimal care of his teeth, brushing once a day at most, and only flossing if something is actually stuck.  He never went to the dentist for at least 10 years before we met.  He went after we met(because his teeth are always coffee stained) and of course, no cavities, and he hasn&#39;t had any in the last 15 years either.  I  on the other hand brush at least twice per day, floss almost every day, and for my entire life I have pretty much had a cavity at every dental check up I ever had.  My mother lost all her teeth by 50, and her mother lost all hers by 40.  I don&#39;t know about my grandmother, but my mother took care of her teeth and had regular dental visits.  I know other people who lost their teeth, but they always had other issues, like never saw a dentist ever, even when they knew they had problems, or others who rotted their teeth through drug use.<br/>
 <br/>
That said, it makes me torn on what path to follow for our kids.  I always felt like I inherited bad enamel, bad bacteria, or something like that and my husband didn&#39;t.  I would prefer to avoid fluoride, especially the overdose application at the dentists, but also want my children to have better teeth than I have.  <br/>
 <br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131471320">I, too, am worried about flouride. My doctor told me to take care of my kids teeth (brush/floss), cut down on sweets, and make sure that my kids get plenty of calcium or strontium. He said that you&#39;d be amazed at how little kids get compared to what their bodies need.<br/>
   <br/>
  You might be wondering what strontium is, and why I list it with calcium. It&#39;s a element that has been shown to actually work better than calcium in bodies (the study was on women with osteoperosis). In the study, it increased bone density, etc, better in the women who took it over calcium.<br/>
