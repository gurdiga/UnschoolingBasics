<div id="ygrps-yiv-897027242">My ds15 is a great kid.  He talks to me about most everything.  Lately, <br/>
he has had this fascination with smoking a pipe.  We love Lord of the <br/>
Rings and Harry Potter and he thinks it&#39;s wizardly and wise to puff on <br/>
a pipe when you are contemplating something or working on something. He <br/>
loves the idea of it.  He tried to buy one at a ren faire, but they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t sell it to him because he is not 18.  A part of me thinks it&#39;s <br/>
very dangerous to start this so early (I started smoking cigarettes <br/>
when I was his age and didn&#39;t quit for 10 years) and my mother had <br/>
mouth cancer.  When I share my fear with him, he says it is not his <br/>
intention to get sick from puffing on a pipe so he won&#39;t.  <br/>
I just can&#39;t see my boy smoking a pipe at this age (my think, I know).  <br/>
He wanted to try beer and wine for the same reason and it only took one <br/>
sip of each for him to realize he didn&#39;t like it and didn&#39;t want to <br/>
drink either.  I would like to think the pipe thing would be the same <br/>
way, but it may not be.  <br/>
Any thoughts or ideas are most appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

That&#39;s something to ask him, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Have you ever smoked tobacco from a pipe, or just cigarettes? The <br/>
mechanics are a bit different. I would think it would be valuble for <br/>
him to talk with someone who smokes a tobacco pipe and get some <br/>
information about *how* to do what he wants to do - it sounds like <br/>
he&#39;s more interested in drawing the smoke into his mouth and blowing <br/>
it out again and there&#39;s sort of a trick to that. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, you&#39;ll also want to check local laws wrt the legality of <br/>
him smoking tobacco - not something I&#39;ve looked into, since my <br/>
stepson isn&#39;t interested in tobacco at all. <br/>
<br/>
Something else to look into is smoking different kinds of herbs - <br/>
I&#39;m thinking of mullein in particular. Its an old time herbal remedy <br/>
for chest congestion. If he&#39;s only wanting to smoke occasionally for <br/>
effect, and wants to avoid the nicotine issue entirely, mullein or <br/>
something similar might fit the bill. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for reminding me that just having the pipe could be the <br/>
answer.  He hates the smell of tobacco burning and gets asthmatic <br/>
when he is around it.  So probably we could compromise on this <br/>
issue.  I will talk to him.<br/>

If he really feels he has to try smoking something, I will look into <br/>
herbs.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the ideas.  I know for him it&#39;s not that he wants <br/>
to smoke, he just likes the image of the wise man with a pipe.  He <br/>
considers himself a philosopher and a wizard and the pipe is like a <br/>
prop.  I think just having it may do the trick.<br/>
