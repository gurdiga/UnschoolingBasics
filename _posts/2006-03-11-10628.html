<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169217995">&quot;Head lice cannot jump like fleas. They have no wings and cannot fly.<br/>
Physical contact between people is a common way they spread.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and they used to infect most of the population. There was a day<br/>
when lice were commonplace and not viewed as a big problem.:)<br/>
They carry no disease, are not dangerous on any level nor do they<br/>
cause any health concerns. They&#39;re just a damn nuisance.<br/>

Bleah...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, lice cannot live off the human head<br/>
for very long. I think they start to die after an hour or two.<br/>
