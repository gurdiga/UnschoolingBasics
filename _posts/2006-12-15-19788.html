<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039377828">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Long time lurker, first time poster.  My wife and I are expecting our first any time now (official due date Jan 1st), and we decided that for now we&#39;d start with the Arm&#39;s Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet because it had been recommended by unschoolers as a good solution to co-sleeping but without having the baby in the bed.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons we leaned towards the co-sleeper instead of having the child in the bed with us is that we read some articles with warnings about co-sleeping with infants and not having comforters or any soft/plush bedding, as well as general sleep disturbances for people in the bed (I have had some challenges sleeping already, so we did not want to exasperate that issue any more than is already going to be necessary).<br/>
<br/>
That said, for those of you who have used the Arm&#39;s Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet (or probably any bassinet for that matter) -- we noticed two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) It came with a single fitted sheet, and says to only use approved fitted sheets or those that are equally/correctly sized.  Does this mean that we shouldn&#39;t have any other sheets/blankets, so our child just sleeps in whatever clothes it has on?  Or are there specific non-fitted sheets we should purchase/make?<br/>
<br/>
2) It says to only use the Co-Sleeper up until 3 months of age (or when the baby can sit/crawl/kneel).  What did you do after 3 months of age?<br/>
<br/>
Currently we don&#39;t have a nursery planned because we are planning to do attachment parenting, so we didn&#39;t purchase a crib either (even just to keep next to our bed).<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts/suggestions/advice along these lines would be greatly appreciated.  We are also planning an unassisted home birth, unschooling, and elimination communication.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest wishes,<br/>
Chris</div>

A<br/>
Another unschooling dad here -- maybe we should start a list.<br/>
<br/>
We used the Arm&#39;s Reach for about the first month, but quickly moved to<br/>
having her sleep in our bed after too many numb arms from reaching across<br/>
the small divider. The warnings about co-sleeping are enormously inflated<br/>
and based on people leaving babies alone in adult beds or sleeping with them<br/>
while under the influence. To answer your questions more specifically:<br/>
<br/>
1. Fitted sheets: We simply used newborn-sized blankets and tucked them<br/>
around the sheet so there was no slack. It is important that there aren&#39;t<br/>
loose  sheets, but a tiny bit of give is inevitable. Just make sure the baby<br/>
is on his or her back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
2. We found that by three months, our fears about the bed were soothed to<br/>
the point where we did as most of the world does and simply brought her in<br/>
with us, making sure there were no pillows or blankets around her face.<br/>
She&#39;s 1.5 now and happily acrobating around the family bed.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, it attaches so nicely that if your baby is a sort who doesn&#39;t<br/>
require physical contact to feel comfortable at night -- and it seems there<br/>
are many babies who prefer it that way -- it should work for you. Ours likes<br/>
to cuddle so we outgrew it quickly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595461291">The Needs and Rights of Children:<br/>
Steps to Take<br/>
by John Holt<br/>
<br/>
Paul Goodman, in his many talks with young people, used to say that one <br/>
good way to work for a truly different and better world was to act in <br/>
their daily lives, as far they could, as if that world existed. What <br/>
would you do, he would ask them, if the world had become more or less <br/>
the kind of place you want it to be; how would you live, how would you <br/>
treat other people? Live that way now, treat them that way now. If <br/>
something prevents you, try to find a way to deal with that. We can <br/>
begin to treat children, even the youngest and smallest, wherever we <br/>
may find them, as we would want everyone to treat them in the society <br/>
we are trying to make.<br/>
We can begin by trying to be courteous to them. This will be very <br/>
difficult for those who have been taught by experience only to be <br/>
servile to the strong and rude and bossy toward the weak or those who <br/>
have learned to think of children as love objects and to treat them as <br/>
they would a favorite dog or cat. For to be courteous we must first of <br/>
all respect the other person’s dignity and sense of self. We must treat <br/>
him with a certain formality and reserve until we find out how he would <br/>
like to be treated. We must respect not just his physical but his <br/>
emotional life space until he shows us how far into that space he is <br/>
ready to welcome us. And though being courteous means much more than <br/>
merely being polite, it means at least that. So we must try to learn to <br/>
say &quot;Please&quot; or &quot;Excuse Me&quot; or &quot;Thank You&quot; to children, and in the same <br/>
tone of voice we would use to anyone else. We must not treat a child <br/>
like a servant and demand from him favors or services that we would not <br/>
think of asking of someone our own age. Indeed, because he is new in <br/>
this world, and gets his sense of it from how we be- have toward him, <br/>
we would do well to show him extra courtesy like the wise parents who <br/>
said to me once that most of the time they tried to behave toward their <br/>
then four-year-old son as if he were a very distinguished visitor from <br/>
a strange and alien civilization, knowing little but eager to learn <br/>
about how we do things here.<br/>
<br/>
Another small way to be courteous is by respecting and protecting the <br/>
child’s right to privacy. Until the law gives to him as it does to us <br/>
(at least on paper) the right to be free from arbitrary search and <br/>
seizure, we should act as if he had that right. This means, among other <br/>
things, not going into a child’s room without asking, and receiving, <br/>
permission. Many children’s rooms have signs saying, &quot;Keep Out!,&quot; <br/>
&quot;Danger,&quot; &quot;Absolutely Private,&quot; and the like. This fierceness may amuse <br/>
us but it may well be a child’s desperate clutch at a privacy and <br/>
dignity he has never had and does not expect to get. Many children who <br/>
put up such signs know that they won’t be respected, that &quot;their&quot; room <br/>
is as open to other people as any room in their house.<br/>
<br/>
And privacy means privacy of thought as well as space. Too many people <br/>
think they have a right and duty to know almost everything their child <br/>
is doing or even thinking. They ask, &quot;What did you do in school today?&quot; <br/>
to which the child very often replies, &quot;Nothing.&quot; He only means, <br/>
&quot;Nothing that I want to talk about.&quot; Or perhaps, &quot;Nothing that I want <br/>
(or dare) talk to you about – at least right now.&quot; People who really <br/>
like hearing what their children have been doing don’t usually have to <br/>
ask them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907822598">Hi,<br/>
we bought the arms reach co-sleeper also mainly<br/>
because our then 3 year old also mostly slept in our<br/>
bed, but our little one woke up so frequently that<br/>
mostly he slept in mine or my husbands arms or<br/>
shoulders. He used the co-sleeper maybe once for a<br/>
nap. He still (at 2.5 years old either sleeps in the<br/>
big bed or recently with his brother (and me) in<br/>
another bed as we were running out of space, our kids<br/>
like to sleep sideways -)<br/>
He was also born at home but with a midwife. We love<br/>
our midwife, otherwise I had thought about a<br/>
nonassisted childbirth as well - I am glad I did not<br/>
because a complication arouse as my cervix not fullly<br/>
opening. I just went on and on stuck at 9.5 without<br/>
the water breaking, I eventually had to push him out<br/>
with her pulling the cervix over his head. Also he had<br/>
his arm in the way, so I was very glad she was there.<br/>
Why are you trying to go unassisted? I certainly don&#39;t<br/>
want to critizise, I just know of a few people who<br/>
tried... of course if that is what you choose I wish<br/>
you all the best.<br/>
We also did elimination communication, and it has been<br/>
working wonderfully. Our little one was out of diapers<br/>
at 1, then back in them at 13 months, now out<br/>
completely at 2.3 years, day and night.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for the insight (as well as the Dad&#39;s lists which I<br/>
just subscribed to)!<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question about unassisted - my wife feels that it<br/>
resonates the best with her, and she is confident and sending out the<br/>
positive intentions to have a wonderful birth.  <br/>
<br/>
She is very intuitive and this feels right to her; however, she also<br/>
is accepting that if her intuition tells her something isn&#39;t quite<br/>
right, she is willing to go to the hospital if necessary.<br/>

comfortable planning to birth at home. I was incredulous to learn that<br/>
birthing at home was actually safer than hospital births for all but<br/>
the highest risk pregnancies with co-morbid issues. As a critical care<br/>
nurse, it took a lot of research to convince myself of the studies.<br/>
So, I came to homebirthing backwards from intuition. I trusted the<br/>
medical research! <br/>

It is focused more on young children, rather than unschooling however.<br/>
Of course, there are unassisted birth support lists too, as UC is<br/>
becoming more and more preferred.<br/>
<br/>
We co-slept from birth. Ds slept within the embrace of my arm. We had<br/>
a toddler bedrail on the bed due to my paranoia, even before he could<br/>
turn over. LOL But the bed covers were never an issue. The mama will<br/>
be very in tune with the baby&#39;s sleep cycles. We actually awaken in<br/>
our own sleep cycle at about 90 minutes; and babies often wake at<br/>
around 100 minutes as infants. So, mamas who co-sleep come into a<br/>
lighter sleep cycle just before babies awaken. We never had any issues<br/>
with rolling over, or off the bed, or anything like that either. I&#39;d<br/>
just rouse around when our son would move or make any sounds. New<br/>
mamas have heightened hearing at night, I have read. However, dh was<br/>
less aware in his sleep, so I generally slept in the middle of the<br/>
bed. You can push the bed against the wall, if you are concerned. Or,<br/>
place the mattress and box springs on the floor, as some families do.<br/>
We now have a king and twin pushed together. Although, ds sleeps in<br/>
his room most nights.<br/>
<br/>
It is pleasant to have all the big bed back to move around, as ds<br/>
liked to snuggle in my half of the king. LOL So, you might consider<br/>
spending the money on a twin (instead of a co-sleeper), and place the<br/>
baby in it next to your all&#39;s bed. Of course, pushed together so that<br/>
there is no gap. That makes the transition to sleeping separately<br/>
easier since there is plenty of room. Oh, I just re-read your note, it<br/>
appears that you have purchased the co-sleeper already. Hmmm...another<br/>
option some folks will create a nest on the floor next to the bed for<br/>
the baby. We placed the unused crib mattress on the floor for a while<br/>
before we had purchased the twin. That was probably around the time of<br/>
crawling. But, it was much easier for me to nurse at the same level<br/>
instead of having to get baby or me in and out of bed. The easiest is<br/>
to co-sleep, imo. And everyone gets more sleep that way, if you have<br/>
enough space.<br/>
<br/>
To address your question about clothes, it really depends upon the<br/>
baby. Our son slept better when warm at night as a baby, or swaddled<br/>
(highly recommended). But as he got closer to 18 months, he<br/>
consistently indicated that he didn&#39;t like covers or clothes at night.<br/>
At 5, he is very hot blooded and still likes shorts when I have a<br/>
sweater and long pants. So, *it depends*. But, yes, the general<br/>
recommendation is no covers for infants, as far as I know. As soon as<br/>
they can turn their head, they can bat a sheet off of them. Ds was<br/>
born in June, so we just used a sheet on the bed and no heavy covers.<br/>
You might just turn up the heat and do similarly.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Pat</div>

To answer your question about unassisted - my wife feels that it<br/>
resonates the best with her, and she is confident and sending out the<br/>
positive intentions to have a wonderful birth. <br/>
<br/>
She is very intuitive and this feels right to her; however, she also<br/>

&gt; He was also born at home but with a midwife. We love<br/>
&gt; our midwife, otherwise I had thought about a<br/>
&gt; nonassisted childbirth as well - I am glad I did not<br/>

&gt; opening. I just went on and on stuck at 9.5 without<br/>
&gt; the water breaking, I eventually had to push him out<br/>
&gt; with her pulling the cervix over his head. Also he had<br/>
&gt; his arm in the way, so I was very glad she was there.<br/>
&gt; Why are you trying to go unassisted? I certainly don&#39;t<br/>

&gt; We also did elimination communication, and it has been<br/>
&gt; working wonderfully. Our little one was out of diapers<br/>

&gt; &gt; A<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another unschooling dad here -- maybe we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; start a list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We used the Arm&#39;s Reach for about the first month,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but quickly moved to<br/>
&gt; &gt; having her sleep in our bed after too many numb arms<br/>
&gt; &gt; from reaching across<br/>
&gt; &gt; the small divider. The warnings about co-sleeping<br/>
&gt; &gt; are enormously inflated<br/>
&gt; &gt; and based on people leaving babies alone in adult<br/>
&gt; &gt; beds or sleeping with them<br/>
&gt; &gt; while under the influence. To answer your questions<br/>
&gt; &gt; more specifically:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. Fitted sheets: We simply used newborn-sized<br/>
&gt; &gt; blankets and tucked them<br/>
&gt; &gt; around the sheet so there was no slack. It is<br/>
&gt; &gt; important that there aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; loose sheets, but a tiny bit of give is inevitable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just make sure the baby<br/>
&gt; &gt; is on his or her back to sleep.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. We found that by three months, our fears about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bed were soothed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the point where we did as most of the world does and<br/>
&gt; &gt; simply brought her in<br/>
&gt; &gt; with us, making sure there were no pillows or<br/>
&gt; &gt; blankets around her face.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She&#39;s 1.5 now and happily acrobating around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family bed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All that said, it attaches so nicely that if your<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby is a sort who doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; require physical contact to feel comfortable at<br/>
&gt; &gt; night -- and it seems there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are many babies who prefer it that way -- it should<br/>
&gt; &gt; work for you. Ours likes<br/>
&gt; &gt; to cuddle so we outgrew it quickly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Vicki, I obviously do not doubt your situation, as I have no knowledge<br/>
of it. However, &quot;would have lost the baby&quot; is basically a cultural<br/>
(American) myth about emergency C-sections. Many unnecessary<br/>
C-sections occur and the incidence (epidemic proportions) is<br/>
unbelievable. Please see many, many, many documents disclosing these<br/>
issues on Mothering.com. The number of &quot;emergency&quot; c-sections compared<br/>
to similar socio-economic and matched risk groups varies by<br/>
practioner, state and country. Midwives, save women and babies from<br/>
c-sections according to these same research criteria. <br/>
<br/>
We are wayyyyyyy off topic. But, in unschooling we question all of our<br/>
assumptions. There are many false assumptions surrounding birthing and<br/>
medical interventions.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602872698">Hi Chris,<br/>
I truly do believe intuition is your best insurance,<br/>
so I wish you a wonderful, magical birth!<br/>
A wonderful email list and resource for the EC is the<br/>
diaperfreebaby.org website and list. I EC&#39;d my<br/>
youngest from birth and caught his first poop in the<br/>
sink. To sleep I layed him down on a bunch of those<br/>
flat cloth diapers covered with a thin receiving<br/>
blanket and just pulled them out under him replacing<br/>
them with some fresh ones when wet. I also put those<br/>
diapers on me when he nursed and peed at the same<br/>
time. Curiously he did have a time when he turned 13<br/>
months when he would not let me take him to the<br/>
bathroom anymore, even though he was out of diapers at<br/>
night completely at that time, but I let him be and<br/>
put diapers on him for several months until he told me<br/>
he was done with them, almost from one day to the next<br/>
around 2.  We still have some accidents occasionally<br/>
but they are getting rare indeed. Anyways, intuition<br/>
works wonders with this and unschooling, so enjoy the<br/>
journey!<br/>

&gt;  One of the reasons we leaned towards the co-sleeper instead of having the child in the bed with us is that we read some articles with warnings about co-sleeping with infants and not having comforters or any soft/plush bedding, as well as general sleep disturbances for people in the bed (I have had some challenges sleeping already, so we did not want to exasperate that issue any more than is already going to be necessary).<br/>
<br/>
Chris, I&#39;d like to suggest that you wrap your head around the idea<br/>
that your children will make sleep challenging pretty much forever...<br/>
=) I personally woke up every hour or so just to listen to my first<br/>
baby breathe. =) We did use the co-sleeper, until my DS#1 was about<br/>
two months old, and I figured out that 1) the co-sleeping research you<br/>
refer to above is 99% sponsored by crib manufacturers, and 2) my son<br/>
slept better in physical contact with one of us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  1) It came with a single fitted sheet, and says to only use approved fitted sheets or those that are equally/correctly sized.  Does this mean that we shouldn&#39;t have any other sheets/blankets, so our child just sleeps in whatever clothes it has on?  Or are there specific non-fitted sheets we should purchase/make?<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that most of these instructions are liability-based, not<br/>
sanity or real-world based, so please apply common sense more than<br/>
following directions. Use whatever sheets work, dress your baby in<br/>
whatever the baby&#39;s most comfortable in!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  2) It says to only use the Co-Sleeper up until 3 months of age (or when the baby can sit/crawl/kneel).  What did you do after 3 months of age?<br/>
<br/>
Use it as a place to store the potty (we also did EC from birth),<br/>
tissues, water bottle, etc.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Currently we don&#39;t have a nursery planned because we are planning to do attachment parenting, so we didn&#39;t purchase a crib either (even just to keep next to our bed).<br/>
<br/>
Oh good! Nurseries are sorta weird, and create a ton more work for the<br/>
parents, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Any thoughts/suggestions/advice along these lines would be greatly appreciated.  We are also planning an unassisted home birth, unschooling, and elimination communication.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!! My first was one of those &quot;save the baby&quot; cesareans<br/>
that upon research, I figured out was utterly bogus, and for doctor<br/>
convenience. My second was a mostly-unassisted homebirth. It&#39;s the way<br/>
to go, for more reasons than would be On-Topic for this list. =)<br/>
<br/>
As for EC... I did it from 2 months with my first boy, from birth with<br/>
my second, and I&#39;m one of the moderators on the big EC list. Honestly,<br/>
I cannot imagine raising a child without it. So so so many things that<br/>
are passed off by our culture as &quot;baby is fussy&quot; is &quot;baby is telling<br/>
you they have to potty!!!&quot;. I really feel that this is one more way to<br/>
meet your child&#39;s needs, from birth, and is a serious trust-building<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Good on you for doing the work to give your babe the best start!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was just the opposite with me and George - he is a lighter <br/>
sleeper and was better able to &quot;tune in&quot; to Mo&#39;s cycles. I would <br/>
either not sleep at all with her next to me or sleep like a rock and <br/>
he would have to wake me up anyway. <br/>
<br/>
We started out with a futon on the floor and Mo on a cusion an arm&#39;s <br/>
length away from me. Once we got a stand for the futon Mo moved to a <br/>
crib with the siderail down - on George&#39;s side. We put a mat across <br/>
the intersection once she started moving around - she did the scoot-<br/>
with-the-feet thing before she could turn over.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem we had with sheets and blankets is one we still <br/>
have: Mo kicks them off in her sleep. As a baby she could get out of <br/>
any kind of swaddling - we made jokes about our baby-Houdini ;) <br/>

&gt; Heya!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chris, I&#39;d like to suggest that you wrap your head around the idea<br/>
&gt; that your children will make sleep challenging pretty much forever...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to avoid/delude/ignore/disassociate from such<br/>
thoughts. :)<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness though, sleep is pretty big for me and it&#39;s been a<br/>
challenge ever since moving in with Laura.  With that in mind, we&#39;ll<br/>
certainly be looking for ways to balance that out as best as we can,<br/>
so we&#39;ll see what works and then as time progresses try new things if<br/>
we notice the existing things not working.  I used to be a software<br/>
tester, so I&#39;m used to exhausting all sorts of different and creative<br/>
avenues to find what works best.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 1) the co-sleeping research you<br/>
&gt; refer to above is 99% sponsored by crib manufacturers, and 2) my son<br/>
&gt; slept better in physical contact with one of us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep in mind that most of these instructions are liability-based, not<br/>
&gt; sanity or real-world based, so please apply common sense more than<br/>
&gt; following directions. Use whatever sheets work, dress your baby in<br/>
&gt; whatever the baby&#39;s most comfortable in!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I figured was the case, which is why I figured I would ask<br/>
and get real-world opinions from those who have been in my shoes.  I<br/>
always try to learn from the experiences of others as I walk my own<br/>
paths and see what ultimately works for me.  I figure the more<br/>
perspectives I have, the better picture I have for options I may want<br/>
to consider.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Use it as a place to store the potty (we also did EC from birth),<br/>
&gt; tissues, water bottle, etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Funny you should mention this, because as soon as others said, &quot;The<br/>
co-sleeper is a waste of money and you&#39;ll never use it&quot; we figured it<br/>
would be a great place to keep the potty near the bed if we do switch<br/>
to a closer-knit co-sleeping situation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Oh good! Nurseries are sorta weird, and create a ton more work for the<br/>
&gt; parents, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we felt as well, but given that both Laura and I come from<br/>
very traditional backgrounds we find many challenges in pursuing<br/>
radically alternative lifestyles.  For that reason, we try to ask a<br/>
lot of questions and do a lot of research.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for EC... I did it from 2 months with my first boy, from birth with<br/>
&gt; my second, and I&#39;m one of the moderators on the big EC list. Honestly,<br/>
&gt; I cannot imagine raising a child without it. So so so many things that<br/>
&gt; are passed off by our culture as &quot;baby is fussy&quot; is &quot;baby is telling<br/>
&gt; you they have to potty!!!&quot;. I really feel that this is one more way to<br/>
&gt; meet your child&#39;s needs, from birth, and is a serious trust-building<br/>
&gt; activity.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve gathered from everything that we&#39;ve read, and I am<br/>
already on that EC list, in addition to two other local ones (SF Bay<br/>
Area) that I joined recently.<br/>
<br/>
For now, we&#39;ve bought about a dozen cloth diapers and are hoping that<br/>
it was an over-purchase during EC.  Also, can&#39;t wait to read our book<br/>
on sign language for babies.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Good on you for doing the work to give your babe the best start!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  <br/>
<br/>
It is very amazing, as Adriana said in another post -- all these<br/>
things sort of tie together with unschooling as there&#39;s a sort of<br/>
snowball effect as one thing leads to another which leads to another<br/>
and so on and so forth. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342038435">Hi Chris (and group),<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never used the co-sleeper but I&#39;ve had two unassisted births and get<br/>
too excited whenever the topic comes up to not chime in.<br/>
<br/>
Are you and your partner on the Unassisted Childbirth email list? That was a<br/>
huge resource for me. I read Emergency Childbirth as well ... I laughed at<br/>
the line, &quot;any reasonably intelligent 8 year old can deliver a baby.&quot; I also<br/>
really liked Active<br/>
Birth&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Active-Birth-Approach-Naturally-Revised/dp/1558320385">http://www.amazon.com/Active-Birth-Approach-Naturally-Revised/dp/1558320385</a>&gt;(amazon<br/>
link). That one really encouraged me to move around and stay upright<br/>
during labor.<br/>
<br/>
My first birth was a traditional drug filled micro-managed affair at a<br/>
hospital and it was awful. I  wouldn&#39;t wish that on anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I can go on and on and on about this stuff so I should stop.<br/>
<br/>
