<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310136589">Given that this list has been very, very slow lately, and it really isn&#39;t providing any information that isn&#39;t available elsewhere, we&#39;ve decided to shut it down. As soon as we figure out the details (yahoo&#39;s new changes are throwing us for a loop!) the list will go to read-only, so that it&#39;s still possible to search for old discussions. There&#39;s some good stuff in the archives.&nbsp; If you still like the Yahoo Groups format, and you like the particular style of discussion on this group, you might check out the Always Learning list, where you&#39;ll still see me and Joyce in addition to Sandra Dodd and other wonderful writers.

It&#39;s a fairly quiet list, although not quite as sleepy as things have been around here. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysUnschooled/info">http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysUnschooled/info</a> If you&#39;re preferring the facebook format, have a look at Radical Unschooling Info: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a> ---Meredith</div>
