She hasn&#39;t because they are usually spoken for by then. She has considered it and will maybe try this year. Several of my children go to historical reenactments as 1850&#39;s reenactors and she shears sheep by hand in full prairie dress (can I send a pic to this group? I really need to start a new blog) usually people are speaking for the fleece of the lambs as it falls off the sheep!<br/>
Btw we enjoyed the great slide show on your blog.<br/>
