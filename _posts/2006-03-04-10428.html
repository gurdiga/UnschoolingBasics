<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381748594">Hi,  My 6 yr old son is showing all the signs for adhd  his 17 yr  old half <br/>
brother struggled with this all through school and is currently in a  group <br/>
home for issues loosely related.  Had my husband  been a child  now I&#39;m sure he <br/>
would have been highly medicated, as it is  when he was  about this age they <br/>
(Dr and parents) gave him VALIUM, I cant imagine doing that  to a child.  Anyhow <br/>
 we knew last year for the brief amount of time he  was in Kindergarten that <br/>
this would be an issue if we staying in school.   As it is we pulled him and <br/>
his sister, jumped into un schooling and the rest I  though would be history.  <br/>
I personally love his energy,  I hate for  him though that others including <br/>
close family  look at him and sigh and  don&#39;t invite us over because of his lack <br/>
of attention span and what I love to  call his bounce off the ceiling <br/>
ability!   The reason I&#39;m looking for  guidance is that last night after being at my <br/>
mother for a bit he tearfully  asked me what was wrong with him that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t behave because he tried really  hard to be good but he just couldn&#39;t sit <br/>
still it made his head hurt   lol.  We have stumbled on by accident that a can <br/>
of MT DEW will totally  calm him down  but I question is that is safe or right <br/>
to do.   Medication is NOT an option for us as I don&#39;t feel that there is <br/>
enough to prove  that there isn&#39;t long term affects.  Also his brother who was put <br/>
on  ritilan at age 5 and had med&#39;s screwed with and changed yearly suffers <br/>
from HUGE  mental issues which I&#39;m my opinion is more due to med&#39;s than him.  <br/>
Thanks  for any advice and if I need to clarify anything just ask as I tend to <br/>
ramble at  time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378107781">I have heard that caffeine can have the opposite effect on some  kids. <br/>
 <br/>
I have found dietary issues to be a big part of my children&#39;s  behavior.  You <br/>
will just have to see what works for you.  These things  were getting in the <br/>
way of my children feeling good about themselves and their  ability to learn.  <br/>
We did Feingold  diet for awhile, then used Bioset  for allergy clearing and <br/>
now we use food enzymes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I would be glad to discuss these further off-list if you like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150811671">Courtney takes her ocd medicine but its her choice. She was the one that actually requested the trips to the dr because her anxiety over the ocd issue were getting to be to much. She knows though that she is free to stop medication at any time. <br/>
   <br/>
  So anyhow in my opinion Id gve him control over it. If he wants to say drink a mountain dew just before going to grandma&#39;s house know it will help him relax and sit still then great. Hey its a lot cheaper than all the Dr. visits and rx medications !<br/>
   <br/>
  Is it wrong? I personaly dont believe so and I know its a lot more right than parents who force the medications on their children just to make things easier on themselves.<br/>
   <br/>
  my 2 cents,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998930299">I&#39;d really like to answer a bit more in depth to this whole issue, but <br/>
first, could you tell me why he was getting in trouble at Grandma&#39;s?<br/>
I&#39;d be avoiding places where he couldn&#39;t be movement oriented if <br/>
that&#39;s what he needs at this stage. Is someone expecting him to not <br/>
move around too much? What caused the tears? I think some acceptance <br/>
of who he is, and the way he&#39;s wired would be really helpful.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s family, avoid hanging out at their houses and invite them to <br/>
yours instead....a place where he can be honored and not feel &quot;in <br/>
trouble&quot; all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224845354">I would really rethink why he got in trouble. I&#39;m sure it was from  <br/>
family members and not from you! But to think that he couldn&#39;t behave  <br/>
is ridiculous.  He should be celebrated for who he is, and what his  <br/>
most excellent skills are. We have two kids with autism, and because  <br/>
it is an invisible disability, we tend to catch flak for their  <br/>
behavior. it&#39;s our job to protect them. it&#39;s also our job to help  <br/>
them if they want it. For our kids it was a matter of providing  <br/>
support, providing alternatives. We&#39;ve also got a four year old who,  <br/>
if he was in public schools, they would push for testing for adhd.  <br/>
It&#39;s just who he is. We take him places. We allow him to get the  <br/>
movement he needs. Movement is how he thinks, how he learns, how he  <br/>
lives. Taking that away would be like taking away someone&#39;s vision  <br/>
and telling them to walk an unfamiliar path. It&#39;s not fair.<br/>
If other family members are getting on to him, I&#39;d be quick to step  <br/>
in. I&#39;d not take him over there. We&#39;ve done that with our kids. And  <br/>
when people ask why we&#39;re not showing up for family gatherings, i can  <br/>
honestly say that I will not take my children to a place where they  <br/>
are not welcome to be who they are. If my drunk uncle can show up and  <br/>
be an ass, then my child can be who she is. TMI, maybe, about my family?<br/>
On to medication. We totally do not medicate, and will not medicate  <br/>
any of our children. If they were old enough to ask for it, then we  <br/>
would talk about it, but I agree, it changes who they are. Josh has  <br/>
aspergers. When he gets stressed, we&#39;ve learned how to breath to  <br/>
relax. When Bre gets hyper, she gets the chance to run and bounce til  <br/>
it&#39;s gone. We&#39;d do the same for any child. Esp with Breanna, we did a  <br/>
lot of practice. We figured out how long she can sit. We reward her  <br/>
greatly for it. At age eight, she can sit for about 30 minutes at a  <br/>
restaurant.<br/>
We did give Breanna dr pepper for breakfast every morning when she  <br/>
was still in school because the caffeine did help (it&#39;s a stimulant,  <br/>
which is what most meds for hyperactivity are). It did get to the  <br/>
point where she had to ingest too much for the caffeine to help (like  <br/>
any medication, it gets to that point) there is a good book called  <br/>
&quot;The Caffeine Adantage: how to sharpen your mind _____&quot; Something  <br/>
like that, we got it from our library. Good read with interesting  <br/>
points. Might be so much garbage, but I liked it.<br/>
There is also a herbal remedy called &#39;calm child&#39; . It works well,  <br/>
has some interesting stuff in it (like catnip...also a stimulant)  <br/>
that you could consider. We&#39;ve given it to Bre, not Sam.<br/>
Sam cracks me up, everyone we know loves him. We can pretty much hear  <br/>
him hum from the vibration he gives off, and just sitting still you  <br/>
can see the potential energy in him. he&#39;s emotional, can go from  <br/>
joyous to heartbroken in a second. He&#39;s compassionate, loving,  <br/>
friendly, and probably the most loyal person i know. Not bad. It&#39;ll  <br/>
serve him well, i&#39;m thinking. I&#39;d say tell your son that absolutely  <br/>
nothing is wrong with him, but other people won&#39;t take the time to  <br/>
understand his needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838092482">My oldest, Sarah, is now 9. She&#39;s been medicated for her ADHD, but it was a disaster for her. She couldn&#39;t eat, and couldn&#39;t sleep and she never felt &quot;right&quot; she said. The dosage was never &quot;enough&quot; according to her teachers. Her last day of meds was her last day of Kindergarten. <br/>
   <br/>
  She will drink a couple Mountain Dews a day, sometimes she&#39;ll ask for coffee. I don&#39;t particularly notice a difference in her, but she says she can tell she&#39;s a little &quot;clearer&quot; when she has some of either. <br/>
   <br/>
  I would much rather her drink them than take Ritalin or Adderall again! <br/>
   <br/>
  I also have ADD (I am not usually hyper now although I used to be somewhat as a child). I have tried medications for it, but I didn&#39;t like the way they made me feel either! I&#39;d rather have a cuppa joe or two during the day if I feel I need it. <br/>
   <br/>
  I am VERY sorry to hear that your older son is having problems. I do agree that it is likely very related to the medications. Was he in school the whole time as well? <br/>
   <br/>
  (HUGS) to all of you as you heal and seek a different route! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472532690">Grandmas is a bit limiting as she lives in an apartment.  Knowing this  we <br/>
only go visit like once a mnth.  Mom coming here right now isnt  an option as <br/>
she had a major surgery on her leg and isnt cleared to drive  more than 20 <br/>
miles.  Im 30 away.  Last night issues where more hed run  and play and we were <br/>
playing with him and the more we played the more &quot;hyper&quot;  hed get in terms of <br/>
physical.  Its like there is no cutoff switch for whats  ok and what crosses the <br/>
line and just about everytime he gets really excited  someone (normally his <br/>
sister) gets hurt.  Its not something he means to  do  more like ok my mom and <br/>
him where playing with blocks  building  and knocking down over and over which <br/>
was cool then jacob instead of hitting the  cars staged a car accident and <br/>
slammed the car into grandma leaving a  bruise.   We avoid places that set him up <br/>
to fail  his great  grandma is in a nursing home  we do quick 10 minute we <br/>
love you trips in  there.  Like I tried to stress in my last post at home we <br/>
redirect give him  LOTS of active stimulation and flow with him, but he is <br/>
questioning why he  doesn&#39;t seem to be able to go places and not misbehave (the way <br/>
he terms  it).  For me its heartbreaking as I KNOW we have what I thought were <br/>
good  friends and even a few family memebers who dont invite us to do <br/>
anything or come  over when invited because they A cant handle him or B think we just <br/>
allow him to  be a brat.... which couldn&#39;t be furthur from the truth.  I also <br/>
know that  part of the mental issues is reaffirming that hes normal as in the <br/>
few months he  was in school the teacher had labeled him the bad jacob  there <br/>
were 2  jacobs  1 was the good jacob and my baby was the bad jacob,  i never  <br/>
realized with kids how that sticks  but recently we were in a store and a  <br/>
little girl came up and said Hi Bad Jacob  her mom was shocked and asked  her <br/>
why shed say that she very innocently said mommy that&#39;s what Mrs E called  him <br/>
the bad jacob.......  Anyhow Thanks for any and all insights!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844957770">There are lots of options between doing nothing to help your son and medicating him.  I used to help diagnose kids with ADHD and my son would definitely carry that diagnosis if we chose to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Things that help my son are:<br/>
<br/>
Getting plenty of rest<br/>
predictable flow of the day/week<br/>
massage<br/>
eating as balanced as possible<br/>
baths<br/>
lots of sports/physical activity<br/>
avoiding people that he makes crazy<br/>

   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  These are great! I also wanted to add that for times when you would like them to be somewhat still ( like the dr office) there are a few things Ive found useful. <br/>
   <br/>
  weight--one of those little pillows with the pellets to sit on their lap. <br/>
  gum--for my daughter its really calming esp when dealing with the noise of several people in a small space<br/>
  fidget toys--small slider puzzles, stretchy slime or silly puddy, rubicks cubes, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  Speaking of Dr&#39;s I miss our old Dr. in texas so badly. She was in an old house and they had a fenced in playyard . So much less anxiety involved when you arent being told to be still and quiet. <br/>
