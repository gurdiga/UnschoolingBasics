Oriented Parenting is a challenging one. Your questions reminds of the<br/>

that the child is already someone today. - Stacia Tauscher&quot;<br/>

merchant and peasant class) until the 18th or 19th centuries.  School<br/>
didn&#39;t become mandatory until recent history.  Prior to that school<br/>
was optional, expensive, private, and mostly run by the churches (at<br/>
least mass schools).  Medieval schools were mostly following the<br/>
trivium or quadrium thought of education (memorization, rhetoric and<br/>
composition).  But these schools were really for the elite. They were<br/>
very costly to attend.  children were children until they were old<br/>
enough to become apprenticed.  They would play and follow their<br/>
(mostly) mothers around mimicking or helping her work.  Children<br/>
&quot;worked&quot; not because they were expected to but because it was a good<br/>
way for mothers to keep little hands busy while she tended to the<br/>
things she needed to do.<br/>
<br/>
Once apprenticed (sometimes in their father&#39;s profession and sometimes<br/>
in someone else&#39;s) they learned those things they needed for their<br/>
profession.  Sometimes it was something that the child was interested<br/>
in and sometimes it wasn&#39;t.  Those that liked their profession did<br/>
well in business.  Those that didn&#39;t, well, didn&#39;t.  We have to<br/>
remember that their worlds were much smaller than our worlds.  they<br/>
only knew what went on around them, usually within a one mile<br/>
circumference of their homes.  They had heard of other cities and<br/>
towns and professions, but they were about as mythical as our thinking<br/>
of astronauts working on the space station.  We&#39;ve heard about it,<br/>
read about and seen pictures, but for the most part it is truly<br/>
mysterious to us.<br/>
<br/>
In a way we are regressing :-)<br/>

    How long has Unschooling been around?  Have there been any studies <br/>
on<br/>
how Unschooled children end up doing in the work-force?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling was coined by John Holt, an educator and school reformer in <br/>
the 60s & 70s. He finally gave up on reforming schools when he found <br/>
they were inherently flawed and unreformable.  He died in 1985.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is how humans have learned for eons.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children do quite well in the &quot;work-force.&quot; No studies.<br/>
