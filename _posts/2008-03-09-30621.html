She and the girls are VERY active with Pony Club now and are still <br/>
head-over-heels in love with their horses and their lives! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

unschooling horses...<br/>
<br/>
Many of you may remember me posting about getting our first horse a <br/>
year and<br/>
a half ago after attending the Live and Learn Conference in MA and<br/>
participating in Barbara Sher&#39;s workshop. It seemed like such an <br/>
impossible<br/>
dream at the time but I was able to look at the reality of what stood<br/>
between us and our dream of horse ownership, then I was able to address<br/>
those issues and make it happen. It was the beginning of a wonderful<br/>
journey for us~ an incredible learning/loving experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if I wrote about the purchase or our second horse last <br/>
summer,<br/>
but Leigh, my 11 yo dd, took ownership of Sugar, our first horse, and we<br/>
purchased a second horse for Lilly (8 at the time) named Snickers.<br/>
Unfortunately, over the next few months we came to the realization that<br/>
Snickers just wasn&#39;t going to work out. (she bucked and spooked and spun<br/>
and was just too much horse for Lilly once she got in shape) We ended up<br/>
putting her up for sale last fall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In January, someone came to look at her. We explained the problems we <br/>
were<br/>
having with her. She asked us if we had found an appropriate mount for <br/>
Lilly<br/>
yet. We told her no we hadn&#39;t. She offered us a trade.our mare for her<br/>
older gelding. We went to meet Skippy and try him out and even though we<br/>
weren&#39;t positive that he would work out, we felt good about the trade<br/>
because he was at least a safe horse that we felt we could work with <br/>
and if<br/>
not, we knew we could sell him more easily because he didn&#39;t buck or <br/>
take<br/>
off on you, he was only a bit on the quick side and a little nervous. <br/>
And<br/>
we knew that Snickers was going to a good knowledgeable home where they<br/>
could handle her issues. It was almost too good to be true.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Skippy is working out working out really well and we love him a <br/>
lot!<br/>
A couple months ago we tossed around the idea of building a small barn <br/>
and<br/>
riding arena at home and in the end we decided to do it. (it&#39;s always <br/>
scary<br/>
going further into debt but in this case, it&#39;s a win-win situation for <br/>
us.<br/>
Our barn loan payment will about equal our board payments and it&#39;ll <br/>
increase<br/>
the value of our property to boot.) I finally feel like I know enough <br/>
about<br/>
horses to care for them ourselves (it&#39;s amazing what hands on experience<br/>
will do for you) and I feel very comfortable with handling both of our<br/>
horses and their quirks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful and latest news is that our barn is almost finished! Our<br/>
fencing is all up and in about a week our horses will be coming to live <br/>
at<br/>
home. Because we won&#39;t be working at the boarding barn anymore (we <br/>
shovel<br/>
stalls and water 16+- horses 7 days a week most weeks in exchange for <br/>
part<br/>
of our board) we will have a lot more time to enjoy our own horses. <br/>
We&#39;ll<br/>
be able to look out our windows and see our favorite furry friends at <br/>
any<br/>
time of the day or night. We&#39;ll have a lot more time to just enjoy them <br/>
and<br/>
hang out with them and we are really excited!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our last name begins with an S and our horses&#39; names both begin with an <br/>
S<br/>
and so we decided to name our farm &quot;Big S Farm.&quot; Say that three times <br/>
fast!<br/>
LOL!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made a blog to show some pictures of our new barn if you want to <br/>
