<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198692905">Is you all!<br/>
<br/>
And on that note, after driving myself mad for a couple days searching and<br/>
pondering stuff about right-brained learners, and beginning to think my<br/>
child has a &#39;problem&#39; with learning, I&#39;m stopping myself right here, right<br/>
now and coming to you for answers.  I trust this list, and I cherish the<br/>
information I gather here, so am hoping I&#39;ll get some good input.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old son, I believe, is probably a right brained learner.  However,<br/>
I refuse to think of him as learning disabled, etc.  All the stuff I&#39;m<br/>
finding on-line is giving me a very icky feeling in my stomach, so I know<br/>
it&#39;s not the information I&#39;m intended to find.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got new friends, not unschoolers, but homeschoolers, who do some<br/>
school at home kinds of things, so I know that this is what&#39;s causing all of<br/>
my angst.  Uggh.  Anyway, this morning she (mom) made a comment to me about<br/>
how her 9yo ds wanted to show Saylor a magic trick, and the mom said, yeah,<br/>
you should, and then he said &quot;but, it&#39;s got math in it and Saylor doesn&#39;t<br/>
know Math, he said he really wants to know it, but he doesn&#39;t&quot;  (this is her<br/>
rendition of the story to me).  So, I&#39;m trying to figure out if she&#39;s<br/>
dropping some sort of judgement on me, like &quot;i can&#39;t believe you aren&#39;t<br/>
teaching your kid math&quot;, or what?  I did talk to Saylor about that, asking<br/>
him if he told his friend he &quot;didn&#39;t know Math&quot;, Saylor said he never said<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like my ds isn&#39;t happy sometimes.  Maybe he is having issues with not<br/>
being able to read, etc?  How do I support him through this?  We live a rich<br/>
life, really we do.  We&#39;re busy all the time doing the things he wants to<br/>
do; kayak, hike, fish, swim, etc.  But, if we aren&#39;t doing something like<br/>
that, then we&#39;re home and he seems lost and unhappy.  And some of this gets<br/>
turned into anger and aggression towards his little brother(s).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas here?  I don&#39;t know what else to share, because I&#39;m not even sure<br/>
what I&#39;m asking for, exactly?  Maybe someone else has been there and can<br/>
share their story?  Maybe someone has another insight that I&#39;m completely<br/>
missing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Karen<br/>

subject of Gardner&#39;s theory of Multiple Intelligences would help, so <br/>
here ya go:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so you&#39;re looking for a way to &quot;explain&quot; your kid to others? <br/>
Yikes. I haven&#39;t run into this too much wrt &quot;academic&quot; stuff, but I <br/>
have with behavioral stuff - as in &quot;you should do what I do and yell <br/>
at your kid more&quot;. Kind of frustrating. I try to stick with vague <br/>
replies like &quot;that wouldn&#39;t work for our family&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, here&#39;s a question for you - do you believe your son is <br/>
learning about &quot;math&quot; in his own way already? If you&#39;re feeling some <br/>
insecurities in this area you&#39;re more likely to be unnerved by this <br/>
kind of statement. Do *you* need help seeing &quot;math&quot; in your real <br/>
lives so that you can better trust that your kid really is learning?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe he needs more active stuff he can do at home. Maybe he needs <br/>
to be active and social at the same time - that&#39;s an issue with my <br/>
stepson from time to time. He loves to do Big Active things, but he <br/>
also likes to do them with other people. So we&#39;re always on the <br/>
lookout for folks with outdoor hobbies and interests who would be <br/>
willing to bring him along. We&#39;ve found a few - Ray got to go <br/>
waterskiing a bunch this summer, for example, even though its not <br/>
something our family can afford. <br/>

Weeelllll...<br/>
I think the whole left-brain/right-brain thing is a myth to a large<br/>
degree. I understand that people like to use it as a model to<br/>
understand how some people absorb information, but it&#39;s<br/>
over-generalized.:) I know that&#39;s not what you&#39;re asking, but read<br/>
this: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2007/06/left-brain-right-brain-myth.html">http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2007/06/left-brain-right-brain-myth.html</a><br/>
<br/>
As to the physical needs...<br/>
Jalen also has very high physical needs. If he doesn&#39;t get enough<br/>
large motor movements he gets very tense and twitchy. I can actually<br/>
see him losing control, making everyone around him miserable if we<br/>
aren&#39;t proactive. He needs to climb, run, jump, flip etc...<br/>
<br/>
His other challenge (for me anyway) is transitions. Once he&#39;s doing a<br/>
thing, he wants to keep doing it. He&#39;ll flow through his own<br/>
transitions between computer, video game and tv as long as no one else<br/>
is influencing that...but with siblings there is that need to share<br/>
the resources and it&#39;s very hard for him.  There is also the aspect of<br/>
leaving to go somewhere and trying to transition towards that. We&#39;ve<br/>
learned some better tools along the way, for helping it flow better<br/>
for all of us. This last year has been a HUGE one for him in terms of<br/>
development and gaining new tools.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you have a specific situation where there was a challenge? It<br/>
sounds like this other woman shook your normally confident self and<br/>
that&#39;s what this is about, rather than your child&#39;s way of being.:)<br/>
<br/>
I try to hang out with people that understand Jalen&#39;s uniqueness and<br/>
can be supportive, though it&#39;s become less and less of an issue this<br/>
past year. We spent several hours at a friend&#39;s house playing last<br/>
week, without a single incident. This is really BIG for us. The little<br/>
boy that he was playing with is one that also has a hard time<br/>
understanding other people&#39;s personal space and has upset Jalen in the<br/>
past (though Jalen also has not understood this subtle art in the past<br/>
either....pretty common at 6y.o.) yet they played happily for almost<br/>
three hours.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the right brain hype. Saylor is simply Saylor. All is well and<br/>
if he&#39;s having difficulties then focus on how to support him through<br/>
those. We have several ways that Jalen can get movement indoors so<br/>
when we can&#39;t get outside there are ways to MOVE.:)<br/>
<br/>
Meet the needs, support him for exactly who-he-is and let the<br/>
naysayers mutter incoherently to themselves.<br/>
