Susan, I just HAVE to say how glad I am to meet another person nursing  their <br/>
young child! I&#39;m tandeming my 4-almost-5 year old and his sister, who is 2  <br/>
next month. Sometimes I have some serious nursing aversion happening, and I&#39;m  <br/>
always on the look-out for people to talk about it with who&#39;s first reaction  <br/>
won&#39;t be &quot;Wean!!!&quot; I am lucky to know 2 in person and a person or two <br/>
online...I  hope I can add you to my list of Breastfeeding Friends, lol. I am sure of <br/>
my  feelings to have child-lead weaning, but it&#39;s such a lonely road at times. <br/>
 Thanks for commenting on the wonderful Gramma Alice&#39;s siggy line (I love it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043605367">Hi!  I&#39;m Flo and I&#39;m new here-I have a 4 year old son and an almost 3 (in a<br/>

are nursing or tandem nursing toddlers and preschoolers-you are definitely<br/>
not alone!  And I totally agree-I wish it wasn&#39;t perceived as &quot;shocking&quot; to<br/>

My 4.8yo son &#39;officially&#39; breastfed until he was 2yrs, but consistently requested nursing until -well- today  I only began weaning him for the sake of comfort, as he began chewing instead of suckling, and my blessed nursing experience was becoming too painful to endure sanely. Nevertheless, he has never really stopped nursing entirely. I see it as a comfort to him unlike any other, and see no reason to take that away.<br/>
  Funny, I called my MIL/FIL who&#39;ve had/nursed 11 children+wet-nursed 4 more, during the time I planned to start weaning to ask &#39;When are they ready to stop nursing?&#39; My FIL replied, &quot;Never...when he is 21 and has a wife to replace you!&quot; My in-laws have been a huge source of encouragement, as has my husband, to allow our children to decide when the right time to stop nursing is. <br/>
  I, too, look forward to the day when we won&#39;t be ridiculed by those who simply don&#39;t understand.But just think...if WE feel strongly about it, imagine how strongly our kids will feel on the subject when they are in our positions. Positive change is coming, and we are creating it by planting these seeds of love in our children. <br/>

probably asks everyday. I do try to distract him since honestly I&#39;m <br/>
sometimes not comfortable with it anymore. It comes and goes. The <br/>
most difficult time for me (and him) is first thing in the morning. <br/>
He&#39;s one of those kids who has pretty well always woken up crying or <br/>
moaning. When he was a baby, it usually didn&#39;t get that far since <br/>
he&#39;d nurse right away. But then his brother was born...and usually my <br/>
little one would be nursing when my older boy woke up crying for <br/>
milk. All four of us are in the bed together so I would be right next <br/>
to him. I know many moms tandem nurse in really bizarre positions but <br/>
that was not what Sam wanted, he wanted me all to himself. Nothing <br/>
but solo-me-facing-him nursing would do. The mornings became <br/>
unbearable since all the crying would wake up Quinn who would have <br/>
slept for a couple more hours otherwise. Eventually, I started <br/>
replying Sam could nurse after he had breakfast and dh would get up <br/>
with him. As soon as Sam was up and on the couch reading with dh, he <br/>
was as happy as could be. And he usually wouldn&#39;t ask for milk for <br/>
several hours afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
But this was all heart-wrenching for me. It was clearly a need on <br/>
Sam&#39;s part but I couldn&#39;t meet it in the way he needed or wanted it. <br/>
Within days of making the rule &quot;after breakfast&quot; he started waking up <br/>
less unhappily. I don&#39;t necessarily think this is a good thing, <br/>
possibly just a sign that he interpreted it as, &quot;don&#39;t tell us about <br/>
it&quot;. But I do feel okay that within seconds of waking up, he was <br/>
cheerfully reading books with his daddy.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe in child-led weaning but it is a dance with often <br/>
more than two partners and all needs need to be considered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118457205">My third child was born just before my oldest daughter turned five. <br/>
She and her younger sister nursed through my pregnancy. When the <br/>
third baby was born I ended up with too much bleeding and had to stay <br/>
in hospital for four days. New baby had jaundice and needed as much <br/>
milk as possible. It was really terrible as they had never really <br/>
been away from me. This ended up being an adult led almost weaning <br/>
for my almost five year old. I still feel very sad about it. She was <br/>
still allowed to occasionally nurse, but the first month I had to <br/>
tell her no so many times. After that it was an only occasional <br/>
thing. This wasn&#39;t the child led weaning that I had wanted for her. <br/>
Maybe it was good for her to know that the baby and the toddler <br/>
needed it more. Maybe it has made her feel a little displaced. I go <br/>
back and forth with my thinking about it. With three under five maybe <br/>
there is no perfect solution. Nursing was such a happy time for her. <br/>
I wish it hadn&#39;t ended in a sad way. Maybe it always ends in a way <br/>
that is a little sad.<br/>
<br/>
still pondering,<br/>

&gt;slept for a couple more hours otherwise. Eventually, I started<br/>
&gt;replying Sam could nurse after he had breakfast and dh would get up<br/>
&gt;with him. As soon as Sam was up and on the couch reading with dh, he<br/>
&gt;was as happy as could be. And he usually wouldn&#39;t ask for milk for<br/>
&gt;several hours afterwards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But this was all heart-wrenching for me. It was clearly a need on<br/>
&gt;Sam&#39;s part but I couldn&#39;t meet it in the way he needed or wanted it.<br/>
&gt;Within days of making the rule &quot;after breakfast&quot; he started waking up<br/>
&gt;less unhappily. I don&#39;t necessarily think this is a good thing,<br/>
&gt;possibly just a sign that he interpreted it as, &quot;don&#39;t tell us about<br/>
&gt;it&quot;. But I do feel okay that within seconds of waking up, he was<br/>
&gt;cheerfully reading books with his daddy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I strongly believe in child-led weaning but it is a dance with often<br/>
&gt;more than two partners and all needs need to be considered.<br/>

I guess  I&#39;m &quot;new&quot; to this but I have a 6 year old daughter and the thought <br/>
of her  breastfeeding from me blows me away. Do you breastfeed because it&#39;s  <br/>
comforting to him? I would imagine, like you have stated, that it hurts!  It <br/>
seems like you could just make him a sandwich or something...unless  it&#39;s a <br/>
comfort issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was one of the mamas here that jumped at the chance to discuss extendd  <br/>
nursing, so I can answer a teeny bit. <br/>
 <br/>
My son is 4, will be 5 in September and there is no way he&#39;s gonna be done  <br/>
by then, lol. It&#39;s just who he is, and I&#39;m doing all I can to help him be his  <br/>
truest self. For us, that means nursing until he is done. Not so much with the <br/>
 DH, who is still uncomfy with children who are able to ask, lol, but I&#39;m <br/>
working  n a slow training of that handsome and wonderful man ;) I am also <br/>
nursing my  baby that will be 2 in late July. I also nursed my other 3 from my first <br/>
 marriage - my oldest until 3.5 (I asked her to stop and she did) and the <br/>
other  two were nearly 3 when they quit themselves. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s definitely not a snack or a food issue, though it was when they both  <br/>
had the rotovirus and couldn&#39;t keep anything but my milk down. I do believe it  <br/>
saved us from hospitalization. It&#39;s a time for Julian to feel calm, to feel  <br/>
connected to me, to feel special in this wild house of 5 kids and to help him  <br/>
fall asleep. When his feelings are hurt, or his body is hurt, it&#39;s quick, easy <br/>
 and loving comfort. It&#39;s just an extension of our relationship, and it has <br/>
grown  with us - changed as time has passed. The positioning, the reasoning, <br/>
the style,  then whens and wheres...At times, it DOES hurt. But I ask him to <br/>
relatch and  usually it&#39;s ok. Recently, the sensation hasn&#39;t been psychologically <br/>
comfortable  for me, and so we are talking more about weaning and what types <br/>
of differences  there will be as that happens. I always assure him that his <br/>
favorite time to  nurse will remain as long as he needs it, but the early <br/>
morning and occasional  times in the night need to be gone. We have a &quot;rule&quot; (don&#39;t <br/>
laugh, all you RUs,  lol! ;) ) that we nurse one time in the day, and often he <br/>
forgets about it, or  is too busy to do so - and that&#39;s fine with me! I&#39;m not <br/>
too ridged with it  however, but it&#39;s rarely asked for more than one time a <br/>
day. <br/>
 <br/>
If you are interested in why and how of nursing preschool age children  (ack! <br/>
I just caught myself!), of nursing the very young child ;) , there are a  few <br/>
great things out there. Kellymom.com has some, lalecheleague.org does too,  <br/>
and the book, &quot;Mothering Your Nursing Toddler by Norma Bumgarner has some more  <br/>
involved info on it. But I admit - this group and my in-person homeschooling  <br/>
group I belong to, has been the MOST informative and helpful in my &quot;dark <br/>
hours&quot;  of wanting to rip them off and chuck &#39;em out the window! ;)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you asked, Jen, because 1) I like talking about it, as I consider  <br/>
myself a lactavist and an LC with no letters behind her name (I am self  <br/>
educated, lol! Figures, huh?!) and 2) it has helped me remember why I still  nurse <br/>
my kids :)<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Of course it is a comfort issue. A sandwich really wouldn&#39;t help.<br/>
When a baby is nursed he receives nourishment to body, brain <br/>
chemistry and soul. My baby nurses for comfort as much as for food. <br/>
The baby is relaxed, centered,  and bonded by the experience. It is a <br/>
return to mother and child being one, as in the womb.<br/>
My three year old nurses primarily for this comfort and connection.<br/>
My oldest daughter no longer nurses. It is hit and miss sometimes <br/>
about whether I can connect with her and comfort her as instantly and <br/>
deeply. Sometimes when she is really overwhelmed and upset, I wish I <br/>
could nurse her, because my words and arms are not enough. Nursing always was.<br/>
<br/>
and to Susan, although it is challenging, try to enjoy your last <br/>
fleeting moments of nursing your son, you will likely miss it when it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>

&gt; &gt;yep, he&#39;s 5 1/2. Although he doesn&#39;t nurse everyday anymore. But he<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably asks everyday. I do try to distract him since honestly I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;sometimes not comfortable with it anymore. It comes and goes. The<br/>
&gt; &gt;most difficult time for me (and him) is first thing in the morning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;He&#39;s one of those kids who has pretty well always woken up crying or<br/>
&gt; &gt;moaning. When he was a baby, it usually didn&#39;t get that far since<br/>
&gt; &gt;he&#39;d nurse right away. But then his brother was born...and usually my<br/>
&gt; &gt;little one would be nursing when my older boy woke up crying for<br/>
&gt; &gt;milk. All four of us are in the bed together so I would be right next<br/>
&gt; &gt;to him. I know many moms tandem nurse in really bizarre positions but<br/>
&gt; &gt;that was not what Sam wanted, he wanted me all to himself. Nothing<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yikes! I&#39;m trying to see that comment in a lighthearted joking way,<br/>
because otherwise it appears quite rude. Breastfeeding is about so<br/>
much more than food - it is nurturing in ways that a sandwich could<br/>
never compete with.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t picture nursing my 5 year old at the moment but that&#39;s mainly<br/>
because we haven&#39;t had a breastfeeding relationship for many years,<br/>
but if he&#39;d been nursing the whole time it would  feel natural. It<br/>
isn&#39;t what I&#39;m currently doing, but I can definitely understand<br/>
breastfeeding beyond the infant & toddler years.<br/>
<br/>
Despite societal pressure on moms to wean their children at just a few<br/>
months old, extended bf is not that uncommon and is widely practiced<br/>
in other cultures. There are 5 and 6 yo (and older) that still find<br/>
occasional nursing beneficial.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085851006">I am new here but wanted to jump in here a bit. My youngest son just weaned a few weeks ago and he was 5 in april. For him it had nothing to do with nourishment the past few years and was all about comfort and bonding. I never thought I would nurse this long, my other 3 kids weaned much earlier, but as the time went by it just continued to feel natural. As he got older he was only allowed to nurse one time a day and his favorite time was nap time. <br/>
He has asthma and I totally believe breastfeeding has kept him from having worse issues with it. Now that he has been weaned for a few weeks he has had one asthma attack on top of the other but when he was nursing he very rarely had any problems.<br/>
He totally weaned by himself. One day he said he was done and he never asked for it again. I am glad he is done in a way but am a bit sad that that part of my life is done with. I will not be having any more babies and will never nurse another baby...<br/>
I really think that it just depends on what you are comfortable with. Our dr always told us to breastfeed as long as it was mutually agreed upon...so not me forcing him to and not him making me continue past what I felt comfortable with. I was always certain though that he would reach a point that he decided he no longer wanted to nurse...<br/>
As far as hurting, it very rarely hurt, once in awhile if he had a cold he would latch a bit odd and I would tell him it was hurting and he would relatch,<br/>
I think it was a total comfort to him and to me was something special that only I could give him. It was a nursng relationship between the 2 of us. My body responded to him by producing the amount of milk he needed. It is quite amazing when you think of how the body works to produce milk for a baby.<br/>
If it would be uncomfortable to nurse an older child then it would not be the right thing for you to do, but for some people it is just a natural part of life and is not looked upon any differently then other stages of life.<br/>

<br/>
  I guess I&#39;m &quot;new&quot; to this but I have a 6 year old daughter and the thought <br/>
  of her breastfeeding from me blows me away. Do you breastfeed because it&#39;s <br/>
  comforting to him? I would imagine, like you have stated, that it hurts! It <br/>

  comfort issue.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it does. Jalen weened himself at 4.5 years and while it was nice<br/>
in some ways, I really wished that he still nursed many times. He is<br/>
an incredibly intense human being and there was one less tool for<br/>
helping him get calm when upset.<br/>
<br/>
On the sandwich issue....there isn&#39;t a food more nourishing for a<br/>
young person than breast milk. It&#39;s like a mega-multivitamin, enzyme,<br/>
immune boosting super food. Why wouldn&#39;t I give that to my child?<br/>
What&#39;s in a sandwich that can beat it? I would give my child a<br/>
sandwich if that&#39;s what they wanted, and a boob with breastmilk if<br/>
that&#39;s what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Why would a parent offer a sandwich when a child asks for milk? That&#39;s<br/>
like offering a mint when someone asks for chocolate! Just isn&#39;t the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251473364">My first daughter stopped nursing, of her own accord, at 18 months. I was a<br/>
little heart broken, because we had such a great nursing relationship, and<br/>
it was something we both really enjoyed. Lila is someone who is extremely<br/>
engaged by the world around her, and in non-stop motion from the time she<br/>
wakes up to the time she goes to sleep. I honestly think she just ran out of<br/>
time during her very busy days to remember to nurse LOL!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We had our 2nd child 2 wks before Lila&#39;s 3rd birthday. When she saw Pippa<br/>
nursing, she became very interested in being a part of this experience. She<br/>
would talk about what she remembered about nursing (a truly surprising<br/>
amount, IMO!), and how much she enjoyed nursing, and that she missed it. I<br/>
let her know, every time she mentioned missing her &quot;nummies&quot; that she was<br/>
welcome to nurse again. She was really funny about it. At first she was like<br/>
&quot;Nooooooooo!!!!! You&#39;re silly!&quot; Then, little by little, she started playing<br/>
at nursing again. After about 3 weeks of this little &quot;courtship with the<br/>
boob,&quot; she latched on again, a little awkwardly at first, but now, several<br/>
times a week, she latches like the pro she&#39;s always been. Up until about a<br/>
week ago, she always wanted to nurse when Pippa was nursing, and she had to<br/>
decide who got which side (Lila always wanted the fuller one, of course<br/>
:-)). Fortunately, Pippa, who is 10 months now, LOVES when Lila nurses at<br/>
the same time as her. This week, Lila also wanted to nurse on her own a few<br/>
times. So I think at first, Lila, in one sense, wanted what Pippa was<br/>
getting (I know there is more to it than that, but I&#39;m exhausted, so that&#39;s<br/>
all I&#39;ve got to offer right now LOL!), and now, I feel she has just really<br/>
re-connected in her own right. I couldn&#39;t be happier. Lila was really<br/>
interested in &quot;people&quot; food by the age of 6 months, demanding it, really.<br/>
Pippa, on the other hand, at 10 months has NO interest whatsoever. I laugh<br/>
to myself when I hear people saying, in response to someone else&#39;s concerns<br/>
about when to wean that &quot;don&#39;t worry about it .they won&#39;t be nursing when<br/>
they go off to college/get their driver&#39;s license/reach puberty/etc,&quot;<br/>
because sometimes I think Pippa will, she loves it so much LOL!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also have a very dear friend (a fellow unschooler) who still nurses her 5<br/>
and 7 year old, only a few times a week, but that bond is still there. The 7<br/>
yr old seems about ready to stop (and may have, by now) but the 5 yr old<br/>
still wants that &quot;once-a-day to unwind&quot; nursing session. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, nurse on, I say. The benefits are immeasurable.<br/>

Shannon, the time it actually *hurts* for me, versus just slightly  uncomfy, <br/>

really does hurt then...but also with Julia and she&#39;s aaaaalmost 2 ;) <br/>

Very nice! I&#39;m glad to hear that. My DH&#39;s father nursed until 7, too. Some  <br/>
was culture (grew up in Guadalajara) and some was for sad reasons - his mama  <br/>
lost a good amount of children in their early childhood/infancy. He says,  <br/>
jokingly (I suppose to lighten the pain a bit and perhaps to use humor to cover  <br/>
the age stigma) that, &quot;Somebody had to take the milk!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And THANK you for sharing your semi-relactation store...lol...renursing,  <br/>
perhaps? Doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just really neat. May I share that with some of my  <br/>
breastfeeding mamas I&#39;m helping? It&#39;s ok if it&#39;s not. I&#39;d edit out names and <br/>

understand how hard it must of been being separated from your older <br/>
children and your worries about your oldest child&#39;s feelings. It is <br/>
such a deep intimate bond that nursing brings. How wonderful for you to <br/>
have given that to her for so long. And I agree that perhaps the end <br/>
will always be a little sad. I know I will have very mixed feelings <br/>
when Sam (and Quinn) weans and I&#39;m sure he may have mixed feelings <br/>
about it too. Once a few months ago, he told his younger brother that <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t nurse forever and of course the younger one broke out in <br/>
tears.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624442002">Historically, nursing to age 3-5 was the norm. In some cultures, even <br/>
up to age 7 was the norm until as recently as 50 years ago (the <br/>
Canadian and Alaskan Arctic).<br/>
<br/>
Nursing provides so much more than just food. But historically it also <br/>
afforded survival. Many an extended breastfeeding mother will tell a <br/>
story of how thankful she was for nursing during a serious (or even <br/>
mild) illness. I can&#39;t imagine how miserable my older boy would have <br/>
been with chicken pox this winter without nursing. With nursing, it was <br/>
like I had a magic wand.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably more extended breastfeeding families around than you <br/>
know. Not necessarily because they are &quot;closet nursers&quot; but more likely <br/>
because once a child gets older, they are less likely to nurse when <br/>
they are out and busy. But when they are home and reconnecting with <br/>
their parents during down-times, this is when they yo-yo back into <br/>
mama. Yo-yo out - explore, learn, push themselves, yo-yo back in and <br/>
rejuvenate and allow themselves to be the little ones that they still <br/>
really are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765211659">Please do share! The politics of breastfeeding in this country (USA) are<br/>
intolerable .way too much anti-breastfeeding info going around. And I&#39;m sure<br/>
there are many people (like me, initially) who believe that once a child is<br/>
weaned, there&#39;s no going back. For me it was a matter of following my<br/>
instincts; since then I&#39;ve gotten a bit of support for the idea - La Leche<br/>
League supports this, the story of the woman who&#39;s car ran off a<br/>
snow-covered road, and breastfed her children (one who had already weaned)<br/>
for several days while her husband went for help, and of course, my dh and<br/>
my unschooling friends who are completely supportive. So anything that puts<br/>
a positive message out there, and can give other women a little dose of<br/>
courage (! What a shame that we even need courage in this country to<br/>
breastfeed our toddlers!) is okay with me.<br/>

(usually a few minutes each day but not every single day) .  The need is not<br/>
usually linked to hunger.  She also snuggles without nursing a lot.  It is<br/>
sweet and will end when it does.  BTW, when she&#39;s hungry I do make her a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805817215">We missed the 18 months check-up, so we went this month at 20, the dr said my ds is doing great, to keep doing what I`m doing but to wean him?!? Cause when I told them I still nurse they asked me how many times a day( This question has been like a nightmare from the start), they assumed that only once and when i told them whenever he wants , sometimes hourly thay were a little bit shocked. They asked if this is the custom in Romania, and I told them that this is my belief after careful consideration of all the facts and I intend to breastfeed at least till three years<br/>
  Why are drs suggesting to cut the nursing after 1 when th WHO recomands at least 2 years and after that as long as both parts wish to continue?<br/>

<br/>
There is absolutely no reason to wean mama! You are providing the <br/>
absolute best for your toddler. Doctors get about two hours of <br/>
breastfeeding teaching in all the time spent in medical school. So <br/>
you are far more the expert than your doctor when it comes to <br/>
breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my 2 1/2 year old seems to want to nurse every hour! But if <br/>
I really looked at it over a full 24 hours, he&#39;s not nursing anywhere <br/>
near every hour. They do slowly reduce their nursing as they get <br/>
older and more confident in the world.<br/>
<br/>
See if you can find a local La Leche League. Most chapters have <br/>
weekly or monthly meetings. Here you will find lots of great support <br/>
for mothering and breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
As far as weaning goes, look to your child and look to your heart. <br/>
You will know what is right for your family. No &quot;expert&quot; can tell you <br/>
this.<br/>

I have long wondered that, along with the early intro to solid (pre 6  <br/>
months) and what-not. My doctor knows I&#39;m nursing Julian at 4+ and he  congratulated <br/>
me on that and said how selfless I was. Said I should continue  what I&#39;m <br/>
doing and he is behind me 104% lol ;) Good man, Dr. Gordon. Gotta love  him, lol. <br/>
