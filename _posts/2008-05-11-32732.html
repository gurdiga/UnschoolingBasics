<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359940497">So...I&#39;ve been writing a lot these last two days. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a high. Literally, I WAS high yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
13,000 feet.<br/>
<br/>
And then I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane!<br/>
<br/>
Ben said last year that he wanted to sky-dive. Being the loving wife <br/>
that I am, that&#39;s what I gave him for his birthday: a tandem trip out <br/>
of an airplane.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Cameron wanted to go too, so we added him. Then his <br/>
girlfriend, Carly, HAD to jump too, so we added her. Duncan wanted to, <br/>
but, at 12, he&#39;s too young. I wanted to as well; but because Dunc <br/>
wouldn&#39;t jump for six more years, I agreed to wait and jump with him <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
But when yesterday came, Dunc didn&#39;t want to get up so early and drive <br/>
all the way there just to watch, so he stayed home and slept late.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was geared up and waiting---and there was an empty spot. So I <br/>
took it!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a l-o-n-g way down from 13,000 feet!<br/>
<br/>
Being the birthday boy, Ben got the video. The rest of us will just <br/>
have to settle with our memories. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll ALL go again in six years with Duncan. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for Dunc: he&#39;s leaving tomorrow morning for Atlanta to fly up to <br/>
Boston *all by himself* to stay with friends for a week until we get <br/>
there for the North East Unschooling Conference. He&#39;s very excited (he <br/>
won&#39;t sleep tonight, I know!) and I&#39;m sure a little frightened. But the <br/>
excitement&#39;s definitely winning out! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I took a big step yesterday, and Duncan&#39;s taking a big one tomorrow!<br/>

I&#39;ll tell him, but his REAL birthday is February 2---he&#39;s a Groundhog <br/>

This was just the first free, unscheduled, blue-sky weekend available <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660313724">1 - Happy Birthday Ben<br/>
2 - be sure to have Duncan have a jacket accessible when he gets up here<br/>
- it&#39;s still being quite chilly in this neck o&#39; the woods, below<br/>
seasonal averages <br/>
3 - Way to go Kelly, you wild woman! (No way you&#39;re getting ME to jump<br/>
out of a perfectly good plane LOL - I need drugs to even get on a plane<br/>
in the first place or you&#39;ll be seeing my lunch...)<br/>

Thats amazing!  Lots of guts and courage.  It sounds like it was a<br/>
wonderful birthday celebration.<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>

CoolCool!<br/>

I&#39;m going to ask you to join the LiveandLearnConference yahoogroup and <br/>
ask there. Pam Laricchia is coming from Toronto, and she would know <br/>
first-hand how that works and can tell you &quot;in Canadian&quot; (what it looks <br/>
like from a Canadian perspective).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure you would just click on &quot;US$&quot; under payment and it <br/>
would convert, but....I&#39;m not positive.<br/>
<br/>
Pam is throwing her own Toronto conference party this weekend and may <br/>
be a bit slammed right now, so she might not respond right away. OH! <br/>
Gillian would know though! But she&#39;s not on this list either, I don&#39;t <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll send them both an email.<br/>
<br/>
But join the conference list anyway! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So cool!<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   Oh, and what about meals for kids under 5?  I found all other prices <br/>
but that.<br/>
Are they free??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Meal plans for children under five are free. Lodging is too---if you <br/>
co-sleep, but it&#39;s snug!<br/>
