<div id="ygrps-yiv-430111661">Ok, thanks guys, you did it again!  As I have only been trying<br/>
unschooling since March, I was very unsure if I understood the concept<br/>
about dealing with my 4 year old.  You helped me realize that I am.<br/>
And restored some confidence in myself. <br/>
<br/>
I am trying my best daily to meet her needs, and not ask her to<br/>
&quot;finish dinner before dessert&quot;  or &quot;pick up her toys, now&quot; and things<br/>
of that nature.  I guess, perhaps because we are changing our styles,<br/>
she is just learning to adjust.  But from your responses, I see that<br/>
she will adjust and that I am doing it &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Pam, I especially like what you said about verbalizing what I am<br/>
thinking when I act.  I think that this will truly help her understand<br/>
that it is natural for everyone to care about others.  Not something<br/>
that I am only asking her to do.  I have passed that info on to<br/>
other&#39;s in my household, so hopefully if we all do it, it will sink in<br/>
that she does not have to fight for what she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again</div>
