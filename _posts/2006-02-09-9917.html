<div id="ygrps-yiv-416604299">I just wanted to share this because I thought it was very <br/>
interesting.  We here often of Japan&#39;s superior education and I have <br/>
even had people throw that in my face in conversations about <br/>
unschooling.  I have been reading this book about a woman who lived <br/>
in Japan for five years and her experiences there.  This is what she <br/>
says about the education of Japanese:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The training Japanese children receive leads to success in <br/>
examinations, and fills their heads with hundreds of thousands of <br/>
facts and fiures.  But, if a Japanese child has to analyze a <br/>
situation, draw conclusions, defend a viewpoint, or even ask <br/>
questions, the inherent wekaness of the Japanese educational system <br/>
becomes apparent.  Japanese schools repress original and creative <br/>
thought.  Spontaneity is a dirty word.  Originality on a child&#39;s <br/>
part will surely bring forth a letter of complaint to its parents, <br/>
and a leading question will be met wiht a raised eyebrow.  Japanese <br/>
children do not know how to analyze facts, and criticism is not <br/>
received favorably, because the teacher is the only one allowed to <br/>
ask quiestions.  Japanese schoolchildren are taught to accumulate <br/>
information formulae, dates, and facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It goes on to talk about conformity and subservience in the school <br/>
system and also their HUGE problem of violence and suicide.<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting from an unschooling point of view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063358519">Yes, Singapore has a similar problem.  Newsweek recently did an article<br/>
about how weak they are in practice even though they are number 1 in<br/>
international tests of math and reading.<br/>

<br/>
Also, The London Times recently ran an article talking about how, although<br/>
on standardized tests, their students scores are rising, in tests of actual<br/>
understanding of basic concepts they are falling FAR behind where they were<br/>
30 years ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551434651">We are big into 4-H and had a Japanese boy (age 12) come live with us for a month this summer through that program.  We really kind of freaked him out.  He had school work that his parents sent with him (he didn&#39;t get much done here)and I would agree that problem solving wasn&#39;t his strong suit.  Even after a month, he cried when he had to leave and of course, we offered for him to come back again this summer.  <br/>
