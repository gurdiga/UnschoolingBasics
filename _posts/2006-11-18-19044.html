Trust your kid. You canot Unschool without trust. Your have to trust that your child will learn to read just as you trusted him to learn to walk or talk on his own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you will find that there are quite a few unschoolers on this<br/>
(and other) lists who did not learn to read until their teen or tween<br/>
years.  Guess what?  They read just find now.  Some have loved reading<br/>
and some read because they need to.  Guess what?  It is no different<br/>
than any other child who was forced to read at an early age.  I taught<br/>
myself to read when I was just 3 yo.  My mom read to me every night<br/>
and I got tired of waiting until the next night to learn what happened<br/>
(we were reading Black Beauty at the time).  So I taught myself.  I&#39;m<br/>
an avid reader.  My brother was forced to learn to read in<br/>
kindergarden and to this day only reads that which he needs to in<br/>
order to get through life.  Some people will read because they love<br/>
it, and other people will read because they need to.  Doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
really when they learn.  I have an uncle who didn&#39;t learn to read<br/>
until he was in his late 20&#39;s.  He is dyslexic and words were just a<br/>
jumble to him and didn&#39;t make sense.  Then he learned some tricks to<br/>
help him read and now he loves reading and while it takes him longer<br/>
to read he loves it.  His sister was a &quot;smarty pants&quot; in school.<br/>
Always did well without trying and she could care less about reading<br/>
even though she can do it well.<br/>
<br/>
Reading isn&#39;t the end all be all of learning.  One can learn A LOT<br/>
without ever picking up a book!  Live with your child, proceed with<br/>
each day as it comes.  You&#39;ve got a great start in beginning when your<br/>
child is so young.  What a boon that many of us didn&#39;t have!<br/>

&gt;I have read a book called &quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; and this family <br/>
&gt;has 4 boys ( 2 adopted) and they all went to Harvard. I remember that one <br/>
&gt;of them did not read until he was over 12yo.<br/>
