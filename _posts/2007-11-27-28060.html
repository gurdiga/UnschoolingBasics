<div id="ygrps-yiv-551327379">Okay, my daughter loves the game Furcadia that I think someone on here<br/>
mentioned, but I am finding that I am really not liking the game.  I sit and<br/>
watch her talking to people (I know, I should be playing with her, but it<br/>
really holds no interest for me) and everytime I do, there is someone being<br/>
rude to her.  A week or so ago, there were all these characters that someone<br/>
or some people made up that looked just like my daughter&#39;s character and had<br/>
VERY similar names (like one letter difference).  There were like 10 just<br/>
like her, following her around being rude to her and others.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was this 17 year old on there today who said he was a murderer<br/>
and he was going to find and kill my daughter.  I typed something to him<br/>
mentioning it a few minutes later and he said he never said that and called<br/>
me a liar.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had similar experience or am I just coming in at the wrong<br/>
moments?  I don&#39;t want to freak out and I certainly don&#39;t want to take this<br/>
game away (and because of previous experience I am sure she thinks that is<br/>
what I am going to do because I expressed my concerns to her about this),<br/>
but how would you handle this?<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>
