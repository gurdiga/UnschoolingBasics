<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532827145">I received a question offlist from a list member about spelling. Below <br/>
is  the reponse I sent her last night. But I woke up this morning <br/>
thinking about her question again and had more to add. I figured I&#39;d <br/>
post it here rather than just back to her.<br/>

*** By the way, I couldn&#39;t take it and told my kids to do spelling <br/>
workbooks.  My oldest bawked.  I&#39;m not sure what to do.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
make sense to me that they will learn to be good spellers by reading <br/>
alone.  What if they don&#39;t like to read? ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My response:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people are naturally good spellers. Some are not---no matter how <br/>
many workbooks they do! Don&#39;t you have any friends that can&#39;t spell <br/>
after 12-16+ years of school?<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself: What would happen if they couldn&#39;t spell?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your worst fear? That they would be thought of as stupid? (It <br/>
matters more what the CHILD thinks than what someone else thinks about <br/>
him!!) That they would use spell-check? That they might find other ways <br/>
to spell?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your fear?<br/>
<br/>
Fear of mom and her thoughts that a child couldn&#39;t spell ----THAT&#39;s a <br/>
much bigger worry for a child. The feeling of incompetence/inadequacy a <br/>
child feels when his mom is pushing something he doesn&#39;t want to learn <br/>
right now---that&#39;s stifling and can shut that chiild down for a long, <br/>
long time. Don&#39;t do that!<br/>
<br/>
Please, accept each child as He Is and know that, when he&#39;s ready, <br/>
he&#39;ll pick up what&#39;s important to him. It may never be important to <br/>
spell. It IS important to be loved by your mom for Who You Are! THAT <br/>
can&#39;t wait!<br/>
<br/>
The fastest way to turn a child off from reading and from <br/>
spelling/math/gardening/fly-fishing is to push/force/require it. Quit <br/>
forcing. Read TO them. Listen to books-on-CD. Spell things FOR them <br/>
when they ask. Be their partner, not their adversary!<br/>
<br/>
Reading doesn&#39;t *make* good spellers, but it can make it easier...make <br/>
words more familiar.<br/>
<br/>
Those that don&#39;t *like* to read will proabably still read, but for <br/>
information, not for pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll all learn when it&#39;s important to THEM!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My addition here:<br/>
<br/>
I was at a party a few weeks ago. I would up talking about...duh! <br/>
*unschooling*! &lt;g&gt; with my husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband.<br/>
<br/>
He was insisting that there were things *everyone* needed to <br/>
know---&quot;core&quot; knowledge, if you will. I asked him to name ONE. ONE <br/>
thing that *everyone* needed to know. I then refilled my plate, got <br/>
another drink, and sat back to enjoy the show. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
His first answer was....you guessed it...spelling!<br/>
<br/>
What a stupid answer. Stupid if he wanted to defend it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I reminded him that PLENTY of people can&#39;t spell---even after years and <br/>
years of wookbooks and spelling tests.<br/>
<br/>
Give me another---a better---thing that we ALL *must* know.<br/>
<br/>
Reading.<br/>
<br/>
Dope!<br/>
<br/>
I reminded him that blind people don&#39;t read. Not in the traditional <br/>
sense. *But* that there are books-on-CD and friends that will read to <br/>
them. They can learn braille instead. But not *everyone* needs to know <br/>
how  to read.<br/>
<br/>
Then he *knew* he had me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Communication!<br/>
<br/>
We *all* need to communicate. We *must* be taught how to do that. We <br/>
must! It&#39;s a necessary part of living. If we can&#39;t communicate, the <br/>
world will go to hell in a handbasket. Yes! Yes! Communication!<br/>
<br/>
And he sat back, satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re BORN communicating! A baby&#39;s cries are a form of communication. <br/>
That&#39;s not something we must be taught! We learn as we go that crying <br/>
is not the best way to communicate our needs. Pointing and grunting are <br/>
better. Then talking. Sometimes we go so far as to LIE to get what we <br/>
want! I think lying is a very evolved form of communication. And some <br/>
children figure out *that* so easily... And boy, can it be effective!<br/>
<br/>
We can communicate with our hands (like the deaf. Sign <br/>
language---wow!). With our facial expressions (many actors are great at <br/>
this!). We can communicate in writing---in cyberspace even! In foreign <br/>
languages. In music. In art. Math is a form of communcation. Touch can <br/>
communicate a LOT. Animals can even communicate with us: Basia and <br/>
SodaPop woke me up at 5:59 this morning asking to be let out and fed!<br/>
<br/>
Now, generally, I try to gear my rants &lt;g&gt; to my audience. And although <br/>
I knew he was military (he&#39;s a retired colonel in the Air Force) and <br/>
*probably* conservative, I couldn&#39;t be sure of his politics, so I <br/>
didn&#39;t bring up that his own *president*---the highest office holder in <br/>
the US and leader of the free world..........is ....um......not the <br/>
best communicator. (I would have phrased it differently had I known for <br/>
sure whether he was a democrat or a republican. Since I didn&#39;t know, I <br/>
just left it out.) But obviously, his lack of communication skills did <br/>
NOT hurt his ability to get elected. Obviously, GOOD communication is <br/>
not a requirement for serving as president.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very important to ask ourselves what it is that we fear <br/>
will  happen if our children don&#39;t excel at ________.<br/>
<br/>
What if he&#39;s NOT a good speller?<br/>
What if she CAN&#39;T do long division?<br/>
What if he NEVER learns to cook?<br/>
What if she decides NOT to learn to drive.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the *worst* that could happen? Really? The WORST thing?<br/>
<br/>
Now, first, how bad IS that exactly?<br/>
Second---chances are that it will never come to that!<br/>
<br/>
A person who is a really bad speller probably won&#39;t write for a living. <br/>
If he does, he will use spell-check, have a friend to ask, or hire an <br/>
editor.<br/>
<br/>
If she can&#39;t do long division, she probably won&#39;t become an accountant <br/>
or statistics professor. But she can barter with a friend to help her <br/>
with her taxes, buy a calculator, or hire a bookkeeper.<br/>
<br/>
If he hates to cook, I doubt he will become a master chef. But he could <br/>
marry one. Or eat out. Or learn to love Ramen noodles.<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t want to drive, she can live in a city with really good <br/>
public transportation, call a cab, walk a lot, or ride a bike. (She <br/>
might come out a lot better financially than her driving cousins!!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Adults DO what they&#39;re good at and find ways around what they struggle <br/>
with/don&#39;t like/aren&#39;t good at.<br/>
<br/>
Well, *smart* adults do.<br/>
<br/>
The ones who have learned that they are incompetent or dumb or <br/>
inadequate---the ones whose moms and teachers have insisted that they <br/>
learn something that is unimportant or irrelevant in their own <br/>
lives----well, those people are the ones that find learning hard or <br/>
sucky or stupid. They&#39;re the ones that shut down or or rebel or are <br/>
simply unhappy and unfulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Learning is a natural part of living. We are hard-wired to learn. <br/>
Certainly not everything all at the same time. But each one of us will <br/>
learn what we need *when* we need it. That&#39;s HOW humans learn. Not <br/>
*everyone* will be a great speller or physicist or gardener. NONE of us <br/>
*has* to. Each of us will make his own way---no matter how much our <br/>
mom---or our husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband &lt;g&gt;---thinks we *need* to know <br/>
how to spell. When it becomes important, we will *make* it important, <br/>
and it will BE important---to *us*. Until then, it&#39;s just superfluous <br/>
and something someone *else* thinks is important.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing everyone needs to know. Content yourself with that. <br/>
Each person has his own set of talents---that might not be (and <br/>
probably aren&#39;t) *your* set of talents. Each person should have the <br/>
right to pursue those talents/passions to their logical ends--or new <br/>
begginings.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll make for a happier household AND a more joyful world!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600922114">Just going to be honest with myself and say &#39;yes&#39;, what I&#39;m worried<br/>
about is that OTHERS will think my children are &#39;stupid&#39;.  If the<br/>
world were a bigger better nicer place then it wouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
concern...HOWEVER, we still are not doing spelling tests.  My children<br/>
ask me how to spell something when they have trouble and I happily let<br/>
them know and also, yesterday, my 8yo dd wrote somethings on a grocery<br/>
list and put:  fruit ingreedeints....I personally think that her<br/>
spelling of &#39;ingredients&#39; is more in line with how the damn word his<br/>
pronounced in the first place.  I told her that I liked her spelling<br/>
and she&#39;s like &quot;Yeah, it really doesn&#39;t make any sense how it&#39;s<br/>
spelled like the way everyone says that it should be spelled.&quot;  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250445537">I had a high school professor who was a brilliant guy, it just shone out of<br/>
him and dripped out of his every word, whether he was giving a lecture or<br/>
telling a joke.  He couldn&#39;t spell for the life of him and was constantly<br/>
misspelling things on the chalkboard.  He was sort of abashed and<br/>
self-deprecating about it and his pupils tended to take a nurturing attitude<br/>
toward him.  I don&#39;t recall anyone ever making fun of him or trying to<br/>
embarass him, even though we pointed out his misspellings on a daily basis<br/>
and he often asked us how things were spelled as he wrote them on the<br/>
chalkboard.  At the end of the day, everyone just loved him for who he was.<br/>
He was one of the most popular professors because he was kind and funny and<br/>
brilliant.  Whether or not he cold spell was beside the point.  Poor<br/>
spelling ability has nothing to do with intelligence, and, in my opinion, at<br/>
least, there are other qualities and skills that are far more important if<br/>
we want a meaningful and rewarding life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Or work with a bunch of equally poor spellers.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a police officer and writes a report after every call he goes <br/>
on.  He is probably the worst adult speller I&#39;ve known and he knows nothing <br/>
about grammar or proper use of the English language.  He refuses to use the spell <br/>
check even thought I mention it everyday. I proofread his reports daily and <br/>
am shocked that his department finds them acceptable.  Many of his coworkers <br/>
have the same problem.  My husband took a spelling class for two semesters a few <br/>
years ago and it helped but not much.  Spelling for him just will not <br/>
compute!  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest fear about my children not being good spellers is that others will <br/>
think they&#39;re idiots when reading something they wrote.  The reality is that <br/>
some of our kids probably have the poor spelling gene already so what can we <br/>
really do about it?  Live and enjoy their poor spelling and every other <br/>
wonderful thing about them.  Hope they are happy people and can communicate <br/>
effectively.  They already can, what a relief!<br/>
<br/>
If we tested adults who were trained in school and had been exposed to/taught <br/>
the core components your hubby&#39;s boss considers important I&#39;m sure the <br/>
majority would fail.  I don&#39;t think anyone in my husband&#39;s department can use a <br/>
semicolon correctly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131367671">&quot;A person who is a really bad speller probably won&#39;t write for a<br/>
living. If he does, he will use spell-check, have a friend to ask, or<br/>
hire an editor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely!<br/>
Trevor (16) spells and writes very well, without being &quot;taught&quot; or<br/>
pushed.  When I DID push him, around 6-9 years old, he didn&#39;t pick up<br/>
a bit of it. In fact, he shut down to writing completely. Around<br/>
12-13, after being left alone about it for a few years, he could<br/>
suddenly do it all well.<br/>
His brain is really great at picking up patterns. Spelling is just<br/>
patterns, some people see them easily while others do not. A bunch of<br/>
tests and practice and stress aren&#39;t going to make good spellers. <br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;good&quot; spelling anyway? Language is evolving. The correct<br/>
spelling today will probably be different in another generation. The<br/>
idea of a correct way to spell is relatively new in the scope of history.<br/>
<br/>
My bil (who is visiting right now) is not the best speller. He can<br/>
pull a 6 figure income though! I guess lack of spelling skills haven&#39;t<br/>
hurt him in the work world in any sense.:)<br/>
<br/>
And he knew a word my sis didn&#39;t know the other night...&quot;eschelon&quot;.<br/>
He used it in a conversation and she looked at him funny and<br/>
questioned his use of the word. He gave her a definition and she still<br/>
didn&#39;t believe him. They looked it up, and sure enough, he was RIGHT.<br/>
Next night the word was used in a television show and my sister really<br/>
NOTICED it.<br/>
Connections, connections.<br/>
She learned a new vocabulary word from a guy that spells poorly.<br/>
That&#39;s real life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680351534">&quot;By the way, I couldn&#39;t take it and told my kids to do spelling<br/>
workbooks.  My oldest bawked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A parent who is worried about her children&#39;s spelling, might want to<br/>
learn the word is &quot;balked&quot; not &quot;bawked&quot; (what a chicken does).:)<br/>
The word &quot;bawked&quot; would fall under onomatopoeia, which means a word<br/>
that describes a sound. I&#39;m picturing a mother trying to force<br/>
spelling workbooks (YUCKY! Humans don&#39;t really learn much from<br/>
workbooks btw, they were created for review, NOT learning) and a child<br/>
jumping up and acting like a chicken shouting &quot;bawk, bawk, bawk&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m having fun here. But it amuses me that parents usually tend to<br/>
focus their own perceived &quot;weaknesses&quot; as something to teach their<br/>
children. I think their &quot;weakness&quot; made their lives difficult in<br/>
school perhaps and now they want to make sure their children don&#39;t<br/>
suffer. I remember worrying so much over math (my own perceived<br/>
weakness at one time) and now we USE numbers and addition and such in<br/>
every day life and I wonder how on earth it ever worried me!:)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about embracing the person for exactly who they ARE,<br/>
not who we want them to be. Unschooling is about CELEBRATING each<br/>
unique individual and focusing on their beauty and strength.<br/>
Focusing on perceived weaknesses does not help it become a strength.<br/>
And that which we view as a &quot;weakness&quot; may very well NOT be such.<br/>
<br/>
Perception is reality for us.<br/>
Change your perception of your children. Change your perception of<br/>
what real learning looks like. Change your perception of this day, and<br/>
this very moment so that you can find the JOY in it. Then unschooling<br/>
will begin to blossom in your lives and school/tests/grades/subjects<br/>
will be forgotten in the swirl of activity that is REAL life.</div>

&gt; alone.  What if they don&#39;t like to read? ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then they most likely won&#39;t like to write either and will be in doing things<br/>
in life where they don&#39;t need to write.  I believe that you CAN learn to<br/>
spell just from reading (and you would be surprised at the amount of reading<br/>
that a person does in just one day - street signs, business signs, signs at<br/>
banks, menus, utility bills, SALE! (sorry, just had to add that one),<br/>
directions for use of sunscreen, www.whatever.com, video games, recipes,<br/>
etc.)  And as Kelly said there is always a spell check.  I have one in my<br/>
google toolbar that will spell check forms that I fill out online (including<br/>
online community forums and e-mail) and while I believe that I am a good<br/>
speller, I also type very fast and miss mistakes.  :)  (Making mental note<br/>
to use spell check before I send this message!)<br/>
<br/>
Dan is a verocious reader.  He can &quot;get lost&quot; in a book for hours.  He&#39;s<br/>
been known to stay up all night because he got interested in a book.  Yet he<br/>
still will call me from work and say, &quot;How do you spell precedence?&quot;  Some<br/>
days he will call me several times.  It&#39;s sort of funny because now I answer<br/>
him like a spelling bee.  He still uses spell check but it is that fear of<br/>
being wrong (that was ingrained in him from childhood.)  And his boss (who<br/>
makes twice as much money as he does) is a horrible speller (he is also a<br/>
horrible grammarian in general!)  So despite what the schools try to tell<br/>
you grammar and spelling is not what is going to cut you out of the market!<br/>

ass about history, she only cares about animals; not wars, not dates,<br/>
not presidents, not even when it&#39;s on the tube and the entire family<br/>
is watching.  Your going up north in a couple of weeks and her 8yo<br/>
cousin is going to *know* some history and your daughter had to ask<br/>
who Columbus was while playing Family Feud online the other day.&quot;  I<br/>

to set in BUT I WILL NOT LET IT RUIN THE BEAUTY THAT UNSCHOOLING HAS<br/>

to know history right now, and I probably shouldn&#39;t even have it in my<br/>
mind as if it is something that she &#39;must&#39; care about ever.  She&#39;d<br/>
rather focus on animals which is both very fun and serious to her<br/>
(i.e. endangered animals, zoos, etc.)  Besides, she is a good person<br/>

doing. :-) I have no interest in space really....but she does and she <br/>
is totally self-taught. <br/>
<br/>
So now your daughter knows who Columbus is because she needed to know. <br/>
That&#39;s very cool! <br/>
Just like now I know that Jupiter is the largest planet. <br/>

What if he&#39;s NOT a good speller?<br/>
What if she CAN&#39;T do long division?<br/>

What if she decides NOT to learn to drive<br/>
<br/>
... hahahahahahahaha.... I know how to drive but all the other things, well,<br/>
I&#39;m not a good speller (heck it was the first class I got a C in in PS... it<br/>
was in the 3rd grade.  thank God for spell check!) and I can&#39;t do long<br/>
division (I&#39;m afraid my brain might bake right there in my head if I had to<br/>
make myself remember how to do it!  it sucks!) and I HATE to cook (but my<br/>
husband LOVES it and does a wonderful job at it)!  hahahahahahaha.... and I<br/>
have 13 years in the Public School system.  And what I do LOVE to do wasn&#39;t<br/>
taught to me in those 13 years! <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    I received a question offlist from a list member about spelling. Below <br/>
  is  the reponse I sent her last night. But I woke up this morning <br/>
  thinking about her question again and had more to add. I figured I&#39;d <br/>
  post it here rather than just back to her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -----Original Message-----<br/>
<br/>
  *** By the way, I couldn&#39;t take it and told my kids to do spelling <br/>
  workbooks.  My oldest bawked.  I&#39;m not sure what to do.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
  make sense to me that they will learn to be good spellers by reading <br/>
  alone.  What if they don&#39;t like to read? ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My response:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Some people are naturally good spellers. Some are not---no matter how <br/>
  many workbooks they do! Don&#39;t you have any friends that can&#39;t spell <br/>
  after 12-16+ years of school?<br/>
<br/>
  Ask yourself: What would happen if they couldn&#39;t spell?<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s your worst fear? That they would be thought of as stupid? (It <br/>
  matters more what the CHILD thinks than what someone else thinks about <br/>
  him!!) That they would use spell-check? That they might find other ways <br/>
  to spell?<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s your fear?<br/>
<br/>
  Fear of mom and her thoughts that a child couldn&#39;t spell ----THAT&#39;s a <br/>
  much bigger worry for a child. The feeling of incompetence/inadequacy a <br/>
  child feels when his mom is pushing something he doesn&#39;t want to learn <br/>
  right now---that&#39;s stifling and can shut that chiild down for a long, <br/>
  long time. Don&#39;t do that!<br/>
<br/>
  Please, accept each child as He Is and know that, when he&#39;s ready, <br/>
  he&#39;ll pick up what&#39;s important to him. It may never be important to <br/>
  spell. It IS important to be loved by your mom for Who You Are! THAT <br/>
  can&#39;t wait!<br/>
<br/>
  The fastest way to turn a child off from reading and from <br/>
  spelling/math/gardening/fly-fishing is to push/force/require it. Quit <br/>
  forcing. Read TO them. Listen to books-on-CD. Spell things FOR them <br/>
  when they ask. Be their partner, not their adversary!<br/>
<br/>
  Reading doesn&#39;t *make* good spellers, but it can make it easier...make <br/>
  words more familiar.<br/>
<br/>
  Those that don&#39;t *like* to read will proabably still read, but for <br/>
  information, not for pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
  They&#39;ll all learn when it&#39;s important to THEM!<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  My addition here:<br/>
<br/>
  I was at a party a few weeks ago. I would up talking about...duh! <br/>
  *unschooling*! &lt;g&gt; with my husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband.<br/>
<br/>
  He was insisting that there were things *everyone* needed to <br/>
  know---&quot;core&quot; knowledge, if you will. I asked him to name ONE. ONE <br/>
  thing that *everyone* needed to know. I then refilled my plate, got <br/>
  another drink, and sat back to enjoy the show. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  His first answer was....you guessed it...spelling!<br/>
<br/>
  What a stupid answer. Stupid if he wanted to defend it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I reminded him that PLENTY of people can&#39;t spell---even after years and <br/>
  years of wookbooks and spelling tests.<br/>
<br/>
  Give me another---a better---thing that we ALL *must* know.<br/>
<br/>
  Reading.<br/>
<br/>
  Dope!<br/>
<br/>
  I reminded him that blind people don&#39;t read. Not in the traditional <br/>
  sense. *But* that there are books-on-CD and friends that will read to <br/>
  them. They can learn braille instead. But not *everyone* needs to know <br/>
  how  to read.<br/>
<br/>
  Then he *knew* he had me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Communication!<br/>
<br/>
  We *all* need to communicate. We *must* be taught how to do that. We <br/>
  must! It&#39;s a necessary part of living. If we can&#39;t communicate, the <br/>
  world will go to hell in a handbasket. Yes! Yes! Communication!<br/>
<br/>
  And he sat back, satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;re BORN communicating! A baby&#39;s cries are a form of communication. <br/>
  That&#39;s not something we must be taught! We learn as we go that crying <br/>
  is not the best way to communicate our needs. Pointing and grunting are <br/>
  better. Then talking. Sometimes we go so far as to LIE to get what we <br/>
  want! I think lying is a very evolved form of communication. And some <br/>
  children figure out *that* so easily... And boy, can it be effective!<br/>
<br/>
  We can communicate with our hands (like the deaf. Sign <br/>
  language---wow!). With our facial expressions (many actors are great at <br/>
  this!). We can communicate in writing---in cyberspace even! In foreign <br/>
  languages. In music. In art. Math is a form of communcation. Touch can <br/>
  communicate a LOT. Animals can even communicate with us: Basia and <br/>
  SodaPop woke me up at 5:59 this morning asking to be let out and fed!<br/>
<br/>
  Now, generally, I try to gear my rants &lt;g&gt; to my audience. And although <br/>
  I knew he was military (he&#39;s a retired colonel in the Air Force) and <br/>
  *probably* conservative, I couldn&#39;t be sure of his politics, so I <br/>
  didn&#39;t bring up that his own *president*---the highest office holder in <br/>
  the US and leader of the free world..........is ....um......not the <br/>
  best communicator. (I would have phrased it differently had I known for <br/>
  sure whether he was a democrat or a republican. Since I didn&#39;t know, I <br/>
  just left it out.) But obviously, his lack of communication skills did <br/>
  NOT hurt his ability to get elected. Obviously, GOOD communication is <br/>
  not a requirement for serving as president.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think it&#39;s very important to ask ourselves what it is that we fear <br/>
  will  happen if our children don&#39;t excel at ________.<br/>
<br/>
  What if he&#39;s NOT a good speller?<br/>
  What if she CAN&#39;T do long division?<br/>
  What if he NEVER learns to cook?<br/>
  What if she decides NOT to learn to drive.<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s the *worst* that could happen? Really? The WORST thing?<br/>
<br/>
  Now, first, how bad IS that exactly?<br/>
  Second---chances are that it will never come to that!<br/>
<br/>
  A person who is a really bad speller probably won&#39;t write for a living. <br/>
  If he does, he will use spell-check, have a friend to ask, or hire an <br/>
  editor.<br/>
<br/>
  If she can&#39;t do long division, she probably won&#39;t become an accountant <br/>
  or statistics professor. But she can barter with a friend to help her <br/>
  with her taxes, buy a calculator, or hire a bookkeeper.<br/>
<br/>
  If he hates to cook, I doubt he will become a master chef. But he could <br/>
  marry one. Or eat out. Or learn to love Ramen noodles.<br/>
<br/>
  If she doesn&#39;t want to drive, she can live in a city with really good <br/>
  public transportation, call a cab, walk a lot, or ride a bike. (She <br/>
  might come out a lot better financially than her driving cousins!!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Adults DO what they&#39;re good at and find ways around what they struggle <br/>
  with/don&#39;t like/aren&#39;t good at.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, *smart* adults do.<br/>
<br/>
  The ones who have learned that they are incompetent or dumb or <br/>
  inadequate---the ones whose moms and teachers have insisted that they <br/>
  learn something that is unimportant or irrelevant in their own <br/>
  lives----well, those people are the ones that find learning hard or <br/>
  sucky or stupid. They&#39;re the ones that shut down or or rebel or are <br/>
  simply unhappy and unfulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Learning is a natural part of living. We are hard-wired to learn. <br/>
  Certainly not everything all at the same time. But each one of us will <br/>
  learn what we need *when* we need it. That&#39;s HOW humans learn. Not <br/>
  *everyone* will be a great speller or physicist or gardener. NONE of us <br/>
  *has* to. Each of us will make his own way---no matter how much our <br/>
  mom---or our husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband &lt;g&gt;---thinks we *need* to know <br/>
  how to spell. When it becomes important, we will *make* it important, <br/>
  and it will BE important---to *us*. Until then, it&#39;s just superfluous <br/>
  and something someone *else* thinks is important.<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s nothing everyone needs to know. Content yourself with that. <br/>
  Each person has his own set of talents---that might not be (and <br/>
  probably aren&#39;t) *your* set of talents. Each person should have the <br/>
  right to pursue those talents/passions to their logical ends--or new <br/>
  begginings.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;ll make for a happier household AND a more joyful world!<br/>
