<div id="ygrps-yiv-95719824">I wonder if anyone here has any experience to offer re:relactation. My <br/>
milk has dried up. I&#39;ve heard that Moms can restart their milk even <br/>
without pregnancy, I just don&#39;t know how. Our infant (preemie) son <br/>
weaned himself because my milk production was frustratingly low, as was <br/>
his endurance with suckling. I hoped to hang on to some of my milk <br/>
production until he was older and had better sucking power, but it&#39;s <br/>
gone. He&#39;s not interested either, but I just feel that if I can get my <br/>
milk back, maybe he will start again. He&#39;s 9 months now (supposed to be <br/>
6 months, was born at 26 wks gestation), and the time feel right to <br/>
pursue this. <br/>
FYI, I breastfed my 1st son for 2+yrs(consistently), followed by <br/>
intermittent breastfeeding until now. I hope this helps my case in <br/>
retrieving my milk production. <br/>
Thanks for any feedback, I am up for trying most anything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436641552">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Here in Canada we have a great breastfeeding expert and advocate Dr. <br/>
Jack Newman. He has a great website  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/index.php">http://www.drjacknewman.com/index.php</a><br/>
There is a whole section on induced lactation <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=79&Itemid=107">http://www.drjacknewman.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=79&Itemid=107</a><br/>
You can email him and he usually replies within hours. Edith <br/>
Kernerman works with him and is also fantastic.<br/>
There are suggestions for herbs and safe drugs that contribute to <br/>
relactation i.e. domperidone, in addition to advice on how often to <br/>
nurse, breast compression etc. There are lots of video clips too. He <br/>
has helped work miracles for so many people I know, including myself. <br/>
Adoptive moms can even have success with these methods.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up hope!<br/>

Yes, Ma&#39;am! :) <br/>
 <br/>
Let me send links first, see what you think, and feel free to contact me,  k?<br/>

will take you many other places, including La Leche League  links and such. <br/>
 <br/>
There are also herbs and medical drugs you can take to get milk going, but  <br/>
the all time best is the baby sucking. LOTS of skin to skin, bathing together,  <br/>
and any time that he is willing to nuzzle at the breast will help support the <br/>
 needed hormones (oxytocin and prolactin). Once he can latch again, a SNS  <br/>
(Supplemental Nursing System) would be an EXCELLENT idea, as it&#39;s a bag that  <br/>
rests between your breasts with formula, and has tubes that you tape to your  <br/>
nipple - latching AND the formula at the same time..a great way to increase  <br/>
supply while using formula to feed him :) <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m here for any questions you may have, and if I don&#39;t know the answer, I  <br/>
know where to direct you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526120861">Lisa, you ask:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
�I wonder if anyone here has any experience to offer re: relactation.�<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have. I adopted a baby in 1969, about 3 months after my<br/>
son had weaned. I supplemented using a medicine dropper in the corner of her mouth.<br/>
At that time there was no Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) and Jimmie Avery<br/>
was just developing the Lact-Aid although I didn�t know about it at the time. I<br/>
found the medicine dropper very easy to use. I just refilled fast while she was<br/>
nursing vigorously and slowed down as she slowed down. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the history you give I�m sure that your<br/>
breasts have not involuted to a non-lactating state even though they aren�t<br/>
producing much now. I expect that you will re-establish a good supply fairly<br/>
quickly once you get the little guy nursing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You�ve received some excellent recommendations and I just<br/>
want to add my reassurance that it can be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Ah! I never had a nickname as &quot;Karen&quot; and I sometimes now go my screen name  <br/>
of &quot;Kidgie&quot; but in &quot;real life&quot; lol...only on message boards, where I actually  <br/>
have other screen names...ok, that probably made little sense ;) <br/>
 <br/>
Wow. Ren. Or, &#39;Ren lol...any chance you&#39;re middle name is Lynn ;) ?!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, Ren. This list has been GREAT for me. All of you folks are helping  <br/>
me REALLY understand critical thinking. The best birthday gift yet! <br/>
