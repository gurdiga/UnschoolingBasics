I try to choose my words wisely and keep my mouth <br/>
shut more than I&#39;ve been used to in the past.  <br/>

So often, imo, this is the right answer. :)<br/>
<br/>
Not volunteering at the ps sounds right to me too. If it doesn&#39;t fit, you <br/>
must quit?<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, in some sort crazed moment, I talked to the Boys & Girls Club near me <br/>
about volunteering as a reading tutor. There is no way I will have time to <br/>
actually do this -- I got home with the form to fill out and haven&#39;t even had time <br/>
to do that much. :) <br/>
<br/>
But, aside from my temporary insanity, I did one thing right I think. I <br/>
mentioned right away that we are hsers. That my hours are flexible. (This was <br/>
before I realized that they may be flexible but I don&#39;t have enough of them.) The <br/>
G&B lady was very nice but said these are kids who are in ps so they need vols <br/>
during the after school hours. 3:00 and on. <br/>
<br/>
My job is not to change them or their schedule but to fit myself into their <br/>
world -- imo -- if I ever (when the kids are older?) am able to vol there. <br/>
<br/>
And I won&#39;t expect to have conversations about learning and hsing and <br/>
unschooling -- or to make friends with the Moms or B&G staff. If it happens, it <br/>
happens. But I would go into it knowing that there is a huge difference between our <br/>
chosen lifestyles.<br/>
<br/>
And, imo, don&#39;t let the pushy playground lady upset you -- tell her off and <br/>
get back to having fun. Take her aside if you need to. But don&#39;t let her get <br/>
you down. Don&#39;t expect to change her either. Her unhappiness is not your problem <br/>
though. When we have met people like this, my kids and I have had nice <br/>
conversations on the way home about how certain people need to have sticks removed <br/>
from . . . well, you get the idea. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I don&#39;t like rudeness and when someone else&#39;s kid is disturbing us, I <br/>
let the kid know. (No, I don&#39;t think your son was rude -- just not aware of the <br/>
etiquette perhaps and excited.) And if the parent is sitting right there -- <br/>
well, they get to see me explain to their child how running and yelling in the <br/>
middle of someone else&#39;s time to be heard or have quiet is not acceptable <br/>
(This usually starts out with me saying: &quot;I&#39;m not shushing you just to be mean. <br/>
There is a reason. And the reason is . . .&quot; ). So then I am the mean Mom and the <br/>
other parent can go home all upset with me. Sigh. . .<br/>
