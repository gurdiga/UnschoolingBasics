<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979140433"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Can you be more specific about the parts that are causing stress?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it&#39;s the trying to figure out what to get the long list of people. <br/>
For my family it&#39;s the ping pong traveling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We<br/>
&gt;love a big Christmas celebration here, but we&#39;ve brought &quot;chosen<br/>
&gt;family&quot; in for celebrating with as our extended family is far away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have done Christmas morning at home as a rule for many years with just my <br/>
mother and her husband.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you start earlier in the year?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried to start this week. But the list is SO long!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We also try to purchase things our<br/>
&gt;kids want all year, but there are still items we get at Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids all have birthdays close to Christmas, so I like giving them bigger <br/>
gifts that they have to wait on then.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Something we&#39;ve done with extended family is a name drawing. That way<br/>
&gt;you can focus on purchasing one nicer gift for the person you draw,<br/>
&gt;rather than something smaller for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s between my sisters and I. Last year we drew a family name and the<br/>
&gt;idea was a gift the whole family could enjoy (games, food etc..). I<br/>
&gt;really like to just have the cousins draw a name and do it that way,<br/>
&gt;it changes every year.:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do some name drawing between all the divorces and remarriages, we have <br/>
lots of &quot;Christmas&quot; gathering near Christmas. It&#39;s difficult because I am <br/>
one of 11 kids, 19 nieces and nephews.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I am just going to have to change my attitude to some degree. I&#39;m <br/>
down right pissy about it right now.<br/>
