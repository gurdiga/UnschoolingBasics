I have a 7-year old daughter who is really excited about writing and receiving letters, and she really wants a few penpals.  She told me that she doesn&#39;t care if her penpals are boys or girls, and she&#39;s not too worried about ages either, but she would like to connect with a few other unschoolers.  I told her that this is an international list and she thought that was really cool.  <br/>
<br/>
A little bit about my daughter: We live in Fort Collins Colorado (USA), near the mountains (and the plains, I suppose, but we never go that direction!).  My daughter loves unicorns and all things magical, horses,  drawing, painting, swimming, riding her bike, watching movies, skiing, camping and backpacking.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have a child who is interested in being her penpal, please contact me offlist (reply to sender) and we can exchange personal information.  Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736303382">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Alison ~ The FB thing looks cool.  Thanks!  I did &quot;sign&quot; us up to be part of it, however, my boys (and I&#39;d) would prefer it if they worked on their writing skills and wrote back and forth to someone.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys are interested in penpals too.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 10 year old who likes Harry Potter, the outdoors, Legos, bike riding, tractors, &quot;inventing&quot;, cooking, gardening, and arts and crafts.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old likes Legos, the outdoors, all animals, tractors, movies, cooking, &quot;inventing&quot;, looking at and reading books, and playing.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t care if you are a boy or girl or where you live.  They just want to write someone around their age with some of the same interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please &quot;reply to sender&quot; me for address info.   Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do they want to work on their writing skills?<br/>
<br/>
Why do they feel like their &quot;writing skills&quot; need improved? Who is setting a bar between good enough and not good enough? And why?<br/>
<br/>
Where did they even get the idea of  needing &quot;writing skills&quot;? Why is the need to write to someone coming after a need to work on the skill of writing? That&#39;s backwards.<br/>
<br/>
In real life the skill of writing isn&#39;t separate from the need to communicate with someone. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tagging on to what Joyce wrote.<br/>
&quot;Writing skills&quot; aren&#39;t even one thing - even in the schoolish sense the phrase could apply to penmanship, spelling, grammar, or style - and style will vary considerably depending on the reason one is writing. For that matter, so will grammar! <br/>
<br/>
My daughter does a fair amount of writing. Sometimes she&#39;ll ask me to read over what she writes because she wants to share something with me, other times she wants input because she&#39;s planning on other people seeing it - a sign, a card, a game walkthrough, a comic strip or story. All of those take a different kind of writing - she knows that, no-one needed to teach her what kind of style one uses for a game walkthrough versus a comic strip, and she didn&#39;t need to &quot;work on&quot; those skills in the sense of inventing reasons to write. She has reasons to write - and because the Reasons are important to her, she cares about the results. If she&#39;s writing for someone else then she wants to be understood - and because of that, sometimes she&#39;ll ask me for feedback: how is this? does the writing do what it&#39;s intended to do? And then I can point out things like punctuation and spacing, talk about fonts and pitch, let her know the spell checker doesn&#39;t catch mistakes like witch/which or their/there/they&#39;re.<br/>
<br/>
But she doesn&#39;t think of any of that as &quot;working on writing skills&quot; - she&#39;s writing, really writing for real reasons of her own - and like other writers she cares about her potential readers. Skills grow out of that care. <br/>
