 </span></blockquote>When I read this when it was first posted, I had to laugh: we had a<br/>
(childless) friend say the same thing to us back when Matt was 3 and we<br/>
cancelled a dinner outing.  &quot;You can&#39;t let a three year old dictate what you<br/>
do,&quot; the friend said, very knowingly.  &quot;They have to learn how to behave in<br/>
public!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, right.at three.  Well, we cancelled that dinner, and what do you know?<br/>
Matt has grown up to be quite civilized nonetheless.  They are toddlers for<br/>
only a very few minutes (in the scheme of things), and that is not the time<br/>
for grown-up dinners and sophisticated gatherings.  There will be plenty of<br/>
time for those things (if you choose) later on, but not now...not today.  We<br/>
arranged our life around our child&#39;s needs (still do), and that hasn&#39;t<br/>
spoiled him, that has made him a secure child whose needs have been/are<br/>
being met.  <br/>
<br/>
People act like today is permanent; will they never learn?  Just because<br/>
your social life is limited today doesn&#39;t mean it always will be!<br/>
