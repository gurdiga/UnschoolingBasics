<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775191650">My dh was diagnosed dyslexic in school and still doesn&#39;t read well or enjoy reading inspite of specialized &quot;training&quot; (can you hear the scorn in my voice??).  All the &quot;training&quot; did was help him feel dumb.  The thing that finally is working (a tip from an unschoolers dh) is for him to simply place a red ruler under the line he&#39;s reading.  There is documented science behind this method that requires no &quot;training&quot;.  Lots comes up when you google this topic.  Perhaps share some personal experiences with her?  I don&#39;t have much love left in me for &quot;experts&quot;.  The foundation of unschooling to me is that we are each our own expert.  Just my two cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70064729">I don&#39;t know how much help I can be but it wasn&#39;t until my ds was <br/>
about 15 that we realized he had what others called &quot;dyslexia&quot;. He <br/>
was labeling boxes for a friend who was moving and wrote every single <br/>
number down as a mirror image!! I was floored. I had never made him <br/>
write much (he did a lot on the computer though) and just saw a few <br/>
times when things were reversed and didn&#39;t worry about it. I laughed, <br/>
told him &quot;you probably are dyslexic!&quot; and that was it. He went on to <br/>
get a very high GPA in college - took about 30 credit hours in <br/>
various subjects and is now taking a break from college. We never did <br/>
a thing and he&#39;s managing just fine. I don&#39;t know if that helps or <br/>
not! I have a feeling my ten yodd has dyslexia also. She always reads <br/>
words &quot;backwards&quot; and we just either ignore it or ask her to &quot;look <br/>
again&quot; if we all laugh and she wonders why. She sometimes reads <br/>
phrases backwards. I figure she&#39;ll figure it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496290563">I said it wasn&#39;t unschooly.  However are you suggesting that kids<br/>
aren&#39;t ever made to do anything?  My 3 yr old would rather not have<br/>
her diaper changed.  Should I let it be full of poop because she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to have it changed?  She doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>
nasty inner ear infection...should I say &quot;Oh hell, whatever...if she<br/>
wants the meds she&#39;ll ask?&quot;  Meanwhile she&#39;s suffering tremendous pain<br/>
and fevers and her ear drum could perforate.  What&#39;s more important?<br/>
Health and safety or choosing everything?  It&#39;s one thing to say a 15<br/>
yr old can play as much WOW as they want and it&#39;s quite another to<br/>
suggest that a child with CP not be stretched or a child with CF not<br/>
have her lungs drained because they would rather not.  One is no big<br/>
deal, the other is life altering or death inducing.  Where do you draw<br/>
the line?<br/>
<br/>
I think my neighbors want their daughter to be as functional as she<br/>
can be so that as an adult she can be as functional as she can be.<br/>
Are you suggesting they just leave her to seize up and say &quot;Hey, it&#39;s<br/>
her choice!&quot;  IMO there are things we can leave to them, and things we<br/>
can&#39;t.  I don&#39;t like taking my meds but I do it because I know what<br/>
will happen if I don&#39;t.  In children, they don&#39;t always know the<br/>
consquences nor can they appreciate them.  And to compare stretching a<br/>
child with CF with abuse is a disservice to all those parents with SN<br/>
kids that are doing their best every day to help their kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415733953">*** help me formulate some sort of answer here.***<br/>
<br/>
People with all the same claimed &quot;symptoms&quot; of dyslexia who are not pressured to read or given reading lessons or &quot;trained,&quot; learn to read when they&#39;re ready.   They might learn later but they learn for the same reason everyone who learns to read earlier learns:  They learn because their brains are ready.   I might read differently than you read.  You might read (and I mean see the words, process the words, organize the words) differently than the next person reads.  No matter how we process letters and words we all do that when our brains are ready to organize written language in the way that world for us.  The goal should not be to get all people to see and process and organize written words in the same way, but unfortunately we seem to be attached to the idea that there is one right way to learn to read.  <br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t learn to read by being taught how to read.   Because there&#39;s some portion of people who endure reading lessons and also learn to read is not proof that teaching equals learning.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell her people who spew nonsense need to be trained to shut the fuck up and then you can borrow my brass knuckles to begin her training, if you want.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an interesting chapter about &quot;dyslexia&quot; in the book Teach Your Own by John Holt.  I think it&#39;s chapter eleven titled &quot;Learning Difficulties.&quot;  Maybe you could suggest it to her between sound wollopings. <br/>
<br/>
(Or, wait for Joyce to deliver one of her arrestingly sophisticated replies and pass it along.)  <br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis, sick up to here (jabbing hand way up in the air) with people who think a brain can make sense of every other effing shape on the effing planet but can&#39;t makes sense of letter shapes without &quot;training.&quot;  What a load of bleeping blanketyblank.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725231839">FWIW my son with dyslexia - the one we did nothing for who went to <br/>
college and did fine, is an artist. He is now 20. He struggled to <br/>
read and didn&#39;t do so fluently till he was almost 12... He reads fine <br/>
now. When he&#39;s tired it&#39;s a little harder to keep the letters flowing <br/>
in the right direction, but he knows what he needs to do - slow down, <br/>
use a finger or tool to keep the letters in line (things he picked up <br/>
on the way.)  My dd with dyslexia is not asking for help at this <br/>
point and we are not coercing her to take it. I have offered. She was <br/>
a slower-than-my-other-kids reader, but we didn&#39;t care. She is 10 and <br/>
reads pretty well - again, unless she is distracted or tired! I <br/>
honestly think there are plenty of tools out there to help her, and <br/>
she does not need any &quot;training&quot;. We will go with the flow. If she <br/>
wants help, we&#39;ll look for it. She is very much like older son in a <br/>
lot of ways - really struggled with sensory problems as a little one!<br/>

  My intention is not to start a debate.  I am very clear about my beliefs (and when I say that I am *not* saying you aren&#39;t clear about yours!), and I respectfully decline to take this any further today.<br/>

          I said it wasn&#39;t unschooly. However are you suggesting that kids<br/>
aren&#39;t ever made to do anything? My 3 yr old would rather not have<br/>
her diaper changed. Should I let it be full of poop because she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to have it changed? She doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>
nasty inner ear infection...should I say &quot;Oh hell, whatever...if she<br/>
wants the meds she&#39;ll ask?&quot; Meanwhile she&#39;s suffering tremendous pain<br/>
and fevers and her ear drum could perforate. What&#39;s more important?<br/>
Health and safety or choosing everything? It&#39;s one thing to say a 15<br/>
yr old can play as much WOW as they want and it&#39;s quite another to<br/>
suggest that a child with CP not be stretched or a child with CF not<br/>
have her lungs drained because they would rather not. One is no big<br/>
deal, the other is life altering or death inducing. Where do you draw<br/>
the line?<br/>
<br/>
I think my neighbors want their daughter to be as functional as she<br/>
can be so that as an adult she can be as functional as she can be.<br/>
Are you suggesting they just leave her to seize up and say &quot;Hey, it&#39;s<br/>
her choice!&quot; IMO there are things we can leave to them, and things we<br/>
can&#39;t. I don&#39;t like taking my meds but I do it because I know what<br/>
will happen if I don&#39;t. In children, they don&#39;t always know the<br/>
consquences nor can they appreciate them. And to compare stretching a<br/>
child with CF with abuse is a disservice to all those parents with SN<br/>
kids that are doing their best every day to help their kids.<br/>

&gt; Man, IMHO this is very dangerous thinking. If we don&#39;t like it and the<br/>
&gt; children don&#39;t like it we&#39;ll just keep doing it?? I do understand the<br/>
&gt; examples that were given, however, how can those parents really ever know if<br/>
&gt; the girl with CP would in fact choose the *treatment* that makes her<br/>
&gt; scream?? &quot;For their own good&quot; is the title of a book by Alice Miller<br/>
&gt; referring to all that we have historically done TO children (*abuse*) &quot;for<br/>
&gt; their own good&quot;. What you are talking about clearly is your opinion, but in<br/>
&gt; my opinion is not &#39;unschooly&#39; at all.<br/>

&gt; RE: training it may be a poor choice of words but she&#39;s right. People<br/>

&gt; work through it. We can like it or not but there are things we have<br/>
&gt; to do TO our children for their own good whether or not they like it<br/>
&gt; or it respects them as a person. My neighbor&#39;s daughter has CP and<br/>
&gt; three times a day they have to stretch her arms and legs. She hates<br/>
&gt; it. It is uncomfortable and she screams the whole time. But if her<br/>
&gt; parents do not do this, she will be unable to function on any level.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s only the stretching that keeps her flexible enough to use her<br/>
&gt; walker and feed herself (she&#39;s 7) and that&#39;s the way it has to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know it&#39;s not &quot;unschooly&quot; to force a kid to do anything but there<br/>
&gt; are some things that kids would choose not to do but have to be done<br/>
&gt; anyway. Like giving medication, and other such issues. Once this<br/>
&gt; child learns to recognize letter groups and can read despite his<br/>
&gt; issues, he will be able to play WOW, read comics, and read which<br/>
&gt; cereal he wants for breakfast. There are other methods for reading,<br/>
&gt; like sight line marking but that won&#39;t work in a computer game or a<br/>
&gt; word document. To ignore that he has a problem or leave it up to him<br/>
&gt; to work on when he feels like it he won&#39;t be ahead of others, he will<br/>
&gt; be behind. It&#39;s likely she&#39;s just worried because our society is one<br/>
&gt; based on literacy and without this practice, he is essentially<br/>
&gt; illiterate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891579045">This is anecdotal, but, I know 4 people who are dyslexic and none had any real training. Two of them would always rewrite what they had written for clarity&#39;s sake and the other two weren&#39;t diagnosed until late into their school experience. They didn&#39;t have any special training. They just figured out how to read even with dyslexia. <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling and Dyslexia<br/>
<br/>
I <br/>
belong <br/>
to <br/>
and <br/>
in <br/>
someways <br/>
help <br/>
moderate <br/>
an <br/>
unschooling <br/>
board <br/>
on<br/>
myspace.  <br/>
Unfortunately, <br/>
we <br/>
do <br/>
not <br/>
have <br/>
the <br/>
luxury <br/>
of <br/>
moderation <br/>
of<br/>
posts.  <br/>
Right <br/>
now, <br/>
my <br/>
friend <br/>
Tara <br/>
and <br/>
I <br/>
are <br/>
struggling <br/>
to <br/>
keep <br/>
the<br/>
board <br/>
&quot;unschooly&quot;.  <br/>
Many <br/>
people <br/>
offer <br/>
up <br/>
advice <br/>
that <br/>
is <br/>
in <br/>
direct<br/>
contradiction <br/>
of <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
So <br/>
while <br/>
we <br/>
do <br/>
that...  <br/>
The <br/>
topic <br/>
of<br/>
unschooling <br/>
a <br/>
dyslexic <br/>
came <br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
I <br/>
do <br/>
not <br/>
know <br/>
much <br/>
about <br/>
dyslexias <br/>
but <br/>
I <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
agree <br/>
with <br/>
what <br/>
this<br/>
woman <br/>
is <br/>
saying.  <br/>
So <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
going <br/>
to <br/>
copy <br/>
and <br/>
paste <br/>
it <br/>
here <br/>
and <br/>
see <br/>
if<br/>
anyone <br/>
can <br/>
help <br/>
me <br/>
formulate <br/>
some <br/>
sort <br/>
of <br/>
answer <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
She <br/>
says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;with <br/>
dyslexia <br/>
you <br/>
HAVE <br/>
to <br/>
be <br/>
trained <br/>
in <br/>
how <br/>
to <br/>
get <br/>
past <br/>
it. <br/>
this <br/>
isnt<br/>
just <br/>
some <br/>
person <br/>
that <br/>
could <br/>
read <br/>
at <br/>
some <br/>
point. <br/>
if <br/>
he <br/>
isnt <br/>
trained <br/>
HOW<br/>
to <br/>
see <br/>
letters <br/>
in <br/>
groups <br/>
that <br/>
form <br/>
words <br/>
he <br/>
never <br/>
will <br/>
be <br/>
able <br/>
to <br/>
do<br/>
it <br/>
and <br/>
it <br/>
will <br/>
ALWAYS <br/>
be <br/>
frustrating <br/>
for <br/>
him. <br/>
since <br/>
neither <br/>
of <br/>
you <br/>
are<br/>
very <br/>
aware <br/>
of <br/>
dyslexia <br/>
I <br/>
am <br/>
going <br/>
to <br/>
tell <br/>
you <br/>
that <br/>
some <br/>
of <br/>
the<br/>
unschooling <br/>
pracitces <br/>
just <br/>
do <br/>
not <br/>
apply <br/>
to <br/>
dyslexics. <br/>
the <br/>
whole<br/>
concept <br/>
of <br/>
not <br/>
insisting <br/>
they <br/>
do <br/>
things <br/>
doesnt <br/>
work. <br/>
people <br/>
with<br/>
dyslexia <br/>
are <br/>
forced <br/>
to <br/>
do <br/>
these <br/>
types <br/>
of <br/>
eye <br/>
and <br/>
mind <br/>
training <br/>
so <br/>
that<br/>
at <br/>
some <br/>
point <br/>
things <br/>
suddenly <br/>
get <br/>
easier <br/>
for <br/>
them. <br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
agree!  <br/>
but <br/>
I <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
answer <br/>
her <br/>
either.  <br/>
Anyone <br/>
here <br/>
have<br/>
experience <br/>
with <br/>
this?  <br/>
She <br/>
is <br/>
insistent <br/>
on <br/>
TRAINING <br/>
this <br/>
child.  <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
not <br/>
trying <br/>
to <br/>
change <br/>
her <br/>
mind, <br/>
but <br/>
give <br/>
her <br/>
another <br/>
perspective <br/>
and<br/>
other <br/>
ways <br/>
of <br/>
helping <br/>
her <br/>

She says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;with dyslexia you HAVE to be trained in how to get past it. this isnt<br/>
just some person that could read at some point. if he isnt trained HOW<br/>
to see letters in groups that form words he never will be able to do<br/>
it and it will ALWAYS be frustrating for him. since neither of you are<br/>
very aware of dyslexia I am going to tell you that some of the<br/>
unschooling pracitces just do not apply to dyslexics. the whole<br/>
concept of not insisting they do things doesnt work. people with<br/>
dyslexia are forced to do these types of eye and mind training so that<br/>
at some point things suddenly get easier for them. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course I disagree with her completely. I am quite aware of dyslexia. <br/>
I do not need her to tell me that parents/teachers need to force a <br/>
child to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
But before I start arguing:<br/>
<br/>
How old is the &quot;dyslexic&quot; child in question?<br/>

RE: training it may be a poor choice of words but she&#39;s right.  People<br/>

<br/>
And your proof for this is where?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We can like it or not but there are things we have<br/>
to do TO our children for their own good whether or not they like it<br/>
or it respects them as a person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor&#39;s daughter has CP and<br/>
three times a day they have to stretch her arms and legs.  She hates<br/>
it.  It is uncomfortable and she screams the whole time.  But if her<br/>
parents do not do this, she will be unable to function on any level.<br/>
It&#39;s only the stretching that keeps her flexible enough to use her<br/>
walker and feed herself (she&#39;s 7) and that&#39;s the way it has to be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have they asked *her* what *she* would like to do about it?<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that we must MAKE others who are smaller and weaker do things <br/>
because we say so is WRONG. There are many other possibilities that are <br/>
not being discussed and explored.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not &quot;unschooly&quot; to force a kid to do anything but there<br/>
are some things that kids would choose not to do but have to be done<br/>
anyway.  Like giving medication, and other such issues.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
MIne have *never* chosen not to take medication that they knew would <br/>
help them. Many of us choose to do some pretty nasty, horrid things. <br/>
But that&#39;s our CHOICE.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Once this child learns to recognize letter groups and can read despite <br/>
his<br/>
issues, he will be able to play WOW, read comics, and read which<br/>
cereal he wants for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
He needs to READ which cereal he wants for breakfast? My two years olds <br/>
couldn&#39;t read, but they knew which *box* to choose.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, there are kids who *already* play WoW and read comics <br/>
without having been forced to &quot;recognize letter groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 There are other methods for reading,<br/>
like sight line marking but that won&#39;t work in a computer game or a<br/>
word document.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why children have PARENTS---to do those things *for* them until <br/>
they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 To ignore that he has a problem or leave it up to him<br/>
to work on when he feels like it he won&#39;t be ahead of others, he will<br/>
be behind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ahead of WHAT? Behind WHOM???<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s ignoring anything except these frantic parents who need for <br/>
their children to be taking college level courses at ten.<br/>
<br/>
The only *problem* is parents who are to hurried and impatient with <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
A child who has a print-rich world *WILL* learn to read when he&#39;s <br/>
ready. On his own schedule. In his own time.<br/>
<br/>
Period.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s likely she&#39;s just worried because our society is one<br/>
based on literacy and without this practice, he is essentially<br/>
illiterate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
At what age? Two year olds are illiterate, and they are SUPPOSED to be. <br/>
And yet there are nuts out there who are trying to teach two year olds <br/>
to read. WTF??!!<br/>
<br/>
Children *want* to do what adults do. That&#39;s hard-wired into them. They <br/>
will read when they are ready---but not a moment sooner, no matter <br/>
*what* crazy teacher/parents DO to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663464857">In actuality, having some experience with CP, it should not be so  <br/>
excruciating that she is screaming. They need to consult with their  <br/>
OT and PT and receive additional training. My son has ligament  <br/>
problems, and he could not stretch, run, walk completely upright. His  <br/>
therapy has never been painful, he has been stretched to the limit,  <br/>
but we always stop when he says he&#39;s ready to stop. He is willing to  <br/>
undergo that, because he knows that we will respect his needs. I have  <br/>
a daughter with severe autism, and we were castigated for not forcing  <br/>
40 hours of ABA on her every week. However, the therapy that we DID  <br/>
do was acceptable for her because it wasn&#39;t too much, it was on her  <br/>
terms, and we could stop when she was ready for a break.  Kids like  <br/>
Josh and Bre are dragged, kicking and screaming to the exact same  <br/>
therapy that we do. They are bribed, and spend about half of the time  <br/>
working because of the need for constant rewards. And yet, they still  <br/>
don&#39;t want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Very rarely to kids want to be in discomfort or pain, but often  <br/>
children who are parented in a mainstream way CHOOSE to defy those  <br/>
things that make them feel better because it is a struggle for  <br/>
autonomy. Yes, I have left my two year old in a dirty diaper. No, it  <br/>
did not kill her or even cause a terrible rash. When she was ready,  <br/>
she asked for a diaper change.<br/>

&gt; I said it wasn&#39;t unschooly. However are you suggesting that kids<br/>

&gt; her diaper changed. Should I let it be full of poop because she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to have it changed? She doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>
&gt; nasty inner ear infection...should I say &quot;Oh hell, whatever...if she<br/>
&gt; wants the meds she&#39;ll ask?&quot; Meanwhile she&#39;s suffering tremendous pain<br/>
&gt; and fevers and her ear drum could perforate. What&#39;s more important?<br/>
&gt; Health and safety or choosing everything? It&#39;s one thing to say a 15<br/>
&gt; yr old can play as much WOW as they want and it&#39;s quite another to<br/>
&gt; suggest that a child with CP not be stretched or a child with CF not<br/>
&gt; have her lungs drained because they would rather not. One is no big<br/>
&gt; deal, the other is life altering or death inducing. Where do you draw<br/>
&gt; the line?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think my neighbors want their daughter to be as functional as she<br/>
&gt; can be so that as an adult she can be as functional as she can be.<br/>

I said it wasn&#39;t unschooly.  However are you suggesting that kids<br/>
aren&#39;t ever made to do anything?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
yep<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 3 yr old would rather not have<br/>
her diaper changed.  Should I let it be full of poop because she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to have it changed?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children like clean butts. Adults too.<br/>
<br/>
Why would a child choose not to have a diaper changed?<br/>
<br/>
Why would an adult choose not to have a diaper changed?<br/>
<br/>
What could you do to change that? And make it more appealing?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>
nasty inner ear infection...should I say &quot;Oh hell, whatever...if she<br/>
wants the meds she&#39;ll ask?&quot;  Meanwhile she&#39;s suffering tremendous pain<br/>
and fevers and her ear drum could perforate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Either THIS *or* THAT---no other options/possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 What&#39;s more important?<br/>
Health and safety or choosing everything?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say 99% of humans choose health and safety, so I believe that <br/>
choosing everything is more important.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to say a 15<br/>
yr old can play as much WOW as they want and it&#39;s quite another to<br/>
suggest that a child with CP not be stretched or a child with CF not<br/>
have her lungs drained because they would rather not.  One is no big<br/>
deal, the other is life altering or death inducing.  Where do you draw<br/>
the line?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When the smaller, weaker human is not honored.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think my neighbors want their daughter to be as functional as she<br/>
can be so that as an adult she can be as functional as she can be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I think we all do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting they just leave her to seize up and say &quot;Hey, it&#39;s<br/>
her choice!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m suggesting that they talk with her about how she&#39;d like to <br/>
proceed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  IMO there are things we can leave to them, and things we<br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many of your emails have clued us in to these opinions of yours. Many <br/>
of us disagree.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t like taking my meds but I do it because I know what<br/>
will happen if I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What will happen?<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ve been informed of the potentialities, so you choose the meds <br/>
over the possible eventuality, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 In children, they don&#39;t always know the<br/>
consquences nor can they appreciate them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First off, why DOESN&#39;T the child know the consequences?<br/>
<br/>
ANd why do you think a child cannot appreciate the consequences and <br/>
make a rational decision concerning them???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And to compare stretching a<br/>
child with CF with abuse is a disservice to all those parents with SN<br/>
kids that are doing their best every day to help their kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It IS abusive to force pain on a child.<br/>
<br/>
It is a completely different issue if the *child* chooses it and is <br/>
allowed to say &quot;when.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136604212">I was just sharing with my dad this morning about the differences between the 2 groups I belong to.  One is Canadian, and we are Oh So Polite about our opinions.  We have them, but are ever so slightly more careful to not offend you or piss you off.  Then there is this group that is seriously straight up.  I for one need to hear straight up right now because I&quot;m still such a newbie RU that when I hear a mainstream opinion I still kind of go &#39;really, could that be true??&#39;, then I hear from Kelly and company and find out, once again, it&#39;s all just bullshit.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208373493">&quot;RE: training it may be a poor choice of words but she&#39;s right. People<br/>
with dyslexia don&#39;t grow out of it, they have to practice and learn to<br/>
work through it. We can like it or not but there are things we have<br/>
to do TO our children for their own good whether or not they like it<br/>
or it respects them as a person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I absolutely disagree.  No, they don&#39;t grow out of it, but people with<br/>
dyslexia can learn to work through it without having anything forced upon<br/>
them.    Anything that can be trained can be learned and discovered without<br/>
force or coercion.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My oldest child has never received any sort of diagnosis officially, but<br/>
would qualify for many (and what gives me so little faith in diagnoses is<br/>
that I think *most* people could get at least one diagnoses of something<br/>
that would be labeled a &quot;learning disability&quot;- probably the biggest misnomer<br/>
out there).  Dyslexia is one of them.  His path to reading and writing on<br/>
his own has been amazing to watch.  No one has ever told him that he is<br/>
disabled.  We have had discussions about things he finds frustrating (not a<br/>
whole lot as he keeps most of that to himself) and the way he sees things<br/>
and how there are other people out in the world who see things the same way,<br/>
even though it&#39;s not the same way the majority of people do.  We&#39;ve talked<br/>
about how there are different approaches that he can take to help him<br/>
interpret written words and write things in a way they will be more<br/>
understandable for any audience, and the possibility of exploring those if<br/>
he ever thinks it would be useful to him.  But mostly, he&#39;s taken his time<br/>
and worked things out on his own.  From what I can tell, his personal<br/>
approach is about making meaning vs. detailed phonics.   We live in a<br/>
reading household.  We enjoy stories.  We&#39;ve never limited his access to<br/>
books on tape or cd, which I think has given him the ability to learn to<br/>
love reading and stories and the way words can be put together without the<br/>
pressure of having to deal with text.  He still prefers to have long books<br/>
read to him and I do on occasions that we can&#39;t get the book on cd.  His own<br/>
reading is generally of a more informational nature.  But he definitely<br/>
keeps most of this to himself and it did take time.  He began to do some<br/>
reading independently at about the age of 10, and unlike many stories about<br/>
kids who suddenly can read anything, he has gradually gained proficiency.<br/>
Decoding and reading aren&#39;t really the same thing.  My son has difficulty<br/>
decoding and maybe that won&#39;t ever come easily to him (and maybe someday it<br/>
will, because I don&#39;t believe any prognosis can take into account the<br/>
amazing things that can happen when your life is based in absolute freedom<br/>
and joy), but he has a great understanding of the complexities of story and<br/>
meaning, as well as a heck of a vocabulary.  He&#39;s just joined an online book<br/>
club to discuss Star Wars books with adults and he&#39;s thrilled about it.  Of<br/>
course, I already know more about Star Wars than I ever imagined I&#39;d want to<br/>
know and I&#39;ll be reading the book out loud for him..but it also makes a<br/>
connection and gives us yet one more thing we can discuss together.    And I<br/>
get to have fun making up voices!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**My daughter is from an orphanage in China.  She has NO language.  No<br/>
Chinese, no English.  She was beaten and neglected.  Being left in the<br/>
same diaper for days until wounds formed was not unusual for her.  She<br/>
would choose not to have her diaper changed because when she was<br/>
changed she was beaten for not being potty trained.  She has to<br/>
overcome the fear of being beaten.  AND it&#39;s my duty to make sure she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have enormous sores that cover 50% or more of her bottom.  So<br/>
she&#39;s being changed against her will, and every time we do it, she<br/>
learns a beating isn&#39;t part of the changing process.  Each time, the<br/>
diapering process becomes easier on us both and slowly the tension and<br/>
fear is losing it&#39;s grip on my daughter.  The problem with this list<br/>
is you all *seem* to presuppose bio children who share a common<br/>
language with their parents.&gt;<br/>

general anesthesia for 2 weeks?  Hiding meds in food is a big NO NO<br/>
for children that were starved, food should be comfort not punishment.<br/>
 So she gets the meds, and then we do our best to comfort her.  And we<br/>
recognize that this is temporary.  With good care she shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
these issues anymore.  Eventually, when she&#39;s ready, she will acquire<br/>
language.  Once she does and truly understands the words we can talk<br/>
about consequences and choices.  But until then, you would suggest<br/>
what?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say 99% of humans choose health and safety, so I believe that<br/>
&gt; choosing everything is more important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Children who have learned NO ONE cares about their comfort and<br/>
safety, emotional security and happiness DO NOT choose health and<br/>
safety.  That is false.  Children who have never been given anything<br/>
are frequently overwhelmed by choices and so those choices have to be<br/>
limited until they can process their new situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; When the smaller, weaker human is not honored.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**I&#39;d say that making sure my daughter&#39;s body is cared for, that her<br/>
safety is my top concern and her feelings of comfort and meeting her<br/>
needs are honored IS the most important thing I can do for her at this<br/>
point.  Until she can understand what it means to have choices and she<br/>
can figures out that when she needs something her parents will provide<br/>
it she can&#39;t make decisions for herself.  (Additionally she&#39;s<br/>
developmentally about 12 months old and how many choices do you give a<br/>
1 yr old anyway?)  Do you allow a 12 month old child to decide not to<br/>
take meds?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; First off, why DOESN&#39;T the child know the consequences?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ANd why do you think a child cannot appreciate the consequences and<br/>
&gt; make a rational decision concerning them???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>** Speaking for my child, see above as to why she doesn&#39;t know the<br/>
consequences and why it&#39;s beyond her capability at this point in time<br/>
to make a rational decision.  Do you think she can?  How do you<br/>
suggest a child home 4 weeks and neglected and abused for 3.5 yrs be<br/>
made to understand how to make a rational decision concerning any<br/>
choice?  Right now she can choose between two colors of sippy cups<br/>
because she knows what she likes and language isn&#39;t necessary.   I<br/>
give her the ability to choose what she can at this point in time and<br/>
I make decisions for her when choices aren&#39;t easy to make.  Deciding<br/>
for her is preferable to her dissolving into frustration because it&#39;s<br/>
too overwhelming for her to make the choices herself.<br/>
<br/>
I know you all don&#39;t like my opinions and that&#39;s OK but you all seem<br/>
very quick to attribute abusive and cruel intentions to all parents<br/>
when I think more often than not parents do what they know (right or<br/>
wrong) and they are scared to do anything different.  And FWIW you<br/>
should not assume all parents have blank slate kids with no issues to<br/>
overcome.  Some of us have special circumstances.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397459134">Early on, before I was connected with many unschoolers, I took a LOT<br/>
of comfort from reading books and articles about Sudbury Valley<br/>
School, a &quot;school&quot; where kids choose what to do, not from a preset<br/>
menu, but are allowed true freedom. They have never, in their 40 years<br/>
of existence, had a child diagnosed with a &quot;reading disorder&quot;, and all<br/>
graduates of the school know how to read. As Kelly so very eloquently<br/>
and firmly put it, a child will read *when they are ready to*. I have<br/>
no doubt my youngest would have *developed* dyslexia if he was in a<br/>
school setting, or I pushed reading on him at all. He used to<br/>
frequently *say* things in a jumbled-up way, and he didn&#39;t even hear<br/>
that&#39;s what he&#39;d done - to him, it sounded just like what had been<br/>
said to him. That&#39;s lessened a LOT as he&#39;s gotten older.<br/>
<br/>
It probably would have gotten worse if I felt as if I had to TRAIN him<br/>
to say things right, and TRAIN him to read. Instead, I kept trusting<br/>
that he it would all straighten out, and he would read when he was<br/>
ready. Even when he was frustrated with not knowing how to read. He<br/>
didn&#39;t want any type of lessons, following along with a finger, etc.<br/>
So he was frustrated for a time. I kept reminding him that when he was<br/>
ready, he would read, and until then, either his brother or I would<br/>
read to him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s working out. In its (and his) own time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685321396">Chiming in here as a dyslexic person who&#39;s parents spent a small<br/>
fortune on &quot;special training&quot;   My parents drove 3 hrs one way once a<br/>
week to bring me from the Coast of NC to a specialized center in<br/>
Durham NC at the Hill Center for tutoring, spent summers sending me to<br/>
expensive boarding school programs at LD schools, put me in all sorts<br/>
of private schools and so on and on.   <br/>
Long story short... I could read at age 3!   I have no word attack and<br/>
couldn&#39;t learn phonics no matter how much money was paid to a tutor! <br/>
 I memorized MILLIONS of words and was a fluent reader and speller<br/>
from a very early age... I don&#39;t remember not being able to read so it<br/>
might have been before age 3 but that&#39;s when my mother realized I<br/>
could read (I spelled biscuit for my brother for his homework!)   <br/>
<br/>
I also realized ON MY OWN that closing one eye made the words stop<br/>
their dance across the page!   I still do that sometimes!   Anyway my<br/>
point is that I wasn&#39;t exactly left to figure it out on  my own or<br/>
unschooled to learn to read consciously on the part of my parents<br/>
because I did it before they ever considered any formal education!   I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if I had been dragged to all<br/>
those places in order to learn to read at all!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I am so thankful to have been born into a print rich house where<br/>
everyone read, where there were books and I was read to extensively<br/>
for hours and hours and the relationship between print and words was<br/>
made naturally without coercive behavior on the part of my parents...<br/>
wait!  HEY that sounds like unschooling!   Too bad they bought the<br/>
party line at the traditional schools that without specialized<br/>
training and tutoring I would never make it through school!   I like<br/>
to think I made it DESPITE the training!<br/>

started from), we&#39;re talking about children with generally age-<br/>
appropriate development in terms of physical, emotional and <br/>
psychological development - which does NOT include school grade &quot;age <br/>
level&quot; stuff. Your little one is not on that level yet (you indicate <br/>
she&#39;s at about a year old in terms of development). I *know* I <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;ask&quot; DS when he was a year old if he wanted medication for <br/>
his ear infection(s) - I&#39;d just give it to him. But, once he was able <br/>
to communicate (which your little one will someday do), there were <br/>
way more options. For that matter, I *chose* to stop giving him a <br/>
particular medication when he was a wee one because it caused his <br/>
body to shake - not a lot, not earthshaking, but not &quot;normal&quot; for him <br/>
either. It meant that I spent a lot of time sitting in a steamy <br/>
bathroom instead of just giving him this medication (for a minor <br/>
respiratory infection), way less convenient and more time consuming <br/>
that just giving him the medication (BTW it was a listed side effect <br/>
of the medication at that). <br/>
<br/>
But jumping from the discussion of &quot;dyslexics need special training <br/>
for their own good&quot; to the complex parenting needed for a very unique <br/>
and painful situation is really not a reasonable jump. Kind of like <br/>
the saying that hard cases make bad law. In some ways, it sounds <br/>
like, while we (in general) may be presuming a fairly neurotypical, <br/>
physically average, child in a fairly average parenting situation, <br/>
you seem to be going over the opposite extreme, presuming that &quot;for <br/>
the child&#39;s own good&quot; is an overall good strategy in general. While <br/>
it is perhaps necessary for now with your own little one, that is in <br/>
no way the typical situation for the majority of people. And, if the <br/>
child who is being pushed to screaming is capable of discussing the <br/>
situation, that should be happening (as some here have indicated that <br/>
they have personal experience with similar situations and it should <br/>
not be pushed to that extreme). As much freedom and choice as is <br/>
*possible* is the overall idea.<br/>
<br/>
While you have a difficult and unique situation, please do not expect <br/>
that giving a recommendation of &quot;doing it for the child&#39;s own good&quot; <br/>
is going to go unquestioned here.<br/>

for the characters but by about 1/4 of the way in it all sort of blends <br/>
into a mush. DH is much better at keeping all the voices separate (and <br/>
inventing really fun ones).<br/>
