<div id="ygrps-yiv-603404309">This is what we used to do in regards to our 4 year old and bedtime:<br/>
1) watch for sleepy signs<br/>
2)then bring him up to his room (this would usually turn out to be around the<br/>
same time<br/>
every night-between 7;10 and 7:30 p.m.)<br/>
3)read books, listen to tapes, sing songs, talk-his choice-until he fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Normally he would fall asleep within 2 to 20 mins.<br/>
Not bad, probably. He had a *bedtime* but it wasn&#39;t arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, he would *fight* sleeping almost every night.<br/>
Even when his eyes were closing he would fight it and say, &quot;mom didn&#39;t you know?<br/>
this is<br/>
how i sleep. with my eyes open&quot; and &quot;mom, i wasn&#39;t sleeping, i was just<br/>
pretending.&quot; :)<br/>
There would also be lots of restlessness, and sometimes yelling.<br/>
Almost always he fell asleep quickly, but lately it had been taking 40 mins to<br/>
an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Two things happened for me<br/>
-I thought maybe I need to change the bedtime, that I was *missing* his sleepy<br/>
signals,<br/>
and/or<br/>
-that maybe now was the time to *lift* a *bedtime* guided by us.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I decided it was time to lift the bedtime.<br/>
We recognized that Marley has a really difficult time accepting when he is<br/>
tired, he<br/>
recognizes it but fights fights FIGHTS it, and we wanted to help him get to a<br/>
place where<br/>
he felt comfortable and o.k. with being sleepy and could/would tell US when he<br/>
was tired<br/>
and wanted to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
We have an older son, Sett, who is 10 1/2 who stays up till he decides he&#39;s<br/>
ready for bed<br/>
and has been doing that for awhile now. (about 8 months, i think).<br/>
We don&#39;t feel comfortable with Mars being downstairs either alone or with his<br/>
brother for<br/>
what could be long periods of time without us.<br/>
They get along really well but Sett is not ready (his determination which was<br/>
also our<br/>
guess)to be alone with Mars on that level.<br/>
What we came up with was that Mars can stay downstairs as long as one of us (me<br/>
or my<br/>
husband) are also down there.<br/>
After that, he has the choice of either coming up to our room with us where he<br/>
can watch<br/>
t.v. or read or draw or whatever he wants that is on the quieter side of things<br/>
till he falls<br/>
asleep<br/>
or<br/>
he can go to his room with one of us and do the same kinds of things till he<br/>
falls asleep.<br/>
<br/>
He can also tell us when he&#39;s sleepy and or fall asleep down with us and then<br/>
we&#39;d take<br/>
him up.<br/>
<br/>
The first night Mars fell asleep watching t.v (12:30 a.m.). and my husband,<br/>
Adam, took<br/>
him up sometime after.<br/>
<br/>
The second night Mars said he was sleepy and ready to go up when Sett said he<br/>
was ready<br/>
to go up(1:30 a.m.), but ended up fighting sleep once he was up there and saying<br/>
he<br/>
wasn&#39;t ready so my husband brought him back down and he fell asleep playing mega<br/>
man.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my husband was ready to go up. (Adam and I had talked about being<br/>
aware of<br/>
when it was about 20-30 mins before we were absolutely ready to go to bed so<br/>
that we<br/>
could help Mars transition from being downstairs to being upstairs.)<br/>
At 12:30 a.m. he started giving Marley time to adjust saying things like &quot;Mars,<br/>
We&#39;re going<br/>
up in 30 mins, in 20 mins, in 10, in 5, in 3...&quot;. (This is what has worked best,<br/>
transitions-<br/>
wise, for my guys in the past, giving time *warnings* so they know it&#39;s coming.)<br/>
Adam had been asking Marley what and where he would like to do/go-our room, his<br/>
room, books, gameboy, etc., but Mars was not interested in deciding.<br/>
So when the time came to go up, Mars freaked out and started screaming and<br/>
yelling and<br/>
kicking and refused to go up.<br/>
I had been asleep but woke up when I heard him and came down. I sat with him on<br/>
the<br/>
couch and held him and listened to him and he told me how he was feeling and I<br/>
listened<br/>
and gave him hugs and kisses. After he was in a calmner space, i started talking<br/>
wiht him<br/>
about what his options were-of either our room or his and which did he want but<br/>
he got<br/>
really upset again. Eventually I told him I was bringing him up to his room. He<br/>
was still<br/>
screaming and was pretty upset and I laid him in his bed and laid with him<br/>
untill he fell<br/>
asleep about 5 minutes later. Even as he was falling asleep he was saying &quot;mom,<br/>
i&#39;m so<br/>
annoyed with you&quot; . (All of this, from when i came down to when he fell asleep,<br/>
took about<br/>
20 mins.)<br/>
<br/>
What do i do now??? What did I do wrong??? We are working on putting a t.v. in<br/>
the boy&#39;s<br/>
room as soon as we can,<br/>
but other than that I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
Am I starting this (letting him tell us) too early?<br/>
Is it that I&#39;ve started this too late?<br/>
Help. Please :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751670358">I also have a guy that fights sleeping.  At 4, he needed a routine of calming things to help his body ease into relaxation rather than fight against it.  He would have a bath, then a foot massage, then be carried to bed and read a story.  Same thing every night.  We simply started when he seemed tired but not yet cranky.  Very similar to what you were doing with your son.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 7, he actually stays up quite a bit later but will often say &quot;I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;  There are still times when we go back to the old routine of bath and foot massage.  He seems to find it comforting, like an old teddy bear.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that perhaps your son is a bit young to be making those decisions independently.  I personally, would go back to watching for his signals, calming him and calming the house, like talking to your older son about having a half hour or so with low lights and only soft music to help his little brother move into sleep (so Mars doesn&#39;t feel he is missing out on a good video fight).<br/>
