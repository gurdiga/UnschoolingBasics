<div id="ygrps-yiv-82247081">That Subject Title is meant to be rather facetious, but is helps sum up what I am struggling with.  Briefly, we have four children, 11, 7, 4.5 and 3.  I rarely get any one-on-one time with each child.  How do you get personal, private time with so many children?<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, the oldest three went on an errand for their dad and left me and the 3 year-old alone in the house.  We played with blocks and cars and had a nice time.<br/>
 <br/>
This rare occurrence of having only one child almost NEVER happens.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, I have the whole crew all the time.  It is nice that we all work well as a team and have so much contact but while I was playing with the little one, <br/>
<br/>
I recognized that I don&#39;t KNOW my kids individually very well.  <br/>
<br/>
My two oldest and my two youngest tend to  pair off and while I was playing with the youngest, I realized how much time he spends with his older sister and that this may not always be a good thing; as she can be rather domineering and possessive and he tends to consistently get the short end of the stick.  <br/>
<br/>
It was obvious while playing with him, that he did not expect a gentle, cooperative playmate.  He had many of the same mannerisms and responses that my daughter has and they tend NOT to encourage happy, cooperative play. That made me sad.<br/>
  <br/>
Obviously, I am going to try harder to set up one-on-one timebut I would love to see how other people with more than two kids in the house handle this issue.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, how do you handle getting some personal private time and still nurture a relationship with your children?<br/>
<br/>
For example, my husband is home today and I have the unusual opportunity to go to the store alone<br/>
<br/>
or do I take my daughter and have some private time with her.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been VERY cranky and prickly the past two days and feel like I need some time alone<br/>
<br/>
but she needs Mommy Time and would LOVE it and shine like a buttercup if I took just her.<br/>
<br/>
What would you do?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902693524">Sometimes taking just one child, especially and older child, is almost like<br/>
getting a day out with a friend, but better.<br/>
You can do something special and grown up, like getting a coffee drink<br/>
together or going out to lunch.  Hit a bookstore and<br/>
you might get a few moments to look at books while your daughter looks at<br/>
what interests her.  Your 11 daughter<br/>
will grow up in a blink of an eye.  Take the moment now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*** I have a similar challenge as my children are spaced fairly far, 3, 8<br/>
and (almost) 14. There aren&#39;t too many coinciding interests. We try to make<br/>
the best of those, like bicycling, swimming and hiking. For other interests<br/>
we might split up. The two older ones like some of the same anime shows and<br/>
will watch together or talk about them or share new found shows with each<br/>
other. The younger two share more common interests and I can do more with<br/>
them together.<br/>
<br/>
When one has an interest that is divergent from the other two or need some<br/>
one on one time I juggle :-) I may play with the youngest while the other<br/>
two are pursuing something independently. After the youngest has her needs<br/>
filled I check in on the other two. I will give them focused attention for a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Car rides are great for giving attention to my oldest. The little ones sit<br/>
in back and the oldest up front. I can really listen to her. I miss having a<br/>
car for that reason the most.<br/>
<br/>
I will go places with each kid or smaller sets of kids. Dh took the two<br/>
older ones to see HP 7.1 and I stayed with the littlest. And he use to take<br/>
the older one to Fright Town each week and that gave her special time with<br/>
papa.<br/>
<br/>
Of course these specific things are for our family. Your things will look<br/>
different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***If it needs to happen make it happen. This happens spontaneously in our<br/>
family now. There have been times when it wasn&#39;t an we made plans. Each kid<br/>
had a date with each parent. We did it enough to meet needs with as little<br/>
stress as possible,<br/>

<br/>

your feelings into it more than needed. I would check with him and see where<br/>
he is.<br/>

time with those two together facilitating cooperative play.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s always a tricky situation when there are unmet needs. I find it<br/>
easier to met my needs when my children are taken care of. They give me<br/>
space easily. However, if things get out of balance I occasionally have to<br/>
ask them to give me space. Since we are generally on this is usually not a<br/>
big deal.<br/>
<br/>
We just move 3000 miles and we are definitely out of whack at the moment. My<br/>
partner and I have been trying to juggle as best as possible to meet<br/>
everyones needs. We are coming back to balance but it is taking time.<br/>
