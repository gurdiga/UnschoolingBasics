<div id="ygrps-yiv-463780880">Hi.Thanks for all this great info.No, Kelly I am not anti unschooling <br/>
and I am not against it.I was just trying to understand.<br/>
I was on an unschooling chat a long while ago which Sandra Dodd was <br/>
on but the people were so nasty to each other I finally had to <br/>
unsubcribe.I am going to read more.<br/>
I see how kids can learn everything they need just through living-but <br/>
math is the only thing that really has me &quot;worried&quot;.I only had basic <br/>
math so when it comes to algebra or higher math I coulnt help <br/>
them.What if my child wants to go to college and needs this to be <br/>
excepted? I really dont know this- I am not being negative.It seems <br/>
to me that unschoolers in general get very upset when people question <br/>
them-or maybe I am just taking it the wrong way.<br/>
                    Thank again everyone,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575058830">Yeah, math had me worried, too.  <br/>
<br/>
To the point that I printed out an assessment for curriculum<br/>
[Singapore Math] for ds (5) which was about 15 pages long and looked<br/>
SOOOO daunting.<br/>
<br/>
But before I could attempt to &quot;get him&quot; to do it, he was sneaking it,<br/>
one page at a time, and running off to do the various questions by<br/>
himself.  Correctly, I might add.  He couldn&#39;t tell me how he knew the<br/>
answers to many of the questions, but that doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from measuring for baking, playing cribbage, or figuring out how<br/>
much paint needed to paint a room, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually &quot;done&quot;<br/>
any math.  Certainly we haven&#39;t done more than one concept beyond<br/>
counting.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s proven to me I need to have more faith in him.<br/>

<br/>
It just works.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, when I did college for Registered Massage Therapy, they almost<br/>
didn&#39;t let me in because of 2 low science marks.  I was informed that<br/>
I would have been accepted immediately, and without interview, without<br/>
any diploma.  I get the impression that badges in boy scouts are more<br/>
meaningful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670139296">HI Jeanne!<br/>
  I also worried, and honestly still do sometimes, about math.  But I <br/>
was an A student in math, after a teacher humiliated me in front of <br/>
the class!  It stuck with me and after that math never beat me <br/>
again.  But, now at 40, if I tried to do some of that math again, I&#39;d <br/>
have to study it again!  I think back to this and find it so funny, I <br/>
thought I knew it and now I can&#39;t do it!<br/>
  But the ONE thing I really really wanted to do was cut short <br/>
because of all the homework. I got in trouble for trying to do it in <br/>
every class I was in!  So now I&#39;m trying to figure out how to get <br/>
myself back into what I was meant to do, which is drawing!<br/>
  Keep reading, it&#39;ll make more and more sense as time goes on and <br/>
those &quot;little monsters&quot; will soon go away.  <br/>
  The nice thing about THIS message board is they let everyone who <br/>
has a thought post a thought, without ridicule. So stick around!<br/>
