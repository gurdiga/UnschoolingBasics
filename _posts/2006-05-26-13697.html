I personally think this is a myth also. From my experience (and I realize I have not experienced every child in the whole wide world) kids will act out for a variety of reasons. In all cases they&#39;re trying to tell us something-I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m frustrated, I&#39;m bored, I&#39;m restless, etc. Lots of times they give us cues way before the meltdown stage and we can be proactive. We can bring them food, suggest a temporary change in activity, rub their shoulders or whatever it is they need. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the meltdown will still happen, but many times the trouble can be averted. Helping a child learn that they feel better after video game breaks (or reading breaks or swimming breaks) is part of our job. Blaming the video game for a tired or frenetic kid does nothing to help you learn what&#39;s really triggering particular reactions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not exactly sure what a sugar-bombed kid is exactly. Usually the times that kids get lots of sugar are times when there&#39;s lots of activity and excitement going along with it. Birthday parties, carnivals, trick or treating, Easter baskets all have a lot of fanfare associated with them. I think it&#39;s the build up, activity and fanfare that leads to overstimulation and breakdowns. But the sugar gets blamed as if it was the only thing to touch the child that day. <br/>
<br/>
I realize there are reactions to sugar. I know that I&#39;m hypoglycemic, so I need some protein when I have something very sugary or I&#39;ll feel awful when my blood sugar level crashes. (Would that make be sugar-bombed? &lt;g&gt;.)  I&#39;ve made my kids aware of this connection and so they are good at listening to their own bodies&#39; cues and reactions. If they do end up being hypoglycemic like me, I&#39;ll have done them no favors if I simply forbid candy to avoid the meltdown. How much better to help them understand their bodies and learn what a healthy balance of foods feels like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915594019">*this ended up being  kind of long and blathery* just sharing my <br/>
process with all this new info I get from this list...   <br/>
  Hi Mary--<br/>
Gosh, I thought about this for a long time. I mean, I do think that <br/>
anything we put into our bodies affects us to any degree. And what we <br/>
do also affects us. But, it&#39;s been interesting to look at my <br/>
attachments to my ideas. <br/>
  I realize that when my boy is IN a melt down or very close to it <br/>
that I say no to sugary food or video games. The un-met needs are <br/>
already speaking in the grumpy behavior. I was thinking the vidoes or <br/>
sugar made the grumpy acting out behavior. But..(thinking out loud <br/>
here)..maybe the need IS to play video games? I&#39;m thinking of Pam&#39;s <br/>
post of her daughter playing SIMS for days. I understand this in my <br/>
own behavior. I often will listen to the same album or even song for <br/>
a month easily. Or I&#39;ll watch the same movie for a month straight. I <br/>
just watched Chocolat (with Juliette Binoche) at least once or twice <br/>
a day for the last 2 or 3 weeks, actually. I would think it was <br/>
preposterous for someone to chastise me for it or try to change what <br/>
I do. For me to assume what my boy should be into at any given time <br/>
is equally ridiculous. <br/>
  Here&#39;s a little story: my boy got home from school the other day---<br/>
yeah that&#39;s right, I&#39;m WAY the newbie here. My boy won&#39;t be going <br/>
back to school next year. Blech. Anyway, he says to me that he wants <br/>
to play video games. I say, well, gosh sweetie, I have to go to work <br/>
in an hour (I work P/T) and I want to visit with you. He REALLY wants <br/>
to play, so he plays the video games. I&#39;m sitting right there, <br/>
actually laying down on the couch because I have cramps and we&#39;re <br/>
talking about the game and whatnot and the time comes for me to get <br/>
ready and go to work and we have to go drop him off with my <br/>
partner/his dad who is working. My boy was so sad that we didn&#39;t get <br/>
to visit before I had to go to work, but he did get to play videos. I <br/>
hugged him and loved him thru the sad feelings of not getting to <br/>
visit, but it was what he wanted at the time. I checked in throughout <br/>
his playing time to see if he wanted to turn it off and visit and he <br/>
said no and that was really ok with me. We were still together, <br/>
talking.  <br/>
 Another anecdote: the other day my son said, &quot;mom, I wish I could <br/>
get in your head and make you do what I want.&quot; &quot;And what would that <br/>
be?&quot; I asked. He said he wanted to choose what to eat for dinner. <br/>
Crap! Am I really that controlling? Aargh. So, tonight he ate a cute <br/>
frosted flower shaped cookie, he wanted some gummi bears and some <br/>
some chocolate drops (natural m&m&#39;s). I put some in a bag (bought in <br/>
bulk). That was dinner. No meltdown. We had a great night. Oh, and <br/>
later he wanted raviolis. And a little watermelon. Now, we have had <br/>
dinners like this before, but I always fretted about it a lot. I want <br/>
to be less stressed about it. <br/>
  I saw the post about the books (Let Them Eat Cake, etc) and <br/>
thought...man, I&#39;m going to read that book! <br/>
  I&#39;ve had a bunch of times where my boy has played video games for <br/>
hours and hours, once for 11 hrs and he didn&#39;t flip out. He was <br/>
perfectly content. and other times where he eat a bunch of sugary <br/>
stuff and there was no meltdown. Before now, I didn&#39;t know how that <br/>
could be. I think I&#39;m starting to understand a little bit more now. <br/>
Trying to let go of my attachments.<br/>
 Anyway, thanks.<br/>
~~Julie.<br/>
