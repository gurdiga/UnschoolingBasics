It must be really hard. I lost my older brother when he was 24 and I still don&#39;t know what to say.<br/>

  Hmmm, well, I believe I&#39;ve posted a similar question about 2 years <br/>
  ago on a similar forum!! LOL!! I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m &quot;Experienced&quot; now, <br/>
  but I have gained a lot of insight from reading here on this board, <br/>
  (I don&#39;t post much), and from subscribing to &quot;Life Learning&quot; <br/>
  magazine, and by just spending time with my DS, who is going to be 11 <br/>
  in July. <br/>
<br/>
  The past 4 months, my 33-year-old brother, (who, by the way was a <br/>
  self-educated genius!!!), was missing. He disappeared on a trip from <br/>
  his home in Utah, to come and visit me in So. California. The end <br/>
  result was a tragedy, as he was found in the desert on March 6th, <br/>
  murdered, only 55 feet from where the police towed his car from n <br/>
  December, (a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I <br/>
  guess)...but that&#39;s another story!! <br/>
<br/>
  During that time, I was extremely pre-occupied with the task of <br/>
  trying to locate my brother, basically ignoring the &quot;Unschooling&quot;, <br/>
  because after all, it&#39;s &quot;Unschooling&quot; so why be consumed with trying <br/>
  to find things for our son to do when something so important requires <br/>
  my time? (Sounds a little selfish?, But Wait....)<br/>
<br/>
  You know what? A new young man has blossomed from this experience! He <br/>
  discovered new things, on his own, that he never was interested in <br/>
  before. He found his own things to do/learn...He started building a <br/>
  block and mortar miniature house, he built a turret out of a washing-<br/>
  machine box, complete with a rotating scope, he learned how golf <br/>
  balls were made by watching the Discovery Channel and taking one <br/>
  apart on his own, he&#39;s able to name MANY airplanes from WWI up <br/>
  through today because of watching the military channel, and a show <br/>
  that covers weapons of the future, (can&#39;t think of the name of it <br/>
  right now), and all because I just left him alone to do as he <br/>
  pleased. <br/>
<br/>
  I think that&#39;s the problem for a lot of people, myself included. We <br/>
  are soooo used to being &quot;Schooled&quot; that it&#39;s hard to just let go and <br/>
  let them learn. We always feel like we need to be &quot;helping&quot; them when <br/>
  they are quite capable of doing all of this on their own. <br/>
<br/>
  As for companionship, we&#39;ve offered many times for our son to &quot;be <br/>
  involved&quot; in group sports, or to take lessons, or take an outside <br/>
  class of some sort, but he usually just wants to be with us!! I LOVE <br/>
  that!! He has friends from his days in a Private School, but has <br/>
  become acquainted with many new friends from sports, church, or <br/>
  parties or what-have-you. He calls them when he wants a companion, I <br/>
  don&#39;t orchestrate any of it! And it works! Plus, it builds up his <br/>
  confidence in using the telephone, and he&#39;s learning the specifics of <br/>
  planning, date, time, how the friend arrives, how they get home, <br/>
  dinner or not, etc...<br/>
<br/>
  We do have exciting things planned as a family, such as going to the <br/>
  Star Wars Exhibit at the California Museum of Science, visiting the <br/>
  Living Desert, going camping at the beach...but it&#39;s not always <br/>
  necessary to &quot;Plan and Schedule&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  I hope what I&#39;m saying is making sense. Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
<br/>
  Best of Luck with your Unschooling Journey!!<br/>
