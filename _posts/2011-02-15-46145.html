<div id="ygrps-yiv-614426072">Hello.  I&#39;m new to the group and fairly new to unschooling.  We have homeschooled for many years but changed directions this year.  We lived in Maryland but moved to WV last year.  We moved back to Maryland in November and I am really stressing over finding a reviewer for the end of the year.  We are in Washington County but I am willing to send info or travel some to get what we need.  I am really afraid that we won&#39;t be able to pass this year&#39;s review since we changed our routine.  We have a planner showing subjects studied but not much in the form of actual &quot;paper&quot; work.  Any info would really be appreciated.  I did see one website listing some unschooling info but the membership and review were extremely expensive.  Please let me know any thoughts/suggestions you have.  Thank you all so very much!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195055568">Many Paths is an unschooling umbrella group in Maryland.  Another umbrella in Maryland that supports unschoolers is The Excelsior Academy.  Both are very good.  I don&#39;t have the email addresses any more but I&#39;m sure you could do a search and find them. <br/>
<br/>
Much support,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790584601">We belong to &quot;The Excelsior Academy&quot;. The costs are EXTREMELY reasonable (we pay $165 for the entire family--there is more than one option for services, too) and Wendy (the director) completely &quot;gets&quot; unschooling and works with us to make sure our one yearly report to the county is easy on us. If you put &quot;Growing With Unschooling&quot; as your review group you&#39;d be in my small group. Let me know if you have any questions, or you can contact Wendy at any of the following places:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wendy Bush, Executive Director<br/>
The Excelsior Academy<br/>
P.O. Box 300<br/>
Odenton, MD 21113<br/>

GOOD LUCK! And hope to meet you soon.</div>
