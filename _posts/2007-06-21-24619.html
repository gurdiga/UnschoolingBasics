<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096483646">Hi Folks!<br/>
<br/>
Please pardon the cross-posting, but I wanted to make sure I got this <br/>
word out to as many folks as possible.  I may be completely off my <br/>
rocker, but I have just started a Yahoo list for radical unschoolers <br/>
in New York.  It&#39;s called &quot;Radical UNschoolers in NY (RUNNY!).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested, here&#39;s a link:<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
