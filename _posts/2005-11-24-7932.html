<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504650173">&quot;My dh and I want to find a really good book about the<br/>
Roman empire and find out more about Titus Pullo<br/>
<br/>
and Lucius Vorianus (sp?), how much was their story embellished and<br/>
how much was true :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in religion (as I am), then look up some info. on <br/>
Constantine while you&#39;re at it, and his effect on Christianity. And <br/>
the Gnostics, that&#39;s some interesting stuff too.<br/>
