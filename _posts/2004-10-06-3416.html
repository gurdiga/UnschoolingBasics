I think I understand what you are saying.  While four - six more years at<br/>
home doesn&#39;t sound like much, a lot can change in that short time,<br/>
especially for a teen.<br/>
<br/>
Although I believe my 13 yo is experiencing something sort of like<br/>
de-schooling, de-parental controlling I guess, he has never been to school.<br/>
We&#39;ve relaxed homeschooled since the beginning.  Over the years we dabbled<br/>
in a little bit of commercial math curriculum and last year in a desparate<br/>
attempt to broaden his horizons,  I started assigning him daily reading and<br/>
practice in subjects like math, science, history, a foreign language and<br/>
critical thinking.  On one hand he seemed to appreciate the direction my<br/>
assignments gave him and he dutifully worked through the assignments each<br/>
day.  He seemed adept at managing his time on a daily and weekly basis.  At<br/>
that same time he was attending our local Jr. High band class, playing<br/>
saxophone in the after-school jazz band and taking private lessons on his<br/>
clarinet. The number of performances and competition increased considerably<br/>
and this made him uneasy as well as interfering with the regularly scheduled<br/>
homeschool friend time that we&#39;d established over the years.<br/>
<br/>
He also was helping a group of friends (homeschoolers in a<br/>
home-school-assistance program) prepare for a literary competition in weekly<br/>
book discussion meetings. He was and is Treasurer for his homeschool 4-H<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
In January he got sick and we struggled along starting back up again with<br/>
our routine only to have him get worse and have to drop back out.  This went<br/>
on for several months and over that time he grew more and more resistant to<br/>
returning to band at all.  He was so anxious that he&#39;d fallen behind his<br/>
bandmates and was afraid of messing up and embarrassing himself.  Even<br/>
though he was one of the best clarinetists in the band, he did not want to<br/>
continue.  We decided to call it quits for the school year in April.<br/>
<br/>
You asked what he is passionate about.  Passion is a strong emotion.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure that he feels strongly enough about anything to call it a passion<br/>
but I know that he enjoys reading and playing role-playing-game video games<br/>
more than just about anything else. At one time, for the first couple of<br/>
years, I think he was passionate about playing music. A typical day for him,<br/>
if it doesn&#39;t involve social outings, consists of reading, playing imaginary<br/>
fantasy-like games with his sister, video games, more reading, more video<br/>
games, helping a little around the house, reading to his sister, and more<br/>
video games.<br/>
<br/>
He seems to be aware that there is a lot of interesting stuff to learn<br/>
about.  I think he worries about being left behind by his more structured<br/>
homeschool mates.  His age-mate friends, who have homeschooled their entire<br/>
lives are all now either going to school part-time (in talented and gifted<br/>
programs) or seriously considering attending high-school beginning next<br/>
year. He has no desire whatsoever to go to high school, thankfully, but I<br/>
believe that he is secretly comparing himself, a relatively naive, sensitive<br/>
and self-sheltered kiddo to his friends who are out there achieving academic<br/>
accolades, socially gregarious and quite clued into the complexities of the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that my responses here are too long, but I&#39;m hoping that by painting<br/>
a detailed picture, someone will be able to offer their experience or<br/>
suggestions and others may be able to gain something that helps in their own<br/>
struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Gratefully,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Thirteen is still young. At 13, Cameron was still in his weird deschooling<br/>
&gt; vegetative state. It wasn&#39;t until he was 14 that things really started to<br/>
&gt; happen. Fifteen (and with a car!) was a whirlwind----and now at 16, he&#39;s SO<br/>
&gt; thoughtful and capable and sure of himself----and we can&#39;t keep up with him at<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most children (and especially schooled children) seem to struggle a bit  from<br/>
&gt; 12-14. I think the unschooled ones come out more &#39;whole&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At 13.5, you have a LOT of time....and no time at all! &lt;G&gt; But I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; concentrate more on the &#39;a lot of time&#39;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What passions does he have?<br/>
