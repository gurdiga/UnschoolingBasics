<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919589432"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m vacillating between fuming mad and bursting into tears and trying to be <br/>
&gt;calm.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>========<br/>
{{{breathe.  deep long breaths}}}<br/>
<br/>
It can be very frustrating to feel powerless - you have no control other <br/>
people (including your kids). Can you feel the relief of this truth?<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo will say to me when i am frustrated - mommy take a deep breath and <br/>
give me 3 kisses.  This brings me right back to what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
&lt;&lt;We had plans to go to a friends&#39; house for a playdate. They have children <br/>
all my kids&#39; ages, but our two oldest are particularly good friends and we <br/>
don&#39;t get to get together terribly often (1-2 times per month). My middle ds <br/>
(7yo) has just announced that he&#39;s not going and locked himself in my <br/>
bedroom. Won&#39;t let me in to talk. (I can&#39;t unlock the door from the <br/>
outside.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
When my younger dd shuts herself into a room i sit outside the door until <br/>
she comes our or is willing to let me in.  While she initially runs away, <br/>
i&#39;ve learned from her that she wants to know that i am still very much <br/>
present and available in her upset.  All it takes is time.   (is there any <br/>
harm in arriving later at your friends house for this play date?)<br/>
<br/>
For future planning - Was this date planned with everyone in agreement to <br/>
start with?  Had he been consulted on the plans in advance?  Was he involved <br/>
in something more important to him when it was time to leave?  Do you have <br/>
any idea why he is resistant to going?<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In many ways he&#39;s doing much better than he was a couple months ago, but <br/>
this is a new one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
are you referring to your 7yo or eldest?<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My eldest is understandably upset and feeling manipulated and mistreated. <br/>
We don&#39;t have neighbors to play with, so we&#39;re dependent on playdates and <br/>
other activities to see friends at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
For future planning:   Can you make a date that doesn&#39;t include the younger <br/>
sib?  Can the child of the other family come to your house?<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been working so hard trying to help him feel that we&#39;re on his side, <br/>
trying to find ways to do the things he wants, but he doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
believe it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
Again, don&#39;t know exactly which ds you are referring to - regardless, when <br/>
my kids are frustrated because they want to go in different directions - the <br/>
language i use in this situation is &quot;you are both very important - both of <br/>
you - i know we can come up with a solution that will work for everyone.&quot;  <br/>
Maintaining my equilibrium is really important to their trusting the <br/>
outcome.  And then we brainstorm together.  The day may turn out completely <br/>
different than originally planned but if you are relaxed, open and flexible <br/>
it may help your children to move through their feelings of anger and <br/>
frustration.  Again, it means taking the time to sort out what everyone <br/>
needs - next time you can plan in advance the day differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038598786">My 7 yo ds doesn&#39;t like to go anywhere either.  He goes grudgingly <br/>
when he doesn&#39;t have a choice.  I&#39;ve listened to a lot of yelling <br/>
from him about it.  But he has never locked himself in a room and <br/>
refused to go.  That&#39;s a hard one.  I don&#39;t really have much to say <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225121659">Boy, Rachel, do I remember those days.  My eldest ds, now nearly 11,<br/>
was that way from about 3 yrs to 9 yrs.  He hated lotion (it made him<br/>
itchy), so we switched to Gold Bond powder and after awhile, he<br/>
stopped needing it.  I can&#39;t remember what socks we bought at that<br/>
age, but the seams were good.  He used to say &quot;I&#39;m having a sock<br/>
problem&quot;.   Also had a problem with collars... <br/>
<br/>
And I thought those years were tough...LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483017188">Thanks, Lisa and Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
Glad to know I&#39;m not alone in having a child (or two -- my 4yo is leaning this way too) who doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere (or at least, very, very often doesn&#39;t:-).<br/>
<br/>
In this case, going later really wasn&#39;t an option, although certainly other times it might be.  We did end up having a pleasant afternoon anyway.  I held my eldest while he (and I as well, but quietly) cried.   Told 7yo that we were sad -- 10yo b/c of not going and me b/c of not going but also b/c I could tell that he was feeling angry about going and I didn&#39;t really know why (or something like that).  Then 10yo and I read together for awhile, by which point 7yo had unlocked the door.  When he came out, we all built bridges with K&#39;nex.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the one sentence I spoke through the door, I never said anything more about it to my 7yo.  Just gave him a hug when I saw him again after he&#39;d come out.  I&#39;m not sure if I should try to talk with him about it.  He tends to cover his face, trying not to smile.  If I ask questions trying to get at what was going on for him or what we could do differently to help him, he just says, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do generally try to look for ways my 7yo doesn&#39;t have to go places if he doesn&#39;t want to.  Sometimes he can go to dh&#39;s office or dh can come home to work.  Sometimes I can get a ride to/from an activity for my oldest (or dh can take him).  But there are times when, in order to get 10yo to karate, the younger boys and I need to take him or pick him up.<br/>
<br/>
This raises a broader question or two I&#39;ve been wondering recently:  how do others with multiple children (but no-one old enough to stay home alone or with littler ones) handle making decisions to go someplace?  Do others with a child (or more) who generally don&#39;t like to go places and/or are very shy worry about it?  It seems very limiting, not just for the rest of us, but also for the child who wants to stay at home (and usually, inside). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564857194">This is a hard one.  In my case, my 7yo is the oldest.  With twin <br/>
toddlers, it is easier for us to just stay home.  We stay home as <br/>
much as possible - which is almost all the time.  If we have to go <br/>
pick up/ drop off, I try to make it as painless as possible for <br/>
him.  He&#39;ll sometimes stay in the car while I run in (it&#39;s better if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t have to wear shoes!). My 5yo is very social and loves to <br/>
go places and be with people.  He just recently started going to <br/>
Judo with my DH.  He seems happy about it (although I hate <br/>
competitive sports for young children).  I try to run all errands <br/>
while DH is home -- which sometimes means groceries at midnight.  <br/>
And I take one or two of the younger ones with me on other trips.  I <br/>
have to admit, we would probably go to the zoo and the park a lot <br/>
more often if my 7yo was willing.  He has made it very clear that he <br/>
does not like going anywhere.  For some reason he just needs to be <br/>
home.  But my other children are young enough that they are happy <br/>
being home too.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who says parkdays and get togethers with other <br/>
unschoolers are more for the moms than the kids.  I think she&#39;s <br/>
right.  We need some adult human contact.  I&#39;m glad I at least have <br/>
the internet for some interaction with other moms.<br/>

those moments - especially if another child is hurting.  But that is <br/>
when they need your understanding the most.  I suppose in time, he <br/>
will be able to tell you why.  At least he has the freedom to be <br/>
honest about his needs.<br/>

at home with our neighbor. The neighbor&#39;s a bit more of the: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
the adult so we&#39;re doing it my way&quot; persuasion, but Mo likes her, so <br/>
I&#39;m reasonably comfortable with the situation. <br/>
<br/>
If/when we don&#39;t have that option, I load up the car with a whole <br/>
bunch of stuff for Mo to do *in* the car to make the trip more <br/>
palatable to her - she might want to get out and play or socialize <br/>
wherever we are going, but I don&#39;t count on it. The portable DVD <br/>
player helps to sweeten this a Lot - unfortunately it&#39;s having <br/>
technical problems at the moment, so I have to look for other ways <br/>
for Mo to get her needs met. Packing toys or books she hasn&#39;t seen <br/>
for awhile helps, or stopping to get something new at the dollar <br/>
store. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Some people need to watch or otherwise &quot;take in&quot; a new environment <br/>
for a period of time before interacting - that&#39;s usually considered <br/>
a problem, but its a way of learning. Mo needs to watch people for <br/>
awhile before she&#39;ll interact (&quot;shy&quot;), but will launch herself into <br/>
a physical situation with no hesitation. Her best pal is exactly the <br/>
opposite - she&#39;ll run up to complete strangers and start a <br/>
conversation, but hold back and need to watch Mo (or someone else <br/>
she knows) *do* something physical before trying it. <br/>
<br/>
Going new places or meeting new people can be stressful. Both Mo and <br/>
her pal will opt to stay home if they aren&#39;t up for the stress of <br/>
dealing with &quot;newness&quot;. I work around that as much as I can with Mo -<br/>
 I feel the same way, myself pretty often, so staying home is just <br/>
fine with me. *I* don&#39;t feel limited by staying home most of the <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson&#39;s a lot more social, though, so we&#39;re working on finding <br/>
ways for him to get *out* more that also respect Mo&#39;s needs - mostly <br/>
finding people-resources, in our case.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703758621">I have a 7 year old that hates to go places.  I let him know far in advance that we have to go someplace.  Then if he says he doesn&#39;t want to go I say we can try the neighbors we have that can watch him.  I also mention that if they are not home or not available that he will have to come.  When I can each of the 3, I make sure he is in earshot so that he know. After I finish the call I let him know if I was able to talk with the potential &#39;sitter&#39; or if I left a message.  I also try and say something that lets him know I am doing everything I can to honor his need.  If all else fails, he had to come with us. I try and make sure he has food and a toy(s) for the car and trip.  If he is aware of all that I try and do for him, he&#39;s ok with going (not happy with it, but not complaining either).  This has been the case for over 6 months now...hoping for him to find a solution within himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417117566">I have a few kids as well who don&#39;t always like to go places. My 12 year old is old enough <br/>
to stay home, and since he&#39;s done his first aid training he will keep the 8 yo OR the 7yo <br/>
home with him if they don&#39;t want to go. I try to not do both at the same time since they <br/>
tend to squabble until violence occurs. We also have a neighbor who works irregular <br/>
hours, so I can always call and ask them to walk over to keep an eye on kids. <br/>
<br/>
But generally we sweeten the pot until everyone wants to go. Playdate? well, if you can <br/>
suck it up for an hour with your gameboy, DS or library book, then I think it would be fair <br/>
to stop for a smoothie. Library? Well, take what you want to play with, and you can play <br/>
while everyone else is looking. We try to keep it shorter if people didn&#39;t want to go, and we <br/>
take a ton of treasures to keep people busy. The extra trips usually double our time out of <br/>
the house, especially if Josh says, &quot;Well, I want to go but only if we can stop by Borders,&quot; <br/>
and Emily says &quot;I want to swing by Toys R Us and see how much X, Y and Z is&quot;, and Rachel <br/>
want&#39;s the icee from 7-11, but Sam want&#39;s a smoothie from Braums, and Breanna want&#39;s <br/>
the mall and the candy store. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably also some remnant of our mommy/kid dates too, that they just like to get out <br/>
of the house. Having choices on what to do when out helps a lot. <br/>

rest of us, but also for the child who wants to stay at home (and usually, inside). </span></blockquote></div>
