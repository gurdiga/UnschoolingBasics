<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196893663">More comments on the 2.5 yr old hitting...<br/>
My son who is now almost 6 used to hit, and push, and just run over  &into <br/>
other kids at that age.  He had what I&#39;d call very little body  awareness & also <br/>
did not talk well then.  I know the original poster  said her dd can speak <br/>
very well, but that doesn&#39;t always mean that very young  kids can communicate <br/>
all that they are feeling.<br/>
At that time, we were feeling very overwhelmed ( I also had an infant)  & I <br/>
liked going to play groups to get out of the house and connect with  other <br/>
moms.  It became clear that ds was just not ready for playgroups,  Mommy & Me, <br/>
etc.  Often even one other child was too much for him. So,  we backed off on the <br/>
playgroups (that was easy to do after we were asked not to  return to a few, I <br/>
was mortified).<br/>
We also had to stop going to the library story time and things like that  not <br/>
only because he was hitting but he would also RUN away as soon as I started  <br/>
to pay attention to someone else (like while checking out books- would run <br/>
right  out the front door of the library if I wasn&#39;t fast enough).<br/>
It did of course cut into my SAHM social life, but it was what ds needed at  <br/>
that point in time.  Now at 5 3/4 he has friends, goes to the neighbors  house <br/>
for the day, etc- very few problems if any.<br/>
So, some kids just take longer to figure out all the social stuff.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t force the play groups if she doesn&#39;t seem ready, since it&#39;s obviously  not <br/>
working out. Also, if we were invited to friends for dinner who had kids or  <br/>
something like that, we were &quot;always right on top of him&quot; to make sure no one  <br/>
got hurt, AND had to be willing to leave in the middle of things if they <br/>
weren&#39;t  goin well.<br/>
Good luck<br/>
