<div id="ygrps-yiv-656356499">Hi Zoa,<br/>
<br/>
My son tells me that the xBox is intended for an older audience and was<br/>
designed to handle more sophisticated graphics.  Because of that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
have many games that a really young child would enjoy.  He recommends the<br/>
Wii and the Nintendo DS for younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, my 11yo daughter will play his Wii games with him (they especially<br/>
love Wii Sports and the various incarnations of Mario) and wants her own DS,<br/>
but doesn&#39;t play his xBox games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857626860">My son is 7yo - but has been playing xbox for a year or two now. He<br/>
started off with the racing - I think it&#39;s called project gotham. Now<br/>
he really enjoys sports - hockey & baseball in particular, but alos<br/>
has golf & football. You can get Shrek & other movie games too. They<br/>
are super cheap at gamestop when you get them used. Some of the sports<br/>
games we got for 99 cents!<br/>
<br/>
I was told XBox was for older kids too - but I think there are plenty<br/>
of games for younger kids. My son also has a gamecube & he goes back &<br/>
forth between the two, constantly comparing what is better in one vs<br/>
the other. He also has a Wii, but doesn&#39;t like it nearly as much as<br/>
the other two systems. He can give you a list of reasons why!<br/>

<br/>
When Duncan was five-ish, I went looking for a system for him. I asked <br/>
everyone I knew that played. They all, to a man, agreed that the X-box <br/>
was, by far, the best system available. It was brand new, and everyone <br/>
was so excited about its graphics. I didn&#39;t bat an eye when I bought it.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t ask any five year olds!<br/>
<br/>
There were NO games for littluns at that time. But the adult games were <br/>
awesome! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s now 12, and I&#39;m sure there are better games for younger <br/>
children, but we are past that stage now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure someone here will have some good game suggestions. But I would <br/>
have bought a used PS2 or a Wii (if it had been out then) if I had it <br/>
to do over again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264484665">A WII is $250 or more.  A gamecube is, in our area at pawn shops, about $60.  My kids, ages 8 and 11 now, have enjoyed their gamecubes very mich. They now have a WII and they sometimes still choose to play their gamecube or even their  nintendo 64. The Nintendo systems have more kid-recommended games (at least in my experience) than the ps or xbox.  My 14 yo is starting to want a different system, though.  The games I&#39;ve seen them enjoy by age 5 were:  Animal Crossing,  Harvest Moon - both versions(with some reading help), Billy Hatcher,  Super Mario Sunshine and Paper Mario.  These games were available at pawn shops or ebay for about $10 to $20.    Oh, also Donkey Kong games and enhanced Pac Man.  Lots of fun.  Cameron  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-598612383">We have a Wii, PS2, Nintendo 64, and a DS (that the whole family has<br/>
to share at the moment, which does NOT work well).  We have a 9-yo<br/>
daughter and a 3-yo son.  The Wii is very popular with the 3-yo, and<br/>
probably would be with our daughter if she didn&#39;t have to put up with<br/>
her brother begging for a turn every time she touched it.  No one<br/>
seems to give a hoot about the Nintendo any more, nor the horrible,<br/>
always-breaking V-Smile I forgot to mention earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The DS is in constant demand, so I&#39;m really hoping to buy a couple<br/>
more of those, used.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have specific recommendations for games, since I decided a<br/>
while ago to &quot;draw the line&quot; at the Xbox, since we have so darn many<br/>
already.  I&#39;m not a gamer at all (I don&#39;t handle interruptions well,<br/>
as I get hyper-focused on things, so I prefer to not even bother right<br/>
now.)  But now I&#39;m starting to think... why not?  If we can get an<br/>
Xbox rather cheap... maybe we should?<br/>
<br/>
The Wii *is* expensive, and I still can&#39;t get over how much the games<br/>
cost.  But it&#39;s very, very, very user-friendly.  I would play it more,<br/>
but I had earned all kinds of medals on one game when our<br/>
then-2-year-old accidentally erased all my records.  Since there<br/>
aren&#39;t removable memory cards for that sort of thing (at least, not to<br/>
my knowledge), I haven&#39;t bothered getting into it again.  I like the<br/>
idea of the Wii Fit game, though.  I need that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948691182">The newer game systems are expensive for a lot of reasons, like their great<br/>
graphics -- which in my experience most 5yos don&#39;t care much about.  Those<br/>
systems also connect to the Internet.  That&#39;s an extremely cool feature.<br/>
Withe the xBox you have to pay a yearly fee for the privilege, but my son<br/>
loves it.  He plays games with his friends locally and with people all over<br/>
the world, and can download games directly from Microsoft or Nintendo.  But,<br/>
that may not be a feature that your 5yo is ready for (or that you&#39;re ready<br/>
for).<br/>
<br/>
 Here&#39;s what I&#39;m saying:  the newer systems have more features that many<br/>
5yos may never use.  I think getting a used Gamecube or a PS2 would be a<br/>
great idea.  There are lots of cheap used games available for those systems<br/>
from GameStop, Blockbuster, and eBay.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I wouldn&#39;t pass up a chance at a Nintendo 64, either.  Some of<br/>
the games that my son downloads for his Wii are the Nintendo 64 versions of<br/>
early games.  The N64 was the first console we bought for him, and<br/>
he&#39;s missed it ever since he traded up.  In fact, when he was about 9 or 10,<br/>
he bought a GameCube (the first thing he ever saved up for).  He also bought<br/>
some votive candles and conducted a very solemn ceremony in which he helped<br/>
the spirit of his N64 transfer to the GameCube.   That&#39;s when I began to<br/>
understand how important gaming is in my son&#39;s life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474828054">Actually, there are memory cards for the Wii.  They are the same card<br/>

copies.  they make some specifically for the Wii, but they are more<br/>
expensive.  You can just buy a generic one.  <br/>

You could try the games that send the child on adventures <br/>

also spryo ( haven&#39;t played that myself though) and most animated <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929656789">We belong to a video game rental program called Gamefly (www.gamefly.com)<br/>
that works just like Netflix.  Our plan gives us 2 games out at a time, for<br/>
as long as we want.  They have games for all the major systems, including<br/>
the DS.  It&#39;s a wonderful way to get newer games, and try out games before<br/>
buying.  Many of their games are available for purchase at a discounted<br/>
price too, in case we absolutely *love* the game and want to keep it.<br/>

Yep.  Definitely wii games.  And I&#39;ll give a big plug again for Rayman <br/>
Raving Rabbids 2, which my kids (7 amd 5) LOVE, especially when playing <br/>
together.<br/>

Why would you have bought a PS2? Just wondering...<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether this was aimed at me or not; but I think I did <br/>
write that, if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten a PS2 for <br/>
my then five year old.<br/>
<br/>
More little kid-friendly. LOTS more games that he would have liked. At <br/>
the time, the Xbox was brand new, and the games were all adult games <br/>
that he didn&#39;t like. The PS2 had all the *cool* games that he wanted. <br/>
At the time, I didn&#39;t understand all the ins and outs of gaming and the <br/>
different systems. &lt;G&gt; All the adults I spoke with LOVED the Xbox. But <br/>
*they* didn&#39;t play little kid games on it!<br/>
<br/>
PS2 had/has lots and lots of great games for littluns.<br/>
<br/>
We have a bunch of systems now---I think all but the old Nintendo and <br/>
the new PS3. But everything in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also second the subscription to Gamefly. Being able to try the <br/>
games first saves us big bucks in the long run. Some of the games <br/>
Duncan would buy would be &quot;done&quot; in an afternoon. Renting them for <br/>
weeks at a time keeps a steady stream of new and fun games in the house <br/>
all the time. If he likes them, he can buy the Gamefly one he has or go <br/>
down to Game Crazy. If it&#39;s too easy or too hard or just not what he <br/>
wants, we can shove it right back into its envelope and order a new <br/>
one. (Thanks, Gail, for that recommendation a few years ago!! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
