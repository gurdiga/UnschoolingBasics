<div id="ygrps-yiv-215337632">I&#39;m glad to be on this list because I have TONS of newbie questions.  One of them being:  I&#39;m concerned about images in the media, especially tv.   As an African American I find many of the images of of African Americans to be derrogatory and demeaning.  Add to that the &quot;standard of beauty&quot; which is usually white skin and straight, long hair.  My stepdaughter already has issues with her beauty.  She is overweight, dark skinned, with short kinky hair.  She does not see herself reflected in our society&#39;s &quot;beauty&quot;, and has resorted to buying wigs and such to look &quot;pretty&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m concerned for my younger daughter and my sons.  Often black males are portrayed as criminals or thugs, and black females as sex-crazed gold-diggers.  That is NOT the totality of our community, and I don&#39;t want those images to be the ones they associate with.  Also, for my 7-yr-old daughter, I don&#39;t want her to think that to be beautiful she has to have straight hair.  There is already too much discussion in my home about the differences in the skin colors of my children (really, it&#39;s by small degrees), and my stepdaughter thinks my hair and my daughter&#39;s hair is &quot;so nice&quot; and doesn&#39;t like her hair at all.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this list is largely Caucasian, and may not be able to relate to what I am saying.  But if you can, and/or if you are African American or raising African American children, what, if anything, do you do to deal with the negative images in the media while allowing your children freedom with the television?<br/>

<br/>
Being part of the fashion industry (part of the &quot;machine&quot; in a sense)<br/>
I totally understand where you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s not just African<br/>
American girls that are sent crazy messages of course, my sister just<br/>
last night said something about wishing she had long legs like me.<br/>
ARGH!!! NO, ALL different bodies and looks are beautiful. It makes me<br/>
feel nuts when clients don&#39;t really believe that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about the images they see in the media though. They are<br/>
smart cookies and can really begin to decipher anything remotely<br/>
false. We discuss these things. I DO judge some of the messages we see<br/>
on television without judging the act of watching the show. I point<br/>
out how men are constantly portrayed as bumbling idiots or<br/>
self-serving jerks.  <br/>
I don&#39;t want my boys to thing all of society really views men this<br/>
way, it&#39;s just popular television right now (as the pendulum swings, eh?).<br/>
<br/>
They see it. They laugh about it, we discuss issues surrounding this<br/>
and they notice more than I do most of the time. One of the<br/>
discussions we&#39;ve had is about black super-heroes. How many of those<br/>
were around? We saw a show with an African-American super hero and my<br/>
kids were like &quot;it&#39;s about TIME!!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
The messages your children receive at home hold far more weight than<br/>
media images. Truly. There is good programming with altruistic people<br/>
of many races now. There are wonderful art books with all sorts of<br/>
body types available, even in the fashion industry.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone interested in body art, MAC and Assouline teamed up to<br/>
create an amazing book.  All the models are nude, with a variety of<br/>
body art displayed. There are male, female, transgendered, black,<br/>
white, Native American, straight, gay, large, small, young and old<br/>
models. It&#39;s awesome. <br/>
<br/>
You can seek out people and experiences that will help her see the<br/>
beauty in diversity. You can discuss from whence those messages in the<br/>
media came. You can BE a strong and beautiful role model for her that<br/>
is completely comfortable with her own body and looks. Trust.....<br/>

<br/>
Most groups are ridiculed on tv. If you&#39;re blonde<br/>
you&#39;re a ditz; if you&#39;re male you&#39;re stupid and only<br/>
care about beer and looking at women; etc, etc. Our<br/>
family (cousins and aunts/uncles) is mixed racially<br/>
and so we tend to notice racial stereotypes (as well<br/>
as sexist, ageist, cultural etc).<br/>
<br/>
The way we handle it is to discuss the stereotypes and<br/>
how limited they are as we watch the shows. We try not<br/>
to watch ones that are over the top, but don&#39;t<br/>
prohibit any shows. We&#39;ve been discussing the limits<br/>
of the programs and what they show, compared to the<br/>
real people we know and real experiences in our lives,<br/>
since my son was quite small. <br/>
<br/>
The shows provide lots to discuss and are a shared<br/>
experience to respond to. Grist for the mill and<br/>
unfortunately some of the negative stuff in this world<br/>
that our kids need to be aware of and to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, sign ups for the computer--a sheet<br/>
that shows the times available and gives equal time<br/>
(or however you want to schedule) for<br/>
access--sometimes works. It&#39;s an device to help divide<br/>
the time and an external reference for how many turns,<br/>
how much time each person has had (as opposed to he<br/>
said, she said). Also a timer really does work. My son<br/>
sets one and likes responding to it better than me<br/>
coming and telling him about it being time to go, or<br/>
have dinner or whatever.<br/>

 <br/>
Hi Maisha!  I cannot answer for your specific question, but I think  most of <br/>
us deal with some sort of stereotype.  I am overweight and my  daughter has <br/>
started asking me questions why I don&#39;t look like everybody  else.  She said she <br/>
couldn&#39;t decide when she grows up if she wants a big  giant round tummy like <br/>
mine or a straight one like her friends&#39; moms.   LOL!<br/>
 <br/>
A friend of mine has eating disorders and she started Tivo&#39;ing the craft  <br/>
shows that she enjoyed with her 10 year old daughter so she could skip the  <br/>
commercials......every single one was about losing weight!  It was just too  much!<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with Ren that how we live our own lives will speak more loudly to  <br/>
our children.  That is a challenge that is for me as it concerns my  appearance. <br/>
 I do try not to talk about diets and losing weight but focus  on discussing <br/>
healthy choices, but I feel like I&#39;m fighting a losing battle  sometimes.  Am <br/>
I teaching &quot;fat is bad&quot;?  The media does and I&#39;m  probably supporting that <br/>
message with my own insecurity.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve put something in my mind about how our children watch us.  My  husband <br/>
and I were wanting some take-out Japanese food our local  restaurant.  He <br/>
asked me to call and I said &quot;no, I don&#39;t understand that  lady on the phone!&quot;  <br/>
So, although I have no prejudice against the woman but  a frustration with the <br/>
situation, I wonder what messages I am accidentally  giving my children.  Hmmm. <br/>
  I think I&#39;ll be more aware of  that.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and by the way, my dark-haired daughter wants to be blond.   Perhaps some <br/>
of our children&#39;s desire to &quot;be different&quot; is just that.   Wanting to <br/>
experience something else or emulate a friend.  When I was six,  I asked my mom to <br/>
call me Christina.....I just loved that pretty blond  well-mannered Christina <br/>
that sat behind me in class.  :)  <br/>

<br/>
How is coloring your hair being uncomfortable with who you are? We are<br/>
so much more than color or style. Being authentic has little to do<br/>
with looks and everything to do with following your heart and being<br/>
true to yourself.<br/>
I LOVE coloring my hair. My kids do too. We love color on hair, faces<br/>
and in clothing. We see it as art, no different than painting a canvas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at the history of human beings and decided that adornment<br/>
of the body is a very natural thing. Since the beginning of time,<br/>
humans have enjoyed displaying colors and art in their homes and on<br/>
their bodies. There is  nothing wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a big difference between expressing yourself with<br/>
clothing or makeup/hairstyles and being unhappy with your looks. When<br/>
a child hears &quot;I am so fat&quot; or &quot;I hate my hair&quot; or &quot;I wish I looked<br/>
like _____&quot; THAT&#39;S sending the wrong messages. Being happy with who we<br/>
are and how we look today, is how we help our children be comfortable<br/>
with their own unique looks. Expressing oneself with adornment or<br/>
color is one way to be true to oneself. Sometimes we feel colorful and<br/>
beautiful inside, but we don&#39;t express that. I love expressing my<br/>
inner self with adornment.</div>

turned brown (as hers probably will). I don&#39;t like me with brown hair. Okay,<br/>
I&#39;ve come to terms with that. I&#39;ve made friends with my hair color because<br/>
it&#39;s what I look like. I&#39;m short (can&#39;t do anything about that), fat (okay,<br/>
I can eat healthier) and old (again I can try to stay healthy) but that is<br/>
who I am. I am also smart, funny, insightful and caring. I&#39;m just not a<br/>
blond anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we also color all over ourselves but we know it&#39;s not who we are it&#39;s<br/>
how we look now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071487888">Welcome Maisha...<br/>
<br/>
I have a white child and two biracial children (black/white). You <br/>
can see our picture on my blog (in my signature) if you&#39;d like. <br/>
<br/>
I actually have no issue with media images because our life is so <br/>
much more than TV. We discuss them (at great length sometimes) but <br/>
we expose ourselves to many types of people in our life that when <br/>
they see a stereotype portrayed on TV, they think it&#39;s funny. <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, the only stereotypical black images that are pushed on <br/>
us are from black families who want my two brown children to fit <br/>
some sort of mold. Again, we discuss this when this happens. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Italian and I&#39;m from New York City. Talk about a stereotype! <br/>
LOL!! Most images of Italians in the media are mafia related. It&#39;s <br/>
up to us, Italian-Americans, to change that. Media will reflect what <br/>
society thinks. The same is true for African-Americans. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t live our life in front of the tv so my kids know that what <br/>
they see is not all their is. <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re a child you can&#39;t think, don&#39;t have good judgement, you&#39;re<br/>
sneaky, careless, dishonest....<br/>
<br/>
***As an African American I find many of the images of of African<br/>
Americans to be derrogatory and demeaning.  ***<br/>
<br/>
We notice what we&#39;re sensitive about.   I notice when people treat kids<br/>
like idiots. <br/>
<br/>
If you could change your focus for an evening, watch TV *not* looking for<br/>
the demeaning depictions of African Americans ( and I understand your<br/>
point that one doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;looking&quot; for them, they *are*) but<br/>
look at depictions of moms or kids, or guys who drive trucks or whatever<br/>
I think you might feel better. (Worse? &lt;g&gt;)   <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll see the easiest way to create a *character* is to create<br/>
noticeable/extreme identifying personal traits. <br/>
<br/>
Have you seen that series &quot;Boston Legal?&quot;   None of those characters have<br/>
depth.  They *are* their quirks.  It makes for funny moments.  The<br/>
problem with really developing a character is that in order not to cheat<br/>
the viewer you have to keep true to that character.  If your writers<br/>
change, and the character changes, the viewer knows.   And if a character<br/>
has a few short scenes in a movie we need to know what kind of person<br/>
this is right away, there&#39;s not time for character development we need to<br/>
be able to *see* who this is.  The very easiest way for writers to do<br/>
that is to make that character&#39;s traits, whether good or bad, easily<br/>
visible.  <br/>
<br/>
This might be a good conversation to have with your kids. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Kids learn quickly and know forever that Television entertainment and<br/>
movies are not real.   Lots of moms worry about TV violence, for example<br/>
but take their kids to see Grandpa who will rage about shooting the<br/>
neighbor&#39;s dog next time it gets into the trash;  Or to see a cousin who<br/>
hits or bites or says mean things, etc.  Some people are so worried about<br/>
TV they don&#39;t look at the real images their kids are exposed to within<br/>
their own family (or, for those other people, &lt;g&gt; at school.)   <br/>
<br/>
All that stuff aside, your kids don&#39;t need to be alone in media.  They<br/>
have you.  You can watch with them and talk about why a certain character<br/>
is behaving this way or that, why they made this choice or that one in<br/>
context of the program.  You can talk about what the director intended<br/>
for a certain scene, whether it was effective, what the writers were<br/>
trying to convey, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of our most memorable conversations started because of a very<br/>
obvious character in a movie.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290312127">Well, we&#39;re about as white as you can get here, however, parts of my  <br/>
stepfamily are about as dark skinned as you can get. After sharing a  <br/>
bedroom with two stepsisters (one of whom had severe congenital  <br/>
defects anyway), I can tell you that they never had a problem with  <br/>
self esteem, after all the tv and magazines we saw, because they were  <br/>
revered and loved by their family. Being surrounded by tons of aunts,  <br/>
uncles, and probably the best set of grandparents *I&#39;ve* ever met,  <br/>
every one of the cousins felt loved and treasured. They did perms,  <br/>
and makeup, and we all spent a lot of time looking at teen magazines.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I loved was how Granma always took time to spend with her  <br/>
granddaughters, and always pointed out their best attributes. Not  <br/>
sitting down to make a list, but she spent a lot of time with all of  <br/>
us, and did things that we were good at, and helped us through things  <br/>
we weren&#39;t good at. She made sure to let us know that no one is  <br/>
perfect, and best of all she gave everyone such a good example of  <br/>
doing good things and having a strong belief in God.<br/>
<br/>
The most amazing thing to me about the American Standard of beauty is  <br/>
that NO one ever measures up. If it&#39;s not one thing, it&#39;s another.  <br/>
Even if you are white, then either your skin is too light or too  <br/>
dark, or you have freckles or blotches. I find stuff about women  <br/>
demeaning, I find stuff about autistic people in the media demeaning,  <br/>
I HATE the show &#39;Monk&quot; because they poke constant fun at someone  <br/>
about OCD. It&#39;s all so arbitrary, set up really just to make a buck.  <br/>
We talk about that too! Why are those jeans better now? Last week the  <br/>
commercial said you needed these jeans, what does that mean? Talk  <br/>
about people, &quot;Do you know anyone like that?&quot;, or &quot;Do you think  <br/>
that&#39;s a reasonable portrayal of a person?&quot;, or &quot;Why would the show  <br/>
want this guy to be like this?&quot; We watch a lot of tv together and  <br/>
talk about how people are different, and how they are the same. I  <br/>
make a lot of &#39;I&#39; statements, like &quot;Wow, that would really make me  <br/>
upset if someone did that&quot;, or &quot;That is a great way to solve a  <br/>
problem&quot; or &quot;How would you have handled that?&quot; and focus on how  <br/>
everyone makes mistakes, everyone can solve problems.<br/>
<br/>
What can you do to help your stepdaughter? If she doesn&#39;t like her  <br/>
hair can you perm it? Not much you can do about dark skin, but maybe  <br/>
emphasis how smooth it is, or even toned? Overweight goes across  <br/>
cultures, and might be part of her general dislike of herself. part  <br/>
of me wants to say it would be great if she could just love herself  <br/>
as her natural beauty, but it might take a while to get there. And  <br/>
maybe some cosmetic stuff would be a good bandaid for a while.  <br/>
Surrounding her with love, and reassurances is good. Doing stuff  <br/>
together as a family is good. What kind of activities are you  <br/>
involved in? Like church, or scouts, or service projects? Are there  <br/>
maybe mentoring programs she could get involved in? I&#39;d say get out  <br/>
in the community and find lots of people, spend a lot of time there  <br/>
to let her see that all kinds of people do all kinds of cool things,  <br/>
and just keep loving her! You won&#39;t see it now, or tomorrow, but in  <br/>
the long run, it&#39;s the best investment you can make. I&#39;m so glad you  <br/>
are here....and don&#39;t know that this helps any. Maybe you&#39;ll just  <br/>
read it and say &#39;another white girl who doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s  <br/>
talking about&#39; LOL! My ss&#39;s and I went round and round the first six  <br/>
months lol!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m glad to be on this list because I have TONS of newbie  <br/>
&gt; questions.  One of them being:  I&#39;m concerned about images in the  <br/>
&gt; media, especially tv.   As an African American I find many of the  <br/>
&gt; images of of African Americans to be derrogatory and demeaning.   <br/>
&gt; Add to that the &quot;standard of beauty&quot; which is usually white skin  <br/>
&gt; and straight, long hair.  My stepdaughter already has issues with  <br/>
&gt; her beauty.  She is overweight, dark skinned, with short kinky  <br/>
&gt; hair.  She does not see herself reflected in our society&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; &quot;beauty&quot;, and has resorted to buying wigs and such to look &quot;pretty&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m concerned for my younger daughter and my sons.  Often black  <br/>
&gt; males are portrayed as criminals or thugs, and black females as sex- <br/>
&gt; crazed gold-diggers.  That is NOT the totality of our community,  <br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t want those images to be the ones they associate with.   <br/>
&gt; Also, for my 7-yr-old daughter, I don&#39;t want her to think that to  <br/>
&gt; be beautiful she has to have straight hair.  There is already too  <br/>
&gt; much discussion in my home about the differences in the skin colors  <br/>
&gt; of my children (really, it&#39;s by small degrees), and my stepdaughter  <br/>
&gt; thinks my hair and my daughter&#39;s hair is &quot;so nice&quot; and doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
&gt; her hair at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that this list is largely Caucasian, and may not be able to  <br/>
&gt; relate to what I am saying.  But if you can, and/or if you are  <br/>
&gt; African American or raising African American children, what, if  <br/>
&gt; anything, do you do to deal with the negative images in the media  <br/>
&gt; while allowing your children freedom with the television? </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to jump in here.... we&#39;re not African American (we do have a bit <br/>
of a mixed extended family though, if that makes any dif). I do get really <br/>
sick of some of the images they have on TV. The images young girls get of what <br/>
they are &quot;supposed&quot; to look like is sickening. (And I agree Ren, men are <br/>
constantly portrayed as bumbling idiots or self-serving jerks, I guess the producers <br/>
feel they have to insult someone to be good and/or funny. &lt;sigh&gt; Lots of <br/>
commercials do it too!)  TV is an ongoing struggle within me as a parent. I am not <br/>
a fan of TV at all (I get bored & disgusted with it reeeeeeal easy) I have to <br/>
sort of force myself to keep my mouth shut sometimes when my girls are <br/>
watching, but I do however, open up when I see the MANY injustices there are on TV. <br/>
Our girls will also bring things up to us now that they question or feel is <br/>
wrong and we either laugh at how ridiculous it all is or, at times, it makes for <br/>
some good learning/growing conversation .....the rest of the time, like you <br/>
Joanne, we also expose ourselves to many types of people in our life and (thank <br/>
goodness)! our life is also so much more than TV. <br/>

My mom, born in 1922, did not see TV as a child.  Her folks got the<br/>

If none of us had TV we&#39;d still look at our friends or neighbors or<br/>
strangers on the street and think &quot;I like those shoes&quot; or &quot;I like that<br/>
hair style.&quot;  Or &quot;I wonder if I&#39;d look good in those jeans.&quot; <br/>

Yes, it is our nature to be attracted to beautiful things and to want to be <br/>

cosmetics and go barefoot &lt;BG&gt; (I love those kind of days:o) and I know that the <br/>

wrinkle cream. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
Mostly I don&#39;t mind the little irritations because the positive benefits<br/>

because *having* the shower is so divine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
