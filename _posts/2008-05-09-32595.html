What do you all do if you believe your child is capable of doing <br/>
something,<br/>
but feels reluctant?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I believe my boys are capable of doing anything and everything.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it&#39;s my job to accept that they *are* where they *are* at this <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage a lot. Sometimes they push themselves further. Sometimes <br/>
they don&#39;t. The deal is: *I* have to be OK with their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am not naturally a risk-taker.  I recognize that<br/>
comes a lot in part from the way I was raised.  My parents were<br/>
supercautious and often told us that things were dangerous or that <br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>

job I<br/>

homeschooling my children, and lots of smaller tasks.  Almost without <br/>
fail,<br/>
I have been delighted with the outcome of these &quot;risky&quot; behaviors.  But <br/>
I<br/>
still have to convince myself that I can do them.  It really helps me <br/>
when<br/>
others express confidence in me and encourage me to do these things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a HUGE risk-taker---not necessarily with physical harm (although <br/>
riding racehorses and hunter/jumpers IS fairly physically risky! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
or illegal stuff---more with &quot;what if&quot;---like new businesses and <br/>
conferences and keeping bees and planting a flower *there* and <br/>
traveling a LOT---stuff that won&#39;t get me hurt or imprisoned or cause <br/>
me too much physical pain.<br/>
<br/>
But my father *always* told me that I could do anything. Be anything. <br/>
And I believed him. I still do.<br/>
<br/>
So my boys see me model it. Taking risks is not without failures <br/>
though---and I have no problem owning up to my learning-takes. I&#39;ve <br/>
learned a lot from my failures---or maybe...&quot;unsuccesses&quot; is better. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d encourage. But I&#39;d hold no expectations that they should reach for. <br/>
They need to have their own expectations---not mine.<br/>
<br/>
If they are supported---wholly and unconditionally, they *will* take <br/>
risks---risks that *they* are comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I would tend to do that because I know<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
What you earned was his trust. He trusted you a little already---enough <br/>
to try it. Then his trust in you doubled because he found that you were <br/>
RIGHT!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s when our &quot;try-it-you&#39;ll-have-fun-I-promise&quot; encouragements have <br/>
*negative* outcomes. We LOSE credibility then. And that&#39;s really hard <br/>
to earn back.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I felt that without my encouragement, he would not have gone and would <br/>
have<br/>
missed out on a great experience.  What do you guys think?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again, if you KNOW you&#39;re right, it works well and can be empowering to <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
Used for your own goals and purposes, it can backfire and have <br/>
long-lasting negative results.<br/>
<br/>
My thought: use my influence *wisely*. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913143034">~~~What do you all do if you believe your child is capable of doing <br/>

<br/>
I tell my oldest son that fear is normal.  I tell him that being scared shouldn&#39;t stop someone from doing something, but rather to help us look at whatever we&#39;re afraid of in a different way, take baby steps, try something different, see something differently, try later etc.  Then I have stepped out of the way.  This has been HUGE for him!  He used to be told-don&#39;t be scared, you can do it!  He now knows that he CAN do anything (even when he is afraid), but it just might take some time to figure it out.  He is 5, and since I have told him this he has been on his first rollercoaster ride, started to swim underwater, started jumping into the pool, tries to catch a football (he was so scared of balls), started hanging from monkey bars, and talking to new people.  This has all happened in the past month!  His confidence is now on a major high!<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son is not reluctant at all.  I feel that some of it is in his personality, but the rest of his confidence has more to do with the different ways that I raised them in the beginning.<br/>
