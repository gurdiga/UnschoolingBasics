<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445511306">~~We ended up having a good laugh, made a delicious salad<br/>
for lunch and enjoyed a picnic together, with a couple stuffed<br/>
animals in attendance as well:)~~<br/>
<br/>
Cute.:)<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to hear children that are raised this way, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
They&#39;ll keep ya straight! When a &quot;good job&quot; slips out of my mouth,<br/>
Sierra laughs at me too. She might say &quot;we&#39;re not pets Mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me happy that they do catch some of my knee-jerk language,<br/>
because it means I don&#39;t do it often enough to be &quot;normal&quot;.:)<br/>
Cool.<br/>
