<div id="ygrps-yiv-327066506">&lt;&lt;She made some remark about the fact that she&#39;s reading too much stuff<br/>
 &quot;thats below my grade level.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi.  I just posted a chunk of books that I picked up around the house <br/>
and van that Sorscha (8) has been reading.  The reading levels range <br/>
the gambit from encyclopedias to preschool.  If you want to check it <br/>
out it is the first post on my blog right now.  Oh, and Sorscha <br/>
has &#39;collections&#39; of books from a series.  For example: Magic Tree <br/>
House, Secrets of Droon, and Warriors.  She loves to read those over <br/>
and over.  Her journey with reading is just about enjoying what she is <br/>
reading...not because it is a certain age level.  Reading Levels do not <br/>
matter when your not in school.  Also..I find it interesting that they <br/>
do not even post reading levels after 5th grade on books.  Wonder why <br/>
if they are so important??? If you really want to twist it around I <br/>
guess someone could say to Sorscha that reading an encyclopedia is <br/>
above her age level and that&#39;s a bad thing.  Whenever someone says <br/>
something that bugs me I try and twist it the other way.  Most of the <br/>
time it helps me to realize that it is nothing I need to matter with.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095673657">Thank you for your post!  I&#39;ve been wondering about how they mark grade levels in books as I can&#39;t find any for the books my son reads.<br/>
He&#39;s eight,too, and reads everything.  I worry more about &#39;adult content&#39; which also isn&#39;t marked.  (We have serious readers in our house with a range of interests so I have to always pay attention to what books get left around.  Grandma is 81 and forgetful.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625494406">Grandma is a MAJOR bookworm.  She reads everything; murder mystery&#39;s, romance (yes, the racier, the better), science, aeronautical science, literally everything.  She collects leather bound auto biographies and I&#39;ve been amazed at just what some men will describe.  (How to seduce a woman...)  Then there&#39;s the teenagers who likes gore.  I got to watch them, as they get a kick out of  putting gross pics on the slide show on the computer when I&#39;m at work.  One reads Manga, and every extreme culture she can find; Hitler, Vampires, Lost Boys (from Utah?)...the list is long.  We got her into Vonnegut and she loves him.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son (8) picked out the Halo trilogy and dived right in before I could read them, but a friend said they stayed to the Xbox game so I could relax.  That same day at the book store, he learned the difference between &#39;abridged and non-abridged&#39; and insisted he never wanted another abridged book again!  He picked out The Swiss Family Robinson unabridged, lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154575670">Good enough for me, too.  Even though we have been at this for about a year and a half and n the last 6 months ave given up bedtimes, food controls, etc.....Nobody seems to get it in my family.  I was pleasantly surprised recently when my sister (very traditional) asked my mother what we were doing differently now that &quot;school has started again&quot;.  My Mom said, &quot;Nothing....they&#39;re just living their lives.....&quot;  Yay, Mom!  She gets it! ( a 75 year old former public school teacher!)  I have often found that the older people understand a bit better and are perhaps less threatened by &quot;unschooling&quot;.  As for Grandma, for her the proof is in the pudding!<br/>
  Peace, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635729800">Most of our good friends can handle the unschooling thing, but yep, definately not Hubby&#39;s family.  I feel like just letting certain people know we homeschool is good enough too, and I don&#39;t have to elaborate any more than that to certain people.<br/>
