<div id="ygrps-yiv-877516418">Hello to everyone!  I would like to ask for good vibes and energy sent <br/>
to my family please.  We are currently displaced and need to get back <br/>
on our feet.  It&#39;s hard to unschool in someone else&#39;s house, ya know?  <br/>
And the pressure to conform is tremendous!!!!  I don&#39;t get to get on <br/>
the internet much, and I need, NEED your support!!  So just please <br/>
send prayers, reiki, light a candle, do a spell....whatever!  So that <br/>
we can get our own home and get back to the business of being our <br/>
crazy, wonderful, happy, peaceful selves.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

<br/>
Oooh...that is SO hard. I&#39;ll be thinking about you all a lot and<br/>
sending positive energy/thoughts your way. I hope the universe opens<br/>
wide and a wonderful house comes along.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361704326">Oh Maisha, I SO understand.  We are living with my sis, who is ultra <br/>
traditional, until we close on our house.  It is very hard tiptoeing <br/>
around at night, making sure the kids have their food in the kitchen <br/>
and such.  Very stressful at times!  Hang in there!!!!<br/>
