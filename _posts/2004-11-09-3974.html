<div id="ygrps-yiv-342014632">&quot;I didn&#39;t require them to do math for months and they<br/>
said they&#39;d rather me tell them to.  They like math,<br/>
but never choose to do and get frustrated when they<br/>
want to know how to multiply or divide and can&#39;t. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a sign of a child that has been taught they need someone <br/>
else to make them learn.<br/>
My unschooled children never think they need me to teach them <br/>
something in order for them to learn...they are fully aware they can <br/>
learn whatever they want, whenever they want and I am here to help <br/>
them find resources (or not) depending on the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled children are used to having others make them do things, <br/>
unschooled children learn all the time without feeling they need any <br/>
coercion in order to achieve something.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a few degrees away from really seeing it, but if you just <br/>
moved those few degrees away from schooling and towards unschooling, <br/>
you might be pleasantly surprised at just how incredible children <br/>
are and how much they learn with NO requirements.<br/>
