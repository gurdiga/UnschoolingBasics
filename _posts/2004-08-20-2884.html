set up a cozy bed for him in the kitchen and we went to bed.  And then the<br/>

but in a far corner w/ the fencing. Again with the wailing.  OK well I&#39;m<br/>
going to do something they say NEVER to do and put him right next to my side<br/>
of the bed, right at my head.  And off to sleep he went.  And that&#39;s how he<br/>
slept and even though he wasn&#39;t house broken for another 4 or so weeks, he<br/>
never had an accident while he was sleeping there.  They&#39;re pack animals and<br/>
need to be w/ their pack.  Of course you can bring a crate into the bedroom<br/>

About food: we left food out all the time so he could regulate himself which<br/>

been done.<br/>

I&#39;d like to hear more about &quot;unschooling training&quot; w a dog.  We went to a<br/>

feel good to do that.  I&#39;d love to hear how people do all that without the<br/>
yanking.  I let him off leash as much as possible and let his natural<br/>
tendency to follow take over.  Then for the rest of his life he was usually<br/>
off leash or on one of those long retractable leashes.  He would stay close<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934902317">I also think a lot of my AP tendencies came from owning a dog. My dog<br/>
definitely taught me that there are so many more levels of communication<br/>
than verbal ones, and that harsh discipline creates more problems than it<br/>
solves (and dissolves trust). It only took swatting my dog once to realize<br/>
that it wasn&#39;t for me, and that I would never spank my kids. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d consider it unschooling exactly, but clicker training is<br/>
considered to be a very gentle and positive way to train animals. <br/>

I haven&#39;t tried it myself, but I am planning to try it when we get our next<br/>
dog. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521052566">OH MY GOODNESS!<br/>
 <br/>
That is SO funny because I was just noticing the other day that we unschooled our dogs before we unschooled our children.  We went through the same things!  Got a new puppy and tried to do the training stuff but crates felt unnatural and as much as people said it would be better for them, I didn&#39;t get it.  I realized I found myself looking for ways to say yes whenever I could.  My dog likes to drink her water with her front paws in the bowl.  So we got a bigger more stable bowl because she&#39;d knock over the small one and lose all the water.  It was no big deal-the bowl didn&#39;t work for her and no she didn&#39;t do things like any other dog I&#39;d ever seen but so what?!  Who was she hurting by getting her paws wet when she drank?  NOBODY!  :)  And we were all less stressed and happy than if I had tried to teach her to drink without putting her paws in the bowl.<br/>
 <br/>
My friend loaned us a book called &quot;how to be a dog&#39;s best friend&quot; basically saying if you love your dogs you will discipline them and teach them complete obedience.  There are SO many correlations.  I just wish what we had done with the dogs just from instinct and being natural, I had done as naturally with my children.  I mean how many hours did we sit and fight over workbooks at the kitchen table?  When i should have just been looking for a bigger bowl and thinking &quot;no big deal.&quot;  :)  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I think the universe is a nifty place because I was just thinking about all of this the other day though i hadn&#39;t verbalized it.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing!<br/>
