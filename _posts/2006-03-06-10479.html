   Your post made me think... what stresses are there in unschooling?  I know<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for me it&#39;s completely stress free until someone butts there nose in and has<br/>
&gt; issues with it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering from all of you and from Reina, what stresses have you found<br/>
&gt; in unschooling?  Are there really any or is it just our &quot;schooled&quot;<br/>
&gt; perspective of it? <br/>

11 & 12 yo) We decided to just DEschool for a while and then, the more I read <br/>
and the more we saw for ourselves, meaning, just living life as unschoolers, <br/>
the more we realized how much this life works for us. Although I do believe we <br/>
are still somewhat deschooling, unschooling is working it&#39;s way into our lives <br/>
wonderfully. I can&#39;t think of any &quot;stresses&quot; I, my dh or even our kids have <br/>
from unschooling. We have normal every day stresses just as anyone else would <br/>
but I think with unschooling there is way less stress for us. When our girls <br/>
were in school there were plenty of stresses! They were always tired, stressed, <br/>
frustrated, rushed, worried about getting the grade & pleasing everyone they <br/>
felt they had to please in school, they were thirsty and hungry when they got <br/>
home and the social thing was TOTALLY over rated! Schools so called socializing <br/>
was full of stressful situations. <br/>
<br/>
Today we went to an open skate at the club they belong to (they&#39;re figure <br/>
skaters) so they could practice their routine they have to do for the next level <br/>
they are working on, we were the ONLY ONES on the ice! We had the place to <br/>
ourselves! No stresses there either! :o) I really can&#39;t think of anything <br/>
stressful from unschooling, except for, like you mentioned, when someone sticks their <br/>
nose into things, if it&#39;s in an unpleasant manner that is. When that happens <br/>
I think we&#39;re all getting a little better at trying to respond in a positive <br/>
way. My kids are so much more at peace with themselves than from when they were <br/>
in school. If anything, it has made life so much more stress free! They love <br/>
unschooling and are happier doing so, there is no way that could bring more <br/>
stress to us. <br/>
