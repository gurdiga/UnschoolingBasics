<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029845149">I think of this site and Always Learning as tough-love sites.<br/>
Tough for the uninitiated or the biased; but the moderators<br/>
are ALWAYS focused, fair and clear with their intention. <br/>
I have gained tremendous respect for Sandra, Joyce, Pam:<br/>
people I have never met but have learned immensely from.<br/>
- I will now brace myself for any replies :) <br/>
