<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753137983">wow, you miss a couple of days on this list and you are sooo out of the <br/>
loop! I&#39;ve been reading and catching up. I admire you guys (gals) that <br/>
can read and respond and know what&#39;s going on! I read the article in <br/>
People. Not nearly enough info about Ren and her family, but I liked <br/>
what I read. I do wish I had some unschoolers near me though, b/c I get <br/>
lonely sometimes too... been shunned a couple of times but nothing <br/>
major. I would love to come to a conference but they are all too far <br/>
(we are in Alabama). Maybe one day I&#39;ll make it. And I can&#39;t believe <br/>
the controversy over the blog about homosexuals. A 4-H group really got <br/>
upset over that?!?! WOW! Lot&#39;s going on... Lots of reading to do. <br/>
Forgive me if I don&#39;t post much. I love reading what everyone else is <br/>
saying and it helps me! Thanks for the list and the help! <br/>
