darn well better have some compensation other than homework to do in  <br/>
the evening!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only for extra classes but it&#39;s better than nothing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it will go far. The mentality of adults is too rooted in  <br/>
thinking school is a huge benefit and kids should appreciate it.  <br/>
There will be too much pressure to stop paying kids to do what  <br/>
they&#39;re supposed to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty good indicator the educational assembly line doesn&#39;t work!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270454510">This reminds me of Robert Pirsig describing in &quot;Zen and the Art of<br/>
Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; his offer to a College English class he was<br/>
teaching to do away with having any grades. Their response was &quot;Excuse<br/>
me, but why else do you think we&#39;re here? If we just wanted to read<br/>
novels and discuss them with our friends we could have done that at<br/>
home!&quot; Getting graded is the college student&#39;s version of getting paid.</div>
