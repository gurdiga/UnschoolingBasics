 </span></blockquote>No; a signature is the way in which you sign your name that is unique<br/>
to you.  Traditionally it has been in cursive, but it is not required<br/>
to be such.  As long as it is your unique signature and is most like<br/>
how you sign all your documents then it should be acceptable.  And<br/>
let&#39;s face it, we&#39;ve seen people who make an attempt at the first<br/>
letter of their first name and the rest of the name is a line.  Is<br/>
*that* more of a signature than their full name printed?  Even people<br/>
who print have differences that make their handwriting unique.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929854051">Christy,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone should expect him to sign anything in Cursive.  IMO<br/>
<br/>
My DD went to PS from Pre-K through 3rd grade.  When we started<br/>
homeschooling last fall (and now unschool) I didn&#39;t make her continue<br/>
cursive (heck, I stopped writing in cursive as soon as they would let me in<br/>
school... I still don&#39;t write in cursive except to sign my name and that&#39;s<br/>
developed to the point where it&#39;s almost non-legitable).  Almost the entire <br/>
school year&quot; she didn&#39;t write in cursive at all... but just a few days ago<br/>
we were playing around on the white board and writing our names and she<br/>
started signing her name in cursive.  I was surprised that she even<br/>
remembered how.  She couldn&#39;t remember how to make a few letter in her<br/>
middle name and last name, so I showed her.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a forced learning experience but a learning experience all the<br/>
same.  It just happened organically.<br/>
<br/>
Why be frustrated?  Cursive really sucks (IMO) and is introduced way too<br/>
early in school now.  He will eventually develop his own style... which may<br/>
or may not include cursive.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221559232">Thank you all soooo much for this.  It is kinda weird that I knew I should<br/>
not be stressing out but just couldn&#39;t get past it.  Though I didn&#39;t freak<br/>
out on him, I did kinda make a bigger deal out of it than I meant to so now<br/>
I am off to apologize and then do better next time something like this comes<br/>
up.  I will let him know what I have found out about signatures and that<br/>
they don&#39;t have to be cursive, just however he wants it.  I do have a long<br/>
way to go before letting go of schoolish stuff...I am getting there though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480134591">Hi - I just read something from John Holt about cursive writing.  The only <br/>
reason it was taught to children was because in the &quot;olden&quot; days, cursive was <br/>
used for Engraving.  Someone thought that it would be neat (and faster) to teach <br/>
children to write in cursive.  He acually has done a few &quot;tests&quot;, and has <br/>
found that it actually is not faster than printing :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736245675">Hello, Two of my children opened bank accounts and neither of them knew how to write in cursive. One was about 12  yrs old at the time and the other 14. They printed their names in all the spots they needed to sign their names. Both continued to print when their signature was needed on anything; one of them is now 15 and he still always prints his signature but the 14-now-17 yr old has learned  just enough cursive to &#39;sign&#39; her name. :)<br/>

What a coincidence...my son attended PS from K-3.5, and the first <br/>
thing we dropped when he came home was the writing.  He always hated <br/>
cursive.  He is now 12 and still does not care to write.  When he does <br/>
it MUST be a pencil and is always printed.  Although, he can read <br/>
cursive just fine and likes to dictate things for me to type.  He does <br/>
do some typing on his own now and again.<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day my husband bought a truck from a young man <br/>
who &quot;signed&quot; his name on the title in print.  So, I guess there are <br/>
those out there that just print.  I thought it unusual at the time and <br/>
wondered about it, but I just figured that was his name so what did it <br/>
matter...interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447093000">Well, let&#39;s just say that my DH&#39;s signature is in &quot;cursive&quot; scribbling --<br/>
and I use that term loosely.  I can easily forge his signature by simply<br/>
scrambling a pen across the paper.  My signature is half-printing,<br/>
half-cursive.  Guess whose signature gets questioned?<br/>

Hint:  it&#39;s not mine ;-).<br/>

Did you know that the law does _not_ require cursive for<br/>
signatures? (Ask a lawyer!) According to legal definitions of<br/>
&quot;signature&quot; and &quot;writing&quot; in BLACK&#39;S LAW DICTIONARY (a standard legal<br/>
reference) and the revised Uniform Commercial Code (law in all 50<br/>
states), any way of writing (not just cursive) qualifies legally as<br/>
your signature if you use it for your signature. Of course, make sure<br/>
to register a new signature with your bank before you use it - the<br/>
same as you would if your signature changed for any other reason (such<br/>
as a severe change in your vision or general health - or the common<br/>
case of a bride adopting her husband&#39;s surname). Tell the bank that<br/>
your handwriting and therefore your signature have changed - perhaps<br/>
tell the bank-official how the change came about - and make sure that<br/>
the bank DOES NOT get rid of your old signature-card: you may still<br/>
have some checks outstanding somewhere.<br/>
       (If you need me to quote the above-referenced legal definitions<br/>
of &quot;signature&quot; and &quot;writing,&quot; just let me know. I have the wording on<br/>
file somewhere.)<br/>
