<div id="ygrps-yiv-49079293">My little brother always has to be &quot;pushed through&quot; the last month <br/>
of school (private school).  I have been helping him during the last <br/>
month for years...each year it is the same, he gets behind in his <br/>
work, then rushes to catch up before school is out.  I push and push <br/>
and he makes it by the skin of his teeth. <br/>
 Last night I helped him study for a history test.  Today I picked <br/>
him up at school and he told me he made 43! on it.  I feel like it <br/>
is my fault somehow for not helping him enough, but there is just no <br/>
foundation there to build the knowledge on.  He was supposed to be <br/>
learning about WWII...if he was interested in WWII wouldn&#39;t this be <br/>
a much different post?  He doesn&#39;t care a flip about WWII, and no <br/>
pushing from me will make a difference. <br/>
 I can really see how reading posts here and at other unschooling <br/>
sites has brought me to where I am now.  I just wish he was allowed <br/>
to follow his own path and learn what he needs, instead of being <br/>
forced to learn about something that doesn&#39;t interest him and <br/>
probably never will.  Mom is grounding him and making him research <br/>
and write reports on WWII...I tried to point out that using that as <br/>
a punishment wouldn&#39;t help him to &quot;love&quot; learning any, but she just <br/>
pooh-pooh that idea.  ARGH!  <br/>
 Each spring he begs me to homeschool him &quot;next year&quot;, but his <br/>
parents have ideas about &quot;socialization&quot;, and how would he play <br/>
basketball?  Bleah.  They drive me crazy.  I wish they could see <br/>
that dragging him through his work is just putting numbers on his <br/>
report card, and they don&#39;t mean anything.<br/>
 He also failed a Science test.  I didn&#39;t help him study for it, he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to study and mom admitted it was one of the most boring <br/>
science lessons she has ever seen.  WHY does he have to slog through <br/>
a science lesson on the stupid crust of the earth?  It&#39;s there...if <br/>
it wasn&#39;t, he would fall into the center of the earth and <br/>
melt....what more does he need to know?  How rocks break down into <br/>
soil?...okay, give the kid a chance to play outside with rocks and <br/>
dirt and he will figure it out...make a compost pile and he will <br/>
learn how other things break down, also.  I&#39;m just so unhappy with <br/>
it all.  <br/>
 On another note, my SIL said today that her kids are in the middle <br/>
of a MONTH of state-mandated testing.  I had NO IDEA they tested for <br/>
a MONTH!  They spend all year preparing for this test, then they <br/>
spend a month working on it and heaven help you if you happen to <br/>
be &quot;below average&quot; they figure out a way to get you out of their <br/>
system before the test so they can get their money for a passing <br/>
grade.  One test a year...imagine for a minute you had to spend 6? <br/>
8? hours a day preparing for a test...you can do nothing <br/>
else...&quot;Yes, that is an interesting rock you picked up, but it&#39;s not <br/>
on the test so put it down...&quot;  OMG!  I would go mad.  I feel so <br/>
sorry for the kids who have to do those things.  <br/>
 My children, on the other hand, are exploring things that are of <br/>
interest to them.  My little one is bird-watching...we just got her <br/>
a journal to write/paste pictures of the birds she identifies.  My <br/>
oldest is interested in old/foreign coins...we bought her a <br/>
scrapbook to put them in, and she is planning on cutting out <br/>
pictures of the places they came from and making a really neat <br/>
scrapbook with them.  Things THEY have come up with on their <br/>
own...learning that will have meaning and depth for them, because <br/>
they are interested...not forcing them to learn about WWII because <br/>
it is in the scope and sequence for this year, or learning about Nat <br/>
Turner because it is on the stupid state test.  <br/>
 I&#39;m sorry I have gone on so long.  I just really needed to vent, <br/>
and this is the only group I am on that will (hopefully) understand <br/>
what I am trying to say, and what irritates me about seeing children <br/>
being forced to &quot;learn&quot; things that have no meaning.  <br/>

That is exactly how it is! It drove me CRAZY when my kids were in school! <br/>
(Thank God we finally came to our senses!)  One yr., when my girls were in 1st <br/>
and 2nd grade, I got a notice sent home saying that they were asking all the <br/>
younger kids to bring snacks in EVERY DAY for the older kids that were doing the <br/>
MEAP tests! I couldn&#39;t believe it. My kids were so excited about being able to <br/>
be supportive of the &quot;older&quot; kids in school. (I didn&#39;t mind them wanting to <br/>
be helpful but not in those terms!) They had these little kids all geared up <br/>
about what &quot;GREAT KIDS&quot; they would be *IF* they brought in snacks for the older <br/>
kids and *supporting* the older kids while they did the test!&quot;. So, the kids <br/>
who&#39;s Mom&#39;s didn&#39;t go for the bull.... the school sent out were to feel like <br/>
they weren&#39;t such &quot;GREAT KIDS&quot;. The whole thing was ridiculous. That was all the <br/>
school talked about, that was all that seemed important to them almost the <br/>
whole year! ICK!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest dd just told me she had to take it in the 4th grade (right before <br/>
we pulled them out) she said she remembered that she failed the science one. <br/>
She LOVES science and always has but that was when she started to hate it! The <br/>
teacher she had that yr. for science had gone through a divorce and it showed A <br/>
LOT in her classroom although, I think her personality was always the same, <br/>
divorced or not! She was like a drill sergeant. She screamed at my youngest one <br/>
once when she was coming into school, &quot;TEN MINUTES ON THE WALL (this would be <br/>
at her recess time) FOR YOUR SQUEAKY SHOES!!!!!&quot; Casey is a very soft spoken <br/>
kid and when she tried to apologize and tell her that she couldn&#39;t help it, <br/>
that her shoes were wet from coming in from the rain, the lady screamed at her <br/>
again and said &#39;OK, I&#39;LL TAKE PITY ON YOU *THIS TIME* AND ONLY GIVE YOU FIVE <br/>
MINUTES! BUT IT&#39;S ONLY BC I LIKE YOU!&quot; Oh how we LOVE unschooling! &lt;g&gt; Can you <br/>
imagine how many there other poor kids out there that have to endure treatment <br/>
like that?!! How awful! I talked to the teacher about it and of course she <br/>
made it sound like it wasn&#39;t that bad any way, bla bla bla.<br/>

I don&#39;t mind you venting like that at all! I have needed to before about the <br/>
same thing!<br/>

Glad you feel better now Paige!<br/>
