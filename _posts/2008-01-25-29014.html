<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103258734">hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my 16 yr old son since third grade. Lately, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do his work, so I haven&#39; t pushed. He used to be more into<br/>
learning, would read books on his own, but lately he hasn&#39;t been into that<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to unschool, but I&#39;m scared and also have a lot of<br/>
pressure from my husband. So I guess what I want to know is:<br/>
<br/>
Is he probably just going through a phase,<br/>
<br/>
and, how do you unschool a high schooler?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Brenda<br/>

Just &quot;graduate&quot; him!<br/>
Mandatory attendance in our state is to 16 and I don&#39;t think any state is <br/>
more than that,<br/>
but I could be wrong.  Many teens are doing community college or work study <br/>
programs during the last year or two of high school anyway.<br/>
Declare him DONE and tell he him he can PLAY!<br/>
If he had all the free time in the world, what would he enjoy most doing?<br/>
Play with him and rediscover who you are as a family, not as <br/>
&quot;teacher-student&quot;!<br/>
If that it too much right away and you need some transition material...<br/>
get the Teenage Liberation Handbook and read it together. (Dad too!)<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately many states have raised the mandatory max age to 18 over<br/>
the last several years, and some are still 17, so it&#39;d be wise to double<br/>
check it.<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, at 16 most community colleges will accept &quot;dual enrollment&quot;<br/>
students - high school students who get both high school and college<br/>
credits at the same time.<br/>
