<div id="ygrps-yiv-989709072">At L&L, Dianna strongly recommended strewing information for teens <br/>
rather than having &quot;talks&quot; with them, so I&#39;m looking for one or more <br/>
books and/or movies to strew for Ray. He&#39;s sooooo resistant to anything <br/>
that looks &quot;educational&quot; and as a result has some basic information, <br/>
but its kind of patchy. We&#39;ve been doing pretty well at addressing <br/>
questions as they come up (thank god for all those E-D and &quot;male <br/>

its important that we respect his boundaries on this.<br/>

So, those of you with teen guys - which books (or movies or comics or <br/>

  We have a copy of &quot;What&#39;s Happening to My Body? for boys&quot; -- which Will (22 now) read a lot, and a newer copy for Andy (who doesn&#39;t read much except manga books, wonder if there&#39;s manga sex ed book out there...) Actually, Andy&#39;s a kid who&#39;s never had a thought he didn&#39;t share, so he and I talk about sex very openly.  Dan (6) is much more modest, but since he&#39;s around, he hears the sex questions Andy shares, so he doesn&#39;t have to ask directly. <br/>

I can describe my conversations with my son, if you like, over the years.  He <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658650264">Someone mentioned &quot;What&#39;s Happening to My Body?&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2qww7u">http://tinyurl.com/2qww7u</a> - they have one for boys, one for girls.<br/>
Evan&#39;s very visual, so this one was good to leave lying around - until<br/>
he took it into his room, that is!<br/>
<br/>
He took the OWL class at our church - Diana&#39;s a facilitator for that.<br/>
I want to become a facilitator and offer classes to homeschoolers!<br/>
Very, very open-minded approach. More info here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a>  The book he<br/>
got there is full of info, but is more words than pictures. It&#39;s by<br/>
the same folks that did &quot;Our Bodies, Ourselves&quot;. It&#39;s called Changing<br/>
Bodies, Changing Lives: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/37sndn">http://tinyurl.com/37sndn</a><br/>
<br/>
Savage Love is a *great* resource, very open-minded, pro-sex columnist<br/>
- and his columns are usually funny. Very honest approach:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove">http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove</a><br/>
<br/>
Midwest Teen Sex Show <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://midwestteensexshow.com/">http://midwestteensexshow.com/</a> is just starting<br/>
out - I think it&#39;s got great potential, it&#39;s made by a midwestern mom,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think they do quite as much research as I would like<br/>
before they present a topic. Again, they&#39;re very funny. I haven&#39;t<br/>
shared that site with Evan yet, I&#39;m still feeling it out. It might be<br/>
geared more toward girls.<br/>

the DVD - we just happened to catch it on PBS!<br/>

That&#39;s less total sex ed than conception and pregnancy, but a very<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212354906">Good idea!<br/>
<br/>
TV and movies are so great for this kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
We used to listen to Laura Schlessinger in the car, sometimes. Not to  <br/>
get her advice on things, she doesn&#39;t seem to live in the same world  <br/>
we do &lt;G&gt;, but because it was such a wonderful source of material for  <br/>
interesting discussions. We&#39;d listen to a call or two and then we&#39;d  <br/>
be talking (often talking back - usually scoffing at the Dr. Laura  <br/>
parenting advice) so much that we&#39;d just turn off the radio and  <br/>
discuss for a while. Anyway, one thing I have to say for her, she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t hesitate to address sexuality very directly - I used to teach  <br/>
at USC when she was also teaching there. I taught economics in the  <br/>
room next door to where she was teaching a human sexuality course  <br/>
(her degree is in anatomy and physiology). I used to stand in the  <br/>
doorway in the back of her room and listen. She was so direct and  <br/>
clear - I&#39;m sure it was the first time most of those college students  <br/>
had heard anyone talk so openly about sexuality. Anyway - not that  <br/>
I&#39;m generally a fan of hers - but maybe turning on her radio shows  <br/>
when you&#39;re driving in the car is a way to open up a lot of subjects  <br/>
- makes it a lot more comfortable when you&#39;re talking about someone  <br/>
else&#39;s situation - some stranger who called a radio program. It was  <br/>
always fascinating to me to hear what my kids had to say - what  <br/>
advice they offered, how they responded to Dr. Laura&#39;s advice.<br/>

than talks.  Why not in addition?  My son (rapidly approaching 16, and<br/>

the moment arises, over the course of years.  It shouldn&#39;t, perhaps,<br/>

can always come to you for the straight scoop, that things they hear<br/>
from others (especially kids) may be inaccurate, etc.  Values,<br/>
consequences, birth control -- we&#39;ve touched on all those over the<br/>
years, for many years.  (The discussion should begin LONG before<br/>
puberty, ideally, but if it hasn&#39;t, now is better than later!)  <br/>
<br/>
So far, my son says he isn&#39;t interested in dating and such yet -- but<br/>
his body is just starting to get those hormones in gear, so who knows?<br/>
 He hasn&#39;t indicated any particular interest in a girl (at least, not<br/>
since he was 10 or 11), but he may just be keeping it under his hat,<br/>
for all I know.  (And since I suspect that the girls he most likely<br/>
would connect with are living in other states, dating is less likely!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! I worded my post poorly, sorry. Its really not an either-or <br/>
sort of thing, more a matter of strewing in different ways, sharing <br/>
information.... the usual sorts of unschooling things. <br/>
<br/>
Since Ray&#39;s a newish addition to the family I&#39;ve been noticing that <br/>
while we have gobs of resources on hand for my busy, visual, logical <br/>
6yo, who thinks science textbooks are light reading material, but <br/>
not so much on hand for a young teen who&#39;s likely to shriek in <br/>
terror at the sight of anything that looks &quot;eduational&quot;, but still <br/>
wants to know a whole lot of things he can&#39;t learn watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
Although, as I&#39;ve said several times already, tv has been a Great <br/>
resource in terms of sparking some of those very important <br/>
conversations, especially those &quot;male enhancement&quot; ads - of all <br/>
things! <br/>
