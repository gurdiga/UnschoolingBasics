<div id="ygrps-yiv-411417846">Through the years I have mostly been a SAHM.  But with some transitions in<br/>
careers I am now a WAHM and SAHM.  My husband is a financial<br/>
consultant/insurance agent with a large company.  I am independent in the<br/>
same field.  My girls are 11 & 14 so they can stay at home if I need to be<br/>
out.  I try to do most of my work on a M,W,TH schedule.  That doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>
am always away on those days.  I may just work at home a couple of days and<br/>
be out one day.  My dh&#39;s schedule is flexible so sometimes he won&#39;t schedule<br/>
anything during the morning time so he can spend some time with our girls or<br/>
he might spend an eveing with them. For the most part he is always home on<br/>
the weekends.  It has been challenging at times as we have had to iron out<br/>
somethings.  Right now we need both incomes while my dh is getting<br/>
established.  We are just starting our second year in this new career.  We<br/>
have to be creative sometimes, but we always seem to make it work.  I put<br/>
alittle aside each paycheck for our fun stuff.  We also give our girls $5 a<br/>
week plus I have a list of money earning opportunities they can take<br/>
advantage of if they want to.  They pay for their wants and we pay for the<br/>
needs. It has worked well so far.<br/>
