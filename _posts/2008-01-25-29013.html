<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252539819">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
  My family and I have tentative plans to move to the Seattle area.  <br/>
We HAVE lived there before, in fact, my daughter was born there, but <br/>
we didn&#39;t start homeschooling/unschooling until after we moved to <br/>
Texas.  Now that we are planning to return, I was wondering how <br/>
homeschooling works up there.  I believe there are more hoops to jump <br/>
through  (compared to here - in Texas, you pull your kid out of school <br/>
and that&#39;s it - no testing, monitoring or anything), but I was <br/>
wondering how strict everything is.  Is there anyone familiar with the <br/>
area that could give advice or has any observations?<br/>
  I really appreciate it!  Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
  Warmly, Nancy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869533650">i&#39;m listening, too. my family is also tentatively planning to move to seattle from boston, <br/>
and while we haven&#39;t started dealing with regulations here (our oldest child is 4), i&#39;m also <br/>
curious what it&#39;s like over there. i know there&#39;s a more active unschooling and <br/>
homeschooling community there than there is here...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142090964">I live in Washington State and have been basically unschooling for <br/>
the past 3 years.  The following link should inform you of WA state <br/>
homeschooling laws.<br/>

We use the (freestyle)non test assesment option instead of <br/>
standardized testing at http.//www.familylearning.org. <br/>
