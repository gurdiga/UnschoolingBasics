<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014438047">Hi, I have tried Fly Lady and just can&#39;t do it, I really don&#39;t care <br/>
if my sink is shining, that just takes five more minutes out of a <br/>
busy day. :)  I have recently set up a SHE card file system, and <br/>
thought that&#39;s what I needed because I don&#39;t need to consult the <br/>
computer, just my cards. But there are so many cards! And so that <br/>
idea is winding down. Although I do like haveing my homeschool log <br/>
and my addresses in there. Plus I like having cards for all the <br/>
cleaning that can be done if I ever have time and the laundry and <br/>
dishes are caught up (maybe in 10 years!)<br/>
<br/>
I just looked at this site and she says she couldn&#39;t do flylady <br/>
either, so maybe there is hope here?<br/>
