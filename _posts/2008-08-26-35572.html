<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780400596">My daughter (16) wants to stay in Portland, OR, and get a job and share a place with some other unschooling teens she knows up there. (We live in CA).  I t hink she&#39;s serious and I am not opposed to the idea. <br/>
Anyone know how getting a job while 16 in Oregon works? Should I just issue her a diploma from my California R4 school and would that be acceptable in Oregon? <br/>
All info appreciated. <br/>
