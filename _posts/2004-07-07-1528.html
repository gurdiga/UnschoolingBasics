<div id="ygrps-yiv-495098324">&quot; I <br/>
also don&#39;t want to yell, scream, scare or just let them have his way because <br/>
it&#39;s easiest...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Letting a child choose when they need sleep is trusting they will learn to listen to their bodies. Not that a tired child doesn&#39;t need some back rubbing, stories, cuddling...whatever calms them, but forcing a child to &quot;nap&quot; for the parent&#39;s convenience is placing one persons needs over another&#39;s. The best way is to consider all needs as equally important, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I take the &quot;easy&quot; way out with parenting whenever possible!:) It&#39;s easier to trust children than to fight their natural tendencies, it&#39;s easier to learn from life, than to try and force information down a persons throat, it&#39;s easier to be joyful than fight....although the habits that lead to confrontation can be VERY difficult to change. I should know.:) I&#39;m the queen of witchiness if I don&#39;t watch it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best books on parenting EVER, is &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; by Winn and Bill Sweet. I used to think (like someone else mentioned) that you could either discipline your kids, or be overly permissive. I never realized there was a way to be &quot;permissive&quot; and also be a respectful, helpful guide for your children. That book shows the balance I believe, that is truly respectful and gentle.<br/>
<br/>
I have four children, two of them have fairly mellow personalities (aim to please etc..), the other two have more intense personalities. They&#39;re all very different, but we don&#39;t punish any of them.<br/>
I was REALLY mad at Trevor today (14) for getting in his siblings faces and not respecting their boundaries. It&#39;s been an ongoing issue and I lost it. My dh stepped in and told me to chill out. While we were talking he said &quot;you want to fix him right now, but you can&#39;t. You need to leave him alone, keep the others away from them for their own peace and safety and let him figure it out in his own time...and he will.&quot;<br/>
Wow.  My dh is SO cool.:) It really helps to have a partner on board with the gentle parenting thing...when you&#39;re &quot;off&quot; they can be the balance, and vise versa.<br/>
<br/>
So anyhoo...I don&#39;t think forced naps are a good idea. Can you put on a good movie for him when you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed? Find a good snack, or some water play in the sink or something that allows you a moment? Believe me, I&#39;ve lost my temper more than I&#39;d like to remember, so I wouldn&#39;t berate anyone for that.<br/>
I would recommend finding creative options that don&#39;t include punishment, time outs or forcing things that don&#39;t agree with another person&#39;s body. <br/>

Lin, Dana has a very good point and I would like to add my thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
There is a book called Solve Your Child&#39;s Sleep Problems by Dr. Ferber (not<br/>
sure of the spelling).  He his a Pediatric Neurologist at Children&#39;s<br/>
Hospital in Boston.  I have not read the book, but is was recommended to us<br/>
by our pediatrician.  We were going to go see him at Children&#39;s, but never<br/>
did.  However, last week I was leaving my son at Boy Scout camp and found<br/>
that two families had read the book and one family had actually been<br/>
patients of the doctor years ago.  He was extremely helpful to them and she<br/>
commented how he works with parents and children.  He works to form a<br/>
schedule that meets both the parents and child&#39;s needs and temperaments.<br/>
Her children were high energy children that do not need a lot of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
All the newest research about adolescents suggests that many children change<br/>
there sleep patterns when they hit puberty.  It is something hormonal,<br/>
beyond their control.  I would not think your daughter is spoiled.  Maybe<br/>
her sleep patterns have changed because she is changing physically.<br/>
However, she could want more time alone and is using this time to process<br/>
what is going on around her.<br/>
<br/>
We went through this with my teen when she was twelve and I did not handle<br/>
it correctly.  She is almost 15 now and things are great between us.  When<br/>
she was going through this stage, I made a big issue out of it.  I was<br/>
wrong, and would have done us both a big favor if I had relaxed and let it<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>

First, I think it would greatly help your situation if you changed the <br/>
words that you&#39;re using when thinking about or speaking/writing about <br/>
your DD.  It&#39;s harder to remain calm and loving if you&#39;re thinking <br/>
negatively about your child.<br/>
<br/>
Second, what does it matter when she&#39;s sleeping or awake?  She&#39;s old <br/>
enough to figure out when to sleep or not and maybe she&#39;s just playing <br/>
with time or enjoys the silence and still of night.  KWIM?  It&#39;s not <br/>
like she needs to get up for school or a job or anything pressing, <br/>
right?  It&#39;s her time to &quot;waste&quot;....just let her be.<br/>
<br/>
Third, my midwife told me once before a phrase that I keep in mind <br/>
often....&quot;what you resist persists&quot;.  Try just relaxing about your DD&#39;s <br/>
sleep and wake pattern.  Stop commenting on it and just be pleasant and <br/>
enjoy her company while you&#39;re both awake.  Have food available in the <br/>
fridge for her that she can heat up in the microwave during the night.  <br/>
Just let her &quot;play&quot; and she&#39;ll come back around to sleeping at night <br/>
when/if she&#39;s ready to.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I know lots of teens who have done this and they don&#39;t go for <br/>
years doing it.  Just let go of trying to control her and it&#39;ll all <br/>
work itself out.<br/>
<br/>

There have been studies done, not that I usually care about studies but this<br/>
is helpful, that show that many adolescents move into a period of becoming<br/>
nightowls - that is is a natural situation. They also start to need more<br/>
hours of sleep for a while. Some enlightened school districts are even<br/>
altering class schedules to accommodate this phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
Another term that might fit is &quot;normal and happy&quot;. How about allowing her to<br/>
do her own thing? At twelve she is probably old enough to be left home alone<br/>
if you have to do errands with other kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123532539">I&#39;ve been amused by all the &#39;my teens aren&#39;t sleeping&#39; emails! Easy for me<br/>
to be amused...I&#39;ve successfully navigated those waters twice so far....what<br/>
amused me were my kids. My older two have gone through all the stay awake<br/>
half the night sleep half the day stuff....they both tend to be night-owls<br/>
still, but so is their Dad, so no big surprise there.  I fought it for a<br/>
while, but finally let them be for the most part. Tuned out the folks that<br/>
were quite sure my kids would never be able to hold down a job or go to<br/>
college if they didn&#39;t learn to get up with an alarm as kids.  Now my oldest<br/>
is babysitting every morning at 9:00 in exchange for a car and I never need<br/>
to get her up (which I would do willingly if she wanted...I wake my husband<br/>
every morning because I&#39;m a morning person and he hates waking up to an<br/>
alarm) This week they are house-sitting for their aunt. No adults to tell<br/>
them to go to bed, nobody to wake them up....totally on their own. And at<br/>
8:30 this morning, they show up at home bright and cheery, showered and<br/>
dressed (which is more than I could say for myself at the time!) and ready<br/>
to go. My daughter did her babysitting, then they took off to meet with a<br/>
friend for the day before heading up to a story-telling festival this<br/>
evening.  I&#39;ve heard the horror stories....and had more that hinted at the<br/>
horror stories of not teaching my kids the discipline of a schedule and<br/>
alarms and all that. And I&#39;m here to tell you...they&#39;re all wrong!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48649141">I don&#39;t see it as a problem at all. Laurie was a night owl for <br/>
years. She seldom went to bed before dawn. When she decided to go to <br/>
college, her dad was adamant that she&#39;d fail because she wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to wake up for 8am classes. But, several days before classes <br/>
started, she began going to bed a little earlier each night (on her <br/>
own). She was a wee bit tired on orientation day, but recovered well <br/>
and still (6 years later) seldom sleeps past 7am even if she&#39;s off <br/>
that day.<br/>
<br/>
Many successful and happy people are night owls. :-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie <br/>

FWIW, I  know lots of teens who have done this and they don&#39;t go for <br/>
years doing  it.  Just let go of trying to control her and it&#39;ll all <br/>
work itself  out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been noticing that on this list...  no- I would never talk to  her in <br/>
the negative about  what she is doing i am just  concerned.  none of my other <br/>
kids did this, she is the last one, my  baby ...  thanks for the  advice I <br/>
will make sure not to  try to  pressure her about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299940273">I don&#39;t think its a declaration of independence and for sure she&#39;s not a  <br/>
spoiled brat!  Maybe she has just wondered for a very long time how it  would be <br/>
to sleep and wake by how she felt and not by alarms and  schedules.  <br/>
