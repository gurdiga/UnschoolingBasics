THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>

<br/>
:: &quot;I&#39;m Not A Frog-Boiler!&quot; ::<br/>
<br/>
When you reject authoritarian, coercive parenting in<br/>
favor of non-punitive, pleasure-oriented parenting,<br/>
critics and naysayers will warn you that your child<br/>
won&#39;t be able to cope in the &quot;real&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption is that &quot;it&#39;s a jungle out there&quot; and<br/>
we should gradually toughen up our kids and get them<br/>
used to suffering so they won&#39;t be shocked when they<br/>
venture out into the big, bad world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that famous experiment where they tossed a<br/>
healthy frog in boiling water and it leaped right out.<br/>
But if they put the frog in cool water and raised the<br/>
temperature gradually over several days, the frog<br/>
would be able to *adjust* and stay in the water.<br/>
<br/>
The slow boil seems more humane, but that<br/>
&quot;well-adjusted&quot; frog eventually *died* from the heat!<br/>
Whereas the non-adjusted frog&#39;s intact sensitivity<br/>
protected it from being boiled.<br/>
<br/>
Today, look for evidence that your child&#39;s sensitivity<br/>
is intact (e.g., negative reactions to unwanted<br/>
conditions) and be *grateful* for it! Tell yourself,<br/>
&quot;My child will *never* get boiled!&quot;<br/>

can&#39;t find the text on-line (it is cited at Wikipedia, but the link doesn&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250685922">I grew up in Anaconda, but I was born in Shelby.  I actually just moved to SC from NJ, where I was for 12 years.  My parents still live in Anaconda, and I have various family members spread around Montana.  I have to ask......What is Unschooling like in Montana?  I was recently having a conversation with an old friend who still lives in Anaconda, and I was telling her all about homeschooling/unschooling my girls.  She was telling me how there are only a few homeschoolers in her area and they are considered freaks.  She said it&#39;s just not a homeschooling friendly area at all.  And having grown up in Anaconda I think the word &quot;Unschooling&quot; would be a really hard concept for folks there to grasp.......they are not exactly known for &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; there.  I still can&#39;t get my Uncle to believe someone&#39;s property taxes in NJ would be 12 grand a year, which is what my SIL pays on her house, and she is getting off lucky compared to some in NJ.......but that&#39;s a whole<br/>
 other story.  Although my father who is an Accentric Liberal Nut, totally supports the Unschooling thing.  He is a totally free spirit himself.......so he gets it.  Here (I&#39;m assuming) because it&#39;s the bible belt is a place full of homeschoolers and opportunities for homeschoolers.  But the longer I live here the more and more Unschoolers I meet and/or Relaxed Homeschoolers.  So I&#39;m sure as you found out this area is more homeschooling friendly.  People here don&#39;t look at me weird at all when I say we are homeschoolers.  I was just curious what it was like there.<br/>

<br/>
When you reject authoritarian, coercive parenting in<br/>
<br/>
favor of non-punitive, pleasure-oriented parenting,<br/>
<br/>
critics and naysayers will warn you that your child<br/>
<br/>
won&#39;t be able to cope in the &quot;real&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The assumption is that &quot;it&#39;s a jungle out there&quot; and<br/>
<br/>
we should gradually toughen up our kids and get them<br/>
<br/>
used to suffering so they won&#39;t be shocked when they<br/>
<br/>
venture out into the big, bad world.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that famous experiment where they tossed a<br/>
<br/>
healthy frog in boiling water and it leaped right out.<br/>
<br/>
But if they put the frog in cool water and raised the<br/>
<br/>
temperature gradually over several days, the frog<br/>
<br/>
would be able to *adjust* and stay in the water.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The slow boil seems more humane, but that<br/>
<br/>
&quot;well-adjusted&quot; frog eventually *died* from the heat!<br/>
<br/>
Whereas the non-adjusted frog&#39;s intact sensitivity<br/>
<br/>
protected it from being boiled.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today, look for evidence that your child&#39;s sensitivity<br/>
<br/>
is intact (e.g., negative reactions to unwanted<br/>
<br/>
conditions) and be *grateful* for it! Tell yourself,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My child will *never* get boiled!&quot;<br/>
