<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691331381">As long as you aren&#39;t offended by language, crude humor etc...that comes <br/>
along with teen movies, you have got to see &quot;Accepted&quot;!  It is the best <br/>
unschooling movie I&#39;ve ever seen (not that I&#39;ve seen tons but this is <br/>
awesome).<br/>
<br/>
Premise...high school graduate didn&#39;t get accepted to any colleges...his <br/>
parents insist that he HAS to go to college because that is what <br/>
everyone is supposed to do after high school and they have to be like <br/>
everyone else...so he starts his own make believe Technical Institute <br/>
complete with web page...parents fall for it and give him $$...he <br/>
invests in an abandoned mental institution and with help from friends <br/>
turns it into a &quot;college&quot;...tons of other &quot;misfits&quot; get accepted as well <br/>
and turn the make believe college into a real &quot;school&quot;...including a <br/>
curriculum that they make up entitled &quot;What do we _/want/_ to learn&quot;.  <br/>
They preach about how all of their lives they&#39;ve been told what to learn <br/>
and how to learn and now is their chance to learn what they want to <br/>
learn...an example of one girl from a real college who really wanted to <br/>
take photography but her advisor said she couldn&#39;t because she wasn&#39;t in <br/>
the right major...you get the picture.<br/>
Gotta see it...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second this recommendation thoroughly.  I found that the underlying<br/>
messages in the movie were quite significant, and actually the crude<br/>
humor may actually be a bonus in this case that could enable the movie<br/>
to reach a wider audience than it might have otherwise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924787455">Thanks for the tip on the unschooling movie, &quot;Accepted&quot;.   I&#39;d like to <br/>
try to show this movie for free at our local public library friends <br/>
room open to the public, and with an email invitation to members of a <br/>
local alternative learning exchange group we started in our area.   We <br/>
have shown some movies at the library to this group and the public <br/>
within the last year, and have had a table at a couple of local <br/>
Sustainable Living fairs where we showed books we wanted to share with <br/>
people, including John Taylor Gatto&#39;s  books, Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook&quot;, old copies of Growing Without Schooling <br/>
Newsletter and John Holt&#39;s books.  One of Gatto&#39;s books has a section <br/>
by Pat Farenga, John Holt&#39;s successor.   And we included the Sudbury <br/>
philosophy and &quot;Summerhill&quot;, among some others.    So we are initiating <br/>
dialog and gathering together concerned parents with kids, a lot of <br/>
them in the public school system who want to get out.   And a few <br/>
unschooling families have come to our meetings.    Due to our public <br/>
involvement and holding meetings at the public library, a couple of <br/>
learning projects have gotten started in our area, which are very close <br/>
to what I would call collective unschooling.    My husband and I see <br/>
value to all learning experimentation and our own conclusion from our <br/>
experience with homeschooling was that the freer the kids are the <br/>
better it is for them.    If any of you have suggestions on how to <br/>
reach the public and get the word out that there are options, and how <br/>
unschooling can be shared in a community, I&#39;d be happy to hear them.   <br/>
