<div id="ygrps-yiv-521257236">I am trying to figure out how to put my sons activities into <br/>
educationize.  I am not sure what would be considered ok for high <br/>
school freshman courses.....he did several things that could fall under <br/>
several categories.  I am thinking. astronomy, general science type. <br/>
but he also watched a lot of how things are made stuff. are there any <br/>
good simple sites that have unschooling info for this stuff cause i <br/>
have examples of traditional transcripts and that is easy but I need to <br/>
convert the unschooling stuff into traditional looking transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
