<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551322071">Iâve been a member of this list for quite a while, but just recently started to read it regularly again. Weâve been unschooling my oldest son Gabriel since he was 7 (heâs now 13), and we have a younger son, Rafi, who is 5.<br/>
<br/>
Hereâs my question. Rafi and Gabriel really enjoy playing games and watching videos together. Theyâve recently been watching a lot of youtube videos that people have created using various manga and game characters. A lot of them are really amusing and creative, and even though I donât appreciate the potty humor as much as they do, it doesnât bother me. But Iâm having some issues about a couple of the videos in particular that contain significant amounts of sexist and homophobic jokes. These are videos using the characters from the Super Smash Brothers Wii game, which they both enjoy. I wasnât in the room when they first started watching them, but Rafi wants to go back to them often, and had asked me to find them for him. <br/>
<br/>
Iâm confident that Gabriel understands my dislike of the sexist and homophobic references, and that he will use his own good judgment about repeating such things. Weâve had lots of opportunities to have discussions about jokes that can be hurtful to others, and Iâm not worried about him watching these videos. But Iâm not so confident that Rafi understandsâ¦<br/>
<br/>
Heâs very good about other words that Iâve suggested he not use in public, swear words (that, admittedly, we use on occasion around here) but he seems to have no problem with me suggesting that he be careful about not saying things around other people that might bother them; he even gently corrects his brother sometimes :)<br/>
<br/>
But he is VERY resistant to my suggestions that these youtube videos are not okay. Partly, it may be because I had a pretty strong reaction to them the first time I saw them. I tried not to overstate my case, but I said right away, âI donât like that because it has jokes in it that hurt my feelings, and say mean things about people that we loveâ. It really bothers me to see him laughing at these jokes. And, if Iâm being totally honest, I really donât want him to watch them anymore. He repeats the jokes and refrains often. He has been willing to adjust some of the phrases to make them less offensive (to me, I admit it), but some of the others he continues to repeat as they are. <br/>
<br/>
I need some guidance, and maybe an attitude adjustment. Iâm having trouble figuring out why heâs okay with saying âdarn itâ instead of âdamn itâ, but he wonât let go of these other phrases. Is it my reaction to them, since I donât really care if he says âdamn itâ, I just explained to him that other people might be upset? But when he repeats sexist and homophobic jokes, *I* get upset? Help!<br/>

<br/>
I am very against sexist, racist, etc jokes as well. SO I want you to know I<br/>
am not saying they are ok or that you should be ok with them. Can you find a<br/>
way to watch them with him. Talk (you listen mostly) about his thoughts and<br/>
feeling about the jokes. Let him guide you through his mind. Listen openly,<br/>
with no judgment. Know in your heart that he is 5, so young, and that even<br/>
if you are uncomfortable with how he feels it will change (many times) Just<br/>
listen to HIS experience. Why are these videos so engrossing to him?<br/>

whatever fear or bad feelings my reaction caused in them. I would talk as<br/>

---Hey Rafi, remember when you watch that XXX video? Well i reacted very<br/>
strongly. I said some thing that may have hurt your feelings or cause you<br/>
some discomfort. I would like to say I am sorry. etc...<br/>
<br/>
He likely knows on some level that you disapprove. That&#39;s got to be tough<br/>
for a little guy to stand up to his mom.<br/>

racist/homophobic/sexist etc jokes had no consequences.  Sometimes humans<br/>
need to have things repeated over and over. Not like a broken record but<br/>
understand the impact that it has on others.<br/>
<br/>
When Malila was small we were in an elevator with an African American woman,<br/>
mind you she grew up in a multi-cultural neighborhood that was predominately<br/>
African American. She asked me why the woman had such dark skin and why her<br/>
was lighter in comparison. I felt so embarrassed! I was stuck on an elevator<br/>
with this HUGE question looming. I took a deep breath and focused on meeting<br/>
my child&#39;s need. I answered as openly and honestly as I could. It was short<br/>
and to the point. It lasted a brief moment but felt like forever. The woman<br/>
ended up smiling at me and not seeming offended.<br/>
<br/>
What this taught me is that kids will do and say things that are out of your<br/>
control and that may be inappropriate or embarrassing. By addressing their<br/>
needs and not worrying about what others think you can move on. Sure it<br/>
would have been easier for me if she asked in front of her best friend (who<br/>
was Af. Am) but she didn&#39;t. It was all about how I handled it.<br/>
<br/>
He may tell these jokes to others and they may get offended. How might you<br/>
handle that?<br/>
