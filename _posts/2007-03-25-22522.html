<div id="ygrps-yiv-586352958">I am in a strange place with this fear thing.  On the one hand I can say that I really relate to the fascinating statement that I have heard, as follows: &quot;the opposite of love is not really hate, but fear.&quot;  I think many people, truly striving to be good people, will do things out of fear that they would never consider doing out of hate.  I know much harm was done to me and many I know by well-meaning parents and teachers as we grew up.  And I have seen my anxious parents frighten and intimidate my homeschooled children out of their own fears regarding the kids&#39; futures.  We all fear feeling &#39;negative&#39; emotions (failure, grief, embarrassment, whatever) and will do much to avoid them, even trying to control things far outside our own real sphere of control.  This often comes from our own history of hurts.<br/>
   Having said that, I am frustrated with my own continued battle with this. After years of interest in unschooling with halfhearted attempts at it, I finally researched the idea much more thoroughly in February (that&#39;s an ongoing process of course) , presented it to my kids, and we started radically unschooling and deschooling as of March 1st. Last night my 13yo ds (the only one of the 3 interested in the theory, and the oldest) asked me how it was going...said he really wanted to continue.  I said I thought we should too.  But his own behaviors sure give me plenty of concern!  What if, what if... a good many of the things I hoped wouldn&#39;t happen, did happen so far with him. What if they continue!  Is it deschooling!  Is this really good for him (he averages 10-12 hours per day of TV and   consumed 8 soft drinks yesterday).  What if my &#39;ex&#39; tries to take custody of the kids because I am letting my dd read at her own pace (simple words at age 10).  What if all this goes<br/>
 wrong and it&#39;s all my fault!!!  That will really hurt.<br/>
    Dah-dah-dah!!  Lesson from Star Wars (no kidding)!  Episode 3 tells the tragic conclusion of the story of how the sweet child Anakin is changed into Darth Vader.  He has had a lot of hurt and loss in his life.  He has never really felt heard and validated.  He is emotionally unable to tolerate discipline, delayed gratification, and the possibility of future loss.  He forsees a tragedy concerning his (secret) wife, whom he can not bear to loose.  He thinks he wants only to protect her, but in reality his own fear of experiencing loss of her causes him to choose evil...he chooses evil in the name of protecting his wife. In the name of good (overlying fear) he does wrong he would never once have chosen to do.<br/>
    I absolutely believe that unschooling is best for our family.  I don&#39;t beieve that I can Darth-Vader them into the future that I see as best for them (shudder!) But what if, what if, what if.... I don&#39;t have an answer, just a need to say it to someone.  Thanks to anyone patient enough to read all this.  Yes, I did notice that I worried about all that TV then used a lesson partially accrued from Star Wars...the irony is not lost on me, but doesn&#39;t seem to help much.  Goodness only knows why. <br/>

Living *today* prepares them for tomorrow. Living tomorrow prepares <br/>

Rather than worrying about what they might need, fill their days with <br/>

makes sense to me that your 13yo, who has lived through them all, <br/>
would need some time to trust that this was the &quot;real thing&quot; and that <br/>
in the mean time he is going to do his darnedest to fill up on every <br/>
possible thing that may be controlled if you, once again, change your <br/>
mind. Its been less than a month since you started deschooling, its <br/>
going to take a good bit longer than that to build some trust.<br/>

It&#39;s not easy. We know that. It DOES get easier though!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it IS deschooling----but you might want to talk with him. If he <br/>
LIKES this lifestyle, this philosophy, maybe he&#39;d be willing to work <br/>
WITH you to make you more comfortable with your own fears. The two <br/>
things you mentioned---TV and sodas---maybe he&#39;d be willing to back off <br/>
on those two things a bit. Maybe make smoothies and fruit-sodas (sprite <br/>
with cranberry juice or something) instead of so many sodas. Maybe he&#39;d <br/>
like to google soft drinks and see the nuritional value. TV---maybe <br/>
he&#39;s be willing to do something else with you instead.  See whether <br/>
he&#39;d be interested in reading Rue&#39;s book---it&#39;s really easy with a good <br/>
format for snippet reading. Or explore Sandra or Joyce&#39;s sites to <br/>
understand the philosophy more.<br/>
<br/>
ASK for his help to get *you* through this tough period for you. They <br/>
are really helpful! Sometimes you just need to ask! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

  What if my &#39;ex&#39; tries to take custody of the kids because I am letting <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Document what they *can* do. Blog what you do daily so that he can see <br/>
how amazing his kids are. Make a HUGE effort to include him in their <br/>
learning. Don&#39;t say what they *can&#39;t* do! Write about the fascinating <br/>
things they are accomplishing. He&#39;ll never miss what they aren&#39;t doing. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What if all this goes wrong and it&#39;s all my fault!!!  That will really <br/>
hurt.<br/>

What if you were to send them to school? Would you get to blame the <br/>
schools like all the other parents?<br/>

It&#39;s called Dramatic Irony and is a wonderful literary device. Don&#39;t <br/>
work in real life. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if Anakin had been loved and nurtured? What if he&#39;d been respected <br/>
and trusted?<br/>
<br/>
We do the absolute best we can with what information we have now. How <br/>
do YOU think children learn? What tools can you give them?<br/>
<br/>

     I absolutely believe that unschooling is best for our family.  I <br/>

(shudder!) But what if, what if, what if....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but you can give them the best childhood possible NOW.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, Cameron---there&#39;s no guarantee you or they will be here <br/>
tomorrow. Our unschooling community just lost the THIRD child to death. <br/>
Jossilyn Adams died this month. I can&#39;t tell you how well that puts <br/>
things into perspective for me.<br/>
<br/>
What if, what if,...what if your child were to die next week?<br/>
<br/>
Do the absolute best you can do TODAY!<br/>

<br/>
Well, I *was* going to point that out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

TV&#39;s a great invention! See it as such! It&#39;s NOT evil or a waste of <br/>
time. Embrace it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you can come to the conference, it would help sooo much! You could <br/>
see dozens and dozens of teens and young adults who have been unlimited <br/>
in their learning. They&#39;re amazing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307284738">This was sent to me offlist, but I figured it would be good for <br/>
everyone to weigh in on. The questions are certainly not unique to this <br/>
mom alone!<br/>
<br/>
-----Original Message----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am another one that is scared to death of failing.<br/>
I mean my husband is against the unschooling.  We just<br/>
talked about it today.  He said &quot;How do we teach them<br/>
balance?  How do we teach them that sometimes in this<br/>
world we have to do things we don&#39;t like?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I do things I don&#39;t like very occasionally. Not often. If I feel I <br/>
must, I try to make them as palatable as I can. Usually it&#39;s not that <br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I couldn&#39;t answer him.  I mean he is in a job that he is away<br/>
from us way too much.  He hates it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He needs a new job. I&#39;m not joking.<br/>
<br/>
So what he&#39;s saying is that he expects your kids to be miserable in <br/>
their work lives---just like he is. Right?<br/>
<br/>
My goal is that my kids find something they LOVE to do and make $$$ <br/>
doing what they love. That&#39;s what SMART people do! They get up every <br/>
morning DELIGHTED to be doing what they love.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 We have to prepare them for the world.  The world isn&#39;t fair...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So we break their fingers NOW to prepare them for possibly breaking <br/>
their legs in the future?<br/>
<br/>
My HOME is a fair as I can possibly make it. I want my children to KNOW <br/>
that. That HERE they can find fairness and kindness and generosity and <br/>
respect and patience and trust IN ABUNDANCE. We *know* that the world <br/>
isn&#39;t fair. Isn&#39;t it nice to know that there&#39;s somewhere we know we can <br/>
always find it? At home?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
they don&#39;tget to sleep as much as they won&#39;t when they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t get to watch as much t.v. as they want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t get to do just the things that are fun to them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They may not like math but they need to know how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would you stop them from learning math?<br/>
<br/>
I know! Make them! Schools do that every day. What has that produced? A <br/>
country FULL of mathphobics!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 How are they going to &quot;learn&quot; that if we don&#39;t help them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you considering NOT helping them? That&#39;s not unschooling. Children <br/>
DO need help. They&#39;re strangers here. You have more experience. Share <br/>
that. Don&#39;t force them though. They&#39;ll shut down---just like in school! <br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
They learn because they&#39;re hardwired to learn. They are learning <br/>
machines. Humans weren&#39;t given sharp teeth or claws---or great <br/>
camouflage or amazing speed or the ability to jump tall buildings in a <br/>
single bound. We were given the incredible ability to LEARN---and LEARN <br/>
WELL!<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t think it comes naturally, why do you think we aren&#39;t still <br/>
living in caves? We were built to learn! I mean---we&#39;ve been to the <br/>
MOON!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want them to be prepared for<br/>
the world but I want them to actually learn things<br/>
rather than just memorize it and forget it.  Which is<br/>
what I did in school.  I don&#39;t know where the balance<br/>
is either.  I don&#39;t know how to answer my husband.  I<br/>
just felt like I needed to talk to you.  You had so<br/>
many wonderful thoughts and helped me a lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks---but mostly that&#39;s because I listened to so many wonderful <br/>
unschooling moms before me. I listened to my heart. I listened to my <br/>
children. I watched them learn so much so quickly. They do it so <br/>
naturally. They are truly amazing to me.<br/>
<br/>
Do you not see that wonder in your children? Are they not curious, <br/>
creative explorers of their world? They are BORN that way! Fantastic <br/>
learning creatures!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I may ask...you said &quot;Our unschooling community<br/>
just lost the THIRD child to death. Jossilyn Adams<br/>
died this month.&quot;  What happened to them?  That is<br/>
scary.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sam Wilkinson (8) died five years ago after falling through the ice <br/>
while ice skating in Maryland. Hannah Jenner (9.5) died of cancer last <br/>
February in South Dakota. Jossilyn Adams (9) died of cancer this month <br/>
in Maine. Their moms are all glad they had the time to love and honor <br/>
these children through unschooling. They actually got to spend their <br/>
lives being free and home with their families. What a huge gift their <br/>
parents gave them!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I love my children very much.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know you do. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to see them as they are NOW <br/>
---and to see them as the wonderful people they are NOW. Parents spend <br/>
so much time worrying about who/what their children will become one day <br/>
that they totally lose out on who/what their children are TODAY. There <br/>
is NO guarantee that they will be here tomorrow. Embrace today fully <br/>
and completely. The shortest path to a happy adulthood is a happy <br/>
childhood. YOU have the ability to make them happy children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much again for the things that you wrote.<br/>
It really helped.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it can make a difference in one child&#39;s life!<br/>
<br/>
But I know it&#39;s made a difference in many children&#39;s lives. You don&#39;t <br/>
get a second chance to do it right with your children&#39;s childhoods. <br/>
It&#39;s a one time shot. Seriously---they have a LIFETIME to learn math <br/>
facts and to read Shakespeare and to to go to Nepal. Not that you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t expose them to as much as you can. But making them learn <br/>
those things because someone thinks it&#39;s necessary---pshaw! They&#39;ll <br/>
decide when it&#39;s important. And then it&#39;ll BE important! They won&#39;t be <br/>
able to help but learn it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not NEARLY done/learned/seen/experienced everything I want to! I <br/>
have the rest of my lifetime too. It&#39;s a good thing I didn&#39;t think all <br/>
my learning was done at 18 or 22---hell, I hadn&#39;t even *started*! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055174189"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;they don&#39;tget to sleep as much as they won&#39;t when they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I &#39;m assuming this was supposed to be &quot;as much as they want&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They only adults I can imagine not having the choice to sleep as much as they want are those with a baby or still-night-waking young child plus older children who need them during the day.  (I&#39;ll agree that plenty of adults don&#39;t make that choice and prioritize sleep, but unless they need to work double shifts or something, it is a choice.)   And in that case, it&#39;s true in a way that the mom may not get as much sleep as she wants (or needs), but in another way it&#39;s simply an example of how we make choices weighing our multiple wants.  A mom with a baby may not be getting as much sleep as she wants, but hopefully she also *wanted* to have the baby (even if it was unplanned).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s true sometimes we have to do tasks we don&#39;t care for.  But, as adults we have choices that we don&#39;t always grant our kids.  We wash the dishes because we want clean dishes -- we don&#39;t technically have to.  And we can choose our attitude toward that task -- are we going to grumble because we &quot;have&quot; to wash so many dishes, or are we going to be grateful because we are fortunate to have dishes to wash, plenty of food to eat, and wonderful family and friends to eat with?  The thing is, truthfully for us it&#39;s a choice -- both to do the task and to choose our attitude about it.  But if we *make* our kids do X,Y, or Z, so they&#39;ll learn they can&#39;t always have everything they way they want, then they don&#39;t have the first choice.  And telling them to suck it up and be grateful they have parents who love them enough to make them do it, or they&#39;re lucky they have dishes to wash, is... I don&#39;t know, but not good!<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents,<br/>

Maybe something like that would help you shift the focus of the <br/>
discussion away from &quot;she can&#39;t read&quot; to something less <br/>
antagonistic. <br/>

The thing is, truthfully for us it&#39;s a choice -- both to do the task <br/>
and<br/>
to choose our attitude about it.  But if we *make* our kids do X,Y, or <br/>
Z, so<br/>
they&#39;ll learn they can&#39;t always have everything they way they want, <br/>
then they<br/>
don&#39;t have the first choice.  And telling them to suck it up and be <br/>
grateful<br/>
they have parents who love them enough to make them do it, or they&#39;re <br/>
lucky they<br/>
have dishes to wash, is... I don&#39;t know, but not good!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s detrimental to the relationship between you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
Choice is HUGE. I would rather have no help at all than resentful <br/>
assistance. By not requiring these things from my boys, what I get is <br/>
happier and and progressively more joyful help. And they&#39;re CHOOSING to <br/>
help me---not doing it because I said so. But I modelled that for them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom, will you...?&quot; &quot;Mom, could you...?&quot; &quot;Mom, I&#39;m having problems <br/>
with...&quot;  are followed by &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; &quot;Uh huh---Right away!&quot; &quot;You <br/>
bet---as soon as I&#39;m finished here!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Ben has days off, he&#39;s floored by how many requests I get every <br/>
hour. It&#39;s a little exhausting. I admit that. But I&#39;ve seen the results <br/>
I got with Cam. A little more work *now* results in more harmony later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897619332">These posts also resonated with me (and as one of the scientists that  <br/>
Katharine was referring to, I just have to say how offended I am!   <br/>
hmphhhh!  :  )  Although, I did meet many of those lab-types that you  <br/>
referred to in graduate school!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve realized how often I parent from fear.  I find myself projecting  <br/>
into the future.  Some murky haze of Charles Manson-ish type fears  <br/>
(as Katharine wrote in her post) that makes no sense if I&#39;m able to  <br/>
step back.  I read a book called &quot;Living Joyfully with Children&quot;  <br/>
awhile back that really spoke to this idea of fear.  I should re-read  <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
I also recently read an amazing book called &quot;Born on a Blue Day&quot;,  <br/>
written by a man who describes himself as Asperger&#39;s/savant.  It is a  <br/>
very detailed description of his childhood, and the way his brain  <br/>
works.  He literally spent his first 15 years in his room, and found  <br/>
a way to forge the best life for himself now.  My sense in reading  <br/>
the book is that his parents worried about him (as much as he could  <br/>
really understand their worry), but supported and loved him.  I have  <br/>
to remember this story, when I worry about my kids, who deal with  <br/>
sooooo much less than he did.  Then, I can really know that I need to  <br/>
forget about all of the other stuff that worries my brain  <br/>
(constantly!) and just love them.  (I still have trouble letting go  <br/>
of stuff, but I&#39;m working on it!)<br/>
