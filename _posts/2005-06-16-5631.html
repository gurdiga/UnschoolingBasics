<div id="ygrps-yiv-161727006">Please bear with me.  I&#39;ve been considering starting a blog, but I<br/>
want to flesh out a few ideas before I do so, so I&#39;m using you all as<br/>
sounding boards.  Any opinions on the below will be appreciated<br/>
(constructive opinions will be appreciated more - flattery will be<br/>
appreciated most :)).<br/>
<br/>
I was reading an article on winning a few weeks ago that had Lance<br/>
Armstrong&#39;s 5 tips for being a winner.  His number one tip was to &quot;Be<br/>
Obsessive.&quot;  For some reason, this has been sitting in the back of my<br/>
head ever since.  It finally came back to the forefront bringing a<br/>
suprising companion - unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One of the comments I hear often about unschooling is that it seems<br/>
like the unschooled child is lacking the motivation to really reach<br/>
his or her potential without someone keeping up some sort of pressure.<br/>
 Obsessiveness seems to be a pretty straightforward answer to that.<br/>
<br/>
By Obsessiveness, Lance Armstrong was talking about a singleminded<br/>
focus on one goal or object.  I often hear of athletes &quot;Eating and<br/>
Sleeping&quot; their sport.  I&#39;ve seen a similar phenomenon among<br/>
researchers in several fields like Physics, mathematics and<br/>
engineering.  This got me wondering if obsessiveness is a natural<br/>
function of the brain in general.  Obviously, some forms of<br/>
obsessiveness are bad - taken to an extreme, it is a mental illness,<br/>
but maybe this is an illness of degree, not kind.<br/>
<br/>
Often, parents worry if a child is &quot;spending too much time&quot; doing any<br/>
one thing.  Obviously, TV and video game useage are targeted as being<br/>
something we might get &quot;Too much&quot; of, but large quantities of time<br/>
spent in even good activities like reading, educationally oriented<br/>
hobbies or productive computer time cause similar reactions in some<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Often the response to a child spending hours doing video games is that<br/>
there is a lot of learning going on under the surface - problem<br/>
solving, research, map skills, hand eye coordination, etc..., but<br/>
maybe the act of spending hours doing one thing is a learning process<br/>
in itself.  Encouraging obsessiveness in one area may lead to<br/>
obsessiveness in other areas later in life.  And obsessiveness is an<br/>
attribute of a winner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712627065">Encouraging your child to develop their obsessions is more than just<br/>
letting them go as far as they wish with whatever they are obsessing<br/>
on (although that is probably a pretty big part of it). It also means<br/>
indulging in your own obsessions as well.  Children learn by example. <br/>
This is true, not only for obsessions, but for any trait you wish to<br/>
see develop in your children.  If you are providing your child with a<br/>
good model, they are likely to imitate that model when presented with<br/>
similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is, on the surface, extremely obvious, but I think<br/>
sometimes it has to be brought up just to keep it in our thoughts when<br/>
we go about our daily business.  I was thinking about this a couple of<br/>
days ago, when I was in the grocery store with my son.  He is a little<br/>
rambunctious and often walks (or runs) ahead of the cart as I shop. <br/>
He and an employee crossed paths and before he went past her, he made<br/>
eye contact, smiled and said excuse me.  I didn&#39;t actually see this,<br/>
but it made enough of an impression on the employee that she had to<br/>
mention it to me.  Now, I have never told him to say excuse me or<br/>
thank you or do many of the other things that are considered polite,<br/>
but I do go out of my way to say excuse me when he and I get into<br/>
eachother&#39;s way.  I also do this with anyone as well.  I make sure to<br/>
say please to my wife when I make a request and whenever anyone does<br/>
me a service, I make sure to say Thank you (I do this because I have<br/>
always done it, but I do think about it sometimes when I know my son<br/>
is watching and I sometimes play it up to make sure he notices).<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not saying this is the only way to learn manners, or that it<br/>
ensures success in and of itself, but this was not the first time I&#39;ve<br/>
been complimented on my son&#39;s manners, so I certainly feel confident<br/>
that this has had something to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, my daughter says &quot;thank you&quot; whenever we hand her something<br/>
- we didn&#39;t realize what she was saying at first, because she started<br/>
it at 17 months and the words were a little generic, but the intent is<br/>
obvious.  It sounds like &quot;ti tu&quot;, but she makes eye contact and smiles<br/>
as she says it and often gives whatever we handed her a hug at the<br/>
same time.<br/>
<br/>
As I stood in line after shoppinge, I noticed that the cashiers rarely<br/>
looked up at the customers they are helping.  When I got to my<br/>
cashier, I said hi, responded to her hellohowareyou with my &quot;Fine!<br/>
thanks for asking - how about you?&quot; at which point she looked up, said<br/>
&quot;fine&quot; and went quickly back to her job.  At the end, I made sure to<br/>
say thanks and mean it.  She looked up again, smiled and said &quot;you&#39;re<br/>
welcome.&quot;  I do this because I always did it.  Still, I felt good.<br/>
<br/>
I think Zachary knows I feel good about being polite.  Maybe this is<br/>
what he&#39;s learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240864779">Hi Daniel,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying your posts.  My dh & I are currently obsessed with dancing.  I<br/>
sometimes try to explain to our friends that we are &quot; passionate&quot; about it,<br/>
but it feels more  truthful to say we are &quot;obsessed&quot;.  And I sometimes feel<br/>
guilty for being so.  Of course, we have to take into consideration our<br/>
children & their needs & wants, but the reminder that we are leading by<br/>
example, was nice &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying your posts as well!  This reminded me of my daugther at <br/>
about the same age (she&#39;s 12 now).  I would say &quot;thank you&quot; when I <br/>
handed her something she wanted or indicated she wanted me to give her <br/>
in a very cheerful voice (I&#39;m not one for baby talk), I wasn&#39;t doing <br/>
this to consciously try to teach her manners, but I guess <br/>
subconsciously I was doing just that.  I, too, have always modeled as <br/>
well, saying thank you, please, excuse me and also making a comment to <br/>
those who don&#39;t when they invade my personal space, especially young <br/>
adults/teenagers etc (ie they brush by you, in a hurry, oblivious to <br/>
those around them almost bumping into you. I make sure I get their <br/>
attention and make a comment).   They&#39;re no need to be rude to others <br/>
and I see way too much disrespect (even the kids working at the grocery <br/>
store at the checkout, chatting with whoever is bagging, not really <br/>
attending to their job, etc).  We can&#39;t expect our children to learn <br/>
respect if we don&#39;t respect them as well.<br/>
<br/>
When she was small but old enough to converse, and I brought something <br/>
to her attention in a public place (bumping into someone and telling <br/>
her to be aware, not forcing her to say she&#39;s sorry, but modeling <br/>
excuse me) the adult sometimes would say &quot;oh, that&#39;s alright!&quot;  because <br/>
she was little and, I guess &quot;not expected to know better&quot;.  I would <br/>
say, no, it&#39;s NOT alright.  If children don&#39;t learn early on to respect <br/>
others, they&#39;ll continue into adulthood.  I often got a strange look!  <br/>
I said it politely, not in a bossy or know it all tone, but I guess <br/>
it&#39;s something sometimes others don&#39;t think about.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be homeschooling for the first time this fall, after a lengthy <br/>
descooling period for both of us (I&#39;ve always worked full time).  I <br/>
see &quot;obsession&quot; in my daughter&#39;s learning style, she can focus for <br/>
hours on something that interests her, which, of course doesn&#39;t fit <br/>
into the constant changing of gears in middle school.  She <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;successful&quot; there because this preset schedule doesn&#39;t mesh with <br/>
her need to follow through on something until she&#39;s had enough or it&#39;s <br/>
time (HER choice) to move on.  She can&#39;t switch gears and pick up a new <br/>
topic (not of her choosing) as quickly as they expect.  I, too, enjoy <br/>
obsession, reading for hours when in the mood, researching on the <br/>
internet going in whatever direction it takes me, playing piano, <br/>
learning about homeschooling and unschooling and learning styles, etc <br/>
etc.<br/>
