<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104133734">Hi, <br/>
  I remember you were moving to OK, so I thought I would pass this along. There is a very relaxed fun gymnastics center in Yukon, called Flip Center. I have friends that attend it and love it. We just went yesterday. It was great. It has homeschool classes on Thursday during the day. $35/mo. Then there is a guy that works at Tinker that has a passion to teach Tang su doo (okay, I think that is what it is... I get confused, it&#39;s karate, LOL) anyways, he teaches it to mostly homeschoolers in the evenings at a church in NW OKC twice a week. $25/mo. You can test or not for belts. Ages 9 and under are from 6-7pm, ages 10-17 is 7-8pm, and adults are at 8-9pm. I know it is great from those I know attend already and we are planning on checking it out next week. Just FYI for you. I have info on other things like dance, theatre, etc. if you become interested.<br/>
