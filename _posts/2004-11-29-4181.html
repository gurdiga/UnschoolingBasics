 </span></blockquote>Since he is into body art :-)  What about some of those soap crayons that he can use in the tub?  I&#39;ve never used them for my kids, but they have mostly all taken showers ever since they could stand.  We have played with the Crayola &quot;no mess&quot; paints before and they do work!  The paint will only paint on the special paper. It won&#39;t paint on clothes, skin, furniture, walls, etc.  Another option is some tempura paints and cover the kitchen table with white butcher paper (or even the back of old wrapping paper) and let him go to town making huge paintings.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I learned very early when painting with tempura or poster paints is to give each color its own brush.  That way the child doesn&#39;t have to worry about rinsing the brush out, paint colors don&#39;t get mixed and the paints last longer (because they don&#39;t get watery or mixed to that horrible shade of greenish-gray!)  Find decent paint brushes as school supply stores.  They really are worth the extra money.  Those plastic flimsy paintbrushes that they sell fall apart so easily and are very frustrating for budding artists.<br/>

I am planning on buying some of those paint cups that are &quot;no spill&quot; <br/>

A brush in each one should be great!<br/>
(The cups look kinda like those newer &quot;no spill&quot; bubbles for kids- <br/>
LOVE those too by the way. Whoever made bubbles easy for a one year <br/>

<br/>
I was going to recommend those, they are great. Also, tempera paint <br/>
(the powder) is fun because you can add it to things like shaving <br/>
cream and other art stuff (glitter mixed in, paper mache glue, <br/>
regular glue, etc.)  My kids also love to paint standing up....I tape <br/>
big paper on the floor or wall and they love it (dd7 and ds2).<br/>
<br/>
We got a Klutz face paint book and face paints, and my daughter has <br/>
used it for about 3 years.  We *just* had to get a new one.  She <br/>
opened a tattoo parlor with it and it lasted and lasted and lasted!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

Jayn (5) likes the Crayola brand paints that are available in small tubs at<br/>
places like Staples (in the school section) and in larger bottles on line at<br/>
various art supply sources. I have a wide selection of brushes available to<br/>
her at all times. She is usually into monochromatic representations at the<br/>
moment. She paints on paper at her easel, but also likes painting on hard<br/>
surfaces. We find the bathroom wall and tiles around the tub work very well,<br/>
although that is obviously not a permanent art installation. We recycle the<br/>
containers that apples and pears come packaged in as palettes.<br/>
<br/>
At various times Jayn has also requested those very cheap little water color<br/>
trays that come with coloring books. She likes them for some reason, and<br/>
they work very well as body paint. She also likes and asks for those nasty<br/>
cheap brushes that come with those trays. She also uses foam brushes,<br/>
smaller house painting brushes, and some old makeup brushes I had spare for<br/>
painting and soaping. <br/>
<br/>
We have never prevented Jayn from drawing or writing on herself with any<br/>
material. She usually uses markers of different kinds. I think she finds<br/>
that less irritating than dried paint on her skin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662625973">We paint!!  Here are some ideas we use:  <br/>
 <br/>
- use egg cartons for paint containers.  You can easily separate colors and/or mix.  Clean up?  Rinse and reuse or throw away.  <br/>
 <br/>
- Cheap paint:  flour, water, and food coloring.  <br/>
 <br/>
- we like Lakeshore Learning paint (pretty reliable for no stains so far!!).  If you get a catalogue, it can also stand in for inspiration for other projects.  They have the &quot;no spill&quot; cups you spoke of too, and brushes.  <br/>
 <br/>
- paper:  go to Target (or the dollar store too!!) and get the brown paper you&#39;d see paper grocery bags made of.  It&#39;s cheap -- about $3 for a *big* roll here, I think.  Tape it to a washable floor and let your artist have at it!!!  <br/>
 <br/>
- for easy clean up, use an old shower curtain as a base.  When the artist is finished, you can take it outside and hose it down!!  <br/>
 <br/>
- you can also use old tooth brushes, tooth picks (safety...), cotton swabs, sponges (buy whole and cut yourself or have the artist cut it!!), cut vegetables or fruit (pepper, apple, potatoes, etc.), or a myriad of other things!!  <br/>
 <br/>
- if you buy paint, be sure to get black and white as well.  We like the way they lighten and darken colors!!  <br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps!!  <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714505329">My kids hated the no spill cups as they always ended up with tons of paint on <br/>
the outside of the cups, it made them feel sloppy and uncoordinated. We put <br/>
small amounts of paint in the cups of an old muffin tin - harder to tip over <br/>
than individual pots but bigger opening for sticking the brush into. <br/>
<br/>
I have occasionally gone into the local supermarkets on the day they change <br/>
their window signs and asked for the old ones for my kids - the back side is a <br/>
huge clean white surface for painting.<br/>

for a while now and hve been using those.  We get plastic ones and <br/>
they work great.  I loved the lakeshore learning site.  I think I&#39;m <br/>
going to put in an order with them for paints by the jug, which will <br/>
by an investment but save money in the long run. I also think someone <br/>
