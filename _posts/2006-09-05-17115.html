<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107368934">Your fearless list owners will be attending the L&L conference this weekend <br/>
so this is a reminder that new members may experience some delay in posting. <br/>
I&#39;ll try to keep it chugging along smoothly and I&#39;m sure the more efficient <br/>
moderator and at least one of those darling list owners will be checking in <br/>
once or twice during the conference, to rub our noses in - er, I mean to <br/>
help out.   Yeah.  That&#39;s it.<br/>
