<div id="ygrps-yiv-416799862">We had an unusual situation happen yesterday and I would love your <br/>
opinions on it and what to do in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Our landowners (who have a hunting cabin on the property that we <br/>
rent) were up over the weekend.  The are what we commonly <br/>
call &quot;citiots&quot; (idiots from the city).  They have no common sense or <br/>
courtisy for living in the country.  We teach our children to respect <br/>
nature and the earth around up.  We are studing native american <br/>
culture and are trying to &quot;teach by example&quot; how to respect the world <br/>
we are in.  They know that nature talks if we listen.  So, when one <br/>
of these landowners cut down a tree thoughtlessly, our 6 yr old dd <br/>
got upset and she told them that they hurt that tree.  She also went <br/>
on to tell them that trees have feelings too and can talk.<br/>
<br/>
Well, dd and I were sitting looking at a letters book-(this was <br/>
something *she* brought to me and wanted to do)- yesterday and the <br/>
landowners dropped in to let us know that they were leaving.  Then <br/>
proceeded to make a point of telling dd in front of me in a <br/>
condensending way (trying to undermine me and discredit my teachings) <br/>
taht &quot;trees do not talk&quot;.  I told him that they most certainly do if <br/>
you listen.  They don&#39;t speak our language, but they do speak.  He <br/>
then counters &quot;they make noise when the wind blows through them, but <br/>
they DON&#39;T TALK&quot;.  He made this point one last time before walking <br/>
away.  I leaned over and whispered into dd&#39;s ear (not a good choice <br/>
here-but I was ticked) &quot;he&#39;s stupid, but we won&#39;t tell him that&quot;.  DD <br/>
just laughed and giggled about it.  It didn&#39;t seem to phase her much <br/>
with what he was saying, but it really made me mad that he felt he <br/>
had the right to push *his* opinion on my family.  What he did was no <br/>
different than telling a Christian family&#39;s children that Jesus <br/>
doesn&#39;t exsist.  (Not to bring up religion-it is just a reference.) <br/>
It was wrong-totally wrong.  Not to mention none of his business.  He <br/>
had no right to question what I teach my children, not to mention the <br/>
fact that he has no right undermining my teaching, my parenting, or <br/>
anything else in my life.  <br/>
<br/>
I stood my ground on our beliefs in front of my dd.  She saw that I <br/>
didn&#39;t waiver at all.  I even stayed polite (what a task that was!) <br/>
and answered him in simple terms.  My only concern now is what he <br/>
will try and do next time he is around.  I don&#39;t want my kids alone <br/>
with him at all (which is challenging since we share a yard when they <br/>
are here).  I am even considering, because of his disrespect for our <br/>
family, to not allow him in our house unless it is to repair <br/>
something.  No more sitting down to visit and chat.  I think he <br/>
stepped over the line with this and I just don&#39;t want him here <br/>
undermining us and being disrespectful to our family.<br/>
<br/>
So, what would you have done and how would you have handled this? <br/>

Tough situation.  Hmmm . . . if you don&#39;t see him that often maybe it&#39;s <br/>
better just to leave well enough alone.  My concern would be if he were <br/>
to tell you to get off his land or raise your rent or something like <br/>
that.  I completely agree with you about respect for trees (hence my <br/>
email addy of &quot;treegoddess&quot; ;&#39;) BUT he cut his own tree on his own land <br/>
and probably felt &quot;judged&quot; and irked that it was &quot;his&quot; tree, yada yada. <br/>
  KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re probably really angry with him right now, but that anger isn&#39;t <br/>
going to help you to keep staying on the land that you and your family <br/>
holds dear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767638545">Ya, I am upset, but not to the point of doing anything stupid.  &lt;G&gt; <br/>
What I also worry about is the fact that if he were to decide he <br/>
thought we weren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; our children right or decided (if he <br/>
found out) that he did&#39;t like homebirth, that we will have <br/>
authorities called in.  I don&#39;t care to live my life in fear, but if <br/>
he is this disrespectful, then he is capable of anything imo.  He <br/>
feels only &quot;his&quot; way of thinking is right, no matter how wrong it <br/>
is.  He has always been this way and I either avoid him or just blow <br/>
off what he says because of it.  This whole family owns the land and <br/>
he is the nephew of the owners in the corporation.  This land is very <br/>
secluded and beautiful and we usually don&#39;t have to see the owners or <br/>
any of the family that much--just hunting season.  Back in February <br/>
the president of the corp died and he was who we always worked with.  <br/>
His sister took over his position and she is a sweet lady, but she <br/>
lives in Texas and that leaves the nephews near by thinking they can <br/>
do what ever the wish (not having to follow the rules of the corp) <br/>
and it is getting difficult to deal with.  This fellow already had <br/>
issues with the fact that he had no say in anything before and now is <br/>
trying to be &quot;big boss&quot; which he is not.  His Aunt has knocked him <br/>
down a few pegs already a couple of times in the last few months.  <br/>
He has big control issue and this latest thing is him trying to push <br/>
his control off on my family.  Sad.  <br/>
<br/>
You are right in the sense that he does feel his actions questioned, <br/>
but geeze, he was challenged by a 6 yr old????  What does that say <br/>
about him.  lol!  It really is a control issue for him.  &lt;G&gt;  And he <br/>
won&#39;t be getting it with MY kids. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help and opinion!<br/>

I know you will probably get lots of posts on dealing with land  owner etc.  <br/>
But you could show your daughter all the things that live  in rotting trees, <br/>
and that even though you can&#39;t repair the tree it will be home  to lots of <br/>

Yeah, Rudy Mancke is our local naturalist. He&#39;s famous for the line,  <br/>
&quot;There&#39;s more life in a dead tree than in a live one.&quot; By this he means a  rotting <br/>
tree, hopefully dead of natural causes lying on the forest floor!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757466919">We do this a lot too.  Talk about and show how one act leads to <br/>
another.  Like the rotting tree being a home now for other critters.  <br/>
She actually went out after he left and gave the tree and offering <br/>
and talked to it.  That made her feel so much better.  She hates to <br/>
see a tree or anything hurt even when it is necessary for safety.  <br/>
lol!  You should have seen her reaction to removing a tree that was <br/>
totally rotten inside and could have fallen on our home.  It was a <br/>
BIG production.  &lt;G&gt;  She is very sensitive and doesn&#39;t handle change <br/>
well at all.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738017687">&lt;&lt;How would you handle this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think making a confrontation with people from whom you rent may not be the way you want to go.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are ways to discuss differences without turning it into a war.<br/>
<br/>
I am pagan, dh is christian-lite and the kids are somewhere in between.  We work hard to honor and respect the truth that is in all traditions.<br/>
<br/>
I think I might have mentioned to the man that my dd was concerned because our belief system teaches the respect and honoring of all the earth, that she is our mother, and that to cause harm without true need to any of her creatures is to harm our mother.  I would probably say that my dd didn&#39;t mean to be disrespectful to him (It IS his property after all) but that she wanted to protect the tree in keeping with her religion.<br/>
<br/>
Then I think I would talk to my dd about how different people have many different beliefs and how hard it can be when people do things that we believe in our hearts to be wrong.<br/>

<h4>Sherri-Lee Pressman</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Sep 2004, at  3:24pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547174933">HI Amanda,<br/>
<br/>
I have two thoughts on this:<br/>
<br/>
One day this summer we went to the beach. We always take our old crusts of<br/>
bread to feel the seagulls. As we started one woman said &quot;don&#39;t feed those<br/>
scavengers! They are awful!&quot; I said, &quot;they are birds and we are just feeding<br/>
them.&quot; Well she argued with me that they weren&#39;t birds they were scavengers<br/>
and worse than a plague on the earth. I just kept saying, &quot;they are birds<br/>
lady, whether you like them or not doesn&#39;t change what they are.&quot; My dd was<br/>
very disturbed at the names this lady was calling them. We stopped feeding<br/>
and moved to another spot that wouldn&#39;t disturb her. So I told my dd that<br/>
this woman was wrong and ignorant (I have no problems telling my dd that<br/>
about some people) BUT that it was the right thing for us to be considerate<br/>
and move to another area, since it was a public area.<br/>
<br/>
So that is how I would deal with it if it arises again in a public place.<br/>
<br/>
This is different in that it is his land, not yours.<br/>
<br/>
You perceived that he cut the tree down thoughtlessly, but it is his tree to<br/>
cut down and I would politely suggest that perhaps he felt your daughter was<br/>
out of line trying to tell him what to do with his trees on his property,<br/>
just as you think he was out of line to argue with your beliefs about trees<br/>
talking or not. Do you see what I mean? I think perhaps both parties stepped<br/>
on each others toes a bit, but it doesn&#39;t have to be the end of it all. <br/>
<br/>
You are, of course welcome to your beliefs, and to tell him that he hurt<br/>
that tree and trying to get him to believe that they do talk when that isn&#39;t<br/>
his belief, is no more respectful than him trying to insist that they don&#39;t<br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
So if it was me, I would have told my daughter that I agreed with her grief<br/>
for the tree, perhaps suggested a ceremony to remember it by and possibly<br/>
find some use for the wood (if he didn&#39;t use it) to make sure it wasn&#39;t in<br/>
vain, but I would be sure she knew that this was his land and he could do<br/>
what he wanted on it and that he didn&#39;t share our beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I think the fact that you call them &quot;citiots&quot; is a very disrespectful<br/>
message to send your daughter as well to be honest. They live a different<br/>
life with different beliefs and styles of living yes, but isn&#39;t the message<br/>
you are sending to your daughter that you are some how superior and they are<br/>
inferior or wrong for not feeling the way you do?<br/>

If you are trying to &quot;teach by example how to respect the world we are in&quot;<br/>
shouldn&#39;t that include people who don&#39;t live like you or think like you?<br/>
<br/>
I am sure this is going to be hard to hear and you might get mad at me, I am<br/>
sorry for that, I am just trying to help you see the other side of the coin,<br/>
perhaps not my place, but you put it out there so that is my 2 cents,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry in advance if I offended you,<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Grrrrrr.....what would you do?<br/>
<br/>
We had an unusual situation happen yesterday and I would love your <br/>
opinions on it and what to do in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Our landowners (who have a hunting cabin on the property that we <br/>
rent) were up over the weekend.  The are what we commonly <br/>
call &quot;citiots&quot; (idiots from the city).  They have no common sense or <br/>
courtisy for living in the country.  We teach our children to respect <br/>
nature and the earth around up.  We are studing native american <br/>
culture and are trying to &quot;teach by example&quot; how to respect the world <br/>
we are in.  They know that nature talks if we listen.  So, when one <br/>
of these landowners cut down a tree thoughtlessly, our 6 yr old dd <br/>
got upset and she told them that they hurt that tree.  She also went <br/>
on to tell them that trees have feelings too and can talk.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634041525"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think the fact that you call them &quot;citiots&quot; is a very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>disrespectful message to send your daughter as well to be honest. <br/>
They live a different life with different beliefs and styles of <br/>
living yes, but isn&#39;t the message you are sending to your daughter <br/>
that you are some how superior and they are inferior or wrong for not <br/>
feeling the way you do?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please be aware that dd did not hear anyone call them &quot;citiots&quot;.  <br/>
This is a term used in our area about the tourists and city folk that <br/>
come into the area and do damage to everything they touch.  They are <br/>
loud, dirty, disrespectful to the people that live here, take what <br/>
they want because they feel it is &quot;in the country&quot; so no one owns it <br/>
even if it is on your property or in your yard (example-picking <br/>
fruits from trees in your yard), littering, smashing mailboxes, <br/>
destroying people&#39;s property. The people we call &quot;citiots&quot; feel they <br/>
are not accountable for anything they do.  I am not at all saying <br/>
that everyone from the city is like this, just that we call the ones <br/>
that behave like this &quot;citiots&quot;.  Again, it is a common term here.  <br/>
AND dd did not hear any of us refer to our land owners as this.  I <br/>
used the term on here only.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think dd confronted him at all either.  She just mentioned it <br/>
in passing.  The cutting of the tree wasn&#39;t really an issue, it was <br/>
the fact that he felt he had the right to tell all of us that &quot;trees <br/>
do not talk&quot; (in MY home) which was disrespectful of our belief.  He <br/>
kept on doing this even after he was explained to about our feelings <br/>
and belief of it.  He just kept on and tried to discredit me and my <br/>
teaching in front of my dd.  Had he taken it up with me or dh alone, <br/>
then I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it.  He was purposely trying to <br/>
prove his point at what ever cost to my dd.  It won&#39;t happen again!  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t plan on starting any war over it either.  I prefer a peaceful <br/>
life.  I also expect respect and offer them the same.  If he gets out <br/>
of line, then I will contact his Auntie and have her tame him down <br/>
again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for all your thoughts.  I don&#39;t get mad at other&#39;s <br/>
opinions.  I wanted to hear ideas from outside looking in. :)  We all <br/>
have opinions and see things different which is something I love and <br/>
should never be a cause to get angry.  I think it all boils down to <br/>
respect.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
OH! Ok thanks for the clarification I did think this was a term that your<br/>
kids got to hear.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think dd confronted him at all either.  She just mentioned it <br/>

<br/>
Obviously you were there and so have a clear picture of what happened. I<br/>
just responded based on what you had said. I thought you had indicated that<br/>
your daughter was very upset about the cutting of the tree? And I never<br/>
meant she &quot;confronted&quot; him in an aggressive sense, just as others have<br/>
mentioned, that he probably looked at her and was offended at a young child<br/>
talking to him like that. The tree and land is still his. Your home of<br/>
course is yours even rented from him and disrespect from him doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
be tolerated.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks so much for all your thoughts.  I don&#39;t get mad at other&#39;s <br/>
opinions.  I wanted to hear ideas from outside looking in. :)  We all <br/>

Glad we didn&#39;t have a misunderstanding,:)<br/>
