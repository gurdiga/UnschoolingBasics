Yahoo! uses advertisements to help pay for the services they offer us for free.  When you set up a group you place that group in a category to make it easier for people to find. People can find this group because Yahoo offers a directory of groups.   There is no unschooling category at Yahoo!.  Unschooling groups are placed under &quot;Education&quot; or &quot;Homeschooling&quot;  and sometimes &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; and Yahoo! sells and places advertisements based on relationship to category.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll notice a section at the bottom of the groups home page: &quot;Sponsor results.&quot;   That&#39;s how this group is paid for.  It was not the choice of the group owners and group owners do not sell advertising or get paid by advertisers.   <br/>
<br/>
You can read about it if you click on the link, &quot;Terms of Service.&quot;  which appears at the bottom of every Yahoo! page and by clicking the link &quot;Yahoo! Groups Terms of Use&quot; at the bottom of every email from the group. <br/>
<br/>
You received a copy of their terms of service when you made an account at Yahoo!.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114079125">Don&#39;t most websites have ads on them a way to generate revenue for the host site? They are simply automatically generated by Yahoo!, based on the fact that we are an education group. I treat them like I treat every other ad that I encounter; I see if it means anything to me and I then decide whether to explore it further. We&#39;re bombarded with many things which we can choose to ignore if they prove bothersome, no? But I like to use the presence of web ads as away to learn about advertising and viruses with our kids. <br/>

Deb already explained how Yahoo works, but I want to point out that it isn&#39;t &quot;on this list&quot; it&#39;s simply part of anywhere you go on yahoo. Also, have you checked the &quot;links&quot; section for lists of books, blogs and much more all about unschooling? That&#39; what THIS list has provided.<br/>
<br/>
We have nothing to do with the way Yahoo sets up their business.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910763488">Change your delivery method. Go to the Yahoo groups site and get the  <br/>
unschoolingbasics messages sent to your e-mail inbox instead of  <br/>
reading and posting on the website. Put &#39;em in a separate folder.  <br/>
Easy! And no ads.<br/>

<br/>
Daily digest is also great if you don&#39;t have a lot of time on the computer - I go through phases of printing out the digest so I can carry it along with me wherever the kids take me. I&#39;ve even been known to hand-write replies and then type them in later.<br/>
