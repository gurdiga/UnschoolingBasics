young. She has volunteered at a bookstore, soup kitchen, free store  <br/>
and animal rescue. She had tried to start her own pet walking service,  <br/>
still trying.<br/>
Those are just a few ideas to help you get started.<br/>

What exactly are you looking for?<br/>

<br/>
Is he in school? What responsibilities does he want?<br/>

What does he like to do? Does he want responsibilities? What does that mean to him? Babysitting? Or working under the table for a landscaper or a craftsperson, maybe? I don&#39;t know anything about your area, but is there agricultural work available? <br/>
<br/>
Is he simply bored and looking for new directions? I&#39;m always a little leery when a parent new to an unschooling list says either &quot;real world&quot; or &quot;responsibilities&quot; - its often about the parent&#39;s agenda moreso than the kid&#39;s. Radical unschooling happens in the real world, already. There are real problems to solve daily - even problems like &quot;what am I going to do today?&quot; (that&#39;s time management). <br/>
