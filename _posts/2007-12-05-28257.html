  I&#39;ve forwarded that to my parents. Thanks! My mother has always been supportive of my homeschooling but UNschooling has definitely been a switch for her. Thanks again for the link. Jana<br/>

  &gt; I guess I sometimes would like to &quot;prove&quot; it to them<br/>
  &gt; that the way we are trying to parent is beneficial for<br/>
  &gt; our family. I find the ru lifestyle is being<br/>
  &gt; respectful, treating each person regardless of age as<br/>
  &gt; partners, negotiating to find a win/win solution, and <br/>
  &gt; accepting of children being children (or people being<br/>
  &gt; who they are). <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am sure my mother and father and step-mother do not<br/>
  &gt; necessarily agree with how I raise/live with my kids<br/>
  &gt; because I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them quiet and compliant. <br/>
<br/>
  Laurie, if your parents would be interested, there is a Yahoo Group<br/>
  for the GRANDPARENTS of RU children. It&#39;s at:<br/>
  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Please mention it to them. Let them know that we discuss quite a few<br/>
  different issues. <br/>
<br/>
  Everyone - if you have grandparents of RU children, please mention<br/>
  this Yahoo Group to them, if they are inclined to participate in such<br/>
  groups.<br/>
<br/>

I liked Debra&#39;s description, and also wanted to add, that they are children  <br/>
that have raised with their needs and wants being viewed as equally as <br/>
important  as the adults in the home (and outside the home!). They are children that <br/>
have  been allowed to discover their needs and wants and to respond to them  <br/>
without being told how, when and where to do so (eating, sleeping along with  <br/>
interests and entertainment) It brings the term Unconditional Love to a newer,  <br/>
deeper meaning for me. I am working on this myself. We are not all Radical  <br/>
here...but I am aiming and working on my perspective shift each day (and mixing <br/>
 this with my Sensational Child). <br/>
 <br/>
HTH! <br/>
