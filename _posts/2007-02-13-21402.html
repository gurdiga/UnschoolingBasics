<br/>
The case involving a 15-year-old homeschool student in Germany who suddenly<br/>
was snatched from her home by a SWAT team of police officers and sent to a<br/>
psychiatric ward for her &quot;school phobia&quot; suddenly has taken a turn for the<br/>
worse. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Officials who work in support of homeschoolers in Germany, even though it is<br/>
illegal there, notified WND that Melissa Busekros, in a &quot;new escalation,&quot;<br/>
was moved from the psychiatric hospital where she had been held for more<br/>
than a week &quot;to an unknown place.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Neither the parents nor their attorney are informed where Melissa is<br/>
arrested now,&quot; said an urgent statement from Netzwerk-Bildungsfreifeit,&quot;<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html">http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html</a><br/>
/pe_erlangen_en.html&gt;  the German homeschool advocacy organization. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The situation is [horrifying] for the girl and the parents,&quot; said the<br/>
statement, which was written in German and then translated into English. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The German organization said the situation confirms its worst fears: That<br/>
&quot;Germany blatantly spurns parental and human rights and cannot be regarded<br/>
any longer as a free country. It is running more and more to tyranny and<br/>
dictatorship.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WND reported  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54082">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54082</a>&gt; more<br/>
than a week ago that German authorities had assembled a team of about 20<br/>
police officers and other officials to take the teen from in front of her<br/>
shocked family. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was taken on a judge&#39;s order to a psychiatric ward after a diagnosis of<br/>
&quot;school phobia,&quot; according to reports from German homeschool supporters. She<br/>
had fallen behind in Latin and math studies, and was being tutored at home<br/>
in the subjects. However, when school officials found out, they expelled<br/>
her, then took the family to court when they began homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The court order executed by police officers said, &quot;The relevant Youth<br/>
Welfare Office is hereby instructed and authorized to bring the child, if<br/>
necessary by force, to a hearing and may obtain police support for this<br/>
purpose.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Her father, Hubert Busekros, told the homeschool group the state was out of<br/>
line with its &quot;zealous drive to enforce compulsory schooling.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She initially was hospitalized in the Child Psychiatry Unit of a clinic in<br/>
Nuremburg, but then moved without notice, officials with<br/>
Netzwerk-Bildungsfreifeit said. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last week, the  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54135">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54135</a>&gt; Home<br/>
School Legal Defense Association launched a campaign to have its supporters,<br/>
mostly in the United States, contact the German embassy about the case. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then officials with the International Human Rights Group said they had<br/>
assembled a list of German officials to contact on behalf of the teen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Information about the case can be found in English at<br/>
Netzwerk-Bildungsfreifeit,<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html">http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html</a><br/>
/pe_erlangen_en.html&gt;  officials said. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The State&#39;s action clearly goes beyond what is justifiable. They took<br/>
unreasonable measures for which they had no basis. They intimidated the<br/>
family with a &#39;SWAT&#39; team of 15 police officers to take captive a 15-year<br/>
old unsuspecting girl early in the morning, taking her to a state<br/>
psychiatrist,&quot; according to the IHRG. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The psychiatrist, after hours of interrogation, wrote a report which<br/>
claimed that Melissa had delayed educational development of one year and<br/>
school phobia. The judge, basing her decision on this report, gave the<br/>
custody of the child over to the state and placed the child in a psychiatric<br/>
ward. This was all done in a sped-up action taking only four days. The<br/>
family is devastated and has immediately appealed the judge&#39;s decision,&quot; the<br/>
IHRG said. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is nothing else than deprivation of liberty and child abduction,&quot; the<br/>
German homeschool group said. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Officials there said historically the German phobia about homeschooling<br/>
began with Adolph Hitler, whose design was to control the minds of children<br/>
as they grew, leaving them with only his worldview. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The &#39;Jugendamt&#39; (youth welfare office) has its origin in the German Nazi<br/>
state,&quot; the German group said. &quot;German Wikipedia writes about the Jugendamt:<br/>
&#39;In 1939 the Jugendamt [was] adopted ... as a part of government in the<br/>
NS-state control of child-education. The Jugendamt controlled and observed<br/>
families and children politically from their birth.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A spokesman for the group told WND, &quot;Today the Jugendamt  is free to take<br/>
the children away from their parents when in their opinion the child&#39;s<br/>
welfare is jeopardized. A false accusation of neighbors is sometimes<br/>
sufficient to capture the children from their parents.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The students&#39; rights and human rights groups say they still want people to<br/>
contact German officials about the situation: Contacts, provided by the<br/>
IHRG, include: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863459329">For those interested, here&#39;s a little information on schools in<br/>
Germany with regard to this case:<br/>
<br/>
From other reports, I&#39;ve read this girl went to Gymnasium. It&#39;s<br/>
interesting to note that while the Jugendamt<br/>
determined she was developmentally delayed by one year, German <br/>
children undergo strict assessments around 5th grade which determine <br/>
their overall intellectual and educational abilities. It is based on <br/>
this assessment that students are sent to one of three levels of <br/>
schooling:<br/>
1. Gymnasium - this is the highest, most challenging level of<br/>
education and the ONLY path to university level studies. It has 13<br/>
grades as opposed to the American 12.<br/>
2. Realschule - this is a &quot;technically&quot; inclined education. Not to be<br/>
confused with an &quot;IT&quot; trade school. Youth attending this school<br/>
generally attend less than 13 years, do not have the option to attend<br/>
university with this diploma (though they can voluntarily apply to<br/>
complete Gymnasium).<br/>
3. Hochschule - this school traditionally only goes to grade 9,<br/>
though in recent years it&#39;s become more fashionable for students to<br/>
complete 10 grades. Students in this school could generally be<br/>
considered &quot;at or below average&quot; and are headed for an apprenticeship<br/>
in a trade position, most typically some type of manually labor like<br/>
construction.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, on the surface not a totally bad system as, unlike the US<br/>
system, it doesn&#39;t automatically try to force children onto a path for<br/>
college when they may actually be more successful and happier in a<br/>
trade job. It does however, confine them to trade jobs carries a<br/>
certain degree of &quot;class&quot; distinction.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my point though:<br/>
The GERMAN EDUCATION SYSTEM is the one that determined this girl<br/>
belonged in Gymnasium. They are the ones that educated her. They<br/>
are the ones that apparently failed, if she&#39;s now considered behind<br/>
by one year.<br/>
<br/>
Germans do tend to put &quot;delayed&quot; students into a &quot;Sonderschule&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Special school&quot; and yes -- it has all the nastiness of<br/>
the &quot;short bus&quot; attitude. Many children end up in &quot;Sonderschule,&quot; in<br/>
fact, for health reasons. I know of children who were epileptic.<br/>
Otherwise perfectly healthy, intelligent and capable children, but<br/>
because of the risk of seizure deemed not appropriate for placement<br/>
in the general school environment. These otherwise &quot;normal&quot; children<br/>
were thus confined to a classroom with children who were, in part,<br/>
greatly mentally and physically challenged. The message is clear and<br/>
while I&#39;m not one to scream &quot;Nazi&quot; at the drop of a hat, it<br/>
definitely smacks of the same flavor of human worth classification.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I read in another article mention of a loud classroom<br/>
environment and cancelled classes. I dare say I question whether a<br/>
loud classroom environment claim has any merit whatsoever; however, I<br/>
am familiar with the German practice of simply not holding class when<br/>
a teacher is unavailable rather than bringing in a substitute. This<br/>
has always astounded me.<br/>
<br/>
While I question the slant with which some of the information has<br/>
been presented, I believe the facts are to be found and they are<br/>
indeed not pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that illuminates for someone who might take interest.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102023502">I&#39;m wondering if the child has auditory processing issues or is not<br/>
auditory? This might explain the loud classroom as an annoyance and need to<br/>
Homeschool.<br/>
