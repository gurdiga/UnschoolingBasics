Sometimes its possible to arrange in advance for &quot;time&quot; on the tv and computer, and I expect others will have stories, but in my family it has helped most of all to have enough resources to go &#39;round. We have a very slim budget, so we&#39;ve found ways to do that creatively. One solution we have is that we have an old, clunky computer that isn&#39;t hooked up to the internet and all non-internet games, movies and writing happens there. That helps a lot! I can do a lot of writing on the one and then use a flash drive to transfer it to the other computer and not be tying up the internet composing. It also helps us to have a &quot;games&quot; tv - one that&#39;s not hooked up to the dish. That tv is a little older and clunkier, too - a yard sale find. <br/>

*Any* commodity that&#39;s desired but is in short supply will cause  <br/>
tension and fighting. That&#39;s human nature. It&#39;s probably the root of  <br/>
most wars.<br/>
<br/>
Used TVs and older computers are cheap. Check Craigslist and Freecycle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488795262">i&#39;d urge you to not stop short of a second tv!  you can probably get a pretty decent one cheap or even free...  it&#39;s a little like saying &quot;we have one dining room chair and both my kids want to sit in it at the same time, what can i do?&quot; :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850688916">***We just bought another TV at the Salvation Army. One we saw was a 32 inch <br/>
for $45. Freecycle has TVs for free. ***<br/>
<br/>
The TV we&#39;ve been using for a couple years came from Goodwill and cost <br/>
$12.99.  (We left the price tag on, it amuses us so.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a second TV in the spare room, a junk store find, under ten dollars.<br/>
Dylan has a TV in his room.  Goodwill.  $2.99.<br/>
They all work just fine.  They&#39;re ugly, but they work just fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has about thirteen televisions, second hand, older, some really old. <br/>
He likes old TV&#39;s &lt;g&gt; likes to tinker with them.  Some he repaired.  They <br/>
all work, but they&#39;re not all plugged in. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334507688">Again with the TV, one day in the second hand store we found a flock of <br/>
televisions from the state prison.  Apparently the inmates were getting new <br/>
TV&#39;s and the old ones migrated to the Goodwill.   They were all clear <br/>
plastic.  We bought one.  It&#39;s small.  All the internal organs are visible <br/>
through the clear plastic.  That&#39;s so inmates can&#39;t conceal contraband <br/>
inside their televisions.  I had never thought about that and it was really <br/>
fun to discover that there are TV&#39;s made specifically for prisons. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
It&#39;s like those  &quot;Visible Man&quot; models, only like a TV instead. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
