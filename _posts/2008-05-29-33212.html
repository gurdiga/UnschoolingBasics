<div id="ygrps-yiv-430797231">After atteding NEU, I have been thinking that I would like to plan a<br/>
conference for my area. It was really wonderful to experience other<br/>
unschooling families and see everyone where they were on their<br/>
journey. And the best part was all the wonderful, amazing kids! I<br/>
especially realized the comfort of the conference on Monday in the<br/>
park while searching for everyone. I overheard a mother threatening<br/>
her kid, even though it was done jokingly I could feel the sting. I<br/>
realized then how comforting it was to hear all that loving, gentle<br/>
parenting going on all weekend. It is so much easier to be a gentle<br/>
parent surrounded by other unschoolers. It was also great to see that<br/>
other peoples families were not &quot;perfect stepford families&quot; and that<br/>
when my kids fought, etc I wasn&#39;t a failure. I feel a renewed<br/>
confidence in myself.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone who has coordinated one feel like offering me direction? Thanks<br/>

Where is your &quot;area?&quot;  I really wanted to attend the conference, but it was<br/>
WAY too far away. If I could drive somewhere, that would be wonderful.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a good time right *now*---I&#39;m traveling and visiting with the <br/>
Gauchmans now and will be heading homeward tomorrow---but I would be <br/>
happy to give you pointers and suggestions and tell you what to avoid <br/>
and what some of the pitfalls are.<br/>
<br/>
Call me later next week---we can talk at length. 803 237 4948 cell or <br/>
803 776 4849 home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you had such a good time. Conferences really DO make a <br/>
difference and are POWERFUL, aren&#39;t they? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m in Colorado too. I just can&#39;t financially swing the travel<br/>
&gt; expenses for the conferences on the east coast. I know they have one<br/>
&gt; in Washington: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifeisgoodconference.com">http://www.lifeisgoodconference.com</a> and<br/>
&gt; Rethinking Education: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rethinkingeducation.com">http://www.rethinkingeducation.com</a> is in<br/>
&gt; Dallas. I&#39;ve never been to either. They are a closer option though,<br/>
&gt; the only ones I&#39;m aware of, but probably not as close as you were<br/>
&gt; looking for. :)<br/>
