<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590868392">Long story short, I have been completely exhausted.  I care for two <br/>
of our grandchildren, 12 and 4 months,  full-time.  Recently, I <br/>
reduced my commitment by two days giving us Wednesdays and Fridays <br/>
off.  I plan to eliminate Mondays as well in a couple weeks giving <br/>
me more time with my three unschoolers that I am still actively <br/>
facilitating.  <br/>
<br/>
In September they start a local co-op that meets on Fridays, so we <br/>
will be limited to Mondays and Wednesdays where I can give them my <br/>
full attention.  What I would like to do is compile a list of <br/>
interesting things to do to keep on the refrigerator with the <br/>
intention of enabling us to think more effectively on our toes.<br/>
<br/>
What are your plans for the fall?  How do you enjoy spending time <br/>
with your young teens?  (Ours are 12ds, almost 15ds and 16dd)  What <br/>
interests you?  What interests your teens?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just looking for a creative jump start here so we spend our time <br/>
doing more than lunch and a movie.  That&#39;s nice, but we&#39;d like a <br/>
little more variety in our life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
