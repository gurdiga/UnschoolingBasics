- solid and everyone knows what you mean. A classic.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could go with a medieval version - &quot;God&#39;s Teeth!!&quot; or &quot;God&#39;s  <br/>
Thumbs&quot; - those are entertaining. Or &quot;Od&#39;s Bodkins.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you could always use a science fiction word - Larry Niven&#39;s  <br/>
Ringworld gives us &quot;tanj&quot; (there ain&#39;t no justice) which has a nice  <br/>
etymology behind it and has a nice strong classic swear-word sound to  <br/>
it. Plus you can declare your geekiness in your cursing.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign language swearwords are often fun - &quot;Schiesse!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or go with imaginative stream of consciousness whatever flows out of  <br/>
your mouth organic improvised be in the moment -- &quot;Freakin&#39; aardvarks  <br/>
on a piano!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just a few suggestions for you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Also, anyone within a 100 mile radius be forewarned spitting contests shall commence, daddy thinks it is an appropriate education for a young boy to know how and when to spit and distance counts.

enacted...<br/>
<br/>
I told my son to make sure he knows what a word means before using it,<br/>
as he could unintentionally offend someone or get in trouble<br/>
otherwise.  (When a kid of an agnostic and atheist says &quot;Hell&quot;, at a<br/>
young age, odds are, he doesn&#39;t know what it means, and picked it up<br/>
from a movie or another kid.  He hadn&#39;t a clue.  Or when he called me<br/>
an ass (I had just called him a goose -- he was being silly) --<br/>
because that is a term used in the Narnia books.... had a really hard<br/>
time fighting a belly laugh there!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747926273">One night Quinn (3 y.o.) woke at 3:00 a.m. hungry.  As I opened the<br/>
refrigerator door a bottle of ketchup fell out, the top cracked, and<br/>
ketchup went all over including under the refrigerator.  I said the<br/>
first thing that came to mind, &quot;F**king shit!&quot;  My parents visited the<br/>
next week, and Quinn happily told the story of the ketchup spilling<br/>
and the words I said.  I couldn&#39;t hold back the laughter at my mom&#39;s<br/>
appalled expression.  My mom told her that I was sorry that I had said<br/>
those bad words.  I told Quinn that I wasn&#39;t sorry, and that those<br/>
weren&#39;t words that grandma likes to hear. Quinn kept repeating the<br/>
story, but it gradually evolved into saying that I was an angry woman<br/>
when the ketchup spilled.  She has learned some of my colorful<br/>
vocabulary and uses it, but I think she&#39;s already learning when and<br/>
where it&#39;s appropriate.  <br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling group came up with an alphabet of curse words and<br/>
crass terms at a park day once.  They are just words, and we had a lot<br/>
of fun. <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/45ygsr">http://tinyurl.com/45ygsr</a><br/>
<br/>
Way more swears than anyone could use. Here&#39;s a sampling:<br/>
<br/>
Fantasy swears (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ywqmma)">http://tinyurl.com/ywqmma)</a> like:<br/>
<br/>
Bastard&#39;s Demons - from Lois McMaster Bujold&#39;s Chalion universe.  <br/>
General expletive referring to the one of five gods who runs hell.<br/>
<br/>
canner - from the movie I, Robot, a racial epithet used against  <br/>
robots, particularly by the protagonist.<br/>
<br/>
fahrbot - from Farscape; meaning insane or mentally deficient.<br/>
<br/>
Hab SoSlI&#39; Quch! - Klingon for &quot;Your Mother has a smooth forehead.&quot;  <br/>
The worst curse/insult in the Klingon language... especially in  <br/>
reference about one&#39;s mother.<br/>
<br/>
hippikaloric - from Ozma of Oz by L. Frank Baum - a word uttered by  <br/>
the Nome King, &quot;which must be a dreadful word because we don&#39;t know  <br/>
what it means&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
mudblood - from Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling, used by &quot;pure-blood&quot;  <br/>
people to slander those whose ancestors who are non-magical (e.g.  <br/>
Hermione Granger).<br/>
<br/>
puckernuts - from Elfquest; similar meaning to &quot;damn&quot; or &quot;damn it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
rassin-frassin - from Hanna-Barbera&#39;s Jetsons & Flintstones a  <br/>
derogatory adjective of some kind. Possible corruption of the German  <br/>
curse &quot;Ratten-Fressen&quot; or &quot;Rat Eating/Eater.&quot; Also uttered by  <br/>
Yosemite Sam in Warner Bros cartoons. Also similar/the same as the  <br/>
quiet muttering used by Muttley in Wacky Races. Also spelled/ <br/>
pronounced &quot;ratchafratchin&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
zoinks - from Scooby Doo, a common expletive uttered by Shaggy Rogers.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign swears, like:<br/>
<br/>
Dutch<br/>
mafketel weirdo NOTE Also &quot;Mafkees&quot; where &quot;Kees&quot; is a traditional  <br/>
Dutch male name. Mafketel literally means &quot;Weird pot&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
German<br/>
verdammter Schweinhund (neut. noun) idiot, absolute moron; dodo NOTE  <br/>
Pronounced fair-DAHM-tir SHVINE-hoont; means, literally, &quot;Damned  <br/>
pigdog.&quot; Can be used as an expletive: &quot;Ach! Verdammter Schweinhund!&quot;  <br/>
or as an insult: &quot;Du bist ein verdammter Schweinhund.&quot; Means stupid  <br/>
in a sloppy, revolting, or ridiculous way. Uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
Italian<br/>
Porco due (excl.) &quot;By Gosh!&quot; (literally &quot;Pig two!&quot;) NOTE Used to  <br/>
avoid saying &quot;Porcoddio!&quot; a blasphemous expression that means &quot;God- <br/>
pig&quot;. It sounds very similar to it. Very popular in Italy between  <br/>
10-15 years people.<br/>
<br/>
(Similar to Zio cantante, literally &quot;Uncle singer!&quot; as a euphemism  <br/>
for &quot;Dio Cane!&quot; which literally means &quot;God-dog!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Swedish<br/>
rannskita (noun) diarrhea NOTE Literal translation: Running butt.<br/>
<br/>
Tibetan<br/>
phai.sha.za.mkhan. {noun phrase} eater of father&#39;s flesh NOTE A  <br/>
strong insult in Tibetan.<br/>
<br/>
Yiddish<br/>
shlemiel (noun) clumsy oaf. Klutz NOTE The sort of person who, when  <br/>
at a fancy restaurant, invariably spills his soup.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940136368">This IS hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
My kids really have an amazing innate sense of what words are <br/>
appropriate in what situations and around what people. My husband is a <br/>
carpenter, and my kids know all the&quot; bad words&quot;, yet I can&#39;t yet <br/>
remember them ever saying one in a situation that offended or <br/>
embarrassed anyone. I may have issued a few reminders - you know, when <br/>
we are around so and so you may not want to use that word as I a pretty <br/>
sure they would feel offended. But not for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like to save the F word for rare occasions- it really has <br/>
an impact then- wow- did you hear what mom just said!<br/>

&gt; whilevI repeated the word &quot;Shit&quot; over and over again. Skylar was in<br/>
&gt; the back about 4 years old at the time. I finally hit a fence and<br/>
&gt; stopped. Before I could even get a word out of my mouth Skylar says,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Awww f**k it mom.&quot; Completely appropriate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Discussion about appropriateness in different situations has worked<br/>
&gt; for us quite well too. What has not worked so well is using the words<br/>
&gt; in front of a younger sibling who isn&#39;t quite clear on appropriateness<br/>
&gt; yet. I ended up letting that one go and we haven&#39;t had any awkward<br/>
&gt; moments with Milo as of yet. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071927851">My kids laugh because I use foul language in my blog, but rarely in spoken conversation.  We don&#39;t really curse in our house.  I say dammit, and so does my 3 yr old, every time she drops something, it&#39;s hilarious.  When I hear them say it (usually around a year or so) it reminds me to try & stop saying it for a while, but that never lasts long.<br/>
<br/>
My husband uses foul language, but they don&#39;t copy him.<br/>
<br/>
I think my 11 yr old probably curses more than any of us.  I don&#39;t mind much, she isn&#39;t offensive with it, she doesn&#39;t use ugly words to insult people, they&#39;re usually exclamations.<br/>
<br/>
They ARE just words, but since some people get worked up over them, I do think it&#39;s common courtesy to not use them in professional situations (we cater & I don&#39;t think my kids would use them while serving, nor would I)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276515121">I quite love swearing.  I love the shock value that even I get when I say holy f**k.  I don&#39;t do it that often, and have made a concerted effort to not do it much while our girls are still so little.  I am completely tickled by all the creative options that have been shared though!<br/>
 <br/>
I see them as just words, like umbrella, or kleenex.  Nothing really has meaning except for the meaning we give it.<br/>
 <br/>
My favourite swearing story from our house is when I spilled something, said &#39;f**k&#39;, and my daughter, who couldn&#39;t yet say f&#39;s said to me, &#39;momma, why you say puck?&#39;.  I told her I was talking about hockey :).  Cracked me up.<br/>

For the uninitiated &lt;g&gt;, Tim Horton&#39;s is a donut shop with locations <br/>
across Canada and timbits are the donut holes. We always pick up a box <br/>
of timbits when we head to Vancouver. Waah, I miss them!<br/>

P.S. Skye&#39;s pretty funny! LOL<br/>

&gt; I just remembered our funniest swearing story: We were driving <br/>
&gt; through the Tim Horton&#39;s drivethrough because the girls asked for a <br/>
&gt; timbit. As they usually do when we pull up to the windown, the <br/>
&gt; girls asked for their windows to be rolled down so they could say hi <br/>
&gt; to the woman at the window. As soon as I rolled the window down, <br/>
&gt; Skye hollered, &quot;fucking donuts!&quot;. I laughed so hard I almost peed <br/>
&gt; my pants. Certainly not very appriopriate, but really really <br/>
&gt; funny :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427606086">This is making me go &quot;eek!&quot; Did the person working the window think<br/>
the windows were rolled down just so he could be cussed at? It seems<br/>
really rude the way you&#39;ve written it - not funny. But I&#39;m guessing it<br/>
didn&#39;t happen the way I&#39;m seeing it in my mind. How did it actually<br/>
play out?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
