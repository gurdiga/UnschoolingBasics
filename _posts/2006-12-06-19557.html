<div id="ygrps-yiv-212697570">OK, so I&#39;m giving the kids more freedoms - not ready to drop all the<br/>
structured schoolwork yet. But today I had a another Duh!!! moment, as<br/>
in how could I not think they didn&#39;t already get this from basic life<br/>
and reading!  I was &quot;teaching&quot; synonyms and antonyms with a worksheet.<br/>
I also had a homonym page. We have discussed all these in the past,<br/>
and they get the concept of all of them but they get stuck on the<br/>
names. Anyway, so we started doing the homonym page. It had a sentence<br/>
with a blank and at the end of the sentence, a pair of homonyms.<br/>
Because the kids have a very hard time spelling, I figured this was<br/>
going to be very hard for them - to know which spelling they needed<br/>
for the sentence. They got everyone right! And my Duh! moment... Why<br/>
in the world would I think that they might have problems with this?<br/>
They are very good readers and come across these words all the time.<br/>
Why did I think that I needed to *teach* this???  Answer: because the<br/>
curriculum says they should know what synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms<br/>
mean and be able to use them correctly. Well, it was obvious that they<br/>
have the concepts and can apply their knowledge just fine.. Who cares<br/>
if they don&#39;t remember the actual names for this concept at 6,7,8 or<br/>
even 9 yrs old!!! So, that was my AhHa moment for the day. <br/>
<br/>
OK, now for the question - They had so much fun doing these worksheets<br/>
 that they wanted more, but we had to go to music class for my younger<br/>
son. <br/>
So the questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) how many of your children actually do worksheets or workbooks<br/>
because they want to (either by asking for some or just finding them<br/>
in the house)<br/>
<br/>
2) if so, Do you ever suggest that they do a page or two, just like<br/>
you might suggest they play a game if they ask for help in what to do?<br/>
or is their interest completely their own<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to get a handle on all this... Though after today, I<br/>
know I just have to trust that they are in fact learning more than I<br/>
thought through natural means. <br/>

<br/>
  ****<br/>
  There was a time when Andy asked for math problems on paper, and I would print out a page of problems from a website I found that generates worksheets.  He loves and numbers, and does a lot of math in his head, so doing it on paper is usually a snap for him anyway.  It&#39;s been months since he asked for one, tho. Now that you mention it, he hasn&#39;t asked for one since we moved to our new house, and we don&#39;t have the catholic-schooled friend up the street bugging him about it. That boy and his Mom were a constant source of &#39;but you really need to go to school to learn anything&#39; comments.  One more thing we don&#39;t miss at our new house!<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
2) if so, Do you ever suggest that they do a page or two, just like<br/>
you might suggest they play a game if they ask for help in what to do?<br/>
or is their interest completely their own<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I never suggest worksheets.  I only suggest a game if they seem at a loss for activities and I&#39;m willing to play the game with them.  Here&#39;s an idea -- how about a game of yatzeeh?  or Monopoly? or throw the ball in the yard? or watch a movie together?  There&#39;s a whole world of stuff for kids to do that don&#39;t involve worksheets or stilted attempts to make them learn something.  Besides, kids see right thru that -- they know you aren&#39;t suggesting it just for fun, but that you worry they aren&#39;t learning enough.  And if you&#39;re worried they can&#39;t learn without assignments or worksheets, how are they ever going to believe it about themselves?<br/>
   <br/>
  Just go on vacation  -- call it Christmas break if that helps -- and don&#39;t go back to anything schooly. It&#39;s really easy once you get started.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I just have to trust that they are in fact learning more than I<br/>
thought through natural means. <br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  It will be much easier for you to see what they&#39;re constantly learning more once you let go and trust that they&#39;ll learn.  It wil also be easier for them to trust themselves to learn what they need. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946277405">Thanks Sylvia,<br/>
<br/>
I never would have imagined they&#39;d think the sheets were fun but they<br/>
did... The sheets were a bit dry to me but it was all I could find. So<br/>
I was thinking - if I hadn&#39;t pulled these out, they would have never<br/>
went looking for the sheets themselves and I wondered how others<br/>
handled that, as I have read here of kids asking for workbooks or<br/>
sheets. Then again, this might only happen in the beginning stages of<br/>
unschooling, when everyone still has has the workbook mentality. <br/>
<br/>
It also got me thinking about other activities. Example: We have had<br/>
some magnet kits here for months, sitting on a shelf in full view.<br/>
When we first got them, they played with the kits for a couple weeks.<br/>
But nothing since then. I brought them out today and they loved<br/>
exploring with them. But had I not initiated it, they would have kept<br/>
passing it by.  Do you all have a general plan in the back of your<br/>
head that you are going to rotate books, activities, games, toys to<br/>
the forefront at certain times, both for fresh experiences and for<br/>
encouraging a variety of interests, or do you leave it totally to the<br/>
children to discover what&#39;s available? (example - the kinetix in the <br/>
closet that has not been touched for 6 months). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but you&#39;re still valuing schoolish learning over other kinds of<br/>
learning. If they didn&#39;t get any of those right, yet were fascinated<br/>
with Japanese anime today, would that be as comforting to you? The<br/>
problem is what is being valued. People learn...period. Learning<br/>
synonyms isn&#39;t more valuable than playing in the dirt, unless the<br/>
learner finds it valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are, they&#39;ll forget everything you &quot;taught&quot; them today<br/>
eventually, because it has no real life connection for them just yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327889956">My daughter Emily who is thirteen now(!) knows what synonyms, antonyms and homonyms are with out ever seeing a worksheet or hearing &quot;Today we are going to talk about synonyms, antonyms and homonyms.&quot;<br/>
One day, after she asked me how to spell bear, I said &quot;Which one?&quot;<br/>
I explained that there are different words that sound the same although they are spelled differently when they mean something different. Bear/bare, two/too/to/, One/won. She said Ohh.<br/>
I said, &quot;Isn&#39;t that cool? They&#39;re called homonyms.&quot;<br/>
Back to typing she went.<br/>
end of &quot;lesson&quot;.<br/>
Easy. Natural. It is MUCH more logical  to learn something new when you need to know it or in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, the only times I have heard the words synonym or antonym are on a homeschool discussion list or in a writing class. Most people say, &quot;What&#39;s another word for &lt;x&gt; or what is the opposite of...&quot;<br/>
Come to think of it, the times I&#39;ve heard someone say, &quot;what is the opposite of...&quot; they are usually talking to a little, little kid.<br/>

  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t rotate by design, tho I do try to do a couple of vettings a year -- we sit down with the collection of toys in each boy&#39;s room, go thru them for &#39;keep&#39; or &#39;give away&#39; and along the way, discover and unearth toys that had been long forgotten.  Some get kept and used, some just remembered and then put in the goodwill box.  Then there are the toys found in unplanned explorations when looking for a particular missing toy.  At our house, toy rotation and discovery is usually a by-product of cleaning. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sometimes I&#39;ll remember a particular toy or game because I&#39;ll see the boys doing something that reminds me of that play, and I&#39;ll haul out something new -- or old.  I also keep an eye out for things they like to use or that I know would add to their play.  <br/>

<br/>
It depends - would you have pulled them out and played with them because<br/>
YOU wanted to or were you just trying to get the kids interested in a<br/>
&quot;Fun science project&quot;? If *I* want to play with something/do something,<br/>
I&#39;ll pull it out and invite DS (and DH) along for the ride. If DS is<br/>
looking for something, I *might* *suggest* an item he hasn&#39;t pulled out<br/>
in a while but I am just as likely to suggest grabbing a deck of cards<br/>
or the dominoes or a movie to do together at that time as well (even if<br/>
we&#39;ve been playing cards for days and days recently). Maybe stop and<br/>
consider if you would do/say the same things if it was your spouse or a<br/>
friend. Do you &#39;initiate&#39; knitting with your best friend because her<br/>
knitting needles and yarn have been sitting on the shelf for 6 months?<br/>
Does your best friend &#39;initiate&#39; making candles because all the<br/>
candlemaking gear you bought last year has been sitting in the closet<br/>
for the last 10 months after you did a whole bunch of candlemaking over<br/>
last winter? Just because something was interesting, fascinating, fun 6<br/>
months ago does not mean it is still interesting, fascinating, fun<br/>
today. Just because something isn&#39;t of interest today doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
won&#39;t re-appear 6 months from now. There are things in our house that<br/>
are cyclic - for example, BrikWars usually only comes out during the<br/>
winter months when DH and DS are inside the house a lot and can spend<br/>
lots of time building the scenarios and playing out the games. DS is<br/>
rediscovering StarCraft on his laptop and playing many games with DH<br/>
each day - something that he hadn&#39;t touched in months. On the other<br/>
hand, he hasn&#39;t touched his Gameboy in quite a while and the videogames<br/>
he was playing over the summer are mostly sitting. But then again, last<br/>
winter I spent time knitting and learning a few pieces on the piano and<br/>
I haven&#39;t touched either in months - but I *am* currently enthralled by<br/>
making custom soaps (not totally from scratch - I buy the premade<br/>
glycerin soap base, handling the lye and such to make soap from scratch<br/>
is a little more hazardous than I care to get).<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, we do regularly dig through/up end some of the toy bins - quite<br/>
handily DS&#39; birthday is almost exactly 6 months away from Christmas, so<br/>
that makes for two very nice &quot;Hey let&#39;s clear out the old/broken toys to<br/>
make space&quot; times - and we often re-discover &quot;treasures&quot; in the process.<br/>
(doh - just reminded myself I need to set aside some time soon for this<br/>
lol). But there&#39;s no &quot;value&quot; judgment on any item or any thought of<br/>
&quot;this is &#39;educational&#39; so I should &#39;get&#39; him to play with it&quot;. What is<br/>
interesting is interesting, what isn&#39;t isn&#39;t and that&#39;s subject to<br/>
change totally.<br/>

<br/>
We have a pretty messy house, most of the time. Its small and full <br/>
to bursting with stuff, and neither George nor I really &quot;value&quot; <br/>
cleaning on a daily basis. I try to clean once a week, and do a <br/>
deeper cleaning once a month - the operative word being &quot;try&quot;! What <br/>
I find, especially with the deeper cleanings, is that in the process <br/>
of organizing and rearranging, older toys and games become visible <br/>
again and Mo is more likely to take an interest in them. <br/>
<br/>
Discovering this really helped me have a better attitude about <br/>
housework, by the way. Now I think of it as a type of strewing, or <br/>
maybe unstrewing, considering what my house looks like....<br/>

&gt; ********<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious, why does she need to do that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Over here in Austria you can homeschool, but only as long as your child learns the same stuff as at school. The children have to pass exams at the end of each school year, and if they fail, they have to repeat the year at a regular school, and you&#39;re not allowed to ever homeschool that child again.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to homeschool, you have to notify the administration before the school year starts, and have to redo that each year, I guess. You don&#39;t have to use the textbooks, but I feel like they&#39;re good for orientation. And we got them for free (they forgot about collecting the money or don&#39;t know that homeschoolers have to pay as well).<br/>
<br/>
So, my daughter doesn&#39;t have to do the workbooks, but she has to be able to write the letters (not read) and calculate (plus and minus) up to 20/30 (depends on the school that is testing) by the end of this school year. Othewise she&#39;ll have to attend a school.<br/>
<br/>
But, this year we&#39;re still free to &quot;fail&quot; because she&#39;s not yet &quot;obliged to be schooled/educated&quot;, compulsory schooling here starts at the age of six (you have to be six before September), so we &quot;missed&quot; it by 2 weeks (my dd was born on the Sept. 13th). That&#39;s why we can still withdraw if I see that we &quot;don&#39;t make it&quot;.<br/>
