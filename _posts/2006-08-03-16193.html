<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710321276">I&#39;ve been planning a tattoo for a couple of years.  I even found a  good <br/>
recommendation for a tattoo place here in Jacksonville but just  haven&#39;t been in <br/>
the right frame of mind (or brave enough :-) to do it.<br/>
 <br/>
We have family and friends in Albuquerque and I could get a couple of  <br/>
recommendations of good places to go if anyone would like me to.  I&#39;m  thinking if <br/>
I&#39;m going to get one it might be fun to do it during the  conference.<br/>
