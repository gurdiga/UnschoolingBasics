<div id="ygrps-yiv-154062589">I enjoy the relaxed nature of it all.  A typical evening around here <br/>
consists of Daddy getting home from work, supper together with <br/>
discussions ranging from funny happenings, interesting things, <br/>
animals, etc. seen, stories of who made who mad and why and how it <br/>
was resolved, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
After taking dishes over to the sink, we end up outside for the <br/>
evening, checking out the garden (digging potatoes, picking green <br/>
beans, checking tomatoes, etc.), watering flowers, watching the <br/>
chickens and baby chicks, riding bikes, and - what the kids LOVE to <br/>
do lately - playing baseball with Daddy.  They play catch, run to the <br/>
bases, hit the ball, and they would go all night if it didn&#39;t get <br/>
dark.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so relaxing and pleasing to hear the birds, see the wildlife, <br/>
and enjoy each other&#39;s company.  This is the second summer we have <br/>
suspended our satellite service (you can suspend it up to six <br/>
months), because we don&#39;t want to pay for it when we&#39;re outside or on <br/>
the go during this time of year.<br/>
