<div id="ygrps-yiv-886284992">Hi There,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking and reading and I like much of what I read here!<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 sons, ds#1 who is 11 and came out of school last July.  My youngest<br/>
son is going to be 3 in a few months time.  He is a bit of a handful (a<br/>
gorgeous one however!) - yeah, he takes a lot of energy!<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other folks on the list who have a similar situation with a<br/>
big age gap? <br/>
<br/>
My eldest (daniel) seems to be happy, but he is also a little bored, and<br/>
often seems at a loose end.  He complains sometimes about feeling lonely.<br/>
This is nto a huge issue, but I just feel that he does need to be doing<br/>
more.  I find I am often feelign so damn tired from the smaller one that my<br/>
creativity just kind of flies out the window.  I am not doing enough,<br/>
strewing enough.  I feel really lazy actually. Feel like I am just doing the<br/>
basics and nto much else (I mean survival basics).  <br/>
<br/>
SO often when I think about doing something with Dan, I get disheartened<br/>
because I know it will inevitably lead to little one wanting to get in on<br/>
it, and then Dan getting frustrated with him. I find this stresful. I find<br/>
my energy levels are not so good lately and so its very easy for me to talk<br/>
myself out of doing stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So - I guess this is prob less about a big age gap and more about whats<br/>
going on inside of me.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments / support much welcomed.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Hilary</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620730674">Any chance you can find someone to stay with little guy while you and <br/>
Dan go do something? Any chance that there&#39;s someone around (aunt, <br/>
uncle, cousin, neighbor, whoever) who is an ace at something Dan finds <br/>
interesting who would take him along sometimes (fishing, rebuilding <br/>
engines, cooking, painting, whatever)? Are there things around that <br/>
you could take Dan to as a &#39;drop off&#39; activity (he&#39;s old enough to <br/>
stay at an activity himself if he&#39;s comfortable with that)? Can he <br/>
volunteer somewhere with or without you? If you can find a couple <br/>
things that fit into your current situation and make them regular <br/>
things, it won&#39;t take a lot of effort long term. The &#39;getting going&#39; <br/>
is the hard part - maybe a time of brainstorming together is the first <br/>
order of business. What would he like to do? Then work together to <br/>
seek out opportunities for it. Use tidbits of time before the little <br/>
one is awake or after he falls asleep to talk about what you are <br/>
finding and make plans. Maybe even schedule a &quot;date&quot; for the two of <br/>
you to plan while someone else watches the little guy.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198987468">Ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Get out more - to places the 3 yo can run around, but which are <br/>
interesting, enriching, stimulating environments for Dan, too. I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of children&#39;s museums, the zoo, etc. Also - places like <br/>
McDonald&#39;s place space gives your little one something to do while you <br/>
and Dan talk or play cards or other simple games. We&#39;d go there and <br/>
spend hours - I&#39;d get a cup of coffee and the kids would get an ice <br/>
cream. We met some other homeschoolers there - doing the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Invite other homeschoolers over to hang out with Dan. Have a movie <br/>
night once a week. Or a gaming afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely go to park days - if you don&#39;t have park days to go to, <br/>
start a group. It is VERY VERY easy and doesn&#39;t take a lot of energy - <br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
See if Dan wants to sign up for something new - karate, 4H, etc., so <br/>
that he has something more on his calendar and something to work on at <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
Movies? Do you have Netflix? Dan could browse the movies looking for <br/>
those that interest him.<br/>
<br/>
Do you get to the library weekly?<br/>
<br/>
I know other people here will disagree but I&#39;m not at all opposed to a <br/>
couple of hours a few days per week of preschool for younger kids, to <br/>
give mom and older kids some time. I was lucky that my mom ran a <br/>
preschool, so my little ones could go to Grandma&#39;s school. And I know <br/>
it can be hard to find an old-fashioned non-academic free-play <br/>
non-daycare preschool. But they ARE still out there - many high schools <br/>
and community colleges have lab schools that are NOT academic and allow <br/>
kids to come for just a couple of hours a couple of days per week. <br/>
There are also such programs run by city recreation departments. This <br/>
option works very well when the younger kid is outgoing and social and <br/>
enjoys that extra time with a group of other children. Not all kids do.<br/>
<br/>
Or - maybe just set up a &quot;trading kids&quot; day with another mom. I&#39;m just <br/>
talking about a couple of hours - but then you can plan on having that <br/>
time with your older son and the two of you can plan ahead what you&#39;re <br/>
going to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to know what else to suggest without knowing your older son <br/>
- what his temperament is like and the kinds of things in which he is <br/>
interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813576383">Having sat and pondered more on this - maybe YOU are the one who needs <br/>
to get out more (or stay in and have the kids go out more). It sounds <br/>
like you really need a break on a regular basis where you can have <br/>
some time to yourself - some time to think deep thoughts and sip some <br/>
chai and feed your ownSelf without the phone and the cooking and the <br/>
cleaning and everything lurking out the corner of your eye and the <br/>
refrain of &quot;Mom, Mom, Mom&quot; in your ears. Maybe trade out both kids for <br/>
a time each week or have SO/grandma/sitter come over and you fo to <br/>
Barnes and Noble, pick up a magazine and a latte and relax for an hour.</div>

I have 2 sons, ds#1 who is 11 and came out of school last July.  My <br/>
youngest<br/>
son is going to be 3 in a few months time.  He is a bit of a handful (a<br/>
gorgeous one however!) - yeah, he takes a lot of energy!<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other folks on the list who have a similar situation with <br/>
a<br/>
big age gap?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 17 and nine, so yes. Cameron came out of school at 12 (the <br/>
end of sixth grade). Duncan was four.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My eldest (daniel) seems to be happy, but he is also a little bored, and<br/>
often seems at a loose end.  He complains sometimes about feeling <br/>
lonely.<br/>
This is nto a huge issue, but I just feel that he does need to be doing<br/>
more.  I find I am often feelign so damn tired from the smaller one <br/>
that my<br/>
creativity just kind of flies out the window.  I am not doing enough,<br/>
strewing enough.  I feel really lazy actually. Feel like I am just <br/>
doing the<br/>
basics and nto much else (I mean survival basics).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron spent his first 18 months out of school doing nothing biut <br/>
watching tv, sleeping, talking on the phone, and eating. So, yeah... it <br/>
seemed as if he were a bit bored! &lt;g&gt; But he was healing. From the <br/>
damage of school. He spent a good deal of time on the computer chatting <br/>
with friends, and we had someone over here as much as possible---or he <br/>
went there.<br/>
<br/>
This is a tough age. They sleep a lot---are you letting him sleep as <br/>
much as possible? As late as possible?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
SO often when I think about doing something with Dan, I get disheartened<br/>
because I know it will inevitably lead to little one wanting to get in <br/>
on<br/>
it, and then Dan getting frustrated with him. I find this stresful. I <br/>
find<br/>
my energy levels are not so good lately and so its very easy for me to <br/>
talk<br/>
myself out of doing stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The baby would probably enjoy just about everything Dan would like--on <br/>
a smaller scale. Just take him along! Duncan went everywhere with us. <br/>
In fact, Duncan went MORE places! I&#39;d tell Cameron that we (Duncan & I) <br/>
were going to the zoo, museum, beach, park, eat sushi.... whereever. <br/>
Did Cameron want to come with u?  It took a while for him to start <br/>
joining us, but he did.<br/>
<br/>
Now they are best buds. They do lots of things together---even with the <br/>
big age gap!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a few really bad days in a row here lately. Cameron took <br/>
Duncan out for the day to give me some space (that car is worth every <br/>
penny! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My best suggestion is for YOU to just DO. Let the boys tag along. Do <br/>
fun stuff. Things YOU never got to do as a child. Find wonder in <br/>
everything. BE interested. BE interesting! They&#39;ll join you when THEY <br/>
are ready!<br/>
