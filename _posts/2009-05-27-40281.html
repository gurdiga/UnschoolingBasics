<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754994804">Hi everyone - <br/>
<br/>
I had a lovely little personal change victory last night and wanted to share it with you...<br/>
<br/>
Now that we un-school, bedtime has become optional and over the past two months, both kids have become nocturnal creatures.  However, the kids admit that they are bummed about missing so many daytime opportunities lately simply because they&#39;ve been staying up all night and sleeping all day.  So, they&#39;ve decided that they want to become diurnal again and want my help in doing so.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was very late, and I came down to help my son transition to bed.  I was tired and cranky so my first try was rough and bossy, &quot;What are you doing???  You said you were coming to bed after the other show was done.  Don&#39;t you remember that we talked about getting sleep at night so we could be ready for fun stuff during the day...(blah, blah, blah, angry tone of voice, stern face.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His response was, of course, resistant.<br/>
<br/>
I went back up to bed scowling, thinking that I would have to give up and fall grumpily back to sleep.  Then, I somehow released my anger (that he wasn&#39;t listening to me) and fear (that I would never again get a normal night&#39;s sleep, that we&#39;d be stuck at home tomorrow while he slept all day).  Feeling calm I thought I&#39;d give it another try.  So, I walked back to the TV room.<br/>
<br/>
I went over to the sofa, started snuggling and gently tickling him.  In a playful voice and with playful words I invited him upstairs.  He responded, &quot;Mommy, I love you so much.  Let&#39;s go to bed.&quot;  Which we did!!!  We went up to our family bed and snuggled down.  He fell asleep in seconds!<br/>
<br/>
Letting go of bossy mom and taping into playful mom really helped last night!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
A book that I am reading right now is &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; by Lawrence Cohen.  Using PLAY to connect with LOVE is a brilliant approach, I think!  Playful parenting and Un-schooling are a perfect match for me!<br/>
<br/>
YAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
