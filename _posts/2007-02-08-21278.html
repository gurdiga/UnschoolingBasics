<div id="ygrps-yiv-614007726">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Amy. Australian mum to 11mo DD. I know this is quite a way off, but <br/>
it&#39;s one of my concerns for going ahead with unschooling - what are the <br/>
prospects for being able to get into university if you unschool? Have <br/>
any older unschoolers gotten into uni degrees?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to do something that will limit DD&#39;s career options in the <br/>
future. From my uni experience, i think unschooling would be really <br/>
helpful once you are actually *in* a uni degree because it is all about <br/>
self motivated learning, etc, but how difficult is it to actually get <br/>
in?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436473746">Depends on which &#39;uni&#39; and where - many places in the states accept a<br/>
parent issued &#39;diploma&#39; and transcript and/or a portfolio (depending on<br/>
what you intend to study). Some places even have folks in their<br/>
admissions staff who &#39;specialize&#39; in helping translate life experience<br/>
into what the school expects to see in a transcript. I know one family<br/>
here in CT, USA whose son was unschooled from the get go (never enrolled<br/>
in any school) who went on to college, got in no problem, double<br/>
majored, graduated high up in his class. Many places stateside just want<br/>
test scores and some idea of what background someone has. Also, many<br/>
folks start out in their teens taking a class or two here or there at<br/>
local community colleges which can help with getting into other<br/>
colleges. And, there are also online classes (college level) that people<br/>
take. Sometimes, too, waiting a bit before going to college is a good<br/>
option - working and then going to &#39;uni&#39; once you&#39;ve got a better idea<br/>
of where you want to be going (and have some money saved up) not only<br/>
helps on a life level (having a feel for direction and what you want)<br/>
but it also puts you in the &quot;non-traditional student&quot; category which is<br/>
looked at differently than straight-from-high-school. DH was accepted at<br/>
age 27 -before- his high school records got to the school and -before-<br/>
he took any standardized tests *because* he was a non-traditional<br/>
student.<br/>
By the time your DD is even close to &#39;uni&#39; age, there will have been<br/>
lots of unschooled/homeschooled folks already gone before her and the<br/>
requirements will likely have changed between now (when the first major<br/>
clump of unschoolers is starting to hit their teens) and then (when<br/>
there&#39;ll have been lots gone before her).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727004651">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
we are also in australia ï¿½ in northern nsw at the moment, though we  <br/>
have lived all around Aus including SA. We are RU parents of our dd  <br/>
(5yrs) and ds (11 months also)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Deb that by the time your dd gets there, should she  <br/>
choose to go that way, that there will be pathways for unschoolers  <br/>
into uni here in aus.<br/>
<br/>
However even now there are ways. My day job used to be as the  <br/>
&quot;selection officer&quot; for a design degree at monash uni in melb.  <br/>
Entrance was based on folio and a TER score (school score for yr 12).  <br/>
In Victoria it is policy to ignore the school score if a student has  <br/>
done two years of tafe or one year of uni elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the job for about 5 years and even during that time there  <br/>
were shifts where it was becoming more rare for students to get into  <br/>
uni straight from school. They usually had to go via a yr 13  <br/>
(specialist bridging programs) or tafe then then trasfer.<br/>
<br/>
It is definitely possible for someone who has not registered at  <br/>
school (we do not intend to register our children) to get into tafe  <br/>
and some unis in australia. My partner used to work for Vic Uni which  <br/>
is quite progressive and they had many programs to &quot;articulate&quot; non  <br/>
traditional or non schoolers into uni. Their focus were migrants.  <br/>
indigenous australians, mature age women and so on but the same  <br/>
principles and systems there would apply to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There are also many precedents in australia of unschoolers doing uni,  <br/>
though not systematic pathways yet to my knowledge. So lyn loxton who  <br/>
unschools her children and coordinates the Victorian Home Education  <br/>
Network... has a son who is now 25 and is doing his Phd in  <br/>
Aeronautical engineering at a melbourne university.<br/>
<br/>
For more South Australian info you might want to contact Beverley  <br/>
Paine who is one of the main unschooling advocates there, you may  <br/>
already be in contact? You can google her name and homeschooling and  <br/>
im sure you will find her (cant find her web site address now.)<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
