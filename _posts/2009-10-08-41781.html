<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051805023">My family and I (hubby, dtr-10, son-7, and 20 mo/old Yorkie) are trying to plan a trip to South Carolina this Sunday, Oct. 11th and returning Sat., Oct. 17th. We are hoping to trim costs, and meet new friends, by staying with an unschooling family on the way down and the way back. Anyone available for a short visit?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
