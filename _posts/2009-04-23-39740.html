<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464068657">If you lived in a State that did not allow you to unschool, would you<br/>
move? Would you put them in public school? If they did not allow you<br/>
the freedom to wait until they are 10 or older to learn to read at<br/>
their own pace, and required you to put them in school, would you stand<br/>
for it?<br/>

I would absolutely move.  We also own our home, but I&#39;d walk away from it in a hot minute if living if I couldn&#39;t live as I want to.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a piece of land with a building on it.  Weighed against my children&#39;s whole lives, it&#39;s nothing. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is no state in which unschooling is impossible, though. There are <br/>
people happily unschooling in every state. Some people have more hoops <br/>
to jump through and they&#39;ve figured out how to do it in such a way that <br/>
it does not interfere with or impact their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t move because I love where I live, and I have a very close <br/>
extended family that lives within a few miles of each other. My sisters&#39; <br/>
families and mine are close - I see my sisters a couple of times per <br/>
week and the cousins hang out together regularly.  I value that a lot. <br/>
If my kids had to take tests or I had to fill out some paperwork or do <br/>
some sort of portfolio - we&#39;d manage.<br/>
