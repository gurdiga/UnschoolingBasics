<div id="ygrps-yiv-612887092">&quot;I did take offense to your post because you were calling my observation<br/>
nonsense.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a post bothers someone, stick to discussing the issues, not the persons post please.<br/>
<br/>
What I read, is that Robyn questioned the validity of basing an entire philosophy on three people. Anecdotal evidence can be useful, but basing an opinion on three people&#39;s experience is shoddy evidence at best.<br/>
Let&#39;s stick to discussing ideas. If a post offends, or causes ruffled feathers, maybe that&#39;s a time to question why. There may be some deep hurt dredged up, but it isn&#39;t the responsibility of the poster questioning, to know each persons past and issues.<br/>
Robyn questioned faulty logic.<br/>
I hope people always do that. I am very positive she meant no hurt feelings, it wasn&#39;t about a person, it was about ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s get back to discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
