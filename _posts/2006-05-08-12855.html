you can homeschool in Alabama (unless you have a certified teaching<br/>
certificate and then  you have to follow state guidelines and mandates).<br/>
The cool thing is that with these cover schools the only thing they are<br/>
concerned with is attendance.  &quot;How many days did your child attend<br/>
homeschool?&quot;  Uh, 365.  (rolling eyes).  I find it very interesting how each<br/>
state differs in what they require.  In one state you just homeschool.<br/>
While another state wants the whole curriculum laid out and what you intend<br/>
to study and documentation and testing.  What I find highly ironic is that<br/>
the state that is the easiest to homeschool in (Texas) has the most strict<br/>
public school attendance policies.  You cannot take a family vacation in<br/>
Texas if your children are in public school.  Missed days other than being<br/>
sick or attending the funeral of an *immediate* family member are considered<br/>
unexucused!  It&#39;s two radically different messages.  One side says, &quot;Parents<br/>
have the ability to make good decisions for their children&quot; and the other<br/>
side says, &quot;Parents are incapable of making good decisions for their<br/>
children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always curious how other families work around their state laws to<br/>
unschool.<br/>

have to tell them you&#39;re homeschooling, although if you pull in the  <br/>

think, is how homeschoolers are classified in TX - which would have <br/>
me scanning the legal process for any changes to private school <br/>
regulations regularly). If your child has never been enrolled you <br/>
are not required to do anything, legally. Some people choose to file <br/>
a notice of intent and keep a portfolio. My MIL hsed (not <br/>
unschooled) for about 5 or 6 years (SILs 2 & 3) and filed NOI and <br/>
kept a portfolio - and was NEVER asked to bring it in to show. It is <br/>
up to the school district to make the appointment and they never <br/>
did. DS has never been enrolled in anything so we just kept living <br/>
large as he turned 5 and 6 and 7 and now he&#39;s about to be 8.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s legally in a part of the statutes that came over, almost <br/>
completely intact, from the original 1650 code that governed the new <br/>
colony of CT.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, isn&#39;t home education allowed as an &#39;alternative <br/>
option&#39; under Oklahoma&#39;s state constitution?<br/>

Actually, here in Texas, we don&#39;t have any connections to private schools at<br/>
all. ( I don&#39;t even know what, if any, regulations are put on private<br/>
schools here in TX.) We also don&#39;t have to inform anyone unless our children<br/>
are already in PS and that is only a letter of intent to homeschool. We are<br/>
considered a private school meaning the state doesn&#39;t tell us what we can<br/>
and can&#39;t do, only that we use a bona fide curriculum (doesn&#39;t say what that<br/>
is) and that we cover basic subjects, but unless there is an issue you will<br/>
likely never hear from the school district or state. <br/>
<br/>
Texas has some of the loosest laws in the country as far as homeschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848374929">I used to live in Texas and there are no hsing laws there. No registration, no testing, no curriculum requirements, etc. Here in Oregon hsers are required to register and parents are required to have their children tested at grades, 3,5,8,and 10 and keep results on file. A lot of unschoolers in OR deal woth this by simply not registering. I don&#39;t know anyone who has ever been tracked down or asked to produce test scores. For me it is a bit of a doubled edged sword, if I register I have to subject the kids to be tested, if I don&#39;t we miss out on a lot of great resources in our community for registered homeschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153591908">The constitution states that attendance in PS is necessary unless  <br/>
another means of education is provided. There are no other  <br/>
definitions of other means, so it leaves it wide open for us. There  <br/>
are no requirements, no reporting, no testing. It does state that it  <br/>
should take 180 days (minus five days for &#39;teacher training&#39;) of  <br/>
instruction, but there are no guidelines for curriculum or level  <br/>
reached.<br/>
I do keep track of what we&#39;ve done, so that I can see what we had fun  <br/>
with and remember to bring it up another time, or see what no one had  <br/>
fun with, and remember not to push it again. :-P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What you do is go in during their Educator Appreciation days (they <br/>
have them two or three times per year). Bring in your Virginia card <br/>
and say, sweetly and innocently as you can &quot;We moved up here not long <br/>
ago and now my B&N educator card, that we used so often, is about to <br/>
expire. Can I just renew it here? Is there a form I need to do to <br/>
transfer it?&quot; If you&#39;ve got a Borders Books near you, maybe go there <br/>
as well (again during Educator&#39;s days). I&#39;ve found that if one store <br/>
gives me any trouble, a simple &quot;oh okay, no problem, I can probably <br/>
get this same item over at &lt;your competitor&gt; with the discount. Thanks <br/>
anyway.&quot; Here in CT, as with where you are, there is no paperwork. <br/>
Borders knows that. The B&N store near them just opened last year and <br/>
when they first opened, apparently they had no idea because they were <br/>
just parroting some &#39;standard regulations&#39; which have no bearing on <br/>
home education in this state. They gave me such a hard time that I <br/>
just walked out and told the manager I&#39;d just shop at Borders from <br/>
then on. And I let my local homeschooling friends know about it too. <br/>
Within about 3 months they had their Ed Days and I walked in and asked <br/>
to get the card, marked down homeschool for &quot;School name&quot; and they <br/>
didn&#39;t say a word. Guess they got an earful!<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to have a magazine or newsletter on homeschooling <br/>
(HEM, a local group newsletter, whatever) with your name on the pre-<br/>
printed label (that&#39;s important) and show them that if they get picky. <br/>
I doubt they will though - homeschoolers are a HUGE book market.<br/>

just stated that we were homeschoolers. They asked if we were with any kind<br/>
of organization or group and I said, &quot;We have a homeschool playgroup&quot; and<br/>
that was good enough.  They didn&#39;t even ask for verification.  Although I<br/>
did sign up back in the media portion of the store, so maybe he just didn&#39;t<br/>
know he was supposed to see something :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Texas, the Leeper Decision says, in effect, that homeschooling is  <br/>
the equivalent of a private school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The parents of school-age children in Texas need only home school  <br/>
&quot;in a bona fide manner&quot; (not a sham or subterfuge), have a curriculum  <br/>
&quot;consisting of books, workbooks, other written materials, including  <br/>
that which appears on a computer screen or video tape monitor, . . .  <br/>
developed or obtained from any source&quot;, and the curriculum must be  <br/>
&quot;designed to meet basic education goals of reading, spelling,  <br/>
grammar, mathematics and a study of good citizenship.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If Texans follow the recipe above, they are exempt from mandatory  <br/>
attendance in the public schools, and are in effect, operating a  <br/>
private school for their own children.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845688115">Well, I kind of already said it before, but I&#39;ll repeat for your  <br/>
official records. Oklahoma&#39;s constitution states that attendance in  <br/>
PS is necessary unless another means of education is provided. There  <br/>
are no other definitions of other means, so it leaves it wide open  <br/>
for us. There are no requirements, no reporting, no testing. It does  <br/>
state that it should take 180 days (minus five days for &#39;teacher  <br/>
training&#39;) of instruction, but there are no guidelines for curriculum  <br/>
or level reached. Unschooling is quite easy here, because of the lack  <br/>
of requirements, but it is rare to find unschoolers, much less RU.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled our kids out of school, and didn&#39;t receive slack for it,  <br/>
and haven&#39;t had any problems. There are a lot of support groups  <br/>
officially and unofficially. HERO, NAHE, OCHEC, and COACH are a few I  <br/>
can think of, but they all are school at homer&#39;s really, I think. I  <br/>
also believe there is one in Tulsa, but I can&#39;t specifically think of  <br/>
the name. There is one unschooling group, but very small and I was  <br/>
kind of disappointed at the curriculum talk the one playgroup I  <br/>
visited. Much less the hairy eyeballs that we got when the kids  <br/>
picked out their junky snacks or talked about videogames and movies!  <br/>
There is a list with a further spread than what I&#39;ve met  <br/>
IRL...unschoolingchristiansinokcmetro, and the owner of  <br/>
homeschoolinginokcmetro is an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Also check here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://oklahomahomeschooling.org/support.htm">http://oklahomahomeschooling.org/support.htm</a> almost  <br/>
all of them say christian groups, but most of them IRL aren&#39;t that  <br/>
