&gt; grades and all  the other BS that goes along with schooling. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ren, thank-you so much for suggesting these thoughts to me again. I have  <br/>
thought about this and it&#39;s the reason I&#39;m not &quot;making&quot; her get out of that  <br/>
school. The other day when the school said she was going to be moved to the  other <br/>
team she was hysterically crying. She didn&#39;t think it was right, that she  <br/>
has to &quot;change&quot; her whole life for this teacher, and that the teacher should  <br/>
have been fired. I explained that this is the school&#39;s decision, they&#39;re not  <br/>
going to penalize the teacher for the things she&#39;s done, and the only thing  <br/>
Nicholle (my daughter) can do is stay there and move to the new team, stay  home <br/>
for either home schooling or unschooling, or move to another school (we  have <br/>
school choice here). She was not for either home schooling idea, and I  didn&#39;t <br/>
push it. I&#39;ve given her the choices, explained thoroughly what she can  <br/>
expect from each choice, and express my opinion without giving her a permanent  <br/>
decision from me. However, we have come to the conclusion that if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
make it into a votech school for high school next year than she will finish her  <br/>
schooling at home. There&#39;s just no way she&#39;ll make it through a full day&#39;s <br/>
worth  of schooling in the higher grades, even her teachers this year have said <br/>
this.  So, this is the reason I&#39;m still researching all of our possibilities, <br/>
learning  from all of you ladies here, learning the laws, and basically <br/>
anything else I  can research. Anyways, thank you ladies for all of the good <br/>
information and  support that you give me here.  <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Beth<br/>

<br/>
Has she read &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;?<br/>
That might open her mind up to the possibilities that await her<br/>
outside of school. It&#39;s really frightening for a lot of kids to think<br/>
about leaving behind the structure they&#39;ve known their whole<br/>
lives...especially when their whole social group is centered around it.<br/>
<br/>
Teacher&#39;s unions make it very difficult (if not impossible) for a<br/>
teacher to be fired. It&#39;s lame, it&#39;s unfair, but if she&#39;s in the<br/>
system than it&#39;s part of the package unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Just focus on enjoying activites together when she&#39;s not in school,<br/>
try to give less power to the grades and such and get her that book!!:)<br/>
