<div id="ygrps-yiv-33293815">Andy has been dressing the night before for at least 3 yrs now.  He puts a lot of thought into what he wears -- what&#39;s happening the next day, what matches (in his perception, not always what others would consider a matching outfit) -- and often he shows me what he chose as I&#39;m on my way to bed.  He&#39;ll ask if it&#39;s okay for tomorrow -- not that I&#39;ve ever said no, but he still checks with me.<br/>
   <br/>
  Clothes and hair were two battles I gave up years ago -- when Will who is 21 now, was 4 I realized it was much easier (and faster being a working single Mom) to let him dress himself.  As long as it was clean enough for school, I didn&#39;t care what he wore. I&#39;ve always figured hair will grow, their tastes will change and hair is such a big part of identity, why fight it at all?  Besides, as has happened with all the boys in my family since the beginning of time, their hair will get very curly in their teens, severely limiting their style choices, that they might as well enjoy it now.  Will started shaving his head at 16, flirted with a brief period of shoulder-length, and now wears it shaved again.  He&#39;s decided that curly hair is just too much trouble to keep up with. <br/>

night before but I do make them flannel pj pants and nightgowns.  They<br/>
love them.  Most days we hang out in our pjs until lunch time, unless we<br/>

&gt; ahhhhh, kindred spirits!  We too spend the first part of the day in play<br/>
&gt; clothes set # 1 which is what we slept in the night before. I make my kids<br/>
&gt; super easy play pants with whatever cool material they like. These with a<br/>
&gt; tshirt are usually fine for hanging out in the neighborhood. My daughter <br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; also fond of wearing costumes around - and I figure when else in your life<br/>
&gt; will you be able to be so free??? Maybe I would enjoy grocery shopping <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; if I was dressed up like a sparkly princess!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Clothes and hair were two battles I gave up years ago -- when Will who is 21 now, was 4 I realized it was much easier (and faster being a working single Mom) to let him dress himself.  As long as it was clean enough for school, I didn&#39;t care what he wore. I&#39;ve always figured hair will grow, their tastes will change and hair is such a big part of identity, why fight it at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Long before I started unschooling, actually when Emily was a toddler,<br/>
I decided that there were &quot;big issues&quot; and &quot;little issues.&quot;  Big<br/>
issues revolved around safety things - those motherly fears about<br/>
semi-trucks running over our babies or evil kidnappers stealing them -<br/>
those sort of safety issues.  Little issues were just that &quot;the small<br/>
stuff&quot;  and I wasn&#39;t going to sweat it (long before the popular series<br/>
of &quot;don&#39;t sweat&quot; books came out).  These were hair, clothes,<br/>
piercings, and even language.  I decided if I made a big deal about<br/>
those things then they would become a big deal.  If I didn&#39;t, then<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t.  About the only thing that I have asked of the kids<br/>
(mostly the girls because they are of that age) is to watch their<br/>
language around other people who don&#39;t understand our relaxed approach<br/>
to language and how some people just are shocked by hearing an 11 (or<br/>
even a 14) yo say &quot;the D word&quot; or &quot;the S word&quot; or even &quot;the F word.&quot;<br/>
We also request that they use the words in correct context.  Some<br/>
people might think that our children are &quot;foul mouthed&quot; but if they<br/>
stop and think about it, they probably &quot;cuss&quot; a lot less than other<br/>
kids their ages (who are doing it behind their parents&#39; backs) and<br/>
they are using the words in &quot;appropriate&quot; ways (dropping a hammer on<br/>
their toe, cutting their finger, in frustration over something not<br/>
working like they had wanted, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
My big thing is wrinkles.  I hate wrinkles.  I will ask a child to<br/>
take off a shirt (or skirt) so I can iron it.  They realize that it is<br/>
mom&#39;s issue and laugh at me ignoring the spaghetti spot, but fussing<br/>
over the wrinkles.  And sometimes I just sigh inwardly and remind<br/>
myself that the wrinkles are my issue not their issue.<br/>
<br/>
Hair grows out and can always be colored.  I&#39;ve seen the girls go<br/>
through &quot;girly pink crazy&quot; to &quot;sober dark goth&quot;  (although Emily will<br/>
defy vehemently that she is not Goth - she is individualistic)  :)  I<br/>
was never allowed that freedom.  I had to dress a certain way and<br/>
present myself a certain way.  I adored black when I was in high<br/>
school but I wasn&#39;t allowed to wear black because &quot;my coloring just<br/>
isn&#39;t right for black&quot; and I was a &quot;summer&quot; and summer&#39;s shouldn&#39;t<br/>
wear black.  So I have given them free range of the color pallette and<br/>
let them wear the colors of their choosing - and they always look<br/>
great - even in their individualistic ways!<br/>
<br/>
They are just clothes (and hair and names and styles and piercings)<br/>
and it will all change!<br/>
