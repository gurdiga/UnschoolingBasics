<div id="ygrps-yiv-948335419">The only place I could think to turn to for help with my 4 yr old&#39;s current passion. I am trying to learn how to play Bakugan and who are all the different battle brawlers are. Is there anyone else who has a Bakugan fan in their midst that might be able to point me in the right direction? I have seen my son get excited over super heroes, Ben10, and several others but Bakugan seems to be the ultimate with him right now and he is more excited about this than anything else he has been in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426714764">I&#39;m right there with you! This is my 12 year old&#39;s newest passion, so I am &quot;brawling&quot; every day because he hasn&#39;t found any other kids in the neighborhood to brawl with, lol! Every time I get the hang of something, he finds a new passion, I was getting really good at yugioh, lol!<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
