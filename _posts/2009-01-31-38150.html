<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042410568">I started Unschooling last year, and found it fantastic, but over the<br/>
December holidays those awful doubts started creeping in again. I have<br/>
had NO indication that my child has actually learned anything over the<br/>
past year, and of course all the extended family were asking him<br/>
questions about his year and what he had learned and he had no answers<br/>
for them. So I felt terrible, and &#39;fell off the wagon&#39; and got out all<br/>
the old books again. Cringe. We have had a horrible couple of weeks,<br/>
and I can see my son&#39;s eyes glazing over, even though i tried giving<br/>
him a choice of what &#39;schoolish&#39; things we did. Have I undone<br/>
everything? I just can&#39;t shake the &#39;guilt&#39; I feel when leaving him to<br/>
his own interests, maybe because I am not seeing any concrete learning<br/>
happening. Please help me to let go permanently!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834513886">I don&#39;t know if I can help you let go permanently, but I can for this<br/>
moment:<br/>
<br/>
1) Take a deep breath, all the way into your tummy.<br/>
2) Take another.<br/>
<br/>
In this moment, right now - Is your son happy? Is he interested in<br/>
things? If you pulled him out of school, or you were school-at-homing,<br/>
he may not seem to be, because he&#39;s still deschooling, which can look<br/>
a lot like &quot;doing nothing all day&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, let him heal,<br/>
and you can ask for specific things to help with deschooling on this<br/>
list and others.<br/>
<br/>
If he is happy and interested, that&#39;s a great start! If you aim your<br/>
compass for joy, help your son aim his the same, and let that be your<br/>
touchstone and way of being, that is really all you need. Learning<br/>
WILL happen. You can&#39;t stop it from happening. It will NOT look like<br/>
school learning, and he more than likely won&#39;t be able to articulate<br/>
what he&#39;s learning, but it *is* happening. Aim for joy. That is ALL<br/>
you need to be concerned with: what will help make my son happy in<br/>
this moment? Those moments after moments add up. You will soon forget<br/>
school even exists, and those doubting days will be no more - honest!<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;leave kids to their own interests&quot; - we are WITH<br/>
kids in their own interests, as much as the kid desires or needs. It&#39;s<br/>
about connection, connection, connection - a concept I didn&#39;t *really*<br/>
get &#39;til I&#39;d been unschooling for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
Go to an unschooling conference! There are many, all around the US<br/>
this year. And outside the US, too! Let us know where you are, and we<br/>
can point you to the closest.<br/>
<br/>
This is from the Sudbury Valley School site - so it&#39;s not an<br/>
unschooler, exactly, but it sums up learning through life so well:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;d say, &quot;What did you learn today?&quot; and we&#39;d think, &quot;What did we<br/>
learn today? What are you talking about?&quot; Because it wasn&#39;t as if you<br/>
went into the library and learned your facts for the day. You had a<br/>
dozen conversations with people. We weren&#39;t learning subject by<br/>
subject. We were learning in a much more organic manner. You would be<br/>
doing a lot of different things and you would learn them in little<br/>
bits and pieces that would start adding up to much bigger pictures.<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t really know where it came from a lot of the time. By the<br/>
time you were done learning about something, information was coming<br/>
from so many different sources, from books and from people you were<br/>
talking to, and from a long drawn out experience, that you had no idea<br/>
how you learned it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For those bits and pieces to happen, support your son in doing what he<br/>
loves to do - or even just likes! I&#39;ll say it again: it will not look<br/>
like school learning. But is IS learning, learning with your whole<br/>
heart and mind and body. It&#39;s amazing and miraculous and such an<br/>
incredible way to live! So even if you haven&#39;t let go in your mind,<br/>
pretend like you have in your actions. Your mind will follow!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840037558">Thank you for you post and for all who responded.  I too have felt I <br/>
have regressed.  I think what happens to &quot;new unschoolers&quot; is that we <br/>
TRY to unschool instead of realizing that we KNOW how already.  I know <br/>
we tend to just let the kids &quot;be&quot; and forget that it is important to be <br/>
with them and learn with them.  I realized yesterday that my kids were <br/>
not having interests because I wasn&#39;t interested.  I made the mistake <br/>
of thinking unschooling was nonschooling.  Does that make sense? When <br/>
they watched a shoe baout volcanoes, I did hte dishes. Not exactly <br/>
supportive.  My point is...it is important to BE with them and not just <br/>
leave them to find their way.  Especially at first. Anyway, thank you <br/>
for posting.  Sometimes we think that the post is just for ourselves, <br/>
but it turns out to save someone else.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727490395">Wow, this really hit the nail on the head - unschooling vs. nonschooling.  I think that is what many of my family/friends think and sometimes I perpetuate that stereotype by saying I don&#39;t DO anything.  What I then go on to explain is that I facilitate their interests but I help them the best when I get out of their way until they show an interest or are interested in something we are exploring as a family.  Not everyone gets this and they question the fact that I don&#39;t &quot;Do&quot; anything.<br/>
 <br/>
My 8 yo and I are now doing a Math program because he asked for it.  We work about 15 minutes a day on it when he is interested, but if he is not, we leave it be.  When we were &quot;doing&quot; school at age 6ish, I would be &quot;teaching&quot; him something and he would disengage, aske when we would be finished, and was out the door as soon as I would let him.  Now that he asks for the stuff and we do things according to his interests, he is actually learning.  That certainly isn&#39;t &quot;nonschooling&quot; to me.  Thanks for the clarification and the use of the two words together to understand what some people think!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524796522">Heather I know what you mean.� I say I do not DO anything also and get such harsh looks at times. If you give my 8 yr old a workbook or something from &quot;school&quot; he hates to write anything as he is Dyslexic they say, well to me he has eye tracking issues, but is fine. Well I got him a few pen pals from a Homeschool Yahoo Penpal group and he has NO PROBLEM writing to them. AND he has a map puzzle he goes and finds where they live on the map! A two fold purpose to write to penpals! If I asked him to write a paragraph in a workbook he would be having a fit. But to write to pen pals is not an issue, he enjoys that! He is sending them Valentines this weekend. His handwriting has improved and his cursive started on his own. He is doing it by himself and I dare say he writes better than I do at times! LOL� So non forced learning is where they really learn...just wish school had been that way with me!<br/>
