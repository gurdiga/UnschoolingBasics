How do you explain to your local Public Education board (especially if you at one time had a child in the public school system) as to how you base your day <br/>
when they want an account of your children&#39;s daily educational plans <br/>
how we as parents assess the children reaching their goals so you can move forward<br/>
and so forth <br/>

&gt; Actually, it was Professor Pippy P. Poopypants. But you were <br/>
close. My mother was horrified that not only did I allow my <br/>
children to read these gross books but that we actually found them <br/>
funny! I think the author is ingenious!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Yes they generally use his middle initial P. but check the books <br/>
again, that P. stands for PeePee. Really. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pilkey.com/showquiz.php?id=19">http://www.pilkey.com/showquiz.php?id=19</a> is a quiz on trivia from <br/>
the book and one question is what is the prof&#39;s middle name and <br/>
PeePee is the right answer.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re knee deep in Captain Underpants - but then again we&#39;ve also <br/>
got an underwear ball in the living room - made of DS&#39; old, too <br/>
small, little boy briefs. The size of a volleyball but soft and <br/>
weighty almost like a medicine ball. MIL still chuckles every time <br/>
she sees it - yet another sign of her wonderfully wacky son and <br/>
grandson.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do we just &quot;pick&quot; a &quot;grade&quot; she is in based on <br/>
her age? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Grades are for meat and eggs, not children.<br/>
Why do you feel the need for a grade?<br/>

In NY we need to identify a grade in our paperwork for the state. It is required to file paperwork the year a child turns six by December. Some folks identify their child as first grade while others indicate kindergarten.<br/>

***In NY we need to identify a grade in our paperwork for the state.***<br/>
<br/>
While I feel some irritation at my own state requirements I&#39;m glad to be<br/>
living where things are fairly simple. <br/>
The county sup requires notification each year if a family is<br/>
homeschooling but the law does not specify what the notification must<br/>
include. Mine says &quot;I&#39;ll be homeschooling my child for the 2004-2005<br/>
school year.&quot; I do not include his name or age. <br/>
<br/>
The law says I have to keep an attendance record and make it available if<br/>
asked. I always wait until asked. <br/>
<br/>
The law also says I have to have an organized course of study and cover<br/>
what the schools would cover but there is no provision in the law that<br/>
would allow the county superintendent (or anyone) to ask for or about the<br/>
course of study or what we&#39;re covering.<br/>
<br/>
No portfolio, no assessment, no testing. <br/>
<br/>
If any nice unschoolers would like to move to Deer Lodge, Montana (and<br/>
heck! who wouldn&#39;t?) there&#39;s a house for sale across the street. <br/>

I don&#39;t know the regs in RI - but here in NY there are samples of <br/>
forms that can be submitted.  Be sure to read your state regs <br/>
carefully.  It is not unknown for local officials to ask for more <br/>
than is required.  Sometimes they need to be gently and <br/>
diplomatically educated as to what is required of a family to hs.  <br/>
I&#39;ve replied to local liason sighting the number of a specific reg <br/>
when informing of our use for assesment rather than testing as an <br/>
option here in NY.  Your best bet is to contact homeschoolers in RI <br/>
and find out what format they&#39;ve used that has been accepted.  <br/>
Certainly try to find unschoolers in RI and ask them how they&#39;ve <br/>
managed the system.<br/>
<br/>
I keep my paperwork vague...eg: my dd will read, write and work with <br/>
numbers and mathematical concepts on a daily basis.  She will learn <br/>
social studies, geography, history, sciences, etc. through her varied <br/>
interests and activities.  We will use books from our home and public <br/>
library as well as resources from internet, video and film.  Her <br/>
teachers will include family, friends and community resources. Arts, <br/>
physical activity and health will be addressed regularly.  <br/>
<br/>
If your state required numbers of hours spent on each &quot;academic&quot; <br/>
activity, you can look up what is required, divide it by the numbers <br/>
of days in school year and put forth that he/she will spend those <br/>
hours per day or week on the required subjects.  <br/>
<br/>
As for testing, don&#39;t know about RI, but in NY there is a list of <br/>
test to chose from, some can be given at home. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the main point, is to educate yourself as to your rights <br/>
within your state as to what is needed and DO NO MORE THAN THAT.<br/>
<br/>
And if Montana had ocean property...i&#39;d consider moving there...<br/>
BTW - if you can move across the state line to CT the homeschooling <br/>
regs are pretty loose and I understand that there are many <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

Check your state LAWS - the istrict can NOT ask for more than the <br/>
state allows for, even if they think they can (and I know RI has a <br/>
lot of local leeway but NOT daily listings and such).</div>
