<div id="ygrps-yiv-974064818">&quot;I always take a notebook to a restaurant so I can write down ideas or<br/>
words or phrases I might want to use in some awful poem or story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I carry a notebook with me ALWAYS.<br/>
I hide in coffee shops, my van or the breakroom during lunchbreaks at<br/>
work and write. I hide in my closet at home and write. I sit online<br/>
and write. I wake up at weird hours and get up to write. I sometimes<br/>
see pictures and words in my head and can&#39;t sleep for the life of me,<br/>
and jot them down so they won&#39;t get lost.<br/>
<br/>
Am I &quot;obsessed&quot; or passionate? I feel that if I couldn&#39;t write on any<br/>
given day, I&#39;d be suffocating. I NEED to write. I process all of my<br/>
frenetic/hyper energy by writing. I process my life, my ideas and<br/>
self-analyze by writing. It&#39;s how I cope, it&#39;s how I breathe, it&#39;s how<br/>
I find joy.<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;obsessions&quot; are the road to passion. I think passion is the<br/>
BEST way to learn and unless your passions are honored fully and<br/>
completely (especially for a child) there is going to be an internal<br/>
struggle that doesn&#39;t need to exist.<br/>
<br/>
People need to move in the direction of their dreams. Following their<br/>
hearts desires and passions at a young age is the road to a lifetime<br/>
of the same....something sorely lacking in our world.<br/>

and obsessions, let&#39;s all be thankful that Bill Gates was allowed to pursue<br/>
his obsession of computers.  He revolutionized the home computer industry.<br/>
While there were other companies out there at the same time (Compaq and<br/>
Apple come to mind) it was Gates&#39; passion that put us where we are now.<br/>
Think about your passions/obsessions and those of your children&#39;s.  What<br/>
would they be if they were given the ability to flourish?<br/>

I recently read a book about this called &quot;Exuberance&quot;.   One of the examples <br/>
was John Muir, one was Snowflake Bentley and another, I think was <br/>
Einstein.... people who seemed to take a giant joy in some particular aspect <br/>
of reality and became absorbed in it and were able to share their passion <br/>
and help others to see something they had never been aware of before.<br/>

Yes, we seem to be living in a society where if you&#39;re not a <br/>
jack-of-all-trades&quot; then you somehow fall short.  When did it become<br/>
socially unacceptable to follow your passions to the fullest?  <br/>

HA! As a Jack (or Jill perhaps)-of-all-trades I&#39;ve always felt that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t as acceptable as being REALLY great at one or two things.<br/>
I still have a hard time focusing on one way to make money....my<br/>
income is usually cobbled together with several ongoing interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572696447">I guess I see parents killing their kids by forcing (instead of letting them<br/>
choose how busy they want to be) them to be in everything... instead of<br/>
letting them focus on just one or two interests and letting them dive deep<br/>
into them.<br/>
<br/>
Though I do see your view, too.   :)<br/>

Again, Ren hit the nail on the head for me!  This is SO completely <br/>
relevent to how I have been feeling.  When I was reading about <br/>
the &quot;obsession&quot; I was thinking how relieved I would be if I had an <br/>
obsession, if my children had an obsession.  Then, I would feel myself <br/>
with purpose.  I would not feel myself floating through life.  I would <br/>
be flying!<br/>
