<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177592835">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Melissa and my husband Ian and I have 4 kiddos Corbin is 8 <br/>
years old, Ethan 7, Skyler 4, and Zoe 2 1/2. We&#39;re relatively new to <br/>
this and believe in the unschooling philosophy more so than &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot; and such. So, we&#39;d just like to say Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
