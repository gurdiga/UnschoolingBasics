I&#39;m really !@#$%^& glad we don&#39;t let something as superficial as <br/>
language get in the way our relationship.<br/>

<br/>
Liam&#39;s really digging learning Japanese, but what he *really* wants <br/>
to know is, among other things of course, how to swear in <br/>
Japanese.  I don&#39;t think Rosetta Stone can help us with that, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now I think of it, if anyone has any resources to point us <br/>
in for learning Japanese swear words, we&#39;d be ever grateful!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve heard several times is that swearing isn&#39;t the same there.  <br/>
When they go at each other they use impolite forms of address and  <br/>
impolite forms of words. Which sounds too polite but not so in  <br/>
context ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you type in &quot;japanese swearing&quot;, there are several pages about it.  <br/>
But maybe he already has an inkling about this.<br/>
