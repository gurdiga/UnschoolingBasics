I like to think that we&#39;re communicating with all list members, not one<br/>
poster, when we send a reply.  Others are following the thread and a good<br/>
topic can have a life of it&#39;s own (for as long as it lasts) regardless of<br/>
who&#39;s coming or going.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you responded.  You addressed what sometimes gets overlooked in<br/>
these discussions - how and why an unschooling parent begins to recognize<br/>
and correct the misuse of power within the relationship.  It was a very<br/>
good post.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951430309">Oh,but I totally agree! I come from a long line of religious fanatics within the family/community (Alabama) that totally believes if you don&#39;t spank then you are not only failing your child you are failing God!<br/>
  I found unschooling(radical unschooling list!) quite by accident on the enternet just a few weeks before the unschooling conference in massachussets and drove from bama there.<br/>
  I have bipolar kids and the best medicine I have ever found for them is unschooling....radically!<br/>
  Of course my family/community thinks we are all going to hell and taking the kids with us!hehehe!<br/>
