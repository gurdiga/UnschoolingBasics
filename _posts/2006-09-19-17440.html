<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614373832">I have a question that I hope you all can help me with. How do you <br/>
approach your husband with the principles of radical unschooling <br/>
when we&#39;ve both been raised with traditional parenting, public <br/>
schooling, etc.? We have homeschooled the past 3 years, but I just <br/>
found out about unschooling recently.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the radical unschooling idea, but I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
everything I can (I just got Rue&#39;s book today - YAY!) & have begun <br/>
to implement some of the principles I&#39;m learning (like saying Yes <br/>
more, etc.) <br/>
<br/>
I cringe at the thought of how controlling we have been with our <br/>
kids in the past! I&#39;m trying to correct that now, but I want to <br/>
discuss this with my husband & share these new ideas with him & I <br/>
want to do so in a way that will not put him on the defensive.<br/>
<br/>
My husband thinks if the kids don&#39;t finish their dinner, then they <br/>
should have no dessert. They should go to bed at a certain time. My <br/>
son likes crazy hairstyles & had his hair spiked up in a mohawk <br/>
yesterday. My husband thought he should fix his hair in a &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
style before going out. I told hubby his hair was fine & if that&#39;s <br/>
all we have to worry about we are lucky indeed.<br/>
<br/>
I would like for him to be on board with unschooling & mindful <br/>
parenting. Has anyone dealt with this issue here & how did you <br/>
handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
