<div id="ygrps-yiv-875803818">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group, though not new to the idea of unschooling, and I <br/>
saw something mentioned about a conference in October in St. Louis.  <br/>
I&#39;d really be interested in finding out more about that, especially <br/>
since I live in St. Louis!  The problem I&#39;m having getting started in <br/>
homeschool/unschooling my 13 and 10 year olds is their father, my <br/>
ex-husband.  Perhaps if I could get him to learn a little more about <br/>
it, he would be more open to the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>liveandlearnconference.org - technically it&#39;s over the river in <br/>
Illinois (Fairview Heights - still pretty close to you, we&#39;re driving <br/>
out from CT. Where in St Louis are you? I lived in Rock Hill way back <br/>
in the late 80s) Great time - no one would pressure him to do <br/>
anything, there&#39;s usually a Dad&#39;s gathering (SSUDS - secret society of <br/>
unschooling dads) organized by a convert to unschooling with <br/>
the &#39;street cred&#39; to impress any suspicious dad - former military, by <br/>
the book type guy who is now sold on unschooling and living by <br/>
principle rather than rules. But the best part of the conference is <br/>
seeing the living evidence - lots of KIDS of all ages just being and <br/>
doing their thing. BTW the fuzzy guy coordinating the Network Gaming <br/>
funshop is my DH (note there are NO *work*shops). <br/>

Hi, Cinder. I found this e-mail in my in box and am just now getting <br/>
around to answering a few posts.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re saying that the conference is in St Louis, &#39;though technically it <br/>
is in Fairview Heights, IL---just across the river on I-64. The website <br/>
is www.liveandlearnconference.org  We also have an e-list for updates <br/>
and conference chat at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com">liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There will be many dads there, as this is a family affair. Lots of <br/>
unschooled kids to meet and watch first hand. There will be <br/>
presentations by long-time unschooling parents, along with a few grown <br/>
unschoolers---ready to answer your questions! There&#39;s a group just for <br/>
dads: SUDDs (Secret Society of Unschooling Dads).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really fun weekend for all ages!<br/>
