<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431090138">One more question.  I know that my daughter wants to go to college - or at least she did until she started algebra and it was &quot;too hard&quot; for her and she realized she would have to do that in college, too.  She loves animals and would like to be a marine biologist  First off, any suggestions as to resources to get for her?  Other than books and movies, what would you recommend?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, did those that have already gone on to college take the SAT?  ACT?  GED?  If not, how did you apply for and get into college?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049892845">My oldest took her GED then took her TABE so she could go into the Fire Academy then took her CPT (College Placement Test) when she decided to pursue loftier goals then Firefighting.<br/>
<br/>
My 16yo just took her CPT and passed and will be starting college in a few days.  They call it Early College here in Florida, and the state pays for it if they are still considered a &quot;high school student&quot; by age.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo also passed his CPT but there is no rush.  He took it as a fluke and has no desires to be in college before he hits puberty.  He figures he&#39;ll start around 15yo even though he is reading college level textbooks now for fun ad personal enjoyment.  I know it sounds wacky, but he&#39;s a reader and loves deep subjects.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to take the GED as you can just create a &#39;homeschool&#39; diploma.  Many colleges just want to see the &#39;resume&#39; and interveiw the student while others just care if they pass the CPT or SAT.  So look into whichever college your child plans to attend to see what they require.<br/>

gets to the point that she needs it. And if she does decide to do it,  <br/>
there are lots of different ways to learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mine went to the local community college first, then transferred, so  <br/>
they didn&#39;t need any tests - their community college transcripts were  <br/>
enough. But every situation is different - depends on the college and  <br/>
your situation - applying as an international student to a state  <br/>
college in the US is different than applying as a state resident which  <br/>
is different than applying to a private college (and each of those is  <br/>
different from each other).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It helps to realize that colleges don&#39;t think what the get from  <br/>
schooled kids is the best way to evaluate applicants. It&#39;s just what  <br/>
they&#39;re stuck with. They&#39;re stuck with a system that makes kids jump  <br/>
through hoops to create transcripts. They need a way to sort out  <br/>
who&#39;s likely to fit in with who&#39;s likely to not make it.<br/>
<br/>
Many colleges are moving away from the SATs.<br/>
<br/>
What colleges *really* want to see are applicants who know what they  <br/>
want to do and have demonstrated that they are capable of learning  <br/>
more. Colleges love older students who&#39;ve been out in the world  <br/>
because they&#39;re more focused and know what they want rather than 17  <br/>
year olds who&#39;ve been hoop jumping for 12 years.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids have the opportunity to look *better* than schooled  <br/>
kids because they&#39;re different. They&#39;re more focused like people  <br/>
who&#39;ve been out in the work force. Don&#39;t try to make her look like a  <br/>
poor copy of a schooled kid! Help her show how she shines in unique  <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the lower tier colleges are likely to be confused by  <br/>
unschoolers ;-) They don&#39;t see applications outside of the norm and  <br/>
really don&#39;t know what to do with them. You can, of course, take the  <br/>
bull by the horns and help them see how she&#39;s better. That can be to  <br/>
your advantage since you&#39;ll be showing them the way :-) You can also  <br/>
be aware that the large colleges have seen unconventional  <br/>
applications and will know how to work with you just because they  <br/>
have the experience.<br/>
