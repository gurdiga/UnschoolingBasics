<div id="ygrps-yiv-361861698">Hi,<br/>
I am not sure how to handle my (just turned) three year old and her <br/>
constant pacifier usage.  The pediatrician and pediatric dentist <br/>
have told me to get rid of it.  The dentist said that her palate <br/>
will begin to harden soon and we will have major problems later if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t get rid of it before then.  I wish that I had not used a <br/>
pacifier, but I was had read that the AAP said it helped reduce SIDS <br/>
risk.  My one year old ds only takes his when he goes to sleep, so I <br/>
am going to try to get rid of his slowly (He is still nursing).  My <br/>
dd weaned at 17 months and she has always liked taking the <br/>
pacifier.  I feel like I am causing her stress by pressuring her to <br/>
give it up.  The pediatrician said to cut the nipple off and she <br/>
would lose interest in the plastic handle--I mentioned this to her <br/>
and big tears welled up in her eyes at the thought of cutting the <br/>
nipple off.  I wonder if she will give it up on her own?  Do I keep <br/>
pressuring her?  Do I hide it and pretend that it is lost?  Is this <br/>
a big deal?  I know sometimes the doctors&#39; make things sound worse <br/>
than they are.  Please let me know what you think.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Baby teeth *can* get misalign, not will get misaligned. And they  <br/>
don&#39;t know if the misalignment, if it happens, carries over to adult  <br/>
teeth.<br/>
<br/>
*And* what if it does carry over? What you&#39;re saying to her by trying  <br/>
to take it away is that her comfort isn&#39;t as important as straight  <br/>
teeth (which can be fixed with orthodontia.)<br/>

Oh, what a tough time! I can understand your tension and the issues at  hand. <br/>
Poor gal, made me cry too, thinking of that. I looked up Dr. Sears, while  <br/>
mainstream - is also a great and sensitive person (practice, actually) So here  <br/>
is the link on all things pacifiers. I hope it helps! <br/>

<br/>
Your child is more important than some &quot;experts&quot; opinion. Pacifiers<br/>
should never be started in my opinion, because children need the<br/>
breast, not a plastic thing, but at this point that&#39;s irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
She needs it. She wants it. That&#39;s all that matters in my mind. There<br/>
is no long term damage for many, many people I know of that sucked<br/>
thumbs, including my oldest child. He had his thumb until 11 years of<br/>
age, as far as I know and his teeth are pretty dang straight.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather pay for some dental/ortho work later than harm my childs<br/>
psyche. If it is a comfort to her, then she needs it.<br/>

She did stop using it&lt;mostly&gt;at about 4 1/2, but still, when she comes <br/>
across it, she&#39;ll pop it in.  : )<br/>
She has some sort of need to have something in her mouth...personally, <br/>
I prefer a pacifier or gum to chewing her fingernails off.<br/>
(BTW, her teeth are lovely...I think it has more to do with good genes <br/>
than a pacifier.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38484721">1.<br/>
 From Early childhood pacifier use in relation to breastfeeding,  <br/>
SIDS, infection and dental malocclusion.(sudden infant death syndrome) <br/>
(Clinical report). Joanna Briggs. Nursing Standard 20.38 (May 31,  <br/>
2006): p52(4). A survey of existing research on the subject:<br/>
Pacifier use and dental malocclusion<br/>
<br/>
The relationship of pacifier use and dental malocclusion has been a  <br/>
subject of great interest to dentists and child health professionals  <br/>
for many years. Forty-seven articles were identified that purported  <br/>
to investigate this relationship. Six studies met the inclusion  <br/>
criteria, of which five were cohort studies (Bowden 1966, Larsson  <br/>
1986, Bishara et al 1987, Paunio et al 1993, Warren and Bishara 2002)  <br/>
and one was a case-control study (Meyers and Hertzberg 1988). There  <br/>
were no RCTs and the excluded articles were mostly case-series and  <br/>
cross-sectional designs. Not one of the cohort or case-control  <br/>
studies reported a measure of association, such as an estimate of  <br/>
relative risk. It was therefore not possible to include these studies  <br/>
in the final review.<br/>
<br/>
Summary of findings: Because of the absence of adequate studies, no  <br/>
conclusions could be made.<br/>
<br/>
Implications for practice: Dental malocclusion: it was found that  <br/>
because of the paucity of adequate epidemiological studies, no  <br/>
conclusions could be made.<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Effects of nonnutritive sucking habits on occlusal  <br/>
characteristics in the mixed dentition in Pediatric dentistry  <br/>
(Pediatr Dent) 2005 Nov-Dec; 27(6): 445-50, says that &quot;Sustained  <br/>
pacifier habits, including those of 24 to 47 months, were associated  <br/>
with anterior open bite and Class II molar relationships, while digit  <br/>
habits were associated with anterior open bite when sustained for 60  <br/>
months or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Malocclusions are quite prevalent in  <br/>
the mixed dentition, and anterior open bite and posterior crossbite  <br/>
may be preventable by modifying nonnutritive sucking behaviors.,&quot;  <br/>
which seems to mean that yes, bite problems are more common in kids  <br/>
who use pacifiers long-term.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I can&#39;t seem to find anything that lays out what  <br/>
sorts of dire things happen to people with bite problems. Just how  <br/>
big a problem is it? I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do pacifiers reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome? A meta- <br/>
analysis.<br/>
Source:<br/>
Pediatrics (Pediatrics) 2005 Nov; 116(5): e716-23<br/>
Says: &quot;Published case-control studies demonstrate a significant  <br/>
reduced risk of SIDS with pacifier use, particularly when placed for  <br/>
sleep....  Therefore, we recommend that pacifiers be offered to  <br/>
infants as a potential method to reduce the risk of SIDS. The  <br/>
pacifier should be offered to the infant when being placed for all  <br/>
sleep episodes, including daytime naps and nighttime sleeps. This is  <br/>
a US Preventive Services Task Force level B strength of  <br/>
recommendation based on the consistency of findings and the  <br/>
likelihood that the beneficial effects will outweigh any potential  <br/>
negative effects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have found estimates ranging from 30% to 75% of how many children  <br/>
eventually get braces. It varies by economic class and other factors.<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who still sucks his thumb at age 6. He does it much less  <br/>
than he did when he was younger; he used to suck all night, and now  <br/>
only sucks to fall asleep, and rarely during the day. He has created  <br/>
a big gap between two teeth in front by thumb-sucking--a perfect  <br/>
thumb-sized opening. After some initial panic when he was 3 or so, I  <br/>
have gotten really comfortable with it. I think that when his adult  <br/>
teeth start to come in, if he is still thumb-sucking, I&#39;ll talk to  <br/>
him about the possible effects. I remember reading in my earlier  <br/>
research that most bite problems caused by thumb-sucking self-correct  <br/>
by age 10 if the child stops sucking, and the remainder were  <br/>
corrected during orthodontia the child probably would have needed  <br/>
anyway. Our dentist commented at Eric&#39;s last checkup that his front  <br/>
teeth have moved back from the pressure of his lip since he has cut  <br/>
back on thumbsucking.<br/>
<br/>
When Eric was a toddler, the dentist and especially the hygenist were  <br/>
almost rabid about the horrors of thumbsucking. But at Eric&#39;s last  <br/>
checkup, the dentist told me that Eric&#39;s teeth had moved since he had  <br/>
&quot;quit thumbsucking.&quot; I said, &quot;Actually, he is still thumbsucking,  <br/>
just much less often and for much less time.&quot; And the dentist said  <br/>
something mellow like, &quot;Oh, well, most kids quit on their own by the  <br/>
time they could do any real damage.&quot; Not what he said three years  <br/>
ago! Did we get him on a bad day back then? Did he want to scare me  <br/>
into making thumbsucking a big issue? Is he mellower because Eric&#39;s  <br/>
bite isn&#39;t as bad as he expected? Who can say.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought that the stress we&#39;d all suffer if we tried to make  <br/>
Eric stop sucking his thumb--and the inevitable failure of such  <br/>
efforts, and him feeling shamed, and driving the behavior  <br/>
underground--were not worth any possible benefit to his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
I always try to remember with doctors and dentists that they&#39;re  <br/>
usually giving advice based on one aspect of the whole person. Their  <br/>
concern is, rightly, with the teeth--but they&#39;re not always putting  <br/>
their recommendation re: teeth in a context of a person&#39;s overall  <br/>
well-being. There may very well be other factors that outweigh their  <br/>
specific advice.<br/>
<br/>
With Eric,and with my son Carl, who is still nursing at 3, I have  <br/>
very mellowly commented on occasion, &quot;Someday you won&#39;t suck your  <br/>
thumb anymore.&quot; or &quot;Someday you&#39;ll be all done nursing!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Ask your dentist to quantify the &quot;major problems&quot; and provide  <br/>
citations. I&#39;ve had doctors be very happy to help me find literature.  <br/>
And then I feel like i have good information for making a decision.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do I keep<br/>
&gt; pressuring her?<br/>
&gt;   Do I hide it and pretend that it is lost?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do either of these things. With Eric and his thumb- <br/>
sucking, I always think that any damage to his teeth is much less  <br/>
important than any damage I might to do our relationship or to his  <br/>
self-esteem. I could never think of any way to discourage his thumb- <br/>
sucking that wouldn&#39;t be stressful and conflict-laden, so I never  <br/>
tried to discourage it. I have only recently mentioned to him in  <br/>
passing that the dentist is concerned that it might cause problems  <br/>
with his teeth.<br/>

Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
When dd14 was a baby with a thumb or pacifier in her mouth all the <br/>
time, people bugged me about crooked teeth. I quoted childcare expert <br/>
Dr. Barry Brazelton who said something like, &quot;Braces are cheaper that <br/>
psychotherapy&quot;. That shut them up. Her teeth are perfectly straight. <br/>
Genetics? I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
I think the sensory need will surface somewhere else that might be <br/>
even more irritating to controlling adults. After dd was born, the <br/>
nurses saw her trying to find her thumb and said, &quot;Ahhhh, self-<br/>
comforting behavior.&quot; They thought it was a good thing. Lots of teens <br/>
and moms told me they had sucked their thumbs secretly til about age <br/>
16. I think what really bothered people was that she wasn&#39;t bothered <br/>
by other kids teasing or adults staring (we were still in public <br/>
school).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826660853">Tell you what: if he&#39;s still sucking on a pacifier at 16, let us know. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, he WON&#39;T be sucking on a pacifier much longer. Let him enjoy <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
The more you worry, the more anxiety he&#39;ll feel, the more comfort he&#39;ll <br/>
need, so the more he&#39;ll want that plug.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Know it&#39;s not a permanent fixture.<br/>
<br/>
Same as for family bed and nursing. They will NOT be sleeping with you <br/>
at 16 (not much, anyway---when Cam&#39;s sick, he&#39;ll still crawl in with me <br/>
sometimes). They don&#39;t still nurse at 13. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Relax. He&#39;ll be done when he&#39;s done.<br/>

needing to suck, and even when full up and done breastfeeding would need to suckle on. <br/>
Just leave it alone (which I think everyone said lol!) She really will outgrow it. And yes, <br/>
doctors really do try to emphasize their personal opinions to get you to &#39;join the dark <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032797324">My almost 17 yr old was a committed pacifier user when she was a wee<br/>
one....she would have one in her mouth and several in each hand at all<br/>
times!    She LOVED IT!!    We were  concerned about her teeth and<br/>
asked our dentist if it would cause problems with her teeth.   He said<br/>
that kids who have orthodontic problems typically have them because of<br/>
crowded teeth (which isn&#39;t caused by a paci)  or from tongue thrust<br/>
(not caused by a paci and actually the paci forces the tongue into a<br/>
healthier position ..probably why it helps with SIDS)  and from the<br/>
pressure that some kids put on their front teeth when they suck<br/>
fingers... some finger suckers do not exert pressure and some do.  <br/>
His opinion was basically that kids who end up with braces will end up<br/>
with braces whether they suck a paci, their fingers or nothing<br/>
additionally (aside from nursing from breast or bottle).  His opinion<br/>
was give her the damn paci if I am wrong we can fix her teeth but we<br/>
can&#39;t fix her psyche if we forbid her natural need to suck!!    For<br/>
the record she did give up her pacifier at around 4 1/2 yrs old on her<br/>
own.... she also had braces because her mouth was small and her teeth<br/>
were crowded.... her projected 24 month treatment plan took only 14<br/>
months and she has beautiful teeth!   <br/>
I have a friend who refused to let her child have a paci because she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to ruin her teeth or have to fight to take it away at a<br/>
certain time.... this child became a committed finger sucker, chewed<br/>
on everything, mouthed everything and so forth.   Every time this<br/>
child found a way to soothe herself her mother took it away.   This<br/>
same child is now 14 yrs old and doesn&#39;t trust her mother to meet her<br/>
emotional needs and never has.   She has never developed the skills to<br/>
calm herself down when she&#39;s upset either.   <br/>
<br/>
I also vote against the snipping the end off the paci... the<br/>
suggestion to do this is typically made by dentists and doctors who<br/>
want you to do that in secret and then try to convince the child it&#39;s<br/>
broken!  I find it funny that they didn&#39;t count on you discussing that<br/>
with your daughter! HA!    They wanted you to &quot;trick her&quot; but that<br/>
isn&#39;t really something that non coercive parents do!    <br/>
<br/>
So let her have the damn paci (in the words of my lovely now retired<br/>
dentist!)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251159373">Thank you everyone for the responses.  Please note, she was my first <br/>
child and I am definitely more informed the second time around.  The <br/>
nurses at the hospital actually gave her the paci to begin with.  I <br/>
told the nurses &quot;no&quot; paci when my son was born and gave it to him <br/>
when he was a few weeks old (because at the time I heard of the SIDS <br/>
risk being lessened).  It causes my dd great distress to think of <br/>
giving her beloved paci up and that is why I asked everyone here for <br/>
advice.  In my heart it did not feel right to pressure her.  Her <br/>
teeth, both top and bottom, do stick out somewhat in the perfect <br/>
shape of the pacifier.  The dentist said that when the palate <br/>
hardens (around this time) that the palate would be permanently <br/>
damaged and she would require oral surgery.  That is what got my <br/>
attention.  Definitely not misinformed people who have been so rude <br/>
to take the pacifier out of my daughters&#39; mouth (yes, this has <br/>
happened).  I always tell them to leave her alone and mind there own <br/>
business (yes, I would like to sock &#39;em, but I can&#39;t do that).  <br/>
<br/>
My dd LOVES ballet.  She dresses in her tutu and slippers every day <br/>
and dances in front of her instructional video.  We are going to let <br/>
her take lessons.  I have informed her that she would have to put <br/>
the paci away for this and she would have to go poohpooh on the <br/>
potty (a teacher requirement).  She has been wearing panties since <br/>
last October.  When she feels the urge to do #2, she will run and <br/>
put a pull-up on herself, and then ask to be changed.  She has not <br/>
shown an interest in doing the latter at this time, but she will <br/>
hand me her paci and smile when she begins to play dance.  I <br/>
encourage her &quot;big girl&quot; attitude.  I sometimes tell her that I <br/>
can&#39;t understand what she is saying because of the pacifier, and she <br/>
will remove it long enough to get her point across.  I tell her I <br/>
would like to see her pretty smile or teeth and she will show them <br/>
to me.  Then she pops the pacifier back in.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to stop bugging her about it.  She is smart enough to <br/>
know that she will have to give it up when she is ready (ballet <br/>
lessons).  I don&#39;t think she is ready yet.  I told her that it is <br/>
fine to hold off on lessons until next year.  She is okay with <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
I did learn something else I didn&#39;t know from the posts, that <br/>
according to Dr. Sears, the pacifier should not be used without the <br/>
loving presence of the parent (much like the bottle for bottle fed <br/>
babies).  I never thought of it that way.  If I ever do have another <br/>
baby I will keep this in mind... if I use it at all.  I nursed both <br/>
children as long as they desired (son is 1 and still going very <br/>
strong).  I am always torn on my decision making (like every mom).  <br/>
I want to do the perfect thing for my children and that is why I <br/>
joined this group.  You all help me make better, more informed, <br/>
decisions.  Thanks so much!<br/>

stop a toddler breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is four next month, she still has her pacifier. I never<br/>
ever used one for my older three, but when Dharani was newborn she<br/>
would go crazy with terror every time we went in the car. Even when we<br/>
stopped to nurse she would go wild as soon as she went back in her<br/>
seat. The pacifier was a last resort but it worked.<br/>
 Her two front top teeth have a gap, but then I never had a pacifier<br/>
and I had braces for teeth growing in all crazy angles. Our Midwife<br/>
says that maternal nutrition has more to do with good dental<br/>
positioning and enough room for the teeth.<br/>
<br/>
my fifth was born sucking her two middle fingers and does all the time<br/>

<br/>
Oh HUH!:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too funny that this topic rolled around when it did. My 10 y.o.<br/>
has been wanting to buy a pacifier to play with, so we picked one up<br/>
last night. Actually, we picked up two.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen and Sierra (6 and 10) have been walking around with those things<br/>
in their mouths constantly. They&#39;re playing &quot;babies&quot; and crawling<br/>
around...but also running around outside with the paci in their mouth.<br/>
I&#39;m sure the neighbors love it. ;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s satisfying a need to revisit their babyhood....even though<br/>
neither of them ever had a paci!  They were both breastfed long-term<br/>
(Jalen until 4.5) but maybe the paci is even more interesting because<br/>
of that.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter to me. The point is, they are enjoying<br/>
them...whether it&#39;s a game or fulfilling some need/desire.<br/>
<br/>
I trust my children will get what they need from this activity.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t even bring it up in relation to the lessons. She&#39;s very,<br/>
very little and lessons just aren&#39;t necessary to feed her love of<br/>
dance. Buy her dance videos for young children. It sounds like she has<br/>
the gear...keep nourishing that and fueling it without making any<br/>
reference to anything formal. Lessons are really not ideal for young<br/>
children in my opinion. Wait until she&#39;s older.<br/>
<br/>
Be happy that she has a method to comfort herself. I would never say<br/>
anything negative about the paci....just trust that she needs it and<br/>
leave it at that. Don&#39;t make lessons something worth getting rid of it<br/>
for.  Lessons are highly overrated most of the time.:)<br/>

I can see a pacifier, or other mouth-toy, being used *by the child* <br/>
in a similar way to exercise some autonomy on an emotional level. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between a parent deciding to use a bottle or <br/>

I totally agree!  I think Dr. Sears meant a new baby.  I am fine <br/>
with my toddler running around independently--my one year old won&#39;t <br/>
nurse if he is busy exploring.  My daughter did choose to drink <br/>
Danimals yogurt instead of nursing at 17 months.  I was 3 months <br/>
pregnant at the time so I did not press the nursing issue.  It was <br/>
pretty painful at that point.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737240093">I just wanted to let you know you are NOT ALONE....lol!<br/>
I was raised in a really ugly household, and my first ideas in parenting were to do the <br/>
opposite of everything my mom did. Seriously, when something would come up, I would <br/>
think, what would my mom do? and do the opposite. Not very mindful of me, that came <br/>
later. It was a process. It makes me think of a recent blog article I read (Crystals Daikini <br/>
Crossroads, which I love btw). She was writing about &#39;the process&#39; and had pictures of their <br/>
house, how her daughter has Stuff. And it looks like a mess, but it comes together in the <br/>
most beautiful way, everything with a purpose, everything where it needs to be. And <br/>
growing into an unschooling person looks messy, in our brains. We have to get all that <br/>
stuff out, let it have it&#39;s purpose, and CREATE the life we choose.<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone struggles, but that is mostly that is self-perception. what helps me the <br/>
most is to have a friend of like mindness around, who can say, &quot;I really like how you <br/>
handled that!&quot;<br/>
I do yell. Not at the kids, but when I&#39;m frustrated I can let out a holler. ARGH...this isn&#39;t <br/>
working how I planned! Then the kids come up and reassure me, point out suggestions, <br/>
and I love it. I love how they are learning that even adults need help, that I&#39;m open to <br/>
suggestions, and modeling how to ask for help. It&#39;s better than yelling at the kids, and <br/>
maybe I&#39;ll move to a point where I am not yelling, but I doubt it. I&#39;m an emotional <br/>
expressive person, and my joy, sorrow, eagerness are all so intense!<br/>
<br/>
Control is overstated. Our best days are days when the house becomes an absolute wreck, <br/>
mostly because we&#39;re focused on something else and it&#39;s &#39;okay&#39;. We had a yard sale this <br/>
weekend. SO all week the house has been a wreck and it&#39;s okay. We expected that, dirty <br/>
dishes in the sink, pizza boxes in the floor, toys and dirt and bugs and clothes <br/>
everywhere. For everything there is a season (hum with me! I honestly didn&#39;t mean that to <br/>
happen but now it&#39;s stuck in my head) There are days the kids really want the house clean, <br/>
and there are days when it&#39;s not even part of our thought process. It comes, more and <br/>
more. I&#39;m liking it coming more and more, because those days are like floating down a <br/>
river, someone asks &quot;Where you been? What&#39;d ya see?&quot; and you&#39;re like, &quot;I dunno, but dang, <br/>
it was beautiful!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Random thoughts from a lady who&#39;s fixing to make a butterfly cake for one birthday girl, <br/>
edible bowls with someone else (he&#39;s thinking chocolate chip cookie dough, but maybe <br/>
pizza dough), and trying to help yet another little person make a garland of cheezits and <br/>
cocoa puffs. Interesting life!<br/>

The dentist said that when the palate<br/>
hardens (around this time) that the palate would be permanently<br/>
damaged and she would require oral surgery.  That is what got my<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It probably should have gotten your attention *just* enough to ask what <br/>
he meant by that---or to look at it more closely yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that every child who uses a pacifier requires oral <br/>
surgery? Does he?<br/>
<br/>
Scare tactics.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She has not<br/>
shown an interest in doing the latter at this time, but she will<br/>
hand me her paci and smile when she begins to play dance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Just a side-trip to examine vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s NOT &quot;play dancing&quot;---she&#39;s REALLY dancing!<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t &quot;practicing piano&quot;---they&#39;re PLAYING the piano!<br/>
<br/>
Little changes like that can make a lot of head-way quickly in <br/>
understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  She is smart enough to know that she will have to give it up when she <br/>
is ready (ballet<br/>
lessons).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s that she&#39;s &quot;smart enough&quot;---it&#39;s more that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t really care! &lt;g&gt; And you&#39;re right---she&#39;s not ready. She&#39;ll be <br/>
done when she&#39;s done---and she won&#39;t *have* to give it up, she&#39;ll <br/>
CHOOSE to!<br/>
<br/>
Again---the vocabulary we choose to use makes a big difference in <br/>
making the paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did learn something else I didn&#39;t know from the posts, that<br/>
according to Dr. Sears, the pacifier should not be used without the<br/>
loving presence of the parent (much like the bottle for bottle fed<br/>
babies).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand this. So, if the child is apart from the <br/>
parent (at Grandma&#39;s for the afternoon, for instance), she shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to have the comfort of her pacifier? That seems like the time <br/>
she would want it *more*.<br/>
<br/>
Am I misunderstanding?<br/>

&gt; never yells, is always calm, listens to every little word they <br/>
&gt; utter, and has everything under control (house not a disaster, <br/>
&gt; supper cooked with a well balanced meal, bills and check book in <br/>
&gt; order, and my own stress under control) This is asking way to much <br/>
&gt; I know, but I can&#39;t seem to find the right balance to make me happy <br/>
&gt; with the situation. <br/>

***************<br/>
<br/>
Stop thinking about changing &quot;for good and not just for days or moments.&quot; That is just another thing to overwhelm you and you don&#39;t need that! <br/>
Just change the next interaction you have with the kids. <br/>
Stop reading email right now and do something &quot;preventative&quot;� something that helps build your relationship with them. Fix them a little tray of cheese and crackers and take it to them, wherever they are, unasked. Sit down on the floor and play with them. If nothing else, just go and give each of them a little hug and a kiss and say, &quot;I was just thinking about how much I love you.&quot; <br/>
Okay�so that is one good, positive interaction. <br/>
Again�just change the next interaction you have with the kids. Focus on making the next interaction another one that builds up your relationship. If the next one is because the kids are fighting, STILL keep in mind that you want this interaction to do something positive for your relationship with the kids and stretch your thinking as to how you can make that happen. In other words, you kind of think from their point of view about yourself. Consider what thoughts you want going through their head. Do you want them thinking: &quot;She never takes time to even find out what the problem is?&quot; Or &quot;She always blames me?&quot; Or &quot;She&#39;s such a hypocrite, doesn&#39;t want to hear us yelling, but then she yells at us.&quot; &quot;She hates me.&quot; And so on. What do you want them to be thinking�what words (articulated or not) do want tumbling around inside their head? Maybe &quot;She understands how I feel.&quot; Or &quot;She really cares about helping us solve our problems.&quot; Or &quot;She is trying hard to be fair.&quot; Or &quot;She&#39;s calm even w<br/>
hen I&#39;m not.&quot; Or &quot;Mom is the best listener in the world.&quot; &quot;Mom loves me even when I&#39;m causing problems.&quot; <br/>
And, eventually, you want them to think like this:<br/>
&quot;Mom will help us find a solution.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I can stay calm like mommy does even when I&#39;m mad.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I can listen carefully like mommy does when there is a conflict.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I can recognize feelings, like mommy.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I can come up with new ideas, like mommy does when we have trouble.&quot; <br/>
There is no substitute for being authentically &quot;there&quot; for them�for genuinely trying to help them resolve problems. For putting your relationship with them at the forefront of every interaction, whether it is playing together or working together. <br/>
None of us are perfect; we&#39;ll all have some regrets. But with my kids 19, 16, and 13, I can now say that I will never say anything like, &quot;I wish I&#39;d let them fight it out more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d punished them more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d yelled at them more.&quot; I will only ever say that I wish I&#39;d been more patient, more attentive, more calm and accepting of the normal stresses of having young children. <br/>
One interaction at a time. Just make the next interaction a relationship-building one. Don&#39;t worry about the one AFTER that, until IT becomes &quot;the next one.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897542072">My now almost four year old had a binky till she was almost three <br/>
years old. She only started wanting ove after we took the bottle away <br/>
from her at 20 months old. Her teeth were getting some small spots on <br/>
them so we took the bottle and offered the binky.<br/>
<br/>
She would go to her mommy and me tumbling class and everything and <br/>
wouldnt take it out of her mouth. She lost it at a cabin we stayed on <br/>
vacation and it was about 11pm and we were at least 30 mins from a <br/>
store. I told her I would get her one in the morning. She finally <br/>
gave up looking for it and went to sleep. I asked her in the morning <br/>
if she wanted to go get one, but she wanted to go swimming instead. <br/>
She just gave it up on her own. <br/>
<br/>
I really do think there was a point where I was thinking &quot;man, I&#39;m <br/>
gonna have to pack this in her bag for her honeymoon&quot; LOL... but I <br/>
knew she would give it up when she was ready. They all do...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now just try telling that to my 19 month old who only will take a <br/>
bottle and hates sippy cups!! LOL<br/>

The dentist said that when the palate<br/>
hardens (around this time) that the palate would be permanently<br/>
damaged and she would require oral surgery. That is what got my<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It probably should have gotten your attention *just* enough to ask what <br/>
he meant by that---or to look at it more closely yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that every child who uses a pacifier requires oral <br/>
surgery? Does he?<br/>
<br/>
Scare tactics.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
You&#39;re right.  I try not to get sucked in with these.  But, that one got me.  My pediatrician has said things like, &quot;if the baby cries, just turn the monitor off&quot;, or &quot;if the toddler acts up, just put her in a play pen&quot;.  I overlook these comments, because I am really only there to let him check out their physical well-being.  I totally disagree with him on child rearing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did learn something else I didn&#39;t know from the posts, that<br/>
according to Dr. Sears, the pacifier should not be used without the<br/>
loving presence of the parent (much like the bottle for bottle fed<br/>
babies).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand this. So, if the child is apart from the <br/>
parent (at Grandma&#39;s for the afternoon, for instance), she shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to have the comfort of her pacifier? That seems like the time <br/>
she would want it *more*.<br/>
<br/>
Am I misunderstanding?<br/>
  Sorry for the ambiguity on my part.  On the Dr. Sears web-site:<br/>
  &quot;Pacifiers are meant to satisfy intense sucking needs, not to delay or replace nurturing. A person should always be at the other end of a comforting tool. The breast (or the finger) has the built-in advantage of making sure you don&#39;t fall into the habit of just plugging up the source of the cries as a mechanical gesture. When baby cries, if you find yourself, by reflex, reaching for the pacifier instead of reaching for your baby, pull the plug  and lose it. &quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  There were times that I found myself doing this.  Especially if  busy (ie. shopping or driving/riding in the car).  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am the first person to leave a shopping trip or stop the car if a baby needs soothing.  But, in retrospect I did not have a firm grip on this notion until now.  I just mean that in the future I will try harder to &quot;be sure&quot; there is not some other way to satisfy my child before I give up and stick the pacifier in (if I ever use it again).   I may just try a snuggly or something next time.  There are certain breastfeeding advocates who totally shun the pacifier.  I don&#39;t know exactly what to think.  <br/>
  I totally agree about the soothing away from Mommy.   I stay at home and take them everywhere I go.  They have relationships with others (grandparents, cousins, friends) but, they have never been unwillingly left alone for even a minute.  Daddy and I only go where we are all able to go.  He came up with the motto:  &quot;if one goes, we all go&quot;.  We literally all go into Wal-Mart if that is what they choose to do (they have the option to stay in the vehicle with Daddy to watch movies or play in the back).  Most of the time they choose (cry) to go into the store.  They have stayed in the vehicle with Grandma and enjoyed it, and sometimes they don&#39;t want to, and that is fine too!  I have never left them at Grandma&#39;s house for obvious reasons (per my other post).  All of my family lives in another state (12 hours away).<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point with all of that is that I am very accommodating to my children&#39;s requests and I would never intentionally disallow them to self soothe.  I questioned whether or not I had failed in that respect (giving a pacifier to hush my child) and that is why I was glad to see that point brought to my attention.<br/>
  I hope I explained this better:)<br/>
  Thanks for listening.<br/>
