<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134002497">&quot;I am curious though, as to what to do in the case of a child with <br/>
executive<br/>
functioning disorder that wants pets. If left to her own, she <br/>
would &quot;forget&quot;<br/>
about the pets and they would die. Gentle reminders are not enough to <br/>
get her<br/>
to respond if she is busy with something else. Leaving it until later <br/>
means it<br/>
gets forgotten (even if she promises to remember--because she can&#39;t.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am curious why a child with a disorder, that is apparently unable <br/>
to cope with caring for an animal, would have any expectation of <br/>
caring for the animal?<br/>
My only question would be about whether *I* was capable of caring for <br/>
the animal and we would joyfully approach the care of the animal <br/>
together.<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t expect a child with a mental disability to develop at <br/>
the same rate an &quot;average&quot; (yeah, I can&#39;t stand that word...but for <br/>
lack of a better one...) child. I don&#39;t expect a four year old to <br/>
have the same capabilities as a 15 year old, I don&#39;t expect a 20 year <br/>
old to have the same understanding as a 50 year old etc..<br/>
<br/>
If someone in my home has a challenge, we work together to come up <br/>
with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
If a child in my home wanted a pet badly, but I knew they were unable <br/>
to care for said animal, my only question would be about whether I <br/>
was able to assist.<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to care for a small pet really....I guess the joy for <br/>
that individual would probably outweigh any potential effort on my <br/>
part.<br/>
It depends.<br/>
<br/>
A disorder should be MORE cause for leeway on the parent&#39;s part, not <br/>
less. <br/>
<br/>
I often try to weigh decisions against the background of death. It <br/>
works for me.......If _________ died next year, would this issue be <br/>
worth making a fuss over? IF _________died next month/next <br/>
week/tomorrow...<br/>
Wow..that really helps me see how petty some of my greivances are and <br/>
how easy it is to bring joy into our home.<br/>

Thanks for sharing that concept.  What a vivid point!  Well taken...<br/>

the organic food for her children.  She sews their clothes, and cuts their<br/>
hair. She&#39;s their on-call nurse. She milks, butchers, grooms, trims<br/>
hooves/nails, assists in labor (sometimes in uteruses up to her elbows!) of<br/>
the organically raised livestock that her children love, she builds fence,<br/>
paints and roofs the house, she chauffeurs, and the list goes on.... But<br/>
most of all she is their loving Mother who would literally give her life for<br/>
her children. She&#39;s not out to be their buddy (of which they will have many<br/>
of over the course of their lifetime), but to be their Mother.<br/>
And Mom is doing this with ruptured discs, spinal stenosis, nerve root<br/>
compressions, and torn ligaments and epilepsy.<br/>

to teach her children the domestic and life skill they need in order to<br/>
become productive adults, rather than condescending slugs. And they are also<br/>
learning how to delegate.  But alas, some women apparently don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
necessary, or else are afraid it might &quot;upset&quot; their child to request that<br/>
s/he contribute to the family in anyway other than being a pretty plaything.<br/>
So once again, it&#39;s left up to the government to create organizations to do<br/>
the &quot;parenting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And I wasn&#39;t aware that slaves are involved in several 4-H projects, are in<br/>
theatre, play soccer and baseball, go camping/hiking/boating, that take<br/>
tap/ballet/jazz/voice lessons, have sleepovers, go to movies with friends,<br/>
have video gaming parties, etc.  Wow! No wonder there was so much upset<br/>
about the Civil War!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a very difficult life - not even remotely the kind of <br/>
lifestyle that I&#39;d enjoy. I&#39;m assuming that this is YOUR choice to live <br/>
this way?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  She&#39;s not out to be their buddy (of which they will have many<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might want to read a wonderful book called &quot;The Parent-Teen <br/>
Breakthrough,&quot; by Myra Kirschenbaum. My goal, in fact, IS to be their <br/>
&quot;buddy&quot; - we&#39;ll live together as parent and child for such a few short <br/>
years - after that we&#39;ll ALL be adults. My sisters and I were so close <br/>
to our mom - the older we got, the more we were better and better <br/>
&quot;buddies.&quot; Grown kids and their parents can have the deepest most <br/>
wonderful friendships - adult to adult friendships - possible. And that <br/>
starts developing in childhood - it doesn&#39;t just spring into being on <br/>
their 18th birthday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And Mom is doing this with ruptured discs, spinal stenosis, nerve root<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And a serious case of &quot;martyrdom&quot; as well?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

ANYTHING on your list and I have no interest in any of them, either.<br/>
Are you assuming your kids&#39; choices will be the same as yours? Are you <br/>
trying to make sure of that?<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t rocket science to wash dishes and do laundry and dust and <br/>
vacuum. If your kids need their entire childhoods to learn how to pick <br/>
up after themselves or do a few household chores, what can I say?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  rather than condescending slugs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because that&#39;s the alternative?  I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t really mean <br/>
&quot;condescending&quot; since that insult didn&#39;t even make sense - <br/>
condescending means to lower yourself to somebody else&#39;s level or to <br/>
speak in a patronizingly superior tone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And they are also<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL -- you&#39;ve missed the boat. You probably won&#39;t read more and with an <br/>
open enough mind to catch on, but you&#39;ve missed some big huge critical <br/>
part of what people here are talking about AND you&#39;ve missed it that <br/>
people here have kids who are VOLUNTARILY helpful and who learn all <br/>
kinds of things without anybody making them do it. I know these people <br/>
and their kids and you don&#39;t - so I can understand skepticism, but <br/>
you&#39;re here on this list with people who are living a pretty extreme <br/>
alternative lifestyle -- instead of insisting on your ways, which are <br/>
totally conventional parenting methods, same advice we&#39;ve all read a <br/>
million times in parenting books and magazines, you might want to just <br/>
be quiet and read for understanding - maybe challenge yourself to try <br/>
to figure out how it is that people who do NOT do what you think is <br/>
essential do NOT end up with those &quot;condescending slugs&quot; but end up <br/>
with energetic, responsible, kind, competent and capable, and <br/>
eager-to-learn more grown kids.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m thinking of getting t-shirts that say &quot;SLUG&quot; for <br/>
my kids - my kids are so NOT sluggish that people would consider it a <br/>
great joke.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So once again, it&#39;s left up to the government to create organizations <br/>
&gt; to do<br/>
&gt; the &quot;parenting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who are you talking to? People here don&#39;t have kids who are being <br/>
parented by the government. Again, you might want to read more, talk <br/>
less, until you at least know something about the people you are <br/>
insulting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; tap/ballet/jazz/voice lessons, have sleepovers, go to movies with <br/>
&gt; friends,<br/>
&gt; have video gaming parties, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - there are LOTS of kids who are made to do activities like you <br/>
listed. I&#39;ve been a 4H leader and a Girl Scout leader and my husband <br/>
coaches soccer. We&#39;ve HAD the experience of parents forcing kids into <br/>
activities.  It happens a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re word-wrestling INSTEAD of reading for meaning. People are <br/>
talking about a fascinating and very different way of living in a <br/>
family. It is NOT at all what you seem to think. It isn&#39;t just an <br/>
excuse for not engaging with our kids. It is FAR from treating our kids <br/>
like cute little playthings. It is VERY far from having no principles <br/>
to live by, in fact. It is a DIFFERENT way of helping our kids learn <br/>
and grow and develop and become mature and capable and competent and <br/>
FREE in their hearts and minds to make their own life decisions.<br/>
