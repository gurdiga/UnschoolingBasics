<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967781299">addiction to alcohol does not mean alcohol is the problem and if the<br/>
individual has none all is now unfortunately not well. the alcohol is<br/>
a self medication to not dealing with something very painful. so<br/>
painful that wanting to disengage from interaction is a preferable<br/>
choice. there are always very complex defensive structures set up to<br/>
avoid painful experiences. many of these experiences are endlessly<br/>
repeated through our lives, but the external actors are just filling<br/>
in the role for our internal scripts which we play again and again<br/>
trying to get some understanding of the experience we are experiencing<br/>
now, we recreate it now, it is our choice but often we don&#39;t realize<br/>
our choice of perception and conception and fall back on ineffective<br/>
painful models and strategies. we have a choice to evade experiencing<br/>
frustrating painful reality or to try to modify the experience by<br/>
choosing to suffer the experience  and hence process experience which<br/>
we can only then learn from. alcohol or other &quot; addictive&quot; substances<br/>
/ activities are strategies to avoid examining our frustrations and<br/>
anxieties which are often an aspect of our lives and relationships. to<br/>
deny a child playing the game is to set up a painful relationship with<br/>
them one that frustrates them and creates a particular drama of<br/>
relationships that is internalized. it does not allow a way to<br/>
understand the experience nor the relationship; it denies the<br/>
possibility too learn from experience for both the child and oneself.<br/>
the conceptions of addiction you carry are internalized painful<br/>
anxieties. this dilemma is an oppurtunity for inquiry for self, it is<br/>
not some aspect of reality which one has insight and can share wisdom,<br/>
the frustration and danger / panic in the warning is indicative of<br/>
avoidance of being open to experience, of having the courage to be in<br/>
the nmoment of unknowing to allow what comes to be an experience to be<br/>
explored and played with and to be suffered if necessary in order to<br/>
learn from. this is my underlying unschooling principle, we can avoid<br/>
frustration or try to tolerate inquiry about it . patrick</div>
