I was interviewed for a radio show by unschoolers in Hamilton, in <br/>
Ontario, &quot;Radio Free School.&quot;  I was<br/>
asked to discuss strewing and spirituality, so those are the themes.  I <br/>
used a couple of examples I&#39;ve<br/>
used in other talks, but also said some things I&#39;d never said before, <br/>
so I&#39;m happy with it.  It&#39;s edited down<br/>
pretty tightly (half an hour from a 90 minute interview), so it sounds <br/>
like I talk even faster than I really<br/>
DO talk.  (Also I said &quot;civil war&quot; when I had intended to say something <br/>
else, but so it goes... overall I<br/>
think it&#39;s good.)  There are musical interludes. &lt;g&gt;  Either I forgot <br/>
to say or it was cut that the kids were<br/>
offered their jobs, and didn&#39;t apply for them.  (So it&#39;s partly that <br/>
they were noticeably cool kids that got<br/>
them the offer, I suppose, and I wish I&#39;d said that.)<br/>

Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.radio4all.net/proginfo.php?id=11724">http://www.radio4all.net/proginfo.php?id=11724</a> then scroll ALL <br/>
the way down to the bottom of the page.  There&#39;s a small &quot;table&quot; there. <br/>
  The column all the way to the right is labeled &quot;Download&quot;.  Click on <br/>
the link under it that just says:   http<br/>
							ftp  (both are lines are underscored like a link)<br/>
<br/>
This should automatically take you to a page that is blank other than a <br/>
small box with play/stop/etc and the interview should automatically <br/>
start playing.  Be sure to have your sound/speakers on.  The music and <br/>
intros are kind of loud, but you need to turn it up to hear Sandra <br/>
speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
