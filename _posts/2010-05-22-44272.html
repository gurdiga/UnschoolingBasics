<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997101771">Thank you Rebbecca, Connie, and Meredith for your responses.<br/>
<br/>
I found them all very helpful.  I have been pretty much thinking the same thing (it&#39;s the transitions,  things are coming out that have been bottled up, I&#39;m listening better - so she feels safer to reveal deep hurts, etc.) for the the last day or so.  I have been feeling bad about describing her cleansing as &quot;emotional vomit&quot;.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that she was being &quot;bad&quot; in anyway, which I think that is how it may have sounded.  It&#39;s just how it felt on my end.  I would never express this feeling to her.  When I am rested, etc. I can keep my &quot;emotional shield&quot; up.  Otherwise, I tend to absorb the negative energy, and it brings me down as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I also do understand the clingyness and realized that was a negative description as well.  In reality, my high need baby who nursed hourly, is in another high need stage.  The less I fight it and go with the flow the better!  Sometimes she acts so grown up and even fights for grown up things/privileges, I forget that she is still very young.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to stay rested and go with the flow!<br/>
