The last two years have been in Columbia, SC. This year it is hosted by  <br/>
Kathryn Baptista and is located in Peabody, MA. August 27-29.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a wonderful weekend full of unschoolers----over 400 of us! &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s <br/>
non-age-discriminatory---everyone can participate in any event  (presentation or <br/>
funshop). There&#39;ll be a talent show, a RAFFLE!!!!!!, and an  optional whale <br/>
watch.<br/>
 <br/>
Go to the site:   _www.liveandlearnconference.org_ <br/>
(http://www.liveandlearnconference.org)     for more info. You WON&#39;T be disappointed!<br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn will be taping the presentations this year. She&#39;ll let you know  when <br/>
they are available.<br/>
 <br/>
Tapes of the last two years are avaliable now:  <br/>
_www.schoolsoutsupport.org/resources_ (http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/resources) <br/>
 <br/>
They will also be available at this year&#39;s conference. I&#39;ll have a table.  <br/>
Stop by and see me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776360482">I would love to go but it is a bit far. I don&#39;t drive too far because of my<br/>
disability and my husband can&#39;t get off of work just now. He is new on a job<br/>
and doesn&#39;t have any off time.<br/>
  Hope you all will share what you have seen and learned or experienced with<br/>
the rest of us.<br/>
  If someone was going from the TN. area perhaps we could car pool?<br/>
 thanks for sharing<br/>
