<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830893172">I am wondering if there is anyone else out there that can relate to <br/>
my situation.  As I mentioned before, we are a combined family with <br/>
two adults and seven children.  The youngest, my biological son, is <br/>
the only homeschooled child in the home.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not even mentioned the word &quot;unschooling&quot; to anyone outside of <br/>
my two close friends and the few unschooling lists I belong to.  I <br/>
don&#39;t feel &quot;free&quot; to do so.  I&#39;d love to discuss it with Pat, my <br/>
fiance of seven years, but he&#39;s no where near being in the same book <br/>
as me let alone on the same page.  <br/>
<br/>
Adrian, my son, and I have been practicing unschooling since December <br/>
of last year.  I can see him growing as a young person, individual <br/>
and free thinker.  I love it!  It has had a tremendous impact on <br/>
myself as well.  With the four oldest girls, 16-18 years of age, I <br/>
can really tell a difference when I remember to think like an <br/>
unschooler in relating to them as well.  It&#39;s remarkable.  <br/>
<br/>
There is one catch.  The one person that I can&#39;t get to relate to me <br/>
or the kids is Pat.  Slowly, I have been sharing bits and pieces of <br/>
things I have been learning.  I&#39;ve mostly been sharing things that <br/>
directly effect our way of living in relation to home and job.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to read at all.  The only thing he does read is <br/>
instruction manuals and information of such related to vehicle <br/>
repair.  He&#39;s a transmission mechanic by trade.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out what my question is...I guess I just want to <br/>
know if anyone else has a husband that is clueless about unschooling <br/>
and that way of life yet you are living it with your children.  If <br/>
so, how do you do it?  Do you think it&#39;s possible to live in such a <br/>
way?  How do you share information with someone you love that very <br/>
much raises the children in a very &quot;old school&quot; kind of way so to <br/>
speak?  Pat is very controlling and dictatorship like with the kids.  <br/>
I am not that way and am leaning even further away from that end of <br/>
the spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how I wish I had known about homeschooling and unschooling 15 <br/>
years ago.  It would have been an amazing thing for us all.  Well, <br/>
you know what they say about that 20/20 vision thing...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div>When we left school for home, it was basicaly up to me to do with the boys whatever I thought was &quot;right&quot; , my dh said.&nbsp; He told me he trusted that whatever I did would be the right thing to do. He&#39;s never asked once what we do during the day, never asked for test scores, or how many books we&#39;ve read or is the youngest reading yet.&nbsp; I&#39;ve talked about unschooling but not to the point that he could possibly know what it really is.&nbsp; So he either does have us figured out or , he&#39;s just absolutly clueless!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781598507">Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re in the same boat.  So many things seem to be so <br/>
clandestine, unfortunately.  It&#39;s just that my husband is a known cynic <br/>
and I am passionate about unschooling being a vital component to the <br/>
homeschooling that I do with my daughter.  It&#39;s my personal philosophy, <br/>
but I have to recognize how much more philosophically traditional he is <br/>
than I.  He was born and raised in England and went to Catholic school <br/>
in a pressed uniform.  Even though that experience left him <br/>
unimpressed, it still seemed to imprint him with the need for school as <br/>
an institution.  Go figure.<br/>
Controlling and dictatorship?  Mine too.  I catch myself looking the <br/>
other way.  He has so many other fine, loving  qualities but  I don&#39;t <br/>
suppose he could ever unlearn these negative ones - they seem pretty <br/>
inherent in his nature.<br/>
<br/>
Cynic that he is, were he to try to denigrate the ideals  that are <br/>
closest to my heart,  I would lose so much respect for him that I am <br/>
not sure I could really recover.  Respecting each other&#39;s values and <br/>
principles is just so important, even in disagreement.   So, not being <br/>
inclined to flirt with that kind of disaster,  I suppose I shut him out <br/>
quite a bit.  We can bash each other&#39;s politics and religious (or lack <br/>
thereof) ideologies in safety and no harm done.  It&#39;s like for sport.  <br/>
This is different.  Would he know enough to know the difference?  That <br/>
how I choose to educate my daughter is sacred ground to me?  That this <br/>
is where I choose to invest my energy, my time, and my love?<br/>
<br/>
His work pays the bills, so it is therefore automatically important and <br/>
valid.  Mine doesn&#39;t pay off in dollars and cents.<br/>
Just the same, I am hoping that one day he&#39;ll just be able to admit to <br/>
me that now he sees the blessings that maybe were hidden in the <br/>
beginning, that my daughter was truly blessed to have had these <br/>
unschooling experiences, that it enriched her life in countless ways <br/>
that money just couldn&#39;t buy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not holding my breath...(LOL!)<br/>

**I&#39;m not holding my breath either!  I feel totally alone in my <br/>
parenting values, educational values and personal values.  I, too, do <br/>
a lot of looking the other way as well as tongue biting.  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing I&#39;ve not had to have it surgically repaired!  :):)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that you shared a little about your personal experience.  <br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not the only one out there that has it one-<br/>
sided.  Sometimes I really feel like a minority when it comes to <br/>
that, especially hearing all the stories about moms and dads <br/>
discussing family life and education and arriving at decisions <br/>
together.  That rarely, if ever, happens in our home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m encouraged...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659447531">Tina, I wrote you a real long answer yesterday but I lost it :-(  It <br/>
was a little like what Joanne had to say.  My dh also doesn&#39;t agree <br/>
with unschooling.  He agreed to homeschool, but I think that neither <br/>
of us understood how much unschooling would change our lives.  My dh <br/>
understands that a child will learn what they need to know, so he&#39;s <br/>
ok with that part.  There was a time when he would ask &quot;why I don&#39;t <br/>
take homeschooling seriously like other people do&quot;, meaning, &quot;why <br/>
don&#39;t I force book work&quot;.  I simply asked him to think of how many <br/>
men he knew that didn&#39;t graduate from high school and then asked if <br/>
they worked and supported their families.  He said &quot;of course&quot;, so <br/>
that showed him that the learning part will be fine.  His big thing <br/>
is that he is afraid the kids won&#39;t ever be able to hold a job and <br/>
support themselves and will live with us forever.  <br/>
<br/>
The part that he is having a real hard time with is that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe children deserve equal respect.  He believes that they are <br/>
lazy and will never hold a job because I don&#39;t force chores on them.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure this is going to work out for us because this is a huge <br/>
issue and his being disrespectful to the kids makes me not respect <br/>
him.  This is kind of what Joanne said too.  He thinks that I am <br/>
giving the kids too much power and that they will be spoiled.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how your fiance feels about this issue, but it is one that <br/>
you both have to agree on or I don&#39;t think it will work.  Granted, I <br/>
believe that one parent unschooling is better than no parent <br/>
unschooling, but I think two parents unschooling would be best.<br/>
<br/>
No, Kelly, my dh is not going to the conference.  I wish he could go <br/>
just for the men&#39;s talk and then leave.  He thinks it&#39;s crazy to pay <br/>
to listen to someone talk so that is why he won&#39;t go.  <br/>
<br/>
I gotta go.  I&#39;ll check back in later.<br/>
