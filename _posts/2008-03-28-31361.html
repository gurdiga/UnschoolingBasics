<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802121615">Greetings!<br/>
I found myself homeschooling in this past October when my 6 year old <br/>
son cried for four days straight about going to school, in school and <br/>
when I&#39;d pick him up from school.  Our public school experience ended <br/>
when I brought him to school one morning and he started to cry so I <br/>
went to bring him home and the principal restrained him and refused <br/>
to let me leave with him because he didn&#39;t have a fever.  She said he <br/>
was fine, he was not ill and he was manipulating me.  *Sigh* not a <br/>
day that either my son nor I want to re-live.  Turned out that he had <br/>
a double ear infection, sinus infection and tonsilitis.  That was the <br/>
last day he went to that school.<br/>
<br/>
I then tried the home curriculum method, sitting at the dining room <br/>
table with work sheets etc. but my son started refusing and it didn&#39;t <br/>
feel good to either one of us.  I have raised him in an attachment <br/>
parenting style so forcing him sit at the table was not something I <br/>
wanted to do.  Since then I have tried teaching him things as we go <br/>
about life.  In telling someone about this they mentioned unschooling <br/>
so I&#39;ve come here to learn more!  I just keep swaying on the fence <br/>
though.  I oscillate between thinking I&#39;m not teaching him enough and <br/>
I&#39;m a bad parent for allowing him to watch TV to thinking that it <br/>
will all work out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I think at this point if someone could direct me to some books or web <br/>
sites it might help me stop second guessing myself.  I&#39;m also <br/>
struggling with some health issues so ideas of fun/creative ways of <br/>
teaching basics would be very helpful.  It&#39;s just hard to be creative <br/>
when I don&#39;t feel well, but I don&#39;t want to be neglectful of what his <br/>
educational needs are.  Right now he would watch TV/play video games <br/>
all day if I didn&#39;t try to entice him to do other things.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ahead of time!<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sarah McCann</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16352574">First of all,<br/>
HUGS!<br/>
Second of all, please, spend some days watching TV and playing video games.<br/>
It&#39;s what people NEED to do when they are sick (either sick physically or<br/>
sick of school, heh). I say need because...it&#39;s what will allow all your<br/>
(and your child&#39;s) mental/physical energy that you both NEED to HEAL.<br/>
I know this is not what you asked for...but please do yourself a favor and<br/>
allow for some time. Time heals, and it&#39;ll take less time if you&#39;re not<br/>
resisting this need to deschool for both of you, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
THEN, when you&#39;re done with that, when you&#39;ve had enough of TV and games and<br/>
when your son&#39;s had enough, will be the time to look at the creative ideas<br/>
:) And we&#39;ll still be here to help! Promise!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805559812">Hello Sarah,<br/>
while reading your email I found myself reliving our experiences with kindy and school.My DD1&#39;s principle last year wouldnt let her come home on the first day when she was that upset that both my mother and i were at the school till well after 11 am!We too were told that she was manipulating us...which was rediculous she just wanted to be with us whom she trusted.Well turns out that she was being seriously bullied and sexually harrased by another & yr old girl.I wont go into details but this child made it her duty to make mines a living hell and the school did not do much and everytime we would say something and they would talk to the other child it just escalted to worse.No wonder she didnt want to go...It must have gone on for 18mths and we were being told that we were wrong to take her home when she was so upset....typical school i think.I wish i had known that homeschooling was an option then i might never have sent my daughter at all or at the least<br/>
 pulled her out after problems at the first school instead of changing schools for another one with similar problems.I am so glad that DD2 and DD3 will never know school while its in my power.<br/>
We are also very new to the unschooling option.This year we have tried to get homeschool curriculum to work...spending about 800 on resources!But DD1 just wouldnt have a bar of it and now we are looking at unschooling.Even my straight laced husband is seeing it might be the best option and it was his suggestion that we re look at John Holt books after dismissing him last year.<br/>
Now i just have ordered these books in but they might be useful for you to look at Teach your own by john holt,<br/>
The unschooling hand book by mary griffin<br/>
Natural homeschooling...parent teacher giude to natural learning by kerri bennet williamson  isbn 9780398059781<br/>
and this one i wanted but couldnt get it here but you might be able to get it there or over the net...trust the children:a manual and activity guide for homeschooling and alternative learning by anna kealoha isbn 0780890877487<br/>
there is a good website i am in the prosess of reading through at night when the girls are in bed.... www.sandradodd.com/unschooling <br/>
I wish we had been parents who did attachment parenting but i didnt know nuch about it till recently.We are working towards that now ourselves...a little late but we hope better late then never.Good luck and if anyone knows of any resources i havnt mentioned please put them up...we would like to read as much as we can,<br/>
