<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756584778">I found this article from one of the websites I trawl around in for neat<br/>
stuff.  It appears to support the unschooling methodology.  What do y&#39;all<br/>
think?<br/>

<br/>
caveat:  I know nothing about the Association for Psychological Science<br/>
(APS).  Their website appears nice and &quot;established,&quot; but don&#39;t know their<br/>
standing in the community, what their general stance w/in the psychological<br/>
community is on certain topics, etc.<br/>
