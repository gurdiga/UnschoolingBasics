<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949326251">Hey unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My family will be making a trip to Destin after labor day.  This is a first<br/>
for us, we will be there for a week with our 3 little ones (8, 6 and 3).<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to find some unschoolers there to meet with on the beach and<br/>
correspond with before we get there.<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE a chance to swap kids with another family so that dh and I can<br/>
have some alone time and maybe help out another unschooling couple who could<br/>
use some downtime.  That of course is just a bonus - we would be more than<br/>
happy to just have lunch with another family and let the kids play a bit.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We found a condo for less than $400 for 7 days (!!! Wow!!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If a family from another area would like to meet us in Destin that would<br/>
work too!  I am happy to share any info that we have.  We will be driving<br/>
from Dallas - so this should be a pretty inexpensive vacation!<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass my email along!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433476721">I live in Panama City.  Contact me off list and we can see if we want<br/>
to meet up.  Destin is about an hour or so from here.  I can get on<br/>
the base, which has an uncrowded and unspoiled beach.  We also have a<br/>
pool at our house.  My kids are John B-Day 15 Oct (he&#39;ll be 13) Liam<br/>
B-Day 9 Sept (he&#39;ll be 11) and Morgan B-Day 20 Aug (she&#39;ll be 5)<br/>
