<div id="ygrps-yiv-357119154">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I did a search here for Australia, found one thread from 4 months<br/>
ago... so thought I should post. I live in Townsville.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 12 and in his last year of primary school. We always had<br/>
difficulties with him, with attendance at school. Have been to mental<br/>
health specialists but lost faith in them (long story.) His behaviour<br/>
mainly manifested at home so I was seen as the neurotic mother looking<br/>
for a label to excuse bad parenting. I have 2 other kids, 13 and 6,<br/>
they are fine. <br/>
<br/>
April 2005 saw an incident at school that brought us in the eyes of<br/>
the authorities. Since then he did not one bit of schoolwork and was<br/>
continually suspended. This year he lasted 2 hours at school before<br/>
suspension and discussion with principal, decided to go the homeschool<br/>
route rather than inevitable expulsion, essentially leaving the door<br/>
open for eventual re-integtration (esp with high school next year!) On<br/>
the pension, this is very expensive for me in a state that supposedly<br/>
provides education for all.<br/>
<br/>
He is doing pretty great in light of no work for almost a year but it<br/>
is taking my whole day and where is the joy of learning? I hate it! We<br/>
are now behind 7 school days in work. He asks me &quot;Mum, how does this<br/>
learn me?&quot; (Great grammar there, ha!) and I am buggered if I can<br/>
answer that.<br/>
<br/>
I am very very close to the unschool method but of course, the<br/>
authorities as such know about us... breaking the law.... so what?<br/>
Myself and the school he attended believe he is Tourettes or high<br/>
functioning autistic (aspergers.) I tend to agree. The professionals<br/>
just say &quot;maladjusted to life cos his dad isn&#39;t in it&quot; after short<br/>
periods of time with him. He is VERY obsessed with computer. When he<br/>
was 10 he was evaluated at reading ability of 13 years plus. Now he<br/>
hates reading and that is a struggle. He virtually sails thru all the<br/>
maths.<br/>
<br/>
I have been looking hard at myself. I miss the me time to create my<br/>
glass beads. Am I considering this out of selfishness and laziness? My<br/>
options are so limited - further pain being suspended and expelled and<br/>
bullied and teased by kids at school... but what about the high school<br/>
years... his &quot;future&quot;.... Could family services intervene and take all<br/>
my kids? I&#39;m sure some do-gooder friend who&#39;s views are conservative<br/>
plus would believe they were doing the right thing to make a quiet<br/>
complaint. I don&#39;t want to lose my 6 year old in a custody battle (I<br/>
have share care with her) So many what if&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Miss 6 hates school. That is a hard one too. Her Dad wouldn&#39;t want me<br/>
unschooling. (I am a single mum.) I hate the thought of her sweet<br/>
energy sitting at a desk, teacher droning on.... hate the days she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go... but then having my kids here all the time I<br/>
think of the long Xmas break and how relieved I am when they go back -<br/>
that last week or two is like cabin fever (OK our tropical weather is<br/>
so darned awful you are basically stuck where there is aircon or prone<br/>
in a pool of sweat if like me, there is only an aircon in one <br/>
bedroom!) For my own sanity I don&#39;t think I could handle Miss 6 but my<br/>
values are opposed to my perceived personal limitations.<br/>
<br/>
I never heard of unschooling. How did I find this? I was searching<br/>
something about homeschool on google, to try and change my perspective<br/>
on why I hate it so much....<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone can make sense of the muddle that is me right<br/>
now. I would love to hear if any fellow Aussies, or Queenslanders,<br/>
might have something to offer in way of advice or perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900227549">I&#39;m not from Australia, and don&#39;t really unschool, but when I read <br/>
your post, a couple things struck me.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I was wondering -- could your son have some other sort of <br/>
learning disability, or vision issue?  If he was reading ahead of <br/>
age/grade level and now struggles -- that sounds like a red flag to <br/>
me.  Are you using high-interest materials, things that he would find <br/>
interesting?  If you read the materials aloud to him, would he find <br/>
them interesting.  (Hey, I have a 14 yr old, and I still read some <br/>
things to him!)  I have a friend elsewhere who has talked about how <br/>
vision therapy helped her son.  It wasn&#39;t the traditional glasses-<br/>
needing issues, nor dyslexia, but the vision therapy was a big help.  <br/>
Perhaps someone else will be able to fill in the gaps there for you, <br/>
since I can&#39;t remember the specific type of opthomologist you need.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to meet his needs, while still satisfying school officials who <br/>
have you in their radar, could you do some combination of <br/>
approaches?  Define what you think they will need to see, discuss it <br/>
with your son (you might be surprised at what suggestions he comes up <br/>
with!), and give it a try.  Don&#39;t forget, there are some wonderful <br/>
videos to help with learning about history, science, all sorts of <br/>
stuff.  Even literature -- find the movie, discuss it, maybe read the <br/>
book afterwards so he gains greater understanding of what the author <br/>
was doing, after already familiar with the story.  Or not, you need <br/>
to evaluate what will work best for you two.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is indeed Aspie, another good thing might be to work on <br/>
affective skills -- things that will help him learn to &quot;read&quot; people <br/>
and social situations.  Things that the average person picks up <br/>
automatically from observation, an aspergers kid needs to learn more <br/>
formally.  From things I have heard, they WANT to understand, want to <br/>
interact, but just don&#39;t get it, on how to do that appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
As for your 6 yr old -- if your ex wouldn&#39;t accept unschooling, would <br/>
he accept some other form of homeschooling?  The term may be off-<br/>
putting to some, or many, and if you either call it child-directed or <br/>
interest-based learning, or eclectic homeschooling (that&#39;s what I do -<br/>
- a mixed bag), perhaps you could figure out something palatable to <br/>
him, while saving her love of learning for her and you.  <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you on your hsing journey.  (BTW, I&#39;ve got a &quot;high <br/>
schooler&quot; and it isn&#39;t so bad!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075863555">Hi Donni and welcome to the group. <br/>
<br/>
It sure sounds like the school system has put your family through quite a lot. My nephew had a similar experience. His mom unschooled him through the last few years of high school and it was such a relief for everyone. He&#39;s 22 now and a beautiful, centered, intelligent guy with a love for life and learning. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well we&#39;re glad you found us! Unschooling really is so different from homeschooling with a structured curriculum. It&#39;s about living a joyful and interesting life and including your kids and their own interests and passions. The learning happens, just like you said you&#39;ve seen with your own son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715998700">***We always had difficulties with him, with attendance at school.***<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean the difficulties were in getting him to go to school, or were<br/>
there other problems? <br/>
<br/>
***Have been to mental<br/>
health specialists but lost faith in them (long story.) His behaviour<br/>
mainly manifested at home so I was seen as the neurotic mother looking<br/>

periods of time with him.***<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons/causes/realities behind emotional/behavioral issues<br/>
even if a child doesn&#39;t have the experience yet to articulate the<br/>
problem.  Kids express themselves very well if we&#39;re tuned in to that<br/>
physical and emotional energy.   But imagine a child who hates school,<br/>
for any or all of the really good reasons there are to hate school, and<br/>
the child has no choice.  Can&#39;t stay home and do what he loves, can&#39;t<br/>
hang out with mom, but has to go to a place he hates, with people he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like, and do things he doesn&#39;t care about.   Which of us under<br/>
similar circumstances wouldn&#39;t act out? <br/>
<br/>
***a label to excuse bad parenting.***<br/>
<br/>
Because kids are so dependant on us a lot of kid problems really do start<br/>
with parents.  Looking at *ourselves* is a good place to start.  It&#39;s<br/>
easy in the sense that we have full, complete and constant access to our<br/>
own brain and motivations.  We have a record of our past actions and if<br/>
we&#39;re willing to analyze you can correct our mistakes.  We don&#39;t get this<br/>
kind of access to any other brain so starting within ourselves is the<br/>
best thing we can do.  It&#39;s difficult if that internal examination<br/>
reveals things we&#39;d rather not know about ourselves but it&#39;s a good thing<br/>
to do for our kids and for our journey closer to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
***April 2005 saw an incident at school that brought us in the eyes of<br/>
the authorities. ***<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean authorities as in the police?  <br/>
<br/>
***He is doing pretty great in light of no work for almost a year but it<br/>
is taking my whole day and where is the joy of learning? I hate it! We<br/>
are now behind 7 school days in work. He asks me &quot;Mum, how does this<br/>

answer that.***<br/>
<br/>
***I am very very close to the unschool method but of course, the<br/>
authorities as such know about us... breaking the law.... so what?***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re doing is close to unschooling.   I&#39;m just<br/>
putting this out there for you to do with what you will.  But there are<br/>
hints in your writing  regarding what you&#39;ve been doing and how you&#39;re<br/>
thinking on certain issues that reveal a lack of understanding of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
If you think it&#39;s worth looking into there are lots of places to get<br/>
information.   <br/>
<br/>
There are some writings on unschooling at the following links.  If you<br/>
are working toward unschooling these writings may help. <br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/articles.htm">http://www.unschooling.info/articles.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
My recommendation to you is read here and at the links provided.   Find<br/>
an Australian unschooling list and join - they can give you ideas about<br/>
dealing with authorities. ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com/">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com/</a><br/>
)  (This was the only one listed at Sandra&#39;s site, but it&#39;s a place to<br/>
start.)   Stop doing &quot;school&quot; work with your son.  Instead, do things he<br/>
loves to do.  Don&#39;t think about school.  Think about all the ways you can<br/>
bring joy back into your son&#39;s life and then do that.  <br/>
<br/>
***He asks me &quot;Mum, how does this learn me?&quot; ***<br/>
<br/>
I like that! &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a good question.  How does it learn him to be<br/>
miserable and unhappy and stressed and worried and full of self doubt? <br/>
Very good question.  You have a smart kid. <br/>
<br/>
***He is VERY obsessed with computer. ***<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t use the word &quot;obsessed&quot; to describe his interest.  In the<br/>
first place it&#39;s not a very respectful way to talk about someone&#39;s<br/>
passion and second it implies the person with the interest is actually<br/>
ill.   It&#39;s an interest.   Support it and encourage it the way you hope<br/>
your friends will support and encourage your interest in beading.   <br/>
<br/>
***I have been looking hard at myself. I miss the me time to create my<br/>
glass beads. ***<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that&#39;s similar to the way your son has felt, trapped in the<br/>
school system, no freedom to do what he loves or be the person he wants<br/>
to be...<br/>
<br/>
***Am I considering this out of selfishness and laziness?***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not selfish or lazy to want a peaceful life of joy.   It seems to me<br/>
it would be selfish and lazy to leave your unhappy son in the hands of<br/>
the others who&#39;ve orchestrated his misery.  You&#39;re considering the<br/>
happiness and emotional health of your family, which is what moms are<br/>
supposed to do.  <br/>
<br/>
***My options are so limited ***<br/>
<br/>
You have a lot of options.  You get to decide which options you are<br/>
willing to live with.   <br/>
<br/>
***but then having my kids here all the time I<br/>
think of the long Xmas break and how relieved I am when they go back -<br/>
that last week or two is like cabin fever ***<br/>
<br/>
You should change this even if you ultimately decide to leave your kids<br/>
in school.  Your kids deserve a mother *delighted* to be with them.  <br/>
If circumstances keep you in the house make the house a joyful place to<br/>
be.   What do your kids love?  We&#39;ll help you with ideas about how to<br/>
accommodate them. <br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s hot is there a local pool you can go to, a lake, a river?   Can<br/>
you get their dad to help you get a pool for home?  We&#39;re lately having<br/>
summers with temperatures above a hundred degrees and the three foot<br/>
deep, eight foot pool we set up in the back yard (one of those inflatable<br/>
jobs with big squishy side walls) has been glorious fun for all of us.  <br/>
Water gun fights, water balloon fights, sprinklers, all cooling fun<br/>
outdoor activities for hot weather.   Maybe you have water conservation<br/>
restrictions so the sprinklers would be out but a trip to a campground on<br/>
a lake would be so worth the effort.   <br/>
<br/>
Is it cooler at night?   Stay up at night playing outside and sleep<br/>
during the hot day, watch movies, eat ice cream.   <br/>
<br/>
***For my own sanity I don&#39;t think I could handle Miss 6 but my<br/>
values are opposed to my perceived personal limitations.***<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can take encouragement from knowing that understanding the<br/>
unschooling philosophy can help you be a person who feels really free to<br/>
enjoy kids.  And will help your kids feel free to be people you will<br/>
enjoy being around.   If an adversarial relationship exists between you<br/>
and your kids, unschooling can help you repair it, quickly.   It will<br/>
take work on your part, a change in attitude and a real desire to live a<br/>
different kind of life with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
Lots of women have gotten the message that they can&#39;t be really fulfilled<br/>
when they&#39;re with their kids.  Not true.  Lots of moms get the message<br/>
that we&#39;re supposed to be driven nuts by our kids.  Not true.   How does<br/>
this learn you? &lt;g&gt;  Have you raised kids who are no fun to be around and<br/>
why did you do that?  It&#39;s not a question you need to answer here but if<br/>
you think about it I believe you&#39;ll see your kids differently, and maybe<br/>
see ways you can be different (better) with your kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452020065">***could your son have some other sort of <br/>
learning disability, or vision issue?  ***<br/>
<br/>
I think in every possible way this child should be encouraged to feel<br/>
whole and perfect.   Healing is an important step toward a better life<br/>
for this boy and labeling him with more problems won&#39;t heal any of his<br/>
wounds.   <br/>
<br/>
***If he was reading ahead of <br/>
age/grade level and now struggles -- that sounds like a red flag to <br/>
me. ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ahead of grade level&quot; doesn&#39;t mean a thing.   The mom wrote her son<br/>
&quot;hates to read and that is a struggle&quot; meaning a struggle for the mom to<br/>
get him to read.   So, let&#39;s ask why he hates to read.  Probably because<br/>
he&#39;s been made to read when he didn&#39;t want to.  Forcing more reading will<br/>
not make him want to read.  It will create tension and bad feelings<br/>
between mom and son and further dislike and avoidance of reading. He<br/>
needs to be completely free from the pressure to read.  There&#39;s a world<br/>
of things he could be enjoying and doing without reading.  Reading is one<br/>
tiny sprinkle on the banana split of life. &lt;g&gt;   Schools turn that tiny<br/>
sprinkle into a giant booger for most kids and then the banana split of<br/>
life is disappointing and disgusting.  The red flag here is *wounded<br/>
child* and everyone should immediately stop hurting him.  (and stop<br/>
flinging boogers at him.)  <br/>
<br/>
***Are you using high-interest materials, things that he would find <br/>
interesting?***   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re hoping to help this mom move away from the thing (school) that has<br/>
been such a joy killer for her son.    Let&#39;s encourage this mom to stop<br/>
all activities that resemble school so her son can recover.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to &quot;use high-interest materials&quot; to help her have an interesting<br/>
life.  Better advice would be &quot;joyfully help your son do what he loves.&quot; <br/>

I fiercely suck at analogies but I keep slinging them out there.  You<br/>

FYI -- not curricular material intented to be of high interest to <br/>

What my son finds highly interesting, might be incredibly boring to <br/>
the next person.)<br/>

I realize that but what you wrote was:  &quot;Are you using high-interest<br/>
materials..&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Why would an unschooling parent &quot;use&quot; high interest material?  That<br/>
implies the parent has a goal to get the child to do something or to<br/>
learn something.   But the goal isn&#39;t to get kids to do something that<br/>
looks educational the goal is to help kids do the things they want to do.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling parents do help their kids lead interesting lives and that<br/>
might include getting things for them or taking them to places of<br/>
interest.   That&#39;s not the same as a parent &quot;using high-interest<br/>
materials.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311203655">Yes, but even if my son is interested in learning something he will tell me,<br/>
&quot;Mom there is a fun way to learn something and a boring way to learn<br/>
something and this is the boring way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When those words come out of his mouth we have either exhausted his interest<br/>
or we need new materials. <br/>
