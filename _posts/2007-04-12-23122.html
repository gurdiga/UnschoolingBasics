   Kelly,<br/>
We are in the process of getting the word out about a new web magazine <br/>
being launched for adult unschoolers, and wanted to let you know about <br/>
it. Feel free to share the announcement below with your Live and Learn <br/>
Conference list, or with any other groups or lists you feel might be <br/>
interested in this magazine!<br/>
<br/>
  Also, say hi to Cameron for me (I was on staff at NBTSC in Vermont <br/>
last summer)!<br/>

 New Web Magazine for Unschoolers of All Ages<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce the launch of a new bimonthly web magazine <br/>
for self-directed learners of all ages—grown unschoolers, teenage <br/>
unschoolers, parents unschooling themselves while they homeschool their <br/>
kids, and adults who follow their inner compass and never stop learning.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine is a community and lifestyle magazine for people who <br/>
are curious about the world around them and learning all the time. It <br/>
is the hub of an interconnected web of self-directed learners eager to <br/>
share experiences, resources, advice, inspiration, encouragement, and <br/>
new ideas to learning problems.<br/>
<br/>
Great resources currently exist for homeschoolers/unschoolers and their <br/>
parents, but there is nothing for homeschoolers/unschoolers beyond high <br/>
school age. Sponge Magazine fills the void for unschooling adults, <br/>
anyone who understands that self-directed learning is more than an <br/>
educational practice–it&#39;s a lifestyle based on curiosity, <br/>
self-empowerment and inner truth.<br/>
<br/>
  Sponge Magazine will include features and columns covering a wide <br/>
range of topics, including:<br/>
<br/>
    *  Making the transition from childhood to adulthood as a <br/>
self-directed learner<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *  Dealing with the struggle between self-direction and mainstream <br/>
values/lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *  Life as a self-directed learner<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *  Travel opportunities well-suited for self-directed learners<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *  Mainstream news interpreted from the self-directed learner <br/>
perspective<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *  Profiles of famous self-directed learners<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *  Readers sharing a new idea, lifestyle, experience, discovery or <br/>
area of interest that gets them totally psyched<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *  And much more<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Here are some sample article titles:<br/>
<br/>
 “Full-Time Work: Is It Necessary?”<br/>
“Discovering a Kinesthetic Learning Style”<br/>
“Starting a Dotcom”<br/>
“I&#39;m a Cook at Moosewoods”<br/>
“Berkana Learning Journey to Mexico”<br/>
<br/>
  Sponge Magazine was co-founded by Peter Kowalke. A lifelong <br/>
unschooler, Peter is a columnist for Life Learning Magazine and Home <br/>
Educator&#39;s Family Times, and a former columnist for Home Education <br/>
Magazine. Peter was communications director at the Clonlara School. He <br/>
is the producer of Grown Without Schooling, a documentary about grown <br/>
homeschoolers, and he&#39;s a regular speaker at homeschooling conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Magazine officially debuts in October, but we’re soft-launching <br/>
the publication in May with the first of three, smaller &quot;newsletter&quot; <br/>
issues. There are many ways to get involved:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  *  Be part of the discussion in our forums. Help make it the way you <br/>
want by contributing ideas and suggestions for what should be in the <br/>
magazine, share advice for how we should run the project, discuss <br/>
issues, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *  Volunteer. We need writers, editors, web designers, promoters, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
