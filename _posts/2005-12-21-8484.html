<div id="ygrps-yiv-14438468">&quot; So when I bring up &quot;the next<br/>
step&quot;, that&#39;s<br/>
fairly contrived. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of perception.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But see, you&#39;re seeing math as &quot;steps&quot;....when it has no <br/>
natural &quot;steps&quot; at all.  If you bring some interesting puzzle or <br/>
game or brain teaser to his attention, because you think he&#39;ll like <br/>
it, THAT might be broadening his horizons.<br/>
But pointing out some linear step, is really being stuck in school-<br/>
think to me.  Math is chess and sudoku and cooking and building and <br/>
guessing and designing and art and.......<br/>
Where are the steps for that?  In school, we are taught in a linear <br/>
fashion. You have to learn addition before subtraction, then on to <br/>
muliplication, blah, blah, blah. Nothing could be more contrived and <br/>
less natural than that.  <br/>
<br/>
For one, they never tell you that addition and subtraction are the <br/>
same thing (inverse operations is all) and multiplication and <br/>
division are again, mirrors of one another. I never knew you could <br/>
simply add to subtract until I was an adult. argh. Linear &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
stunts the mind...I want my kids to have no part of that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all part of our journey as schooled minds. WE have to see the <br/>
learning in everything and value it all before unschooling really <br/>
unfolds well for US.:) Kids get it quite well, if we just stay out <br/>
of their way.<br/>
<br/>
I DO expose my children to new and different things than if I just <br/>
waited around for some interest to arise. They don&#39;t even know <br/>
what&#39;s available out there if we don&#39;t share enough of the world <br/>
with them. But sharing interesting people, places and events is part <br/>
of building a LIFE, I don&#39;t do it to try and get them to some <br/>
illusory &quot;next step&quot; or to cover some &quot;gap&quot; in their learning. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the difference between contrived and natural to me....I agree <br/>
with Deb on that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course, they do sort of mention that addition and multiplication <br/>
go together - but then again, my DS figured that out simply by <br/>
hearing, doing, seeing it in action without any planning, <br/>
contriving, lessoning. It&#39;s patterns and generally speaking kids see <br/>
all sorts of interconnected patterns that we&#39;ve been trained out of <br/>
in our linear schooling. DS has learned/is learning addition, <br/>
subtraction, multiplication, and division all together because they <br/>
are all parts of a pattern of numbers. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and that &#39;sentence at the table&#39; is to express something *I* <br/>
find interesting or intriguing or plain silly, whether or not DH or <br/>
DS follows it up. Last night I mentioned two things (well more than <br/>
two but I remember these two LOL): one was that sales of sauerkraut <br/>
are up because some study or other said that it can fend off bird <br/>
flu; the other was that Bill Gates&#39; house has a trampoline room. <br/>
Random interesting to me tidbits. The sauerkraut got a chuckle from <br/>
DH and nothing from DS. The trampoline room had DS wanting to go <br/>
visit Bill Gates (and a brief discussion of where Bill Gates got all <br/>
the money to build it) and discussion of rooms we could have if we <br/>
had lots of money to build anything we wanted. Simply bringing bits <br/>
of the outside world into our home - the same as we have music and <br/>
movies and books and wire and batteries and legos and videogames and <br/>
recipes and shopping trips and computers and magazines and...it&#39;s <br/>
all part and parcel of life and we all &#39;snack on&#39; whatever is of <br/>
interest at the time.<br/>
