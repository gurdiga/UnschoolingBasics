<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178589779">&quot;What we did not use were pull ups (another invention of the disposable<br/>
diaper industry), rewards, punishments, or any other numerous strategies<br/>
from &quot;Potty train your child overnight!&quot; experts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Same here. I did push with the older two...but less with each child.<br/>
Jalen, my MOST radically-unschooled-since-birth and AP&#39;d child, just<br/>
decided to use the toilet one day, a bit after three.<br/>
<br/>
When he turned three, he was just starting to have a language<br/>
explosion, which kept up for about four months and during that time he<br/>
just decided to use the toilet one day, literally.  We never prodded,<br/>
or pushed or did ANYTHING. He was in the bathroom with me when I went<br/>
from the time he was born pretty much, he went everywhere I went, so<br/>
by the time he was mobile, he would follow me in there some of the time.<br/>
He knew what it was for.<br/>
<br/>
The day he decided to use a toilet, he also decided the next day to<br/>
use underwear and from that day on he stayed dry at night!! That was a<br/>
big surprise for me because none of my other children had night time<br/>
control for quite a while after they learned to use a toilet.<br/>
<br/>
It was literally an overnight event in Jalen&#39;s case. My older children<br/>
 varied a bit, Sierra being fascinated with it all at two and wanting<br/>
to sit on a toilet, but not actually using it until closer to three.<br/>
<br/>
I think three is really young. Forget what the &quot;experts&quot; say and trust<br/>
your child to learn when he is good and ready. No stress.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53288342">Thank you everyone for your advice and insight.  I appreciate the time <br/>
each of you took.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, indeed, I am very new to this journey.  I have called it that <br/>
since day one and I&#39;m learning something new every day.  I&#39;ll relax, <br/>
see what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let you know what progress we make!<br/>
