<div id="ygrps-yiv-682834814">Just want to shout at how I am enjoying watching my children. I am a <br/>
new unschooler and have posted once. The first thing I have done is <br/>
rearranged our book shelves and made nothing off limits to my kids. <br/>
Here are the things they have done in the last two days on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Mosaic pictures from a kit<br/>
Coloring books of Native americans<br/>
Paper dolls of Camelot<br/>
Made an art/history museum in their room<br/>
Put america at war cards in chronological order<br/>
Colored in a Medieval coloring book<br/>
excitement of president stickers<br/>
<br/>
and many other things, it would be to long to list.<br/>
<br/>
All these items were things I was saving for some kind of study I <br/>
was going to do. So unfortunatly they were off limits to the girls. <br/>
Shame on me.<br/>
<br/>
They are right now as we speak chasing after eachother teasing about <br/>
who&#39;s president sticker is the best. We are all having the time of <br/>
our lives.<br/>
