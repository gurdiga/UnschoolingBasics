<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316670334">**ok so these are not specific ones to this group LOL.. sorry if I seem <br/>

Recently there seem to be a lot of people using &quot;RUN&quot; for (I assume) Radical <br/>
Unschooling. On one of these lists I&#39;ve seen it used something like &quot;run <br/>
families&quot;. Not capitalized or anything, it took me quite a bit to figure out just <br/>
what the writer was trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
Also common on homeschooling lists are the use of ps to mean public school <br/>
and hs to mean homeschool. Except that often people use ps to mean schools in <br/>
general, and some people use ps for private school. I&#39;ve also seen at least one <br/>
person use the construction &quot;hs hs&quot; to mean homeschool high school. <br/>
<br/>
:) Pardon me while I grouse a bit.... <br/>
<br/>
I really wish people wouldn&#39;t use acronyms in email groups. I think in <br/>
general they make conversations harder to understand and they interfere with reading <br/>
flow. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re practically a necessity for text messaging. They made sense back when <br/>
people were connecting with achingly slow modems. They made sense for chat <br/>
formats that allowed only two lines per transmission. They aren&#39;t needed for <br/>
modern email formats - even folks still on dial up connections (me!) won&#39;t see a <br/>
difference in their transmission times by using acronyms. But they do <br/>
contribute to confusion and slow understanding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105359402">LOL I think I love you because of the line after your name.. LOL I too have<br/>
dial up so I know what you are saying.  I try really hard to figure out some<br/>
of them.. I do frequent a couple parenting boards (due date support groups<br/>
that we are still connected after all these years) and I understand all the<br/>
ones they use.  I looked up acronyms like suggested and didnt find the ones<br/>
I have seen on the unschooling sites.  I could just ignore them I guess.. I<br/>
think they are similar to the LOL I use a lot just I havent learned them<br/>
yet.<br/>

lol...sorry, &quot;laughing out loud&quot; at that. Really, no joking...My son  <br/>
yesterday texted back to me, after I questioned him about something, with the  letter <br/>
&quot;Y.&quot; I assumed it was a Y short for &quot;yes&quot; but it was &quot;y&quot; as in Why?&quot; :) <br/>
 <br/>
I became crotchety at that moment ;) <br/>

And then there is the younger generation that can&#39;t live without them<br/>
and think they are standard English.  My teen and her boyfried were<br/>
texting each other (from different parts of the house) when he<br/>
encountered an &quot;acronym&quot; he was unsure of.  <br/>
So he asks me, &quot;What does A R G H stand for?&quot;<br/>
so I have to explain that it is NOT an acronym but just simply a sound<br/>
of frustration, a word unto its own.  (Laugh)<br/>
