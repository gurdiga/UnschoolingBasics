<div id="ygrps-yiv-489579449">Now I posted this question on  unschoolingbasics and alwaysunschooled here&#39;s what I wrote to both really --some of the suggestions may have come from your group and some from the other but either way they have helped me re-open my eyes and boy do I feel better -- so simple solutions really.<br/>
<br/>
wanted to take note that who ever mentioned not to label or peg - I said he was a choleric -- your right -- i do hate labels on children even though I was looking at the choleric in a good way and I was thinking on ways to understand that -- i think the overall picture was just me being complacent and not being present as I mentioned further down.. again I feel like I can&#39;t thank you enough<br/>
hank you thank you thank you.... <br/>
 <br/>
from post to always :<br/>
Many lightbulbs came on once again!! I find so much of the advice so simple and sometimes I feel like, duh -- of course that&#39;s the answer. But I guess when you get so caught up in your own way..(sound just like my son huh!!!!)   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some of the lightbulb moments:<br/>
<br/>
  1.  when I gave the example of the older child and friend wanting the wii game -- someone asked if it was in the area I was --- YEs, Where I sit at the computer is in eye sight of the tv, of course he wanted to stay there it was the center of everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
  2.  right with that same thought --- someone else mentioned making everything where we can be together! geez, I never thought of that -- the kids like being where the &#39;newer&#39; tv is in the living room because its in the center  .. my house isn&#39;t very big -- when you stand in the center the living room , kitchen and computer /kitchen table area is all in one spot... I truly never realized this phenomena that the kids want to be where your at --no wonder when there rooms were in the back bedroom they were still always in the living room... I feel silly now not seeing the obvious...  <br/>
<br/>
  Just some fun information about us and thanks to unschooling, I have a roommate with a sixteen year old daughter -- now they occupy the back to bedrooms and I divided my living room in half to make the boys bedroom there... and lo and behold when i did that they played and were in there room quite a bit we only had one tv for a time so it was in there room and even when not watching with them they were comfortable there --ds (the 4 year old)  would even shut door on his own and tell us to stay out -- but it must of been because the feeling that I was still just right there... now my room was at the other end of the house rather large and bathroom hooked on --- just recently I switched the boys rooms... and at first they were loving it however, I made sure I went in there too watch tv /wii with them etc.  <br/>
<br/>
  we just recently bought an used tv to put in the living room and it seems like were all back out here much of the time -- especially if i&#39;m out on computer... :)  I get it now!!<br/>
<br/>
but what I&#39;m rambling about is that in the past I never thought to switch rooms around one friend even told me I shouldn&#39;t because I was the alpha female and I should have that bigger room and bathroom -  that some day i will have a partner again...blah, blah, blah <br/>
<br/>
but to me my room was wasted space I rarely was in there unless we moved the tv in there (we&#39;ve did that)  and they really had no space in there shared room -- their toys were rarely being played with because it was stuffed under beds or in closet .. in the bigger room they are now out and accessable... I don&#39;t think I would have ever thought more openly or &#39;consensual&#39; if I had not been exposed to unschooling..<br/>
<br/>
3.  The suggestion about Danielle Conger&#39;s --visualization was great -- I think I can do that!!  one of the things I&#39;ve been trying to figure out is just what to do to feel more peaceful instead of caught right up in the &#39;storm&#39; --- plus the information on how to put his feeling in better prespective -- didn&#39;t think of those -- light bulb<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I basically was reassured through discussion here that I need to get back to being more present with the boys -- period..  Do others do that --- flow nicely, than slowly go back to rougher times because of not being present ?? I think it gets recognized quicker now and I definitely won&#39;t be afraid to post again! thank you much</div>
