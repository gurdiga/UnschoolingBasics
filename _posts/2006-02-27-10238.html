<div id="ygrps-yiv-11587957">Hi, I have been reading many of the posts regarding food intake,<br/>
sugar, etc.  What about a 2 year old who really doesn&#39;t know the<br/>
difference between what&#39;s going to give him a stomach/head ache etc? <br/>
My son would eat junk all day.  I don&#39;t know who posted a while back<br/>
and they said that it was their responsibilty as a parent to ensure<br/>
the health of their child.  I feel the same.  I can&#39;t imagine what my<br/>
son would be like if I didn&#39;t enforce healthy food and snacks. I<br/>
notice when he does have sugary snacks, cookies, etc. he gets mean and<br/>
yells, hits, and his entire attitude changes.  When they are this<br/>
young what do you do or say to them?  Do you allow them to eat<br/>
whatever all day?<br/>
<br/>
I am exploring and reading alot about unschooling so I am new to it<br/>
all and this is one thing I am having trouble with.  Any comments are<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Also, <br/>
I have a daughter in PS that I want to pull out for next year.  She is<br/>
12.  She has never been homeschooled/unschooled etc so it is a big<br/>
decision for me.  I KNOW I will get alot of resistance as far as<br/>
family.  My sister is graduating with a Masters in Education so she<br/>
can be a teacher, blah blah so you can understand her resistance. My<br/>
parents are very mainstream and not adaptable.  <br/>
<br/>
Another huge concern I have is that my daughters father and I are<br/>
seperated for 7 years now but still don&#39;t agree on a thing. I have not<br/>
told him my intentions to pull her out of school yet but I know I will<br/>
get resistance from him also.  We have a family court order granting<br/>
me physical custody (she lives with me, visits him) but with joint<br/>
custody and decision making - which means educational decisions also.<br/>
 What should I do???  Should I try to explain to him the<br/>
un/de-schooling or do I just tell him I will be homeschooling and come<br/>
up with stuff just to pacify him.  I am so confused and scared.  His<br/>
wife is a school teacher.  Although I did find out by my daughter that<br/>
her brother homeschools his 3 kids so there is a slight chance that<br/>
they may understand.  The way the systems and gov. are today I am<br/>
afraid to just pull her out of school, have him take me to court, and<br/>
lose custody over my daughter due to mainstream thinking that a child<br/>
should be in school, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for rambling but my mind is on overload and it&#39;s starting to<br/>
hinder my deschooling decision and I don&#39;t want that to happen either.<br/>
Any advice, comments are welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son would eat junk all day.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does a 2 yr old have *access* to? They&#39;re pretty dependent on <br/>
whatever you make available. So make a tray with some cut up cheese, <br/>
fruit, crackers, etc. What not to do is buy a huge pack of M&Ms and <br/>
limit him to 4 per day (or whatever). If you&#39;ve got M&Ms, put some <br/>
out in a small snack cup (rinse out the plastic fruit cup cups, <br/>
makes great snack size portion cups) ALONG WITH the cheese and fruit <br/>
and etc. Yes, they&#39;ll probably disappear first...but then the cheese <br/>
and fruit will also eventually (unless you put out something he just <br/>
doesn&#39;t like). Food is food...it&#39;s balance that matters. Balance and <br/>
attitude. If some food is &#39;bad&#39; then there&#39;s a whole psychology <br/>
of &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to. But I like it. I feel guilty&quot; Food should <br/>
never be tied to guilt. Food should be food. And, kids are naturally <br/>
balanced UNTIL we start placing value judgements on things and <br/>
limiting this and that. I rad an article a few years ago in <br/>
Parenting magazing by a mom who is also a pediatrician. She was <br/>
concerned about her kids&#39; eating patterns (one kid appeared to be <br/>
living on macaroni, morning noon and night). So, she tracked <br/>
everything going into their mouths - including water, juice, etc - <br/>
everything, for one month (note kids typically balance over a longer <br/>
period than 3 square meals per day). At the end of the time she <br/>
checked and they pretty well balanced out on all counts - vitamins, <br/>
protein, carbs, etc. Another study with kids around 4 - 10 (or <br/>
something I forget the exact age parameters) checked height, weight, <br/>
etc of the kids and let them at a buffet every day 3 meals per day. <br/>
Buffet was everything from sliced oranges to cake, fruit, veggies, <br/>
meats, cheeses, candy, ice cream, etc. They could take and eat as <br/>
much of whatever as they chose. They were monitored with videotape <br/>
cameras and regular medical check-ins. And yes, for about a day or <br/>
three they went heavy on cake and ice cream. Then one kid in <br/>
particular started loading his plate with nothing but oranges, piles <br/>
of sliced oranges, and downing them like there was no tomorrow. In <br/>
evaluation (they checked with parents about life stuff going on), <br/>
they found out that he had been exposed to a cold and his body was <br/>
telling him to fight it. What made this study more interesting to me <br/>
was that I have *seen* this behavior in my son. He was maybe 2 1/2 <br/>
and went through days of eating oranges and more oranges (my fingers <br/>
were dyed orange from peeling them!). Then he got a runny nose, then <br/>
it was gone in all of maybe 2 days while those around were coming <br/>
down with a cold that took a week or more to dissipate. Ensure the <br/>
health of our kids is tied up with not destroying the balance they <br/>
were designed with by imposing our own constructions on them. Sweet <br/>
is a built-in - that&#39;s how to tell if something is &#39;safe&#39; in the <br/>
wild generally speaking. Sweet is carrots and sweet potatoes and <br/>
squash (I had an orange skinned boy for a short time when he was a <br/>
tot lol). Sweet is bell pepper and fruits of all kinds. we&#39;ve got a <br/>
bowl full of assorted Hershey&#39;s Kisses on our kitchen table. My 7 <br/>
1/2 yr old, well able to reach whatever he chooses, has barely <br/>
touched them. He has however been asking for egg and cheese omelette <br/>
sandwiches regularly. Something we did when he was about 4 or 5 was <br/>
note that he did seem to have very little frustration tolerance if <br/>
he hadn&#39;t eaten some protein/carbs together for a while. So, when I <br/>
saw the *early* signs of a problem, I&#39;d proactively ask him or, just <br/>
bring him, a favorite thing like string cheese or PBJ or whatever. <br/>
And, we&#39;d talk about it &quot;I see you are starting to get really <br/>
frustrated more than usual. Protein foods seem to have helped you <br/>
with that in the past. Would you like strawberry or grape on a PBJ?&quot; <br/>
over time (and we were rarely that wordy, but all I&#39;ve got here <br/>
online is words), he started himself connecting the rising <br/>
frustration feeling with the need to get specific kinds of food. So, <br/>
he requested we list &#39;protein&#39; foods on the chalkboard so he <br/>
could &#39;do it himself&#39; and pick what he wanted. By request we also <br/>
have a list of potassium rich foods (relatd to discussion of blood <br/>
pressure and sodium/potassium balance). He&#39;s gotten quite adept now <br/>
(he&#39;s 7 1/2) in coming up with combinations that have protein, <br/>
potassium, etc assorted blockbuster combos with lots of nutrition in <br/>
a tasty handy package<br/>

Hi Danielle!  Our experience with food is a bit different than  most, so I <br/>
thought I would share what we do.  I was a non-controlling food  person from the <br/>
beginning, my brother and step-dad fought about food all the  time and I was <br/>
never going to make it an issue in my home.   But,  although it has taken a <br/>
long time to really understand all the details, both of  my children are food <br/>
sensitive/reactive and have trouble self-regulating.   I have tried to figure <br/>
out how to achieve my first goal of non-control and  keeping them healthy and <br/>
limit their problem foods.<br/>
 <br/>
I keep a good supply of their favorite and &quot;safe&quot; foods with easy  access.  <br/>
They are free to eat as much as they like of these, whenever they  like.  Foods <br/>
that they have trouble regulating, like cookies, I might put a  typical <br/>
serving size in a ziplock bag and only have a bag or two with their  names with <br/>
easy access.<br/>
 <br/>
When we go to the store, I ask them to pick a set number of treats.   So, <br/>
kool-aid, sugary cereal, candy and cookies all fall under the same  category.  We <br/>
talk a lot about healthy choices and that it is a good idea  to make some <br/>
healthy choices every day.  I talk a lot about my own  choices.  I might say out <br/>
loud &quot;I&#39;m feeling XXXX, I think I&#39;ll eat some  XXXX to feel better&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
think I ate too much XXXX because I&#39;m feeling  XXXX.&quot;  After they have had a food <br/>
related bad experience, I might say &quot;I  notice you were feeling XXXX, maybe it <br/>
was that XXXX you ate.&quot;  Depending  on the circumstances, I do different <br/>
things with a  problem food.   Examples: find a good substitute (different brand <br/>
sometimes is all it takes),  use homeopathy and other alternative aids, have on <br/>
hand a special favorite to  offer instead.  I always try to make it about <br/>
solving the food mystery, not  blame the child.<br/>
 <br/>
Most recently, I have started using food enzymes created for autism  <br/>
spectrum.  One of the products is specifically for a gluten/casien  free diet.  I have <br/>
seen really positive results in both of my children and  myself, even though <br/>
we have never really considered a GFCF diet!   Information can be found at <br/>
_www.enzymestuff.com_ (http://www.enzymestuff.com) .<br/>
 <br/>
Hope something in here might be useful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001110070">well, being that this isn&#39;t a radical unschooling list, you won&#39;t get a lot<br/>
of negative reaction to your need to control your children in any way. <br/>
unschooling basics kind-of gives you room to grow in your lives as<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
my whole issue is this... if you don&#39;t want your children eating &quot;junk&quot; food<br/>
on a regular basis, then why do you have the junk food in your homes?  why<br/>
the different rules for yourselves and your children.  if you want your<br/>
children to eat healthy on a regular basis, then you must show by example.<br/>
<br/>
unschoolers don&#39;t live the &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; mantra.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know who posted a while back<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and they said that  it was their responsibility as a parent to ensure<br/>
the health of their  child.  I feel the same.  I can&#39;t imagine what my<br/>
son would be  like if I didn&#39;t enforce healthy food and snacks.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
is it enforce or force?  and the only responsibility we have is to SHOW our<br/>
children how to live... not to force them to live a life different than what<br/>
they see in front of them everyday.<br/>

Hmm...this is a supportive list, yes. But I don&#39;t think that extends to supporting parenting that can detract from unschooling. Wanting to control your children would not help form a trusting, unschooling household. <br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with what you posted about modelling the behaviors we&#39;d like to encourage in our kids. I just wanted to point out that that *is* radical unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184264296">&quot;well, being that this isn&#39;t a radical unschooling list, you won&#39;t get<br/>
a lot of negative reaction to your need to control your children in<br/>
any way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what led to this impression, since most of the regulars<br/>
and  both moderators and owners are radical unschoolers!!:)<br/>
We try to gently point people towards radical unschooling since it IS<br/>
a beginners list.  I bite my tongue a lot when I read some<br/>
posts...I&#39;ll admit.  There are a lot of posts I just don&#39;t hit the<br/>
&quot;send&quot; button on!!<br/>
<br/>
In the list description it says &quot;... this is a place for you to<br/>
discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural<br/>
learning and how it affects our ENTIRE lives. From parenting issues to<br/>
learning from the whole wide world and beyond....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to explode the myths about traditional parenting, we&#39;re<br/>
here to tell you that you CAN give your child freedom to choose and<br/>
they will be fine, we&#39;re here to say that controlling food,<br/>
controlling tv/video games etc... is NOT going to help unschooling unfold.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to each person what they use and don&#39;t use here. Nobody is<br/>
here to tell you how to run your household, just offer up useful<br/>
advice that could potentially be lifechanging. <br/>
I think every step closer to unschooling is a step closer to better<br/>
relationships and more joyful/peaceful households...so it&#39;s all good.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796324378">&quot;When they are this young what do you do or say to them?  Do you allow them<br/>
to eat whatever all day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have never forced my son to eat anything he didn&#39;t like or didn&#39;t think he<br/>
would like and he has always at least tried stuff. Even eats fish and lima<br/>
beans as his first choices off of the all you can eat place we go to.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, I have a very picky 14 month old DD. When we started on solid food,<br/>
she would eat very little. A bite of this, a nibble of that... though it was<br/>
difficult we would go through everything in the house - try a hotdog, fruit<br/>
snack, piece of bread, cookie - surprise, surprise she likes sugary foods.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So that is a lot of what she would eat cookies, crackers, fruit snacks, etc.<br/>
of course we are backing it up with breastfeeding. Everyday was an<br/>
experiment for months and months... a bite of this - a nibble of that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Never thinking she would like raw veggies - her five 1/2 yo brother still<br/>
prefers cooked if I can get him to eat them at all. I was eating a carrot<br/>
and she grabbed it. I put my hand out (a tactic I learned if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like something she just hands it back instead of throwing it on the floor).<br/>
She looked at me, thought of giving it back and chewed on it and ate it all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even today, I gave her a few fruit snacks and she handed them back. She<br/>
preferred to have some cheese and a bit of her brother&#39;s hotdog and a small<br/>
slice of the banana bread her brother made.<br/>

Hi, I have been reading many of the posts regarding food intake,<br/>

<br/>
difference between what&#39;s going to give him a stomach/head ache etc? <br/>

<br/>
I am exploring and reading alot about unschooling so I am new to it<br/>
<br/>
all and this is one thing I am having trouble with.  Any comments are<br/>
<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, <br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter in PS that I want to pull out for next year.  She is<br/>
<br/>
12.  She has never been homeschooled/unschooled etc so it is a big<br/>
<br/>
decision for me.  I KNOW I will get alot of resistance as far as<br/>
<br/>
family.  My sister is graduating with a Masters in Education so she<br/>
<br/>
can be a teacher, blah blah so you can understand her resistance. My<br/>
<br/>
parents are very mainstream and not adaptable.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Another huge concern I have is that my daughters father and I are<br/>
<br/>
seperated for 7 years now but still don&#39;t agree on a thing. I have not<br/>
<br/>
told him my intentions to pull her out of school yet but I know I will<br/>
<br/>
get resistance from him also.  We have a family court order granting<br/>
<br/>
me physical custody (she lives with me, visits him) but with joint<br/>
<br/>
custody and decision making - which means educational decisions also.<br/>
<br/>
 What should I do???  Should I try to explain to him the<br/>
<br/>
un/de-schooling or do I just tell him I will be homeschooling and come<br/>
<br/>
up with stuff just to pacify him.  I am so confused and scared.  His<br/>
<br/>
wife is a school teacher.  Although I did find out by my daughter that<br/>
<br/>
her brother homeschools his 3 kids so there is a slight chance that<br/>
<br/>
they may understand.  The way the systems and gov. are today I am<br/>
<br/>
afraid to just pull her out of school, have him take me to court, and<br/>
<br/>
lose custody over my daughter due to mainstream thinking that a child<br/>
<br/>
should be in school, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for rambling but my mind is on overload and it&#39;s starting to<br/>
<br/>
hinder my deschooling decision and I don&#39;t want that to happen either.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice, comments are welcomed.<br/>

<br/>
It all connects so seamlessly. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526010945">Ren, <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it sounded weird the way I wrote it... the thing is, is that I do<br/>
belong to other Radical Homeschooling lists and they will come down very<br/>
hard on certain things.  This list because it helps to redirect &quot;school&quot;<br/>
thinking and coercive parenting in a way that is more forgiving, is not seen<br/>
as a radical unschooling list.  Many newbies may not even know what Radical<br/>
Unschooling is and what it entails.<br/>
<br/>
And, like you, there are many many times where I don&#39;t respond when I want<br/>
to and/or rewrite my replies because I keep the &quot;basics&quot; in<br/>
unschoolingbasics in mind.  I realize that there are many who come here who<br/>
don&#39;t even have a grasp on what unschooling is at all.  I most certainly don<br/>
t want to scare anyone away by getting radical on them until they seek it.<br/>
<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] some questions<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;well, being that this isn&#39;t a radical unschooling list, you won&#39;t get<br/>
a lot of negative reaction to your need to control your children in<br/>
any way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what led to this impression, since most of the regulars<br/>
and  both moderators and owners are radical unschoolers!!:)<br/>
We try to gently point people towards radical unschooling since it IS<br/>
a beginners list.  I bite my tongue a lot when I read some<br/>
posts...I&#39;ll admit.  There are a lot of posts I just don&#39;t hit the<br/>
&quot;send&quot; button on!!<br/>
<br/>
In the list description it says &quot;... this is a place for you to<br/>
discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural<br/>
learning and how it affects our ENTIRE lives. From parenting issues to<br/>
learning from the whole wide world and beyond....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to explode the myths about traditional parenting, we&#39;re<br/>
here to tell you that you CAN give your child freedom to choose and<br/>
they will be fine, we&#39;re here to say that controlling food,<br/>
controlling tv/video games etc... is NOT going to help unschooling unfold.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to each person what they use and don&#39;t use here. Nobody is<br/>
here to tell you how to run your household, just offer up useful<br/>
advice that could potentially be lifechanging. <br/>
I think every step closer to unschooling is a step closer to better<br/>
relationships and more joyful/peaceful households...so it&#39;s all good.:)<br/>
