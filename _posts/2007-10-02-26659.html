<div id="ygrps-yiv-655602229">I&#39;m reading &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; and loving it. Our whole<br/>
family is fairly spirited (or &quot;spunky&quot; as the author calls it), but<br/>
our son is really highly spirited. There are times when I&#39;m just<br/>
overwhelmed or confused because I just can&#39;t figure out how to make<br/>
things click and go smoother for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
This book is helping me see his POV and understand his temperament<br/>
much better. Our needs - in terms of space, interaction, physical<br/>
activity, etc - are on opposite ends of the spectrum. We&#39;re both<br/>
intense people, but he is *very* extroverted whereas I am highly<br/>
introverted. I&#39;ve long suspected this but didn&#39;t have a good grasp on<br/>
what extroverts need. Ah, now it makes sense! Reading through the<br/>
small section in this book on introverts/extroverts, I am better able<br/>
to see the *whys* behind his behavior. It&#39;s helped me put myself in<br/>
his shoes and respond to his needs with more compassion... but...<br/>
<br/>
While this is helping me understand him better, I&#39;m still short on<br/>
having the actual tools to help us all meet our needs. Maybe some<br/>
folks can develop them on the fly once the understanding is in place,<br/>
but in this case I realize I need some help getting from point A<br/>
(understanding) to point B (making it work). DH asked me how we can<br/>
put this knowledge to practical use... hmm. The book doesn&#39;t discuss<br/>
what to do if the family is composed of 3 people who are introverts<br/>
and one that is a strong extrovert. I need real-world suggestions for<br/>
making it work. There are times when it seems like he takes what he<br/>
needs even when it&#39;s over the threshold of what the rest of us can<br/>
comfortably handle. I *know* there are positive solutions and ways to<br/>
really appreciate this part of his personality. When his extrovert<br/>
needs are met, he really sparkles. But afterwards I&#39;m often left<br/>
feeling exhausted and my energy is drained and I get cranky.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot for DH & DD to handle as well. If the kids fight it&#39;s<br/>
usually because one wants space and quiet (daughter) and the other<br/>
wants conversation and physical closeness (son). I&#39;ve tried to be a<br/>
buffer between them - to help ds get his need for interaction met<br/>
while dd enjoys a period of quiet, but afterwards I feel drained and<br/>
have no reserves left for others or myself. I can&#39;t concentrate well,<br/>
problem solve, or react calmly and rationally when my energy level<br/>
gets that low. It feels that whenever I reach that point something<br/>
happens that is like that proverbial straw on the camel&#39;s back and I<br/>
end up frustrated, overwhelmed, and grouchy.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s five and isn&#39;t good at negotiating or understanding others&#39; needs<br/>
yet. Explaining that if DD has some quiet time by herself then she&#39;ll<br/>
be ready to play or that I need a few minutes alone doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about his needs vs the needs of others and balancing give<br/>
and take, etc, with empathic language and lots of patience. But he<br/>
cannot fathom why anyone would want to be alone or why we need quiet<br/>
space or that the bouncing, fidgeting and constant stream of sound is<br/>
difficult for our sensory systems to handle hour after hour. I know it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense to him because in his world being around others and<br/>
moving his body makes him feel good. I know he is just trying to meet<br/>
his needs - and this realization has helped tremendously from my<br/>
*reaction* standpoint, but the rest of still need to meet our needs,<br/>
too, and I&#39;m at a loss there. I know there is a win-win solution.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recommend a book that discusses introverts & extroverts and<br/>
has practical ideas for creating harmony & meeting everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
when different types are living together?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281759450">Susan - I have a very high energy extroverted child as well.  A couple of<br/>
things that help us in our house.<br/>
<br/>
1.	I attempt to set up as many playdates as possible.  First I make<br/>
sure these are friends she wants to be with. I also select time and place<br/>
and length of time of engagement where I know it will best suit all<br/>
involved.  This helps to spread some of the energy outward and relieves me<br/>
of the full intensity all the time.  I use the time she is engaged with<br/>
others to take care of what I need to do.  Sometimes that means focusing on<br/>
my other dd.<br/>
2.	Mothers helper.  Find an older child, teenager or adult who can come<br/>
and give my dd the attention she deserves.<br/>
3.	Consciously using my dh.  Setting up special time for them one on<br/>
one.  A trip to the zoo or a movie together.<br/>
4.	Physical outlets and activities.  AS much as possible for her.<br/>
While she still wants me present at the place she takes dance classes or<br/>
tumbles, I use that time to stitch or knit.  (reading a book doesn&#39;t work<br/>
because she wants my attention focused on her).  This is my down time.<br/>
5.	My dd is very loquacious.  When we are out she can spend an hour<br/>
talking to someone and not want to leave someplace even though the rest of<br/>
us are ready to go.  I bring along book or handwork or use this time to<br/>
engage with my other family members.  I use this time as my rest time while<br/>
she engages others around her.  My dd is no longer 5yo and so now I don&#39;t<br/>
have to participate in the conversations as I once did as she often needed<br/>
interpretation and unfortunately adults could be disrespectful to a young<br/>
child&#39;s honest inquiries.  But now that she&#39;s 9 - she navigates<br/>
conversations pretty well with strangers and 99% of the time adults are<br/>
tickled by her attention and interest.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As draining as it feels now, as you continue to respectfully honor him by<br/>
responding with patience explanations about how others feel the need for<br/>
quiet or down time, he will learn to navigate these social cues himself in<br/>
time.  My dd is extrodinarily sensitive to understanding others energy<br/>
boundaries because her energy boundaries have been honored in a respectful<br/>
manner.  This came with age.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of these ideas help.<br/>
