<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080089033"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If we all just &quot;got it&quot; by mulling it over, we wouldn&#39;t need lists or  &gt;books or movies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something that is working great for me is learning why mandatory schooling was begun in the first place. I&#39;m reading &quot;The Underground History of American Education&quot; by John Taylor Gatto right now. <br/>
<br/>
Once I began to see that schools were started to inhibit children&#39;s natural intelligence by dumbing them down, and to create a society of consumers and obedient employees who were unable/unwilling to think for themselves, unschooling is much clearer and more attractive to me. <br/>
<br/>
Gatto is an award-winning former PS teacher, who spent 30+ years teaching and researching for this book. It&#39;s eye-opening to say the least.<br/>
