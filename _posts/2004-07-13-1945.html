<div id="ygrps-yiv-167189880">I appreciated Ren&#39;s post, and Robyn&#39;s clarification, on boundaries.  And I need some help on this issue.  Will is quite opinionated and &quot;bosses&quot; me around.  I am not sure where this has come from, as I do not &quot;boss&quot; him in any way...that is, I do not tell him what to do, what not to do, etc.  He is totally free and even more so since I have come to this list.  But before that even, I have never restricted him at all.  Yet he is saying to me &quot;No don&#39;t sit in the chair, Mama, sit on the floor,&quot; (fine, I sit on the floor), &quot;No, Mama, don&#39;t sew, DON&quot;T SEW,&quot; (okay, maybe I have been wrapped up in this project, I&#39;ll go play w him), &quot;Don&#39;t take a shower.&quot; (well, I need to get clean!), &quot;Don&#39;t check you e-mail,&quot; (fine, it&#39;ll wait), and even &quot;No, Mama, don&#39;t eat cereal.&quot; (Baby, I&#39;m hungry...)  If I say to him that I am hungry and I keep eating he proceeds to stand there and scream.  It is not that he wants me to play w him or whatever, we have playing together all morning, but that he wants to<br/>
 tell me what to do and don&#39;t do.  I don&#39;t like to hear him pissed and upset, screaming or crying, and normally I do all I can do help him get happy, but this has been going on for a while now and I AM doing what he tells me to do or not doing what he tells me not to do, and I know that isn&#39;t right.  But I hate for him to be upset, especially if it is because of me, but my goodness, I need to eat and shower....<br/>
<br/>
Like I said I can&#39;t figure out where he has learned this type of behavior as he has not been bossed around in his life....but I would like some help on setting some boundaries.  Would you suggest being hard in this regard, like, &quot;Mama is hungry, I am eating, I&#39;ll share mine w you or get you something if you want to eat, too, but I am eating,&quot; and then just sit there and let him scream and cry? I have never let him cry and it doesn&#39;t feel right.  Or should I continue to give in and let him tell me what to do...and hopefully it will pass?  I have always modeled kindness, consideration...and he IS exhibiting these traits in OTHER areas...  I don&#39;t like being demanded to do anything, and that is a BIG reason why I have chosen to never make demands of him...wish he would return the favor!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read about &quot;joyful disruptions?&quot; This might be a good use of <br/>
that kind of response - or at least something verbally imaginative.<br/>
<br/>
For example, he says, &quot;No, don&#39;t eat cereal,&quot; and you say, &quot;It isn&#39;t <br/>
cereal - I&#39;m eating a big bowl of juicy fat WORMS. YUM YUM YUM.&quot; He <br/>
says, &quot;Mommy, don&#39;t take a shower,&quot; and you say, &quot;Well, if I don&#39;t <br/>
we&#39;re going to be able to plant seeds all over my skin, I&#39;ll be so <br/>
dirty, and then the seeds will grow into plants and I will be a walking <br/>
forest.&quot; Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Could work - having a sense of humor really helps a lot with parenting. <br/>
You just have to be careful that it doesn&#39;t come across as teasing or <br/>
making fun of him.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I&#39;ll be listening to other responses, because I also do not <br/>
at ALL handle it well when I feel like somebody is ordering me around. <br/>
It pushes all my buttons, too. I&#39;m sure there will be others here with <br/>
some great insight and we&#39;ll both learning something!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473270667">Hi, Millie,<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a couple of things going on at this stage - which both of<br/>
my chileren went through - my son is still figuring it out.  With the things<br/>
that take your attention away from him, I think he&#39;s just wanting your<br/>
attention all the time and doesn&#39;t have the skills to make polite requests<br/>
yet.  So you&#39;d probably like him to say &quot;Mama, could you put your sewing<br/>
down, please?  I&#39;d really like to play with you.&quot;  And he will learn that<br/>
from your example when you want him to stop doing something and pay<br/>
attention to you, and from your possibly asking him to say it differently if<br/>
you wish.  But our experience is that takes a while - I&#39;m still reminding my<br/>
3 1/2 yr old to do this, but he&#39;s a lot better than he used to be.  A key to<br/>
my own stress is to reframe what he&#39;s said in my mind.  So when my son (who<br/>
still does this) says &quot;Mama, don&#39;t take a shower!&quot;  I hear it as &quot;Mama, I so<br/>
love to play with you and be with you that the idea of being apart from you<br/>
in the shower makes me really sad&quot;...and sometimes I reflect this back to<br/>
him to remind us that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about with &quot;Nicky, do you not want to<br/>
be apart from mama.  Is that hard?&quot;  Sometimes I just put off the shower,<br/>
try to do it when he is distracted by a video or playing well with his<br/>
sister for company.  Sometimes I ask him when would be a good time for him<br/>
to have me do it since Mama is so stinky and wants to get clean and we can<br/>
agree on a good time for both of us.  That type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
The thing where he tells you not to eat cereal I perceive as kids learning<br/>
boundaries as they grow.  My son for instance, still thinks of my body as<br/>
one with his in many ways.  He&#39;ll give me orders about my body.  When I say<br/>
&quot;Nicky, that&#39;s mama&#39;s body and I decide about my body.  This is Nicky&#39;s body<br/>
and Nicky decides about his body&quot; he&#39;ll often reply &quot;No, that (pointing to<br/>
MY body) is Nicky&#39;s body!&quot;  Well, when you think about it, we did in fact<br/>
start out as one when he was in the womb.  He grew as a part of me and we<br/>
were the same body.  Makes sense to me that the separating and the figuring<br/>
out of boundaries might take some time, especially since we are extended<br/>
breastfeeding.  So he doesn&#39;t want me to eat food that HE doesn&#39;t like etc.<br/>
I pretty much take it in stride and try to accomodate him while reminding<br/>
him about his body and my body.  If it&#39;s going to really drive him to tears<br/>
to see me eat something he doesn&#39;t like one day, I&#39;ll just eat something<br/>
else.  Obviously if he doesnt&#39; want me to eat at all (which has happened),<br/>
I&#39;m going to explain I have to eat and try to find some way he can<br/>
contribute to my eating that helps him feel good about it.  Like helping me<br/>
make toast or something.<br/>
<br/>
It is sort of a tricky thing and it&#39;s hard not to perceive it as ordering us<br/>
around, but I think there are other messages underneath!<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t handle it very well I&#39;m afraid!:) I don&#39;t like being bossed around at all...but he&#39;s so very little too.<br/>
I really love Pam&#39;s suggestion about slipping humor into the situation.<br/>
A little distraction might help also, &quot;I&#39;m really hungry right now, so I&#39;m going to finish this and then we can play, here&#39;s a ___________ &quot;(good tv show, sink full of water, shaving cream on table...whatever gives him a little fun while he&#39;s waiting) <br/>
<br/>
When my kids have used a bossy tone with me I might say something like &quot;I really don&#39;t like being talked to in that manner, could you try it a different way?&quot; or simply tell them a couple of other ways they could have said the same thing, without being so aggressive.<br/>
They usually don&#39;t even realize how it&#39;s coming across.<br/>

As Joan said.... &quot;My son for instance, still thinks of my body as<br/>
one with his in many ways.&quot;  I really think that no matter how much freedom we give our kids, they are still little people in a big world, and there are so many things they can&#39;t control...they are learning about what those things are (including you!). IME, being &quot;bossy&quot; at this stage is not something they learn (although it is easy to assume that, since so many kids are bossed), I think it&#39;s a combination of temperment and developmental stage/cognitive processing. It&#39;s tough though, because I know that I felt that I was doing something wrong or treating DD badly because of the way she would talk to me and other adults (rarely other kids, FYI).<br/>
I also try not to use the term bossy when I&#39;m talking to her or other adults (or when I&#39;m thinking about it), but rather &quot;Wow, she really knows what she wants!&quot; <br/>
Joan&#39;s comments about humor are great. I&#39;d also add, what works for us...humor combined with logical consequences and a clear/non guilt tripping expression of needs. &quot;I would *love* to play Wizard of Oz with you now, honey, but my body is *so* hungry that I wouldn&#39;t be able to concentrate on the game or really enjoy spending time with you. I&#39;d be sitting there thinking &#39;food food food food (in a silly voice), instead of remembering the words to your songs that you like so much. It&#39;s important to me to give you my full attention so we can both have fun.&quot; Here I stop talking, and Bethan (3.25) usually says something like &quot;I have a *great* idea, why don&#39;t *you* eat something, and *then* come play Wizarder of Ozzer with me!!&quot; If she doesn&#39;t come up with that solution herself, or continues to press, I either offer that as a solution &quot;Are you willing to...&quot; or I encourage her to come up with other ideas &quot;Can you figure out a way that I can eat and we can play the game at the same time.&quot; It&#39;s lovely to see what wonderful ideas she comes up that are &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; and get both of our needs met. <br/>
In the past, I&#39;ve said things to her like &quot;You wish mommy would do exactly what you want me to, exactly the *way* you want me to, just like Joanie (her doll) does. But I&#39;m not like Joanie, because I have feelings and sometimes I need to do things differently from the way you want me to. I sometimes wish everybody would do exactly what *I* wanted them to, but then just think how boring the world would be! (and then I do some silly skit where everbody does what I want, and wackiness ensues). <br/>
This is a tough issue, one that DH is working on. He does things like &quot;Bethan, is it okay if I go to the bathroom?&quot; And she says...&#39;No! Play with me!&quot;...He&#39;ll then look at me as if to say &quot;Okay, what do I do now? I gotta pee!&quot; LOL. It&#39;s a journey. <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes it helps Mikey (3.5) and Caroline (1.5) if I help them name <br/>
their feelings. So I told Mikey Sunday that I was going out by myself <br/>
and he said &quot;No, Mommy don&#39;t go.&quot; I said &quot;Are you sad that I&#39;m <br/>
leaving? Are you going to miss me?&quot; He says yes. I say that I&#39;m going <br/>
to miss him too and we&#39;ll both be sad when I leave, but I bet we&#39;re <br/>
both going to have fun after that (leaving him room to say &quot;no, I <br/>
won&#39;t have fun!). <br/>
<br/>
Caroline often stops crying instantly if you say what she&#39;s mad or <br/>
sad about. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re mad that Grandmom had to get off the phone and <br/>
you can&#39;t talk to her any more.&quot; &quot;Mmm-hmmm.&quot; Dh _totally_ didn&#39;t <br/>
believe that would work until he saw it!<br/>
<br/>
So Millie, maybe taking a guess at what Will&#39;s feeling might help. <br/>
It&#39;s frustrating that you have to wait til Mommy&#39;s shower is over...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough not being able to control what other people do and when <br/>
they do it! I had that issue when I managed people, lol. I used to <br/>
joke that I&#39;d watched too much Star Trek and longed to just say &quot;Make <br/>
it so!&quot; without discussion!!<br/>

or cleaning or something that doesn&#39;t involve him he is going to <br/>
protest for sure, but no, this is an in general thing.  He is just <br/>
trying to be the boss of me!  He tells me to vaccuum, to wear a skirt <br/>
(I almost always wear long skirts, but if I put on pants he tells me <br/>
to take them off...&quot;Mama&#39;s aposta wear skirts,&quot;  pretty much all the <br/>
time these days he&#39;s telling me what to do.  Lots of times he asks <br/>
nicely and has even picked up please, and especially &quot;Please don&#39;t&quot; <br/>
which I much prefer to being yelled at.  This morning it was &quot;No, <br/>
Mama, please don&#39;t poop in the potty, PLEASE DON&#39;T&quot;  It&#39;s gotta be <br/>
some kind of developmental thing or phase, whatever.  His name, Will, <br/>
fits him...makes me think of this sig line...<br/>

When Dylan was crabby and wanted some comfort he&#39;d climb up on my lap and<br/>
say &quot;Give me that stinking nursing!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then, later he would pat me and say &quot;nice nursing mama, thank you.&quot;   <br/>

Duncan went through a long phase of being delightfully polite. When he  <br/>
interrupted, he&#39;d say, &quot;Excuse me, please.&quot; Adults would just GUSH over this and  <br/>
say, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s sooo polite.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Right.<br/>
 <br/>
But when you didn&#39;t stop talking immediately, he&#39;d say again, &quot;Excuse  me.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Keep talking, and it became, &quot;EXCUUUUUSE MMEEEEEEEE,  PLEEEEEEAAAAASE!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Folks around here started to listen up pretty quickly! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

How old is Will?  I think this is a common stage for kids around 3.  <br/>
My son was pretty bossy for awhile and would get really upset if we <br/>
didn&#39;t do exactly what he said.  Reading &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; by <br/>
Lawrence Cohen really helped me understand what was going on and good <br/>
ways to respond to it.  Humor helps a lot!   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lately when Kyle (4.5 yo) won&#39;t &quot;let&quot; me eat, etc., I just, without <br/>
missing a beat, incorporate it into our play.  Example:  we are <br/>
playing dinosaurs, I have a hunger attack, he protests, I say, &quot;okay <br/>
I am T. rex and this toast is an apatasaurus leg.  Ummm, yumm!&quot; <br/>
(appropriate dramatic tearing off a bite of toast)  Or, if I feel I <br/>
need to fold clothes (for some weird reason): &quot;I am an oviraptor and <br/>
there could be some eggs under one of these piles of leaves--I&#39;m <br/>
going to look under all of them.&quot; (while quickly folding as I look).  <br/>
I guess I have also said things like &quot;I am T. rex and WE always go to <br/>
this special bush to pee&quot; (if I need to go to the bathroom).<br/>
<br/>
It ASTONISHES me how easy this is for us.  If I reframe it this way, <br/>
he happily says okay to THE VERY THING he was just protesting about.<br/>
<br/>
