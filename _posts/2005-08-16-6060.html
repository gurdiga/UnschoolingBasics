<div id="ygrps-yiv-920067675">Have you and your son seen &quot;The Lords of Dogtown&quot; ?  There was a very<br/>
interesting documentary on recently about the making of that movie.  I was<br/>
watching to catch a glimpse of some friends of ours who were background<br/>
actors on the film.  I didn&#39;t know I was interested in skateboarding either<br/>
but it was fascinating seeing these creative vibrant people doing their<br/>
thing.  There is a big group in So Cal called &quot;Skateboarding Moms&quot; or<br/>
something.  The head lady is a homeschool mom and they get together to do<br/>
expos and skateboard clinics.  Too cool.  <br/>

I watched a skateboarding thing last week on one of the ESPN channels.  I<br/>
don&#39;t remember what it was but some skateboarding competition.  Danny Way<br/>
was skating on a fractured ankle, said he couldn&#39;t feel his foot,  but<br/>
was *flying* off these very tall ramps and blowing my tiny mind.  There<br/>
were other famous skateboarding guys doing amazing tricks too.  Dylan<br/>
came by and said &quot;I didn&#39;t know you liked skateboarding&quot; and I said &quot;I<br/>
didn&#39;t know either!&quot;&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Might have to go to the library...<br/>
