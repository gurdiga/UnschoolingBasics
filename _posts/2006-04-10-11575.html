<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250162240">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling basics, and I haven&#39;t read the archives.  I&#39;m lucy, and I live in Texas with my husband, and four kids.  I would say we are extremely relaxed, but leaning toward unschooling more, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
For the past month I&#39;ve given up restricting electronics.  Two of my kids ( 12, 8 boys) literally go from the computer, to the ps 2, to the t.v., constantly rotating.  Today a neighborhood friend came down, and asked my 12 yo to play, and he refused saying he was busy.  The weather is wonderful for playing outdoors-- soon it will be way too hot!!  I had a problem with him saying no because of the nice weather (although I didn&#39;t say so), sitting still most of the day, and he has the freedom to play all the time!!   I&#39;ve heard differing arguments about the restriction of electronics:<br/>
<br/>
 1)  They will eventually fill up on them, and will take breaks...or slow way down.  If the type of games were limited I could see this, but we have many games, and they all play runescape online...which is very involved, and the interesting stuff on it never ending, and they are always adding new &quot;quests&quot; to the game.  Cable TV also provides endless &quot;new&quot; watching opportunities. Right now they don&#39;t care to go outside, and explore.  If the teenish age kids did this I would think it was part of the phase, but the eight year old???  <br/>
<br/>
2) The other side of things:  If you limit the electronics they will be forced (yikes--not a good word) to find other things  to do.  They do find other, very interesting things to do, build, and play--but that sometimes also includes begging for more game time.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to decide how to handle this issue, how to document, how to answer the question from a neighbor who I am friendly with (and she is a teacher), &quot;Are they getting their work done?&quot;  They knew about my not restricting electronics, and wanted to know how it was going...hence the question.<br/>
<br/>
Another concern is my kids have been interested in a few things, but not with the passion I hear about from other unschooled kids.  One son was interested in dinosaurs (passionately) for 5 years--all sorts of neat things came from that experience.  One son is interested in wars, and there have been other things along the way, but not as many as I would really like to see, and NONE from my eight year old.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to reading all the posts, and exploring the archives. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know you all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058857514">Hi Lucy...welcome!<br/>
<br/>
You said that you just gave up restrictions on electronics a month <br/>
ago. Maybe they&#39;re getting their fill right now. Maybe they just <br/>
really, really enjoy gaming. <br/>
One of the best pieces of advice I picked up from these lists is to <br/>
be there, right along side your kids when they&#39;re doing something. <br/>
Hang out with them while they&#39;re playing. Grab a control and play <br/>
also. The three of you can go online and look for gaming sites and <br/>
cheat codes for their favorite games. <br/>
Also, I curious...where do you live that it&#39;ll be to hot soon to go <br/>
outside. We live in Florida and my kids play outside in the morning <br/>
and evening in the summer because it&#39;s just to hot in the afternoon. <br/>
Maybe you can also think up some fun things to do out of the house-<br/>
take them to a park or a hiking trail or go bike riding with <br/>
them,,,maybe you can even invite their friend. <br/>
As for answered questions from your teacher-neighbor-friend....for <br/>
right now, I&#39;d say as little as possible until you are more secure <br/>
with what you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s what worked for me. I have to get <br/>
things all right in my own head before I can talk to people about it <br/>
(not my husband-just other people). How about handing her an <br/>
unschooling book...maybe one of John Holts which she may enjoy ebing <br/>
she&#39;s a teacher. Or maybe direct her to a website. When she asks a <br/>
question, you could say something like &quot;I like that you&#39;re <br/>
interested in learning more...here&#39;s some information I picked up <br/>
for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hoped some of this helps. I&#39;m on the journey also amd <br/>
reading the archives helped me a great deal. <br/>

stop one game to play another or watch TV, so new quests are not  <br/>
keeping them glued there ;-) Gaming might always be a big interest  <br/>
but they&#39;re already showing you that they do have other interests.  <br/>
It&#39;s just that they&#39;re busy exploring the things that were previously  <br/>
limited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954446299">Lucy, too neat to be going through almost the same thing right after<br/>
embracing our wonderful new outlook!  Just goes to PROVE that we are<br/>
in the company of women who have &#39;been there, done that&#39;.  I received<br/>
my book today that a person here recommended (sorry I can&#39;t remember<br/>
who recommended) but the title is &quot;Happy and Rich without an<br/>
Education?&quot;  What an absolute AWESOME book and the guy does not even<br/>
mention homeschooling but so far it echoes, Llewlyn and Holt, this<br/>
stuff blows me away.<br/>
<br/>
LOL...mine children are both loving RuneScape!  In fact, I bought them<br/>
each a membership.  Watching them encourage one another is just too<br/>
neat.  Brooke was out playing earlier and Zachary got some really neat<br/>
things and was so excited that he came running to tell his kid sister<br/>
the good news.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
They play it a lot and watch tv quite often but their outside is quite<br/>
a bit too.  However, since buying the subscription yesterday I&#39;m not<br/>
surprised that outside time went waaaaaay down, I realize it&#39;s only a<br/>
couple of days....besides, we&#39;re putting in our new pool liner and if<br/>
my dh and I don&#39;t kill each other, they&#39;ll be swimming away next week.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Two of my kids ( 12, 8 boys) literally go from the computer, to the  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; ps 2, to the t.v., constantly rotating.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Right now, part of what they&#39;re doing is hoarding because they fear  <br/>
&gt;  this freedom is only temporary and they need to pack in as much as  <br/>
&gt;  they can before the restrictions return.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  If someone would only let you have a small square of chocolate once a  <br/>
&gt;  week, how would you react to being let loose in a room full of free  <br/>
&gt;  chocolate? If you feared the restrictions would return, would you  <br/>
&gt;  limit yourself to a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of chocolate?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  A month of unrestricted play isn&#39;t enough. They need to gain  <br/>
&gt;  confidence that they can walk away and still be able to play when the  <br/>
&gt;  come back. They need to make up for the time when they couldn&#39;t play.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Today a neighborhood friend came down, and asked my 12 yo to play,  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; and he refused saying he was busy.  The weather is wonderful for  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; playing outdoors-- soon it will be way too hot!!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  30 years in the future, if they miss one spring of playing outdoors,  <br/>
&gt;  what will it mean?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; we have many games, and they all play runescape online...which is  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; very involved, and the interesting stuff on it never ending, and  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; they are always adding new &quot;quests&quot; to the game.  Cable TV also  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; provides endless &quot;new&quot; watching opportunities.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  As Joanne suggested, being with them will help while they play and  <br/>
&gt;  watch.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Make sure they have other opportunities. Don&#39;t try offering when  <br/>
&gt;  they&#39;re in the middle of a game ;-) Try discussing at the beginning  <br/>
&gt;  of the week or the day before of places to go and making a plan.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Right now it may be unreasonable to expect them to want to do other  <br/>
&gt;  things. But in a few months they will want to do other things. They  <br/>
&gt;  stop one game to play another or watch TV, so new quests are not  <br/>
&gt;  keeping them glued there ;-) Gaming might always be a big interest  <br/>
&gt;  but they&#39;re already showing you that they do have other interests.  <br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s just that they&#39;re busy exploring the things that were previously  <br/>
&gt;  limited.<br/>
