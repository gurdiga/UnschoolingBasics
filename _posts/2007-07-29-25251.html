<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276257714">I am so unsure about what to do!  My three year old is quite a <br/>
dancer.  She is very good at it, too (not just my opinion:))  When <br/>
we are shopping--she is dancing.  At home or at play--she is <br/>
dancing.  She has rhythm, she will change her moves with the beat or <br/>
music style.  She has grace, she can do beautiful hand and leg <br/>
movements in perfect ballet style just like in her videos (even up <br/>
on her toes--I discourage it).  <br/>
<br/>
Some time ago, I thought, what a great idea for her to take a <br/>
toddler dance class.  She would be able to socialize with other <br/>
toddler&#39;s (she craves interaction) and she could &quot;learn&quot; more about <br/>
the subject that I know basically nothing about.  She was excited <br/>
and talked about the class quite often (though &quot;we&quot; often brought it <br/>
up first). <br/>
<br/>
Now I am having second thoughts.  Actually, someone in this group <br/>
had said that the classes are highly overrated (when I casually <br/>
mentioned it during a dilemma with the pacifier).  We have already <br/>
registered, but the class does not begin until late August.<br/>
<br/>
My main issue is that I thought the class would be geared more <br/>
toward play (it is called Imagidance).  But, upon reading the info <br/>
at registration I found that parents can only observe <br/>
during &quot;parents week&quot;(three months later) and there will be a <br/>
recital.  Well, I feel like this is more like a real &quot;class&quot; and my <br/>
child will be EXPECTED to perform some sort of a routine.  This <br/>
seems to take away from the fun in my opinion.  She is only three <br/>
and I wonder if this is a lot to ask of her?  I am guessing that she <br/>
will have to stand/sit/pose upon request and since I won&#39;t be there <br/>
I won&#39;t be able to observe her reaction to these requests.  I also <br/>
won&#39;t know if the teacher uses manipulation or whatever else to get <br/>
satisfactory results.  My mind is thinking of scenarios such as; &quot;I <br/>
told you to go to the bathroom before class (it is written on the <br/>
paperwork), so you will have to learn to hold it&quot;, or &quot;if you want <br/>
to be a ballerina, then you will HAVE to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that most classes don&#39;t allow parents to sit and <br/>
observe.  I don&#39;t know if I am being paranoid.  What do you think?  <br/>
At this point, do you think I should leave it up to my child or <br/>
should I tell the teacher that something has come up and tell my <br/>
daughter that we will wait until she is older to take classes? What <br/>
if my daughter is adamant about taking the class, then what?  Most <br/>
of the time she can be persuaded with a better offer (ie. let&#39;s go <br/>
to the park instead).<br/>
<br/>
What have I done???!!<br/>
<br/>
TIA for advice</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102030878">Hi,<br/>
I have studied the essence of dance and movement for<br/>
some time now - and I also have a little dancer, my<br/>
youngest son who is almost 3.<br/>
This is just my personal opinions after studying for<br/>
some years - but I  truly believe that each person<br/>
(especially the ones that are natural dancers - some<br/>
are more easy with the voice or the mind) has their<br/>
very own &#39;dance&#39; that, when they follow the movement<br/>
they feel inside and are completely hemselves, will<br/>
be, ideally and with some &#39;work (or awareness)&#39; be in<br/>
complete harmony with other dancers in the same space.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I believe you can do at this time is to<br/>
just expose her to lots of different music, especially<br/>
the classics, that she will enjoy moving to. Take her<br/>
to concerts - outdoors preferrably - where she can<br/>
dance to her hearts content and also meet other kids<br/>
informally.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with formal dance lessons is that they<br/>
&#39;might&#39; take away that natural exuberance and her<br/>
trust in what she already knows. And real dance has<br/>
nothing to do with learning steps and movements.<br/>
Ballet at one time was alive, when it was born of the<br/>
urge to move (with God, inspiration -see Nijinski and<br/>
Isadora Duncan), but once you try to replicate what<br/>
came natural to one person, it becomes &#39;dead&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
She already knows, the trick is now to not have her<br/>
loose it by making her think that dance is whatever<br/>
some teacher tells her to do. <br/>
There are ways to strenghten her &#39;dance&#39; experience -<br/>
maybe I can elaborate in another post if you are<br/>
interested -<br/>
<br/>
What to do with the class - I would not commit to it<br/>
if you are worried about the money - ask if she could<br/>
do a trial lesson somewhere. At that age that should<br/>
be possible. And then, if she is &#39;begging&#39; to go back<br/>
it might not do too much harm at her age. It will most<br/>
certainly not teach her things about dance she does<br/>
not already know -<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
(if you are in MA ours little ones could dance<br/>
together sometime :-)<br/>

That is how I feel, but I was afraid I was being overly protective.  I <br/>
would be nearby, so safety would not be a concern.  But, I am afraid <br/>
of the things someone might say to her that could hurt or influence <br/>
her in some way.  In other words, I would not want someone to tell her <br/>
something that would result in harm to her inner self.  I frequently <br/>
intervene with family and friends as it is.  <br/>

Have you seen the studio in which the class is conducted? If there is no<br/>

even if they&#39;ve never seen it or been exposed to it before.<br/>

I was reading something a few weeks ago that explains it. Apparently,<br/>
music stimulated the motor center of the brain which is why toddlers<br/>
are so inclined to dance and move to sounds and music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-403583734">My 2 year old is really showing signs of possibly being interested in<br/>
gymnastics.  She will grab things above her head and lift her feet off of<br/>
the ground and swing for minutes.  This includes the dinning room table, my<br/>
in-laws bar, or the gazelle (exercise machine).  I am looking for a good<br/>
place to take her without paying a fortune.  We are a one-income family with<br/>
all it implies.  My 6 year old took ballet at the community college a couple<br/>
of years ago and is now interested in doing it again, and my 10 year old is<br/>
looking to learn some pop dancing such as the type they do at Top Hat.  I am<br/>
trying to allow them at least one elective a piece, but I need to find<br/>
somewhere that we can afford, perhaps one that is based on a sliding scale.<br/>
If anyone can recommend a place, please forward it too me.  We are members<br/>
of the YMCA (qualified for a partial scholarship) so I am going to check<br/>
since most of their classes are available at a discount or lower cost.  What<br/>
is a Creative Movement class, I have not heard of these.  My 2 year old<br/>
turns three in October, so this is something we might be interested in.  <br/>

energy in creative ways. It is fine to be concerned, but I would say check<br/>
out the dance studio first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d take her to more playgrounds, actually. She doesn&#39;t really need <br/>
a class - she knows what she wants to do. Big muscular movements. <br/>
You might want to check out several playgrounds both with the <br/>
equiptment in mind and also the mix of regular kids. Mo liked to be <br/>
able to watch other kids do things and then try them herself, so we <br/>
looked for playgrounds where there were regular climbers. <br/>
<br/>
If outdoor play isn&#39;t feasible due to weather, look for ways to <br/>
create more opportunities for whole body play indoors - adult <br/>
exercise equiptment is often good for that just bc of the relative <br/>
size difference. Its also possible to get good deals on used <br/>
equiptment at yardsales and thrift stores. The one thing I&#39;d look <br/>
into getting new is a big exercise ball - they&#39;re a blast! Just pick <br/>
up the legos first ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wanted to comment on this, specifically. Its good to think <br/>
critically about this kind of statement. There&#39;s a lot of societal <br/>
pressure to make these kinds of assumptions about younger and <br/>
younger kids, but they aren&#39;t realistic and don&#39;t really foster a <br/>
closer relationship. There&#39;s a Huge jump in assumptions and <br/>
expectations between &quot;active 2yo who likes to climb&quot; and &quot;interested <br/>
in gymnastics&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way...if your 2yo were the type to dash off at <br/>
any given opportunity, would you say she was &quot;interested in track?&quot; <br/>
If she loved to throw, would you say she was &quot;interested in <br/>
baseball?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It may be that you&#39;ve gotten comfortable with the idea of classes <br/>
from your older kids, but a 2yo doesn&#39;t need a class. She just needs <br/>
to play. <br/>
