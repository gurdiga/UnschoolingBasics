                      2007 Highlights: Debbie Shapiro<br/>
    Unschooling = Montessori!<br/>
<br/>
   DEBBIE SHAPIRO<br/>
  is a parent, step-parent and educator who, thanks to the support of her husband Sig, has enjoyed spending over twenty seven years playing with children. Although Debbie is new to un-schooling, she is very excited about it and shares the underlying values and philosophy. Debbie has over 22 years of direct personal experience combating the drill and test mentality that plagues traditional education. Her strong conflictual feelings on testing compelled her to close her highly successful Montessori pre-school program. She is now a successful, and much happier, Montessori school ³drop-out.² She remains a passionate lover of all things Montessori: hands-on, self-directed and fun. Each of her sessions will incorporate the best of Montessori theory, practice and materials.<br/>
  Debbie holds a BA in Human Development; Certification as a California Early Childhood Education Teacher and is a credentialed Montessori Pre-Primary Teacher. She runs her own consulting practice; Evergreen Education Services.<br/>
  Debbie will host:<br/>
  Meeting Your Children Where They Are<br/>
  Knowledge is always the best tool for making good choices. You will learn how to assess where your child is in his/her development and how to support their unique approach to learning. This knowledge will help guide you in selecting a full range of creative, open-ended, self-directed activities. We¹ll talk about and experiment with many different kinds of activities which will compliment your child¹s learning styles, abilities and interests.<br/>
  Get Organized : Space Design Ideas That are Kid Safe and Learning Friendly<br/>
  Debbie shares room-by-room ideas of ways to create child friendly, accessible areas in your home that will encourage and support your child¹s active, self-directed participation in everything from setting the table to exploring space.<br/>
  Math Mania<br/>
  Come try for yourself some of the creative hands-on materials that teach your child foundational math concepts from simple counting to division. You will leave with loads of fun and engaging ideas for activities you can create at home even on a shoestring budget.<br/>
<br/>
                    <br/>
  Let us put our minds together and see what we will make for our children.<br/>

About Rethinking Education<br/>
  Founded in 1994, Rethinking Education, with its international conference, is at the forefront of a rapidly growing trend in education.<br/>
  RE is organized and produced by Barb Lundgren, an unschooling mom with 24 years of magical, glorious and utterly amazing unschool experience. What a great life it is to nurture and support not only your child&#39;s drive to be free, but your own as well!<br/>
  At the heart of Rethinking Education is awareness that children are supremely capable of absorbing and using knowledge from our complex world. There is no need for arbitrary structure in education; the use of coercion, rewards or other behavior modification techniques as motivation are counterproductive. With freedom, respect and nurturing support, children have a powerful drive to self-direct their own learning; the result being children who direct their own education... indeed, their own futures.<br/>
  Education viewed this way becomes a mutual endeavor, a life-long process of questioning and discovery ... a true exploration of self, society, our big, beautiful world.<br/>
  Proponents are widespread and include John Taylor Gatto, Jan Fortune-Wood, John Holt, Bruno Bettleheim, Alice Miller, Ivan Illich, Susannah Sheffer, A.S. Neill, Daniel Greenberg, Jonathan Kozol, and many others.<br/>
  <br/>
We&#39;re Looking for a Few Great Mentors<br/>
  We are receiving lots of requests for unschool mentoring! Thank you to all of you who have already volunteered to help - everyone appreciates you. Unschooling is very much a &quot;Brave New World&quot; for many, and your experience and wisdom can be a glorious breath of fresh air for a mom who passionately wants to embrace unschooling but is struggling. If you can offer some time to mentor someone, email Barb at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:barb@...">barb@...</a>. Typically, a mentoree will want to exchange emails with you for a few weeks, or, with your permission, call you at their expense to talk through their challenge. LOVE to you!<br/>
  <br/>

                        What People Are Saying About the Rethinking Education Conference<br/>
  <br/>
  &quot;What a wonderful, magical, thought-provoking weekend!! I was so happy to hear there would be another conference. We have attended every conference since our 8 year old was an infant and our teenagers were just reaching &quot;school age.&quot; I feel so fortunate that my timing was just right in meeting you all 12 years ago. I am not sure I would have had the courage to unschool our children all these years otherwise. Attending the conferences just backs up my instincts, as La Leche League did for breast-feeding and home births.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! My 2 daughters and I attended the Rethinking Education Conference this past year for the first time. I loved it!!! The weekend was a revelation for me. I just kept thinking and saying, &#39;this way of learning just makes sense!&#39;<br/>
  I think I experienced almost every emotion during the conference... excitement, sense of freedom, love, happiness, joy...but also fear, frustration, jealousy, sadness, and even anger. I feel so thankful that there are leaders like you who help to bring people together who share common interests, beliefs, and values. Again, thank you! You are an angel in our lives. My husband, the girls, and I plan on attending the Conference again next year.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;I think this conference was my favorite, although I say that every year. It feels like such a safe wonderful village, appearing once a year, like Brigadoon. It&#39;s always so wonderful to see new people having those doors open in their minds, as mine did, people putting words to your thoughts, affirming what you hoped was right and true.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Kid Village was fabulous! Every session I went to was wonderful; I love the whole atmosphere, with people doing what they love and needed at any time, all the inspiration around me.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;I cannot begin to tell you how wonderful, impactful, and &#39;opening&#39; the conference was for us. Be back next year with neighbors for sure.&quot;<br/>

                    MORE 2007 Highlights: Michael Mendizza<br/>
    Welcome back Michael!<br/>
<br/>
   Play is the most serious undertaking of a childs life. It is the umbrella under which all learning takes place.<br/>
  Joseph Chilton Pearce<br/>
  MICHAEL MENDIZZA<br/>
  is an author, educator, documentary filmmaker, and founder of Touch the Future, a nonprofit learning design center, and executive producer of the Nurturing Project. Michael¹s work centers on the state of optimum learning and performance, what Athletes call the Zone, researchers call Flow and children call Play. Both Nurturing and Touch the Future promote authentic free play as the optimum state to meet any challenge, at any age. Helping adults rediscover and embody this state while relating with children eliminates the majority of conflicts in a relationship, freeing energy and attention required for optimum learning and performance. Michael writes and speaks on varied topics including Media and the Brain, The Next Frontier in Education, Birth, Bonding & Brain Development, Transcendent Mentoring of This and Future Generations, Who Do We Think We Are (on the origins of self and its limitations), Science, Story, and Creativity, The Origins of Love and Violence and The<br/>
 Intelligence of Play. He is the author of Magical Parent-Magical Child, a book he co-authored with Joseph Chilton Pearce. His websites are www.ttfuture.org, and www.nurturing.us<br/>
  Michael will host the following sessions this year:<br/>
  To Me Or Not To Me<br/>
  Ever feel embarrassed? Why? The images we have about ourselves predetermine how we relate to the world and most importantly to our children. If the our self-image image is switched on, smart, stupid, fat, thin, boy, girl, macho, cute, sexy, our behavior is filtered through that image. Our behavior is limited and we infect our children with the same limitations. Collectively we call these limiting filters ME. For most of us, for most of our lives we think that this collective image called is real and necessary. In optimum states, play, flow and what athletes call the zone, the limiting self-image is switched off, freeing the full spectrum of our vast potential to meet the world fully and completely. As parents and educators, To Me or Not to ME? That is indeed is the question if we want our children to actualize their full potential.<br/>
  Anger, Conflict and General ARRGHs: a Dad&#39;s Discussion Group<br/>
  Michael&#39;s research and life experience has convinced him that much, perhaps even the majority, of men&#39;s general grumbling, anger and dissatisfaction is due to identity conflicts between them and the women in their early lives, beginning very early with dear old-mom. Want to hear more? Share your own ideas, and explore resolutions.<br/>
