<div id="ygrps-yiv-200943633">I know I am jumping in on the conversation a bit late but wanted to<br/>
add....<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that my dd was bipolar because my mom is, and because<br/>
she can be very explosive too, but mostly verbally. I&#39;ve also  read<br/>
&quot;The Explosive Child&quot;  and found it very helpful. .  We have worked<br/>
out that if she is frustrated to come squeeze it out of me or if I<br/>
notice it I&#39;ll ask is she wants a hug and that works alot of the time.<br/>
 But I know for some kids that would be the last thing they would want<br/>
to do.  I also love &quot;Raising the Spirited Child&quot; , I got the idea of<br/>
using sensory activities to help diffuse her frustration from there;<br/>
things like water play, playdough, &quot;goop&quot;, shaving cream, snow.   I<br/>
just really struggle with her teasing her brother.  But her intensity<br/>
is what led us to unschooling, and I&#39;m so grateful for that.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I was curious how long you&#39;ve been a RU and how old were your kid<br/>
 when you started? Ooohh what&#39;s a swing chair?!  I couldn&#39;t find it at<br/>
Ikea&#39;s website.  On googling people, I googled myself to see what came<br/>
up and there is a woman with my name that teaches belly dancing and I<br/>
just took my first class today LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel, &quot;My problem is that I would MUCH rather lecture than be<br/>
lectured.  When posting there is this small spot in my head that<br/>
envisions the community I post to be enraptured and bedazzled by my<br/>
brilliance.......&quot;     LMAO!!!  You need to write for a sit com!!! Can<br/>
you imagine, you could push the unschooling &quot;agenda&quot; and nobody would<br/>
notice because they would be dazzled with your humor and brilliance :)<br/>
<br/>
Leslie, &quot; Do you do any sort of meditative practice that helps you BE<br/>
in the  MOMENT?&quot;  I could really use help with this!!! But I&#39;m<br/>
clueless on meditating, any suggestion on where to start?<br/>
<br/>
Tyra, &quot;One thing I have thought about is the story about the mother<br/>
who acquired a horse for her children.  When I heard that the next<br/>
Conference would be in AZ, I thought that chances of me and my family<br/>
attending would be slim as I live in TN.  However, I am going to use<br/>
creative thinking and figure out how I am going to make it there.&quot;   <br/>
   Please share your ideas!  I&#39;m thinking hard too.  I went to the<br/>
conference in St. Louis and dh thinks he&#39;s done, but I just have to go<br/>
again to NM!!!  I checked the train but it costs as much as flying and<br/>
took 48 hours!  Oh and my dd is passionate about wolves too.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been trying to come up with more ideas to support her love but I&#39;m<br/>
stuck; we&#39;ve done books, movies, stuffed animals, and the zoo. The<br/>
best was a wildlife science center that is a wolf research center,<br/>
they even had 2 Mexican Gray wolves! Have to go back again soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Gayle, (((hugs))) from a recovering controlling perfectionist and<br/>
wannabe RU.  I&#39;m not there yet, but I do have some &quot;being in the<br/>
moment&quot; moments and they have been coming more frequently.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to remember the saying &quot;Dull women have immaculate houses&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
Joanne, such wonderful news about Shawna.  Thanks for sharing, it gave<br/>
me so much hope.<br/>
