<div id="ygrps-yiv-106738111">Again, just throwing our a question/dilemma to see what discussion comes of it.<br/>
<br/>
My children are (almost) 9 (boy) and 3 (girl).  Because of financial constraints, they are almost always together.  My husband works days, and to make ends meet, I teach or tutor evenings and weekends.<br/>
<br/>
One difficulty I have is that each child has very different needs and interests, and neither really wants to accommodate the other.  Rosalie will want to go to the park, while Andrew wants to continue to play computer games.  Rosalie&#39;s best friend has a sister Andrew cannot stand (and vice versa).  Andrew&#39;s bedtime story at present is Neverwhere, while Rosalie prefers Dr. Seuss.

***I have dd12, ds6 and dd1.5, so I have been there :-)<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you feel like it is difficult to find separate time<br/>
together. Have you considered date nights? Each kid has one on one time with<br/>
each parent once a month. That&#39;s four nights a month. And it can be any<br/>
amount of time, we do 2 or so hours. We do things like $2 movies or buy tech<br/>
decks (ds needs about 2 hrs to select one- that doesn&#39;t work with the baby)<br/>
or a late park date or a walk or out for coffee.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One difficulty I have is that each child has very different needs and<br/>
interests, and neither really wants to accommodate the other.<br/>
<br/>
***Of course they have different needs and interests. They would even if<br/>
they were closer in age. I think that it is your guidance that will help<br/>
them find out how to support each others interests. Through you they will<br/>
learn to accommodate each other.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rosalie will want to go to the park, while Andrew wants to continue to play<br/>
computer games.<br/>
<br/>
***Can ds bring a portable gaming system or a laptop our a portable DVD<br/>
player? Ds may be old enough to stay home for short bits, eventually leading<br/>
up to him staying home while you take dd to explore. Have you shown your<br/>
children how to problem solve? Have you asked them for solutions?<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Rosalie&#39;s best friend has a sister Andrew cannot stand (and vice versa).<br/>
<br/>
***Does the sister have to come over? can you and the other mother swap<br/>
kids? Can DS stay in a closed room? Again, ask kids for ideas.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Andrew&#39;s bedtime story at present is Neverwhere, while Rosalie prefers Dr.<br/>
Seuss.<br/>
<br/>
***Why do they have a bedtime? Is it the same? Can you read to whomever<br/>
needs it first? Do they have to be read to daily? Can they listen nicely to<br/>
each others story? Can they do something else while the other one is being<br/>
read yo?<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Andrew will be watching a DVD and Rosalie will walk over to the player, pop<br/>

<br/>
***My littlest ones trade. Eventually they learn that sharing feels good.<br/>
help them see that sharing doesn&#39;t mean that something is taken from you<br/>
that it means that you are gifting something to sometone. I never force my<br/>
kids to share. I think that helps. I try to make sure there is enough, If i<br/>
see the need for more I find ways to get more (of whatever). This can be<br/>
challenging with my middle child. Do you share well? I am not trying to be<br/>
rude just what kind of generous attitude or attitude of scarcity are you<br/>
showing them?<br/>

I have two, eight years apart. Their interests have always been different. But I know families with twins whose interests and needs are *just* as diverse.<br/>

So many computer games are portable these days. I&#39;d make sure he had an alternative if we needed to be out and about.<br/>

Why can&#39;t the children stay at different friends&#39; homes or have the friends over separately? Cameron often had friends over without their siblings and went to their houses frequently. Why do siblings have to be at the same place at the same time?<br/>

or a late park date or a walk or out for coffee.<br/>
 <br/>
We have considered and occasionally get to do date nights, or at least little moments.  Rosalie also, lately, gets up a bit earlier than Drew, and sometimes sleeps in the early evening.  Andrew will accompany me to the grocery store  (Our neighborhod store is Bloom, and he likes to work the little scanner wand they have.  Very cool, BTW, if you have a store that does it.  You scan your groceries as you go yourself, bag them in the cart (they way you like them bagged), and get a running total on the scanner).<br/>
<br/>
Andrew&#39;s bedtime story at present is Neverwhere, while Rosalie prefers Dr.<br/>
Seuss.<br/>
<br/>
***Why do they have a bedtime? Is it the same? Can you read to whomever<br/>

read to?<br/>
 <br/>
They don&#39;t have a bedtime, as such, but they have bedtime stories, because they like them.  Things have to settle a bit at midnight so Dad can get some sleep (small apartment, kids share the one bedroom), but Andrew can play games on his laptop up in bed or in the back room.  <br/>
 <br/>
You know, the more I think about it, I think there are really two issues to solve.  One is finding more independent time for each child, even in our small place and with our work schedules.  The other is a residual from the time Andrew spent in school.  He left school in late October with a lot of hostility, and he has always found managing his temper to be a struggle at the best of times.  He still has a lot of anger and some bad habits from school (he was bullied and cruelly teased by teachers as well as other students).  He tends to pick on her (insulting songs, teasing, and deciding he wants something they have to share just because she wants it.)  She retaliates in kind, and sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell whether a particular conflict is over a shared resource or is for the sake of conflict.  <br/>
 <br/>
Andrew will be watching a DVD and Rosalie will walk over to the player, pop<br/>
out his program and put in a Dora the Explorer DVD.<br/>
<br/>
***That&#39;s not OK and she needs to be told and shown so. Can you have more<br/>

 <br/>
We do have more than one, but one is more comfy than the other.  She has been told and removed briefly from the room, numerous times.  (This is an issue she has with everyone in the house, especially Daddy, because she doesn&#39;t always leave the DVDs she removes in safe places even when the player is free.  At least now she has learned DVDs must be placed in the player one at a time.)<br/>
<br/>
Eventually they learn that sharing feels good.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m probably being impatient.  We only just started changing our style.  They are improving.  And it&#39;s not heck on earth here or anything.  They do often enjoy each other&#39;s company.  I need to practice consulting them for solutions when they&#39;re getting along.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>
<br/>
With six years between them, its not surprising that they&#39;d have vastly different needs and interests. My kids are 7 and 15 and they rarely want to do the same things, so we do a lot of problem solving around that. I don&#39;t expect them to accomodate each other, really - which makes it all the nicer when they go out of their ways to be kind to each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Andrew will be watching a DVD and Rosalie will walk over to the player, pop out his program and put in a Dora the Explorer DVD.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>
<br/>
Rather than make this into a turn-taking issue, you could get another dvd player or maybe set one of the kids up to watch movies on the computer. Its much harder to be easygoing about sharing when kids feel like their competing for a limited resource. Pawn shops often have good deals on electronics. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Rosalie will want to go to the park, while Andrew wants to continue to play computer games.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>
<br/>
At 9, is there any reason he *can&#39;t* stay home for an hour or two and play video games? Set him up with some snacks and tape your cell phone number (if you have one) to the home phone so he can contact you. Alternately, are there any kids your dd plays with regularly at the park? can you trade kid-watching with those families from time to time? Or find a baby sitter or mother&#39;s helper *just* to take a kid to the park or hang around the house while you go to the park.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Rosalie&#39;s best friend has a sister Andrew cannot stand (and vice versa).  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>******************<br/>
<br/>
Can the kids go to their friends&#39; homes without you? Can you invite just the one child, and not the sibling? Can you engage your unhappy child in some special activity so that he or she doesn&#39;t have to interact with an unwelcome guest?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Andrew&#39;s bedtime story at present is Neverwhere, while Rosalie prefers Dr. Seuss.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you read to both of them - does it have to be at the same time? Maybe you can settle one of them down earlier than the other. Or read at a different time of day. Or record the Dr Seuss stories (or the other story, but for the 3yo I&#39;m guessing its the same handful of stories over and over, so that would be easier). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What are some ways you have found to help younger children take turns?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>********<br/>
<br/>
A clear &quot;stopping point&quot; is really important in turn taking - at the end of a level or a show or a round works for some kids, others prefer a designated amount of time. Something to experiment with. If kids aren&#39;t willing to take turns, if may mean that they don&#39;t have the patience (either developmentally or as a result of stress) or that they haven&#39;t felt that their needs are being met consistently. Its possible to create a sense of abundance, as opposed to &quot;limited resources&quot; even on a pretty thin budget! but it can take some creativity and forethought.<br/>
