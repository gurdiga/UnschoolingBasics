I need some advice. My 5th grader has some learning issues related to<br/>
his Tourettes Syndrome, mostly very poor memory recall. His other<br/>
subjects he does fine but continues to lag behind mostly because he<br/>
has such difficulty memorizing his multiplication/addition/subtraction<br/>
and division facts. He understands math and some days has no<br/>
difficulties, most days that&#39;s not the case. We&#39;ve tried flash cards,<br/>
rote memorization, computer games (timez attack) and a multitude of<br/>
other things. Tutors have no ideas on what to do nor does the<br/>
occupational therapist. Everyone has just suggested that we let him<br/>
use a multiplication table which we do on occasion but I have issues<br/>
with him depending on it. We are both becoming quickly frustrated and<br/>
he is falling behind. Has anyone used any math program, books,<br/>
anything that can help us.</div>

<br/>
   So if this women is grasping for something.. then maybe just <br/>
maybe a straight forward approach like -- &quot;hey why don&#39;t you just <br/>
let him be.. You know he has a &#39;disability&#39; and they want to label <br/>
him as learning disabled too... then just let him go at his own <br/>
pace&quot;  maybe even mention the unschooling/homeschooling idea (gasp) <br/>
heck you never know she may just not know that it really is an <br/>
option.  To me they are just going to frustrate this boy if they <br/>
keep pushing.  Maybe ask her if they think he will truly use math?  <br/>
and to perhaps try having him use math in realistic life situations <br/>
and see how he does (ie. counting back change). If he does pretty <br/>
good then remind him that he probably won&#39;t even do his times tables <br/>
in real life anyway.. and if he does he will find a way to do it.  <br/>
Remind her to think about it.. that if he goes into a position that <br/>
requires &#39;math&#39; it&#39;s most likely he can just use the calculator <br/>
and/or the computer anyway to do the computations.  ok I&#39;m bablling <br/>
I&#39;m sure you thought of all this anyway -- I just  got a little <br/>
excited because I am becoming more used to the unschooling ideas <br/>
myself....   Basically just share with her the ideas you have... I&#39;m <br/>
sure since you are already worried about stepping on toes you will <br/>
say it what every you need to correctly. (obviously she&#39;s asking for <br/>
help, so what do you have to lose -- her saying oh no I couldn&#39;t <br/>
homeschool blah, blah bla()<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793285052">Here&#39;s what I would say:<br/>
*********************************************<br/>
<br/>
It sounds very frustrating for the both of you. Have you ever <br/>
considered relaxing your methods a bit? Maybe look for ways that <br/>
multiplication comes up in your daily life and discuss that instead <br/>
of trying to make him memorize something that he&#39;s having difficuly <br/>
with. <br/>
<br/>
My son also has memory issues (due to frontal lobe brain injury). We <br/>
play lots of memory games, like turning over cards and trying to <br/>
match them or looking at a picture, turning it over and then writing <br/>
all the things you remember. <br/>
************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was in 5th grade I vividly remember making a multiplication <br/>
table on graph paper - we filled it all in (1-20 I believe it was) and <br/>
we could color it or decorate it any way we chose. Then it was <br/>
laminated and hole punched and we could use it at will (the hole <br/>
punching was so we could keep it right in our 3 ring notebook so it&#39;d <br/>
be handy or we could use yarn and tie it to our desk so it would <br/>
always be there). We were allowed to refer to it at will -except- <br/>
during tests. The thing was, over time, we all referred to it less and <br/>
less. At first, it was &quot;necessary&quot; for many kids. Then it <br/>
became &quot;handy&quot; to check their work. Then it became &quot;just in case when <br/>
I&#39;m not sure&quot;. Then it became more work than it was worth because most <br/>
kids had memorized it simply by using the chart over and over and over <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I might comment on is that it is *her* issue - it&#39;s <br/>
not a problem with the OT, PT, tutors, anyone else BUT her. Why this <br/>
is such an issue to her might be worth exploring. If her DS *never* <br/>
memorizes the multiplication table, what then? Honestly explore the <br/>
Worst Case Scenario. What is her fear here - because that&#39;s what it is <br/>
mostly, her fear. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Manisha has a point.  Learning to use tools is an important skill.<br/>
I&#39;m the same way.  I use tools.  Recipes are tools, calculators are<br/>
tools, computers are tools, the periodic table of elements is a tool.<br/>
Scientists rarely memorize that table.  They eventually become<br/>
familiar with common elements (or those that they work with often) in<br/>
the same way that chocolate chip cookies are familiar to me.  But in<br/>
most science research labs you will find that chart hung on the wall.<br/>
Are scientists cheating?  No;  they are using tools!  And by knowing<br/>
how to use those tools he will eventually learn the things he needs<br/>
(even if it is to better utilize the tools he has been given!)<br/>

As Mom to two boys with Tourette, I found meeting adults with it<br/>
helped me relax. I went through the same worries as her before I found<br/>
unschooling. My son kept telling me that he didn&#39;t need to memorize<br/>
because he could use a calculator. It wasn&#39;t until I met a Mom at the<br/>
support group who had her MA in math but couldn&#39;t remember her times<br/>
tables that I realized my boy was right (guess I&#39;m a slow learner).<br/>
The Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada sells a Handbook for<br/>
Educators online that she might find helpful in adjusting her own<br/>
attitudes.<br/>
You could tell her about the homeschool HS Plus yahoo group. It&#39;s run<br/>
by a woman with Tourettes who has a relaxed attitude. <br/>
Everyday, I&#39;m grateful to have had children who turned my view of life<br/>

&gt;Could you ask her what her objections are to using<br/>
&gt;multiplcation table or a calculator? I have no memory<br/>
&gt;for phone-numbers, I look them up when I need them. I<br/>
&gt;miss every meeting at work unless I have an alarm set<br/>
&gt;on my computer that beeps 15 minutes before and then 5<br/>
&gt;minutes before the meeting. I don&#39;t see using the<br/>
&gt;caluculator as anything different than that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In real life, he&#39;ll never need multiplication tables.<br/>
&gt;What he&#39;ll need is making change.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I need some advice. My 5th grader has some learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues related to<br/>
&gt; &gt; his Tourettes Syndrome, mostly very poor memory<br/>
&gt; &gt; recall. His other<br/>
&gt; &gt; subjects he does fine but continues to lag behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; mostly because he<br/>
&gt; &gt; has such difficulty memorizing his<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiplication/addition/subtraction<br/>
&gt; &gt; and division facts. He understands math and some<br/>
&gt; &gt; days has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficulties, most days that&#39;s not the case. We&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried flash cards,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rote memorization, computer games (timez attack) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a multitude of<br/>
&gt; &gt; other things. Tutors have no ideas on what to do nor<br/>
&gt; &gt; does the<br/>
&gt; &gt; occupational therapist. Everyone has just suggested<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we let him<br/>
&gt; &gt; use a multiplication table which we do on occasion<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I have issues<br/>
&gt; &gt; with him depending on it. We are both becoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly frustrated and<br/>
&gt; &gt; he is falling behind. Has anyone used any math<br/>
&gt; &gt; program, books,<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything that can help us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718891933">To all who responded,<br/>
<br/>
thank you, thank you, for the wonderful thoughts and ideas.  I&#39;m happy<br/>
to say that others on my local list stepped up with some IMO<br/>
meaningful and helpful ideas, and not just a bunch of curriculum<br/>
recommendations!<br/>
I&#39;d like to save all your responses, anonymously, for future use  in<br/>
similar situations.  If anyone objects, let me know privately?<br/>
<br/>
again, thanks so much for your thoughtfulness.<br/>
