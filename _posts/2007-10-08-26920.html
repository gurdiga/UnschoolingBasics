<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650094962">DH and I have been talking the past few days about selling everything<br/>
to go on the road in a used RV. We currently own a home in our<br/>
hometown, live 3.5 minutes from both sets of parents,and have jobs (I<br/>
stay home and watch kids along with my 2.5 and 4.5 year old.). Our<br/>
families would freak out, so I am doing my best to develop an arsenal<br/>
of reasons for our choice as well as info to reassure everyone we<br/>
haven&#39;t gone off the deep-end. So far, they are pretty supportive of<br/>
our choice to not put the kids in traditional school (I was a pub<br/>
school teacher, so I have some pretty convincing arguments). I know<br/>
we&#39;ve never truly explained unschooling to them (they refer to what we<br/>
will do as homeschooling), and I am not really worried about that. I<br/>
am mostly worried about the usual things:<br/>
What if we can&#39;t stnad it once we&#39;ve gotten on the road?<br/>
What if our kids hate it? Miss Gma&#39;s and Gpas? Miss friends too much?<br/>
What do we do if someone gets hurt, sick?<br/>
What will we have to return to if and when we are &quot;done&quot; with our trip?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried this?? I need reassurance.<br/>
TIA!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638411334">OK....I&#39;ll jump in....<br/>
 <br/>
Ten years ago, my spouse and I loaded up the kids and traveled in our pickup with a slide in camper across the USA, up the Pacific coast, into Alaska, visited for awhile then worked our way back to the Canadian Rockies, then weaved our way south visiting lots of National Parks on the way back to the East Coast.<br/>
<br/>
There are many money saving ways to do this, one being get a Flying J membership.  Flying J&#39;s have fuel, water to refill your water tank storage, laundry facilities, and most importantly, a dump station.  We timed out our travels to hit the Flying J&#39;s to re-fuel (we had dbl tanks on our truck, too.) My spouse would dump the holding tank, then we would all shower as long as we liked, then he would dump the tanks again, so when we left, all the storage tanks were back to full and the gray & black tanks empty.<br/>
<br/>
You can also buy a US National Park Pass <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm">http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm</a> which makes visiting multiple parks affordable.  I contacted each state we planned on going through and they sent me lots of information on what their state had to see.  For Alaska, they have a travel book that they print every year telling you of everything you will need to know: Fuel stations and distance between, road construction areas, road grade, festivals and dates, etc...<br/>
 <br/>
As for income:  We were fortunate as neither of us worked.  My spouse had money in the stock market and we lived off our interest payments.  It helps to have your home paid off and no car payments.  At that time, we lived comfortably off $30,000. a year but we had few expenses and the kids were little.  My spouse kept us on the same &#39;budget&#39; we&#39;d have been on had we stayed home so we did advance planning.  Some activities can be pricey, so you budget them into the months spending.  We didn&#39;t stay in campgrounds often as that can become pricey.  <br/>
 <br/>
When we returned home we bought a farm and haven&#39;t done much traveling since.  We talk about selling the place and going to live on a sailboat or back to an RV, but the kids say only if the horses come along too. <br/>
 <br/>
My spouse spent all his childhood summers living on a sailboat, Bahama Island, canoeing boundary waters, or RV camping.  He would be more then happy to answer questions of how to manage this.<br/>
 <br/>
You can also rent nice RV&#39;s so you can have a &#39;trial run&#39; before you jump in with both feet.  Six weeks might prove more then you can handle in such tight space or you may love it!  I&#39;d also recommend that you or your spouse know how to do basic vehicle maintenance, generator connections, and empty the tanks.  <br/>
<br/>
Go RVing!  It&#39;s awesome!  Lol, you can also contact the Bare Naked Family (myspace) who are an Unschooling, RVing family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Susan,<br/>
Good to see we are both in the same &quot;planning&quot; stage (the<br/>
contemplating one;) )...<br/>
To answer this part of your post, neither of us have a job we can take<br/>
on the road. DH works for the local University, and I watch kids in<br/>
our home. We owe a lot on our home, but also have some equity, so we&#39;d<br/>
sell it in the hopes of finding a new home somewhere else on our journey.<br/>
I am thinking I could try to sell my knitted stuff, and I have <br/>
teaching credential...so possibly teach online somehow. Google Ads are<br/>
also a possibility. We plan to get an older RV, not too big, and just<br/>
go for 6 months to start. The scariest part for me is selling our home.<br/>
<br/>
Awaiting more replies...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000719359">There is absolutely no way for me to advise if you could make it happen or not, sorry.<br/>
As I said, for us, traveling made no difference then staying home except the scenery<br/>
changed.  At that time my spouse worked his stocks to keep a decent income. Which<br/>
would most likely be what he would advise, since it worked for him.<br/>
 <br/>
As for online employment, Florida Virtual School has teachers who work online only so<br/>
I know teacher jobs are available but once again, not something I&#39;ve looked into.  My parents<br/>
considered &#39;retiring&#39; and living in an RV.  They had found that you can &#39;work&#39; campgrounds and<br/>
such where you stay for awhile and help run the place.  When you&#39;re ready to move on you do.<br/>
I&#39;d have to call my dad to find out more about that option, as once again, I wasn&#39;t interested<br/>
so didn&#39;t listen closely, lol.  Bad me.<br/>
 <br/>
Remember, when you calculate costs, you need to keep in mind fuel prices.  Food cost more <br/>
in the northwest and milk is off the charts deep into Canada.  At one point, we opted to just do<br/>
without when they were selling a pint of frozen milk for $5.00!  In Juneau, Alaska, it&#39;s cheaper <br/>
to buy powders to mix your own drinks then to be premixed as you pay for shipping weight.<br/>
 <br/>
We used a Cummings-Diesel Pickup that walked right up the side of the steep mountains and never had to drop off our camper because it was in the bed of the truck.  Many people pulling fifth wheels had to leave their camper behind to go exploring.  Also, many people tow jeeps, trackers, neons behind the RV so when they get somewhere, they can park their &#39;home&#39; and have a runaround vehicle.<br/>
Some campers now come equipped with motorcycle carriers, too.  Once again, I couldn&#39;t advise which<br/>
style would work best for you as its all very personal choices.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d recommend that you start getting RV&#39;ing magazines, National Park Newsletters, etc, then decide<br/>
which style your family prefers.  Our slide in camper would be way too small for the size of our current family but it worked very nicely for our younger selves.  You can also visit Camper World (my parents favorite place) and also visit one of the camper shows to get a feel for just what your choices are.<br/>
 <br/>
My dad has been using a 35&#39; fifth wheel behind a Ford crew-cab diesel for the past ten years.  At 75 years old, he just built a slide in to load in the bed of the same truck.  I&#39;m extremely impressed that at his age, he just quit his full time job AND accepted another one.  He&#39;ll be using the camper so he and my mom can go on the road for his new job reading over construction contracts and visiting the sites.<br/>

take up to 3 weeks...we&#39;ll have to look into renting an RV. We have<br/>
some family property on the border of CA and OR that we dream of<br/>
landing on one day and building a log cabin home. We may have to use<br/>
this 3 weeks to check it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185271952">My husband works full time from home and we had been discussing doing a trial period of life on the road. We came up with a general plan and time frame as well as a preliminary map. <br/>
 <br/>
But guess what, when we brought it to our children they voted a whole hearted &quot;No!&quot;. Our kiddo&#39;s are 10, 13 and 16.<br/>
 <br/>
They said they were happy with the vacations we took every year and at the most there was discussion of a month long trip, but even then, they were iffy. And if we take a 3-5 week trip, they want to skip both week long annual trips, and cut back on the 3-4 day trips we take about once a month. It would actually not be much of an option, we couldn&#39;t budget both!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628361926">We did it!!! It was great. I would love to do it again. We drove <br/>
around the country for 2 years. We went through 28 states. It was very <br/>
educational and fun. When we started out we had 2 children, a 4yo son <br/>
and a 1yo daughter. We had another son along the way. It is the <br/>
greatest feeling of being free with no worries. We took lots of <br/>
pictures. We saw many, many beautiful places and met many interesting <br/>
people. We drove mostly backroads. We found some very cool camp <br/>
grounds. Some places we would only stay a day and some for up to 3 <br/>
months. We saw all 3 coasts. We finally decided to come home to see <br/>
the family for Christmas and decided to stay near home and buy a <br/>
house. Since being back sometimes I get to feeling claustrophobic the <br/>
at home. I think we will most likely do it again in a couple years. I <br/>
would say go for it. It really is an awesome feeling of freedom.</div>
