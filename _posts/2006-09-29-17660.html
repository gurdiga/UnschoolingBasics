<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307940676">&quot;Are there any possibilities for continuing to unschool with <br/>
separated/divorced parents? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only if the ex agrees with it.<br/>
I have not personally seen the courts uphold anyone&#39;s right to even <br/>
homeschool in a divorce case where one parent disagrees, though I&#39;ve<br/>
heard it&#39;s happened rarely.<br/>
Just remember, that if there is not abuse happening, then whatever<br/>
issues are at play are going to get WORSE by leaving, not better.<br/>
<br/>
When you throw yourself on the court system, you lose rights as a<br/>
parent. You lose more than the choice to homeschool...you lose the<br/>
right to have your child with you at all times. YOUR idea of splitting<br/>
time with the other parent sounds great, but the court may decide (as<br/>
they often do now) that you will have him for two weeks and the father<br/>
will have him for two. You won&#39;t decide that.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a case where divorce is better than staying (with<br/>
children involved) unless there are abuse issues at play. I&#39;m not<br/>
saying a happy relationship isn&#39;t your right, but when children are in<br/>
the picture it changes everything in my view. You just lose so much<br/>
freedom of choice in a divorce...both parents do.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I&#39;ve seen it work out ok, is when both parents agree on<br/>
the separation/divorce and use an arbitrator rather than the court<br/>
system. Not many people are able to put their own personal feelings<br/>
aside and simply do what is best for the whole family unit. If you<br/>
have a husband that could, then why not put the same energy and money<br/>
and emotion in to making it a great relationship?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502372626">&quot;Are  there any possibilities for continuing to unschool with <br/>
separated/divorced  parents? &quot;<br/>
<br/>

======<br/>
 <br/>
Joyce&#39;s has given a link to some recent discussions about this that have  <br/>
been enlightening and a good starting point for reading about both personal  <br/>
experiences and recommendations.<br/>
 <br/>
The one thing that has not been examined in much detail has been the  <br/>
financial impact of divorce.  The impact emotionally on families is huge  when <br/>
parents divorce or separate.  It seems that the financial  considerations are often <br/>
overlooked.  <br/>
 <br/>
Divorce or separation can mean two households, child support, medical  <br/>
insurance issues, both parents having to work, child care expenses, visitation  <br/>
expenses, as well as the legal costs incurred.  All these considerations  can <br/>
double if you remarry someone with children.<br/>
 <br/>
If you do divorce, it would be helpful to have a good plan and skills to  <br/>
support you and your children AND...you better have learned how to communicate  <br/>
effectively.  You&#39;ll need it to work out all the problems you&#39;ll face  not only <br/>
with your children but with your lawyers and your  ex-husband.  If you <br/>
remarry, you&#39;ll not only have all the new problems that  come with any relationship <br/>
but you&#39;ll now have to communicate with a new spouse,  an ex-wife, <br/>
stepchildren , new grandparents for your children, more  brothers and sisters-in law and <br/>
all their children.  I understand  completely how there may be circumstances <br/>
that make it very difficult, however,  learning to communicate and create a <br/>
loving relationship with your current  spouse makes sense from an emotional and <br/>
financial standpoint.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991146015">&quot;Un/homeschooling can<br/>
continue *if* the other parent will still be cooperative. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES, for sure.<br/>
And I love that some couples find ways to be co-parents without all<br/>
the difficulties of typical divorce situations. IF he would agree to<br/>
live in the same household and co-parent, that would be ideal.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my story; Dh and I separated when I was 4mos. pregnant with<br/>
Jalen (now 5.5). We had the textbook &quot;perfect&quot; separation. I had my<br/>
own house, he was planning on buying a house on the same street as<br/>
soon as our big house sold. He had the kids every week for at least a<br/>
night and day, he ate dinner over at our house occasionally, or came<br/>
to watch movies with us. We saw him very regularly as he did all of<br/>
our laundry (we joked and called him the &quot;laundry man&quot;) and picked it<br/>
up every few days. We spent holidays together as a family. We didn&#39;t<br/>
fight (disagreed yes), we treated each other kindly and respectfully.<br/>
Home/unschooling was a non-issue, he was totally supportive. Our<br/>
friends were baffled at how we could be such good friends, have fun<br/>
together etc...but still not want to be married.:)<br/>
<br/>
In spite of that &quot;perfect&quot; separation, our children suffered. My<br/>
oldest especially. If I had a 2.5 y.o., I might feel differently about<br/>
moving into separate households, because my younger ones don&#39;t<br/>
remember it as a stressful time at all...they never displayed the<br/>
stress signs my oldest did. IF you can have an amicable/happy<br/>
co-parent situation, then two houses CAN work. If there&#39;s any way to<br/>
keep the family under one roof though, do it. That&#39;s just my pov. It&#39;s<br/>
really hard on kids.<br/>
