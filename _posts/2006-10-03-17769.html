<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206439625">FRUSTRATED!  I just typed my response the the article and hit the mouse on accident and my back button went!  GREAT!  I will not remember what I typed, I thought it was good but maybe not since that happened!  huh?  Well, I am bummed the media has to play such a pre-school role in response to HS/Unschooling.  <br/>
