<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542645943">We&#39;ve been doing well with the adjustment period since I last posted.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned that change won&#39;t happen overnight, and that the kids<br/>
won&#39;t suddenly  have lightbulbs go off over their heads.  But things<br/>
have improved very much.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I am still not sure about is the issue of computer time. We<br/>
have discussed it before, but I lost those emails and the search<br/>
string is too common to get through the archives on.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the situation:<br/>
<br/>
There is only one computer in this house and four people who want to<br/>
use it. I bought the computer with my money in order to advance in my<br/>
graphic design career.  Since my pager broke, it is literally the only<br/>
connection I have with the outside besides my videophone and<br/>
interpersonal interaction. (I&#39;m deaf)  We all try to practice respect<br/>
with each other&#39;s toys/equipment/etc., asking permission and so on.<br/>
Now, the computer is a wonderful tool, but it is also sensitive and<br/>
important to me and very expensive (PowerMac G5).  In the past, I let<br/>
my son play on it whenever he asked and for as long as he needed.  I<br/>
wanted his needs to be met.  But then I also needed to use the<br/>
computer for communication and other things.  When I asked for my<br/>
turn, he&#39;d blow up and bang on the keys or other things that<br/>
endangered the security of others around him.  I explained to him, how<br/>
would you feel if I borrowed your DS and then threw a tantrum about it<br/>
when you asked for it back?  He understood it but not emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
I tried several different things, the current one being limiting him<br/>
to 7 hours a week, he can choose when and where he wants to use the<br/>
hours.  I don&#39;t really like it because it&#39;s not very unschooly, and it<br/>
can lead to him looking for ways around it.  Sometimes he does well<br/>
with it, but it&#39;s a stopgap measure... I wonder if it is better to go<br/>
back to unlimited usage with the respectful request of leaving it off<br/>
during the night so everyone can rest and if he blows up again when I<br/>
ask to use it (I do ask reasonably, like &#39;after this game is<br/>
finished...after this video is done, I need to check my email...&#39;) I<br/>
can refuse his request next time by saying politely, you were very<br/>
rough with the computer last time and I don&#39;t really want to share it<br/>
with you today.  Natural consequence?<br/>
<br/>
We do have another, older iMac that needs its CD drive fixed and a<br/>
reinstall of OSX.  I don&#39;t know how much it would cost to fix it.<br/>
Until then, what do you all think?  What do you do with your kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509770126">The first thing that comes to me is that your family desperately needs  <br/>
another computer. I think it&#39;s a priority if you can&#39;t afford one right now to  get <br/>
onto Craigslist and Freecyle and see if you can find one free. If you are in  <br/>
the greater Boston area, I think we have one you could have.<br/>
 <br/>
Mostly I&#39;m responding to the fact that your need for regular access and an  <br/>
intact computer that probably has specialized equipment on it for your  <br/>
disability and your work is vital, and those needs probably need to come first. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m assuming that your child is quite young. I wouldn&#39;t say that telling a  <br/>
child they can&#39;t use something THIS time because they weren&#39;t careful LAST time <br/>
 is a natural consequence. Unfortunately the natural consequence is that the  <br/>
computer could get broken or you didn&#39;t get a communication you needed -- <br/>
those  consequences are all on you.<br/>
 <br/>
Limiting hours is also tricky if he&#39;s young, because he may not really know  <br/>
what the heck 7 hours feels like. I don&#39;t have any brilliant ideas for <br/>
managing  this until you have another computer. After you DO have another, yours may <br/>
still  be &quot;better&quot; and you may still need to negotiate these things. That <br/>
comes back to  the original issue -- you need this tool for your disability and <br/>
work. This  computer is YOURS, and you may share it sometimes. I assume that his <br/>
DS is his  and he chooses when to share it...<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck! Seriously, if you&#39;re in the area, let me know and I&#39;ll see what  <br/>
we have in the realm of computers we&#39;re not using.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-151903782">DS is 8 years old going on 9. We live in NC.  I do have a broken iBook<br/>
G4 (screen) and iMac (CD drive) - the iMac is the one I&#39;m trying to<br/>
get fixed now.  The screen on the iBook is broken but it otherwise<br/>
works fine.  It costs $400 to get a replacement screen for the iBook.<br/>
I&#39;d be glad to work out a trade with someone who wants it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438198868">We have only one computer right now. We just make a queue if more than<br/>
one person wants to use it. I don&#39;t assign things the kids or the kids<br/>
and I create this together to meet everyones needs. My dh, who uses it<br/>
for work (graphic artist), also needs to wait for his turn. If there<br/>
is a deadline my kids will generally allow him on first, as they like<br/>
to eat {g}.<br/>
I thinking have more than one computer is a great idea. We are in the<br/>
throes of moving, and having just bought a house so it is getting<br/>
closer on our priority list.<br/>
