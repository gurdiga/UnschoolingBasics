<div id="ygrps-yiv-354487792">Would you be interested in participating in the unschooling blog <br/>
carnival if it was started up again? Ron & Andrea <br/>
(atypicalhomeschool.net) used to run it but had to stop and I&#39;ve <br/>
been thinking about trying to get it started again. <br/>
<br/>
For those of you that don&#39;t know what it is...a blog carnival is a <br/>
bunch of related blog posts on one topic, such as unschooling. It&#39;s <br/>
a great way to find new blogs, read some great posts and let other <br/>
people know about your blog. Not to mention, it kinda build a nice <br/>
unschooling community feel among the bloggers. :-) <br/>
<br/>
For now it would be held once a month (a lot of carnivals are held <br/>
every week but we can build up to that). <br/>
<br/>
All you would do is submit one of your posts on unschooling to me <br/>
every month and I&#39;ll put the whole thing together. <br/>
<br/>
Can you please reply at this link if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to keep the replies in one place so I know how many people <br/>
are interested without having to remember all the places I&#39;m going <br/>
to post this. LOL <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!  <br/>

thing*<br/>

I forgot to add...can you please ask on your blogs also? Even just a<br/>
small blurb would be helpful. You can direct them to the link to<br/>
answer.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; Would you be interested in participating in the unschooling blog<br/>
&gt; carnival if it was started up again? Ron & Andrea<br/>
&gt; (atypicalhomeschool.net) used to run it but had to stop and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been thinking about trying to get it started again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you that don&#39;t know what it is...a blog carnival is a<br/>
&gt; bunch of related blog posts on one topic, such as unschooling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a great way to find new blogs, read some great posts and let other<br/>
&gt; people know about your blog. Not to mention, it kinda build a nice<br/>
&gt; unschooling community feel among the bloggers. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For now it would be held once a month (a lot of carnivals are held<br/>
&gt; every week but we can build up to that).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All you would do is submit one of your posts on unschooling to me<br/>
&gt; every month and I&#39;ll put the whole thing together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you please reply at this link if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
