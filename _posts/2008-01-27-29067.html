<div id="ygrps-yiv-626295692">Hi All,<br/>
I have a question for those of you who unschool children with Autism.  My SIL is thinking of pulling her daughter Faith(5) from school to homeschool her.  Right now her and her brotherEdward (3), both diagnosed, go to a school set up for children with &quot;special needs&quot;.  They go to school and therapy 5 days a week and have improved a lot.  Sam is concerned that they will push Faith through to Kindergarten even though she is not ready.  You also have to understand that both kids are non-verbal and do very little sign language.  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t communicate to us what they want, they just do it differently.  Sam is concerned that Faith and Edward won&#39;t get the community based services that they need, and is worried that she won&#39;t be able to help Faith improve.  Understandably, Sam wants her kids to be able to lead as &quot;normal&quot; a life as possible and has fought to get all of the services that they have now.  Sam is naturally not an organized/schedule type person and has been doing her very best to keep to a schedule for both of her kids.  When Faith&#39;s routine gets disrupted she gets very aggitated, Edward usually just goes with it.  So, do any of you unschool your children who are non-verbal and have Autism and Sensory Integration Issues?  If you do, can you please give me an insight to your day.  I&#39;m sure this would help ease my SIL&#39;s mind and help her to decide if this is the right choice for her and her family.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
My eldest son Drew, who is now 8.5, is Autistic.  Although he is now very<br/>
verbal, he didn&#39;t get the hang of spoken language until around 3-3.5 years.<br/>
We used a great deal of sign language with him, as well as written language<br/>
(he was able to read by 2, which made communication easier for sure!).  Drew<br/>
was enrolled in public school for preschool, which was a special education<br/>
program specifically for Autistic kids.  Although I had planned to<br/>
homeschool in some form, and had made that choice long before the children<br/>
were born, I felt that the services he received via the district (for free)<br/>
were needful, so we went that route.  As it turns out, the preschool<br/>
environment was fantastic, he much enjoyed it and the adults involved were<br/>
all very loving and tuned in to the kiddos there.  Just as your sister<br/>
fears, however, he was &quot;pushed through&quot; to Kindergarten at 5 and he was<br/>
*not* ready.  In hindsight, I should have brought him home at that point.<br/>
Instead I allowed them to enroll him in a special ed K class.  What a<br/>
disaster!  It was partly that he wasn&#39;t ready, partly the horrible school he<br/>
was in (different from the preK school).  We stuck it out (mostly because of<br/>
DH&#39;s not being ready to embrace homeschooling) until March, when a situation<br/>
dangerous to Drew finally woke me fully and I brought him home. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>
routine, which he seemed to need.  Looking back, I think that was because in<br/>
his preK class *they* had a very strict routine for the kids.  Coupled with<br/>
most Autie&#39;s needs to have zero surprises in their life, this had reallly<br/>
conditioned Drew to expect rigid regularity.  As it turns out, we did not<br/>
have a rigid home life outside of his school experience, and he did okay<br/>
with that, so not sure what I was thinking!  Anyway, we used a strict<br/>
curriculum for 1st and 2nd grade, although by 2nd we were already falling<br/>
off the boat, so to speak.  I realized that Drew could roll with the punches<br/>
much more and truly enjoyed being in charge of his own time.  He does need a<br/>
lot of help to get in touch with his mental and emotional state in order to<br/>
change tracks, even when he wants to in order to do something wonderful<br/>
(like leaving a video game in order to go to Disneyland for the day), but<br/>
that&#39;s how it goes with him.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As far as services, Drew was receiving scanty services by K, and I honestly<br/>
did most of the work with him at home during the course of our regular day,<br/>
so we didn&#39;t miss the &quot;formal&quot; ones when they were gone.  I *really* don&#39;t<br/>
miss the ABA therapy - I always felt that one was like training a dog, it<br/>
gives me the creeps!  I do think these kids need help to adjust within our<br/>
world, but looking back at so many of the therapies Drew had, they were very<br/>
involved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL.  Which I never have agreed<br/>
with.  Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>
to fix him.  He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different.  That attitude switch<br/>
(when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>
Autistic!?  I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot;  I tell them<br/>
that I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>
system who doesn&#39;t value my kids for Who They Are.  IEP meetings, notes from<br/>
the teacher every day, stressed out kids who are biting their fingers (not<br/>
nails, fingers!) down to bleeding (at 5!!).  Homeschooling takes a ton of<br/>
energy, but at least I see that we are all HAPPY and HEALTHY and WHOLE at<br/>
the end of the exhausting day.  Sweet payoff, IMO. :-)<br/>

I don&#39;t recall the &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment of realizing Drew could read, but we used<br/>
one of those Magna Doodles to communicate with him for a long time and it<br/>
was awesome.  Although he understood spoken words, SEEING them was much more<br/>
effective, so we wrote down a lot of instructions, i.e. &quot;put on shoes&quot; or<br/>
&quot;leaving for the store&quot;, etc.  When it was verbal the words didn&#39;t stick as<br/>
well for him, as opposed to them being seen.  Once we started signing to<br/>
him, that also helped because it is another form of visual language.  I<br/>
occaisionally still use sign with him now if he is having an especially<br/>
unfocused moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I understand the head banging, Drew used to do that also to the point where<br/>
he would bleed.  Ouch.  It sounds like both kiddos are having sensory<br/>
overload and just don&#39;t have a healthy way of expressing it.  I would guess<br/>
(just a guess since I don&#39;t know them nor have I seen their school<br/>
environments) that stress is playing a big part in the overload issues.<br/>
Once Drew was brought home and could just BE, many of his stims (head<br/>
banging, nail bitting, head shaking) slowly went away.  He has always<br/>
enjoyed oral stimulation, so we&#39;ve kept a supply of chewy tubes<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chewytubes.com/chewytubes/chewytubes.php)">http://www.chewytubes.com/chewytubes/chewytubes.php)</a> around for him to chew<br/>
on when he&#39;s stressed or feeling overloaded.  We do a lot of swinging,<br/>
rocking, deep pressure, used to do a lot of brushing with a sensory brush,<br/>
etc.  As he has matured, he doesn&#39;t need as much of this input, or he does<br/>
for himself in those areas.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;experts&quot; want us to believe that school and formal therapy is the #1<br/>
best place for our kids to be, but I disagree.  Home is a wonderful,<br/>
healthy, stress-free place for autie kids and they thrive there.  It does<br/>
take a large amount of energy and creative thinking to make it work, but IMO<br/>
it is SO much better than the insanity we dealt with in the school system.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

Thank you so much for your insight. My niece rocks herself violently, she<br/>
cracks her head on the floor. My nephew is a bitter, he doesn&#39;t bite himself<br/>
only others. I also believe that they don&#39;t need to be &quot;fixed&quot;, they are<br/>
perfect. They live with us, which might make unschooling them easier. One<br/>
question I have for you is, how did you know he was reading before he<br/>
started talking? I ask this because my niece has always had a fascination of<br/>
books. She will come into the house grab an encyclopedia and start &quot;reading&quot;<br/>
it. My nephew has recently started opening books and &quot;speaking&quot; out loud as<br/>
he looks at them. He just started doing this last week. Thanks for your help<br/>
it is really appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
For the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>

that&#39;s how it goes with him. <br/>
<br/>

involved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL. Which I never have agreed<br/>
with. Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>
to fix him. He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different. That attitude switch<br/>
(when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
I laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>
Autistic!? I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot; I tell them<br/>
that I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>
system who doesn&#39;t value my kids for Who They Are. IEP meetings, notes from<br/>
the teacher every day, stressed out kids who are biting their fingers (not<br/>
nails, fingers!) down to bleeding (at 5!!). Homeschooling takes a ton of<br/>
energy, but at least I see that we are all HAPPY and HEALTHY and WHOLE at<br/>
the end of the exhausting day. Sweet payoff, IMO. :-)<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism<br/>
<br/>
Hi All,<br/>
I have a question for those of you who unschool children with Autism. My SIL<br/>
is thinking of pulling her daughter Faith(5) from school to homeschool her.<br/>
Right now her and her brotherEdward (3), both diagnosed, go to a school set<br/>
up for children with &quot;special needs&quot;. They go to school and therapy 5 days a<br/>
week and have improved a lot. Sam is concerned that they will push Faith<br/>
through to Kindergarten even though she is not ready. You also have to<br/>
understand that both kids are non-verbal and do very little sign language.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t communicate to us what they want, they<br/>
just do it differently. Sam is concerned that Faith and Edward won&#39;t get the<br/>
community based services that they need, and is worried that she won&#39;t be<br/>
able to help Faith improve. Understandably, Sam wants her kids to be able to<br/>
lead as &quot;normal&quot; a life as possible and has fought to get all of the<br/>
services that they have now. Sam is naturally not an organized/schedule type<br/>
person and has been doing her very best to keep to a schedule for both of<br/>
her kids. When Faith&#39;s routine gets disrupted she gets very aggitated,<br/>
Edward usually just goes with it. So, do any of you unschool your children<br/>
who are non-verbal and have Autism and Sensory Integration Issues? If you<br/>
do, can you please give me an insight to your day. I&#39;m sure this would help<br/>
ease my SIL&#39;s mind and help her to decide if this is the right choice for<br/>
her and her family.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Susie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386855883">Thank you so much.  If you would rather reply offlist that would be great, either way works for me :0).  I&#39;m just trying to ease my SIL&#39;s mind, they are on the go everyday from 7am-4:30pm when they get home from therapy.  Faith and Edward have both been in school since they were 1.5, that just seems like so much time away from their Mom.  Not to mention how mentally and physically draining it is on all 3 of them.  <br/>

Thank you so much for your insight.  My niece rocks herself violently, she cracks her head on the floor.  My nephew is a bitter, he doesn&#39;t bite himself only others.  I also believe that they don&#39;t need to be &quot;fixed&quot;, they are perfect.  They live with us, which might make unschooling them easier.  One question I have for you is, how did you know he was reading before he started talking?  I ask this because my niece has always had a fascination of books.  She will come into the house grab an encyclopedia and start &quot;reading&quot; it.  My nephew has recently started opening books and &quot;speaking&quot; out loud as he looks at them.  He just started doing this last week.  Thanks for your help it is really appreciated.<br/>

  My eldest son Drew, who is now 8.5, is Autistic. Although he is now very<br/>
  verbal, he didn&#39;t get the hang of spoken language until around 3-3.5 years.<br/>
  We used a great deal of sign language with him, as well as written language<br/>
  (he was able to read by 2, which made communication easier for sure!). Drew<br/>
  was enrolled in public school for preschool, which was a special education<br/>
  program specifically for Autistic kids. Although I had planned to<br/>
  homeschool in some form, and had made that choice long before the children<br/>
  were born, I felt that the services he received via the district (for free)<br/>
  were needful, so we went that route. As it turns out, the preschool<br/>
  environment was fantastic, he much enjoyed it and the adults involved were<br/>
  all very loving and tuned in to the kiddos there. Just as your sister<br/>
  fears, however, he was &quot;pushed through&quot; to Kindergarten at 5 and he was<br/>
  *not* ready. In hindsight, I should have brought him home at that point.<br/>
  Instead I allowed them to enroll him in a special ed K class. What a<br/>
  disaster! It was partly that he wasn&#39;t ready, partly the horrible school he<br/>
  was in (different from the preK school). We stuck it out (mostly because of<br/>
  DH&#39;s not being ready to embrace homeschooling) until March, when a situation<br/>
  dangerous to Drew finally woke me fully and I brought him home. <br/>
<br/>
  For the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>
  routine, which he seemed to need. Looking back, I think that was because in<br/>
  his preK class *they* had a very strict routine for the kids. Coupled with<br/>
  most Autie&#39;s needs to have zero surprises in their life, this had reallly<br/>
  conditioned Drew to expect rigid regularity. As it turns out, we did not<br/>
  have a rigid home life outside of his school experience, and he did okay<br/>
  with that, so not sure what I was thinking! Anyway, we used a strict<br/>
  curriculum for 1st and 2nd grade, although by 2nd we were already falling<br/>
  off the boat, so to speak. I realized that Drew could roll with the punches<br/>
  much more and truly enjoyed being in charge of his own time. He does need a<br/>
  lot of help to get in touch with his mental and emotional state in order to<br/>
  change tracks, even when he wants to in order to do something wonderful<br/>
  (like leaving a video game in order to go to Disneyland for the day), but<br/>
  that&#39;s how it goes with him. <br/>
<br/>
  As far as services, Drew was receiving scanty services by K, and I honestly<br/>
  did most of the work with him at home during the course of our regular day,<br/>
  so we didn&#39;t miss the &quot;formal&quot; ones when they were gone. I *really* don&#39;t<br/>
  miss the ABA therapy - I always felt that one was like training a dog, it<br/>
  gives me the creeps! I do think these kids need help to adjust within our<br/>
  world, but looking back at so many of the therapies Drew had, they were very<br/>
  involved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL. Which I never have agreed<br/>
  with. Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>
  to fix him. He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different. That attitude switch<br/>
  (when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>
  son.<br/>
<br/>
  I laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>
  Autistic!? I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot; I tell them<br/>
  that I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159145153">IDEA (Individuals with disabilities education act) states that the <br/>
school district must provide services to all children residing in <br/>
their district (or attending private school in their district).  This <br/>
applies to both public and private schooled children (In most states, <br/>
homeschool is considered private school).  Some school districts will <br/>
try to deny this, while others are actively seeking out homeschooled <br/>
children who need services.  Troup County in GA is one of the <br/>
counties that is actively seeking children.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, if one feels a child needs services, and the child <br/>
has a documented disability, the district must provide the services.  <br/>
How cooperative they are varies.<br/>
<br/>
By our own choice, our son stopped receiving services (speech and OT) <br/>
when we withdrew him.  Most of his stimming disappeared when we <br/>
withdrew him.  Apparently the stress of the school environment was <br/>
causing the problem.  Also, I am able to contol his sensory diet - No <br/>
flourescent lights, no noisy classroom, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I can also address his language needs more efficiently now.  He has <br/>
been verbal since about 3 yrs (he&#39;s 7 now), but he has word recall <br/>
problems.  After several months of work, he is finally able to recall <br/>
that his bendy part is called an elbow.  Because I am here and paying <br/>
attention, I can supply the words he can&#39;t recall.  In order to do <br/>
this I have to have a conversation with him or listen to the <br/>
conversations he has with others.  This is something that his <br/>
teachers and therapists (and he had really great ones) just couldn&#39;t <br/>
do enough of in a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to stress that my boy does not need to be fixed.  HE IS <br/>
NOT BROKEN.  My job is simply to provide him with the information he <br/>
needs to make sense of his world, and to be mindful and observant of <br/>
those times when he is not able to cope with his environment, so that <br/>
he can live a happy and full life.  Which, coincidentally, is the <br/>
same thing I do for my two &quot;typical&quot; children.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to add, I recently allowed my 7yo Aspie to go to the <br/>
local library under the supervision of of his older brother, thanks <br/>
to encouragement from Kelly Lovejoy.  I was worried he might have a <br/>
meltdown, and I wouldn&#39;t be there.  She pointed out that I was only a <br/>
phone call away.  The boys went and the there were no problems.  <br/>
Thanks Kelly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013193223">Actually, under the law, to be considered for homebound services, one  <br/>
must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the school cannot provide an  <br/>
appropriate placement setting for the child. Homeschooling is not  <br/>
covered by IDEA.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done, and as you say, some schools jump all over it because  <br/>
it means that they can still get full funding for the child, while  <br/>
not having to pay for most services that would be required for a  <br/>
seven hour day.  Many schools will let you take it to due process,  <br/>
however, which is a long and time consuming. If you can show that  <br/>
they are not making progress at school, pull them out, provide  <br/>
private therapy, you could go to due process for reimbursement.<br/>
<br/>
As Tina said, school environment is most of the problem. You&#39;ll also  <br/>
find that 1) schools do not provide enough services as it is and that  <br/>
2) most of the therapists are not well trained and the therapy is  <br/>
either minimally helpful or sometimes even damaging. That was  <br/>
certainly our case. My oldest son had severe issues in the classroom,  <br/>
that the school would not address. We finally got it placed into an  <br/>
IEP and then, the school didn&#39;t follow it. My daughter, who is  <br/>
severely autistic, had been in school since three (receiving services  <br/>
since two) The therapists did not know how to teach a child. Most of  <br/>
the time she would get maybe three hours of therapy a week. Most of  <br/>
that time was spent following a cookie cutter program that is not  <br/>
functional for autistic children. Usually about February they&#39;d  <br/>
figure that out and just be stumped.<br/>
<br/>
Preschool programs often appear beneficial to those with  <br/>
disabilities. However, once the child ages out of the program, it&#39;s  <br/>
even more difficult to find appropriate services (because in  <br/>
preschool it&#39;s built into the program, older grades it is a pull-out  <br/>
program) We had an excellent kindergarden year, because I had  <br/>
designed a program from scratch and the school followed it. The  <br/>
teacher was excellent and we had a one-on-one aid. Without all of  <br/>
that, it would have been a disaster. As it was in first grade! We  <br/>
still had the aid, but she wasn&#39;t trained. The teacher was out of  <br/>
control. The students were out of control. The school districts psych  <br/>
fought with me all year about the fine line between appropriate  <br/>
services and creating a crutch.<br/>

<br/>
  IDEA (Individuals with disabilities education act) states that the <br/>
  school district must provide services to all children residing in <br/>
  their district (or attending private school in their district). This <br/>
  applies to both public and private schooled children (In most states, <br/>
  homeschool is considered private school). Some school districts will <br/>
  try to deny this, while others are actively seeking out homeschooled <br/>
  children who need services. Troup County in GA is one of the <br/>
  counties that is actively seeking children.<br/>
<br/>
  That being said, if one feels a child needs services, and the child <br/>
  has a documented disability, the district must provide the services. <br/>
  How cooperative they are varies.<br/>
<br/>
  By our own choice, our son stopped receiving services (speech and OT) <br/>
  when we withdrew him. Most of his stimming disappeared when we <br/>
  withdrew him. Apparently the stress of the school environment was <br/>
  causing the problem. Also, I am able to contol his sensory diet - No <br/>
  flourescent lights, no noisy classroom, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  I can also address his language needs more efficiently now. He has <br/>
  been verbal since about 3 yrs (he&#39;s 7 now), but he has word recall <br/>
  problems. After several months of work, he is finally able to recall <br/>
  that his bendy part is called an elbow. Because I am here and paying <br/>
  attention, I can supply the words he can&#39;t recall. In order to do <br/>
  this I have to have a conversation with him or listen to the <br/>
  conversations he has with others. This is something that his <br/>
  teachers and therapists (and he had really great ones) just couldn&#39;t <br/>
  do enough of in a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
  I also want to stress that my boy does not need to be fixed. HE IS <br/>
  NOT BROKEN. My job is simply to provide him with the information he <br/>
  needs to make sense of his world, and to be mindful and observant of <br/>
  those times when he is not able to cope with his environment, so that <br/>
  he can live a happy and full life. Which, coincidentally, is the <br/>
  same thing I do for my two &quot;typical&quot; children.<br/>
<br/>
  I also have to add, I recently allowed my 7yo Aspie to go to the <br/>
  local library under the supervision of of his older brother, thanks <br/>
  to encouragement from Kelly Lovejoy. I was worried he might have a <br/>
  meltdown, and I wouldn&#39;t be there. She pointed out that I was only a <br/>
  phone call away. The boys went and the there were no problems. <br/>
  Thanks Kelly.<br/>

  Actually, under the law, to be considered for homebound services, one <br/>
  must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the school cannot provide an <br/>
  appropriate placement setting for the child. Homeschooling is not <br/>
  covered by IDEA.<br/>
<br/>
  It can be done, and as you say, some schools jump all over it because <br/>
  it means that they can still get full funding for the child, while <br/>
  not having to pay for most services that would be required for a <br/>
  seven hour day. Many schools will let you take it to due process, <br/>
  however, which is a long and time consuming. If you can show that <br/>
  they are not making progress at school, pull them out, provide <br/>
  private therapy, you could go to due process for reimbursement.<br/>
<br/>
  As Tina said, school environment is most of the problem. You&#39;ll also <br/>
  find that 1) schools do not provide enough services as it is and that <br/>
  2) most of the therapists are not well trained and the therapy is <br/>
  either minimally helpful or sometimes even damaging. That was <br/>
  certainly our case. My oldest son had severe issues in the classroom, <br/>
  that the school would not address. We finally got it placed into an <br/>
  IEP and then, the school didn&#39;t follow it. My daughter, who is <br/>
  severely autistic, had been in school since three (receiving services <br/>
  since two) The therapists did not know how to teach a child. Most of <br/>
  the time she would get maybe three hours of therapy a week. Most of <br/>
  that time was spent following a cookie cutter program that is not <br/>
  functional for autistic children. Usually about February they&#39;d <br/>
  figure that out and just be stumped.<br/>
<br/>
  Preschool programs often appear beneficial to those with <br/>
  disabilities. However, once the child ages out of the program, it&#39;s <br/>
  even more difficult to find appropriate services (because in <br/>
  preschool it&#39;s built into the program, older grades it is a pull-out <br/>
  program) We had an excellent kindergarden year, because I had <br/>
  designed a program from scratch and the school followed it. The <br/>
  teacher was excellent and we had a one-on-one aid. Without all of <br/>
  that, it would have been a disaster. As it was in first grade! We <br/>
  still had the aid, but she wasn&#39;t trained. The teacher was out of <br/>
  control. The students were out of control. The school districts psych <br/>
  fought with me all year about the fine line between appropriate <br/>
  services and creating a crutch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620138612">Good website.. <br/>
www.dotolearn.com<br/>
We used this site alot in preparing our son for <br/>
unschooling/homeschool. He is now very happy and loving the <br/>
unschooling &quot;routine&quot;.. LOL<br/>
He has tought himself to read and loves math. He is also very good <br/>
with other kids now,, as long as it is on his terms. <br/>
He was in the system for a while and he did great in pre-school then <br/>
when K came about it was terrible. He came home with a black eye one <br/>
time and then with ring worm that was it for me. I pulled him out. He <br/>
was verbal at this point. He became verbal again at about 4yrs old. <br/>
He lost all language at 18mo. old. He has a comorbid diagnosis, <br/>
autism with sensory integration, OCD and some anger issues possible <br/>
bi-polar.   He has a younger bro. that is very demanding and they <br/>
work well together. He has been diagnosed with the onset of childhood <br/>
bi-polar. <br/>
Unschooling works for us for now. Who knows what tomorrow will bring <br/>
but our philosophy is one day at a time. I just do not think that the <br/>
school and ever give him what he needs and that is some creativity <br/>
with learning. <br/>
We did do some deschooling though for a while. I had to let him let <br/>
go of the schedule idea. He became to obsessed with it. So that took <br/>
some time. You just can not be so worried about what they are <br/>
supposed to know and just let them learn. Have fun with it let them <br/>
lead the way with a bit of help. It may take some time to find out <br/>
what makes him want to be engaged in learning but do not rush it or <br/>
they will back off even further.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
