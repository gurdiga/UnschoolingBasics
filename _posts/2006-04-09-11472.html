None.  <br/>

know.  I have a very good friend who is just starting a &quot;summerhillish&quot;<br/>
school in Ft. Langley.  I believe that Ft. Langley is fairly close to<br/>
Vancouver.  My friend is an unschooler as is highlighted in one of the<br/>
unschooling books (maybe the US Handbook).  She raised all three of her<br/>
daughters unschooled. So her little &quot;unschool&quot; will be quite unschooly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364735709">Hi-We unschool near Golden BC. Canada. We live out in the boonies and  <br/>
in the middle of our 5th season here (mud season)<br/>
The girls had friends over and  the washer is churning away with a <br/>
load of wet,dirty clothes-but the trampoline went up this <br/>
afternoon...the first  ballon water bomb session of the year....<br/>
Our girls are almost 11. <br/>
Where are you?<br/>
I am behind a bit on messages.<br/>

So, if you&#39;re 4 1/2 hours from Fort Langley - are you in Kelowna?  <br/>
Nice to see some other BC&#39;ers here!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is a bit of a drive LOL!  Summerhill was/is (is it still going on?) an<br/>
experimental school that was very unschoolish.  They allowed children the<br/>
freedom to study what and when they wanted.  Almost all of the students who<br/>
went through this school were confidant, indpendent thinkers.  I don&#39;t agree<br/>
with all of the thoughts from author (there is a book titled Summerhill),<br/>
especially when it concerns sexuality and sexual identity.  There are a few<br/>
other things that I believe he based his opinion on through this small<br/>
demographic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465377203">Hi Cheryl, actually, I&#39;m closer than Langley.  I&#39;m in Salmon Arm.  <br/>
Yeah, it IS nice to see other fairly close by unschoolers. Somehow I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to find many right here, but I&#39;m sure going to <br/>
keep looking!  <br/>
