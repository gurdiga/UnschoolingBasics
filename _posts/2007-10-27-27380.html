<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000844493">I know that I have had, and probably still have, misconceptions about unschooling.  I think I have a need to talk about one of these. I need some clarity, and, I hate to admit it, maybe some comfort. I am not tempted to stop unschooling/deschooling.  Just need to talk and if possible get some thoughts from others. <br/>
  For a long time, before we started unschooling and for several months after we began, I thought that the basic idea of unschooling was that when left to their own interests, kids will, over some years&#39; time, absorb how to do quite a bit of math, explore literature, history, social trends,  you-name-it.

So I am not too much tempted to look at my kids behavior and feel concerned; we are still deschooling. So, what is the problem?<br/>
   I have finally absorbed that RU doesn&#39;t mean that they will spontaneously learn some specific body of knowlege as kids.  It seems to mean that they will learn to keep their joy and confidence alive, so that when they want to learn or do something they&#39;ll embrace and do it.  And it may not be anything I could have ever imagined!  <br/>
   While part of me just loves that, another part is saying, yes...but...and just getting jitters that while I am trying to help them live with joy and possibility that I will really end up limiting them.<br/>
Now, I am aware this isn&#39;t rational.  Try as hard as I may to be entirely rational about my kids, it can be hard. <br/>
  A further confusing note: my 13 yo ds has asked me if I could &quot;push him through&quot; several years&#39; curriculum so he could be &quot;really ahead&quot; and then go to school.  This is a young man who has always done everything at his own pace. Turns out he wants to think about going to school for several reasons:  to show himself he really can be an academic whiz,  to see how he fits in to the school culture, and to make more friends. I am looking for more ways to find friends but I think there is a self-confidence issue here, too. A fear that he couldn&#39;t hack it in school (in his mind). <br/>
    Well, this is all very confusing.  I don&#39;t want to let him down if he really wants to zoom through  several years of curriculum, but all our previous efforts at standardized curricula fizzled in days.  I think I&#39;d be more  likely to become a master tap dancer overnight than be able to cajole him through that. Of course it&#39;s that body of supposedly useful knowlege...or at least the ticket-punch Gatto refers to.  <br/>
    So here I am, deschooling.  Trying to let go of all my expectations, all my labels of what people need to learn in chilhood to be free adults. Maybe really this sudden rquest to be pushed through several years&#39; curricula is even part of my 13 yo son&#39;s deschooling, like &quot;Oops, what if I really should have learned all that stuff!&quot;   Any thoughts on this ramble?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129848451">Hi,<br/>
when I was about your sons age (14 I think) I made the<br/>
decision to switch school from the non-graded rather<br/>
free waldorf school I was on and quite happy at too<br/>
(in a different town)  to a public school in my town.<br/>
The main reason which I only admitted to myself was to<br/>
see if I was not as smart as others  (as some public<br/>
schooled kids in the neighborhood had indicated<br/>
because I had no grades...). I wanted to prove<br/>
something to myself and unfortunately dragged my<br/>
brother through with me who switched because of me and<br/>
had the worst time. <br/>
And yet, a lot of good came from it, and at least it<br/>
was my decision. In hindsight and comparison I learned<br/>
mostly that kids can be really mean etc.<br/>
I would have loved the chance to just be able to look<br/>
at what they were doing without any pressure. What if<br/>
you just show your child all that the public schooled<br/>
kids are doing, even getting him textbooks etc. to<br/>
work through on his own. He might have fun comparing<br/>
himself (or whizzing  through a lot of math in a short<br/>
time for example), without having to take the other<br/>
crap -<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658904040">Hi again,<br/>
I was talking to another unschooling friends the other<br/>
day who&#39;s son started watching one of those shows and<br/>
we were talking about how unrealistic they are - <br/>
I believe if you talk to your local school about<br/>
having your son come in and visit one day - or<br/>
possibly sit in on a class of his choice, that should<br/>
be possible, to quell his curiousity. Our school<br/>
district has told me that my sons can take classes in<br/>
the public school if they like without having to be<br/>
&#39;in&#39; it. My older one has acted in a play at the local<br/>
high school, that was it though for envolvement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025667837">It sounds like there is lots of confusion, both on your part and your <br/>
son&#39;s.   To get some clarity you might try a game of pretend.  Pick <br/>
your favorite unschooling mom off one of the lists or maybe someone <br/>
off-list that you know and respect.  Imagine that you are her and <br/>
your son is just your son.  How would this experienced unschooling <br/>
mom react?  You might try several people and imagine their <br/>
responses.  This may allow you to separate your own doubts and fears <br/>
from your sons.<br/>
<br/>
This is how I would imagine my most respected unschooling mom:<br/>
<br/>
She would probably not be fearful of her son&#39;s process and would not <br/>
confuse his anxieties with her own (if any).  She would most likely <br/>
be excited that her son is doing lots of thinking on the topic and <br/>
exploring his options.  She would be eager to explore right along <br/>
side of him to see how she might be of help.  If her son asks, &quot;push <br/>
me through&quot; several years&#39; curriculum.  She would welcome his <br/>
invitation without fear. She might ask him questions for him to <br/>
answer so he might get a deeper understanding of his needs and <br/>
wishes.  Here are some examples of a question she might ask.  &quot;You <br/>
need me to _push_ you through?  Is that true?&quot;   &quot;When you imagine me <br/>
pushing you, how does it make you feel?&quot;  &quot;Does it make you feel <br/>
joyful?  Stressed?  Happy?&quot;  In other words, help would come without <br/>
fear of the outcome and would still allow him to proceed to find the <br/>
best solution for _him_.  She might make suggestions herself, being <br/>
mindful that they are not colored by her own preferences. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Turns out he wants to think about going to school for several <br/>
 </span></blockquote>reasons: to show<br/>
himself he really can be an academic whiz, to see how he fits in to <br/>
the school<br/>
culture, and to make more friends. I am looking for more ways to find <br/>
friends<br/>
but I think there is a self-confidence issue here, too. A fear that <br/>
he couldn&#39;t<br/>
hack it in school (in his mind).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me talking now.  Perhaps it&#39;s a good time to brainstorm and <br/>
try finding as many ways as possible for your son to gain confidence <br/>
in him self.  His lens may be too narrow right now to see that there <br/>
are many other ways to feel competent, confident and successful <br/>
within his areas of interest.   One of those ways is probably not <br/>
getting `pushed&#39;.  His belief that he needs to be pushed leads me to <br/>
suspect that he is still emerging from a school paradigm.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if you are feeling shaky about all this unschooling stuff, you <br/>
can still facilitate his journey.  The best way I have found when I <br/>
get shaky is to pretend, if even for a moment, that I have no fear <br/>
and no doubts.  It invariably gives me a different perspective on the <br/>
problem and allows me to see things clearer.<br/>

My 7 year old and I had a discussion about this same thing this past<br/>
summer.  She asked me if when the time came she could go t middle school and<br/>
her idea of what it would be like was coming from Ned&#39;s Declassified and<br/>
Zoey 101.  I tried to talk to her about what middle school was really like<br/>
and what it was like for me and she said &quot;so you won&#39;t let me go to middle<br/>
school because YOU hated it???&quot;.  I laughed and told her she was right and<br/>
we would have to see where we were when she got old enough to attend middle<br/>
school and would re-evaluate things then.  I really like the idea of having<br/>
them visit the school.<br/>
