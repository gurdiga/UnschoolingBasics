<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906326763">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I heard the sad news that Ned Vare has died. He<br/>
and his wife are so committed to sharing the joy of unschooling that<br/>
long after their son was off on his own, they still opened up their<br/>
home to fellow unschoolers as a gathering space/place. Going to their<br/>
home was like attending a mini conference every other month! I have<br/>
such gratitude for having had known him.<br/>
While I will need a little<br/>
time to express my sadness more fully in his passing, I am passing<br/>
along the kind words that were written by someone who knew him well.<br/>
My sincerest condolences go out to his family. <br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
<br/>

In Memoriam<br/>
<br/>
It is with great sadness that we inform our supporters that a great friend<br/>
and homeschool freedom champion, Ned Vare, has died.   Ned was a fearless<br/>
fighter for educational freedom.  I first met him in 1990 when he was in the<br/>
forefront of the effort to defeat government regulation of homeschooling in<br/>
Connecticut.  He was wise to all the background, history, and rationale<br/>
behind public schooling and homeschooling.  Over the years, he not only<br/>
educated me on the ways of the educational world, but educated untold<br/>
others.  He and his soulmate, Luz Shosie, met in 1973 at Ned&#39;s ranch in<br/>
Silt, Colorado.  Together they raised their son, Cassidy, without schooling,<br/>
with what is now called Unschooling.  In essence, they wisely guided Cassidy<br/>
in educating himself, an experiment, they say,<br/>
 that surpassed all of their<br/>
expectations. Ned and Luz were inspired by the writings of John Holt, and<br/>
together, they started a support group for unschoolers and operated the<br/>
Unschoolers Unlimited &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/</a>&gt;  Newsletter for<br/>
many years.  More recently Ned penned a blog entitled, &quot;School Is Hell<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://school-is-hell.blogspot.com/">http://school-is-hell.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; &quot;. Ned could always be seen supporting<br/>
the right to educate in freedom at every gathering across the state, from<br/>
his hometown in Guilford to Hartford and beyond. Ned was never afraid to<br/>
confront any government official whom he believed was acting in any way to<br/>
deny parents their rights.  Ned was tireless in his ability to engage<br/>
legislators in quiet, polite, but persistent conversation educating them as<br/>
to the<br/>
 rights of parents and why they should support educational freedom.<br/>
Ned was extremely successful at this endeavor and was instrumental in<br/>
persuading many key legislators to support the rights of parents in<br/>
Connecticut.  We are also fortunate that Ned, with Luz, wrote his thoughts<br/>
about educational freedom in a book that I proudly keep in a most prominent<br/>
place in my home.  It&#39;s called &quot;Smarting Us Up, the Un Dumbing of America&quot;.<br/>
Ned was a true inspiration, who had a keen wit, a most engaging personality,<br/>
and always the nicest smile.  I was proud to call Ned my friend, and he will<br/>
be sorely missed.  A memorial service is planned for him at a date to be<br/>
announced in the fall.<br/>
