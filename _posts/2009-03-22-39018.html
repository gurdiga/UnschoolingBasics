<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072416193">HI Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name&#39;s Michelle, I&#39;m originally from Ohio, but I&#39;ve been living in England for almost 7 years. We&#39;ve been homeschooling ds5 for nearly a year now. My first exposure to homeschooling methods was through The Well-Trained Mind. I really liked it, but wanted to see what else was out there. I&#39;ve explored many methods and have learned a lot. When I first learned about unschooling, I was like most of the doubters out there, but after I had a better look and read some of Mr. Holt&#39;s fantastic work, I was pretty much convinced. But then I&#39;d gaze once more of my copy of TWTM and think, &#39;yeah, but...&#39; I could fill in a lot things in that blank. :)<br/>
<br/>
For the past few months we&#39;ve been working on reading (at his request), handwriting (he loves it), art (reading stories that feature a colour, then total creative freedom), hands-on math activities (he loves this, too), and skills such as learning his address, phone number, etc. I also read to him for an hour to 2 hours each day, which are the best parts of the day (this is not scheduled, but a lovely routine) He really enjoys all of this, but I feel like I&#39;m a slave to that lesson plans sheet. It takes me hours to create it as well. And we never deviate from it; if it&#39;s not on the list, we don&#39;t do it. By the time we&#39;re done with all of the planned activites (about an hours&#39; worth), I need a break! So we&#39;re not playing many games, doing puzzles, getting out some of the great activity books we have etc. I&#39;ve been feeling like I need to plan for that as well. I&#39;m on the road to burnout and we&#39;ve only just begun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of all of this. We had a week off from &#39;school&#39; and my son did so many educational things and we both enjoyed ourselves so much more. The learning felt more real, more special, more relevant. It took up far more than an hour of the day, but it didn&#39;t feel like &#39;work&#39; and I didn&#39;t feel the need for a break. The lesson plans make it feel so contrived and as if it&#39;s something I&#39;m doing, rather than something he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been exploring unschooling once again. I&#39;ve recently finished<br/>
reading The Unschooling Handbook, and a friend gave me the link to Joyfully Rejoicing, which is how I found this group. <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re going to ditch the lesson plans and let learning happen. If anyone has any advice, I&#39;d love to hear it. And if anyone has switched from classical to unschooling, please share your experience. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94414895">Hi, Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to unschooling!  I&#39;ve mentioned your post to a friend who switched<br/>
from classical to unschooling so I&#39;ll let you know what she says. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess my advice for the moment is not to expect everything to look<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; .  Really, everything is educational, just not<br/>
schooly-looking.  Your son will search out what he needs.  Everything is a<br/>
resource-tv, movies, books, websites, blogs, trips, toys, woods, friends,<br/>
stores-everything.  Don&#39;t worry if he watches a ton of movies or tv or plays<br/>
a ton of video games, esp. in the near future.  He&#39;s getting what he needs<br/>
and is probably deschooling.  Have fun together and enjoy exploring life!<br/>
:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137037965">There is an unschooling conference going on in London this year. I&#39;ll be speaking as will Sandra Dodd and a few other people. There is a website: www.londonunschoolingconference.blogspot.com. It might help to see and hear people who&#39;ve been doing this for a while. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609860370">There was a month when Megan was about five that I was sure a loose lesson plan/daily guide thing would be good for us.  It wasn&#39;t.  It got in the way of all the cool stuff we&#39;d rather be doing.<br/>
<br/>
Megan&#39;s seven now.  Her big passion has always been animals.  Always.  I remember the first book she picked for herself was a basic fish book that had a picture of a fish skeleton with labels (fin, gills, etc).  It was her favorite book for months.  And that page in particular.  So that has grown in all sorts of ways (including different animal breeds, adding a rabbit to our family, dog shows, Pokemon, volunteering at a no-kill shelter, some mythology, animal rescue shows on tv, movies with talking animals, pretend care of animals and all sorts of creative make-believe animals).   We were even able to carve out time during our cross country move to see dolpins and wild cats in Las Vegas!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s branching out again (maybe) into horses.  She&#39;s been playing at a website called Bellasera and now she is interested in seeing what a real stable looks like.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sort of interested in cooking.  Usually she&#39;d just rather eat the result! :-)  But she is interested in decorating cakes.  So we watch cake challenge shows on Food network and we&#39;ve decorated a few for fun (small ones,, so she has several to do).  Right now she is sick with the flu, but we were planning a trip to a cake decorating store this week.<br/>
<br/>
So - the big list above is just a small, small segment of what Megan&#39;s interests are.  We would have missed out on so much if we&#39;d been tied to a lesson plan or anything like that. My neice is six and goes to school.  She already has no interest in doing anything that might be anything like learning on the weekends.  <br/>

Thanks for the advice. I&#39;ll be interested to see what your friend has to say. :) You can pass my email address on to her if you like. <br/>
<br/>
Schuyler, <br/>
Thanks for the info about the unschooling conference. I would love to go. We live several hours away from London, but we might be able to make it. I&#39;ve posted about it on my local group, as they&#39;re mostly unschoolers.<br/>
