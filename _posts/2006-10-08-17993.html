 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in Florida and freely unschool.  Florida has a little used<br/>
homeschool clause that allows parents to &quot;enroll&quot; their children in a<br/>
&quot;private&quot; school (called 600 schools) which act as an umbrella.  Under<br/>
the umbrella school I use I only need to turn in our &quot;attendance&quot;<br/>
every year.  That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m not required to test nor to have my<br/>
children&#39;s work evaluated each year.  The only downside that I have<br/>
seen to this is that my children are not *technically* homeschooling -<br/>
they are registered at a private school (roll eyes!)  so they cannot<br/>
participate in extracurricular activities (football or band) through<br/>
the school system nor take individual classes (say a language or arts<br/>
class).  This is total bogus because our being in a &quot;private school&quot;<br/>
does nothing one way or another to impact the financial structure of<br/>
the county school system.  It&#39;s just a way of punishing the students<br/>
who have a particular interest because their parents chose to<br/>
homeschool them using an alternative form.<br/>
