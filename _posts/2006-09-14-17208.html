<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025121303">Hi all!<br/>
  I&#39;m Dana, mom to 3 wonderful children. Katheryn is 4, Shaelyn is 3, and Logan is 13 months. I just found Sandra Dodd&#39;s website a few days ago, and think she&#39;s just wonderful. I am trying *hard* to use her advice in my own life. I have always wanted to homeschool my kids, even before I got pregnant with Kitty. Up until after Logan was born, I practiced AP. Then about 6 months ago, Sam (my hubby) decided the kids need bedtimes (even though they had always gone to sleep when they were tired) and imposed some rather strict rules. <br/>
  There&#39;s where my problem comes in. My husband thinks I&#39;m nuts. He&#39;s one of those &quot;Parents set rules, and children obey&quot; type of people. He feels the need to tell our kids no about almost everything, and to yell at them if they get the least bit loud. &quot;Supposed to&quot; is one of his favorite things to tell my kids. So....what do I do? LOL He admits this way is working (I told him the other day that I&#39;m NOT yelling at my kids anymore), but he adds &quot;for now, but if it changes....we&#39;ll have to go back to the other way.&quot; I missed this...this closeness and joy that my kids and I can share, but he just thinks I&#39;m crazy, and continues &quot;his way&quot; of doing things. AAH! I&#39;m so frustrated. Can anyone help?<br/>
   <br/>
  Glad to be here!<br/>

Hi Dana, welcome.  I&#39;m about to give some advise that I haven&#39;t taken  <br/>
myself. &lt;g&gt;   My DH goes through periods of the same  thing.  Right now, the young <br/>
guys that work for him are next to worthless,  and when he comes home no one <br/>
seems to pay attention to the orders he barks  around here.  So, he&#39;s very <br/>
concerned that our kids are going to grow up  unable to do anything like the people <br/>
that work for him.  I&#39;ve talked until  I&#39;m blue in the face and sometimes he <br/>
can see that our kids are at least no  worse than the others on the block who <br/>
are &quot;disciplined&quot;.  Every once in  awhile he can see that our kids actually do <br/>
follow more directions than  those other kids.  An example, we have an empty <br/>
lot near us and the owner  politely asked that the kids not play there because <br/>
of snakes and other  hazards.  I told my children and only once have they <br/>
gone over there again  in the last year, but the neighbor children I tell EVERY <br/>
DAY and sometimes more  than once a day.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I am considering purchasing the Unconditional Parenting DVD by  Alfie <br/>
Kohn.  I have the book, and I think it is one that appeals to the dad  point <br/>
of view.  I told my husband that Kohn is not a touchy-feely  unschooler, but a <br/>
educational reform writer and a business writer.  That he  can deal with!<br/>
 <br/>
The DVD is expensive enough at about thirty dollars to not rush  out and get <br/>
it (on his website _www.alfiekohn.com_ (http://www.alfiekohn.com) ) but I will <br/>
do so if I  need to.  My DH is in a more positive place right now, so I <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten  it yet.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also gotten on the Scott Noelle Daily Groove newsletter and I forward  <br/>
them to DH.  I don&#39;t know if he reads them, but he seems to be working at  <br/>
being a more mindful parent.  That is at _www.enjoyingparenting.com_ <br/>
(http://www.enjoyingparenting.com) <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to whomever recommended that a few weeks ago.  I&#39;m enjoying it  very <br/>
much!<br/>
 <br/>
I know how difficult it is Dana, people truly don&#39;t understand.  Our  <br/>
marriage counselor recently quit on us because she disagreed with my parenting  <br/>
style.  She thought that the &quot;kids ran the house&quot; and even my husband was  saying <br/>
&quot;no, I&#39;ve been in those houses, it&#39;s not like that&quot;.  <br/>

Will your husband read some articles or listen to some talks on the subject? Some experienced dads have been getting pretty vocal in their support of radical unschooling and it seems to mean a lot when it&#39;s one guy talking to another.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827299666">My husband has always been in agreement with me with &quot;unschooling&quot;.  He <br/>
claims he never knew there was a word for how he felt.<br/>
Then, earlier this week a woman came into the shop where he works with her 4 <br/>
or 5 year old son.  (My dh is an auto mechanic).  The boy wanted to go into <br/>
the garage, right up next to my husband and see everything he was doing.  <br/>
They could not let him in there- OSHA standards state no customers allowed <br/>
in work area.  The woman got really uptight and told my husband that they <br/>
don&#39;t believe in telling their children &quot;no&quot;.  He then said that she went on <br/>
a little about self directed learning, and used some of the words I use <br/>
(shows you how much men sometimes listen).<br/>
My dh, trying to maintain professionality, claimed &quot;Well, we believe in <br/>
sticking to OHSA standards for everyone&#39;s safety.&quot;<br/>
The woman was VERY upset, even long after the child forgot about it.  The <br/>
two of them spent the rest of the time with pretty much their faces pressed <br/>
up against the window trying to see, and my dh said it was wierd.<br/>
He came home and wanted to know... &quot;You aren&#39;t going to be like THAT are <br/>
you?&quot;<br/>
lol.<br/>
