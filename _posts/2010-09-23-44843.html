 </span></blockquote>Yes, that is something I&#39;ve been thinking about alot lately. I guess we&#39;ll have to have a family meeting about that. Eventhough the kids are still young they should have a say in planning for their future. I think our best bet is to put something away for the future if needed, and plan our other activities carefully. <br/>

<br/>
Also, especially if you don&#39;t have much money, look into what state programs you <br/>
might be eligible for.  Here in Washington state you can go to the first two <br/>
years of college for free if you are a junior or senior in high school--but <br/>
being unschoolers, WE decide when that is, up to the age of 21.  Because of that <br/>
my 18 yo daughter is this year a &quot;junior&quot; and taking college classes for free.  <br/>
I know other states have other programs--like free tuition for &quot;A&quot; average in <br/>
high school--but again, *you* write the transcript and can give whatever grade <br/>
you need ;)  It&#39;s all about working the system.<br/>

Hi Everyone, <br/>
Have any of you thought of saving money for the possbility of future university <br/>
or college education?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thought about it. Decided against it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We started putting $$ away for Cameron when he was a tot (maybe three?). I had a friend who had two daughters, ten and 12, <br/>
and I asked her about college funds. She said that they had put nothing away. She expected the girls to get scholarships and grants <br/>
(there are millions of dollars of untapped grant $$ that don&#39;t get used every year) to pay for college. She had them in a private school, <br/>
so college wasn&#39;t going be much more than their yearly tuition at high school. They went on scholarships and grants.<br/>
So since he was a baby, we&#39;ve put $150/month away for Cameron. It&#39;s up to $14,000 now. Duncan has less, but he&#39;s only 14. If either decides <br/>
to go to college, we&#39;ll be happy to help him, but we&#39;d expect to spend a lot of time researching grants and scholarships and not tap into <br/>
*that* money. We hope to use it as a gift of a down payment for their first house or to help open a business.<br/>
There are many, many ways to afford college without going into debt or spending all the savings on it. You just have to be clever!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452596452">We have money from my pay going to a 529 and my dad has also been<br/>
putting away money in 529 (or similar) plans for all of his grandkids.<br/>
The thing we like about the 529 is that, while it is earmarked for<br/>
education, it can be transferred. So, if DS decides he wants to use 25%<br/>
of it to go to electrician school, then DH can use the other 75% for<br/>
grad school or we can transfer it to a cousin who decides to go to med<br/>
school or whatever. The only catch is that it has to be a relative. Not<br/>
a big deal since DS has half a dozen cousins, most around his age, and<br/>
any of them (or me or DH) can use that money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050399134">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here,  but I just wanted to chime in on this subject, since this is part of what I do for a living.  <br/>
<br/>
The RESP rules are fairly flexible as far as what kinds of programs qualify for being able to take the money out.  Further, you can set it up as a family RESP, even if one child doesn&#39;t choose a post secondary route, another might choose that route, and be able to benefit.  <br/>
<br/>
Savings vehicles are very diverse, too as long as you stay away from those group RESP plans, which are inflexible and have horrendous penalties for early withdrawal, or changes to how much you contribute.  It can be something as low risk as a money market fund or GIC if that&#39;s your preference -  most banks do these, so you can ask at your bank or credit union.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are currently putting away for your children anyway, the additional 20% on the 2500/year that the government kicks in is very attractive, and if your income is under 75K net per year, then you can apply for an additional grant of 10% on the first $500 every year.  I think there&#39;s an additional grant available if you&#39;re in Alberta (I&#39;m in BC, so I&#39;m not 100% certain on that one).  As long as you&#39;re willing not to touch the money (the penalties for doing so are quite severe), then you might want to consider an RESP just so you can access the additional grant money and the growth on that money.  It can add up to quite a bit over time.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
