<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482233264">I forgot to mention in my last post, that I am the author of The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living without School. Thanks to those of you who<br/>
let me know I should have said that before!<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know, I asked unschooling parents to let me know if<br/>
they would enjoy writing a chapter about their unschooling lives for a<br/>
new book. I now have over forty people writing chapters, with room for<br/>
only a few more. I&#39;m delighted and amazed at how quickly the list grew.<br/>
<br/>
I have another request. I am looking for more writers, but this time I<br/>
want children who are being unschooled or young adults who were<br/>
unschooled, to each write a chapter for another book. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter, Laurie, will be writing the introduction for this book.<br/>
Laurie now has a column in Connections!, so you can see her writing<br/>
style and sense of humor. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for chapters from your children about being unschooled.<br/>
They can discuss their passion or passions, their love of being home,<br/>
how they like to spend their days, or anything else that they wish to<br/>
write about.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is very young and/or has no interest in typing, but<br/>
wants to say something about unschooling, please type it for them. Let<br/>
their voices be heard. Even if they only have a single statement to<br/>
make, I&#39;ll put it in the book as a quote by them. <br/>
<br/>
If they are dealing with negative issues about unschooling and they<br/>
wish to write about it, then I might decide to share their writing<br/>
with older unschoolers who would like to give them advice and/or<br/>
encouragement, or simply respond with how they handled the same issue.<br/>
The response would be printed with the original chapter. <br/>
<br/>
The deadline for submissions is September 30th. Have your child write<br/>
to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:valfitz@...">valfitz@...</a> to let me know they want to be on the list<br/>
of chapter writers. If you have questions, feel free to send me email. <br/>
<br/>
Authors of both books will receive a free copy of the book, with an<br/>
option to buy more copies at a 50% discount, if they&#39;re ordered and<br/>
paid for in advance. That way I can ship them all out at the same<br/>
time, on the day they arrive from the printer. There&#39;s something<br/>
magical about holding a book you&#39;ve participated in creating, and I<br/>
want all of you to experience that as soon as possible. <br/>
<br/>
Keep on writing! <br/>
<br/>
Love, Valerie<br/>
