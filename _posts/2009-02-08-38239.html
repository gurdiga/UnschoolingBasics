<div id="ygrps-yiv-522015036">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am hoping to find other single moms like my self to cohouse. As you <br/>
probalby know or imagine being a single parent can be challenging, but <br/>
single, working, and unschooling is even more challenging. I&#39;m sure <br/>
there are other single moms out there in the same situation and I would <br/>
love to find YOU. I am interested in cohousing with like minded people <br/>
for genuine mutual support and friendship. I live in the San Diego area <br/>
and would love to hear from others even if not in SD.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am a 34 year old single mother of a 5 year old boy. I am looking for <br/>
other single moms (at least one other single mom) with similar <br/>
interests to co-house with for genuine mutual support and friendship <br/>
for ourselves and our children. I currently live in San Diego CA, but I <br/>
am looking forward to relocating to Ithaca. My son and I are very easy <br/>
going people. My son is very sociable, thoughtful, baby lover, funny, <br/>
curious, and very charismatic. We follow a healthy diet, mostly whole <br/>
foods including dairy and white meat. I prefer having no TV or at least <br/>
no commercial TV, I am simple in every way, low tech, I am a clean, <br/>
organized, not religious but spiritual, I love cooking and time to <br/>
share with my son and friends.<br/>
These are some interest that I would love to share in our home:<br/>
Homeschooling/Unschooling<br/>
