<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991332851">&quot;They can pick and choose what they take away. But what&#39;s<br/>
presented will be helping people move towards unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly. This list was designed with a very clear purpose in mind.<br/>
There are certain things that interfere with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment is one such thing. When parents withhold, or threaten to<br/>
withhold things to attain a certain type of behavior, it does not help<br/>
unschooling blossom in the home.<br/>
Trust is essential.<br/>
If a child speaks or acts a certain way, unschooling is all about<br/>
trying to understand and be a partner to that child, not punishing<br/>
them or treating them as &quot;less than&quot;. Mirroring annoyance or trying to<br/>
control behaviors only leads to blockages in the relationship, which<br/>
does not help learning unfold well.<br/>
<br/>
The advice here is about how you don&#39;t need to control your child, but<br/>
be their partners. A child that has had major control, will probably<br/>
have a harder time transitioning into a partnership style<br/>
relationship, but the faster a parent treats them with respect and<br/>
dignity, the better things will be. <br/>
<br/>
Just stuff I&#39;ve been thinking about lately, and how very unimportant<br/>
most issues are that parents tend to make a big deal about. I&#39;m really<br/>
weary of certain issues right now.....hearing from a child that they<br/>
believe they deserved punishment because of their &quot;attitude&quot; breaks my<br/>
heart.<br/>
So that&#39;s where my thoughts are meandering today. Forgive me if it<br/>
seems OT.<br/>
