<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393707089">I just have to share this with people who I think would completely understand. This is our first year homeschooling. Well today after Park Day with our little local group my daughter and I took a quick stop at the local art museum to check out a new exhibit and to ask about using their piano for lessons. I would teach my daughter. Well that won&#39;t fly with them but that&#39;s ok we will find another way to get her piano lessons. Anyway, on the drive home my daughter began to divulge little girlie secrets, something she hasn&#39;t done in ages. Then she let the big bomb drop, she loves homeschooling! Especially since we have gone full swing into unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t say we are radical unschoolers but we are working towards that end, a lot of things to change for us so a little at a time and it is all falling into place. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe the child that was begging to go back to PS this coming fall looked at me and asked if she could just stay a homeschooler. I couldn&#39;t believe how much trust she was placing in me once again. It felt so good, she even voluntarily shared this information with DH. The smile on his face was unbelievable. His little girl apparently entrusted him with some little secret as well which really made his day. We have a lot to change in our point of view as parents but we are working on it and apparently we have chosen the right path. I didn&#39;t ask her why or what changed her mind, I am guessing that will come along the way some where. But she thanked us for pulling her from PS and for agreeing that we should just continue as we are. <br/>

   This is very cool to hear.  This last fall I gave into my boys pleas to go to school -- and in reflection I think that he sensed my &quot;fears&quot; and that of others around him -- however  since about mid - january he ask to stay home more and talks about homeschooling.  We are finishing up the school year and next year we will stay home.  <br/>
<br/>
You also sound so much like me in recognizing that as parents there is many patterns, thoughts and just plan ol&#39; stuff to get rid off in order to radically unschool.   I consider myself an unschooler yet it seems so &#39;hard&#39; when one of my children is in school.  I find myself so often falling into the &#39;control&#39; issues that I so badly want to eliminate.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for posting and I look forward to the time when my child says the same as your daughter...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887131634">You have given them the freedom to explore their options. We were going to do that with our daughter. You cannot learn if you are not happy in the environment. It sounds like he just needed to check the grass on the other side of the fence. <br/>
<br/>
I think part of her revelation came from a little girl she has been hanging out with. She thought they were going to be BFF&#39;s. However, she is finding her boring and is tired of being grilled by the little girl and her mother, the first I had heard of it. I know the mother the first time very proudly told me that her daughter had been in PS since the age of 3. Well, while we were out walking after dinner she decided she was going to grill momma. What do you do all day? How can you stand to be with your kids all day? I am very proud of my daughter having been in school since she was three years old. It lead to a very interesting conversation but lets say I don&#39;t think the offer to come over for coffee will be extended again. OH well..<br/>
<br/>
As for recognizing the need to change things in ourselves that is the first step and truly the hardest. The rest takes patience. DH and I have both acknowledged that we have a lot to change, but we are taking it one day at a time and trying not to be too controlling. It is a journey but one we are taking together as a family. <br/>

Have you thought of looking into an electric keyboard for piano? We got one free years ago and gave it away to another family when we got a regular piano - put out the word! Someone may have one languishing in an attic somewhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38957835">Is your child in school because they asked to be?  I&#39;m just curious.  My kids went to school this year as a result of my needing them to.  I was in a major clinical depression.  and since I got better, two of them came home (they&#39;d been asking to for a long time, but knew I needed to get better first).  Two of them decided that they like ps, and are staying for the rest of the year at least.  I still consider myself an unschooler.  My kids are choosing their education!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058591832">That&#39;s funny about the lady going for a walk with you... I find it almost appalling anymore how parents feel that there child is really going to miss out if their child isn&#39;t sent to pre-school at 3...  Geez I was there... put ian in head start (31/2 -4 years old) -- stopped (about a week later when I realized it was too hard on both of us).. than kindergarten -- stopped through half the year when unhappy (heck he was just turning 5)  soooo I needed to remember that.  However, I do see that I am so leaning on the other side of the fence now that I almost can&#39;t stand myself on the school end.  Even for myself -- I doubt that I take any more formal schooling /college ... who knows ... one breath at a time, right?<br/>

I just have to share this with people who I think would completely understand. This is our first year homeschooling. Well today after Park Day with our little local group my daughter and I took a quick stop at the local art museum to check out a new exhibit and to ask about using their piano for lessons. I would teach my daughter. Well that won&#39;t fly with them but that&#39;s ok we will find another way to get her piano lessons. Anyway, on the drive home my daughter began to divulge little girlie secrets, something she hasn&#39;t done in ages. Then she let the big bomb drop, she loves homeschooling! Especially since we have gone full swing into unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t say we are radical unschoolers but we are working towards that end, a lot of things to change for us so a little at a time and it is all falling into place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe the child that was begging to go back to PS this coming fall looked at me and asked if she could just stay a homeschooler. I couldn&#39;t believe how much trust she was placing in me once again. It felt so good, she even voluntarily shared this information with DH. The smile on his face was unbelievable. His little girl apparently entrusted him with some little secret as well which really made his day. We have a lot to change in our point of view as parents but we are working on it and apparently we have chosen the right path. I didn&#39;t ask her why or what changed her mind, I am guessing that will come along the way some where. But she thanked us for pulling her from PS and for agreeing that we should just continue as we are. <br/>

            That&#39;s funny about the lady going for a walk with you... I find it almost appalling anymore how parents feel that there child is really going to miss out if their child isn&#39;t sent to pre-school at 3...  Geez I was there... put ian in head start (31/2 -4 years old) -- stopped (about a week later when I realized it was too hard on both of us).. than kindergarten -- stopped through half the year when unhappy (heck he was just turning 5)  soooo I needed to remember that.  However, I do see that I am so leaning on the other side of the fence now that I almost can&#39;t stand myself on the school end.  Even for myself -- I doubt that I take any more formal schooling /college ... who knows ... one breath at a time, right?<br/>

You have given them the freedom to explore their options. We were going to do that with our daughter. You cannot learn if you are not happy in the environment. It sounds like he just needed to check the grass on the other side of the fence. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think part of her revelation came from a little girl she has been hanging out with. She thought they were going to be BFF&#39;s. However, she is finding her boring and is tired of being grilled by the little girl and her mother, the first I had heard of it. I know the mother the first time very proudly told me that her daughter had been in PS since the age of 3. Well, while we were out walking after dinner she decided she was going to grill momma. What do you do all day? How can you stand to be with your kids all day? I am very proud of my daughter having been in school since she was three years old. It lead to a very interesting conversation but lets say I don&#39;t think the offer to come over for coffee will be extended again. OH well..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for recognizing the need to change things in ourselves that is the first step and truly the hardest. The rest takes patience. DH and I have both acknowledged that we have a lot to change, but we are taking it one day at a time and trying not to be too controlling. It is a journey but one we are taking together as a family. <br/>

This is very cool to hear.  This last fall I gave into my boys pleas to go to school -- and in reflection I think that he sensed my &quot;fears&quot; and that of others around him -- however  since about mid - january he ask to stay home more and talks about homeschooling.  We are finishing up the school year and next year we will stay home.  <br/>
<br/>

Thank you for posting and I look forward to the time when my child says the same as your daughter...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-261642167">I understand! I unschooled my son a portion of last school year but he wanted to go back this year! I&#39;ve learned so much from this group and use what I learn. I don&#39;t tell him to go to bed 90% of the time. He usually just gets up and goes when he feels the need. I don&#39;t force him to try new food and he chooses to. It&#39;s amazing. <br/>
