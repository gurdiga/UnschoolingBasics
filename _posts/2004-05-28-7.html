<div id="ygrps-yiv-701031497">Maybe those that wish could do a brief introduction...for the benefit <br/>
of those that aren&#39;t familiar with everyone here. We&#39;re a small list <br/>
right now, so it should be easy enough. Introductions won&#39;t be a big <br/>
deal if the list gets bigger, we&#39;ll get to know people through <br/>
regular postings.<br/>
<br/>
So for those that don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m Ren, a regular rabble rouser at <br/>
unschooling.com and a couple email lists. I&#39;ve been homeschooling <br/>
(relaxed/eclectic earlier on) since 1996 and unschooling since 2000, <br/>
radically since 2001. :)<br/>
I have four amazing children ages 14, 10, 7 and 3, that have taught <br/>
me more about this unschooling thing than anyone else. But I have to <br/>
give credit to many of the long-time posters at unschooling.com, <br/>
including Kelly, Sandra, Anne, Joyce, Rue and many others for helping <br/>
me trust and learn how to let GO.<br/>
<br/>
Christy (who just signed in) used to live near me, and then they up <br/>
and moved to Turkey goshdarnit! And Rue is my twin (well, not really, <br/>
I only wish), but I&#39;m the evil one.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m gonna like it here.....<br/>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A SMALL list? Have you seen how many people have already logged on?</div>
<div>WOW!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&#39;m Kelly and as radical as Ren. I watched, chuckling, as Ren got this unschooling &quot;thang&quot; a few years ago. Her &quot;reckoning&quot; is all recorded at unschooling.com----well, if it&#39;s been saved. They&#39;re cleaning up a bit over there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have two boys, Cameron (16) and Duncan (8). Cameron was in private school until after sixth grade. We&#39;ve been unschooling ever since. His deschooling&nbsp;story has been told several times at the different lists and unschooling.com. But he&#39;s SHINING now! </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Duncan&#39;s never been to school and is a happy sort----learning without the pangs of school-history.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My husband, Ben, is a Citadel graduate (think Pat Conroy&#39;s _Lords of Discipline_!) and a full-believer in unschooling----as well as a speaker at all unschooling conferences.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I started the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference two years ago in Columbia, SC. It&#39;s been a big success, and Kathryn&#39;s taking over for me this year in Peabody, MA. I hope ALL of you will attend.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There&#39;s nothing more &quot;convincing&quot; than seeing actual unschoolers in action! Moms, dads, kids----and a couple of grandparents!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>People joke that I am the &quot;Billy Graham of Unschooling.&quot; I want everyone to know it exists----and when you decide that this is what you want to pursue, I want you to &quot;get it&quot; as soon as possible! I kind of wear unschooling on my sleeve----well, at least on&nbsp;the back of my car, which is home to a dozen unschooling bumper stickers! &lt;G&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cool to be in Turkey, Christy! Want to tell us a bit about it?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, Rue is the sweet one! &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022621943">I&#39;m Rebecca, married to Jason and proud mama to Jaiden(almost 6) and Avery(almost 3)-both boys. We have a little one due sometime the end of Sept. We moved to Michigan from San Diego in Dec. so that Jason could go to school. I&#39;m working for the first time in about 8 years.<br/>
<br/>
We made the decision to homeschool when Jaiden was 2, I thought Waldorf was the way to go, until I found unschooling, and there was NO turning back.<br/>
<br/>
My first experience with unschoolers was on U-D, when it was dot-com, and a huge debate about Eminem was going on. (some may remember that) I have kept pretty quiet on most of the lists I&#39;m on, until this week anyways. But it has been the words of Kelly, Sandra, Joyce, Rue and Ren (the twins) and many others that have kept me moving towards the ideal that I strive for every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad they are here when I falter with words of encouragment and the strength to share their mishaps and learning moments with me and everyone with the courage to look for a better way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be on this group, and looking forward to continuing the journey and staying on the path with everyone here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807243018"><div>
<div>hi all. i&#39;m collette and i live in michigan with dh and three sons.&nbsp; mason is 6, hunter is 4, logan is 2. right now i guess we are more eclectic hsers than anythings else. i stopped &quot;doing school&quot; with mason around christmas when he announced &quot;i want to take a break from school.&quot; i was more than happy to oblige. in these past few months i have seen his reading, writing, math abilities sky-rocket. he gets his reading practice everywhere around him - signs, games (board and video), movies. he learns math by playing with numbers in his head - money, games. he writes little notes to his best friend next door and to his father and myself.&nbsp; </div>
<div>as much as i love unschooling though, dh isn&#39;t quite ready for me to let go completely. he will ask me once in a while what we are up to regarding school. i am not sure how long i will be able to hold off &quot;doing school&quot; again with mason. honestly though, mason asked me to start doing school again just a few days ago....... go figure. </div>
<div>looking forward to learning a lot from this group,</div>

<div>Hi, Collette, and welcome!<br><br>I&#39;d start writing down what &quot;school&quot; he IS doing on a daily basis. Do this for several months, like the&nbsp;whole summer. Then when your husband asks, during the summer, say that you&#39;re taking a break. In September when he feels that you should be &quot;hitting the books&quot; again, I&#39;d show him your daily log.

kids...my poor dh is along for the ride....he loves the idea in theory, but 
every once in a while his upbringing comes back to haunt him and he questions 
things. We just &quot;graduated&quot; our oldest (she wanted the fun parts of a senior 
year....pictures, an open house...so we are obliging). My youngest has never had 
&quot;school at home&quot;, the others have had varying degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;I run an 
inclusive homeschool group in our area and I see it as my personal mission that 
new homeschool families know and understand the option of unschooling as they 
investigate homeschooling. I often feel like I&#39;m just muddling along so I&#39;m sure

more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745585222">Hi, I am Tamara. My husband, James, have 1 daughter (almost 9).<br/>
I&#39;ve been following her lead all along, she wanted to try school so <br/>
we found small homeschooling supportive public school. Attendance is <br/>
flexible. Due to reasons I won&#39;t go into right now, she chose to come <br/>
home this year. She was home for kindergarten, school 3 - 4 days a <br/>
week for grade 1 and 2. She was in grade 3 this year. We are still <br/>
involved at the school, she is in the play, I have several volunteer <br/>
positions there, we go on field trips and there is a big camping trip <br/>
next month. But no class time, WOO HOO!!!!!<br/>
e are having a great time!<br/>
<br/>
Tamara<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll write more another time, I&#39;m a bit distracted with getting a <br/>
dinner schedule set for a friend who was in a car accident. She&#39;s <br/>
home now, and our school community is being really great, I have <br/>
people bringing her food for the next week and I haven&#39;t even heard <br/>
from everyone yet! People can be so great in times of need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883105067">Hello everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I love how the Universe works.  I&#39;ve been lurking for awhile on the <br/>
Unschooling website and this group caught my eye today, just when I <br/>
needed it!<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 sons, David (12) and Ethan (8).  David was in ps thru 2nd <br/>
grade, then I started getting my feet wet in &quot;homeschooling&quot; thru <br/>
the ISP in the school district.  Then moved to two different <br/>
charter &quot;homeschool&quot; programs, which are merely public schools with <br/>
flexible schedules.  Have finally made the leap into full <br/>
unschooling, but am still detoxing.  I find myself laying math books <br/>
out on the table, hoping someone will want to work in one... I know, <br/>
I still have a fever.<br/>
<br/>
We let go of TV restrictions, and Ethan is &quot;testing&quot; me by watching <br/>
cartoons all day long.  Boy, do I need to meditate about walking my <br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
I know what I need is faith in myself and them, and a good dose of <br/>
support from the likes of ya&#39;ll.<br/>
<br/>
One note inspired by one of your posts:  Ethan was digging in the <br/>
garden with me the other day and picked up some pillbugs.  Being the <br/>
recovering &quot;teacher,&quot; I ran and got a book on pillbugs.  What he did <br/>
(instead of listen to the facts I was reading) was to observe the <br/>
birth process in his hand and tons of little white babies spilled <br/>
out of the mother.  Now THAT&#39;s learning first hand (pardon the pun).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here.  I look forward to the commraderie.<br/>
Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390410011">Hello.  I&#39;m Crystal.  I&#39;m on a couple of lists (unschooling <br/>
discussion, always learning and unschooling.com, &quot;hello everybody&quot;) <br/>
but I don&#39;t get to post as much as I&#39;d like because I work so by the <br/>
time I read a thread, usually everyone has already answered.  Plus, <br/>
I hate to post an answer and not be able to get back for a couple of <br/>
days, you know?  Anyway, I&#39;ll try.  <br/>
<br/>
About me:  I&#39;ve been unschooling with my two youngest, Sean-15 and <br/>
Erica-14 next month, since Oct of 2001.  Erica finished 5th grade in <br/>
school and Sean finished 6th.  Erica and I took to unschooling <br/>
immediately.  She and I had no problem deschooling, but Sean just <br/>
deschooled within the last few months (is that a deschooling <br/>
record?)!  Up until then he believed he had to get a high school <br/>
diploma and then go to college to be sucessful.  Recently, though, <br/>
he found a love for cooking and he&#39;s finally seeing that there is <br/>
more than one path to success.  He even told me he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
cooking if he was in school.  Unfortunately he&#39;s still doing the <br/>
teenage rebel thing that schooled kids do, though less often.  <br/>
Without unschooling I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have lost him by now, either to the <br/>
streets or to the courts.  <br/>
<br/>
Erica left school one month into 6th grade and unable to read.  Of <br/>
course we didn&#39;t know that was her &quot;problem&quot; because the school had <br/>
her labled as ADHD and just an all around difficult child.  I put <br/>
problem in quotations because it wouldn&#39;t have been a problem had <br/>
she never gone to school.  I also don&#39;t believe she ever had ADHD.  <br/>
She just couldn&#39;t conform and I don&#39;t think she ever will.  Right <br/>
now she draws, and writes poetry and stories.  (She&#39;s reading over <br/>
my shoulder right now and says she mostly draws and reads and role <br/>
plays which is a form of story writing with other people online.  <br/>
She also says she&#39;s learning new words.)  She&#39;s funny.  She keeps <br/>
telling me what to tell you guys--lol.  She has her whole life <br/>
planned out already.  She says it&#39;s actually a 15-year plan, but it <br/>
will set up the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
I have no family support in this so I&#39;m trying to make my own <br/>
support through community.  They blame all Sean&#39;s problems on the <br/>
fact that he isn&#39;t in school and that I spoil him.  Anyway, that&#39;s <br/>
enough about me.  I&#39;ll be checking back here soon.<br/>

he is not a willing participant in any discussion of it.&nbsp; We&#39;ll wear him 
down however...&nbsp; My son&#39;s Keegan(5), Kayden(3.5) and Kaleb (1.5)&nbsp; only 
know being free otherwise known as Unschooling.&nbsp; I&#39;m not perfect, still 
occasionally need de-schooling so I&#39;m here to learn.&nbsp; My husband Thinks

agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></div>

months we have been babysitting tadpoles.&nbsp; We&nbsp;captured them as eggs 
and they have finally reached their final stage as a Forglet where we will 
return them to their home.&nbsp; We haven&#39;t made a big deal about having them 
here, just observing them, (finding items that float for the arrival of legs and 
the disappearance of gills, eating patterns, size differences, color 
variations).&nbsp; We had to add some clean water to the tank because we could 
barely see them and when we did about ten died.&nbsp; We thought we did 
everything right, but the frogs being the environmental barometer they 
are&nbsp;must have&nbsp;picked up something funky&nbsp;in our well water.&nbsp; 
We are letting them go to be adult frogs tomorrow and we are all sad, but also 
excited to see them go.&nbsp; We&#39;ve had a great time and it never got bookish

Hi Karen,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on many groups, not currently homeschooling or <br/>
unschooling but we hope to next year.  My daughter is 11 and wants to <br/>
try 6th grade and middle school next year (a story for another <br/>
time).  I wanted to comment on your pillbugs (we call them <br/>
rolypolys!) and my daughter, too, has observed them give birth.   <br/>
I&#39;ll always remember her discovery and the excitement of sharing it <br/>
with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504359970">&quot;My husband and I cannot find enough hours in the day to do all the<br/>
projects and pursue all of our interests.  We are always reading,<br/>
playing, singing....learning. I feel that school robbed me of the<br/>
ability to know what I want and I am just now reclaiming that<br/>
ability.  I&#39;m 34.  I will not send my children to an institution that<br/>
does not seem to have the best interests of children at heart.  The<br/>
best place they can be is here in the real world, with mom and dad. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can totally relate.<br/>
I&#39;m 35, and it seems my passions and interests just come pouring out constantly. I have a new obsession almost monthly (sometimes weekly), life is SO interesting. <br/>
I&#39;ve really thought a LOT about the fact that my children will just never even relate to the way a schooled mind operates. This unschooling life is so empowering and rich....I love seeing the way they think, sharing their dreams and interests with them, and seeing how totally different they are from the average child because of the freedom they have. They take for granted so many things that schooled kids would just die for! And that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s really great to hear about involved Dads...welcome.<br/>
The great thing about unschooling, is you won&#39;t have to <br/>
play &quot;teacher&quot; anymore. It&#39;s a journey in which you are all the <br/>
learners, working together as a family to do the things you love!<br/>
You and your wife have permission to play as much as the kids...it&#39;s <br/>
very empowering.:)<br/>
Unschooling is freedom for all of you, to do the things that are <br/>
meaningful for your own life. It&#39;s about trusting that your children <br/>
will learn better without lesssons, or teachers, but from LIVING a <br/>
joyful life.<br/>
Stick around, we&#39;ll give ya an earful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Crystal,<br/>
   I can relate here. We pulled Chuck our 14 year old out of public <br/>
school in the same grade as Erica. He was labled ADHD in 4th grade <br/>
and with all the testing (You had to score a 19 to be labled ADHD <br/>
and he score a 19 or 20) Just prior to pulling him out of school I <br/>
happened upon a article on the web about Vision Therapy and the <br/>
article was talking about Chuck (at least I swear it could have been <br/>
written about him) We had him tested and found out that he needed <br/>
glasses and had some vision problems due to muscles not forming <br/>
properly. I knew that when he tested so low for adhd that maybe he <br/>
was not that but after two years of being on ritalin and fighting <br/>
with the teachers, having the major &quot;meltdowns&quot; when coming off the <br/>
ritalin in the evenings and still not being able to focus on his <br/>
work  etc we find out that his problem was his vision. How can a <br/>
child possibly sit still all day and read when he could not do it <br/>
(he needed glasses to read and had passed every since vision test <br/>
that was given by the school district, so they never found this <br/>
problem in 7 years of schooling.)<br/>
 So as will Erica I felt the same way about Chuck that he just did <br/>
not fit in with conventional school not just because of the vision <br/>
stuff but with other things that was all probably brought on by his <br/>
vision problem. <br/>
 Ok enough from me lol<br/>
