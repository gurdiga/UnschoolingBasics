<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983807827">Our 10 yo son loves both Neopets (neopets.com) and Toontown<br/>
(toontown.com).  They are both very child friendly and Toontown has won<br/>
the parenting award several years running.   Both promote reading skills<br/>
without the children knowing it.   Neopets is interesting in that you<br/>
&quot;adopt&quot; pets and have to feed them, and read to them if you want their<br/>
intelligence to increase, etc.  Jellyneo.net is a great help website for<br/>
understanding the game and how it works.   You can have a shop,<br/>
advertise it on the boards, etc.   I have a Neopets account, as well,<br/>
and we give gifts to each other.  I&#39;m karatekidsmom if you want to visit<br/>
me on the site.  My son has even learned to utilize  html code as a<br/>
result of this game!<br/>
<br/>
Toontown is more of a cooperative game.  Again, reading is strengthened,<br/>
and the phrases you can use to communicate are limited and therefore it<br/>
is a safe online environment, yet very, very fun.<br/>
<br/>
Julie (momx12), I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your mom.  My Dad has lung<br/>
cancer and we found the following book very helpful, &quot;The Cancer<br/>
Battleplan Sourcebook&quot;.  Congrats on the little one that&#39;s on the way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537497994">Build A Bear Workshop recently launched a new online community called <br/>
BuildABearville.  My 10yos goes there occasionally.  They also have a <br/>
safe chat feature.  Accounts are free to anyone who owns a Build A Bear <br/>
(even if you bought the bear 10 years ago).  You earn points through <br/>
various activities which you can then use to buy clothes and furniture <br/>
for your virtual bear and his condo.<br/>

My 10yos and 7yos have recently discovered GuildWars.  They play it <br/>
online with their dad and grandad. Our idea of the perfect family <br/>
gathering is a LAN party;)  Like WOW, you buy the software and then <br/>
play online.  Unlike WOW, your account is free with your software <br/>
purchase.  As we currently don&#39;t have any WOW players in our family, I <br/>
can&#39;t say how the actual gameplay compares.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831725673">Thanks for the tips. We just recently added a couple of computers to the house and set them all up on high speed so this is a fun new world of exploration for us. my 16 yr old is a geek of the first order(we call him our resident geek and our 22 yr old our professional geek) and it looks like a couple of the younger&#39;s will be following along. I love my computer for emails and research, but with some of mine it seems like an natural extension of their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the book recommendation, If we don&#39;t get too many inches of snow today I&#39;ll stop by the library and book store on my way home from mom&#39;s appt. today. She finished radiation to the tumors in her lower spine last Friday so we are in to see the head of her team today.<br/>
