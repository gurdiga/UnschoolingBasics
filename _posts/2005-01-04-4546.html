<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779218379">I have the hotel information for the 2005 Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference.<br/>
 <br/>
We will be just across the river from St Louis---actually in Illinois. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll be at the Four Points by Sheraton in Fairview Heights, IL. You can  <br/>
check out the hotel at    _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html_">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html)">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
The Central Reservation number is 1-800-325-3535.  <br/>
If you&#39;d like  to call the hotel directly: 1-618-622-9500. <br/>
 <br/>
Be sure to mention the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Fairview  <br/>
Heights, IL to get our low, low conference rate of $80/night. There are a very  <br/>
few suites at $110/night.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re planning to come a few days early or stay late, you can get the  <br/>
conference rate extended by asking.<br/>
 <br/>
The conference will be FOUR days this year, due to popular demand!  &lt;G&gt; So <br/>
we&#39;ll be starting on THURSDAY morning instead of Friday and going  through <br/>
SUNDAY---so October 6th through the 9th, 2005.<br/>
 <br/>
I met with our web designer on yesterday to iron out the website, so that  <br/>
should be up very soon. I&#39;ll post when it&#39;s up and running.<br/>
 <br/>
Looking forward to seeing you all there! And please feel free to cross-post  <br/>
at other unschooling e-lists/sites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566608842">YAY! I just booked a suite for the family and I&#39;m trying to figure out which airport is <br/>
closest... Also, does anyone know of cheap airlines? We&#39;re coming from Maine and there is <br/>
no way we could drive... my youngest can only last about two hours in the car before she <br/>
freaks out!<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone in the past crammed two families into one hotel room?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030089957">Yeah, Jessie and family will be there! I just booked a suite, too. Still <br/>
don&#39;t know whether to bring dh or my mother--toss up either way and not <br/>
as in a win/ win. *eg*<br/>
<br/>
Great rate, btw, Kelly! I tried to book for several days longer, and was <br/>
just like, &quot;umm, never mind.&quot;<br/>

What do you mean, Danielle?  Did they not want to give you the <br/>
conference rate for a few more days?<br/>

<br/>
They added a day on either side, but I wanted to extend about four days <br/>
after, and they wouldn&#39;t do it at the conference rate. I was on the main <br/>
reservation line--an 800 number--so there may be more luck with this by <br/>
calling the hotel itself for reservations.<br/>

Thanks for the info.  I&#39;m going to call the hotel directly and we are <br/>
planning to stay there 5th-10th also.  Mapquest says it&#39;s an eight and <br/>
a half hour drive from Detroit so I&#39;m not expecting to be there any <br/>
sooner than a 10 hour ride.  I like driving at night instead of during <br/>
the day so that should help some, too, I hope.  :)<br/>

We made reservations last night directly with the hotel and got the  <br/>
conference rate from the 5th through the 10th.  I just received the  confirmation # <br/>
this morning so we&#39;re set.  Driving from Florida  again...haven&#39;t even tried to <br/>
figure out the mileage.  It&#39;s far but  definitely worth it!<br/>

Jessie, there are two airports: Lambert Field in St Louis and there&#39;s a  <br/>
smaller airport in Mascoutah, IL----MidAmerica Airport. I&#39;d try both to check  out <br/>
your options.<br/>
 <br/>
You*can* cram two families in----but don&#39;t tell the hotel. It&#39;s  against fire <br/>
regulations.<br/>

<br/>
CNN had a story yesterday about Delta slashing it&#39;s prices by 50% and <br/>
that other airlines might follow suit. So keep your eyes open...it <br/>
could get pretty cheap!!<br/>
