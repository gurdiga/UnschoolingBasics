<div id="ygrps-yiv-328023248">In February of 1999 we moved into this house.  At that time the cable bill <br/>
was not in the budget and there was no antenna, so we went without.  I&#39;ve <br/>
watched tv very rarely since then and do not miss it.  We have the lowest <br/>
netflix membership and once every few months may rent from a video <br/>
store.  My daughters are here 3+ days a week and do not seem to miss it <br/>
here at all.  At their mother&#39;s they watch it, one very little, one more often.<br/>
<br/>
I found that living without the constant barrage from the rabid <br/>
commercialism of mass media was liberating, and my daughters are much more <br/>
aware of the psychology of chronic want that is so pervasive in our <br/>
culture.  I noticed a marked decrease in the kids asking for things when we <br/>
shopped, or feeling like they just had to have the latest fad item.  They <br/>
seem to evaluate things based on their own impression of the item and most <br/>
times find all the stuff that pass through our culture from week to week to <br/>
be useless and sad.  Without the constant blatant and subliminal message <br/>
that this or that is what they need now they look at so much of the junk <br/>
our culture produces as just that.<br/>
<br/>
Also found that once we lived without it for a while, trying to watch a <br/>
show that is interrupted every few minutes by commercials was not enjoyable <br/>
at all.  Most tv series or movies that are at all popular make it to DVD <br/>
fairly quickly and watching them without interruption is so much better.<br/>
<br/>
This is what we have found.  It works for us.  If you want to find out if <br/>
it will work for you I would recommend going without for six months.  Any <br/>
less may not really show you what living without tv is like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507142544">Yep, we turned off cable (and thereby any reception!) over two years<br/>
ago.  Had to come from my husband�he admitted it was his own version of<br/>
heroin (tee hee).  We watch videos we�re interested in and my husband<br/>
and I are quite addicted to our nightly Netflix but happily so.  Once<br/>
the movie�s over, it�s over.  No flipping channels for hours, which<br/>
previously exhausted us and things didn�t get done.  It�s been wonderful<br/>
this way!  We have been thinking of maybe getting the basic 3 or 4 local<br/>
channels again with some rabbit ears, just so we can see PBS again and<br/>
see what�s going on in the world on the news, though we both listen to<br/>
NPR periodically throughout the day so maybe we don�t.  Our two girls<br/>
are happy as clams getting into things in the woods, gardening, dressing<br/>
up and making up elaborate stories, etc.  I notice they do repeat lines<br/>
from movies they�ve seen a lot but they also make up their own stories<br/>
which tells me the amount of media influence is ok.  <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  I love flipping channels for hours. I make a choice to do it or not. I get things done when I want or not. TV is not more powerful than me. I am empowered.<br/>
  My kids are empowered.<br/>
  People give to much power to TV and Commercials. I like good commercials.<br/>
  My 5 year old that was never restricted on TV viewing does not like then and thinks they are a waste of his time unless they are funny. <br/>
  We talk about commercials. My father worked in the advertising industry and we had plenty of discussions about it.<br/>
  I do not understand why people get so scared of it.<br/>
  TV is like just any other media.<br/>
  My 5 year old watches very little TV now a days.<br/>
  He has better things that he would rather do most of the time. My 27 month old likes it even less. She rather do other things too.<br/>
  I also have wonder full memories of watching shows as a family growing up.<br/>
  I mostly record my shows on DVR so I can watch later at night while everyone is as sleep and I do fast forward the commercials.<br/>
  My DH only likes to watch sports and those are only fun if live.<br/>
  No one family NEEDS to have TV and cable.<br/>
  But to not have it because you fear it???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529080286">When my older children were younger(they are 18 and 17 now).  We did not have a tv for 8 years.  I was a single mom, and could not afford it, and I was determined that &quot;tv rots your brain&quot;  that they needed to read and learn and  be active in life, not a watcher.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was doing something beneficial, I really wasn&#39;t... here&#39;s why...<br/>
<br/>
1-they could not identify with other children who watched tv...making them sort of social outcasts.<br/>
2-they could read well, and loved to read.. but when we eventually got a tv, they watched everything, all the time.. they were starved of tv  (although thier love for reading did continue)<br/>
3-they are no smarter than thier peers who did have tv in thier homes.<br/>
 <br/>
although it did help us to be closer in the evening, when many people sit in front of the tv and &quot;veg out&quot;... I think that we would have had a lot of good memories about movies or tv shows, that we watched together.<br/>
<br/>
also, tv does invite and introduce many subject matters to your children, and that introduction allows you to speak to them about it.   (especially the lifetime movies), lol<br/>
<br/>
that is my take on &quot;doing with out&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We lived without a TV set for a long time before our son, Liam, was <br/>
born and then for several years afterwards.  I never liked television <br/>
(maybe one or two things on TV were okay), and my husband felt he was <br/>
sort of addicted to it.  We did eventually get a wee little TV with a <br/>
built-in VCR when Liam was about 6 or 7 and then satellite TV maybe a <br/>
half a year later.  If I had it to do over again, I would have tried <br/>
to make sure we had TV with programming for Liam at a much earlier <br/>
age.  Only because he likes it!  If I felt that TV was taking over <br/>
his life, then I would not get rid of the TV but do whatever I could <br/>
to make his environment richer so that TV is not necessarily the most <br/>
interesting thing in his environment.  By the way, getting a DVR <br/>
really, really helps because Liam is not bound by the TV networks&#39; <br/>
scheduling.  That makes it a lot easier for him to do other more <br/>
interesting stuff without being concerned about missing something he <br/>
really likes to watch.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to see the TV show he has liked to watch that has not <br/>
offered him *something* of value.  And by the way, he is not at all <br/>
attracted to &quot;educational&quot; programming.  Sometimes he has liked to <br/>
watch that show &quot;How It&#39;s Made&quot; (I think it&#39;s called), but he far <br/>
prefers MAD-TV and other Comedy Central silly shows (like Futurama) <br/>
and things on Cartoon network, etc.  It&#39;s all good, really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450871318">Two of my daughters and my husband are sitting in the same room with  <br/>
me. Three of us are on our laptops, my husband is folding laundry, and  <br/>
we&#39;re all watching a show about Indiana Jones on the History Channel -  <br/>
Indiana Jones and the Ultimate Quest. It is mostly about the history  <br/>
of people who have searched for legendary artifacts. We&#39;re all talking  <br/>
about it - and googling various things that have come up. LOTS of  <br/>
interesting connections. There are commercials - we&#39;ve been talking  <br/>
about those, too.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t sit around watching only &quot;educational&quot; tv - this just happens  <br/>
to be what is on right this minute. Last night we watched hours of  <br/>
&quot;The Office.&quot; That experience gives us a large base of shared humor -  <br/>
it comes up in our conversations all the time. Again, lots of  <br/>
connections.<br/>
<br/>
Even when the kids were really young, the same kind of bonding and  <br/>
connections happened with children&#39;s tv shows - sometimes  <br/>
intentionally educational shows, sometimes shows that anti-tv people  <br/>
would point to as &quot;junk.&quot; ANY time we parents watch shows with our  <br/>
children, seeing them through our children&#39;s eyes, wonderful  <br/>
opportunities for bonding and connection-making exists. Those who  <br/>
don&#39;t allow tv are really missing out on something great.<br/>
<br/>
Can they live happy unschooling lives without tv? Of course. They  <br/>
could live happy unschooling lives without books, too. Or without a  <br/>
beach (we live near the ocean). Or without art supplies or bicycles or  <br/>
legos or Disneyland.  People may not live near an ocean or be able to  <br/>
afford a Disneyland pass, but TV is cheap and everywhere. So why give  <br/>
up something so beneficial?<br/>
<br/>
I think that parents often subconsciously think of it as a sacrifice  <br/>
that will somehow keep their children safe. I understand this. We love  <br/>
our little ones so MUCH and feel so strongly that they are such a huge  <br/>
responsibility, and we are terrified when we realize how much of what  <br/>
they will experience in life is out of our control.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes courage and doesn&#39;t work well in a fearful  <br/>
environment. Unschooling also helps parents become less and less  <br/>
fearful, over time. I think that&#39;s why unschoolers began to question  <br/>
the conventional wisdom among &quot;good&quot; parents that TV is necessarily  <br/>
harmful. We got the habit of thinking specifially about our own kids,  <br/>
not thinking of them as &quot;generic&quot; children, but as individuals. We had  <br/>
the guts to ask ourselves, &quot;Exactly how would watching tv really harm  <br/>
Roya or Roxana or Rosie?&quot; (Fill in your own kids&#39; names.) We looked at  <br/>
the real evidence in front of our own eyes. We also went back and read  <br/>
the anti-tv books and articles and realized that they didn&#39;t apply to  <br/>
kids who were living the way our kids were - our kids had lots of  <br/>
time, for example, to read and play AND watch tv. Our kids weren&#39;t  <br/>
escaping from school-induced stress by vegging out in front of the tv  <br/>
- they were actively engaged in their tv-watching. It wasn&#39;t the kind  <br/>
of passive zombie-like experience that the anti-tv &quot;experts&quot;  <br/>
described. Over time, we stopped being afraid or nervous and started  <br/>
reveling in the real-life experience of enjoying all the amazing  <br/>
variety of experience available through television.<br/>
<br/>
We have so MANY good memories centered around tv. My kids are 17, 20  <br/>
and 23. I have absolutely NO regrets about our tv-watching. I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
want to have missed it!<br/>

  flipping channels. i think i get more from net surfing than channel surfing,<br/>
  but that&#39;s my preference anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373606303">I &quot;grew up&quot; without a TV until the age of 4, simply because it was not part<br/>
of my parents&#39; world. In those early years, I lived in a tiny apartment<br/>
where my grandma took care of me while my parents worked (mom was still in<br/>
medical school or an intern). She and I talked a lot while she cooked and<br/>
cleaned, and I played pretend with my dolls, wrote on my chalkboard, and<br/>
read little books we got at the corner news kiosk. Grandma took me to the<br/>
park every single day, walking down stimulating city streets (full of<br/>
printed signs to read, architectural patterns, pedestrian traffic, that sort<br/>
of thing).<br/>
<br/>
At four I began preschool and when one day I came back asking &quot;what is<br/>
(insert name of popular kids&#39; TV show) my parents though: &quot;Oh no, she&#39;ll be<br/>
a social outcast&quot;. They figured I was already on that path because I could<br/>
read and preferred to spend most of my choice time in the &quot;quiet corner&quot;<br/>
with books and the occasional puzzle, rather than with the kids (mostly but<br/>
not all boys) whom I consider too rowdy in the &quot;block corner&quot; or the<br/>
sometimes cliquish girls (yes, four years olds can be cliquish!) in the<br/>
&quot;house&quot; corner. (As a side note, I&#39;m not sure why I never showed any<br/>
interest in playing the &quot;mom&quot; or the &quot;sister&quot; or the &quot;baby&quot; - on the other<br/>
hand later at 10 or so I enjoyed and thrived in the role of Sabrina in many<br/>
imaginary &quot;Charlie&#39;s Angels&quot; episodes! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
So, we got a TV. Of course, TV there at that time was not unlimited with all<br/>
the channels 24/7 like we have now, so I was naturally limited to a couple<br/>
of 1-hour-long afternoon live musical/variety-type shows that included maybe<br/>
one or two cartoons (which my mother didn&#39;t like - she disapproved of<br/>
associating &quot;inane violence&quot; with humor a la Road Runner, but she still let<br/>
me watch them, while stating her opinion). By the start of school, I&#39;d lost<br/>
interest in the &quot;preschool shows&quot; and was too busy playing with friends<br/>
after school, reading, and generally living life...plus there was nothing<br/>
really interesting on TV except for maybe Little House on the Prairie and<br/>
the Magical World of Disney, on Friday nights and Sundays, which we watched<br/>
as a family.  This was on black and white until I was about 7, I think. It<br/>
was also around that time that Carl Sagan&#39;s Cosmos aired. And at some point<br/>
I remember my family watching the Roots mini series, too (mostly without<br/>
me). But my point is TV shows then were definitely an event, not something<br/>
that was on all the time.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that is a *healthy* model of living with TV.<br/>
<br/>
Fastforward to my late teens, now we have a big (color!) screen and cable<br/>
AND a satellite dish and all sorts of channels including MTV and morning<br/>
game shows and CONSTANT news and late night informercials and a cartoon<br/>
channel and, and...Life at home almost invariably happens to the soundtrack<br/>
of the TV in the family room, the hub of the home. But at least there was<br/>
just the one TV in the house, and whenever we were all at home we would most<br/>
of the time all be in that one room, simultaneously doing other things (my<br/>
mother even set up her sewing table in there, my dad reading the paper or<br/>
occasionally playing a a card game or board game with me).<br/>
<br/>
So, IMO, bonding around the TV can also be healthy for a family.<br/>
<br/>
Now, most of my adult life, certainly the past several years we&#39;ve lived<br/>
without cable (except for when my mom would come to visit, then she enjoys<br/>
her home and garden shows while busy baking or sewing or crocheting, and at<br/>
times the kids would watch a lot of Animal Planet and Kids Discovery<br/>
Channel) but with a steady supply of library videos and more recently<br/>
Netflix, which like someone else says, has among its advantages that it<br/>
&quot;starts and ends&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We are soon to get FiOs, and a bigger, flat screen, and a dedicated<br/>
&#39;media/computer&#39; room. I am very ambivalent about this - I can see the joy<br/>
in recovering our family room from under all the Guitar Hero and World of<br/>
Warcraft so that it feels &quot;light and calm&quot; enough again to read books and<br/>
build models and play instruments in (rather than having to go into a<br/>
bedroom for any of those!) I&#39;m *hoping* we will be like those here who have<br/>
said they have control of the TV, not the other way around. I am optimistic<br/>
that I won&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; my family in that room (or alternatively end up in there<br/>
24/7 myself in order to be with them), but only time will tell!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll all forgive me for writing this long statement here, but it&#39;s<br/>
been helpful for me to distill what I really believe makes a healthy family<br/>
relationship with TV. This includes it being an &quot;event&quot; or series of events<br/>
(vs a constant background), and a source of family bonding (vs isolation).<br/>
Of course things aren&#39;t black and white and I know there will be days<br/>
(particularly days when someone happens to be down with some virus or we&#39;re<br/>
just pooped after a camping trip and devote a day just to hanging out in our<br/>
PJs and doing tons of laundry, etc) when the TV will be on for hours on end,<br/>
and that is perfectly fine with me, s long as it doesn&#39;t become a way of<br/>
life for us. It&#39;s just that I hear of so many people with 3-4-5 TV<br/>
households where family members are each isolated in their own little world,<br/>
and know so many kids talking about having watched shows that are IMO<br/>
completely inappropriate for them in content, with their parents not even<br/>
realizing it or not thinking there&#39;s anything wrong with it. To each their<br/>
own, I just don&#39;t want our life to be like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1-they could not identify with other children who watched tv...making them<br/>
&gt; sort of social outcasts.<br/>
&gt; 2-they could read well, and loved to read.. but when we eventually got a<br/>
&gt; tv, they watched everything, all the time.. they were starved of tv<br/>
&gt; (although thier love for reading did continue)<br/>
&gt; 3-they are no smarter than thier peers who did have tv in thier homes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; although it did help us to be closer in the evening, when many people sit<br/>
&gt; in front of the tv and &quot;veg out&quot;... I think that we would have had a lot of<br/>
&gt; good memories about movies or tv shows, that we watched together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also, tv does invite and introduce many subject matters to your children,<br/>
&gt; and that introduction allows you to speak to them about it. (especially the<br/>
&gt; lifetime movies), lol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; that is my take on &quot;doing with out&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671448606">Yes, I confess, no TV!  I have lived without TV for maybe 18 years  <br/>
but watch lots of movies these days - as do the other family members  <br/>
- on the computers.  We do occasionally download TV shows from ITunes  <br/>
- Avatar is our all time favourite.  It&#39;s funny in a way because on  <br/>
the unschooling lists I feel like everyone has full &#39;tech support&#39;   <br/>
-  TV, Video games, Wii&#39;s etc. - except for us and on the Waldorf  <br/>
lists that I also belong to many people don&#39;t even have any computer  <br/>
games in their lives - which we do.  But I love both of these groups  <br/>
and find ways to make them wholeheartedly integrated into our family  <br/>
life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047902229">I have a 3.5 y.o. (boy) as well, and he is also quite comfortable at home and in the yard. The T.V. shows they like could be a jumping off point for some new toys, if they like Diego, maybe some cool new animals, build a  treehouse together, go on &#39;rescue&#39; missions (like hiding different animals around the house and going off to find them).<br/>
Another thing if they don&#39;t like to go out but you would like to see what kind of toys  they would like is shopping online with them (or without them, to give you ideas, and order some new cool things online). To get ideas you can look at sites like leapsandbounds.com, magiccabin.com etc. or type in a keyword into ebay and seeing what comes up. Sometimes you can get really cool selections of toys for not so much money.<br/>
Also, what I am just learning more of recently, just go do something new yourself that YOU are really excited about. Sometimes, they might tag along, watch you, or not, but if they see that you are still curious and trying out new things, the spirit of it is catching. I have really gotten into gardening lately, then decided to build a pond in the backyard etc, and they have been coming with me to different places like Garden Centers or the NE Wildflower Society and picking out their own plants, helping me grow things, and just doing all kinds of experiments in the backyard.<br/>
I could go on and on, but I am being called...<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289972464">***its not that we like it so much. more that its become a total shrine in<br/>

According to whom?  Do your children say to you &quot;Mom, the TV is our Shrine!&quot; or have you decided your kids are watching too much TV?    <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There is nothing about the TV that stops you from doing things together as a family.  There&#39;s nothing you can do without a TV that you can&#39;t do with one.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mistake for an unschooling mom to decide on behalf of her kids that they&#39;re going to live without TV.   You will be making their world smaller when you should be making it bigger.  You should provide for them with as many of the resource you&#39;re able to so they have a lot of experiences and inspiration and entertainment.   If you had a child who really liked to read you probably wouldn&#39;t take his books away.   If you had a kid who liked to play outside you wouldn&#39;t make the outdoors off limits.   <br/>
<br/>
Instead of taking the TV away, *add* new things to your life.  Go for more trips, more walks, more hikes, more picnics.   Play more games, make interesting foods, plant a garden, cook outside, go swimming, go boating, go camping.  Wander around a mall, go to a museum, an art gallery, a craft store.   Go ride Bumper Cars, visit an archery range, a climbing wall, a fish hatchery.   Get a trampoline, put in a sandbox, go play tennis, get some new video games, rent funny movies.   Get Tivo and record your kid&#39;s favorite things so that family outings don&#39;t mean they have to give up something else they love.  It&#39;s your job to get creative and make the world a big and interesting place for them.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And base them on what your children already love - some tv shows, right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean - if they&#39;re watching a lot of TV, what ARE they watching? I  <br/>
bet they have favorite shows. I bet there are things you could do  <br/>
related to those shows. My youngest daughter loved the Arthur tv shows  <br/>
- we bought her a little Arthur lunch box and she used to get up in  <br/>
the morning and make herself a lunch and put it in her Arthur  <br/>
lunchbox. Then she&#39;d eat it later in the day. We&#39;d talk about what she  <br/>
wanted to have for food in her lunch box - so there was a cool period  <br/>
of time when we were talking a lot about foods and we were shopping  <br/>
and she&#39;d carefully pick out what she&#39;d decided on - an apple or  <br/>
banana or string cheese or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Another show my kids all really loved was Reading Rainbow. They&#39;d make  <br/>
up their own versions of the segments at the end of the show when the  <br/>
kids come on and say, &quot;If you liked ......that book....., then you&#39;ll  <br/>
love .... this one....&quot;. We&#39;d video them.<br/>
<br/>
We often got tapes of the music from shows they liked a lot. And, just  <br/>
THIS week, my 17 year old bought two Animaniacs cd&#39;s - and we&#39;ve  <br/>
listened to them all week. It has been years since we listened to our  <br/>
old Animaniacs cassette tapes and it brought back such wonderful  <br/>
memories!<br/>
<br/>
Really - if kids seem to be &quot;doing nothing but watching tv,&quot; then I  <br/>
suggest you stick with the principle of supporting their interests!  <br/>
Don&#39;t toss the tv out the door - instead, revel in it. And expand on  <br/>
it - use it to make all kinds of other things happen in your  <br/>
children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling could be called &quot;Learning through Connections.&quot; Or maybe,  <br/>
&quot;One Thing Leads to Another Learning.&quot; It is hard to imagine anything  <br/>
much better than tv as a place to start with finding connections and  <br/>
letting one thing lead to another<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents who think their kids are watching too much tv do the  <br/>
opposite of supporting their interest. They won&#39;t buy toys or foods or  <br/>
clothes that are tv-show related, for example. I&#39;m encouraging you to  <br/>
REVEL in what they love. When they grow up, they&#39;ll continue to revel  <br/>
in what they love! THAT is the attitude toward life I wanted my kids  <br/>
to have and they do. They love what they do and they do what they  <br/>
love. This includes higher education, hobbies, careers,<br/>

we are just about to &#39;&#39;go without &#39;&#39;. and i know there will be tons of<br/>
other stuff to do. but i must admit..i feel like someone has chopped<br/>
off one of me limbs !!! anyone else survive without it ?? ann<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re equating living without a TV as &quot;limbless&quot; and worrying about <br/>
&quot;surviving&quot; without it, I think it&#39;s a very bad idea to get rid of the <br/>
TV.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, the TV holds no value and won&#39;t be missed at all <br/>
by any family member, then it makes sense to give it away.<br/>
<br/>
But to get rid of something that gives pleasure? Exactly what&#39;s the <br/>
point? To prove it&#39;s possible?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not getting the point. Seriously.<br/>

hiya. its not that we like it so much. more that its become a total <br/>
shrine in<br/>
our home. we spend far far too much time in front of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So....you don&#39;t LIKE it, but it has some magical power over you? You <br/>
sit in front of it because....it&#39;s holy?<br/>
<br/>
The language you&#39;re using sounds wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a box.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 so as an experiment im<br/>
shoving it into the loft for a while, and we will see what we can <br/>
achieve as a<br/>
family without it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do books have that same hold over you all? The computer? The dog? <br/>
The...ahem...the *garden*?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
just wondered if anyone else has done this ??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nope. Not us. But we do go days and days when it&#39;s not turned on at all.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, we just spent eight days in hotels this last two weeks. Only <br/>
one day did *I* watch anything at all (last night). And Ben retired <br/>
early one night to watch a movie.<br/>

 If you want to find out if<br/>
it will work for you I would recommend going without for six months.  <br/>
Any<br/>
less may not really show you what living without tv is like.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just make your life more interesting than what&#39;s on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe see what you can come up with that&#39;s better than what some <br/>
network can think up.<br/>
<br/>
Making the TV seem more powerful than a person is icky.<br/>
<br/>
BE exciting. DO cool stuff. If what&#39;s on TV is actually neater and more <br/>
fun than what you&#39;re providing, TV is the smarter choice. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t be more interesting than the TV, you *should* be watching <br/>
TV!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235627424">Is it possible that the TV is just more centrally located than<br/>
anything else?  If it&#39;s something that is bringing pleasure and<br/>
information, why would you remove it?  Have you thought of moving it<br/>
to a less central location?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids were crazy for the Wii when it was in the living room.  They&#39;d<br/>
skip sleeping and get up early and fight over it when it was new and<br/>
in our living room.  Now that it is comfortably in a peripheral room,<br/>
there is less obsession with it though it is still just as readily<br/>
available as it was before.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  Out of sight, out of mind may be enough to change<br/>
your perspective on the whole issue.<br/>
<br/>
Curious... what activities do you plan to replace the TV-watching time<br/>
with?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875952006">Thanks Kelly, as usually you help with perspective with just a few words.  As with *everything* since we started this RU path, any issue has been with me and not them.  I had an epiphany the other day when I realized that I&#39;m pushing against it because *I&#39;m* bored.  I was remembering that before I had kids, everything exciting to me was outside my house, because I&#39;m not a crafter, a scrapbooker, a baker, a knitter, etc., I was very active and invoved with lots outside the house.  So now I find myself wandering around (while my girls are *perfectly* happy playing, watching tv, reading, etc.) wondering what on earth to do with myself.  I think I devoured 1000 books from last summer until now, and I seem to not be too interested in reading right now, so I&#39;m back to what is that Jodi loves to do??  I will do some more exploration with that this week.  Someone else mentioned just allowing them to enjoy the gentle, quiet days at home...good advice too :).<br/>
