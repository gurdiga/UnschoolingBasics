<br/>
** these are MY thoughts about what Robyn wrote:**<br/>
<br/>
This also happens when my daughter writes.  At the moment she&#39;s not <br/>
writing much except online with her game (short comments while <br/>
playing and usually in &quot;shorthand&quot; because it&#39;s fast paced - &quot;u&quot; for <br/>
you etc, she knows it&#39;s not the &quot;correct&quot; way to spell, it&#39;s part of <br/>
playing the game).  Last year when she was in school I often scribed <br/>
(typed) her thoughts for her (also, she was on a 504 <br/>
plan/accommodations, which allows for scribing) because she couldn&#39;t <br/>
type or write them fast enough (she was also evaluated by an <br/>
occupational therapist and has a few small motor issues, none of <br/>
which matter in the unschooling world, I used that info to try to get <br/>
her more help in school - HA!).   If I were to &quot;make&quot; her write/type <br/>
her assignments, it would have squashed what little enjoyment she had <br/>
left about learning (she knew she would be homeschooling at the end <br/>
of the year, and her language arts teacher who assigned these writing <br/>
assignments was the only one who &quot;understood&quot; her, and my dd knew it, <br/>
so she felt encouraged when she &quot;did her best&quot;, even if that meant I <br/>
typed her paragraphs for her.   They were her words and I think she <br/>
learned more about editing, rethinking how to state something etc by <br/>
us doing that together.   It gave her the freedom to let her creative <br/>
juices flow by not being bogged down with &quot;writing&quot;).   She learns a <br/>
lot by talking things through, brainstorming.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have a fear that your child will never learn how to look <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stuff up unless you force her to do so from an early age, let us put <br/>
your mind at rest. It won&#39;t be long until you find that you *don&#39;t <br/>
have* the answers to her questions, which is the perfect time to <br/>
start saying &quot;Let&#39;s look that up on the internet....at the <br/>
library....in the encyclopedia.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Stacey, I used to worry about her not being able to &quot;look things up&quot; <br/>
or &quot;write paragraphs&quot; etc.   I don&#39;t have the wonderful words of <br/>
wisdom and experience that Robyn and others offer (thank you Robyn!) <br/>
but I CAN offer you my perspective, from someone VERY new to <br/>
unschooling.  When I first started reading about kids being allowed <br/>
to explore things at their own pace, child led learning (yeah, that <br/>
was a hard one at first for me!), I really had to absorb this concept.<br/>
I hope you are able to get some of those books Kelly suggested - <br/>
after reading them, I hope you will be able to understand more (it <br/>
takes time).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any process that puts even a small barrier between the two of you is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>detrimental to building relationships (the core of Unschooling <br/>
practice). One bad result of not straightforwardly answering her <br/>
questions is that she might stop asking you stuff altogether....&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have a very good relationship with my mother.  I lost her 11 <br/>
years ago to cancer and tried to talk to her before she died; it was <br/>
very hard for me, because I still felt like I was 12 years old, but I <br/>
reached out to her, and she shut me out.   I had no closure, no sense <br/>
of understanding, no feeling of acceptance of the adult I had <br/>
become.  My dd was 2 at the time.  One thing I vowed to myself, even <br/>
before my mother died, was that I would NOT make my dd feel the way <br/>
my mother made me feel (I always felt she was ANGRY at me, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
anything specific, just a feeling that I wasn&#39;t OK to be who I <br/>
was, &quot;warts and all&quot;).  Mutual respect is very hard for a lot of <br/>
adults, they think they have to &quot;be in charge&quot; and &quot;set the rules&quot;, <br/>
THEY know better, THEY know what&#39;s best.   Yes, I think there are <br/>
certain &quot;rules&quot; about safety that are important, but beyond that, our <br/>
children are human beings too, and the best way for them to learn to <br/>
respect others (as well as themselves!) is to treat them with <br/>
respect.  The need to know their thoughts and feeling are valid and <br/>
important.  Where else but the safety of our home can they explore <br/>
that and feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
This concept, though &quot;sort of&quot; in the back of my mind, based on what <br/>
I just said about my relationship with my mother, didn&#39;t fully make <br/>
sense until I started learning more about unschooling.   With each <br/>
new idea, or perhaps reading the way another long time and <br/>
experienced unschooler wrote a post, it drew me in.   Last year, <br/>
while my dd was still in school, but I KNEW we would be homeschooling <br/>
the following school year (she wanted to try middle school last year, <br/>
now she knows what she WON&#39;T be missing!), I started to work on <br/>
changing how I related to her.   I relaxed more about homework etc (I <br/>
never made an issue about grades, the rest of the issues she had in <br/>
school is another story that I won&#39;t go into here).   Yes, she had to <br/>
do it, but I helped her work through some things that maybe another <br/>
parent would have FORCED their child to do all on their own (if they <br/>
don&#39;t understand how to write a few paragraphs, how to get started, <br/>
how to organize it, even if they&#39;d done it in class, then how can <br/>
letting them &quot;do it on their own&quot;, struggling and hating that they <br/>
don&#39;t know what to do going to HELP them.   It only adds to the loss <br/>
of love of learning that I saw was happening in my dd).<br/>
<br/>
It also reinforced to me that, since I was spending all my free time <br/>
(I WAS working almost full time during the day) working with her way <br/>
beyond the 2 hrs or whatever it was that they said should be the max <br/>
time it takes to do homework, I might as well homeschool her!   And <br/>
be more effective about it. <br/>
<br/>
My dd has been deschooling since June, I&#39;ve let her do what she wants <br/>
(sleep a long as she wants, she&#39;s not a morning person), play on the <br/>
computer, play video games.   Kids who have always been in school <br/>
need this time to heal, they need to get the &quot;schooly&quot; way of <br/>
learning out of their heads so that they can then be open to knowing <br/>
what it is they TRULY are interested in.  She&#39;s got the basics down, <br/>
now is the time to work towards finding what she loves.  When kids <br/>
pursue their true passions, REAL learning occurs.  It IS really hard <br/>
to understand until you see it in action.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That may not seem like much of a loss when it&#39;s the relatively <br/>
 </span></blockquote>trivial &quot;how do you spell....?&quot; several times a day, or &quot;what <br/>
does ....mean?&quot; But what about when she is *not* asking you the <br/>
sometimes alarming questions like &quot;what does STD mean?&quot;, or the deeply<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; profound ones like &quot;what happens when you die?&quot; or &quot;what do you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>believe in?&quot; However possibly the worst result could be that she <br/>
stops answering your questions to her.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can SEE the healing.  I can feel it.  She can be very anxious, and <br/>
being home has freed her from some of the anxiety that school was <br/>
producing in her.  By treating her with respect, listening to her <br/>
describe what she&#39;s doing on her game, really taking the time to <br/>
listen and hear the joy it brings her, I &quot;see&quot; what she&#39;s learning <br/>
(I&#39;m amazed).  It just doesn&#39;t look like &quot;school&quot; and this will be <br/>
hard to let go of at first.  This is something that, because of the <br/>
joy, she&#39;s absorbing and assimilating in a way that would never <br/>
happen if she were being forced to do, say,  common denominators or <br/>
whatever.   There&#39;s no reason kids NEED to learn certain things at <br/>
certain ages.  Really!  Think about it as you read more and more <br/>
about the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
