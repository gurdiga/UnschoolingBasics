<div id="ygrps-yiv-653459202">She sounds like a great girl to me.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the problem?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not feeling connected enough? Maybe work on being interested in<br/>
the things she&#39;s interested and stop walking away when she&#39;s talking<br/>
about her stuff. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, my kids are each interested in things I could care less<br/>
about but when they want to talk about something or show me something<br/>
&quot;cool,&quot; I pay attention. Then they go back to doing what they were<br/>
doing, often without any interaction with me until the next time they<br/>
want to show me something.<br/>

&gt; see<br/>
&gt; it. She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a<br/>
&gt; set<br/>

&gt; if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m making sense... I&#39;ll move on. </span></blockquote></div>
