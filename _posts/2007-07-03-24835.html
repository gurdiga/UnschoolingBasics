As some of you know, I&#39;ve got two daughters, ages 4 and 5 (16 months<br/>
apart).  We&#39;ve been following, as much as we ourselves have been able to,<br/>
unschooling for their education.  I want to move more into RU.  When I<br/>
really contemplate actually doing it, I get all excited, but also fearful.<br/>
My emotions say, &quot;Radical Unschooling sounds like a GREAT idea!  How do you<br/>
implement it?  I don&#39;t want to go the wrong way and get hung out to dry&quot;<br/>
You bet I&#39;m unsure about it.  My instinct is to start out slowly, say with<br/>
television, or bedtime.  Just one or two for now.  I&#39;ve been thinking about<br/>
bedtime being the first.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you&#39;ve gotten through all that, then, concerning bedtime -- do you<br/>
let them go to bed whenever they wish?  Any caveats to that for your<br/>
family?<br/>
<br/>
The later my girls stay up, the crankier they get.  Or I should say the less<br/>
patience they each have.  Whereas during the day, a minor crisis might be<br/>
easily resolved, at night it becomes a BIG DEAL.  Evening is when Seana and<br/>
I get &quot;stuff done&quot; while they are asleep.  But if they&#39;re awake, they it<br/>
painfully obvious that if we&#39;re going to maintain our own sanity, we need to<br/>
go to bed with them (note: we co-sleep).  Not just from being less balanced<br/>
at  night, but they also demand more time with us, too.  We can&#39;t do<br/>
anything at night (NOTE: Seana is a night owl, I&#39;m a morning person).  They<br/>
have definitely made it clear that they want to stay up with us, and I&#39;m<br/>
inclined to have all of us start going to bed earlier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810322733">Hi Rob,<br/>
    As for our family, we take each bedtime as it comes. Most nights we go to bed with our 4.8 yo son at around 11pm. He chose that time since babyhood, and it works for us because we are night owls. On an average night, we are all 3 doing things independent of one another, and having our son up and busy isn&#39;t a problem. However, some nights, I choose his bedtime. Sleepiness is often disguised as grumpiness or bouncing off the walls, and that&#39;s one of the cues I follow to know that he needs help finding rest. <br/>
  And sometimes I just need a break, which I see as just as good a reason. In this case, I let him know that Mom needs quiet time, I ready him for bed, followed by story-time, a few &quot;Mom, I need a drink of water&quot;-type sitings, and he settles-in early. <br/>
   I hope you and your family find what works for you. We really like our lives &#39;flying by the seat of our pants&#39;, but know that routines work well for a lot of people. Good luck and happy bedtimes!<br/>

  With my kids, I pretty much say everything like it is. I don&#39;t have arbitrary rules, and I don&#39;t say &#39;because I told you so&#39;. I think that&#39;s why my son reasons things out so well, because I reason with him, and even tell him when I&#39;ve changed my mind about something, what I was thinking. I treat bedtime, TV time, mealtime, playtime, the same way. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still have to do the 123-threat to get him to take action (as I just did to get him to brush his teeth before bed), but even that is more of an understanding than a discipline. On 3, I usually chase him and tickle him, or playfully swat him on the tush. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With my 5yo, we&#39;ve never had a bedtime in the sense of mom or dad <br/>
saying &quot;now its time for bed&quot; - but we do communicate a lot about <br/>
what tiredness feels like and how each of us behave when we&#39;re <br/>
tired. Admittedly, there are times when that sounds like &quot;Aaaaarrgh! <br/>
Mommy is getting cranky because she&#39;s tired and needs to go to bed!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the past when Mo wanted to stay up but my partner and I were both <br/>
tired, we&#39;d set up one area of the house with water, maybe a snack, <br/>
and whatever toys she wanted, turn out lights elsewhere and sleep <br/>
with &quot;half an eye open&quot; as it were. Since Ray moved in things have <br/>
become more challenging, though, and there have been times when I&#39;ve <br/>
laid on the couch and sort of dozed so I could run interferrence - <br/>
Ray&#39;s a night owl, but I totally don&#39;t expect him to &quot;look after&quot; <br/>
Mo. When my partner isn&#39;t wiped out from a day of sawing he doesn&#39;t <br/>
need nearly as much sleep as I do, so he&#39;s happy to stay up with Mo. <br/>
Past two nights they&#39;ve gone and hung out by the mill so she could <br/>
play in the sawdust under the stars. Sweet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Evening is when Seana and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of y&#39;alls transition process will almost certainly involve <br/>
rethinking how and when &quot;stuff&quot; gets done. Morgan&#39;s sleep cycle <br/>
periodically shifts by a couple hours all-of-a-sudden. That always <br/>
throws me for a loop for a week while I figure out how to rearrange <br/>
my own time and energy to get my own &quot;stuff&quot; done. <br/>
<br/>
The last two weeks I&#39;ve had a double whammy - Ray had gone to visit <br/>
with his mom and grandma and they made him go to bed &quot;at a <br/>
reasonable hour&quot; - so when he came home his sleep schedule was <br/>
totally different then when he left. *And* Mo made one of her <br/>
periodic shifts and is now up much later than before. So I&#39;ve been <br/>
feeling like I have jet-lag or something.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose one caveat *I* would throw out is &quot;*Expect* there to be <br/>
a less-than-ideal transitional period&quot; while all y&#39;all figure this <br/>
out together. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323423427">Just thought with all the discussions of bedtimes I would share a<br/>
funny story about my 5 yr old son and last night&#39;s fireworks.   Every<br/>
year on the fourth we typically go to my parent&#39;s house on the<br/>
coast... this year I had one child at camp , one flying in on Monday<br/>
after a 12 day sailing trip in the keys who was exhausted etc.   So we<br/>
decided to stay here in Raleigh and just hang out and rest.   At the<br/>
coast each year my dad has someone come and do fireworks off the shore<br/>
for the kids and so forth, sparklers, the whole typical American 4th<br/>
of July thing (you know hot dogs, apple pie and blowing stuff up! )  <br/>
  Yesterday while dh and I were out shopping we picked up a variety<br/>
pack of fireworks (tame by grandfather&#39;s standard as he buys his in SC<br/>
not the &quot;safe&quot; ones they sell here in NC)  We got home and it was<br/>
7:30pm and still bright and sunny outside so we explained to my son<br/>
who was SOOOO excited by the idea of getting to set off fireworks that<br/>
we needed to wait until dark to be able to see them better.   We had<br/>
gotten these snake things that you light and they go from a pellet<br/>
into a long snake of ash (very weird looking but pretty cool!)  so we<br/>
did some of those to entertain him while it was still light out.   I<br/>
come back in to do a few things and eventually it&#39;s 9pm...he comes in<br/>
and announces that its dark out and  we needed to do it now because it<br/>
was almost his bedtime.   I laughed and said you don&#39;t HAVE a bedtime<br/>
... he laughed and said yes I do I decided it&#39;s pretty soon tonight<br/>
and you wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint me  by letting me miss the<br/>
fireworks!     Anyway I thought it was pretty clever of him to try to<br/>
influence the timing of things with that little line!   Other people<br/>
are always asking him isn&#39;t it his bedtime (visiting friends whose<br/>
kids have a bedtime)  so he thought it might be a viable line! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672837421">Hi Rob,<br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;ve only just started homeschooling in the past 6 months, and had progress very naturally into unschooling. As time goes by we find ourselves constantly re-examining my Asian cultural values, my husband western values and our parenting values. Some we let go, some we keep. But nevertheless, I find ourselves letting go quite alot, as we and son progress naturally into unschooling. But still, I can&#39;t see us  100% radical unschooling because I do still keep a few control over my son&#39;s life.  <br/>
   <br/>
  The ones we keep is exercising our parental rights to make him go to bed early, sometimes! If he&#39;s talking really, really loud and easily excited and bouncing of the walls at 9pm, and can&#39;t seems to hear the meaning of &quot;Stop&quot;, then it means he&#39;s out of control because his brain is too tired and is short-curcuiting. Well, that&#39;s how we&#39;ll explain to him, justifying the reason of an early bedtime at 9ish pm.  We co-sleep and bedtime presently seems to be getting later and later at 11.30ish which is fine with us. Hubby wakes at 6.30am and son wakes at 8.30ish. Where else I&#39;m more inclined to sleep till 10am, but am tryin very hard to drag myself out of bed at 9ish.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t tell son what to do as he seems to have his own routine, other than the outings I organise for us. He&#39;s not too fuss about it but there are times I still say we should go because mummy wants to go, so he&#39;s got no choice. He wakes, goes downstairs to watch tv or play PS2, until I wakes and give him breakfast. Goes back to PS2, and will change out of pjs and brush his teeth on his own sometime after that. And goes back to PS2 or pc. These goes on untl it&#39;s time to go out if we have an outing for that day or lunch time of which he is reminded to stop. He is not allowed back onto the PS2 in the afternoon.  So in the afternoon, he&#39;s normally on the internet for a short while, then we&#39;ll do something together like play a board game or crafts or watch tv together or go to the park nearby. Then it&#39;s time for me to prepare dinner of which son&#39;s back onto tv or pc educational games. Until dad&#39;s home, have dinner, watch news together, after which son plays with his toys or<br/>
 lego or train tracks or just rummaging thru his multiple toy boxes in his room upstairs, making a mess. <br/>
   <br/>
  Bathtime is around 8pm. Back to more playing after that until bedtime. In bed, we&#39;ll read some books together, mostly me(of which dad gets to watch tv) or dad(my night of  Yippee!!) doing the reading, sometimes son will last 3 stories, sometimes he&#39;ll fall asleep halfway thru the first, of which the me or dad will fall asleep too. So I&#39;ll say the only time me and hubby get to really catch up is during dinner and weekend. <br/>
     <br/>
  If he&#39;s being unreasonable with me or dad, my 123 timeout tactic comes into play. We&#39;re ok with son having a totally different opinion from ours, that he&#39;s entitled to not wanting to do what we parents want to do, of which, if possible, we&#39;ll say &quot;ok, we won&#39;t go today, perhaps tomorrow?&quot; If he decides he fancies somethings else for dinner, that&#39;s fine too. But it&#39;s not fine if our son is being totally un-compromising, rude, and snappy at us parents. We&#39;re his parents, not his peers!! Even that of his peers, I would be very cross if he&#39;s being nasty to them. Of which he&#39;ll be send off for a time out to think and reconsider his position within this family hierachy.<br/>
   <br/>
  Not very radical, I supposed but it works fine for us. <br/>

<br/>
But there&#39;s a difference between a list where people discuss what  <br/>
works for them and a list where people discuss ways to work towards  <br/>
radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I assume a lot of people on radical unschooling lists take what they  <br/>
find useful and leave the rest. But this list doesn&#39;t exist to  <br/>
*support* picking and choosing. In other words, what people use the  <br/>
information for is up to them. But the support they can expect here  <br/>
is in helping them figure out how to make radical unschooling work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a matter of providing what the owners want and not wasting  <br/>
people&#39;s time with information they haven&#39;t signed onto the list for.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of places to find &quot;what works for our family.&quot; There  <br/>
aren&#39;t so many places to find how to move closer to fully trusting  <br/>
and respecting children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The ones we keep is exercising our parental rights to make him go  <br/>
&gt; to bed early<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every time you let go of a control and find a better way to help  <br/>
everyone get what they need and want, the more positive the  <br/>
relationship with your son grows.<br/>
<br/>
You have every right to decide it&#39;s too much trouble. It *is* easier  <br/>
for parents to just make a child do what the parents want. If it  <br/>
weren&#39;t, there would be less of a need for this list! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But easiest and most convenient aren&#39;t the only choice. And they do  <br/>
come at a price: each time you do it, it whittles away at your  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
You might have a much better relationship with your son than your  <br/>
neighbor or your parents or your husband&#39;s parents or your best  <br/>
friend. But it could be even better.<br/>
<br/>
What it comes down to is choice: is what you gain worth what you give  <br/>
up? Is the work to figure out how to help everyone get what they want  <br/>
worth the gain in relationship? Is the convenience of imposing the  <br/>
parents&#39; wishes on the child worth the decrease in the relationship?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a question only you can answer for your own life. But the list  <br/>
is for discussing ways to, basically make our lives more difficult  <br/>
(initially) in order to gain a better relationship with our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681379113">Hi Joyce.  I&#39;ve lurked here off and on for a while, and haven&#39;t posted, but your reply here <br/>
prompts me to ask a genuine question.  I totally understand everything you said, and <br/>
honestly, for the first time I totally get why this list can seem to me to be harsh at times.  I <br/>
appreciate your well put explanation of the purpose or mission of this list.  But, in order to <br/>
avoid any possible future faux pas, I have a question: was it inappropriate for Sharon to <br/>
reply as she did given that the original posters questions specifically seemed to ask how <br/>
have others implemented RU, and to what extent they have?  The OP even asked if people <br/>
RU in all areas, or start with some, etc..  So, are you suggesting or saying here that unless <br/>
one can claim to be totally RUing that one should not reply, but rather leave the replying <br/>
to those who have fully embraced and arrived at &quot;successful&quot; RU?  Even though I&#39;ve lurked <br/>
some, I haven&#39;t paid total attention to the &quot;etiquette&quot; of the list.  Is this more of an &quot;Ask the <br/>
Experts&quot; forum, or can others of us share where we&#39;re at in our journeys?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488663188">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking on this list long enough to know that my story <br/>
will just sound like whining to most of you :-). But I am honestly <br/>
looking for advice. I am at a loss about how to proceed in further <br/>
transitioning from unschooling to much more radical unschooling. I <br/>
love the stories I read here about supporting kids through all their <br/>
experimentation with mess, sleep and all their chosen projects, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am a full on attachment mama to a 6 year old dd, a 3 year old dd <br/>
and a 15 month old dd. Everybody nurses and cosleeps and there is a <br/>
lot of night waking. 6 year old dd wets most nights so bedding and <br/>
pjs get changed. 3 year dd wakes to nurse a couple of times and now <br/>
also to use potty. 15 month dd nurses pretty much continually all <br/>
night. Dh works around the clock seven days a week for the last six <br/>
months to earn our way with me staying home. We have no other family <br/>
support as they live far away and/or deeply disapprove of our <br/>
parenting methods. We live in the city and only know families with <br/>
only children who are quite alternative but still quite &#39;schooly&#39;. <br/>
None of them feel up to watching my bunch for even an hour to give me <br/>
a break. Without sleep all my good intentions go out the window and I <br/>
start imposing limits, it tends to be when I am at my limit. We live <br/>
in a small three bedroom apartment (we only use two of the bedrooms <br/>
as dh has all his mechanical/electronic/tools/etc. stuff for his f/x <br/>
robot building, camera motion business stored in bedroom #3) near <br/>
busy streets with no yard. Money is very tight.<br/>
<br/>
I love life with my girls as it is but I want to give them more.<br/>
<br/>
  15 month old dd is into everything, as to be expected. She tries to <br/>
drink out of the toilet before 3 year old dd has had a chance to <br/>
flush. She loves to feed herself everything spread everywhere and <br/>
hates to be cleaned after, but gets eczema all over her face if I <br/>
don&#39;t clean her. She wants to climb everything. We have concrete <br/>
floors. It&#39;s a long way down from the kitchen counter. If I don&#39;t <br/>
clean up all the food she messes around with she&#39;ll eat it the next <br/>
day or week. How much of what she wants to do should I let her?<br/>
<br/>
3 year old dd loves to run wild and free. Near busy traffic or not. <br/>
She has little fear if any of danger to her person. She argues with 6 <br/>
year old dd a lot. They also play together fabulously much of the <br/>
time. Should I drop everything to help them through their arguments. <br/>
Should I trust them to work it out? How much freedom of movement can <br/>
safely you give an exuberant three year old while also attending to <br/>
two other children near busy traffic?<br/>
<br/>
6 year old dd has 20 new projects thought up before breakfast. I love <br/>
this, but how do i find time to help her work on them all. What do I <br/>
do when her sisters keep breaking her creations? What do I do when <br/>
she hits her sisters? How do I guide them all through their joys and <br/>
sorrows and be attentive enough to each child&#39;s needs?  My girls have <br/>
a wonderful loving relationship full of empathy and fun. I am not <br/>
trying to paint them as having dysfunctional behaviour issues. They <br/>
are very respectful and loving to one another. But they are all young <br/>
and in close quarters. Working it out 90% of the time still means <br/>
they have trouble 10% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
How do others with loads of tiny children manage RU? I want to make <br/>
my life more difficult in order to gain a better relationship with my <br/>
kids, but I start losing it at some undetermined point of difficulty. <br/>
How do I give them this? I have given them the gift of each other, <br/>
which they love and cherish. How do I give them RU too? I know there <br/>
is a way. I just need a little more direction.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

from *his* perspective &quot;totally uncompromising&quot;? That&#39;s an important <br/>
question. Especially since you are punishing him when he does this, <br/>
how long before he decides *he&#39;s* going to punish *you*? He can&#39;t <br/>
put you in time-out, but if he&#39;s clever, he&#39;ll definately find ways <br/>
to push your buttons and feel justified doing so. That&#39;s how <br/>
punishment works. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   The ones we keep is exercising our parental rights to make him <br/>

easily excited and bouncing of the walls at 9pm, and can&#39;t seems to <br/>
hear the meaning of &quot;Stop&quot;, then it means he&#39;s out of control <br/>
because his brain is too tired and is short-curcuiting. <br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
How often does this sort of thing happen? Is there a pattern? Maybe <br/>
you can start engaging with him earlier to help him find ways to <br/>
calm himself - offer to play a quiet game or read or watch tv of his <br/>
choice with him, perhaps. <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, some kids have a kind of &quot;energy spike&quot; right before <br/>
they go to sleep - they don&#39;t so much need to calm down as <br/>
to &quot;discharge&quot;. My dd is like this, so we talk about how she tends <br/>
to have a Lot of energy at the same time mom and dad have very <br/>
little. Being aware and talking about it from that perspective helps <br/>
us adults be more supportive of her needs - and it helps *her* <br/>
understand that we aren&#39;t withdrawing from her out of disapproval or <br/>
some-such, we&#39;re Tired. <br/>
<br/>
From time to time Mo goes through a phase of being more independent <br/>
in her nightly bouncing-off-the-walls, and we&#39;ll actually forget, to <br/>
some extent, just how intense this can be. Then, when she&#39;s not <br/>
quite so independent, it seems all the more intense and frustrating <br/>
until one of us remembers &quot;Ohhhhh, its That Time again...&quot;. Just <br/>
that acknowledgement is helpful in reducing our stress levels. Its <br/>
not that our kid is freaking out, its just &quot;That Time again&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We&#39;re his parents, not his peers!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does that mean to you, being someone&#39;s parent? You don&#39;t have <br/>
to answer here, but I know I found it helpful to think about that <br/>
really really carefully. What expectations do you have and what does <br/>
that mean in terms of how you interact with your child? <br/>
<br/>
RU is about partnership with children and building mutual <br/>
relationships. It can&#39;t really work within a hierarchy. That&#39;s not <br/>
to say that RU doesn&#39;t make use of the greater experience and <br/>
broader viewpoints that adulthood (hopefully) gives us, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t assume that every adult viewpoint is automatically broader <br/>
or that every adult experience is applicable to other individuals. <br/>
Many times adults&#39; responses to children are totally reactionary and <br/>
short-sighted - and yet *we* can get away with it bc we&#39;re bigger, <br/>
stronger and have the car-keys. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140111754">Some thoughts after re-reading the previous posts.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of a designated place for them to be if they&#39;re going to<br/>
stay up.  BUT -- we have too much stuff laying out that we don&#39;t want them<br/>
to have access to.  This increases stress, and sets us up for a lot of<br/>
serious negotiations in order to get it back (or a lot of &quot;Nos&quot; and<br/>
arbitrariness -- ick!).  SOOOOOO, if we were to be comfortable with leaving<br/>
either or both awake while we went to sleep, we would need to clear some of<br/>
that stuff out.  It&#39;s difficult to change my thinking from &quot;Why can&#39;t they<br/>
just go to bed?&quot; to &quot;How could we make it so that we&#39;re OK with them being<br/>
up later than me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have been implementing playfulness a lot more for connecting rather than<br/>
force and arbitrariness to &quot;rectify a situation.&quot;<br/>
We&#39;ve found that when they &quot;act up,&quot; they are in need of re-connecting with<br/>
us.  Sometimes being playful is required, sometimes reflecting, sometimes<br/>
just being near, depending upon the situation.  These tend to work whereas<br/>
before we would be &quot;enforcing&quot; or doling out &quot;justice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m rambling here now, so I&#39;ll just sign off.  Any more ideas,<br/>
anyone?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi I have a bit of input. I have seven kids still home ranging in <br/>
age from 17 to 6. I am really, really tired at night and need a good <br/>
nights sleep. I wake up here around 5:30. What we came up with that <br/>
works is no bedtime, but a quiet time. At eleven o clock everyone <br/>
has to go to there own  area, mainly room. I have said they can stay <br/>
up all night, but they need to do quiet activities. They can draw, <br/>
read, watch tv, play video games whatever, but they need to let me <br/>
and dh sleep. <br/>
<br/>
When we first started it, several years ago, we had kids up LATE. <br/>
Now my kids really take care of themselves. They go to bed when they <br/>
are tired and ask to be tucked in. My youngest is generally around <br/>
nine thirty. The kids who want to stay up late are really respectful <br/>
of my needing to sleep and will talk and visit each other quietly if <br/>
they want to share info on a game or some show. <br/>
<br/>
I watched my brothers kids on a recent vacation. They have a very <br/>
strict bedtime and fought it all the way, no matter how tired they <br/>
were. It made me realize how what we are doing really does work.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
I think it helps lots in shifting perspective to move away from  <br/>
trying to get the kids to give what the parents want and working with  <br/>
the kids in finding ways to get everyone&#39;s needs met.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge world of difference between me telling my daughter &quot;I  <br/>
need an hour to do some stuff today so you&#39;ll need to find something  <br/>
to do then,&quot; and &quot;I need an hour to do some stuff today. How can we  <br/>
work that into the schedule?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Make the kids part of the solution rather than making them part of  <br/>
the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042148522">At one time, Arun posted (or blogged it) that whatever it is, it must work<br/>
for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
My take:  Ensure that everyone&#39;s needs are met.  The needs of the many do<br/>
not outweigh the needs of the few.  It IS possible to do this.  Just don&#39;t<br/>
give up when you&#39;ve got MOST people on your side.  It&#39;s too tempting to just<br/>
disregard the other person&#39;s feelings b/c you&#39;ve got size (or sheer numbers<br/>
of people) on your side, and THEN, make THEM feel guilty for disregarding<br/>
the feelings of everyone else (&quot;you can&#39;t just hold up the whole group!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
In practice, I&#39;m slowly getting here.  Anyone else further along on this?<br/>

<br/>
Phew...that&#39;s a tough one sometimes. I can think of instances when<br/>
Jalen wanted something that seemed fairly unreasonable to the rest of<br/>
us and everyone else agreed on a certain course of action. We keep<br/>
talking sometimes. Sometimes we just explain that everyone else is<br/>
hot/tired/hungry etc...(whatever it is) and would REALLY like to go<br/>
get lunch/drinks/go home (fill in the blank again) so we need to think<br/>
about how to make sure nobody is feeling like their needs are ignored. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a challenge. There is no perfection, especially with a large<br/>
family where needs seem to collide at times. Just the fact that<br/>
someone cares, that someone is listening and offering to change things<br/>
up is sometimes enough. You know, when *I&#39;m*<br/>
hot/tired/thirsty/hungry/whatever, I really don&#39;t feel like<br/>
negotiating for an hour to find a solution. Sometimes it&#39;s like<br/>
&quot;here&#39;s what&#39;s happening, let&#39;s just figure this OUT&quot;. <br/>

be totally RUing that one should not reply, but rather leave<br/>
the replying to those who have fully embraced and arrived at<br/>

<br/>
Not at all. I think a useful discussion is a back and forth of<br/>
information which includes a lot of questions and sharing from both<br/>
experienced unschoolers and those seeking to learn more. There is<br/>
definitely an open invitation to everyone here to post. Just be<br/>
prepared for some pretty direct information if what&#39;s posted is in<br/>
opposition to mindful parenting and unschooling. If you&#39;re comfortable<br/>
with questioning and direct language, then it will never be a problem.:)<br/>
<br/>
 ~~Even though I&#39;ve lurked some, I haven&#39;t paid total attention to the<br/>
&quot;etiquette&quot; of the list. Is this more of an &quot;Ask the<br/>
Experts&quot; forum, or can others of us share where we&#39;re at in our<br/>
journeys?~~<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to share your journey with us!! That&#39;s a great use of<br/>
the list. I think when we stumble or have difficulties it can be just<br/>
as useful a learning moment as a fabulous interaction....sometimes<br/>
more.:) When folks get grumpy about this list, it&#39;s usually because<br/>
they posted about something to another person and weren&#39;t prepared for<br/>
the direct and blunt questioning of the information.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean everyone isn&#39;t welcome to post whatever they wish.<br/>
Just be prepared for a horde of gentle parents to come to the defense<br/>
of the child if it&#39;s not respectful!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard to be questioned by a bunch of strangers. I<br/>
certainly didn&#39;t like it when I was new to the lists. Especially since<br/>
I&#39;d been eclectic/relaxed (ie; the most radical of any homeschooler<br/>
I&#39;d ever met) and they were saying I needed to be MORE radical? Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, trust my kids to regulate their own television??? Yikes. I<br/>
thought they were nuts. Sure, I could trust they&#39;d learn anything at<br/>
any time, we&#39;d been non-curriculum crazies from the beginning. Heck,<br/>
I&#39;d been homeschooling as the lone Mum that didn&#39;t worry about<br/>
curriculum or workbooks or tests since 1996! I knew of no one that was<br/>
as relaxed as us. <br/>
<br/>
Enter unschooling.com and a bunch of folks that thought kids COULD<br/>
learn to learn about anything and everything, even television.<br/>
Soooo....it&#39;s hard to be questioned. But we either decide the<br/>
information is valid or not and we incorporate it or ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
Problem for me? The information and questioning wouldn&#39;t leave me<br/>
alone. It nagged inside my head (truth doesn&#39;t just go away) and left<br/>
me questioning more until I really GOT IT. If it wasn&#39;t true...then I<br/>
could have discarded it readily.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am, willing to share with you why and how kids CAN be<br/>
trusted to learn anything and everything they need...from food and<br/>
chores and television to frogs and dye and clouds.:)<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to share whatever you wish. Welcome to the discussion!<br/>
<br/>
OH, and I&#39;m still wondering where the &quot;experts&quot; are.:) Haven&#39;t found<br/>
one yet and if someone were to decide they were an expert I might just<br/>
question their purpose here. We&#39;re a bunch of parents that have<br/>
figured some things out, through our own trial and error and learning<br/>
and just want to share with others so they can shortcut some of the<br/>
pain/struggle that comes with coercion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094901013">~~&gt; How do others with loads of tiny children manage RU? ~~<br/>
<br/>
You know, I have SO much to say about this topic but very little time<br/>
at the moment. I&#39;ll try to get back to this later today if possible. A<br/>
few thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
You do your best and it&#39;s enough. Being there with them, cuddling,<br/>
loving and helping them....that&#39;s unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
What it sounds like to me, is you don&#39;t have any support which can be<br/>
hugely difficult with young children. I would look into finding some<br/>
AP parents to visit at the park occasionally. I would try to find some<br/>
unschoolers to hang out with. Support is really important in this<br/>
journey for our family.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought...are you setting things up to be the least difficult?<br/>
You said a 6y.o. is bed wetting. Why don&#39;t you have pull-ups for this<br/>
child? Or some form of protection so they don&#39;t have to wake up wet<br/>
and uncomfortable? You can always sleep through bed-wetting if you&#39;re<br/>
being proactive. I&#39;ve had two children that couldn&#39;t stay dry through<br/>
the night for a very long time and pull-ups saved our sanity I<br/>
think!:) For both parent and child. It&#39;s not fun waking up wet.<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of being proactive...it&#39;s really hard to sometimes, but<br/>
you need to fill up your cup BEFORE you&#39;re down to the last bit of<br/>
energy/patience/joy.<br/>
<br/>
Three young children is NOT an easy path at times. I have almost four<br/>
years between my children so I don&#39;t know exactly what it&#39;s<br/>
like....though I grew up with five siblings and babysat most of my<br/>
life even nannying as an adult while my own children came with me, so<br/>
I have an idea!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo.....plan ahead. Some good waterplay, playdough, bath fun,<br/>
walks, bubbles and other fun things can get kids distracted in a rough<br/>
moment so you have time to recover your calm. I used to keep a sack of<br/>
Dollar Tree toys hidden way for rough moments. Anything new was enough<br/>
to interest my children and buy me a bit of time to re-connect.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101336782">There are several things I&#39;d like to add re: this thread of posts. <br/>
First to Rob to tell you that you aren&#39;t the only family seeking to <br/>
understand all of this. When I first encountered RU ideas, I thought <br/>
it was really crazy. But, as someone said earlier, truth has a way <br/>
of grabbing hold. Even though I felt skeptical, I felt a magnetic <br/>
attraction to learning more about this. I couldn&#39;t sleep at night <br/>
for entertaining these new ideas--and for staying up late reading <br/>
everything in sight, both online and in print. I do feel like I&#39;ve <br/>
had some major ah-ha&#39;s and there are times when I still don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>
what it would look like or how to do it in certain situations. <br/>
<br/>
Second, thanks to all who have written on this thread. It has been <br/>
one of the most helpful that I have read, somehow targeting many of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know what your friend means by this, and its a different situation <br/>
than what I&#39;m describing - although I can see how the word &quot;spike&quot; <br/>
may have been confusing. Mo&#39;s high-energy time starts around 6pm and <br/>
it *is* happy play, its just sort of....supercharged. Its not a <br/>
response to over-tiredness, although I&#39;ve seen her have that sort of <br/>
reaction, too. Not that I&#39;m trying to disparage *your* experience! <br/>
Just clarifying (I hope).<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;delirium&quot; reaction can sometimes be triggered by food, btw. I <br/>
don&#39;t mean in a food-sensitivity sort of way, rather that some foods <br/>
are easier to digest and have different effects at different times <br/>
of day. Some kids will have more difficulty settling down to sleep <br/>
if they eat certain foods an hour before - but *which* foods can <br/>
vary tremendously. Its something to look at, though, as a factor, <br/>
especially if there&#39;s sort-of a pattern, but not consistent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She explained that when the body is overly tired it goes into a  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids do this when they&#39;re overstimulated in general - too many <br/>
people or too much going on, or whatever. It can also happen when a <br/>
body needs some protein.<br/>
<br/>
The tricky part, from an RU perspective, is what to *do* about it. <br/>
Figuring that out can take some experimentation, which may mean some <br/>
candid conversations about the fact that mom and dad are just <br/>
guessing! That admission is a big part of what makes this sort of <br/>
problem solving respectful (and different) - we (adults) aren&#39;t <br/>
coming down and saying &quot;This is what We&#39;re going to do!&quot; we&#39;re <br/>
saying &quot;I have an idea I&#39;d like to try for a little and see if it <br/>
helps.&quot; <br/>

fantasies! - about how we would like our lives with out kids <br/>
to &quot;look&quot;. There are plenty of parenting strategies out there aimed <br/>
at fitting children into those expectations, too - the one that <br/>
comes to *my* mind is the philosophy of surrounding children with <br/>
beautiful things and teaching them to be careful and respectful of <br/>
those things. It was a big shift for me to step back from those <br/>
expectations, even when I could see how they were impeding my kids&#39; <br/>
autonomy. <br/>

That&#39;s a really lovely reframing of the idea that &quot;kids act up to <br/>
get attention&quot;. Very positive spin on that old saw - I like that. I <br/>
find it really useful, talking with my conventional parenting <br/>
friends, to be able to re-state those sorts of truisms from a <br/>
different perspective. <br/>

me but at the same time he seems to learn so much during this time. He <br/>
gobbles up games, puzzles, activities. We play Katamino, Monopoly <br/>
Junior, play a kid&#39;s version of Poker (Target) and he just keeps <br/>
frenetically pulling the games out. I&#39;ve just given in to staying <br/>
up &#39;til 11 with him sometimes. I think the biggest reason he does it is <br/>
because Quinn is asleep and he has one-on-one mommy or daddy (or both) <br/>
time. Just like he did before Quinn was born. He adores his brother but <br/>
he still remembers (and longs for) the time when it was just the three <br/>
of us.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly though, he&#39;ll do this for three or four nights in a row <br/>
and then go to bed really early one night and sleep for about 12 hours <br/>
(he usually only sleeps for 10 or so). Then mommy and daddy finally get <br/>
our time ; )<br/>

I just wanted to add that there is an Unschooling Canada group. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling_Canada/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling_Canada/</a> Really great bunch. <br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of how you can get more support. Perhaps you could <br/>
post to see if there are other unschoolers close to where you live to <br/>
meet up with to help lighten your load.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I don&#39;t think you are whining at all! Your situation sounds <br/>
exhausting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me it is not bedtime at a certain hour but when I can see they <br/>
are getting ready to wind down. My girls are 4 and 2 and we do not <br/>
co-sleep but the 4 yr old would sleep next to our bed whenever she <br/>
needed to. Now she &quot;sleeps&quot; on the couch since she also has <br/>
allergies and needed to be proped up at night or she just coughs all <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
But this is what the evening looks like. We go outside from about <br/>
7:30 till almost 9:30 (we live in Utah and that is when it cools <br/>
off) and I *suggest* baths since they are sweaty and sometimes <br/>
sandy. Most the time they both take a shower and get into something <br/>
to sleep in. We have a snack if they are hungry and I also *suggest* <br/>
teeth brushing and going potty. Usually I will then offer to read <br/>
books. If the little one is obviously tired I will ask her is she <br/>
wants books or to lay down. If she wants books sometimes big sister <br/>
joins us. If not I lay down with her in her bed till alseep. Big <br/>
sister usually watches tv with daddy and will eventually say I am <br/>
tired I need a rest and will lay down on the couch and fall alseep. <br/>
This all may not be acomplished until 11:30 at night. <br/>
<br/>
I realized early on that keeping them up till they were tired  and <br/>
then having them fall asleep quickly was better than fighting with <br/>
them till 10:oo anyway. <br/>
<br/>
So best advice is to start slow. Watch them to see when the act <br/>
tired and then do bedish stuff and take it slow. I realized that <br/>
children do not have to fall asleep in their beds and I remember a <br/>
quote from I think Sandra Dodd that when asked when Kirby? when to <br/>
bed they would say a half hour after he falls alsleep. I remember <br/>
that now when I think bedtime should happen a certain way. We as <br/>
adults know when we should get our butts to bed and I think kids do <br/>
too if we just let them.</div>
