<div id="ygrps-yiv-576143609">Dear Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Apologies once again for the cross-posting.  Again, my goal is to <br/>
reach as many folks in the unschooling community as I can.  Lisa and <br/>
her family (Larry, husband, and Roxanne & Fire), really need every <br/>
bit of positive energy flowing their way as possible.  If this is the <br/>
first you&#39;re hearing about this, please see below for a brief <br/>
synopsis of what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooler here in New York has organized a regular weekly healing <br/>
meditation time for Lisa, and I am forwarding her message to you now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a small group of us that have decided to have a weekly <br/>
&gt;meditation for Lisa.  We have chosen Sunday evenings at 6 pm (EST) <br/>
&gt;for about a half hour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last Sunday there were 8 of us doing a guided visual meditation <br/>
&gt;sending out lots of positive energy, positive thoughts, lots of <br/>
&gt;light and balance.  I was thinking that if we could have as many people<br/>
&gt;as possible join us &quot;virtually&quot; we could give Lisa a tremendous surge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So wherever you are on Sunday evenings at 6 pm (EST) would you take <br/>
&gt;a few minutes to just think of Lisa and see her as the strong, <br/>
&gt;beautiful, creative, vibrant, loving woman she is.  Send her your <br/>
&gt;prayer, meditation, visualization, energy, light or whatever else <br/>
&gt;you may have to share.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In love & light,<br/>
&gt;In peace & harmony,<br/>
&gt;Jean McGee<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to add that sending a dose of positive, healing energy <br/>
to Larry and Roxanne and Ruby would probably be a good thing, too, <br/>
and of course, Reiki practitioners are wholeheartedly encouraged to <br/>
do their thing, too!<br/>
<br/>
Very briefly, for folks who don&#39;t know, Lisa Heyman is an unschooling <br/>
mom who lives in New York State.  She has been a passionate, <br/>
unwavering, intelligent advocate and has been active on many of these <br/>
lists.  She has attended, participated in, and/or spoke at several <br/>
L&L and Northeast Unschooling Conferences that I know of.  Very <br/>
recently, after an extended period of uncertainty about what has been <br/>
going on with her, Lisa finally received a diagnosis of amyloidoisis <br/>
(for information about amyloidosis, please see the link below), which <br/>
has caused grave, docs say irreversible damage to her heart.  The <br/>
prognosis for amyloidosis tends not to be very good at all.  However, <br/>
Lisa is a strong, young, healthy, vital person, and I believe that if <br/>
anyone can disprove a prognosis like that, it&#39;d be Lisa!<br/>

<br/>
If you would like to contact Lisa or if you have any questions, <br/>
please contact me off list.  Lisa is in the hospital now, and she&#39;s <br/>
hanging in there.  Please do forward this message to anyone you feel <br/>
would want to know about this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and apologies again for the redundant messages.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
