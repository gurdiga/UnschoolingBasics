<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054464687">When: Friday June 24 to Thursday June 30, 2011<br/>
<br/>
Where: Camp Tamaracouta, in Mille Isles, Quebec (a bit over an hour from Montreal)<br/>
<br/>
What: This is a gathering of unschoolers (kids, teens, young adults, adults: aka, this is an event for all ages!), where we can laugh and play and have long discussions and take hikes and hang out in the beautiful city of Montreal! This is not a conference. There will not be speakers. There will, however, be as many planned activities as the attendees want to organize, which can be anything from round table discussions, to crafts, games, and potluck dinners.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second annual Summer Montreal Unschoolers Gathering (SMUG). Last year was a huge success, with around 70 people, all of whom seemed to have a great time! I know that my family is really looking forward to having as wonderful a gathering this year, and I hope you can join us in helping to make that happen!<br/>
