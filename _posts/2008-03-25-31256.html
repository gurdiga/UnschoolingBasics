<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711660611">I&#39;ve got an 8yo just about to come out of school for an &#39;unschooling trial&#39;.<br/>
She loves her two little brothers (2 and 4), but gets sick of them,<br/>
especially the 4 year old who is autistic and who tends to yell a lot and<br/>
talk about Thomas the Tank Engine ad infinitum.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit concerned that our unschooling adventure could get derailed<br/>
because she just won&#39;t be able to spend that much time with her brother<br/>
happily and would prefer to be out of the house with friends who are more<br/>
like herself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any tips for how to keep them living happily together, while giving each one<br/>
what they need and want?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, cecily<br/>
