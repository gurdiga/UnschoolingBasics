ucky--if she were actually smooching them I might be a little more  uncomfortable <br/>
with the idea. Is that hypocritical or am I just being realistic?!  lol&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
LOLOL  Yeah, both :)<br/>
 <br/>
The cool thing, if you maintain communication with your kid, is that  they&#39;ll <br/>
TELL you what&#39;s happening in their lives. My 17 year old son&#39;s father  <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe that, but it&#39;s true. <br/>
 <br/>
Many of us parents of teens have had conversations that yes, it IS hard,  but <br/>
then we get so amazed with the maturity and honesty of our kids. <br/>
 <br/>
Julian&#39;s unschooled girlfriend, Jessica, 14, is here for the summer from  <br/>
Arkansas. We&#39;re in Massachusetts. There is so much trust involved here:  <br/>
Jessica&#39;s parents are trusting her away from them for a couple of months, with  her <br/>
boyfriend, far from home. They are trusting us to take good care of her. All  <br/>
the parents trust both these kids to make good decisions, and the  kids trust us <br/>
to talk to us. <br/>
 <br/>
They are lovely together. They are kind and respectful and silly and fun.  <br/>
Neither is EVER jealous of the other -- they trust each other with their hearts. <br/>
 They are young, so it&#39;s impossible to say that this is a permanent <br/>
relationship  (can you ever?), but it&#39;s very clear that both of them have remarkable  <br/>
intelligence about relationships. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a very cool thing to watch.<br/>
