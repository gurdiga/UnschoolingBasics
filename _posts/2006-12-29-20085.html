<div id="ygrps-yiv-293491425">Yesterday I was balancing the checkbook and wondering where it all<br/>
goes?!!! I decided to pull up a report on our grocery spending and<br/>
found that we were spending over twice our budget on groceries the<br/>
last few months. I know it included other things like diapers,<br/>
shampoo, laundry soap, etc., but this is a major leak. I realize how<br/>
wasteful we seem to be when I sit and think about it - it&#39;s like<br/>
throwing away money. So my goal, which I plan to make a game of, is<br/>
to cut down on the $$ leak via the groceries.<br/>
<br/>
While trying to find information on eating healthy and cheap on the<br/>
web, I ran across a lot of &#39;once a month cooking&#39; sites and plans.<br/>
Is there any one here who does this or has had experience with cooking<br/>
ahead? I don&#39;t know if I could cook one months worth of food, but I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind trying a weeks worth.<br/>
<br/>
Through my research, I ran across &#39;Dine on a Dime Cookbook&#39;. - Which<br/>
brought me to this site that I would like to share that seems to have<br/>
some helpful hints. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingonadime.com/index.html">http://www.livingonadime.com/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I looked at the cookbook on Amazon.com. (I buy mostly all my books<br/>
there or check out books there first because I can look inside and<br/>
read some of it first to see if I&#39;ll like it.) The cookbook had really<br/>
great ratings and reader reviews compared to some of the other books I<br/>
was looking at - so I bought it. Does any one else here already have<br/>
this book?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m aware that this seems to be off the &#39;unschooling&#39; topic, but I<br/>
think this is going to be fun for the family to be more creative with<br/>
our food and money.<br/>
<br/>
My New Year resolution for all areas of my life is &#39;Simplify&#39;!<br/>

<br/>
Well, I can&#39;t say much on the grocery end of things, because we&#39;re<br/>
pretty cheap in our preferences.  And the things I eat the most of are<br/>
perishable (my diet is high in fresh fruit and salads).  So try to find<br/>
ways to save money on your particular favorites and preferences.<br/>
Variants of the OAMC (once a month cooking) that you mentioned are a<br/>
favorite of many people I am acquainted with.<br/>
<br/>
Diapers, we used cloth and washed them ourselves.  We occasionally had<br/>
some disposables in a pinch, but 90% of our diapers were the re-usable<br/>
kind :)<br/>
<br/>
But we save a ton of money on household cleaners.  We threw out all the<br/>
chemical stuff and replaced it all with vinegar, baking soda, and plain<br/>
old hot water (homemade cleaning recipes are very easy to find on the<br/>
internet and vinegar does not stink up the house, it actually absorbs<br/>
smells then vanishes, much like baking soda does).<br/>
<br/>
We also are extremely miserly on how much laundry detergent we put in<br/>
our machine (we use the $$$ unscented environmentally conscious stuff,<br/>
and even then I spend way less than I used to.).  We just kept adding<br/>
less and less detergent as time wore on and experimented with how clean<br/>
and fresh smelling it was, and sure enough, it was terrific with a very<br/>
miserly 1/8 cup (2 tbsp) per LARGE load.<br/>
<br/>
These might seem like little ways, but every bit does help.  Use among<br/>
those suggestions those which strike you as the most practical for you.<br/>

PS Did anybody see my introduction(s)?  I know I posted during a busy<br/>
time of year, but just wanted to respect the preferences of this group<br/>
and try not to &quot;make myself at home&quot; before introducing myself properly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733704320">My first thought was, grow your own!  Gardening is such a joy, and<br/>
it&#39;s a wonderful skill for kids to learn as they grow.  The<br/>
responsibility of tending plants is real, and the kids know it.  And,<br/>
being able to eat the fruits of your labor, so to speak, makes it all<br/>
the more fun!  <br/>
<br/>
My son (8.5) and I have just started a garden here in Texas, and I<br/>
can&#39;t say we know what we&#39;re doing, yet, but it&#39;s certainly been an<br/>
adventure.  Now, I&#39;m looking into learning how to can so that we can<br/>
enjoy the veggies all year long!  I think it might really cut down on<br/>
our grocery bill....<br/>

Hi Shannon....<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a family of five plus two pets, on one salary so I look for <br/>
ways to make our money go further.  <br/>
<br/>
The biggest way I save on groceries is to combine coupons with what <br/>
is on sale and their loss leaders (loss leaders are the few items <br/>
the store puts on deep discount-usually just to get you in the <br/>
store). I save 30-60% on my grocery bill just by doing that alone. I <br/>
buy several copies of the Sunday paper (only when they have coupons-<br/>
never on a holiday weekend) and then go through the flyers for the <br/>
two stores near me. I look for things that we would normally buy, <br/>
that are on sale and that I have coupons for and I stock up. It may <br/>
sound like a lot of time, but it only takes about an hour. <br/>
<br/>
Another way we save is to have an extra freezer. We bought an <br/>
upright (19 cubic feet) and when meat or poultry are on sale, I buy <br/>
as many as I can (as many as the store or my budget will allow) and <br/>
store it.  <br/>
<br/>
Also when a sale item is not on the shelves, I ask for rainchecks <br/>
and then use them when they&#39;re in stock again. Especially if it&#39;s <br/>
one of their loss leaders. If I can use coupons on top of it, I <br/>
always do.  <br/>
<br/>
I also make a lot of my own household cleaners. Not only are they <br/>
envionmentally friendly, it saves quite a bit of money. <br/>
<br/>
I have a few posts on my blog that may be of interest to you. There <br/>
are a few recipes for household cleaners there as well. Here&#39;s the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940964856">We rely on alot on  coupons, sales, and no-name brands. We also switch<br/>
brands of foods depending on the sales. There are some products I buy<br/>
only one name brand, but mostly, I buy whatever is the cheapest. We<br/>
also buy alot from BJ&#39;s (local warehouse, like Sam&#39;s club) and from<br/>
walmart. I buy meat, cereal, baking products, and snacks in bulk and<br/>
then pack them in smaller portions. This saves alot of money.  We have<br/>
a family of 5 and we spend about $300 a month on groceries. That<br/>
includes most of the cleaning and hygeine products too. We eat alot of<br/>
fresh fruit and dairy products, which can be expensive. We drink<br/>
mostly water and milk. Very little juice (that saves mega money). I<br/>
buy cakes and cookies on occasion but mostly bake them myself from<br/>
scratch. <br/>
<br/>
Coupons can really help. And if the week&#39;s coupons are particularly<br/>
good, I&#39;ll go out and buy more sunday papers. the $1.50 I spend on the<br/>
paper is well worth it if there are alot of good coupons.  In years<br/>
past, I participated in coupon swaps. Sometimes your local library has<br/>
this - a box filled with coupons. You take and leave what you want. <br/>
<br/>
I have looked at the once-a-month and once-a-week cooking guides. I<br/>
know I couldn&#39;t do it. It&#39;s just not me. And certainly not my family.<br/>
We are very basic in our eating. They don&#39;t like casseroles, stews, etc. <br/>
<br/>
As for other areas of our life, we do very little take-out and dining<br/>
out. When we do, we look for the specials (one steak resturant does<br/>
kids free night so we take advantage of that). Most of their clothes<br/>
are either from consignment sales (gently worn) or bought by<br/>
relatives. We are not desperate for money. We could afford to buy all<br/>
new clothes but I am philosophically apposed to it. Why buy new,<br/>
wasting more money, and environmental resources, when there are so<br/>
many gently worn clothes available. Then again, I have been lucky to<br/>
live in areas with good consign stores and events. The same for many<br/>
of the toys the kids have, though I do buy new toys often because I<br/>
don&#39;t want to wait for another consignment sale to buy a particular toy.  <br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435366247">We have a pretty hectic schedule and found that we were way <br/>
overspending on groceries and eating out.  One of the things we <br/>
started to doing to save money, sanity, and time is that we cook on <br/>
the nights that we are home and make sure that there is enough for <br/>
leftovers.  Then on nights when we know we will be pressed for time, <br/>
we just have to reheat something.  It has really helped.  We are <br/>
still only cooking 3-4 nights a week, but at least we are not eating <br/>
out the other days.  <br/>
<br/>
Plus we buy our meat in bulk at Sam&#39;s Club, so if we cook it in <br/>
larger quanities it doesn&#39;t have a chance to spoil...and we don&#39;t <br/>
have to worry about separating and rebagging everything right away.<br/>
<br/>
As a result we have learned to make some wonderful soups out of our <br/>
leftovers (roast beef into beef vegetable soup/stew) and have <br/>
learned to make some pretty awesome salads (topped with left over <br/>
roast pork or chicken)....mmmmm.  If we have steak or skinless <br/>
chicken, we can easily convert them into stir-fry or fajitas.  Meat <br/>
marinara is used for a chilli base or for pizza.  <br/>
<br/>
The possiblities are endless...it&#39;s a new adventure for us to figure <br/>
out how many meals we can make out of one original.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gives you some ideas.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is totally unschooling.  Our kids need to learn how to <br/>
budget and save in all areas and learn how to shop, cook and grow <br/>
their own food..<br/>
<br/>
I did the same thing yesterday.  I sat down with my kids and <br/>
completely went over our budget and spending plan.  We spent a total <br/>
of $5,558.38 last year on groceries, or an average of $463.19 a <br/>
month.  We are a family of five, me, husband and three teenagers, 21, <br/>
15 and 12.  That amount also includes all of our household products <br/>
like laundry soap, shampoo, toilet paper, etc.  I would also like to <br/>
cut that amount to around $400.00/month.  I am going to make my garden <br/>
bigger this year and try to can more things, like jams/jellies, tomato <br/>
sauce and dry some more herbs.<br/>
<br/>
I like to involve my kids with the menus and cooking.  That way they <br/>
get to learn how to eat and cook healthy and I am also not wasting <br/>
food by feeding them something they just don&#39;t like.  We use all <br/>
organic items (which can be expensive in itself) and have learned to <br/>
do without meat a few nights a week.  We eat a lot of pasta, fresh <br/>
fruits and vegetables, salads, soup and sandwiches.  We try to make it <br/>
fun by keeping all different types of salads, fruit salads, macaroni <br/>
salad, potatoe salads, cut up vegetables and regular salad that can be <br/>
used with a lot of meals and mix and match.  I don&#39;t keep a lot of <br/>
meat in the freezer, because, like I stated before, we don&#39;t eat a lot <br/>
of meat, but I do make up extras of muffins, twice baked potatoes, <br/>
individual sizes of lasagna (when I make a large one) and then freeze <br/>
them for quick and simple meals when we are running behind on time.<br/>
<br/>
I think our biggest leak, in our budget, is entertainment and cell <br/>
phones.  The cost of cable for t.v., the internet, blockbuster and <br/>
cell phones takes a big bite out of our budget, which I am working on <br/>
to lower.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am with you.  I am involving my family in my plan of attack and <br/>
to be more conscience of our leaks in our budget and spending plan.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603927849">I just came across a link I was trying to find. It is a site that<br/>
promotes a book on saving money on groceries. It mainly talks about<br/>
how to capitalize on sales and coupons, but it&#39;s a whole plan,<br/>
including setting up a special coupon book.  The author is local to<br/>
me, NC and has done workshops with a few groups in my area. A few<br/>
friends of mine have gone to them and thought the system was really<br/>
good. I looked at it and it seemed like a little too much work for me<br/>
- actively searching for internet coupons, rebates, going to 2-4<br/>
different grocery stores each week.  Too much for me, BUT - if you are<br/>
really serious about needing to save money, it may be just what you&#39;re<br/>
looking for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337292832">You&#39;ve gotten a lot of great suggestions here so I won&#39;t be<br/>
repetitive. The one thing I will add is something that has worked for<br/>
me to give me a sense of control. It&#39;s envelope budgeting. You figure<br/>
out a monthly amount you can spend on the categories that work for<br/>
you. I have Groceries, Household (for cleaners, bags, and the like),<br/>
Cosmetics, and Pets/Babies (for pet food, diapers, etc.) I actually<br/>
take out a set amount each month and then split that so it covers a<br/>
two week period. That keeps me from running too low at the end of the<br/>
month although there is usually a bit of a stretch at the end. But I<br/>
find using cash keeps me in line.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786539536">Had to toss in my 2 cents worth. ;) We used to go way over on our grocery spending until we came up with the idea to use cash. I get $100 cash each week to spend on groceries. When the money is gone... it&#39;s gone. It forced me to be much more efficient with my spending, and really think about what I&#39;m buying when I&#39;m in the store. Coupons help, planning meals help, comparative shopping helps, but the biggie for us was using cash.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526365416">Hi Maisha<br/>
 <br/>
I shop at Meijers (they carry all natural meats, without added antibiotics and hormones) and Whole Foods for my meat, Kroger for my produce and basic items like organic spagetti sauce, pasta, etc. (they carry organic produce usually cheaper than Whole Foods).  We grow some of our own vegetables and fruit through the summer months and shop at local farmers markets.  But, basically, Meijers, Kroger and Whole Foods are the stores I use.  Meijers and Kroger carry organic items.  We get our milk and cheese from a local organic dairy farm so that it doesn&#39;t contain added hormones and antibiotics.<br/>
 <br/>
I also use coupons and combine them with sales.  I consider this one of my jobs.  My family doesn&#39;t do anything without a coupon.  I like to keep as much of my money as possible while still eating well.  We really work around coupons, but don&#39;t deprive ourselve if we want something, though.  I also cook a lot of food from scratch.  It is a lot healthier and cheaper.  I keep all organic staples and baking needs in my house.  When it is on sale, I purchase it, whether I need it right then or not, unless I have an abundance.<br/>
 <br/>
Funny thing, my oldest son (21) asked me what I wanted for Christmas.  I said &quot;I didn&#39;t need a thing&quot;.  He said &quot;I bet you would love a whole envelope full of coupons&quot;.  You bet I would.<br/>
 <br/>
But, I, myself, am still going to try to bring my grocery spending down without feeling deprived, but doing more canning, freezing and drying this year.<br/>

<br/>
We spent a total <br/>
of $5,558.38 last year on groceries, or an average of $463.19 a <br/>
month. We are a family of five, me, husband and three teenagers, 21, <br/>
15 and 12. That amount also includes all of our household products <br/>
like laundry soap, shampoo, toilet paper, etc. <br/>
*******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Where do you shop???? I spend over $700 a month on groceries for the seven of us. Clearly I am doing something wrong.....<br/>

I think so too.  After I posted it, I thought wait a minute, this is<br/>
unschooly.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These will be my next target after I get the grocery thing under control.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everybody for their input.  <br/>
<br/>
We do most of our shopping  at Trader Joe&#39;s and they don&#39;t have<br/>
coupons.  We also shop at Sunflower and I have seen ads for sale items<br/>
in their mailers.  I&#39;ll keep an eye out for deals.  I also know of<br/>
people who buy things just because they have a coupon for it or there<br/>
is a sale, to me that&#39;s not saving money either, it rather defeats the<br/>
purpose if it&#39;s not something that&#39;s regularly used.<br/>
<br/>
We eat pretty healthy. -Not the standard American diet.  I read all<br/>
the labels. It&#39;s a rare occasion when we go out to eat.  My dh is very<br/>
sensitive to MSG and salt, so it&#39;s not worth paying a lot of money<br/>
just to feel bad later.  We have a hard time with finding restaurants<br/>
that have truly healthy options.  We have the same struggle when we go<br/>
eat at relatives&#39; homes.  <br/>
<br/>
The expense over the last few months is for groceries only, not<br/>
including eating out.<br/>
<br/>
I think what is costing so much is the lack of preparation and impulse<br/>
items.  I can see that there are other areas, such as, buying a bag of<br/>
lettuce opposed to a head of lettuce.  I usually justify the $1.99<br/>
because it is organic and already prepared - I don&#39;t have to wash and<br/>
cut it.  BUT - I&#39;m going to change that too.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to include my kids in the menu planning also.  I think<br/>
they may be too young?  My oldest is 4 and he is extremely picky. <br/>
When he was his brother&#39;s age (1), he would eat everything.  Now if<br/>
it&#39;s got anything green in it, he won&#39;t touch it.  I don&#39;t know where<br/>
he got it from??  I know he likes to help with preparing meals, so<br/>
maybe he would like planning them also.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 5yr old dd is very conservative wrt what she eats, since she was <br/>
3.5 or so. Before then she was very open to exploring new foods. She <br/>
usually doesn&#39;t have &quot;meals&quot; with us, although she sometimes likes to <br/>
sit and hang out while we eat. She often comes shopping, though, and <br/>
we ask for her input on foods we think she&#39;d like. My stepson, 13, has <br/>
always eaten anything and everything - although he does have definate <br/>
preferences and enjoys being able to have input on meal planning and <br/>
groceries.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513984557">Okay, I&#39;ll throw my 2 cents in as well. Using cash has been the <br/>
biggest saver for me as well. I get $200 every 2 weeks and this <br/>
has to cover gas in my car, groceries, toiletries, and any extras.<br/>
My game plan is that anything I don&#39;t spend is mine to keep,<br/>
 call it a &quot;bonus&quot;.<br/>
 I don&#39;t make menus or clip coupons, just shop by what&#39;s on sale, and <br/>
cook from what I have. We don&#39;t eat any convenience foods or eat out.<br/>
By doing this I have reduced my grocery expenditures to under $300<br/>
a month for 4 people and a chihuahua.<br/>
The kids have gotten involved and gone to the grocery store to help<br/>
calculate cost per unit as well as total spent, they know that the <br/>
less we spend on food the more we have for other things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17573771">Here are my two cents as well!!  As another said, I feel it&#39;s part of my &quot;job&quot; to do the best I can with our family&#39;s money (I do most of the shopping!).  <br/>
   <br/>
  I found that planning each evening meal has **really** helped lower our budget!!  I used to believe that if we were out of something it needed to be replaced.  Not now.  Only if it&#39;s needed (or requested by someone else).  I also found that a well stocked pantry that some &quot;experts&quot; tout intimidated me with all sorts of choices versus 5 - 7 meals which were ready to go.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I buy dry beans and cook them myself in bulk and freeze them in 1 1/2 - 2 cup portions.  How easy is it to take them out of the freezer!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Most chain grocery stores really do have a rotating 4 week schedule of what they&#39;ll put on sale.  So, I buy it that way.  Bread when it&#39;s on sale, buttery spread, pasta, etc.  If you keep your receipts and/or your circulars, you&#39;ll start to notice a pattern as well.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Except for mac & cheese, potato chips, and occasional cereal, we buy nothing premade.  This not only saves us money, but tastes better too!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  At times, I will go to a second grocery store for a sale.  We also buy most of our cheese at Target.  We try to combine trips and talk about errands we can run at the same time to both lessen the amount of gas we use and to think about the planet as well.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I shop with a list and try not to stray.  I *do* solicit requests for food items and fill as many as I am able (up to and including while shopping).  If we&#39;ve hit &quot;max&quot; for the week, we try ways around it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We don&#39;t shop at whole/natural foods stores (yet!!).  I&#39;m in the process of visiting those to figure them out and their pricing. This coincides with our family&#39;s journey into organics.  We do have an expanding aspiring organic garden in warm months.  This alone has been an amazing experience for all of us!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  We don&#39;t eat much meat (I eat almost none) which also helps out in the budget.  I also borrow Moosewood and Vegetarian Times cookbooks from the library and make things that sound intersting.  When dh comes home and it&#39;s a new something for dinner he asks if it&#39;s Moosewood or Vegetarian Times.  Poor guy.  Used to be a carnivore (yep. no veggies, little fruit)<br/>
   <br/>
  We spend about $250 per month on groceries.  The bulk of that is easily on produce.  <br/>
<br/>
  Although it may sound anal, I kept a price book (a running list of items we use and their prices, sizes, and brands at several stores) for some time.  This really helped me to see where things were cheapest and enabled me to save even more.  Some times those stores who touted the best prices weren&#39;t always the best places.  It was enlightening.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope some of this helps!!  Great topic!!  <br/>
