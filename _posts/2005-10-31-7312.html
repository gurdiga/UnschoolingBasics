That is  just down-right cruel! Geesh, talk about having an &quot;open&quot; mind.   <br/>
Discrimination just leaves such a sour taste.... I&#39;ve been the brunt of  way <br/>
too  <br/>
much of it. But to blatantly change a group like that is  pitiful... My <br/>
husband  <br/>
was raised by two moms and he&#39;s probably the  most sensitive, in-tune with <br/>
his <br/>
feminine side guy. AND he was a semi-pro  football player. Nothing wrong with <br/>
him. <br/>
UGH... sorry, that just  really fired me up LOL  <br/>

Yes, it was bizarre. I figure they thought they were inclusive because they  <br/>
didn&#39;t require a statement of faith. They apparently didn&#39;t mean THAT <br/>
inclusive!  LOL<br/>
