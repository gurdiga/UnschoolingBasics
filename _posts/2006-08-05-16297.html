<div id="ygrps-yiv-835445946">My mom has really been asking me a lot of questions lately about<br/>
unschooling.  I know she is concerned about how the children will go to<br/>
college and &quot;complete&quot; their education.  I braced myself this week to be on<br/>
the defensive and actually found my mom asking some really &quot;I&#39;m trying to<br/>
understand what you are doing&quot; type questions.  I want to help her have a<br/>
bit more insight to why we love unschooling and why we are doing what we are<br/>
doing.  Rather than give her a book (which may be more than she has time for<br/>
right now) I thought that I would make up a list of a few unschooling web<br/>
pages and articles that she could read a bit at a time and see various<br/>
aspects and viewpoints.  I also would like to point her to some direct pages<br/>
from Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.  So, here is where you all come in.  Send me<br/>
(either on the list or privately, doesn&#39;t matter) the url&#39;s to specific<br/>
articles that you have found helpful in explaining unschooling and that gave<br/>
you a deeper understanding of how this really works.  I&#39;ve got a few in<br/>
mind, but would like to give her about a dozen or so specific articles that<br/>
from there she could branch out.  I think she has finally gotten it into her<br/>
head that nothing she offers (such as paid tuition at a private school) or<br/>
suggests (such as the really cool art program at such-n-such magnet school)<br/>
will sway me from doing what I am doing.  So now she wants to understand it<br/>
better.<br/>
