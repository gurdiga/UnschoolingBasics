<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081815395">Hello, my name is Kolein.  I have two boys, ages, just 6 and one turning 3 next week.  I am <br/>
a SAHM.  I would like to find out more about unschooling without reading another book!  <br/>
(smiles!)  Currently I&#39;m looking at The Unschooling Handbook.  I find this style to be much <br/>
freer than the way I was taught.  However, &quot;unlearning&quot; how I&#39;ve been taught is an ongoing <br/>
challenge.  I am looking for ways to teach my children by learning about who they are.  I <br/>
need help though.  We have implemented many Montessori materials/presentations in our <br/>
classroom as well as the hands on daily activities of life in our home and outside.<br/>
<br/>
I do not make homemade bread, nor do I have an organic garden.  And I&#39;ve occasionally <br/>
thrown plastic in the garbage.  However, my children are loved and involved in every <br/>
aspect of our life...cooking, cleaning, recreation, reading, music.  I was raised in a home <br/>
where everyone screamed and fought a lot.  I choose to have a gentler life now.  I want <br/>
that for my children and husband, too.  I feel that can be accomplished.  I believe it to be <br/>
by way of my homeschooling approach which is a HUGE factor in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I am much nicer than this post sounds (after re-reading it!).  I have my defenses up <br/>
because I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about their <br/>
approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan!  LOL!  I feel a bit safer &quot;talking&quot; <br/>
about it here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is as well as how to fill out <br/>
the proper paperwork for the school district, if your not sitting down teaching geometry???<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

Kolein, this cracked me up!  :)<br/>

I don&#39;t have time to comment on the rest right now, but just wanted to  <br/>
assure you that we are not all super crunchy.  I do know some unschoolers  living <br/>
in suburban tract homes!  (Is &quot;tract&quot; the right word, or is it  track?....ah <br/>
well).<br/>

Kolein,<br/>
I believe you have defined unschooling in this sentence.  One could<br/>
technically go on and create a much wordier definition, but the real nuts<br/>
and bolts of it is simply living a rich, joyful life with your<br/>
children.period.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 boys, 7, 5, and 2.  We&#39;ve continued on with our attachment<br/>
parenting lifestyle that we chose when they were born.  We trust them and<br/>
respect them and listen to them.  Just because they turn 5 doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
stopped doing any of those things.  It&#39;s really beautiful, this life that we<br/>
can live if we make the choice to follow our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Just LIVE with your children.  Fully and intentionally and unconditionally.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your journey,<br/>

You will need to deschool yourself, but hopefully you won&#39;t have to<br/>
deschool your kids (too much).  As for others, I think we are all<br/>
passionate about the way in which we are raising our children.  I also<br/>
don&#39;t think that you can &quot;half unschool&quot; children.  Either you are<br/>
unschooling or  you are doing something else (self-directed studies<br/>
perhaps).  Unschooling is so much more than just how we help our<br/>
children gain information.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we would only be &quot;sitting down teaching geometry&quot; if our child<br/>
asked to learn geometry.  Geometry can be learned from all kinds of<br/>
ways other than sitting at a table with work books.  Sewing, quilting,<br/>
building gardens, making gingerbread houses, making a tree house,<br/>
building a kite, getting recycling into a box, sorting the pantry, etc<br/>
etc etc.  Unschooling (at least for us) is living our lives fully and<br/>
following our interests while trusting that we will learn the things<br/>
that we need to learn as we have need for them.  There is more to it<br/>
than that, but that is my definition in a nutshell.  Others will have<br/>
broader or narrower or different definitions and what they include or<br/>
exclude in their definitions.  :)<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
There are a lot of great websites that aren&#39;t books, although they are impressive tomes. Joyce&#39;s site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> is an amazing place, beautifully linear.

<br/>
    &quot;Currently I&#39;m looking at The Unschooling Handbook. I find this style to be much freer than the way I was taught.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is likely to be much freer than the way any of us were taught. Unschooling isn&#39;t a teaching method, though. It is an approach to education that is about putting aside teaching so that learning can occur. Teaching makes a presumption of a student and an instructor. Unschooling starts with the notion that everyone is a learner and that every situation offers its own learning experience, depending on how you approach it, or how you walk away from it. <br/>
<br/>
    &quot;I am looking for ways to teach my children by learning about who they are. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would start by putting away the notion of teaching your children. Even when there are things they are learning from you, it is much more helpful to think of yourself as their partner than as their instructor. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a> is an essay on why using the word teach may be a stumbling block in your understanding of unschooling. What follows is a quote from that essay:<br/>
<br/>
              If I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, show them, make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I could maybe sing songs about it. So IF the person who&#39;s in the room &quot;being taught&quot; is thinking about how to file down that one piece of a machine gun that can turn a legal semi-automatic into an illegal automatic, and how to hide that part really well, disguised as something altogether different, what am I doing? <br/>
<br/>
              I&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing, and singing. But I&#39;m not teaching. I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know. I&#39;m just performing a play of sorts, without any audience. I&#39;m playing with myself. I&#39;m ...well, you know. <br/>
<br/>
              So if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and says, &quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot; I can show them. If they don&#39;t totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other examples. When I perceive that they have learned the thing they wanted to learn, I should shush up and go back to my magazine, because the action is completed. .<br/>
<br/>
              They learned. I helped them learn. I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t do the work that resulted in learning. The learner did that in his own head. I could put ideas in the air, but only he could hear and process and ask more questions. Without his active work, no teaching can possibly take place. <br/>
<br/>
    &quot;I do not make homemade bread, nor do I have an organic garden. And I&#39;ve occasionally thrown plastic in the garbage. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
    There are many people out there who make homemade bread and garden organically and have small holdings with free range chickens and live in a home they built that runs on solar power who, also, happily bid their children farewell ever morning and greet them with a smile every afternoon when they return from school. The two things are not entertwined. And it has been my experience that many of those people who are rigorous about how their food is raised are much more likely to limit their own children&#39;s choice of food. <br/>
<br/>
    &quot; I have my defenses up because I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about their approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    It is easy to be passionate about unschooling. And it is easy for that passion to come across as intolerance. When you have chosen to allow your children to craft their own lives with your help and to support them in whatever interests them, it is hard to watch other people squash their children into whatever box they feel is the best and most appropriate box to view the rest of the world from. There is a real sense that childhood is short and that every day that you spend traditionally parenting is a day that you&#39;ve spent not working to create the best relationship possible with your child. And, I suppose, with that in mind, prostelytizing might become a part of an unschoolers approach to the world. <br/>
<br/>
     &quot;I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    My favorite definition of unschooling comes from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html</a><br/>
<br/>
    &quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be who she is and blossom into who she will become. Learning happens as a side effect.&quot;<br/>

There is no ONE &quot;definition&quot; of unschooling. John Holt died before the <br/>
movement he started really got off the ground. Literally, it&#39;s NOT <br/>
schooling. But through Holt&#39;s writings, you can see how he&#39;d observed <br/>
children to be learning MACHINES! By the time of his death, he was a <br/>
full-blown advocate of children&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
As for reporting to the state, you&#39;re in an icky state. NY. But there <br/>
are some long-time unschoolers who know the law and can tell you how to <br/>
work with the system. Google around NY: Marla, Joy, Liza, and Anne have <br/>
been unschooling for several years with no problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419597343">***I would like to find out more about unschooling without reading another<br/>
book! (smiles!) ***<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re teasing us a little, I could tell by the smile, but the more <br/>
willing you are to help yourself the more quickly you&#39;ll gain the <br/>
information you want.   I think unschooling lists are a great source of <br/>
information, really wonderful for getting answers to questions in a <br/>
relatively short time.  But reading wherever you can, books included will <br/>
help you that much faster.   Maybe you meant you&#39;ve read them all!<br/>
<br/>
*** I am looking for ways to teach my children by learning about who<br/>
they are. ***<br/>
<br/>
The first unschooling thing you could do would be to stop thinking of <br/>
teaching.   Imagine yourself their loving outfitter for this long adventure. <br/>
Be a help to them, be their guide, do things for them and with them and give <br/>
them lots of opportunities to do what they want.   Don&#39;t think about <br/>
teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Your children will be changing every day.  If you focus on who they are <br/>
today then tomorrow you&#39;ll have to find out all over again.   Focus on what <br/>
they love to do, on what makes them happy and then help them do as much of <br/>
that as they want.   If they like to play outside, then play outside.  If <br/>
they like to build forts then build forts.  If they like to do six different <br/>
things at once, then get to it! &lt;g&gt; You will learn so much about your kids <br/>
by letting yourself enjoy their happiness.   When you know what delights <br/>
them you can be looking for all kinds of things to add to their lives and to <br/>
their play that will make their world bigger and more interesting.   And <br/>
remember, every moment they&#39;re alive, they&#39;re learning.<br/>
<br/>
***I need help though. We have implemented many Montessori <br/>
materials/presentations<br/>
in our classroom as well as the hands on daily activities of life in our <br/>
home and<br/>
outside.***<br/>
<br/>
In your mind and in your home, turn your &quot;classroom&quot; into the family room, <br/>
or the play room, or the junk room.  Get rid of the classroom. Nobody needs <br/>
it.  Learning takes place everywhere, in the big wide world, in the bathtub, <br/>
in the yard,  and in the little corners of a cozy home where kids are free <br/>
to play and explore.<br/>
<br/>
***I was raised in a home where everyone screamed and fought a lot. I choose <br/>
to have a gentler life now. ***<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;ve already made the world a better place by ending the pattern of <br/>
screaming and anger.   Good for you.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about<br/>
their approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan! ***<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t bump into unschoolers if they were talking about &quot;teaching.&quot; <br/>
And I&#39;m an atheist, so nothing is from satan, though there are plenty of <br/>
people out there who won&#39;t or don&#39;t think very much or very hard about what <br/>
they&#39;re doing and why.<br/>
<br/>
My strong opinion&lt;g&gt; is that anyone who is thinking of unschooling should do <br/>
the work to find out about unschooling.  Anyone thinking of unschooling <br/>
should know why they think it&#39;s the best choice for them.  Anyone <br/>
unschooling should be doing it because it makes sense and is good for their <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I know of people who&#39;ve said, &quot;unschooling isn&#39;t better than any other <br/>
method of homeschooling.&quot;   Then, I want to know why they&#39;re doing it!   If <br/>
they don&#39;t think it&#39;s better or if they think something else IS better, why <br/>
did they settle for second best for their kids?   So my other strong opinion <br/>
is that you have to have the balls to know what&#39;s good and right, and then <br/>
to Do it, and then not be a pansy about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is ***<br/>
<br/>
Live like you never heard of school.  Live like no one is a teacher and no <br/>
one is a student.  Live like you&#39;re all on an long vacation together.  Do <br/>
what your children love to do.<br/>

There are many people out there who make homemade bread and garden organically and have small holdings with free range chickens and live in a home they built that runs on solar power who, also, happily bid their children farewell ever morning and greet them with a smile every afternoon when they return from school. The two things are not entertwined. And it has been my experience that many of those people who are rigorous about how their food is raised are much more likely to limit their own children&#39;s choice of food. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &quot; I have my defenses up because I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about their approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to be passionate about unschooling. And it is easy for that passion to come across as intolerance. When you have chosen to allow your children to craft their own lives with your help and to support them in whatever interests them, it is hard to watch other people squash their children into whatever box they feel is the best and most appropriate box to view the rest of the world from. There is a real sense that childhood is short and that every day that you spend traditionally parenting is a day that you&#39;ve spent not working to create the best relationship possible with your child. And, I suppose, with that in mind, prostelytizing might become a part of an unschoolers approach to the world. <br/>
<br/>
     &quot;I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My favorite definition of unschooling comes from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be who she is and blossom into who she will become. Learning happens as a side effect.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think we&#39;d pretty much qualify as this! We&#39;re in a house that is<br/>
next to houses that look almost exactly like it, lotsa newer houses<br/>
all split level. BUT, we have about 3/4 of an acre and cow fields<br/>
across the street. Suburbia meets rural.:)<br/>
<br/>
So I get to explore my crunchy side while still being somewhat close<br/>
to town. Consensual living means that 1/2 of my family doesn&#39;t get 10<br/>
acres in the country and the other half doesn&#39;t get city living.<br/>

living together, even consensually.  It&#39;s how we exist with all our<br/>
idiosyncracies and still respect each other.  :-)  I find it difficult<br/>
to find a &quot;consensual&quot; solution to many problems without someone<br/>
compromising unless everyone is in agreement (which is rare in a<br/>
household with 2-3 adults and 3-5 children)  but we work together to<br/>
find a solution that will work for most of the people&#39;s wants, needs<br/>
and desires.  Sometimes we have to compromise to get as close as we<br/>
can to our perfect goal while still respecting other people&#39;s wants,<br/>
needs and desires.   And I would prefer to compromise than to be in a<br/>
stalemate with no solution because we can&#39;t come to a consensual<br/>
solution!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916162365">I&#39;m with ya, Ren.  I don&#39;t think compromise is a bad word.  Sometimes when I read about consensual living it sounds like the solution comes only after one person &#39;consents&#39; to want what the others want -- or to give the others what they want.  I know it wouldn&#39;t take long for me to resent always consenting to the other person&#39;s preference.  In compromise, each person gives a little -- not in sacrifice to the other&#39;s whims, but from a genuine desire to see everyone have some joy.  So it&#39;s not a bad thing, but a choice.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My other question about CL is what about those times when consent just isn&#39;t possible, or can&#39;t be waited for?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101989059">~~I&#39;m with ya, Ren. I don&#39;t think compromise is a bad word. Sometimes<br/>
when I read about consensual living it sounds like the solution comes<br/>
only after one person &#39;consents&#39; to want what the others want -- or to<br/>
give the others what they want. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I think they try to avoid anyone consenting to the whole. BUT, what I<br/>
think is amusing, is HOW do you get to a mutually agreeable solution?<br/>
What are the steps to forming a new and different choice than the two<br/>
original choices that weren&#39;t working? I see compromise as the PROCESS.<br/>
<br/>
I live with five other individuals all with their own tastes,<br/>
preferences etc.... and we use negotiation and compromise as tools to<br/>
REACH mutually agreeable soluations.<br/>
<br/>
Every member has equal weight (though sometimes not in the moment...a<br/>
sleeping person gets prioritiy over the person that wants to scream<br/>
and shout in the house) when we&#39;re using our negotiating and<br/>
compromise to find soluations. You will often hear me say &quot;how can we<br/>
make this work for everyone?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are moments where I DO try to persuade people of a different<br/>
choice also, which it sounds to me like consensual living is against.<br/>
Last week, when we were at the park for our homeschool meetup I had<br/>
two children that wanted to stay and swing after everyone else was<br/>
exhausted and already in the car wanting to go home NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I swung them for a while, after explaining to my other boys, we talked<br/>
about how they were waiting and we needed to go soon but after I got<br/>
back to the car again Jalen protested loudly that he needed to swing<br/>
more. The boys weren&#39;t thrilled. At that point I explained how<br/>
important that physical motion was for him, and that they were sitting<br/>
in a comfortable car with a radio and could they please give me some<br/>
more time to swing him? We did so again and I finally was able to<br/>
convince Jalen how hungry and tired they were. But without explaining<br/>
to him several times, he would have stayed for another hour, leaving<br/>
them hungry, tired and upset.<br/>
<br/>
There are times I push for a certain forward momentum because I know<br/>
and understand where everyone is at. It&#39;s not totally &quot;consensual&quot; but<br/>
I guess that isn&#39;t my ideal anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I think negoatiation and compromise are really useful tools in this<br/>
world. I see my kids using them with their friends in a very healthy<br/>
manner. Maybe &quot;consensual&quot; isn&#39;t my goal after all. Peaceful, joyful<br/>
and healthy family is.<br/>

You are reporting that it was. I am thrilled. However, the process of<br/>
creating mutually agreeable solutions is much easier, ime, if we don&#39;t<br/>
expect to *give up* something. Instead, we all trust that what we need<br/>
will be addressed in the solution that we create together. We focus on<br/>
&quot;I need and you need&quot;, rather than &quot;what can I give up and what can<br/>
you give up&quot;. The first creates a solution which meets the needs, the<br/>
second is accepting a &#39;middle ground&#39; that doesn&#39;t necessarily meet<br/>
anyone&#39;s needs, but is &quot;agreeable&quot;. The other key, is who is to decide<br/>
what the &#39;middle ground&#39; is? In our home, the decision resides with<br/>
everyone coming to agreement that their needs are addressed, not that<br/>
everyone is giving up something and living with it. <br/>
<br/>
It feels much different than compromise, which has the connotation of<br/>
sacrifice and unmet desires/wants/needs. And in my experience, unmet<br/>
need continue to exist are expressed in louder and bolder and more<br/>
extreme behaviors in order to be addressed.  The unrest about the<br/>
unmet need festers and can lead to resentment or expressed frustration. <br/>

&quot;The first step is to identify the underlying needs. Often there is a<br/>
stated need or desire. When in conflict, it helps to go deeper. It may<br/>
just be that the two stated needs are in conflict on the surface. When<br/>
you get to the underlying needs, typically there are several ways they<br/>
can be met. When you have the underlying needs on the table then new<br/>
alternative solutions are more apparent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We had a similar situation related to moving, where compromise didn&#39;t<br/>
enter the picture. We lived in the city before ds was born; around 18<br/>
months, it became harder because of our close proximity to a busy<br/>
street. I wanted more land outside the city. Dh didn&#39;t want to move<br/>
outside the city. It seemed that our stated needs were in conflict on<br/>
the surface. But when we discussed our underlying needs, we found many<br/>
ways that they could be met. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, I wanted land so that we&#39;d have more space for animals,<br/>
and a garden, and room to roam and play in the woods. Dh didn&#39;t want<br/>
to increase his commute nor to spend more money, but wanted a larger<br/>
house. And, we both wanted a safer place for ds to play. So, our<br/>
solution was to find more land, on the edge of the city, close to dh&#39;s<br/>
work. We each did get our needs met, without compromising. No one gave<br/>
up anything in order to resolve the seeming conflict.<br/>

  I gotta say, when I have to focus on how TO meet the needs of several people, it&#39;s going to feel like a compromise to me if I don&#39;t see ALL of my needs met -- and my kids would feel the same way, I&#39;m sure.  There are just some times when two people have needs that are mutually exclusive and there&#39;s no possible way to meet both needs.  If both kids &#39;need&#39; to sit in the same carseat spot on the same ride, for example (a huge issue at our house earlier this year). What then?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Another example -- last Friday, both boys &#39;needed&#39; to use computer, and both &#39;needed&#39; to do it NOW.  We have only one computer, and only 30 minutes before the time we had to leave for the movie we all three agreed we wanted to see with friends.  The movie start time was out of our control and non-negotiable.  Each boy felt he needed to have all 30 minutes to use the computer.  How is a consensual solution found?  <br/>
   <br/>
  We did reach a mutually agreeable compromise, but it was definitely a compromise on Andy&#39;s part - he agreed he could wait until we got home from the movie, tho it meant he missed what he&#39;d planned to do early.  <br/>

  It has that feeling for you -- if you see compromise as a negative thing.  For me, anytime there are several needs to be met for several people, and some of them simply can&#39;t be, or don&#39;t get, met --  it&#39;s a compromise.  To call it anything else is dishonest, in my opinion.  I like the word compromise -- because it implies everyone will be working to please everyone else.<br/>
   <br/>
  In my childhood, reaching a &#39;mutual agreement&#39; so often meant giving up entirely to what made my Mom&#39;s life easier, that any use of the word mutual feels dishonest to me.  Compromise is a much happier word for me.  Maybe it just all about semantics and personal experience, but for me the word compromise is baggage-free and honest.<br/>

  But what if you had wanted to live in the country specifically outside the city because you hated the air quality and traffic noise; he wanted to live in the city to have a shorter commute?  How would a house in either city or country not have been a compromise for someone?  It worked in that case because your real desire wasn&#39;t to live in the country, but in a bigger lot on a quieter street -- not country vs. city.<br/>

<br/>
I think it can, but I don&#39;t think giving up exactly what you want in<br/>
order to work out a mutually agreeable soluation is a bad thing. Maybe<br/>
that&#39;s where I differ with hardcore Consensual Living advocates. <br/>
<br/>
In our home we constantly strive to meet everyone&#39;s underlying needs.<br/>
But there are times with 6 people that one person gives up something<br/>
in order to make things flow. Sometimes one persons needs are greater<br/>
than another person&#39;s (not as a rule, but in the MOMENT).<br/>
<br/>
When dh has a migraine for example, his need for quiet and calm<br/>
overrides a persons needs for jumping, screaming or otherwise creating<br/>
loud noises in the house. Same for sleeping people. If I look at the<br/>
underlying need (to be loud, movement oriented) there are times I can<br/>
meet the need some other way, like going outside, a park etc...<br/>
At 11pm, when it&#39;s cold and dark and everyone is tired, then we need<br/>
to find some way to be quieter. <br/>
<br/>
I find so many examples in our lives where we give and take, take and<br/>
give to keep the machine oiled so to speak.  Times when the IDEAL of<br/>
consensual living collides with reality. Which makes it hard for me to<br/>
swallow as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we are constantly trying to be more creative, meet the underlying<br/>
needs etc....<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I think it&#39;s a GOOD skill to learn to give for others. I<br/>
think empathy is useful and necessary.....which involves giving up<br/>
your own want/desire occasionally. I can see where people do it in an<br/>
unhealthy  way, but that&#39;s not something I would encourage. <br/>
<br/>
I think service to others, giving and compromise are positive tools<br/>
when a person is whole, healthy, strong and able to care for<br/>
themselves. Underlying needs can be met in the long-term without<br/>
always getting exactly what you want in the moment.<br/>
