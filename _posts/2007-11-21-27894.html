<div id="ygrps-yiv-672986972">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I can really relate to Alex&#39;s desire to connect with other unschoolers face-2-face.  About the time I learned about unschooling last year, we started our long, complicated, many-staged transition from military life, living in England, to the glorious civilian life back in the states.  Even when I did find someone somewhat nearby, our life was so busy and stressful that I didn&#39;t manage to arrange a get-together.  So for a year now I&#39;ve had this craving to spend time with unschoolers, but the need (sure feels like a need to me anyhow ;) has so far been unmet.  But...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re finally settled, living in the Evergreen area west of Denver.  And I am SOOOOO eager to find unschoolers near us.  I know it&#39;s supposedly a pretty conservative area, but, dang it, there are like 2.5 million people in the Denver metro, so there&#39;s GOT to be radical unschoolers around here somewhere! :)<br/>
<br/>
I would love, love, LOVE to hear from RUers who would like to together.  My DS is 2, and has about a 45-minute max tolerance for his car seat (that limits our traveling range).  And we&#39;d love to have visitors up here in the mountains.  Whether you&#39;ve been RUing for 20 years or 2 months, have an infant or teenagers, I&#39;d like to get to know you! :)  <br/>
<br/>
Reading this list and AU are my daily &quot;inoculations&quot; against the old tapes in my head and the pull of mainstream, status-quo flow.  Spending time with other parents modeling (or at least struggling to model :) RU principles would be an incredible addition to our lives and exceptionally helpful for our journey.  And a lot of fun, too!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you...<br/>
<br/>
Peace and hugs,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126259468">Hi Julie!<br/>
No, sorry, I&#39;m not in the Denver area.  But, I do know there is an active<br/>
group of unschoolers in the Ft. Collins area.  That&#39;s an hour and a half<br/>
from you, or about as long as it would take for your little one to watch a<br/>
movie in the car!<br/>
<br/>
Someone from the UnschoolingFamiliesontheRoad list and myself are just<br/>
starting to throw around the idea of a gathering somewhere in CO.  No idea<br/>
yet of the when, where, what, but the conversation has begun.  I&#39;ll<br/>
absolutely put the information here if and when we nail down some plans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Rapid City, SD, she&#39;s somewhere in CO (10 hours from me, can&#39;t<br/>
remember the name), so probably somewhere between here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping you find some RU&#39;ers to connect with soon!<br/>
<br/>

We have friends in Denver ( not unschoolers) so we can see you both. by the way they drive here all the time and they say it is not too bad ( with thier 4 yo and  3 yo). they drive at night to make it easier on the kids.  ( mine still nurse all nigh so I don&#39;t know how could it would be!)<br/>
Please consider coming over too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Schuyler! :)<br/>
<br/>
I sure I wish I could have made it up to Norwich to see you and your <br/>
kids.  Not long after we emailed, our plans got changed and Jake, the <br/>
dogs, and I ended up leaving almost two months earlier than <br/>
originally planned!!  Needless to say we were scrambling to get <br/>
ready, and I regret having left many loose ends.<br/>
<br/>
I was especially disappointed to not have your DD meet the <br/>
Schipperkes.  If you&#39;re ever down in north Suffolk, there&#39;s a nice <br/>
breeder in Hockwold.<br/>
<br/>
Missing the English weather (funny, I know... :) and still using the <br/>
phrase, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s lovely!&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I just googled the distance from Denver to Rapid City and it&#39;s 6-1/2 <br/>
hours.  If you&#39;re interested in having your get together in this area, <br/>
I&#39;d be pleased to help do some of the leg work!  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
That sounds great!  <br/>
<br/>
On the move here, it took us three days to drive 11 hours from Montana <br/>
to Denver.  (And that was using every &quot;trick&quot; we could think of: <br/>
portable DVD player, pop-up books, driving at night...) So I don&#39;t <br/>
think we&#39;ll be taking another long road trip anytime soon!)  But as <br/>
soon as he&#39;s game, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love to experience farm life. :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

Hey Julie,<br/>
We have a group in Boulder with several RU families on the list.  We are more active in the <br/>
summer with park days, but there are always families looking to get together!  I have two <br/>
little guys that are 5 1/2 and 2 1/2, and we are making our way on the RU path (if I can <br/>
just get out of my own head!!)  Feel free to email me off list if you want to chat or get <br/>
together!<br/>
Here&#39;s the link for the yahoo group... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BLUE_SKIES2/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BLUE_SKIES2/</a><br/>
Take care,<br/>
