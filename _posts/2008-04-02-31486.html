<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123578555">Oh, this is my greatest fear!  I hope I am not using unschooling to be lazy<br/>
and irresponsible.  I have days where I don&#39;t feel well and my boys so end<br/>
up playing video games all day.<br/>
<br/>
I was just so tired of making them sit down and do school at home.  It was<br/>
horrible for them and for me.  We have agreed that they at least need to do<br/>
one math thing a day.  They do look up things they want to learn more about,<br/>
but they do not like to read unless it&#39;s magna.  We do like to snuggle and I<br/>
read aloud to them.  Does that sound like unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
We are so new to this that I still feel lost.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Jess <br/>

~~is because I<br/>
know &#39;unschoolers&#39; in real life who actually just seem to be neglecting<br/>
their kids in some ways. ~~<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s possible that some could use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; as an excuse<br/>
to be lazy and irresponsible. Maybe. But possibly there are new<br/>
unschoolers finding their way and haven&#39;t quite made that switch from<br/>
coercion and manipulation to connected and mindful.<br/>
