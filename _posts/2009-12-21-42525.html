<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937349664">Hi I&#39;m hoping you guys might have suggestions for some new activities for my 6 and 10 year old girls that ...<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t require a lot of my participation <br/>
are cheap because we are flat broke after a sudden but needed move and well just the economy in general <br/>
and dont require driving much. <br/>
<br/>
for over the next 2 weeks. <br/>
It may be something you do at your house all the time :) please suggest away we may not have done it or at least not in a while. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389886809">Since I &quot;am on a roll&quot; as an experienced unschooler lol --<br/>
<br/>
Is this your first encounter with unschooling?  -- one of the first concepts to wrap one&#39;s head around, is that unschooling isn&#39;t some list of activity ideas to set up for children to do alone on the cheap for a couple of weeks until school starts up again. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just &quot;what&quot; unschooling families do, but the whys and hows of doing it, that makes all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
If today is the first step of your family&#39;s unschooling journey, I would suggest that taking and spreading family relationship advice from Doug Phillips is something &quot;wrong with this picture&quot; that won&#39;t help you or anyone else successfully unschool.  Doug Phillips represents a patriarchal and authoritarian belief system built on subjugation of women and children, justified as divine and sternly enforced. Such beliefs run directly counter to unschooling principles and have not been a successful unschooling path for any family I&#39;ve known or heard about, in 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Doug Phillips&#39; Vision Forum is clear in their article &quot;Biblical Patriarchy and the Doctrine of Federal Representation&quot; of the wrongness of a woman having an individual personal view and taking any sort of participation or prominent role which may be viewed as competing with her owner, er, I mean husband . . .&quot;<br/>

Day care?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I made the suggestion . As I expected both girls looked at me like I was insane. :)<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a post explaining a bit of our family situation and the why behind my request. I&#39;m not just looking to get them out of my hair but I see how my first post really came across that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450177498">Yes, it did. But now that you have explained, I don&#39;t have any brilliant suggestions. Other than the thought that, at 6 and 10, the girls may be able to play on their own for pretty extended times. Especially the 10 yo. Even if it&#39;s not what they are used to every day. And they may be able to understand that this is temporary until you get your 8 yo back to his school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586446087">Hey Nicole, <br/>
<br/>
Hope it&#39;s going OK so far. I had your post in the back of my mind and remembered these things I loved at those ages: <br/>
<br/>
-drawing games, like the one where each person draws just one line and then you trade back and forth, and the one where you fold the paper and each person draws part of the body<br/>
-other writing games like tic tac toe or hangman if your kids are there with spelling<br/>
--also requires reading, don&#39;t know where your kids are with that: the dictionary game, where you look up a word at random and then give multiple definitions, and the other player/s have to figure out which is true<br/>
-books where you search for things in the pictures, like Where&#39;s Waldo and Lookalikes and I Spy. If someone could still swing by the library! <br/>
-hand shadows. Another library book or internet research thing probably <br/>
-the hot/cold game, where you think of an object or hide one and while the other person moves around trying to find it you tell them if they are getting warmer or colder<br/>
-that game where you draw a picture with your finger on someone&#39;s back and they have to guess what it is<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps-<br/>
