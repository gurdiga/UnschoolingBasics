<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699022667">&quot; If there<br/>
are no requirements place on kids as they are growing,<br/>
how will they know how to handle requirements placed<br/>
on them in the workplace. There are some things in<br/>
life that aren&#39;t &quot;suggestions&quot; or requests. Even God<br/>
requires things of us that we may not like.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like something you&#39;ve been told, and are repeating.<br/>
It isn&#39;t true.<br/>
People naturally want to learn about their society and culture and how<br/>
to thrive in it. I don&#39;t place requirements on my kids, but today they<br/>
all came with me to help build garden beds for a good friend with a<br/>
disability and Trevor moved their computer system to another room.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 16 and has no requirements in his life. Yet he chooses to help<br/>
people with computer related stuff. Why? Maybe the myth about not<br/>
having requirements leading to selfish, lazy humans is way off base.<br/>
Maybe trusting them to do real work, real play, using real tools from<br/>
the time they are very young is what allows a work ethic to unfold.<br/>
Requirements do nothing to help my child learn about self motivation.<br/>
I love that they are willing to do things that make sense, rather than<br/>
waiting for me to require it.<br/>
<br/>
I request that God/religion not be used as a basis for debate.<br/>
We all have different beliefs here and if God is the only way to make<br/>
a point, maybe the point needs to be thought through more deeply or<br/>
from a different angle. Maybe your God requires things of you that you<br/>
don&#39;t like, but mine doesn&#39;t. And I don&#39;t want discussions spinning<br/>
off into religious debates. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551803253">Thanks for pointing that out, Ren.  I was a bit offended by the comment you<br/>
commented on.<br/>
