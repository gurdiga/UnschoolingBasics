<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597282171">I always wondered if it&#39;s easier to home-ed/ unschool when you have <br/>
more than one kid. It just seems to me families with 2 or 3 or even <br/>
4 kids, their kids seems to be doing so much more. They seems to go <br/>
off and occupy each other. It just seems to come across the older <br/>
ones are teaching the younger ones and that they&#39;re having fun doing <br/>
it. Well, I have to say it is rather boring playing Happy Family <br/>
when there&#39;s only the 2 of us, me and 6 yrs old son. Now I even have <br/>
to fight with the PS2 for his attention!&quot;!! Son do likes chess, <br/>
which is more of his father&#39;s forte but I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve recently <br/>
managed to get him interested in The Simpson&#39;s Game of Life. Our <br/>
standard weekday routine, outdoor things we do together is go to the <br/>
park, Tesco, library, We very much stayed indoors(son&#39;s choice). <br/>
When indoors, he mostly occupied himself with his PS2, Lego&#39;s, tv or <br/>
surf the net while I&#39;m cleaning or cooking or surfing the net for <br/>
more HE info. I&#39;ll  watch tv and play PS2(recent thing) together <br/>
with him or simply snuggled up to son with my book. Weekends i tend <br/>
to get hubby to take us outdoors maybe to town just for some window <br/>
shopping or perhaps just a drive to no where, ending up in some park <br/>
or pub for lunch, just to be out of the house. Yesterday we went and <br/>
bought ourselves bicycles, so we hoping to be doing some cycling now <br/>
that the weather&#39;s beautiful and warm. Somehow, I feel like we&#39;re <br/>
not doing enough during the week. But then I have no idea what more <br/>
we can do. So my question is <br/>
<br/>
1. If you also only have one child, what&#39;s your homeschooling day to <br/>
day like?&quot; Do you have a busy routine or maybe a relax one like mine?<br/>
What do you like to do? Where do you go? What do you do? Do you go <br/>
seeking for activities Or do you create them? <br/>
<br/>
2. What&#39;s driving you? Any goals to aim for? Any pitfalls to avoid?<br/>
<br/>
3. Do you have a &#39;only child&#39; syndrome? Mine do as in he&#39;s quite <br/>
happy being alone all the time. Though he&#39;ll very happily and <br/>
confidently join in any HE group of children to play, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seems to effect him that he have no specific friends in his life. <br/>
<br/>
Do write and looking forward to everybody&#39;s stories.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92565620">I can&#39;t answer your questions as I have 3 boys, but I had to say that your post made me laugh -- I keep thinking how much easier unschooling would be if I only had one!!!  My younger two don&#39;t want to be dragged around to the kinds of activities that my oldest might enjoy doing more of!  They also need a lot of my attention.  The grass is always greener...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853518193">For the first 3 months of our HS my son was an only. (brother born in <br/>
Oct last year).   we did the regular &quot;schooling thing&quot;  books and <br/>
worksheets but he was frustrated because of his fine motor skills lag <br/>
just a bit and he does not like to write as a result.  He was involved <br/>
in a HS PE program at one of our local gyms, he is dual enrolled in PS <br/>
for Art, music and working on communication skills with his SPED teacher <br/>
whose expertise is  working with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome kids on their <br/>
&quot;Social Skills&quot;.   After brother was born  he mostly drifted to <br/>
unschooling  and loves it more.  He does computer  &quot;school&quot; programs <br/>
(math, science, and language arts with spelling), videos and <br/>
leapster/leap pad programs  during the hours of  9 am and 2 pm.   Before <br/>
and after that he  does chess, Hoyle card games, plays board games and  <br/>
reads lots of science books.  We are involved in the HS science program <br/>
at the local science center and this summer will participate in the <br/>
summer camps of the science center, gym and our Living history Farms.  <br/>
He goes to HS gym once a month at the local YMCA.  in the fall he will <br/>
get involved with the Bowling and Rollerskating programs available to us <br/>
but I was not able to do with him last fall due to pregnancy and a young <br/>
baby at home.  HTH you, Ruby in  (bitter cold) Iowa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079716020">Oh I forgot that right now Mister P loves learning about Kings, Queens, <br/>
knights and the middle ages (mostly just reading) this born out of his <br/>
new found love of chess. We are in the midst of setting up a &quot;joisting <br/>
ring&quot; in  our backyard (when it warms up a gain) and a Mega blok castle <br/>
for him to explore this time frame more throughly.   He &quot;branched&quot;out in <br/>
to Pirates as it struck his fancy in the books store the other day.  I <br/>
have always been the one to  follow his lead and try to get him the <br/>
tools he need to follow these venues so he can best learn about them.  <br/>
Due to his Asperger&#39;s he has always tended to be a loner and he like it <br/>
that way for the most part.  He does like to occasionally get together <br/>
with other kids and play but mostly just on his own.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755824873">I had an only until a few months ago, and my new addition is a teen, <br/>
so its kind of like having two onlies, in some ways. They don&#39;t have <br/>
a whole lot in common in terms of interests. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. Do you have a &#39;only child&#39; syndrome? Mine do as in he&#39;s quite <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like he&#39;s a bit of an introvert - which doens&#39;t have anything <br/>
to do with being an only child. My 5yo is like that. She&#39;s happy <br/>
doing things by herself much of the time. My 13yo is an extrovert - <br/>
always has been, even when *he* was an only.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you need some interests or hobbies of your own. <br/>
Something you can enjoy doing along side him but that you can put <br/>
down if he needs a hand or some information. If you&#39;re needing more <br/>
social contact, maybe look into taking a class or joining a club one <br/>
night a week just for you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello Sharon,<br/>
 Just read thru all your posts as the one about PS2 caught my eye.<br/>
What you said above, made me smile, 2 or three or EVEN 4 KIDS! We have<br/>
five and its actually a challenge to do more. You said you just got<br/>
bikes. Well we have bikes, two with baby seats on the back but no way<br/>
to transport five bikes to anywhere safe and nice to ride. Or trying<br/>
to leave the house and one son hides his shoes because he would rather<br/>
stay home and play PS2! That was when he was 6yo, sounds like what you<br/>
are saying.<br/>
Some children get into one thing at a time and want it ALL the time.<br/>
Before PS it was jigsaw puzzles, 500 pc for a five yo, had to be<br/>
wizards and dragons.It may be just that your son will do the same as<br/>
mine, one interest to the exclusion of all others.He would play PS2<br/>
endlessly and could beat really hard games that others much older<br/>
children couldn&#39;t easily do.I think the common theme with his<br/>
interests is CHALLENGE! PS2 is a challenge and your son may be feeding<br/>
that desire for challenge in the midst of his favourite characters. If<br/>
you could go on an adventure with your favourite people, would you<br/>
want to stop half way to go shopping?  <br/>
Isa is nine now, did not read until just a month before 8th birthday.<br/>
He announced when he was 6 that he would read when he could read Lord<br/>
Of The Rings!Lofty idea I thought as he was not reading anything not<br/>
even easy books.<br/>
He loves LOTR and has a hobbit cloak all the hobbit characters and<br/>
movies and one hair raising episode where he turned into Gollum in a<br/>
forest park and went bounding down some flat rocks to a waterfall<br/>
muttering &quot;my precious&quot; and there was no way to get him back till he<br/>
came out of character! <br/>
 But a few months before he turned 8 he said I think I will read at my<br/>
next birthday. And he did, not LOTR but a detour of a large volume<br/>
&quot;Arthur, High King Of Britain&quot; then everything Arthur, then the Hobbit<br/>
and then Fellowship of the Rings. He has now also read Harry Potter 1<br/>
to 4 and all within a year of beginning to read.<br/>
He rarely plays PS2 now, only once in a while to help his younger<br/>
sister, 5.5yo with Dark Cloud 2. Its an AWESOME game, the whole family<br/>
loves it, me and hubby too. Try it with your son, the storyline has<br/>
time travel, the characters are great, and there is battle but no<br/>
blood, the monster creatures dissolve into blue bubbles and coins!<br/>
We would all sit down and watch as Isa played, like a big movie unfolding!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry and have fun!!<br/>

   I always wondered if it&#39;s easier to home-ed/ unschool when you have<br/>
more than one kid.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Grass is always greener. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
City folk think it&#39;s easier when you live in the country with critters <br/>
and nature. Country folk think it&#39;s easier in the city where there are <br/>
musems and restaurants. Suburbanites think *anywhere* would be easier.<br/>
<br/>
Large families seem busy, busy---but I have no idea how they pay for <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks just want to be OUT of the house, some complain they&#39;re <br/>
never home.<br/>
<br/>
Embrace what you have. Someone else would pay to have your circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
1. If you also only have one child, what&#39;s your homeschooling day to<br/>
day like?&quot; Do you have a busy routine or maybe a relax one like mine?<br/>
What do you like to do? Where do you go? What do you do? Do you go<br/>
seeking for activities Or do you create them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends. I have two &quot;onlies&quot;---eight years apart, so I could be very <br/>
focused on each one at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan likes friends around. I try to have someone over a LOT. Bo&#39;s <br/>
here now. He&#39;s been here two nights already. And he&#39;s staying another <br/>
night, I believe. They play well together: video games, TV, trampoline, <br/>
role playing (lots!), swimming (in the summer), making Bionicles, board <br/>
games (I just got him a dice game that they can&#39;t get enough of). His <br/>
other friends are more likely to play YuGiOh! with him than Bionicles. <br/>
They&#39;re both in the den with me now--just turned on the TV and are <br/>
watching Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary Friends---and are making new <br/>
Bionicles. I&#39;m making them some deviled eggs for some afternoon protein <br/>
(with Danielle Conger&#39;s organic eggs!).<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, while I was working, Cameron took them to lunch and a movie. <br/>
*I* had planned to, but a client called last minute, so I booked two <br/>
dogs. They had a great time with &quot;big bother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some days we leave at 9:00 and don&#39;t get back until late afternoon. <br/>
Other days we never leave the house. Just depends. We&#39;ve been <br/>
travelling and entertaining a LOT, so we&#39;re in slow-mo&#39; right now. Fine <br/>
with me! I&#39;m pooped!<br/>
<br/>
I keep my eyes open for new and unusuall things going on. We don&#39;t <br/>
always do them, but we do know what&#39;s happening in town so that we <br/>
could jet out if we decided we needed to. VERY easy with only one!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lost as to what to do if I had more than one to work with. But <br/>
those big families have developed their strategies.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2. What&#39;s driving you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Any goals to aim for?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Any pitfalls to avoid?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Boring people. Boring places. Being uninterested or uninteresting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
3. Do you have a &#39;only child&#39; syndrome? Mine do as in he&#39;s quite<br/>
happy being alone all the time. Though he&#39;ll very happily and<br/>
confidently join in any HE group of children to play, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seems to effect him that he have no specific friends in his life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you *trying* to make him be what he isn&#39;t? If he&#39;s happy at home, <br/>
super!<br/>
<br/>
Many people are happiest when alone.<br/>
<br/>
I wish *I* had more alone time. Even though I can and do enjoy being <br/>
with others, I really relish an empty house<br/>

  He does computer  &quot;school&quot; programs<br/>
(math, science, and language arts with spelling), videos and<br/>
leapster/leap pad programs  during the hours of  9 am and 2 pm.<br/>

Why the hours? Do you not see the learning that happens *after* school <br/>
hours?<br/>

   Before and after that he  does chess, Hoyle card games, plays board <br/>
games and<br/>
reads lots of science books.<br/>

OK, but why are there &quot;school&quot; hours?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that was his idea.The last hold of school on him.  the time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is very loosely held to.  I usually don&#39;t follow this anyway.  I never<br/>
said we would keep school hours. <br/>
<br/>
He is finding out that learning is happen every minute of every day.<br/>
<br/>
WE *are* doing lots of learning all the time, not just him on the<br/>
computer or his games.<br/>
<br/>
Just today, we had fun playing with number dice and adding,<br/>
subtracting,mutipling and dividing and keeping score one of his made<br/>
up games.     Ruby</div>

   As for the social-- we are doing lots of things.  We spend time with<br/>

I&#39;m not exactly sure what this is in reference to. Could you please <br/>
include a clip from the post you&#39;re quoting?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;d originally written that he wasn&#39;t social? Or he needed to <br/>
be more social? Or how to....???<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
