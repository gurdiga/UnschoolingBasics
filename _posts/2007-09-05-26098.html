<div id="ygrps-yiv-482006430">Just had to share about a GREAT site I found!<br/>
<br/>
I have been on this site for almost 6 months.? I have gotten many homeschooling books,? (even Abeka and Sonlight), great literature?for the whole family?and one college textbook (saved over $50 with this one book).? I have never been disappointed in any of the books received.? I highly recommend the site!<br/>
<br/>
Here is how it works:<br/>
Once you post 9 books into the system, you get to request 3 books immediately- FREE! It is that simple! You will also then be able to go to the site and create a referral email to send to your friends and family. When they join, you will get 1 credit?for each?as well!<br/>
It is a win - win situation!<br/>
<br/>
The membership is totally free.<br/>
<br/>
You really need to check this out!<br/>
