<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471402716">Allison McKee&#39;s book &quot;From Homeschool to College and Work&quot; details how she <br/>
translated her son&#39;s unschooling experiences into transcripts when he decided at <br/>
the last minute to go to college instead of pursuing a career as a fishing <br/>
guide at Yellowstone. Guaranteed to help see that teens don&#39;t need to &quot;pursue <br/>
academics&quot; to go to college, and helpful for parents trying to pull together <br/>
transcripts from an authentic life.<br/>
<br/>
Wes Beach&#39;s book &quot;Opportunities After High School: Thoughts, Documents, <br/>
Resources&quot; has sample transcripts written in a wide variety of styles granting <br/>
credit for a vast range of real life learning. Some of the information is specific <br/>
to CA but most is easily adapted to teens living anywhere. The book is <br/>
available from the Homeschool Association of California www.hsc.org <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let the transcript/diploma ride the child. Help him live an authentic <br/>
life, in passionate pursuit of his interests, and then if he wants to go to <br/>
college help him translate that life into terms the colleges can understand. <br/>
