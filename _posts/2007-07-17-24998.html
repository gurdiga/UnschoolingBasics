<div id="ygrps-yiv-902237204">Right, there are some good things here helping me out, BUT--<br/>
<br/>
I have a related question, and it&#39;s something I&#39;m struggling with:  If she<br/>
made a commitment to the swim team, then shouldn&#39;t she go to the swim<br/>
meeting?  Let&#39;s assume the best here, namely that she wanted to join the<br/>
swim team on her own (no pushing from her mom or anyone else, her own<br/>
desire).  She made an agreement.  Should she not honor that agreement (by<br/>
attending the swim meeting)?  Maybe I&#39;m stuck in some previous era where<br/>
supposedly someone&#39;s word was their bond.  How do they learn this?<br/>
<br/>
Follow-up:  At what age can we expect children to start abiding by their<br/>
agreements?  (Loaded question, I know, I&#39;m sure it depends a lot on how<br/>
doing that was modeled to them by parents and others.)<br/>
<br/>
OK, stepping back...<br/>
<br/>
If this were me, I think I&#39;d still let her play with company instead of<br/>
going.  I would point out her agreement, but would let her make the<br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
When I say &quot;I would point out her agreement,&quot; I mean I would remind her of<br/>
her agreement much like you might remind a visiting friend who was about to<br/>
leave that she was forgetting her umbrella.  If I mentioned that it was<br/>
important to me, I would make sure she understood that I would be fine with<br/>
whatever decision she made.  Voice supportive, neutral, and no hidden &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
fine as long as you choose what I want you to choose.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet even in that previous era people went back on their words, <br/>
renegged on contracts and cheated on spouses. When do people <br/>
actually keep their words? When there is something about keeping the <br/>
promise that is more personally valuble than breaking it. For *some* <br/>
people (now as in the past) a reputation of trustworthiness or an <br/>
internal standard of honor is what&#39;s valuble. But you can&#39;t teach <br/>
that, or there wouldn&#39;t be the expression &quot;black sheep of the <br/>
family&quot;. <br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends, first of all, on development. A kid who is free to <br/>
choose may nonetheless not be ready to make decisions about tomorrow <br/>
or six weeks from now. Morgan will be 6 in a month and its only in <br/>
the last six months that she&#39;s been able to make plans for tomorrow. <br/>
Just in the last few weeks she&#39;s started to talk about doing <br/>
something in several days&#39; time. So there&#39;s no way at this time that <br/>
she could make a real commitment to do something every week for <br/>
several weeks. Its beyond her comprehension. Asking her to &quot;honor&quot; <br/>
an agreement she isn&#39;t really capable of understanding would teach <br/>
her about coercion, not decision-making. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, it depends on the person in question having the skills <br/>
to make decisions based on a multitude of complex factors, some <br/>
pretty far reaching. How do people learn to make those kinds of <br/>
decisions? Personally, I&#39;d say being made to go through with short-<br/>
term committments regardless of other factors isn&#39;t terribly helpful <br/>
to this process. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it may help to look at this from a adult perspective and not a <br/>
childs. If an adult had swim team and family came to visit is it all <br/>
right to skip the practice? Sometimes I think we get too focused on <br/>
kids have to complete or finish something or for that matter adults. <br/>
Is there a reason we should continue to do something it we are DONE <br/>
with it or skip it? <br/>
<br/>
I think it is situational- at least for me it is- I think that it is <br/>
okay to break a &quot;bond&quot; or &quot;your word&quot; if you can do it with honor and <br/>
honor is different for different people. <br/>
<br/>
I personally get fed up with people who think they HAVE to do <br/>
something or be somewhere when it is a choice. She choose to have her <br/>
daughter go to swim instead of visiting with relatives- to me that <br/>
sounds like swim was more important than a family visit.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9633213">My DW and I have been &#39;round this type of issue before.  I&#39;m almost always<br/>
the one pushing the &quot;we must do what we said we would do&quot; and she&#39;s always<br/>
bringing reality into it, darn her eyes.  For example, family is more<br/>
important that swimming (even if we have paid for it, but money just adds<br/>
more fuel to the fire), or that it&#39;s just one practice and that there isn&#39;t<br/>
a competition coming up anytime soon so there&#39;s no real rush, or that it&#39;s<br/>
fine to be late meeting DW&#39;s aunt for supper because she is always late (and<br/>
she always is), or some such thing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mellowed out a lot on this, but emotionally it&#39;s still an issue and I<br/>
haven&#39;t figured out completely what to do with it yet.  Continually<br/>
reminding myself of these things does help.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I personally get fed up with people who think they HAVE to do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something or be somewhere when it is a choice. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I get tripped up.  Half the time I see it as an obligation, not<br/>
a choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Its beyond her comprehension. Asking her to &quot;honor&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>an agreement she isn&#39;t really capable of understanding would teach<br/>
her about coercion, not decision-making. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You mean I shouldn&#39;t teach her to turn her brain off and just blindly follow<br/>
a set of precepts/whatever I say?  Is that a bad thing???  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Beyond that, it depends on the person in question having the skills<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to make decisions based on a multitude of complex factors, some<br/>
pretty far reaching. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If many adults can&#39;t or won&#39;t do it, why am I trying to teach (force) them<br/>
to do it?  It&#39;s a complex skill or set of skills.  And the way for them to<br/>
&quot;learn&quot; it is through their own experience, not by some ham-handed force-fed<br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
As someone recently told me (and it makes sense to me), the goal of RU is to<br/>
allow children to become more fully who they are.  Education happens as a<br/>
side-effect.  Sometimes (sometimes?) it&#39;s difficult to trust that these<br/>
things will come about in their own time, at the right time.  It&#39;s tough to<br/>
reduce my use of the word &quot;teach&quot; when talking about what my children know.<br/>
My &quot;teaching&quot; is best done when I&#39;m engaged with them and when I show how I<br/>
live my life.<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
A young child does not have the developmental ability to understand<br/>
long-term commitments. Period. Any adult that expects them to be able<br/>
to, is at fault for any default on agreement and really needs to learn<br/>
more about child development!<br/>
<br/>
Besides, as an adult I can re-negotiate ANY agreements I make. Why<br/>
shouldn&#39;t a child do the same?<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
I think parents really ought to look at the ways an interest can be<br/>
pursued LONG before they ever consider a class or formal arrangement<br/>
of any kind. Kids NEED to dabble in and out of interests for a long<br/>
time before true passion can take hold. Heck, some of us are life-long<br/>
dabblers.<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t ever look at classes or lessons when our kids start<br/>
being interested in something. That comes later, when the interest has<br/>
cemented a bit. For many children, formal clubs/classes/teams are a<br/>
sure-fire way to kill joy because they really don&#39;t understand long<br/>
term commitment.<br/>

I think you have young children Robert? Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s a lot harder to trust this flow when you&#39;re oldest is<br/>
still a wee one. But when you have teens/almost adults, it&#39;s really<br/>
EASY to say &quot;don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll figure it out&quot; because you know they<br/>
really WILL.<br/>

Trevor got interested in guitar a few years ago. He got one for<br/>
Christmas and dabbled with it for several months then decided that<br/>
guitar lessons would be nice. We searched for a teacher that would let<br/>
him learn whatever he wanted to learn. We found one and he took<br/>
lessons for a year before deciding that he was finished.<br/>
<br/>
Just like that, he was done. Was our money &quot;wasted&quot; because he quit<br/>
playing guitar? Heck no! There was great enjoyment of music and guitar<br/>
playing for that entire year. He really loved his teacher (who had<br/>
played for some big names and basically just showed him how to play<br/>
songs he liked...from ACDC to Metallica and beyond) and looked forward<br/>
to lessons.<br/>
<br/>
So.....the guitar has sat for several years untouched. The amp had<br/>
died so there was no reason to dabble with it. Guess what? He started<br/>
mentioning he might like a new amp a few months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Dh brought home a new amp and new guitar strings for him last night.<br/>
Trevor was thrilled. It&#39;s a small used one, but that matters little.<br/>
He played guitar all  day today and beamed about what a great day it<br/>
was. He&#39;s back at it again. Who knows how long it will last. Maybe a<br/>
week, maybe a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
What matters to us is that he owned this experience all along. Having<br/>
watched him all these years let&#39;s me know that learning IS a journey<br/>
unique to each individual. Development happens and we really don&#39;t<br/>
need to sweat whether our kids will understand long-term commitment or<br/>
how to tie shoes or ride a bike or how to read or ANYTHING. Really. <br/>
<br/>
It will come in it&#39;s own good time. They will try new things and let a<br/>
lot go....interests swirl up and in and out and back around again. If<br/>
they don&#39;t know anything about the solar system today, they might<br/>
tomorrow or next week or when they&#39;re 20.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When&quot; is so much less important than &quot;why&quot;.</div>

Yes, I&#39;ve got two, ages 5.5 and a bit over 4.  And yes if you haven&#39;t<br/>
guessed, I&#39;m still in the very-much theoretical stage.  I&#39;m practicing as<br/>
much as possible, but just as soon as I feel like I&#39;ve got something down in<br/>
practice, another &quot;parenting fear&quot; (gotta make sure our kids are raised up<br/>
RIGHT!) comes back up.  Like &quot;commitment.&quot;  and the whole &quot;what do I do<br/>
about THAT?&quot;  These discussions point out the need for more child<br/>
development info.<br/>
<br/>
This whole RU thing is one big re-modeling of my concepts of parenting.<br/>
What really frustrates me is that whenever we&#39;re around other families, I<br/>
feel sucked into yet another game of &quot;Whose Kids Are The Best?&quot;  and &quot;The<br/>
Comparison Game!&quot;  You lose points whenever little Janie hits someone else,<br/>
but the parent can score by how they react.  And the judges are the other<br/>
parents.  It&#39;s liberating to let that horse manure go (when it can be<br/>
manageed).  Knowing where my kids are, and what they need gives more<br/>
confidence in how we interact together.  It helps me toss out the need for<br/>
other parents&#39; approval.  Well, OK, a bit, but I think it&#39;s slowly coming.<br/>

come to mind. And wasn&#39;t Ben Franklin kind of a dabbler? <br/>
<br/>
For that matter, part of the idea of a &quot;well rounded education&quot; is <br/>
that kids need to dabble in a bunch of different subjects to find out <br/>
what they like and are good at. Trouble is they aren&#39;t trusted to <br/>
decide what to dabble in and when.<br/>
<br/>
One of the fears that parents have wrt pulling kids out of school is <br/>
that they don&#39;t seem to have *enough* interests - well, all their <br/>
dabbling is being sucked up by school. It was almost six months after <br/>
leaving school before Ray started dabbling. It was kind of exciting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831872566">Rob, <br/>
My husband struggles with the same things that you mentioned.   When<br/>
we first got married (many MANY years ago! ha!)  his grandparents<br/>
and/or father would ask if we would be attending church that weekend<br/>
(their tradition was to attend church together and then go out for<br/>
lunch)  if he said we were planning on it then he absolutely just<br/>
could not get up in the morning and NOT go!   There were times when we<br/>
decided we were tired or just didn&#39;t feel like going to church that<br/>
morning but he really had a big problem with it!   I think the biggest<br/>
issue for him was that if we didn&#39;t go we would be reminded that we<br/>
didn&#39;t go (don&#39;t you know you go straight to special hell if you don&#39;t<br/>
go to church with your overbearing, guilt inducing grandparents and<br/>
father every Sunday? or at least in the south you do)  his grandmother<br/>
and his father can induce guilt for things you never even thought to<br/>
do.   They possessed an ability to see inner motivation in their<br/>
errant, evil family member (I wonder if they can foresee lottery<br/>
numbers? ).  It became quite an issue for me because it really wasn&#39;t<br/>
about church or us going or not going or even our word.,..it was about<br/>
control... they wanted it and I at least was not wiling to give it to<br/>
them!    <br/>
<br/>
While I was raised very differently from the way I am raising my<br/>
children my parents were always willing to discuss something that I<br/>
wanted or didn&#39;t want to do and my viewpoint was always valued and<br/>
considered in the decision.    It took my husband a really long time<br/>
to be able to wrest that control from their hands... ok actually his<br/>
grandmother died so that helped but his father is still around and we<br/>
still have issues on occasion where we have to remind him we are<br/>
adults and his opinion wasn&#39;t asked for.  <br/>
<br/>
I struggle with the whole making a commitment to a team thing as well<br/>
but only as it relates to whether the team can continue or not if the<br/>
child decides not to go.   I also ask that the child let someone know<br/>
they aren&#39;t coming if they are expected (common courtesy in my opinion<br/>
which I think is sorely lacking in our society!)   I have also found<br/>
that when my kids sign up for a team or class etc and suddenly don&#39;t<br/>
want to go there&#39;s usually a reason ...rarely is it just they don&#39;t<br/>
want to that day.   Usually it&#39;s a situation that can be worked out by<br/>
me helping them role play a good solution or giving them something<br/>
that might help them see the viewpoint of another person and there<br/>
have been times I have spoken to the teacher or coach.   <br/>
<br/>
One time in particular my oldest suddenly wanted to quit an activity<br/>
she had LOVED ... it was time to leave for the activity and she burst<br/>
into tears and said she really just wanted to quit!   Once we talked<br/>
about it I found out that a leader she really respected had been<br/>
really sarcastic and grumpy to the kids the last few meetings and her<br/>
feelings were really hurt.    I spoke to the leader and he was very<br/>
upset that some stress he was feeling in his life had surfaced in his<br/>
dealings with the kids.. he apologized to Sarah and we now count him<br/>
as a very dear friend.   Now when he says something sarcastic Sarah<br/>
feels comfortable calling him on it because he gave her that<br/>
permission.  It also taught her that adults are not infallible and<br/>
that she is not powerless in such situations.    There are so many<br/>
things in life that make us feel powerless ... it&#39;s great for our kids<br/>
to have situations where they can work out these skills.    <br/>
Heck the darn swim team can probably go right on without the first<br/>
poster&#39;s niece but that little baby cousin she wanted to see will only<br/>
be little for a very short time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653989416">I spoke to a couple of high school *jocks* when my kids were beginning their<br/>
interest in group sports, to get a feel on the *commitment factor* and how<br/>
it plays into their experiences. These girls were seniors in a very small<br/>
town where the coercion was HUGE to play multiple sports.<br/>
One girl was adamant there was nothing worse than teammates who don&#39;t want<br/>
to be there. She&#39;d prefer to play with others who were as happy to be there<br/>
as she was. I think she&#39;d&#39;ve played lots of sports regardless of the<br/>
coercion.<br/>
The other girl agreed and then gave me her parents&#39; party line of &quot;one must<br/>
follow through with their commitments&quot; -- it was obvious those were not her<br/>
own words and all three of us realized it immediately. She then went on to<br/>
say she really only liked ONE of the things she was involved in and excels<br/>
there; the other FOUR activities were the wishes of others and yeah, she<br/>
didn&#39;t give 100% and sometimes it really would be better if the group was<br/>
solely of those who had passion.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Hayden (soon 9) has not been interested in group/team stuff lately. When he<br/>
wanted to play basketball (he was 6.5), he was on a team with a couple of<br/>
friends and decided pretty quickly that this was not for him. He stopped<br/>
going and his friends played with him at other times, it was no big deal<br/>
that the b-ball team wasn&#39;t a match. He still plays basketball and loves it.<br/>
When he wants more or different, he&#39;ll ask and we&#39;ll figure out what to do.<br/>
I started a full moon circle last summer. I don&#39;t go anymore; the women I<br/>
gathered still meet. Cool! It just wasn&#39;t what I needed, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s what<br/>
they need. When/if I need it, the full moon will still be there for me to<br/>
celebrate every month and I&#39;ll still be able to round up some friends to do<br/>
that with.<br/>
