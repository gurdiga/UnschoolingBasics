<div id="ygrps-yiv-399613468">I need some ideas on one of my struggles:<br/>
<br/>
Since I am the sole caretaker of my children, I have this policy of<br/>
&quot;where I am, the kids go, where the kids go, I go.&quot;  There are a few<br/>
exceptions when my parents are able to take them somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting very frustrated since there are some places that I want<br/>
very much to go to and the kids do not.  So I feel resentful and angry<br/>
at the conflict over going.  On the other hand, I am often sick and<br/>
struggling with depression, so it can be hard to get out and about.<br/>
Our schedule changes a lot and we are usually up late at night so the<br/>
kids do not have the wish to go out very often. I want them to ask to<br/>
go places but that&#39;d mean consistent follow-ups on my part as well.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 8 and 4 (twins)  - so I am not too confident on their<br/>
ability to opt out on something and stay home by themselves.  I could<br/>
try with the oldest but not with the youngsters, I think they are too<br/>
young yet.<br/>
<br/>
What are some ways we could work together better on this?  What do you<br/>
all do for your kids, especially single moms?<br/>
