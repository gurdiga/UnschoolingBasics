<br/>
Thanks for replying. I didn&#39;t hear from anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
As it happens we&#39;ve decided to not rent a car for the<br/>
first few days. We&#39;re in a downtown hotel and it was<br/>
expensive to park the car. I&#39;ve figured out how to go<br/>
to the zoo and the science museum by bus. But<br/>
restricted mobility means we&#39;ll probably be spending a<br/>
lot of time by the hotel pool.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for the delay in responding I&#39;ve been behind<br/>
&gt; on emails. Have you been contacted by any <br/>
&gt; other Colorado folks? I live near Denver. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; belong to any Unschooling groups yet <br/>
&gt; though, so I&#39;m unsure about any park days they have.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;d like to meet up and put a face <br/>
&gt; with the name I&#39;d be happy to do that. Our kids are<br/>
&gt; different ages (mine are 4 & 15 months) <br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m sure if we find a park to meet at they will<br/>
&gt; stay entertained:) Well maybe not my 15 <br/>
&gt; month old who I will likely be chasing after! Anyway<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;d like to meet or just want some <br/>
&gt; info about Denver please let me know.<br/>
