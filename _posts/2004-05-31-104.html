Maybe what you are trying to say, is that we are all homeschoolers. Out in mainstream society, I am a homeschooler. Homeschooling is huge and wide and encompasses all of us that choose any kind of home education...yes. But within the homeschooling community, it is helpful to have those distinctions, for better and more efficient communication.<br/>
Someone that does Charlotte Mason and wants to discuss that, won&#39;t want a general homeschool discussion. Someone that believes in an eclectic/relaxed approach, might find the Abeka discussion a bit nauseating, and vice versa.:) I distinguish myself as an unschooler WITHIN the unschooling community, and with those that question the method of education we believe in.<br/>
<br/>
There IS a distinction. Unschooling IS homeschooling, but homeschooling is not always UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If your lists are going to say &quot;homeschooling 101&quot;, &quot;Homeschooling cafe&quot; etc.... (and I DON&#39;T know that&#39;s what you intend, only guessing), then I don&#39;t believe they will be helpful to those that wish to further their understanding of UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The distinction exists. Being unschoolers doesn&#39;t change the fact that we are also homeschoolers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren, in the first two statements I was talking about homeschooling <br/>
and unschooling. In the third one I was talking about school at home <br/>
and natural learning.<br/>
<br/>

that those distinctions were being taken to an extreme, and instead <br/>
of facilitating better and more efficient communication, the result <br/>
was less and less communication.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s more important right now to mend some of the serious <br/>
rifts that have developed over this issue as evidenced by the amazing <br/>
response to my post on unschooling, primarily on our HEM- lists and <br/>
the AHA- lists, but increasingly on smaller local and support group <br/>
lists. This topic has touched a very raw nerve in the homeschooling <br/>
community.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392943246">Hi Jennifer - <br/>
I&#39;m new here too - although not new to homeschooling (been a <br/>
homeschooling family for 9 years) I AM new to unschooling.  I have <br/>
three children 14, 11 and 7 - the two oldest are girls and my <br/>
youngest one is a boy.  I am very interested in finding out more <br/>
about unschooling.  Have you read any of John Holt&#39;s books - or the <br/>
Unschoolers Handbook - I also found Christian Unschooling helpful - <br/>
and a book called Guerilla Learning that is basically written to <br/>
parents of kids in public school - but talks a lot about how that <br/>
kind of rote fact memorization does not work - and it won&#39;t in our <br/>
homeschools either.  An awesome encouragement.  My 14 year old is <br/>
currently reading a book called Real Lives as well.  <br/>
I live in WV - where are you from?<br/>
I hope to talk to you some more - <br/>
Julie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Math.  It&#39;s highly over rated.  I&#39;m not belittling math, but just the<br/>
need to do worksheets in order to learn it.  We learn math as we need<br/>
math.  It sounds like your children need some major help in dealing<br/>
with the loss of their father.  They will have plenty of time to<br/>
&quot;learn math&quot; later.  Right now it sounds like they need to grieve and<br/>
grow and trust.  Forcing them to do structured assignments is not<br/>
going to lead them to a healing place and could cause their healing to<br/>
take longer.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your family finds peace and joy through unschooling.<br/>

way when I was giving up our structured busywork.  I made a promise <br/>
with myself.  If I felt the need to ask the kids to do school work, <br/>
I&#39;d have to complete it myself first.  It&#39;s amazing how quickly I lost <br/>

<br/>
There is NO way you can teach them everything they need to know.  But <br/>
you realize that, right?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a process you must go through yourself, not just your <br/>
children.  That&#39;s been a very helpful thought for me during my journey.<br/>

&gt; you realize that, right?  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no way you can *teach* everything they know -- that is *put*  <br/>
it into their heads -- but you can help them reach what interests  <br/>
them and as a side effect they will learn what they need.<br/>
<br/>
School takes concepts out of the real world and puts them in books.  <br/>
If you have 12 cookies and 3 kids, how many cookies does each kid get  <br/>
is *hard*. But give kids a plate of cookies and they figure it out  <br/>
easily. They *absorb* the meaning of dividing. *Later* they can learn  <br/>
how to represent that in formal mathematical notation. But now, when  <br/>
they&#39;re younger, it&#39;s a lot more important for them to play and mess  <br/>
around with mathematical concepts that come up in the course of their  <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t look like school math. It will look like beating a level on  <br/>
a video game but they&#39;ll be learning far more than it looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Did you teach them -- use workbooks and lessons -- everything they  <br/>
know about English? Or did they just use English to explore what  <br/>
interested them and get what they wanted and *as a side effect* they  <br/>
got better at English.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mysterious process to most people so most people don&#39;t take it  <br/>
seriously. Educational experts *do* take Spanish class seriously  <br/>
because they can test kids to show how well they&#39;re &quot;learning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Real life doesn&#39;t work like that. We have feedback from using things  <br/>
for real life personally meaningful reasons that helps us figure out  <br/>
whether we&#39;re getting it or not. My daughter didn&#39;t have to  <br/>
understand percentages in order to use them in video games. But as  <br/>
she used them, and saw them used in other contexts, she refined her  <br/>
understanding. Then seeing how they&#39;re manipulated with mathematical  <br/>
notation was a piece of cake because she had a good foundation of  <br/>
understanding what percentages are by using them.<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about exploring life. Kids explore their interests and  <br/>
get better at their interests because they *want* to know more. Their  <br/>
life pursuits won&#39;t come from math class. It will come from the  <br/>
things that make them jump out of bed in the morning. They *will*  <br/>
absorb math because it&#39;s part of life -- as a side effect of living.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be worried if all they seem to want to do is explore video  <br/>
games ;-) My daughter watched a lot of cartoons for a couple of  <br/>
years. Not because she&#39;ll be  a professional cartoon watcher ;-) but  <br/>
because the storytelling was absorbing for her.<br/>
<br/>
People fear that kids will avoid math (and history and science and so  <br/>
forth) because schooled kids will. But those subjects aren&#39;t  <br/>
inherently boring. Unschooled kids don&#39;t have the experience with  <br/>
dull textbooks and dull workbooks. Everything is potentially  <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact my daughter has essentially done no formal math  <br/>
yet at 13 decided to take the Statistics class her father teachers at  <br/>
college, then followed it with Contemporary Math and then College  <br/>
Algebra *BECAUSE IT&#39;S FUN* for her. (And -- though high marks aren&#39;t  <br/>
the goal of unschooling -- she was near the top when not at the top  <br/>
of the 3 classes -- &quot;competing&quot; against kids who had had years of  <br/>
preparation. That makes it seem as though preparation has the  <br/>
opposite effect!) She doesn&#39;t have 12 years of experience with math  <br/>
being dull so she takes it because it&#39;s an interest.<br/>

first started unschooling, I found a small project or two that would appease  that <br/>
part of me that likes to do things &quot;in order&quot;.  I bought a learn to  play the <br/>

free courses (you have to buy the book) on many subjects at BN  University on <br/>

 <br/>
You will be busy appeasing your own needs and your children will be  learning <br/>
in their own way!  <br/>
