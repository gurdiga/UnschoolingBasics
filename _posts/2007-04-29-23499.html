<div id="ygrps-yiv-523917567">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list for a long time, but not participating much. My daughter turned 5 in March and this fall would be when she would go to kindergarten. Right now she goes to a pre&quot;school&quot; that is nothing like school. They play in the woods, do arts and crafts and sing & dance. That sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known I want to unschool with my children since I learned what it is. I asked all of the usual questions that we all ask and have come full circle to a knowing that this is the best way for children to learn, and retain their love of learning for their lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
What I need now is to find the other unschoolers in our area. We live in Greenfield, MA. I know of some homeschoolers around, but the ones I know are more into school at home. So if anyone can give me some pointers as to how you went about finding your local unschoolers, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923009094">Welcome Tracy! We&#39;re in Lowell MA. I suggest joining<br/>
NewEnglandUnschooling yahoo group and posting this<br/>
question there.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ahem.info/">http://ahem.info/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mhla.org/">http://mhla.org/</a> are good<br/>
sources for support groups and all the legal stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people we know do more school than us. But<br/>
honestly, that hasn&#39;t been a big issue. Our kids still<br/>
meet for play dates, occasional field trips and in the<br/>
summer time for park days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268071014">Tracy -It can be  difficult to meet other unschoolers- though I have met some nice homeschoolers in my area. Have you tried the NewEnglandUnschooling yahoo group? A fewof our local homeschool friends  have gone the unschooling route, others are more &#39;school at home&#39;.  We still enjoy seeing  all of our homeschooling friends (even the ones who are not unschooling)  for playtime and some fun trips to the museum or the beach or bowling, etc.,  It used to feel a little awkward to be in a group setting where some of the homeschooling moms would discuss their &#39;teaching methods&#39; or curriculum etc.,   although as the years go by I am much more confident in our unschooling so I am less bothered ..... Actually I used to feel awkward because I felt the &#39;school at homers&#39; would think me negligent for not formally instructing my children or &#39;doing school&#39; in some way. Now I feel awkard because it is sometimes tough to bite my tongue and be respectful of others&#39; choices to home educate  in a &#39;sch<br/>
ool at home &#39; fashion knowing how wonderful unschooling is.... LOL!  . Interesting how things change..... <br/>
