<div id="ygrps-yiv-194057551">The article doesn&#39;t really say much more then teens are playing a lot of games with some of them being &#39;over&#39; their heads.  Lol.  Reminds me of a conversation with my sister&#39;s husband last Sunday.  We offered to pass along some old computer games to my nephew.  His father said, &quot;Only if they don&#39;t have adult content.&quot;  Gee, like we buy &#39;adult content&#39; for our ten year old or like he would even have an interest in &#39;adult content&#39;.  And what qualifies &#39;adult content&#39; anyway?  Since my 10yo just passed the CPT assessment (he took it for fun since his sister was taking it, too), does that mean he shouldn&#39;t read books at his &#39;learning level&#39; because he is only ten?  I would have a very unhappy kid if I told him to stay on his &#39;age level&#39;, lol.  He loves everything that goes in depth about animal biology.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743901099">well drat.  The article that linked to that article talked about how in<br/>
video games like SIM city that being a mayor teaches kids WAY more about<br/>
civics than they could ever learn from a text book etc...I&#39;m swamped today<br/>
with stuff with the kids (Morgan age 4) just got a doll house and we have<br/>
some SERIOUS pretending to do!  Or I&#39;d dig deeper.  PFFT...sorry to forward<br/>
something that wasn&#39;t worth it.<br/>
