<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311879516">FWIW, back in the mid 90s, when our twins were little, we were not allowed to rent a 1 bedroom apartment for the 4 of us; we had to get a 2 bedroom unit... we probably could have rented a 1 bedroom HOUSE with no problem...then once our 3rd child came along, we would have had to get a 3 bedroom apartment (the law in Texas apparently says something along the lines of 1 bedroom for every 2 people in apartments) but had no problem renting a 2 bedroom house...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with gender but with the number of people or somesuch nonsense...<br/>
<br/>
FYI I found information about # of occupants here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.reiclub.com/articles/occupancy-standards-policy">http://www.reiclub.com/articles/occupancy-standards-policy</a><br/>

it was a specific number of square feet per person.  No one ever said<br/>
anything to me about bedrooms.  We just fit into the house we were renting.<br/>
Then when my co-parent moved in with us we were over the limit.  We just<br/>
didn&#39;t say anything to the property managers.  But we were also looking to<br/>
buy a house at that time, so it wasn&#39;t much of an issue anyway.<br/>
