<div id="ygrps-yiv-989788252">I am interesting in anyone who&#39;s had experience with specifically Yu-<br/>
Gi-Oh cards.  This has become a passion/obsession with my son that <br/>
started when he was in school two years ago.  I am working so hard <br/>
with my husband on moderation instead of banning them completely; <br/>
clinging to the positive learning and skills my son has developed <br/>
with them like negotiating, classifying, reading, math, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Unlike many of his friends, he is meticulous with his collection and <br/>
his interest is more intense.  It is similar to our experience with <br/>
LEGO in that he was obsessed with Legos but none of his friends <br/>
shared the same level of interest.  I am realizing that with his <br/>
personality, if it&#39;s not Yu-Gi-Oh it would be something else.  I feel <br/>
he has addictive/compulsive tendencies but I also see him trying to <br/>
connect with other boys with this on some level.  <br/>
<br/>
I can see how crushed he is when my husband mutters a mouthful of <br/>
negative sentences when he sees him constantly engrossed in his <br/>
collection.  My husband gets bored and frustrated with the constant <br/>
talk about this card or that cards and I worry that by not taking an <br/>
interest or coming down too hard on this interest will make our son <br/>
feel bad or shamed about something he really truly enjoys.  <br/>
<br/>
The cards have been recently banned at a homeschooling group we <br/>
attend.  Several parents object to the cards, other kids have had <br/>
difficulty with trades and stealing cards and the whole thing taking <br/>
on a life of its own.  I am trying to see how my new &#39;unschooling&#39; <br/>
approach works this one out.  My initial thoughts are to limit his <br/>
involvement to a monthly Yu-Gi-Oh gathering at our library but <br/>
clearly, at this point, that won&#39;t be enough since he&#39;s not allowed <br/>
to bring them to our weekly homeschooling group.  I am trying to find <br/>
other venues for playing with them.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or shared experience would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755085042">I don&#39;t have lots of time to type now, but here are a few thoughts.  No limits.  This &quot;finding value&quot; and limiting in the cards sounds much like the conversations about video games I&#39;ve heard so often.  To bring/force mainstream educational values in something he enjoys just serves to cheapen his interest.  If he was interested in plumbing (in that it&#39;s a skill that has common value outside of educational norms), would you limit him??  <br/>
   <br/>
  Maybe you could strew some Yu Gi Oh things to broaden his interest.  There&#39;s a Yu Gi Oh video game for PS2 which my son enjoys.  There are puzzles, stickers, books, drawing books, toys, a dueling deck, and more, I&#39;m sure.  <br/>
   <br/>
  To connect with others who play Yu Gi Oh, try asking at the library if they know of a group or at the toy store (not Wal Mart, but a toy store.  Our local KB Toyworks has groups posted).  <br/>
   <br/>
  For your dh, try explaining it in terms of something he really likes.  My dh is glued to the TV now with basketball playoffs.  He watches them freely, no limits, no barraging, no nagging (I don&#39;t even ask him to take out the trash!!  LOL!!).  Your son&#39;s passion deserves the same respect.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Fwiw, my 9yo son loves video games.  Some days &quot;that&#39;s all he does&quot;.  We&#39;ve learned to read from them, we&#39;ve learned value, numbers, community, and *much* more.  At first, to &quot;allow&quot; my dh to connect to what was going on, I pointed out the &quot;educational&quot; value to the games (not to mention thinking skills!!!).  Once he saw the mainstream value, he was able to let go a little easier.  <br/>

My 9 year old goes through stints of this with Yu-Gi-Oh. Total immersion. I<br/>

it. Why do you refer to it as an obsession? And why do you have to be able<br/>

all only pursue things that are considered educational? How do you know what<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would feel terribly hurt if I had an interest and my hubby was constantly<br/>
telling me how useless it was and that he was sick of hearing about it. Do<br/>
you all do this to each other? Is your son less significant or important<br/>
than adults? Would you treat your adult friends this way?<br/>

<br/>
Wonderful! He is meticulous and careful with his collection. That&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re worried about. Do you think he&#39;ll be<br/>
18 and still not want to do anything but play Yu-Gi-Oh cards? He will grow<br/>
out of it just like he grew out of Legos. His interests will change through<br/>
the years. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331832021">I&#39;m not sure how old your son is, so this may or may not be <br/>
relevant.  But my son was big-time into Magic: the Gathering.  His <br/>
old boy scout troop had a lot of kids who were into it, and they <br/>
used to go early to trade, play, whatever.  Sometimes they got <br/>
together outside of scouts for the same.<br/>
<br/>
We have moved twice, and a new obsession has supplanted it <br/>
(Runescape), and we currently don&#39;t know anyone who plays, haven&#39;t <br/>
scoped out the card stores, etc.  Oh -- the stores where they <br/>
specialize in cards, Magic, Yu-gi-o, poke-man, the whole works, <br/>
often are good places to meet others with similar interests.<br/>
<br/>
As for your dh -- perhaps you can talk with him privately about <br/>
this, when he is in a good mood, point out to him that many people <br/>
(even adults) collect these cards, etc.  (You should see my dh&#39;s MTG <br/>
(Magic...) collection.  And his Lego collections.  And his <br/>
collection of wargames....) <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck in finding others with similar interest for your son!<br/>

true passion for their interests anymore.  Your son has a wonderful passion<br/>
and look at all the positive things he is doing with his passion.  He takes<br/>
care of them, inventories them, classifies them, appraises them, and<br/>
collects them.  Those are all wonderful skills to have!  How wonderful that<br/>
you value his passions and allow him to pursue them!  How many parents would<br/>
allow their child the opportunity to do what your son is doing and<br/>
understand the significance of all he is learning through this &quot;hobby&quot; of<br/>
his?<br/>

I wish more people had passions for the things they do in life.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s wonderful! Support it, encourage it, nurture it --- he&#39;ll be a  <br/>

his passions when he was young.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful about attaching any negativity to this tendency, it is  <br/>
fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter like this - passionately intense about whatever her  <br/>
current interest might be. When she was about 8, I asked someone what  <br/>
they thought about her obsession with karate - she was in a karate  <br/>
class, she wanted to go to every single class, twice a day, if  <br/>
possible. And she practiced hand forms and lessons at home,  <br/>
constantly. She was SO into it -- I wondered if there was something  <br/>
wrong with her - some obsessive/compulsive trait that might even be a  <br/>
(gasp) &quot;disorder.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My friend told me that I should be so lucky to find a passion of my  <br/>
own like that!<br/>
<br/>
Good response. Changed the way I saw my daughter and it was just a  <br/>
year later we because unschoolers. Coincidence? I think not! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
YES!!<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget a moment at Books-A-Million in Pensacola. I ran into<br/>
a former homeschooling Mom that I&#39;d known a few years before. She&#39;d<br/>
put her son back in school because &quot;he just wouldn&#39;t do his work&quot;, I<br/>
said &quot;why don&#39;t you forget about all that crap and let him follow his<br/>
interests?&quot;<br/>
She informed me that unschooling would NOT work for him because he had<br/>
NO interests at ALL. I felt like I&#39;d been sitting in crap..yucky all<br/>
over because her son was right behind us playing Yu-gi-oh happily.<br/>
<br/>
No interests? He had plenty of interests, just not the kind she deemed<br/>
&quot;worthy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The keynote talk at NorthEast Unschooling conference is titled<br/>
&quot;Portals to Knowledge&quot;....it&#39;s all about how ANY interest leads to<br/>
everything in the universe. My &quot;portal&quot; for the talk is Chocolate. But<br/>
it could just as easily be Yu-gi-oh, bugs, clouds, World of Warcraft,<br/>
paint, makeup, Lizzy McGuire or toes.:)<br/>

message board is such an amazing resource.  The fact is, when my husband<br/>
spouted more frustration last week, my soon to be 9 yr old said, with tears<br/>
in his eyes, &quot;Dad, don&#39;t you have a hobby you love?&quot;  The biggest problem I<br/>
am having is that it becomes so exclusive to his other talents and<br/>
interests.  And yes, there is a part of me that is deeming this &#39;unworthy&#39;<br/>
of his time.  I know this is the wrong approach and will definitely keep<br/>
reading because I really do want to support him completely.  I suppose at<br/>
one time my parents could have viewed my musical talents as unworthy and<br/>
where would I be?<br/>

  interest or coming down too hard on this interest will make our son<br/>
  feel bad or shamed about something he really truly enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I would feel terribly hurt if I had an interest and my hubby was<br/>
constantly<br/>
  telling me how useless it was and that he was sick of hearing about it. Do<br/>
  you all do this to each other? Is your son less significant or important<br/>
  than adults? Would you treat your adult friends this way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ----Unlike many of his friends, he is meticulous with his collection and<br/>
  his interest is more intense.  It is similar to our experience with<br/>
  LEGO in that he was obsessed with Legos but none of his friends<br/>
  shared the same level of interest.  I am realizing that with his<br/>
  personality, if it&#39;s not Yu-Gi-Oh it would be something else.  I feel<br/>
  he has addictive/compulsive tendencies but I also see him trying to<br/>
  connect with other boys with this on some level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Wonderful! He is meticulous and careful with his collection. That&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re worried about. Do you think he&#39;ll be<br/>
  18 and still not want to do anything but play Yu-Gi-Oh cards? He will grow<br/>
  out of it just like he grew out of Legos. His interests will change<br/>
through<br/>
  the years.<br/>

Zoom out. Over YEARS he will have many opportunities and plenty of  <br/>
time to pursue other talents and interests. Really. He could  <br/>
rediscover interests and still have talents even when he&#39;s a grown  <br/>

 I am interesting in anyone who&#39;s had experience with specifically Yu-<br/>
 Gi-Oh cards. This has become a passion/obsession with my son that<br/>
 started when he was in school two years ago. I am working so hard<br/>
 with my husband on moderation instead of banning them completely;<br/>
 clinging to the positive learning and skills my son has developed<br/>
 with them like negotiating, classifying, reading, math, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Experience? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 We live, eat, and breathe Yu-Gi-Oh! here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I can see how crushed he is when my husband mutters a mouthful of<br/>
 negative sentences when he sees him constantly engrossed in his<br/>
 collection. My husband gets bored and frustrated with the constant<br/>
 talk about this card or that cards and I worry that by not taking an<br/>
 interest or coming down too hard on this interest will make our son<br/>
 feel bad or shamed about something he really truly enjoys.<br/>
<br/>

  Ben (my husband) did this to Cameron pre-unschooling when Cameron was <br/>
really into magic. &quot;Pick a card---any card&quot; can get old to even the <br/>
most die-hard magic fan! &lt;G&gt; And Ben doesn&#39;t care too much for magic. <br/>
Cameron and I worked out that he should *really* just use me as his <br/>
stooge until he&#39;d truly mastered a trick. Then do it *once* for his <br/>
dad! On a *good* day! As good as Cameron became at magic, I don&#39;t think <br/>
Ben *really* misses it as Cam&#39;s all-consuming passion. I do! :-(<br/>
<br/>
  Luckily, he traded magic for music and film, passions Ben can enjoy! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think there&#39;s a real possibility that he could be made to feel bad <br/>
about his passion. It wouldn&#39;t change the fact that he IS passionate. <br/>
But it would certainly change the way he looks at his dad! Is that what <br/>
your husband wants?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The cards have been recently banned at a homeschooling group we<br/>
 attend.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Bummer! And that only increases the children&#39;s need to pursue it---the <br/>
whole supply/demand thang. But more importantly, it makes the children <br/>
seem small and less than.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Several parents object to the cards, other kids have had<br/>
 difficulty with trades and stealing cards and the whole thing taking<br/>
 on a life of its own.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I saw a little of that when Duncan first started with the Yu-Gi-Oh! <br/>
cards. He went to a Yu-Gi game day at a Barnes & Noble---some of the <br/>
bigger kids would look through his deck and offer 20! cards for ONE of <br/>
Dunc&#39;s. Duncan was thrilled! He didn&#39;t realize how valuable that one <br/>
card was. There were a couple of older kids who kind of kept an eye on <br/>
a few of the ...ummm...trickier kids. Duncan learned not to trade with <br/>
a few certain kids---and which ones were there to help him out.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am trying to see how my new &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
 approach works this one out. My initial thoughts are to limit his<br/>
 involvement to a monthly Yu-Gi-Oh gathering at our library but<br/>
 clearly, at this point, that won&#39;t be enough since he&#39;s not allowed<br/>
 to bring them to our weekly homeschooling group. I am trying to find<br/>
 other venues for playing with them.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
  Try Barnes & Noble or other gaming stores. Dragons & Heroes here in <br/>
town has huge Saturday tournaments. Another baseball trading store has <br/>
once a month tournaments.<br/>
<br/>
  For Duncan&#39;s birthday this year, we had a Yu-Gi-Oh! party. We emptied <br/>
the music studio of instruments and put up Yu-Gi posters. We set up <br/>
several tables for play and got an older boy to be the judge. I had <br/>
decks of cards as prizes and smaller packs and Yu-Gi pencils and wrist <br/>
bands and such as favors. We played _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie_ DVD in the <br/>
background. We had origami paper and manga drawing books with plenty of <br/>
paper for the non-players. We served rice balls, tuna and cucumber roll <br/>
maki, teriyaki chicken, and Japanese sweets---all with chop sticks. We <br/>
had a Yu-Gi cake. Duncan wore his kimono and his sandals. We had a <br/>
Yu-Gi pinata! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  To show you that&#39;s not even far enough! ---Duncan has a Yu-Gi-Oh! <br/>
room. I painted the walls a royal blue. One wall has a 5&#39;X5&#39; full-color <br/>
Yu-Gi on it. The opposite wall has a Three-headed Blue-eyes Ultimate <br/>
Dragon (8&#39;X10&#39;). Other walls have smaller figures of the Dark Magician, <br/>
Dark Magician Girl, Karibo, and some freaky bat! He has a Yu-Gi <br/>
bedspread and pillow cases and a blanket.<br/>
<br/>
  His room *was* a Batman room before---with a glow-in-the-dark <br/>
batsignal, a batmobile, and Gotham City painted on the walls! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I really do believe in feeding passions! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe show this to your husband---maybe he&#39;ll see *your* son&#39;s <br/>
interest as normal once he sees how crazy *I* am! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously---this will NOT last forever. He&#39;ll move on to another <br/>
passion. Be as supportive as your budget allows. It&#39;s relatively cheap, <br/>
as passions go! He&#39;s learning all SORTS of cool things: patterning, <br/>
sequencing, categorizing, reading (and *tiny* print, at that! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
managing money, caring for his psoessions. GOOD, IMPORTANT STUFF!<br/>
<br/>
Enable him!<br/>
<br/>
Oh! And enjoy it while you got it. You&#39;re going to miss it when it&#39;s <br/>
gone!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the *next* passion going to be? &lt;g&gt; Your husband may be begging <br/>
him to go back to Yu-Gi! You never know! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Maybe you could host a Yu-Gi-Oh day weekly or biweekly. Surely there are <br/>
other kids in the group feeling bereft because they can&#39;t play there any more. <br/>
