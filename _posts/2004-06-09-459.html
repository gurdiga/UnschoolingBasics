<div id="ygrps-yiv-501617616">Hi.  I am Millie from near Mobile, AL and have been lurking for a little while.  My son is not yet school age but I think we are already unschooling.  I read a good bit of John Holt&#39;s work and agreed with everything I read...tho I must admit that a lot of what I have seen posted on unschooling lists (not necessarily this one) have turned me off slightly.  I do still think we will unschool.  Anyway, my baby is only 2 but can read and is becoming a computer whiz as well.  He wants to play on the computer all day and I am allowing this, although my husband is terrified that he will delete something important.  And this is a real risk!  He&#39;s a quick clicker and when I leave the room for half a minute to pee or something, I come back and he has 25 windows up, has connected to the internet, etc.  He did manage to open one of my word documents and &quot;type letters&quot; in front of it...tho there was no harm done.  DH and I know very little about computers, so I was hoping one of you might could<br/>
 tell me how we can lock him out of our files.  I have been trying to teach him to only play his own games or notepad or paint, but you know he wants to click on everything to &quot;see what dis do.&quot;  I found some freeware programs that seemed to me to just lock the whole computer and make the keyboard make funny sounds when they bang on it...I don&#39;t want that...Will would be taking the computer apart &quot;tryin to fix it,&quot; and I don&#39;t want to lock him out of the computer (tho dh does)!   Please excuse my ignorance and thanks for any suggestions.<br/>

*****Welcome Millie. Would you mind saying what turned you off? <br/>
Maybe some of us can shed light on it (or also be turned off) :-)<br/>
<br/>

Hi, Millie. What&#39;s turned you off? <br/>

I&#39;d seriously consider getting him his own computer. A used one? You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to hook it up to the &#39;net---just download his games----with none of your  <br/>
stuff on it. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure you could get one for next to nothing----just for games!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985889536">WOW!  Will is a real go getter isn&#39;t he!<br/>
  If you check under the help files listed anywhere on your pc (not sure what <br/>
you are running, like Win 98,2000, xp?)  you will find info on how to <br/>
password proctect files. BUT, that strong little Will is learning about computers the <br/>
way I did, by just doing it!  This may not be feasible, but could you find a <br/>
used pc somewhere (and I did hear in some states they loan out PC&#39;s to hs&#39;ers) <br/>
for his use only?  <br/>
The 1st time I crashed my PC I was closing out some files and, bam, closed <br/>
the wrong thing, and it was gone.  So my next lesson was how to reformat and put <br/>
it all back on the computer again.  <br/>
  Will and would get along so well.....&lt;g&gt; !!!<br/>
If you haven&#39;t come up with a solution yet, let me know what you are running <br/>
and i&#39;ll check into what or if you can do anything, before he has to take it <br/>
apart and see the insides!  (which by the way was really fun for me to do!)<br/>
em me personally<br/>

We worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he<br/>
is someone today.<br/>
