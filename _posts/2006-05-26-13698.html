<div id="ygrps-yiv-892977041">I&#39;ve written often about my son Keon and his inability to self regulate<br/>
because of his autism.  It&#39;s something we have worked really hard on helping<br/>
him learn.  Things like recognizing when he is full, tired, has to go to the<br/>
bathroom.  While I haven&#39;t put too many limits on him, I do have to tell him<br/>
things like, &quot;Keon, you&#39;ve only been up for an hour and a half and you have<br/>
had a bowl of cereal, 3 eggs with cheese, a bagel, a cup of juice, an apple,<br/>
and a slice of cheese.  I think your tummy may be full.  Come back in 20<br/>
minutes and if you are hungry, then we will look into something else to<br/>
eat.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t recognize &quot;I&#39;m so full I&#39;m about to puke.&quot;  (And he has.)<br/>
We&#39;ve had to the the same with sleeping &quot;Sweetie, you look exhausted and you<br/>
know you will be up at the crack of dawn.  It&#39;s after 8:00 and you want to<br/>
get a good night&#39;s sleep so you will be fresh in the morning.&quot; He has an<br/>
agreed upon bedtime of 8:05 (and yes, the :05 part is very important - and<br/>
he is usually out by 8:07). And the same thing with pooing (I&#39;ll save you<br/>
that conversation LOL!)  Lately I&#39;ve been sort of testing the waters to see<br/>
if he has made any progress and it seems he has to some degree.  Twice this<br/>
past week he has said that he is full after eating what one would consider a<br/>
normal size portion.  He has only had one poo accident in 10 days (someone<br/>
knock some wood for me) and while I haven&#39;t been reminding him about his<br/>
bedtime I&#39;ve noticed that around 8:15 he is heading off to bed on his own.<br/>
In fact last night I had a meeting to go to and didn&#39;t get home until 9:00<br/>
or so.  I figured he would still be up, but he was not.  I asked Mary Elayne<br/>
what time he went to bed and she said, &quot;Must have been before 8 because<br/>
(some tv show) was on.  He said he was tired and needed to go to sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how exciting this is!!!  It&#39;s that small little<br/>
breakthrough that I&#39;ve been hoping for for him.  He has made some tremendous<br/>
leaps lately in some areas that have previously made him seem younger than<br/>
he is.  It&#39;s hard on him because he is a very tall and heavy child for his<br/>
age (almost 8 and he is closing the gap on my 5&#39; quickly) so people<br/>
automatically assume he is older but then he says something and it is like<br/>
talking to a 4 or 5 year old unless you are talking about one of his<br/>
interest areas and then he seems like some sort of savant.  I just know that<br/>
one day he is going to be able to make decisions for himself, self-regulate<br/>
and be as free as his sisters.  He isn&#39;t aware of the difference, so it<br/>
hasn&#39;t been an issue of, &quot;Well, Emily gets to stay up as late as she wants<br/>
and eat whatever and whenever she wants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that are doubting that your child can learn to<br/>
self-regulate and become in tune with their own bodies, know that they CAN<br/>
and WILL if you help them.  For some children it is going to take more<br/>
assistance from parents and for other children it is going to mean taking<br/>
hands off completely.  I&#39;ve had both in my home and I&#39;ve seen it work.  It&#39;s<br/>
taken us 3 years to get this far with Keon, so if it doesn&#39;t work for you in<br/>
a week, a month or even a year, know that it *will* eventually.  Help your<br/>
child and trust your child.<br/>
