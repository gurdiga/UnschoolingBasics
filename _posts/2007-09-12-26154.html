<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243185633">As Fall weather hits our area, I am enjoying the breeze, sitting out late on <br/>
the porch, and all the other things that come with Fall. Then it hits me, <br/>
Christmas is coming!<br/>
<br/>
I am so sick of Christmas. Let me change that, I am sick of the Christmas <br/>
gift frenzy.<br/>
<br/>
I need an option to opt out. I would rather buy the things my children want <br/>
when I can afford it and they want it. But the extended family would have a <br/>
melt down. And my kids do enjoy getting gifts from them, so maybe my <br/>
immediate family should have our own Christmas in the summer?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestion on what I might do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502850502">Wildflower, I had my Christmas meltdown years and<br/>
years and years ago, before I had kids even. The most<br/>
important thing to remember is what Christmas is all<br/>
about. We celebrate Christmas to remember God&#39;s gift<br/>
of his son to us. So, instead of running around<br/>
spending money on &quot;things&quot; we do other things to keep<br/>
the spirit of Christmas. We have done a number of<br/>
things over the years but with the kids we have taken<br/>
to adopting an entire family. Not from one of those<br/>
public wish trees but from a priest or social worker<br/>
or someone that can help us with our questions (sizes,<br/>
toy desires, food allergies). Christmas is a time for<br/>
wants not needs so we try to get fun things as well as<br/>
needed items and lots of food, some fun and some<br/>
necessary for the kids and adults. My kids go through<br/>
the ads looking for the best sales for what they want<br/>
to buy and spend hours going through coupons and<br/>
matching them with grocery circulars. We buy big<br/>
quantities in Costco too. It will do your heart good,<br/>
trust me.<br/>
For family we do simple things, generally consumable.<br/>
Learn how to make candy, paint chocolate, roll candles<br/>
with beeswax, make stationary, I&#39;m sure you can think<br/>
of lots of crafts the kids would like to try. The only<br/>
exception I make is for my 85 year old mother, I use<br/>
Christmas as an excuse to buy her something she<br/>
desperately needs but can&#39;t afford, usually a house<br/>
repair type item. Let your family know that you chose<br/>
to put your resources to help a needy family. It would<br/>
be un-Christian for them to complain, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
Better yet, invite them to do it too!! To round out<br/>
Christmas make sure you write in stone some fun<br/>
outings. I found that once they were on the calendar<br/>
we were more likely to go than just saying we wanted<br/>
to go. Pick a night to drive around town and see<br/>
lights and a Christmas concert and whatever special<br/>
event is in your proximity. And don&#39;t forget the<br/>
Nutcracker! Make fun traditions instead of money ones.<br/>
My dh is Santa at the Y&#39;s breakfast every year, then<br/>
we go cut down our Christmas tree.  Oddly, my dh is<br/>
also the one who sets up the haunted house for<br/>
Halloween! My kids know they will get what they need<br/>
and want and they honestly love what we do. Just jump<br/>
off the bandwagon- you&#39;ll be glad you did!!<br/>

<br/>
Christmas is all about different things for different people here. I<br/>
prefer to tap into some of the more ancient aspects of that season by<br/>
celebrating the solstices. <br/>

and unschooling life in that way.  <br/>

<br/>
Can you be more specific about the parts that are causing stress?  We<br/>
love a big Christmas celebration here, but we&#39;ve brought &quot;chosen<br/>
family&quot; in for celebrating with as our extended family is far away.<br/>
<br/>
Can you start earlier in the year? We also try to purchase things our<br/>
kids want all year, but there are still items we get at Christmas.<br/>
Something we&#39;ve done with extended family is a name drawing. That way<br/>
you can focus on purchasing one nicer gift for the person you draw,<br/>
rather than something smaller for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s between my sisters and I. Last year we drew a family name and the<br/>
idea was a gift the whole family could enjoy (games, food etc..). I<br/>
really like to just have the cousins draw a name and do it that way,<br/>
it changes every year.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839170392">I have already been buying things through the year but I sat my dollar<br/>
limits low this year ($50 per child compared to almost $250 over the years,<br/>
yes, that is why we are in such debt) but I really want to celebrate<br/>
Christmas for what it means for our particular religion (Christian) and quit<br/>
buying so much into the commercialism of the holiday.  I then suggest taking<br/>
a family cruise with the money we normally spend buying things we really<br/>
don�t need.   My mother has always wanted to see Alaska and our small<br/>
weekend get-away to the �Ocean� (Corpus Christi and San Antonio) meant more<br/>
to my 6 and 2 year old than any toy gathering dust in their toy boxes.  We<br/>
also gathered several �Lifepacks� from our church where we fill them with<br/>
things we think the homeless begging on the street might need and hubby<br/>
passes them out.  <br/>

it was then that I carried you.&quot;<br/>
