<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927499965">I wanted to post and say what has been happening in my house this past weekend.  As I posted we are new to unschooling but have been homeschooling for a bit with some virtual school as well.  My children have amazed me beyond belief.  My 8 year old who hates to read asked me last night if we could go to the library and read all day tomorrow I almost fell over said yes and ran to my room to jump up and down LOL.  My 10 year old twins and my 8 year old have been busy all weekend and today learning things I never was able to teach them in a book.  We made ants on a log and my twins saw a chef on the cooking channel say that you should peel the strings off the back to make it easier to eat so we did and they prompty told me we needed to go out and find some bugs to feed them too I was so proud....we spent most of the weekend making sculptures and painting then tonight we sat down for cocoa and we have placemats with the United States on them on the table just because we had them from the virtual school and they are convient but my kids had this huge discussion on where different cities were and where their cousins live and so forth using the directions correctly and right and left as well something they have never been able to grasp .  So while perhaps a small feat it was true joy for me to see this in my kids and to feel good about saying yes to most things they asked for without worrying about a mess or trying to control things .....what a difference indeed.  I do have a few questions if I may...what do any of you do when your kids are mean to each other or to themselves?  I have taken the no rules and using the principles of love and respect to heart so I was wondering how you handle that.....also now I live in Arizona so there are not any rules for so called &quot;homeschooling&quot; but I know in other states they are pretty strick how do you meet your requirements and what do you send in..just wondering in case we ever move.  thanks a ton all of you I went through and read almost every post since the beginning of this group and I felt so inspired and so filled with joy and the knowledge that this is how my family is to live....I love it.<br/>
