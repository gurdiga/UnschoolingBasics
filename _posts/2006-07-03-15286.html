<div id="ygrps-yiv-87981873">&quot;Can you suggest other resources you have found helpful (for the lay<br/>
person) regarding non-attachment and mindfulness practice?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I ADORE Jon Kabbat-Zinn for sure! I keep that book (Wherever you<br/>
go, there you are) close by at all times and have quoted it in more<br/>
than one talk.:)<br/>
<br/>
I also love &quot;Zen, it&#39;s history and teachings&quot; by Osho. Osho really<br/>
gets to the core of the matter for me, like a knife cutting away the<br/>
darkness to reveal enlightenment. He&#39;s hard core Zen (if there&#39;s such<br/>
a thing), but I feel like it was the &quot;kick in the butt&quot; I needed. He<br/>
speaks to the very core of my being (which is pretty full of chocolate<br/>
and tea, so it&#39;s amazing that anything can really speak to that);)<br/>
<br/>
Simple Abundance by Sarah Ban Breathneck, Excavating Your Authentic<br/>
Self (same author) and Wishcraft by Barbara Scher were all favorites<br/>
at some point in this journey.  <br/>
<br/>
I love Deborah Koff-Chapin&#39;s Soul cards:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.touchdrawing.com/">http://www.touchdrawing.com/</a><br/>
(I&#39;m a facilitator for touch drawing).<br/>
<br/>
OH, one of my favorite resources is soulfulliving.com!! Awesome<br/>
articles by a variety of writers. Really great online magazine.<br/>
<br/>
~And, someone just recently posted how she realized that she was the<br/>
problem/obstacle something along those lines. I discovered the same<br/>
thing. This, in SO many ways, is SO not about my kids, but about ME!<br/>
(Ding!)~<br/>
<br/>
YES!! I am constantly amazed by how much change can happen because of<br/>
one person&#39;s attitude and action.  I can&#39;t control anyone else, not<br/>
really. I CAN control my own reactions and behavior...and that is<br/>
often the thing that affects the MOST change in the household. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
~Something will happen...the things we&#39;d power struggle over in the<br/>
past and DH will say something along the lines of , &quot;OK what I want to<br/>
say is, just do it because I said so&quot; and I&#39;ll go &quot;Uh-huh, but we&#39;re<br/>
not doing that anymore...what is next on your list?&quot; ~<br/>
<br/>
That is really great!! It&#39;s wonderful that you can work together and<br/>
help each other be more gentle.<br/>
<br/>
~It&#39;s so fun working on this puzzle of living life together...when I<br/>
involve my kids (& DH) it&#39;s no longer all my responsibility to make<br/>
sure everything turns out alright...holy granola that was an<br/>
exhausting way to live! ~<br/>
<br/>
Oh it IS!  It&#39;s exhausting to control other people (or try to), it&#39;s<br/>
exhausting to focus on what other people &quot;should&quot; do, or &quot;need to<br/>
learn&quot; or anything else!! <br/>
Your whole post was such a joy to read. Thanks for sharing all the<br/>
lovely changes...it was inspirational!!<br/>

  My mother loves Osho and tells me about him a lot. I have mixed feelings about what her interpretations of what he says about children and parenting.<br/>
  Some I completely agree abut ohters just seems humm....<br/>
  She says Osho is adamant that children should not have parents and should be raised by the community.<br/>
  And he does not believe in family. That parents somehow &quot;spoil&quot; ( not his words she says ) the kids.<br/>
  What do you think? What is your take in that.<br/>
  That is form the book he writes for women.<br/>

I haven&#39;t read enough of his work to know. The book I have, talks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alex, I am not familiar with this particular book or author. But, <br/>
from a &#39;we are all One&#39; pov, I can see the Zen concept of not <br/>
creating the construct of a Self on which the Western cultural <br/>
paradigm is developed philosophically. In the West, the catch is <br/>
that our culture ISN&#39;T a community, imo. Within the community/family <br/>
that we have chosen to surround ourselves, we consistently do work <br/>
to look to the other to see the impact of our actions, rather than <br/>
merely practicing the American philosophy of Me First! And we work <br/>
to extend this to our whole community by living consensually as a <br/>
practice. <br/>
<br/>
The parenting paradigm in the West is very patriarchical. In the <br/>
East, much more communal. Our family is much more communal than the <br/>
Western norm. So, in that way, there isn&#39;t the Me/You adversarial <br/>
role of many parents in our culture. I would presume that most <br/>
radical unschooling families are similarly more communal than <br/>
patriarchical. I would suspect that this is what is implied by the <br/>
above reference to community/family. However, for us, as I <br/>
mentioned, &quot;community&quot; is somewhat limited on a day to day basis as <br/>
a philosophical division AWAY from our culture. We are communal as a <br/>
counter-culture choice. <br/>
<br/>
The focus on relationships is more communal and the antithesis <br/>
of &quot;Me First&quot;. BUT, my Ayn Rand leanings, also influence that &#39;Me <br/>
the Martyr&#39; doesn&#39;t exist either. That is where Living Consensually <br/>
incorporates my interpretation of the Zen pov of living/raised in <br/>
community, where everyone&#39;s needs are held equally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521743688">What she remenbers is that children should not be raised with the &quot;attachment&quot; to the mother & father. Adn that Osho is against marriage so the child would be raised in the community by the community and not the family.<br/>
I see how important it is for my kids to have mom and dad. I just can&#39;t agree with that point he makes. I do understand that he is probably talking about mainstream parenting and does not know unschooling. There are many things he says that I think are great, but I know little about him and only what my mom tells me or read to me. My mom loves most of his ideas ( not all ) . I was just wondering so I would take the time and read some os his writings..<br/>

I guess I just tdon&#39;t like a lot of the history surrounding him (Osho).<br/>
