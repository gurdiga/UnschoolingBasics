<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834676493">Hi, everyone!  My name is Faith and I am brand new to unschooling, <br/>
in fact, so new that my son&#39;s first day of freedom will be at the <br/>
close of the school day this Friday.  He is 15 and a sophomore by <br/>
their tracking methods.  <br/>
<br/>
My only exposure thus far with unschooling is Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook.  I am about 1/2 way through it.  <br/>
<br/>
I only wish I knew about unschooling YEARS ago...Here is the <br/>
history.  I was a single mother since he was born.   He had been in <br/>
daycare from 3 months old.  I began working two jobs from when <br/>
Justin was 4-7. When he entered kindergarten, he had trouble forming <br/>
letters.  As the years progressed, the system slapped a few labels <br/>
on him.  ADHD a fine motor impairment and the like.  We struggled.  <br/>
He never liked school.  Never wanted to sit in his chair.  Would <br/>
walk around the room, and when his teacher called on him, he would <br/>
answer and usually correctly.<br/>
<br/>
(Just for the timeline, I got married when he was 7)  <br/>
<br/>
As he entered high school, his desire to &#39;do as he was told&#39; <br/>
disappeared!  Most of our dissagreements and sruggles stemmed from <br/>
him not doing his homework or the &#39;chores&#39; I imposed. We had <br/>
punishments (take away the things he likes: video <br/>
games/tv/ipod/etc.) and he would have to earn them back.  Based on <br/>
his conformity - is really what it boiled down to...(I know!!! <br/>
Appalling - as it sounds now!!)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know of any other way.  <br/>
<br/>
I found out about unschooling at the end of this summer through a  <br/>
business associate and immediately thought this would suit my son&#39;s <br/>
personality.  What I am discovering is it is not so much the absence <br/>
of school but more a lifestyle.  A life of peace.  Living in the <br/>
moment.  Trusting your child.  Letting his life be his own.<br/>
<br/>
Justin&#39;s initial reaction was in favor.  Then as he thought about <br/>
it, he became scared.  More afraid of losing his friends than <br/>
leaving school.  We live directly across the street from his school <br/>
and usually have a half a dozen kids here on most days.  I am <br/>
encouraging him through that fear and confident he will soon see the <br/>
light!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose my intention in writing today is for all of your words of <br/>
support.  This transition is going to require me to &#39;let go&#39; of the <br/>
way I was raised in favor of a more holistic life.  It sounds like a <br/>
no brainer!  But I am afraid old habits die hard.<br/>
<br/>
To add to this challenge, my husband, Kurt, (Justin&#39;s stepfather) is <br/>
unfamiliar with unschooling entirely.  I tell him that Justin and I <br/>
will be homeschooling.  He&#39;s okay with that concept.  I look forward <br/>
to the &quot;list&quot; Sandy is compiling for her dh.  :-)  Kurt is very <br/>
traditional in his beliefs or maybe just his habits.  His family was <br/>
very much a dictatorship and he tends to think children are to <br/>
follow instructions without question.  You know, that &quot;respect for <br/>
authority&quot; bull... My advantage is my mother and I had a <br/>
relationship where there was more mutual respect.  I respected the <br/>
rules because she valued me and respected me, too.  Any words of <br/>
wisdom to get him in sync will be appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all for now.  Looking forward to the support of this <br/>
group as Justin and I and Kurt embark on our journey of finally <br/>
living a life!  By the way, I do also have a two year old and hoping <br/>
that she lives and unschooled life.  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Faith</div>
