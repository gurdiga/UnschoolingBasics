 </span></blockquote>Um, the purpose of that webpage was to alert people that the email  <br/>
going around is a hoax. The email turns up every August.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something from Space Weather:<br/>
<br/>
Space Weather News for August 4, 2007<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://spaceweather.com">http://spaceweather.com</a><br/>
<br/>
BEWARE THE MARS HOAX: It&#39;s August, which means it&#39;s time for the  <br/>
annual Mars Hoax. An email is going around claiming that Mars will  <br/>
approach Earth on August 27th; the encounter will be so close, the  <br/>
email states, that Mars will rival the full Moon in size and  <br/>
brightness. (Imagine the tides!) Don&#39;t believe it. The Mars Hoax  <br/>
email first appeared in 2003. On August 27th of that year, Mars  <br/>
really did come historically close to Earth. But the email&#39;s claim  <br/>
that Mars would rival the Moon was grossly exaggerated. Every August  <br/>
since 2003, the email has staged a revival.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that is true: Mars is having a close encounter with  <br/>
the Pleiades star cluster, easily seen in the eastern sky before  <br/>
sunrise. Especially good mornings to look are August 6th and 7th when  <br/>
the crescent Moon joins the planet and the cluster to form a pretty  <br/>
celestial triangle. Set your alarm!<br/>
<br/>
MANMADE NOCTILUCENT CLOUDS:  This morning in Florida, NASA&#39;s Phoenix  <br/>
Mars lander blasted off from Cape Canaveral aboard a Delta II  <br/>
rocket.  The rocket&#39;s exhaust created a beautiful display of  <br/>
luminous, night-shining clouds. See the photos at http:// <br/>
spaceweather.com.<br/>

Apparently this was spam. Anyone that has been at this list for more<br/>
than a day wouldn&#39;t post something like the above! I should have<br/>
known. Sorry for letting that get through folks.<br/>
