Yeah, and she called me  Rue...:)<br/>
which I totally don&#39;t mind, since Rue is much sweeter than I  am.<br/>

You might think so, but as you get to know her, you see she has an evil  <br/>
streak.<br/>

Rue being with Jon is not quite as strange as you might think....<br/>

Y&#39;know, I always wondered just how the heck a sweetie like Rue ended <br/>
up with a devil like Jon (a fun devil, btw)...now we know the truth. <br/>
Hmmm.....<br/>
Maybe I should resign the &quot;evil twin&quot; label after all. <br/>
