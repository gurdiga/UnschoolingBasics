<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913920334">&lt;&lt;&lt;Can you/she recommend any good, free online resources for foreign<br/>
languages in general?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The library system in a nearby county (King County in Seattle) has <br/>
access to Rosetta Stone online.  Our local library has a reciprocal <br/>
agreement with their library, so my mom was able to get a library card <br/>
and now she studies French and Spanish using Rosetta Stone (expensive!) <br/>
for FREE.  Maybe your local, or regional, library has access?<br/>
