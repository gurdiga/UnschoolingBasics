<div id="ygrps-yiv-492854825">Hi folks. My name is Lisa. I live in NJ currently with my 8 yo ds and my dh<br/>
of 11 years when he isn&#39;t deployed as he is now. We are an unschooling AF<br/>
family. Other than a short stint in a prestigious, allegedly &quot;child led<br/>
Waldorf/Montessori inspired&quot; kindergarten program, ds has been homeschooled<br/>
and more recently unschooled. Letting go of needing his education to go in a<br/>
particular way has been a challenge that pops up often for me and I do the<br/>
best I can with it. :-) I have struggles with some health issues that are<br/>
thankfully improving and making it easier for us to get out and explore more<br/>
often! Yay! We seem to be a minority among minorities in the military life<br/>
since we do not avoid school for religious reason, nor do we raise our son<br/>
as if he is our own personal military troop. I know there are others around<br/>
like myself, finding them and making connections seems to be a challenge. We<br/>
lived in MS for the greater part of 10 years, with some times in Maine<br/>
(where I am from originally) when dh would deploy. I was not happy in MS (no<br/>
offense to anyone who lives there, I just couldn&#39;t handle the summer weather<br/>
or fire ants.) and was happy to find out we were moving to NJ, even though<br/>
growing up I thought NJ was all Newark or Cherry Hill. I love that there is<br/>
a LOT of farmland and forested areas around here. I left Biloxi, MS six<br/>
hours before Katrina hit and am so grateful we were already moving out as<br/>
the house we rented no longer exists. I have friends down there, who like so<br/>
many others, still have not recovered! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am a member of the Weston A. Price foundation and make most of our food<br/>
from scratch, I go to Lancaster county, PA to buy all our milk, butter,<br/>
eggs, meat, beans, grains etc.I love being able to buy clean, raw milk from<br/>
the wonderful farmers I have met. My dh isn&#39;t totally on board with<br/>
unschooling, but mainly just lets things progress on their own. Since he was<br/>
deployed for 7 months last year and will be deployed for 10 months this<br/>
year, that isn&#39;t an issue for the most part. (Please know I would rather<br/>
have him home though.) I grew up in Maine (greater Portland area) and dh<br/>
grew up mainly in upstate NY (near Plattsburgh) and we both love going home<br/>
to both places as often as possible. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just joined the other day so forgive me if I am jumping in out of context<br/>
with what I have been reading so far.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For the folks struggling with custody issues, my heart goes out to you. I<br/>
have a SIL going through a similar situation, my older sister also struggled<br/>
through something like that. They don&#39;t have the schooling issue to contend<br/>
with, but definitely have the abuse issues to be concerned with. I am so<br/>
sorry you are have to deal with this. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Food intolerances. if anyone is interested I have a friend who is a<br/>
certified nutritionist. If you contact me off list I can get you her contact<br/>
information. She also is a Weston A. Price foundation member. If you want an<br/>
idea of their deal, their site is www.westonaprice.org<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.westonaprice.org/">http://www.westonaprice.org/</a>&gt; . I myself am getting ready to do some<br/>
intolerance testing as well. I am happy to share some of what I have learned<br/>
(granted it doesn&#39;t feel like much to me so far but I am seeing small<br/>
improvements as I keep with it!). I am not a doctor and I am not<br/>
recommending anyone do anything in particular, I am just sharing what I have<br/>
learned in case someone else can use the information for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Corn syrup is a biggie as well as dyes. Also msg, and preservatives<br/>
(hydrolyzed soy protein, autolyzed wheat protein, BHT, etc.) MSG is in SO<br/>
many things. It is scary. I react strongly to any MSG/glutamate other than<br/>
what is naturally present in foods. Grains are trouble for me when they are<br/>
not soaked. Soy is a major problem for me. I only consume raw dairy<br/>
products. Pasteurized/homogenized dairy is an issue for me. One thing I have<br/>
found about elimination diets is that it is really hard to know where to<br/>
begin. I was put on a hypoallergenic diet by an allergist and it didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to create any improvements. Why? The main component is rice. Guess what, I<br/>
am really sensitive to rice. It causes reactions on the tongue, ringing in<br/>
the ears, itchy throat and other weird places (inner ears etc.) and is<br/>
supposed to be one of the least likely allergens. So it didn&#39;t really help<br/>
me out. I have a friend who has trouble with lettuce of all things. Another<br/>
thing people don&#39;t think of being a potential problem. I also seem to react<br/>
to other stuff and it is hard to get everything out of the system as once<br/>
since I do need to eat something.anyway, just wanted to put that in there in<br/>
case nothing obvious comes out for someone trying an elimination diet. If I<br/>
get one allergen out of my diet while continuing to consume something else<br/>
that is a problem, I may not get a clear cut reaction when I reintroduce the<br/>
first food. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I try to remember to utilize EFT when I am dealing with life issues, even<br/>
food issues. I was talking with my friend who is a nutritionist and a while<br/>
ago read something about some research that can suggest that some allergies<br/>
are the result of some type of emotional trauma that got connected with food<br/>
somehow. The easiest example I can think of is people who drink to excess<br/>
with a particular type of alcohol then can never be around it without<br/>
feeling sick again. For my friend there was a lot of stress in their family<br/>
life around dinner time, which more often than not had rice as a component.<br/>
She too is sensitive to rice. So she has been trying to resolve some of the<br/>
emotional issues as well as the food intolerance issues (rotation diet). EFT<br/>
is a type of energy healing utilizing tapping on certain pressure points.<br/>
www.emofree.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emofree.com/">http://www.emofree.com/</a>&gt;  explains it better than I can. I<br/>
am still a newbie at that but have had some success when I remember to use<br/>
it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ok, sorry to be so long winded right off the bat. I am happy to join your<br/>
group and I hope to be a positive contribution! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215575373">Hi Lisa, and welcome. My dh is also in the AF, and we live in <br/>
Washington (state).  He will soon be deployed again as well.  I know <br/>
what you mean about being a minority - we have yet to find any other <br/>
like-minded families on the base here or on any base for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy this group.<br/>

Hi Linda, I have actually read in some places that environmental allergies<br/>
are often the external symptoms of food intolerance triggers. I haven&#39;t been<br/>
actively reading on it, but thought I might just pass that on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654282790">Hi Christy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dh is actually out your way then, they are doing some training in your<br/>
state before they head to the big sand box. :-) He said it has rained a lot.<br/>
I guess that is the norm for WA though. I imagine one of the reasons it is<br/>
hard to find like minded families in the AF (I know they exist!) is that if<br/>
they are anything like me, they tend to mainly stay under the radar. We just<br/>
go about our own business, participate in military life when we choose to<br/>
but mainly steer clear of the scrutiny and judgment. We did have one<br/>
commander who homeschooled in MS but they did it for different reasons, and<br/>
had a whole different philosophy about life and parenting in general that we<br/>
didn&#39;t mesh well with. The base commander here homeschools from what I<br/>
understand. Which is great! They have a homeschool gym class at the youth<br/>
center, but the main focus is always on competition rather than healthy<br/>
habits so we went a few times until ds decided he didn&#39;t want to go anymore.<br/>
It is really geared toward older kids anyway. We have a yahoo group for the<br/>
base, but something happened on the list just before I got here and I don&#39;t<br/>
think the list has recovered. It seems to be dominated by people in the<br/>
&quot;school at home, spare the rod spoil the child&quot; mindset. That really isn&#39;t<br/>
my cup of tea so we let that pass by. I still hope another unschooler pops<br/>
up. We had one friend around the corner in housing but they caved to the<br/>
peer pressure to go to school and now the kids are in public school. :-( I<br/>
have had more luck with finding folks in the local area. We VERY recently<br/>
just made friends with a family in the local town and it is GREAT! They know<br/>
lots of other unschoolers too which is hopeful for me! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope you find some great connections too! Are you at McChord? I am<br/>
trying to remember which AFB is in WA. My dh is actually at another services<br/>
base. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope you have a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa<br/>
