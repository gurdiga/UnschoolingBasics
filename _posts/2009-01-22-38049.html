<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089036222">I was once where you are now. :-)<br/>
 <br/>
An unschooler basically believes that enough &quot;education&quot; is as much as<br/>
your child needs and wants HIMSELF rather than what some school says is<br/>
needed at that grade level or age.  It&#39;s hard at first to turn off the<br/>
schooled mind switch but you and your son will benefit greatly by doing<br/>
so!!!  <br/>
 <br/>
Try letting go of the reading expectations.  Most children, if left to<br/>
learn to read in their own time (with support from you and others, of<br/>
course, if needed), would do so later.  A child that learns to read when<br/>
HE is ready, whether that be at 4, 6, 8, or even 12 will WANT to read<br/>
and not because someone told him to.  He will go after it with an inner<br/>
drive rather than to please a teacher or mom or dad.  That&#39;s VERY<br/>
different than the child who was made to read by a certain age in school<br/>
or at home in a school-at-home type of homeschool.  No one can tell the<br/>
difference at adulthood between someone who learned to read at 4 and<br/>
someone who learned to read at 12. <br/>
 <br/>
Let go!  See how much joy he gets when left to his own devices for a<br/>
while!  Each of you follow your interests, whatever they may be.  Forget<br/>
that anyone ever said there is such a thing as school.  Rather, there is<br/>
life to explore!  Watch a movie together, bake, visit friends, go to the<br/>
museum, take a class, join a homeschool playgroup, go bowling, go ice<br/>
skating, build things, read books together, magazines, play games,<br/>
etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539423829">Part of the issue here is of course, which state you live in and whether they require you to &quot;log&quot; your hours or not.  I, fortunately, live in a state that does not (Ohio) and a VERY lenient school district that only requires we do 800 hours of &quot;school&quot; in a year.  I tell people that with unschooling 24 hours a day, we have that covered in 1/2 the time of everyone else.  Learning occurs in our family ALL the time.<br/>
 <br/>
My children are not in Special Ed and my 8 yo and 5 yo could not sit at a desk for hours at a time, nor would I want them to.  That is such passive learning.  Go take a walk and talk about the trees and the animals that live in the forest.  If he&#39;s interested, talk about what they eat, if they are nocturnal, how they are born (live or eggs), etc, etc.  Take him to a museum and learn about airplanes, Lewis and Clark, dinosaurs, whatever his interests are.  If he has an interest in 4-H or Cub Scouts or a church program, let that count towards your &quot;required&quot; hours.  Bake with him in the afternoon and talk about measuring things.  Let him write out the recipe card or dictate to you what he thinks would make a great cake and write that recipe down on a card for him.  <br/>
 <br/>
Make it fun and exciting and I bet your &quot;homeschooling&quot; friends will be somewhat jealous because they will see how much fun you all are having while learning as much as they are, only different stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
Someone just recently posted a sample of ways to log the learning they do on a daily basis.  Not sure when or who, but it was just in the past few days.  If you need that for your state, take a look at that sample and run with it.  Before I officially started unschooling I tried to keep records of what we were doing on a daily basis just for my own interest and it was more cumbersome than it was worth.  Now, I see everything we do and don&#39;t have to log it.<br/>
 <br/>
As for knowing how to spell correctly, Charlotte Mason says that stuff doesn&#39;t even need to be introduced until about 4th grade.  I realize with unschooling, we don&#39;t push any grade/age/level, etc however, I point this out because I think our friends and the school system put way too much emphasis on the reading, writing, arithmetic.  I once read that if you just read, read, read to your child they will see the words and start to pick them up.  My 8 yo asked for a spelling program, so I bought All About Spelling, but he hasn&#39;t been interested since I got it in the mail.  When he is ready, we will look at it and see if it can give him some clues as to spelling, but right now all I care about it letting him get used to words (John Holt&#39;s idea - How Children Learn).<br/>
 <br/>
As for government, geography, etc. - Take him to meet the mayor or other government official.  PS children don&#39;t get that opportunity and they certainly don&#39;t get it in an individualized way.  Make something like that happen - it is up to you.  My son played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego for three straight days (I helped) and he LOVES learning about the world now.  He can tell you more countries than most kids his age.  Talk to him about where your ancestors came from and if he shows interest, delve into that country/area more.  If not, let it be and try again some other time to see if he has a renewed interest.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son has done all of 1/2 workbook for Math and that was only because he wanted to.  He can add in his head and understands the concept of subtraction.  We do not memorize math facts.  We go to Wal-mart and heely through the store and estimate how many feet it is from one side to the other.  We comparison shop the name brands to the generics and we figure out if we are within budget.  This is real life stuff.  Not workbooks that have no relativity.<br/>
 <br/>
You will find that they learn a whole lot more when you no longer have an agenda.  I still struggle with some things - my son can&#39;t write much, but I know that will come, so I have let it go.  Today he wrote two pages of a recipe that he copied from a DVD he was watching.  I smiled inside!!!  Hope any of this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185791937">I remember spelling tests with fear! I learned more about spelling as an adult with spell check than as a kid with a dictionary! I hated hearing &quot;look it up&quot; when I&#39;d ask how to spell something. How can you look it up if you don&#39;t know how to spell it? I do algebra because I like it but honestly most adults never use it. I have even spoken to adults who can&#39;t balance a checkbook but were &quot;educated&quot;. Unschooling is great because it accepts that we all have different strengths and interests. I&#39;m a KOOK (Keeper Of Odd Knowledge) and read Shakespeare at 11 by choice but freaked out because my car was running hot (it was totally dry!) and if you ask me knowing about cars is much more useful than knowing cursive, algebra, spelling and that Istanbul was Constantinople... <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Specifics of what the law says and how it can be interpreted are more  <br/>
for state and local lists. But in general, unschooling happens in  <br/>
every state. There isn&#39;t any state that says you need to do 4 hours  <br/>
of *seat* work. People who are afraid (whether it be of the laws or  <br/>
of providing the education they think their child needs) will  <br/>
interpret the laws strictly so they can do it &quot;right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In MA we need to provide an equivalent number of hours. A nervous  <br/>
person might interpret that as 6 hours of school work. But it just  <br/>
means we need to spend those hours learning. And anything they&#39;re  <br/>
involved with is learning. A movie is learning. A video game is  <br/>
(profound!) learning. Reading. Drawing. Talking. Shopping. It&#39;s *all*  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you insure your child can<br/>
&gt; SPELL correctly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By trusting that spelling well has it&#39;s own intrinsic value. When  <br/>
they are old enough to want to communicate their ideas, they will  <br/>
have tried to read enough of others&#39; creative spelling, will have  <br/>
built up what they think of others who spell well and don&#39;t spell  <br/>
well, that they&#39;ll want to.<br/>
<br/>
The best tool is an automatic spellchecker so they can see misspelled  <br/>
words (like it just told me that mispelled was wrong ;-) and can  <br/>
choose to correct them *or not* depending on whether *they* feel it&#39;s  <br/>
worth it for the context they&#39;re writing in.<br/>
<br/>
At 8 I&#39;d be hugely surprised if he&#39;s not spelling a lot of words  <br/>
creatively. I don&#39;t think my daughter (now 17 and quite proficient at  <br/>
spelling) started writing enough and caring enough until she was 14  <br/>
or so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; knows govt and geography if you do not do much in a<br/>
&gt; book?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because what&#39;s found in a book is an artificial summary with the life  <br/>
sucked out of it. That&#39;s not how humans are hardwired to learn. We  <br/>
learn by doing and using and thinking about what we take in. While  <br/>
textbooks give us the illusion that all the important knowledge is  <br/>
there, how much is taken in? If we don&#39;t want the information, if the  <br/>
information isn&#39;t interesting, passing it in front of the student  <br/>
gives the teacher the justification to say &quot;I did my part&quot; and blame  <br/>
the student if it doesn&#39;t stick.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re vaguely familiar with the program Are You Smarter Than a  <br/>
5th Grader? it takes on new meaning if you realize that everyone  <br/>
older than 5th grade is a *former* 5th grader. If they *aren&#39;t*  <br/>
smarter than they used to be, then there&#39;s something wrong. It means  <br/>
the 5th grade information may be present in 5th grade but it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stick. And it means their definition of smart isn&#39;t very  useful. A  <br/>
better title might be &quot;How Much of the Information They Tried to Pack  <br/>
into You in the 5th Grade Actually Stuck?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what do you do instead? Live a rich life. A movie that takes place  <br/>
in Australia is going to mean a lot more, give him a lot more than an  <br/>
informational book on Australia. It&#39;s not going to feel or look like  <br/>
school learning! *After* the movie, he *might* find the book  <br/>
interesting and suck *some* information -- the parts that build on  <br/>
what fascinated him or new stuff that catches his interest -- from  <br/>
it. But even better Google the parts that captivated him and see if  <br/>
there&#39;s more interesting things. (Or *you* Google them and pass it  <br/>
on.) Keep a wall map up. Get a globe. Show him where the places are.  <br/>
If he&#39;s interested, show him more. Use him as a barometer of how much  <br/>
he wants. Once his brain is wandering off to the next thing, he&#39;s  <br/>
stopped learning and you&#39;re wasting time for both of you and  <br/>
potentially damaging his interest.<br/>
<br/>
Show him things because you think they&#39;re interesting -- as you might  <br/>
to a friend -- not because you think it&#39;s important to get the  <br/>
information into him. It&#39;s not going to go in a stick until he has a  <br/>
need for it. And the need comes from living a rich life. Do things  <br/>
that interest him, run things by him you think will interest him  <br/>
(*not* because you think they&#39;ll be good for him) and he&#39;ll pull more  <br/>
about them inside because he&#39;ll want to know more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I take my son to reading tutoring at a local College and speech<br/>
&gt; therapy there also.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many unschooled kids read between 6 and 8. Lots -- and I do mean lots  <br/>
-- of average unschooled kids are not reading by 8. 10 is not  <br/>
unusual. 12 is not unusual. You&#39;re asking him to do more than the  <br/>
average unschooled kids are doing.<br/>

While many educators and professionals will be quick to tell you that  <br/>
a child needs reading intervention, they *don&#39;t* know that is true.  <br/>
They have *never* encountered a child who has no agenda to meet, who  <br/>
is allowed to read when they&#39;re developmentally able and want to.  <br/>
They have *zero* experience. (That can&#39;t be emphasized enough! They  <br/>
*aren&#39;t* experts in how kids naturally read.) What they do know is  <br/>
that in the artificial world of school where educators need kids to  <br/>
read independently by 4th grade, that an 8 yo who is not reading &quot;up  <br/>
to speed&quot; is going to have problems. The problems aren&#39;t natural.  <br/>
They&#39;re created by school.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of kids who weren&#39;t reading by &quot;4th grade&quot; who, by the  <br/>
time they leave home, are reading in a way that&#39;s indistinguishable  <br/>
from unschooled kids who read at 6. When reading kicks in, kids are  <br/>
fairly quickly reading at age level. No lessons. No required reading.  <br/>
All it takes is reading to them when they want, answering questions,  <br/>
having things they want to read around them, living in a print rich  <br/>
environment.<br/>

It is hard to let go of the old model. If you&#39;ve only known  <br/>
&quot;swimming&quot; by holding onto the side and touching bottom, then letting  <br/>
go in the deep water will seem like an impossibility. The only skills  <br/>
you have are hold on and touch bottom which are useless away from the  <br/>
sides and the bottom! Unschooling is letting go of the sides and  <br/>
bottom. It takes a while to figure out what to put in place of those  <br/>
two. And for a while nothing you do feels as right or comforting. It  <br/>
feels like you&#39;re about to drown! But once you catch on to what we do  <br/>
instead of instruction and workbooks, then you&#39;ll understand. :-) It  <br/>
will be and feel more natural -- and more interesting! -- than  <br/>
holding onto the sides and standing in the water. But like swimming,  <br/>
it&#39;s something that is best understood by seeing it done successfully  <br/>
and -- even more importantly -- by doing it yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692989272">There is a cartoon (forget the name) where the main character is a little boy with a book, &quot;The Great Big Book of Everything&quot;. I started one for my son once (when he couldn&#39;t navigate the web well) and when he asked something, like &quot;where do salamanders live?&quot;, I&#39;d find it (or we would together) and print it and put it in the binder. The cool thing is it was fun and could serve to show the state and negative friends and family what is being learned by choice! <br/>

&gt; bla bla bla..<br/>
<br/>
Specifics of what the law says and how it can be interpreted are more  <br/>
for state and local lists. But in general, unschooling happens in  <br/>
every state. There isn&#39;t any state that says you need to do 4 hours  <br/>
of *seat* work. People who are afraid (whether it be of the laws or  <br/>
of providing the education they think their child needs) will  <br/>
interpret the laws strictly so they can do it &quot;right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In MA we need to provide an equivalent number of hours. A nervous  <br/>
person might interpret that as 6 hours of school work. But it just  <br/>
means we need to spend those hours learning. And anything they&#39;re  <br/>
involved with is learning. A movie is learning. A video game is  <br/>
(profound!) learning. Reading. Drawing. Talking. Shopping. It&#39;s *all*  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How do you insure your child can<br/>
&gt; SPELL correctly<br/>
<br/>
By trusting that spelling well has it&#39;s own intrinsic value. When  <br/>
they are old enough to want to communicate their ideas, they will  <br/>
have tried to read enough of others&#39; creative spelling, will have  <br/>
built up what they think of others who spell well and don&#39;t spell  <br/>
well, that they&#39;ll want to.<br/>
<br/>
The best tool is an automatic spellchecker so they can see misspelled  <br/>
words (like it just told me that mispelled was wrong ;-) and can  <br/>
choose to correct them *or not* depending on whether *they* feel it&#39;s  <br/>
worth it for the context they&#39;re writing in.<br/>
<br/>
At 8 I&#39;d be hugely surprised if he&#39;s not spelling a lot of words  <br/>
creatively. I don&#39;t think my daughter (now 17 and quite proficient at  <br/>
spelling) started writing enough and caring enough until she was 14  <br/>
or so.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; knows govt and geography if you do not do much in a<br/>
&gt; book?<br/>
<br/>
Because what&#39;s found in a book is an artificial summary with the life  <br/>
sucked out of it. That&#39;s not how humans are hardwired to learn. We  <br/>
learn by doing and using and thinking about what we take in. While  <br/>
textbooks give us the illusion that all the important knowledge is  <br/>
there, how much is taken in? If we don&#39;t want the information, if the  <br/>
information isn&#39;t interesting, passing it in front of the student  <br/>
gives the teacher the justification to say &quot;I did my part&quot; and blame  <br/>
the student if it doesn&#39;t stick.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re vaguely familiar with the program Are You Smarter Than a  <br/>
5th Grader? it takes on new meaning if you realize that everyone  <br/>
older than 5th grade is a *former* 5th grader. If they *aren&#39;t*  <br/>
smarter than they used to be, then there&#39;s something wrong. It means  <br/>
the 5th grade information may be present in 5th grade but it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stick. And it means their definition of smart isn&#39;t very  useful. A  <br/>
better title might be &quot;How Much of the Information They Tried to Pack  <br/>
into You in the 5th Grade Actually Stuck?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what do you do instead? Live a rich life. A movie that takes place  <br/>
in Australia is going to mean a lot more, give him a lot more than an  <br/>
informational book on Australia. It&#39;s not going to feel or look like  <br/>
school learning! *After* the movie, he *might* find the book  <br/>
interesting and suck *some* information -- the parts that build on  <br/>
what fascinated him or new stuff that catches his interest -- from  <br/>
it. But even better Google the parts that captivated him and see if  <br/>
there&#39;s more interesting things. (Or *you* Google them and pass it  <br/>
on.) Keep a wall map up. Get a globe. Show him where the places are.  <br/>
If he&#39;s interested, show him more. Use him as a barometer of how much  <br/>
he wants. Once his brain is wandering off to the next thing, he&#39;s  <br/>
stopped learning and you&#39;re wasting time for both of you and  <br/>
potentially damaging his interest.<br/>
<br/>
Show him things because you think they&#39;re interesting -- as you might  <br/>
to a friend -- not because you think it&#39;s important to get the  <br/>
information into him. It&#39;s not going to go in a stick until he has a  <br/>
need for it. And the need comes from living a rich life. Do things  <br/>
that interest him, run things by him you think will interest him  <br/>
(*not* because you think they&#39;ll be good for him) and he&#39;ll pull more  <br/>
about them inside because he&#39;ll want to know more.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I take my son to reading tutoring at a local College and speech<br/>
&gt; therapy there also.<br/>
<br/>
Many unschooled kids read between 6 and 8. Lots -- and I do mean lots  <br/>
-- of average unschooled kids are not reading by 8. 10 is not  <br/>
unusual. 12 is not unusual. You&#39;re asking him to do more than the  <br/>
average unschooled kids are doing.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t stress HOW important this is---and not just for children!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For any of you contemplating going to one of dozens of unschooling conferences or gatherings across the country and Canada this year, there will be plenty of amazing speakers there. Several are on this and other lists. You will be impressed by them and their children. You&#39;ll have a great time at funshops, learning new fun things to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the most PROFOUND (I like that, Joyce!) learning about unschooling will be in the &quot;hanging out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No joke!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hour you spend in a hallway with another parent while your toddler chases another toddler----or in the dining room having breakfast with another family----or watching the crowd explode into applause at one-ball juggling by a five year old----or just watching a &quot;seasoned&quot; unschooling family interact in the elevator---THOSE will be the memories you&#39;ll take home. That &quot;hanging out&quot; will be what makes such a difference in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Never underestimate the value of &quot;hanging out.&quot; We learn a lot by observing and thinking and day-dreaming and chatting---just &quot;hanging out.&quot;<br/>

Well he is smarter than any 8 yr old I have ever met in<br/>
many ways. He is however not able to sit in a desk all day long and<br/>
follow orders. So he is home with me. <br/>

My question to those in this group. How do you insure your child can<br/>
SPELL correctly, knows govt and geography if you do not do much in a<br/>
book?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-===-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried that my children won&#39;t be able to spell correctly. When they need to know how to spell a word, they ask me. I tell them how to spell it. Sometimes, they use spell-check. Duncan, 12, seems to be making all sorts of spelling connections lately. He&#39;s turned all his letters around the right way just recently too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Government? My lord---these last two years have been government RICH! We&#39;ve had more conversations about elections and rights and branches of government---I mean....how could you AVOID it??? No books. Just TV and google and discussions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Geography? We GO. My 21 year old (today!!!&lt;g&gt;) was born in Germany, visited there <br/>
by himself again at 12, has lived in the midwest and south, visits the NE a LOT, and the NW when he can. We&#39;ve all been to NM and AZ (Grand Canyon). He&#39;s been---withOUT us to Australia, Scotland & England, the Yukon, and Mexico. He&#39;s heading to CA this August to backpack. None of us has been to Ohio...yet. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;re leaving next Sunday for a week there. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, here we come! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Bruce, was the first child of divorce I knew (1970). His father was a geographer. Every summer, Bruce&#39;s dad took Bruce and his little brother on his trips with him. Bruce new all the state capitals by the time he was 12 because he had BEEN to each one! By 14, he had been to half the African ones, and all the European ones. It wasn&#39;t that he could &quot;recite&quot; the capitals---although he *could*---it was that he had BEEN there: he&#39;d smelled, touched, tasted them. He could tell you stories of the people he&#39;d met, the strange things he&#39;d eaten, the weird (to us) architecture and clothing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t learn about the world in a book. I believe in travel. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I take my son to reading tutoring at a local College and speech<br/>
therapy there also. So 4 days he has an hour of 1 on 1 instruction and<br/>
he loves that. I also put him in a Homeschool Co Op on Weds 9-12 where<br/>
he takes spanish, science and art classes. I just want to know if I am<br/>
doing enough to insure he is actually learning and not just hanging<br/>
out all the tim<br/>
e. Maybe it is just me? I just sort of feel he needs<br/>
spelling and math workbooks or something. It is HARD to get him to do<br/>
anything in a workbook believe me, but am I wrong to feel he is not<br/>
getting enough education? <br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me your definitions of &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;education&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause what I&#39;m reading about above is a lot of *teaching*---not necessarily *learning*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

What do *you* do with him?<br/>

What is he passionate about? What does he love to do? What moooves him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192444484">spelling strategies<br/>
<br/>
one strategy that works for us is to have the child close their eyes and try to remember what the word looked like when they read it in a book. It takes a little while for them to fully incorporate this in their daily spelling (at least for us) but once my kids started tapping into this idea, they quickly began to pick up their spelling. In the meantime, I always told them how to spell it...then reminded them to look at the word and remember what it looks like.  <br/>

words. By the time she was 9 she just put regular spacing between words but<br/>
still no punctuation and still creative spelling though much more easily<br/>
read. Around 10 she started to write with passion. She started her first<br/>
novel at 10, she is 12 and still writing various novels. They are getting<br/>
longer and longer. She began rudimentary punctuation and found the spell<br/>
checker helpful. She rarely asks me to spell for her anymore (she&#39;s 12). Her<br/>
writing is not only intelligible but interesting to read. It has been a<br/>
thrill as a parent to watch this amazing progression. To be there for her to<br/>
help her spell words and show her how to make her writing make sense to<br/>
other people. One day she wanted an editor so she asked her papa. They<br/>
researched all the special code you write on manuscripts and he corrected<br/>
her writing (at her behest). They talked about grammar and punctuation and<br/>
coherency. They talked for days on and off. She learned years worth of<br/>
school &quot;language arts&quot; in a few conversations over a couple days when *she*<br/>
was ready for it. She sucked the information right up.<br/>
<br/>
As for geography, her and two friends (11 and 12) are planning their first<br/>
cross country road trip for when they can drive. they are frequently on the<br/>
internet together planning their journey. They have compiled maps of the US<br/>
and charted and re-charted their trip. They have researched each stated<br/>
individually to discover what might be interesting in each state and where<br/>
it is in relation to the other areas of interest. They are passionate about<br/>
it. It is what they talk about. Also my daughter has been to every state<br/>
east of the Mississippi river (and to the Mississippi river). She has<br/>
explore mountains and caves and rivers and oceans.<br/>
<br/>
She understands now from living in a schooled world that many people break<br/>
life up into school subjects but that doesn&#39;t really affect her. She just<br/>
lives her life. She isn&#39;t hung up about &quot;learning&quot; grammar she just wanted<br/>
to have the best writing possible. She isn&#39;t hung up about learning about<br/>
the US, she just wants to travel and see things. They have begun discussing<br/>
European and African travel as well.. Because she wants to do this things<br/>
and they anre important to *her* she find the information she learnes what<br/>
she needs to know to create a fullfilling life for herself.<br/>

&gt;&gt; SPELL correctly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t insure it.<br/>
<br/>
I have three grown kids - two of them spelled well from the beginning,  <br/>
picked it up right along with reading and writing. The third had in  <br/>
interesting, but not terribly uncommon, problem with spelling. She  <br/>
could read well and read a lot, but she couldn&#39;t spell even simple  <br/>
words. She would, for example, write &quot;TEH&quot; or &quot;HTE&quot; or &quot;EHT&quot; or &quot;THE&quot;  <br/>
all equally often for the word &quot;THE.&quot; In one sentence she might write  <br/>
it two different ways. Sometimes she would add letters. So she might  <br/>
write &quot;TNEH&quot; for &quot;THE.&quot; What she wrote was very often completely  <br/>
unreadable - even she couldn&#39;t read what she&#39;d written. She was  <br/>
frustrated by it - she was a voracious reader and both of her older  <br/>
sisters were writers and she wanted to write, too. I read a little  <br/>
book called something like &quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell&quot; - it gave ideas for  <br/>
coping with not being good at spelling. As I gave her various ideas to  <br/>
deal with it, we noticed that she could recognize the correctly  <br/>
spelled word in a list, even though she couldn&#39;t come up with it on  <br/>
her own. So if I gave her a list: &quot;TEH&quot; &quot;HTE&quot; &quot;THE&quot; - she could  <br/>
quickly say which one was correct. She knew it when she saw it  <br/>
written. Reading up on it, I came to realize that she had a little  <br/>
missing step in her brain processing - she didn&#39;t &quot;visualize&quot; the word  <br/>
on the blackboard of her brain before writing it down. She just  <br/>
remembered which letters were in the word. This was especially  <br/>
interesting since she had learned to read in a way that was very  <br/>
different than my other kids - she&#39;d memorized lots and lots of words,  <br/>
recognized the entire word, did not sound out words at all for a very  <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t anything much she could do about it. This was her brain&#39;s  <br/>
way of working. She used various coping strategies - lots of asking  <br/>
someone &quot;How do you spell....&quot; and lots of times she&#39;d write a word in  <br/>
as many ways as she could think of, then look at her own list and  <br/>
discover she&#39;d included the correct one in the list. But, it was sort  <br/>
of slow and annoying and it held her back from writing, which she  <br/>
really wanted to do. She was frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Then she was a young teenager and started IMing with friends online a  <br/>
lot. I know there was a period of a little frustration when her  <br/>
friends couldn&#39;t read what she wrote. They&#39;d respond, &quot;Huh?&quot; and she&#39;d  <br/>
rewrite. But she was lucky enough to have a lot of online unschooled/ <br/>
homeschooled very tolerant friends. Nobody made fun of her, nobody  <br/>
even commented on her poor spelling. They didn&#39;t think less of her. It  <br/>
was just &quot;her.&quot; And, lo and behold, over a few years her spelling  <br/>
improved. That was, to be honest, a bit unexpected - I&#39;d come to  <br/>
believe she had a &quot;spelling disability&quot; that wasn&#39;t going to go away.  <br/>
I hadn&#39;t told her that - we&#39;d just treated it like anything else -  <br/>
something that she hadn&#39;t developed into yet. I commiserated with her  <br/>
in her frustration and helped her cope, but &quot;I&quot; secretly had thought  <br/>
she probably wouldn&#39;t ever get it.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, was I wrong. She did get it, in her own way and in her own time.  <br/>
By 16 years old she was doing pretty well at spelling. She&#39;ll be 18  <br/>
next week and she&#39;s a fantastic speller - no problems at all even with  <br/>
quite complicated words.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s written several novels and screenplays (NaNoWriMo and  <br/>
ScriptFrenzy) and she&#39;s in college and writes papers in and out of  <br/>
class. No problem.<br/>
<br/>
Makes me wonder about those smart adults whose spelling is poor. I&#39;ve  <br/>
known a number of them. I wonder if they would have become better at  <br/>
spelling if they&#39;d been accepted they way they were and supported in  <br/>
finding ways to handle the way they actually spelled, rather than  <br/>
having been drilled and remediated and graded down for years.<br/>

I worry that when parents are trying to come up with &quot;strategies&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t insure much of anything in life. It&#39;s largely a crapshoot.<br/>
But you can work the odds in your favor. Drilling or using strategies<br/>
to teach someone will very often turn that person off to the very<br/>
thing you&#39;re hoping they&#39;ll learn.<br/>
<br/>
The bigger question is &quot;How do you insure your child is a passionate<br/>
learner?&quot; don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
I see the big picture. Spelling is a paltry skill, nothing amazing.<br/>
Those that can&#39;t spell can use spell-check for crying out loud! What<br/>
are the greater things in life?<br/>
Compassion, passion, curiosity, joy perhaps? If so, then how do we<br/>
insure the greatest chance for success with those skills? Not by<br/>
worrying about spelling.<br/>

Yeah, and if spelling was so all-important,then people who know<br/>
several languages are at a disadvantage. The designer I&#39;m working with<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids (24, 21, and 17) and my husband and I all watched West Wing  <br/>
for  years - eventually bought the entire series on DVD and have  <br/>
watched and watched and watched and talked and talked and talked about  <br/>
it. The characters in West Wing are like our good friends - Josh,  <br/>
Donna, Toby, Sam, .... all are our buddies! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When this election started up, my kids already knew so much about  <br/>
politics from watching West Wing that they could easily get caught up  <br/>
in the election process. They watched all the debates and analyzed  <br/>
them. Also watched The Daily Show and The Colbert Report and Saturday  <br/>
Night Live and other comedy and talk shows - got all the jokes because  <br/>
they were keeping up with the election coverage. Rosie volunteered to  <br/>
work as a poll worker - went to a long training - learned everything  <br/>
about how the voting is actually carried out and worked from 6 am to 9  <br/>
pm at a polling place on election day. They also got interested in all  <br/>
the propositions. My kids have a lot of gay friends and they were  <br/>
strongly against the California Proposition 8 anti-gay marriage  <br/>
campaign - got involved in that and came to understand the proposition  <br/>
system we have in California and also how the court had made same-sex  <br/>
marriage legal, etc. When Obama began announcing his cabinet  <br/>
appointments, they followed that closely and looked up information on  <br/>
many of them - mostly to make fascinating comparisons to characters on  <br/>
West Wing! &lt;G&gt; Rosie is especially interested in politics and she  <br/>
decided to take a Political Science course at the community college  <br/>
this semester. Just for fun. (But, oh the irony!!! She was IN her  <br/>
political science class when Obama was being inaugurated and they  <br/>
didn&#39;t watch it in class - too much to cover, couldn&#39;t take the time  <br/>
from the scheduled lectures. Aargh.) The way the Obama campaign used  <br/>
the internet really helped inform and draw in young people - the  <br/>
campaign was absolutely masterful at providing just the right amount  <br/>
of information in a format that really worked for the teens and young  <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need to be taught about government and politics, these days  <br/>
especially!<br/>
<br/>
Not all kids are going to be super interested, though - some will pick  <br/>
up the basic idea and be satisfied with that. That&#39;s okay, too. Better  <br/>
that they should be supported and encouraged to pursue their own  <br/>
natural interests than be forced to learn about something that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
interest them much.<br/>
<br/>
About geography - this is not something that is well-suited to  <br/>
learning from books, anyway. In terms of creating a rich and  <br/>
stimulating environment - having maps and a globe around is a really  <br/>
good idea. We&#39;ve always had a globe sitting around the living room and  <br/>
we&#39;ve had various maps taped up to walls and doors - different ones  <br/>
over the years. Also, be a curious person - when you&#39;re watching tv  <br/>
and someone mentions a place, you can wonder aloud, &quot;Where IS that?&quot;  <br/>
and grab the globe (or google if you&#39;re sitting with your laptop as we  <br/>
usually are). Lots of times somebody googles something and scan  <br/>
quickly and maybe toss out a tidbit of some interesting factoid about  <br/>
the place. &quot;Did you know that...?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in today&#39;s small world, geography is easy to &quot;just pick up&quot;  <br/>
naturally, given that parents are interested and interesting (love  <br/>
that expression). Some unschoolers travel a lot - some are homebodies.  <br/>
But even homebodies can be armchair travelers, and television brings  <br/>
the world into our living rooms in an often spectacular way. I mean,  <br/>
anybody watching &quot;Man versus Wild&quot; or &quot;Survivor Man&quot; knows what I mean  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have run a forum for people who are no younger then 13 for over a decade. Most of these people have gone to school and the vast majority have graduated high school. The writing is often horrible. In fact the people who are not English as a first language writers are ALL better spellers and writers then the English as a first language people. Most the younger people can&#39;t even be bothered to type full words like you prefering u instead yet few of them understand the U R N X song........<br/>
<br/>
This tells me that 1. you can get along in the real world just fine without good English skills should you so choose. After all from what I have seen a good 75 to 80% of high school graduates have the same or worse spelling skills as my my oldest when we took her out of the 4th grade. 2. Schools are doing a horrifying job of teaching children spelling. 3. learning English because you want to communicate with other like minded people produces people who have excellent spelling and grammar.  At least from what I have seen. 4. they might be giants sings about everything! I love them they are like a main educational staple in our house. 5. those who love language have the best spelling and writing. 6. most people who graduated highschool hate the english language or just dont care. I know I hated the english language by then. <br/>
<br/>
In fact this list has far better spelling and grammer then most lists I have been on and no one crusifys anyone for it like they do in many other places. So my point is they will learn spelling and  good writing by spelling and writing and reading and caring about what they write. <br/>
There are TONS of writing resources out there now days. I love the between the lions show. All sorts of games that involve writing and reading and games where you find the words or unscramble them or have to figure out the order they are suppose to be in are found in tons of video games. There is also boggle and jr boggle and cross words and word searches and book writing contests and pen pals and lists for the store and notes passed under doors and poetry contests and diaries or journals and blogs and forums and chatting and books and the list goes on and on and on. <br/>
<br/>
Did you know that a % of highschool graduates can&#39;t read? I frankly am compleatly shocked that there are highschool graduates who can&#39;t read I mean they had 18 years of reading and writing shoved down their throats and it did not take.... I mean seriously how do you get to be an adult without being able to  read on at least a minimal level  much less graduate highchool; societies end all be all of edumacation?<br/>

other impressed him in some movie or other. He spent hours <br/>
researching Ireland on the computer. Then he was over it. He has <br/>
friends all across the US, so he has at least as much of a grasp of <br/>
US geography as any other kid his age. Actually, given that we live <br/>
in a small town in TN, probably better than most of the kids in the <br/>
area, whose knowledge of geography mostly stops at the county line.<br/>
<br/>
Mo&#39;s interested in big cats, so that leads her to learning about <br/>
geography - where do jaguars live as opposed to leopards, for <br/>
example? Where do tigers live? She&#39;s also interested in China - today <br/>
we spent an hour looking through a craft store for anything that <br/>
looked &quot;Chinese&quot; to her. She just adores the fact that so many things <br/>
are Made in China! How wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Government is something that comes up in daily life. Why do we need <br/>
liscense plates on cars? Why do we write a note for Ray if he wants <br/>
to go somewhere during &quot;school hours&quot;? Why do I have to wear shoes in <br/>
the store? What are taxes and what happens if you don&#39;t pay them? <br/>
Does jail really exist? What&#39;s it For? Kids ask questions about the <br/>
world - and the actions of government, large and small, are part of <br/>
the world.<br/>

had any kind of &quot;schooling&quot; though. My 7yo thinks of workbooks <br/>
like &quot;coloring and activity books&quot;. My 15yo thinks they are horrible <br/>
things, designed to bore kids into submission. Guess which one went <br/>
to school? ;)<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing in the world that workbooks offer that can&#39;t be <br/>
found elsewhere. If you have a kid who doesn&#39;t take well to &quot;seat <br/>
work&quot; anyway, workbooks are probably the worst way for him to try to <br/>
learn anything. Do you know about the theory of Mulitple <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178504495">Thanks everyone for the great insight into what I should look at as learning etc etc.. I just get drilled by family that he is not learning and maybe I should put him in private school etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 My son seems happy and is interested in boy things and doing things on a regular basis. I worry he is not learning enough when in reality he is a well rounded kid and WAY more intelligent than most 8 yr olds..I even got called into the schools Principal last year for him acting too old for his age, HE WAS 7...The schools form of punishing him was to have him READ to the kindergartners so he can feel older....as punishment..YEAH like that is going to make my son WANT to read when you say it is punishment... My son FLUNKED reading, Math, Language arts in 1&2 grade but they put him in 3rd anyway even though he was the youngest in the class..he was also the largest child in the room..He is a big kid 115 lbs at 8..wears a sz 6.5 shoe and sz 30 X 27 in Levi&#39;s...He looks 10-12 easily. I guess I am doing OK with him afterall. He is constantly amazing me with things he finds on the internet too. He printed the Cotton Bowl Football team info today..Funbrain.com<br/>
 is his favorite site. I just need to observe him more and worry less I would say. LOL<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you all for the encouragement and info too, I needed that! :) Pam<br/>

&gt;  How do you insure your child ... knows govt and geography if you <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
For awhile Ray was fascinated with Ireland - some Irish actor or <br/>
<br/>
other impressed him in some movie or other. He spent hours <br/>
<br/>
researching Ireland on the computer. Then he was over it. He has <br/>
<br/>
friends all across the US, so he has at least as much of a grasp of <br/>
<br/>
US geography as any other kid his age. Actually, given that we live <br/>
<br/>
in a small town in TN, probably better than most of the kids in the <br/>
<br/>
area, whose knowledge of geography mostly stops at the county line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mo&#39;s interested in big cats, so that leads her to learning about <br/>
<br/>
geography - where do jaguars live as opposed to leopards, for <br/>
<br/>
example? Where do tigers live? She&#39;s also interested in China - today <br/>
<br/>
we spent an hour looking through a craft store for anything that <br/>
<br/>
looked &quot;Chinese&quot; to her. She just adores the fact that so many things <br/>
<br/>
are Made in China! How wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Government is something that comes up in daily life. Why do we need <br/>
<br/>
liscense plates on cars? Why do we write a note for Ray if he wants <br/>
<br/>
to go somewhere during &quot;school hours&quot;? Why do I have to wear shoes in <br/>
<br/>
the store? What are taxes and what happens if you don&#39;t pay them? <br/>
<br/>
Does jail really exist? What&#39;s it For? Kids ask questions about the <br/>
<br/>
world - and the actions of government, large and small, are part of <br/>
<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It is HARD to get him to do<br/>
<br/>
&gt; anything in a workbook believe me, but am I wrong to feel he is not<br/>
<br/>
&gt; getting enough education? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some kids actually enjoy workbooks - most of those kids have never <br/>
<br/>
had any kind of &quot;schooling&quot; though. My 7yo thinks of workbooks <br/>
<br/>
like &quot;coloring and activity books&quot;. My 15yo thinks they are horrible <br/>
<br/>
things, designed to bore kids into submission. Guess which one went <br/>
<br/>
to school? ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing in the world that workbooks offer that can&#39;t be <br/>
<br/>
found elsewhere. If you have a kid who doesn&#39;t take well to &quot;seat <br/>
<br/>
work&quot; anyway, workbooks are probably the worst way for him to try to <br/>
<br/>
learn anything. Do you know about the theory of Mulitple <br/>
<br/>
Intelligences? It might help you think about how learning happens <br/>
<br/>
best for your guy:<br/>

them to look at the word and remember what it looks like.  <br/>
********************<br/>
<br/>
It can be really valuable to share tricks for how you remember and <br/>
organize information. From a radical unschooling perspective, its <br/>
important to share this kind of information the same way you&#39;d do it <br/>
with an adult friend, with the understanding that they&#39;ll take it or <br/>
leave it. Different people learn and remember and process <br/>
differently, after all. <br/>
<br/>
This next is going to sound nit-picky, so bear with me a little. <br/>
Unschooling is all about the relationships your foster with your kids:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one strategy that works for us is to have the child close their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>eyes...<br/>
***************<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find it helpful to &quot;have&quot; my kids do things. I&#39;m older, sure, <br/>
and have more experience, but its *my* experience of the way my brain <br/>
and body work and my life has unfolded. However much my kids are like <br/>
me, they aren&#39;t me. They&#39;re going to do and learn and experience <br/>
things their own ways. I put a lot of time and energy into observing <br/>
my kids and trying to understand how they go about doing and learning <br/>
and experiencing, but when all&#39;s said and sifted, I can never be the <br/>
expert on them that they can be. That&#39;s one of my goals as an <br/>
unschooling parent - to help my kids to be their own best experts on <br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
When I offer one of my kids a strategy, its an offer. Its something <br/>
they can try if they want, maybe never, maybe later. Ray, in <br/>
particular, hates to try something new with an audience. He&#39;ll go off <br/>
on his own to try something the first couple times. Years ago, when <br/>
we were homeschooling, I&#39;d coax him to trying whatever (close your <br/>
eyes and imagine, for example) right there in front of me. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
helpful to him. He&#39;d get all wound up in &quot;having&quot; to do it, and that <br/>
was all he&#39;d get out of the experience - that he Had to. He&#39;d Agree <br/>
with me that it was helpful, but then again, he thought that was <br/>
something he &quot;had&quot; to do, too. Learning not to coax helped our <br/>
relationship enormously. As our relationship improved, he started to <br/>
feel comfortable enough to try some of my suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
These days, if Ray wants a suggestion, he&#39;ll ask for it. He and I <br/>
both know that he&#39;s more likely to find what works for Him without <br/>
too much of my help. <br/>

*************************<br/>
<br/>
I used to volunteer with an adult literacy program, so I know it <br/>
well! How it happens hinges on the fact that there are many ways to <br/>
learn things. People who don&#39;t read (and for the most part they do <br/>
read a little at the &quot;sounding out&quot; level, which isn&#39;t terribly <br/>
helpful for most reading) develop all sorts of marvelous strategies <br/>
for learning based on how they Really learn, as opposed to how <br/>
schools teach. But all the while their self esteem is a shambles. <br/>
Helping them see what and how they&#39;ve learned over the years is an <br/>
important part of helping them learn to read using their own, very <br/>
real skills and strategies. <br/>
<br/>
This ties back in to unschooling. Kids who have struggled with school <br/>
in the past have the same damage to their self confidence. They may <br/>
need a lot of reassurance and help seeing where their strengths lie. <br/>
Kids who have been unschooled from an early age, but don&#39;t read until <br/>
they&#39;re older may need a lot of moral support from parents - because <br/>
they can run into the same messages from schooled friends and <br/>
relatives that not-reading means something is wrong with them.<br/>
