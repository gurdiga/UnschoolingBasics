<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573853762">Well, I always have to recommend MAC for the sheer fact that it&#39;s high<br/>
quality for a low price (by comparison to other lines).  They have a<br/>
gel cleanser and oil control lotion that are great. One of the other<br/>
great things about MAC is their environmental and social awareness;<br/>
they encourage recycling by giving a free lipstick for every 6<br/>
containers you bring back in. They also donate 100% of the money from<br/>
all Viva Glam products to the MAC Aids Foundation which goes directly<br/>
to patient care (meals, medicine, education for African kids<br/>
etc...average donations add up to $1 million per month) and they&#39;re<br/>
100% cruelty free. Some companies say cruelty free but they buy<br/>
ingredients from companies that test on animals. MAC ONLY buys<br/>
products from other cruelty free companies. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I also think Clarins and Origins make some great skincare. For<br/>
breakouts, nothing beats that Pro-active stuff! You can get it online<br/>
or by calling them..sometimes they have Kiosks at the mall.<br/>
<br/>
For natural, I prefer Avalon Organics mainly because it&#39;s one of the<br/>
only paraben free lines. Good prices too...get it at your local health<br/>
food store.:)<br/>
