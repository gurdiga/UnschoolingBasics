mom&#39;s twin): when they were attending a parochial school, &quot;someone&quot; <br/>
in an area of the room talked - the teacher didn&#39;t know who, just <br/>
the general region. So, all 4 or 6 people in that area were called <br/>
to the front of the classroom for punishment, including my mom and <br/>
my aunt. They were lined up and told to hold out their hands for the <br/>
ruler. My aunt was somewhere midway in the line. When the ruler got <br/>
to her, she stuck her hands behind her back and despite <br/>
repeated &quot;dire threats&quot;, refused to take the punishment. The <br/>
teacher, furious, took her out to the principle (parenthetically <br/>
saving the rest of the lineup from the ruler). The teacher went back <br/>
to class and the principle asked my aunt what happened. She <br/>
explained (she was innocent BTW) and the principle said &quot;Oh okay&quot; <br/>
and had my aunt help her file some papers or something to kill some <br/>
time then sent her back to the classroom.<br/>

<br/>
One of our local moms was telling me about how she &quot;had&quot; to spank <br/>
her 7 year old because she had refused to be punished with hot <br/>
sauce. She closed her mouth and wouldn&#39;t open it and then ran away <br/>
from her. Apparently she had mad a rude remark aimed at her mom. The <br/>
punishment for saying &quot;rude&quot; things in their house is to have hot <br/>
sauce poured into their mouth. I asked the mom what the point of <br/>
that was and she said &quot;Well, they have to learn to be respectful!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the irony...<br/>
 <br/>
I think people do learn to hold still for punishment when they weigh <br/>
the potential outcomes of resistance (although obviously they still <br/>
are not morally obliged).<br/>

school to have one&#39;s knuckles or bottom whacked with a ruler or<br/>
paddle.  It&#39;s still in the &quot;parent student handbook&quot; that corporal<br/>
punishment will be served when all other forms of discipline are<br/>
exhausted.  When I was in third grade I had been sent out of the room<br/>
for something.  Can&#39;t even remember now what it was, but I know that<br/>
whatever the offense was I hadn&#39;t committed it.  I was leaning against<br/>
the wall waiting for the teacher to come out &quot;and deal with me.&quot;  When<br/>
she came out she took one look at me and was livid.  She whacked me<br/>
with a ruler faster than I could imagine.  I asked (cried) what had I<br/>
done and she pointed to the wall where someone had drawn on the wall.<br/>
I told her I didn&#39;t do it and she told me I was lying and whacked me<br/>
again.  I didn&#39;t even have a friggin&#39; pencil!  I pointed this out and<br/>
she whacked me again for being insolent.   I hated third grade.<br/>
<br/>
After that my mom wrote a note to the school, teacher and school<br/>
district saying that none of her children were ever to be hit again.<br/>
I did the same for my kids when they briefly went to public school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350461180">During research for a project I came across this idea.  I &quot;snipped&quot; it from<br/>
the document and offer it here.  I find it haunting and terrifying while at<br/>
the same time I believe it to be something we should all think about.  Even<br/>
when our families do not have secrets which this might bring to mind, the<br/>
idea is the same.  Once you throw off the mantle of &quot;convention&quot; ...there is<br/>
no going back.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you dare to tell the truth in a family of lies, you commit the<br/>
ultimate act of betrayal by crossing over -- defecting from a territory<br/>
occupied by turbulent histories and perilous borders.  Once you cross that<br/>
line of secrecy, you can no longer turn back.&quot;  ~ Aurora Chang-Ross<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not comfortable with thinking of conventional ideas as like a  <br/>
mantle or blinders, something that traps people.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional ideas exist because they work for the goals of a big  <br/>
chunk of people. The bell curve isn&#39;t something people are forced  <br/>
into. It&#39;s natural. Not everyone exists at the fringes!<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t with the ideas. It&#39;s with people not examining their  <br/>
own goals and not examining if the conventional route will take them  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also not comfortable with the idea of ideas controlling people. In  <br/>
this context, people control themselves. It&#39;s totally in their power  <br/>
to step back and examine or to follow without questioning whether the  <br/>
route matches where they&#39;d like to go.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone decides to examine what their goals are, examine what  <br/>
paths can lead them there, it&#39;s not a matter of can&#39;t go back but a  <br/>
matter of realizing there are better routes.<br/>
<br/>
Some people feel powerless to create the life they want so they create  <br/>
fiction instead. And to maintain the pretense the fiction is real,  <br/>
others need to pretend it&#39;s real too.<br/>
<br/>
I think Aurora&#39;s saying that once the kid points out the Emperor has  <br/>
no clothes, it&#39;s pretty impossible to maintain the fiction ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The more empowered someone feels, the less they need lies and fiction.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how it applies or doesn&#39;t to RA.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>RA?<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean RU?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, using acronyms is offputting to new people. It&#39;s like a  <br/>
secret language used by &quot;those in the know&quot;. Clarity is far more  <br/>
important to discussing unschooling than a secret club handshake ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503250212">RA = unimportant...a by-product of doing three projects at once, ADD, and<br/>
typing while thinking about something else.  Sorry.  I didn&#39;t even notice I<br/>
had done it until I read your response.  I think I had meant to say RU as<br/>
short hand.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Aurora was discussing her multi-racial heritage and how she was treated by<br/>
various people in her life, and taught to hide her mixed blood as a deep<br/>
secret.  Her family kept other secrets but this is the one she was<br/>
discussing.  I thought it was salient in that once we decide that there is a<br/>
better way, a kinder way, a more loving and trusting way to parent, partner,<br/>
and friend...we may often find that those who are not so inclined react with<br/>
hostility or contempt.  I believe this to be for many reasons not the least<br/>
of which is &quot;If you think THAT is the best way to ... then, because I do it<br/>
THIS way... you are saying by default I am wrong.&quot;  Much like mothers who<br/>
bottle-fed will often try to dissuade a daughter from breast-feeding.  All<br/>
that human competition stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100577562">It may also be along the lines of a parent feeling betrayed by the child who <br/>
throws off their ways. The child who chooses to live their life in a way that <br/>
seems in opposition to the way the parent would choose, the family would choose, <br/>
is a greater charge than simply pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes. <br/>
Although Terry Pratchett does a funny little paragraph in Thief of Time on how <br/>
the story was also about the boy who went home in serious trouble for getting <br/>
his family noticed in a not very good light by the royals. So maybe the <br/>
Emperor&#39;s lack of clothes works. Just if you imagine the fallout that comes from <br/>
pointing out that lie to everyone who backed the lie. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there is a righteousness that can come with walking a different path. <br/>
A sense that you have more and better information about the true way to live. I <br/>
know that I felt that about my parents and their choices as parents when <br/>
compared to the ones that I was making. I don&#39;t feel that so much anymore. <br/>
Although I have moments when I think of how I handle something and how I <br/>
remember them handling something and I think &quot;how could they not have seen?&quot; But <br/>
I try not to tell them about those thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the betrayal isn&#39;t in every family. My mom talks about how I and my <br/>
step-sister are so much more aware of the decisions we are making as parents. <br/>
She is looking at our lives as not being a betrayal, a kind of monument to what <br/>
she might have done, but as a different time, different world order sort of <br/>
thing. I think there is some truth in that. My father lives so fully in the <br/>
moment he isn&#39;t necessarily aware of what I&#39;m doing in relationship to what he <br/>
did. Although I&#39;m sure he talks a fair bit about it immediately after he and his <br/>
wife visit. I would guess that some parents are more invested in their <br/>
children&#39;s decisions as adults than my parents were/are. Maybe Aurora Chang-Ross <br/>
has parents like that. <br/>
