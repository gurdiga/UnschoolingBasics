<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157306409">I tried to email you but it didn&#39;t work.  Please contact me about traveling to Boston without going the &quot;regular&quot; route.  I&#39;m coming from Baltimore, MD (which is the same as your drive down to DC basically).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>
