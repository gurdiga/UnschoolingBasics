<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875955999">Hi, I apologize if this has been answered before, but I don&#39;t quite<br/>
have a grip on this particular question, even with all that I have read.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to discuss with my daughter her plans for the future, and<br/>
she said that she wanted to go to college, would it be against the<br/>
unschooling philosophy to give her direction on what types of things<br/>
that she may need to do to get there? For example, if I explain to her<br/>
that she may need to practice writing and math? I&#39;m not forcing her to<br/>
do these things, but I want her to at least be aware that these are<br/>
things she would probably need to do. Is this too much direction? I<br/>
just don&#39;t know if my daughter would even be aware of some things if I<br/>
did not tell her. (Of course, she&#39;s only 11, but I want her to know<br/>
all of her options, all of the time) <br/>
<br/>
Please help me decide if I&#39;m getting too involved... I just know that<br/>
my own options as a child were few, and I want my kids to do whatever<br/>
makes them happy, but also to be prepared for anything!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

My dd, 11, wants to be a vet.  She has asked what she will need to <br/>
study in order to be one.  I have told her, but at this point she is <br/>
not ready to study the science, biology or the math needed.  But she <br/>
is interested in studing animals, mainly cats and their behavior.  She <br/>
has done a lot of research on her own through the computer.  She also <br/>
is starting to volunteer with our vet a few hours each week.<br/>
<br/>
For us, I feel that when my dd is ready to start studying the <br/>
sciences, biology and math, she will.  Here in CA she will be able to <br/>
attend the jr. college and receive dual credit (high school/community <br/>
college).<br/>
<br/>
Eleven is still young enough to just enjoy life and pursue her own <br/>
interest and she will decided when she is ready to seek the knowledge <br/>
needed to pursue a certain career.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305738284">Thanks Kay :)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to work with animals as well- she wants to be a<br/>
dolphin trainer at SeaWorld! (Or a chef, or a paleontologist, or an<br/>
artist... ;)  ) We had asked what type of training is required to be a<br/>
dolphin trainer, and were told that a Psychology degree would be her<br/>
best bet.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you Kay- she will definitely do it when she&#39;s ready. In<br/>
the meantime I love watching and listening to her fascination with<br/>
animals- and art, and cooking, and... everything!<br/>
<br/>
Again, I just didn&#39;t know if it would be too pushy to inform her of<br/>
requirements and such when the subject comes up. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help- I don&#39;t think I ever would have considered<br/>
unschooling if not for these boards!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932306484">How about helping her find out the requirements and then discuss <br/>
with her how to develop those skills rather than telling her &quot;okay <br/>
college means you have to do writing and math let&#39;s get the <br/>
workbooks&quot; - if her writing and math skills aren&#39;t &#39;ready&#39; when she <br/>
applies, she might need to take remedial classes. But guess what? <br/>
Those classes are already there and are typically filled with public <br/>
high school graduates. There are lots of ways to develop writing and <br/>
math skills. Discuss them together. Depending on what she wants to <br/>
pursue (assuming she chooses college), she may be able to simply <br/>
take a CLEP test (college level exam for placement) and have that <br/>
count for all the math she&#39;ll need (DH took all the CLEP tests at <br/>
age 27 when he started college and got about 1 1/2 semesters worth <br/>
of credit for spending some $ to pay for the tests and some time, a <br/>
couple hours each test, and was able to skip most of the general <br/>
courses like fine arts, math, science, comp 101, etc. Not only was <br/>
the cost of the tests less than the cost of the credit hours but it <br/>
freed up space in his schedule to fit courses he took for enjoyment <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t otherwise fit into an undergraduate major).<br/>

a child prepare for a career is to help them get hands-on <br/>
experience--internships, other volunteer work, self-employment, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are particularly well-suited to facilitate this kind of <br/>
experience, and it&#39;s what will make the single biggest difference, <br/>
imnsho, whether on a college track or not.<br/>
<br/>
Interested in a career that works with animals? The math can fall into <br/>
place very quickly when it&#39;s time for tests. In the meantime, consider <br/>
volunteering at a local vet or animal shelter, starting a pet-sitting or <br/>
dog-walking or clean-up service. Make contacts, get experience. This is <br/>
what impresses employers and admissions officers both.<br/>

in order to go to college? It isn&#39;t true. Try reading &quot;The  <br/>
Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter if you don&#39;t believe me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is this too much direction?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re misleading her into thinking that she needs to even THINK  <br/>
about college now - then it is not that it is too much, it is that it  <br/>
is wrong. You need to get your own information right so that you can  <br/>
give her better counsel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know if my daughter would even be aware of some things if I<br/>
&gt; did not tell her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the time she&#39;s 16, 17, 18, 19 -- she&#39;ll know lots of things that  <br/>
you don&#39;t know, too. She&#39;ll have lots of sources of information  <br/>
besides just you. In fact, part of your job is to help her become  <br/>
aware of OTHER sources of information. But not about college now. At  <br/>
11 she shouldn&#39;t have to be THINKING at all about her future - at  <br/>
least not beyond the kid kind of thinking about what she wants to be  <br/>
when she grows up - NOT to be held to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (Of course, she&#39;s only 11, but I want her to know<br/>
&gt; all of her options, all of the time)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not honest or a good idea. NOBODY can know all options all the  <br/>
time. Impossible. You&#39;re picking out college - but are you making  <br/>
sure she knows ALL her options that don&#39;t involve college? Are you  <br/>
making sure she knows what she&#39;d need to do to get into the Peace  <br/>
Corps? The military? An apprenticeship? A technical school? Every  <br/>
possible kind of career that she might eventually be interested in?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Please help me decide if I&#39;m getting too involved...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not too involved - involved in the wrong things. Concerned about the  <br/>
wrong things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just know that<br/>
&gt; my own options as a child were few, and I want my kids to do whatever<br/>
&gt; makes them happy, but also to be prepared for anything!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Impossible.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - support their CURRENT interests - get involved, be aware of  <br/>
THEIR passions. Observe them and how they choose to learn things -  <br/>
what lights up their eyes, what gets their attention, what kinds of  <br/>
things do they keep coming back to, what do they talk about, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Your job is to support those things while providing a rich  <br/>
environment with a variety of options -- notice the word &quot;option&quot; -  <br/>
everything is optional - but you do make sure that kids have lots of  <br/>
opportunity to FIND their own interests and passions - lots of  <br/>
experience, lots to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The big THING about unschooling that is so amazing is that kids WILL  <br/>
figure out what they want to do and what it takes to do it when they  <br/>
are used to -- guess what? Figuring out what they want to do and what  <br/>
it takes to do it. But at 11, figuring out what she wants to do and  <br/>
what it takes to do it means figuring out that she really likes to  <br/>
play dressups and that she needs to go to a thrift store to get more  <br/>
things to dress up in.<br/>
<br/>
Your part in that might be to notice that she&#39;s having a lot of fun  <br/>
playing dressups and you might say, &quot;Hey, while we&#39;re out let&#39;s stop  <br/>
at the thrift store and see if you can find any cool dress-ups.&quot; If  <br/>
she&#39;s never heard of a thrift store before then there you go - you&#39;ve  <br/>
introduced her to something new. And while you&#39;re there, you might  <br/>
see some appliance that she&#39;s never seen - a waffle iron or a  <br/>
watering can....whatever. You&#39;ll say, &quot;Oh, look at this - how cool.&quot;  <br/>
And if she&#39;s interested, you MIGHT talk about it and if she&#39;s REALLY  <br/>
interested you might buy it and go home and make waffles. And maybe  <br/>
she will enjoy that and you&#39;ll get into cooking a lot together -  <br/>
starting with making up unusual toppings for your waffles.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe none of that will happen. Maybe while you&#39;re in the thrift  <br/>
store you&#39;ll see a handpainted umbrella and she&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, I could  <br/>
do that - I could paint umbrellas and sell them.&quot; And you&#39;ll talk  <br/>
about what kind of paint to use and maybe get some and try it out and  <br/>
who knows where that might lead.<br/>
<br/>
OR - maybe you&#39;ll browse around, find a gorgeous wedding dress for  <br/>
sale and buy it and she&#39;ll go home and play &quot;wedding&quot; for months and  <br/>
develop a lifelong love of creating beautiful weddings and end up a  <br/>
wedding planner.<br/>
<br/>
OR not. Maybe you&#39;ll just browse around and find nothing of interest  <br/>
and leave and do something else. That&#39;s okay. Move on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about as a next step try giving up even talking about 11 year  <br/>
olds &quot;studying&quot; things - but change the terminology to say they are  <br/>
learning about things by pursuing their interests in various ways. It  <br/>
may sound nitpicky, but it really helps to get away from that school- <br/>
think - the idea that to learn you have to &quot;study&quot; is wrong. &quot;Study&quot;  <br/>
has such a different ring to it and if we&#39;re trying to get away from  <br/>
&quot;school-think&quot; we might want to let that word slip out of our  <br/>
vocabulary for a while, along with &quot;teach.&quot; (I KNOW there are times  <br/>
to use it - people say they &quot;study karate,&quot; for example. But - as an  <br/>
exercise to help &quot;get&quot; unschooling better - try to use &quot;learn&quot; in  <br/>
place of &quot;study&quot; or &quot;teach&quot; whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
I just spent 20 minutes reading up on an actor I&#39;d never seen - his  <br/>
name is Kyle MacLachlan and he plays David Swain on &quot;In Justice.&quot; I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;studying about Kyle MacLachlan&quot; - but I was learning about  <br/>
him. And the reason I was interested in him is because a young friend  <br/>
of mine is playing David Swain as a young child - so I was curious  <br/>
about how much he actually looked like Kyle MacLachlan and one thing  <br/>
led to another and I just satisfied my smidgen of curiosity about the  <br/>
actor. Who knows - maybe if he&#39;d been absolutely fascinating I&#39;d have  <br/>
gotten seriously interested and moved on to start an international  <br/>
fan club. LOL - my point is that, yes, let&#39;s support our kids&#39;  <br/>
interests but, let&#39;s be careful about making too big a deal about  <br/>
them being on a &quot;path&quot; toward a career. LOTS of kids say they want to  <br/>
be vets when they are 11 years old. I did, myself. At 11, my 15 year  <br/>
old, Rosie, was absolutely totally planning to have a career  <br/>
involving horses. Now she says she wants to be a librarian. So we got  <br/>
very involved in 4-H and horses for several years and now she  <br/>
volunteers in the library every week and is doing a Girl Scout Silver  <br/>
Award Project related to libraries. And she could very possibly end  <br/>
up becoming a librarian. Maybe a horseback riding librarian &lt;G&gt;. But  <br/>
maybe she&#39;ll move on to something else. We parents have to be really  <br/>
careful about not getting ourselves over-excited about our young  <br/>
kids&#39; plans - let them have those plans, but don&#39;t make such a big  <br/>
deal of them that we inadvertently make it hard for them to reconsider.<br/>
<br/>
If we think of it MORE as supporting their current interests and not  <br/>
as getting them prepared for the future, we&#39;ll do better by them.  <br/>
Really - and it is worth talking a LOT about why that is true - so  <br/>
I&#39;d suggest that those who aren&#39;t convinced or aren&#39;t sure they  <br/>
understand why, please ask questions or go ahead and state the  <br/>
counter-arguments that might be running through your heads as you  <br/>
read this, so that we can get them out in the open and dissect them.  <br/>
It might be a little hard to do - but VERY worth it. SO worth it!<br/>

into the careers they&#39;re into. And one time we got a chance to chat  <br/>
with one of the women working with the whales at Sea World and my  <br/>

If a child is INTERESTED in what the training or background is of  <br/>
people in certain careers, then you&#39;d help them pursue that interest.<br/>

that if she wants to be a vet she&#39;d better get started practicing  <br/>
handwriting and math.<br/>

Not sure if that difference is clear, but it is critical to &quot;getting&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984391073">Thanks for your response Pam, but I think that I may have been<br/>
misunderstood. The question that I posted was in regards to a one-time<br/>
conversation that I had with my daughter... I didn&#39;t mean to make it<br/>
sound as if that were my entire FOCUS. <br/>
<br/>
The truth of it is, I brought her home so that she can be HERSELF- and<br/>
 I never have held any expectations for her other than that she be<br/>
HAPPY. Her last two years of PS were so difficult for her that I knew<br/>
she didn&#39;t belong there, and I have no intention of re-creating that<br/>
for her at home. I enjoy encouraging ALL of her interests, and I have<br/>
seen her blossom into such a vibrant person in the last six months,<br/>
that I can hardly contain my enthusiasm when people ask about her. <br/>
<br/>
It just so happened that the subject of college came up, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to be forceful- I&#39;m trying very hard to avoid that- so I regret<br/>
that it sounded like I was.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t take this as a negative post, as I really just feel the<br/>
need to clarify my objectives- (and I hate the way that writing<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow body language to show that I am NOT trying to be crabby<br/>
here) I fully intend to let my children choose, at all times, what it<br/>
is that they want to pursue. I simply was worried about those old<br/>
fears creeping into my conversation when the &quot;c&quot; word came up. She<br/>
asked, I told. Perhaps I told too much, but it hasn&#39;t come up since,<br/>
and I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be picking up textbooks ANYTIME soon. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again- this post as well as all the others have been helpful in<br/>
my pursuit of answers!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not honest or a good idea. NOBODY can know all options all the  <br/>
&gt; time. Impossible. You&#39;re picking out college - but are you making  <br/>
&gt; sure she knows ALL her options that don&#39;t involve college? Are you  <br/>
&gt; making sure she knows what she&#39;d need to do to get into the Peace  <br/>
&gt; Corps? The military? An apprenticeship? A technical school? Every  <br/>
&gt; possible kind of career that she might eventually be interested in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please help me decide if I&#39;m getting too involved...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not too involved - involved in the wrong things. Concerned about the  <br/>
&gt; wrong things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; my own options as a child were few, and I want my kids to do whatever<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes them happy, but also to be prepared for anything!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Impossible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT - support their CURRENT interests - get involved, be aware of  <br/>
&gt; THEIR passions. Observe them and how they choose to learn things -  <br/>
&gt; what lights up their eyes, what gets their attention, what kinds of  <br/>
&gt; things do they keep coming back to, what do they talk about, and so on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your job is to support those things while providing a rich  <br/>
&gt; environment with a variety of options -- notice the word &quot;option&quot; -  <br/>
&gt; everything is optional - but you do make sure that kids have lots of  <br/>
&gt; opportunity to FIND their own interests and passions - lots of  <br/>
&gt; experience, lots to choose from.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The big THING about unschooling that is so amazing is that kids WILL  <br/>
&gt; figure out what they want to do and what it takes to do it when they  <br/>
&gt; are used to -- guess what? Figuring out what they want to do and what  <br/>
&gt; it takes to do it. But at 11, figuring out what she wants to do and  <br/>
&gt; what it takes to do it means figuring out that she really likes to  <br/>
&gt; play dressups and that she needs to go to a thrift store to get more  <br/>
&gt; things to dress up in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your part in that might be to notice that she&#39;s having a lot of fun  <br/>
&gt; playing dressups and you might say, &quot;Hey, while we&#39;re out let&#39;s stop  <br/>
&gt; at the thrift store and see if you can find any cool dress-ups.&quot; If  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s never heard of a thrift store before then there you go - you&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; introduced her to something new. And while you&#39;re there, you might  <br/>
&gt; see some appliance that she&#39;s never seen - a waffle iron or a  <br/>
&gt; watering can....whatever. You&#39;ll say, &quot;Oh, look at this - how cool.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; And if she&#39;s interested, you MIGHT talk about it and if she&#39;s REALLY  <br/>
&gt; interested you might buy it and go home and make waffles. And maybe  <br/>
&gt; she will enjoy that and you&#39;ll get into cooking a lot together -  <br/>
&gt; starting with making up unusual toppings for your waffles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or maybe none of that will happen. Maybe while you&#39;re in the thrift  <br/>
&gt; store you&#39;ll see a handpainted umbrella and she&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, I could  <br/>
&gt; do that - I could paint umbrellas and sell them.&quot; And you&#39;ll talk  <br/>
&gt; about what kind of paint to use and maybe get some and try it out and  <br/>
&gt; who knows where that might lead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OR - maybe you&#39;ll browse around, find a gorgeous wedding dress for  <br/>
&gt; sale and buy it and she&#39;ll go home and play &quot;wedding&quot; for months and  <br/>
&gt; develop a lifelong love of creating beautiful weddings and end up a  <br/>
&gt; wedding planner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OR not. Maybe you&#39;ll just browse around and find nothing of interest  <br/>
&gt; and leave and do something else. That&#39;s okay. Move on.<br/>

I never thought about the word study before in that context.  Your <br/>
right, it does sound &quot;schoolish&quot; and needs to be avoided.  So <br/>
Elizabeth was learning about cats and their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And Elizabeth will most likely change her mind about what career she <br/>
wants several times before she finally decides.  Actually I was a <br/>
Admin Asst for 10 years and decided to go to college at 30 to become a <br/>
nurse.  Now, I stay home to be a mom, the greatest job yet!<br/>
