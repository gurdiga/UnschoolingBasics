<div id="ygrps-yiv-30446755">hi <br/>
 this topic of austin powers rekindled a thought of controversy in <br/>
showing rocky horror picture show at 10pm on the first day of the live <br/>
and learn conference. i thought my, my kid would probably be okay with <br/>
it but the sexual intercourse  , not so graphically displayed, would no <br/>
doubt be problematic to some parents , I must warn them to tell the <br/>
unsuspecting. but this line of comments allows me to just join in on <br/>
the experience of absorbing and trying to understand peoples reactions <br/>
and reflecting on my own over protectiveness.<br/>
