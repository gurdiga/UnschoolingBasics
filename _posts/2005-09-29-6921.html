<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779868002">&quot;I am not trying to be argumentative.  This is just my way of testing<br/>
this theory of unschooling.  That said...  example:<br/>
<br/>
I had to learn multiplication tables.  <br/>
I never forgot them.  <br/>
I use them them all the time.<br/>
How does this fit in?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t fit in, you weren&#39;t an unschooler!!;)<br/>
<br/>
There are many things we were forced to learn, but I agree with others<br/>
that we would have eventually learned them anyway, in a more joyful<br/>
manner. <br/>
<br/>
Do we HAVE to memorize a table of facts in order to thrive in this<br/>
world? I say no. My children all have their own way of figuring out<br/>
number equations, no two are exactly alike.<br/>
I had the times tables down pat in third grade, but felt stupid at<br/>
math all my life! What is more important, for a child to believe they<br/>
are capable and intelligent and can learn anything they need, or to<br/>
have some table of facts memorized that may or may not be helpful to them?<br/>
<br/>
I say the multiplication tables are highly overrated as a table worth<br/>
memorizing. If a person finds it useful, they can memorize it at the<br/>
time they see the necessity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412987699">We are an Eclectic Homeschool family but we use a lot of Life <br/>
Learning or &quot;Unschooling&quot; techniques because I my self am a <br/>
knowledge addict and believe that all the things I have truly <br/>
learned in my life was learned through doing and applying.  I have <br/>
forgotten most of my Public School carreer and I am just past 30 <br/>
years old. Thank God I dove into life and slept,ate and drank what <br/>
ever knowledge I found after leaving THAT place.  I found college <br/>
much more rewarding but way toooooo time consuming.  I could learn <br/>
all that stuff in an eigth of the time, with hardly any of the <br/>
stress, expense or travel. Sorry, back to the point...<br/>
  <br/>
I was recently using some rote worksheets to teach my daughter math <br/>
but then I realized that she had no concept of how to figure out <br/>
life problems with what she had learned.  I chucked the worksheets <br/>
and we now make up our own math thought experiments.  In a few weeks <br/>
we have gone from doing sheets of addition and subtraction to <br/>
exploring concepts of multiplication, division, fractions, money <br/>
problems and she even tried to drag me into a percentage problem.  I <br/>
told her I would look it up and study it myself so I didn&#39;t screw it <br/>
up and teach her wrong {I DISPIZE percentages%%%} Math is becoming <br/>
fun for both of us, she is learning it faster and she now <br/>
****WANTS**** to memorize the multiplication tables so she can <br/>
figure out problems faster.  What a difference, no more long <br/>
sighs... ohhhhhmoooommmmm&#39;s... or but&#39;s... She is making everything <br/>
into a math problem... now how do I get her to stop, so I can think <br/>
in english instead of math.  <br/>

<br/>
Nope! I remember HAVING to memorize the element chart in chemistry. I am  not <br/>
a chemist. I have never used it since. I can&#39;t even remember most of it now.  <br/>
I think the only time I&#39;ve ever seen anything pertaining to it is maybe  from <br/>
a crossword puzzle or Trivial Pursuit. <br/>
 <br/>
Same with the multiplication table. I remember being 8 yrs old and in tears  <br/>
with my father standing over me drilling it into me. I still struggled with <br/>
it.  I love my calculator these days. My parents just never understood why I had <br/>
such  a hard time with numbers. My dad being an engineer and my mother was an <br/>
 accountant/bookkeeper. It &quot;should&#39;ve been in my genes&quot;. I preferred the <br/>
written  word. My biggest fascination was linguistics... where words come from, <br/>
how they  evolved... in college, I took a class, History of the English <br/>
Language. My  favorite class. I can still read and pronounce Middle English.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very cool. In 7th grade English, we learned the Lord&#39;s Prayer in old <br/>
or middle english (I forget which exactly) but I still remember a <br/>
few tidbits of it because it was so cool.<br/>
<br/>
In college, one of my favorite classes was an elective I took on <br/>
semantics. It was fun - like a puzzle - trying to rephrase things <br/>
and digging into the construction of things. I still remember <br/>
rewriting (as a class assignment) the Pledge of Allegiance using <br/>
only a set of about 100 words (apparently someone had determined <br/>
that these hundred or so words are all that is needed to communicate <br/>
in the English language, eg instead of 3 words black, white, and not <br/>
just two black and not black - I don&#39;t exactly agree but it was fun <br/>
to play with). We could not use a single original word (Had to <br/>
figure something that sounded okay for &quot;I&quot; - that was tough).<br/>
<br/>
But then my dad is a veteran crossword puzzler with a journalism <br/>
degree from NYU (though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s genetically related <br/>
generally speaking).<br/>
