<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087565570">another list I am on is talking about how some children &quot;fail&quot; at<br/>
unschooling.  The concept is completely foreign to me, but I have discussed<br/>
it with them as best I can.  The consensus there is that some children need<br/>
structure.  I never really thought of structure and unschooling being<br/>
mutually exclusive (mutually independant, perhaps, but not exclusive).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I suggested that a child who needed structure would probably<br/>
provide it him or herself - with the parent&#39;s assistance perhaps, but not<br/>
necessarily and certainly not with any need for coercion.  Unfortunately, I<br/>
really didn&#39;t have any strong examples to back me up.  I was wondering if<br/>
anyone here did - or had something suggesting that structure may not be as<br/>
necessary to these children as the people there are suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

What kind of unschooling parent is assessing the child as &quot;failed?&quot;   If<br/>
a parent is assessing a child as passing or failing that parent does not<br/>
understand unschooling.   Never did.  Never understood what it involved. <br/>
 So then it&#39;s the parent who failed.    Failed to understand unschooling<br/>
in the first place.  Failed to provide their child with enough freedom,<br/>
trust, attention and assistance to do the things he or she wanted.      <br/>
<br/>
There are certainly people who like to be organized like to have a plan<br/>
in place and do things systematically, but an unschooler wouldn&#39;t assume<br/>
it&#39;s a cry for text books and lessons and quizzes.     <br/>
<br/>
I think these are the parents who aren&#39;t creative enough or interested<br/>
enough to find new and wonderful things to offer their kids and who get<br/>
wiggy when said kid, whether through natural interest or from a lack of<br/>
better things to do, chooses TV or video games. <br/>
<br/>
How many of the parents with &quot;failed&quot; children thought the TV was on too<br/>
much?  I&#39;ve been in those discussions too...&quot;my son was staying in his<br/>
pajamas all day.... my daughter only wanted to watch reruns of Full<br/>
House... my kid did nothing but play video games eighty five hours a<br/>
day... &quot;   Or, after being nagged and harassed about doing this or that<br/>
or not doing enough the poor kid finally was convinced he needed<br/>
structure by the crazed  &quot;you need structure - you need structure&quot; mom.  <br/>
None of that is unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169791235">Looks like I shouldn&#39;t have let myself get sucked in.  They&#39;re not talking<br/>
about their own children.  They are judging someone else&#39;s (no, I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize that myself at first - it&#39;s just now coming out). It really amazes<br/>
me sometimes how some people can complain about other people judging their<br/>
children for hours on end and then turn around and do exactly the same thing<br/>
to someone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting out of the conversation as it&#39;s turning ugly (now they are<br/>
talking about how children left to discover their own morals become selfish<br/>
bullies - not all, of course, but &quot;the majority&quot;).  I&#39;m not even sure if<br/>
they still think they are talking about unschooling or not.  It&#39;s certainly<br/>
not any unschooler *I* ever met.<br/>

  How is unschooling &#39;letting a child discover his own morals?&#39;   Seems to me that, if anything, sending your kid to school is a sure way  to leave him adrift at the mercy of everyone else&#39;s &#39;morals&#39; with no  choice but to find his own way.  It sounds like they&#39;ve decided  that most unschooling parents are negligent and raising selfish  bullies. <br/>
  <br/>
  I can honestly say I&#39;ve never met a bully among unschooling  children.  The bullies I&#39;ve seen (both as child and parent) are  usually kids were who are or were totally controlled by their parents,  and bullying is just a way for them to transfer that pain and feel in  control for a few moments.<br/>
