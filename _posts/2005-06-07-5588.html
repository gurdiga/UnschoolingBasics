 </span></blockquote>There are books of kitchen table science - experiments you can do with <br/>
common household things like vinegar and baking soda and elmer&#39;s glue <br/>
and such. You might find a couple (check them out at the library until <br/>
you find ones you like a lot to buy). Look through and maybe stock <br/>
a &quot;science cabinet&quot; with bottles of vinegar, baking powder, baking <br/>
soda, dried beans, paper towels (lol), assorted cleaned out jars, a <br/>
set of measuring spoons, food coloring, assorted extracts, (keep <br/>
packets of dry yeast handy in fridge), etc. That way you&#39;re ready to <br/>
go at a moment&#39;s notice. Maybe even keep an &quot;inventory sheet&quot; so you <br/>
know when to replenish stuff at the market. <br/>
<br/>
Also, google &quot;steve spangler science&quot; - lots of cool science gear <br/>
available. Edmond Scientific is another place DH likes (that&#39;s where <br/>
he got his 11&quot; square fresnel lense for $5 so he can start fires at <br/>
will with just a little sunlight and some tinder - yes I said DH, he&#39;s <br/>
such a kid at heart lol).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033769485">This is info copy/pasted from the Unschooling Discussion that I saved.  <br/>
Thought it might be helpful for this thread.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DD doesn&#39;t eat non-food items (at nearly 7) -- while I think of all of <br/>
these things as safe, I wouldn&#39;t give rubbing alcohol to someone who <br/>
might taste it.  This is all stuff that she likes to mix together just <br/>
to see what happens.  She was enormously pleased with herself, for <br/>
example, the day that she discovered that oil and colored water in her <br/>
test tube would make something sort of like a wave bottle, or a lava <br/>
lamp.<br/>
<br/>
She has a large supply of plastic test tubes and plastic pipettes and <br/>
test tube stands and some recycled glass and plastic jars to mix and <br/>
play in.<br/>
<br/>
In DD&#39;s science &quot;kit&quot; she has little baby food jars filled with things <br/>
from the house and kitchen: sand, cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, baking <br/>
soda, baking powder (fizzes in water, since it has a dry acid already <br/>
in it), vinegar, antacids (she is past the stage of eating things like <br/>
this), vitamin C, fruit fresh (a combination of dry acids), cocoa, <br/>
sugar, salt, rock salt, oil in different colors (i.e. xvirgin olive oil <br/>
is greenish, canola more yellow, etc.), rubbing alcohol, coarse <br/>
glitter, fine glitter, borax solution, glue, tub tints (little dry <br/>
pellets of color sold for use in playing in the bathtub), liquid <br/>
watercolors, and probably some other things I&#39;m not thinking of.  Oh, <br/>
yeah, some packets of dry cool-aid in different colors.  I&#39;m thinking <br/>
of getting different colors of lamp oil, but haven&#39;t yet.<br/>
<br/>
She has little baby food jars filled with other things purchased from a <br/>
kid&#39;s science supply house: fake snow (superabsorbent polymer), the <br/>
kind of superabsorbant powder that they put into baby diapers,  a kind <br/>
of superabsorbant powder that turns into little gelly &quot;crystals,&quot;  glow <br/>
- in - the dark powder, magic sand (stays dry in water).<br/>
<br/>
She also has kid-sized plastic eye protectors that she wears for the <br/>
dress-up pretend factor of being a chemist when she plays with her <br/>
stuff.  I am planning to make her a kid-sized lab coat with her name on <br/>
the pocket, but haven&#39;t done it yet.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, she just likes to play around and see what happens -- but <br/>
here are a few combinations that definitely &quot;do&quot; something:  slime <br/>
(borax solution and glue), fizzy bath bombs (oil, baking soda, and <br/>
Kool-aid mixed together and formed into a small ball - fizzes and <br/>
releases oil and sent when dropped into a bath); cornstarch and water <br/>
turns into a weird substance that seems liquid until you push on it and <br/>
then it seems solid.  If you put plain whole milk in a shallow saucer <br/>
and drop little bits of watercolor or foodcolor in, the colors will <br/>
mostly stay in place -- touch the center with a toothpick dipped in <br/>
dishwashing liquid and the colors will instantly begin to mix and <br/>
swirl.<br/>
<br/>
I second someone&#39;s suggestion of the Kampf experiment of the week -- <br/>
it&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
We get some of our stuff from www.stevesspanglerscience.com.  Lydia <br/>
sometimes likes to keep her concotions in test tubes, rather than <br/>
rinsing them out to start over, so we get them in bulk - they&#39;re about <br/>
40cents each, when you buy them 120 at at time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this is helpful.</div>

Got a chuckle out of this one - my DH is a kid at heart too so I know <br/>
exactly what you mean!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
