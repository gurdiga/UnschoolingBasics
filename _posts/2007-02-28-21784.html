<div id="ygrps-yiv-990001746">First year hslng, &quot;looking&quot; at unschooling since Aug 06.  Slowly <br/>
implementing since Nov 06.  I loved school so I have a lot of <br/>
deschooling to do for myself.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think my 7yo ds will benefit from unschooling.  He&#39;s <br/>
extremely bright, but a reluctant reader.  Understands higher math <br/>
concepts, but struggles with simple math sometimes.  Very stong-<br/>
willed (gets from his mom), very tender (gets from his dad) and has <br/>
so much energy.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 questions to start. (I have been reading posts here and the <br/>
suggested links-thank you for everything!)<br/>
<br/>
1)  Carschooling - he does his best thinking in the car.  I&#39;m still <br/>
confused on him deciding what/when to learn and how I am to help him <br/>
with that.  For instance, on a recent 20 minute trip to an art class, <br/>
led by his questioning, we discussed religion, toxic waste, volcanos, <br/>
being famous, pet ownership, geology and whether kryptonite was <br/>
real.  Now that is a lot to cover in 20 minutes, but I did my best. <br/>
lol.  Do I write all these topics down and run like crazy to the <br/>
library or look them all up online and show him links?  We do have <br/>
books on some of his favorite topics, but he is not interested in <br/>
reading or being read to (even though, he wanted us to read many <br/>
books per night when he was younger).  How does this work???<br/>
<br/>
2)  Testing is fast approaching and I am getting nervous.  On the one <br/>
hand, I think he could easily pass the first grade CAT test based on <br/>
what I know of our state requirements for knowledge (in VA), but on <br/>
the other hand, I&#39;m not POSITIVE if he can.  I don&#39;t know what is on <br/>
the test and I&#39;ll have to read it for him - I hope that is <br/>
allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I realize he is young and would like to let him learn at his pace, <br/>
but with state requirements over my head...<br/>
<br/>
Any understanding and help with this is much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin</div>

Hi Robin.. I am in VA also.. and you will be surprised how easy the CAT  test <br/>
is and that your son will probably pass it with flying colors  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly wouldn&#39;t do this with all of them, and maybe with none <br/>
of them. If he seems really interested *and* wanting to do something <br/>
other than talk, yes, do some research so you can help him follow <br/>
his interest. But keep in mind that &quot;just&quot; chatting with him may be <br/>
enough. My stepson, for example, learns mainly by talking to people. <br/>
He remembers amazing things from past conversations, but very little <br/>
that he reads. In school he was at a disadvantage bc &quot;talking to <br/>
people&quot; isn&#39;t really considered a &quot;valid&quot; way to learn. <br/>
<br/>
I really recommend looking at other learning styles and the &quot;Theory <br/>
of Mulitple Intelligences&quot;. Here&#39;s a link to get you started:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the way math is taught in schools doesn&#39;t have much to do with <br/>
the way people really learn math - that&#39;s why so many people have <br/>
trouble with it. &quot;Simple math&quot; and &quot;higher math&quot; are school <br/>
concepts. Pretty young kids can conceptualize &quot;higher&quot; ideas before <br/>
they can do &quot;simple&quot; computations. <br/>
<br/>
Even working with language has a whole lot more to it than reading. <br/>
I mentioned my stepson as one example. I also have a girlfriend <br/>
whose dd could be considered a &quot;reluctant reader/writer&quot; but she <br/>
loves to create elaborate plays and stories. Its become a family <br/>
event for her to dictate a play, assign roles, pick out costumes, <br/>
and then the whole family puts on a little mini-production for <br/>
themselves. But this girl (she&#39;s 6) won&#39;t read beyond basic stuff <br/>
and can&#39;t remember how to write about half the alphabet. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1)  Carschooling - he does his best thinking in the car.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might be worth considering if it&#39;s not so much that he &quot;does his <br/>
best thinking&quot; in the car as that its when he has the easiest time <br/>
communicating his ideas. It could be a matter of how he thinks and <br/>
learns *or* it could be that mom keeps pretty busy and needs to make <br/>
more time to chat. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say anything at all about state testing, its not an issue <br/>
for me, but I&#39;d check with local unschoolers and even homeschoolers <br/>
for ideas about this. It may be that you don&#39;t have to test.<br/>

Followed that link from another post last night.  Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;Simple math&quot; and &quot;higher math&quot; are school <br/>
~concepts. Pretty young kids can conceptualize &quot;higher&quot; ideas before <br/>
~they can do &quot;simple&quot; computations. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for correcting my wording.  That was what I was trying to say -<br/>
remember what I stated in the first para. - I have deschooling to do <br/>
for me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
~It might be worth considering if it&#39;s not so much that he &quot;does his <br/>
~best thinking&quot; in the car as that its when he has the easiest time <br/>
~communicating his ideas. It could be a matter of how he thinks and <br/>

<br/>
That is certainly one way of looking at it.  But to evaluate my <br/>
time...other than a few household chores, my time centers around my <br/>
children and their activities. (right now is Daddy time-which is why <br/>
I am free to type ;-))  All things related to &quot;just me&quot; are usually <br/>
done after they&#39;ve gone to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have a very snuggly 3yo ds.  We eat all meals, even snacks <br/>
seated together, no tv, and there is a lot of conversation going on. <br/>
Those intense questions don&#39;t only occur in the car.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>
much a waking to bedtime thing.  I only used that as an example.  I <br/>
think or rather know, I&#39;m meeting his needs, I was more or less <br/>
asking for help on how to unschool. Of course I know that is <br/>
different for all of us, there isn&#39;t a set rule and I think you <br/>
cleared that up with your response to converse with him on the <br/>
topics and impart what knowledge I possess and then research further <br/>
if he iniates it.<br/>
<br/>
I will certainly keep your post in mind and see if I can find other <br/>
opportunities to open up the channels with him.  I think it is worthy <br/>
investment of time for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insight,<br/>

Do no harm. Computational ability will come because it is really  <br/>

get old.<br/>
<br/>
My question would be whose idea was it to modify the game and for what <br/>
purpose?  I am wondering if your intention to match numbers is to give the <br/>
game a new challenge because your child wants it, or is it because you are <br/>
looking for an opportunity to practice math?<br/>
<br/>
I have found that an ulterior motive can take the joy out of a game.  The <br/>
opportunity to practice math exists without having to superimpose it on an <br/>
activity or game that young children enjoy simply because it is easily <br/>
mastered.  Of course if your child initiated this creative twist, well then, <br/>
that&#39;s an example of an unschooled life!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34119641">Well, Lisa, I had this long response typed up and just lost it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take a shorter approach to answering your post.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
diligently reading the &quot;online&quot; resources that keep popping up on <br/>
this board, such as Sandra Dodd, Danielle Conger, Joyce Fetterol and <br/>
I&#39;ve seen them all mention &quot;math games&quot;.  Sandra even gave a link to <br/>
Pam Sarooshian&#39;s link on dice games which I&#39;ve also used with my son.<br/>
<br/>
To answer whether or not I force the issue or does he, well in the <br/>
beginning of our school year I had to be creative and come up with <br/>
ways to help him &quot;learn&quot; what was needed in our curriculum.  Since <br/>
he&#39;s not a sit down kind of kid, I played games.  So, yes, in the <br/>
beginning I did impose it upon him.  However now, as we are working <br/>
toward an unschooling life, I don&#39;t force these ideas on him.  He <br/>
will ask to play my math games just as frequently as he will ask to <br/>
play Trouble or Zathura, etc.  Although since his undertanding has <br/>
increased, he asks less and less and that is fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it is that Jarod likes math.  He questions me <br/>
everyday about money, how long until we visit Grandma, when are my <br/>
school friends coming home, and even addition such as 800+200=1000.  <br/>
I don&#39;t understand how playing games with him, even ones I&#39;ve made up <br/>
to help with his math understanding cannot be unschooling.  I&#39;m not <br/>
forcing him to look at flash cards, or do endless problems on a <br/>
worksheet, or drilling him, I&#39;m just finding a way to reinforce sums <br/>
of 10 so that when he wants to know if 800+200=1000 (and he does), <br/>
he&#39;ll know how to get there.  I truly want him to understand <br/>
the &quot;process&quot; rather than the &quot;rules&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Please feel to enlighten me further if I am way out in left <br/>
field. :-)  I appreciate your input.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077000480">One of my kids sometimes thinks about things a long long LONG time (weeks, <br/>
months, sometimes years) before wanting to discuss or question with anyone else. <br/>
It&#39;s occasionally really baffling and frustrating because she&#39;ll just pick up <br/>
a conversation/thought where she left off, weeks later. I send her links to <br/>
think I know she&#39;s interested in and sometimes I luck out and hit on something <br/>
that&#39;s currently percolating. <br/>
<br/>
Another of my kids wants to talk about everything. Right when he&#39;s thinking <br/>
it. I&#39;ve described it as him needing to run his thoughts through someone else&#39;s <br/>
head so he can figure out what he thinks. Kathy Wentz uses the phrase &quot;social <br/>
learner&quot; which I think is a nice little description. I always know what he&#39;s <br/>
thinking about. Especially at 2am. If I think he&#39;d appreciate the help finding <br/>
more information I do it. If I see an article relating to something he&#39;s run <br/>
past me recently I&#39;ll point it out to him, often he reads them.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, conversation is the essence of unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025916416">I get Lisa&#39;s point - turning games into lessons is not a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
But, I want to point out that there is absolutely nothing wrong with  <br/>
mom initiating the creative twist. THAT is also an example of an  <br/>
unschooled life. And there is nothing wrong with thinking that the  <br/>
new twist will help our kid learn something that we think he might  <br/>
really like to learn, either.<br/>
<br/>
Just worries me that sometimes people treat math stuff differently  <br/>
than other stuff. If you watched a movie that your child really  <br/>
liked, would you hesitate to recommend another movie that you thought  <br/>
he&#39;d also like? So, if you&#39;re playing a game and you think, &quot;Oh, I  <br/>
bet he&#39;d enjoy it if we changed the rules a little - make it a bit  <br/>
more challenging by introducing some addition,&quot; that&#39;s cool, too.<br/>
<br/>
It is a fine line between supporting learning versus pushing it on  <br/>
our kids. We have to know them really well. We have to be sensitive.  <br/>
We have to know that this is a kid who will enjoy learning this new  <br/>
thing and appreciate being a little challenged.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with math, in particular, is that so many parents are,  <br/>
themselves, overly anxious and sometimes even phobic about it. So, I  <br/>
think most people might need to be just a smidgen on the lookout for  <br/>
ways to support math learning in natural and fun ways. Supporting  <br/>
other kinds of learning might come more naturally to the parents. If  <br/>
parents are math-anxious, they&#39;ll avoid math and their kids will miss  <br/>
out on the support that they could have had if the parents had been  <br/>
more comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents can go ahead and introduce fun math stuff into games  <br/>
or art projects or in cooking or sewing or carpentry, etc., as long  <br/>
as they&#39;re remembering that the point of a game is to have fun, the  <br/>
point of art is to be creative, the point of cooking is to make good  <br/>
food, and so on - the learning is incidental.<br/>
<br/>
If you just remember the basic unschooling principal of supporting  <br/>
our kids&#39; interests by providing ways to do more, expand, add to,  <br/>
make connections, etc., then if you&#39;re kid is interested in playing a  <br/>
certain game, you&#39;ll naturally think of other similar games he might  <br/>
enjoy, ways to expand the game, to relate it to other interests, to  <br/>
add to it and modify it, and so on. Just like with any other  <br/>
interest, except that there are lots of parents who simply won&#39;t  <br/>
think about adding to it in ways that involve mathematics because  <br/>
they avoid math without even realizing they&#39;re doing it.<br/>

I am in VA and you can do Portfolio&#39;s.. Although I have always tested with  <br/>
the Cat also and I test the way I want.. (Meaning..I don&#39;t time them) and they  <br/>
always do well...  I disagree with the timing bit...cause everyone is  <br/>
different and timing really stresses people out.. Besides..I am giving them what  <br/>
they wanted.. a test score.. :) <br/>

the ones used in the school.  And we don&#39;t have to start until 4th grade.  <br/>
Are there other options in VA beside testing?  Also - our tests can be <br/>
administrated at home which eliminates oversite by strangers and no time <br/>
restraints.  Unschoolers handle this in a variety of ways.  If that is the <br/>
case in VA - at home tests give you a lot of flexibility.<br/>

sorry i didn&#39;t respond sooner (i&#39;ve been out of town) but - no i don&#39;t think <br/>
you sound way out in left field to me at all...and please forgive me if i <br/>
made you feel defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I was being suspect when i heard the phrase &quot;practice math&quot; in relation to a <br/>
game.  Perhaps its from my own experience where i need to check my motives <br/>
to be sure that they are not manipulative based on what i think (or others <br/>
think i/we should be doing) rather than trully listening to what my child <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
I have found when i&#39;ve suggested math games (even those posted on <br/>
unschooling lists) they seem to be more of an imposition and not always <br/>
received well - must be something in my presentation - certainly something <br/>
i&#39;ve had to work on....&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

the area of math so as to be more knowledgable and confident in my ability <br/>
to converse about the subject with my kids in a more intuitive way (as i do <br/>
in other topics of which i have more depth of experience).   And for the <br/>
anyone else reading this...this is not to say i need to be an expert in <br/>
every area my kids show interest - far from it...but my curiosity has been <br/>
peaked and i am interested in learning for myself what i don&#39;t know.  Oh how <br/>
i do love all that unschooling brings into my life!!!  I&#39;m actually <br/>
interested in &quot;math&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

passions - since you are passionate about your kids, you&#39;re interested <br/>
in subjects that you otherwise might avoid. *I* never thought I&#39;d be <br/>
interested in computer games, until my kids wanted them....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813138477"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamsoroosh@...">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just worries me that sometimes people treat math stuff differently<br/>
&gt;than other stuff. &gt;<br/>
&gt;The problem with math, in particular, is that so many parents are,<br/>
&gt;themselves, overly anxious and sometimes even phobic about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So, I think most people might need to be just a smidgen on the lookout for<br/>
&gt;ways to support math learning in natural and fun ways. Supporting<br/>
&gt;other kinds of learning might come more naturally to the parents. If<br/>
&gt;parents are math-anxious, they&#39;ll avoid math and their kids will miss<br/>
&gt;out on the support that they could have had if the parents had been<br/>
&gt;more comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pam your response gave me much to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Discussion with my dh about math has always been a hot topic in our house.  <br/>
On a personal note, i don&#39;t consider myself math phobic or anxious...it&#39;s <br/>
more that i am math limited beyond the basics.  Math has never been an area <br/>
that has peaked my interest to explore beyond what i&#39;ve had to use in my <br/>
daily life.  Trusting that i am using advanced mathematical concepts, just <br/>
not aware of the labels or descriptions of such.  Introducing or recognizing <br/>
opportunities to incorporate challenging or advanced math information <br/>
doesn&#39;t come as naturally to me as introducing other areas that i do have <br/>
strong personal experience or interest.  This has been a concern of dh&#39;s.  <br/>
I&#39;ve always recognized the reality of our children being more heavily <br/>
exposed to what we as their parents have more knowledge and experience.  I <br/>
also know that when their interest reaches beyond mine in any area i help <br/>
them search out resources that will take them further than what my knowledge <br/>
base is...whether it be sciences, sewing or gymnastics - because they are <br/>
interested and i remain forever curious.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, whenever i read your posts to dh about math - he&#39;ll say - <br/>
that&#39;s easy for her to say, mathematically thinking is second nature to her, <br/>
not to us, how will our kids get exposed to this if we don&#39;t consciously put <br/>
it infront of them.  I&#39;ve been more relaxed about this than he would like me <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I think parents can go ahead and introduce fun math stuff into games<br/>
&gt;or art projects or in cooking or sewing or carpentry, etc., as long<br/>
&gt;as they&#39;re remembering that the point of a game is to have fun, the<br/>
&gt;point of art is to be creative, the point of cooking is to make good<br/>
&gt;food, and so on - the learning is incidental.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you just remember the basic unschooling principal of supporting<br/>
&gt;our kids&#39; interests by providing ways to do more, expand, add to,<br/>
&gt;make connections, etc., then if you&#39;re kid is interested in playing a<br/>
&gt;certain game, you&#39;ll naturally think of other similar games he might<br/>
&gt;enjoy, ways to expand the game, to relate it to other interests, to<br/>
&gt;add to it and modify it, and so on. Just like with any other<br/>
&gt;interest, except that there are lots of parents who simply won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think about adding to it in ways that involve mathematics because<br/>
&gt;they avoid math without even realizing they&#39;re doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilty, by lack of knowledge.  Time to hit the books!!!  I have some good <br/>
ones (fun ones) on our shelf.  Pam, you have once again tickled my <br/>
curiousity and stretched my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Much gratitude.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My question would be whose idea was it to modify the game and for what<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose?  I am wondering if your intention to match numbers is to<br/>
&gt; &gt; give the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game a new challenge because your child wants it, or is it because<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for an opportunity to practice math?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have found that an ulterior motive can take the joy out of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunity to practice math exists without having to superimpose<br/>
&gt; &gt; it on an<br/>
&gt; &gt; activity or game that young children enjoy simply because it is easily<br/>
&gt; &gt; mastered.  Of course if your child initiated this creative twist,<br/>
&gt; &gt; well then,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s an example of an unschooled life!<br/>
