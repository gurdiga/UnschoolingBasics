Hello to Unschooling Families Everywhere!<br/>
<br/>
Hi- I am Jen - unschooling mama to two always unschooled kids -and we are<br/>
expecting our third this fall.<br/>
My husband Chris and I (along with all the others who are helping to pull<br/>
this together!) are delighted to announce that 2nd annual Great Big Happy Life Unschoolers Conference Retreat is ON! <br/>
<br/>
June 7-10, 2010.<br/>
<br/>
This extraordinary gathering of unschooling families has a new home this<br/>
year- a gorgeous camp in West Milford NJ. The accommodations are perfect for<br/>
families as we will be taking over the building which holds the dining hall,<br/>
a fireplace, 3 sunny workrooms, a comfy loft with many couches and huge TV<br/>
and a beautiful wraparound deck for sitting and enjoying your morning. We<br/>
will enjoy private, simple, spotless dormitory style rooms.<br/>
<br/>
The camp has a beautiful lake and waterfront activities will be an option<br/>
for all of us to enjoy. <br/>
Imagine three nights on a beautiful campus with hiking trails, abundant<br/>
wildlife, simple & pleasant accommodations and 3 delicious catered family friendly meals prepared by our cherished caterer! <br/>
<br/>
The festivities begin on Monday afternoon with a welcome gathering and<br/>
snack. <br/>
We plan to offer massages by the minute on arrival day so that you can<br/>
completely feel like you are really away on vacation! <br/>
<br/>
We will, once again, host 8 minute dating for families Monday evening <br/>
(which everyone loved participating in!)- followed by delicious dinner and a<br/>
campfire. <br/>
<br/>
Tuesday and Wednesday will be a combination of planned and spontaneous<br/>
gatherings for kids and parents. There will be a 24 hour gaming room,<br/>
designated teen hangout, funshops on everything from firebuilding to Qi<br/>
Gong, unschooling lifeshops, discussion rings centered on peaceful<br/>
partnerships, chances to deepen your exploration of unschooling while<br/>
sharing meals and wide open spaces with other like-minded families, and<br/>
opportunities to ask questions as you absorb the joy, at least for a few<br/>
days, of living in a little Unschooling Village. <br/>
<br/>
There will be whole sections of the day for exploration and just being with<br/>
our families- sort of an unconference feel. This year we are emphasizing the<br/>
retreat experience of Great Big Happy Life- use this time as a chance to<br/>
both reignite your unschooling spirit and reconnect with yourself and your<br/>
children in a free and unbounded environment. Think of it as a chance to<br/>
take a really DEEP breath and EXHALE. Ahh...<br/>
<br/>
Great Big Happy Life would like to extend our joyful invitation to ALL<br/>
persons and families who would like to deepen their unschooling experience-<br/>
We strive to create a conference retreat that will embrace people of all<br/>
sizes, colors, ethnic backgrounds, religious/spiritual choices, sexual<br/>
orientations, genders, abilities and cultures. We also wish to extend an<br/>
invitation to all unschooling families- regardless of where you are on your<br/>
journey.<br/>
Our website is www.greatbighappylife.com and registration is open. We are<br/>
adding exciting things each day!<br/>
Our yahoo group is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJUC/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJUC/</a><br/>
<br/>
There is a deadline to register of May 1st, 2010, but if you want an indoor<br/>
room (vs tent camping), we suggest booking your accommodations before then because there are only 20 family rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you in June - It&#39;s A Great Big Happy Life!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer & Chris<br/>
