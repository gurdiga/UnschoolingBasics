<div id="ygrps-yiv-406079586">I&#39;ve actually met June!:)<br/>
You can call me if you need to June, and I&#39;ll walk you through...<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, NO, you do not need to do an eval. If the <br/>
district gives you heck, you just tell them you are registered with <br/>
a private school now.<br/>
You DO need to let the district know you are discontinuing your home <br/>
education program, they just need a letter signed with your names <br/>
and that you are no longer home educating.<br/>
If they do bug ya a bit after you tell them you&#39;re with a private <br/>
school, offer to mail them a copy of your registration form. (have <br/>
it notarized to make it more official). They have no say over you at <br/>
that point, but sometimes they try to make you think you have to do <br/>
an eval.<br/>
Their reasoning is that your child will not be promoted to the next <br/>
grade. Whooptedoo! You don&#39;t need grades anymore, of any kind!:)<br/>
<br/>
So the steps to take are<br/>
1) register with the private school<br/>
2) send a notice to the district that you have disconinued your home <br/>
education program<br/>
3) relax.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really, really worried about the CPS thing and want to do <br/>
an eval. anyway, I&#39;ll give you a couple names of unschool friendly <br/>
evaluators.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716197147">I am wondering if there is anyone experienced from Ohio who can give <br/>
me step-by-step guidance for unschooling notification, evaluations, <br/>
etc. OR info on the private school options for unschoolers in OH?<br/>

I have done research but feel like the more knowledge I have in this <br/>
area the more comfortable I will be...<br/>

Thanks, <br/>

Have you looked at Carol Narigons letter? It&#39;s at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>
I adjust this for us. I use a pretty generic list of books and suppilies.<br/>
Globe, library, etc. It&#39;s about the same every year. It&#39;s really quite<br/>
simple but I was quite nervious our first year or so. Assessments are a<br/>
matter of finding the right reveiwer. There are a few to choose from around<br/>
here. I use the box method. Throw stuff in a box through the year and take<br/>
it to the reveiwer with pictures and calandar too. LOL!<br/>
I guess this will be my intro too. LOL! I&#39;m Barb E obviously from Ohio.<br/>
Outside Columbus to be more exact. I have 3 boys. 18yo, 14yo, and soon to be<br/>
10yo. We&#39;ve been unschooling for eight years going on nine. Deschooling just<br/>
evolved into unschooling for us. I was fortunate enough to go to the last 2<br/>
unschooling conferences in SC. They were fabulous! Unfortunately we won&#39;t be<br/>
able to attend this year. We moved to a bigger and better<br/>
place/neighborhood. Money is very tight but we are much happier and safer. I<br/>
start working next week part time moving into fulltime in the fall.<br/>
Ds 14 wants to try out high school next year. I&#39;m gritting my teeth but it&#39;s<br/>
his choice and he knows he can come back home at any time. Oh and Melissa.<br/>
There isn&#39;t a private school option other than online schools. If you want<br/>
to call it that. I think you may have been thinking of an unbrella school.<br/>
You could pay big bucks for Clonlara but you still have that &quot;have to do&quot;<br/>
mentality. They take care of your assessment but you still notify the state<br/>
like everyone else that are homeschooling independently. Online schoolsare<br/>
public school at home in my opinion.<br/>
Feel free to contact me off list for more particulars. Oh and you may want<br/>
to look at different ways people have notified on the Inches list that url<br/>
is  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INCHESgroup/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INCHESgroup/</a><br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>
