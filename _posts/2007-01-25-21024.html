<div id="ygrps-yiv-351428096">Just wanted to share with everyone...<br/>
<br/>
A couple days ago, I checked out some library books for my two boys (5.5 and 4).  The <br/>
kids did not see the books, because I chose them while they were playing elsewhere in the <br/>
library.  Later that afternoon, I was reading them to the boys.  Whenever it was my 4 yo&#39;s <br/>
turn to chose a book, he would pick one with about 5 or 6 words on a page and we would <br/>
read it slowly, pointing to each word (his choice to do this). My 5 yo was getting a little <br/>
frustrated with our slow pace.  When I turned the page and my 4 yo was getting ready to <br/>
point to the words, my 5 yo just read the whole sentence before we could start! At first, I <br/>
just assumed he had memorized the book, but then I realized I just checked them out and <br/>
he had never seen the book before.  I turned to my 5yo and asked &quot;Can you read?&quot; and he <br/>
said, &quot;Yeah&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, how cool is that?! I KNEW it would be this way with him.  He won&#39;t just trot out his <br/>
knowledge or &quot;perform&quot; for anyone. He&#39;ll let you know things in HIS way, in HIS time.  He&#39;ll <br/>
probably be doing high school level sciene experiements under his bed at night, and I&#39;ll <br/>
never know it!<br/>
<br/>
And what perfect timing!  My dh admitted to me after I told him this story that he was <br/>
getting ready to have a talk with me about the whole homeschooling/unschooling thing <br/>
and that it didn&#39;t seem to be working!<br/>

<br/>
In The Netherlands, 4 and 5yos go to kindergarten and just do games and<br/>
stuff that prepares them for school. Kids don&#39;t learn to read until<br/>
they&#39;re 6yo. I was quite surprised the first time my HB told me that<br/>
kids in the USA learn to read at 5yo; I&#39;d never thought about things<br/>
before and assumed that &quot;learning to read at 6yo&quot; was just a kind of<br/>
universal rule (I know kids that taught themselves to read at 3 or 4yo<br/>
and such, but school-wise, I thought 6yo was normal throughout the<br/>
world). And, judging by how well Dutch teenagers read vs American<br/>
teenagers, I&#39;d say waiting till 6yo didn&#39;t hurt a bit!<br/>
<br/>
Just like I didn&#39;t start learning English until I was 12yo, and my<br/>
English seems to have turned out fine. Personally, I have the<br/>
impression that learning foreign languages actually gets easier the<br/>
older you are, it just may *seem* harder, and you&#39;re more likely to<br/>
have a foreign accent. <br/>
<br/>
Thought I&#39;d mention all this for people that are worried that their kid<br/>
isn&#39;t able to do x yet at age y, even though American kids normally<br/>
learn x at age (y-1) or (y-2). <br/>

of mathematical operations (simple addition and subtraction) children are<br/>
limited to numbers 0-10 or 20 in pre-k and 0-30 in kindergarten. In grade<br/>

weren&#39;t supposed to do any addition or subtraction until first grade<br/>
(6yo). In kindergarten we did do counting stuff and such, but no<br/>
addition/subtraction. In first grade, we started out with numbers under<br/>
ten, then under twenty, and then under a hundred, so that at the end of<br/>
first grade we were (I guess) at the same level as American kids. Then,<br/>
in second grade we started doing multiplication as well at some point<br/>
(I&#39;m not sure whether at the beginning of second grade or half-way<br/>
through the year). In 7th grade we started algebra, in 9th grade<br/>
trigonometry and such, and half-way through 10th grade calculus,<br/>
although we split secondary school up in different streams depending on<br/>
kids academic abilities, so if you weren&#39;t so smart, you wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
much beyond algebra and basic trig, stat & geometry (and graduate after<br/>
10th grade, rather than 12th). I also had what pretty much was the<br/>
equivalent of college statistics in highschool, I think mainly in 11th<br/>
grade, but I&#39;m not sure. That and geometry, which I disliked because of<br/>
all the proofs we had to do. A major difference between what I had and<br/>
the American system though is that the only subject that I ever had was<br/>
&quot;Math&quot;, whereas here they split it up in the subareas. I didn&#39;t even<br/>
know what &#39;calculus&#39; meant until I came to the US, even though I&#39;d had<br/>
it for 3.5 years in highschool (I had to do 11th grade twice due to<br/>
illness). Oh, and the one thing we did NOT cover that is covered in<br/>
American schools is imaginary numbers. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969031508">You know, since I&#39;ve been studying up on unschooling (my children are still<br/>
young at 1 and 2 1/2 for me to worry about it yet), I&#39;ve been seeing growing<br/>
inconsistencies in my own job. Montessori has some of the same philosophies<br/>
but the environment is really controlled.<br/>
<br/>
The Arab world is so obsessed with memorizing and getting top grades that if<br/>
an Arab were homeschooled, it would be a &quot;cultural trajedy&quot; lol...it took a<br/>
while but I&#39;m proud that my Egyptian husband has been convinced of<br/>
homeschooling...now I just have to convince himm of the unschooling concept.<br/>
I&#39;m self-taugh in English which is a good start (I was sent to French<br/>
school). Anyhow, if you think the West has forgotten how to learn, the Arab<br/>
world is worse. They have everything commited to memory for the exam and<br/>
conveniently forget it afterward. At least the public schools in Canada<br/>
taught me some things--although not much.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone on this list in Alberta? I want to know how they deal with the<br/>
school boards when unschooling is used as the main curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107088779">Imaginary numbers?<br/>
<br/>
I remember starting multiplication in grade three (graduated HS in 95).<br/>
Never got to Calculus though in Quebec, we get up to grade 11, not 12.<br/>
ALgebra was started in grade 8.<br/>
<br/>
I know that in the International schools, multiplications are started in<br/>
Grade 1. In Montessori, if the kid gets that far (which is rare in a<br/>
second-language setting, he might get into skip-counting and multiplication.<br/>
I think that out if the 80 preschoolers in our school, one or two have<br/>
gotten that far this year.<br/>

I hated ath as a kid and still hate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762998679">I can&#39;t really speak to what&#39;s being taught wrt &#39;math&#39; in schools, <br/>
but I&#39;d recommend *How Children Fail* by John Holt if the subject <br/>
interests you. Its out of print, but libraries still have it. He was <br/>
teaching math at the time, so most of his stories and examples are <br/>
on that topic. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the discoveries/conclusions he comes to are things I&#39;ve <br/>
observed with younger children who are learning math orgainically - <br/>
mainly that the sequential learning model used by most schools has <br/>
little to do with the way children actually learn about numbers and <br/>
relationships. Young children can conceptualize division/fractions <br/>
long before subtraction, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Just talking about numbers with my 5yr old, I&#39;m often astonished at <br/>
how many different &quot;concepts&quot; she&#39;ll be considering simultaneously. <br/>
One of her games is to tell me numbers and have me write them down, <br/>
or vice-versa and I&#39;ll see her counting variously by ones, tens and <br/>
hundreds, playing with the idea of place-value, and comparing <br/>
numbers to time and money notation - all within just a few minutes. <br/>
It really lets me see how contrived is so much math-teaching - <br/>
especially when she suddenly segues into making puns. I&#39;m not <br/>
entirely sure *how* that relates - something to do with patterns I <br/>
suppose - but its a pretty common connection for her. <br/>

I found this fascinating. I don&#39;t know if I ever learned this stuff;<br/>
but it sure requires one&#39;s imagination to try to understand it. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I liked this one titled &quot;unlearning&quot; regarding &quot;Spacetime Algebra&quot;<br/>

LOL - I really like numbers (even imaginary ones). I think that&#39;s part<br/>
of the &quot;puzzle&quot; if you will - I had lots of teachers who delighted in<br/>
numbers, not &quot;math&quot;, the kind who did what the text required then showed<br/>
us the patterns and shortcuts and such. DH also likes playing with<br/>
numbers and patterns, despite failing a semester of high school &#39;math&#39;<br/>
and all. Would you believe that we&#39;d actually lie awake in bed at night<br/>
in the dark discussing square roots and imaginary numbers and area<br/>
calculations and all that kind of stuff, just for the fun of it. It was<br/>
just a tangent from a conversation and would wind it&#39;s merry way along<br/>
until we fell asleep.<br/>
