<div id="ygrps-yiv-457153583">Many of you have probably heard of this book, &quot;Your Competent Child&quot; <br/>
by Jesper Juul.  I just re-read it and it really struck me how it <br/>
was related to the things we are discussing right now on this list.  <br/>
I highly recommend it! It is an eye opening book! <br/>
You can get it from Amazon.com and I also saw a few copies on ebay <br/>
for cheap.  Here is the website for more info on the book:<br/>
