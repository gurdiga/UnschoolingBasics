<div id="ygrps-yiv-873911381">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Tawnya and I live in Ventura, CA. My husband, James, and I <br/>
have three boys who are 8, 4 and almost 2.  I joined this list to see <br/>
what &quot;real unschoolers&quot; do.  I am finding out more and more that <br/>
unschooling is a lifestyle rather than a type of education.  I <br/>
*think* I am an unschooler at heart who doesn&#39;t know how to get <br/>
there....but then I read some stuff here and think it may be way <br/>
outside of my box...but then I began to question my box...and when I <br/>
question my box, I begin to doubt that what I am currently doing <br/>
is &quot;working&quot;...and that always leads me back to my inclination to <br/>
take the plunge and unschool.  It&#39;s like someone gave this mouse a <br/>
cookie!  Anyway, only my 8 year old has been *officially* exposed <br/>
to &quot;academics&quot; as we have enrolled in a ISP charter school a couple <br/>
of times (one of them currently) and I have had him do &quot;schoolwork&quot; <br/>
to suffice their requirements.  I seem to be in a cycle that&#39;s just <br/>
not working for any of us.  I am also starting to see how making the <br/>
choice to use a charter school and jump through their hoops, because <br/>
they will cover the expense of some of the things he is really <br/>
interested in, is changing the choices we make for our family!  We <br/>
have always wanted a big family, but now I question whether or not I <br/>
should plan another baby when I already have a hard time keeping up <br/>
with &quot;school&quot;..ugh!  I am not sure if this was a question or a vent, <br/>
but thanks for discussing and allowing me to read and learn.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578955859">Hi Tawnya<br/>
<br/>
Yup, once you question whether typical &#39;schooling&#39; is necessary, then <br/>
you start question all the other conventional &#39;wisdom&#39; - all <br/>
the &quot;have to&quot; stuff laying around in your head, both for you and for <br/>
your kids. Kids &quot;have to&quot; x and Moms &quot;have to&quot; y and so on. Dishes, <br/>
vaccines, bedtimes, bathing, media, on and on it goes. Chipping away <br/>
little by little at the pre-conceived notions and arriving at those <br/>
things that you really truly think are important for your own self - <br/>
which may not carry over into things that are important for your <br/>
kids. A useful question is Why? &quot;I&#39;m doing or asking for or expecting <br/>
B. Why?&quot; Or, &quot;My child wants to Q. Why not?&quot; There may be real <br/>
reasons why or why not - we don&#39;t have the money for that right now, <br/>
it&#39;s 24 degrees outside so going outside in a swimsuit only could be <br/>
a problem, etc. But it doesn&#39;t stop there. It leads to &quot;how&quot; - how <br/>
can this need/want be met, what is the root of it, what are our <br/>
options (if you can&#39;t think of at least 2 options for just about <br/>
anything, think some more) Okay so it&#39;s 24 degrees outside and a <br/>
bathing suit just isn&#39;t going to cut it. We could wear bathing suits <br/>
underneath our jackets and sweat pants. We could wear bathing suits <br/>
in the house and have a picnic in the living room like we do at the <br/>
beach. We could wear bathing suits in the tub and play. There&#39;s 3 and <br/>
there are probably more as well.<br/>
<br/>
You might try, for yourself, to define what constitutes &quot;working&quot;. In <br/>
the conventional sense, what &quot;works&quot; is what makes the kids <br/>
conveniently manageable for the adults. The kids obey the adults <br/>
without a question; they go to bed when the adults say to, eat when <br/>
the adults prepare food, eat what the adults prepare, do the <br/>
household tasks the adults assign when they are told to, and so on. <br/>
If it&#39;s not &#39;working&#39;, there&#39;s usually a &#39;carrot/stick&#39; plan <br/>
implemented &quot;do x and you get y, or else you get z&quot; still based on <br/>
the adult&#39;s point of view and set of priorities. A change of view <br/>
might say that what &#39;works&#39; is that which meets the needs/priorities <br/>
of the family as a whole, kids included (and maybe especially since <br/>
they start out &#39;behind&#39; in terms of access to resources). Often, it <br/>
is not as convenient for the adults. However, in the big picture, the <br/>
long run, the whole enchilada, it seems to me (with my 10 yr old and <br/>
seeing/knowing the older teens of others) that a smaller <br/>
inconvenience with a 6 yr old ends up with something that <br/>
is &quot;working&quot; better when that 6 yr old is 16.<br/>
