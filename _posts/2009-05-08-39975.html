<div id="ygrps-yiv-746946233">I have never needed one for anything I have wished to pursue in my life.<br/>
If one were to find it necessary to follow a dream it is very easy to  <br/>
obtain a GED or to make a resume based on life experience that  <br/>
superceeds the need.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is important unless you decide that it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329183105">I don&#39;t think that any degree or diploma is &quot;necessary&quot; per se, but it all depends on what the children want to do in their lives. I have one son who wants to learn martial arts and open his own dojo - no diploma or degree required. I have another who wants to build the first flying car - depending on how he chooses to pursue that, he may need to go to college and pursue an engineering degree. Of course, my dojo son could pursue a degree if he chooses, regardless of his career; and my flying car son could choose not to pursue a degree and gain the knowledge that he&#39;ll need in a different way. The point is that a HS diploma is not, for the most part, a requirement for a job or for college these days. I think most people pursue diploma and degree as a matter of course, in the hopes that they may eventually be able to turn their education into some sort of career; in our home, we hope our children will find their passions and then decide whether or not<br/>
 college will help them achieve their dream.   <br/>

My oldest child (now 19) is attending college this fall and never got any kind of diploma. The community college he&#39;s attending just wanted a transcript...easy enough to make up one of those.<br/>
<br/>
I would print out a diploma of my own if my child needed it for some reason. I think a lot of certificates/diplomas/degrees are just overrated nonsense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>******I think a high school degree is just another tool for the toolbox.  If someone feels they need a degree to reach a goal then they may choose to do that. I honestly can&#39;t think of anything a &quot;high school&quot; degree would be useful for. &lt;g&gt; I sure there is something, but a college degree could be useful for many things.  <br/>
