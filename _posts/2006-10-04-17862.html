<div id="ygrps-yiv-24852763">Speaking of annoying – I have a new question :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have often read here in the list and on unschooling weblogs, that  <br/>
sometimes a &quot;no&quot; is ok. I imagine that a no to an always unschooled  <br/>
or long time unschooled child is no big deal and is probably more  <br/>
accepted than a no, even a respectful one, to a schooled child. I&#39;m  <br/>
talking about realy natural limits.<br/>
<br/>
The topics were things like siblings fighting and being very  <br/>
disrespectful/unfriendly; hitting siblings or pets. Often have I read  <br/>
that it was ok to say &quot;I will not let you treat me like that&quot;, &quot;I  <br/>
will not let anybody speak to me/her like that&quot; or &quot;I will not let  <br/>
you hurt him/her/it&quot; or something like that. But I wonder how do you  <br/>
enforce that then? (In case they continue?) What do you do if they  <br/>
still do it? How do you &quot;not let&quot; them? Do I go away? Do I take the  <br/>
kid away from the pet? Do I take the pet? Do I raise my voice?<br/>
<br/>
I said it once to my daughter when because of &quot;nothing&quot; she was  <br/>
yelling at me and being very very unfriendly. I calmly said I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let her treat me that way; but also tried to find out what  <br/>
the &quot;nothing&quot; was and we found out. I still wondered though what I  <br/>
would have done to &quot;not let&quot; her if she had continued. I scratched my  <br/>
head and hoped she wouldn&#39;t :-)<br/>
<br/>
When we first started unschooling/gentle parenting, she seemed so  <br/>
extremely happy about her freedom, she seemed so grateful that she  <br/>
was really very friendly all of the sudden, she would help with  <br/>
everything and was saying thank you and all kinds of nice things all  <br/>
day. Now she&#39;s getting more and more unfriendly and demanding,  <br/>
disrespectful, if something doesn&#39;t work she&#39;ll yell and be angry and  <br/>
blame you and even though I try to help her she is already extremely  <br/>
unfriendly and yells at me. I sure think there is a reason and mostly  <br/>
we have figured out what the real problem was. I still have  <br/>
difficulties to deal with this unfriendlyness because it makes me  <br/>
feel angry after a while (when it has happened a lot during the day),  <br/>
and then it&#39;s hard to stay calm. So I tried the &quot;I won&#39;t let you...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would apreciate any ideas on how to deal with this better,  <br/>
practical advice on what one could say instead. Btw, it&#39;s not that I  <br/>
yell when I can&#39;t controle it, but I just say nothing and feel like  <br/>
crap for being treated that way and not knowing how to handle the  <br/>
situation. I feel that just letting her do it is not ok.<br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes she&#39;ll say something that isn&#39;t true. She&#39;s sure it  <br/>
is how she&#39;s saying it but I KNOW she just wasn&#39;t attentive at the  <br/>
time and I&#39;m 1000000% sure it&#39;s how I&#39;m saying it. Sometimes there  <br/>
are even other people around who prove and assure it was how we are  <br/>
saying it, but she will never comply. We have no idea how to deal  <br/>
with this. Is it ok to let her in her belief she was right?? She  <br/>
never accepts that she was wrong! She doesn&#39;t accept a &quot;Well  <br/>
obviously there was a misunderstanding and we will never know&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902457209">I remember feeling very defensive as a child when I was in this situation.<br/>
I felt attacked. It sounds like she might feel the same way. How are you<br/>
wording it? It sounds to me like you want to *win* the argument as much as<br/>
she does. Could it be more of a debate than a conversation? The way we<br/>
approach people (children and adults) makes a huge difference. How about,<br/>
&quot;Well, I understood it to be....&quot; or &quot;Oh, I thought it was.......&quot; or &quot;I<br/>
remember it differently.....&quot;? In a tone that is more conversational instead<br/>
of confrontational. Instead of being angry and defensive she will be<br/>
listening to what you&#39;re saying. This might make it feel safer for her to<br/>
concede your point. Our first reaction when we feel threatened is to fight<br/>
back. Even if she sees your point she doesn&#39;t want to *loose*. <br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
