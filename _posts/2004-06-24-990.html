<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318601054">First of all alittle background so you all can understand what I&#39;m talking  <br/>
about!<br/>
  We have 10 acres of land.  My DH works a lot of hours to make  up for my <br/>
not working (out of the house that is)!  We have 5 horses, lots  of chickens, <br/>
cats, a dog, turtles, a cow and a now nonresident 4 ft snake that  they found <br/>
under a board yesterday.  He is happily alive down the road AWAY  from my house!<br/>
  Anyway, we need our boys help.  10 acres might not seem like a  lot, but <br/>
when there are things to be done, it has to be done.  And some  nights ds11 just <br/>
does not want to do anything to help anyone.   On the  other hand ds6 shadows <br/>
his dad!  The fact that Kaleb won&#39;t help upsets my  husband, around here, <br/>
kids are expected to work.  That is not my  opinion.  When DH is at work, I don&#39;t <br/>
force the boys to do anything.   I might ask, but if they aren&#39;t up to it, <br/>
then fine.  But DH on the other  hand, tells them they have to help, and it is <br/>
getting to be really hard on me to  have to watch this go on.  Its not like it <br/>
happens every single day, and  he&#39;s not mean or abusive, but he&#39;s going <br/>
against what I am doing here.  I  talked to him about unschooling these guys almost <br/>
a year ago when we decided  this was going to be the way to go.  I TRY to <br/>
initiate conversations on how  unschooling works, and either he just isnt&#39; <br/>
interested or he&#39;s leaving it all up  to me, either way, as long as he doesn&#39;t need <br/>
their help he is very supportive  (even though he appears to be clueless)!  <br/>
He&#39;s a very gentle man, I have to  say that for him.  A wonderful father too.  <br/>
But I hate to see Kaleb  cry when he has to go out and work.   I don&#39;t even know <br/>
what question  to ask.  So I&#39;ll leave it at HELP!<br/>
thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422162154">Our family tries to make unschooling a journey for all of us.  If our<br/>
children help us around the house, we have more time to give them the<br/>
attention they want and need.  My husband works all day outside of the home.<br/>
I have a chronic illness, so we need our children&#39;s help.  We do not expect<br/>
a lot, but we are asking for mutual respect and picking up after themselves.<br/>
We all need to be encouraged by helping each other.  We all need some<br/>
nurturing in our relationships, both adults and children.  If my husband<br/>
works all day and then does everything around the house it would be unfair<br/>
to him and I think he would become very tired and discouraged, maybe even<br/>
depressed.<br/>
<br/>
We own ten acres of land and have many pets.  We require our children to<br/>
feed and care for the pets because the consequence would be traumatic, not a<br/>
learning process.  They know that their father works all day to provide for<br/>
them and does not have time to do everything without some help.  The<br/>
children do have a choice to find homes for the animals if they do not want<br/>
to care for them.  We do help them with chores if they ask for our help.<br/>
<br/>
My mother grew-up here and she had some chickens when she was a child.  For<br/>
whatever reason, she did not feed them and the adults thought she would<br/>
learn responsibility from the experience.  The chicks died and my mother did<br/>
not learn anything really, but the sadness of the event stuck with her for<br/>
her entire life.<br/>
<br/>
Something&#39;s just need to be done, but it is good to help children feel a<br/>
since of co-operation, mutual respect and some choices in the matter.  Maybe<br/>
if your son could choose from a list of chores or choose to get it done<br/>
before dad gets home, maybe a race against time or as a surprise for his<br/>
father.  I wonder why he cries?  Is he afraid, confused or frustrated?<br/>
Could you go out with them and make it a fun family affair?<br/>
<br/>
I read a book about five love languages (words of affirmation, physical<br/>
touch, quality time, acts of service, and gifts).<br/>
Maybe one child enjoys the quality time with dad while the other child does<br/>
not feel that his needs are being met.<br/>
<br/>
We have spent a lot of time with two Amish families.  Children start helping<br/>
out as soon as they can walk.  It is amazing how the children co-operate<br/>
because they are included in the work.  The parents use love, direction and<br/>
constant attention, but I never see them punished or forced to work.  The<br/>
children seem to know there part in the family and help out willingly.<br/>
<br/>
We request our children&#39;s help and do not demand it.  Sometimes they just<br/>
need a little time and then they are willing help out.  Their rooms and<br/>
their laundry is up to them, they deal with those things when they see fit.<br/>
The pets are non-negotiable, because they are dependents.  My son cooks<br/>
because he wants to be a chef.  We never force him to cook, but fortunately<br/>
he loves it and won&#39;t let me in the kitchen, because that is his space.  We<br/>
are very blessed to have a child that loves to cook and is very gifted it<br/>
that area.  Is there something your son would enjoy doing to help, so it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem like work?</div>

<br/>
Yes, he loves to cook too!  Woke up to eggs and toast already  made this <br/>
morning!  He does seem to be taking over my kitchen, like you son  has.  And if he <br/>
does, I won&#39;t mind a bit!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I haven&#39;t gotten throught the whole thread yet, so if someone has said <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this already, please ignore. We go through bouts of this in our home. Our kids <br/>
are up late too and dh is the only one with an actual schedule who has to go to <br/>
work. I think it is difficult for him to be the one on the schedule and not <br/>
get down time (or cave time as it&#39;s called in the Mars/Venus books)&lt;&lt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***LOL, I love the term &quot;cave time&quot;. I have to agree with you. I&#39;m sure it <br/>
would be frustrating to get up really early, go to work all day, and (possibly) <br/>
come home to someone (or your whole family!!!? huh???!!!) not being respectful <br/>
of that alone time or your sleep time, etc.?! Wow, how unkind! I wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
that to my dh or my kids and he, would never do that to us. That would just <br/>
not be cool to do to someone that you love and respect. Being that this is a <br/>
&quot;family&quot; (including dh) and we are trying to respect each other in this family, <br/>
our dd&#39;s wouldn&#39;t want to do that to their Dad either! ****<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; His frustration may really mean he wants more time with you. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**** That&#39;s probably got a lot to do with it. But, is there ever that much <br/>
alone time when your kids are young?! :o) Unschooling or not, when kids are <br/>
young, they are busy and in need! :o) I know when our kids were younger (they are <br/>
11& 12 at home & 21 on his own now) having some nice alone time (or a decent <br/>
nights sleep for that matter!) was easier said than done! But we both needed <br/>
that time, it was and still is a mutual thing. &lt;g!&gt; We love down time/alone time <br/>
around here and our kids are aware of that, (they like it too) but, not b/c <br/>
we *tell* them, &quot;HEY, WE WANT ALONE/DOWN TIME!&quot;. It&#39;s b/c they just *know* from <br/>
growing within the family. We each enjoy time as a family, alone time, and <br/>
(for dh and I) time as a couple. Heck, the girls like time alone with each other <br/>
too. It&#39;s all a part of life for us and the girls don&#39;t know any other way. <br/>
It&#39;s just normal, not a *fight* or *argument* to *get* alone time or sleep time <br/>
for that matter! (ick! that would suck if I felt I had to argue or complain <br/>
for a good nights sleep, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
We have always loved when the girls come in our room and chill out with us. <br/>
(they were just in there with us last night and one ended up crashing on the <br/>
floor pillows) BUT, they LOVE to chill out in their own rooms also, a lot of <br/>
times alone so they can *relate* to what &quot;alone time&quot;, &quot;down time&quot; or &quot;sleep <br/>
time&quot; means for a person. <br/>
I guess you just have to work at all this &quot;being a family business&quot; one day <br/>
at a time and try to grow towards a common ground for everyone concerned. Some <br/>
good things just take time. ****<br/>
