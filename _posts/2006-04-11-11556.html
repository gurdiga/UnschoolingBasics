 </span></blockquote>Mine do.  My oldest child had the most loving and wonderful teachers for<br/>
K-2nd grades.  Had she continued to have teachers like that she probably<br/>
would still be in school as I wouldn&#39;t have been motivated to move towards<br/>
homeschooling.  They were seriously wonderful!  They allowed her to move at<br/>
her own pace (which was ahead of everyone else) read what she wanted,<br/>
create, move, and play at learning.  Yes; still highly structured in<br/>
comparison to what her days are like now, but these two women were some of<br/>
the most wonderful examples of what teachers can be.  Emily&#39;s second grade<br/>
teacher was also one of my biggest supporters when we pulled her out the<br/>
next year!  Usually when my kids play school, Emily becomes Mrs. McGuire,<br/>
the kindly teacher who has a rocking chair and reads stories to her<br/>
&quot;class.&quot;   They draw on their experiences.  I&#39;m glad that Emily doesn&#39;t turn<br/>
into her horrid third grade teacher who was very restrictive, never smiled<br/>
and a complete authoritarian!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157547344">Mine did quite consistently for a while, they haven&#39;t in a few  <br/>
months. Now they are much more interested in playing &quot;Bill and Tom&quot;  <br/>
which are two soft body dolls that do fun and assorted things. They  <br/>
imagine, make fun, write books (well, emily writes and rachel  <br/>
illustrates)<br/>
They always played as a fair but scheduled teacher. They both had  <br/>
good teachers in the years they went to school, and probably pulling  <br/>
them out before they got to the mean teachers was a good thing.<br/>

Wow that is interesting.......the most unique i have is  Jonathon.......and <br/>
that is because I didn&#39;t realize I was spelling his name  wrong.  I also have a <br/>
Jake and Joseph which are easy to spell.   Jared on the other hand has many <br/>
spellings.......so it gets spelled incorrectly  often......LOL.....oh well. <br/>
that&#39;s life<br/>
