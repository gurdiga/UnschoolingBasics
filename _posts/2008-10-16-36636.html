<div id="ygrps-yiv-621313403">Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I rarely post and mostly lurk so I will quickly introduce myself.  <br/>
I&#39;m Lynda, mom to 2 always unschooled daughters who are 11 and 8.  We <br/>
live in Southern Oregon.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has asked me to put the word out for her.  She is <br/>
looking for online friends.  People to hang out with on Club Penguin <br/>
and Toontown or any other safe place that might be suggested.  If <br/>
anyone has kids who would be interested in exchanging email addys <br/>
with her that would be great.  I am really hoping to attend the Life <br/>
is Good conference next spring so it would be fabulous if she could <br/>
maybe build some online friendships with people she might actually <br/>
get to meet.  She doesn&#39;t have IM at this time but I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
help her set something up when the need arises.  Any other <br/>
suggestions anyone has as to how to help her get what she is looking <br/>
for (online friends that she can actually chat with without all the <br/>
restrictions club penguin and the like have due to safety) would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.  We are open to all ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if there are any hidden Southern Oregonians out there speak <br/>
up.   We have had a very hard time finding any other un schoolers <br/>
here to hang out with.  <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to mail me offlist and thanks in advance for any help <br/>
anyone can give.  <br/>
<br/>

PS...I was having trouble posting this so if other unfinished posts <br/>
came through, my apologies</div>
