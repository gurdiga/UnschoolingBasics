<div id="ygrps-yiv-416921982">Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t help you with finding friends in CA, but I&#39;m heading to Sedona<br/>
on Friday, to spend a week&#39;s vacation with extended family.  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if you have any kid-friendly places you might recommend?<br/>
I have a 9 yr old girl & a 12 yr old boy.  I&#39;m afraid my son won&#39;t know what<br/>
to do with himself without his<br/>
Xbox LOL.  Is Slide Rock going to be warm enough at this time of year?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886293655">It got cold here last weekend but it is warming up. I think it may <br/>
still be too cold for slide rock but anywhere along the river will be <br/>
nice for hiking around. My son is also a gamer but loves to go to the <br/>
trout farm and fish. It can get pricey, you have to pay for the fish <br/>
you catch and can&#39;t catch and release, but its a blast for the kids <br/>
and exciting as you can see them. There is also Page Springs Hatchery <br/>
which is neat to visit. Take a drive up the canyon toward Flag and <br/>
you can stop along the river and hike down along it, that&#39;s always <br/>
nice. My homeschooling (mostly unschooling) group meets at Sunset <br/>
Parker on Thursdays starting at 11:00. Kids are ages 5 up to 13. Its <br/>
casual and fun. Turn east at the Walgreens on Sunset and go just a <br/>
little ways, you&#39;ll see the park on your right. Feel free to join us <br/>
and get some more ideas from others there.<br/>

&gt; I have a 8 1/2-yr old son who I have been unschooling for a little over<br/>
&gt; a year now. We are moving to Arroyo Grande soon and the hardest thing<br/>
&gt; is leaving all of the great friendships we&#39;ve developed here in Sedona.<br/>
&gt; We are hoping to find some homeschoolers there that we can interact and<br/>
&gt; have fun with. If anyone is out there and interested in getting<br/>
&gt; together, please let us know. Its seems to be his one and only real<br/>
&gt; concern about moving, other than that, we are all very excited about<br/>
&gt; our big change from the mountains to the beach! You can email me<br/>
&gt; directly or feel free to call me at 928-202-6119.<br/>

Welcome&gt; (almost)to the Central Coast! There are some homeschooling groups online for&gt; that area I think. If you are interested, let me know. I think if you search&gt; on yahoo for central coast homeschoolers it will come up?&gt; &gt; Kelli Johnston&gt; &gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; [mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On Behalf Of holistic_living&gt; Sent: Monday, May 26, 2008 6:12 PM&gt; To: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Any unschoolers near SLO, CA?&gt; &gt; I have a 8 1/2-yr old son who I have been unschooling for a little over&gt; a year now.
