Thanksgiving<br/>
There really is a TRUE Thanksgiving story of Plymouth Plantation. <br/>
But I strongly suggest that there always has been a Thanksgiving <br/>
story of some kind or other for as long as there have been human <br/>
beings. There was also a &quot;First&quot; Thanksgiving in America, but it was <br/>
celebrated thirty thousand years ago. At some time during the New <br/>
Stone Age (beginning about ten thousand years ago) Thanksgiving <br/>
became associated with giving thanks to God for the harvests of the <br/>
land. Thanksgiving has always been a time of people coming together, <br/>
so thanks has also been offered for that gift of fellowship between <br/>
us all. Every last Thursday in November we now partake in one of the <br/>
OLDEST and most UNIVERSAL of human celebrations, and THERE ARE MANY <br/>
THANKSGIVING STORIES TO TELL.<br/>
