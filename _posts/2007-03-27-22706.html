<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008011366">Wow, I tried to read all the post on Christian values, there was a lot of <br/>
back and forth, I lost track.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think that unschooling basics has a key word, BASICS. And I would <br/>
guess that anyone and everyone on this list is effected by their basic <br/>
beliefs. If I have a Christian worldview, I might consider the Bible as part <br/>
of the basics. Or another religious book might equally effect my unschool if <br/>
I have belief in it.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a basic issue, if you have a belief system, it is probably <br/>
the foundation for you in your schooling choice. Or is it? So how do you <br/>
share your beliefs with your children and unschool? Or does unschooling <br/>
imply that you don&#39;t set out to teach your children about your beliefs <br/>
unless they desire that knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
I see this come up often on various unschool groups. If your a moderator, <br/>
governing the group is expected at some level. Often people unknowingly <br/>
assume that unschool equals no rules.<br/>
<br/>
The Summerhill school is part of my recent studies. This school allows <br/>
nudity, profanity and cursing at any age, admittance is at about age 6-9. <br/>
The entire school is part of the government.<br/>
<br/>
There is almost a sense that an unschool group shouldn&#39;t have moderation.<br/>
<br/>
I would be curious to hear some responses to the questions above about <br/>
belief.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>

  In this case, it&#39;s meant to be the basics of unschooling -- not how to unschool the &#39;basics&#39; of education.  Very different meaning, IMO.<br/>

   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  We share our beliefs/values by example, sharing info and answering questions as we go along in life with our kids.  We&#39;&#39;ve had many discussions with our boys about topics from politics to my beliefs about God/dess &lt;g&gt; and spirituality, ethnic relations and differences (kinda hard to avoid in a multi-ethnic home), breastfeeding, vaccines,  as well animal cruelty, vegetariansim, animal testing, history, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  However, we&#39;re not heavily invested in what beliefs the kids embrace themselves.  If our boys embrace a different religion from any we&#39;ve known or practiced ourselves -- Gary is a lapsed Methodist, I&#39;m all over the map, having spent 15 yrs as a Christian -- that&#39;s perfectly okay with us.  If they grow to be Republicans, that may be a challenge for me. &lt;g&gt; Of if I&#39;m someday dealing with a daughter-in-law who circumcises, vaccinates, bottle-feeds and packs my grandchildren off to daycare at 6 wks, my head might explode &lt;weg&gt;.  But, since my guiding principle is that my children live the the path that&#39;s right for them, I&#39;d manage to be adult about it all.  <br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I can&#39;t imagine how these topics don&#39;t come up for regular discussion in a home where parents and children are engaged in living a life together.  Of course, they&#39;ll hear me say what I think about a particular event or subject -- whether or not they ask -- but what I believe is only my opinion.  I encourage my children to form their own opinions, and help them research as needed. <br/>

   <br/>
  More a philosophy of guiding principles than rules.  Rules are rigid, and as we so often hear &#39;made to be broken.&#39;  I&#39;ve also found that rules only give way to more rules, and before the rules of a household can start to look like the stuff churned out by Congress. <br/>
   <br/>
  Principles are powerful enough that only a few are required, and they&#39;ll serve a multitude of situations.  Be kind and respectful covers everything from conversation, to being careful with others&#39; belongings, to waiting your turn in a game, to fairness.  Or treat people the way you want to be treated -- there&#39;s not much that won&#39;t apply to.  <br/>

  How is profanity different from cursing, or did you mean something else?  Personally, I have no problem with hearing kids curse (currently, Dan&#39;s favorite phrase is &quot;what the hell?&quot;  I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not WTF)  and I would think nudity -- especially if practiced in the spirit of respect for others -- would be pretty self-policing.  Either you wear clothes or you don&#39;t, and be kind to those who made the other choice from yours.  Not rocket science, IMO.<br/>

<br/>
LOL!  thanks for saying that.  those thoughts keep me awake at night -<br/>
republican, steak-eating, hateful-religious kids who live in cookie-cutter<br/>
houses in suburbia, have their babies under sedation, bottle-feed,<br/>
circumcise, mainstream-medical, consumerist lifestyles, public school, never<br/>
read a book, drive a hummer, sit in front of the tv during every spare<br/>
minute, and favorite pasttime is watching wrestling.  you know, the people<br/>
that my husband and i used to be, since every generation is a backlash of<br/>
the one before.  sigh.  i try to say that i will be accepting of whatever<br/>
path they choose but, let&#39;s be honest.  don&#39;t we really want them to be just<br/>
like us?  :)<br/>
<br/>
our kids are very young, but our &quot;beliefs,&quot; as they are, are instilled very<br/>
deeply in our daily life, so as with anything else, we expect our kids to<br/>
assimilate it by osmosis because it&#39;s not so much what we do as who we are.<br/>
by that same token, if i don&#39;t relish the thought of my kids doing<br/>
something, i don&#39;t do it myself.  so i eat healthy food and try to watch my<br/>
language, because i feel it would hypocritical of me to eat junk but then<br/>
get frustrated when they won&#39;t eat veggies, or swear at home but expect them<br/>
to keep it to themselves.  as for nudity, well, we have a clothing-optional<br/>
home.  :)  we&#39;re very comfortable with nudity and i hope to maintain that<br/>
innocence of enjoying their naked bodies as long as possible.<br/>

I really hope not.<br/>
Because then I&#39;d wonder if they&#39;d ever searched themselves and truly<br/>
forged their own path. That&#39;s why I try really hard to suspend<br/>
judgement over their choices. Like when Trevor decided to start eating<br/>
red meat again (the family all eats some turkey/chicken while I<br/>
continue as a vegetarian). There are so many,many things I hope they<br/>
discover for themselves and question....even the things I&#39;ve shared<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
I truly don&#39;t have a vested interest in what they choose...though I<br/>
would have a very hard time with some of the options listed in this<br/>
discussion too.:)<br/>

 <br/>
Just my two cents but if you are -living- your belief system (whatever<br/>
it may be), it should be pretty obvious and mostly be communicated<br/>
through discussion and answering questions and day to day choices. And,<br/>
they may choose to accept those beliefs, modify them some, go in a<br/>
totally different direction, whatever. Just as an omnivorous family may<br/>
end up with some meat eaters and some vegetarians or vegans and a<br/>
vegetarian family may end up with some omnivores. As the adults and<br/>
keepers of the money and car keys, you can readily limit what food items<br/>
come into the house. And, you can even to some extent regulate what your<br/>
offspring eat when outside the house. But, at some point, your kids will<br/>
be making their own choices about what to eat and it may not be what you<br/>
would have chosen. We choose to have open communication about our<br/>
beliefs and choices, why we prefer to eat organic brown rice instead of<br/>
Uncle Ben&#39;s boiling bag rice or whatever. Sometimes I think the cashier<br/>
at the market must think we&#39;re a little &#39;odd&#39; with a cart full of<br/>
organic produce and half a dozen boxes of Pop Tarts and 3 lbs of hot<br/>
dogs. lol Just as we trust DS with learning and with food choices, we<br/>
have to trust his choices in his beliefs as well - there WILL be a point<br/>
when we have zero control of what he does. For now, yes, we could<br/>
require it and force it, but in the long run, IMO, it&#39;ll work out better<br/>
to start NOW giving him the freedom to explore and think and ponder and<br/>
question. He may not end up with a choice we would have wanted, but<br/>
that&#39;s between him and God, we&#39;re here to try to help him make that<br/>
connection but it&#39;s not up to us to decide.<br/>
