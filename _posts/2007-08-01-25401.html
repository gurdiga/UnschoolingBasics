<div id="ygrps-yiv-211598239">**I think most mainstream parents would have less problems with<br/>
unschooling ... presented as &quot;we supervise and interact with our<br/>
younger kids a lot, and we try to refuse as little as possible, and<br/>
when we do set limits, we try to do that as humanely as possible,<br/>
explaining as much a possible, ...considering the needs and<br/>
limitations of everyone in the family. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;I make it my intention to say &quot;Yes&quot; as much as possible?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure how the idea gets going that anyone on this list<br/>
literally says &quot;I never say &quot;No&quot;.&quot;  I haven&#39;t seen anyone say that (at<br/>
least in recent memory).  Your arguments are very thoughtful, but I<br/>
think you are attacking a straw man.  I don&#39;t want to get in your face<br/>
and argue with you, but I do want to argue with the idea that kids<br/>
must have rules to prevent dire consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding television, my son has had the opportunity all his life to<br/>
see television without me trying to control the amount or content.  I<br/>
don&#39;t see any signs that it has damaged his developing brain, and he<br/>
is now 13 years old.  That makes it pretty easy for me not to have the<br/>
same concerns about television that you do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**For example, consider Maura&#39;s pointing out the impracticality of<br/>
rounding upthe neighbors&#39; kids to go to a paint ball park. **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m better at finding solutions within my own family because I have<br/>
access to more information about the situation.  Of course we can&#39;t<br/>
find the perfect solution for Maura, considering our imperfect<br/>
knowledge or and our distance from the situation.  But we can generate<br/>
a lot of ideas and encourage her to adapt them to suit her family. <br/>
Generating great solutions isn&#39;t instantaneous, and sometimes has to<br/>
circle around and be repeated or tweaked or reconsidered.<br/>

PS  I wish I had more time to talk about &quot;rules vs. principles&quot;<br/>
because although I don&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t say &quot;NO&quot;&quot;, I do say &quot;I don&#39;t lay<br/>
down RULES&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t have fixed limits&quot;.</div>
