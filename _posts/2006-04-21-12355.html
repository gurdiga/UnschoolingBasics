<div id="ygrps-yiv-682275362">Hi I am new to this site and have been really discouraged because I am not quite there yet with all of you moms.  I am praying and letting go more and more everyday.  PTL!  But today, when I read Melissa&#39;s story on ICKY feelings at the Book Sale.  BINGO...there I am.  Thanks for sharing. It has blessed me in a real way!<br/>
