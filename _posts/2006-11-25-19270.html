<div id="ygrps-yiv-621748211">Hope everyone has had a great (long) Thanksgiving weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly ordered a new book for me (and the house) which I think will <br/>
interest you if you&#39;re so inclined.  Before I give you the title, let <br/>
me share some of the points I&#39;ve read in the past 20 minutes reading <br/>
this book.<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Today&#39;s kids are not ADD, they&#39;re EOE: Engage Me or Enrage Me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        &quot;Like all of us, including the adults who spend countless hours <br/>
perfecting golfing, fishing, and other hobby skills, kids love to learn <br/>
when it isn&#39;t forced on them.  In fact, because their brains are still <br/>
growing, kids probably love this *non-forced learning* even more than <br/>
the rest of us.  This is why game designer Raph Koster says that the <br/>
*fun* kids are always seeking is really a synonym for *unforced <br/>
learning*&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
        As stated by James Paul Gee, Tashia Morgridge Professor of <br/>
Reading at the University of Wisconsin-Madison writes in his Foreward: <br/>
&quot;(the author) knows that game designers have learned to harness deep <br/>
and powerful learning -- learning in the sense of problem solving, <br/>
decision making, hypothesizing, and strategizing -- as a form of fun, <br/>
pleasure, engagemeent, even *flow*&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
        Mr. Gee goes on to point out that the author *knows* what makes <br/>
a person good or bad on video games is not violence or lack of it, but <br/>
how the game is played.  &quot;Does the player see through the *eye candy* <br/>
and the superficial content to the underlying rules, strategy spaces, <br/>
and emergent possibilities for problem solving?  If so, powerful <br/>
learning and thinking are going on.&quot;  Gee goes on to argue if these two <br/>
things weren&#39;t taking place, the player would *die* and have to start <br/>
over again.  {I don&#39;t know about your guys, but Duncan hasn&#39;t missed <br/>
getting to at least the fifth level of any *new* game in less than two <br/>
days in quite some time}.<br/>
<br/>
        Finally, the author saw a t-shirt a kid was wearing in NYC which <br/>
stated: &quot;I&#39;m not attention deficit - I&#39;m just not listening&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The book is called &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom -- I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc <br/>
Prensky.  I thought that I&#39;d pass this along to the group since <br/>
*gaming* (or computers/TV) always gets some time at our SSUDs gathering <br/>
and beyond.  So far in the book, the author is focused on the good our <br/>
kids get from gaming rather than focus on all the negative that seems <br/>
to get into the media.  The book gives the thinking parent an <br/>
opportunity to make a more informed decision.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you pick it up if you don&#39;t have it, or comment on it if (when) <br/>
you&#39;ve read it.  I&#39;m just getting started but think I&#39;ll get a lot out <br/>
of it myself.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, thanks for the preview. : )  I&#39;ve seen that book at the library <br/>
and was thinking of getting it, but hadn&#39;t made up my mind, mainly <br/>
because my kids don&#39;t play games...they have free access to them, they <br/>
just usually have something else to do.  What you&#39;ve said about it <br/>
makes me think, though, that I may glean some information from it I <br/>
can use in other situations, ie. talking with my sister about her <br/>
boys. <br/>
I think I&#39;ll go see if the library&#39;s open now.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
