<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805685672">Athough I myself am not a grown unschooler, I do think of myself as an  <br/>
unschooler, who unschools with my kids.  We had this thread going a while  back, <br/>
but I&#39;ve been thinking about it some more.  Things I&#39;m interested in  and taught <br/>
myself that school, college, and grad school was useless for:<br/>
gardening (veggies and flowers)<br/>
living off-grid<br/>
unschooling<br/>
scrapbooking/ photography<br/>
cutting fire wood<br/>
converting/ driving a veggie fuel powered car (dh does this, not me)<br/>
playing the piano<br/>
finding cool stuff at the library for us to learn from<br/>
using the computer & internet<br/>
child rearing<br/>
working with preschoolers/ high school students (my income, but didn&#39;t  <br/>
actually learn anything useful during school for this)<br/>
raising chickens<br/>
building a chicken coop, fence, and raised bed gardens<br/>
building with Legos<br/>
playing cool board games with the kids<br/>
    I&#39;m sure there must be more, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come  up with for now.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I just found out that our area is planning a children&#39;s museum to  open <br/>
in a year, I have got to get in on this,maybe I would jump off the public  <br/>
school educator&#39;s boat to join in- and maybe, just maybe, my own children would  <br/>
be welcome there during working hours, can you imagine?  I used to love to  <br/>
see in Mothering Mag photos of kids at work with their parents, in a business,  <br/>
that was not actually owned by those parents.<br/>
