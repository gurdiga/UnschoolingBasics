<div id="ygrps-yiv-476795362">Just a quick suggestion( ok it got longer as I wrote)to help with each of<br/>
the dilemmas you describe.  (Food and packing) These are to be taken as two<br/>
of *many* options you have, just to get you thinking.  You sound &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>
like, you don&#39;t see any good options from where you are standing.  This<br/>
happens to me when I&#39;m in the thick of things.  Especially if someone is<br/>
screaming. ;)<br/>
<br/>
If you can predict early enough that dd isn&#39;t eating well.  Before she<br/>
starts to get grumpy, try putting a few small nutritious things out within<br/>
reach.  Bring her a sandwich or whatever you think she might like and, with<br/>
a smile, say, hi, I though you might like this.  And just leave it there.<br/>
Or you might just put it down nicely where she is playing and say nothing.<br/>
I like to cut up fruit or put cheese and crackers out on the counter and<br/>
then just let everyone know they&#39;re there.  I&#39;ve provided something nice,<br/>
for them, they can choose to eat it or not, but then the chips and candy<br/>
aren&#39;t more convenient for them than the healthy stuff.  Sometimes the kids<br/>
will go rooting for candy but most of the time they are looking for<br/>
something quick and convenient.  Yours will be different but looking for<br/>
un-intrusive ways to provide good healthy options for them just before the<br/>
need hits may help.  Of course you need to be ok with them *not* choosing<br/>
what you&#39;ve provided.  They may test you on this a few times before they<br/>
believe you aren&#39;t just trying to &quot;make&quot; them comply in a disguised form.<br/>
<br/>
Packing: I have one kid who almost always wants to pack for herself.  If<br/>
yours is not able to do this perfectly yet, let her pack her way and then<br/>
put a few options she may want in your own bag.  That way when she gets hot<br/>
in her Christmas dress and wants to change you can say. &quot;Hey, I have a pair<br/>
of shorts and a t-shirt here, would you like them?&quot;  If she&#39;s not hot and<br/>
complaining though, I would just smile and enjoy her quirky choices.  Those<br/>
on this list who know my Anika (almost 4yo dd), know I am familiar with this<br/>
dilemma.  Anika wears the most wonderful (some would say appalling) array of<br/>
costumes and dress up clothes everywhere we go.  I often have a back up in<br/>
my bag but she rarely wants to change unless she becomes uncomfortable or<br/>
wet and even then...? I only insist that she needs to wear panties or shorts<br/>
under dresses - because she spends so much of her time hanging upside down.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the attitude of a cheerful guide, it is fine to point out things<br/>
that might truly be helpful for her to know ie: &quot; We&#39;ll be gone for 3 days<br/>
so you&#39;ll need at least 3 pairs of underwear.&quot;   Or &quot;gosh, that&#39;s too much<br/>
to fit in your suitcase. Can you try to choose the things you like best and<br/>
we&#39;ll see if we can get them to fit.&quot;  Or even &quot;I&#39;m taking my blue<br/>
nightgown.  Which pajamas are you going to bring?&quot;  Maybe let her help you<br/>
pack your bag if she will, that will give her some idea of what&#39;s involved.<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s nothing wrong with letting her discover for herself that her<br/>
bag is not quite right when she gets there and nothing wrong with rescuing<br/>
but it must be done without an &quot;I told you so&quot; tone in your voice.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good trip,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455297913">That&#39;s what we do...big with the lists.  We all sit down together <br/>
before we start packing and work up a list.  If we don&#39;t, we&#39;ll show <br/>
up at our destination without toothbrush, underwear, etc. <br/>
Something.  lol.  Jay always adds something - like teddy bear.. Abby <br/>
too - usually walkman or books to read or paper and pen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182548629">Hi Krisula,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will try the food thing, I know that I did sort of loose it last week, I<br/>
saw she wasn&#39;t eating the healthy choices, but decided for some reason that<br/>
with the &quot;let her eat what she wants&quot; philosophy that I didn&#39;t need to put<br/>
more effort in that I did. I was wrong. Guess I learned there too huh?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I love her clothes choices normally so will try to just pack some more<br/>
appropriate items for her in the future. The other day she went out in her<br/>
ballet outfit (with a flounsey skirt) and two different Dora socks and black<br/>
hello kitty shoes. People looked and smiled or laughed, she took offense and<br/>
I struggled with how to let her know that if you don&#39;t want people to notice<br/>
you you need to blend in a bit more:-)<br/>
<br/>
