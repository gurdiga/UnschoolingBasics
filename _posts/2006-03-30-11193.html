<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565917618">&lt;&lt;Do you have to cut all your hair off to undo the<br/>
process?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is my plan. I&#39;ve had really short hair in the past and look forward to <br/>
having it again so that doesn&#39;t bother me. A friend of mine cut her dreads <br/>
off after about 10 years and her air was probably 4-6 inches long after the <br/>
cut.From what I understand, dreaded hair grows more quickly than &quot;regular&quot; <br/>
hair.<br/>
