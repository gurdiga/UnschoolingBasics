<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450579859">&quot; Ren might balk at the idea of really HUGE name tags. &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even like nametags...but I obediently wore mine the whole<br/>
weekend.:) Kathryn had all these cute little ribbons to add at the<br/>
bottom, for speakers and funshops presenters.  The funshops ones said<br/>
&quot;Plays well with others&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous place we ended up this last time, was the Shu Umera<br/>
store, where I purchased a massive false lash (to be cut up) and some<br/>
eyeshadow. Never did convince Jon to wear any of it, though Ben was<br/>
quite agreeable that way.;)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should do a tattoo funshop in Albuquerque, and do an offsite<br/>
&quot;field trip&quot;?  Ooooh yes.<br/>
