<div id="ygrps-yiv-303032948">I just wanted to share... especially for all of the newbies who struggle<br/>
with implementing unschooling fully and who may or may not realize that<br/>
personal growth is the key to doing so.<br/>
<br/>
I started reading &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons<br/>
in Personal Change&quot; by Stephen R. Covey.  I was in awe of how his book fit<br/>
right into unschooling.  If you&#39;re having a tough time grasping the<br/>
philosophies of unschooling and non-coercive parenting and/or you &quot;get it&quot;<br/>
but don&#39;t know how to make the change to fully implement it, I highly<br/>
recommend that you read this book.<br/>
<br/>
(If you&#39;ve read it, I&#39;d like to hear your opinion about it.)<br/>

J~One of the annoying things about believing in free will and individual responsibility is the difficulty of finding somebody to blame your problems on. And when you do find somebody, it&#39;s remarkable how often his picture turns up on your driver&#39;s license.~ - P. J. O&#39;Rourke |<br/>
