<div id="ygrps-yiv-361531302">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;As much as I like to give free<br/>
choice (they can pick between healthy foods) and I offer junk food<br/>
in moderation... I just don&#39;t feel comfortable saying you can have<br/>
it whenever you want it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point being is that when kids are in control of what they put in <br/>
their mouth they begin to listen to their bodies and make wise food <br/>
choices most of the time.  My kids have total control over what they <br/>
choose to eat or not and most of the time they choose those things <br/>
that are healthier for them.  We have &quot;junk food&quot; around and we <br/>
have &quot;healthy&quot; things around and they usually eat a little of both.  <br/>
I put out platters of vegetables, fruit, cheese, crackers, etc.  and <br/>
the vegetables are usually the first to go.  After a few pieces of <br/>
candy Tristan will usually ask me to make him something healthy <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t feel so good.  They really do learn to listen to <br/>
cues their bodies give them.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem lies with children who are controlled and then when <br/>
given that control they will gorge on the stuff that they usually <br/>
can&#39;t have, because they believe it won&#39;t be there tomorrow.  They <br/>
will ignore how they feel because they are hording.  Poverty <br/>
stricken people or ones that, at some point in their lives have had <br/>
to live in poverty, will do the same thing, as was already mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many, many times my kids will say &#39;no thanks&#39; to sweets and goodies <br/>
because they don&#39;t feel like it and they do it because they know <br/>
they can wake up in the morning and have the same thing at home if <br/>
they want.  Tristan threw away half of his Halloween candy because <br/>
he knew he would never finish it.  People are always flabbergasted <br/>
that my kids will say no to goodies.  And I certainly haven&#39;t put <br/>
their health in jeopordy, they are some of the healthiest kids I <br/>
know and they will eat all sorts of things that most kids wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even touch, ie tofu, Thai food, hummus, etc.  And they HATE <br/>
McDonalds! (except the fries on occasion)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116197006">It&#39;s funny the way you explained that. It just got me thinking of <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
At home, all the candy is put up and my three year old asks for it <br/>
when she wants some. (my younger two are only 14 mos and 3 mos so <br/>
they dont get candy lol)<br/>
<br/>
So when she has the chance to get her hands on some, it&#39;s gone in a <br/>
heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
But now that I think about it... we go to gym class every week and <br/>
afterwards we always hit the pizza buffet restaurant. They have <br/>
pizza, pasta, and salad. <br/>
<br/>
I guess since pizza would be the &quot;junk food&quot; of the three... and <br/>
shes always been able to have the pizza... its not as desirable to <br/>
her anymore. That would explain why she now only wants the salad and <br/>
breadsticks. Okay and maybe a brownie too LOL<br/>
<br/>
But I guess if I look at it from the way youre explaining it... shes <br/>
now picking the salad and veggies(and it blows my mind since shes <br/>
three lol) because she knows the pizza will be there if she wants it.<br/>
<br/>
Ive never thought of it like that I guess... hmmm...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I first started parenting, I was very concerned about food. I <br/>
was very selective about what came in the house. Then I started <br/>
noticing how friends older kids acted about food and feeling like a <br/>
hypocrit when I wanted the food that I was concealing from my child. <br/>
By the time Ihad my first bio child, I had changed my views on many <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
DS (4) has never had any food restrictions. Certain foods upset his <br/>
stomach, and I have helped with that connection, but sometimes he <br/>
wants to try them, and that is his choice. He is an active <br/>
participant when we grocery shop. He may chose what ever he wants. <br/>
This is not to say that I do not provide him with little tidbits <br/>
about nutrition and ingrediants, but if he were to prefer goldfish to <br/>
his chedder bunnies, that is his choice.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, ds eats a pretty healthy diet. He eats when he is hungry. <br/>
When people offer him treats sometimes he says yes, sometimes no. We <br/>
have had two buckets of halloween candy on the table since halloween. <br/>
I think he has eaten a handful so far (and there is lots of &quot;good&quot; <br/>
candy in there). <br/>
<br/>
All of his friends are told what to eat, when to eat, and how much to <br/>
eat. Food is labeled as good or bad, etc. I have been startled at how <br/>
many occasions that I see these kids STEAL food from plates and <br/>
drawers and sneak around to eat them. The parents tell me that if <br/>
they don&#39;t control what the kids eat that they would never stop. So <br/>
what happens when mom or dad are no longer there?<br/>
<br/>
It makes me so sad to see the power that food has in these kids <br/>
lives. The kids cry, beg, whine, and meltdown all over food. We had a <br/>
Christmas party complete with Santa, but most of the kids were to <br/>
busy watching the goodies and slipping past them to sneak a bite to <br/>
enjoy Santa. My son was so excited that he didn&#39;t even eat any sweets.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a kid swipe candy from a desk while their parent was <br/>
checking them in (drs office). The kid slipped in the corner to eat, <br/>
looked nervously at me, and asked me if I let my kid eat candy. I <br/>
said sure. She asked how much or something to that effect. I told her <br/>
that he could eat what he wanted when he wanted. She was dumbfounded, <br/>
then told me what an awesome mom I was. I don&#39;t want my kid growing <br/>
up coveting a candy bar.<br/>
<br/>
While every person has different tastes, I really think if &quot;junk <br/>
food&quot; is just there and not assigned any power, that kids will show <br/>
moderation without soemone having to &quot;control&quot; them. Maybe not at the <br/>
get go, but as soon as they realize that it is available at their <br/>
discretion.</div>

<br/>
Some kids come out of school barely able to function.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids come out of school and go onto Harvard.<br/>
<br/>
Which is the right theory?<br/>
<br/>
None. It&#39;s statistics. A certain percentage will go onto Harvard and  <br/>
a certain percentage will have a tough time getting a job at Wal-Mart.<br/>
<br/>
It is a common *human* behavior to respond to limits by hoarding or  <br/>
excessively craving what was once limited. It won&#39;t be 100% response.  <br/>
Maybe not even 75%. I haven&#39;t kept statistics on it over the past 12  <br/>
years of reading the stories of the outcomes of removing limits, but  <br/>
it&#39;s *very* common for kids to binge on what they&#39;ve been denied. It  <br/>
can be TV or snacky food or anything (but those are the most common  <br/>
things parents limit so those are what most of the stories are about.)<br/>

This is a kid I have known since he was 17 years old. Second of all the percentage of kids that binge eat and drink and gain weight in College is so big you may wonder why. Is it because the parents are not there to control them????I was also raised in Brazil where it is like France and a lot of parents will let their kids drink. I remember drinking as early as 6. Sunday late afternoon lunches always included a glass of red wine if a kid wanted and our parents bar was always open. Non of the four kids in our family drink in a regular basis now. And I don&#39;t remember a lot of drinking in College either. There were two times I had too much to drink when I was on my twenties and because I did not like not being totally on control of MYSELF I really dislike being drunk. I cannot image why kids go to College and go crazy drinking until they are sick....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346383996">The idea is a theory... maybe not your particular situation sinc eyou know this person.<br/>
   <br/>
  What I&#39;m saying is that it IS a theory that kids who were never forbidden something will never binge on it.<br/>
   <br/>
  It is ALSO a theory that a child who IS forbidden something will binge on the forbidden thing when he is on his own.<br/>
   <br/>
  Not true.<br/>
   <br/>
  My parents made it very clear I was not to drink, smoke or do drugs growing up. And that was the bottom line... I was not to question their decisions whatsoever.<br/>
   <br/>
  To this day I have never done any sort of drug, I have had two drinks EVER (one this new years eve and one last year) and have never even raised a cigarette to my mouth.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have no desire to, because I as my own person can make my own decisions now based on what I feel is right for me.<br/>
   <br/>
  I was raised with rules and good morals and I know doing those things is wrong, so I don&#39;t do them. I have no desire to harm my body is any way, so I choose not to.<br/>
   <br/>
  And this is coming from a person who was brought up in a house FULL of rules. <br/>

I am only 21 years old, moved out of my parents house when I was 17. I was not allowed junk food most of the time and wasn&#39;t allowed to eat much in between meals. To this day, I still don&#39;t eat much junkfood... really none at all most of the time.<br/>

This is a kid I have known since he was 17 years old. Second of all the percentage of kids that binge eat and drink and gain weight in College is so big you may wonder why. Is it because the parents are not there to control them????I was also raised in Brazil where it is like France and a lot of parents will let their kids drink. I remember drinking as early as 6. Sunday late afternoon lunches always included a glass of red wine if a kid wanted and our parents bar was always open. Non of the four kids in our family drink in a regular basis now. And I don&#39;t remember a lot of drinking in College either. There were two times I had too much to drink when I was on my twenties and because I did not like not being totally on control of MYSELF I really dislike being drunk. I cannot image why kids go to College and go crazy drinking until they are sick....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597818539">~~What I&#39;m saying is that it IS a theory that kids who were never<br/>
forbidden something will never binge on it.<br/>
<br/>
It is ALSO a theory that a child who IS forbidden something will binge<br/>
on the forbidden thing when he is on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Not true.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, the above ideas are NOT just theories, they&#39;re<br/>
well-studied human behavior traits. Secondly, you&#39;re painting it in<br/>
absolutes and human behavior is never like that.<br/>
<br/>
You can never say &quot;If you do ______, then______ will happen&quot;. That&#39;s<br/>
setting up a false argument because there just aren&#39;t any absolutes<br/>
where human&#39;s are concerned. Every person responds to stimulus and<br/>
environment differently. When a very large percentage of people react<br/>
a certain way, we can learn from those situations about what is<br/>
helpful or harmful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty easy to see that MOST humans are going to react to food<br/>
controls with some form of binging. Happens all the time. There&#39;s book<br/>
after book written on this topic, with solid research to back them.<br/>
Good research.<br/>
<br/>
My kids &quot;binge&quot; on certain items at times, even though their food is<br/>
NOT controlled by me. Heck, we all love a good dose of truffles or<br/>
mashed potatoes or some of the things that we don&#39;t have every day.<br/>
Sometimes root beer floats sound really great and we have a bunch of<br/>
those. Trying to keep my kids from binging is not my goal.<br/>
<br/>
All of my children will request foods like brocolli, potatoes,<br/>
noodles, pita pockets with hummus, homemade bread and other healthy<br/>
snacks. They&#39;ll also ask for candy bars and soda sometimes. I trust<br/>
that when their body has had enough, they&#39;ll eat something<br/>
different...and they do.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t FEEL very good to eat a bunch of sugar and nothing else.<br/>
After a while you just crave some protein or a hot meal. I have free<br/>
choice over my food and so do they. We all listen to our own body and<br/>
I trust their learning process with food, just as with all other<br/>
topics in the universe.<br/>
<br/>
Just because SOME humans won&#39;t react to food controls with unhealthy<br/>
habits and behaviors, doesn&#39;t make food controls a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Our prisons are FULL of people that were raised in abusive homes.<br/>
There are also some people that were raised in abusive homes that<br/>
create a great life for themselves and do positive things. Does that<br/>
mean abuse is a good idea, just because SOME people seem to overcome it?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not attempting any specific outcome other than children that trust<br/>
and know their OWN limits and preferences. If they binge, they<br/>
binge....that&#39;s their choice. So far, they&#39;re really healthy and eat a<br/>
very balanced diet overall. I don&#39;t use food controls because I think<br/>
they suck. I wouldn&#39;t want someone telling ME what to do, what to eat<br/>
etc....so I don&#39;t perpetuate that on my children. <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, this lifestyle makes sense to me. <br/>

I was raised with rules and good morals and I know doing those  things is <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made the same choice as you, but people who  choose to do those <br/>
(self-destructive) things are often ALSO raised  with great morals, know those things are <br/>
wrong but they instead  decide they want to hurt themselves and mess their <br/>
lives up. I  don&#39;t blame the parents or rules or the word &#39;no&#39; for that. I blame <br/>
 the individual who made that bad choice. This reminds  me of a story that my <br/>
mom always tells about two sons of an alcoholic. one  became a drinker and <br/>
the other never touched alcohol in his life, but when  asked &quot;why do you drink / <br/>
why do you not drink&quot; they both  responded with the answer &quot;because my father <br/>
drinks.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
We live in a society of victims who love to blame  their parents, the <br/>
government, their lack of opportunities, etc...and seek  out therapists who search <br/>
their past for all sorts of abuses that can  answer why they aren&#39;t how they <br/>
wish they were. They blame  others for everything that didn&#39;t go right rather <br/>
than pointing  the finger at themselves and remembering that they had a choice. I <br/>
rarely  hear people saying &quot;oh yeah, my mom (who tried her hardest and  <br/>
communicated the only way she knew how) DID tell me it would hurt me,  I didn&#39;t <br/>
listen and did it anyway and have continued to rebel  and do things that I know <br/>
will hurt me for years after, what is wrong  with ME, not my parents, what do I <br/>
need to do to straighten  MYSELF out and become self-respecting?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Not true.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  Actually for some of us, it is true.  I was raised in a house where we weren&#39;t allowed junk - -the only cereal we ever had at home was Total, and we only ate Roman Meal bread.  My sister, brother and I were the 20-something-olds (and we each left home at 18, so the food thing took years to work thru) roaming the grocery store with our carts filled with Cap&#39;n Crunch cereal, Froot Loops, fruit cocktail drinks, wonder bread and all manner of other artificial food  It was years before any of us came back around to eating healthy food by choice.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And don&#39;t even get me started on the weight issues that confront some of us who lived on very tightly controlled diets.  <br/>
   <br/>
  So, for some it is hypothetical, others have personal experience  As with all things your mileage may vary, and we all make our choices with our own past experiences in mind, no matter what the choice. For me the choice is to give my kids as much autonomy as humanly possible, so they can figure out their own dietary needs, preferences and how to moderate all that while they&#39;re still young.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  also, the above text I snipped was confusing, because I&#39;m not sure if the same person said all those things... <br/>

<br/>
My daughter is not afraid to eat candy because she thinks her teeth <br/>
will fall out. She ate the candy she wanted that day. But I have <br/>
explained to her that if she eats and eats and eats nothing but junk <br/>
her teeth will fall out (just like her dad&#39;s did when he was younger <br/>
and could eat whatever he wanted... he had nothing but cavities.)<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you a question....<br/>
<br/>
Would you feel right if you let your child eat nothing but candy (if <br/>
that is what they choose to do) but you never sat them down and told <br/>
them that they could get cavities and could lose teeth because of <br/>
lal the sugar? Would they be making an informed decision or would <br/>
you be denying them the truth?<br/>
<br/>
I would rather tell my kids the truth, bad or good and then if they <br/>
choose to tell others and spread the knowledge... I say spread on!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613063557">~~I&#39;m sorry, but I dont see where I said that allowing a child to eat<br/>
candy to get them to shut up had anything to do with unschooling?<br/>
Where did you get the idea that I was saying that?~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because you were using it as an example of why &quot;allowing&quot; a child to<br/>
eat all the candy they want is a bad idea. We&#39;re not here to tell<br/>
people &quot;give your kid all the candy they want&quot; or &quot;let them eat candy<br/>
so they&#39;ll leave you alone&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The kind of parenting paradigm we&#39;re discussing is about being<br/>
mindful, being aware and NOT just doing things without thought. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a good example for using against our advice to give kids<br/>
more autonomy over their food choices.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, all of the kids I know that DO have free choice over<br/>
food, don&#39;t WANT to eat nothing but candy. Show me a kid that will eat<br/>
nothing but candy for more than a day. The human body does not feel<br/>
very good after a very short time of this. Worst case, it will<br/>
probably last for about 3 days. I don&#39;t think most humans can go three<br/>
days on nothing but sweets though.<br/>
<br/>
I dare you to try it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2377391">Kids that are allowed to eat all and what they want without guilt, coercion or limits will not choose to eat only candy. Period.<br/>
And Ren is right. Sugar alone will not cause cavities. Genetics, and other factors plus the needed Strep Mutans bacteria are necessary for cavities to occur.<br/>
 I never cared about candies but one of my cousins and my best friend love them and always had candies and gum when we were young. They both are cavity free.<br/>
We are not saying that our kids eat &quot;junk and &quot;candy&quot; all day long without us providing healthy foods and guidance.<br/>
My ds ( 4 and a half years old ) is really getting into discussing healthy foods now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439097892">Candy can lead to SERIOUS complications and I am living  proof of someone <br/>
that tried the &quot;do what you want with your candy&quot;  approach and seriously regret <br/>
it. I have unschooled my kids  with candy, have very little at home but let <br/>
them have what is offered to  them; mostly from goody bags at parties (parties <br/>
happen all year long) and  Halloween. One of mine, the oldest really doesn&#39;t <br/>
like  it, the youngest likes it but mostly is into chocolate and that isn&#39;t  <br/>
something that really has hurt her teeth much. The middle one eats all he  can <br/>
get, loves the gooey colored sugary crap, plus what the  other two don&#39;t want. <br/>
He has had rotted out baby molars that ended  up needing fillings and <br/>
extractions. One needed a deep filling and  bacteria grew under when that tooth got <br/>
loose and then he ended up with an  abscess and with severe toxemia in his body; <br/>
lost tons of weight wasn&#39;t  growing, needed antibiotics which I HATE the idea <br/>
of. Now he is on  lacto-bacilicus to get his intestines back in order. We also <br/>
 unschooled with toothbrushing and flossing. He only brushes once a day and  <br/>
flosses about once a month. The other two that do it more have better  teeth. <br/>
Where am I with all of this now? Well, first of all next Halloween  they will <br/>
have to go through their candies and pick maybe 10 or 12  that they like, the <br/>
rest go in the trash. They know this already and are  ok with it. My son never <br/>
wants to go through this hell again but he needs  my help in keeping him away <br/>
from it and getting his health in  order! I&#39;m also limiting what we accept <br/>
from others, and will  stand by him and make sure he brushes and flosses twice a <br/>
day even if he  hates it. The infection ALMOST SPREAD TO HIS BRAIN! They (the <br/>
dentists)  told me of numerous occasions where this can happen and where kids <br/>
were on  antibiotics (IV) in the hospital because a tooth got screwed up, <br/>
baby or  permanent, all because of things like juice (even 100% fruit), sodas and <br/>
 candies. So what candy can do to you IS serious. It can hurt a  child&#39;s <br/>
blood sugar, pancreas, behavior, teeth, chances of proper  digestion of other <br/>
foods and can be addictive.<br/>
 <br/>
NOT GOOD STUFF! I feel terribly guilty about all of  this. I&#39;m one of those <br/>
people who would NEVER allow someone to smoke  around my child, yet I feel <br/>
there has been something inside of them that&#39;s  been potentially almost as <br/>
damaging. We are making big changes around here  because of it.  <br/>

CRUEL? leaving 10 or 12 candies isn&#39;t taking it all  away. They pick the ca<br/>
ndies and they came up with this number! We talked  about what to do and this is <br/>
what we came up with (democratically) as a  family. we went through HELL with <br/>
this, it is what we all thought the  solution should be. Cruel was seeing him <br/>
with one side of his face  blown up LIKE A BALOON from infection. If you want <br/>
to see pictures I will  email them to you privately. We thought he had mumps. <br/>
This wasn&#39;t some  small thing! My son (the one that almost had an infection <br/>
go to his BRAIN)  doesn&#39;t think it is cruel. he thinks it would be cruel to <br/>
keep things the  way they are and have him get sick again. He hates the needles, <br/>
the  medicine (he&#39;s actually sitting right next to me telling me this,  <br/>
dictating) LOL, but he says if there is a big bowl of candy he will eat it  &quot;no <br/>
matter what.&quot; I am really proud of him for knowing this about himself!  The kids <br/>
LOVE LOVE LOVE getting dressed up. They love going door to  door. The love <br/>
getting together with friends. All agree that the candy  is not the part of trick <br/>
or treating that is great. They do love  candy and will treasure the pieces <br/>
that they decide are most important to  them. And will brush (and hopefully <br/>
floss) after.  <br/>
<br/>

kids? Nope. Seeing only those two choices is preventing you  from<br/>
seeing the hundreds of options, the many ways you don&#39;t have  to<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son, who had the infection, was born with a rare  congenital defect of his <br/>
bile ducts. The other two are super healthy and  do not have this problem. He <br/>
is VERY attracted (craves like crazy)  everything that causes him to turn <br/>
yellow/jaundiced, become too acidic,  and get things like canker-sores, cavities <br/>
and infections. (even too much  fruit is a problem for him, if I have a large <br/>
bowl of strawberries for  example, and put the whole bowl on the table, he <br/>
will eat the whole thing,  get the sores in his mouth, get a low grade infection, <br/>
turn yellow) It  took us the longest time to even see that there was any <br/>
relation to what  he ate and his problems. Now that we know, I can&#39;t IMAGINE why <br/>
you  would think that I shouldn&#39;t help him with this? I LOVE HIM. I want him to <br/>
 live a long healthy life. He does too. <br/>
 <br/>
When you have a child telling you &quot;I don&#39;t want to be  sick again help me&quot; <br/>
you help them!<br/>

not eating too many sweets -- I know I do.  (I still eat &#39;em<br/>
sometimes, because, well, I was born with a set of genetically<br/>
programmed sweet teeth!)  <br/>
<br/>
That said, when my ds was younger, we did limit sweets at times.  He<br/>
is now 15, and has been known to have too much.  Logical consequences<br/>
don&#39;t always seem to teach the lesson, and we do intervene as parents.<br/>
We view it as guiding.  That, too, can be done respectfully, though.  <br/>

I don&#39;t allow fluoride at the dentist&#39;s office (but they  brush with regular <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444645989">Our family has been out of the school system for 4 years, and it&#39;s<br/>
gradually morphed into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One of the euphoric honeymoon phases of our first homeschooling years<br/>
was that our family&#39;s principles were no longer undermined with the<br/>
onslaught of mainstream plastic values and such - we could learn<br/>
together in freedom without labels.  This was the one place we could<br/>
come and breathe (literally) free of chemical scents (many of us have a<br/>
moderate sensitivity).<br/>
<br/>
I think food choice is a highly personal thing, as is food guidance.<br/>
Each body is different, and can tolerate different things, and for<br/>
different reasons.  Some families grow up vegetarian or vegan, some<br/>
people grow up meat eaters, some people add candy to the mix of both.<br/>
We were vegetarian for a good long while and ironically, even though we<br/>
got teased about it quite a bit, any dishes we brought to potluck style<br/>
gatherings, from delicious salads, to lasagnas and such, said teasers<br/>
were often the first to dive into our dishes and we were lucky if *we*<br/>
had anything to eat by the time we got around to it (grin).  I&#39;d bring<br/>
trays of fruit and melons and organic grapes, and they&#39;d practically be<br/>
fighting over the last melon slice, because &quot;It has been a long time<br/>
since we had something like this!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of new to getting used to the unschooling, deschooling<br/>
principles, and what makes someone a &quot;true unschooler&quot;.    What I love<br/>
about unschooling is that it&#39;s not jumping from one &quot;box&quot; into another,<br/>
and if one family doesn&#39;t typically have candy lying around their house<br/>
and one does, what matters is that the child is well loved and nourished<br/>
in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
In general, at our house, candy isn&#39;t sought out or included as a &quot;food<br/>
group&quot; any more than my knitting needles and yarn are.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
have to buy it, as our neighbours seem to have a steady supply going<br/>
that they offer to our children (grin).  My kids eat it and enjoy the<br/>
taste, but even they know, without me having to tell them, that it&#39;s not<br/>
&quot;food&quot; (as in the sense of it is nourishing), but more something to<br/>
tickle the taste buds only.  At Christmas time I spent an unusual amount<br/>
of money on candy to decorate cookie houses (I think I spent about $20<br/>
on the whole works).  I told them they were allowed to eat as much of<br/>
their creations as they wished.  Well, there are quite a bit of<br/>
&quot;leftovers&quot; on the kitchen counter growing stale and gross, and soon to<br/>
be tossed, and ny most people&#39;s definitions we are &quot;restrictive&quot; when it<br/>
comes to candy and things.<br/>
<br/>
But for us, the main thing isn&#39;t that we say &quot;no, that&#39;s bad&quot; ( we<br/>
don&#39;t).  Our kids themselves see that candy is nothing more than sugar<br/>
and fluff, and doesn&#39;t really satisfy them in the long term - they&#39;ve<br/>
come to be quite practical people :)  They like more bang for their<br/>
buck.  They don&#39;t get excited about it because we don&#39;t get excited<br/>
about it.<br/>

  For the record, unhealthy teeth is more a matter of genetics and water quality than of sugar eaten.  Some people who are meticulous about tooth care, still have cavities.  Some teeth come in with cavities -- Dan&#39;s teeth had weak, white spots even before they&#39;d fully emerged.  I have a cousin and a nephew who both had similar issues.  I have three kids -- all fed the same kind of diet -- two with very few cavities (in spite of sporadic brushing on their parts), one with several crowns and fillings.  It&#39;s not always about what one eats, or whether one brushes, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  Do you honestly believe that anyone with bad teeth eats candy non-stop?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532935379">There was a recent post about the dangers of candy and I want to address a <br/>
few unschooling concepts.<br/>
<br/>
But first I want to ask some new members to read more and post less.   Think <br/>
about why you&#39;re here.  Are you hear to learn about unschooling?   If you <br/>
are then arguing and telling unschoolers the many ways they are wrong won&#39;t <br/>
help you.   You&#39;re setting up a blockade in your mind to new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you don&#39;t want new ideas, that&#39;s up to you, but then, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be wasting our time with all your reasons why unschooling won&#39;t work.   We <br/>
know it works.   We&#39;ve been living this life a long time.   You can&#39;t tell <br/>
us anything about mainstream parenting ideas we haven&#39;t already given a lot <br/>
of thought to and can&#39;t find abundantly available in our everyday lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not a vacation from paying attention to what&#39;s going on with <br/>
our kids.  Kids need food.  Kids need mom&#39;s to be aware of what&#39;s happening <br/>
to their health.  Any child who puts any kind of food into his mouth is also <br/>
introducing bacteria and making a cozy place for bacteria to grow.  Yes, <br/>
bacteria grows in sugar, but it also grows in other foods.   Bacteria can <br/>
live in plain water, which is one reason we chlorinate our water supplies. <br/>
But candy itself is not bacteria.  It is another food that humans sometimes <br/>
eat.<br/>
<br/>
Some people, because of genetics, because of bacteria&#39;s common to their <br/>
environment or family will, have tooth decay even if they brush regularly <br/>
and eat few sweets.   Some people will have good, strong, decay resistant <br/>
teeth with little fuss.  There is more to tooth decay than candy.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking in extremes is not good thinking.   Unschooling won&#39;t work well for <br/>
people who can&#39;t or won&#39;t think clearly.  It wont work well for people who <br/>
have modeled their world around fear.<br/>
<br/>
There are more ways to help kids keep their mouths clean than making them <br/>
brush and denying or limiting candy.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was very little we got some soft tooth brushes for him.  I would <br/>
hold him on my hip while I brushed my teeth.  I am something of an obsessive <br/>
tooth brusher, (and always have been and that didn&#39;t save me from tooth <br/>
decay) so he saw me brush my teeth a lot.  And he had a little brush to hold <br/>
and play with while I brushed.  He could poke it into the stream of water <br/>
from the faucet and them brush my cheek or the mirror or his face or put it <br/>
in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I would talk about how good it felt to have a clean mouth.   His dad, who is <br/>
a creature of habit would snap his teeth together a few times and say &quot;Ah, <br/>
clean choppers.!&quot; and Dylan found that amusing.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan didn&#39;t get teeth early but he had a tooth brush very early and he had <br/>
a consistent examples of pleasant tooth brushing.<br/>
<br/>
And we always talked to him about why we did things, why we washed our hands <br/>
after going potty, or touching the dog bowl or taking out the trash.  Why we <br/>
washed our hands before we prepared food.  Why we used a clean dish cloth to <br/>
wipe the counter and table, etc.   Not as a lecture in hygiene but as <br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan is fourteen and has never had a cavity.    If I was going to brush my <br/>
teeth before leaving the house I&#39;d invite him to come brush with me.<br/>
There was a time he wanted me to brush his teeth for him, and I did that. <br/>
We never talked about brushing as if it was unpleasant (and it&#39;s not) or a <br/>
chore, we just brushed with the same attitude as we might have about getting <br/>
dressed or any other ordinary thing.   And we never talked about brushing as <br/>
if was desperately important.   It was just one thing we did as part of <br/>
living.<br/>
<br/>
I had read, before Dylan was born, that it was possible for mothers to <br/>
immunize their babies against the familial bacteria that can cause tooth <br/>
decay.  I wish now I could find that bit I read, I have looked for it <br/>
without success.   But the idea was that by sharing kisses or a spoon - <br/>
saliva, essentially - with a child before he has teeth, a mother might be <br/>
able to sort of inoculate her child.  Introducing that common family <br/>
bacteria to a child before he has teeth can help build his immunity to that <br/>
bacteria.    I don&#39;t know if that has been proved or disproved or ever will <br/>
be, but it&#39;s one of many things I read about tooth decay.<br/>
<br/>
There were five children in our family and four of us had childhood cavities <br/>
and some as adults.  My sister has no cavities.  She&#39;s now fifty one.  She <br/>
eats sweets and brushes her teeth.   After my sister was born my mother had <br/>
postpartum depression and my aunt took my sister to live with her for <br/>
several months.    I have often wondered if my sister&#39;s time with my aunt <br/>
inoculated her against our common family bacteria.  My mother made an <br/>
attempt at boiling everything that would come in contact with her children&#39;s <br/>
mouths.  My aunt was more practical.   I&#39;ll never know the answer, but my <br/>
sister has healthy teeth while her siblings have had cavities.<br/>
<br/>
So, Dylan had tooth brushes early and could use them however he wanted and <br/>
was given a consistent example of happy brushing.  He was never told to <br/>
brush and never forced to brush and if he fell asleep for the night before <br/>
brushing it was no big deal.  I believe that actually increased his <br/>
awareness of the difference between a clean feeling mouth and an unbrushed <br/>
mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot conceive of how a child&#39;s teeth could &quot;rot out&quot; without a mother <br/>
being aware there was a problem long before.  It&#39;s easy to look in the <br/>
mouths of children.  It&#39;s easy to detect infection by smell.  I&#39;m guessing <br/>
the term &quot;rotted out&quot; was used as part of the extreme language that&#39;s being <br/>
used in several of these posts and is an exaggeration of the facts.  If it&#39;s <br/>
not, and if a child&#39;s teeth &quot;rotted out&quot; before he was give help then I <br/>
don&#39;t know what to say, except that unschooling will take more awareness on <br/>
the part of a parent than that.<br/>
<br/>
My young nieces had cavities in their baby teeth so I understand that it <br/>
happens.  I don&#39;t understand &quot;rotted out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***My son never wants to go through this hell again but he needs my help in <br/>
keeping him away<br/>
from it and getting his health in order! ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;d never want to go through that again but the truth is he needed <br/>
your help long before this.  It need never have happened and while that&#39;s <br/>
not easy to say nor I&#39;m sure to hear, or consider, I&#39;m addressing this <br/>
because you&#39;ve come to this list and offered this information freely and <br/>
seem to be trying to convince many long time unschoolers, who don&#39;t force <br/>
brushing or restrict sweets, that the culprit was candy.<br/>

Why doesn&#39;t he feel capable of saying I need to brush after this  snickers or <br/>
to respond to a gentle reminder?<br/>
Why does the candy still  &quot;need&quot; restrictions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel like he can remember to brush every time  and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
think he will limit himself if there is a huge bowl of  candy in front of him. I <br/>
feel that way about plenty of things myself and  have asked friends to remind <br/>
me, or have set my life up in a way that  makes things better and healthier for <br/>
me. I am really proud that he  understands his limitations and welcomes the <br/>
help. He&#39;s pretty darn mature  for 9!<br/>
