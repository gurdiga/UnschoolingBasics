<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300503031">We are living in Taiwan (originally from South Africa), and there are<br/>
limits to our resources, mainly because most of the games, books, tv<br/>
etc  is in Chinese.  (This doesn&#39;t really bother the kids as they<br/>
enjoy the shows anyway), however, my question is this, can I still<br/>
provide an enriching environment for them? <br/>
<br/>
We live on the east coast where we are moving into the rainy season,<br/>
so we can pretty much expect rain for the next couple of months, so<br/>
going outdoors is not really an option either. (We live in an<br/>
apartment, so comming from sunny SA where we had a big house and a<br/>
garden with a pool, this has been a BIG adjustment for us all!)LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling, although not to homeschooling, and really see<br/>
the value in unschooling, but just question whether I can provide them<br/>
with enough of an enriching environment.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am wanting to know is unschooling possible if you are<br/>
limited with resources and don&#39;t have loads of field trips and such,<br/>
and if you spend most of the time indoors????<br/>
<br/>
(That question sounds strange to me when I re-read it, because I am<br/>
sure the answer is yes, LOL, but I suppose I am looking for<br/>
suggestions or advice on *things* to do)...<br/>
<br/>
Like I said earlier, I am new to the unschooling path, so I am just<br/>
trying to figure this all out, and trying to *deschool* myself (and my<br/>
husband, who is a teacher.....), because I really feel this is the<br/>
path for our family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for *listening* and I look forward to your replies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647799183">One thing, maybe, is to see what the local folks do during the rainy<br/>
season - my guess is that they don&#39;t just &#39;stop&#39; doing things. Get some<br/>
good galoshes and raincoats and when it&#39;s less torrential, head out for<br/>
puddle stomping, mud playing, critter watching (are there different<br/>
animals/bugs out and about during this season?) Even something as simple<br/>
as heading to a local tea shop for a snack in the middle of the day can<br/>
be an adventure KWIM? The idea of &quot;field trips&quot; is kind of a mis-nomer<br/>
because it presumes that there&#39;s a divide between life and school (you<br/>
spend your days in school and once in a while go out to actually do<br/>
something real). Your whole life is a field trip - the grocery store,<br/>
the bank, the post office, all those myriad things you do on a regular<br/>
basis. Particularly since you&#39;re living in a new area, treat the whole<br/>
thing as one Giant &quot;field trip&quot; - contact the local equivalent of the<br/>
&quot;Chamber of Commerce&quot; and see what they tell folks who want to visit the<br/>
area - what are the local industries? historic or otherwise significant<br/>
places? and so on.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and the kids are likely to be picking up Chinese pretty quickly<br/>
along the way too.<br/>

always great to hear about others who are in a similar situation (such<br/>
as being in a foreign country where EVERYTHING is so different to what<br/>
we are used to!).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is actually one of the things we had planned on doing (the<br/>
golloshes and stuff), as my boys LOVE to run in the rain (will take<br/>
their time about having a bath, but as soon as the rain comes they can<br/>
&#39;t wait to get out in it, and I figure with the next few months being<br/>
rain season, we may as well be properly equipped!) LOL  <br/>
<br/>
With regards to the &quot;field trips&quot;, I suppose what I was thinking is<br/>
that we need to go to more *educational* places to stimulate their<br/>
learning or something..... I suppose that it is just my *schoolish*<br/>
thinking creeping in...<br/>
<br/>
Also because I feel I am really lacking in &quot;resources&quot; due to the fact<br/>
that when we arrived here in Taiwan, it was only with a suitcase of<br/>
clothes each and a few english reading books and workbooks, so we do<br/>
not have a big home library of books and games....so I sometimes get<br/>
panicky that I won&#39;t be able to unschool effectively - does that make<br/>
sense?<br/>
<br/>
I realise I need to take off my *school glasses* and see that learning<br/>
happens in different ways, that a simple trip to the store, or them<br/>
comming along with me to dance class, is an adventure, an opportunity<br/>
for learning something new.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, they are picking up Chinese pretty quick!:o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to respond, and I am sure I will have a few<br/>
more questions along the way:o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098123115">OOoh you&#39;ve got a great opportunity to go out to whatever the equivalent<br/>
of a 5 and 10 is over there and pick up and learn some traditional games<br/>
- &quot;Go&quot; for instance, maybe mah jong?, who knows what other games the<br/>
kids (and adults) there play. Chess is pretty universal. Also, look into<br/>
maybe some traditional &#39;craft&#39; ideas. And music - goodness, Asian style<br/>
music is so different than Western music. All of that is *learning*<br/>
whether or not it looks &quot;educational&quot;. Oh, and don&#39;t forget stuff like<br/>
animation - I&#39;m sure Taiwanese versions are different than Japanese<br/>
anime. <br/>
