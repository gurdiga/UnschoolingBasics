<div id="ygrps-yiv-427253261">I&#39;m sending this to all the unschooling lists I&#39;m a member of, so I apologize to the list owners. But many people who are planning to come may not yet be on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LiveandLearnConference@yahoogroups.com">LiveandLearnConference@yahoogroups.com</a> list, and I need this to go out to everyone!<br/>
 <br/>
I have a number of people who have reserved rooms at the Sheraton but who have not yet registered for the conference. We are having difficulties with a few of the rooms, so I NEED to know whether you are coming or not. I know many of you reserve your rooms in advance  (because you know how fast they disappear! &lt;g&gt;) and then decide NOT to come at the last minute because of whatever reasons. <br/>
 <br/>
But this year, I have need of those rooms at the Sheraton if you are NOT coming!<br/>
 <br/>
Please e-mail me off-list  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbcdlovejo@...">kbcdlovejo@...</a>  as soon as possible so that I make the necessary changes.<br/>
 <br/>
Please feel free to forward this message on to other lists I am not on (RUL, for example, and other local lists).<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
