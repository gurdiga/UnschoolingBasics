<div id="ygrps-yiv-860838362">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Johanna from Germany (again)... som of you might remember me.<br/>
<br/>
The magazine I work and write for, www.unerzogen-magazine.de, is  <br/>
looking for an unschooling parent who could write for an article (in  <br/>
English) about unschooling YOUNG kids, meaning before the common age  <br/>
of 6 when they start school.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know someone who usually gives great advice with toddlers and  <br/>
preschoolers, who has a few children that age or who were recently  <br/>
that age, and who likes to write and would give it a try? It may be a  <br/>
professional writer, but doesnt have to be, we can help. If you are  <br/>
interested yourself or if you know anybody, please write us: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:johanna.gundermann@...">johanna.gundermann@...</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;unerzogen&quot; is a young German magazine, it&#39;s only been out there  <br/>
almost 2 years now. It issues 4 times a year. We publish articles on  <br/>
unschooling, respectful parenting (equal rights for all ages),  <br/>
democratic education (as our only option for free learning since  <br/>
homeschooling is illegal in Germany) and about the right to choose  <br/>
your own education (which we do not have in Germany). Since our first  <br/>
issue, we have published two articles about unschooling in each issue.<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this message to other mailinglists if you can, as well  <br/>
as friends or groups where there might be people who are interested.  <br/>
I&#39;m writing only to this mailinglist, in hope you will forward to the  <br/>
many other unschooling mailingslist that exist.<br/>
<br/>
On of the things the article should be about is, that from an  <br/>
unschooling point of view, it doesn&#39;t matter if the child ist 10 or 4  <br/>
years old. Children learn all the time. Then it could have ideas and  <br/>
tips on what to do with kids that age, how does it look like when  <br/>
parents who embrace unschooling have kids that are so young that  <br/>
&quot;school&quot; isn&#39;t an option anyway. Do they still act differently, do  <br/>
they see their kid&#39;s &quot;learning&quot; in a different way, does anything  <br/>
change when they turn 6....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading,<br/>
<br/>
Johanna</div>
