<div id="ygrps-yiv-284591237">Today I saw a preview for a new show called &quot;Kid Nation&quot;   it&#39;s a reality show where they have taken a bunch of kids and let them form their own &quot;nation&quot; on their own.   I am sure there will be interference from adults somewhere along the way but the premise is good!    They are supposed to be letting the kids form their own rules, governing system , ways of running everything and so forth.   <br/>
Perhaps it might show a little bit about how kids if left alone can manage just fine without adults interfering in everything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046729122">Someone mentioned this at parkday this week -- I hadn&#39;t heard of it yet, but I looked up the link and watched the promo video.  <br/>
   <br/>
  From the website at CBS.com --<br/>
   <br/>
  They [the kids] will confront grown-up issues while coping with the classic childhood emotions of homesickness, peer pressure and the urge to break every rule. Episodes end with a town meeting in which the kids award one child a gold star worth $20,000, all leading to the grand finale, with an unimaginable test, the biggest awards and a special surprise for every child.<br/>
   <br/>
  It goes on to describe how the kids will be broken up into 4 categories  laborer, cook, merchant, upper class -- with jobs decided by showdowns, kid against kid to determine each childs paycheck and role. The kids in the video are wearing bandannas with a particular color by their class. <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s set and being filmed just up the road from us, between San Felipe Pueblo and Santa Fe, in an old mining ghost town from the 1880&#39;s called Bonanza City. <br/>
   <br/>
  I wont be watching it  first, Im not a fan of reality TV -- second (or maybe first) there were several crying kids just in the promo video clip. Kids screaming at each other, one little girl who said &quot;I&#39;m a beauty queen -- I don&#39;t do work.&quot;  Later in the clip, the same girl says &quot;the upper class is king and queen.&quot;  By the end of the clip, that little girl is crying at a town meeting while the other kids tell her she can&#39;t punish them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Remember, tho, these are school kids with all controls lifted for a desperate period of 40 days, away from their families, homesick and afraid.  It probably makes for great &#39;reality TV&#39; but it sounds and looks just too painful to watch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989178343">There is a real childrens Republic called Benposta, I<br/>
believe one in Galicia, Spain and also in Columbia. It<br/>
is similar to a Sudbury Valley concept in that the<br/>
children are part of living together in a democracy<br/>
and have the same rights as the adults. Most kids<br/>
there are orphans or come from abusive homes etc. The<br/>
childrens circus &#39; los muchachos&#39; is one of my most<br/>
memorable childhood memories, it touched me deaply and<br/>
I never forgot it - well worth the &#39;google&#39;. <br/>
Love,<br/>
