<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594896903">Referring to the recent thread, &quot;Looking for Insights&quot;---not to pick on <br/>
the original poster because it happens a lot---But I just want to point <br/>
out that that doesn&#39;t really give us a clue as to what the subject <br/>
matter IS.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even remember what the original subject WAS! &lt;g&gt; Things morph <br/>
so much here!<br/>
<br/>
But *if* the original issue were speech concerns, entitling it &quot;speech <br/>
concerns&quot; would help members focus and keep from deleting or bypassing. <br/>
Gail could have chimed in---and *would* have if she had seen it. But I <br/>
know how busy she is *right now* and that she&#39;s probably deleting a lot <br/>
without bothering to read. I tend to gloss over posts with &quot;sibling&quot; in <br/>
the title. (I read everything because it&#39;s my list, but I don&#39;t focus <br/>
on everything necessarily). But if Gail had seen &quot;speech&quot; in the title, <br/>
she would have locked on immediately.<br/>
<br/>
So being more specific in our titles/subject matter can be really, <br/>
really helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if the subject *does* morph, changing the subject line is equally <br/>
as helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks---and back to you regularly schedule elist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135299622">Actually she has more then one topic and they seemed to be related to each<br/>
other. I don&#39;t know which is harder one morphing subject or multiple topics<br/>
on the same child and having to flip back and forth to get the whole story.<br/>
