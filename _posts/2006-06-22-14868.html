<div id="ygrps-yiv-5935347">Hello to all,<br/>
<br/>
I need a little advise.  My DD (6) has a homeschool friend from our group whom she has <br/>
been spending a lot of time with.  The girl is (8) and they have recently had a sleepover <br/>
together.  <br/>
<br/>
This situation seems very complex but I&#39;ll try and keep it simple.  <br/>
<br/>
 During their sleep over the friend chewed on some art pencils that are very important to <br/>
my daughter.  She asked her to stop and she didn&#39;t.  The friend didn&#39;t seem to want to <br/>
take any responsiblity for her actions and while my daughter was cying asked me to make <br/>
her stop.  I told her that I couldn&#39;t stop her from being upset because that was how she <br/>
was feeling.<br/>
<br/>
After my daughter calmed down she asked for something to eat.  After eating they began <br/>
to play and watch T.V. together.  I checked with my daughter to see if everything was o.k.. <br/>
and she said yes.<br/>
<br/>
Since then my daughter has asked for a hampster and her friend offered her a cage.  My <br/>
daughter agreed to include her friend in getting the hampster.  Since then the girl has <br/>
called many times to tell my daughter how to care for it, how much money she needs from <br/>
me, that she has a list of names she should choose from.  These calls began to upset my <br/>
daughter - she felt as though her friend was trying to control the situation.  This is <br/>
probably a fair to say.  <br/>
<br/>
I noticed that my daughter was acting out.  I kept checking in with her about having the <br/>
girl participate in selecting the pet and she kept saying that she wanted her to come.<br/>
<br/>
The night before my daughter seemed especially on edge, she finally admitted that she <br/>
didn&#39;t want the girl to come.  Early in the day she said that she was afraid that the girl <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to be her friend anymore.  She feels like the friend is telling her what to do <br/>
and also brought up the situation from the sleepover.  My daughter feels the girl is telling <br/>
me to shut her up when she cries.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to the girls mother, she understood but sent an email the next day that the girl <br/>
was upset, crying all night and into the morning.  The girl feels betrayed by my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls mother and I hope there is something to be learned by all in the situation.  Both <br/>
girls seem too upset right now to heal the situation easily.  Just wondering if anyone has <br/>
any advise.  <br/>
<br/>
We are in a very small homeschool group with this family and would like to try and figure <br/>
something out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
