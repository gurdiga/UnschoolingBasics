I really enjoyed the book &quot;Whatever Happened to Penny Candy&quot; by Richard<br/>
Maybury.  The outside says, &quot;A fast, clear and fun explanation of the<br/>
economics you need for success in your career, business, and investments.&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s good to know.  It&#39;s been a while since I read it and I remember not<br/>
agreeing with everything in the book, but I also learned a lot from it. <br/>
