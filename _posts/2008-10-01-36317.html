<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637055278">In my addled state, I neglected to say WHERE it was going to be. (Thanks to  <br/>
the person who pointed that out!)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I am pleased to announce that there will be a 2009 Northeast Unschooling  <br/>
Conference. It&#39;ll take place August 27-30, 2009 at the Sheraton Colonial Hotel  <br/>
in Wakefield, Massschusetts, just north of Boston. Yep, we&#39;re adding another  <br/>
day! We&#39;ll also have a brand new location with lots of space and amenities <br/>
(Huge  health club with Olympic sized pool and tennis courts, free Internet in  <br/>
conference attendee rooms, and lots more).  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll have more details for you soon, but I wanted to make sure people got  it <br/>
into their calendars. The new web site will be up soon, assuming strange  <br/>
things don&#39;t happen.<br/>

Obviously the How is eluding her right now<br/>
