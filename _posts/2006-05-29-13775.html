 <br/>
It was very nice meeting you!<br/>
I had a few conversations this weekend and longed for radical unschooling  <br/>
discussions.<br/>
Thank you for being so open in your thoughts while also open to my own. <br/>
 <br/>
It was nice to be mentioned (Kelly thank you for mentioning the interview  <br/>
and dogs),known <br/>
and remembered even if I am a shit disturber I know I sparked conversation  <br/>
even if some of it was about me without me : )* I only regret not being  able <br/>
to discuss my position... <br/>
 <br/>
My head almost spun off once when someone discussed bringing curriculum  into <br/>
their home for their introverted kids.  I seriously did a double  take <br/>
looking for a familiar unschooling face.  I wanted to discuss  that further as a <br/>
radical unschooler with a couple introverted children but I  couldn&#39;t come up <br/>
with a starting statement quick enough before the session  ended.<br/>
 <br/>
Diversity and strewing came up this weekend. By the way Kelly... Every time  <br/>
you said strewing I was back there laughing bc it sounded like screwing as it  <br/>
did when I was on the radio. I think that&#39;s why he asked me to spell it bc it <br/>
 does sound soo close to screwing..  <br/>
I&#39;d love to discuss the two further on some list..<br/>
 <br/>
We had a great time and met many people. Dustin had a great time and  finally <br/>
hooked up with the teens he had wanted to meet in 2004. I got photos too  yay!<br/>
I realized how radical I am and how much we have progressed since the  <br/>
beginning in 99 and more since 2004. I&#39;m not sure where being anymore radical  can <br/>
lead us but I will say this feels so right for my family. <br/>

&lt;&lt;We (well, mostly me!) were at the conference this weekend  (we live <br/>
15mins away, so didn&#39;t stay over).  It was great to meet so  many <br/>
people I had met here first (Ren, Kelly, Ben, Rue, Tonya (MA), Laura  <br/>
(ME), Carol (ME), Marji (NY))!  My dh attended Ben&#39;s dad&#39;s group  <br/>
(SSUDs - Secret Society of Unschooling Dads) and it was worth the  <br/>
price of admission just to have him be there for that!<br/>
<br/>
I never  found Robin (ohpurple) from the Cape, Sarah (ME) who planned <br/>
to camp at  Harold Parker State forest, or Deb Rossing <br/>
(soggyboysmom) - did you guys  make it?   Maybe another time!<br/>
<br/>
My dd discovered that one of  the older teens she met there was <br/>
someone she knew from when she used to  take karate and is a life-<br/>
long unschooler!  We had no idea!   Small world!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Kathryn and Beth for organizing this  event!<br/>

Hi Jann,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry we didn&#39;t connect.  We were there and had a fabulous time.  Hubby <br/>
coasted through the day and I kept asking him if anything clicked yet and he kept <br/>
responding--&quot;kind of.&quot;  Then he went to Ben&#39;s session and came out transformed. <br/>
 He gets it!  <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed all the sessions and enjoyed putting faces with your names.  <br/>
Thanks to everyone on this list for all your guidance and sometimes brutally <br/>
honest help. Ren, Kelly, Mrs. Petri :), Kathryn, Beth and everyone who my <br/>
tired brain is forgetting to include--Thank you for sharing your wisdom at the <br/>
conference.  Its been just what we needed and it all makes so much sense.  We are <br/>
better parents because of you.  I mean it.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t opened Rue&#39;s book yet but I caught hubby reading it this morning.  <br/>
<br/>
The MOST remarkable memories I took home from this conference were the times <br/>
spent among all your amazing unschooled offspring.  What a relief that they <br/>
are all so confident and friendly, talented, loving, pleasant and wonderful!  <br/>
From the wee ones to the teens, I loved them all and it was very reassuring <br/>
being around them.  I want my kids to turn out just like them--Happy!  All day, my <br/>
kids kept saying -- he&#39;s so nice, she&#39;s so nice, etc.  The kids were all so <br/>
nice they amazed us and filled our hearts with joy.  They also covered my body <br/>
in hug buttons and henna.  Real art!<br/>
<br/>
What a better world we will all have because of freedom.  Thank you, thank <br/>
you, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I am inspired and changed forever.  Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Peace, joy and big hugs, <br/>
Robin <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It was nice finally meeting you too Laura! This is all very new to <br/>
us, and although my mind is fully there, putting it all in practice <br/>
has a way to go!   Rest assured, this is not the last time we will <br/>
be together, and we always have here, or email, to communicate!  We <br/>
should definitely try to get our kids together sometime (I&#39;ll keep <br/>
you posted if we come up your way camping - we WILL be at Danforth <br/>
Bay near Ossipee in a couple of weeks!)<br/>

<br/>
Missed this one!  I, too, have an introverted child so I can <br/>
relate!   I&#39;m better at writing out my thoughts, when I have time to <br/>
reflect, than I am in person, and I know that&#39;s mostly because we&#39;re <br/>
still so new to all of this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I got photos too yay!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ya know, I brought my camera, but do ya think I took any pictures? <br/>
(no!).  It sure would help recogizing new faces if we posted them <br/>
here (or sent them ahead of time!)!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t say we&#39;re radical yet, but definitely in a better place than <br/>
we were a year ago!   You hit the nail on the head, it&#39;s what feel <br/>
right for your family, and that&#39;s the most important thing of all.<br/>

Glad you made it Robin and I&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t hook up, but there&#39;s <br/>
always another time!  We get down to the Cape once in a while so <br/>
that&#39;s always a possibility!   We&#39;ve got a ways to go here, but dh <br/>
meeting Ben and the other dads DEFINITELY helped!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup - we were there. Spent lots of time waterlogged - my cool henna <br/>
tattoos (thanks Sonali!) are already mostly faded off because of all <br/>
the time in the pool. I was at the Whole life unschooling with kids <br/>
under 10 discussion group until about noon, then I slipped out as the <br/>
discussion was still rolling and my stomach was about to grumble (and <br/>
my guys were waiting for me so we could do lunch). DH and I were at <br/>
the keynote while DS and a friend hung out in our room with their <br/>
Gameboys. We also popped in to the playdough time and DS spent time in <br/>
the toy room with and without us. DH was at the SSUDS gathering and <br/>
stopped in on the duct tape funshop while I was at the Zen of <br/>
Unschooling talk.<br/>
