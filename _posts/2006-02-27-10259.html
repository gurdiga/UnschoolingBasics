<div id="ygrps-yiv-21903626">I know another post so soon.  My daughter was just reading over my shoulder and asked if <br/>
there are other groups like this for kids, so she could talk to other new unschoolers about <br/>
HER concerns?  Any ideas, she has never been in a &quot;chat room&quot; and really doesn&#39;t use the <br/>
computer much, but if it was safe i would encourage it. Thanks again Melanie in VT</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Melanie,<br/>
My daughters are ALWAYS asking this sort of question. They are, soon to be 11 <br/>
(April 2) and 12. I was always concerned about the safety issues also, but I <br/>
too would encourage if I knew it was safe. They would love to be able to <br/>
communicate with other UNschoolers. They tell me they don&#39;t miss school at all but <br/>
that they do wish there were more unschoolers around to talk to. <br/>

I have a new to unschooling 16-year-old that is interested in this as <br/>
well.  My son,12 and unschooling for years, may be interested if he <br/>
could find boys his age to talk about gaming and such.<br/>

Someone may have mentioned this already, but I&#39;d recommend getting to an  <br/>
unschooling conference if at all possible.  The kids have such a wonderful  time <br/>
and make great connections there. <br/>
 <br/>
 I have a 12 year old son very into gaming and a 16 year old daughter  (not <br/>
into gaming) but a big proponent of unschooling.  They both love to IM  <br/>
friends.  <br/>
 <br/>
Have you considered going to the Live and Learn Conference in Albuquerque  <br/>
this fall?<br/>
