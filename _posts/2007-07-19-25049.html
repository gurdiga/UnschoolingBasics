<div id="ygrps-yiv-689388805">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
I guess my biggest thing is getting over this fear that I have to be <br/>
doning something or pushing them in some direction or the other.  I <br/>
know I don&#39;t need to, the other day all on her own my 9 year old <br/>
started to build a paper castle 3D with all the little people made <br/>
out of clay.  No need for my suggestions and mine would never have <br/>
been so creative.  What kind of thigs do you have around the house.  <br/>
Any games or books for my self or the kids.  i have 7yr old, 9 almost <br/>
10yr old and 17yr old (the 17yr old just came from public school she <br/>
has chosen her own thing to do already)  All girls.  Do you try to <br/>
stay home to encourage creativity because if they get to busy they <br/>
tend to feel out of sorts or at least my 9yr old does.  My 7yr old <br/>
thrives on it so she leaves home a lot more.<br/>

interests! One of my strategies if we&#39;re going somewhere for Ray and <br/>
Mo needs to come along is to bring lots of things for her to do. <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve gone to the park looking like I&#39;m going on cross-<br/>
country drive with all the stuff in the car. I&#39;ve also come to <br/>
expect a day of decompression for Mo after a big outing - it <br/>
sometimes takes her a whole day to settle back into her projects.<br/>

is there, its not that you need to encourage it so much as create <br/>

tape are the staple goods here. I have a whole bunch of &quot;project&quot; <br/>
type books that I&#39;ve picked up at yardsales, library sales and <br/>
occasionally even retail. Anything with a whole bunch of projects - <br/>
arts, nature, science, math, sewing, cookbooks... they all float <br/>
around the house and sometimes one of us will pick one up and <br/>
browse. Maybe not even for an actual project, just an idea, a way to <br/>
use a material or tool, or an excuse to snuggle up with a book. Some <br/>
of the older books are facinating just for the clothes and hair <br/>
styles - and the old computers, what a hoot!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of computers, Mo does a certain amount of bonding over <br/>
computer and video games. We take turns playing games on the PS2, <br/>
and she and her gal-pal like to play Nick Jr games on the computer <br/>
when we go over there (ours is sssllllooooow). For older or less <br/>
competitive kids, Sims type games can be a lot of fun and foster <br/>
some connections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003511829">Okay, here is the deal.  I am home about 3-4 days a week with out <br/>
leaving.  The older one would stay home 24/7 and the younger would be <br/>
gone all the time.  My older one always brings a note book or a book <br/>
to read when she knows we are going somewhere she does not like to <br/>
go.  My younger one is always complaing of boredom at home... this is <br/>
frustrating.  I wish she would find something that really interested <br/>
her... but so far no hobbies.  She does like to play her cello and <br/>
dance, tried soccer, and gymnastics.  I do have loads of books, <br/>
encyclopedias, arts crafts, paint, yarn, you name it I have it (I <br/>
love to craft myself).  We live on a lake but she really just bounces <br/>
around.  Has a short attention span and loads of energy.  She loves <br/>
to help so I let her.  Shes very smart as they all are, just night <br/>
and day different from my 9yo.  We are trying differnt things to see <br/>
where some interest lies...she did check out a bunch of pengin books <br/>
from the library....I just think at times she is just a free spirit <br/>
and likes to bounce around..  sorry for the run on. I am thinking out <br/>
loud.<br/>
