<div id="ygrps-yiv-43698148">They usually play really well together, but there is a fair age gap,<br/>
about four years, so they are just far enough apart where they<br/>
communicate a little differently.  Obviously the youngest doesn&#39;t<br/>
communicate as well as the older.<br/>
Often my older seems like he just wants to start an arguement.  He<br/>
gets so frustrated when his little brother says something that he<br/>
feels isn&#39;t right.  We remind him fairly often that the arguement is<br/>
not going to help anyone but is only making them both angry.  It only<br/>
seems to happen if the older is already in a mood that facilitates<br/>
this arguementative attitude.  I want him to know his opinions are<br/>
valid and valuable without him feeling the need to argue and be<br/>
right/more right.<br/>
Another issue that is only similar in that it is train based is<br/>
bumping cars.  Anyone familiar with Thomas knows how often the<br/>
locomotives end up having to bump the troublesome trucks, though<br/>
usually the coaches are happy to follow along.<br/>
My youngest is more often an engine, instead of a little boy, and<br/>
momma and I have been &quot;bumped&quot; pretty hard sometimes.  He will come<br/>
jogging pretty quickly and give us a good jolt.  &quot;STOP HITTING US!&quot;<br/>
never worked, but I can generally calm him down by reminding him that<br/>
we aren&#39;t cars and don&#39;t need to be bumped.<br/>
The bumping isn&#39;t really a problem in and of itself.  The issue with<br/>
bumping is that sometimes, especially when you don&#39;t see it coming,<br/>
and with the harder bumps, he does have the ability to hurt someone. <br/>
I&#39;m always a little worried that the circumstances will work just so<br/>
that his bump pushes me into some body twist that throws my back out.<br/>
 While that may sound a bit farfetched, it is an actual concern.<br/>
I really think that with our patience I&#39;m seeing fewer instances of<br/>
either activity.  And I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m asking a question here<br/>
or not.</div>
