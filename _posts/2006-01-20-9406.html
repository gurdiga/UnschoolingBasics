<div id="ygrps-yiv-506792771">I was just about to do a library search for some of the other books I have<br/>
seen mentioned here and I realized I couldn&#39;t remember who poster(s) were.<br/>
That got me thinking...do they have a list of recommended books on<br/>
unschooling in the files section.  So I looked and nothing is there.  Can I<br/>
suggest that we start a database of recommended books that everyone can<br/>
enter into?  That way, when a person posts about a book they recommend, they<br/>
can put it in the database for future use.  <br/>

at AlwaysUnschooled, which I keep pretty much up to date with member <br/>
recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done a monthly book discussion in the past, but with my move and <br/>
then the holidays, it&#39;s gotten way off track. I need to yank it back on <br/>
track this month. Rue&#39;s book is coming up, I think. You can access that <br/>
list by clicking &quot;calendar&quot; then &quot;event list&quot;.<br/>
