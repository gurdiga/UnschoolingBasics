<div id="ygrps-yiv-484237627">Hi, I like the ideas behind unschooling but due to my own<br/>
limitations I found it very difficult emotionally to homeschool<br/>
K (I only have one child, a son).  He went to a private<br/>
school from gr. 1 through 6.  I guess I&#39;m not sure I could<br/>
unschool him.  I don&#39;t want him to be unhappy in school<br/>
and I would prefer an environs where he would be happy, creative,<br/>
learning and without all ther rote stuff and grades and pressures.<br/>
<br/>
However, I seem to need a LOT of time alone, and he and I<br/>
don&#39;t like to do the same things (which isn&#39;t wrong or that<br/>
unusual but it makes it harder).  <br/>
<br/>
I think most of the pressure I feel is self generated....he<br/>
is pretty happy left alone alot and likes to do video games<br/>
but I try to interest him in other things to get some balance.<br/>
<br/>
When he was younger I tried to spend a lot of time with him<br/>
because I was basically abandoned as a young child and I<br/>
didn&#39;t want him to feel lonely.  <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like to go most places with me so I end up feeling very<br/>
trapped.  I can leave him alone for some time now as he<br/>
is older but I have reservations about doing that.  He isn&#39;t<br/>
usually interested in taking little trips or going places although<br/>
in the summer he will go with me at times to a lake.<br/>
<br/>
At his age he has lost interest in playgrounds, which we used<br/>
to go to when he was younger.  <br/>
<br/>
He and I like DVDs at time, and he really likes video games.<br/>
<br/>
I am also concerned about what his school experience is doing<br/>
to him.  I am going to tell him to forget about the grade pressure<br/>
entirely......I have tried tutoring, and last year (grade 6, first<br/>
year of middle school) he got several Fs even though he did all<br/>
his homework, something about his handwriting...<br/>
<br/>
I feel they are too uptight about the details....not that it<br/>
is wrong, but it isn&#39;t the best thing for him.  <br/>
<br/>
I think he would be less uptight about school if I honestly<br/>
forget about grades......there is way too much pressure on<br/>
kids in this area in my opinion.....some kids are OK with it.<br/>
<br/>
I might be better with a more alternative type of school set up<br/>
but it&#39;s either not available or very expensive.  I&#39;m also looking<br/>
into homeschool centers where kids can take courses etc but<br/>
have more choice.  I realize that isn&#39;t the same as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any feedback, help etc.  <br/>
<br/>
There IS a big difference between grade K and age 5 and now,<br/>
at age 12.  However my son really likes to do whatever he wants<br/>
which isn&#39;t necessarily bad at all......when I &quot;homeschooled&quot;<br/>
in grade K I wasn&#39;t really familiar with the unschooling<br/>
concept....just finding it out.....so I thought I had to be in <br/>
control, and making certain things happen, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize unschooling would be different for different parents,<br/>
families, and children......<br/>
<br/>
There are support groups around here for home schooling which<br/>
aren&#39;t expensive although most of them are not doing un scholing per <br/>
se.  There are also some unschooling groups and centers<br/>
but the center is more expensive than his current private<br/>
Christian school.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any help or feedback?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

interests have started to expand beyond computer games he still <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to go anywhere that could be seen as a &quot;field trip&quot;. <br/>
That&#39;s awkward for me, since it leaves me sort of floundering for <br/>
(cheap to free) ideas, but we, as a family, have found some other <br/>
ways for him to have outings that he enjoys. Solutions of this kind <br/>
are going to be unique to families, to some extent, but its worth <br/>
considering what kinds of resources you may be able to call on, <br/>
including human resources. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Balance isn&#39;t necessarily something he needs. That may be a <br/>
surprising statement, but this idea of &quot;the well rounded child&quot; is <br/>
just an idea. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with the <br/>
real needs of real individual kids. If he *needed* to be doing a <br/>
dozen different things, he&#39;d be asking for that in some way.<br/>
<br/>
Its really hard to say how things would look if he wasn&#39;t in school <br/>
because there&#39;s so much of his thinking and behavior tied up in <br/>
school right now. When he&#39;s home he&#39;s home From School. When he&#39;s on <br/>
vacation, its From School. So school and his feelings about school <br/>
and reactions to school are coloring everything he does. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, I seem to need a LOT of time alone, and he and I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does make it harder - how hard are you willing to work for the <br/>
sake of your relationship with your son? That&#39;s not meant to be <br/>
either rhetorical or snarky, its something to think about really <br/>
hard. There&#39;s a big cultural expectation that our primary job as <br/>
parents is to prepare kids for life - and their happiness will, <br/>
presumably take care of itself along the way. Unschooling comes from <br/>
the perspective that our job is to build a partnership with our <br/>
kids - and part of that is helping our partners be happy in their <br/>
lives right now. That&#39;s a pretty big shift in expectations, and <br/>
takes a lot of internal work on the part of the parents. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t share a lot of interests with my stepson, so I have to work <br/>
harder to connect with him, to find out about him, to understand his <br/>
likes and dislikes and passions. He&#39;s still pretty baffling to me <br/>
sometimes, and I still worry that I&#39;m not really doing &quot;enough&quot;. Its <br/>
a process. <br/>

I was in a very similar boat. We pulled Cameron out of a private prep <br/>
school just after sixth grade.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I might be better with a more alternative type of school set up<br/>

<br/>
SO why are you looking at them? For social reasons?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>

aren&#39;t expensive although most of them are not doing un scholing per<br/>

Where are you? Finding other unschoolers to hang iwth would help a LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Mostly just let him heal right now. The scars from school are still <br/>
fresh and painful. He needs time to lick his wounds before he can get <br/>
back out to explore. There&#39;s really no short cut there!<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of time to veg-out and play alone (although you should <br/>
still interact with him and offer new, exciting things---he&#39;ll just <br/>
have to let you know when he&#39;s ready!). He may feel &quot;less than&quot; for a <br/>
while because he&#39;s not cramming Shakespeare and algebra like his <br/>
schooled friends, but his love of learning will return in time.<br/>
<br/>
Trust. Patience. Respect. Generosity.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s 19 now---and it was a rough ride at first, but he&#39;s been a <br/>
different child for so long now that we forget how hard those first 18 <br/>
months or so actually were!<br/>
