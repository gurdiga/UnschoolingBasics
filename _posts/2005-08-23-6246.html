This is a serious question. )&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called balance. It&#39;s called acceptance of the fact that we <br/>
control no one other than ourselves. If we truly and totally accept <br/>
that each person must make their own decisions, that our own ideas <br/>
may not be best for our children, then-and only then-can we help <br/>
them navigate these life experiences with balance and without fear.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make sex and alcohol some taboo topic. I don&#39;t limit the <br/>
things they feel ready to watch or discuss. My children have taken <br/>
sips of our drinks whenever they&#39;ve asked, they could care less <br/>
about sneaking anything.<br/>
My oldest (15.5) thinks it&#39;s pretty hilarious that other teens will <br/>
go to such lengths to drink. He has no attraction to it because it&#39;s <br/>
just another thing in life, not some forbidden fruit.<br/>
<br/>
I discuss sex with them as an experience in life that&#39;s truly <br/>
wonderful, something that has risks you should know about, something <br/>
that I trust them to decide about just as they do everything else. <br/>
Takes away all that fascination when you approach it with balance, <br/>
yk?<br/>

Cameron&#39;s 17. He&#39;s &quot;allowed&quot; to do whatever he wants. I&#39;m not so stupid <br/>
that I think I *could* stop him. His friends&#39; parents think that they <br/>
can forbid things and have their children not do anything that was <br/>
forbidden. I won&#39;t fall for that silliness. That has just made his <br/>
friends dishonest with their parents. They sneak and lie.<br/>
<br/>
He may drink, but doesn&#39;t---maybe a glass of wine with supper some <br/>
nights. He doesn&#39;t like beer or hard liquor. There&#39;s always beer and <br/>
wine and champagne in our &#39;frig&#39; and hard liquor in the cupboard. No <br/>
stealing. No lying.<br/>
<br/>
He smokes pot---well, he did. Since NBTSC, he&#39;s quit----I take that <br/>
back. I just asked---he&#39;s cut back a lot. He&#39;s a member of  NORML. He&#39;s <br/>
tried mushrooms---scared me to DEATH. I asked that he not do that any <br/>
more----that&#39;s just plain dangerous. Only two kinds of mushroom <br/>
hunters---*very* good ones and dead ones. He&#39;s quit that. Mostly <br/>
because of our talks about it---then he looked it up online.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking him these things as we&#39;re watching &quot;That 70s Show.&quot; He&#39;s <br/>
honest with me because he knows that he won&#39;t be lectured or punished. <br/>
We talk a lot. A LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Sex. He has a girlfriend for almost 2.5 years now. Yes, the are <br/>
sexually active. We&#39;ve talked about birth control and STDs. He (and the <br/>
neighbor children) have had access to condoms for years now. I&#39;ve kept <br/>
them in a closet upstairs since he was 13/14. He gets a box in his <br/>
Christmas stocking. His girlfriend is on the pil (they use both). We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about sex and marriage and children and well---anything he wants <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you *can* stop a teen? The best you can do is to be honest <br/>
and open. To talk a lot. If you trust them, they will trust you and be <br/>
honest and open with you.<br/>
<br/>
If Cam were to wind up in the emergency room, I could answer the doctor <br/>
honestly because *I* know. If he winds up in a bad situation, he can <br/>
call me at any hour and know I&#39;ll be there to pick him up. He&#39;s never <br/>
driven high. How do I know? Because he&#39;s called me to pick him up when <br/>
he felt too out of it to drive home safely.<br/>
<br/>
Safety is *much* more important than being the parent who has all the <br/>
power. My child doesn&#39;t fear me, so he&#39;s willing to share much more of <br/>
himself with me.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s kind and gentle and honest and generous and real. He trusts me, <br/>
and I trust him. He&#39;s wonderful.<br/>

Could I just second that  :-)....I hope when my daughter has a  relationship <br/>
that it is with someone just like him.  I hope my  relationship with my own <br/>

I&#39;m going to take this opportunity to plug my own conference (take a <br/>
hint, Rue! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Gail&#39;s complimenting me and Cameron (thanks! &lt;g&gt;)---but that couldn&#39;t <br/>
have happened without the opportunity to meet other unschoolers. ( I <br/>
guess she could have made the compliment---but I&#39;m talking about <br/>
*knowing* us! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell you how incredibly powerful it is to be surrounded by <br/>
other unschoolers and to see the interaction between the parents and <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
We can talk about our kids and our relationships with them---but how do <br/>
*you* know it&#39;s real? Actually seeing it for yourself is priceless!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re waffling about attending, please think about this. Maybe not <br/>
this year&#39;s conf, but consider attending one in the future---or a <br/>
mini-conference in your area next spring (I&#39;m working on those! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
Knowing that we&#39;re not just blowing a lot of smoke up your butt will <br/>
help you jump into unschooling wholly and completely.<br/>
<br/>
It really works! No kidding! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
