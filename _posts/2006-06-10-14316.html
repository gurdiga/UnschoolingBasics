<div id="ygrps-yiv-645241865">Another post from Leslie Moyer:<br/>
<br/>
It was either Barb or Sandy who first broached the topic of<br/>
&quot;alternatives to college&quot; and said it was something not discussed as<br/>
often. I had to laugh because it&#39;s all I hear about in unschooling<br/>
circles....i.e. &quot;not going to college&quot; seems almost *more* acceptable<br/>
than &quot;going to college.&quot; Guess it&#39;s who you hang with.... :-)<br/>
<br/>
I, like Joy, read and pass along to my kids John Anderson&#39;s stuff on <br/>
the<br/>
topic of college. I struggled for a long time about whether or not I<br/>
&quot;wanted&quot; college for my kids. I was trying to search the deep recesses<br/>
of my heart for what I truly felt about college so that I might not <br/>
pass<br/>
along my biases. (Personally, I *hated* college when I went....their<br/>
dad loved it.....my unschooling passion tells me it&#39;s worse than a <br/>
waste<br/>
of time....my fear is that it will corrupt their life-long joy of<br/>
learning....etc.) Then I remembered it wasn&#39;t my decision. :-) I did<br/>
what I could to pass along the &quot;pros&quot; and &quot;cons&quot; of college so that my<br/>
kids could--as always--have the information they needed to make their<br/>
own decisions about their lives.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (Matt) just finished his first year at a small private <br/>
college<br/>
& *loved* it. My second &quot;child&quot; (Sarah) is 17 and happily planning to<br/>
go to college, too. They both had/have a very strong desire to go to<br/>
college. I don&#39;t exactly know where that desire is rooted, but I do<br/>
think they see it partially as a &quot;rite of passage&quot;. Rightly or<br/>
wrongly. I think their reasons have more to do with social stuff rather<br/>
than educational stuff, though....and, to me, neither one is more or<br/>
less important than the other. In Matt&#39;s case I think it was a<br/>
&quot;successful&quot; rite of passage--he has matured in ways I didn&#39;t<br/>
expect.....he made lots of friends, but they&#39;re much closer friendships<br/>
than what he has had before...his friends now have much more in common<br/>
with him than his friends in the small (conservative) town where we<br/>
live. Also, the biggest surprise is how his relationship with me has<br/>
matured.<br/>
<br/>
He is enjoying the stimulating educational environment....he&#39;s had<br/>
mostly very good professors & he&#39;s excelling in his field of interest<br/>
(computer science)--setting the curve in those classes. (He also has a<br/>
second major in math....my son who doesn&#39;t have his multiplication<br/>
tables memorized and still has problems with long division &lt;g&gt;....and<br/>
doing terrific in his advanced math courses--a 4.0 this semester...and<br/>
he&#39;s the math club secretary & webmaster.) Matt has always been very<br/>
private about his learning & he&#39;s very intelligent. He hasn&#39;t really<br/>
had other people to talk with about his interests who could really<br/>
understand what he was talking about....no one to share his interests<br/>
with. He&#39;s finding that--and more--at college. He&#39;s benefiting from<br/>
that educationally and socially.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps my kids look to college as a rite of passage because society<br/>
doesn&#39;t value many other alternatives (though our family does) and as<br/>
homeschoolers we didn&#39;t have the usual -- &quot;graduation&quot;? Perhaps they<br/>
might not feel so strongly about college if I was able to show them<br/>
different rites of passage that felt like &quot;growing up&quot;? Just as a<br/>
personal trait, I&#39;m not good with celebrations or traditions or other<br/>
rites of passage (I find them stifling). I think they were influenced<br/>
by their friendships, too....their friends either went to college and<br/>
enjoyed it or they didn&#39;t go and were working at jobs where they aren&#39;t<br/>
particularly happy or challenged. I don&#39;t know why they wanted to go to<br/>
college so much--I&#39;ve asked and not gotten a very complex<br/>
response....perhaps they don&#39;t even know why.<br/>
<br/>
Both Matt & Sarah have done a fabulous job of finding colleges that<br/>
&quot;fit&quot; them. (Proven true for Matt--as yet to be seen for Sarah, but<br/>
it&#39;s looking great from my perspective.) For one thing, unschooling has<br/>
allowed both of them to really *know* themselves--to know what they <br/>
want<br/>
to do with their lives. They&#39;ve had a lot of time to explore their<br/>
interests & they both have a pretty good idea of how they want to spend<br/>
their young adult lives. They&#39;ve been able to find colleges that can<br/>
truly support and encourage those interests, I think. In addition, they<br/>
both looked for small colleges--my bias is certainly in favor of &quot;small<br/>
college&quot; over &quot;big university&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the college-money issue goes, Matt is attending college on a<br/>
full scholarship--tuition, room & board--at a smallish private college.<br/>
He was offered another scholarship at a different college for full<br/>
tuition. (In that case, he competed via a project & presentation.) He<br/>
applied to quite a few colleges (a dozen?) & was offered scholarships <br/>
at<br/>
all he was accepted to--in three cases, the best scholarship they had.<br/>
(He applied to so many because he was &quot;shopping&quot; <br/>
scholarships--something<br/>
I&#39;d recommend as it paid off greatly for him--scholarship offers varied<br/>
widely.) He had a very good ACT score--he studied for it using the ACT<br/>
test prep books & software--and his &quot;extracurricular&quot; (I use the word<br/>
tongue-in-cheek) activities (Eagle Scout, volunteer, work) rounded out<br/>
his application. I&#39;m sure the ACT score weighed heavily....but<br/>
unschoolers *can* score well on the ACT if they prepare for it. Matt<br/>
was 100% radically unschooled....but he was highly motivated to attend<br/>
college and, therefore, highly motivated to score well on the ACT.<br/>
Basically, the same logic that allows us to accept the fact that<br/>
&quot;unschoolers can do well in college&quot; applies to taking the ACT, too.<br/>
Matt wanted to do well on the test so he studied for it. (As an FYI:<br/>
the ACT has only 3 questions on trigonometry....they&#39;re always the SAME<br/>
three questions....different numbers plug into them to give different<br/>
answers, but they&#39;re always the same three questions.....a test-taker<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to know trigonometry--they only have to know three <br/>
specific<br/>
equations to do well on that part of the ACT. This is the sort of thing<br/>
covered in the ACT test prep book.) He didn&#39;t study for the English<br/>
parts much--they came naturally from lots of reading.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah has taken the ACT once and didn&#39;t score terribly high, but good<br/>
enough to get into the community college for concurrent enrollment for<br/>
next year (her &quot;senior year in high school&quot;)....but not high enough to<br/>
take math classes there. But she doesn&#39;t enjoy math and it doesn&#39;t come<br/>
easily for her and she finds it difficult to study (it&#39;s &quot;boring&quot;). But<br/>
she&#39;s looking at colleges that value what SHE has to offer--strong<br/>
leadership skills, a fabulous & contagious attitude, a diverse array of<br/>
life experiences, and strong personal references. She&#39;s specifically<br/>
looking at colleges that don&#39;t put a strong emphasis (or in some cases,<br/>
ANY emphasis) on standardized test scores. She&#39;s also looking at a<br/>
couple of colleges that offer work programs in exchange for some of <br/>
your<br/>
tuition--greatly decreasing the cost of college. (She&#39;s off to take the<br/>
ACT for the second time tomorrow morning.) She&#39;s also hoping to work in<br/>
England from January to May & who knows how that might influence her<br/>
college plans?!<br/>

One book I&#39;d add to the two Barb sent is &quot;Cool Colleges: For the<br/>

I had a lot more to write but I started this early this morning and <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
now almost midnight and I&#39;ve had a long day in the interim!<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
