him/her express those to the hitter. Sometimes kids hit just to see <br/>
what will happen. Its how they learn about the world. Hearing a <br/>
firm &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t like that!&quot; *is* a real consequence. Its one more <br/>
piece of information about the world. <br/>
<br/>
A more elaborate reaction can sometimes be so interesting that it <br/>
leaves the hitter even more curious - wow! I wonder if that will <br/>
happen next time? so I try to keep things simple and to the point. <br/>

We are still working on this one. My sons are 5&7.  The oldest has <br/>
done things like smack his brother in the head just walking by.  <br/>
Pardon the bad analogy, but it reminds me of the way a dog asserts <br/>
his dominance over another dog.  He might look at the other dog and <br/>
growl.  Or put his mouth over the more submissive dog&#39;s muzzle and <br/>
hold him down.  I think it has to do with maintaining control and <br/>
staying at the top of the pecking order.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that aggressive boy behaviors are what many people try <br/>
to excuse with &quot;boys will be boys&quot; or fix with &quot;they just need more <br/>
discipline.&quot;  From my experience, aggression comes from a feeling of <br/>
powerlessness (which more discipline only exacerbates).  The more <br/>
empowered a child feels over his life, the less he needs to control <br/>
or feel powerful over other kids.  As I said, we are still working <br/>
on this one.  A lot of ds&#39;s aggression these days is verbal - mostly <br/>
aimed at his brother.  I know he is working through his <br/>
own &quot;therapy&quot; of sorts.  But it is hard to know how to intervene.  <br/>
If I tell my older ds to stop or if I glare at him or have a talk <br/>
with him about how he treats his brother all day, it alienates him.  <br/>
He feels left out and frustrated and unwanted.  It actually makes <br/>
the problem worse (because he uses his brother as a scape goat for <br/>
whatever problem he is having). At the same time, I need my younger <br/>
ds to feel safe. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen real progress with both of them through peaceful <br/>
parenting.  But the aggression hasn&#39;t completely gone away.  I guess <br/>
it is just part of who we are right now -- something we will all <br/>
grow through.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the 3yo? Sounds pretty normal to me. 3s don&#39;t have much in <br/>
the way of communication skills, yet, so kicking, hitting, spitting, <br/>
are ways to explore the world of how people react *and* explore <br/>
different ways of self-expression. Frustrating, to be sure, but not <br/>
a sign of something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest looking for ways to rearrange your time so you are right <br/>
there with the kids as much as possible - even right down on the <br/>
floor with them, not puttering around trying to get things done. If <br/>
you are *there* you will have a much better understanding of what&#39;s <br/>
going on - is the 3yo frustrated or just curious? You can also help <br/>
the other child set better boundaries and communicate his own needs. <br/>
