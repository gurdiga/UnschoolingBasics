<div id="ygrps-yiv-363415038">===&gt;I thought you would get a kick out of my husband&#39;s biggest <br/>
objections to homeschooling -  &quot;how will he learn to raise his hand <br/>
and line up?&quot;&lt;===<br/>
<br/>
Since I am fairly new to this group you may have all seen this list of &quot;The <br/>
Dumbest Things You Ever Heard About Homeschooling&quot; before but reading it again, <br/>
it still gave me a chuckle, thought you all might enjoy it also. I remember <br/>
once my sil said something similar to me: &quot;I just don&#39;t know how you can stand <br/>
being at home with your kids all day, it would drive me crazy!&quot; She is a <br/>
public school teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The Dumbest Thing YOU Ever Heard, Part 1 By Mike Farris<br/>
<br/>
My recent column requesting &quot;dumb statements&quot; people had made<br/>
regarding homeschooling yielded a bumper crop of lols (laugh out<br/>
loud) and a few rofls (rolling on the floor laughing). I got a<br/>
great number of wonderful entries - far too many to publish. Today&#39;s<br/>
column is the first of two.<br/>
Here are half of the top entries, this week&#39;s winners, and my<br/>
comments interspersed.<br/>
Here come the comments.<br/>
<br/>
From Kara Becker:<br/>
Our realtor learned we were home schooling. She commented about<br/>
the lack of social development that would result, but tried to still<br/>
be positive by adding, &quot;Even though they couldn&#39;t be realtors, thank<br/>
goodness that there are lot of jobs out there which don&#39;t require<br/>
people skills.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Thank you, Dale Carnegie (author of &quot;How to Win Friends and<br/>
Influence People&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A stranger said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think your children are being deprived<br/>
of the thrill of buying school supplies at Wal-Mart when everyone<br/>
else does?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Angela Blackman:<br/>
A friend who is a paralegal at a very busy law firm said, &quot;How can<br/>
you ever think you can keep up with having four kids at home?<br/>
Don&#39;t they just run you off your feet? I&#39;d be exhausted by the end<br/>
of the day.&quot;<br/>
Mike: It is a proven fact that assisting two lawyers is the<br/>
equivalent of having six kids or else tending a dozen snakes --<br/>
depending on the age of the lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
From Pamela Minerd:<br/>
My father asked, &quot;Will I have to bail you out of jail for this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
My neighbor was picking my brain about getting the public school to<br/>
challenge her first grader. She was concerned because my first<br/>
grader was already reading while her son of the same age was just<br/>
learning the sounds of letters. Nonetheless she challenged my home<br/>
schooling saying my son would still miss out. &quot;It&#39;s important for<br/>
him socially too. He needs to be offered drugs so he can turn them<br/>
down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Marci Zinn:<br/>
A family member said, &quot;You are just doing this for yourself so you<br/>
won&#39;t have to buy the kids any school clothes.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Working 8+ hours a day for 12+ years just smacks of<br/>
selfishness if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
A friend asked, &quot;Do you use books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Rose Mary Coffey:<br/>
When my husband told his mother that we were going to home school,<br/>
she replied, &quot;What makes Rose Mary think she has the right to teach<br/>
my grandchildren?&quot;<br/>
Mike: It&#39;s in the same clause of the Constitution which gives<br/>
grandmas the right to feed cookies and candy to the grandkids an<br/>
hour before being sent home for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
From the Karoutsos Family:<br/>
My six year old son was very fidgety in the dentist&#39;s chair.<br/>
Afterwards the dentist spoke to me and told me of his fidgetiness<br/>
and said, &quot;Your son did not sit still. It is possibly due to the<br/>
fact that you home school him.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I guess he thought that dentistry was so boring he would<br/>
branch out into child psychology.<br/>
<br/>
From Pam Hynes:<br/>
I told an old friend from high school how my son was able to<br/>
progress in each subject at his own rate. She earnestly<br/>
replied, &quot;What if he learns it all before he finishes high school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A female public school teacher said, &quot;Your son will turn out to be<br/>
much too feminine or gay because you home school him. Being with<br/>
his mother so much is not good for boys.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I guess that spending ages 5 through 12 with female public<br/>
school teachers would be better.<br/>
<br/>
From Laurie Winkelmann:<br/>
I took my daughter to a podiatrist who specialized in treating<br/>
plantar warts. I asked how children contracted these warts. He<br/>
told me that they often come from locker rooms or swimming pools.<br/>
When I told him that since we home school it wouldn&#39;t be a locker<br/>
room, but we do take a swimming class, he replied, &quot;Yup, home<br/>
schooling, that certainly explains it.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Sounds like someone needs to breath a little fresh air<br/>
between foot examinations.<br/>
<br/>
THIS WEEK&#39;S WINNER<br/>
<br/>
From Dawn Howey:<br/>
A Christian friend, &quot;God didn&#39;t homeschool Jesus, He sent Him away<br/>
to school.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I think the friend needs to be sent away to Sunday School.<br/>
<br/>
The Dumbest Thing YOU Ever Heard, Part 2<br/>
<br/>
From Susan Shay:<br/>
&quot;Won&#39;t they miss out on learning a lot of important stuff? I<br/>
mean, how will they ever learn to stand in line?&quot; (Similar<br/>
statements were made to Gita Schmitz and Kathi Kearney. All three<br/>
get tapes.)<br/>
Mike: Thank goodness for the rigorous standards of Goals 2000.<br/>
<br/>
From Tracy Pina:<br/>
An acquaintance said, &quot;Every kid has to get beat up a few times in<br/>
public school or they won&#39;t be able to cope in the real world.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Sticks and stones will break my bones or else I won&#39;t be well<br/>
rounded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Clarence and Barbara Hawkins:<br/>
A home school family in our town took their school days off in the<br/>
middle of the week to match the father&#39;s job schedule. Some nosey<br/>
neighbors had the family investigated for home schooling on Saturday!<br/>
Mike: Reminds me of the social services case I had in Alabama where<br/>
a mother was hotlined for allowing her children to read books in the<br/>
back of the van while she drove around town.<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;MY child is being a light in a dark place, but I<br/>
guess SOME children are not able to do that.&quot;<br/>
Mike: With that much condescension that lady probably fogs up her<br/>
own glasses.<br/>
<br/>
From Michelle Nichols:<br/>
A woman asked a home school friend of mine, &quot;If you don&#39;t send your<br/>
children to school, who is going to teach them their morals?&quot;<br/>
Mike: Yeah, like the moral necessity of beating up other kids on the<br/>
playground if we are to believe another comment we read.<br/>
<br/>
From Barb Palmer:<br/>
Our girls&#39; friends from the neighborhood ask, &quot;If you are home<br/>
schooled,who teaches you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;Won&#39;t your children miss the experience of the<br/>
goods and bads of dating people from other cultural and religious<br/>
backgrounds?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Char Brady:<br/>
A mother from my daughter&#39;s former public school class said, &quot;If<br/>
you were more involved in your child&#39;s education, then you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to home school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
An acquaintance asked, &quot;How can you possibly give them enough one-<br/>
on-one time?&quot;<br/>
Mike (stolen from MDT): I guess the kids would get more one-on-one<br/>
time in a classroom of 30.<br/>
<br/>
From &quot;Ozchick&quot;:<br/>
A friend asked me what we were going to do during a public school<br/>
snow day. I replied that we were going ahead with school. The friend<br/>
replied, &quot;That&#39;s silly. Why make your kids work since no one will be<br/>
around to grade their papers?&quot;<br/>
Not to be outdone, that same friend heard me describe how I was<br/>
teaching my children baking from the Colonial period. A recent<br/>
project was making a cake from scratch. She replied, &quot;Where can I<br/>
buy a box of scratch, I&#39;ve never heard of it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Nancy Persaud<br/>
(although this comment is not within the rules of the contest as<br/>
Nancy recognized, it is too good to pass up): From a 5th grade<br/>
geography textbook, &quot;Maps are smaller than the areas they represent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Dana Estes:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;I could NEVER home school my children. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine spending that much time with them.&quot; She is a public school<br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
AND THIS WEEK&#39;S WINNER:<br/>
<br/>
From Cherie Oliver:<br/>
My daughter was born three months early and had severe brain<br/>
damage. We were told to put her in a home and forget about her.<br/>
At the age of three the state said that &quot;special&quot; children needed to<br/>
be sent to the public school system so that they could get the<br/>
classes they needed. When I told them I was going to home school my<br/>
daughter, the school worker came unglued.<br/>
She said, &quot;But the state can make her into a better, more dependent<br/>
entity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is now a first grader who reads, writes, and does all<br/>
the other first grader things. She is the most independent six<br/>
year-old I know.<br/>
Mike: Incredible. Truly incredible.<br/>
<br/>
