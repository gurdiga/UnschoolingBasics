<div id="ygrps-yiv-172677960">~You see, I came to these unschooling lists to explore and learn and I<br/>
am happy to have lists like these to do so but I am being very honest<br/>
when I say that some of you come across very strongly with a sort of<br/>
elitism. ~<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re exploring and asking great questions, that&#39;s why we can<br/>
have an effective dialogue.:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not elitism as much as it&#39;s confidence. Strong confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Almost ALL of us come from a background of at least<br/>
spankings/punishments in our childhoods (some from much worse) and<br/>
have had a lot of years and experiences to re-learn this very<br/>
different way of parenting. It wasn&#39;t always instinctual to me, it<br/>
still isn&#39;t always instinctual, but becoming more so. At least it&#39;s<br/>
NOT my instinct to smack my children any longer....so people can<br/>
definitely overcome &quot;instinct&quot; (which is really environmental training<br/>
actually..I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s instinct to hurt your young).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is parenting is unschooling to me. It&#39;s all the same.<br/>
Learning is about all of life, not just &quot;education&quot;....so for us, the<br/>
journey is about being a better parent, a more effective parent a more<br/>
respectful parent. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think kindness is better than meanness.<br/>
Yes, I think peace is better than dischord.<br/>
Yes, I think respectful parenting is better than disrespectful parenting.<br/>
Yes, I think trusting our children fully is better than not trusting them.<br/>
Yes, I think unschooling is a better way of learning and life, but NO,<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t believe all of that, and fiercely, I wouldn&#39;t volunteer so<br/>
much of my time writing and talking and being an advocate for<br/>
unschooling.:) Also, I&#39;m not trying to get everyone to listen, I<br/>
really don&#39;t WANT to share with someone that doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
information. What a waste of time that would be (people learn what<br/>
they need, when they need it, sound familiar? :)) I am more than<br/>
willing to share with those that WANT information about unschooling<br/>
and gentle parenting.<br/>
<br/>
If it was elitism, I wouldn&#39;t think anyone else was worthy of joining.<br/>
If it was elitism, I would think myself better than others and NOT<br/>
share the information.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to share the information that has transformed our lives. I<br/>
WANT other people to get it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a better person, but I<br/>
think the ideals/philosophies are better..yep. Confidence, not elistism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well it feels like elitism to newcomers like me.  And it does not feel good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Unschooling is parenting is unschooling to me. It&#39;s all the same.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning is about all of life, not just &quot;education&quot;....so for us, the<br/>

respectful parent. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All is true of me despite the fact I am not an unschooler AND being a<br/>
better, more effective, more respectful human (not just parent) is a goal of<br/>
mine as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes, I think kindness is better than meanness.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just being honest to tell you I have not felt I have been treated with<br/>
kindness, peace, respect, or trust since speaking up in here.  Maybe you<br/>
reserve that only for your kids and others that perfectly subscribe to your<br/>
belief systems?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I didn&#39;t believe all of that, and fiercely, I wouldn&#39;t volunteer so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much of my time writing and talking and being an advocate for<br/>
unschooling.:)<br/>
<br/>
Well I do admire your passion and commitment.  I truly do.  But maybe fierce<br/>
is a god work because fierce is how some of you come across to me in here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I&#39;m not trying to get everyone to listen, I<br/>

willing to share with those that WANT information about unschooling<br/>
and gentle parenting.<br/>
<br/>
but Ren, I WANTED the info.  I came here to listen and learn and now ya lost<br/>
me, dear.  How many times must that happen and you guys are either oblivious<br/>
to it because lots of folks are not as vocal as I am  .or maybe you&#39;ll just<br/>
don&#39;t care.  I am only responding at this point in case you do care and in<br/>
case any of you are interested in altering your presentation even a little.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If it was elitism, I wouldn&#39;t think anyone else was worthy of joining.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it was elitism, I would think myself better than others and NOT<br/>
share the information.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I think it is elitism because the way newcomers are regarded (based on<br/>
my experience) is that WHEREEVER they are coming from, WHATEVER point they<br/>
are at currently, they are not worthy YET.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m trying to share the information that has transformed our lives. I<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well if you truly want to be an advocate for the information that has<br/>
transformed your lives, you better not go running people off.  I am far<br/>
harder to intimidate than most people, as a matter of fact, I don&#39;t really<br/>
feel intimidated at this point, I feel unfairly judged, disrespected by your<br/>
misinformed notions of me, bombarded in a rather incongruous way and just<br/>
generally offended and turned off. <br/>
