<div id="ygrps-yiv-983997793">The other night my two sons discovered something cool on our (2nd <br/>
floor) windows. It was dark outside and we had the lights on inside. <br/>
Some frogs were on the windows (outside), waiting for bugs and moths <br/>
that were attracted by the light from inside. We watched while the <br/>
frogs caught bugs, tried and missed, and once, even fell off the window <br/>
trying! The best though, was when DS, 9 (he&#39;ll be 10 Aug 31,)after <br/>
about 20 minutes of observing, said &quot;Boy, this is some entertainment!&quot;<br/>
 I, the mom who has been SO worried that darling kidlets will never <br/>
stop watching TV or playing XBOX, was SO excited to tell DH (who thinks <br/>
some of my US ideas are insane) about this. As some of you like to <br/>
say...&quot;WOOHOO!&quot;<br/>
(We went out to check on the frog who fell; he was fine, and already <br/>
climbing back up for dessert)<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share one of our baby steps toward being &quot;real&quot; <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745283306">We have glass sliding doors leading to our deck right behind our<br/>
dining room table.   Pretty frequently a little tree frog (or several)<br/>
can be found on the door looking for dinner which the lights on the<br/>
deck and the light from the dining room attract.   My kids get a kick<br/>
out of watching them having their dinner while we have our dinner!  <br/>
It&#39;s quite a show!<br/>

flying around security lights in particular, but also &quot;surfing&quot; along <br/>
the top edge of the light from headlights on the back roads. It can be <br/>
a bit of a driving hazzard...trying to watch the bats while driving I <br/>
mean. <br/>
