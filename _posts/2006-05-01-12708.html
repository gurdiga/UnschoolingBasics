<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500351003">I have to say in regards to Tristan beginning to learn how to read at <br/>
the age of 10 1/2..............The other day we drove by a gas <br/>
station/convenience store he said &quot;That is weird, that store is called <br/>
the food cart.&quot;  I turned to look and it was the Food Court.  Then <br/>
this morning my oldest tried to convince him that a box of soy <br/>
sausages were real sausage and Tristan said &quot;No it doesn&#39;t say that, <br/>
it says 70% less fat!&quot;  His brother can&#39;t pull one over on him <br/>
anymore!  Seems simple but it is exciting to see him learning how to <br/>
read so naturally.  He has had some frustration because his desire to <br/>
read came long before his readiness but it is just really neat to see <br/>
where he is at now with it.<br/>
