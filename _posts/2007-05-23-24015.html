<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079513723">Perhaps you could start by trying it for, say, a year.  Do you think <br/>
your husband might agree to that?  Your son is only 11, and it <br/>
sounds like he&#39;s had a really really rough time.  He&#39;s not going to <br/>
college or getting a job soon.  <br/>
<br/>
If you could take a year to focus on what brings your son joy, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful?  If he likes legos, buy him some new <br/>
ones just for a surprise.  Get him the Klutz book of paper <br/>
airplanes.  Stay home and watch movies and RELAX.  Give him the <br/>
chance to be himself again with no teasing, no painful writing, no <br/>
pressure, and definitely no talk about if you don&#39;t do such and <br/>
such, you&#39;re going back to school.  See what happens.  How could <br/>
things not improve?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since  the beginning of time. People (probably every creature)  <br/>
naturally learn by exploring the world, by ordering the world they  <br/>
encounter in ways that are personally meaningful to them.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt was the first to really observe it and write about it. He  <br/>
did so in order to try to change schools to make them better places  <br/>
to learn. You can see the progress in his thinking on that matter if  <br/>
you read his books in order. He eventually concluded that schools  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be fixed. School actually interfered in the process of   <br/>
learning. (Which is why we get the idea that learning is hard.  <br/>
Learning *is* hard when people are in an environment that is counter  <br/>
to the way we naturally learn.)<br/>
<br/>
As an engineer (in my former life) unschooling rubs me the wrong way.  <br/>
I like neat orderly learning. I like it all laid out for me in order  <br/>
with a clear beginning and end all tied up in a package that feels  <br/>
complete.<br/>
<br/>
But the artist/writer in me (honestly the two natures inside me have  <br/>
fights ;-) has been allowed to see that true, profound learning  <br/>
doesn&#39;t come from absorbing facts. It comes from making connections  <br/>
between seemingly disparate bits that have been experienced in context.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve dabbled a bit at Japanese history and it&#39;s given me insights  <br/>
into how kids have American and European history presented to them.  <br/>
Even history that&#39;s well written (which textbooks often aren&#39;t), if  <br/>
you don&#39;t have interesting connections already inside your head to  <br/>
who the people and places and times were, it reads like &quot;Abc attacked  <br/>
Xyz in 1178 in order to gain access to Pqr.&quot; It&#39;s just strings of  <br/>
this happened and that happened because this other thing happened.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been reading manga and watching anime (Japanese comics and  <br/>
cartoons) and references to the various times and people pop up.  <br/>
*Slowly* (since I&#39;m not immersed in the culture as a Japanese person  <br/>
would be) I&#39;m building up interesting connections to the important  <br/>
people and places. That&#39;s making them interesting. It&#39;s making them  <br/>
things I&#39;d like to know more (real) stuff about.<br/>
<br/>
The first is school learning. It needs to be repeated over and over  <br/>
until &quot;Abc attacked Xyz in 1178 in order to gain access to Pqr,&quot; is  <br/>
etched in the brain because it&#39;s meaningless without a meaningful  <br/>
context. It&#39;s hearing &quot;O-hayo&quot; = good morning over and over and over.  <br/>
And when there are several textbooks full of stuff that schools  <br/>
expect to pour into kids, it&#39;s not surprising that it takes 12 years  <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
The second is the way we naturally learn. We absorb interesting  <br/>
facts. We make connections to interesting facts. In school Columbus  <br/>
and Henry VIII and Shakespeare weren&#39;t even in the same classes. But  <br/>
by learning about them naturally I know that Columbus got money from  <br/>
the parents of one of Henry VIII&#39;s wives. And Elizabeth, the underdog  <br/>
for the rulership of England, was a sponsor of Shakespeare. And  <br/>
gunpowder came to Europe about the time of Columbus. There&#39;s also a  <br/>
clock in St. Mark&#39;s square that has been running since *before*  <br/>
Columbus discovered America. And there are 1000&#39;s of pigeons in St.  <br/>
Mark&#39;s Square. If you hold a cone of corn (that vendors sell) out  <br/>
they&#39;ll swoop down and cluster on your arm. (Which makes movies that  <br/>
have a scene in St. Mark&#39;s Square a lot more personally meaningful  <br/>
for me.) There are also dead rats that float in the canals and they  <br/>
smell really bad in July. There are also hundreds of cats living in  <br/>
the Coliseum in Rome that nearby residents feed (at least there were  <br/>
back in 1968).<br/>
<br/>
None of that is meaningful for a test. But it *is* meaningful for  <br/>
learning more in real life. The interesting connections make more  <br/>
information interesting.<br/>
<br/>
How often have kids asked, &quot;Is this going to be on the test? Do I  <br/>
have to learn this?&quot; (And how long do they retain it afterwards.) But  <br/>
when there is no test, when there is no force, it&#39;s all potentially  <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what is the ratio of unschoolers who attend college and complete it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. There aren&#39;t statistics. Which more than one husband  <br/>
has asked for!<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling girl who lives near me is currently attending Harvard.  <br/>
The Ivy Leagues *love* unschoolers because unschoolers have actually  <br/>
lived life and explored what fascinates them and are raring to know  <br/>
more rather than having spent 12 years absorbing textbooks to get  <br/>
great grades.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the ratio of schooled kids who attend college and complete it?  <br/>
The funny thing is that when kids do well in school, school is given  <br/>
credit with some going to the student for working hard. When kids  <br/>
don&#39;t do well, it&#39;s seen as the student&#39;s fault. From 12 years of  <br/>
doing and reading and writing about unschooling, I know it&#39;s not true  <br/>
and not that simple.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important idea is that unschooling doesn&#39;t interfere  <br/>
with college. A child who desires to go to college can do just fine.  <br/>
In fact better because they haven&#39;t had 12 previous years of boring  <br/>
textbook work. To them it&#39;s all new and different and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter decided to take the college statistics class her father  <br/>
teaches at 13. She is *not* a math whiz. I don&#39;t mean she&#39;s bad but  <br/>
she&#39;s never done much math other than video games, calculating the  <br/>
tip at a restaurant, figuring out if she can afford something. She  <br/>
never was drawn to math puzzles. But she thought taking the class  <br/>
would be fun. And -- though learning is the point of unschooling, not  <br/>
grades -- her test scores were always among the top 5 out of 60  <br/>
students. She&#39;s taken 3 more class since then (college algebra,  <br/>
precalculus and one other I can&#39;t remember), one not taught by her  <br/>
father, with the same top scoring results. (She&#39;s also gained great  <br/>
insights into the difference between learning for a test and learning  <br/>
from living.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *fun* for her. College statistics at 13 isn&#39;t typical for  <br/>
unschoolers ;-) But taking community college classes for fun is  <br/>
something a lot of unschoolers do. Despite the feeling that kids need  <br/>
trained to do book work, and the feeling that a lifetime of freedom  <br/>
to drop whatever isn&#39;t interesting anymore won&#39;t allow them to sit  <br/>
through a class that isn&#39;t whiz bang like cartoons ;-), it just  <br/>
doesn&#39;t hold true in real life. It&#39;s much better to *not* spend 12  <br/>
years absorbing the idea that learning is hard and boring It&#39;s much  <br/>
better to *not* take 12 years of classes that don&#39;t interest someone  <br/>
&quot;just in case&quot; they might need the information.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much better to acquire the information when people need it. One  <br/>
unschooling girl spent 3 months learning the math she needed for  <br/>
college after having absorbed math from living life. If she can do it  <br/>
in 6 months, what&#39;s the purpose of the other 11.75 years?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what is the socioeconomic something or other LOL?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of those who home/unschool? All across the board. Probably mostly  <br/>
middle class but there was a discussion recently (probably on Sandra  <br/>
Dodd&#39;s list) started by a guy who wanted to provide programs to help  <br/>
disadvantaged people unschool. Several people piped up who said they  <br/>
were below poverty level (basically to say they were a lot more  <br/>
capable than he was giving them credit for.)<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the people on line discussing it will be skewed towards  <br/>
those who have regular access to the internet.<br/>

orderly and logical. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933745912">How long has unschooling been around? Depends on how you mean - Ben<br/>
Franklin was basically unschooled (he learned what interested him when<br/>
it interested him and how it interested him and moved on when he wanted<br/>
to move on). The compulsory education system didn&#39;t exist until<br/>
industrialization - mid 1800s roughly. Prior to that, some folks had the<br/>
one room schoolhouse, others had Mom or Dad teaching them the 3 Rs, and<br/>
others learned as they went. Modern schooling is the newcomer. As a<br/>
&quot;modern movement&quot; I suppose it was around somewhere in the 60s but<br/>
probably not by the name &quot;unschooling&quot; - there were lots of<br/>
&quot;alternative&quot; schooling movements going on then. Somewhere in the 70s<br/>
and 80s is when &quot;homeschooling&quot; in general got going as a modern<br/>
development. People like John Holt (among others) started observing and<br/>
writing about, speaking about, the need for change in the public school<br/>
system. So, it&#39;s been around in the current &quot;form&quot; some 20 or 30 years.<br/>
 <br/>
Demographically, it&#39;s pretty much spread out across the board - single<br/>
parent families, two parent families, grandparents with custody of<br/>
grandkids, adoptive parents, one income, two incomes, food stamps to<br/>
small farms to city dwellers to upper middle class, families with young<br/>
kids, with teens, with one child or a dozen, stay home moms, stay home<br/>
dads, home based business entrepreneurs, physicians, and all sorts of<br/>
other things. Unschooling looks basically like any community of people.<br/>

I&#39;m so glad you brought up this topic because I can really use the <br/>
input myself.  I have been unschooling my daughter since February <br/>
and I am really happy overall with the changes I see in her.  She is <br/>
so much happier, healther and more confident.  We are currently <br/>
exploring her auditing a college class in the fall (she&#39;s 14).   She <br/>
wants to go to college and plans to start taking her core level <br/>
classes for credit when she is 16 and then maybe go away for school <br/>
when she is 18.  My big problem is her dad&#39;s attitude toward her <br/>
education.  He was not a part of her life at all until about a year <br/>
ago.  He has been living 1,200 miles away and knows I took her out <br/>
of school but doesnt understand about unschooling at all.  He is <br/>
moving to be closer to us next Friday.  We do plan on living <br/>
together by the fall and getting married in a year or so.  Exciting <br/>
stuff but big changes.  I have been avioding talking about school <br/>
with him before he gets here but we did end up talking about a few <br/>
days ago and argued.  I know were he is coming from is based on <br/>
concern for her and fear for her future.  He wants her to have an <br/>
education and &quot;not be like him&quot;.  He is so worried about her ability <br/>
to be successful in college, work, and &quot;the real world&quot;.  He just <br/>
can&#39;t see that school is not the real world that she is living in <br/>
the real world now.  I don&#39;t know if I am ever going to be able to <br/>
convince him.  At this point my daughter and I are both willing to <br/>
compromise and do some &quot;school work&quot; to keep him comfortable.  We <br/>
are both sad about it though.  I am not used to having to compromise <br/>
when it comes to parenting stuff.  I&#39;ve always done what I want and <br/>
it&#39;s hard for me to have to take someone else&#39;s comfort level into <br/>
consideration.  To be honest I don&#39;t really like it.  I like him <br/>
though and he is actually her father so I guess I&#39;ll have to figure <br/>
it out.  <br/>
<br/>
I am really appreciating the feedback from everyone.  It is helping <br/>
me a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563528805">I would take this all very seriously. You are so kind to accept his concerns about your ds&#39; future.  But are you and she getting the same consideration?  Is he hearing you and your dd?  Are your thoughts and feelings and experience being trusted and respected? If not at this point I&#39;d wonder if they ever will be.   Sorry, but this is a time to be very careful.  Why be fake with him and do something you do not believe is necessary or right?  Where will that end?  How is this part of the joy?  I would think that he would want to respect what has been working for her and read up on it, and maybe live near you and get to really know her and her strengths.  Will he read books and websites about unschooling that you recommend?  Will he take time to see how your lives work?  If not I would really be careful!  Whew!  Sorry, but I feel concerned for you.

Some of the questions he had were:<br/>
<br/>
how long has unschooling been around?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Since humans have roamed the planet and before. Even Neaderthals <br/>
learned!<br/>
<br/>
Compulsory schooling, on the other hand, has only been around just over <br/>
100 years. Failed, pathetic &quot;experiment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
what is the ratio of unschoolers who attend college and complete it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*RATIO*????<br/>
<br/>
Can he give me the &quot;ratio&quot; of schooled kids who attend college and <br/>
complete it?<br/>
<br/>
No stats. But we personally know of many.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some names *he* could google:<br/>
<br/>
Roya Sorooshian<br/>
Laurie Chauncey<br/>
Aiden Carey<br/>
Cassidy Vare<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
what is the socioeconomic something or other LOL?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Meaning where are we, as a whole, socio-ecomonically? All over the <br/>
board.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in mind that most of us are living on one income by choice.  <br/>
One of us has chosen to stay home and BE with our kids, so our incomes <br/>
are probably lower than the national average. I&#39;d say the intelligence <br/>
level is much higher though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He wants statistics I guess.  He is a very detail oriented person and<br/>
wants more information then what I have been able to provide to him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are no realiable stats on unschoolers or homeschoolers. That&#39;s <br/>
something we all need to get over.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I want him to do the research and find the answers he is searching for<br/>
because I am not 100% sure what he wants to know.<br/>
<br/>
He wants me to do the research so I can make an informed choice and<br/>
explain it to him and be able to answer all his questions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have a GOOD time with *this* one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So---what he wants is for *you* (the teacher) to do all the work, <br/>
devising a curriculum for *him* (the ignorant student who must be <br/>
spoon-fed all his information)?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re trying to *avoid* with our kids!<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schooled kids (and adults!) who want everything handed to them <br/>
on a platter, *our* kids will go *after* what they want to learn. They <br/>
are curious, intelligent, eager learners. They are fascinated by life <br/>
and the world. They&#39;re eager to learn new things. They&#39;re interested <br/>
and interesting. They don&#39;t rely on others to spoon-feed them things <br/>
that they could find out for themselves. They don&#39;t believe everything <br/>
they hear---they question it; they research it; they look inside it and <br/>
tinker with it. THEY do that!<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t make someone *else* do their &quot;homework.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Plus---he&#39;s already told you that you weren&#39;t informed. At what point <br/>
will he consider you informed?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes time to absorb. It takes DOing it and THINKing on it <br/>
and APPLYing it and SEEing it in action---in your own and in others&#39; <br/>
kids. It&#39;s really not an overnight revelation----well, one day it IS, <br/>
but that&#39;s after months and months of working on it internally. One day <br/>
you wake up and go: DAMN! That makes sense! It WORKS! Of COURSE!<br/>
<br/>
Unshcooling is so foreign to how we were raised that it takes deep <br/>
thought and searching to understand and internalize.<br/>
<br/>
Once you *do*....well, there&#39;s no going back.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to do his *own* research OR trust that you&#39;re doing what you <br/>
know is best. He should know that you would do nothing to endanger or <br/>
hinder your own children&#39;s learning. Or does he not trust you either?<br/>
<br/>
We can recommend books and websites (Joyce&#39;s should be just what he&#39;s <br/>
looking for!), magazines, articles, and essays. But he&#39;ll need to do <br/>
the work to convince himself.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s certainly welcome to come on here and debate us---but warn him: <br/>
we&#39;re pretty good at this! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 My big problem is her dad&#39;s attitude toward her<br/>
education.  He was not a part of her life at all until about a year<br/>
ago.  He has been living 1,200 miles away and knows I took her out<br/>
of school but doesnt understand about unschooling at all.  He is<br/>
moving to be closer to us next Friday.  We do plan on living<br/>
together by the fall and getting married in a year or so.  Exciting<br/>
stuff but big changes.  I have been avioding talking about school<br/>
with him before he gets here but we did end up talking about a few<br/>
days ago and argued.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So hes&#39; trusted you up to this point, but is now (when she&#39;s happy and <br/>
doing well) arguing with you?<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I know were he is coming from is based on<br/>
concern for her and fear for her future.  He wants her to have an<br/>
education and &quot;not be like him&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not---she&#39;s learning and making an effort to learn more. Is he?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He is so worried about her ability<br/>
to be successful in college, work, and &quot;the real world&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s IN the real world NOW.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He just can&#39;t see that school is not the real world that she is living <br/>
in<br/>
the real world now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would HE like to come here and debate with us too? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SCHOOL is the real world? Since when? Can he give us an example???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I am ever going to be able to<br/>
convince him.  At this point my daughter and I are both willing to<br/>
compromise and do some &quot;school work&quot; to keep him comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice that you&#39;re willing to go outsid eyour comfort zone for him. <br/>
Is he not willing to do that for you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We are both sad about it though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the clincher. Does he not care?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am not used to having to compromise<br/>
when it comes to parenting stuff.  I&#39;ve always done what I want and<br/>
it&#39;s hard for me to have to take someone else&#39;s comfort level into<br/>
consideration.  To be honest I don&#39;t really like it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
An absent father shouldn&#39;t have much say. I realize he&#39;s about to be <br/>
&quot;present&quot;---but he needs to trust you as he has her whole life up to <br/>
this point. I&#39;m not sure how much he can complain---seriously! Is he <br/>
unhappy how she&#39;s turned out? Have you done  a bad job? He can&#39;t trust <br/>
you to make wise decisions concerning your daughter???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I like him though and he is actually her father so I guess I&#39;ll have to <br/>
figure<br/>
it out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is he willing to learn more? Or has he shut down to learning new <br/>
things? If he *has* shut down, maybe that&#39;s something to point out to <br/>
him. *I* wouldn&#39;t want my children refusing to learn something that was <br/>
so important to *their* children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
When people refuse to do the research on unschooling, it simply proves <br/>
my point: they&#39;ve quit learning---and that is one of the HUGE things <br/>
I&#39;m trying to avoid through unschooling! I want my kids to always love <br/>
to learn!<br/>

<br/>
This is a very important point that Kelly made.  We have been unschooling<br/>
for only a couple months.  I honestly just started reading websites and<br/>
reading books on unschooling.  Dh saw me reading them and never said<br/>
anything.  He just observed (he&#39;s also an engineer so he is also the<br/>
detailed analytical kind of guy).  I never said &quot;hey, we&#39;re unschooling<br/>
now&quot;.  He just saw me reading (LOTS) and absorbing all I could about it.<br/>
He asked me one day a couple weeks ago.. &quot;so, are you unschooling the boys<br/>
now?&quot; to which I replied &quot;ummm, yeah&quot; and he tells me that he has been<br/>
reading about it and that &quot;it seems like a pretty good thing as long as you<br/>
stay on top of it&quot; (meaning strewing and leading a rich life.. not benign<br/>
neglect that I have read about where people don&#39;t interact with their kids<br/>
at all and call it unschooling).  All he asked was that I just tell him what<br/>
we do during the day so that he can see and hear about the connections too.<br/>
I started a blog that he can look at and I update it just about daily for<br/>
him to see.  He sees lots of pictures on it of our day and he sees the kids<br/>
SHINE in the pics and the words that I write.  He sees connections being<br/>
made everyday and when he comes home at night he hears about all the fun and<br/>
cool things we did that day when the boys tell him about their day.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t come home to kids who have been sitting at a table doing math and<br/>
phonics during the day and have lost their love of learning already at this<br/>
young age.  He comes home to children who are excited about learning and<br/>
life and that ask lots of questions.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that he saw that I was passionate about it and he took<br/>
it upon himself to learn more about it and to want to learn about what I was<br/>
so interested in and to CONNECT with me in that way.  He knows how much I<br/>
love the boys and that I want the best for them and that if I believe SO<br/>
MUCH that this is best for them, then there must be something to it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sort of connection can be soooo important to a partner who <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the chance to be home during the day. George is not <br/>
a &quot;reader&quot;, never really researched unschooling, so seeing <br/>
unschooling happening has been really important for him in terms of <br/>
understanding how it &quot;works&quot;. He&#39;s often home for lunch, though and <br/>
even other times of the day if work is slow (he&#39;s self employed), so <br/>
he has an advantage a lot of partners don&#39;t in that regard. He <br/>
doens&#39;t need to go look at the blog to find out what the kids are up <br/>
to ;) Its still a great tool for communicating with the <br/>
grandparents, though. They can talk to the kids w&#39;o falling back <br/>
on &quot;what are you learning about in homeschool?&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
This is so important.<br/>
For anyone with a reluctant spouse, the above should be your assignment!<br/>
<br/>
I found that all the debating, discussing and pontificating did very<br/>
little to convince my spouse of anything unschooling related years<br/>
ago. What worked best? LIVING it.<br/>
<br/>
As we joyfully lived our lives and gushed to him about our wonderful<br/>
days, he slowly GOT IT. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a reluctant spouse, try not to gripe about the kids or<br/>
your day. The more you focus on the happy parts, the better off you&#39;ll<br/>
all be anyway. It doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t get tired, or frustrated or<br/>
whatever...but avoid telling about those feelings as though anyone<br/>
else is to blame. Talk about how beautiful, how smart, how interesting<br/>
your kids are...because they ARE. As YOU see the good stuff, as YOU<br/>
joyfully learn with your children, the reluctant spouse will begin to<br/>
warm up.<br/>
<br/>
It works! Really.<br/>

***Since humans have roamed the planet and before. Even Neaderthals<br/>

<br/>
Yes, learning is so easy, even cave men did it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Shell beads found in Algeria and Israel have been dated to 100,000 years <br/>
ago, well before there were jewelry makings schools. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The stunning Chauvet drawings were created  between 29,700 and  32,400 years <br/>
ago long before there were art schools. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Signs carved in tortoise shell, found in China were written down in the <br/>
Stone age or Neolithic age, predating the previous earliest writings by two <br/>
thousand years, well before there were writing schools.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HEY!  This is fun!<br/>
<br/>
Archeologists have found pottery dating back 13,000 years, many, many years <br/>
before there were pottery schools.<br/>
The first known sewing needle, found in France, is about 25,000 years old, <br/>
some considerable time before there were sewing schools.<br/>
There is some evidence that people had discovered a way to weave cloth and <br/>
baskets as early as 27,000 years ago, before there were weaving studios or, <br/>
well, looms. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be no shortage of evidence that humans learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116095068">He wants the good, the bad and the ugly of unschooling. He also wants<br/>
the information to be unbiased. So he doesnt want information from<br/>
unschooling advocates nor does he want information from those who are<br/>
totally opposed to it. He wants information from a neutral party.<br/>
<br/>
     OK, being new to unschooling, I could share my decision-making process.  There aren&#39;t many neutral parties because those who have any interest in the topic of education of any sort have strong opinions on how best to do it.  Neutral parties aren&#39;t interested enough to have opinions about it.  Still, a balanced assessment of any important life decision is a worthy goal.  So how to go about it?  When I was comparing  schooling at home with schooling at school, I discovered that I could only find people who felt that I was terrible to homeschool and people who thought I was terrible not to homeschool!<br/>
  First I think we must look at our own family, and what we want for our family.  Is what we are doing now working?  If not what would we like to see change?  What societal trends feel right or wrong to us?   If there is a spouse, what is important to them?  Are our children happy, secure, and is there a sense of harmony in our lives and our home?<br/>
   Well, those are only some of the questions I faced.  Since most material written about this is biased, get a cross-section of material.  Explore the early foundations of how children (really all people) learn.  Read the writings of reaserchers; to that end get names of authors.  Read internet web sites. Read books.  Talk to your kids.  Watch them.  <br/>
    While carrying out this process, think, meditate, pray.  Explore your deep-seated biases, and very importantly, your fears.  Only thus can you prevent these issues from controlling your decision in ways you don&#39;t realize.  And very importantly, remeber that if you are exploring alternatives,you must see a reason for change.   Don&#39;t expect alternatives to be held up against a standard of perfection. The alternative should be better than what you are doing now, but probably cannot be perfect.  No parental choice can spare most of us from late-night soul searching, regrets, etc.<br/>
     I could suggest readings that helped me decide homeschooling was for us, and later that unschooling was for us. Email me offlist if you want some of this info.  I do actually know of some stats about research on homeschooled kids in general, regardless of the type of homeschooling followed.  But remember that public and private schools are well known to have failed our society and our kids in many ways, and as one reply  said, be aware of those &#39;stats&#39; too!        <br/>
    As another reply said, the person with concerns has got to be willing to read this stuff for it to have any value.  There is plenty of evidence that unschooling is consistent with reaserch-confirmed patterns of effective human learning. <br/>
   I hope this makes sense. I know it&#39;s just my journey (and only a tiny part of it).  Maybe it doesn&#39;t fit for anyone else.  Hope it&#39;s not too long or rambling!  Cameron, a newbie still...for sure!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892026140">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Long-time lurker, don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here before.  I have two<br/>
daughters, ages 5 and 4, and my SAHM wife unschools them.  And we&#39;re both<br/>
quite happy so far.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to come in so late on this, but I have a bit to throw in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So he doesnt want information from<br/>
&gt; unschooling advocates nor does he want information from those who are<br/>
&gt; totally opposed to it. He wants information from a neutral party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there such a thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Short answer #1:  Finding out that kind of info is a huge undertaking.  By<br/>
trying to delegate such a huge task onto you, he may be hoping that you&#39;ll<br/>
just drop it.  And unschooling altogether.  If he was like me, then he may<br/>
be scared of it, and is reacting out of his own fear rather than as a<br/>
deliberate plot to sabotage you.  Instead of a true debate tactic, it<br/>
becomes a defense mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
Short answer #2:  No, not in the way he wants.  Logistical nightmare.  What<br/>
he&#39;s asking for is a research study.  For details, see below.  (There might<br/>
be an acceptable alternative, which I&#39;ll mention at the end.)<br/>
<br/>
Long answer: What he wants he can&#39;t have, and it&#39;s unfair of him to demand<br/>
this of you.  The only way he&#39;s going to get that information is for someone<br/>
to have done a long-term research study.  This study would have to identify<br/>
a large enough sampling of adults who were &quot;unschooled,&quot; and/or to identify<br/>
children of various ages who are currently being unschooled (or some subset<br/>
thereof) and follow them through to adulthood, whether or not they choose to<br/>
go through college.  This study must also be able to identify all the ratios<br/>
and demographics he&#39;s wanting to know from the above population samples, a<br/>
task that is difficult by itself.  And there are myriad other<br/>
considerations.<br/>
<br/>
IF you can find someone who has done this research, THEN you must find out<br/>
WHO FINANCED the study.  As unschooling is gaining steam, there are many who<br/>
react violently against it.  The NEA, your local public school who (at least<br/>
here in Texas) gets money for each kid in a seat at the school, and many<br/>
homeschoolers who practice full-fledged school at home.  When someone has<br/>
performed a &quot;study,&quot; it does not mean that it is unbiased.  Research takes<br/>
money.  Follow the money.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Research&quot; merely means that (a) information was gathered according to an<br/>
agreed-upon set of rules, and (b) the biases are more subtle and in a<br/>
particular form that may be difficult to identify.  Studies can be flawed.<br/>
Perhaps the study&#39;s questions may be biased, or the population sample wasn&#39;t<br/>
random enough, and many other things.  Unfortunately, when the word &quot;study&quot;<br/>
pops up next to an opinion, then that&#39;s good enough for many.  They feel<br/>
they can stop thinking and let it go, since someone else has done more<br/>
thinking on it than they themselves were willing to put into it, AND it puts<br/>
the onerous on me to challenge the study (&quot;Well, back in &#39;04, this group did<br/>
this study where they found that blahblah-counter to your opinion and<br/>
they&#39;re smarter than you blahblahblah,...&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE:<br/>
Blogs.  There is one father I met at an unschooling conference who has his<br/>
own blog.  His blog is about lots of stuff, but unschooling his kids is one<br/>
of them.  He was initially skeptical, until he LIVED it, and his kids LIVED<br/>
it.  Since Dads like to pretend to be the analytical ones (I know, I are one<br/>
-- :-) ), he might be softened a bit if he reads another dad&#39;s account of<br/>
being skeptical, his analyses, and finally becoming OK.  (If it&#39;s OK to post<br/>
the blog link here, I&#39;ll see if I can find it.)<br/>
<br/>
POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE #2 (not as good, IMHO):<br/>
AND, if you&#39;re feeling ESPECIALLY generous with him, and IF you feel like<br/>
doing research, then do this (and I won&#39;t blame you if you say, &quot;Heck-fire,<br/>
Uncle Jed, YOU&#39;RE NUTS!&quot;): Find all the anti-unschooling information you can<br/>
find, and all the pro-unschooling info you can find.  Line them up in dialog<br/>
form.  Maybe even do it up like Galileo&#39;s *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief<br/>
World Systems.  *Back and forth so he can see all the arguments, pro and<br/>
con.  BETTER YET, MAKE HIM GO AND FIND THIS OUT.  I&#39;m all for the &quot;Why<br/>
should I spoon feed you?&quot; attitude.*<br/>
*<br/>
Bottom Line:  I believe no impartiality is to be found.  If he&#39;ll come off<br/>
of that point, then you can assist HIM with HIS research.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where can I hear about the good, the bad and the ugly sides of<br/>
&gt; unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to your local public school and just ask about HOMEschooling.  You&#39;ll get<br/>
an earful there, whether or not it&#39;s based in reality.  Just remember that<br/>
they have monetary reasons to dislike ANY form of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone I&#39;ve spoken with about unschooling who was not familiar with it<br/>
already labels it as irresponsible, at best.  I&#39;m betting that you&#39;re going<br/>
to have a difficult time finding someone who is well-informed about<br/>
unschooling and is also against it.  Most pro-schoolers I know simply lump<br/>
in &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; with all the other criticisms against<br/>
homeschooling (lack of social skills, e.g.) when they hear about<br/>
unschooling.  Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335368252">Hope you don&#39;t mind me posting this article. It was posted on one of<br/>
my other boards. Although it is not promoting unschooling or even<br/>
homeschooling, I think it totally promotes unschooling unconsciously.<br/>
  I thought it had some nice points that may help some of the people<br/>
on fact finding missions (such as myself)  that are trying to convince<br/>
a partner that school is not the best place for their children. I<br/>
think curriculum based homeschoolers face these same issues this<br/>
teacher is talking about by putting undue pressure to perform at some<br/>
predetermined expectation of age and development.<br/>

Let children be children<br/>
Is your 5-year-old stressed out because so much is expected?<br/>

<br/>
I was watching one of my second-grade girls try unsuccessfully to tie<br/>
her shoes the other day, and I thought, &quot;This is a person who is<br/>
supposed to be learning plural possessives?&quot; I think not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve just finished test time again in the schools of California. The<br/>
mad frenzy of testing infects everyone from second grade through high<br/>
school. Because of the rigors and threats of No Child Left Behind,<br/>
schools are desperate to increase their scores. As the requirements<br/>
become more stringent, we have completely lost sight of the children<br/>
taking these tests.<br/>
<br/>
For 30 years as a teacher of primary kids, I have operated on the Any<br/>
Fool Can See principle. And any fool can see that the spread between<br/>
what is developmentally appropriate for 7- and 8-year-old children and<br/>
what is demanded of them on these tests is widening. A lot of what<br/>
used to be in the first-grade curriculum is now taught in<br/>
kindergarten. Is your 5-year-old stressed out? Perhaps this is why.<br/>
<br/>
Primary-grade children have only the most tenuous grasp on how the<br/>
world works. Having been alive only seven or eight years, they have<br/>
not figured out that in California there is a definite wet and dry<br/>
season. They live in high expectation that it will snow in the Bay<br/>
Area in the winter. They reasonably conclude, based on their limited<br/>
experience with words, that a thesaurus must be a dinosaur. When asked<br/>
to name some of the planets after he heard the word Earth, one of my<br/>
boys confidently replied, &quot;Mars, Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter and Canada!&quot;<br/>
to which a girl replied, &quot;No, no, no, you gotta go way far outer than<br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Research has shown that it takes approximately 24 repetitions of a new<br/>
concept to imprint on a young brain. The aforementioned plural<br/>
possessives come up twice in the curriculum, yet they are supposed to<br/>
know it when they see it. This is folly.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, 2 1/2 uninterrupted hours are supposed to be devoted to<br/>
language arts and reading every morning. I ask you, what adult could<br/>
sustain an interest in one subject for that long? Yet the two reading<br/>
series adopted by the state for elementary education require that much<br/>
time be devoted to reading in the expectation that the scores will<br/>
shoot up eventually. Show me a 7-year-old who has that kind of<br/>
concentration. Show me a 64-year-old teacher who has it. Not I.<br/>
<br/>
The result of this has been a decline in math scores at our school,<br/>
because the emphasis is on getting them to read and there isn&#39;t enough<br/>
time to fit in a proper curriculum. Early math education should rely<br/>
heavily on messing about with concrete materials of measurements,<br/>
mass, volume and length, and discovering basic principles through play.<br/>
<br/>
There is no time for this. The teaching of art is all but a subversive<br/>
activity. Teachers whisper, &quot;I taught art today!&quot; as if they would be<br/>
reported to the Reading Police for stealing time from the reading<br/>
curriculum, which is what they did.<br/>
<br/>
It is also First Communion time in second grade. Yes, I teach in a<br/>
public school, but First Communion happens in second grade, and it is<br/>
a big deal, the subject of much discussion in the classroom. The<br/>
children are excited.<br/>
<br/>
A few months back one of my girls exclaimed, &quot;Jeez, I have a lot to do<br/>
after school today, Teacher. I gotta do my homework, go to baseball<br/>
practice and get baptized.&quot; I laughed to myself at the priorities of<br/>
this little to-do list, so symbolic of the life of one second-grader.<br/>
But there was a much larger issue here. What is happening to their<br/>
souls? You may ask, what business it is of the schools what is<br/>
happening to the souls of these little children?<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you. Any fool can see that those setting the standards for<br/>
testing of primary-grade children haven&#39;t been around any actual<br/>
children in a long time. The difference between what one can<br/>
reasonably expect an 8-year-old to know and what is merely a party<br/>
trick grows exponentially on these state tests.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, children who know they are bright and can read well are<br/>
proved wrong time and again because of the structure of these tests.<br/>
Teachers spend inordinate amounts of time trying to teach the children<br/>
to be careful of the quirky tricks of the tests when they should be<br/>
simply teaching how to get on in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty years ago, I had a conference with a parent, a Sikh, whose<br/>
child was brilliant. I was prepared to show him all her academic work,<br/>
but he brushed it aside and said, &quot;Yes, yes, I know she is quite<br/>
smart, but I want to know how her soul is developing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The present emphasis on testing and test scores is sucking the soul<br/>
out of the primary school experience for both teachers and children.<br/>
So much time is spent on testing and measuring reading speed that the<br/>
children are losing the joy that comes but once in their lifetime, the<br/>
happy messiness of paint, clay, Tinkertoys and jumping rope, the quiet<br/>
discovery of a shiny new book of interest to them, the wonders of a<br/>
magnifying glass. The teachers around them, under constant pressure to<br/>
raise those test scores, radiate urgency and pressure. Their smiles<br/>
are grim. They are not enjoying their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Our children need parents and teachers who, like Hamlet, know a hawk<br/>
from a hand saw, who know foolishness when they see it and are strong<br/>
enough to defend these small souls from the onslaught of escalating<br/>
developmentally inappropriate claptrap. The great unspoken secret of<br/>
primary school is that a lot of what is going on is arrant nonsense,<br/>
and it&#39;s getting worse. Any fool can see.</div>
