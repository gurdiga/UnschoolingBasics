<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135068670">Hello everyone! I am very excited to announce several new things. <br/>
NETSHU, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/</a> , is now open to <br/>
children of all ages. It started out mainly for children 10-16 but we <br/>
have various ages now due to younger siblings and some families with <br/>
young children only. We still hope to continue getting some older <br/>
children (above 10) in the group as they seem to be the minority now <br/>
a days. But as I said we are now welcoming all ages!<br/>
<br/>
Now for the exciting part! We now have a facility for all of our <br/>
activities and such. We also have a Gym class lined <br/>
up......Yayyyyyyy! I know a lot of you have been hoping for such a <br/>
class to help the children get the exercise they need. I will be <br/>
going Saturday morning to finalize everything on use of the building. <br/>
Starting in April we will be having some sort of activity going on <br/>
every Friday from 12:00 - 2:00. I am open to ideas and volunteers of <br/>
all kind. I hope to do a cooking class around once a month, some type <br/>
of arts & craft class once a month, Gym class once a month maybe <br/>
twice depending on what everyone else would like to do. <br/>
<br/>
I have a million ideas running through my head and would love to hear <br/>
from those of you interested in joining our Fun Fridays! We welcome <br/>
those from any group, you do not have to belong to NETSHU, but it <br/>
would be nice :) Just keep in mind we are a secular group.<br/>
<br/>
Please start either posting, emailing or calling me with what you <br/>
think. Wether you want to join in the fun, have ideas, want to <br/>
volunteer or anything. We are excited to finally have more activities <br/>
for our children to join in on!<br/>
