 Amy and I were wondering if there was any way we could participate in any<br/>
of the events. We were unable to get the money together for the conference,<br/>
our kids are fairly young and we would probably not have been able to<br/>
participate in very much of the conference itself, but we do live about five<br/>
minutes away and would like to contribute in some way. If there is anything<br/>
we can do, could you please let us know? Thanks!<br/>

I know that Kelly &quot;signed off&quot; the list a couple of days ago when she <br/>
left for the conference, and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll have access to <br/>
email etc (or the time!) while there.  You might want to contact her at <br/>
the conference, maybe swing by or leave a message at the hotel where <br/>
the main events are being held.   (You&#39;re so lucky in a way to live <br/>
nearby!)<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to go to, but had already planned and paid for (with no <br/>
refund) our final camping trip of the season.   NEXT year for sure!<br/>

That&#39;s what the scholarship fund is for!!! You should have written<br/>
Kelly a long time ago and let her know the finances were tight. Also,<br/>
a LOT of attendees have young children, it&#39;s still worth it, truly!<br/>
I&#39;ll let Kelly know you emailed....we all sat in the lobby and talked<br/>
until late. Her van broke down tonight, but she was in good spirits,<br/>
other than looking a bit tired.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will second this!  My two young children (6 and 4) were with me--and <br/>
while I didn&#39;t get to go to every session I wanted, I still went to <br/>
many I enjoyed and also the FANTASTIC evening at the City Museum.  <br/>
<br/>
My 6 year-old really dislikes group activities and my DH ended up <br/>
missing a lot while keeping her busy but he truly enjoyed just being <br/>
at the conference.  It was great and we hope to go again next year!  <br/>
Thank you Kelly and everyone who worked to put it together.<br/>
