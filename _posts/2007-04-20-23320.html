<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023550542">***i&#39;m also wanting to find a somewhat age-appropriate magazine for my son<br/>
(2). he loves my magazines and that&#39;s cool, but i&#39;d like to get something<br/>
just for him that he can tear up all he likes. i&#39;d like to get him<br/>
something pretty cool, maybe a little alternative, NOT like highlights (my<br/>
parents&#39; suggestion). any suggestions?***<br/>
<br/>
There was a sweet little magazine called All Round, but it&#39;s not being <br/>
published anymore.  You can still get back issues here: <br/>

<br/>
Dylan was older when we found this magazine but he really enjoyed it and <br/>
still feels strongly sentimental about it now.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little I would let him pick what he wanted off the magazine <br/>
stand.  He&#39;d pick all kinds of things, based on the picture on the cover, <br/>
mostly,  and then he&#39;d color or paint on the pages or paste stuff on them or <br/>
ignore it after a brief look. &lt;g&gt;   We had a pretty weird collection of <br/>
stuff in those days. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And he liked Zoobooks, but he&#39;s always loved and been interested in animals. <br/>
As he got older he drew a lot of pictures of animals and he referred to that <br/>
magazine a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe at two your little guy would like catalogs just as much.  You could <br/>
get on the mailing list for a toy catalog (or twenty) for free! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
