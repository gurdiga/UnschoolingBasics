<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349112992">My (youngest) son turned 14 in February and is in grade 8 in a <br/>
Christian school.  Although he&#39;s getting a decent enough education, he <br/>
seems to be very bored with school.  <br/>
Recently, I&#39;ve been introducing the thought of home schooling. (he has <br/>
no clue about unschooling yet, although, that&#39;s where this is leading) <br/>
He&#39;s showing an interest for grade nine and says he might try it for <br/>
one semester. I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll like it so much, he&#39;ll keep going. <br/>
Is 14 too late of an age to start homeschooling or unschooling?  <br/>
Will I be able to keep him occupied enough at home so he&#39;s not bored <br/>
here too?  <br/>
Has anyone else here started a child this old?<br/>
Any advice or suggestions would be very much appreciated. <br/>
PS - I home schooled my oldest daughter and second son years ago but <br/>
really didn&#39;t know what I was doing.  They went back to public school, <br/>
something I&#39;ll always regret but can&#39;t change now. So, having LUke at <br/>
home will be a dream come true for me.  I just don&#39;t know where to <br/>
begin.</div>

school was doing him no good.  He was bored and hated going.  He quit and<br/>
worked his way through educating himself.  A few years the next child down<br/>
did the same thing.  And then the next year the next child.  Now all the<br/>
kids are homeschooled and as they become older they are more unschooled than<br/>
homeschooled.  The second child (the 2nd and 3rd are also gymnastics coaches<br/>
for my daughter) is really into art.  She is a beautiful artist.  She loves<br/>
the freedom of being able to create whenever she wants without someone<br/>
telling her to pay attention when she doodles on her schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late to start unschooling!  I&#39;m doing it now for myself and<br/>
I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s!<br/>

My dd is 13 (finished 6th grade last June), this is our first year at <br/>
home, we&#39;re still deschooling and still getting the hang of <br/>
unschooling.  We&#39;re in MA, a state that requires reporting, so I have <br/>
to turn things she does into &quot;educationese&quot; (which is tough this first <br/>
year!, but I&#39;ll work it out somehow!).   Unschooling is child-led <br/>
learning, let him choose the things he&#39;s interested in, I bet he won&#39;t <br/>
be bored at all!  It&#39;s never too late!<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756105941">I didn&#39;t start that old, but my son is 14, too, and I wish, wish, <br/>
WISH I had started homeschooling sooner.  (We started after 5th <br/>
grade.)  It is never too late -- I know someone locally who started <br/>
hsing this year, and her son is 14, also.  <br/>
<br/>
Bored kids especially can benefit.  I know all those years in brick <br/>
and mortar school (most of it was in private, half a year was <br/>
public) taught my son some bad habits, how not to concentrate on the <br/>
task at hand (if he did, he would be done too soon, then have to be <br/>
bored, or &quot;rewarded&quot; with more work of their choosing....)  There is <br/>
nothing that says, if you want, that you even have to wait until the <br/>
end of the year.  (Nothing says you can&#39;t, either.)<br/>
<br/>
My biggest suggestion is to try to get connected with other <br/>
homeschooling teens and tweens in your area.  I think one of the <br/>
biggest draws can be friends.  If there is a social structure out of <br/>
school, he may be more inclined to continue homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is a ready-made teen homeschool group, great, join it!  <br/>
(And you can generally join these before you start hsing -- a great <br/>
way to get support from people in the same stage of child-rearing.  <br/>
Those with 10 yr olds don&#39;t really understand the issues of a 14 yr <br/>
old as well as those with teens!)  If there isn&#39;t -- join whatever <br/>
groups there are in the area (not a bad idea, anyway), and start a <br/>
group of your own.  When we moved to our current location, there was <br/>
none, so I started one.  A lot of people have made connections that <br/>
hadn&#39;t previously.  I think part of why there are as few older <br/>
homeschoolers in this area is due to the lack of activities geared <br/>
for older kids.  (A field trip geared to elementary kids tends to be <br/>
ho-hum to teens!)  The activities can run the gamut from a park day <br/>
(yes, older kids do actually enjoy running around a playground on <br/>
occasion!) to game days, to discussion groups, whatever they want.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, the &quot;schooly&quot; part of our day is the least of it -- my <br/>
son has FINALLY (after nearly 4 yrs) rediscovered his focus, as well <br/>
as discovering (and acknowledging -- I knew for years he is a <br/>
morning person, but he only acknowledged it about 3-4 weeks ago) his <br/>
best time of day, the time he thinks best, etc.  Self-discovery is <br/>
important, and takes time.  But now we have the freedom to do what <br/>
we are interested in doing!  Make sure your son has plenty of time <br/>
for HIS interests!  <br/>
<br/>
You may be surprised at how your relationship with him changes.  You <br/>
will find yourself having conversations with him that you never <br/>
thought you would, about any variety of topics, and you may discover <br/>
he can come up with solutions to some of your own problems that you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have come up with.  It is really neat to see how your child <br/>
is developing and growing!<br/>
<br/>
All the best, Linda<br/>
