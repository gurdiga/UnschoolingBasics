Jennifer:<br/>

You asked a question I can answer from my experience from the child&#39;s<br/>
standpoint.  You asked if parents are dishonoring their whole child if <br/>
they<br/>
have the child get glasses because of so-called vision loss.  They are. <br/>
  If<br/>
the child doesn&#39;t want glasses, doesn&#39;t regard himself or herself as <br/>
having<br/>
a need for glasses or whatever, and if the child is, as far as she or <br/>
he is<br/>
concerned before being taught otherwise, happy with the body she or he <br/>
was<br/>
born with, the parents are not honoring the whole child.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if you didn&#39;t ask for help, and all of this discussion is <br/>
very<br/>
much unwanted help.  I haven&#39;t read your first message on this, and I am<br/>
still working my way toward that in my inbox after returning from a <br/>
business<br/>
trip to find over a thousand messages.  But this discusson did happen, <br/>
and I<br/>
felt I needed to share some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s REALLY important for Jennifer and others to understand a <br/>
HUGE point of the list and how it works.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT about Jennifer. It&#39;s not about Jennifer&#39;s kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the idea that we think we, as parents, know better.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer---and Jennifer&#39;s children---may be perfectly happy with the <br/>
decisions that have been made. No one&#39;s trying to get her to change. <br/>
She may. She may not. That&#39;s not the point.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...there may be seven---or 70 or 700!---other people on this list <br/>
who have benefitted from the discussion. It may make a difference to <br/>
another family who is struggling with a similar issue...now or in the <br/>
future. The goal is to throw an idea or problem out there, toss it <br/>
around a bit, and come up with different strategies--especially ones <br/>
that honor the children&#39;s wishes. No one here can *make* another do <br/>
something or choose something. But sometimes we get a different <br/>
perspective from all the discussion.<br/>
