First of all, this list exists to discuss the philosophy of<br/>
unschooling not tell you how to deal with legalities. Also, this list<br/>
has members from all over the U.S. and other countries so we couldn&#39;t<br/>
possibly answer any of the above questions without knowing more.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, unschooling is a form of homeschooling so you need to know<br/>
the homeschool law of your region or state. Unschooling costs whatever<br/>
you want to spend in order to entertain you and your children&#39;s<br/>
interests and passions. <br/>
<br/>
Please read more about unschooling and find out your state laws. If<br/>
you give us more information about where you are, people here could<br/>
direct you to other websites or legal information so you can educate<br/>
yourself.  We are not here to discuss legalities or state specific<br/>
information though, so conversation about that will need to happen<br/>
offlist. Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728357267">Katie, why are you in a desperate situation?  Even most school-at-<br/>
homers take the summer off.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, what state are you in?  You should definitely look at <br/>
the law in your particular state, since all states differ.  And there <br/>
may be someone here from your state who could recommend a more local <br/>
list for that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the left side of the page here at unschoolingbasics, <br/>
you can click on the Links and there you&#39;ll find lots of places to <br/>
read more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as cost and how to start, that is up to you.  Unschooling is <br/>
basically living life doing what you and your kid/s enjoy.  Maybe if <br/>
you can give some more detail, we can help with more specific answers.<br/>

Use whatever $$$ you have left to go on vacation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, find the homeschool laws in your state.<br/>
<br/>
Then just do &quot;Step 3&quot; &lt;g&gt; Go on vacation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Katie, are you already homeschooling? If so, you don&#39;t<br/>
need to contact anyone. As far as the state is<br/>
concerned unschooling is a form of homeschooling. It&#39;s<br/>
a form that officials don&#39;t like. So most of us in<br/>
states that have strict reporting guidelines don&#39;t say<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; anywhere in our reporting. You should<br/>
find a local group to get details on reporting etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These questions make me think that you know absolutely<br/>
nothing about unschooling. Start by reading some<br/>
articles at these sites:<br/>

There are also books on the subject:<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith is a book<br/>
that covers all the basics.<br/>
