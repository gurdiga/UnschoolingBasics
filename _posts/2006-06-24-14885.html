 </span></blockquote>If he really WANTED to learn to ride a bike but hadn&#39;t been able to,  <br/>
how would you teach him? You could run alongside him all summer and  <br/>
if he&#39;s not developmentally ready to do some of the skills needed to  <br/>
ride a bike, he just can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If there were *a* method to teach nonreading kids to read, schools  <br/>
would be using it.<br/>
<br/>
There are many brain areas involved in reading. If one isn&#39;t ready,  <br/>
he&#39;s just not going to be able to read.<br/>
<br/>
Time will take care of it. In the mean time, read to him, turn on the  <br/>
subtitles on the TV, label things around the house (and then switch  <br/>
the labels.) There&#39;s also Peggy Kaye&#39;s Games for Reading book that  <br/>
has some fun games. Find things that he enjoys. None of those will  <br/>
make him read, but it will be information available for when he&#39;s  <br/>
ready to put it together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982823910">If your son is actually asking for help in learning to read, there are lots<br/>
of things you can do together to help the process along.  Both my boys<br/>
learned to read at around 5, and they both really wanted to learn, so it&#39;s<br/>
possible he is ready.<br/>
Read with him a lot, pointing to the words as you read them, play games with<br/>
letter sounds, label things around the house, write him lots of notes (be<br/>
careful with the handwriting ;), get your letter magnets out (or buy some,<br/>
several sets so there are plenty of each letter) and make words on the<br/>
fridge together, point out signs or labels that you come across together.<br/>
<br/>
Some people love it and some people hate it, but it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>
mom&#39;s opinion is I suppose; both my younger boys liked &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>
Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot;.  After introducing it to them when they were 4 or<br/>
5, they would periodically come up and ask for &quot;lessons&quot;.  By the time we<br/>
were halfway through the book they could read well beyond it.  My 7 y.o.<br/>
still goes back to it and reads the book from time to time just to reminisce<br/>
I guess, because the stories aren&#39;t all that interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My library has tons of picture books on tape.  Listening to the tapes and<br/>
reading the books is a great way to connect also.<br/>
<br/>
Of course your son will &quot;figure it out&quot;.  That&#39;s what all kids do, whether<br/>
someone is trying to &quot;teach&quot; them or not.  There are things that will help<br/>
and things that will hinder that process.  If you listen to the latest<br/>
edition of Unbridled Learning, there&#39;s a great post from a mom about how<br/>
each of her kids learned to read.  It includes a daughter who *really*<br/>
wanted to learn and wasn&#39;t ready.  It&#39;s important to help them not frustrate<br/>
themselves too!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749184410">&quot;In a way, it does take years to learn to read and write - it starts<br/>
when a child is born and takes however many years until the pieces<br/>
click into place. Not years of phonics practice (bleh) but years of<br/>
being exposed to language. On the one hand, it can seem to<br/>
happen &#39;overnight&#39;. On the other, it can percolate internally for<br/>
years before it becomes visible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought this was a good thing to post again!! If you&#39;re having<br/>
doubts, just keep reading Joyces words, daily if necessary.:)<br/>
<br/>
I use Jared as my &quot;late reading&quot; example a lot, but each of my<br/>
children had their own way of deciphering script and their journey<br/>
into reading looked very different from child to child. <br/>
<br/>
Jared started reading fluently this year (at age 12) but I could write<br/>
an entire article about his process and all the cool stuff he was<br/>
doing along the way. He didn&#39;t SEEM to be reading or writing before<br/>
this year, but he WAS deciphering script and making connections in his<br/>
own way.<br/>
<br/>
His journey looked more like that whole &quot;lightswitch&quot; flipping on<br/>
overnight.  Suddenly he writes online, writes character descriptions<br/>
for his D&D character (very neatly I might add) spells beautifully and<br/>
reads just about anything he comes across with complete proficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra&#39;s journey was a slower struggle. It was completely on her own<br/>
terms also. No lessons, no phonics, no pushing on my part whatsoever.<br/>
But she pushed herself to decipher it from a very young age. She<br/>
WANTED to figure out this whole reading thing and plugged away at it<br/>
in her own way. She asked what letter sounds were (Jared never asked<br/>
that kind of thing, he didn&#39;t want to know individual sounds he just<br/>
started recognizing entire words over time). Sierra was a fairly<br/>
proficient around 7 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (now almost 17) didn&#39;t have any interest in writing until he<br/>
had a purpose for it (duh....real life works best:) around 12-13 years<br/>
of age. He read to himself by age 9 but now mostly reads gaming or<br/>
computer mags and never reads novels for pleasure anymore.<br/>
<br/>
The only non-reader is Jalen at 5.5 (he&#39;ll be 6 in Feb.) Do I worry<br/>
because he can&#39;t write his name? NOPE.<br/>
Do I worry because he doesn&#39;t know his A,B,C&#39;s or any words at all? NOPE.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that if three of my children can now read well, he<br/>
will too....eventually.  There isn&#39;t much need for it in his world<br/>
right now. He can play the video games he loves without reading. I<br/>
have no doubt they will help him decipher script though! Video games<br/>
are fabulous for that.:)<br/>
<br/>
It all happens. And when they&#39;re 20 and 25 years old will you be able<br/>
to tell who read at 4 and who read at 13? I truly don&#39;t believe so.<br/>
&quot;Earlier is better&quot; is a complete myth. Human beings are wired to<br/>
learn skills at different ages, not the age that schools try to<br/>
convince you are proper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885452548">thank you, Ren --<br/>
I&#39;m saving this post for future warm fuzzies!<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the perspective from someone who has older children and who has been through this, and who also has a couple young ones who are closer in age to my own.<br/>
My 7yo sounds so much like your Jared.  And my 5yo like your 5.5yo.  Thank you for sharing your story and their experiences, it was the kick in the a** I needed to remember to TRUST my children!<br/>
And for those who don&#39;t understand, I can&#39;t make that my problem, and I will absolutely not make it my children&#39;s.<br/>
Many thanks, again,<br/>

<br/>
One word; SCHOOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have a real-life scenario that played out right before my eyes. The<br/>
neighbor kids in Pensacola hung out at our house virtually every day.<br/>
The boy was about the same age as Jared. As Jared joyfully pursued his<br/>
interests in Pokemon, video games, art and dragons he slowly built a<br/>
model of his universe, which included reading.<br/>
<br/>
Trai however, was in school, learning that he was dumb. Both of these<br/>
boys were on a very similar developmental schedule in terms of<br/>
reading. Jared never saw himself as flawed because he couldn&#39;t read.<br/>
Trai believed with all his heart that he was &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;learning<br/>
disabled&quot; and &quot;not very good at reading&quot;. He was only 9 years old when<br/>
he was telling us this stuff....by NINE years of age they had<br/>
convinced the child he wasn&#39;t good enough.<br/>
<br/>
If he grows up illiterate, it will be because enough damage had been<br/>
done early on, to convince this child he should give up. How many<br/>
illiterate adults do you know that didn&#39;t go to school? If they didn&#39;t<br/>
go to school, did they have interested, interesting adults sharing<br/>
their passions and helping them navigate the world? I highly doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, illiteracy would have been easier to understand<br/>
because homes weren&#39;t filled with books and computers and many<br/>
opportunities to read! That isn&#39;t true any longer. We live in the<br/>
information age folks!! There&#39;s no lack of resources for reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are probably more illiterate people in today&#39;s age than<br/>
in years past. All that school damage makes children give up. Once<br/>
you&#39;re convinced you&#39;re stupid, why bother?  <br/>
<br/>
Reading is completely natural. Every child will approach it in the<br/>
best way for them....with an interested, curious adult there to assist<br/>
them as needed, they WILL learn to read. <br/>
<br/>
The method in which Jared learned to spell was this:<br/>
&quot;Mom, how do you spell giraffe?&quot;<br/>
&quot;G-I-R-A-F-F-E&quot;<br/>
&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>
A few minutes later;<br/>
&quot;Mom, how do you spell English?&quot;<br/>
&quot;E-N-G-L-I-S-H&quot;<br/>
&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on......<br/>
He doesn&#39;t even ask that often anymore and it was just a few months<br/>
ago that he started writing. It will happen. For some it seems to be a<br/>
slower process that is built in small moments...for other it seems to<br/>
&quot;click&quot; overnight. In any case, I don&#39;t believe there will be many<br/>
illiterate unschoolers, if any.<br/>

Rachel was in preschool, at the age of four and a half, when one day  <br/>
she turned on me and vehemently said &quot;MOM! You can&#39;t *make* me learn  <br/>

Just another nail in the coffin of our public school attempt. So I  <br/>
learned my lesson, let her alone, and now at almost seven she&#39;s  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953069790">You are all right!  I guess I just wanted confirmation of what I <br/>
have been feeling.  This is the reason why we took out daughter out <br/>
of school 3 weeks ago.  She was coming home in a rotten mood - <br/>
saying things like, &quot;I am stupid and an idiot!  I hate myself!  I <br/>
hate school!&quot;  etc....  (all stemming from a ton of math homework)  <br/>
This all coming from a 7yr old -grade 3!  Not good!  And WHEN was <br/>
there time to develop a good self-esteem and fix this after 7 hours <br/>
in school and then another 2 hours of homework then supper and <br/>
bedtime?  It was ridiculous!  And then I stumbled across the concept <br/>
of unschooling. Did some research and decided to give it a go.  My <br/>
kids are still deschooling but almost immediately the pressure was <br/>
off and they have become much happier and they do not fight as much <br/>
anymore.  <br/>

~~ What is your opinion regarding all <br/>

<br/>
One word; SCHOOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have a real-life scenario that played out right before my eyes. The<br/>
neighbor kids in Pensacola hung out at our house virtually every day.<br/>
The boy was about the same age as Jared. As Jared joyfully pursued his<br/>
interests in Pokemon, video games, art and dragons he slowly built a<br/>
model of his universe, which included reading.<br/>
<br/>
Trai however, was in school, learning that he was dumb. Both of these<br/>
boys were on a very similar developmental schedule in terms of<br/>
reading. Jared never saw himself as flawed because he couldn&#39;t read.<br/>
Trai believed with all his heart that he was &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;learning<br/>
disabled&quot; and &quot;not very good at reading&quot;. He was only 9 years old when<br/>
he was telling us this stuff....by NINE years of age they had<br/>
convinced the child he wasn&#39;t good enough.<br/>
<br/>
If he grows up illiterate, it will be because enough damage had been<br/>
done early on, to convince this child he should give up. How many<br/>
illiterate adults do you know that didn&#39;t go to school? If they didn&#39;t<br/>
go to school, did they have interested, interesting adults sharing<br/>
their passions and helping them navigate the world? I highly doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, illiteracy would have been easier to understand<br/>
because homes weren&#39;t filled with books and computers and many<br/>
opportunities to read! That isn&#39;t true any longer. We live in the<br/>
information age folks!! There&#39;s no lack of resources for reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are probably more illiterate people in today&#39;s age than<br/>
in years past. All that school damage makes children give up. Once<br/>
you&#39;re convinced you&#39;re stupid, why bother? <br/>
<br/>
Reading is completely natural. Every child will approach it in the<br/>
best way for them....with an interested, curious adult there to assist<br/>
them as needed, they WILL learn to read. <br/>
<br/>
The method in which Jared learned to spell was this:<br/>
&quot;Mom, how do you spell giraffe?&quot;<br/>
&quot;G-I-R-A-F-F-E&quot;<br/>
&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>
A few minutes later;<br/>
&quot;Mom, how do you spell English?&quot;<br/>
&quot;E-N-G-L-I-S-H&quot;<br/>
&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on......<br/>
He doesn&#39;t even ask that often anymore and it was just a few months<br/>
ago that he started writing. It will happen. For some it seems to be a<br/>
slower process that is built in small moments...for other it seems to<br/>
&quot;click&quot; overnight. In any case, I don&#39;t believe there will be many<br/>
illiterate unschoolers, if any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943135157">I have watched that happen so many times.  kids in k and first grade with <br/>
teachers and parents all upset cause they cant read and the kids stop <br/>
trying.<br/>
<br/>
my ds is 5.  i dont know when he will read.  i do know he has some <br/>
sightwords on his videogames and he seems to know alot of letters and <br/>
numbers by sight.  the numbers are ones on pokemon cards like 10 and 20.  <br/>
today i asked if he wanted to help make some thankyou notes for his birthday <br/>
party friends.  he did so we all made cards. We painted and he had some <br/>
letter stickers so decided to put a letter sticker of the first letter of <br/>
each of his friends names on each letter.  Some he did on his own some he <br/>
asked about.  He also asked to how to write his friends names or asked me <br/>
to.  He signed all the cards.  None of this was staged or set up.  I thought <br/>
it was interesting that he noticed after writing ANNA that it was the same <br/>
forward and backward.  I just thought this was so much more natural a way to <br/>
learn these things than by staging a practice session for him to practice <br/>
writing and insisting he try to sound out words. etc.  he loves to write <br/>
books, make cards etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499575588">My son was talking like that in private christian school 2nd grade last year.  We pulled him out at Thanksgiving.  A year later, I am happy to say that there hasn&#39;t been an I hate myself in so long that until you mentioned it, I had forgot he had done it.  <br/>
<br/>
Today he asked why he had to know math as we never use it.  After the recent thread here, it was so easy to point out all the places in his life he uses math.  I got an ok, ok, so I do use it. <br/>
<br/>
As for reading, Ren you covered it extremely well.  For my son it was like a lightswitch, one day he wasn&#39;t reading, the next he was.  As for spelling, we are also on the same plan as you.  He asks, I tell him and as time passes he asks less and less.<br/>

The idea in school is that everyone needs to read at the same time.  The <br/>
school has a methodical way of &quot;teaching&quot; reading.  What they never consider <br/>
is reading is not something can be taught and that people only read when <br/>
they are ready to read.   So those children who are not ready at seven or <br/>
eight get slotted into the dumb group, get told they need special education, <br/>
are separated out and made to feel stupid, defective, different.   In every <br/>
interaction between teacher and kid the kid is never allowed to forget he&#39;s <br/>
missed the mark.<br/>
<br/>
Reading becomes a dreaded task.  Reading aloud is a lesson in humiliation. <br/>
It becomes easier to not read than to continue to try to read and suffer the <br/>
shame and segregation that brings.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know statistics on adult literacy but I&#39;d guess close to half the <br/>
people considered illiterate are immigrants who&#39;s first language is not <br/>
English.   Of the rest I&#39;d bet ALL of them went to school at least through <br/>
the early grades.<br/>
<br/>
I know a man who is considered illiterate.  He graduated high school when he <br/>
was eighteen.  He has friends who love him, a good paying job, a really <br/>
sweet wife, a nice home and cars.   He is not a member of the dregs of <br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every sign with words also has a picture, due in part to our many <br/>
residents and visitors who are not English speakers/readers.   Nearly all <br/>
products are labeled so that we know the contents by the graphic.  Much news <br/>
and information is transmitted via TV, video, audio and telephone.   While <br/>
reading is really useful the fact that there are people living well with <br/>
minimal reading skills is evidence it&#39;s not vital, at least not to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have a different approach to reading.   They believe that all <br/>
children who live in an environment where reading is a useful tool will <br/>
learn how to use that tool.   They&#39;ll want to use it because they&#39;ll see <br/>
it&#39;s useful.  They&#39;ll have opportunity to play and experiment with it <br/>
without pressure to master it.  They will have help when they want it and <br/>
peace when they don&#39;t.  They will know reading might come at the age of four <br/>
or seven or nine or nineteen but it will come and their psychology will not <br/>
be altered by shame and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a new concept for most people, that life is not ruined by later <br/>
reading.  In school life sucks for kids who are later readers but in adult <br/>
life, no one cares if you read at four or fourteen.   The real damage from <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302480118">Hi Christine,<br/>
In my interpretation of unschooling, you would let your son continue to do<br/>
what he&#39;s been doing (you said<br/>
&quot;teaching himself&quot;) without interfering. I would do lots of reading aloud<br/>
with him (with him next to you so he can see the print at the same time as<br/>
he hears you read the words) and leave have a variety of books and other<br/>
printed materials available for him, but if he&#39;s not interested in sounding<br/>
things out, I wouldn&#39;t push it. English is such a complex language<br/>
phonetically, that the best way to learn to read it IMO is by a combination<br/>
of strategies including phonics but also recognizing sight words from<br/>
context etc. At 6 he may or may not be developmentally ready or interested<br/>
to take the plunge, and that&#39;s OK! That&#39;s my $.02 :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704538844">Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use ideas/books/computer<br/>
for teaching reading.  Unschooling does mean knowing your child and<br/>
finding ways that each child thrives and enjoys using/doing/playing.<br/>
 <br/>
Every child is different.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son really LOVED Hooked on Phonics computer program.  He loved<br/>
putting stickers on the wall charter marking his progress.  To this day,<br/>
he LOVES computers.<br/>
 <br/>
My step-daughter LOVES video games.  She learned on the old Nintendo64<br/>
first with it being read to her, then her connecting the &#39;dots&#39; and reading<br/>
for herself.<br/>
 <br/>
All my kids have used the Abeka &#39;Little Blue Primer&#39; also.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling means more about learning to tune into your child and listening<br/>
to their whats, needs and desires.  <br/>
 <br/>
Do you live in a household that has happy readers?  If your child sees you<br/>
enjoying the written word, chances are, they will be curious and follow your<br/>
example.  If reading is shown to be miserable, they won&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
Take the same happy approach to &#39;schooling&#39; that you took to your child learning<br/>
to walk.  Supply a safe envirnment, hold out a hand when they ask, applaud them<br/>
smile, encourage, love and celebrate each small step.  Reading&#39;s the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Supply books of all levels and of their interest whether it be HOP, Abeka, Thomas <br/>
Jefferson, The Peanuts, Halo, or Superman, Thomas the Train, Hop on Pop.....etc.  <br/>
Sit down next to them and read to them if they want to.  Reading to a child who isn&#39;t <br/>
in the mood is a waste of time anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others in this group will have better ideas but theres a start.<br/>
Enjoy the journey!<br/>

frustrate him.<br/>

The very best thing you can do to help him read is understand that  <br/>
reading is as natural to learn as speaking.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s more on reading.<br/>
<br/>
*Schools* make learning to read hard and that gives society the idea  <br/>
that learning to read is unnatural and difficult and takes  <br/>
specialized materials and instruction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *not*. I can&#39;t emphasize that enough. Teachers need to herd 30  <br/>
kids through *one* type of reading process to prove to administrators  <br/>
and parents that they&#39;re making progress. *That process* is  <br/>
unnatural. It makes learning to read hard. It turns many off from  <br/>
reading. It demoralizes many kids, making them think they&#39;re stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Take away that process. Take away the pressure to read independently  <br/>
by age 9. Replace it with a relaxed atmosphere where the printed word  <br/>
is encountered for purposes that the *child* wants and needs in his  <br/>
right now life and reading will come.<br/>
<br/>
It may not come on the school schedule. Though most unschoolers do  <br/>
learn to read in the fairly typical 6-9 range, it&#39;s not unheard of  <br/>
that they don&#39;t read until 12 or 15. And the later readers *don&#39;t*  <br/>
start at first grade level. They were just waiting for one brain area  <br/>
to develop (while all the others needed for reading had already  <br/>
developed) and they&#39;re quickly reading at or above their age level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will<br/>
&gt; some of you who have had experience tell me how you taught your child<br/>
&gt; to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t teach her. I helped her learn.<br/>
<br/>
I made her experience with the written word pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I made sure she had access to the types of things she needed to read  <br/>
(walk throughs for games, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
I read to her (because she enjoyed that).<br/>
<br/>
We listened to books on tape.<br/>
<br/>

before and at times I get crazily concerned about it.  However, when  <br/>
I stop and think about him and how he has developed and matured I  <br/>
know that  one of these days when he&#39;s ready the reading and writing  <br/>
thing will kick in when his brain matures.  My son has never done  <br/>
anything in his life that he wasn&#39;t ready for.  It didn&#39;t matter who  <br/>
wanted him to do it or what was going on.  From walking to riding a  <br/>
bike to roller blading.  All the other kids would be out doing these  <br/>
things begging Austyn to participate.  No!  He just wouldn&#39;t and he  <br/>
was fine with that.  It didn&#39;t bother him at all he would play around  <br/>
and still have fun.  But when he was ready?  He hopped on his bike or  <br/>
skates or whatever and he was off.  I&#39;ll never forget when he started  <br/>
walking.  I turned around and there he was walking in circles around  <br/>
the room.... and that day he walked and walked and walked.  It was  <br/>
quite funny but he was ready.  I try to rest in the fact that that is  <br/>
who he is and that things like reading and writing are no different  <br/>
that biking and skating.  When&#39;s he&#39;s ready he&#39;ll pick up a book and/ <br/>
or a pin as though he&#39;s had the skill all of his life.  For the life  <br/>
of me I don&#39;t know why I get worried and crazy sometimes.  I guess  <br/>
during those times I get scared and stop trusting the process.<br/>

to share.  There are three unschooling girls that I know, one of <br/>
which is my daughter who, for whatever reason, latched onto Dick and <br/>
Jane books.  This was all at various times and independently done, <br/>
none of them knew the others where reading these books.  I shared <br/>
this with my mother since she used these books herself when she was a <br/>
little girl.  She is quite familiar with unschooling principles, and <br/>
thought it was particularly funny that children would freely <br/>
choose, &quot;such an ancient thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked my daughter (8) why she liked the books and she said that <br/>
they aren&#39;t like other books that try to teach you a lesson about <br/>
being a good kid. I had to agree.  The interactions amoung the kids <br/>
and the parents are quite sweet.<br/>

<br/>

kids through *one* type of reading process to prove to administrators<br/>

unnatural. It makes learning to read hard. It turns many off from<br/>

<br/>
This is SO true!  When I was teaching, there was so much talk about the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to teach children how to read.  I always wondered why teachers<br/>
were so resistant to the idea that maybe you have to look at each individual<br/>
child and teach them in their own way.  Now I know that even that is not the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to teach reading, because in fact you are not teaching, they are<br/>
learning!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach her. I helped her learn.<br/>
<br/>
I made her experience with the written word pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I made sure she had access to the types of things she needed to read<br/>
(walk throughs for games, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s funny, because when my son was in his preschool years, I thought I was<br/>
teaching him how to read.  One day we were visiting Nana and Papa, who don&#39;t<br/>
see our children very often, and they were surprised at how well he was<br/>
reading since the last time they saw him.  Trying to be funny, they asked<br/>
him, &quot;Who taught you how to read?&quot;  (They always joke about how lucky my<br/>
kids are to have a teacher as a mom!  These comments absolutely drive me<br/>
crazy now! )  To everyone&#39;s surprise, my son answered, &quot;No one.  I taught<br/>
myself!&quot;<br/>
It took me awhile to not get offended by that comment.  I used to think<br/>
about how much work I did to set up his environment so he would learn to<br/>
read, and how much effort I put forth to make sure he was &quot;reading&quot; things<br/>
he enjoyed, and that I never made reading look like a work--it was always<br/>
something fun.  How could he say that I didn&#39;t teach him to read?  And then,<br/>
as I am learning about unschooling, and the whole idea that I don&#39;t teach,<br/>
children learn; I finally get it!  I should be proud of myself that I set it<br/>
up and supported him so that he was able to learn to read on his own, not<br/>
that I taught him to read!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Joyce.  You are really helping me get a grasp of this whole<br/>
unschooling thing!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s look at this a different way:<br/>
&quot;that the best way to learn to speak a language IMO is by a<br/>
combination of strategies including word repetition but also hearing<br/>
words from context etc...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People utilize strategies that work best for them naturally.<br/>
Did you know the process inside your child&#39;s head for learning<br/>
language?  Not necessarily. Did it matter? Nope. The important factor<br/>
was hearing the spoken word. Not the spoken word being aimed towards<br/>
them with the intent of &quot;teaching&quot;...just hearing it naturally all<br/>
around them. That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is the same way. You don&#39;t need to utilize any strategies.<br/>
Your child HAS their strategies, just support them. Phonics is<br/>
overrated. Some people will want to know what letter sounds make. Some<br/>
never care. Reading is learned as naturally as the spoken word. Have<br/>
words around and available and it will be picked up in time. <br/>
