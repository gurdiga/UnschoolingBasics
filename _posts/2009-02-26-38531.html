<br/>
No specific topic... I was thinking that due to the number of conferences and amount of families that unschool nowadays, there would be more than two websites available with unschooling information. <br/>
<br/>
Only these two sites are being referenced and one being moreso than the other, it seems *odd*. Almost like hero worship... No offense intended. <br/>
<br/>
An example I can think of is similar to say...potato salad. There are several ways to make it but its basically the same with just a few extra/different ingredients. Can Joyce and Sandra be the {only} sources of information available? Do they make the best potato salad?? Enough so that I/we should all make it like theirs??....(Insert tacky recipe joke here)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the type that puts all my eggs in one basket - so taking one (or two) persons website(s) as the unschooling bible (just a comment-don&#39;t read anything into it) and just going with that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m willing to do. We help our children find out as much as they can about whatever it is they are looking for.. I am doing the same.<br/>
<br/>
 A lesson most folks have learned is that if you have questions and want to know more than do some research and look for more sources. That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. <br/>
<br/>
Take care ~ Dee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How many unschoolers are there? I think only 2% of the population  <br/>
homeschools. Maybe 2% of that unschools in some form.<br/>
<br/>
How many of that small population enjoy analyzing what they do, enjoy  <br/>
spending hours a week writing about it, enjoy spending hours  <br/>
compiling it and maintaining it, and can *find* the hours to do all  <br/>
that while unschooling? *And* then don&#39;t care if they make money from  <br/>
all those hours spent?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(There&#39;s also the cost of hosting the site and holding the domain  <br/>
name. And my thanks goes to Cindy Fox for her help in that for me! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, at first thought it seems surprising there aren&#39;t other sites,  <br/>
but from behind the scenes it&#39;s not so surprising. ;-) The only  <br/>
reason I compiled all my stuff is that 10 years in I realized all the  <br/>
hours I&#39;d put in was about 5 books worth and I had nothing to show  <br/>
for all that time. So I started mining archives before my writing  <br/>
went poof!<br/>
<br/>
There are collections of essays around. There are blogs. (Sandra has  <br/>
a good collection as a place to begin.) The archives of lists and  <br/>
sare lots easier to search now. It&#39;s not the same as the online  <br/>
collections Sandra and I have, but they&#39;re not as labor intensive!<br/>

&gt; No specific topic... I was thinking that due to the number of<br/>
&gt; conferences and amount of families that unschool nowadays, there<br/>
&gt; would be more than two websites available with unschooling<br/>
&gt; information. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because we unschoolers tend to be so grassroots, and so motley, &lt;G&gt; <br/>
learning about unschooling tends to be a grassroots and ostensibly <br/>
disorderly journey.  The underground is where the real learning <br/>
occurs.  Has been my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read a bunch on Holt&#39;s site -- you might enjoy that.  This link <br/>
brings you to An Unschooling Seminar, which I haven&#39;t viewed, but <br/>
might be helpful?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/tyoanunschooling.html">http://www.holtgws.com/tyoanunschooling.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The whole site has loads of reading, including copies of articles <br/>
from old Growing Without School magazines authored by an eclectic <br/>
bunch of early pioneers in the unschooling movement.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s site is another online place for information <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a crappy website, in my opinion ... at least visually, I <br/>
don&#39;t find it friendly.  But the content is there, and if you&#39;re <br/>
looking for a breadth of research about unschooling, this is a place <br/>
to definitely include.<br/>
<br/>
The National Film Board of Canada has launched an online initiative <br/>
called Citizenshift:  Online Media for Social Change, which features <br/>
an Unschooling forum.  I think I have a photo essay there ... if the <br/>
upload was successful?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://citizen.nfb.ca/node/20054">http://citizen.nfb.ca/node/20054</a><br/>
<br/>
And, for more Canadian content, I wrote this feature last year that <br/>
might be interesting to read?  My assignment was to write about <br/>
HOMESCHOOLing but I tried to steer the content as unobtrusively as I <br/>
could in favour of UNschooling.  Some of my contribution was edited <br/>
into and out of, but, yeah, there&#39;s a gist here ...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Mostly I&#39;ve fashioned my growing sense of unschooling by hanging in <br/>
places like this, and Unschooling Canada, (another yahoo group) <br/>
talking with, and developing relationships with other moms and dads <br/>
committed to the principles of unschooling.  Hopefully some of this <br/>
helps you Dee? <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the above comments (in only two e-mails), you want us not to take  <br/>
offense, but you are asking the same questions over and over, while  <br/>
commenting that you just can&#39;t believe that Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s sites  <br/>
are so often linked, inferring how their advice, suggestions, and  <br/>
compiled opinions could never be as good as we believe them to be.<br/>
<br/>
It feels a little like you&#39;re spoiling for a fight, or at least  <br/>
someone to say &quot;oh, you&#39;re right - they couldn&#39;t possibly know all  <br/>
there is to know about unschooling.&quot; So far, everyone&#39;s been pretty  <br/>
patient, providing other links, as you requested.<br/>
<br/>
The reason those websites are linked is because Joyce and Sandra (and  <br/>
Pam Sorooshian, too) have been consistent in their thoughts, actions,  <br/>
and helpfulness throughout the years since unschooling was just an  <br/>
idea not well understood. They all have adult or close-to-adult,  <br/>
living, breathing children as examples of how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
When we send folks to Joyce&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s sites, it&#39;s because they  <br/>
have pretty much everything one needs to unschool. I&#39;ve recently  <br/>
enjoyed sending people to the link to Pam&#39;s writings on Sandra&#39;s site.  <br/>
Very, very good stuff. Here is one especially fine article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto">http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto</a><br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate to have the writings of  Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen,  <br/>
Rue Cream, Meredith, Schuyler, Diana, Debra and others on this list,  <br/>
though. They&#39;ve truly thought long and hard about unschooling and have  <br/>
lived it and continue to live and learn it. I love to read what they  <br/>
write. They&#39;re &quot;golden,&quot; too. And they are on Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy Danielle Conger&#39;s Organic Learning site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.organiclearning.org/">http://www.organiclearning.org/</a><br/>
(where there are back issues of &quot;Connections&quot; an online e-zine, which  <br/>
has ceased publication, but are available now to everyone).<br/>
<br/>
I suggest Googling &quot;unschooling&quot; or &quot;radical unschooling&quot;. You&#39;ll find  <br/>
plenty of ideas and sites that may or may not appeal to you.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help people on this list to unschool if you are bent on  <br/>
saying the same dismissive thing five or more ways. Unless, of course,  <br/>
you are trying to figure out how to unschool yourself. Then tell us  <br/>
how old your kids are, about your unschooling journey, and then ask  <br/>
your questions. Plenty of help right here, regardless of links to  <br/>
websites.<br/>

John Taylor Gatto isn&#39;t an unschooling advocate, in my opinion. He&#39;s an <br/>

He tells people why not school. What to do instead, not so much. :)<br/>

Where has *anyone* suggested that either site is complete and full  <br/>

explore and ask questions. I don&#39;t list everywhere people could  <br/>

<br/>
The two sites not only save having to explain the basics again and  <br/>
again, but they provide an easily accessible taste of unschooling so  <br/>
people can decide for themselves whether they want to learn more.  <br/>
That used to be difficult. Each new person had to either mine the  <br/>
archives of a list, wading through months of posts that weren&#39;t  <br/>
directed at the questions they had, or ask directly for an  <br/>
introduction to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why would the suggestion of two sites prevent *you* from exploring  <br/>
beyond them? Why are you asking for others to do your work for you?<br/>

I can&#39;t imagine you would go to a car lot and buy a car based on a few peoples recommendations... You&#39;d research cars until you were absolutely confident that it was the right choice for you. <br/>
<br/>
Look, this was an innocent inquiry. If this is to be a safe group to ask and get answers to unschooling then you need to stop reading something into nothing!! <br/>

<br/>
No, it&#39;s an insult to ask for resources and when people freely <br/>
volunteer their time and energy to give you resources, you bitch <br/>
about it. If you don&#39;t like the resources you&#39;ve been freely handed, <br/>
by people who volunteer their time to give a perfect stranger help, <br/>
there are better ways to get more resources. Asking for more would be <br/>
understandable...but complaining about it? Yuck.<br/>
Be an autodidact and find your own resources if you don&#39;t like the <br/>
ones people are freely handing you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~If unschooling is about respecting a person/childs needs then why <br/>
is it that there seems to be some hostility about my asking for more <br/>
sources or references?? Isn&#39;t this a place to ask about help into <br/>
unschooling?? ~~<br/>
<br/>
Asking for more is fine. Complaining about the ones given is just <br/>
ugly. If you can&#39;t find enough resources at those sites, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even know where to begin to send you, since Sandra&#39;s is a collection <br/>
of TONS of people&#39;s work/writings/experiences and links to nearly <br/>
everything.<br/>
 <br/>
This is one resource, I&#39;m sure as a capable adult you are able to <br/>
find other resources if the ones we give here don&#39;t suit <br/>
you....rather than tell everyone that their links aren&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the people here and at sites we list have spent hours and <br/>
days and YEARS lending a helping hand to people learning about <br/>
unschooling. I myself have spent the better part of a decade on <br/>
lists, learning and discussing. I don&#39;t have much patience for people <br/>
who ask for help and then complain about the free help they get.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, I guess asking unschoolers for more references is an insult then. If unschooling is about respecting a person/childs needs then why is it that there seems to be some hostility about my asking for more sources or references?? Isn&#39;t this a place to ask about help into unschooling? ? <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine you would go to a car lot and buy a car based on a few peoples recommendations. .. You&#39;d research cars until you were absolutely confident that it was the right choice for you. <br/>
<br/>
Look, this was an innocent inquiry. If this is to be a safe group to ask and get answers to unschooling then you need to stop reading something into nothing!! <br/>
<br/>
Take care ~ Dee<br/>

You *are* saying that the people who have spent years helping others <br/>
understand unschooling haven&#39;t thought about it, only followed <br/>
blindly what two people have distilled for them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; An example I can think of is similar to say...potato salad. There <br/>
&gt; are several ways to make it but its basically the same with just a <br/>
&gt; few extra/different ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
Potato salad?? How long does it take to write out a potato salad <br/>
recipe? About 2 minutes?<br/>
<br/>
I calculated it out. I&#39;ve spent at least 14,000 hours helping <br/>
unschoolers. I bet Sandra has spent at least that much too. How many <br/>
unschoolers have that much time or want to spend that much time <br/>
writing and compiling? Why should it be surprising that there are <br/>
only two websites with the kind of breadth that ours have? You&#39;re <br/>
*seriously* underestimating the time it takes to create something <br/>
like those websites and suggesting lots of people could do it.<br/>
<br/>
Our sites are more akin to an introduction to Italian cooking. Potato <br/>
salad indeed.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so taking one (or two) persons website(s) as the unschooling bible <br/>
&gt; (just a comment-don&#39; t read anything into it) and just going with <br/>
&gt; that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m willing to do.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to read anything into it. It&#39;s pretty plainly stated.<br/>
<br/>
Where has *anyone* suggested that either site is complete and full <br/>
knowledge of unschooling? I state on my front page that it&#39;s a <br/>
beginning point and then give links to where people can continue to <br/>
explore and ask questions. I don&#39;t list everywhere people could <br/>
explore since I trust people know how to use Google. I just offer a <br/>
platform to begin from. Sandra&#39;s is more like an entire train <br/>
station, but they&#39;re both still beginning places.<br/>
<br/>
The two sites not only save having to explain the basics again and <br/>
again, but they provide an easily accessible taste of unschooling so <br/>
people can decide for themselves whether they want to learn more. <br/>
That used to be difficult. Each new person had to either mine the <br/>
archives of a list, wading through months of posts that weren&#39;t <br/>
directed at the questions they had, or ask directly for an <br/>
introduction to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why would the suggestion of two sites prevent *you* from exploring <br/>
beyond them? Why are you asking for others to do your work for you?<br/>
<br/>
The above may sound outraged, but those are all legitimate questions. <br/>
You&#39;re skimming the surface and not seeing the logistics of creating <br/>
a big picture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393677855">Thank you Joyce. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I asked to much when I asked for places of more information. I will continue to look for more information throughout whether it has depth or not because I am the kind of person who will look and look and look until I feel I have read enough and am confident that I know enough to make this a way of life. <br/>
<br/>
All the words I wrote were of curiosity and not of ill intent. I do not like conflict and I don&#39;t like how much time I have had to spend *defending* my search for more resources. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you who offered help but I will admit that I will hesitate before asking anything from this group again.  If anyone has anything *helpful* they can suggest feel free to contact me off-line. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482983997">A quick google search brings about Results 1 - 10 of about 122,000 for unschooling.  (0.07 seconds) ...so of those 122,000 hits there will be some repetition or it leads to pages other than the main page of a blog, website, etc. (key goal for good SEO practices is to get every page in the search engine) but if by putting the word unschooling into the google search does not bear enough information above and beyond the resources I have found from this list alone, then I was suggest different search engines, keeping in mind that generally speaking if google finds the other search engines will pretty much vomit up the same links. <br/>
<br/>
Glancing over a website will not actually give you any kind of clear picture of the wealth of information contain within. Developing a good website of any kind takes years. Keeping it fresh and new takes hours per day. The amount of work these ladies have put into their websites is amazing. But if you have only scratched the surface you have missed so much. Comments on blogs or about articles push the authors of the websites to put out even more information, to understand where some of their own words come from knowing what other people have said helps tremendously. And honestly most websites that are meant as a resource have tons of links, articles, etc contributed from multiple authors. That is what makes them more complete. <br/>
<br/>
Now if you are looking for general homeschooling sites then you will need to change your search criteria. Keep in mind in through out and in the back of a number of books about unschooling are other reference links. It takes some time to build up a list of places to go on the web that have good information. But as a parent isn&#39;t it our own responsibility to research these things for our own growth? Asking for assistance is wonderful but a better example for our children is to be proactive about things and going out and doing the research. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t care to spend a lot of time on the computer most days, so being<br/>
able to find what I am looking for quickly is important to me.&quot; I can understand time being a precious commodity and the desire to find information quickly being important. But as of yet I have not found a quick way to do research other than spending time doing it. And I unfortunately have a lot of research to do daily. That happens with college courses and with two children who love to ask questions that I do not know the answers to.<br/>

A nice post on family meetings. We used to do this regularly, especially<br/>
when the kids were younger. But now life just seems too busy! I know that<br/>
having meetings over drinks always helped our unschooling flow, though...Am<br/>
thinking of doing this informally, tonight after Mass, so we can talk about<br/>
Lenten reading choices...Anyone do family meetings/discussions?<br/>

  &gt; Potato salad?? How long does it take to write out a potato salad <br/>
  &gt; recipe? About 2 minutes?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I calculated it out. I&#39;ve spent at least 14,000 hours helping <br/>
  &gt; unschoolers. I bet Sandra has spent at least that much too. How <br/>
  many <br/>
  &gt; unschoolers have that much time or want to spend that much time <br/>
  &gt; writing and compiling? Why should it be surprising that there are <br/>
  &gt; only two websites with the kind of breadth that ours have? You&#39;re <br/>
  &gt; *seriously* underestimating the time it takes to create something <br/>
  &gt; like those websites and suggesting lots of people could do it.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Our sites are more akin to an introduction to Italian cooking. <br/>
  Potato <br/>
  &gt; salad indeed.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; so taking one (or two) persons website(s) as the unschooling <br/>
  bible <br/>
  &gt; &gt; (just a comment-don&#39;t read anything into it) and just going with <br/>
  &gt; &gt; that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m willing to do.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; No one needs to read anything into it. It&#39;s pretty plainly stated.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Where has *anyone* suggested that either site is complete and full <br/>
  &gt; knowledge of unschooling? I state on my front page that it&#39;s a <br/>
  &gt; beginning point and then give links to where people can continue <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; explore and ask questions. I don&#39;t list everywhere people could <br/>
  &gt; explore since I trust people know how to use Google. I just offer <br/>
  a <br/>
  &gt; platform to begin from. Sandra&#39;s is more like an entire train <br/>
  &gt; station, but they&#39;re both still beginning places.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The two sites not only save having to explain the basics again and <br/>
  &gt; again, but they provide an easily accessible taste of unschooling <br/>
  so <br/>
  &gt; people can decide for themselves whether they want to learn more. <br/>
  &gt; That used to be difficult. Each new person had to either mine the <br/>
  &gt; archives of a list, wading through months of posts that weren&#39;t <br/>
  &gt; directed at the questions they had, or ask directly for an <br/>
  &gt; introduction to unschooling.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Why would the suggestion of two sites prevent *you* from exploring <br/>
  &gt; beyond them? Why are you asking for others to do your work for you?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The above may sound outraged, but those are all legitimate <br/>
  questions. <br/>
  &gt; You&#39;re skimming the surface and not seeing the logistics of <br/>
  creating <br/>
  &gt; a big picture.<br/>

about parenting, but segues nicely with unschooling.<br/>

&gt; Honestly, I would also suggest Free At Last by Daniel Greenberg, the  <br/>
&gt; founder of the first Sudbury school in the U.S. in 1968.  Very  <br/>
&gt; affirming and inspirational for unschoolers, bearing in mind it is  <br/>
&gt; also about the functioning of a school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, Jan Fortune-Wood&#39;s books, esp. Doing It Their Way.<br/>
