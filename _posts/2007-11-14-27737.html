<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030532662">Hello - Is there anybody in New Hampshire?  I have just joined this group and am pretty new to unschooling (the ability to put a name to it at least).  <br/>
<br/>
Do you feel that your socioeconomic status is a driving force behind deciding to unschool - Can you do it without financial resources?  Does there seem to be a common thread?  <br/>
<br/>
I know that this is right but could really use some confidence and family support but can&#39;t seem to get them to understand what is happening.  Any suggestions?  Readings?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

Oh yeah - I have two boys 4 and 7.  My 7 has been fully emerged in &quot;special education&quot; since he was three.  It is amazing how fast they learn when you take the stress away.</div>

&gt; I appreciated this comment, there are all sorts of us.  I happen to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be one of the one&#39;s that is recieving some help from the government <br/>
for food. I also recieve child support and that helps alot.  I did <br/>
work while my kids were in school but always had to quit in the <br/>
summers because of the cost of full time care was so high I would <br/>
just be making enough to send my kids to daycare. That was such a <br/>
miserable time , not because I didn&#39;t want to work, but I didnt want <br/>
to be away from my kids.  I could work full time now, well if I found <br/>
someone to watch them but I dont want to lose anymore time with them. <br/>
So to the outside world I mostly look like a loser, who doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to work, but I work night and day to keep my household going, we all <br/>
know the deal, chef, taxi, event planner, schedule coordinator, it&#39;s <br/>
alot of work and very undervalued. According to some income calulator <br/>
I saw before stay at home parents would be recieveing about $123,000 <br/>
a year if the position was a paid position.  I wonder if a single <br/>
parent would be paid even higher because there is no one to share the <br/>
work with. So I stay home with my children even though I may be <br/>
looked upon badly, by to those who naysay, I say the little bit of <br/>
help I recieve each month is a good investment they get someone who <br/>
will impart values to their children and spend time with them so they <br/>
don&#39;t end up in jail. Sorry I rambled!</div>

died. We&#39;ve never qualified for food stamps and I&#39;ve accepted rental<br/>
assistance (though the privacy invasion was never worth the tiny rent<br/>
discount). The kids have done team sports at the Y & art classes at the<br/>
local Art Pavilion, both with the help of scholarships. I&#39;ve asked for<br/>
memberships to the zoo and museums as holiday gifts. Family has been really<br/>
good about gifting us with cards for the movie theatre, movie rentals and<br/>
the game store - fun stuff we can&#39;t always afford. I don&#39;t consider such<br/>
things *charity* ~ I figger I&#39;m doing my part to give folks/organizations an<br/>
opportunity to be generous with someone deserving & incredibly grateful :D<br/>
Now that Hayden is 9, working is easier as he&#39;s better able to understand<br/>
the benefits of employment ($$) and able to figure out what he wants to do<br/>
while I&#39;m working. I got a job at a GREAT local coffee shop where I can work<br/>
a day shift while Hayden stays home with Super Cool Boyfriend, Scotty, an<br/>
evening shift when Hayden can stay with my friends (also happen to be the<br/>
owners of said shop), or a night baking shift when he can come in with me<br/>
and read/watch movies/surf the net while I work.<br/>
This is the first job I&#39;ve had as a single mama, so I can&#39;t talk to working<br/>
solo when kids are younger. When DH was alive, we worked opposite shifts to<br/>
accommodate the kids always being with one of us. There were times when H<br/>
was a baby that I worked as an interpreter for the Deaf (low hours & high<br/>
pay), we created a great arrangement with one of my stay-home-mama friends,<br/>
whom my kids adored and wanted to hang out with anyway.<br/>

Do you feel that your socioeconomic status is a driving force behind <br/>
deciding to<br/>
unschool - Can you do it without financial resources?  Does there seem <br/>
to be a<br/>
common thread?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I think there is every socio-economic status represented here on these <br/>
lists. Seriously. I&#39;ve been to several homes of list members, and in my <br/>
experience it&#39;s across the board!<br/>
<br/>
Having money makes a LOT of things easier, including unschooling. But I <br/>
don&#39;t think unschooling has to be all that limited due to finances. I <br/>
think a computer is a must-have---even if you don&#39;t own one, just <br/>
having access to one is a biggie (the library comes to mind first!). <br/>
SOOO many things can be bought cheaply, borrowed, bartered for, worked <br/>
for, received as gifts, and found free (freecycle) that I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
a creative person not finding something he really needs cheaply.<br/>
<br/>
The common thread? Trust, Respect, Generosity, Patience, Kindness, and <br/>
Curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is right but could really use some confidence and <br/>
family<br/>
support but can&#39;t seem to get them to understand what is happening.  <br/>
Any<br/>
suggestions?  Readings?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What family? Husband? or extended family? It&#39;s really none of the <br/>
extended family&#39;s business. Hubby needs to be as on board as possible. <br/>
What family do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have that long, laundry list of books I sent here not too <br/>
long ago?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah - I have two boys 4 and 7.  My 7 has been fully emerged in <br/>
&quot;special<br/>
education&quot; since he was three.  It is amazing how fast they learn when <br/>
you take<br/>
the stress away.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Abraham Maslow. NO ONE learns when under extreme stress. The more <br/>
peaceful and gentle the environment is, the more an individual can <br/>
learn. Schools are difficult places to learn.<br/>
