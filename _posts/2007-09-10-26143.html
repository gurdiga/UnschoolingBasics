<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301431998">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kathryn and I have only recently signed up on e-groups.  <br/>
Please excuse any ignorance on my behalf!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to introduce myself - I have two children.  Mia is 5 and <br/>
Jude is 2.  Baby expected late January.  We are located, Melbourne, <br/>
Australia - don&#39;t suppose there are any locals out there???  <br/>
<br/>
I understand my children are not &#39;school age&#39; anyway, but I certainly <br/>
am going to need support as at next year!  I&#39;m sure there will (and <br/>
already is!) a lot of questions being fired at me about why/how/, <br/>
etc. . . truth is, the &#39;natural learning&#39; approach is the only thing I <br/>
am sure of!!<br/>
<br/>
Love to get peoples experiences with radical unschooling.  Just to have <br/>
stories shared.  It&#39;s going to take a little time for me to embrace <br/>
TV/junk food . . . the philosophy behind it all I COMPLETELY <br/>
understand.  It&#39;s my ever so deep conditioning holding me back . . . <br/>
baby steps . . .</div>
