 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it would help your daughter to see the admissions requirements<br/>
for colleges and universities and how those requirements have<br/>
specifically addressed home educated people.  Also, remind her that<br/>
success is not based on being a doctor or lawyer or other &quot;big money<br/>
job&quot; but by how one values what one does.  I work at a minimum wage<br/>
job.  Some people would say that I am not a &quot;success&quot; because I only<br/>
make minimum.  However, I value what I do.  I love working in a<br/>
bookstore and being around books all day and helping people find that<br/>
perfect (or obscure) book, seeing the smile on their faces when they<br/>
get that bag with a treasure in it.  I also work in my store&#39;s cafe as<br/>
a barista some days and I enjoy that as well.  Steaming milk, mixing<br/>
drinks, helping people who are undecided find the beverage they are<br/>
looking for, seeing their eyes light up when I ask them if they would<br/>
like me to heat their brownie for them.  I&#39;m appreciated by my boss as<br/>
I don&#39;t whine about the hours given to me (although they are VERY<br/>
accomodating with my schedule for the kids&#39; activities and needs),<br/>
I&#39;ve gone in several times to cover someone who is sick, my drawer is<br/>
almost always perfect to the penny, and I am flexible in being able to<br/>
do the tasks that they ask of me.  I enjoy my job, I do it well, and<br/>
I&#39;m happy.  Am I not a success?<br/>
<br/>
A home educated child (un or otherwise) who has a desire to be a<br/>
doctor or lawyer will work towards that goal as long as s/he has the<br/>
support of his/her parents.  And while there is no fancy list of<br/>
&quot;average people who are successful through homeschooling&quot; I would<br/>
hazard that there are homeschooled doctors and lawyers.  BTW, my<br/>
veterinarian homeschooled his kids and his oldest daughter is entering<br/>
her first year at Auburn&#39;s School of Veterinarian Medicine.  He said<br/>
she practically grew up in the vet&#39;s office and probably knows as much<br/>
about veterinary medicine as he does.<br/>

<br/>
AH! Every parent&#39;s dream--a respected doctor or lawyer for a child!<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled or unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
My adult daughter says she will feel better if I can point one out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s concerned---why? How is she a part of her siblings&#39; <br/>
educations?<br/>
<br/>
She should be assured that an unschooled child can do/become anything <br/>
he wants. Pointing &quot;one&quot; out will make her feel better?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling (as the current &quot;movement&quot;) has only been around for less <br/>
than 20 years. John Holt coined the phrase in the early 80&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
*ALL* doctors and lawyers who practiced before compulsory education was <br/>
required were unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the fully unschooled children today are *just* coming to <br/>
college/grad-school age.<br/>
<br/>
I do know of *one* vet school student/veterinarian who got in without <br/>
even a college degree. She simply took the minimum college classes that <br/>
were required by the vet school. Got in with no problem. Children who <br/>
have MORE time and MORE access to those in their desired fields will <br/>
have more hands-on knowledge that vet/med/law schools love to see.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We homeschool her siblings and would like to homeschool her daughter <br/>
when<br/>
the time comes. She is looking of some reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You will homeschooling *her* daughter? Or she will? In some states <br/>
that&#39;s illegal: in SC it *must* be the parent who does the <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot;---not a grandparent or a sibling or neighbor. Know your <br/>
state&#39;s laws.<br/>
<br/>
Why isn&#39;t she doing the investigation? We learn best when we&#39;re <br/>
interested in the subject matter. With the internet, she could probably <br/>
find *one* doctor or lawyer to ease her mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414469864">I know a person in medical school now who was home schooled (but not <br/>
unschooled, sorry) her entire life. <br/>
<br/>
I also got into vet school without a college degree.  It isn&#39;t that <br/>
unusual to be able to get into school with just your required classes.  <br/>
It may be getting harder now but it happens.  I think if you look around <br/>
she&#39;ll find that experience counts for more than degrees.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012417226">My daughter is in Med school and getting a PhD at the same time. I <br/>
have her daughter and homeschool six of my nine children at the same <br/>
time. So, she is not doing the homeschooling of her daughter because <br/>
she is a full time double doc student. Her husband is in Mexico <br/>
getting his MD as well (He is mexican, they met there). Gloria is 1 <br/>
year old today, so Hannah is not so concerened about her education <br/>
yet. But I want to get her some facts so that I can have Gloria with <br/>
me. It is still up to her parents. But I will miss her if she leaves. <br/>
<br/>
I know there are homeschooled doctors out there, and I think if I can <br/>
show her some she will see that it is possible to homeschool and <br/>
still have all your options open. She herself did well in public <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
As for every parents dream... I just want them to be happy. But, I <br/>
have seen what unhappy can do to them. Hannah is still a pretty new <br/>
mom and all that is to be worked out, we each walk our own road. <br/>
<br/>
Please keep sending names if/when you find them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Again, whether you can home educate a child who you are not parent/legal<br/>
guardian of  varies from state to state. I haven&#39;t seen any indication<br/>
where you are but since you are already home educating your kids, you<br/>
probably already know where to go and check out the laws. For example,<br/>
in Delaware, there are separate options for establishing a &quot;single<br/>
family homeschool&quot; which is parents/guardians and their own kids and a<br/>
&quot;multi-family homeschool&quot; which is when the children being educated are<br/>
not related as siblings (which would fit in your circumstance). In VT,<br/>
the &quot;home study program&quot; is offered to not more than 2 non-family<br/>
members or the children of one other family. So, in that case, you<br/>
-could- home educate your granddaughter because she is 1 non-family<br/>
member/child of one other family besides your immediate offspring. And<br/>
some states, like CT, have no regulation one way or the other as to how<br/>
you educate your children (parents are to educate their children per CGS<br/>
10-184, but there&#39;s nothing that indicates how that is to be<br/>
accomplished - public school, private school, tutors, co-ops, home<br/>
education, or any combination thereof).<br/>
