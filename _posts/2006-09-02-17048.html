<div id="ygrps-yiv-136538285">It is so refreshing to look through all the albums in the unschooling <br/>
photo page.  My daughter and I enjoy flipping through the albums and <br/>
putting faces with the names on the group.  If everyone would post when <br/>
they update or add an album it would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Day,<br/>
