You go, girl!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m jazzed because I finally have something to put in my state requirement  <br/>
portfolio!  Hee hee.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids did the craziest flip contest and I&#39;m not quite sure we got them  all <br/>
&quot;correctly&quot; recorded.....but one child got five and five and the other  <br/>
four/six tails.  So we didn&#39;t totally screw the results.  :)<br/>

Casey got a good laugh out of both of those. At first she wanted to print the worksheet until she saw how unecessary it was. She thought the certificate was kind of pathetic. She may have found it cool a couple of years ago though. She liked stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
We had fun with the activity and Casey really liked the idea of being part of a huge one day experiment. We flipped the regular way and then tested to see if it changed much based on whether you started heads or tails. (It didn&#39;t.) We also followed a couple of their links and found some cool money tricks and probability sites. <br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
