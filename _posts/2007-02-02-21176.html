<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008453309">And I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying them then because, quoting from North American Wildlife:  An Illustrated Guide to Plants and Animals:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The garden carrot is a large-rooted variety of Queen Anne&#39;s Lace.  The wild variety&#39;s roots are also edible, but there is danger of confusing it with any of several poisonous plants, such as Poison Hemlock...  Look for the dark flower that is usually found in the center of the lacy, white umbel of Queen Anne&#39;s Lace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Re Poison Hemlock...  &quot;All parts of the plant are deadly; it was the source of the poison used to exceute Socrates...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Wilderness Awareness School&#39;s Kamana program (an awesome naturalist training course by mail) makes a big deal about not eating wild carrot.<br/>

And all the cultivated varieties of carrots came from wild carrots.  Wild <br/>
<br/>
carrots don&#39;t taste very good and are only edible (if you can even call it <br/>
<br/>
that)  when they&#39;re very young and tender.   The beautiful Queen Anne&#39;s Lace <br/>
<br/>
is the flower of the wild carrot.  <br/>
