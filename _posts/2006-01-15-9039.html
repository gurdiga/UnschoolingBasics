<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977565487">Leslie, thank you so much for your suggestions on &quot;being in the<br/>
moment&quot;.  I&#39;ve started really watching my kids and it *really* does<br/>
help.   I have Eckhart Tolle on reserve at the library now :). <br/>

Danielle, wow on your revision of the &quot;Mean Mom&quot;, it really shows the<br/>
difference of unschooling</div>

You are welcome!  I read the other day, coincidentally, that watching  <br/>
children is a great relaxation/mediatation.  Wish I could remember where,  but I&#39;ve <br/>
been going through a ton of books lately (my mom is getting rid of  them).  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope you enjoy the Eckhart Tolle.  Let me know what you think!<br/>
 <br/>
Danielle, I also appreciate your revision!  Excellent!<br/>
