<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800085987">Since my oldest has turned 6 and all her friends started kindergarten,<br/>
I&#39;ve been delving more deeply into the idea of RADICAL unschooling.<br/>
The academic side of unschooling (which I discovered 3 years ago) was<br/>
rather easy for me to grasp and is a perfect fit for our family.<br/>
However, the radical side has been harder to get my mind around, and I<br/>
seem to get stuck on the littlest things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve finally decided to try to eliminate all the food limits I had. I<br/>
didn&#39;t have many, and have never forced my children to eat all the<br/>
food on their plate, and our meal times aren&#39;t rigid and I usually let<br/>
them snack whenever. But now I want to let them decide when and how<br/>
and what to eat...but I have one question - what tips do you use to<br/>
eliminate food from being wasted?<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is this: when I cook, or fix something to eat, often times<br/>
my children (the two oldest are 6 and 4) will say they want more than<br/>
one food item. So I&#39;ll prepare it for them. But then they start eating<br/>
and realize that they don&#39;t want both, after all. Now, sometimes the<br/>
food is fine and can be refrigerated, but other times they took so<br/>
long to eat (or not eat) or the food was cheese or something that<br/>
becomes hard, or stale, or otherwise less than appetizing to eat<br/>
later. And I don&#39;t mind that it wasn&#39;t eaten, but for budgeting and<br/>
wasting less in general, I wonder if there&#39;s another way to offer them<br/>
anything they want without letting food go bad?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that this won&#39;t last as the older my kids get the more<br/>
they will be able to discern how much of which each food they want, or<br/>
at least sample a little before getting huge amounts, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Also, with babies (I have almost 15 month old twins), I usually just<br/>
put a little variety on their trays, same as what we are eating, since<br/>
they can&#39;t tell me what they want. Most times they sample some of all,<br/>
but don&#39;t eat much of it. But I wonder if any of you do something<br/>
different for the littlest ones (they are still nursing, so I think<br/>
that&#39;s a lot of it.)<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, I&#39;m learning that everything I thought I knew about<br/>
nutrition is kind of out the window with radical unschooling! So I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if there&#39;s ever a point to where you intervene with a<br/>
child&#39;s diet? If they become overweight? If they never consume<br/>
calcium? (my kids have all refused the bottle and never liked milk<br/>
after weaned, and don&#39;t particularly like broccoli or spinach,<br/>
either...but I just have hoped that they don&#39;t need it, then...) What<br/>
if they have special needs, like cystic fibrosis? (a new friend I made<br/>
feeds her son enzymes depending on what he eats.) Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any and all tips!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159893755">Congratulations on being ready to trust your kids food choices. For<br/>
those of us who love food (cooking and eating!) it is a hard step to<br/>
take. At my house, my kids can eat what they want, but that does<br/>
not mean I stopped sharing information about nutrition, food waste,<br/>
or ways to keep your body healthy and strong. Here are some<br/>
questions that I can be heard to ask or say:<br/>
* are you munchy or starving?<br/>
* would you like some water while I make a snack for you?<br/>
* I know you are very hungry now. Do you want a portion of<br/>
dinner now so you can eat dinner with the rest of us in about<br/>
* 15 minutes? <br/>
* Would it work for you to eat this first and then I¹ll make the<br/>
other thing if you are still hungry?<br/>
* Can I make that second thing you want after I eat with you?<br/>
* Wow, you want a bagel, sausage, cereal, and something sweet<br/>
for breakfast? (from my 5 year old) Which one shall we start with?<br/>
* I think I¹ll save this for later. If you find that you have space,<br/>
I¹ll be happy to get it back out for you (so you can not leave the<br/>
food sitting out for long periods of time)<br/>
* Wow, this cheese has been sitting out and has gotten hard<br/>
and yucky. I think I can use it in cooking, but I wouldn¹t want to<br/>
just sit here and eat it. Next time, can you let me know if you¹re<br/>
not going to eat it so I can wrap it up and put it in the fridge<br/>
please? I prefer not let food get thrown away when someone could<br/>
have eaten it instead.<br/>
* You¹d like 27 sandwiches? I think that might be enough for<br/>
everyone¹s snack. Can we all share? Or you can cut the sandwich<br/>
into tiny pieces ­ 27 of them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can suggest foods that can sit out for longer periods of<br/>
time. Maybe make a snack area or a tray of sitting-out-for-a-long-time<br/>
foods that they can access anytime.<br/>
<br/>
For the 15 month olds, try putting the food in little serving bowls (for<br/>
storage when you are done). Their communication skills might be good<br/>
enough (now or soon!) for them to indicate which bowl they want food<br/>
from. Put a piece or two from each bowl with names in front of them.<br/>
Ask them if they liked the cantaloupe when they are eating it. I¹m<br/>
sure you can tell which foods they like and which foods they are<br/>
grabbing first.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding that there is no need for me to intervene with my kids<br/>
diets - as long as I don¹t stop talking to them about healthy bodies<br/>
and why I choose to eat A instead of B. I might say if I felt they way<br/>
you do, I would feed my body protein (or whatever). Maybe it will<br/>
help to mentally shift back to the ³eat healthy over a week² mentality<br/>
that you might have had when your older kids were toddlers. You<br/>
know ­ average what they eat over a week to look for a balance in<br/>
food intake. I¹ll bet if you write everything that goes in the older<br/>
kids¹ mouths in a day or a week, it will be not so scary looking to<br/>
you. I also assume that you have plenty of different kinds of foods<br/>
in your home (and that you offer the kids) for them to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

gotten used to giving her a miniscule bit of anything (like four <br/>
pieces of popcorn and a grape) and several helpings if she wants <br/>
more. Little bitty plates help a lot! Really, with a small plate its <br/>
easier to create itty bitty portions. You just naturally adjust for <br/>
the size of the &quot;container&quot; as it were.  More than that, tiny plates <br/>
and bowls mean that when she gets herself something she <br/>
automatically creates smaller portions. So even if she&#39;s in the &quot;one <br/>
bite and I&#39;m full&quot; stage, there&#39;s less to throw away. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you know what a &quot;monkey platter&quot; is? Its kind of a variation on <br/>
the tiny portion idea - you offer small portions of several <br/>
different things all at once. With Mo, I&#39;ll sometimes bring her a <br/>
plate with half a dozen things on it, but tiny portions. If I&#39;m <br/>
making something for both kids and me besides I&#39;ll do something more <br/>
like a little buffet on a tray - a whole bunch of finger foods that <br/>
anyone can grab. I try not to have any expectations as to what the <br/>
kids are going to eat - just toss out a variety of options and <br/>
refill what gets eaten fastest.<br/>
<br/>
We do have supper most evenings, but generally its me and George and <br/>
Ray, since Mo tends to eat on a different schedule than the rest of <br/>
us and is still pretty conservative as to what she&#39;ll eat.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wondering if there&#39;s ever a point to where you intervene with a<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s diet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps to look at what kids eat over a period of a week to a <br/>
month, rather than in a single day. They really *do* cover all the <br/>
nutritional bases, they just don&#39;t do it the way you might expect. <br/>
The other thing to keep in mind is that its normal for appetites to <br/>
go up and down in relation to growth spurts - and when appetite is <br/>
low is often when you&#39;ll see the least overall &quot;nutritional density&quot; <br/>
in their food choices. That&#39;s when parents tend to panic and start <br/>
wanting to &quot;intervene&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;my kids have all refused the bottle and never liked milk<br/>
&gt; after weaned, and don&#39;t particularly like broccoli or spinach,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its also helpful to take a good look at your kids and see: are they <br/>
energetic? happy? do their eyes sparkle? hair shine? skin resilient? <br/>
Try to focus on the whole, rather than getting bogged down in the <br/>
details of what they (don&#39;t) eat as an indicator of health.<br/>
<br/>
Milk, broccoli and spinach are all tough to digest. And there are <br/>
other sources for the nutrients that don&#39;t have the same strong <br/>
flavors that can be overwhelming to some children. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What<br/>
&gt; if they have special needs<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids want to be healthy and feel good. Its possible to work in <br/>
partnership with children to help them understand *which* foods help <br/>
them feel good on a regular and longer term basis. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266229075">I know food issues. From my POV:<br/>
<br/>
Definitely go with making less (because more can always be made)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel like because YOU won&#39;t find it appealing, that the kids  <br/>
won&#39;t. There are some things my kids would rather sit out for a while  <br/>
(Rachel loves grated cheddar cheese that&#39;s been sitting out, after it  <br/>
gets all greasy. I don&#39;t know why, she doesn&#39;t either, but it&#39;s never  <br/>
poisoned her) Try saving it in the fridge in a ziplock box and let  <br/>
them pick it later.<br/>
<br/>
For snacks we usually make the monkey platter that Nicole (?)  <br/>
mentioned, and most of our meals are buffet style. Kind of put it  <br/>
together, pick your own foods. Couple of veggies, rice or pasta  <br/>
plain, and meat plain that they can sauce up they way they want.<br/>
<br/>
Our babies have always gone straight to table foods. I might steam  <br/>
their veggies a little longer so that they are softer, and their meat  <br/>
is cut very finely, but none of mine would eat special foods. They  <br/>
want what everyone else is eating.<br/>
<br/>
None of my children have enjoyed cow&#39;s milk, and I&#39;ve never pushed  <br/>
it, as I&#39;m lactose intolerant and grew up being forced to drink a  <br/>
glass of milk every night before bed (and being sick all night and  <br/>
the next morning) &quot;But it&#39;s good for you!&quot; There are many other ways  <br/>
to get calcium, beans, greens, yogurt and cheese, and high amounts of  <br/>
calcium can cause kidney stones. Potassium is just as important for  <br/>
absorption, and eating less calcium with a potassium source is a  <br/>
better way to absorb and build bones. Same for just about everything  <br/>
else. If you read how lobbyists work within the FDA, you wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
trust a single one of those recommendations. I like the idea of  <br/>
looking at your kids. Look at their energy, their skin, their hair,  <br/>
their overall happiness.<br/>
<br/>
As for special needs, we have a few. I&#39;m the evil mom who let her  <br/>
celiac son eat wheat. I know it&#39;s not ideal for him, eating wheat  <br/>
raises their chance of cancer by 10%. And he was young, three or  <br/>
four. However, he had to know that it makes him sick, no matter if  <br/>
other&#39;s in our celiac group supported me or not. And now he&#39;s five  <br/>
years old, and he will not choose to eat wheat. He&#39;s the only kid in  <br/>
our support group that can, at this age, go in and order his own food  <br/>
in a restaurant, verifying everything with waitresses. He doesn&#39;t  <br/>
WANT to feel sick, and he knows that he makes the choices, they  <br/>
aren&#39;t made for him. I&#39;ll help and point stuff out, but I never say  <br/>
no. I have a daughter allergic to corn, and another to milk. So these  <br/>
are all things we&#39;ve had to work through.<br/>
<br/>
HTH, feel free to ask any questions. I&#39;m swiped today after a full  <br/>
day out with kids. Big shopping day (speaking of food!)<br/>

She eats what she wants and is hungry in an hour.  She eats about 5 times a<br/>
