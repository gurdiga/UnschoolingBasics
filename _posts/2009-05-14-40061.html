<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088885518">Hi everyone - <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say thank you for all of your posts.  Reading them gives me such encouragement and support.  I am also grateful for everyone who answers my specific questions with such thoughtful responses.  Mmmmmmm!!<br/>
<br/>
Last night I heard my kids talking things out and finding solutions together to what ever problems were coming up.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I helped my husband deal with a work issue for nearly an hour while my kids played together and ate together.  A couple of times they came in to check on us, and then they went back to playing and eating.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I enjoyed the pleasure of having both of my kids in the house at the same time!<br/>
<br/>
And, I can tell you that this has not always been the case.  <br/>
<br/>
And, I can tell you that switching to un-schooling has paved the way for this sibling healing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Elli</div>
