<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231952039">I am looking for literature that could be used in court, that would indicate that what a child <br/>
might learn in a traditional school (regardless of how superior mainstream society might <br/>
think that is is) is by far less important than having access to both parents.  Can anyone help?  <br/>
