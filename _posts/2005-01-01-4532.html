<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861109179">&quot;It seems<br/>
to me that unschoolers in general get very upset when people question<br/>
them-or maybe I am just taking it the wrong way&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re just not seeing it from the other side (well...that&#39;s <br/>
understandable).<br/>
If you&#39;re saying that unschoolers get &quot;no help&quot; that&#39;s a bit <br/>
disrespectful to all the wonderful parents here that spend day after <br/>
day making sure their kids have access to the whole, wide world!!<br/>
I know it isn&#39;t meant as a put-down, but things that newbies ask can <br/>
sure come across that way sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
If you think unschooling leads to poor jobs, or lack of math skills <br/>
or an inability to get a GED etc....then you&#39;re basically saying <br/>
that the lot of us unschooling parents don&#39;t care about that stuff! <br/>
Of course we care about our children having wonderful lives, that&#39;s <br/>
exactly WHY we unschool.<br/>
Maybe when you word things, just ask HOW it works, rather than <br/>
assuming all these negatives about unschooling like we haven&#39;t <br/>
thought all that through.<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>
Asking &quot;HOW do kids learn math without lessons and structure?&quot; is <br/>
better in my opinion than saying &quot;I have horrible math skills so how <br/>
will an unschooled child learn math?&quot; (duh, you went to school!!:) <br/>
wink, wink.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129232932">&quot;I see how kids can learn everything they need just through living-<br/>
but<br/>
math is the only thing that really has me &quot;worried&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well fortunately, you aren&#39;t his teacher!! If my kids only learned <br/>
what *I* knew, we&#39;d have pretty boring lives. Luckily, I am simply <br/>
the doorway through which they access the world, so I try to stay <br/>
wide open (saying yes a lot, being interested in their interests, <br/>
finding creative ways to get them items and information they want <br/>
etc..).<br/>
If *I* was their teacher, then my oldest would certainly NOT know <br/>
all about computers and video games and guitar and Dungeons and <br/>
Dragons and history of wars and medieval weaponry and so on....<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness we are all individuals that each have our own <br/>
interests that enrich the rest of our family.<br/>
Does your dh need you to teach him everything you know? Do your <br/>
friends? Of course not. Your children don&#39;t either. So you have a <br/>
deficit in math. What caused that?<br/>
Was it pure genetics? Or perhaps some really crappy school <br/>
experiences that made you believe you had to be taught math? That <br/>
you couldn&#39;t possibly understand all that material without great <br/>
struggle?<br/>
I venture to guess that most of us blocked up by math were schooled.<br/>
<br/>
So school didn&#39;t work very well to teach you math. And now you think <br/>
that school methods will somehow help your children learn something <br/>
you struggle with? How does that work?<br/>
If schoolish methods work, then they work? If they don&#39;t work, then <br/>
why are you trying to bring them home?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ve asked you a lot of questions....I&#39;ll back off now.:)<br/>
How about read an article for me, about how children learn when <br/>
they&#39;re interested. It&#39;s a schoolish method used, but ONLY on <br/>
children that WANTED the lessons.<br/>
So far, my children use numbers happily and readily, because it&#39;s <br/>
just another part of their lives. If they want to attach formal <br/>
words and equations to the stuff they&#39;re already familiar with, <br/>
think of the advantage they&#39;ll have over schooled kids that have <br/>
been taught all their lives that it&#39;s DIFFICULT to learn.<br/>

And if it makes you feel better, read about Laurie Chancey, who did <br/>
not memorize her multiplication tables, never had a math lesson in <br/>
her radical unschooled life, and did (and is doing) fabulous in <br/>
college:<br/>

<br/>
My goal is not to turn out academically &quot;educated&quot; individuals. My <br/>
goal is to help my children live the life of their choosing as <br/>
happily as possible, which I believe will lead to a wonderful life <br/>
journey.<br/>
