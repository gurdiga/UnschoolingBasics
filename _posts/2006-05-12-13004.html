<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814099394">&quot;You are going to CREATE malice and bullying and all kinds of other  <br/>
negative character in her, if you persist in thinking of her that  <br/>
way. You&#39;re totally wrong&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with Pam.<br/>
Human beings are born altruistic...I believe that. I think we filter<br/>
children&#39;s behavior through the adult lense and it looks totally<br/>
different. A 2.5 y.o. does NOT have a whole bunch of ability for<br/>
empathy just yet. She will in her own time.<br/>
She wanted that baby OUT of her house and throwing the bottle was her<br/>
only form of communication!! When I read that I&#39;m thinking<br/>
&quot;malice????? NO, she just wants those people to LEAVE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sweet and perfect and whole and wonderful, exactly how she is<br/>
today. When she starts hitting, love the heck out of her, move her<br/>
away from the target and tell her how much you adore her and you can&#39;t<br/>
let her hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Your dh has been coercive with her, I&#39;d hit him too!! Have him try<br/>
treating YOU the way he&#39;s been treating her and see if you don&#39;t feel<br/>
like smacking the guy.:)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very little. She doesn&#39;t have many tools just yet. LISTEN to her<br/>
and back off of playdates for a while....she&#39;s not going to do this<br/>
forever. Honest. <br/>
