&quot;Unitarian Universalists value the teachings of: <br/>
* Origen (circa 185 CE) who stressed Jesus&#39; HUMANITY, and believed <br/>
that God would receive ALL PEOPLE into heaven.<br/>
* Jan Huss, a Bohemian church reformer and martyr, burned at the <br/>
stake in 1415 CE.<br/>
* Michael Servetus who wrote &quot;On The Errors of the Trinity&quot; which <br/>
led to his execution at the stake in 1553 in John Calvin&#39;s Geneva <br/>
for his unitarian heresy. <br/>
* King John Sigismund of Transylvania (now a part of Romania and <br/>
Hungary) in 1568 issued the first edict of religious freedom. This <br/>
allowed citizens to hold DIVERSE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS and still be <br/>
loyal to the state. <br/>
* Writers, scientists, and others who promoted RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE, <br/>
including Alcott, Bryant, Holmes, Locke, Milton, Newton, Florence <br/>
Nightingale, and Emerson. <br/>
* American politicians such as John Adams, John Quincy Adams, <br/>
Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Adlai Stevenson <br/>
and William Howard Taft. <br/>
* Hosea Ballou, author (in 1805) of &quot;A Treatise on Atonement&quot; which <br/>
argued against the existence of miracles, the Trinity and of Hell. <br/>
He is sometimes referred to as &#39;The Father of American <br/>
Universalism&#39;.&quot; <br/>
