<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529692593">As you may know, my husband is &quot;doubting unschooling,&quot; so to speak, <br/>
and I&#39;ve been trying to enlighten him.<br/>
<br/>
Two of his latest comments have been:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think you *think* you&#39;re doing what these other unschoolers are <br/>
doing, but you&#39;re really not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, it depends on the family. Sure, if the parent is a college <br/>
professor, their kid is going to learn a lot and do well. And if the <br/>
parent has her own business grooming dogs or whatever, then she&#39;s <br/>
obviously got drive and an entreprenuerial capability, so I&#39;m not <br/>
surprised that her son is doing so well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words ... it sounds like he&#39;s saying, &quot;Unschooling can be <br/>
good, and these families are obviously successful, but you&#39;re not <br/>
doing it right, and I don&#39;t think you have what it takes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might be fair to mention that I do, in fact, have a chronic <br/>
illness.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, any comments about that sort of thinking? Also, is there a <br/>
list anywhere (or would you care to write one?) about what kinds of <br/>
traits a parents &quot;needs&quot; to be successful at unschooling? I&#39;m sure <br/>
there are necessary traits, but I tend to doubt that &quot;be a college <br/>
professor&quot; is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669215713">Jenny, is he willing to read? John Holt, or The Parenting Pit? I mention  <br/>
those 2 because they are men, and sometimes men respond better to other males. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is happening. I&#39;ve met with criticism from DH, but he&#39;s  <br/>
putting all his eggies in one basket with me now :) It took TIME and is still  <br/>
taking that time, for that matter. But it&#39;s happening. Results, seeing the kids  <br/>
feel good and expand, are helping the most, too. Plus, I have his culture  <br/>
involved, which basically allows for the woman to be the Supreme Ruler of All  <br/>
That Is Child ;) So, yes, I USE that one :) <br/>
 <br/>
Hang in there, Jenny! I&#39;ll get  better. Hope you&#39;re feeling  well.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
And his solution is to do what? Cut you down until you stop? Before <br/>
getting it right?<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s his attitude, then *HE* doesn&#39;t have what it takes to <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could back off long enough to let you have a go at it.<br/>
<br/>
Being either a college professor or an entrepreneur doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
because we *stop* pursuing our goals. Both require a certain amount of <br/>
glue. A LOT of glue.<br/>
<br/>
Tenacity can be fragile. Cutting down another&#39;s dream has got to be one <br/>
of the TOP things that can stop unschooling from succeeding.<br/>

<br/>
And after showering, I&#39;d like to add one more:<br/>
<br/>
Spousal Support.<br/>
<br/>
If the spouse cannot be supportive, at the absolute *minimum*, he <br/>
should agree to not be *sabotaging* the whole process!<br/>
<br/>
Children (adults too!) *need* to know that they are supported in their <br/>
choices. Having that modeled for them---parent on parent---is HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a family which was supportive of each other&#39;s interests. <br/>
Had I grown up in a family which belittled each other&#39;s interests, I <br/>
might not have taken on so many businesses or entrepreneurial <br/>
opportunities. I might have been afraid to try new things. Or ashamed <br/>
to think new thoughts. Too scared to go out on a limb. I&#39;m grateful to <br/>
have had a dad who was willing to pick me up when I failed---and then <br/>
support me *again* with the next &quot;great new idea.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents have soooo much input here! When a child wants to try something <br/>
new or different, he needs to be/feel supported. Otherwise, how will he <br/>
get his feet up under himself?<br/>
<br/>
ANy time we try something really, really new, it&#39;s like crawling around <br/>
on our hands and knees in the dark. Sometimes, our eyes adjust to the <br/>
dark. Sometimes we slowly rise up on two unsteady legs, toe-tapping <br/>
with our arms out in front of us before we take a real step.<br/>
<br/>
If we have someone who loves us nearby with a flashlight or a Bic <br/>
lighter---or---GraciousDay---a LIGHT SWITCH!, we can move forward <br/>
faster and faster. If we have someone to hold our hands, whose eyes are <br/>
already adjusted, who can be our guide, we can take bigger and bigger <br/>
steps.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we have someone *behind* us encouraging us on is better than <br/>
someone behind us making us afraid or telling us we&#39;re too incompetent <br/>
to even bother.<br/>
<br/>
If we have someone we love telling us &quot;It&#39;s too dark.&quot; and &quot;There may <br/>
be a cliff ahead!&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s too scary!&quot;---we may feel that it&#39;s best <br/>
to just stay put, sitting in one place. In the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Having some we love tell us, &quot;You can DO it!&quot; &quot;I believe in you!&quot; &quot;How <br/>
can *I* help you?&quot; &quot;Where do we start?&quot; and &quot;Let&#39;s DO it!&quot; ---THAT can <br/>
shine a light and give us wings.<br/>
<br/>
THis is true for children AND spouses---well, and anybody we love!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827946077">No, there are no &quot;necessary traits&quot;. Sounds to me like he has a certain definition of &quot;right way&quot; and &quot;successful&quot; perhaps different than your&#39;s. He simply needs to be convinced his opinion is not the only one that counts....<br/>
  So if you are asking how to convince him of that. Sounds like he simply needs to be convinced to trust your opinion more or as much as his own. Why does he not?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117222072">Sending big raspberries to your husband, and big hugs to you.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I had to learn in unschooling is that I couldn&#39;t  <br/>
possibly do it the way everyone else was doing it. Our family is  <br/>
different from every other family on the planet, and thus our needs  <br/>
and desires are different.<br/>
<br/>
The second item is addressed by my favorite quote &quot;I have never let  <br/>
my schooling get in the way of my education&quot;, Twain. Sure, having a  <br/>
college degree, and even experience teaching in a university setting  <br/>
is cool. But is by no means the penultimate in being educated, and it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect wisdom. My MIL was an eighth grade  <br/>
graduate, but one of the most intelligent, knowledge-filled people I  <br/>
know. Mostly this was because she had a great passion for knowledge,  <br/>
and the support of her family in choosing a life that suited her.<br/>
<br/>
Chronic illnesses don&#39;t change my opinion on whether or not  <br/>
unschooling is effective, I think. If we believe that we learn  <br/>
through living, then living a quality life, regardless of physical  <br/>
limitations, is important. We actually came to unschooling when I was  <br/>
on bedrest for premature labor. Up until then, we had followed a  <br/>
school-at-home program. Lo and behold, they were learning MORE  <br/>
without me interrupting them lol!<br/>
<br/>
I like Kelly&#39;s list of traits. She&#39;s much better spoken than I am,  <br/>
but I wanted to share my short points.<br/>

<br/>
Your list is alot like mine when we started unschooling...and when I  <br/>
realized that unschooling was just as important for ME as it was the  <br/>
kids. Maybe more so, because they take it for GRANTED....that they  <br/>
deserve good parents and freedom and choices. Me, i&#39;m slowly pounding  <br/>
it into my thick skull.<br/>
<br/>
I had a c-section with my first....followed by six vbacs. It can be  <br/>
done!!! Legislation has made it more difficult, requires  <br/>
intervention, which in turn increases your chances of csection.<br/>
Good luck....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226721496">I have Systemic Lupus, Fibromyalgia and Sjogren&#39;s syndrome (for<br/>
now...autoimmune disorders tend to collect over the years) and I find<br/>
unschooling EASIER on me physically than school was.  Your husband<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand I&#39;m guessing.  For me when I don&#39;t feel well, the<br/>
boys know I need some time to just rest so we do quiet things<br/>
together.  When I&#39;m having good days we do more rowdy stuff and things<br/>
that require energy.  And this is SOOO much easier than it was when I<br/>
had them in school.  Not to mention that school exposes the kids to<br/>
more germs which meant I was sick more. Now I don&#39;t totally &quot;get&quot;<br/>
unschooling yet.  But I think the energy I&#39;m using is the same or<br/>
perhaps more than I would use if I were doing it as some of these<br/>
ladies do so it can only get better.<br/>

I can honestly say that of all the things I&#39;ve done to try and &quot;heal&quot;<br/>

&gt; Your list is alot like mine when we started unschooling...and when I  <br/>
&gt; realized that unschooling was just as important for ME as it was the  <br/>
&gt; kids. Maybe more so, because they take it for GRANTED....that they  <br/>

&gt; I had a c-section with my first....followed by six vbacs. It can be  <br/>

I won&#39;t even ask how you did it.  I don&#39;t cry easily.  I AM pregnant<br/>
but even then...  something about your words made me BURST into<br/>
tears!!!  Thanks for the mascara stains. :-P<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
LOL! Glad to help!<br/>
<br/>
See what I&#39;ve done already?! &lt;BWG&gt;  (yikes!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OK - what do I want to do?<br/>
<br/>
1. Be the parent I wished I had my entire life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just stay the course. That&#39;s a long-term goal and lasts the span of <br/>
your life and your children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
You can be better every single day.<br/>
<br/>
And what a gift to your kids!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2. Stop wishing I had the parent I always wanted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---a big part of that is healing the child in you by being the <br/>
parent you wished you&#39;d had.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe consider that the reason you are working so hard now to be the <br/>
BEST parent you can be is *because* of the creepy parents you had!<br/>
<br/>
They made you a better parent by being crappy ones. Look for the GOOD <br/>
in what&#39;s happened---&#39;cause you can&#39;t *change* it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
3. Go through this life slowly eradicating the guilt I feel every day,<br/>
without projecting it onto my children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of feeling &quot;guilty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guilty&quot; is what a man says when his luck has run out in court. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What have you done to feel guilty about anyway? (No need to answer <br/>
here! Just ask yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to slowly eradicate a guilty feeling. Just stop. Now. <br/>
Who needs guilt???<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
4. Have this baby naturally. (I&#39;ve had two c-sections)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Weeeelll---I can&#39;t help you there! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But good luck with that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
5. Get into politics little by little.  Down with homeschool <br/>
regulations!!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into serving on the local school board?<br/>
<br/>
Or even showing up at the statehouse when they are discussing <br/>
homeschool legislation? Or volunteering for a local legislator?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
6. I want to paint! and now that I wrote that, and I&#39;m going to Home<br/>
Depot anyway, I&#39;m thinking about a gallon of bright sunny yellow for<br/>
the background of a mural I&#39;ve been planning!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can ya&#39; beat YELLOW? I have a yellow HOUSE! &lt;g&gt; Grey shutters and white <br/>
trim and dark green highlights (doors, risers, etc.) Bright and cheery!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---my room and Duncan&#39;s room are both yellow too---I forgot! Just <br/>
very different yellows. My room&#39;s mellower than Dunc&#39;s. His is bright <br/>
golden yellow. With deep red and black---and dragons!<br/>
<br/>
What kind of mural? Send us photos! Ren&#39;s a mural queen!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Whatchya think hunny?!? (he reads here a lot.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Cool!<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t think we&#39;re *too* crazy, does he? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that too much to ask???<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ya&#39; know---what&#39;s the worst that can happen if you ask?<br/>
<br/>
Someone says &quot;no&quot;??? So....find someone else to ask. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, you haven&#39;t even BEGUN to start doing!<br/>
<br/>
I bet there&#39;s *much* longer list just waiting to be begun!<br/>

Diana GETS this!<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago when Hannah was first admitted to the hospital, I called <br/>
and asks Diana what she needed. Usually people say, &quot;AW, thanks. I&#39;m <br/>
just fine. Thanks for asking, but I&#39;m fine. Really.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Diana said, through tears: &quot;I can&#39;t find my Birkenstocks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Humph---*I* can DO that! What size?<br/>
<br/>
I went right out that night and bought and sent her a scrumptious pair <br/>
of shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what became of the missing pair of shoes; but because she <br/>
asked, I could DO something. Something simple, but it was important at <br/>
the time. To Diana.<br/>
<br/>
And it allowed me to help *her*.<br/>
<br/>
What many people fail to understand is that others *want* to help. If <br/>
someone cares for you (and sometimes if he doesn&#39;t even *know* you! <br/>
Check out freecycle!), he doesn&#39;t want you to fail or be lost or be <br/>
needy. People *will* help. Sometimes you *do* have to ask though!<br/>
<br/>
Always ask. They can only say no. You have nothing to lose!<br/>

After my first bout of grieving, more people than you can count said<br/>
&quot;Anything I can do, just call!&quot;  Most folk, deep down inside, would prefer I<br/>
didn&#39;t call at all -- especially when I would call with &quot;Can you come over<br/>
and do some laundry so I can be with my kids?&quot; or answer that question with<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d sure like someone to come over and vacuum or the bathroom really needs<br/>
tending&quot; A very small handful took themselves at their word and did come<br/>
over and give the exact kind of help I needed -- the vast majority though<br/>
realized how empty their offers were and most of them were what I would have<br/>
considered &quot;good friends&quot;<br/>

changing and repealing the ridiculous statutes that we have!  I swear<br/>

I&#39;ve definitely been feeling moody and a little down lately.  Well,<br/>
that and its not spring yet.  WTF?  :-)<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; I bet there&#39;s *much* longer list just waiting to be begun!<br/>
<br/>
oh the list is long!  very very long.  I just went with some of the<br/>
things on the top of the list.  Now that you mention it, I make make<br/>
my own list and keep it for personal use though.  Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s scared. He loves his kids and he wants what&#39;s best for them but  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know how to go about getting it. And the way he&#39;s chosen  <br/>

<br/>
Sympathize. Let him know you understand he&#39;s scared because he loves  <br/>
his kids. (Compassion and understanding are great helps for worries.)  <br/>
But you love them just as much and that&#39;s why you&#39;re doing so much  <br/>
reading so you can get it right.<br/>
<br/>
Turn the situation around. What if he&#39;d gotten involved in some  <br/>
philosophy that felt cultish to you and drew your children into it?  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking you&#39;d be scared too. I suspect it would feel more  <br/>
comforting to cling to your own philosophy than to find out more  <br/>
about his. Sort of like a sane life line to help you pull your kids  <br/>
back from something that could damage them.<br/>
<br/>
Emphasize (in a compassionate way) that you love your kids and won&#39;t  <br/>
hurt them for the world. Share what you&#39;re finding out about  <br/>
unschooling. (Information is a great cure for fears.)<br/>
<br/>
How would you handle it if one of your kids was rude to you because  <br/>
they were scared and felt powerless and didn&#39;t know how to fix the  <br/>
situation?<br/>

LOL I just *had to* bake last night (I made a batch of Fudge Ecstasy<br/>
cookies - DS and DH LOVE them to pieces). I was grumbly because when I<br/>
got home, DH hadn&#39;t touched the two+ days of dishes in the sink and in<br/>
looking for something tucked away, had left stacks of stuff from one<br/>
cupboard all over the place (I got hit in the head with something that<br/>
fell off the top of the fridge when I opened the freezer!) So I baked<br/>
and did dishes (actually I find washing dishes with a nice orange oil<br/>
scented soap and maybe a nice votive candle on the window ledge above<br/>
the sink quite therapeutic) and by the time DH got home (he took his mom<br/>
to the hospital to visit FIL who has been in there since Dec 2) I was<br/>
relaxed and calm and ready to be there for him (visits to his dad always<br/>
get him tense).<br/>
<br/>
The last two weekends, DH accused me of nesting because I was rooting<br/>
through closets and even the basement storage areas and such - I was<br/>
looking for stuff to give to a fund raiser tag sale at church. I AM not<br/>
nesting guys. At least, not for myself. I told DH that since his sister<br/>
was on bedrest for these last few weeks (really high blood pressure<br/>
going on) and couldn&#39;t nest for herself, I was nesting in surrogate LOL<br/>
