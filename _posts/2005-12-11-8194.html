<div id="ygrps-yiv-304412096">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I was raised pretty much the same way I am raising them, and I was<br/>
NEVER afraid of my parents.  I&#39;m not blind, I see my parents for who they<br/>
are, faults and all (which is why my children aren&#39;t being raised exactly<br/>
the same), but I love and respect them deeply. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yet this suggests that you are willing, even desirous, of embracing your<br/>
parents&#39; faults or parenting defects - repeating their mistakes along with<br/>
their positive ideas as if you have no other choice but to take all or<br/>
nothing.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read this ten times and kept reading &quot;*are* being raised exactly the<br/>
same&quot;..........<br/>
<br/>
!!!!Sorry!!!! about that to all, especially Yolanda if you ever come back -<br/>
the first two paragraphs of this post were based on a misread that totally<br/>
reversed the meaning. (But still quit spanking!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are still some useful ideas in there - or not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Also it is &quot;one size fits all&quot; parenting. Our children are not<br/>
ourselves. Our children are not clones of us or each other (even twins!).<br/>
They could have different needs than we may have had growing up and from<br/>
each other. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this paragraph stands on its own better, as well as the rest of the<br/>
post.<br/>
