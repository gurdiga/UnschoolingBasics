<div id="ygrps-yiv-511703179">&quot;She generally can&#39;t play with<br/>
other children without me being there. Socially she is a disaster,<br/>
which I&#39;ve been told is another trait of AS/SPD. When someone<br/>
wrongs her she hits or punches them. And it could be over something<br/>
as simple as they won&#39;t play the game she wants to play. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to empathize..I have a 5 y.o. that sounds a lot like<br/>
your child. He actually laughs sometimes when someone gets hurt at his<br/>
own hands. He DOES have empathy, but it doesn&#39;t show when he&#39;s in an<br/>
emotional moment. Getting physical with someone takes almost NO<br/>
provocation....if they aren&#39;t understanding him, or want to do<br/>
something different, he&#39;ll lash out easily.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Kelly that you have to be very present with these kids.<br/>
It&#39;s exhausting sometimes, but I truly believe they ARE developing the<br/>
traits to be socially balanced, it&#39;s just taking longer for them.<br/>
He&#39;s getting better, little by little. I also just started him on a<br/>
supplement with the healthy oils (someone else mentioned this) not<br/>
figuring it will change him one bit, but MIGHT help take the edge off<br/>
and make things more bearable.<br/>
<br/>
When he got angry or upset in the past, it took a good 1/2 hour to<br/>
re-focus and get back to a place where he could be reasoned with on<br/>
any level. He can now do it in just a few minutes sometimes. So I KNOW<br/>
we&#39;re helping him gain new tools (and he&#39;s developing in his own time)<br/>
but sometimes it seems like we say the same thing 20x to no avail. <br/>
<br/>
I understand that my words &quot;use gentle hands&quot; or &quot;use words&quot; are<br/>
probably falling on deaf ears, but I&#39;m right there with him and<br/>
eventaully I think it will click for him. In the mean time, I breathe<br/>
a LOT and focus on his beautiful eyes and sweet cheeks...which help me<br/>
reconnect with how wonderful this child IS. <br/>
