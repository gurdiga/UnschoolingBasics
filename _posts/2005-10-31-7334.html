You said &quot;I don&#39;t know what else to do&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
STAND UP FOR YOUR KIDS!!:)<br/>
<br/>
They need you right now, they need you to stay strong, to NOT go back<br/>
into pushing them. You will hurt their trust FAR too much to make it<br/>
worth appeasing your dh.<br/>
Your dh will come around. Give it time.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you get through it until then. REFUSE to do the damage to<br/>
them yourself. If HE wants to do a lesson, let him. But don&#39;t YOU be a<br/>
party to the damage.<br/>
Take some snappy photos of your activities, brag about some cool thing<br/>
they learned, talk positively about all the wonderful learning<br/>
happening in your home. Leave interesting books, materials, sciency<br/>
stuff all over your house, GO away from home and away from him to do<br/>
cool, fun and exciting actitivies and talk all about the learning that<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe deep, recognize that he is acting this way because he loves<br/>
his children, but also realize you DON&#39;T have to create harm to keep<br/>
this man happy. I&#39;ve been there, you can do it too.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220531211">Sandy, I have to ditto what Ren said!  I think the best thing you <br/>
can do is give your husband lots of reading material that deal with <br/>
unschooling, especially ones that have essays from unschooling <br/>
children that are now adults.  Subscribe to Live Free, Learn Free <br/>
and Life Learning.  Life Learning (the last issue) had an excellent <br/>
article about college, success, and money and how they are not <br/>
connected!  It is a good one for those that worry about their <br/>
childrens &quot;success&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband was never absolutely against unschooling, as far as the <br/>
school part goes but we had some hurdles to cross over to radical <br/>
unschooling.  And he did have some issues with being a little <br/>
schooly but it didn&#39;t take him long to examine his thinking.  He is <br/>
VERY pro-radical unschooling now!  He has his issues, as we all do, <br/>
to do better, but he really loves the way we live.  He thanked me <br/>
PROFUSELY before the conference for showing him this way of life!  <br/>
<br/>
Bring your husband to next years conference too!!  That can do a lot <br/>
to change a persons thinking!!  It is so uplifting to be around all <br/>
these wonderful, unique people.  I loved it when Ren and I were <br/>
eating lunch one day and 3 or 4 teenage girls joined us just to <br/>
chat!!  I mean, how many teenagers do you know that like to be <br/>
around adults?  It is because they can trust us!!  My husband was <br/>
just in awe of all the wonderful people that we met and he is so <br/>
excited for next years conference.<br/>
<br/>
Like Ren said, when he insists that you do lessons (if that is the <br/>
case), let him know that he is more than welcome to do &quot;lessons&quot; <br/>
with them.  More than likely it will end that discussion.  Tell him <br/>
about all the wonderful things you do, even if it is just a cool TV <br/>
show that you watched.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000378878">ren, thanks so much for these pithy words.  i need to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
i *know* dh is an unschooler in my heart of hearts.  he&#39;s been hurt in <br/>
many ways--school, parents, siblings, trust is hard for him.  he wants <br/>
to and seems many times to be almost there, yet can&#39;t let down his<br/>
guard <br/>
with me as his wife or his son&#39;s mother.  i often feel the foundation <br/>
rock.  i guess it&#39;s the paradigm shifting--scary, full of hope, even <br/>
exciting when i can view it that way.<br/>
<br/>
we had another breakthru this weekend.  instead of dh making the money <br/>
decisions, i changed my mind about the importance of being part of the <br/>
financial picture, not only for ds&#39; sake but also for all our ability<br/>
to <br/>
interrelate and have a say about family resources: first money; <br/>
eventually other resources like time for individuals and time together;<br/>
<br/>
among other resources.<br/>
<br/>
anyway- but yeah... what you said!<br/>
