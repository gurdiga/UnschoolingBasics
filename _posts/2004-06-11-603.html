<div id="ygrps-yiv-130418857">I have the opposite here...my dd (5yo) CONSTANTLY ask &quot;where are we <br/>
going, what are we doing, who is coming over?&quot;  She lives to go <br/>
somewhere, to have something planned.  I think it is because she is <br/>
an extravert, but I have wondered if it is because I am doing <br/>
something wrong at home or not providing an interesting enough <br/>
atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand am more introverted.  Most of the time I am fine <br/>
with being at home with no plans.  I occasionly get restless, but <br/>
usually a phone call to a friend helps.<br/>
<br/>
This sometimes poses a challenge for us.  If older dd remains <br/>
persistant, I will take the girls to the park or to playland just so <br/>
we can leave for awhile and make her happy...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164295405">I can relate to that one too.  There are some days when my oldest, who 99% of <br/>
the time doesn&#39;t want to do anything, decides its time to go somewhere!  Most <br/>
of the time its when I DON&#39;T want to go to town!  Let alone deal with <br/>
Gamestop and exchanging games.  So I remind myself he is learning to deal with the <br/>
real world at this place and make decisions.    Everything here is a 30 min <br/>
drive to get to.  I try to make myself go, especially since they don&#39;t ask much of <br/>
me (well, most days anyway!).  <br/>

&quot;while raising my children, I lost my mind but found my soul.&quot;                <br/>
