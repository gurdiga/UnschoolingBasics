<div id="ygrps-yiv-29685841">Actually, it is margarine (with no trans fat).... <br/>
<br/>
We are new to RU. We are working hard to give the boys (6 & 7) food <br/>
autonomy. When they ask for something that seems unusual to me, I <br/>
question my own hesitation and usually my concerns are groundless - <br/>
old recordings in my head. I&#39;ve gotten past cake for breakfast, <br/>
limitless candy and popsicles, and even drinking the salad dressing <br/>
that comes in the little cups at the restaurant. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, one of the boys said he was hungry. I asked what he wanted <br/>
to eat. He said butter. I said I wasn&#39;t comfortable with him just <br/>
eating butter so he asked for a hotdog bun with butter. Later I asked <br/>
myself &quot;What difference does it make whether he eats the butter on <br/>
bread or by itself?&quot; And I can&#39;t think of a reason why he ought not <br/>
eat butter (margarine) by the spoonful, or salad dressing, which was <br/>
requested in close proximity to the butter. Actually, I can see how <br/>
he might want to taste the condiment without the flavor distraction <br/>
of another food.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d like to know whether anyone else has dealt with this, or a <br/>
similar food (condiment) issue, and how you handled it. I have <br/>
visions of handing him a spoonful of margarine, or a pat of butter, <br/>
or a bowl of salad dressing. But an old recording inside of me makes <br/>
me hesitate. It says, what if he eats it and wants another, and <br/>
another, and another. Is it OK to let them eat butter or drink salad <br/>
dressing until they have had their fill? Or would I somehow be <br/>
negligent to support this desire. Please help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Lisa</div>

   <br/>
  Why would it not be OK?<br/>
   <br/>
  I actually prefer real butter to margarine. Both my kids loved to eat butter. They would just grab a stick, open and take a few bites. <br/>
Its food. <br/>
It will not hurt them. There is nothing that says you can only eat butter with bread.<br/>
  If it tastes good to them...hey!<br/>
  It is a child&#39;s job to taste and try new foods and textures.<br/>
  Let it go&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382685874">Funny, right before I read this reply I was thinking that it sounded<br/>
like they were craving fats for some reason.  <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get my children to try salad dressing if it was going to<br/>
save their lives!  They aren&#39;t big on butter either.  Really, I don&#39;t<br/>
see a problem with it.  I might offer up some ideas on what salad<br/>
dressing or butter could be combined with, but not for any other<br/>
reason than it could and they might like it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813922607">lol- my 3 kids have done this nad they are 14-5 and 3<br/>

what difference does it make if it is plain butter on a spoon or <br/>
butter on the toast- or a spoonful of sugar or a cookie with sugar- <br/>
or chocolate syrup- or just the frosting off the cake<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379625590">Butter is fabulous!  We actually have preferred brands for &quot;snackin&#39;<br/>
butter.&quot;  Salted is naturally much tastier than unsalted.  Goat butter<br/>
is hard to find but really yummy.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Plus, if it comes from grassfed cows, it&#39;s a fabulous source of<br/>
vitamins A & D.  I know the actual nutritive value isn&#39;t what&#39;s up for<br/>
debate here, but... after much reading on the topic I vehemently<br/>
believe that saturated fats from natural sources are GOOD for us.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, this lurker says Let Them Eat Butter!  They might have a<br/>
growth spurt coming up and need the extra nutrients.  I used to eat<br/>
huge quantities of straight salt.  No idea why.  Blech.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328834801">My youngest boy, after having the experience of tapping maple trees <br/>
this spring and drinking the sap, has begun to drink maple syrup from <br/>
his own maple leaf shaped bottle. when I make him french toast or <br/>
pancakes, I only fill the bottle half way (1-2 0z at most) and he has a <br/>
field day with it.  This seems to satisfy his need. My second boy, <br/>
along with his younger brother, both will eat butter.  I sometimes find <br/>
them with literally butter fingers licking away.  why not.  if they eat <br/>
too much I am sure they will realise a tummy ache is the result.  I was <br/>
freaked out at first, but that is my preconception that butter HAS to <br/>
be on toast or whatever to be enjoyed! So I say LET THEM EAT BUTTER!</div>

  Mine had a period of time when they were requesting all the condiments!  We went through mayo (yuk to eat plain imo, but they loved it), ketchup, mustard, jam, butter, etc.  They had to be totally in charge, dishing it out into a bowl until it was &#39;loaded&#39;.  We went through a LOT of condiments!  But it was kind of fun too, and totally harmless.  My sister always liked eating butter, and as an adult she still loves to slice a bit of cold butter off the top.<br/>

  And you said it yourself, that it&#39;s an &#39;old recording&#39; that is making you question whether this is okay.  Just say yes!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284921727">Oh, that brings back memories. My then 2 y.o. loved to eat a whole stick of butter, just chewing it off the top. He never finished the whole stick in one sitting. My kids have also tried some pretty weird combinations of food without any harm. One thing I did notice is that when my 6 y.o. had something with MSG (like Doritos) in it (when we went somewhere) he got a big headache, and when I told him that I see a pattern there he said he does not need to have this anymore when we go out and we buy MSG-free alternatives.  I agree, just say yes, and have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835763090">I&#39;d think of it this way; what if your husband had an idea about what<br/>
&quot;healthy&quot; food vs. &quot;junk&quot; food was, and only allowed his version of<br/>
&quot;healthy&quot; food to be in the house.  In addition, he made it clear that any<br/>
food choices you might want outside of his ideas were &quot;junk&quot; and therefore<br/>
not OK.  How would you feel about that?  I&#39;d hate it!  It&#39;s not for my<br/>
husband - or anyone else! - to choose for me what to eat (or wear, or watch,<br/>
or read, or.).<br/>

Actually, it is margarine (with no trans fat)....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Way back when (maybe 20 years ago?), Ben was told at a military <br/>
physical that he needed to cut back on butter because his cholesterol <br/>
was high. He was a literal kind of guy. &lt;g&gt; So, as a good wife (but <br/>
against my better judgment), I started buying and using margarine <br/>
(ugh!). For 12 years!<br/>
<br/>
Then he got a job as a sales rep for a restaurant food distributor. At <br/>
a seminar (probably sponsored by the dairy industry! &lt;g&gt;), he was told <br/>
that margarine was one hydrogen atom away from plastic. Overnight we <br/>
were back to BUTTER! I did a happy dance! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d like to know whether anyone else has dealt with this, or a<br/>
similar food (condiment) issue, and how you handled it. I have<br/>
visions of handing him a spoonful of margarine, or a pat of butter,<br/>
or a bowl of salad dressing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Ben, my husband, is only one in our family with these desires. He&#39;ll <br/>
drink pickle vinegar, beet juice, and salad dressing---and eat butter <br/>
and sour cream by themselves. Gives me the willies. &lt;g&gt; Neither of our <br/>
sons has done that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But an old recording inside of me makes<br/>
me hesitate. It says, what if he eats it and wants another, and<br/>
another, and another. Is it OK to let them eat butter or drink salad<br/>
dressing until they have had their fill? Or would I somehow be<br/>
negligent to support this desire. Please help.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Ben would appreciate my keeping these things from him. I <br/>
asked him whether he&#39;d always done that. He said yes. I asked what his <br/>
mom said to it. He said he never did it in front of her---and he never <br/>
got caught! &lt;g&gt; He also added that he used to drink A-1 sauce from the <br/>
bottle, but now it&#39;s too expensive. But he *will* drink BBQ sauce, soy <br/>
sauce---basically any condiment. I&#39;ll have to start watching him at the <br/>
frig! For those regular visitors, he says he no longer drinks from the <br/>
milk carton. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jon Kream&#39;s gonna get a lot of mileage out of this one! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really wouldn&#39;t worry about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Do you believe that if you control their choices, they will never eat<br/>

I think the idea that we can choose for other people is an illusion at<br/>
best. Damaging at the worst. How old are your children?<br/>

 I have one that is grown and moved out so I have zero illusions about<br/>
control these days!:)<br/>
It&#39;s easy to think we can control these things when we have young<br/>
children, because it works pretty well for some people. But in our<br/>
society there are a LOT of food choices right now and I certainly<br/>
don&#39;t want anyone else deciding what is healthy for ME.<br/>

<br/>
No one is suggesting that unhealthy food is a requirement.  Allowing <br/>
children a CHOICE is what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
Mine generally choose foods that are good for them because they&#39;ve had <br/>
experience in how different foods make them feel. That includes <br/>
McDonald&#39;s and Oreos and Fruit Loops. They still will choose less <br/>
healthful foods, but less and less as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
We talk a LOT about foods and how they make us feel. I keep LOTS of <br/>
fruits and vegies in the house. Rarely do we buy cookies cause we all <br/>
like homemade better. We&#39;re more likely to bake a cake or pie though. <br/>
They&#39;re VERY willing to try new, strange things because we&#39;ve never <br/>
made them eat anything---just made the weird new stuff available.<br/>
<br/>
Cam&#39;s an on and off vegetarian and considers everything that goes in <br/>
his mouth----uh...unlike his A-1 drinking father! Dunc, at 12, is quite <br/>
adventurous; he has a sweet tooth but he often makes healthful <br/>
decisions---better than *I* do!<br/>
<br/>
We buy lots of good stuff. The house is always full of healthful food. <br/>
But I&#39;ll buy whatever they want. And they can choose whatever they <br/>
want. But the thing IS...THEY get to CHOOSE.<br/>

That&#39;s how we handle needs around here.<br/>

Our response to desire is to feed it. People can truly choose when<br/>
items aren&#39;t limited. Giving myself that permission as an adult has<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I think.  Vitamin A and vitamin D are <br/>
fat soluble vitamins found in butter.  Our cells get<br/>
energy from fats and from sugars. Eating fats will take<br/>
away sugar cravings.  Sweet foods (carbs) is like<br/>
kindling and fats are like logs on a fire.  It&#39;s far<br/>
healthier for the body to get its energy from good fats <br/>
than carbs.  Pathogens prefer carbs.<br/>
<br/>
The body digests oils, fats and proteins first and stores<br/>
carbs as fat for later use.  People who eat a high fat<br/>
diet will lose weight because the body uses the calories <br/>
right up.  Farmers did this with beef cattle.  They fed<br/>
coconut oil to cattle to fatten them up and they all lost<br/>
weight.  So much for the calorie theory of weight <br/>
management.<br/>
<br/>
A good high quality butter is definitely a health food.<br/>
High mountain Swiss make a special butter from spring grass<br/>
milk that is extra high in fat, vitamin A and D.  This butter <br/>
is considered a sacred food and saved for pregnant and <br/>
nursing women because it made the healthiest babies.<br/>
It contains vitamin K which widens the cheek bones <br/>
in the face and allows the teeth to come in normally without<br/>
needing orthodontics.<br/>
<br/>
A good quality, preferably grass fed, butter is a high<br/>
quality food and should be eaten liberally.<br/>
<br/>
The cholesterol myth is a triumph of advertising from the<br/>
grain industries.  Look at the French.  They eat pate, cream,<br/>
raw milk cheese, high fat meats, eggs and butter in the same<br/>
meal.<br/>
<br/>
Clogged arteries comes from inflammation which is caused by<br/>
white flour and sugar.  If you are worried about this, Harvard<br/>
Med School taught in the late 60&#39;s that Lugol&#39;s iodine<br/>
will dissolve wax....cholesterol is a wax.  Lugols is like<br/>
Drano for the arteries.  A few drops in water every day does<br/>
the trick.  <br/>
<br/>
Give your child popcorn with melted butter on top for a high<br/>
quality snack.  (If they want it, of course!) <br/>
<br/>
www.westonaprice.org  will have tons of science if you need <br/>
proof.<br/>
<br/>
Butter is definitely better.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s how we handle needs around here.<br/>

&gt; I bought a 36 pack from Sam&#39;s Club. Twice. That was the end of that.<br/>
&gt; He still laughs about how much he LOVED Twix and now he could care  <br/>
&gt; less.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our response to desire is to feed it. People can truly choose when<br/>
&gt; items aren&#39;t limited. Giving myself that permission as an adult has<br/>
&gt; led to a very balanced and healthy way of eating...for ME.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the idea that we can choose for other people is an illusion at<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we have this mistaken idea that we humans prefer what is bad  <br/>
to what is good. And the only reason adults are able to choose the  <br/>
good over the bad is because we were controlled long enough to get to  <br/>
an age where we could tell ourselves no and make the right choices.<br/>
<br/>
But it just isn&#39;t true. The children here who have had free range of  <br/>
food are proof. I think what makes it hard for people to accept is  <br/>
that kids don&#39;t limit themselves to nutritious food. They explore.  <br/>
They binge. They go through phases. But when we make nutritious food  <br/>
as easy as snacky food, when we don&#39;t hover and fuss, when we share  <br/>
our own ideas about choices (in an informational way without strings  <br/>
attached), when we look at the big picture free range kids choose  <br/>
nutritious food.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that prevents parents from grasping the idea that kids  <br/>
will choose nutritious food is that little kids, especially  <br/>
preadolescents, need a lot of calories. Snack foods and, a big  <br/>
favorite, McD&#39;s Chicken Nuggets!, are little bundles of calories.  <br/>
It&#39;s not because they&#39;re &quot;junk&quot; that kids like them. It&#39;s because  <br/>
kids can get a big whoop of calories with little time investment ;-)  <br/>
Rather than fighting it, we can recognize it and provide nutritious  <br/>
snacks that are full of the fat and calories kids need.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to create a craving for something is to either forbid it  <br/>
or make it scarce. So why would that technique work to prevent  <br/>
someone from wanting something?<br/>

&gt; That is an interesting way to think about it. It is not something I  <br/>

&gt; get behind personally.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not speculation, it&#39;s knowledge from personal experience. We  <br/>
don&#39;t *think* kids will grow up to make nutritious choices. We know  <br/>
they will because there are adult unschool children who we&#39;ve watched  <br/>
grow up who still make nutritious choices when on their own. There  <br/>
are parents here who were former controllers and switched to free  <br/>
range and they can see the difference in their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Control is the easiest technique for parents to apply. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
take special training. Don&#39;t you think that if control worked that  <br/>
parents would have figured that out long ago and we wouldn&#39;t need any  <br/>
other parenting technique? We&#39;d all just say no to everything we  <br/>
didn&#39;t want kids to do and they&#39;d grow up to say no to themselves and  <br/>
live their lives exactly as we trained them to do.<br/>
<br/>
As a universal technique control doesn&#39;t work, unless your goal is to  <br/>
teach your kids to sneak and beg. When we place ourselves as a road  <br/>
block between our kids and what they want, what options do we give  <br/>
them? Sneak around us. Bully past us. Give up.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to give up when we create a roadblock, then why isn&#39;t  <br/>
it good when they give up when *any* roadblock appears before them?  <br/>
Do we cheer on the hero in the movie who says &quot;Oh, well, they don&#39;t  <br/>
want me to have that so I give up&quot;? *Why* do we think kids are some  <br/>
other species? Why do we think that if we just tell them what&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; and stop them from doing what&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; that they&#39;ll just  <br/>
believe us and do what they&#39;re told? When someone does that to me, I  <br/>
get irritated and hold onto my own ideas and stop listening to them.  <br/>
Why would kids be different?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much better to be their partner than their roadblock. If you  <br/>
become an obstacle they&#39;ll find a way around you. Is that what you  <br/>
want for your relationship with your kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126118672">That was my first thought too - a need for fat for some reason (growth<br/>
spurt for instance). My mom has told me that when I was a young tot I&#39;d<br/>
grab a stick of butter and munch on it like a banana. I probably didn&#39;t<br/>
eat the whole thing (that would be too much quantity for a small<br/>
person&#39;s stomach most likely) but gnaw I did. To this day I like a bit<br/>
of butter on many things (although now we usually use Earth Balance, an<br/>
organic version of the Smart Balance margarine - nothing hydrogenated in<br/>
it) - the creamy, slightly salty taste/texture is important to me.<br/>
(aside: as for salad dressings I much prefer a good balsamic vinegar<br/>
drizzled over my veggies to anything really creamy BUT I do like ranch<br/>
dressing with my pizza lol)<br/>
<br/>
If DS was requesting a snack of just butter regularly (not just once or<br/>
twice, experimentally), I&#39;d look into other fatty, creamy type things<br/>
like cream cheese, ice cream, baby yogurt (yobaby etc - full fat,<br/>
smooth, not as tart as regular yogurt) or custard style yogurt, etc<br/>
and/or slightly salty things as well (pretzels, crackers, etc).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987618003">My husband grew up spending every weekend on his grandfather&#39;s dairy<br/>
farm where they drank raw milk after his grandparents scooped the<br/>
cream off the top for their coffee.   He still loves to get the cream<br/>
on top local dairy milk from Whole Foods and have the cream off the<br/>
top all to himself.   He loves fresh butter, whole fat whipping cream<br/>
and so forth.   He is also the big condiment guy at our house.. he<br/>
likes EVERYTHING on his hamburger while the kids and I are the ones<br/>
that like nothing or very little on ours.   <br/>
I do have butter eaters at my house though... our now 13 yr old<br/>
daughter has long thin fingers  so it was always obvious who had been<br/>
in the butter by the finger tracks!   My kids always love the little<br/>
packets of butter or margarine in restaurants.   I can&#39;t see any<br/>
reason to stop them... I also would not want someone to tell me what<br/>
is healthy and not healthy or what I should or shouldn&#39;t eat.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839700042"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, buy healthy, by your standards, foods but when someone says &quot;Can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you get a package of Oreos?&quot; the answer is &quot;Of course!&quot;<br/>
And maybe look for alternatives and see if they pass muster - DS (10)<br/>
prefers the organic, no HFCS, Oreo-like cookies from the co-op better<br/>
than standard Oreos (the cream inside is creamier for one thing) and the<br/>
&#39;gummy cubs&#39; (organic, colored with vegetable dyes) are softer and<br/>
tastier than the name brand gummy &#39;bears&#39;. Sometimes the alternate<br/>
versions (real ingredients, minimal/no preservatives, dyes, no HFCS,<br/>
etc) work fine; other times not so much. If you (global pronoun) are<br/>
working in partnership with your kids to meet needs mutually (their need<br/>
for a particular taste experience, your need to manage a budget and<br/>
provide healthful foods most of the time, etc) things tend to work<br/>
themselves around much better than if it&#39;s a tug of war as to who will<br/>
&quot;win&quot; a particular decision (Oreos for breakfast vs &quot;healthy&quot; oatmeal or<br/>
whatever).<br/>
