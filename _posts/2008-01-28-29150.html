<div id="ygrps-yiv-331026200">Hi everyone I hope to get some advice. I have twin boys who just <br/>
turned 8. When they speak they prolong their vowels on some words, <br/>
well on a lot of words. Its hard to <br/>
explain, but its like the word mommy, they say moooooooomy and daddy, <br/>
daaaaaaaaaddy. At first I thought it was a stutter that they have, but <br/>
they dont stutter consonants. Now I am not sure. I thought they would <br/>
outgrow it, but they havent. When they read they dont do it. Its <br/>
really hard to explain how they sound, but they dont soundlike my older <br/>
kids when they were eight. Another thing, they spoke very late, around <br/>
3 years old, but I noticed that they could read the tv listing and <br/>
they werent even two years old. Has anyone ever gone through this with <br/>
their kids. Their doctor hasnt noticed anything wrong with them <br/>
because they answer her with just one or two words. Thank you for any <br/>
help anyone can give me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848140325">My son displays some sensory issues.  Of course being his mom, I<br/>
notice EVERYTHING!  He has grown out of much of it now, but when he<br/>
was younger and displayed a &quot;problem&quot; I would look at it like this.  <br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s having the problem?<br/>
<br/>
Are they expressing a need to change the behavior?  (not your need,<br/>
THEIR need)  If they are embarrassed and have come to you with a<br/>
desire to change, then you can help them with pronunciation or could<br/>
seek out solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Is it affecting any aspect of their life negatively.  I mean is it<br/>
causing them great difficulty in social interactions,  or can people<br/>
generally understand them and they are enjoying conversation?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big believer in letting kids be.  I think this day in age we<br/>
worry too much about their quirks and differences.  <br/>
<br/>
But thats just me.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064566436">Gail and Katherine, thanks so much for your replies.  Yes, I *know* it&#39;s <br/>
not the sugar, but I was thinking it *could* be the HFCS in some of the <br/>
stuff he eats.  He&#39;s my &quot;sensitive to a lot of things&quot; kid.  He does <br/>
have a few food allergies and he does get eczema.  I do keep reminding <br/>
myself that he&#39;s only really been talking for about 6mo, so I&#39;m sure his <br/>
brain is moving much faster than his mouth at this point.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
very low-key about the whole thing and I do let him finish his sentences <br/>
and not interrupt him (which can be a hard thing for me).  I feel a lot <br/>
better now.<br/>
