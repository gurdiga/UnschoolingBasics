<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152753921">&quot;She is having trouble reading too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, she&#39;s not having trouble reading, she&#39;s slowly learning to read <br/>
as human&#39;s do. If you see her as &quot;having trouble&quot; she&#39;s going to <br/>
pick up on that and feel as though something is wrong because she <br/>
isn&#39;t living up to your standard.<br/>
She&#39;s learning to read. There&#39;s no &quot;trouble&quot; with that.<br/>
<br/>
Help her email friends because it brings her joy, because she loves <br/>
doing it, not to &quot;teach&quot; her anything. <br/>
If you can be her scribe, and type while she dictates what to say, <br/>
that will help her learn more joyfully than if you stand over her <br/>
and try to get her to learn about reading (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s <br/>
what you&#39;re doing, but that&#39;s the image I got when you talked about <br/>
screening her mail).<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers believe that learning is joyful. So we put the joy <br/>
before the learning, and the learning just unfolds naturally and <br/>
beautifully.<br/>
Put joy first, put your relationship first....and if you&#39;re already <br/>
doing that, then just learn to trust that learning will happen. <br/>
Truly.:)<br/>
