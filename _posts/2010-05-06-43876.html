<br/>
Mentoring<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those who would like to be grouped together with an unschooling family who&#39;s been to past Unschooling Waterpark Gatherings, we&#39;ll be offering group mentoring.  We&#39;ll put 3-4 families who liked to be mentored with a  &quot;seasoned&quot; unschooling family who&#39;s been to 2 or more past Unschooling Waterpark Gatherings. Mentoring groups will be assigned before the Gathering, so families can start to get to know their mentor and other families and to also begin sharing questions and info of what to expect at our unschooling Gatherings. Once at the Gathering, time will be allotted each morning, for mentoring families to gather and chat with their mentor, if so desired. Or families can choose other meeting times, as best works for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Speed Dating<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a fun and quick way to get to know fellow attendees, we&#39;ll be doing speed dating for families and also individuals to partake.  Participants will be given a certain number of minutes to mingle, then change &quot;dates&quot; every so many minutes over approximately a 2 hour time period. <br/>
<br/>
Mom&#39;s Night Out (MNO)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One evening will be geared toward the Moms this year!  We plan on having a mom&#39;s hot tub &quot;meeting&quot; or two  in the waterpark, evening henna painting, and a mom&#39;s night out to chat and mingle – stay tuned for more details……….<br/>
