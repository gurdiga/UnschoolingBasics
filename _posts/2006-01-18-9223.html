<div id="ygrps-yiv-911984927">&quot;So I have limited the TV to the weekends only, and the computer to<br/>
after 3, unless playing an educational game, or research etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suggest relaxing about all the TV and games.  It will keep on being<br/>
the MOST fascinating thing to them if you limit it.<br/>
What you&#39;re doing right now is causing stress and lack of harmony in<br/>
your home right? So what I&#39;m going to suggest as your first step<br/>
towards unschooling is right now, this very moment take a vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Today is the first day of summer vacation (don&#39;t worry about the<br/>
dates, it&#39;s really summer vacation ok?:). The next three months you<br/>
don&#39;t need to worry about what is &quot;educational&quot; for your children, you<br/>
don&#39;t need to cover any topics or do any projects.<br/>
You need to plan your summer vacation around doing the things that<br/>
bring all of you JOY. Watch tv with them, rent movies, go for walks,<br/>
play games because it&#39;s FUN (no &quot;educational&quot; games allowed), paint,<br/>
draw, wiggle your toes, feel LIFE flowing through you and around you<br/>
every moment!!<br/>
You are only allowed to do things because they&#39;re FUN, it&#39;s summer<br/>
vacation right?<br/>
<br/>
Do this for the next three months and please report back to us if your<br/>
children learn absolutely nothing (because they&#39;ll be the first<br/>
children EVER).<br/>
<br/>
Then, if you get to the end of the vacation and realize you were all<br/>
learning while having fun, you might just decide to keep on being on<br/>
vacation....and then you&#39;ll realize you&#39;re actually UNSCHOOLING!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365860237">Couldn&#39;t have said it any better than Ren. <br/>
<br/>
If what you really want to do is unschool then you need to step away <br/>
from anything resembling school -like expecting them to just pick up <br/>
stuff that looks &#39;educational&#39; or looks like it would when you were <br/>
doing school - *most* learning doesn&#39;t look at all like school, it <br/>
isn&#39;t divided up into subject cubbieholes and progress sequentially <br/>
and readily submit to pinning it down to grade levels and such. It <br/>
can come from anywhere - including TV and video games. They are <br/>
learning all the time, as Ren said, if you can say after 3 months <br/>
that they haven&#39;t learned anything, then it&#39;ll probably be a first. <br/>
Don&#39;t *tell* them Okay all rules are off. Just say Yes when they ask <br/>
to watch a show or turn on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
It is life in all it&#39;s abundance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015164673">&lt;&lt;Any suggestions on motivating them to learn more&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to really trust them, to really turn control of their &quot;education&quot; over to them, to see that limiting what and when they are allowed to do things to rather arbitrary limits is NOT setting up a learning environment, but a controlling one.<br/>
<br/>
You have been controlling their education and they need to de-school.  My daughter watched tv non-stop for 4 months.....then she got interested in real life.  Today, she helped me midwife a goat that was having trouble birthing a brute of a baby.  She watched her siblings while I ran an errand.  She worked at her job and worked out at the gym.  She planned a topic for speech she is supposed to give for 4-H (which she loves) and talked about a paper she is writing for a class she chose to take.  <br/>
<br/>
As long as you relax, it will happen.  If you don&#39;t, it won&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
Think about your favorite thing in the world. Then imagine that  <br/>
someone only allows you to have it for 15 minutes a month. You could  <br/>
have it other times. It&#39;s right there and you could pick it up but  <br/>
you aren&#39;t allowed to. Imagine how much energy you would focus on  <br/>
that upcoming 15 minutes you were allowed. Imagine how you would try  <br/>
to sneak in as many minutes as you could get away with to expand the  <br/>
15 minutes when you had it. Imagine what you would do if you were  <br/>
alone and you knew no one would stop you from doing it even though it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t your permitted time.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than spending energy being a roadblock, spend energy helping  <br/>
them explore their interests. Sit with them or bring laundry in to  <br/>
fold while they watch their favorite programs or play on the  <br/>
computer. Ask them what they like about them. Walk along beside them  <br/>
as they explore rather than waiting off on the side beside something  <br/>
you wish they were interested in. But do be interested yourself and  <br/>
let that interest flow out to them. Show them things. They can&#39;t  <br/>
expand their interests if new ideas aren&#39;t running through their  <br/>
lives. But don&#39;t invest much in their interest. Your part is to be  <br/>
interested in things and share with them, not make them learn.<br/>

because it&#39;s the togetherness part she enjoys as much as the craft.  <br/>
And even when she&#39;s doing something on her own like drawing she likes  <br/>
to have me drawing at the same time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049112383">THE FIGHTING<br/>
<br/>
Well the fact that my daughter is the only girl has a lot to do with <br/>
it. She is very bosy. It is not what she says, but the way she says <br/>
it. I always have to remind her to be respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
She wants things her way. My six year old little boy, always tries <br/>
to please everyone. Her, my oldest son ( 10) me, etc. He gets along <br/>
with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
However my 10 year old, picks on them both constantly. He plays with <br/>
them a lot, and I tell him he needs to grow up a little. He has <br/>
friends of all ages. But like to boss around the little kids. <br/>
<br/>
why they fight about everything, from toys, and what seat in the car <br/>
I have no idea. I think maybe they spend to much time together.<br/>
They have other friends, (very few) but are in public school all day.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested to my husband that we save up some money, and put them <br/>
in some social activities other than our regular weekend family <br/>
nights with others.<br/>

  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I am going to recommend the very best book I&#39;ve found on this topic -- Siblings Without Rivalry, by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.  You can probably find it at your local library, but really you&#39;ll want to own it, so go ahead and buy a copy.  It has some really good insights into why the kids fight, how they end up in roles (with our help) that perpetuate the fighting and ideas for how to stop the fighting.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Also, take a moment to think about how you see your children -- you opened by telling us your daughter is bossy, and that your oldest picks on the younger ones, and you spoke about how your youngest gets along with everyone, because he just wants to please.  So, the baby is the pleasing child, the middle one is bossy -- what role does that leave for the oldest child?  Good (people pleaser) child is already taken, powerful (bossy) child is already taken -- not many desirable roles left, are there?  Don&#39;t forget, too, that before they came along, he was the only child, not requiring any sort of role at all.  With only a sister, at least he was the only boy.  Now that a brother has been added -- an eager to please one, at that -- he&#39;s no longer &#39;the&#39; boy, just &#39;a&#39; boy.  And not being recognized as a good one.  So often, the roles and characteristics assigned to a child by a parent are self-fulfilling (and self-defeating).  <br/>
   <br/>
  It might help to start by looking at each of your children and your perception of them.  Maybe make a list, finding more positive ways to describe the undesirable traits -- bossy could be &#39;purposeful&#39; or &#39;leadership qualities&#39; that someday may take her far professionally.  It also helps me to recognize that the most troublesome traits for me to handle in my kids are either those that don&#39;t fall far from the tree (my kids are definitely MY kids!) or that remind me of my own siblings, which tends to put me right back in that 8yo powerless world.  It can be really scary and hard to think rationally in those moments.<br/>

Seems that you had some unrealistic expectations.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is about learning all the time. Trust in the process. Respect of their choices. And patience. Lots and lots of patience.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They know what they can and cannot watch, and adhere to these rules. BUT ALL <br/>
DAY. So I <br/>
have limited the TV to the weekends only, and the computer to after 3, unless <br/>
playing an <br/>
educational game, or research etc.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Rules schmules. Limiting results in lack which results in gorging.<br/>
 <br/>
What do you do for fun?<br/>
 <br/>
Read?<br/>
<br/>
What if *I* said that you may ONLY read for three hours a day and only on the weekends---but not ALL weekend!<br/>
 <br/>
And you may only read what *I* deem appropriate?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=- <br/>
My kids are 10(boy) 6(boy) 5(girl)<br/>
Any suggestions on motivating them to want to learn more,  and become more self <br/>
directed <br/>
in their learning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah. Back off and trust them. Respect them. Play video games WITH them. Accept that learning happens all the time---even when watching tv and playing games. <br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re self-directing NOW, but you just don&#39;t SEE it!<br/>
 <br/>

I agree. You really need to BE there with them. Fully. Completely.<br/>
 <br/>
Engage them. PLAY! Be the mom you wished you had!<br/>
