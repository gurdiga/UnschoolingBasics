  Same to you Ren!  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one out there honoring the Wheel of the Year.  The kids love this time of year.  We start out with Yule, roll into Christmas, and end with Kwanzaa.  It&#39;s like a week of celebration.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d love the recipe for your gingerbread house.  It sounds like fun.  How long did the whole process take from start to finish?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837500880">Thanks, Ren.  We had a solstice/yule celebration at Jenny&#39;s farm yesterday.  Lots of food --a delicious vegetarian stew -- and drink and kids playing inside and out.  We built a small cave, and at 5:22 pm (our local time solstice) we filled it with candles and a small mother-child figure (made of sparkly gold pipe cleaners for the baby sun).  Several of us sang a solstice song for/with the kids.  At one point in the evening, someone broke out the guitars and mandolins, along with some other instruments for some wonderful music.<br/>
   <br/>
  By late in the evening, we were down to three couples and 6 kids (4 of whom drifted off to sleep at some point).  When we left after 10 pm, there was still one candle burning in our cave.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Really a very nice welcome back for the sun.  And now the days are longer -- whether or not I can notice the difference, just knowing there was more sunlight today than yesterday is nice.  We&#39;ve spent most of the week at home -- baking, playing with new toys, and just being.  The last two months have been busy and transitional, so it&#39;s nice to just rest and have fun, while getting ready for Christmas.<br/>
   <br/>
  Happy solstice -- and Christmas and New Year -- to everyone!<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946421305">We celebrated on thursday evening with some homeschooling/unschooling families.  Had <br/>
a big feast of lots of yummy food along with mulled wine & mulled cider and they topped <br/>
it off with a sun cake and we all sang the happy birthday song to the sun.  We had a <br/>
handmade gift exchange and each family got to light a candle and give wishes/hopes for <br/>
the new year.  As a group we sang &quot;here comes the sun&quot; by the beatles and we were given <br/>
the story of the &quot;baby sun king&quot; which my son (4.75) really enjoyed.  Looking forward to <br/>
starting new traditions with our family by celebrating the solstice every year.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to do but sounds complex when explained! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
1) You&#39;ll need to download one of the logos from their site to your  <br/>
computer. (Option click (Mac) or right click (PC) on the image and it  <br/>
will ask (among other things) if you want to download it or save to  <br/>
disk or something like that.)<br/>
<br/>
2) Then upload it to a site like Photobucket (http:// <br/>
www.photobucket.com) or  Flickr (http://www.flickr.com). (Photobucket  <br/>
is easier since it gives you the code you need right on the gallery  <br/>
of photos you have. WIth Flickr you have to click through a couple of  <br/>
screens to get to it.)<br/>
<br/>
3) At Photobucket click on the code labeled HTML Tag. (It  <br/>
automatically highlights it and copies it for you.)<br/>
<br/>
4) Paste that into your blog entry. It will look something like:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photobucket.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// <br/>
i3.photobucket.com/albums/y96/avnhisky/Menvy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;  <br/>
alt=&quot;Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br/>
<br/>
5) Then change the &quot;http://photobucket.com/&quot; (right at the beginning  <br/>
after the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;) to &quot;http://www.naturalchild.org&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re done :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I found this buried on her site right after I clicked send of  <br/>
course. My instructions are more thorough but she has some logos on  <br/>
this page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/buttons.html">http://www.naturalchild.org/buttons.html</a><br/>
<br/>
You *could* copy the code under the logo you want but don&#39;t do that.  <br/>
Every time your page gets loaded it will drive up her bandwidth just  <br/>
accessing the logo to display. (She shouldn&#39;t even offer it!)<br/>
<br/>
But what you can copy from there are the width and height sizes for  <br/>
the logo. That will help your page load faster. Paste it into the  <br/>
HTML right before the &quot;border=&quot;0&quot;&quot; text.<br/>
<br/>
If something in there isn&#39;t clear, just ask!<br/>
