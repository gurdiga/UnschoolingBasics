<div id="ygrps-yiv-395981372">Hi All....I wanted to share our experience at the aquarium <br/>
yesterday....I have only been unschooling for a little over a month but <br/>
I feel so wonderful and free watching my son Anthony(age 10) each day <br/>
not have to deal with all the stress he used to have going to school <br/>
and yesterday re confirmed how happy we are with the decision to <br/>
unschool.<br/>
We set out to the aquarium with a little girl I watch and also Grandma.<br/>
We arrived and were surrounded by children on school trips. I couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe the chaos amongst the kids and teachers and chaperones. They <br/>
were so rushed....had pencils and dittos in hand and were being yelled <br/>
out from all around to hurry and did they write on their dittos. I was <br/>
struck by a young boy about 9 or so that looked so frustrated....he <br/>
turned to his teacher who was yelling(not talking but yelling) at him <br/>
to fill out his ditto...and he said no I don&#39;t want to I want to look <br/>
at the fish...and he meant it lol the teacher said well then you will <br/>
be in trouble when we get back and he said I don&#39;t care. (perfect <br/>
unschooling candidate I thought to myself lol)Some people probably <br/>
thought him to be fresh but I thought to myself this boy just wants to <br/>
enjoy his time but wasn&#39;t being allowed to.<br/>
In the meantime my son and I walked slowly enjoying everything, taking <br/>
our time staying long past the school children.....talking and <br/>
laughing. He said to me Mom I am so happy not to be in school anymore <br/>
and I said Oh me too!!!<br/>
<br/>
peace<br/>
