<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935454499">Hello All!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to send a thank you to each of the participants of my graduate survey. I deeply appreciate the time and effort that you took from your busy schedules. I will leave the survey open until this Friday November 26th at midnight (EST.) If there is anyone who still wants to jump in and participate I have provided the link.<br/>

<br/>
Several of you  asked in the open question, that you would like to read the results of the survey. Of course since it was all completed anonymous, I do not have contact information for anyone. My intentions are to post the statistics and results on a webpage and I can supply this when it is completed.:)<br/>
<br/>
Again thank you for your kindness, assistance and time!<br/>
Coleen Kosan</div>
