 </span></blockquote>Putting on my geo-confused hat here, but how far is Bristol from North<br/>
York?  I have two really good friends in Guisborough who are<br/>
homeschooling children your ages.  They edge on unschooling (I&#39;m<br/>
hoping they&#39;ll get there one day :) )  But they are really cool<br/>
eclectic sorts who plan wonderful adventures with their kids.  If it<br/>
isn&#39;t terribly far away and you&#39;d like to meet up lmk and I&#39;ll get you<br/>
in touch with them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639642287">Hi,<br/>
   <br/>
  Just wanted to poke my nose in and say hi to Anna.  I generally lurk on this list and learn, learn, learn from you all.<br/>
   <br/>
  Anna, I live in Newport (just over the bridge) and have ds 12 and 3 and am in the process of adopting a baby girl from Guatemala.  Would love to trade thoughts with you if you want to email me direct - its so nice to see someone from the UK, and so close to us geographically, on the board.<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119729886">Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me know about your friends in York.<br/>
York and Bristol are 100s of miles apart, so it&#39;s unlikely<br/>
we could meet up, but it&#39;s very kind of you to write!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry about that.  I was having a hard time remembering where Bristol<br/>
was.  I haven&#39;t been to England in almost 25 years!  (I miss England!)<br/>
 I went to school there for two years in Wooler.  If you ever are<br/>
heading that way I&#39;ll hook you up with them though.  They are great<br/>
hosts and always planning something fun!<br/>
