<div id="ygrps-yiv-579978536">I had to add here too.  I agree that being here and reading of <br/>
unschooling is infectious!<br/>
<br/>
The main reason I am here is not for unschooling, but because of <br/>
parenting philosophy.  Some of the parenting and discipline tactics <br/>
appear way too rigid for my comfort on many school at home boards.  <br/>
Training up, use the rod, just reading posts like that really makes <br/>
me cringe.  While unschoolers may read a post by me and say I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;Get it&quot; - I&#39;m thinking the same when I read school at home <br/>
posts.  My parenting, home ed ideals, life and in a way, <br/>
philosophical comfort levels are here.  <br/>
<br/>
While we have schoolish goals and objectives, our main purpose is to <br/>
have fun learning - and we are needing the books less and less.  My <br/>
comfort level with letting go and possibly totally unschooling is <br/>
growing - due mostly to advice read on unschooling boards. <br/>
