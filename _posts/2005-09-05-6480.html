<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258547770">Ok, maybe I missed a post, but I didn&#39;t see anything about Rue&#39;s book<br/>
here. Forgive me if I&#39;m doubling up. Kelly posted this to AL, I&#39;m just<br/>
importing it to share:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream is ready to take orders for her new book. She&#39;s not<br/>
comfortable blowing her own horn, but *I* am delighted to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Entitled _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life_, it is in a Q&A<br/>
format where Rue answers most, if not all &lt;g&gt;, of the questions we all<br/>
have heard or will hear as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sweet, gentle book---just like Rue! And self-published!<br/>
<br/>
I hope she will be flooded with your orders!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s her new website to promote the book---go judge this book by its<br/>
lovely cover! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279815406">I would suggest that your son simply follow his passions....he will find people of all ages who share his interests.  My kids have made wonderful friends doing 4-H because they had great trouble fitting in with the local HS group because we aren&#39;t Christian.  The local unschooling group is fantastic but we have found that few people in our area unschool past the age of 8.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve recently moved to a different state leaving behind my children&#39;s  &quot;best <br/>
friends&quot; who were their cousins living next door.  It has been  difficult for <br/>
us all but we are starting to feel connected with our new  community. I have <br/>
a 16 year old (tomorrow) daughter and a 12 year old son.<br/>
 <br/>
Some things that seem to be helping:<br/>
 <br/>
We found a robotics club that meets at a science museum weekly.  It  has both <br/>
homeschoolers and schooled kids but most are boys my son&#39;s age that  share <br/>
his interest in robotics.  Just that once a week thing has given him  something <br/>
new to look forward to.<br/>
 <br/>
He is very interested in rock and gem collecting.  Florida was mostly  sand <br/>
so he has been very excited to discover all the possibilities of finding  <br/>
treasures here in New Mexico.  We have visited rock shops, found books on  <br/>
collecting at local used book stores and gone out hiking and looking for rocks.  It&#39;s <br/>
kept him busy and that has helped with this transistion of not having his  <br/>
cousin to play with every day. I imagine it will lead to meeting some new people  <br/>
as some of the rock shops have classes geared towards kids.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re meeting up with a teen homeschooling group today to play games.   The <br/>
kids are a bit older but interested in gaming which is an interest he shares  <br/>
and as homeschoolers they don&#39;t seem too concerned that his is  younger.   <br/>
 <br/>
In general, I think the best connections with older kids come through their  <br/>
interests.  I&#39;d suggest just doing and seeing anything that might spark an  <br/>
interest. Go new places, eat at new restaurants, try cooking new foods.   What <br/>
does he love to do?  What does he like to watch on TV?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m happiest at home but I&#39;m trying to push myself to get out each day with  <br/>
one or both kids even if it&#39;s to go to a new grocery store or thrift shop  or <br/>
library.  The more you do, the greater the opportunities for meeting new  <br/>
people and you&#39;ll be having fun at the same time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. My kids have gone through phases of loneliness - the solution  <br/>
has been to get involved in some kind of group - theater group,  <br/>
karate, soccer, 4H, Girl Scouts, etc. All of these have provided  <br/>
contacts and sources of companions.<br/>
<br/>
And it takes effort - we have needed to take initiative to make phone  <br/>
calls, invite other kids to do things with us, etc.<br/>

************************************<br/>
Lonelieness is different from boredom. It sounds like he&#39;s happy with  <br/>
unschooling, and now needs people that he can share that experience with.<br/>
 <br/>
You didn&#39;t mention where you are. You might want to, because people here  <br/>
might have ideas for you that are more specific.<br/>
 <br/>
Is it possible for you to get to St. Louis for the Live and Learn  <br/>
conference? If so, there will be a passel of folks ready to meet you and your  son. Good <br/>
way to make connections.<br/>
 <br/>
The &#39;net has been wonderful for my 16-tomorrow son. He has friends all over  <br/>
the country that he talks to online and over the phone, and they get together <br/>
as  much as they can. It&#39;s not the same as having a friend next door you can <br/>
go get  ice cream with spotaneously, but for Julian it has certainly helped <br/>
with  loneliness. He has found, in particular, a very good friend who loves music <br/>
as  much as he does.  They trade cd&#39;s, talk about everything nightly, write  <br/>
songs together long distance, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
What is your son interested in? We might be able to help him connect with  <br/>
distant, but good friends who understand him, appreciate his freedom and  <br/>
interests, etc.<br/>
