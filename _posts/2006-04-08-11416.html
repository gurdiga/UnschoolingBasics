<div id="ygrps-yiv-43703463">I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m sounding a bit shocked at some of the posts lately,<br/>
but I assume that folks at least know we aren&#39;t going to advocate<br/>
leaving a child in school when their soul is being crushed.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some are finding this list as their first stop on their journey<br/>
into unschooling, maybe I need to share a few resources to help newer<br/>
members get more info. I&#39;d hate to think this list was an only resource.<br/>
<br/>
For those that are just trying to figure out this whole unschooling<br/>
thing, I highly recommend buying some of the conference CD&#39;s. They&#39;re<br/>
available at liveandlearnconference.org.<br/>
Check out Sandra Dodd&#39;s site for one of the most comprehensive sites<br/>
on the topic, with loads of links, articles and more.  Sandradodd.com<br/>
<br/>
There are more discussions at unschooling.info too.  I don&#39;t recommend<br/>
joining one of Sandra&#39;s lists though, until you really start to &quot;get<br/>
it&quot; because her lists are definitely geared for die hard unschoolers.:)<br/>
<br/>
This is a great place for getting started, but please, please do some<br/>
reading and read the list guidelines and description here if you<br/>
haven&#39;t already. It will help you get more out of your experiences here.<br/>
<br/>
As far as books, there are tons of choices, but one should really read<br/>
some John Holt at some point.  Rue Kream&#39;s &quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot; is<br/>
a really great book too.<br/>
