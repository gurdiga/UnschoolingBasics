Two views.  1) Since it sounds like you already have a computer in the house, Rock Band 3 would be new, even if you perhaps already have RB1 & / or 2.  2) How about something totally different, while saving for both of them, like something for the new pond or gardening tools.  Or one of those seeding pot greenhouses to start your seedling inside before planting. <br/>
<br/>
Just a couple thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted, I’m curious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391788606">I saw a couple of complete Rock Band ( all instruments and game) on Craigslist <br/>
for very little.<br/>
I think one was $100 or less.<br/>
This is a great time to get a computer. Lots of sale and Best Buy and Dell <br/>
finance them.<br/>
You may be able to get both! Look into it!<br/>
If you child does not need a gaming computer there are some cheap laptops for <br/>
around $300 on Walmart.<br/>
I have also known people to buy used ones for very very little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518422815">Does she need the complete set or does she already have all of the instruments?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On rock band no, don&#39;t have any of it. I think the main interest is the drums ...yes Id want to get all but I think she&#39;d be happy if we just got the game and the drum. <br/>
<br/>
On the computer we have a monitor in our storage shed so I&#39;ll have to get dh to take a look at it :) On the cpu yes it needs to be a gaming computer. She says to most people that it will be easier to do her schoolwork with another computer in the house ( maybe a going to public school thing she has picked up lol ?) but also tells me she REALLY wants to be able to play wow at the same time as daddy. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I got the girls new mattresses for their beds ....and sheets and stuff. I got my son a new bed and matress and I want to go get them some curtains and stuff to help pretty up their new rooms a little. Im also taking care of the few things they have each asked for so its likely neither item will come till after Christmas. I think we are going to all sit down and talk more to decide how to go about it. <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned the idea of an indoor green house and I love that! Oh decisions decisions...why can&#39;t money grow on trees? :P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157863703">I’m the one who recommended the indoor green house.  Here’s a simple, inexpensive way to do that yourself.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/content/indoor-seed-starting-at-home-a11008">http://www.suite101.com/content/indoor-seed-starting-at-home-a11008</a>  You can buy the special tray and little cells that you can then transplant into the garden.  Or you can just buy the little cell packs and a glass 13” x 9” pan & plastic wrap!<br/>

Ok I&#39;ll try to make a longer answer short. I can&#39;t drive much because of health conditions and I want them to have things they enjoy doing there at the house. They know that neither one are a right this minute thing. No one plans on mom&#39;s heart stopping and over 100,000 worth of medical bills to rack up in a weeks time but it did. We won&#39;t run out and put stuff on a credit card if we can&#39;t pay it off at the end of the month but we do plan purchases and save for them. Usually everyone wants the same thing and its easy...sometimes opinions differ and someone has to wait or a new plan has to be figured out :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823697392">I can relate. I am also very ill and homebound this year.  I have  also <br/>
found that I try to compensate for my illness by buying things for my  children <br/>
since I can&#39;t do very much right now. <br/>
 <br/>
My thoughts are that you should talk to the children about it. From my end  <br/>
having an additional computer would be for the whole family. I try to put <br/>
off  new video games until I can buy them used which is always 50% cheaper.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am very sorry for your illness and hope you recover quickly. <br/>
