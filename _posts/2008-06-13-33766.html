<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138122748">Hi everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been browsing unschooling lists for a little while now and have<br/>
decided that I would like to start with making some changes in our<br/>
home.  I would like to be up front and say that I don&#39;t, at present,<br/>
feel like I want to be going &quot;all the way&quot; with some of the RU<br/>
philosophy, but I do want to start improving the relationship between<br/>
me and my children, so I would very much like your help.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 boys, 2.5 yrs and nearly 8.  There are quite some issues<br/>
with the dynamics between them both, and between them and me.<br/>
<br/>
So after reading some, and thinking, I have noticed that I have<br/>
completely forgotten how to enjoy my older son&#39;s company.  It&#39;s as<br/>
though I no longer know him.  The connection is broken and I think<br/>
it&#39;s now a 2-way problem (ie he may feel that he has also lost his<br/>
connection with me). It wasn&#39;t always like this.  <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my first question.  I am thinking that a good<br/>
starting point that might not be too overwhelming (ie less likely to<br/>
give up on it) would be to try to agree to do fun stuff that would<br/>
make DS1 happy.  Maybe this would be a good way to improve our<br/>
relationship and open channels up again?  What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying a bit but it hasn&#39;t turned out to be as easy as I<br/>
thought.  An example, he will ask me to play cricket with him, I&#39;m<br/>
trying to say yes so I say yes (no reason for a no except dishes in<br/>
the sink or I just don&#39;t want to, before I would have said no and I<br/>
don&#39;t know why, in fact would almost prefer to do anything than play<br/>
with him - which is a real shame).  But almost immediately I am<br/>
thinking how to stop playing and after say 5 mins max I make an excuse<br/>
and leave him.  Can you help me get past this?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have given this a go for a short time and these are my<br/>
observations so far.<br/>
<br/>
If I firstly say no (and maybe yell, berate etc), then manage to<br/>
change to a yes let&#39;s do it and we do, are children so forgiving?  Is<br/>
this helping build our relationship or am I wasting my efforts and<br/>
still at the starting blocks?  Does he FEEL in his heart a warm yes or<br/>
is he still feeling an angry, hurt feeling from the original<br/>
no/telling off?<br/>
<br/>
Also, since trying to be more fun with him and saying yes (eg to<br/>
playing things outside my comfort zone) I notice that he is now asking<br/>
for things even further outside my comfort zone.  I feel like I have<br/>
made one step towards repairing our relationship and somehow he has<br/>
made one step back?  Is this what&#39;s happening?  What&#39;s going on here?<br/>
 I don;t think I will last very long if the limits are continually<br/>
pushed back.  I was hoping for a &quot;happy medium&quot;, a bit of a stretch<br/>
for me and happiness for him.<br/>
<br/>
I have also seen that since trying this out his demeanor towards me<br/>
(which wasn&#39;t good anyway but most probably stems from parenting)<br/>
seems to have worsened - like a bad attitude.  Would you have any idea<br/>
why this might be?  It&#39;s kind of disheartening, I don&#39;t want to open a<br/>
whole can of worms that will be really hard work for me if I&#39;m just<br/>
going to make things worse than they are now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for advices.<br/>
<br/>

It sounds like he doesn&#39;t trust you.  You need to rebuild that trust.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729218069">When the &quot;play&quot; itself didn&#39;t interest me, my children still did.<br/>
<br/>
I focused on learning more about how the child liked to play, how she  <br/>
thought, how she reacted, how she expressed herself, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d get actually caught up in the play, but very often, no.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Amanda - you sound sort of grim. Are you happy?<br/>
<br/>
If not, then is it because of how you, yourself, were parented?<br/>
<br/>
You have a second chance at a great childhood. I don&#39;t mean you should  <br/>
live vicariously through your children, but you get to experience  <br/>
their childhood as you parent them, and YOU have significant control  <br/>
over what kind of childhood THEY have. So, give your children the  <br/>
childhood you wish you&#39;d had and it will give you great joy and  <br/>
healing, too.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, sometimes, when you&#39;re doing something kind for your child  <br/>
(like playing something that doesn&#39;t appeal to you), think about it as  <br/>
if you are doing it for the little girl inside yourself, nurturing her  <br/>
and being sweet to her for no other reason than that she&#39;s worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437638262">I personally think that it&#39;s OK not to do things with your kids that you find boring...and i know the thing you are talking about where he wants more and more - I wonder that what he wants is an *authentic* experience with you; so when you aren&#39;t really able to be 100% with something, maybe he just keeps pushing hoping to get that or something- anyway, I don&#39;t think you should feel guilty about it, to start with - <br/>
<br/>
I would say try to find *one* thing that you can truly enjoy together - could be very simple, a movie or a TV show or something - especially in this stage of things I think it&#39;s fine if you say &quot;no&quot; to things that you don&#39;t want to do - and just be straightforward about it, just so &quot;no, I don&#39;t really enjoy that myself, but I&#39;m glad you do&quot; or something like that. For those things, what you might do instead is put that energy into helping him find someone else to play cricket with, a team or a friend - I do that, I will do all the driving and let them have sleepovers or whatever they want- <br/>
<br/>
when they were little I *hated* computer games (still do, actually) and I just wouldn&#39;t do them with them - I just said &quot; you guys are on your own with this&quot; and they were (eventually) fine with that.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing you might try (and this is advice I got from an intensive workshop on living with ADHD children and especially around re-builing relationships with them that CHEO puts on) is to just do something, like if he is playing a video game, just go and sit and watch him for 5 minutes - don&#39;t ask questions, or anything just watch for 5 minutes or longer if you can stand it and then go away again.  Try doing it a few times and then maybe try engaging, asking a question or whatever - if he rebuffs you, just go away again; but keep coming back until hopefully some communication will develop - just don&#39;t push it - and if that doesn&#39;t work try something else - watch him play cricket with a friend or a team, or watch cricket on TV, or get a documentary on it or watch some cricket on U-Tube; find *some way* that you can connect that you don&#39;t find boring - I actually think it&#39;s important at first to stay in your comfort zone because they can feel that lack of interest - you just can&#39;t fake it, so don&#39;t!  And don&#39;t feel guilty about it!  You are on the right track, you guys will get there!  Judy R<br/>

  I never liked video games. I always said that but when my ds got his first Nintendo DS system and he was only 4 yo I had to help and play with him.<br/>
  You know what?<br/>
  Video Games can be a lot of fun! They can be really cool.<br/>
  I now own and Nintendo DS where I play my Sudoko every night. I also love Super Paper Mario and Mario Galaxy for the Wii.<br/>
  It is a great way to connect with my child. Why not try different things with an open heart and mind just because you love your child?<br/>
  OF course if all fails you can find ways to still share and support their interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First of all, You are doing something right because you want to make <br/>
a positive change.  Change isn&#39;t always easy.  Whenever I start to <br/>
try something new, I get really frustrated when it doesn&#39;t go as I <br/>
expected.  It is like I am trying so hard to do something positive <br/>
here, and everyone seems even more unhappy. I try to remember that I <br/>
am changing for a reason, and in the past if I keep trying the <br/>
positive change works in the long run, though not always in the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will admit there are things I don&#39;t want to play with my kids, and <br/>
I feel like I might scream if I have to spend one more minute doing <br/>
it.  I limit how often I play these things, and look for things we <br/>
all enjoy like reading, board games, coloring, building legos, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Frequently, I will just sit and watch my kids play then interact <br/>
with them as they notice me watching and talk to me.  It seems a bit <br/>
easier when I am an observer first before the interaction.  I guess <br/>
maybe because there are no expectations of me, it makes it easier for <br/>
me to get in a playful mood.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep trying, and you all will find something that works for you!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What child&#39;s play is outside your comfort zone?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I didn&#39;t explain that very well, I mean playing/doing things<br/>
that it feels very hard to say yes to for whatever reason. <br/>
<br/>
Eg going to the park (quite a walk away) if I am feeling exhausted and<br/>
want to stay home. Another Eg on same topic, agreeing to go to the<br/>
park and getting a few hundred yards down the road then DS REALLY<br/>
wanting to go back for something, saying yes so he goes and gets it,<br/>
then when we&#39;ve walked on again he forgot something else and is REALLY<br/>
upset and wants to go back for that.  It was SO hard to say yes to<br/>
these things, maybe I would have said no before, can&#39;t remember?  <br/>
<br/>
My yeses made him happy.  I enjoyed the children&#39;s company on the<br/>
walk, rather than just seeing it as a chore that was a means to an end<br/>
(getting to the park) - which is how it usually looks to me.</div>

places we go, are boring to them.  <br/>
<br/>
It is less about my enjoyment of the activity, and more about the<br/>
enjoyment of my children.  It takes a little perspective change.</div>

anything else! But this one thing just isn&#39;t fun for me.&quot;<br/>

completely forgotten how to enjoy my older son&#39;s company. It&#39;s as<br/>
though I no longer know him. The connection is broken and I think<br/>
it&#39;s now a 2-way problem (ie he may feel that he has also lost his<br/>
connection with me).&quot;<br/>
But if he&#39;s trying to get you to come outside and bowl a few for him, that is so cool. Really appreciate that for what it is in the context of you feeling a widening gap between the two of you. I have only played cricket once. And it wasn&#39;t really cricket, just hanging at my in-laws and hitting a few balls. We ended up with the ball in the neighbors back garden and had to walk around the longest block in Hayward&#39;s Heath to get it back. But it was so much fun and there was a lot of laughing. The laughing was really important. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying to say yes so I say yes (no reason for a no except dishes in<br/>
&gt; the sink or I just don&#39;t want to, before I would have said no and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know why, in fact would almost prefer to do anything than play<br/>
&gt; with him - which is a real shame).  But almost immediately I am<br/>
&gt; thinking how to stop playing and after say 5 mins max I make an excuse<br/>
&gt; and leave him.  Can you help me get past this?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I still have this sometimes. I still feel like my day is filled with &quot;must dos&quot; and that playing with a child is not necessarily a &quot;must do&quot;. As I write that I don&#39;t know that I am being honest. I don&#39;t feel like that very often. But I know what it feels like. Linnaea will call me upstairs to hang out with her as she wakes up and I&#39;ll realize that I&#39;ve spent all the morning not eating as I&#39;m walking up the stairs. And my stomach will become this unfed pit that must be subdued and it will grow in importance and the joy of sitting with Linnaea and talking about her dreams of the night before and her desires for the day will shrink. And I will finally end the moment of sitting and chatting and preparing her to wake with the excuse of being ravenous and go downstairs to get a bowl of offbrand rice krispies. In my head, when this happens, there is a whole discussion going on about the importance of being with her, being in this moment, being present,<br/>
 being mindful, versus how blasted hungry I am. It helps if I remember to eat earlier than she wakes. It helps if I listen to the voice that talks about the greater good of hanging out with my 8 year old who enjoys my company and whose company I enjoy than the bowl of cereal that I can put off for another 20 minutes until her bladder requires that she make a move to start her day outside of bed. <br/>
The trick to lasting longer is to appreciate the smaller things going on when you are with your son. Appreciate his laugh, his smile, his stance as he bowls or hits. Does he have a ritual when he takes the bat? Does he touch the wicket with his bat or tap his shoes? What is his hair like? Is it short and shorn, or does the wind play with it? Quiet the sense of pressure to get something else done. It&#39;s kind of like meditation when you can figure out how to enjoy just being with your son. And there will be voices pressing you to go and do and be somewhere else. Voices saying there are chores, there are dishes, there is food, there are e-mails, there is a younger child... But you need to let his presence, his enjoyment of you be louder than the lure of other things. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I have given this a go for a short time and these are my<br/>
&gt; observations so far.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long is a short time? A week? A couple of days? A month? Your mileage will vary the longer you give it a go. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If I firstly say no (and maybe yell, berate etc), then manage to<br/>
&gt; change to a yes let&#39;s do it and we do, are children so forgiving?  Is<br/>
&gt; this helping build our relationship or am I wasting my efforts and<br/>
&gt; still at the starting blocks?  Does he FEEL in his heart a warm yes or<br/>
&gt; is he still feeling an angry, hurt feeling from the original<br/>
&gt; no/telling off?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I am reticent to do something it does taint my change of mind for Linnaea, particularly. For Simon too, but Linnaea is more sensitive to me dragging my feet. Simon is more forgiving. More willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. If you&#39;ve yelled and berated than that is a hard thing to overcome. Try and breathe before responding. Try and be who you want him to be. Calmer, right? More willing to listen to you, right? I imagine that you are yelling and berating because you feel bad about saying no, because you feel like you &quot;should&quot; be saying yes and you are letting your frustration with wanting to stretch and grow spill over onto his requests for your attention and engagement. When he asks you to do something try and remember that his childhood is finite. He&#39;s almost 8 now, in 8 years he&#39;ll be 15 almost 16. It isn&#39;t alot of time. Simon, my son, is 11. I figure every day I have a child who wants me with him is a gift. And figuring that, thinking<br/>
 about that, helps me to respond to him in ways that I hope will help him to want to be with me tomorrow as well. When he asks you to do something remember that not all children make it to growing up. I have with me, just 3 feet away,  ashes of an unschooled little girl who I never got to meet. Her momma was Linnaea&#39;s fairy god-mother at the Life is Good conference in Vancouver, Washington a month ago. Having Hannah in my mind, in my heart, helps me to quiet a lot of frustrations. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, since trying to be more fun with him and saying yes (eg to<br/>
&gt; playing things outside my comfort zone) I notice that he is now asking<br/>
&gt; for things even further outside my comfort zone.  I feel like I have<br/>
&gt; made one step towards repairing our relationship and somehow he has<br/>
&gt; made one step back?  Is this what&#39;s happening?  What&#39;s going on here?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember, again, how you started on this path with the desire to enjoy being with your son again. Hold on to that desire. You didn&#39;t come here to figure out how to sate his needs quickly so that you could get more done in the house, right? You came to unschooling, or at least the bits that you are comfortable with incorporating right now, with the desire to enjoy your son more. This is your boy. This is your baby who you held and gazed upon with more love than you knew the universe contained. I bet he pushed at your comfort zone in his infancy. I bet he pushed at your comfort zone as he moved to toddling and than to being a young boy. Stretch yourself. And hold on tight to the desire that guided you here, that dream of enjoying being with your son. <br/>
Take steps before he does. That helps enormously. Find things that feed into his interests. Find cricket stuff if that is what he loves. Watch matches with him. I don&#39;t know where you live, but in the UK it probably wouldn&#39;t be that hard for me to get Simon or Linnaea to a match somewhere. Get other things that he enjoys, or that are similar that you would also enjoy. Don&#39;t be the reactor all the time, be the actor. Be the initiator. With that in mind be prepared for him to say no. And if it hurts, and sometimes it does, breathe and remember that it must hurt him equally when you say no. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don;t think I will last very long if the limits are continually<br/>
&gt; pushed back.  I was hoping for a &quot;happy medium&quot;, a bit of a stretch<br/>
&gt; for me and happiness for him.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your limits won&#39;t continually be pushed back. But it is a new thing and it must be so exciting to get to play with you, to have you responding positively to his desires. That is wonderful! That is fantastic! Even if it feels trying and hard and more than you signed up for. Try and see it in as positive a light as you can. Try and see it as an encouraging sign that he is wanting to have you come and do with him, and no longer him not wanting your company and your engagement. Again remember that he is only almost 8 until he turns 8 and he will forever be growing and changing and aging and moving toward that day, that point, when you are no longer the person who he most wishes to come out and play with him. See it as a gift. This moment, this child and you. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have also seen that since trying this out his demeanor towards me<br/>
&gt; (which wasn&#39;t good anyway but most probably stems from parenting)<br/>
&gt; seems to have worsened - like a bad attitude.  Would you have any idea<br/>
&gt; why this might be?  It&#39;s kind of disheartening, I don&#39;t want to open a<br/>
&gt; whole can of worms that will be really hard work for me if I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; going to make things worse than they are now.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you be more specific? Without specifics, you are talking about yelling and berating when you are frustrated, it is probably not much of a surprise that your son would do the same. Healing a relationship is not the act of a few yesses. It takes time and trust and maybe he doesn&#39;t trust your acts of giving. If you stop and return to your previous status quo, however, it may make the can of worms bigger. His hope and joy will be burst by your backtracking. If he is asking you to stretch, to reach out more to him, that means he is hoping for the stars, and maybe before all he could allow himself to dream about was the moon. <br/>
It is hard work. Unschooling is hard work. But it achieves the most amazing of relationships and the feedback is often more than you could have ever imagined. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will help to not feel like a slave to your emotions. Just because  <br/>
you feel &quot;I&#39;d rather be chewing glass&quot; when he asks you to play  <br/>
cricket, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re stuck with those feelings. It takes work  <br/>
to change your thinking. Always give yourself two choices and choose  <br/>
the one that moves you closer to your goal.  The more you choose the  <br/>
better one, the easier they&#39;ll get and the easier it will be to make  <br/>
even better choices.<br/>
<br/>
Things that can help you want to make better choices are giving him  <br/>
spontaneous hugs (not with the expectation of him responding! It&#39;s  <br/>
not a gift if you expect something in return!), really look at him  <br/>
when he&#39;s happy and lose yourself in the fact that you have the  <br/>
ability to give that to him. (Again, don&#39;t expect him to appreciate  <br/>
it just yet! At the moment he&#39;s empty and it&#39;s going to need a lot of  <br/>
instances of joy until he&#39;s feeling full. He can&#39;t return when he&#39;s  <br/>
feeling empty.)<br/>
<br/>
It will take focus on your goal and work to get there! People don&#39;t  <br/>
get to the top of the mountain by trying. They only get there by  <br/>
doing until they succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will help you get into the right frame of mind to picture it  <br/>
this way. Your husband has gotten out of the habit of spending time  <br/>
with you. He decides to change. Now when you ask him to spend some  <br/>
time with you he&#39;ll say yes but you can feel that he wants to say no.  <br/>
And sometimes he does say no when he chooses something he likes  <br/>
better or if he just doesn&#39;t feel like it. And when he does say yes,  <br/>
after 5 minutes you can feel the boredom radiating off of him. If he  <br/>
wants to reconnect to you, he needs to make it top priority.<br/>
<br/>
Your son doesn&#39;t understand that dishes tend to pile up if they&#39;re  <br/>
not kept on top of, so what he sees is you choosing to do something  <br/>
you like better than spending time with him.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve said no so much, you will get where you want to go a lot  <br/>
faster (reconnecting), if you don&#39;t say no. You&#39;ve basically used up  <br/>
your quota of nos for quite a while! To get him to the point where he  <br/>
feels full, he needs to feel you&#39;re working hard to meet his needs,  <br/>
not trying to reluctantly squeeze him into things you&#39;d rather be doing.<br/>
<br/>
If someone you thought was truthful is discovered in a lie, how many  <br/>
truths do they need to tell until you stop wondering if they&#39;re  <br/>
lying? Trust is way easier to break than to build up. :-/ To build up  <br/>
his trust that you want his days to be joyful, you need to work  <br/>
harder than someone who is starting from scratch. You&#39;ll need to set  <br/>
aside what you want for a while until he feels confidence in you again.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you can try is always say &quot;Yes!&quot; though it doesn&#39;t need to  <br/>
be an immediate yes. &quot;Yes, I&#39;d love to. Would you mind  helping me  <br/>
with the dishes so they don&#39;t pile up on me?&quot; or &quot;Yes! Would you mind  <br/>
keeping me company for 10 minutes while I finish the dishes? I can  <br/>
tell you stories of when you were a baby.&quot; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m a little tired  <br/>
right now. How about after lunch?&quot; (If you put him off, you must must  <br/>
must follow through! If he knows &quot;later&quot; means &quot;only if you remember  <br/>
to remind me which I hope you don&#39;t&quot; it will feel even worse than no.  <br/>
It will feel like a no disguised as a yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I firstly say no (and maybe yell, berate etc), then manage to<br/>
&gt; change to a yes let&#39;s do it and we do, are children so forgiving?  Is<br/>

&gt; still at the starting blocks?  Does he FEEL in his heart a warm yes or<br/>
&gt; is he still feeling an angry, hurt feeling from the original<br/>
&gt; no/telling off?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a waste, but I suspect he doesn&#39;t yet feel a warm yes. It  <br/>
will take a lot of yeses until he trusts that you want to be with him.<br/>
<br/>
A drop in the bucket looks like a waste. But you need each of those  <br/>
drops if you want to fill the bucket.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, since trying to be more fun with him and saying yes (eg to<br/>
&gt; playing things outside my comfort zone) I notice that he is now asking<br/>
&gt; for things even further outside my comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The transition period is often the hardest!<br/>
<br/>
There are probably several things going on. You&#39;ve changed the  <br/>
&quot;rules&quot; so to speak. His world isn&#39;t working quite the way it was and  <br/>
he&#39;s testing it out the new rules. He&#39;s trying to figure out what  <br/>
happens when he does x. It&#39;s the same thing kids do when they have a  <br/>
new video game with a new set of rules. The basic order of operation  <br/>
is: &quot;What happens when I do this?&quot; And that&#39;s how they learn about  <br/>
the world. (It&#39;s how it works in real life too.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also been so far out of *his* comfort zone. He&#39;s trying to move  <br/>
closer to it. Unfortunately you don&#39;t get brownie points for going  <br/>
part way! You&#39;ve built up a feeling that &quot;Mom will meet very few of  <br/>
my needs&quot; (that is the things that are important *to him* not the  <br/>
things you think he should have like meals and such) to &quot;Mom will  <br/>
arbitrarily meet a few needs&quot;. He can&#39;t trust you until he feels &quot;Mom  <br/>
works hard to meet all my needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That last one gets misinterpreted lots! Confidence that you&#39;ll meet  <br/>
his needs doesn&#39;t mean you tie yourself into knots to do everything  <br/>
he asks immediately. It means you take his requests seriously and put  <br/>
energy into finding a solution.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don;t think I will last very long if the limits are continually<br/>
&gt; pushed back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What other choice do you have? If you don&#39;t reach out, he&#39;s going to  <br/>
be a preteen and then a teen and then he will choose not to be with  <br/>
you. And choose resentfully. You&#39;ll have the relationship with him  <br/>
that most people have with teens: sullen, discourteous, angry, lots  <br/>
of eye rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you have a hill to climb -- that feels like a mountain! In  <br/>
a very few short years it&#39;s going to really be a mountain. Right now  <br/>
he wants to reconnect. In a few years he won&#39;t and it will be really  <br/>
really hard to get to a point where he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that you *can* reconnect right now. It will take  <br/>
work and dedication. But isn&#39;t your son worth it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was hoping for a &quot;happy medium&quot;, a bit of a stretch<br/>
&gt; for me and happiness for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if your husband said &quot;Well, I gave her 5 minutes of my time, now  <br/>
she wants 10!&quot; how would that feel? How would it affect your  <br/>
relationship? Would it feel like he really want to connect? Or would  <br/>
it feel like going through the motions, hoping that a gesture was as  <br/>
good as really meaning it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have also seen that since trying this out his demeanor towards me<br/>
&gt; (which wasn&#39;t good anyway but most probably stems from parenting)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of resentment built up. And you will need to  <br/>
be determined to get past it!<br/>
<br/>
Quite often when kids are at their worst is when they need the most  <br/>
love. It will be hard but give him a hug and tell him you love him! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at the &quot;set backs&quot;. He&#39;s not going backwards. He&#39;s  <br/>
releasing what he had buried in there. Look at the positive steps  <br/>
only. Look at those as triumphs. Each of those is a step forward.  <br/>
Everything else is just the thorns that had been hidden on the path.<br/>

I agree, Joyce.  My kids (all 4 of them now!) are talkers.....they are very verbal!  My two olders have been busy making up a new fantasy game (sort of a story with game aspects, assimilating lots of stuff they have been doing lately).  Yesterday, they were both talking about it and telling me about the new developments.  I was getting lunch for them, packing for our camping trip and focused on getting to work on time, after getting the little ones in for a nap.  I said, &quot;Guys, I love this story that you&#39;re creating together, but I don&#39;t feel focused enough now to take it all in.  Is there another time that you can tell me about it?&quot;  Because I usually drop everthing to get the updates, they were very understanding.  My daughter said, &quot;Sure, Mom...you&#39;ve got a lot to do.  We can talk to each other.&quot;  My experience has shown me over and over again that kids understand, if they&#39;ve had their cup filled respectfully before.<br/>

  I never liked video games. I always said that but when my ds got his first Nintendo DS system and he was only 4 yo I had to help and play with him.<br/>
  You know what?<br/>
  Video Games can be a lot of fun! They can be really cool.<br/>
  I now own and Nintendo DS where I play my Sudoko every night. I also love Super Paper Mario and Mario Galaxy for the Wii.<br/>
  It is a great way to connect with my child. Why not try different things with an open heart and mind just because you love your child?<br/>
  OF course if all fails you can find ways to still share and support their interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365445982">I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to do computer games because *I* find them boring - just that I have limited patience with them (computer games, that is) and I let the girls know that - if they got reaaly *really* stuck, I would help them, but it was interesting how much they could actually do without me, and without that almost *automatic* thing of asking me for help the *second* they got stuck on something....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in the context of the post I was answering, I was thinking more that in the beginning of this mom and son rebuilding thier relationship that it&#39;s perhaps OK for her to concentrate on finding even *one* thing that she genuinely enjoys and use that as their starting place; and not to feel guilty about it being difficult to connect with him over things that she is having to struggle with - that&#39;s asking a lot in the initial stages - that change in perspective can take some time and it sounds to me like maybe they could start reconnecting right away over something simpler if she wasn&#39;t also struggling with that at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m also not saying that I *never* do anything with my girls that I intially found boring - I do, of course...but it can be a bit of an interrnal struggle to come to that place where you can overcome that intial resistance to things and make that shift in perspective, and maybe in this early stage of what they are going through it is OK to not push herself too hard - and part of my point was that she needn&#39;t feel guilty about it, as that will just make her more anxious.<br/>

  It is less about my enjoyment of the activity, and more about the<br/>

  This is more likely to work when they feel full of mom&#39;s time <br/>
  already. If they know that your usual answer is yes, if they know <br/>
  you&#39;ve tried to like something, but come to the point of &quot;You know <br/>
  guys, this is something that&#39;s really difficult for me. I&#39;ll do <br/>
  anything else! But this one thing just isn&#39;t fun for me.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me that you are somewhere along the same journey as all<br/>
people go through in finding what suits you.  What is YOUR authentic<br/>
self.  I have spent many months reading stacks of self-help books and<br/>
trying to find the peace within myself.  It is still a daily task for<br/>
me to get in tune with myself and see if I am really following my<br/>
heart and in touch with my true intentions or whether I have defaulted<br/>
to the way I was raised.  <br/>
<br/>
In my quest to identify my own needs, I spent much time leaving the<br/>
children to their own devices to explore our world.  I didn&#39;t realize<br/>
it at the time, but the children were transitioning from schooling at<br/>
home to unschooling while I was shedding my baggage.  It&#39;s not an easy<br/>
journey.  There is no first answer that is right.  It is a continual<br/>
journey.  It is one that has made me a more peaceful and content being.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are a few ways that I began to look at the relationship with my<br/>
kids (which has always been reasonably good, but I was the puppeteer<br/>
in the process rather than allowing them to be free).<br/>
<br/>
1.  If I treated my husband the way I treated my kids, how would he<br/>
react?  Why would his rebellion or resentment as an adult be any less<br/>
valid than a child&#39;s reaction?  How would you react if your husband<br/>
talked to you the way that you speak to your child when you&#39;re angry?<br/>
<br/>
2.  If I manipulate their days with my ideas of what they should be<br/>
doing, when do they get an opportunity to learn what they are<br/>
interested in?  I think it&#39;s great to offer ideas and include them in<br/>
my interests, but the need to find their own way eventually.  Why not<br/>
let them seek out their own way now while they have support and<br/>
guidance and your attention?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Is it possible that your child&#39;s behaviors and reactions are<br/>
mirroring your own behavior or attitudes?<br/>
<br/>
Step back and observe your world from his point of view and see if you<br/>
experience it the way that he does.  This may help you understand<br/>
where he&#39;s coming from.  <br/>
<br/>
Take your time.  This will not change overnight.  You seemed concerned<br/>
that he was becoming more and more demanding.  Yes.  They do.  He<br/>
wants to know how much of yourself you are willing to give to him.  He<br/>
is testing the limits.  It is worth your while to allow him to test to<br/>
see the limitless nature of your affection.  Try to push aside the<br/>
non-essentials for a few weeks and see what happens when he begins to<br/>
see that you truly enjoy saying yes to his requests.  Don&#39;t expect<br/>
miracles tonight, but they will happen (perhaps overnight, just not<br/>
the first night).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your journey.<br/>
Rachel</div>
