I&#39;m very glad you started this thread.  I was a huge anti-tv person before I<br/>
started moving more towards RU.  I gave my dd2.7 control over her tv<br/>
watching maybe 3 months ago or so.  (It seems like it&#39;s been forever, but I<br/>
know it was a little while after the new year.)  Like your son, dd is glued<br/>
to the tv.  I keep thinking of how I&#39;d read comments like what Vijay said<br/>
about give it time they&#39;ll be less interested, etc.  So far for me that<br/>
hasn&#39;t happened.  DD is really into movies, and any new movie she sees<br/>
becomes a new &quot;addiction&quot;.  That being said,  I also agree with what Vijay<br/>
said about them soaking up plots, characters etc.  It is very evident in dd<br/>
imaginary play.  She is constantly pretending her stuffed animals are the<br/>
various characters from the movies and acts out different scenes.  This is<br/>
one of the few things keeping me from turning off the tv and saying, I think<br/>
you&#39;ve watched enough.  That and of course my continuous push to move more<br/>
towards RU.  We are planning on trying for a second soon and I&#39;m concerned<br/>
about her watching tv with the baby around.  I think your idea for having a<br/>
cabinet to close off the tv might help the way you think it will.  We don&#39;t<br/>
have a cabinet cover either, and I think that&#39;s part of why she watches so<br/>
much.  Whenever we&#39;re somewhere else and the tv isn&#39;t visible she&#39;s not<br/>
interested in it.  Also, I&#39;ve found anytime she sits on the couch it&#39;s like<br/>
a memory cue  Hope this helps some how.  Thanks for starting the thread.<br/>

I think what your observing of your daughter is totally normal for her <br/>
age.  When my 1st ds was about 3, he would watch the same movie over and <br/>
over again.  He still does it now for new movies, and then he learns all <br/>
the lines from the movie ~ lol.  Obviously she&#39;s not watching TV every <br/>
waking hour or she wouldn&#39;t be doing pretend play.  Our TV is on all the <br/>
time, and our kids (almost 5 and 19mo) move from room to room playing.  <br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ll come in and sit down and watch something, and other <br/>
times they won&#39;t.  Right now my 5yo is watching something and my 19mo is <br/>
digging in the toy box pulling out toys.  We&#39;ve never restricted TV with <br/>
them.  My DH works in TV, so it&#39;s a very big part of our lives and <br/>
always has been.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m a bit confused about your comment about your dd watching TV <br/>
around the baby?  What problem do you see with that?  Your dd will be of <br/>
the age to totally understand about babies and the need to be gentle <br/>
with them.  There are 3.5yrs between my two, and my son totally <br/>
understood about being gentle and easy with the baby.<br/>

<br/>
Glued to the TV?<br/>
Constantly pretending her stuffed animals are the various characters?<br/>
<br/>
I have a suggestion for you -- don&#39;t think in terms like &quot;glued to&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;constantly.&quot;<br/>

Let&#39;s try that another way:<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t have a cabinet cover either, and I think that&#39;s part of why<br/>
she reaads so much.  Whenever we&#39;re somewhere else and the books<br/>
aren&#39;t visible, she&#39;s not interested in them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about being fearful of anything our children are<br/>
interested in. It isn&#39;t about giving power to a form of<br/>
communication,because of our own hangups. It&#39;s about trust.<br/>
<br/>
My children ALL have televisions in their rooms. Sierra has a pretty<br/>
big one too! People that visit are always asking &quot;your kids have tv in<br/>
their ROOMS&quot; like it&#39;s horrifying. (only certain people, as most of<br/>
our friends unschool at this point).<br/>
It cracks me up!<br/>
The tv is on in Sierra&#39;s room right now. Jalen turned it on this<br/>
morning after playing some games on the computer and eating a pb&j<br/>
sandwich. At the moment, Sierra and Jalen are in the living room<br/>
building with pattern blocks.<br/>
<br/>
THey feel free to come and go from the television because it&#39;s not<br/>
limited. It&#39;s just like the books on our shelves, or the games, toys,<br/>
skeletons, stamps, art materials, musical instruments they have<br/>
available to use at any moment they choose.<br/>
<br/>
Open the world to your children. Don&#39;t hide the things you fear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017124361">Well, like maybe having lap trays with playdough, or beading  <br/>
necklaces, or coloring. We had some of those with the folding trays,  <br/>
i could just have the legs folded, fill the tray with fun stuff, then  <br/>
stack them into the bookshelf. Then throughout the day I could get  <br/>
three or four out, put them on the coffee table, and people could  <br/>
choose which they wanted. We also found at an office supply store  <br/>
some static cling dry erase sheets that were maybe 2ft by 3ft, we had  <br/>
those all over our walls for a while so the kids could color where  <br/>
they liked. There is something different about coloring on a vertical  <br/>
surface!<br/>
<br/>
Have boxes of toys in the same room, one with puppets, one with  <br/>
blocks, one with books, one with little dolls and a dollhouse (or  <br/>
like my guys, they have a hot wheels garage set). It takes more room  <br/>
and more planning, but it definitely puts fun toys in the same room  <br/>
and everything is on the same level, does that make sense? So maybe  <br/>
as the toys are in the same room as the TV, they all have the same  <br/>
appeal, rather than the TV appearing special because it&#39;s rather  <br/>
shrined off?<br/>

television is in the room and on that my children will be engaged in<br/>
that which they find more interesting whether it is the television, a<br/>
book, a game, or some other play.  When we are in another room or out<br/>
of the house where there is no television it isn&#39;t that they aren&#39;t<br/>
thinking of tv (they may well be) but that which we are doing is much<br/>
more engaging at the moment.  This weekend we went to a SCA event and<br/>
in the children&#39;s pavillion there was a television.  Most of the<br/>
children, though, were much more interested in the other activities<br/>
that the Minister of Children had planned than the television.  Most<br/>
chose to shoot stuffed animals off the castle with tiny bows and<br/>
arrows than watch another showing of Princess Bride (which why they<br/>
would want to pass up on Princess Bride is totally beyond me LOL!)<br/>

Wash dishes (use dishpan of soapy water on kitchen floor to wash non-<br/>

there was anything that looked like fun.  It never failed!  :)<br/>

 I&#39;m a bit confused about your comment about your dd watching TV <br/>
around the baby? What problem do you see with that? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we have a baby, I dont want dd to watch it with the baby around.  I<br/>
have no problem with her watching it in a separate room, just not around the<br/>
baby.  Unschooly or not, I dont feel its appropriate for babies to watch<br/>
as much tv as dd does.  Not to mention the content might be too intense for<br/>
an infant, who cant communicate that.  Ive actually come a long way on my<br/>
thinking about television since first joining this group, but I still have<br/>
issues with babies watching it.  I dont limit how much dd watches tv.  I am<br/>
finally able to let go of the physical aspect of that, but I still<br/>
struggle with the emotional part, so to speak.  DD2.7 watches 3-4 hrs/day<br/>
of tv, usually movies.  Honestly, this still bothers me shes spending 1/3 -<br/>
½  of her awake time in front of the television.  So I ask myself if it were<br/>
something else that she was spending that much time doing, reading, drawing,<br/>
would it bother me.  Probably not, but I find it very difficult to get away<br/>
from the stigma.  I began writing an article more than a year ago about the<br/>
number of tvs in restaurants.  I dont feel its appropriate that<br/>
everywhere we go there are televisions on without request.   Just recently,<br/>
we ate lunch at a pizza place within a bounce house party center that had<br/>
NYPD Blue playing.    While researching information for my article, I came<br/>
across numerous studies discussing the number of violent acts witnessed<br/>
through television.  It was unbelievable.  I also uncovered research that<br/>
showed the influence of a television being on in the background while<br/>
children played.  Its hard to get all this information and statistics out<br/>
of my head and just let her have free reign over the tv.  Im taking baby<br/>
steps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366519645">My experience is that if a child or infant is not interested in TV he/she won&#39;t watch. My ds was expose to many hours of TV since he was born. ( I love TV ) but he did not watch any until he was 18 months old and found BOB THE BUILDER. At 4 he does watch TV but if something else is more interesting at that moment he has no problem just moving on from that. Also he watches a lot on discovery type stuff that you could say are &quot;educational&quot;. He does because he wanst to. It makes no difference for me if he is watching &quot;Mythbusters&quot; or &quot;Tom & Jerry&quot;. If something makes him uncomfortable he will cover his eyes or ask me to change the channel.<br/>
He has free choice and I also did when I was a kid. I love TV but if I have  a good book I like it even better!! and I can&#39;t put the book down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758896899">Hi Misty,<br/>
<br/>
I still feel from deep inside that we, as parents have something important<br/>
to do with protection. I don&#39;t give my children food with sugar and all kind<br/>
of supplements to eat because I want to offer them the highest quality of<br/>
food. I feel in my being that eating the crap that commercial ugly adults<br/>
produce is not what I want to give to my children because it damages their<br/>
bodies. And their bodies are holy, as far as I am concerned. If they loose<br/>
the connection with their bodies, they will be lost. Eating garbage will<br/>
damage their bodies. Period. I am very sure about that.<br/>
<br/>
Same with television. I see a lot of crap on the television from which I am<br/>
sure my children will suffer because it hits their unconsiousness being. I<br/>
can talk with them about it but I will not be able to heal the damage. <br/>
<br/>
It is the same with experiences... I will (after I woke up after a painfull<br/>
situation with Jesse) never allow my children to step into dangerous<br/>
situations which they are simply not able to see for what it is. <br/>
<br/>
Television itself is not dangerous or damaging but a lot of programmes are,<br/>
in my opinion, to the brains and hearts of my shining children. They are too<br/>
young to cope with violence, war and so on. And because I don&#39;t know what<br/>
the people of the programmes are going to do (I have to watch it before I<br/>
know but than it happened already) I talk to Jesse (just turned 7) and I<br/>
tell him that I protect him and don&#39;t allow him to watch this crap, the same<br/>
as I don&#39;t allow him to drive my car, as he certainly wishes. <br/>
I can see Jesse and Tygo reacting the same when violence comes on the<br/>
screen. And violence can come on the screen every second. They watch it and<br/>
are not able to walk away... Tygo is not able to tell me (2,5 years) what he<br/>
is feeling but Jesse tells me that he is paralyzed when he sees children aho<br/>
fight or calling each other names, when there is an operation of whatever on<br/>
the screen. So I have two choices: I watch everything with them, interfering<br/>
when I see that it is upsetting them... or I leave them alone with the<br/>
machine which turns out to be very scary to them.. Or I talk with Jesse and<br/>
come to the conclusion that this is not what we want to live in this house.<br/>
Television is hypnotizing to my children and they are not able to runaway<br/>
from it.<br/>
So I protect them from it.. with the permission of Jesse.<br/>
<br/>
They watch videos as much as they want and that is it. No television in this<br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
A different view.. I think it will all change when they are older and much<br/>
more able to see what is going on... Until then... no tv. <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re pretty sure about things that haven&#39;t been true in this house,<br/>
nor in the home of a lot of other radical unschoolers!!  I think the<br/>
only way a person can learn to balance their OWN bodies is by being<br/>
given trust. Just because sugar affects one person negatively, does<br/>
NOT mean it will affect another the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a very healthy individual that eats sugar, but not meat. Works for<br/>
me, I feel great. But some folks in this house like meat. I would<br/>
never want to shame them for their own personal choice.<br/>
Radical unschooling requires trust. Trust that my own ideas aren&#39;t<br/>
necessarily the best and most valuable....except for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Eating &quot;garbage&quot; doesn&#39;t damage bodies if they&#39;re getting the healthy<br/>
stuff too. Most people will balance themselves out if they&#39;re provided<br/>
with healthy options and trusted.<br/>
<br/>
If violence is damaging to your children, then they won&#39;t want to<br/>
watch it. If it&#39;s not damaging, they&#39;ll be just fine. Trust me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 16.5y.o. that LOVES violent video games and horror movies. He<br/>
has since he was very little.  He&#39;s a peace activist that stood on a<br/>
hot corner of Pensacola almost daily to protest the Iraq war before it<br/>
started. He cringes when parents are mean to their children (or<br/>
siblings are mean to each other) and is a very gentle, sweet soul.<br/>
<br/>
Children are smart enough to discern pretend violence from real. What<br/>
hurts children is REAL violence. Children that are treated with<br/>
respect, trust, kindness and gentleness don&#39;t learn to be violent.<br/>
Games and movies and tv shows don&#39;t create violent people, violence does.<br/>

produce and so on. But, we also eat out, including fast food, and we  <br/>
eat sweets and enjoy them very very much. We just came back from  <br/>
dinner out - 3 of the 4 of us ordered salads and one of us ordered a  <br/>
hamburger. We had one very large order of fries that we shared. One  <br/>
kid had lemonade and one had iced tea and my husband and I had water.  <br/>
Nobody had desert - we don&#39;t really have the idea of desert after a  <br/>
meal, here, because everybody eats when and what they want and eating  <br/>
extra sweets after a nice meal isn&#39;t all that appealing. AND we sat  <br/>
there for two hours laughing and talking and enjoying each other&#39;s  <br/>
company and the food was delicious and the company even better.  <br/>
Nobody was afraid; nobody was feeling guilty for eating &quot;crap.&quot;  <br/>
Content and happy, we are now home and each of us is doing our own  <br/>
thing right now, but in a few minutes we&#39;re going to get back  <br/>
together and play cards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Extremely strong language. Do you think those of us who eat what you  <br/>
think of as &quot;crap&quot; are all &quot;lost?&quot;  What does that mean?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - the rest of us are feeding our children garbage? Period? Very sure?<br/>
There is a wonderful book about children&#39;s nutrition called, &quot;Let  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But - would your children actually want to watch &quot;crap?&quot; Mine have  <br/>
never wanted to watch anything that would hurt them - they want to  <br/>
watch things that expand their worlds, that give them pleasure, that  <br/>
stimulate their thinking, things that are funny, or provide insight  <br/>
into human nature, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can talk with them about it but I will not be able to heal the  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are living in unnecessary fear - and THAT, along with a tendency  <br/>
to judge others very harshly, will probably be what your children  <br/>
learn from you.<br/>
