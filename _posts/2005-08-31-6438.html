<br/>
Denise, who lives north of NO has asked me to post a message.  If anyone can help them, <br/>
it would be GREATLY appreciated.  Alison <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abzb@...">abzb@...</a>   Here&#39;s the message:<br/>

We&#39;ve been staying to Houston and don&#39;t have a hotel room anymore so we&#39;re trying to get <br/>
