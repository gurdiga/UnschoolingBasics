<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751026916">Well heck, this is a topic I can really sink my teeth into.:)<br/>
I&#39;m a professional make-up artist, working my own freelance business<br/>
and  also part-time for MAC.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have a 15 yo daughter who loves doing the make-up of friends and<br/>
family.<br/>
She would like to know what kind of training she needs to do this as a<br/>
career.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t need to attend a beauty school, though taking specific<br/>
classes look good on a resume. Buy her books by Kevin Aucoin, Bobby<br/>
Brown etc... A really technical book is &quot;Technique of the Professional<br/>
Make-up Artist&quot;, a bit expensive but totally worth it.<br/>
<br/>
For MAC, a background in either cosmetics or Art is good. Aesthetician<br/>
school is not going to teach her anything about artistry, but it does<br/>
teach you a lot about skin and skincare, which is always helpful and<br/>
allows you to offer other procedures to your clients. If she&#39;s going<br/>
to spend time doing some kind of schooling, cosmetology wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
It&#39;s focused on hair, but many make-up artists offer hair and artistry<br/>
when travelling to clients and they can usually book more weddings and<br/>
such that way....not necessary for a successful freelance business though.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the cosmetic counters do not hire artists...they hire sales<br/>
clerks. You may or may not run into someone with good artistry<br/>
skills...it&#39;s a crapshoot.<br/>
The only company that is artistry focused is MAC. If she&#39;s into the<br/>
artistry end of cosmetics, she should talk to the MAC people in your town.<br/>
<br/>
The very best thing she could do is read books, practice on her<br/>
friends and start getting photos of her work. She&#39;ll always have<br/>
willing guineau pigs to practice on, people love getting makeovers.<br/>
Invest in some quality tools for her, a brush belt and some high<br/>
quality products.<br/>
<br/>
She should play, play, play right now!! That will be far better in the<br/>
long run.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you&#39;re coming to the conference, I&#39;d be happy to share my<br/>
knowledge with her.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037994906">What is MAC?<br/>
 <br/>
I went to Cosmetology school 21 years ago... ugh... and I recall something<br/>
about a program that was for cosmeticians.  They didn&#39;t have to do the<br/>
haircutting part of the course and they had their own licensure requirements<br/>
that were less than a cosmetologist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975323318">Ren, thanks for the information.  My daughter, Hannah, already has a couple <br/>
of books by Bobby Brown and I will check for the others you mentioned.<br/>
Can you give me more information about MAC?  We live in the Denver, Colorado <br/>
area.  I looked in the phone book and the yellow pages but the only MAC I <br/>
could find was an autosports store.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you meant.  <br/>
:-)<br/>
You mentioned getting her some high quality tools.  Would that be what we <br/>
would find at a beauty supply store or is there some place better on-line to <br/>
get stuff?<br/>
Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be at the conference unless there is a divine <br/>
intervention.  But I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s impossible.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kathy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876936484">&quot;What is MAC?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It stands for &quot;Makeup Art Cosmetics&quot;, started back in 1984 in <br/>
Toronto....spread only by word of mouth. The two guys that started it <br/>
were frustrated with mainstream cosmetics for use in the fashion <br/>
industry so they started their own line.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s famous for being ultra trendy, having awesome color (high <br/>
pigmentation) and focused on the art end of things. It&#39;s credo is &quot;All <br/>
races, all genders, all ages, all MAC.&quot;  They are one of the only <br/>
companies that can easily meet the needs of all ethnicities and train <br/>
their people as artists, not salespeople.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, didn&#39;t mean to get off topic too much here. You can google MAC <br/>
cosmetics and get loads of information.<br/>
<br/>
