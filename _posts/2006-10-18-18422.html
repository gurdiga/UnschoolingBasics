 </span></blockquote>I tried to respond to this earlier, LOL, but forgot to change the *send to*  <br/>
address from the digest.  I have called and e mailed everyone running on  the <br/>
state level.  Asking them questions about issues that I think are  important <br/>
(namely homeschooling laws here).  I have found them to be very  open and more <br/>
than willing to call me and talk to me and answer questions.  <br/>
