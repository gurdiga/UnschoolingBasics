<div id="ygrps-yiv-641830760">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you know I started a new blog. I already have one <br/>
at www.thebrownlowdown.blogspot.com that I use as just a general blog. <br/>
My new one is www.homeschoolblogger.com/LeapOfFaith and is devoted to <br/>
our new adventures in unschooling. Just wanted to let everyone know in <br/>
case you wanted to check it out. I would love to get other people&#39;s <br/>
blogs to add to my links if you want them out there. You can email <br/>
them to me off list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LeslieL23@...">LeslieL23@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658350859">Hey Lesa, thanks for this info. I&#39;ve never heard any of this before (I <br/>
don&#39;t even know who the Pearls are) but I will definitely check it out <br/>
more thoroughly. I definitely don&#39;t condone any of that if it is all <br/>
true. In the meantime, if you would let me link you to my blogspot <br/>
blog, I would love that. Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491336710">Hi Leslie...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great that you&#39;re starting a blog. There can&#39;t be enough <br/>
unschooling ones out there. You can link to our unschooling blog. <br/>
Here&#39;s the url: http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
PLease don&#39;t link me to homeschool blogger and you should consider <br/>
starting your blog someone place else. Lots of people have left HSB <br/>
already because of what happened. <br/>
