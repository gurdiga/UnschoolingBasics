Isn&#39;t it true that the groups tend to fight until the end of Feb or  <br/>
beginning of March?  <br/>
 <br/>
Blame it on SAD, I suppose.  Or the weather.  <br/>

Right now Mercury is in retrograde, and that never helps.  :)<br/>

Happy Holidays, everybody!<br/>

I don&#39;t know. I hate shopping. I&#39;m disabled and use a scooter in stores and  <br/>
you don&#39;t know how many rude, inconsiderate jerks there are. We HAD to go <br/>
today  to get some things (we&#39;re getting a puppy tomorrow, needed some stuff!), <br/>
and the  kids needed boots. I had a woman ram me with her cart, a few others cut <br/>
me off,  my husband was getting very angry. We also had the 3 kids in tow. <br/>
One guy almost  rammed our van when we were parking in the handicapped parking. <br/>
We had the plate  up and everything. He ended up parking a few slots over and <br/>
uttered a few choice  words as he walked past. Yay... &#39;tis the season...  <br/>

I think it brings out the worst in people that already have the worst <br/>
in them. <br/>
<br/>
Today my husband was bringing our car to the mechanic and it stalled <br/>
out on the way. He pulled into a parking lot and a few seconds later a <br/>
guy stopped and offered a jump. Turns out his battery was to small to <br/>
charge us. My husband said thanks and started to call me to let me <br/>
know what was going on. About a minute later, the guy walked back and <br/>
he had another guy with him. He said he felt bad that his car couldn&#39;t <br/>
help us so he asked someone else. :-)</div>
