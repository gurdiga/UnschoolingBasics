  I am just beginning this homeschool journey, and the idea of <br/>
  unschooling fits with how children learn.  But I am curious what it <br/>

I  am just beginning this homeschool journey, and the idea of <br/>

<br/>
My state requires me to keep records.  I have found it easiest to  get a <br/>
Week-At-A-Glance Teacher&#39;s Planner.  I have to &quot;teach&quot; five subjects  and I fill <br/>
in something we did that day in  that subject.  For example under &quot;Science&quot; I <br/>
might write  &quot;observed baby birds in bird house, observed opossum, looked up <br/>
opossum on  internet, water play, planned to check on baby birds after storm, <br/>
visited  weather website.&quot;  Today under &quot;Math&quot;  I wrote &quot;played Yahtzee, dice  <br/>
play: prediction and chance, discussion of time, calendar&quot;.  Going to the  home <br/>
and garden store could be social studies (jobs people do), science  <br/>
(gardening, building, machinery) and math (money, estimating materials needed,  <br/>
measuring).<br/>
 <br/>
Some days are easier than other to come up with education-ese.  I  really <br/>
look at a week rather than a day.  If one day is more science-heavy,  I spread it <br/>
out over the week.  I also keep a running list of excursions  (including <br/>
doctor&#39;s visits, interesting errands, day trips), books read, movies  watched, <br/>
websites visited, tv shows, magazines, activities, etc.  <br/>
You could add a note about time spent until it adds up to four hours.  <br/>
 <br/>
On the files section of this yahoo list is a neat form to fill  out....things <br/>
like &quot;thinking&quot;, &quot;doing&quot;, &quot;planning&quot; that is a good way to  classify an <br/>
unschooling day without assigning school subjects if that isn&#39;t  required by your <br/>
state.<br/>
 <br/>
Just curious, since I move around alot, what state are you in?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old are your children? Mine are young, but you&#39;re welcome to check <br/>
out my webpage, below, and my blog, which is linked off there. You&#39;ll <br/>
see in great detail what our learning looks like and how I document it. <br/>
I keep it relatively up to date, though we&#39;re in the middle of a <br/>
potential move, having realtors in and out of the house and my mind and <br/>
time otherwise occupied, so it&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve updated.<br/>

Everyone will have a different answer.  :)  Here&#39;s a link to a <br/>
collection of unschoolers&#39; &quot;typical days&quot; that you might like to check <br/>
out.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/typical">http://www.sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>

<br/>
You might find the info here helpful, too.  It&#39;s how a parent <br/>
summarized their unschooling lives into California&#39;s state educational <br/>
standards&#39; language.  You can glean some of the ideas to fit your <br/>
state&#39;s requirements.  I&#39;ll give you the links to both elementary and <br/>
secondary since I don&#39;t know the age of your child(ren).<br/>

think most people realize that and don&#39;t take it too seriously.<br/>
