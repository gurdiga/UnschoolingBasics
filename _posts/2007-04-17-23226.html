<div id="ygrps-yiv-199641837">We have been moving into unschooling (we use the term whole life<br/>
learning with DH.. its less scary to him that way) and I started a<br/>
blog to record our journey.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sierramama.blogspot.com/">http://sierramama.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
any tips, hints, suggestions or critiques are welcome!<br/>

(I want to learn .html so I can change my template and graphics but<br/>
that will come in time.  I have submitted to the unschooling blog ring<br/>
but I am waiting for approval so the link is on there but it won&#39;t<br/>
work yet.)</div>
