<div id="ygrps-yiv-862419948">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and would like some advice. We are in Florida by<br/>
the way, so I have been checking into the &#39;laws&#39; of unschooling. It<br/>
seems to me that Florida is pretty relaxed, am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, our story is this.... we have 2 children, Ethan just turned 4 and<br/>
his sister is 18 months. I&#39;ve been a SAHM since Ethan was born. I&#39;m a<br/>
very hands-on mommy, the kids are always with me and we spend lots of<br/>
time together. We are Attachment Parents and practice Gentle<br/>
Discipline.  <br/>
<br/>
Ethan is extremely smart, he learns very quickly and asks lots of<br/>
questions. I guess you can say we&#39;ve always unschooled, he&#39;s learned<br/>
so much through everyday life. He&#39;s never been away from me, meaning<br/>
he&#39;s never been in any sort of school setting and has never shown any<br/>
interest in going. <br/>
<br/>
I do feel guilty at times when Ethan&#39;s begging for kids to play with<br/>
(such as the neighborhood kids) and they are all at school. But then<br/>
again, he never says he wants to go to school, too. I have asked him<br/>
if he&#39;d like to go to school and he says &quot;No, I want to be home with<br/>
you, Mommy&quot; which makes me very happy! But he doesn&#39;t know what school<br/>
is and has nothing to compare being home to. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always, always planned on keeping the kids home and<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling them. My husband and I both had awful school<br/>
experiences and hated school! I cried through K and some of 1st grade,<br/>
and I do believe that made me despise school somewhat! I just wasn&#39;t<br/>
ready and wanted to be at home with my mother so bad. And even later<br/>
on in school when I was considered &quot;popular&quot; I<br/>
hated going and would&#39;ve chosen to stay home if given the chance. I<br/>
ended up quitting school in the 10th grade and getting my GED.<br/>
Ironically, my husband has a similar experience in school that ended<br/>
the same way. <br/>
<br/>
So, having said all that, I do worry that I(WE) don&#39;t have enough<br/>
education to teach/help our kids through their school years. Do any of<br/>
you worry about this? <br/>
<br/>
And to top it off, there&#39;s a great Charter school opening near us for<br/>
K-8. It&#39;s basically the result of our Montessori/Waldorf schools only<br/>
going to 1st grade. It sounds like a great opportunity and now has me<br/>
questioning my decision to keep Ethan home. NOT because I want him to<br/>
go off to school (the thought gives me a panic attack) BUT I don&#39;t<br/>
want to sell him short either and this school will be offering The<br/>
arts (music, movement, physical arts(pottery, drawing, etc) Waldorf<br/>
handworking and rhythm, Montessori self-directed, self-correcting<br/>
materials, and unschooling techniques of letting kids learn through<br/>
everyday life with Multi-age groups so kids can feel comfortable<br/>
working above or below their grade level.  <br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s a charter school, it&#39;s considered public (free) but very<br/>
parent-led. It&#39;s probably going to be very hard to get accepted into<br/>
this school since spots are limited. I&#39;m just not sure if I should try<br/>
or not. I would never leave Ethan at school (or anywhere) that he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to be. But he enjoys other children so much that I wonder<br/>
if he&#39;d enjoy it?<br/>
<br/>
If you had a chance at what sounded like a great school, do you think<br/>
it&#39;s woth it or is it always better to homeschool/unschool?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice for me?  I just want to do the right thing and I realy<br/>
stress out about the &quot;school&quot; issue!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929444435">Welcome Tricia!<br/>
To tell the truth, I was never wild about school either, and I am  <br/>
deliriously happy we&#39;ve unschooled. But I also don&#39;t believe school is  inherently evil <br/>
or wrong for every family.  That said, I have very simple  advice for you.  <br/>
Your son doesn&#39;t want to go to school and you don&#39;t want  to send him.  Don&#39;t!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re worried that you&#39;re not smart enough to help your bright child  learn. <br/>
Think about this: are the most important things you&#39;ve learned in life  <br/>
things you learned in a classroom setting? I bet not! You learned about  parenting, <br/>
functioning as an adult, and probably many other things. You&#39;ve read,  you&#39;ve <br/>
talked to people, explored. You had enough curiosity about parenting, for  <br/>
example, to discover approaches your mom had never heard of!<br/>
 <br/>
And you and and your husband are not going to be the only people who help  <br/>
your son learn. There&#39;s a whole world out there you can explore together. You  <br/>
can help him find his passions and nurture them and help him find resources. If <br/>
 he discovers a passion for nuclear physics at age 8, you&#39;ll find people who <br/>
are  thrilled to share their love for nuclear physics with so young a child.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ll find people of all ages, not just age-peers, who will become Ethan&#39;s  <br/>
friends. Ultimately that matters more than becoming friends with someone just  <br/>
because they sit next to each other in school and are both exactly six years  <br/>
old.<br/>
 <br/>
You can do this. We&#39;ll help!<br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn<br/>

  <br/>
  My thoughts on reading your post were back to when I DID send my son <br/>
to K, and later my youngest on to preK.  Oh how I wish I never would <br/>
have done that.  Especially after we all came home and now having spent <br/>
time with them I realize I can&#39;t get that time from school back!<br/>
  I bet there are lots of things you can sign you son up for that would <br/>
get him involved with lots of other kids!<br/>
  We&#39;ve been unschooling now for about a year and a half, and I was <br/>
just telling my ds 11, on Monday, that I was having one of those days <br/>
when I was wondering if anything I am doing is &quot;right&quot;.  I had alot of <br/>
those days in the beginning, thankfully they don&#39;t come around so much <br/>
anymore!  <br/>

<br/>
My experience is however good the school is it is never as good as unschooling. Not ever! My older kids went to &quot;good schools&quot; for a while and have suffered the consequences ever since. My youngest have never been.They are inquisitive, free thinking, motivated kids. Don&#39;t do school cos if you do that will not come back so easily if you decide it is not working.<br/>

Make a list. Make several lists. Good points of going to school. Bad points <br/>
of going to school. Good points of not going to school. Bad points of not going <br/>

I&#39;m just going to respond to this question, Tricia.<br/>
<br/>
For *us* . . . we do have those &quot;chances&quot;.  There are quite a few <br/>
alterna/crunchy schools in our area.  We could afford them if I got a <br/>
paying job and worked while the kids were in school.  But, no, my <br/>
husband and I do not think it&#39;s worth it and we would definitely not <br/>
choose to enroll our children in school.  Any school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently re-reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s _Dumbing Us Down: The <br/>
Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling_ (book club chat starts <br/>
tomorrow over at the AlwaysUnschooled Yahoo group).  Pick it up or <br/>
borrow it from a library if you can.  It&#39;s not a huge book by any <br/>
means, but IMO it does have a lot of insight into this system and lots <br/>
to think about.  The author has another of his books online that you <br/>
can read at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm">http://johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, Tricia, the choice is (obviously) not mine to make.  You <br/>
just have to listen to your heart and your children.  What do they want <br/>
to do?  What is your heart telling you?  I think you already know the <br/>
answer.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Waldorf and Montessori schools are rigid places where kids have to do <br/>
things exactly &quot;their way&quot; or they are &quot;wrong.&quot; What if your kid <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen to be interested in the Waldorf-style music, movement, <br/>
pottery, drawing, handworking, etc.? What if your child wants to play <br/>
pretend - there is none of that at a Montessori school. What if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to build the pink tower, but wants to build a pirate ship <br/>
or a farm out of those &quot;self-correcting&quot; materials? Montessori <br/>
materials are &quot;self-correcting&quot; because they have one way to use them <br/>
and one way only. All children in a class learn the same subject matter <br/>
- there is a curriculum - the &quot;individualized&quot; part of a Montessori <br/>
elementary school is that they don&#39;t all do it at the same time - they <br/>
have freedom to do their math first and science later. Classrooms are <br/>
expected to be quiet, kids are expected to be on-task all the time, <br/>
they haven&#39;t got much &quot;recess&quot; time.<br/>
<br/>
Also - Waldorf doesn&#39;t typically have multiple age levels together and <br/>
Montessori &quot;multi-age&quot; groups are a small range of ages - usually 2 <br/>
grade levels.<br/>
<br/>
Your own educational background isn&#39;t particularly relevant to how well <br/>
you can unschool, Tricia. Supporting your own children&#39;s interests is <br/>
what it is all about. You are as capable of doing that as somebody with <br/>
a PhD. You are a resource person, but not the source of all knowledge. <br/>
Focus on keeping your children&#39;s lives happy and give them lots of <br/>
exposure to the world around them and opportunities to try out new <br/>
experiences. Learning will happen naturally - they&#39;ll learn from all <br/>
the books, tv, movies, music, play, conversation, friends, activities, <br/>
games, trips, and everything else that your family does.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, start now. If you son seems wistfully wishing for more play <br/>
time with other kids, do something to make that happen. Go to <br/>
homeschool groups - they have younger kids, too, you know. You can go <br/>
to more than one group. START a group. Get out a calendar JUST for play <br/>
dates and make the effort to schedule them and write them down so he <br/>
knows they are coming up.<br/>
<br/>
(And you can eventually stop worrying and thinking about what he&#39;s <br/>
learning - because you&#39;ll just know that he&#39;s learning all the time - <br/>
but just for this time maybe it&#39;ll help you to realize that by using a <br/>
calendar to keep track of play dates - something important to him - <br/>
he&#39;ll be learning all the calendar &quot;lessons&quot; that are commonly &quot;taught&quot; <br/>
in kindergarden and 1st grade and 2nd grade. This is the kind of thing <br/>
that &quot;just happens&quot; when parents are supporting kids&#39; interests. <br/>
Learning happens. Notice it doesn&#39;t take advanced educational degrees <br/>
to get a calendar for him and write HIS planned activities on it.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay - one little addition to my rant &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Self-correcting is a fancy way of saying that things spill or look <br/>
obviously wrong in some way when you &quot;do it wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A Montessori example is to put out two bowls and put beans in the bowl <br/>
on the left and have the child use a spoon to move the beans to a bowl <br/>
on the right. This is supposed to help their motor coordination and <br/>
their learning to read from left to right. The &quot;self-correction&quot; is <br/>
that the beans drop outside the bowl. Oh- and when the kid can do it - <br/>
change the beans to rice or give them a smaller spoon.<br/>
<br/>
At home, the kids will &quot;spoon&quot; things like the beans from a serving <br/>
bowl onto their own plates. Or the eggs or the potatoes or whatever - <br/>
who cares? Kids at home will get the chance to use a spoon. Guaranteed. <br/>
You don&#39;t have to set up a &quot;learning center&quot; for this. And mom can be <br/>
there to help clean up - to give him/her a bigger spoon if he/she needs <br/>
it. And the kid will spoon his/her own stuff IF and WHEN he/she wants <br/>
to do it and NOBODY else except the child knows when the right time is <br/>
for him/her to spoon things - when the challenge will be fun and <br/>
satisfying and beneficial versus too-difficult and frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you happen to eat Chinese food and you get some <br/>
chopsticks and your kid seems interested in using them - you might put <br/>
some cotton balls in a bowl and let him/her try to move them to another <br/>
bowl with the chopsticks. That&#39;s fun. Or have a relay - pass <br/>
cottonballs around the table from one person to another using <br/>
chopsticks.  Or not. The kid can learn to use chopsticks ANYTIME. Don&#39;t <br/>
give a 3-period lesson on it.<br/>

remember only one incident--A teacher showed us a<br/>
relief map with real water poured in where the<br/>
atlantic ocean would go, and I said &quot;I could just walk<br/>
across that!&quot; The teacher told me that no, I couldn&#39;t,<br/>
it was too big.  I said &quot;Well, then, I&#39;ll turn into a<br/>
giant and walk across it!&quot;  She told me no, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
turn into a giant, it wasn&#39;t possible.  I remember<br/>
crying in the corner the rest of the day....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just have to comment on chopsticks.  I love them and eat with them <br/>
all the time.  I found them very natural to use when I lived in <br/>
Japan as a child.  My children, however, have found them difficult <br/>
to manage despite literally thousands at attempts at teaching them <br/>
how to hold and manipulate them.  When we were at Epcot last year we <br/>
ate at one of the Japanese restaurants and the waitress took my <br/>
children&#39;s chopsticks and stuck a piece of paper at the end (not the <br/>
eating part) and then took a rubberband and made a pair of tongs out <br/>
of them.  Voila!  My kids could suddenly eat with chopsticks.  The <br/>
waitress, who was from Japan, said that is how the babies in her <br/>
family are taught to use chopsticks.   My kids are starting to get <br/>
the hang of it now.  It isn&#39;t exactly the technique for holding <br/>
chopsticks, but it works.<br/>
<br/>
OK, off to more on-topic stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334612534">**Your own educational background isn&#39;t particularly relevant to how well<br/>
you can unschool, Tricia. Supporting your own children&#39;s interests is<br/>
what it is all about. You are as capable of doing that as somebody with<br/>
a PhD. You are a resource person, but not the source of all knowledge.**<br/>
<br/>
For instance...<br/>
<br/>
I have no education in art. Less than that. I had a negative education in art <br/>
- before I was 10 years old I was convinced I was uncreative and &quot;bad&quot; at <br/>
art. Whatever instruction I received in materials and techniques went straight <br/>
through under the pressure of trying to do &quot;good&quot; art badly. I also never felt <br/>
competent to &quot;appreciate art&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have several artistic children. ! I have several children who&#39;ve been very <br/>
interested in learning new techniques, using different materials, exploring <br/>
new visions. There wasn&#39;t anything I could teach them about art. Nothing. There <br/>
are lots of things I know a lot about and can share with an interested child, <br/>
but art, the big whole grandness of ART, wasn&#39;t one of them. But I could learn <br/>
along with them, and I could help them find resources - materials, books, <br/>
videos, people. I could pay attention to when they were happily flying along, and <br/>
when they were frustrated or bored, and explore with them what they needed <br/>
(if anything) to soar again. <br/>
<br/>
I never worried about math but art made my hands shake. :-) It doesn&#39;t <br/>
anymore. We live in a *wonderous* time. All the knowledge and skills in the world <br/>
are out there, waiting for you to explore them, if you wish. <br/>

I don&#39;t know if I ever posted an intro to this group before, but I had <br/>
to pop in on this one...<br/>
<br/>
I was in almost the exact situation you are describing, just a few <br/>
years ago.  We unschooled when they were little, without knowing there <br/>
was a name for what we were doing...just played and had fun.  I <br/>
agonized over the thought of school, then found out about a wonderful <br/>
charter school. It sounded great!  Open door policy, child led <br/>
learning, blah blah blah.  If we didn&#39;t get in, we were going to <br/>
homeschool.  But we did get in, my ds went to K there last year, and <br/>
this year started 1st grade, dd started K. It wasn&#39;t as great as it <br/>
sounded.   <br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling last month :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052002848">Wow! Thanks to everyone who responded with advice and for sharing your<br/>
own stories. I can tell this is a really great group and I&#39;m so glad I<br/>
found it! <br/>
<br/>
This darn charter school that has my interest is actually being<br/>
started by a group of mommies, some of whom I know personally. They<br/>
are trying to keep it short hours and as close to homeschool as you<br/>
can get outside the home. It sounds great but I&#39;m still not sure it&#39;s<br/>
what&#39;s right for my family. <br/>
<br/>
Ethan seems uninterested in school and even though he loves to play<br/>
with other children, he doesn&#39;t like to go anywhere with out me so I<br/>
would imagine school would be scary for him. <br/>
<br/>
I know I will be needing your support in unschooling, its nice to know<br/>
others!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tricia, it sounds like you do know the answer, you may just not be <br/>
ready to name it.  It is also hard to tell friends that you don&#39;t want <br/>
to do something that seems (at least to them) like a grand idea.  <br/>
Ethan can play with other kids without having to go to school and he <br/>
can remain with you.  And by having his concerns honored (needing to <br/>
be with you) is going to strengthen his adventuring spirit.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to tell your friends who are starting this co-op school, &quot;What <br/>
you are planning seems very interesting.  I wish you the best of luck <br/>
in your endeavors.  This is something, though, that we feel won&#39;t work <br/>
well for our family.&quot;  <br/>
