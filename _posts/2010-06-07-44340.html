<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952884417">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 18 months and un-schooling for 16 months.  Radical unschooling is helping our family to heal.  I love it.<br/>
<br/>
Last fall I returned to full time work after a year and a half off, recovering from illness.  It was during that time that we discovered homeschooling and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my job is flexible and I work from home frequently.  Hubby works for himself.  And we just hired a nanny.  So we&#39;ve got the saftey of the kids covered (they are 9 and 12) and a lot of unschooling/parenting happens at night when we are home. <br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while I feel a sense of wackiness for having this set-up. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking for an un-schooling blogger who has combined all of this - full-time out-of-the-house work and un-schooling.  I&#39;d like to read about their experiences and thoughts and feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m an almost full-time at-home working, unschooling mom - and I abandoned my blog because I didn&#39;t have time to keep it up! It was less about the mechanics of our lives than my inner thoughts, anyway - but I&#39;m imagining such a blog would be very, very hard to find! Unless there&#39;s some type-A, needs-little-sleep working unschooling parent out there...<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484635615">I gave up blogging when I went to work full time, but here are some links to other blogs - all of these folks do some kind of work-for-pay besides parenting, some at home, some not, some single, some with partners, some dads, too, some updated more often than others;) If you&#39;re looking for organizational tips, none of them may be very helpful, but they&#39;re all good reads, often inspiring, thoughtful and full of life:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698131499">I have to say that when I was working I couldn&#39;t keep up my blog either. I<br/>
wrote a blog post about my experiences as a working unschooling mama but it<br/>
was just one post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965849475">I&#39;ve been a full-time working mom before and after switching to unschooling.  I have also blogged about our journey for about four years now.  I can&#39;t say it&#39;s necessarily great reading, nor posted on a daily of weekly schedule, but it&#39;s there if you would like to take a peek into our world.  I don&#39;t mention work (at least I I don&#39;t think I do) as both my spouse and I, don&#39;t have jobs that would appreciate being mentioned.  <br/>
