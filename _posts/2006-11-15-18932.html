<div id="ygrps-yiv-156145720">We have some very sad news to share. I am posting this to several groups,  <br/>
and I hope you&#39;ll be patient with me. <br/>
As many of you know, our family began the process to adopt a child last  <br/>
January. After the required classes and home study, we had a little girl named  <br/>
Jackie, who is 5, placed with our family in July.  She attended the Live and <br/>
Learn conference with us in  Albuquerque. <br/>
We have had many struggles with Social Services, not getting much support  or <br/>
information. And we have discovered that  Jackie has many, many problems, <br/>
including  significant mental illness. She has many needs that we are not <br/>
equipped to  handle. Many of these should have been obvious to the professionals when <br/>
we were  matched, but our home study was essentially ignored, as the social <br/>
workers chose  us for Jackie for very bad reasons. We have found  that the <br/>
things that are best about Beth and I  as parents are the hardest  things for <br/>
Jackie. <br/>
Beth and I, with  Julian, have agonized over this decision and  tried very <br/>
hard to make this work. We are not going to continue with the  placement, and we <br/>
are working with our caseworkers to ensure that  DSS does not fail  Jackie <br/>
again. We love her very, very much, and we  are heartbroken that for our family <br/>
and for  Jackie, it is best for us to not parent  her. <br/>
Jackie  will be moving tomorrow to a specialized foster home to help <br/>
stabilize her and  hopefully prepare her for a permanent home. The hope is that they <br/>
will be able  to avoid residential treatment. <br/>
We are very sad about this, but we are also very clear that it is the  right <br/>
decision for us and for Jackie. I just  wanted to let people know. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095310743">So sorry to hear this.  I have to say I completely understand.  I&#39;ve been through it, more than once.  Hubby and I were foster parents for 5 years.  We adopted two of our foster children.  One of which has problems and issues.  We will be having her evaluated once again to try and get to the bottom of what those issues are, but she comes from two mentally ill birth parents.  I know the heart break of having a child leave that the whole family has become attached to, and it&#39;s a pain that I can not even begin to describe.  We also had a child placed with us that was a bad placement, and we were not informed prior about this little boys mental illness issues.  We could not keep him, because he was harming our other children that were much smaller than him.  The system is seriously in trouble.  I hear stories like yours all the time where people are not told critical information.  I&#39;m sorry this happened to your family.  I wish you all the best, and I wish little Jackie the<br/>
 best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095820449">My heart goes out to you, to your family and to Jackie.  I really believe <br/>
you are doing the absolute best thing.<br/>
<br/>
A dear friend of mine had her family very nearly destroyed by adopting a <br/>
girl who they&#39;d had off and on for years through the foster parent system. <br/>
She too had serious mental health issues which worsened as she went through <br/>
puberty.  The girl is no longer in their home, but is safe and in treatment. <br/>
But by adopting her, they are completely responsible for her until she is an <br/>
adult.  It is incredibly difficult, emotionally, physically and financially, <br/>
and heart-wrenching for the family and all of us who love them dearly.  I am <br/>
glad that you were able to make the right call for your family and for <br/>
Jackie before it went any farther.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll light a candle of peace and calming for you this evening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913019261">Oh, Kathryn & Beth, I am so sorry.  I can not even imagine how you all must be feeling.  I really enjoyed meeting Jackie.  I still have the picture she colored for me pinned to the wall in my bedroom, and think of her sweet spirit every time I see it. <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope whatever powers that be in this situation are able to find the best placement for Jackie, to best provide for her life and well being.  I know she&#39;ll be blessed by your love for her, even tho your home isn&#39;t the right one for her.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll be thinking of you all.<br/>
