I&#39;d love to see more of this: unschooled teens and young adults giving <br/>
us their perspectives! About school and other things.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron and Brenna will both be speaking at the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference in September. I can&#39;t wait to hear their stories!<br/>

as year as a freshman in public school.~~<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you that don&#39;t know, Kevin is my sweet nephew!:) My<br/>
sis Heidi doesn&#39;t post at lists often but they are radical unschoolers<br/>
living in Alaska. They ARE at the new Radical Unschoolers Network I<br/>
mentioned in a previous post and there are several unschooled kids and<br/>
teens there. They even started an &quot;RU youth&quot; group there.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some blogposts about when Kevin and family were visiting a<br/>
couple years ago (they spent a long time RV&#39;ing through the country).<br/>
One of the pics is when Kelly and her crew were here at the same time.<br/>
Kevin was inside on the computer so he isn&#39;t in the group pic!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there&#39;s a score for trust and freedom. The entire time they were<br/>
visiting (over a month) Kevin pretty much stayed on his computer and<br/>
did little else. Now he&#39;s a bubbling swirl of activity!<br/>

Easter with them:<br/>

<br/>
They were actually here at the house the day that People magazine had<br/>
their photographer shooting us for the article. The kids were setting<br/>
up &quot;stores&quot; with weeds they picked and selling them to each other all<br/>
over our driveway. We had a good discussion with the photagrapher<br/>
about unschooling!<br/>

in Palmer...right down the road from where they live. <br/>
<br/>
Now you know of some unschoolers to visit if you go!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387747754">Oh, and I meant to add that the mountain behind Kevin is called<br/>
&quot;Pioneers peak&quot;. Here are some more photos of it: <br/>

I&#39;ve hiked the Butte but not Pioneers Peak. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a good climb.<br/>
