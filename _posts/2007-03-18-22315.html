<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055993304">Hello :-)<br/>
I was wondering if someone could give me some ideas? I&#39;m trying to <br/>
figure out activities or groups my daughter, age 11 could join. She <br/>
would enjoy spending time, chatting and doing things with friends <br/>
close to her own age and their are few in our area. <br/>
<br/>
At the moment she enjoys doing things on her computer, playing video <br/>
games, and anything to do with fairies. She also likes Winx Club and <br/>
Bratz. (did I spell that right?lol) I think she may also enjoy <br/>
something new. <br/>
<br/>
At the moment money is very tight, so joining an organization with <br/>
fees would be very difficult. <br/>
<br/>
We tried locating other homeschoolers, but the few I found meet at <br/>
times that we can&#39;t and most in the area are Not unschoolers. <br/>
Evenings are best for us due to work and the fact my daughter is a <br/>
natural night owl and is never awake before noon. <br/>
<br/>
I know she would really like a friend. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice or ideas would be very welcomed! :-) I hope everyone has a <br/>
wonderful day!</div>

We just started a YuGiOh! game day each week (well, each week that <br/>
we&#39;re in town!&lt;g&gt;). Tuesday from 12:00-4:00, I supply snacks and drinks <br/>
for any kids who want to play card games (YuGi, Pokemon, Magic the <br/>
Gathering, Naruto). We had two boys show up last time. We&#39;ll see who <br/>
comes this Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout a Tuesday Tea Party from 2:00-6:00? You could do *anything* <br/>
during a Tea Party! &lt;G&gt; Make tea and cookies. Card games, dolls,---give <br/>
it a faery theme.  Picnic if it&#39;s pretty!<br/>
<br/>
Or a Wednesday Movie Night? Announce the movie you&#39;ve chosen. Supply <br/>
popcorn, some &quot;movie candy&quot; from the dollar store, and drinks. Gives <br/>
the other parents their *own* movie time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Artist Trading Card party---every Thursday. Bring what you have to <br/>
trade or make some. Supply a few crafty items (markers, crayon, paper, <br/>
glitter, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Dungeons and Dragons Saturdays. Find some dad who was the dungeon <br/>
master in high school. &lt;bwg&gt; Again, supply refreshments.<br/>
<br/>
If you build it, they will come. Maybe not in droves at first, but if <br/>
you put the announcement out there on all the homeschool lists, you&#39;ll <br/>
get responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228160255">How about joining a Girl Scout troop?  Just &quot;google&quot; Girl Scouts in <br/>
XXXX County (whatever county you are in).  We went through a couple <br/>
of troops before my older daughter found one she was comfortable <br/>
with.  You would have thought she would have wanted to be with <br/>
other &quot;homeschoolers&quot;, but her current troop actually has some girls <br/>
who &quot;swim&quot; like she does... on competitive swim teams.  So I would <br/>
say if you visit some local troops, maybe your daughter will find a <br/>
troop with some girls who share some of her passions.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
that the &quot;unschooling&quot; is that important when it comes to making <br/>
friends as it is to find others who enjoy the same things you do.<br/>
<br/>
Although GS troops do charge a fee (ours is $5 a month & $10 annual <br/>
registration), they can&#39;t force you to purchase a uniform (recommend <br/>
but not required).  Our service area also has &quot;loaners&quot; for those <br/>
who don&#39;t want or can&#39;t buy a uniform.  As I mentioned there is <br/>
usually a troop dues amount, but if you have a financial hardship, <br/>
they should be able to waive this fee.  I know that we are <br/>
encouraged to sponsor and give for this purpose; and it is nice to <br/>
know that there are girls out there who are using these funds that <br/>
would not have the chance to join otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and your daughter!<br/>
