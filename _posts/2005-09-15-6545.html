<div id="ygrps-yiv-998728384">I have received notice of a HUGE number of new members to this list in the last few days!<br/>
 <br/>
Any of you want to introduce yourselves ? Or maybe tell us how you found us? &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
The list is particularly quiet right now. I&#39;m busy with the conference, Ren&#39;s computer&#39;s dead, Rue&#39;s busy filling orders for her brand new book: _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooling Life_, and Deb&#39;s been camping in the wilds of Montana! &lt;G&gt; I don&#39;t know about the rest of you! <br/>
 <br/>
But it *has* been quieter than usual.<br/>
 <br/>
Just to let many of you know: the list will be even quieter that first week in October when many of us will descend on the St Louis area for the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference. But the list activity will pick up a LOT after that!<br/>
 <br/>
Any questions? Concerns?<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re all ears...or ...eyes? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894042313">Hello!  I&#39;m new to the list, but not new to unschooling.  That I&#39;ve been doing since, oh, I guess May 24, 2001.  However, it has been a long journey coming to understand unschooling and have faith in it, a journey I&#39;m still just beginning in some ways.  Funny, because my biggest concern about it was in the area of academics at first, but now I have become quite convinced it works for that, as my 4 year old is rapidly learning to read, choosing to read phonics readers whenever the urge strikes, and repeatedly asking me out of the blue to spell things for her and what 2 and 5 are...  I&#39;m continually amazed at how much she has learned despite my &quot;failure&quot; to plan and implement structured activities.  But, it always made sense to me that just like my children learned to walk and talk when they were ready, they&#39;d also eventually be ready to read, etc.  (oh, my second daughter is starting to put words together--so cute, and one of my favorite things, language acquisition!!)  It&#39;s the<br/>
 lifestyle of unschooling that I&#39;m struggling with more now.  Changing my automatic reactions, figuring out why my girls do what they do, learning how to work toward mutually satisfactory solutions...<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for letting me listen in and learn.  Will those who attend the conference next month share a bit with the group upon returning?<br/>

<br/>
Hi Kelly,<br/>
I am one of those new members. My name is Stacey.  I have four <br/>
kids.  dd 7, ds 5, ds 2, and ds 8 months. We are an American family <br/>
living in Saudi Arabia.  This is our first year fulltime <br/>
homeschooling. Right now we are using a curriculum, a school in a <br/>
box basically.  But I have serious doubts that this is right for my <br/>
dd.  She really resists her reading lessons. I like the curriculum <br/>
bc my work is done for me. I just look over each lesson the day <br/>
before and get the things ready that I need. And the lesson manual <br/>
tells me just what to do.  While this makes life easy for me... it <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel so right to me. I have read how many parents begin <br/>
homeschooling by using a curriculum. And then they figure out that <br/>
it doesn&#39;t work for them and they turn to unschooling.  I like that <br/>
idea but I am not there yet.  Unschooling sounds like the answer to <br/>
me... I just don&#39;t know what we&#39;d do. Does that make sense? Everyone <br/>
answers that question (what do we do?) by saying &quot;whatever we <br/>
want.&quot;  etc.  But then I wonder how will my kids learn math and <br/>
reading and other subjects.  I can understand that concept for <br/>
science.  But math?  Ok, adding, subtracting, counting, yet. But how <br/>
would algebra be taught or calculus?  I have _The Homeschooling <br/>
Answer Book_ by Linda Dobson and loved it when I read it. I have <br/>
just recently begun t look through it again. One person in the books <br/>
said something great that really opened my eyes.  Pat Montgomery <br/>
said, &quot;Many homes-educating  parents bite the bait.  They accept the <br/>
myth that educating is about curriculum, textbooks, tests, and <br/>
lesson plans, the trappings of institutional schools.  I submit that <br/>
the design of a child&#39;s education out to be about the child. What <br/>
are his interests?  Her needs?  His capabilities?  Parents are not <br/>
bound by the constricts of schools, which deal with such large <br/>
number of students they find it easier to teach to the average <br/>
students.&quot;  That really struck me. I so want to have my kids learn <br/>
what they want. But for some reason I can&#39;t get it together. With 4 <br/>
kids I often feel really bogged down.  I tend to get stressed out so <br/>
easily and then my health is affected.  It just seems to me that a <br/>
curriculum is easier right now. <br/>
<br/>
I joined this list hoping you all could help me.  I hate fighting <br/>
with my dd about reading.  I took her out of school bc she was <br/>
unhappy. But how is this any better? I feel really torn.  <br/>
Additionally, I am super isolated. We live outside of a small town. <br/>
We don&#39;t get out that often bc my dh takes the car and we don&#39;t have <br/>
the selection of places we could go.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s enough for now. This intro has turned into a vent, a plea for <br/>
help, ideas.  It has gotten too long.  Thanks for reading this whole <br/>
thing.  I look forward to getting to know you all.<br/>

I know it might be hard to step back from what you&#39;re saying, but <br/>
I&#39;m reading this and thinking to myself &quot;she&#39;s bogged down, stressed <br/>
out and curriculum is EASIER!??&quot;<br/>
Read your own post again, it&#39;s full of answers. You&#39;re not <br/>
describing joyful living, peaceful learning or a family following <br/>
their passions. You&#39;re describing survival, tension and struggle <br/>
between yourself and your child.<br/>
Unschooling is the opposite of that.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel about putting the books away, forgetting that <br/>
curriculum ever existed and calling the next few months &quot;vacation&quot;?<br/>
Just go on an extended summer vacation...rent movies you love, seek <br/>
out fun places to visit in your town, take long walks and picnics, <br/>
watch the stars at night, go swimming, roast marshmallows and drink <br/>
rootbeer floats, create clay sculptures, tell jokes, play silly <br/>
games in the dark, build forts and hide in them, paint pictures, <br/>
take photos, tell stories about your childhood...in short, treat <br/>
life like it&#39;s a TREASURE, because it IS.<br/>
<br/>
Seek out joy first and foremost, put relationships above learning <br/>
and just see what happens. The magic unschooling fairy just waved <br/>
her wand and gave you &quot;time off&quot; from schooling without your <br/>
children &quot;falling behind&quot;.<br/>
So go for it. Your heart is screaming at you, your beautiful <br/>
children are pointing the way. So stop listening to all those years <br/>
of school training and listen to your hearts voice, just listen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From algebra or calculus books, of course :) But the<br/>
real question is - is the kid interested in algebra or<br/>
calculus? When she has a need for it, she&#39;ll be able<br/>
to pick up a book and learn from it. I am an engineer<br/>
and I&#39;ve studied years and years of math including<br/>
several years of calculus. Yet when a friend&#39;s kid was<br/>
learning quadratic equations in school and wanted to<br/>
know where they&#39;re used, I could not come up with any<br/>
use for them.<br/>
<br/>
Also remember that algebra doesn&#39;t start till middle<br/>
school and calculus till high school or so. Don&#39;t let<br/>
the worry of something that&#39;s years away kill the joy<br/>
of today.<br/>

ANy member should be able to access the archives.<br/>
 <br/>
You can look at past months and see the regular activity level. We&#39;re quieter than some of the other unschooling e-lists for sure! And that can be a *good* thing! But usua;;y we&#39;re more active than *this*!<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re expecting some serious discussion, please consider reading the list&#39;s archives. You can also find great unschooling essays at these three places---and I&#39;ll let some link fairy come and post them for you conveniently in one place:<br/>
 <br/>
www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>
 <br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s excellent new site (nice to know you&#39;ve just been *busy* Joyce---I was worried about you! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Pam Sorooshian&#39;s Hightlights e-list for those who like &quot;The Best Of&quot;/&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Danielle Conger&#39;s blog site<br/>
 <br/>
Again, some clever person with a computer that W-O-R-K-S will come by and fill in those addresses. But they can keep you *very* busy until we&#39;re all back on track here!<br/>
 <br/>
Please feel free to post. Others will pipe up and throw in their two cents!<br/>

<br/>
I suppose it was easier for me because I first learned of unschooling when my oldest daughter was only 2 years old.  I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it for older kids (back then), but it made complete sense to me for toddlers and preschoolers. Little kids are learning machines.  Language acquisition, for one thing, is so amazing!  Look at what they do when they&#39;re so little, picking up the complexities of language, and all they need is other people talking with them.  I just spent time playing and talking with my girls and watched them learn despite my sparse follow through on structured pre-planned activities.  Now Rhiannon is self-motivated to learn to read and figure out how adding and subtracting works, and how the world works in general, naturally.  And since she is only 4 and there&#39;s no rush it has been easy to relax and watch her and wait to be asked for help rather than trying to actively teach her.  I&#39;m lucky, really, that I have discovered unschooling so early, so I can see it<br/>
 working, naturally, at such a young age before academics seem more &quot;serious.&quot;  Not sure I&#39;m being clear, sorry.  It&#39;s late, I&#39;m getting sleepy.  Feel free to ask me to explain better.<br/>

Wow!  This is awesome!  I&#39;ve visited Sandra Dodd&#39;s website many times over the last couple of years, but this one is totally new to me!  And I thought I was about to shut down the computer and go to bed!  Silly me!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032466248">I only have a minute---too many other things to tend to! And I want to respond to your longer post; I will later.<br/>
 <br/>
But there are a couple of unschooling moms who have lost children who will quickly tell you that the body of knowledge you child knows is NOTHING compared to the amount of love and joy that *you*, the MOM, allow into your lives. <br/>
 <br/>
If you live your lives as if this were your last day/week/month/year with your children...REALLY live that way---pursuing their passions, their dreams, their loves---THAT&#39;s unschooling!<br/>
 <br/>
We can *almost* guarantee that a life lived with passion and delight and joy will result in an &quot;educated&quot; adult.<br/>
 <br/>
Wake up every morning and pretend that today is the last day you have with those beautiful children. Still want to cram math facts into those darling heads??? Go to the park! Count the robins! See how much of a head-start they need in order to arrive at the finish at the same time as you. Buy ice cream cones---add toppings.<br/>
 <br/>
We can&#39;t guarantee our children will be here tomorrow. We CAN give them sweet, joyful lives for as long as they are in our care. And all that will lead to their wanting to know more and do more and BE more!<br/>
 <br/>
Cramming facts can&#39;t do that!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
 <br/>
So true, Kelly.<br/>
 <br/>
My suggestion is to spend some time thinking about *knowledge* in the form  <br/>
of learned facts.  Have you read much on how people learn?  My  favorite book <br/>
right now is the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank  Smith.<br/>
 <br/>
Some random questions to get you started thinking and have fun with:  <br/>
 <br/>
- What do I want for my children to be as adults?  Happy?   Content?  Harvard <br/>
graduate?<br/>
Why?  <br/>
 <br/>
- How do I give them what they need to be that?<br/>
 <br/>
- Would I truly care if my child was the most joyful person on Earth, but  <br/>
only a fry cook at McDonald&#39;s? (Most people tell me they do care very much that  <br/>
their kid is &quot;only&quot; something or other....and those kids are not radically  <br/>
unschooled).  If that is the case, is that serving the child&#39;s needs or my  <br/>
own?  Is that OK with me?<br/>
 <br/>
- What is more important, to be someone that is knowledgeable about  facts or <br/>
to be someone who is eager and able to learn?  How might you  help someone be <br/>
eager?<br/>
 <br/>
- Are facts really necessary in the technological age?  (Hint: we  don&#39;t even <br/>
have to leave our homes anymore to get most necessary  information.....and <br/>
much of it is instantaneous)<br/>
 <br/>
- How do you learn about a new hobby?  By learning everything  about it <br/>
before you attempt it, or by learning as you go along?  <br/>
 <br/>
- If you had a whole year to do anything you wanted (and all of your basic  <br/>
needs were taken care of....food, shelter, cleaning), what would you do?   <br/>
Note:  at first you might do things you normally didn&#39;t get a chance to  like read <br/>
non-stop or watch movies non-stop or a favorite hobby non-stop.   But that <br/>
would get boring after awhile.  You would eventually get tuned in  to your own <br/>
rhythms and would have times when you wanted to be around people and  others <br/>
when you wanted to be alone.   Times when you wanted to work  and accomplish <br/>
things, times when you wanted to just chill out.  Times when  you had so many <br/>
thoughts you wanted to organize them on paper, times when you  just wanted to be <br/>
still.  You might pick up a new hobby to give it a try,  you might finish a <br/>
project or leave it until later.  If you truly honored  these rhythms, don&#39;t you <br/>
think you would be content?  Isn&#39;t everything the  best use of your time and <br/>
your brain?<br/>
 <br/>
- What will the future be like?  Will my child need the same skills  and <br/>
facts I do?<br/>
 <br/>
- Could a child who has been given the gift of using his time and brain  <br/>
exactly how it feels the best have not a &quot;well-trained mind&quot; but a &quot;well-used  <br/>
mind&quot;?  Wouldn&#39;t the &quot;well-used mind&quot; have amassed plenty of factual  knowledge, <br/>
too?<br/>
 <br/>
- What if the &quot;well-trained mind&quot; has no use in the future because what it  <br/>
has been trained in has become useless?<br/>
 <br/>
- Could a &quot;well-used mind&quot; continue to adapt to changing  circumstances?  <br/>
Could it become a &quot;useful mind&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
- What if to that &quot;well-used mind&quot; you added your love and joy and  interest <br/>
and support?  The gift to your child is also that he *knows*  he is loved and <br/>
cared for and his ideas are valid and important.  What  sort of person will <br/>
that child grow up to be?  <br/>
 <br/>
Have a joy filled day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990792754">&quot;I feel like if we try an extended summer <br/>
vacation... we will miss things, get behind&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re missing them most important things right now. What do you <br/>
have to lose?  It sounds like you realize that the whole &quot;get <br/>
behind&quot; thing is just brainwashing, so maybe it will be easier for <br/>
you to let go of that?<br/>
Are you &quot;behind&quot; me if you don&#39;t know about the things I do? Is <br/>
anyone &quot;behind&quot; anyone else in real life, just because they know and <br/>
DO different things? <br/>
I can tell you exactly how to can peaches, pears and tomatoes, but <br/>
don&#39;t ask me how to bake a perfect Baklava, &#39;cuz I wouldn&#39;t know!<br/>
I can paint, draw reasonably well, create altered books, sculpt, <br/>
collage and figure out almost anything related to art...but if you <br/>
want to know how to fix your computer or car, you better call <br/>
somebody else!<br/>
Am I &quot;behind&quot; because I can&#39;t tell you how to fix your engine? Or is <br/>
the rest of the world &quot;behind&quot; me because I can paint a face that <br/>
looks ready for a magazine and the average citizen doesn&#39;t even know <br/>
how to apply eyeshadow?:)<br/>
<br/>
As adults, it is accepted and normal for everyone to have different <br/>
knowledge, different skills and abilities. That&#39;s called diversity <br/>
and it&#39;s a GOOD thing! But children are held to a different <br/>
standard. They&#39;re ALL supposed to know the same things at the same <br/>
time...what a CROCK!<br/>
That isn&#39;t how human beings work. We aren&#39;t MEANT to know the same <br/>
things...ever. If a topic is useful, your children will learn it <br/>
when they need it.<br/>
You can learn algebra when you&#39;re 50, much better and with greater <br/>
ease if you need it, than trying to force yourself to learn it <br/>
before you need it at 15. People only need the information they need <br/>
for NOW. If they need it in the future, they should learn it in the <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
You are faced with a choice today. You can continue missing out on <br/>
the most important things in life...joy, peace, connectedness, <br/>
relationships, passion, interest and love for learning. You can miss <br/>
those things and continue trying to force the unimportant <br/>
things....the world falsely divided into subjects like math, <br/>
geography, science etc...<br/>
You can miss all the wonderful connections that real learning <br/>
offers, with no subject topics dividing your learning, or you can <br/>
continue to unhappily push towards some kind of academic success.<br/>
<br/>
What do you fear if you let go?<br/>
What is the very WORST thing that can happen if you unschool?<br/>
<br/>
What if your children learn NOTHING for the next ten years (not <br/>
possible, but let&#39;s run with that) and they only gain self-<br/>
confidence and joy?  Heck, anyone that has a love of learning and <br/>
loads of self-confidence can teach themselves ANYTHING at any time <br/>
in their lives.<br/>
So load them up with joy and love, the rest will be in their hands. <br/>
Try to NOT learn anything, focus on what really matters in life.<br/>
<br/>
If your child died tomorrow, what would matter more today? Reading, <br/>
math and social studies? Or a life lived fully for RIGHT NOW?<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your pearls of wisdom.  I&#39;m also new to unschooling and <br/>
worry about if my dd (11yo) is learning anything knew.  But then I&#39;m <br/>
reminded by people like yourself on this site that our children are <br/>
learning, that it is part of life.  My dd knows how to read, do <br/>
general math and knows how to research things when she wants to know <br/>
something.  <br/>
<br/>
I have friends who are homeschooling and they are worried that they <br/>
are not teaching according to the scope and sequence here in CA.  I <br/>
just shake my head and smile!  I also noticed that some of these <br/>
mothers are beginning to look burned out as I was last year.  I guess <br/>
it&#39;s time to start sharing my new freedom.<br/>

<br/>
How much of a foreign language did you learn by sitting in a class  <br/>
for 2 years?<br/>

isn&#39;t used. So for all the months spent being taught in a year or two  <br/>
it&#39;s mostly gone. So what is gained?<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of schooling is that from the outside it *looks* like  <br/>
learning is happening. It&#39;s like a coat of whitewash on a rotted fence.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has anyone else had a hard time with this or is it just me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most everyone. Quieting the voices, getting rid of the scripts in our  <br/>
heads is probably one of the hardest things. We spend most of our  <br/>
lives hearing that we need to do well in school in order to succeed.  <br/>
Even in the midst of school when what we&#39;re learning doesn&#39;t seem to  <br/>
have any relevance we *have* to believe school is the best way to be  <br/>
successful in the future or all the torture we&#39;re going through is  <br/>
all for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how does one ignore those years of school training?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By reading about unschoolers and about unschooling. By recognizing  <br/>
that the thoughts are wrong even when they keep popping up. By  <br/>
letting the kids unschool while you bite your tongue :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i do feel<br/>
&gt; that is important, but how much will they learn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The learning is not going to look like kids doing school on their  <br/>
own. It&#39;s going to look like playing.<br/>
<br/>
What did learning English look like?<br/>

Welcome Stacey!<br/>
We&#39;re new to homeschooling too, dd just finished 6th grade and she&#39;s <br/>
deschooling big time.   I researched homeschooling starting over 2 <br/>
years ago, then found unschooling.  I remember I first thought &quot;no <br/>
way!  That sounds WAY to loose for me!&quot;.  I kept reading (have you read <br/>
any John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, there are others) and kept coming <br/>
BACK to unschooling.  Something about it resonated with me.   And, more <br/>
importantly, what made more sense to me was what I was reading about <br/>
education.   I&#39;ve always been interested in learning styles (this has <br/>
been the issue with my dd and the cause of her &quot;problems&quot; in school - <br/>
they felt she was &quot;broken&quot; and needed to be fixed - that&#39;s a very <br/>
simplistic explanation, I won&#39;t go into our story right now, I may have <br/>
posted it here when I first joined, I&#39;ll have to see what I wrote).<br/>
<br/>
Children learn things at very different paces, so if they&#39;re not ready <br/>
to &quot;learn&quot; whatever the schools say they SHOULD be learning in grade 3 <br/>
or whatever, so what!  Does that mean they&#39;ve failed?   And also, <br/>
something I never thought about before, WHY do children need to &quot;learn&quot; <br/>
the things listed for each grade in that particular year?   Think about <br/>
it - try to get away from &quot;thinking like the masses&quot; JUST BECAUSE it&#39;s <br/>
always been that way, think more about, what&#39;s REALLY important to know <br/>
(and it will vary for each child).   Yes, it&#39;s good to be able to read, <br/>
write somewhat (or type, computers/internet), do some basic math <br/>
(balance a checkbook someday or budget your money, make change), but <br/>
beyond that, how much do YOU remember of what was &quot;taught&quot; to you in <br/>
school?  Algebra?  Shakespeare?  Table of elements in chem?  <br/>
<br/>
I happen to LOVE math, and both my dd and dh ABHOR it!  I love to read <br/>
for pleasure, neither of them do.  But I KNOW my daughter can read, she <br/>
has a wonderful vocabulary because we talk, discuss thoughts and <br/>
ideas.  Not all learning occurs in a book, nor does it occur in <br/>
school.   We&#39;re learning all the time, life long learning, it should <br/>
never stop!  It should be a JOY to learn about new things, not hated <br/>
because we&#39;re forced to learn something either we&#39;re not interested in <br/>
or not ready for (but maybe it will be something we would have <br/>
discovered on our own if allowed to at our own pace).<br/>
<br/>
It IS hard to change our perception of what true learning is!  You <br/>
can&#39;t, nor should you, ignore your own experience of what &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
is.  It IS hard for many people who have not unschooled from the <br/>
beginning to &quot;get it&quot; (can you see me raising my hand!  me too! me <br/>
too!).   Read, read, and read some more about unschooling (check under <br/>
the Links part of this group for book recommendations, websites, etc).  <br/>
Some people may even post their favorite book or website, the ONE that <br/>
did it for them.  For me, it was &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; by John Taylor <br/>
Gatto.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>
/0865714487/qid=1126898108/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9013486-3932159?<br/>
v=glance&s=books&n=507846   There are MANY more (we moved a while back <br/>
and my books are still in boxes so I can&#39;t just glance over at my <br/>
bookcase to see what they are, but I&#39;m going to make a list for <br/>
sharing).  <br/>
<br/>
Ask questions, read the archives here, try to be open to a new way of <br/>
thinking.  You WILL sometimes feel like you&#39;re being challenged, and <br/>
you are! &lt;grin&gt; but it&#39;s meant to help, to get you to think outside <br/>
your own box and way of viewing &quot;school&quot;.  I had the same reactions in <br/>
the beginning, but I slowed down and took time to absorb what was being <br/>
said to me and truly realized that the people on this site WANT to <br/>
help, they&#39;re really good at getting to the heart of what they &quot;hear&quot; <br/>
you saying as opposed to what you &quot;think&quot; you&#39;re saying (if that makes <br/>
sense!).<br/>
<br/>
So, I wanted to chime in as a newbie who&#39;s getting it but also <br/>
struggled with &quot;letting go&quot; of the &quot;traditional&quot; way of viewing <br/>
education, school and learning.   I&#39;m so grateful for the wisdom of the <br/>
people on this group.   I hope you will grow as you read, question, <br/>
listen, experience the joy that unschooling can bring to your life.<br/>

What an emotional post. That you for those reminders.  And how right <br/>
you are.  I have a friend who lost two daughters two days apart and <br/>
I am sure she would say you are right on.  It actually brought tears <br/>
to my eyes to read.<br/>

&gt; I only have a minute---too many other things to tend to! And I <br/>
want to respond to your longer post; I will later.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But there are a couple of unschooling moms who have lost children <br/>
who will quickly tell you that the body of knowledge you child knows <br/>
is NOTHING compared to the amount of love and joy that *you*, the <br/>
MOM, allow into your lives. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If you live your lives as if this were your last <br/>
day/week/month/year with your children...REALLY live that way---<br/>
pursuing their passions, their dreams, their loves---THAT&#39;s <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We can *almost* guarantee that a life lived with passion and <br/>
delight and joy will result in an &quot;educated&quot; adult.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Wake up every morning and pretend that today is the last day you <br/>
have with those beautiful children. Still want to cram math facts <br/>
into those darling heads??? Go to the park! Count the robins! See <br/>
how much of a head-start they need in order to arrive at the finish <br/>
at the same time as you. Buy ice cream cones---add toppings.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We can&#39;t guarantee our children will be here tomorrow. We CAN give <br/>
them sweet, joyful lives for as long as they are in our care. And <br/>
all that will lead to their wanting to know more and do more and BE <br/>
more!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Cramming facts can&#39;t do that!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***********<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So true, Kelly.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My suggestion is to spend some time thinking about *knowledge* in <br/>
the form  <br/>
&gt; of learned facts.  Have you read much on how people learn?  My  <br/>
favorite book <br/>
&gt; right now is the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank  Smith.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Some random questions to get you started thinking and have fun <br/>
with:  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - What do I want for my children to be as adults?  Happy?   <br/>
Content?  Harvard <br/>
&gt; graduate?<br/>
&gt; Why?  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - How do I give them what they need to be that?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - Would I truly care if my child was the most joyful person on <br/>
Earth, but  <br/>
&gt; only a fry cook at McDonald&#39;s? (Most people tell me they do care <br/>
very much that  <br/>
&gt; their kid is &quot;only&quot; something or other....and those kids are not <br/>
radically  <br/>
&gt; unschooled).  If that is the case, is that serving the child&#39;s <br/>
needs or my  <br/>
&gt; own?  Is that OK with me?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - What is more important, to be someone that is knowledgeable <br/>
about  facts or <br/>
&gt; to be someone who is eager and able to learn?  How might you  help <br/>
someone be <br/>
&gt; eager?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - Are facts really necessary in the technological age?  (Hint: we  <br/>
don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; have to leave our homes anymore to get most necessary  <br/>
information.....and <br/>
&gt; much of it is instantaneous)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - How do you learn about a new hobby?  By learning everything  <br/>
about it <br/>
&gt; before you attempt it, or by learning as you go along?  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - If you had a whole year to do anything you wanted (and all of <br/>
your basic  <br/>
&gt; needs were taken care of....food, shelter, cleaning), what would <br/>
you do?   <br/>
&gt; Note:  at first you might do things you normally didn&#39;t get a <br/>
chance to  like read <br/>
&gt; non-stop or watch movies non-stop or a favorite hobby non-stop.   <br/>
But that <br/>
&gt; would get boring after awhile.  You would eventually get tuned in  <br/>
to your own <br/>
&gt; rhythms and would have times when you wanted to be around people <br/>
and  others <br/>
&gt; when you wanted to be alone.   Times when you wanted to work  and <br/>
accomplish <br/>
&gt; things, times when you wanted to just chill out.  Times when  you <br/>
had so many <br/>
&gt; thoughts you wanted to organize them on paper, times when you  <br/>
just wanted to be <br/>
&gt; still.  You might pick up a new hobby to give it a try,  you might <br/>
finish a <br/>
&gt; project or leave it until later.  If you truly honored  these <br/>
rhythms, don&#39;t you <br/>
&gt; think you would be content?  Isn&#39;t everything the  best use of <br/>
your time and <br/>
&gt; your brain?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - What will the future be like?  Will my child need the same <br/>
skills  and <br/>
&gt; facts I do?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - Could a child who has been given the gift of using his time and <br/>
brain  <br/>
&gt; exactly how it feels the best have not a &quot;well-trained mind&quot; but <br/>
a &quot;well-used  <br/>
&gt; mind&quot;?  Wouldn&#39;t the &quot;well-used mind&quot; have amassed plenty of <br/>
factual  knowledge, <br/>
&gt; too?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - What if the &quot;well-trained mind&quot; has no use in the future because <br/>
what it  <br/>
&gt; has been trained in has become useless?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - Could a &quot;well-used mind&quot; continue to adapt to changing  <br/>
circumstances?  <br/>
&gt; Could it become a &quot;useful mind&quot;?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; - What if to that &quot;well-used mind&quot; you added your love and joy <br/>
and  interest <br/>
&gt; and support?  The gift to your child is also that he *knows*  he <br/>
is loved and <br/>
&gt; cared for and his ideas are valid and important.  What  sort of <br/>
person will <br/>
&gt; that child grow up to be?  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Have a joy filled day!<br/>
