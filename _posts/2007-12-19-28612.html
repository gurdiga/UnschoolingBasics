<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351202864">Does anyone here know where all of the politically-minded unschoolers<br/>
are meeting... to discuss, dissect, analyze, feed off of each other,<br/>
etc., on the topic of candidates? (Assuming there is such a place?)<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I&#39;ve ever *really* gotten into any of the<br/>
candidates, and I&#39;d love to express and also try on different views of<br/>
other critical thinkers this time around...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
