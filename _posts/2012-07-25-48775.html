<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127591641">Things are kind of slow right now so I thought I&#39;d send out a general welcome to folks new to the list and toss out some links. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good place to start if you&#39;re new to whole life unschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
<br/>
A good, basic piece of advice is to Ease In so I&#39;ll add this link, too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>
<br/>
Another really fantastic website for learning about unschooling is here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
And if you like blogs, my personal favorite unschooling blog is The Blog of the Zombie Princess, in part because it&#39;s so well written and in part because it has a nice reference page here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1">https://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1</a><br/>
<br/>
For the most part, this list is &quot;question driven&quot; so feel free to ask questions about learning and how whole life unschooling works in real life! Since parenting and learning are issues close to our hearts, it can be unsettling to post a question and have the details pulled apart for analysis - which Will happen! so if that&#39;s likely to push your buttons, feel free to ask me or one of the list moderators to post your questions anonymously. The replies can seem much more well-intentioned if you&#39;re not feeling &quot;on the spot&quot;!<br/>
