<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425807344">&quot;So, you talk about it openly and its not a fascination. But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they wont drink. Will you allow it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already &quot;allowed&quot; it.... My children know that I&#39;m not against <br/>
drinking, I have issues with irresponsible drinking. I trust them to <br/>
make their own decisions, I trust that will be the best decision for <br/>
their life. I also give them good information ahead of time if I see <br/>
something that might go wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest knows that I will gladly pick him up at any time of night, <br/>
from ANYWHERE, no questions asked. His closest friends are <br/>
unschoolers too....none of them think drinking is anything <br/>
fascinating. They don&#39;t care about being out late, they are up late <br/>
anytime they want. They don&#39;t crave getting away from their <br/>
families, they think their families are pretty awesome.<br/>
Many factors are affecting how these teens interact with their peers <br/>
and community. Far different from my own life.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that I can&#39;t allow or disallow anything...only create a <br/>
situation in which we have optimum communication and trust. He&#39;s <br/>
going to do things whether I allow it or not, he&#39;s 15!!<br/>
He has no reason to sneak or try anything harmful, his parents are <br/>
on his side.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say he won&#39;t do things I disagree with...that is a very real <br/>
possibility, but something I&#39;m prepared to accept and keep dialogue <br/>
open about.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he plays video games and listens to music I find very <br/>
disagreeable at times. But it all comes back to trust.<br/>
I see the violent video games and scratch my head, but then he joins <br/>
peace rallies and shows a depth of character and kindness that not <br/>
many at his age seem to possess and I know he&#39;s following his own <br/>
light.<br/>
<br/>
If he chooses to drink or have sex, he will be armed with good <br/>
information, parents that are available, more common sense than most <br/>
teens and the ability to know himself on a deep level.<br/>
That&#39;s going into it well armed....more than I ever had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238979054">Sounds like my parents Ren.  Only add to that I wasn&#39; t allowed to see my friends on a Sunday and I wasn&#39;t allowed to buy anything on a Sunday. I had to go to church 3 times a week. It just made me kick against their control.  I wouldn&#39;t be be seen dead in a church now.  I don&#39;t have any beliefs they have and I do the opposite with my children to what they did with me.<br/>

<br/>
My DS is only 7 but he already has seen the difference between when <br/>
(several relatives) are drunk and not. He has seen DH have a beer or <br/>
two at gatherings and stop at that while others continue on down the <br/>
boozy road (I rarely drink - a glass of wine puts me to sleep and I&#39;d <br/>
hate to miss out on stuff because I just wanted to curl up and take a <br/>
nap). By the time he&#39;s a teen, I am hoping that we&#39;ll have had many <br/>
opportunities to discuss this and more topics (smoking, drugs, sex, <br/>
etc) - he already knows he doesn&#39;t like the way grandma&#39;s house smells <br/>
when all the smokers are over there. We&#39;re not likely to &#39;ban&#39; alcohol <br/>
but neither are we going to hand him a beer to celebrate his 13th <br/>
birthday. Balance in all things<br/>

Let me add thsi to the conversation:<br/>
 I was born and raised in Brazil and my parents did allow us to drink very early on. They even gave us wine for luch like every Sunday when they had it. None of us four kids was ever a drinker or fascinated by it. We did it responsably as my parents did. None of us ever went binge drinking or just went out to get drunk. Drinking was normal and social. At this point  all of us siblings are still the same way.<br/>
I remenber drinking Amaretto, Port Wine and sweet liquor as early as 8 or 9 maybe even before that. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*********************<br/>
Kathy, I&#39;ve read all of your posts and what I&#39;m seeing is a lot of  <br/>
fear...but you&#39;re still here. Interesting. <br/>
 <br/>
I have a very-close-to-16 year old son who wants to be a rock star. We talk  <br/>
about things like drugs, alcohol, and sex a lot. We talk about why people <br/>
might  want to use or abuse any of those things. We talk about their use without <br/>
abuse.  We talk about concerns and consequences.<br/>
 <br/>
You asked &quot;whether they can sit at home and get  drunk?&quot;  What I&#39;m saying to <br/>
you is that it&#39;s the  wrong question. Here&#39;s an analogy, something I thought <br/>
of when I read your  post.<br/>
 <br/>
I am a Unitarian Universalist. It is a creedless  religion with no required <br/>
dogma, and UU&#39;s get challenged on this a lot. I read  this anecdote where <br/>
someone was challenging a UU and said, &quot;So you can rape and  murder or steal if you <br/>
want?&quot;  The UU&#39;s response was &quot;Is raping and  murdering and stealing what YOU <br/>
want to do?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Your question was whether it&#39;d be okay for my kid to  sit at home and get <br/>
drunk. I can&#39;t imagine why he would want to do that. People  tend to get drunk <br/>
either because they are in a festive situation with others and  find it <br/>
pleasant, or because they have a problem. People who &quot;sit at home and  get drunk&quot; <br/>
rarely do it as a hobby.<br/>
 <br/>
If Julian wanted, perhaps, to get drunk because he  wanted to know what it <br/>
felt like, I suppose he&#39;d be safer doing at home with  people who loved him. He <br/>
has no real desire to do that, partially I&#39;ve honestly  described my own only <br/>
experience with being drunk (&quot;It was sort of fun because  it felt silly and <br/>
uninhibited for a bit, but then I got really sick and it  really wasn&#39;t worth <br/>
it, for me, to try again.&quot;)  If he sincerely asked for  that, I don&#39;t know what <br/>
my response would be, but I&#39;d think about  it.<br/>
 <br/>
But again, it&#39;s NOT the right question, partly because  it&#39;s not really <br/>
likely to come up.<br/>
 <br/>
What I hear in your fear is &quot;Can I really say yes to my  children almost all <br/>
of the time and still have them turn out to be safe, happy,  prepared for <br/>
life, not a drain on society, etc. etc.?&quot; &quot;Can I spare the rod, the  time-out, the <br/>
packaged curriculum, the food restrictions, etc. and still have  them be <br/>
pleasant, healthy, good people?&quot; Maybe even, &quot;This all sounds wonderful  but it <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly work. Could it?!?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I can answer that question with a passionate YES! YES!  YES!<br/>
<br/>

I think Kathryn hit the nail on the head---why would they want to? I <br/>
don&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
About the tv:<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t have the *choice* to  turn it on or off, they can&#39;t make <br/>
the decision to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
We have three tvs. Cameron TiVos &quot;That 70s Show&quot; and will watch &quot;Whose <br/>
Line is it Anyway&quot; and music specials when he can. Movies every now and <br/>
then. Not much else---he&#39;s too busy with other things!<br/>
<br/>
For 18 months---TV was pretty much *ALL* he did---those months after <br/>
leaving school. He watched tv, ate, slept, talked on the phone, and <br/>
played on the computer. NOTHING ELSE. I&#39;m not joking. I was about to <br/>
rip my hair out.<br/>
<br/>
He was healing. Everyone just told me to hold out. Keep offering neat <br/>
things (which I did anyway with my younger son) and be willing to take <br/>
no for an answer. I can&#39;t tell you how hard it was.<br/>
<br/>
But it probably wouldn&#39;t have taken nearly as long if I had trusted <br/>
these people and not asked him to read to me or draw a picture  or <br/>
explained that packing the trunk was geometry! (I really did! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Can you trust us??? Can you trust your kids? They are brilliant, <br/>
interesting, passionate, kind people who haven&#39;t yet been allowed to be <br/>
themselves. With that gift, you can open their worlds----they&#39;ll become <br/>
more than you can possibly imagine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m dead serious. It happened here. Cameron is absolutely phenomenal!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have missed this (and many) conversations due to a<br/>
broken computer this week...but I would like to<br/>
question why it&#39;s such a big deal if your kids get<br/>
drunk?  We recently had a home brew fest at my<br/>
brother&#39;s house--my parents flew in from Atlanta with<br/>
their beers, my brother made his, my husband made his,<br/>
as well as about 15 of my brother&#39;s friends.  There<br/>
was also a house full of fun and merriment, and<br/>
gourmet food, and chatting, and picture taking, etc<br/>
etc etc.  One of my brother&#39;s friends thoughtfully<br/>
brought his pocket breathalaizer, and we all tested<br/>
ourselves, and most of us were found to be &quot;drunk&quot;. <br/>
Does this mean we were morally deranged, dangerous,<br/>
unthinking, or the like?  No, just that we tasted a<br/>
lot of beer.  There were designated drivers, and many<br/>
slept over.  My children were there and were certainly<br/>
offered beer as well as food, but they don&#39;t enjoy the<br/>
taste of but a few beers so they declined.  But I<br/>
would certainly not have found it a problem if they<br/>
had tried too many tasters and had found themselves<br/>
&quot;drunk&quot;...<br/>

Then send your kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to take this chance with my kids because I know deep down <br/>
that following one&#39;s passions is *right*.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see *any* redeeming qualities in school or school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
My relationship with my kids is my number one priority. Hands down.<br/>
<br/>
If I knew today were my last day with my child, would I send him to <br/>
school? Many people DO---children with cancers---they send those poor <br/>
kids to school. Hard to fathom. I&#39;d spend my child&#39;s last months or <br/>
weeks or days pursuing his passions. So why would I change that if I <br/>
knew he&#39;d live to be 95? Seriously? What&#39;s MOST important to you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031068759">&lt;&lt;If they drink, someday they are going to get drunk. Period&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may be right and to be honest, so what?  Lots of people occassionally over-do it.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you just sit around and get drunk all day?  You legally can.  Why don&#39;t you run around and have sex with anybody and everybody?  You legally can.  Nobody is stopping you from doing these things.  You can do them all day, everyday.  But instead you are on an email list trying to figure out what is a good path for your family.  You have a vision, a quest.  Why would you choose a positive path rather than a dead-end one?  When you can answer that for yourself, you will have the answer for your kids as well.<br/>

 <br/>
And you know that absolutely for sure -- that anyone who ever drinks will get drunk. Period.  <br/>
 <br/>
Okay, so big deal, they may get drunk someday.  When my child knows I won&#39;t punish him, shame him or think less of him for making the choice to drink (whether or not getting drunk was an actual choice) he&#39;s much safer than when he has to sneak around behind my back.  The same is true for sex and other potentially dangerous behaviors.  <br/>

It&#39;s equally possible you could be wrong.  Heck, we could all be wrong about any one of a thousand things every day.  Should we spend the rest of our lives safely locked in the house, never participating in anything that could result in injury?<br/>

school? Many people DO---children with cancers---they send those <br/>
poor kids to school. Hard to fathom. I&#39;d spend my child&#39;s last <br/>
months or weeks or days pursuing his passions. So why would I change <br/>
that if I knew he&#39;d live to be 95? Seriously? What&#39;s MOST important <br/>

Kelly,<br/>
Thank you so much for putting it this way!<br/>
This exact notion is what has totally sold my husband and me on <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What a waste of time and energy to spend your life doing anything <br/>
more than what you must of things you do not enjoy. <br/>
The world is just to full of opportunities for that.<br/>

What laws are ok to break? You can drink even though it is against the law. Is it OK to shop lift? Breaking the law is not ok<br/>

you&#39;re getting away with something. It interferes with too many things <br/>
(coordination for gaming, doing all sorts of physical activities, <br/>
being coherent when watching a movie, etc). Having a drink or two <br/>
(anywhere) with friends, conversation, food, etc. is very different <br/>
than a bunch of people sitting around with the intent of drinking a <br/>
lot and being, can&#39;t think of another word for it, flat<br/>
stupid.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I actually have been drunk.  I didn&#39;t like it.  It was an experience - I think most teens go through it and I think unless they have other problems decide it is not that cool to stagger about, feel sick/be sick, have a raging headache the next day and be told they did stupid things whilst under the influence.  None of my children are interested in drink despite the fact we always have beer in the house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115952242">Both of my girls have been drunk once each. Neither cares to ever repeat it.<br/>
I knew about both times, they don&#39;t keep many secrets from me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had plenty of opportunity, just never wanted to.  On the other hand,<br/>
both the girls have developed a taste for very good..very expensive beer.<br/>
My husband likes that kind of thing.  It&#39;s hard to get drunk when your beer<br/>
costs $6-8 each and you need to savor it. :-)<br/>

generally he&#39;ll get ONE if we go out to dinner and maybe have 2 when <br/>
we go to SIL&#39;s for a cookout - 2 over the course of 6 or 8 hours that <br/>
is (BIL also likes good beers).<br/>

   I do not htink it is ok to &quot;allow them to drink in your home. I see <br/>
it as you<br/>
are saying it is OK to break the law.  It is NOT ok to do drugs. What <br/>
laws are<br/>
ok to break? You can drink even though it is against the law. Is it OK <br/>
to shop<br/>
lift? Breaking the law is not ok<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem with a lot of laws. But that&#39;s another issue in and of <br/>
itself! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m not wild about laws that have to do with *me* and no <br/>
one else. I don&#39;t need protection from myself! Neither do my children. <br/>
Too much government!!!<br/>
<br/>
In SC it is only illegal for a minor (under 21) to *purchase* alcohol. <br/>
Nothing about consumption. I think it&#39;s smart to know your state laws!<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem allowing my children to drink in my home, and I&#39;ve <br/>
poured my son a glass of wine when at a restaurant. We&#39;re enophiles <br/>
here, so we encourage a basic knowledge of wines. And none of us is a <br/>
wino! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Open, honest communication. Know your laws. Be sure your children do <br/>
too. But you can lead their lives for them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670283872">In most (but not all) states, parents can legally provide their<br/>
underage children with alcoholic beverages in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
In most European countries, what we would consider underage children<br/>
are commonly served alcoholic drinks - e.g. wine in France and Italy,<br/>
beer in Germany.  America is comparatively prudish in this regard<br/>
compared to Europe.<br/>

No. I have thought about this cos I live in the UK and our country is under some pressure to conform to Europe where it is illegal in Germany to HS and the French have to follow a set curriculum. I woud fight it long and hard. Both any ban or the curriculum idea if tht comes in first. Moves are already a foot to regulate us. I spent considerable time battling with the authorities over unschooling - both mine and others as I am a contact for our county -even tho our HS laws are very lenient as they are now.<br/>
