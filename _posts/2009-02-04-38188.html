<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457334330">My eldest loves to draw.  He has been drawing recognizable faces since he was 16 months <br/>
old....He wants to take classes at the Art Institute or someplace like that....but he is only <br/>
13 and not a &quot;senior&quot;in high school...<br/>
<br/>
He did 8th grade through cyberschool last year, and would technically be in 9th grade this <br/>
year.  We tried talking with someone at the AI yesterday, but she seemed surprised that we <br/>
would want a 13 yr old to even think about taking classes.  He has been looking at things <br/>
online and is convinced this is the best bet for him.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do I go about helping him get this?  They won&#39;t consider finanacial aid until he is <br/>
17.  Regular Art classes for &quot;students&quot; are not what he wants, or needs.  He is looking for <br/>
something in 3D computer design as well as comic book, game art, etc.  It is frustrating <br/>
for both of us.  He feels a college not wanting to help him with his art potential at this age <br/>
means he isn&#39;t good enough an artist.  I know that isn&#39;t true, but you can&#39;t explain it that <br/>
way to him.  I hate that there is age discrimination inherent in the system....so what can I <br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a way to get him online help?  correspondence?  Or do we really <br/>
have to wait 4 or 5 years before anyone will accept him as a student?  There must be art <br/>
apprenticeships somewhere out there???<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any thoughts or ideas to help us, I would appreciate it.  I hate feeling like <br/>
you truly need to know somebody or kiss butt to gain access to what your child wants, no <br/>
matter their age.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43452169">Perhaps you could look into finding him a mentor or an apprenticeship with a comic book or graphic novel artist. Does he have an artist he admires or wants to learn from? Perhaps if you or he wrote them a letter with a sample of his work telling them the difficulty your having with getting him into a program they would have ideas to help you or be willing to take on the role of mentor? If there is one who is local even better. <br/>
<br/>
It is not exactly the art institute but it would be furthering his experience and education on the subject from people who are already doing what he wants too and have probably delt with some similar struggles.<br/>

Have y&#39;all read The Teen Liberation Handbook? I think part of the <br/>
problem is you&#39;re still thinking in terms of classes, even online <br/>
classes. <br/>
<br/>
Does he make his own comic books now? If so, look into how such <br/>
things come to be published. He could easily create his own &#39;zine. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a free programing resource that might be useful - it happens <br/>
to be a pilot program for a university course in 3D programming:<br/>

<br/>
You might also check with community colleges and see what they have, <br/>
both for programming and art. If he&#39;s interested in life drawing, for <br/>
instance, there are often independent groups of students who pool <br/>
resources to hire models and the college art department could point <br/>
you in that direction, let you know who&#39;s organizing the group, that <br/>
sort of thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183856973">My son is a graphics artist - he has never had an art class - he is <br/>
all self taught and self &quot;published&quot;. He was on a few forums for <br/>
artists - one is called Pixelation or something like that. Artists <br/>
draw things and critic either other&#39;s art and there are jobs posted <br/>
on occasion. For two years, when he was 16 - 18, he worked as an <br/>
artist for a cell phone game programmer in Israel (we live in MN) and <br/>
he was very happy with that. He has had a few other scattered jobs <br/>
here and there. He is all self taught. He has used MAYA and a few <br/>
other art programs that he purchased himself (or we bought for him) <br/>
and has used library resources. Look around - there are tons of <br/>
options out there besides &quot;classes&quot; at colleges. He&#39;s deciding now if <br/>
he wants to go ahead and attend college and get a degree in graphic <br/>
arts or maybe get a degree in business and use his self taught skills <br/>
as the &quot;artist education&quot;....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119607554">I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;regular art classes for students&quot; <br/>
exactly. If he wants to learn something specific, find a studio that <br/>
has classes to help him with that (if that&#39;s the way he wants to learn <br/>
it). Among other things, you might find that while the studio classes <br/>
don&#39;t really fit his style/need, he may find a mentor there who can <br/>
give him feedback and provide pointers and so on. Many studios have <br/>
open age group classes (anyone over 12, for example) - though life <br/>
drawing type classes might require you to stay in the room if they&#39;re <br/>
drawing nudes (then again he might not want to take that sort of class <br/>
just yet...) Another option might be to look for conventions related to <br/>
what he wants - I know there are huge comic/graphic novel related <br/>
conventions for example - where he can meet and hang with folks who are <br/>
doing the things he wants to be doing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332454322">I guess he saw the ads for the school downtown and near where my hubby works and <br/>
thought it would be fun.  But now that everyone is coming up with other options I think it <br/>
will be easier.  He has used Alice, so do my other kids...so that is cool.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596901480">We are planning to go to the local CON in April.  So that is a good thing.  I am going to see <br/>
what the companies he wants to work with expect from their applicants and go from there.   <br/>
He is really into the comic book character and role play/game design aspect.  I think that <br/>
is what he would like to do.  He prefers pen and pencil, but is really enjoying playing with <br/>
the Wacom and photoshop.   I don&#39;t want him to feel he has to take &quot;normal classes&quot; to get <br/>
a job in the industry.....unless that is the only way to get that type of job.....I am just not <br/>
sure and feel inadaquate to help him...even though we can google and look for <br/>
information.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
