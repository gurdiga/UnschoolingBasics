<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900344457">So I&#39;m fairly new to the unschooling thing.  It&#39;s definitely what I want for <br/>
my son who is still a toddler and I&#39;m working on the &quot;living it&quot; as well.  Not <br/>
just waiting for him to grow up so we can do it.  :)  KWIM?  Of course you <br/>
do.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My little boy is a doll and I love him totally and completely.  He going <br/>
through something right now where he crinkles his nose at me, which means he&#39;s <br/>
&quot;mean&quot; (a word he uses) and will throw the closest object at my head or try to <br/>
hit, scratch or bite me, his older brother (my stepson) or his dad.  It happens <br/>
much more often with me and his brother thought.  I&#39;ve tried lots of things.  <br/>
The thing that doesn&#39;t work at all is to get mad at him.  It makes that cute <br/>
little nose crinkle even more and his aim gets better!  But I find myself <br/>
getting more and more frustrated with this behavior.  I try my best to keep my cool <br/>
and get down to his level.  Talk to him about how hitting hurts, blocks are <br/>
not for throwing they are for building, and/or letting him know that if he <br/>
throws/hits with whatever object he is holding I will take it away.  I&#39;m sure this <br/>
is just a phase he is going through.  I&#39;m just looking for some suggestions <br/>
while I wait this one out.  Anyone have any ideas??  This seems to me a good <br/>
time to &quot;live it&quot; and I just want to make sure I&#39;m handling it well.  <br/>

Hi, Beth,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like he may be acting out something he saw and heard (maybe on<br/>
a video or TV or maybe out someplace?) where someone was called or said they<br/>
were being &quot;mean&quot; and did similar things.  What I&#39;d do is find a way to give<br/>
him what he&#39;s &quot;needing&quot; in a way that is not hurtful to the other people in<br/>
the house.  So given his age, what I&#39;d do is first of all, is get behind the<br/>
needs...I&#39;d respect that for him it&#39;s important to try this &quot;role&quot; he&#39;s<br/>
calling &quot;mean&quot; on right now, that he needs to act out something he saw so<br/>
that he can &quot;own&quot; it.  It&#39;s his way of learning about what he saw, to make<br/>
sense of something that he saw or heard someplace.  So I&#39;d work on ways for<br/>
him to do this.  I&#39;d give him some &quot;mean&quot; materials - some soft balls or<br/>
small stuffed animals or something he can throw without hurting someone and<br/>
explain they are for when he wants to pretend he is &quot;mean&quot;.  For the<br/>
hitting, biting and scratching, maybe you could suggest a big stuffed<br/>
animal, or just ask him what he thinks he could use so that he&#39;s not<br/>
&quot;really&quot; hurting anyone.  He&#39;s already got the message from you that the<br/>
other stuff hurts, but what he doesn&#39;t have is a suggested outlet for what<br/>
he wants to do that doesn&#39;t hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
