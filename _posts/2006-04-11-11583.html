<br/>
that made me smile... :)  not only have I got out of my own itchy box, but I<br/>
can see how my best friend is still in hers and how it makes her think when<br/>
I bring up &quot;itchy&quot; topics... such as spanking, tv freedom, bed times, candy<br/>
consumption, etc that she&#39;s still using coercion with.  I&#39;m not pushy about<br/>
things... but I also don&#39;t make light of these issues either.  I share<br/>
articles and information with her... she may read them and she may not but I<br/>
m exposing her to freedoms that we all should have as human beings, not<br/>
having double standards between adults and children.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the itchy box is a great visualization... and I love it.<br/>
