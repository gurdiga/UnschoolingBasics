<div id="ygrps-yiv-414768385">This topic comes up quite frequently and Scott Noelle did a good job  <br/>
of explaining the difference between sharing what we do and  <br/>
justifying it in todays message.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t get his daily newsletter, you should! Always nicely  <br/>
short and to the point.<br/>

:: Don&#39;t Explain ::<br/>
<br/>
Being on the leading edge of parenting, you may<br/>
find yourself explaining to others *why* you parent<br/>
the way you do.<br/>
<br/>
This can be a good thing when someone has<br/>
expressed curiosity about it and you&#39;re simply<br/>
sharing information. But it&#39;s better *not* to explain<br/>
yourself if you&#39;re trying to *justify* your choices.<br/>
<br/>
Justifying gives away your power. It implies that<br/>
you need the other person&#39;s approval. It undermines<br/>
your self-confidence and distances you from your<br/>
Inner Guidance.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;need&quot; to explain and justify your choices is<br/>
based on the &quot;need&quot; to be right. But if your parenting<br/>
choices are &quot;right,&quot; and the other person would parent<br/>
differently, then s/he must be &quot;wrong.&quot; Once you get<br/>
in that right/wrong mode, conflict or interpersonal<br/>
tension is inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of explaining your parenting to others,<br/>
silently remind *yourself* that your choices are right<br/>
*for you*, and your own approval is all you need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096724885">Joyce, I just read it before I opened your email and YES - I do that. I <br/>
justify, explain. Or feel I need to, especially to the older kid&#39;s dad and even to <br/>
Juan, my current (lol) husband. It&#39;s when, I&#39;ve since learned by listening to <br/>
myself, that it&#39;s ME that needs that reassurance that this is right for us. MY <br/>
trust is on edge or has been challenged. Pressure, too, adds to that for me. <br/>
<br/>
I was glad to read that.<br/>
