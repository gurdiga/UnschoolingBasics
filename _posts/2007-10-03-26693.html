Survival Of The Fittest<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue<br/>
the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I<br/>
hold M&M duels.<br/>
<br/>
Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure,<br/>
squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That<br/>
is the &quot;loser,&quot; and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner<br/>
gets to go another round.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and<br/>
the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that<br/>
the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of<br/>
competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or<br/>
pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to<br/>
be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra<br/>
strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.<br/>
<br/>
When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the<br/>
strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as<br/>
well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A<br/>
Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with<br/>
a 3x5 card reading, &quot;Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free<br/>
1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this &quot;grant money.&quot; I have set<br/>
aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we<br/>
will discover the True Champion.<br/>
<br/>
There can be only one.<br/>
