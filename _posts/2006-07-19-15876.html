<div id="ygrps-yiv-550753028">Hi,<br/>
I pulled my 10 yr old dd from school mid-year in February and <br/>
although we&#39;ve had a rocky start things are going bit better now.<br/>
<br/>
We are considering removing her brother from school as well, starting <br/>
this year. I do have one mild dilemma, my son has Asperger&#39;s syndrome <br/>
and spent the last 3 yrs of PS in special classes. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s easy to get along with, no behavior problems and generally nice <br/>
to be around. Loves insects, animals, the computer and reading. <br/>
<br/>
He likes to keep schedules and wants set times for meals and <br/>
bedtimes. No problem, I can do that if he wants and I will. (easy <br/>
enough, lol)<br/>
<br/>
There is this one thing. All summer long he&#39;s been wondering when <br/>
he&#39;s going to do &quot;real&quot; school. What do I tell him? (He use to go to <br/>
a summer school program) I&#39;ve been reading to him and giving him <br/>
worksheets, etc, but I&#39;m having a hard time coming up with 6 hrs of <br/>
school for him, plus with 4 kids it&#39;s rather difficult. <br/>
<br/>
When we read, he wants me to set a timer, not because he wants to get <br/>
the reading done, it&#39;s the way they did it in school and he&#39;s stuck. <br/>
I tried telling him we can read when, where, and how he wants <br/>
anytime. He doesn&#39;t need a timer, but he still wants it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here unschool a child with Asperger&#39;s that could give me <br/>
some tips or advice? I&#39;d really appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your time and I hope everyone has a good day! :-)<br/>
<br/>

A good place to go would be Anne&#39;s list  shinewithunschooling.  Their <br/>
discussions are geared towards those types of children.  There are <br/>
quite a few that have children with Asperger&#39;s so you will probably <br/>
get lots of great advice :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280359612">Baby steps. That&#39;s really it all comes down to...when you have a kid  <br/>
who feels that strongly about maintaining schedules, you cannot just  <br/>
let it go all of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
Why six hours of work? What we did when we first started was going  <br/>
through what they did in a day. It took two hours to do everything  <br/>
they had done at school. When we were done, I made points about how  <br/>
that was all the school was doing. It was important for my ten yo (at  <br/>
the time) aspie to see that. Stretch the boundaries a little bit at a  <br/>
time...then when the time is right, break the mold altogether. We  <br/>
were lucky  ;-)  in that we had a medical emergency take over our  <br/>
lives, so there really wasn&#39;t a choice. What about a trip somewhere  <br/>
to break the routine, and then coming home and recover...just never  <br/>
quite getting back to the regular stuff?<br/>
<br/>
What about telling him that you see that the school was wrong, he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need summer school, and it&#39;s time for a vacation? Make a  <br/>
point or doing a LOT at first to distract him. With our kids at first  <br/>
we did a lot of &#39;field trips&#39; and slowly replaced the table time with  <br/>
real living. That worked well too.<br/>
<br/>
It really does work, with big families, little families, rich  <br/>
families, poor families, with all kids regardless of their needs.<br/>

<br/>
Anne made a point to let folks know that her list is geared for all<br/>
children and radical unschooling. There was a member from her list<br/>
that started a list specifically for &quot;out of synch&quot; children though.<br/>
<br/>
I think her list is a really good place if you want to learn how to<br/>
see your child without the labels though. I think she&#39;s just trying to<br/>
make sure it&#39;s not some &quot;special needs&quot; list, but a straight up<br/>
radical unschooling and how-it&#39;s-great-for-all-kids list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922043009">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone how took the time to read and answer my post. <br/>
You were so helpful and I really appreciated all the responses. I do <br/>
need to take baby sets with this, as we are both new, so that&#39;s a <br/>
good idea. A bit of a challenge to both, but worth it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I know someone seemed a bit surprized that I was trying to come up <br/>
with 6 hrs of work. :-) Mainly that was because my son seems to lack <br/>
any direction for himself, he seems to want someone to tell him what <br/>
to do, think, feel every moment of the day. Spoon feed him everything <br/>
and direct his every move round clock. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a left over from school? Hopefully in time he&#39;ll learn it&#39;s ok <br/>
to come up with his own ideas and just do them, make his own fun. In <br/>
the mean time I guess I just have to be there for him.    <br/>
<br/>
I loved the suggestion to check out shinewithunschooling. I hadn&#39;t <br/>
even been aware there was such a thing and was happy to learn of it. <br/>
I joined the group. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all your time and help. Hope everyone Has a <br/>
wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>

Hi Maggie,<br/>
I, too, belong to &quot;shine&quot;.   My dd is a &quot;highly sensitive person&quot; <br/>
(and since learning that and reading the book, I realize so is my <br/>
husband).  It has made all the difference in the world to understand <br/>
that this is just part of Who They Are.  Anne&#39;s group is great!   <br/>
Lurk for a while and get a feel for the group.   There are many <br/>
different &quot;types&quot; of kids, Anne and the other veterans help you get <br/>
past the labels and celebrate them for Who They Are.   I&#39;m sure <br/>
there are some people there with kids who have Aspergers who can <br/>
relate and offer suggestions on how to help transition him into an <br/>
unschooling life!<br/>
