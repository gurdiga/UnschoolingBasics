<div id="ygrps-yiv-644809565">&quot;But if you&#39;re looking for a list with the word &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
specifically in the name, here&#39;s our only one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Unschooling&quot;">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Unschooling&quot;</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see much discussion about unschooling over there though.<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of HEM&#39;s weekly newsletter, and a post where a Mom is <br/>
asking everyone to help her name her latest &quot;activity deck&quot; <br/>
educational product.<br/>
<br/>
I think Always Learning, Unschoolingdiscussion, RUL, <br/>
Unschoolingbasics and Unschooling.com are the best places to truly <br/>
discuss unschooling and parenting issues that arise out of the <br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Is unschooling.com getting the changeover to becoming a general <br/>
homeschooling list? The thing I see being damaged here, is people&#39;s <br/>
ability to get information about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s TONS of information about general homeschooling, the <br/>
homeschooling world is bursting with websites and information.<br/>
Taking away forums for unschooling information, strikes me as <br/>
something a person that does NOT truly support unschooling or <br/>
unschoolers would do...it&#39;s strange.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, Ren, the HEM-Unschooling list has not seen a lot of <br/>
discussion, probably because the Unschooling- lists were giving <br/>
people enough places to talk about unschooling issues. That might <br/>
change now, or it might not if people are happy with the existing <br/>
unschooling lists.<br/>

We had a list at one time called Unschooling-dotcom, but we dropped <br/>
that one quite a while ago. Right now Unschooling.com is a website, <br/>
with lots of different features.<br/>

guess the best way I can help anyone understand what happened, and <br/>
why I took the steps I felt were necessary to protect what I and many <br/>
others feel is the true meaning of unschooling, would be to direct <br/>
them to the HEM-Networking list and suggest they read the unschooling <br/>
thread for this last week.<br/>

Yes, I realize that....I was a moderator there for some time.<br/>
I used the word &quot;list&quot;, when I should have said &quot;forum&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if the unschooling.com forum is being changed to a <br/>
general homeschooling forum, rather than specifically unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t help but question how on earth HEM is an unschooling <br/>

homeschooling magazine, with a few unschooling articles thrown in <br/>

  I totally agree.  There was more about homeschooling in the last weekly newsletter about homeschooling than there was about unschooling.  Of course it was hard to miss the negative quote about unschooling that lead the publication.  <br/>
<br/>
  Furthermore, why does HEM feel the need to redefine unschooling.  Why doesn&#39;t it just stop its associations with it altogether and let the people doing it continue on with helping.  Who gave HEM the overarching authority to define unschooling?  I think it must have come when they bought the Unschooling.com name.  <br/>

over time as people return to a less rigid understanding of <br/>
unschooling itself.<br/>

actually the other way around. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m beginning to think that holding unschooling aside like some kind<br/>
of holy grail is doing the entire homeschooling community a<br/>
disservice. Rather, unschooling should be just one point on a<br/>
continuum of homeschooling, and families should be free to take<br/>
whatever parts of it serves their purposes and gets them where they<br/>
want to go. That&#39;s what the term meant when we started publishing<br/>
Home Education Magazine, and it&#39;s what we meant over the years when<br/>
we said we unschooled our five (now grown) kids, and it&#39;s what I<br/>
think unschooling should be: Not a place you get to, but the journey<br/>
itself, as just a part of the entire homeschool journey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~~ Helen Hegener on the Unschooling 101 e-list ~~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a negative quote about unschooling so much as <br/>
it&#39;s a positive quote about homeschooling. Perspective. Use it or <br/>
lose it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because the &quot;helping&quot; was becoming more destructive than helpful - <br/>
and that&#39;s not just my personal opinion, it&#39;s being backed up by a <br/>
rapidly increasing number of other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Who gave HEM the overarching authority to define unschooling?  I <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch. But if we hadn&#39;t bought it someone else would have and they <br/>
might have been much less willing to even discuss the situation with <br/>
people than we are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to share a little commentary I wrote offlist to someone who <br/>
asked me some of these same kinds of questions earlier this morning. <br/>
I apologize for the cut-and-paste shortcut, but as some of you know <br/>
I&#39;ve been battling carpal tunnel syndrome for years now and with all <br/>
the time I&#39;ve spent online this last week it&#39;s starting to flare up <br/>
again. Anyway, here&#39;s what I wrote (in part):<br/>
<br/>
This has indeed been a long-running situation, creating confusion and <br/>
consternation for literally years now, and in the past I&#39;ve always <br/>
tried to believe that it was simply rooted in misunderstandings, <br/>
personality conflicts, issues of clarity and trying to come to grips <br/>
with a very difficult concept. That was - I&#39;ll happily admit - my <br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>
When I posted my post last Sunday, people started pointing out things <br/>
like the recurring conflicts always involving [specific people] in <br/>
some manner, the banning of people who were causing no problems at <br/>
all on other lists even when discussing the same concepts (and <br/>
sometimes even unschooling), the attacks on GWS and the Farengas on <br/>
our Unschooling boards last summer, the increasing assumption that <br/>
HEM was something other than an unschooling-oriented magazine, and <br/>
the increasing realization that as a distinct definition of <br/>
unschooling was being created and supported and advanced, the word <br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39; was coming to mean school-at-home to many people. <br/>
Again, my mistake. I tried to keep the peace when I should have been <br/>
keeping the faith.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect anyone to &quot;follow my ideals,&quot; or even the &quot;ideals of <br/>
HEM.&quot; But when people following their own ideals interferes with <br/>
everyone&#39;s ability to create and follow ideals of their own, then I <br/>
feel it&#39;s time to take a principled stand for what I believe is <br/>
right, which is what I&#39;ve done. The amazing show of support from the <br/>
larger homeschooling and unschooling community has shown me that it <br/>
was overwhelmingly the right thing to do, and long past due.<br/>
