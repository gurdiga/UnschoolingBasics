<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890474529">I just want to thank you all for being here and for sharing your knowledge and experience in living an unschool life.  This afternoon, my four youngest were fighting over the three Xbox controllers.  No one wanted to take turns and my 4 yo ended up left out.  I remembered your words and asked myself how I could adjust this so everyone wins.  I asked my 4 yo if he would like to play w/ the play doh...he said no.  So I asked the group, would anyone like to play w/play-doh instead of Xbox and my 5 yo said yes, practically throwing the controller to my now happy 4 yo.<br/>
<br/>
This is soooo different from how I would have handled it before.  It would have been a &quot;teaching moment&quot; in patience and sharing.  There would have been lots of crying, stress and anger before it was all over.  So happy to be learning a new way!!!<br/>

PS - I will be buying a 4th controller ASAP!!!  :)</div>
