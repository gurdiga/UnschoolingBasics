<div id="ygrps-yiv-121469851">I am having some real issues with my JOB. Basically, I make a really good salary doing something I do for the paycheck, not because its my passion in life. I went to Public School and now I am employed in the Public Sector. I hated school and now I hate my job. But I have my good days because of my &quot;friends&quot; at work. Kind of like having friends at school. You feel part of a community and convince yourself you are making a difference in the world by doing your job. There are so many parallels I can see between what I am doing and going to school as a child. I show up every day and do my bit, and at this point I am not even clear what my passions are because my time mostly belongs to someone else and I have to think about what they pay me to think about, not what I want to think about. And right now I am at work not doing my job. I am emailing you all on the internet. <br/>
One day last year, after a particularly bad commute  my daughter had to stay in &quot;after school care&quot; way too long because I was late. She got into the car and started ragging on me for being late. I tried to explain to her that it was not my fault. She leaned her head against the window and said: &quot;I&#39;m just so unhappy. I HATE my school so much. I hate school.&quot; and I said &quot;I hate work.&quot; and then I looked at her and said: &quot;Lets quit.&quot; So....here she is deschooling and I am still working. (Fortunately her Dad is off work until January.) I tell her often that I want her to find her passions in life, but I am not exactly practicing what I preach. I feel like I need to &quot;dework.&quot; I am trying to set myself up financially for quitting, but it is taking time and I am so tempted to just quit and let the chips fall where they may. I also have some trepidation because I worked hard to get where I am and its nice to have a decent salary to afford things. I grew up poor and we lived paycheck to pay<br/>
check before I went back into the work force. Has anyone else quit a &quot;good job&quot; for uncertainty?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525437219">~~Has anyone else quit a &quot;good job&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Oh my yes.<br/>
My dh was making about $50k per year, our mortgage was about $350 for<br/>
a very large house and we got a trip to Mexico or Hawaii every year.<br/>
If he&#39;d stayed at that company, we would have been well into the 6<br/>
figure income now. And our lives would not be our own.<br/>
<br/>
We sold our house and moved to Florida, having never BEEN there!!:)<br/>
We started our own business and lived on very low income for a long<br/>
time. But it was on our terms, we chose our lives and we learned so<br/>
much from the experience. Just about the time we were getting<br/>
financially ahead, we moved AGAIN! I know...crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Left our jobs and home again, to start all over in TN. We chose this<br/>
life and we love it here. We took another financial hit and some<br/>
serious risk to start over again...but we finally feel that we&#39;ve<br/>
found &quot;home&quot;. We&#39;re doing work we love and living exactly where we<br/>
want to be for long-term.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, when we were struggling to get going up here<br/>
last year, my dh&#39;s old company kept writing him and asking him to come<br/>
back. It was the kind of money that would drastically change our<br/>
lives. While the money sounded REALLY great, neither of us was truly<br/>
tempted to change anything. Confidence comes from pursuing the life<br/>
you choose and seeing that it CAN and will work out. Life IS good.:)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; . Has anyone else quit a &quot;good job&quot; for uncertainty?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just this week! I quit a part-time teaching job I&#39;ve done for years  <br/>
and hated more and more all the time. My partner and I decided that I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go back next semester, but after we made that decision,  <br/>
continuing became intolerable, and I asked my chair to replace me  <br/>
immediately. Which he did. (One of my friends said, &quot;I understand.  <br/>
I&#39;ve had jobs that I couldn&#39;t let myself feel how much I hated them,  <br/>
because I had to keep doing them. Once you decided to leave in  <br/>
December, you couldn&#39;t keep pretending you didn&#39;t hate what you were  <br/>
doing, so you had to quit sooner.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
My situation isn&#39;t quite like yours because I didn&#39;t provide the bulk  <br/>
of our family&#39;s income, working from home only part-time. But I made  <br/>
a lot of money per hour, and I have anxiety about money, so even as  <br/>
my partner&#39;s income has increased, it has been hard for me to think  <br/>
of giving up the &quot;extra&quot; money I was earning. Recently, when I was  <br/>
talking--yet again--about my job, my partner said to me, &quot;But when  <br/>
you say you make a lot per hour, you have to take into account how  <br/>
your job hangs over your head all the time...how much time you spend  <br/>
talking to me and friends about how much you hate it...how irritable  <br/>
you get...how it takes you away from being available to the kids even  <br/>
when you&#39;re not actually working at that moment.&quot; Over the next few  <br/>
weeks, I paid attention and realized he was right--doing the job  <br/>
affected my mood and cast a pall over my life that extended far  <br/>
beyond the hours I spent doing it.<br/>
<br/>
It has felt great to quit, though I&#39;m definitely de-working. This  <br/>
week, I just wanted to veg out and read instead of jumping in and  <br/>
doing all the things I was suddenly free to do, so I spent much of  <br/>
the week relaxing, letting the house go to hell, ordering take-out  <br/>
for dinner. I also felt able to say &quot;Yes&quot; to the kids a lot, and just  <br/>
be with them while they spent as much time at the park, the library,  <br/>
or engaged in a project, as they wanted. Aaaahhh.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, my situation isn&#39;t analogous to yours--I earned about 1/8  <br/>
of what my partner earns, and he just got a raise, so I don&#39;t _think_  <br/>
leaving my job will require huge shifts in how we handle money, in  <br/>
what we can and can&#39;t do, and so on. But it feels so good to have  <br/>
just taken the plunge, to not keep thinking, &quot;I&#39;ll just do the job  <br/>
for a few more years until the car is paid off,&quot; or &quot;I can keep doing  <br/>
the job and put the money into savings! Won&#39;t that be great?&quot; For me,  <br/>
it&#39;s tied up with anxiety about money, and I am also feeling that in  <br/>
this transition. But I expect it will be all to the good in the long  <br/>
term.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also am thinking that leaving the job gives me the opportunity  <br/>
to find other outlets for doing the parts of it I do like. I taught  <br/>
required freshman composition classes to students who were poorly  <br/>
prepared and didn&#39;t want to be there. Hellish! In the past, I have  <br/>
led creative writing workshops and reading groups, which have allowed  <br/>
me to facilitate groups of people who wanted to be there, practicing  <br/>
things they were interested in, outside the school system. I am  <br/>
excited to think about doing a reading group again, for instance. And  <br/>
next summer, if my proposal is accepted, I&#39;ll be leading a week-long  <br/>
(3 hours/day) workshop on Walt Whitman&#39;s &quot;Song of Myself&quot; for  <br/>
Quakers, something I might not have been able to do otherwise because  <br/>
I usually have taught a summer class.<br/>
<br/>
You might broaden your question to, &quot;Has anyone ever just taken a  <br/>
leap of faith?&quot; Has there been a time when you&#39;ve done that? (Having  <br/>
babies comes to mind for me!)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Su, who, God willing, will never again have to grade a 1000-word  <br/>
essay on Secondhand Smoke, Euthanasia, or whether homeschooling  <br/>
should be legal &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817370384"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Has anyone else quit a &quot;good job&quot; for uncertainty?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I had a good, work at home, telecommute job with benefits.  It <br/>
was also the major source of income in our family.  Hubby and I <br/>
decided that while we enjoyed where we were living, we didn&#39;t enjoy <br/>
HOW we were living.  There was no passion, no joy, no happiness, no <br/>
togetherness, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I quit my job, cashed in my 401k (just enough to pay the moving <br/>
truck and live for 2 months) and moved with my hubby to Louisiana.  <br/>
It took ALOT of getting used to.  Now we have a completely different <br/>
lifestyle.  Now my hubby makes all the money and he has 6 months of <br/>
vacation every year (he works 2 weeks on, has 2 weeks off).  <br/>
<br/>
It took me 2 years to fully de-work; I had been working everyday <br/>
since I was 14.  At first I felt guilty about not working and tried <br/>
making money on the side, even though I didn&#39;t like it.  Then I gave <br/>
up that too to just &#39;be&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
As a child, my father always insisted that you had to have a good <br/>
job and benefits.  That was his definition of success.  I soon found <br/>
out that it was not mine.  Now I really enjoy being passionate about <br/>
life.  Sometimes, like having children, you just take the leap and <br/>
go with it. <br/>

we usually throw these things away, and suddenly ther is a way to buy  <br/>

Hi Kathryn,<br/>
I guess I&#39;m responding to this posting and your other posting <br/>
following up about your daughter, at the same time.  You and your <br/>
daughter sound like incredibly courageous people.  Your daughter <br/>
seems so grounded, self-aware and wise... sometimes our children <br/>
are the best teachers for us adults, aren&#39;t they?  I know that I <br/>
have learned far more from my kids about what really matters, than <br/>
I&#39;ve taught them.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Linda </span></blockquote></div>

Fear of failure I guess. (I know, feel the fear and do it anyway) I have had more than one halfbaked idea in the past that failed to pan out. Also, I am the primary breadwinner at the moment so its going to take some planning. <br/>

financially for quitting, but it is taking time and I am so tempted <br/>
to just quit and let the chips fall where they may.&quot;<br/>

Hi Kathryn,<br/>
I guess I&#39;m responding to this posting and your other posting <br/>
following up about your daughter, at the same time. You and your <br/>
daughter sound like incredibly courageous people. Your daughter <br/>
seems so grounded, self-aware and wise... sometimes our children <br/>
are the best teachers for us adults, aren&#39;t they? I know that I <br/>
have learned far more from my kids about what really matters, than <br/>
I&#39;ve taught them.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Linda<br/>
