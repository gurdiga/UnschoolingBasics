<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478135372">I really need to vent. I was on this local list and never really said<br/>
much. A couple weeks ago the mods ask more RUers to speak up because<br/>
the advice was really mainstream and RU type advice was being attacked<br/>
for hurting peoples feelings. So I started posting again. I was just<br/>
posting stuff about cell phone use and I try to keep it general and<br/>
ask questions, etc. I challenged (in a nice way so I thought) some<br/>
advice (it was very mainstream) that one person posted as not being<br/>
from an unschooling approach. Well, apparently it was one of the<br/>
moderators and she got totally bent. She took everything personally<br/>
and called me abrasive and like Sandra Dodd (I have never been on her<br/>
list so I am not sure what that exactly means but she said it like it<br/>
wasn&#39;t nice). Anyway, I get so much crap for RU irl and then to be<br/>
totally crapped on during an online conversation sucks. I just wanna<br/>
scream. Anyway, there isn&#39;t anyone on here can do but I had to &quot;tell&quot;<br/>
someone. It is really burning me up. I just quit the list, it seemed<br/>
do petty.<br/>

This happened on the MySpace board for awhile too.  There were a<br/>
couple of people who really didn&#39;t like my &quot;style&quot;.  It&#39;s ok.  My<br/>
feelings weren&#39;t hurt.  I&#39;ve always been described as a little<br/>
abrasive, a devil&#39;s advocate of sorts. <br/>

Not everyone in the world is polite and well-behaved.  Some people<br/>
need to get over that.   &lt;G&gt;</div>

Yeah, it wasn&#39;t nice trust me.;)<br/>
Some people think any discussion or disagreement is &quot;abrasive&quot;. I&#39;m<br/>
sorry you had to deal with it when some of the mods wanted RU posters.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem like a good way to spend your energy after all. <br/>
<br/>
Have you considered starting a local list of your own, with a very up<br/>
front unschooling message? We have a secular/inclusive group here that<br/>
all the unschoolers hang out with and I don&#39;t post a lot about<br/>
unschooling there unless it&#39;s in a general &quot;here&#39;s what we do&quot; way.<br/>
But we also have an unschooling group and I have no problem sharing my<br/>
views there. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll find the folks that WANT that kind of list if you start<br/>
one. That might be really cool. If you want to read the description of<br/>
our local unschooling list it&#39;s here: <br/>

<br/>
I just rejected a couple of posts there about some homeschooling fair<br/>
that had religious classes and such, something that would have been<br/>
just fine for the local inclusive list. It&#39;s nice to have both.:) I<br/>
didn&#39;t start it but the lady that did is a total RU&#39;er.<br/>

<br/>
And Sandra knows this, that&#39;s partly why she isn&#39;t on certain lists<br/>
(like this one) because it gives people lotsa options to find what<br/>
works for them.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re pretty patient over here and open to letting things get<br/>
OT a bit...but we piss people off once in a while too. It happens no<br/>
matter what you do. My goal is to keep the list purpose true to it&#39;s<br/>
origins so that we&#39;re best serving the majority that signed on here to<br/>
get unschooling information.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576139385">Thanks Heather and Ren,<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to hurt feelings, I am typically typing while nursing<br/>
(with one hand) and I try to keep things brief to get a whole thought<br/>
out. I guess I need to add a little touchy feely fluff. I probabaly<br/>
won&#39;t. I like the idea of starting a new list for RU instead of being<br/>
inclusive like the PA0unschoolers list. There are many education only<br/>
unschoolers and eclectic HSers.  The moderator has since admitted I<br/>
was dead on and I hit a nerve but I felt publically humiliated. And<br/>
now there are so many people rushing to her support and offering salve<br/>
for her hurt emotions but ignoring mine. Is it hard to run a list? I<br/>
am a little worried about taking on something like that as I had an<br/>
infant. I am also not an awesome writer like Ren, Kelly or Pam etc. DO<br/>
I need to be?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619083411">Faith, it sounds as though the mod may have realised that she made a<br/>
mistake?  Have you considered gently telling her how you feel and<br/>
asking her whether (in the interests of you being able to carry on the<br/>
good work of offering advice from RU perspective) she would consider<br/>
smoothing things out publicly (ie on list)? Amanda</div>

 Is it hard to run a list?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier than putting up with someone else&#39;s rules. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get a moderator or two who can be &quot;heavies.&quot; Ren and I have Deb & Rue. <br/>
I think Ren and Deb do most of the off-list work though.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not something you have to take on all by your lonesome. For a <br/>
while, maybe----but if the list is small, you won&#39;t have much to do <br/>
anyway. As it grows, you can ask others who write a lot and who share <br/>
the same vision/philosophy to be your moderator(s).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to set up---in fact. I started a new list just today.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am a little worried about taking on something like that as I had an <br/>
infant.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not on the bigger list anymore, it really won&#39;t take any more <br/>
time---in fact, probably LESS because you won&#39;t allow the crap that <br/>
you&#39;re busy arguing against now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that you kind of have to READ every post that comes <br/>
in. You don&#39;t necessarily have to answer each post. But I feel more <br/>
obligated to answer many posts here than I do on list I don&#39;t own. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I answer *all* posts. Just ones that matter to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am also not an awesome writer like Ren, Kelly or Pam etc. DO I need <br/>
to be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, *I* think you write just fine. But no, one does *not* have to be <br/>
some kind of great writer. It&#39;s all about the SHARING of ideas. It <br/>
certainly helps if you can string a sentence together. &lt;g&gt; But you <br/>
don&#39;t have to be awe-inspiring! &lt;bwg&gt; The thing IS: the more you write, <br/>
the better and clearer your writing gets. Your ideas too. Writing has <br/>
very much clarified my philosophy because it gives me a chance to <br/>
*think* about things and let things &quot;coagulate&quot; into some kind of <br/>
coherent &quot;lump.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Go for it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
