<div id="ygrps-yiv-473997040">Would members of your unschooling family get a kick out of sending and<br/>
receiving postcards from other unschooling families around the world?!<br/>
That is the purpose of this new group -- to unite unschooling families<br/>
from across the globe through tangible tokens of Joy delivered right<br/>
to the mailbox! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingaroundtheworld/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingaroundtheworld/</a><br/>
<br/>
We have unschoolers from New Zealand to South Africa, from Austria to<br/>
the US who are participating. Just add yourself to the database and<br/>
start sending postcards, as many and as often as *you* choose!<br/>
