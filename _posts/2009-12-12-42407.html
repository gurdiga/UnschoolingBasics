<div id="ygrps-yiv-187645906">Sorry about the obvious newbie question, but then i am a newbie!<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be &#39;relaxed&#39; schooling<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
and &#39;radical unschooling&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Relaxed seems to be mostly the kids decide what they want to do in school, but if the parent thinks the balance is not right they may &#39;demand&#39; some maths/LA/art or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling seems to be that the child directs the school part of life, but the parent controls things like access to the computer, or chores etc.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling seems to be that you behave with your kids as if you were dear friends rather than in a traditional parent/child relationship...with the obvious care/safety issues needed to be considered with the younger crew. So a parent might suggest a walk on the beach...as they would call a friend and ask if they would like a walk, but the parent is not attached to the response and the child is free to decline just as the friend is...and the same goes for washing up and computer games etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have this right? or am I way off base here?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739874516">Pretty close. Unschooling is trusting that kids will learn when and how<br/>
they need to/choose to for their own purposes, their own agenda, as if<br/>
school and the school agenda didn&#39;t exist. Radical unschooling takes<br/>
that trust and poses the question &quot;If I trust my kids will learn to<br/>
read/add/whatever in a manner that works for them, why not trust that<br/>
they can also learn to eat/sleep/etc in a way their own bodies need? In<br/>
both cases, I&#39;m right beside them to provide information and assistance<br/>
and facilitate access as they need/choose it.&quot; <br/>
