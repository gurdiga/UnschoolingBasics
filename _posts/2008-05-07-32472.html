 <br/>
1. My son is eight and is finally getting it. We found a watch that has a<br/>
repeating timer and best of all it vibrates and/or beeps. We started out<br/>
with two hours. Every two hours it would go off he had to go sit on the<br/>
potty for ten minutes or until he went whichever came first. He had his<br/>
first accident in weeks and it was nothing more then what I call a fart<br/>
mark. the watch is called a vibralite3 and runs about $50. It is a good<br/>
watch that he could use beyond the potty training. It also has two alarm<br/>
times and a stop watch. Let him stay in the pull-up and tell him about the<br/>
watch - let him pick out the color he wants and tell him your plans. Then<br/>
leave it to him.<br/>
 <br/>
2. I believe you have to make a balance. Do a family night and make sure you<br/>
have a date night once a week. Children do require sleep and raising zombies<br/>
isn&#39;t nearly as fun as well rested children. I had much the same opinion and<br/>
let the kids basically sleep when they dropped. They missed a lot of things<br/>
they wanted to do because I couldn&#39;t get them up and out on time. Together<br/>
we decided that they needed to go to bed by a certain time and that I would<br/>
help them manage their time better so they could do all the things they want<br/>
to do during the day.<br/>
 <br/>
3. Teeth - there are lots of options including getting one of those baby<br/>
finger brushes and baby, training or toothpaste in tons of flavors. There<br/>
are brushes that light up, ones that brush the tops and bottoms at the same<br/>
time, ones that play music... my dentist told me children only need to brush<br/>
60 seconds. My son likes to try to sing the ABC song which in my opinion is<br/>
gross (it sounds aweful) but gets the job done.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I have twin 4 year old boys. One is potty trained, the other not.  <br/>
The boy who is not potty trained is wearing pull-ups now.  He happily <br/>
wore underwear for about 5 months, but continued to wet & poop in his <br/>
pants.  I was getting really tired of cleaning up all this (he was <br/>
usually willing to help) so I decided to let him wear pull-ups to <br/>
make clean-up easier for me.  That helped me be accepting of his lack <br/>
of ability to get to the toilet.  <br/>
<br/>
SO I guess I am just saying - Yes it is okay.<br/>
<br/>
If you think about it, we trained our children to potty in diapers.  <br/>
That is what they have been doing their entire lives!  Then we<br/>
(parents in general) come along and want them to stop pottying in <br/>
their pants and start using the toilet.  Changes like that are not <br/>
always going to come about easily. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573024631">I learned after my first that potty &quot;training&quot; is just that...<br/>
training you to make your kid sit on the toilet instead of waiting<br/>
until their body is ready to tell them!!   With my next child I<br/>
basically gave her some underwear when she asked and that was the end<br/>
of my involvement in the process... she was fully dry day and night in<br/>
a week or so compared to months and months with my oldest!   I did the<br/>
same with my last two (even my special needs child it was just later<br/>
when she wanted the underwear)  <br/>
<br/>
As for husband and wife time... those kids will grow up and leave ...<br/>
the time you have to spend with them is so short!   Yes nurture your<br/>
relationship with your husband and be kind and receptive to his needs<br/>
but reassure him this time is so short! <br/>

***<br/>
<br/>
LOL! Riiight. I&#39;ll tell DH this and he will reschedule his work and I&#39;ll let the kids know and they can reschedule their activities and we can all sit around playing checkers one night a week and on a different night DH and I can go smooch at the movies. Which we can&#39;t afford, don&#39;t want to go to and don&#39;t need in order to be close and feel connected.<br/>
<br/>
It may work for you but it would be completely the wrong tack here.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the suggestions that everyone eat dinner together. That&#39;s may be fine if you don&#39;t see your kids and spouse during the day but, by the time dinner is ready here, we&#39;ve seen each other all day and generally enjoy a break.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling lifestyles, maybe like many others, don&#39;t fit many molds.<br/>

What have you done?~~<br/>
<br/>
There is no single answer that might work best for you, but I can tell<br/>
you what we did. We changed our thinking!:)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all up at night, eating, playing etc...so dh and I spend time<br/>
together in the mornings. The kids sleep later than we do, so we&#39;ll<br/>
sit outside on the deck, watching birds and sipping tea in the<br/>
morning. It might not be that long before a sleepy-eyed child joins<br/>
us, but we do get some time to talk and connect. In fact, I&#39;m getting<br/>
ready to go up and start tea now.<br/>
<br/>

go sit on the potty for ten minutes or until he went whichever came<br/>
first.~~<br/>
<br/>
This sounds invasive and unecessary. I think trust needs to extend<br/>
into these areas as well. I have one child that couldn&#39;t stay dry all<br/>
night until around the age of 11 or so. People grow into it in their<br/>
own time, barring any true physical abnormality.  There are ways to<br/>
help a child be comfortable and grow into something in their own time.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 2. I believe you have to make a balance. Do a family night and make<br/>

raising zombies isn&#39;t nearly as fun as well rested children.~~<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve never raised zombies! But my kids would think that was<br/>
pretty cool.;)<br/>
Why would you need a &quot;family night&quot;? I&#39;m really curious about this<br/>
one. If a family is together and connecting (which I assume<br/>
unschooling gives that) then why a special time set aside for that<br/>
connecting? It should be as natural as breathing. And &quot;date night&quot;?<br/>
That happens about once every blue moon. We are adults and can find<br/>
ways to connect and be intimate without leaving our children every week.<br/>
<br/>
All people need sleep, not just children. And whether they get that<br/>
sleep starting late at night or earlier, what matters is they get the<br/>
sleep...NOT when it starts!  9 hours of sleep, is 9 hours of sleep<br/>
whether it begins at 8pm or 2am. Trusting one&#39;s body is more important<br/>
than the &quot;when&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We purposely don&#39;t plan on activities early in the morning, but when<br/>
something comes up, my children have no problem tweaking their sleep<br/>
in order to accommodate because we would only go if they really wanted<br/>
to participate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441095444">I don&#39;t know that I think it is coersive, but I think it is mean. I clean up after Simon (11) and Linnaea (8) a lot. If they want to help, they help. Linnaea likes to clean up with the carpet cleaner when a stain requires it, so I usually offer her the opportunity to do so. But I don&#39;t set them up with the consequences of their actions. I vacuumed their rooms today. I did it because I was vacuuming the hall and I thought it would be good to get their rooms while I had the vacuum cleaner up there. The other day I went through an unpacked box, I didn&#39;t really unpack, I sort of piled all the stuff up that was in it on the floor, in Simon&#39;s room. He didn&#39;t chastize me, or tell me that I had to clean the mess up I&#39;d made, instead he cleaned it up, and then he helped his sister to clean her room. And not because he had to, or she had to, but because she wanted her room to feel as welcoming as his room, he thought it being cleaner might help. If I made them<br/>
 clean their rooms, they could never choose to do so. <br/>
<br/>
When Linnaea was 3 maybe, or almost 3, Simon decided she needed to be using the toilet. I have no idea why, Simon didn&#39;t stop with diapers until we were in Kyoto and he was 3 and a 1/2 and David had bought out all the diapers in his size that he could find. He bribed her with candy. Again, I don&#39;t know why that worked, there was free access to candy in our house, but somehow Simon giving her a piece of candy when she&#39;d used the toilet got her using the toilet. As soon as he ran out of candy, she stopped using the toilet. We got more candy in, but she was no longer willing to have him bribe her. She did it on her own a few months later, no bribes, no consequences, just being ready. And she didn&#39;t have to clean up after herself if she peed on the floor or pooped. Nor did Simon, and both of them use the toilet just fine now. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi. My name is Jamie and I am new to both unschooling and this<br/>
&gt; &gt; group. I have two boys, ages 4 1/2 and 6. Due to my oldest&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Jason) very negative experiences in public school, my husband and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have decided to unschool. I want to embrace this total lifestyle<br/>
&gt; &gt; and parenting style, but I have a few questions:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) My youngest had a very hard time potty training (very resistant<br/>
&gt; &gt; until he decided to do it himself ... imagine that!), but finally<br/>
&gt; &gt; achieved success at school, but spotty success at home. He just<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets very &quot;into&quot; what he is doing and misses the bodily cues that he<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs to go. Anyway, since we have pulled them out of school (a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks ago) he has decided that he just wants to wear a pull-up. Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; this ok? I feel that it is, but I guess I just need some<br/>
&gt; &gt; reassurance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) I enjoy letting the boys stay up later than they used to. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel that it is really great family time, since they get to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; more time with their dad when he gets home from work. However, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband feels that we are losing our husband/wife time and that life<br/>
&gt; &gt; is getting too focused on the boys, to the detriment of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; marriage. Has anyone experienced these feelings with their spouse?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What have you done?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

forcing the kids to go to bed early. That works for us. Pretty soon, <br/>
too, the kids will be grown and gone and will be just me and my <br/>

together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837030633">***We&#39;re all up at night, eating, playing etc...so dh and I spend time<br/>
together in the mornings. ***<br/>
<br/>
We just recently did the same thing!  We used to have a lot of alone time<br/>
together when the kids had bedtimes.  But they are naturally night people as<br/>
well as us, so now that has become family time.  We love it!  We watch tv,<br/>
listen to music (or play music--we just got a new drum set!  Yeah!), go for<br/>
walks, or just hang out.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, the after dinner hours were very low-key and very family<br/>
oriented.  We&#39;d hang out for a while together and then get ready for bed.  I<br/>
hated going to bed.  I just wanted to soak up as much family time as I<br/>
could.  When I became a Mom, I tried to implement the same &quot;quick&quot; family<br/>
hour before rushing everyone off to bed.  Then DH and I had our time<br/>
together.  In the last month, we&#39;ve decided to give up the bedtimes, and I&#39;m<br/>
finding it way easier to connect with EVERYONE in the family during this<br/>
time.  It&#39;s so much better than a forced bedtime!  Then, like in Ren&#39;s<br/>
family, the kids will sleep in and that&#39;s when DH and I find time to<br/>
connect.  So far, it&#39;s working out great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402194879">That&#39;s an interesting way to look at it.  I never thought of it as mean.<br/>
Perhaps I didn&#39;t explain well enough.  I thought of it as life.  After all,<br/>
if I knock over a glass of milk at the dinner table, I clean it up.  I don&#39;t<br/>
expect others to do that for me, although they will often help.<br/>
<br/>
We never chastised him or complained or tried to make him use the potty.  In<br/>
fact, we didn&#39;t make a big deal about it all.  He was using the potty some<br/>
of the time, but using his pullup a lot of the time when he said he wanted<br/>
underware.  We just said that we thought it was great that he wanted to try<br/>
underwear, and if he had an accident, here&#39;s something he could use to help<br/>
clean it up.  He was delighted and thought that he was being a &quot;big boy&quot;<br/>
cleaning up after himself.  Of course, at almost 4, his cleanups weren&#39;t<br/>
exactly very thorough, and I had to do a more extensive cleanup.  But after<br/>
a week or so, he decided that he was tired of cleaning up, and said he was<br/>
going to make sure he used the potty, and he did.  He could have gone back<br/>
to pullups, but he made the decision to use the potty and to continue<br/>
wearing underwear.<br/>
<br/>
I think that when we unschool, we have to be willing to allow our children<br/>
to experience the consequences of their decisions.  Cleaning up after an<br/>
accident is a consequence.  He learned that he didn&#39;t like having accidents<br/>
or cleaning them up, so he changed his behavior.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>
mean.<br/>

&gt; set them up with the consequences of their actions. I vacuumed their rooms<br/>
&gt; today. I did it because I was vacuuming the hall and I thought it would be<br/>
&gt; good to get their rooms while I had the vacuum cleaner up there. The other<br/>
&gt; day I went through an unpacked box, I didn&#39;t really unpack, I sort of piled<br/>
&gt; all the stuff up that was in it on the floor, in Simon&#39;s room. He didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; chastize me, or tell me that I had to clean the mess up I&#39;d made, instead he<br/>
&gt; cleaned it up, and then he helped his sister to clean her room. And not<br/>
&gt; because he had to, or she had to, but because she wanted her room to feel as<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; When Linnaea was 3 maybe, or almost 3, Simon decided she needed to be using<br/>
&gt; the toilet. I have no idea why, Simon didn&#39;t stop with diapers until we were<br/>
&gt; in Kyoto and he was 3 and a 1/2 and David had bought out all the diapers in<br/>
&gt; his size that he could find. He bribed her with candy. Again, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; why that worked, there was free access to candy in our house, but somehow<br/>
&gt; Simon giving her a piece of candy when she&#39;d used the toilet got her using<br/>
&gt; the toilet. As soon as he ran out of candy, she stopped using the toilet. We<br/>
&gt; got more candy in, but she was no longer willing to have him bribe her. She<br/>
&gt; did it on her own a few months later, no bribes, no consequences, just being<br/>
&gt; ready. And she didn&#39;t have to clean up after herself if she peed on the<br/>
&gt; floor or pooped. Nor did Simon, and both of them use the toilet just fine<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>

&gt; My son was almost 4 when he decided he wanted to wear underwear instead of<br/>
&gt; pullups. We handed him a bottle of upholstery cleaner and a rag and taught<br/>
&gt; him how to clean up after himself in case he had an accident. He thought it<br/>
&gt; was cool. But about a week, and several accidents later, he decided that<br/>
&gt; cleaning up after himself was too much trouble and he never had an accident<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was that coersive? I would say not. It was just showing him that decisions<br/>
&gt; have consequences and that we must adapt.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Joyce tells the story of Joyce&#39;s spilling a glass of milk on the floor. <br/>
Kat (pretty young) walks by and says to her, &quot;You made the mess, YOU <br/>
clean it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds completely different coming from the mouth of a child, <br/>
doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Children learn best by observing how their loved ones handle a <br/>
situation. Kat didn&#39;t just &quot;make that up.&quot; She&#39;d heard it come from the <br/>
lips of her mom and/or dad.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine many kids would be smacked for being so cheeky. Joyce, <br/>
however, got the BIG message: &quot;Is this how I wish to be treated? Is <br/>
this how I&#39;ve been treating her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce chose to make a change.<br/>
<br/>
I did too, after I read that years and years ago. It made a huge <br/>
impression on me too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I learned from Joyce&#39;s tale that I get to be the model for their <br/>
behavior. I could be helpful and generous and kind. Or I could just <br/>
say, &quot;That&#39;s life!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids hear that sooo much!  But honestly, it&#39;s not *OUR* life! OUR life <br/>
is about *helping* each other always and all ways.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t make it out to *be* mean--it probably seemed very <br/>
nice, and he was probably fine with it. It just sounds mean to *my* <br/>
(and probably many others&#39; here) ears/eyes. Because we got rid of that <br/>
thinking so long ago.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We never chastised him or complained or tried to make him use the <br/>
potty.  In<br/>
fact, we didn&#39;t make a big deal about it all.  He was using the potty <br/>
some<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
The thing is: it may or may not have been the reason he was out of <br/>
Pullups when he was. It may have been (and actually probably WAS) <br/>
simply because he was physically ready.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like when teachers push reading so long and so hard with <br/>
different tricks and incentives, and the child *finally* reads. Chances <br/>
are that the child would have read at that time *anyway* withOUT all <br/>
the pushing and bribing and coercion. It was just *time*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that when we unschool, we have to be willing to allow our <br/>
children<br/>
to experience the consequences of their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s assuming potty training is a &quot;decision.&quot; It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about <br/>
being *ready*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning up after an accident is a consequence.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not always. It&#39;s often a punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of dozens of examples of accidents that don&#39;t have cleaning <br/>
up as a consequence. It&#39;s just *one* of many possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He learned that he didn&#39;t like having accidents or cleaning them up, so <br/>
he changed his behavior.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s mean.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don&#39;t think using a toilet is about changing behavior. It&#39;s <br/>
about being physically ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131733612">Yes, I do know the difference between teaching and learning.<br/>
<br/>
But, my children -- and maybe it&#39;s just my kids -- but they don&#39;t learn<br/>
everything through watching me and others.  Here&#39;s an example:  I do the<br/>
laundry in the family, at least most of the time.  Sometimes my husband will<br/>
do a load or two.  I will not go into my son&#39;s room (he&#39;s 15) unless I<br/>
absolutely have to.  I&#39;m not a neat freak (I don&#39;t think), but I do like my<br/>
living space to be organized enough that I can find things, without a lot of<br/>
dirty dishes and trash on the floor.  That said, my son&#39;s room is his and he<br/>
can do with it what he wants.  I just find it too stressful to go in there.<br/>
So, I asked him a long time ago to bring his laundry downstairs for<br/>
washing.<br/>
<br/>
He learned that if he didn&#39;t bring his clothes down, they didn&#39;t get<br/>
washed.  Once as I was about to climb into bed exhausted after an extremely<br/>
hectic day, my son -- then about 12 -- came into my room panic stricken.  He<br/>
had to have a particular shirt for some activity he was participating in the<br/>
next day and he really wanted it washed.  Any other night, I would have been<br/>
happy to help, but this night I was fighting back tears, I was so tired.<br/>
So, I told him that I could not stay up to wash his clothes, but I would be<br/>
happy to show him how to do it, which I did.  He did a fine job, went to his<br/>
activity the next day in a clean shirt, and seemed quite happy about it all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he had seen me wash, dry, fold and put away clothes for 12 years, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think he had any clue as to how to go about it.  I showed him how to<br/>
do it.  Did I teach him?  Sure.  Did he learn?  Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I still do his laundry.  But probably every week or two, there&#39;s<br/>
something he wants washed for the next day.  He doesn&#39;t even ask me to do<br/>
it.  He just does it himself.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not necessarily. But my children would have felt as if I were<br/>
&gt; abandoning them and not helping them if *I* were to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your child seems to have enjoyed it for a while.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It sounds like you&#39;re saying<br/>
&gt; that when I teach my child to wash his dirty clothes or clean up the<br/>
&gt; spilled<br/>
&gt; milk that that&#39;s not part of the unschooling philosophy.<br/>

ideas that will work here are ideas that put the relationship first  <br/>

There&#39;s thousands of ideas that &quot;work&quot; for a family. But if someone  <br/>

Sure it&#39;s a punishment. A &quot;natural consequence&quot; happens without a<br/>
human being enforcing anything. When you make someone do something, in<br/>
order to teach them a lesson, there&#39;s nothing natural about it.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s an acceptable way to operate in the world, then why isn&#39;t it<br/>
acceptable for adults to do that to each other?<br/>

  It is like you are saying your ds is making a choice of having potty accidents.<br/>
  Lets say you spill pasta sauce all over the kitchen and your DH walks by and say:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417880657">when I started unschooling and this list I talked about how I would &quot;make&quot; my highly physical and spirited children clean up whatever she knocked over when she was angry- I was told how mean that was and I thought everyone was nuts- but then I read about the mom and the milk and others and I started cleaning things up and eventually (a few months) the girls started helping each other and me and themselves when they spilled something- <br/>
<br/>
sometimes it is implied that you did it you clean it up which to a child can be daunting- do they know they do not HAVE to clean it up or that you would help if they needed you to?<br/>

That&#39;s really sweet. If we think about how adults treat each other<br/>
(ideally anyway) and apply that to how we treat children (as far as<br/>
kindness and empathy) it goes a long way to helping us shift into<br/>
&quot;partner&quot; mode rather than &quot;teaching lessons&quot; mode.:)<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t like to be treated badly when I make mistakes, neither<br/>
do children. Are there really mistakes anyway? That&#39;s all part of<br/>
learning too...which is why I like Kelly&#39;s description of them as<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755370480">I guess you guys missed the part about my cleaning up the pee.  And, yes, I<br/>
am saying that he had a choice.  Using the potty was his idea.  Wearing<br/>
underwear was his idea.  He was and had been using the potty regularly for<br/>
some time, knew the cues and acted on them.  But, he would also just pee and<br/>
poop in his Pullup because he felt like it or because he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
leave the show he was watching.  (We noticed that this happened most often<br/>
in front of the TV).<br/>
<br/>
So, when he changed to underwear, I knew he was perfectly capable of not<br/>
peeing and pooping in his underwear.  I also figured that he would not<br/>
necessarily alter his behavior just because he was in underwear.  So, I gave<br/>
him the tools to take care of the issue until he decided not to pee on the<br/>
sofa.  During the week, he wet the sofa about once a day.  He&#39;d go get the<br/>
spray and the sponge and do his almost 4-year-old best at cleaning up, then<br/>
I or his dad would finish the job for him.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I&#39;m having is that for all but the smallest children, everything<br/>
is a choice.  In this case, I knew that my son was making a choice.  One of<br/>
the consequences of that choice was that it caused discomfort and<br/>
difficulties for the other members of the family.   Since we live in a<br/>
family unit, we encourage our kids to be sensitive to other members of the<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
 I see big difference between a child who chooses to pee on the sofa rather<br/>
than walk to the bathroom, and a child who accidently spills his milk.   If<br/>
I spilled a jar of spaghetti sauce on the floor, I&#39;d appreciate the help,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to help me clean it up.  If my husband peed on<br/>
the sofa I&#39;d expect him to clean it up, too.  If my roommate peed on the<br/>
sofa, I&#39;d expect him to clean it up.  I don&#39;t understand why unschooling<br/>
philosophy would expect it to work any differently with my children.<br/>

waking up wet on the sofa. He&#39;s 9.5. Choice? Really? Would Hayden *choose*<br/>
to pee on the sofa, creating extra work, extra laundry and extra angst?? I<br/>
know he doesn&#39;t -- he&#39;s *told* me so!!!  +I promise a kid would rather do<br/>
*anything* by choice than to have their accidents become cause for shame.<br/>
I&#39;ve had moments of not knowing the right thing to say & I&#39;ve erred on the<br/>
side of not being as kind and I could be. And I&#39;ve hurt his feelings -<br/>
deeply. For that I can only apologize and behave in ways that show I have<br/>
changed my thinking and that kind of injury will NOT happen again to us. We<br/>
use a crib liner & wool blanket (small enough to be totally portable) & wash<br/>
it every day it&#39;s wet. I&#39;ve got bacterial cleaner for the cushions, in case<br/>
of spillovers (or when I don&#39;t get the spot made up in time). We&#39;ve got a<br/>
$60 sofa; it&#39;d take A LOT more than $60 in therapy to recover from a mom who<br/>
shames accidents.<br/>
H helps out by picking up the wet bedding and putting it in the laundry<br/>
room; sometimes he remembers to pick up his wet pants and sometimes he<br/>
doesn&#39;t, I get them in the laundry room quickly, while I&#39;m cleaning cushions<br/>
and bringing them outside to dry. Yes, every day sometimes. Sometimes I<br/>
start out a martyr and figure out while scrubbing that my kid needs his<br/>
mama, not a martyr & the transformation is completed before the cleaning is<br/>
done! The days I&#39;m really proud of, are the ones where there martyr is not<br/>
even thought of!<br/>
<br/>
When my dad noticed how I handled Hayden&#39;s bedwetting, he came up with<br/>
heretofore unheard stories of his childhood and his own struggles with<br/>
bedwetting. He commented how shameful it was for his sister, who wet the bed<br/>
until she was 13; it was less bad for him, being the oldest and having it<br/>
self-resolve at about age 10.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at dietary connections (originally we thought it was linked to<br/>
yellow food coloring) and exhaustion levels (mostly happens when he totally<br/>
wiped out when he finally sleeps) and pee frequency (he&#39;s wet the bed after<br/>
a big pee before sleep!) -- He&#39;s declined goodnites (a negative connotation<br/>
from another friend who wears them) & is open to other ideas I may have<br/>
(because I&#39;m coming from a &quot;help you&quot; perspective, rather than a &quot;blame you&quot;<br/>
or &quot;fix you&quot; place). I picked up some homeopathic tabs today, I&#39;ll offer<br/>
them to him (a TRUE offer, if he declines, I&#39;m not attached) and see how<br/>
that goes. Regardless, I&#39;m honored to have the job of clean-up for the short<br/>
time it lasts.<br/>
<br/>
I see big difference between a child who chooses to pee on the sofa rather<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than walk to the bathroom, and a child who accidently spills his milk. If<br/>
&gt; I spilled a jar of spaghetti sauce on the floor, I&#39;d appreciate the help,<br/>
&gt; but I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to help me clean it up. If my husband peed on<br/>
&gt; the sofa I&#39;d expect him to clean it up, too. If my roommate peed on the<br/>
&gt; sofa, I&#39;d expect him to clean it up. I don&#39;t understand why unschooling<br/>
&gt; philosophy would expect it to work any differently with my children.<br/>
&gt; .,_._,___<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband did pee on his La-z-boy, often even (he was in diapers the last<br/>
4-5 weeks of his life). I treated it as one would expect, I cleaned it up<br/>
without shame or blame. He knew I had my hands full caring for him and our 2<br/>
& 4 year old children and working full-time - he would never, ever *choose*<br/>
to create more work for me.<br/>
The least I can do is treat his son with the same kindness I gave to him;<br/>
the same kindness Hayden already witnessed me extending to Mitch. (isn&#39;t<br/>
that why Mitch chose me to be the mother of his children?)<br/>

  We&#39;ve commented often to each other that one of the wisest parenting (and sanity!) decisions we&#39;ve made is to *not* replace our hand-me-down couch because I honestly wouldn&#39;t care if I came into the living room one morning and the girls had decided to cut it in half!  So we have lots of accidents and food spills on our couch and I simply don&#39;t care.  It&#39;s some kind of magic material that shows nothing.  My girls&#39; feelings are *alot* more important than how I feel about accidents/spills on our couch.<br/>

very infrequently. I finally figured out that it had to do with <br/>
having contact with his bio dad. That was very stressful for him <br/>
because his dad is not a reliable, honest person. He would promise <br/>
things and then not follow through. My ds would wet the bed the same <br/>
night he talked to his dad on the phone (which wasn&#39;t very often or <br/>
regular) and wet his bed again when the time came and went that his <br/>
dad has promised to do something. Whenever his dad was out of the <br/>

<br/>
But, my children -- and maybe it&#39;s just my kids -- but they don&#39;t learn<br/>
everything through watching me and others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They learn. But maybe not what you think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He learned that if he didn&#39;t bring his clothes down, they didn&#39;t get <br/>
washed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe he learned that *his* stuff isn&#39;t that important to you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Once as I was about to climb into bed exhausted after an extremely<br/>
hectic day, my son -- then about 12 -- came into my room panic <br/>
stricken.  He<br/>
had to have a particular shirt for some activity he was participating <br/>
in the<br/>
next day and he really wanted it washed.  Any other night, I would have <br/>
been<br/>
happy to help, but this night I was fighting back tears, I was so tired.<br/>
So, I told him that I could not stay up to wash his clothes, but I <br/>
would be<br/>
happy to show him how to do it, which I did.  He did a fine job, went <br/>
to his<br/>
activity the next day in a clean shirt, and seemed quite happy about it <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too tired to DO it, but not too tired to show him how?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s seems so much easier for *me* to just DO it than to show someone <br/>
how. That *always* takes me longer. But I do that a lot because they <br/>
want to know.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now, he had seen me wash, dry, fold and put away clothes for 12 years, <br/>
but I<br/>
don&#39;t think he had any clue as to how to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Most 12 year olds have no need of washing clothes. That&#39;s what they <br/>
have moms for! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old still loves for me to clean his room and fix his supper <br/>
and wash his clothes. He can *do* all of that, but none of those things <br/>
are priorities for him. He&#39;s much more interested in whatever he&#39;s <br/>
doing. He&#39;s busy doing what 12 year olds do.<br/>
<br/>
They kind of &quot;age into&quot; a lot of things. They learn because it&#39;s <br/>
important to them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son&#39;s need of clean clothes was important enough for him to <br/>
learn. That&#39;s natural.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I showed him how to do it.  Did I teach him?  Sure.  Did he learn?  <br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
But did you make him learn to do laundry or did he choose to learn to <br/>
do laundry?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a little of both.<br/>
<br/>
But if he hadn&#39;t have wanted to, how many &quot;lessons&quot; do you think it <br/>
would have taken?<br/>

1)  My youngest had a very hard time potty training (very resistant<br/>
until he decided to do it himself ... imagine that!), but finally<br/>
achieved success at school, but spotty success at home.  He just<br/>
gets very &quot;into&quot; what he is doing and misses the bodily cues that he<br/>
needs to go.  Anyway, since we have pulled them out of school (a few<br/>
weeks ago) he has decided that he just wants to wear a pull-up.  Is<br/>
this ok?  I feel that it is, but I guess I just need some reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s OK.  Feel reassured? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told the story here about how *I* get too involved in what I&#39;m <br/>
doing in the garden, so I &quot;drop trou&quot; in my yard and pee right *there*. <br/>
And I&#39;m 47. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should look into Depends. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously---he&#39;s only four. If he&#39;s comfortable in something so simple, <br/>
what&#39;s the problem? I promis he won&#39;t go to college in pull-ups. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2)  I enjoy letting the boys stay up later than they used to.  I<br/>
feel that it is really great family time, since they get to spend<br/>
more time with their dad when he gets home from work.  However, my<br/>
husband feels that we are losing our husband/wife time and that life<br/>
is getting too focused on the boys, to the detriment of our<br/>
marriage.  Has anyone experienced these feelings with their spouse?<br/>
What have you done?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get up early. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My son was almost 4 when he decided he wanted to wear underwear instead <br/>
of<br/>
pullups.  We handed him a bottle of upholstery cleaner and a rag and <br/>
taught<br/>
him how to clean up after himself in case he had an accident.  He <br/>
thought it<br/>
was cool.  But about a week, and several accidents later, he decided <br/>
that<br/>
cleaning up after himself was too much trouble and he never had an <br/>
accident<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Was that coersive?  I would say not.  It was just showing him that <br/>
decisions<br/>
have consequences and that we must adapt.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can look back in a few months and see that it *is* coercive.<br/>

I guess you guys missed the part about my cleaning up the pee.  And, <br/>
yes, I<br/>
am saying that he had a choice.  Using the potty was his idea.  Wearing<br/>
underwear was his idea.  He was and had been using the potty regularly <br/>
for<br/>
some time, knew the cues and acted on them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Obviously not.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But, he would also just pee and<br/>
poop in his Pullup because he felt like it or because he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
leave the show he was watching.  (We noticed that this happened most <br/>
often<br/>
in front of the TV).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Tivo.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So, when he changed to underwear, I knew he was perfectly capable of not<br/>
peeing and pooping in his underwear.  I also figured that he would not<br/>
necessarily alter his behavior just because he was in underwear.  So, I <br/>
gave<br/>
him the tools to take care of the issue until he decided not to pee on <br/>
the<br/>
sofa.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So...he was deciding to purposefully pee on the sofa?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The problem I&#39;m having is that for all but the smallest children, <br/>
everything<br/>
is a choice.  In this case, I knew that my son was making a choice.  <br/>
One of<br/>
the consequences of that choice was that it caused discomfort and<br/>
difficulties for the other members of the family.   Since we live in a<br/>
family unit, we encourage our kids to be sensitive to other members of <br/>
the<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unless he&#39;s three and peeing on the sofa?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I see big difference between a child who chooses to pee on the sofa <br/>
rather<br/>
than walk to the bathroom, and a child who accidently spills his milk.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because the first one did it on purpose?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I spilled a jar of spaghetti sauce on the floor, I&#39;d appreciate the <br/>
help,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to help me clean it up.  If my husband <br/>
peed on<br/>
the sofa I&#39;d expect him to clean it up, too.  If my roommate peed on the<br/>
sofa, I&#39;d expect him to clean it up.  I don&#39;t understand why unschooling<br/>
philosophy would expect it to work any differently with my children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why &quot;accidentally&quot; seems so much like &quot;on purpose&quot; <br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
The deal is: they&#39;re CHILDREN. They&#39;re still learning. Their bodies are <br/>
still developing.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s peeing on the sofa on purpose, that&#39;s different than being <br/>
under-developed.<br/>
<br/>
He *still* needs your help either way. Not to clean up, but to keep the <br/>
sofa dry in the first place.<br/>
