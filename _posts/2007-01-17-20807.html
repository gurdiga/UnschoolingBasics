<div id="ygrps-yiv-186677898">hey markus there are alot of 13 yr olds on ( my son included)<br/>
we usually play around 7pm eastern us time, I usually do a general post <br/>
like 42 unschoolers ( the current # in the guild) and hope unschoolers <br/>
whisper back so I can invite them <br/>
if you see any unschoolers in game ( horde of unschoolers shows up in <br/>
their name area they can all invite<br/>
 if this doesn&#39;t work tell me your names and when likely on I&#39;ll check <br/>
for you or mail me in game I&#39;m iconoclast<br/>
