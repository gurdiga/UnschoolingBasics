Hi Valerie,<br/>
<br/>
Emma has just turned 5 and she doesn&#39;t want to give up any of her toys.  I&#39;ve <br/>
tried, on the occassions that I have a clean up/organize day in her room, to <br/>
pare down to just the toys she plays with regularly....talked about donating <br/>
to Goodwill, or to younger friends but she never wants to get rid of any of <br/>
them.  She has on a couple of occassions given toys to younger friends, but for <br/>
the most part, she says she loves them all and likes to just look at them even <br/>
if she doesn&#39;t play with them.  I&#39;m hoping that this is just a &#39;stage&#39; : )  <br/>
She&#39;s not developed any real deep empathy for others yet...it&#39;s still mostly <br/>
about her.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know you&#39;re in Lake Charles!  I discovered your book from hearing it <br/>
mentioned on one of the lists.  Bought it and and then devoured it in one night <br/>
actually!   Our little unschooling clan here thought it really cool that we <br/>
were practically neighborswith you...and were/are in total awe thinking of you <br/>
unschooling during the time when there was absolutely no support available.  <br/>
When we grumble about there being a lack of unschoolers in the area, I think of <br/>
you...back then in Lake Charles, of all places!  You were really a pioneer!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Denise<br/>

<br/>
Jayn (4.5) is like this also, although I doubt that it is a stage as dh is<br/>
exactly the same about keeping stuff. We even still have her infant toys put<br/>
somewhat away in a box. She is adamant about keeping them. Then of course if<br/>
we have a baby visitor, as occurs often, she is so delighted to be able to<br/>
get them out for the baby. <br/>
<br/>
I notice that Jayn returns to her toys after a period of time, sometimes<br/>
after more than a year. She will suddenly, spurred by I don&#39;t know what,<br/>
just ask where such-and-such is. I keep her toys and tiny accessories<br/>
organized by using two different sizes of Ziploc bags and do a lot of<br/>
categorizing with her. It helps her find stuff. She is also gradually mixing<br/>
her different types of toys more and more in her games. Our house is a bit<br/>
of a haven for other kids whose parents don&#39;t give them stuff on principle.<br/>
However we don&#39;t have so much stuff that Jayn can&#39;t find it when she wants<br/>
it. I only buy her toys she asks for, not extras.<br/>
<br/>
Having lots of ready made toys does not stop Jayn from wanting to be<br/>
creative, an argument I sometimes hear in non-unschooling circles. Jayn<br/>
still likes to make paper dolls and figures, and is really into creating<br/>
doll furniture from ordinary household objects and packaging materials. <br/>
<br/>
We are beginning to sew clothes for her Barbies also. I will bring the crazy<br/>
hat she designed and we made together to the conference. If anyone would<br/>
appreciate it, it would be you guys. I have gotten a few odd looks from<br/>
members of the public when wearing it, but Jayn is so proud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035840909">Hi Denise and thank you for the plug for my book. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Emma will get tired of looking at them some day and you&#39;ll <br/>
be able to see the floor again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you impulse shop too? (I used to be BAD at it). If <br/>
you are, then maybe if she saw you donating to Goodwill or others, <br/>
she&#39;d follow your lead. Just a thought. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
