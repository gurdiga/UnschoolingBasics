<div id="ygrps-yiv-167580581">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this list today. I live in beautiful NZ, have Daniel (just<br/>
turned 11yrs) and Flynn (2.5yrs).  We are 6 months into our trailblazing<br/>
brand new life, and I am feeling some really uncomfy feelings coming up.<br/>
Need a group like this to speak my anxieties into!  I did find the<br/>
unschooling message board (sandra Dodd) and she recommended this list. I<br/>
don;t know if many people are on both lists, so I apologise if the below is<br/>
a repeat to anyone!<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am hitting so many brick walls with Daniel at the moment, and<br/>
just wanted to ask for some advice, reflections, ways thru etc.<br/>
<br/>
I took Dan out of a Steiner School 6 months ago.  He had been asking for a<br/>
while.  I finally listened.  He is happy to be out, but does miss some<br/>
aspects of school - mainly social although god knows that could be a total<br/>
disaster alot of the time too!  Now, so often he says he doesn&#39;t really want<br/>
to do anything. Then he says that he is bored and why don&#39;t we do anything.<br/>
I suggest things, and he either loses steam just outside of the starting<br/>
gates or never ever finishes them. He tells me what he is interested in<br/>
doing, gets half way thru and drops it. Bookwork leaves him cold. We haven&#39;t<br/>
done anything at all in that way in the last 6 months.  He does do a few<br/>
classes with other homeschoolers - all his choice - he does French (doesn&#39;t<br/>
do anything outside the class), Sport and Technology(not computers, more<br/>
engineering stuff). he likes these.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel has problems with handwriting (if he was labelled, he would prob be<br/>
labelled with dysgraphia - very high reading level, but crappy speller), and<br/>
so getting him to do anything in that vein is very very hard. It makes him<br/>
feel bad - I think a hangover from school, felt like a real failure in the<br/>
writing dept. He has hardly handwritten a thing in the past 6 months - he<br/>
seemed to hold so much pain around it. I did take him to a kinesiologist (as<br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned) and we saw some improvements in his writing in a short time,<br/>
but now he says he hates doing the exercises, and its always such a mission<br/>
to get him to do them (I&#39;m only talking 5-7 mins here - not half an hour!)<br/>
<br/>
I do have some tension in me about the whole ERO review (whenever that may<br/>
come - here in NZ the education review office reviews you sometime in the<br/>
first 3 years - you never know when its coming, you get 3 weeks notice...),<br/>
and I think some of this has leaked out onto him (damn - I&#39;m not perfect). I<br/>
have said that I need to have some way to &quot;document&quot; what he is learning<br/>
about.... and that that doesn;t have to mean essays and reports - it might<br/>
mean a website of stuff which records what he has been doing that week. <br/>
<br/>
He says he needs to move all the time, that he just can&#39;t stay still.<br/>
Anything that smacks of schoolwork / bookwork just turns him off. I can just<br/>
see his energy leaking out of him if we even get close to doing something<br/>
like this.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am doing a crappy job just now and often feel like I don&#39;t<br/>
really know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him what he would really like to be doing. He says reading (he LOVES<br/>
reading fiction and reads voraciously) playing with his friends, playing<br/>
computer games and bike riding. That&#39;s about all he wants to do. Oh, and he<br/>
occasionally does delve into writing science fantasy short stories a&#39; la&#39;<br/>
Anne McCaffery Pern series kind of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I find most difficult is the moochingness that he displays. Like<br/>
he is at this major loose end and I have to fix it. Its really challenging.<br/>
I have to work hard not to get pissed off with him sometimes. I hate<br/>
moodiness and just find that kind of &quot;frozen&quot; mood he gets in hard. (guess<br/>
he does too) Arrgghh!<br/>
<br/>
I have a very wilful 2.5yr old as well, and this does place limits on what<br/>
we can and can&#39;t do. He interfere&#39;s with absolutely everything!! And, Dan<br/>
goes crazy with that!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to learn more about how he learns best. I just feel so lost<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
What did you do with your kids?? And with yourself? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening and look forward to hearing from you,<br/>
<br/>
 Hilary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540299039">Hi Hilary -<br/>
<br/>
We need a collection of stories about kids who can&#39;t spell, have <br/>
horrible penmanship, and are still &quot;turn out fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of them out there. Spelling and penmanship are about the <br/>
two most unimportant aspects of &quot;schooling&quot; that there are and also the <br/>
two that parents worry about far far far too much.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling and penmanship (printing or cursive) are simply not important <br/>
enough to spend 5 minutes a year worrying about!<br/>
<br/>
Stop thinking about school subjects. Just think about what Daniel DOES <br/>
like to do and support more of that, to the degree he is interested. Do <br/>
not &quot;get him to do&quot; anything at all. HELP him do anything fun for him. <br/>
Does he like sports? Then offer some more sports opportunities. Video <br/>
games? Get new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I wish with all my heart that he could meet and really get to know all <br/>
the wonderful people in the world who are poor spellers and writers but <br/>
are out there pursuing their life&#39;s passions with gusto and love. If <br/>
you think those are somehow critical for all children to learn, you&#39;ve <br/>
been fed a lie and you&#39;ve swallowed it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t pick the things he&#39;s NOT good at or interested in to pay <br/>
attention to - you&#39;re looking in the wrong direction and that makes YOU <br/>
part of his problem. You need to be looking, all the time, at what <br/>
might interest him NOW. And please, YOU need to stop seeing him as a <br/>
failure because he was a bad fit with his school.  He&#39;s not a bad fit <br/>
with LIFE - not if you let him live his OWN life - help him find it.<br/>
<br/>
School is nonsense. Schooling is nonsense. It is all a complete huge <br/>
gigantic hoax played on parents. It is unnecessary - completely totally <br/>
absolutely unnecessary - for kids to learn what they claim to teach in <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
Please help him - let him deschool in peace while you learn about <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Read Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting.&quot; Read John <br/>
Holt. Read these lists and the unschooling message boards. Watch him, <br/>
love him, help him do what he wants to do no matter what it is. Offer, <br/>
gently, nonschoolish things that you think he might want to do - go <br/>
surfing, skateboarding, take a trip, rent movies, whatever....nothing <br/>
school-like and nothing intended to somehow &quot;get him to&quot; learn some <br/>
schoolish thing. That&#39;s manipulation. Don&#39;t do it. Be totally authentic <br/>
with him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What if you did an &quot;intense&quot; period of deschooling.  Take him out of <br/>
all the classes altogether.  No French, no technology, nothing that <br/>
resembles school or coursework.  And then just play.  Play video <br/>
games, watch tv or videos, listen to music, go oustide and explore <br/>
bugs crawling in the grass.  <br/>
<br/>
Not finishing projects is common in humans.  Some of us have a <br/>
million half-finished projects.  I&#39;m one of those.  It isn&#39;t the <br/>
creating something it is the creating that I am interested in.  It&#39;s <br/>
sort of like once I have figured out how to do something I am ready <br/>
to move on.  I&#39;m a rubberstamp artist and I&#39;m never content unless I <br/>
am learning a new technique or style or paper craft.  Once I&#39;ve <br/>
learned and fairly mastered something I&#39;m ready to move on.  Daniel <br/>
may be like that.  He&#39;s figured out how it is done and now he is <br/>
ready to move on.<br/>
<br/>
If he enjoys the engineering aspect, does he have toys/tools that <br/>
facilitate that?  Does he have Legos, Lincoln Logs, Erector Sets, <br/>
K&#39;nex, etc?  What about having him design and build a play house in <br/>
your yard?    Maybe for your younger child?  Just ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4879255">Hi, Hilary!  Let me first say, &quot;Way to go for listening to Daniel&#39;s <br/>
request to leave school!&quot;  It is so wonderful that you are in tune <br/>
with him and willing to listen to his needs.  That is SO difficult <br/>
for most parents to do.  Heck, we are brought up to give orders to <br/>
our children and not think of them as young adults and fellow <br/>
humans.  Congrats on taking the first step!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of normal things.  Have <br/>
you thought about the fact that you will also need to deschool <br/>
yourself?  I would suggest reading any unschooling books you can get <br/>
your hands on.  This is great for boosting your confidence in the <br/>
decision you have made for you and your family. I recommend, &quot;The <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; for a real perspective of school.  <br/>
Also, read about the history of school.  It will make your hair <br/>
stand on end!  It might also be a good idea to subscribe to an <br/>
unschooling magazine.  Find something that you like to do, and do <br/>
it.  One of the most difficult things for me in the beginning was <br/>
realizing that I lead by example, therefore I get to do what I want <br/>
to do as well!  What a joyous revelation!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if your son doesn&#39;t want to write.  My son has only <br/>
written anything one time in the past year that I can think of.  He <br/>
is 11 this month, and is ambedextrious.  He finds it frustrating and <br/>
too time consuming to bother with.  Sometimes he expresses an <br/>
interest in typing, other times he doesn&#39;t.  He&#39;s a wonderful <br/>
reader, and he reads WAY quicker than myself.  BUT, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
actually like to read.  He does like to listen to a good story, <br/>
though.  So, we listen to books on CD, or I read to him.  He just <br/>
loves it.  Try to remember that something is only important to us if <br/>
we need to know it and use it right now.  When we need and want to <br/>
learn something relevant to our life, you would be amazed at how <br/>
fast it gets accomplished!<br/>
<br/>
I second Pam&#39;s suggestion of not paying attention to Daniel&#39;s <br/>
weaknesses.  Unschooling is all about strengths and likes.  Go with <br/>
those.  It&#39;s okay if he wants to spend all day looking out the <br/>
window, playing video games, watching television, playing on the <br/>
comuputer, or even sleeping.  Don&#39;t forget to join him sometimes.  <br/>
Life is not broken up into educational and non-educational <br/>
segments.  We learn from everything.  Don&#39;t waste your time trying <br/>
to find the educational benefit in something.  You&#39;ll be <br/>
continuously amazed once you start figuring the process out and <br/>
seeing your children blossom and become brilliant, confident, well-<br/>
adjusted individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Try real hard not to fret over what Daniel spends his time doing.  <br/>
Also, find a coping strategy for yourself in dealing with his <br/>
moodiness.  This is something that I am still working on with <br/>
Adrian.  He is VERY opinionated, outspoken, perfectionistic and what <br/>
I consider highly-sensitive.  (You may benefit from reading, &quot;The <br/>
Highly Sensitive Child&quot;)  This makes for a very moody child.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t take much to get him irritated.  I work very hard at not <br/>
letting this get to me, but I do let him know when I just can&#39;t <br/>
handle listening to his ranting and complaining, politely of <br/>
course.  Once you start to understand Daniel&#39;s personality a little <br/>
deeper you will be able to communicate and live with him much more <br/>
effectively.  Also, he will become more comfortable being himself <br/>
and these negative bouts will decrease in occurance.  BTW - It&#39;s <br/>
very nice to know that I am not alone in the world dealing with this <br/>
one! :)<br/>
<br/>
As far as record keeping goes there are bits of information out <br/>
there that help you to learn how to convert his daily activities <br/>
into &quot;school language&quot; for reporting and such.  You might like to <br/>
try keeping a daily journal on the computer.  I used to use a <br/>
software program specifically for keeping school records.  I lost <br/>
over a year and a half&#39;s worth of information when my computer <br/>
crashed, so don&#39;t forget to save it to disc on a regular basis.  I <br/>
currently have no records, save my first journal entry from <br/>
yesterday.  I&#39;ve decided that journaling will be a much more <br/>
effective way of &quot;record keeping&quot; if for no other reason to enjoy <br/>
looking back on my son&#39;s interests and explorations.<br/>
<br/>
It might help you to have an example of my 11 year old son&#39;s day.  <br/>
He stays up until between midnight and 2am.  He sleeps until 11am.  <br/>
Some have trouble with that, but yet another benefit of unschooling <br/>
is listening to and meeting our personal needs.  He loves being up <br/>
late because it&#39;s quiet and his pets, one gecko and two hamsters, <br/>
are nocturnal.  He likes to watch the gecko hunt.  During the day he <br/>
either plays PS2, watches DVD&#39;s on Dinosaurs or just hangs out with <br/>
me.  That&#39;s where he is right now.  He just joined a bowling <br/>
league.  I was totally shocked!  This child has NEVER had any <br/>
interest in anything resembling a sport.  We do go on outings by <br/>
ourselves and with local HS groups.  His favorite hangout with me is <br/>
to go to lunch and a movie.  He&#39;s totally into computer graphics and <br/>
currently wants to design video games for a living.  On occassion he <br/>
expresses a concern that he doesn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; math.  I tell him that we <br/>
have resources available if he&#39;s interested, but he never pursues <br/>
them.  Little does he know how much math he does in his daily <br/>
activities.  I&#39;m okay with that, more so than he is probably.<br/>
<br/>
Hilary, please remember that you have made a wonderful decision for <br/>
your family.  You couldn&#39;t have chosen a more liberating lifestyle.  <br/>
Keep &quot;educating&quot; yourself.  Keep searching.  Keep dreaming.  Keep <br/>
pursuing your interests, and mostly keep yourself available to your <br/>
children, and relax.  You will see amazing things happen over the <br/>
next weeks, months and years to come.  If you ever want to chat <br/>
about 11 year old boys feel free to email me personally.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your journey...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-211315452">Hilary - Hey and welcome to this list!  Our son is 12 and our dd is 10.<br/>
George and Nola play a game on line called runescape. (www.runescape.com)<br/>
I&#39;ll let the two of you check it out on your own.   If that appeals to your<br/>
son, tell him to add superman5606 and effie5413 to his friends list--those<br/>
are my kids.  My kids are on there off and on all day, but if they keep<br/>
missing each other, email  us and tell us what time to &quot;meet&quot; him there.<br/>
We&#39;ve found websites that help us convert time zones!  I mention Runescape<br/>
enthusiatically because my kids love it and they are learning so much from<br/>
playing.   I credit that game with the improvement in Nola&#39;s spelling, and<br/>
both kids type fast now, but that&#39;s just the start of what they are taking<br/>
away from that game.   They have to type to be able to communicate with<br/>
other players, but spelling correctly isn&#39;t necessary!  The other players<br/>
will get the idea.<br/>
    Having said that, I also want to tell you that we stopped doing anything<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; about two years ago.   My kids don&#39;t do anything that looks<br/>
remotely like school work.  I think it&#39;s fun when people tell me my kids are<br/>
&quot;so smart!&quot;   Especially when it comes form someone that wouldn&#39;t approve of<br/>
my kids watching as much tv as they do.   LOL<br/>
     I think you and your son need a summer vacation.  One that never ends!<br/>
Who cares if he doesn&#39;t finish what he starts?  Neither do I, a lot of the<br/>
time.  If whatever he is trying gets boring, then he needs to quit doing it<br/>
and find something else!   It&#39;s gonna take him some practice to decide how<br/>
to spend his time and energy.  He&#39;s had so many decisions made for him by<br/>
the school!     What he needs now is lots of control, so he can get back in<br/>
touch with what he feels like doing, what he enjoys.  Don&#39;t make him go to<br/>
his classes if he doesn&#39;t feel like it that day.   And I would definitely<br/>
stop working on his handwriting!!  His brain isn&#39;t ready for it, just leave<br/>
it alone for a couple of years and see what things look like then.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think he needs to be able to write anything until he&#39;s old enough to sign<br/>
checks. LOL     I use my husband as an example:  even he can&#39;t read his own<br/>
handwriting, and he can&#39;t spell.   But he says that&#39;s what computers and<br/>
spell-checker programs are for!   He practices law and runs 4 other<br/>
companies, so I can honestly say it hasn&#39;t slowed him down.<br/>
   I guess you&#39;ll have to find some other folks who unschool in NZ and ask<br/>
about how to handle the review.  You aren&#39;t the only ones there!  My only<br/>
advise about that review is that you need to take care of your son first and<br/>
make the paperwork follow you, not the other way around.  I hope you can<br/>
minimize how much control that review has over your son.<br/>
    As to your son&#39;s bad moods, and, well, everything about your son:  It&#39;s<br/>
so hard for the rest of us to know why he&#39;s not cheerful, since we aren&#39;t<br/>
right there.  I can sympathize with you having to be around someone in a<br/>
blue funk, and I hope you can sympathize with your son.  Make sure he&#39;s<br/>
eating whenever he&#39;s hungry and getting plenty of sleep at night.  And try<br/>
to help him get in touch with what he feels he wants or needs, then help him<br/>
obtain it.  If I were him, I would need some space from the toddler--bet you<br/>
could use a break from Flynn occassionally as well.  Toddlers are so cool,<br/>
but they are also hard work.<br/>
    Gee this is a long post.  Hope there&#39;s something here that&#39;s useful to<br/>
you!  Good luck!  Deirdre<br/>

My daughter has been &quot;diagnosed&quot; as ADHD, but I think it&#39;s more the <br/>
above.  Her handwriting is illegible, spelling horrible, but learns <br/>
words well visually (forget phoenics).  We&#39;ll be starting <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling in the fall (she&#39;s in 6th grade, middle <br/>
school here is horrible).<br/>

about handwriting when they can learn to type (and spellcheck).  If <br/>
she doesn&#39;t know how to spell a word, she asks me.  This way she <br/>
learns it correctly from the beginning, she has trouble figuring it <br/>
out for herself (visual/spatial.....).   She has a wonderful <br/>
vocabulary (alot because I utilize interesting words).  She&#39;s a lot <br/>
like my husband, I&#39;m very different in my learning style.  I&#39;ve <br/>
learned alot about them by reading, reasearching etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
There a lots of other chat groups on yahoo, check out Sandra Dodd&#39;s <br/>
sight often.  She has wonderful information.<br/>
