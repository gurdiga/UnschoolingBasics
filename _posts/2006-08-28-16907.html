<div id="ygrps-yiv-315638745">Hello,<br/>
I am new to this group and haven&#39;t had a chance for an introduction <br/>
yet, but really needed some advice.<br/>
My son is 2 and we had to take him to the E.R. last night.  They <br/>
diagnosed him with pnuemonia and gave him an inhaler on top of his <br/>
medication.  It really helps, he feels so much better once he uses <br/>
it.  The problem is he hates it.  We need to hold his arms and hands <br/>
to get him to use.  I don&#39;t feel good about that.  We had a really <br/>
bad night and morning, and he went to his doctor.  It turns out he <br/>
also has asthma, which I have suspected.  They put him on a  <br/>
nebulizer treatment, which he hates even more than the inhaler.  <br/>
With this he has to breate mist medicine for 6 minutes!  Again we <br/>
have to hold him and he is screaming and crying.  It is very <br/>
stressful for him.  I feel awful.<br/>
Does anyone have an suggestions on a how an unschooling parent can <br/>
handle this so it is easier on him.  I do need to stress he need the <br/>
medication.  It is helping him breathe.<br/>
Any thoughts are appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does this have a mouthpiece that goes in his mouth or does he have a<br/>
full mask that he has to have over his mouth and nose?  Could he<br/>
switch from what he has to the other?  Poor baby, he is only 2 and he<br/>
probably doesn&#39;t  understand what is going on nor associates the<br/>
breathing treatments/nebulizer with breathing easier.<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked to his doctor about alternatives for now?  What about<br/>
a humidifier with medications in it?  An oral medication that might<br/>
help?  What about after his pneumonia is cleared?  How will they<br/>
manage his asthma?  What are his triggers and can  you reduce/get rid<br/>
of those?  What would be the result of him not using these breathing<br/>
treatments?  Would it mean life and death or would it just mean a<br/>
longer recovery period?  Is there a dose of Mucinex that he could take<br/>
(that stuff truly kicked my pneumonia in the butt the last time I had<br/>
it!)?  Working with him and his doctors to find a manageable treatment<br/>
is going to build trust.  Holding him down and forcing medications<br/>
down him if they aren&#39;t life and death is NOT!<br/>
<br/>
A few years back one of my daughters had a UTI.  The doctor prescribed<br/>
some nasty tasting medicine for it.  The next day I called in and<br/>
asked for something different.  Not because it wasn&#39;t working but<br/>
because it made her gag so much she would nearly throw up and started<br/>
refusing to take it.  Does no good if they won&#39;t take it, so you have<br/>
to find something different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86272115">Well, my personal experiences with asthma are about 20 years old, and  <br/>
recently with a friends son, but I do know that most medications have  <br/>
multiple forms and varying ways of application. I would highly  <br/>
suggest that you speak with the dr, because he *is* so young they  <br/>
have perhaps better ways for him to take the medication. Are there  <br/>
shorter misters, more intense but take less time, is there anyway to  <br/>
divide it up, is there a chewable medicine that can be long lasting  <br/>
and the nebulizer be just for emergencies (which he should be doing  <br/>
anyway). Along with this, there should be lots and lots of empathy  <br/>
(&quot;I know this sucks, but I don&#39;t know what else we can do&quot;, or &quot;When  <br/>
we&#39;re done here, lets get french fries&quot;) As a customer of their  <br/>
services, you have a lot more rights than many drs will let on, and  <br/>
there are so many ways to manage asthma. You might also go for a  <br/>
second opinion with a specialist rather than an ER or a ped. You will  <br/>
get a lot more experience and options with that as well.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes!  I meant to mention something about this.  There is a HUGE<br/>
difference from someone having asthma and someone having asthmatic<br/>
reactions to allergies (or colds).  And how your son&#39;s body is<br/>
reacting to pneumonia may not be a good indicator of whether or not he<br/>
is truly asthmatic!  Most children who are diagnosed &quot;asthmatic&quot;<br/>
actually have allergies which cause asthmatic responses.  They don&#39;t<br/>
get short winded when they exercise or have unrelated breathing<br/>
issues.  They may get wheezy when they are around things that trigger<br/>
their allergies (dogs, cats, grass, molds, yeasts, dust, smog, smoke,<br/>
flowers, Yankee Peddler Candles :) )  but the rest of the time they<br/>
are fine.  It&#39;s a science of controlling the allergens rather than<br/>
reacting to a crisis (especially if the crisis can be avoided!)<br/>
<br/>
I have a great doctor who set me straight on asthma.  As someone who<br/>
has had asthma since I was a young child I thought that my son also<br/>
had asthma.  Then we realized that his &quot;asthma&quot; was related to the<br/>
fresh mown grass(had an &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment at a baseball game).<br/>

I would strongly, strongly recommend you do research on alternatives.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying he doesn&#39;t need treatment; breathing&#39;s one of those<br/>
non-compromise things. =) But I am definitely saying that allopathy is<br/>
NOT the only way of treating a body&#39;s illness, and sometimes, is not<br/>
the best way either. The treatment he&#39;s getting is curing his<br/>
symptoms, but it&#39;s not addressing the underlying cause of why he&#39;s got<br/>
either condition.<br/>
<br/>
Check out your local acupuncturist, your homeopath, your herbalist.<br/>
Your ayurvedic practicioner, should you live in a place where you<br/>
might find one. The vast majority of the world&#39;s people have faced the<br/>
same sorts of illnesses and diseases we do, without allopathy, and<br/>
have done just fine.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite starting resource is &quot;Smart Medicine for a Healthier<br/>
Child&quot; by Janet Zand, Robert Rountree, and Rachel Walton. For each<br/>
illness, they list the allopathic, herbal, dietary,<br/>
acupuncture/acupressure, and homeopathic treatments. There are<br/>
sections on pneumonia and on asthma which I just looked up.<br/>
<br/>
I know that for my older son as a two-year old, the challenge of<br/>
holding the homeopathic balls under his tongue until they dissolved<br/>
was fabulously cool; especially since he&#39;d often get more when those<br/>
were gone. =)  And brewing medicinal herbal teas is great fun for a<br/>
child, as is sitting and reading a special book while the tea is<br/>
sipped, the vapors breathed.<br/>

parts of his lungs...in case you don&#39;t find a solution quickly and <br/>
easily :-) That might make you feel better until you find a solution <br/>
that eliminates the crying!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I bet one could spend a lot less time using a nebulizer if <br/>
one were taking those deep breaths necessary for crying...I think I <br/>
will find a respiratory therapist to ask... LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446541398">Hi everyone. I have a question. I have ony been homeschooling for two years and those were split up by the children going back to public school for a year in between. I love the idea of unschooling and have started the deschooling &quot;part&quot; of it, I&#39;m worried though. My oldest is 14 and just seems to have no ambition when it comes to learning. He will do more structured learning online when asked but when given the chance, he chooses not to do anything on his own.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yr old daughter Is the same way except fights me when it comes to learning at all. She is ADHD and I am beginning to suspect possible Dyslexia and/or Dyscalcula. <br/>
<br/>
My youngerst,6 yrs., Is the only one that seems to want to learn on his own. I&#39;m eally worried that the Board of Ed where I live will have something to say about this b/c it seems as though they aren&#39;t learning anything, especiall Math and English. We are under an umbrella school, but I can rarely get a hold of them and I haven&#39;t been keeping any kind of journal as to what they are doing b/c it&#39;s little to nothing. I&#39;m not sure what to do at this point to encoursge them to want to learn.</div>

<br/>
What you&#39;re seeing is totally normal for people who haven&#39;t been the authors of their own learning - a product of teaching. They *will* rediscover how to enjoy learning and self-motivate, but to do that they need some time and they need help of a kind that&#39;s challenging to most parents - they need you to step back from the idea that learning is something you direct or guide or even &quot;encourage&quot; them in. Learning is a something natural that people do - humans Love to learn! But schooling diminishes that love. This is what deschooling is about! Finding the natural love of learning all over again. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure what to do at this point to encoursge them to want to learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The absolute best thing you can do is give them a break. Let them decompress however works best for them, even if it seems like they do nothing at all. Offer to do things that are &quot;just for fun&quot; no learning agenda. Let them watch tv and play games and chill out. They Need to chill out! While they&#39;re doing that, you can be educating yourself about what it means to learn naturally - it doesn&#39;t look like schooling! It doesn&#39;t even necessarily look like &quot;unit studies&quot;. Here&#39;s a good place to start, with more links to more good things to read at the bottom of the page:<br/>

The beauty of unschooling is that those don&#39;t have to be roadblocks for her. Everyone learns a little differently, and if her way of learning about the world is that much more idiosyncratic, its not such a big deal as long as she&#39;s finding what works for her. A certain amount of all the three things you list above can be a result of schooling - I&#39;m not saying they &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; but schooling can also turn perfectly normal kid behavior and variances into Issues. <br/>
<br/>
My 8yo has a certain amount of dyslexia, for example, but it doesn&#39;t hinder her. I&#39;m not even sure it effects her reading, although it shows up when she writes. She&#39;s not being graded on her writing, she writes for pleasure and to communicate with people she knows, so she doesn&#39;t have to worry about how to form letters if that&#39;s not her top priority. She *knows* its an issue, but not because its been pointed out to her over and over. When she wants to have her writing read by people she doesn&#39;t know, she types, or asks me to write for her, or double check her writing for clarity.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo would likely be labled with something more than dyslexia in school. How she&#39;d be labled would depend on which &quot;walls&quot; she ran into in terms of boredom or social issues or sensory matters. At home, those are things she can learn about without the pressure of performance. If she&#39;s struggling to communicate verbally, she can try different strategies without being mocked or corrected. If she&#39;s having a rough time with sensory issues, she do that too, plus she can choose to say &quot;no&quot; to sensory experiences that she&#39;s not ready for in the moment. She gets to decide on her comfort zone and decide when and how much to move beyond it. <br/>
<br/>
I know when I was homeschooling my now-16yo he seemed to have more &quot;issues&quot; that have largely resolved with unschooling. He&#39;s still a quirky individual, but that&#39;s not a problem, if you see what I mean?<br/>

Dealing with the legal aspects is a separate thing - there are unschoolers who manage in some very heavily regulated areas! Its a matter of learning how to translate the very real learning that goes on all the time (even now, in your home, believe it or not!) into language that appeases the Powers that Be.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to know the law well, know the specific minimum requirements for your area so you&#39;re not doing more than you need to do. The state is far far less important than your real life! Don&#39;t waste time giving them more than they ask for, spend time being with your family instead. Here are some ideas from that same big site as to how other families have translated unschooling (as it were) for the authorities:<br/>
