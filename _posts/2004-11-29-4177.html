&gt; You need to raise your children your way.  Are you in contact with HSLDA?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i was a member  of HSLDA,for about a year,,they dont support&#39;&#39;unschooling&#39;&#39;<br/>
they others are right though,,,educate  YOURSELF,,the more you know the <br/>
better you can deal with them ..<br/>
hubbys arent always the best supporteres where their families are concerned,,<br/>
mine has a known mental illness,and all my brother in law can say is &#39;&#39;his  <br/>
lifestyle doesnt reflect his illness&#39;&#39;..and he is going in the medical <br/>
field...geeeezzzzneither mom or bro. in law will confront me with their <br/>
&#39;&#39;concerns&#39;&#39;but they screw with hubby...but alas,,they know i would most likely tell them <br/>
both to bite me ...<br/>
anyway,,,educate yourself ,so when you have to hear their crap,,,you can know <br/>
what is right.....&gt;&gt;JUNE<br/>
