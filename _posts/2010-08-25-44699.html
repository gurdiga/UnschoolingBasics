<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093559615">Hi, I was wondering,<br/>
<br/>
my kids are 1 and 3 so we don&#39;t yet technically home or unschool though we hope to -<br/>
<br/>
are there any families where both parents work?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of returning to school myself to finish my PhD and I have no idea how we would work around my husband working full-time and me studying full-time.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I imagine there are many.  My husband works a normal 9-5 job, and I work for <br/>
myself and take my kids with me.  There are probably as many ways to do this as <br/>
there are families who do it ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691181217">Hi, I worked full time and homeschooled for the first few years with the kids. Sometimes I had them with me, other times I went to work and my husband would take care of the kids. The homeschooling aspect was mostly my responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Today I tend to unschool and am working part-time and am starting a family business with the kids implication. They are there and involved every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the fact that there are many ways of mixing both. Life is not 9 to 5... (I must admit it&#39;s a bit more challenging.)<br/>
