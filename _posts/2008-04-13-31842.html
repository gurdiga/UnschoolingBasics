I am not in West Virginia, but here in Ca in my school district, the school district has to grant the work permit. I would check with the state department of education and find out what your state and district requirements are. (if any).  My daughter got a job at 14 and it involved filling out the district&#39;s work permit application, and then getting the employer to sign off on it, and then going back to the district and filing the form. Here in CA we can file a form establishing our home as a private school (R4 form) and then we grant our students the work priveleges just as any public or private school would. It was pretty easy, but the district imposed a rule saying she could not work between the hours of 8 and 3 or some nonsense, but fortunately her employer ignored that because as my daughter explained &quot;the form is written for people in formal schools and does not really address the needs of homeschoolers. &quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127409551">In CT, you have to go through the school district BUT you don&#39;t have to<br/>
attend the public school (otherwise private school kids would be out of<br/>
luck too, not just homeschoolers). Because of child labor laws, it&#39;s<br/>
required that there be a form filled out stating that your child is of<br/>
proper age (for whatever the state laws are for the job - it can vary<br/>
depending on whether it&#39;s agriculture or fast food or whatever) and that<br/>
the work will not interfere with the child&#39;s education/&quot;school hours&quot;.<br/>
If an employer does not have that form on file when an inspector happens<br/>
by, the business can be in a heap o&#39; trouble.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014151037">In NC you can go online and fill out and file the form ... it<br/>
processes it and give them a ID number, the form can be printed to<br/>
take to the employer for them to file with all the rest of the<br/>
paperwork.  You can also go to any public library and get one filled<br/>
out there with any of the library staff helping out.   <br/>
You can most likely find out the process by googling &quot;work permit&quot;<br/>
adding in the state you are in for specific information. <br/>
