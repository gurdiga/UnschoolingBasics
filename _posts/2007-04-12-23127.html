<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141946986">Hi,<br/>
I have an ot and a bit off the wall question I hope is ok to post here. <br/>
Any answers are ok, the more off the wall the better. I&#39;m hoping this <br/>
will enlighten and help me think outside the box a bit. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If were $60,000 in debt, broke, in need of a vacation, stressed out at <br/>
work and everyone&#39;s wishing they could just move to a different <br/>
location what would you do? We thought a yurt would be fun but we <br/>
couldn&#39;t put it together, (just kidding, LOL) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for reading this and for humoring me a bit :-).......I <br/>
hope all of you have a wonderful day! :-)</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d get everyone together and figure out where it is that everyone <br/>
wants to be - another town? state? country? Then we&#39;d set about <br/>
thinking on that place and see what we can come up with - maybe <br/>
a &quot;working vacation&quot; if we had skills that were marketable in <br/>
our &quot;dream location&quot; (something that would pay enough to stay afloat <br/>
for a month maybe). Maybe look into trading homes with someone in <br/>
that area (to cut living expenses a bit). Who knows - that &quot;working <br/>
vacation&quot; might translate into an actual re-location/job offer.<br/>
<br/>
I might also get a bunch of info about stuff right in our own <br/>
backyard, as it were, that we&#39;ve never done or seen - new hiking <br/>
trails, lakes, etc as well as free musuem days or whatever and <br/>
consider ourselves &quot;tourists&quot; right at home. <br/>
<br/>
I might gather everyone and clean and re-arrange the existing living <br/>
space to make it feel a bit like a new location.<br/>
<br/>
I might work on the &quot;little things&quot; at home - maybe special meals <br/>
or &quot;themed&quot; meals (within the budget - it&#39;s surprising how <br/>
inexpensively some ethnic cuisines can be prepared for - lots of <br/>
things like rice, beans, flour, salt, etc are pretty inexpensive and <br/>
go a long way).<br/>
<br/>
I might get a big sheet of brown paper or newsprint or whatever (or <br/>
just write on the wall) and make a Thankful Wall - jotting something <br/>
each day that I was thankful for, whether it was something big like <br/>
finally paying off that pesky credit card or getting over the flu or <br/>
something simple like warm slippers on a cold New England morning or <br/>
a hot shower or *chocolate* (that one might appear multiple times <br/>
lol). I&#39;d invite the family to join in if they so choose.<br/>
