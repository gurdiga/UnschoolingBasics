<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945073669">We love our LeapPad.  And even though many are aimed at that whole &quot;make learning fun&quot; attitude as well-my son LOVES to play with it and mix the words up and play the games.<br/>
 <br/>
We make crossword puzzles together too and are just starting to do crossword puzzles.  Word searches are great.  We haven&#39;t tried MadLibs but I keep eyeing the books.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh and if he likes making songs and poetry and stuff, you can buy (or even make) refrigerator poetry.  They have boxes with magnets with words in it and you mix and match the magnets to make poems and silly sentences.  I know you can buy different sets at Border&#39;s (if you have that chain where you are) but we made our own.  We just got flat magnet stuff from a craft store and we sat over a couple of nights just thinking of all different types of words we might like to play with.  We typed and printed the words out and glued the to the magnets and voila!  A homemade custom version that cost about half the price.  We use it to make silly sentences and even to make messages to each other on the fridge.<br/>
 <br/>
There used to be a game with wooden dice and each side had a word instead of a number.  That was always fun though I haven&#39;t found the game again as an adult.  I&#39;m thinking though that maybe that too is something i could make with blocks of scrap wood cut into cubes.  You shake them up and take turns making fun sentences from whatever words appear on the dice.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978402229">My daughter had a period where she loved playing letter games with the<br/>
roladex and also playing hangman (although we usually drew whatever she was<br/>
interested in at the time for the &quot;hangman&quot; like scooby doo or a character<br/>
from a book she liked or whatever).  She also did this thing where she<br/>
picked out a &quot;favorite letter&quot; and focused on spelling, writing and<br/>
discovering words with that letter (her first one was &quot;X&quot; and she had a few<br/>
more after that).  She also liked and still plays the computer game &quot;Ready<br/>
to Read with Pooh&quot; which she got because she saw the letter &quot;X&quot; on the CD<br/>
cover and she loves Pooh.<br/>

Pam,<br/>
<br/>
What a cool coincidence that this topic came up today, because I got <br/>
on today to specifically report how great these books are, and to <br/>
thank you, Pam for the recommendation!  I bought all three (Reading, <br/>
Writing and Math) instead of curriculum and just started using them.  <br/>
My girls LOVE the games so far, and we are having a blast.  Plus, I <br/>
feel reassured as I am seeing some neat things happening as we play.  <br/>
For instance, today, we played word charades for the first time using <br/>
animal words.  We had a lot of fun!  After the first time around, my <br/>
5yod wanted to make her own cards, and asked me how to spell bear, <br/>
dinosaur, cow and elephant.  She recognized all the words the second <br/>
time we played.  We also played Word Search and found word cards that <br/>
we hid all over the house. I made them with the names of family <br/>
members and we pretended they were lost in the wilderness.  They got <br/>
a kick out of finding grandmas, cousins, and themselves, and begged <br/>
to play again! And older dd recognized all the words again!<br/>
<br/>
Besides seeing learning from these games, we are spending quality <br/>
time together, which I have struggled with.  <br/>
<br/>
On another happy note, my 5yod has been asking how to snap her <br/>
fingers recently.  The other night she came out of her bedroom quite <br/>
late to tell me we need to &quot;get a book from the library on how to <br/>
snap so I can learn how to do it&quot;!!!  <br/>
<br/>
We also had an outdoor recorder concert last night, followed by an <br/>
impromptu parade with kiddie instruments!<br/>
<br/>
Guess the unschooling is going well!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599584658">The LeapPads are getting cheaper and cheaper here.  I just found on the K-Mart Clearance rack some of the Quantum  LeapPads (that have more advanced games and things) and we got the Pads for $15 and the books for $5 each.  Also some libraries have LeapPad books to borrow.<br/>

<br/>
Funny but I&#39;ve been feeling this and am starting to wonder if every year at &quot;back to school&quot; time I will feel this.  I start second guessing and wondering if I&#39;m &quot;doing&quot; enough or are they falling &quot;behind&quot; and all of those things that I know in my heart are ridiculous to worry about and yet I do.  Maybe it&#39;s part of why I do like the LeapPads and get encouraged when I see them playing &quot;educational&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless though, they love their leappads and I&#39;m already excited about Christmas when we break out the new Quantum Pads and LapPad sticks (also on Clearance).  They liked them back when they were pricey and now they&#39;re a steal.  I love when that happens.<br/>
