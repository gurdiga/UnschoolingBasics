This is my first post, but I have been following this discussion. My DD <br/>
is 19.5 months old, and I am just starting the process of really <br/>
learning about unschooling. My DH is pretty much following my lead <br/>
because I am bossy and mean about it :(. I am this way out of fear <br/>
because his parents are HORRIBLE to their grandchildren (yelling at them <br/>
for laughing and playing, getting excited, or being needy; calling them <br/>
stupid; telling them they are not capable of doing things; and they are <br/>
not opposed to &quot;beating kids&#39; butts&quot;), yet want to be very involved in <br/>
the lives of their grandchildren. DH doesn&#39;t always recognize how <br/>
harmful their behavior is, so I fear he will repeat it (thankfully, he <br/>
agrees that DD should not be left alone with them).<br/>
<br/>
I have discussed with him how I feel that our parents did not set a good <br/>
parenting example for us, and that if we don&#39;t remain conscious of how <br/>
we are raising DD, then we are likely to use those same techniques.<br/>
<br/>
DH is not a reader, so I have asked him to listen to Naomi Aldort&#39;s CD&#39;s <br/>
with me. I am also thinking of ordering Alfie Kohn&#39;s DVD to watch with <br/>
DH. Occasionally, I will ask him to read a short article.<br/>
<br/>
In all of the reading I have been doing lately, I am realizing that a <br/>
better approach might be to focus more on how I treat DH than on <br/>
worrying about how he is treating DD. This would undoubtedly improve our <br/>
relationship, and hopefully make him see how worthwhile it is to treat <br/>
DD that way. This is a HUGE struggle for me, as I realize how <br/>
controlling I am. I want to &quot;correct&quot; almost everything he says to DD <br/>
because there is still so much coercion, praise, and labeling. I have my <br/>
own healing to do!<br/>

I don&#39;t think they have earned the right to be around their <br/>
grandchildren. I&#39;d keep mine away from them until they learned to &quot;play <br/>
nice.&quot;<br/>

Right! If you are using that bullying technique on him, he may fight <br/>
you! &lt;g&gt; Try using your new &quot;techniques&quot; on him too!<br/>
