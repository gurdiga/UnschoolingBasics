<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952572927">So, I wrote last week about my woes as a person who was once committed to unschooling was frustrated with being a schooler who is not recommitted to my unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to follow the suggestion to sit back and observe the learning that is happening with my son.  Again, I knew that one of my problems is that I am too busy.  So I slowed myself and my brain down enough to really take in what is going on with my son.  I realized that had I done this all along, then I would have never felt moved to do any of the school work that I came up with for my son.<br/>
<br/>
But the kicker happened on Saturday.  We went to Arby&#39;s and got a kids meal which had a book in it.  I think these are questions that parents and children can use to compete against one another.  Anyway, he tells me to ask him the questions.  I do and by the time we finish I have egg all in my face because he was answering these questions that are largely about US History and Geography correctly.  When I would ask how he knew some of the questions he would tell me that it was from show that he watches:  Zach and Cody, Hannah Montanna, some of the animated series.....I was TOO impressed and glad that I was taking the time to observe the learning.<br/>
<br/>
We did our usual several field trips like we do to an agricultural museum and science museum.  It was neat watching my children enjoy themselves while we were immersed in beautiful environments that even I could help but learn something.<br/>
<br/>
So this is my update and I am glad to report something positive rather than what I did in my last pity party.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you all....And before I close, I ask you all to pray for my friend, Amanda.  Her 3 yr old son drowned on Saturday.  She is married to Adam.  All of their family need prayer as this was the only Grandchild in their family.  Her son&#39;s name was Silas.   Thank you all for your support and please keep them in your prayers for as long as you can through this next year.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>
