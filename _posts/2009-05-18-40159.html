<div id="ygrps-yiv-175207404">Something has been bothering for several months. I have been trying to  <br/>
roll what someone said over and over in my head searching for a nice  <br/>
way to hear it. I will refrain from saying what I am thinking and try  <br/>
to be open to others interprtations.<br/>
<br/>
MIL to my DH, &quot;it&#39;s too bad none of your children got your disposition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644914717">MIL to DH: &quot;You are a wonderful person with qualities I admire. I probably forced you to showcase those qualities, because I only wanted you to show me the ones I liked. You&#39;d get the message I didn&#39;t love you if you showed me anything else. It&#39;s tiring being around people who are free to be who they are; I was taught it&#39;s wrong to be loud, or angry, or to have any strong feelings whatsoever. I wish everyone would conform to what I&#39;m comfortable with.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855404958">Omg Caren. That was beautiful and really opened up a few new thoughts  <br/>
to focus on. Feeling much less unstuck now :-)<br/>
