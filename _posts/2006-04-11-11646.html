<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079347455">This is toooooooo funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to share it<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
     <br/>
The boss of a big company needed to call  one of his employees about an <br/>
urgent problem with one of the main  computers. He dialed the employee&#39;s home phone <br/>
number and was greeted with  a child&#39;s whisper.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is your daddy home?&quot; he  asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered the small voice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May I talk with  him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The child whispered, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Surprised, and wanting to  talk with an adult, the boss asked, &quot;Is your Mommy <br/>
 there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May I talk with her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again the small  voice whispered, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hoping there was somebody with whom he could  leave a message, the boss <br/>
asked, &quot;Is anybody else there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot;  whispered the child, &quot;a policeman.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wondering what a cop would be  doing at his employee&#39;s home, the boss asked, <br/>
&quot;May I speak with the  policeman?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, he&#39;s busy&quot;, whispered the child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Busy  doing what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman,&quot; came the  whispered answer.<br/>
<br/>
Growing concerned and even worried as he heard  what sounded like a <br/>
helicopter through the earpiece on the phone the boss  asked, &quot;What is that noise?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A hello-copper&quot; answered the  whispering voice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is going on there?&quot; asked the boss, now  truly alarmed.<br/>
<br/>
In an awed whispering voice the child answered, &quot;The  search team just landed <br/>
the hello-copper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Alarmed, concerned, and  even more than just a little frustrated the boss <br/>
asked, &quot;What are they  searching for?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still whispering, the young voice replied along  with a muffled giggle: &quot;ME.&quot;<br/>
