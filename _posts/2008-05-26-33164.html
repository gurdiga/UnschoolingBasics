<div id="ygrps-yiv-160126515">Having to face the assessment process in NY for my 9th grader, I am <br/>
wondering what unschoolers do, in NY, to satisfy the requirements of <br/>
an assessment every year during high school...<br/>
<br/>
Is there an alternative to the standardized testing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877859080">For high school, nope - test is required. However, it doesn&#39;t say WHICH<br/>
test - you can choose something like the PASS test which can be<br/>
administered by you, at home (it does NOT have to be the state test that<br/>
schools use).  Also, you might want to read<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests">http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests</a> (and check out the links at the<br/>
bottom as well). Basically, you can make it obvious to yourself and your<br/>
child that the tests are not indicative in any way, shape, or form of<br/>
what they know or don&#39;t know or how &#39;smart&#39; they are or anything. Simple<br/>
stuff, like literally rolling a die or flipping a coin on questions they<br/>
aren&#39;t sure of. Obviously, if they&#39;ve picked the answer by rolling a<br/>
die, it has no reflection on what they know, it&#39;s a random answer.<br/>
<br/>
The result needs only be above the 33rd percentile - that&#39;s not 33<br/>
percent but rather better than 33/100 of the kids taking the same test<br/>
at the same time. If X gets 2 of 10 questions correct (20%) and 32<br/>
people got 1 right and the other 67 got 3 right (to total to 100 people<br/>
for even calculation), then X would be in the 33rd percentile.<br/>
