<div id="ygrps-yiv-707468320">Hi, I&#39;m Erin, SAHM to Owen, 3.5 years old and baby due early July.   <br/>
Last fall I backed out of sending ds to preschool at the last minute,  <br/>
thinking I didn&#39;t want to overschool him before kindergarten even  <br/>
started.  I had big plans to do mini-trips on weekly and monthly  <br/>
schedules, and thought I&#39;d be providing lots of arts and crafts  <br/>
projects, writing letters, learning phonics, etc with him.  Two  <br/>
problems:  Owen never wants to go anywhere and he hates worksheets  <br/>
and arts and crafts--anything schooly.  I noticed he was learning  <br/>
lots from play, watching tv, reading with me and just asking  <br/>
questions--the way he&#39;s always learned.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of unschooling for several weeks, but  <br/>
signed him up for a co-op preschool anyway for this fall.  But  <br/>
yesterday I was informed that the preschool was closing.  I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking &quot;this must be a sign!&quot;  So I&#39;m keeping my eyes out, ready to  <br/>
follow his lead.  I am just getting frustrated that I have such a  <br/>
rough time getting him out the door to do basic things like visiting  <br/>
the library or to playgroup, though he invariably has a great time  <br/>
once we get there.  Being pregnant I tend to not feel like going  <br/>
anywhere either, so a lot of times I just lay off.<br/>
<br/>
Wish us luck on our continued unschooling journey.  I&#39;m glad to be  <br/>
here and look forward to learning from the group.<br/>
<br/>
