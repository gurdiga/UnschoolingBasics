<div id="ygrps-yiv-687836529">I&#39;ve been reading with GREAT interest the posts about food choices.  I&#39;m not sure how to handle this with my 6 yr old son.  He still has MAJOR meltdowns and tantrums - he gets frustrated soooo easily.  Lately he&#39;s been getting extremely angry, jumping up and down and flailing is arms when he&#39;s frustrated.  And he doesn&#39;t want me to hug him when he&#39;s like that.  We&#39;ve seen a geneticist, made sure his skull has enough room for his brain to grow, etc.  I saw a doctor once who said my son definitely has some developmental issues, but nothing that could be pinpointed - great.  The geneticist and another psychologist said the same thing.  He has characteristics of aspergers, adhd, and ppd all at once.  He will ask me the same question over and over in the span of 5-10 minutes.  Anything I say to him has to be broken down to the barest of the english language.  Here is an example:<br/>
Him - Mom what&#39;s the weather today<br/>
Me - It&#39;s going to be 67 degrees<br/>
Him - Is that hot or cold?<br/>
Me - It&#39;s warm&quot;<br/>
Him - so do I need my jacket?<br/>
Me - no, but you can take it if you&#39;d like to in case you get cold<br/>
Him - is it cold outside today?<br/>
Me - no, it&#39;s not cold, it&#39;s warm<br/>
Him - so I can wear my jacket?<br/>
Me - yes<br/>
Him - because it might get cold<br/>
Me - yes<br/>
Him - is it hot or is it cold<br/>
Me - it warm<br/>
<br/>
Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going and I just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language comprehension is still at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.  He must be spoken to very simply and plainly.<br/>
<br/>
So...I&#39;m thinking...is what he&#39;s eating the issue?  My son likes to graze - he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.  All he likes to eat mostly are carbs: cereal, waffles, bread, french fries, etc.  He won&#39;t eat much meat or any other protein for that matter.  I think only eggs and peanut butter - but that&#39;s about it.  Since I&#39;ve let go of food choices, I&#39;ve noticed his behavior getting worse in terms of his frustration levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that he&#39;s eating LOTS of Froot Loops.  How do I talk to him about that?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard about the elimination diet.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be very happy with that at all.  We would ALL have to go on that diet - and that&#39;s probably not going to happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293479887">Has he been tested for gluten intolerance?  He sounds very much like the son<br/>
of a friend who was diagnosed with celiac disease and has since gone off<br/>
gluten and recovered both mentally and physically.  A google search will<br/>
yield a wealth of informaiton.  It may be worth investigating.<br/>

Hi Maisha!  My children are both food sensitive and my son especially  falls <br/>
on that PDD spectrum.  I think my daughter might too, just to a  lesser degree.<br/>
 <br/>
We have done a million and one things, including using homeopathy and going  <br/>
to a Bioset practitioner (allergy elimination through acupressure).  We are  <br/>
currently using food enzymes for autistics and we are very pleased with the  <br/>
results.  Although I don&#39;t always, I am currently avoiding obvious food  <br/>
coloring.  In the past, my kids were on the Feingold diet.  I also  like Tapas <br/>
Acupressure Technique (TAT).<br/>
 <br/>
All of it has helped in one way or another, but we haven&#39;t found that magic  <br/>
one thing.  It has been a journey.  I am considering going to a  homeopath <br/>
next.<br/>
 <br/>
Some websites and other resources that have been helpful to me:<br/>
_www.enzymestuff.com_ (http://www.enzymestuff.com)  and _www.houstonni.com_ <br/>
(http://www.houstonni.com)    <br/>
_www.tatlife.com_ (http://www.tatlife.com) <br/>
_www.feingold.org_ (http://www.feingold.org) <br/>
&quot;the Food Allergy Cure&quot; book by Dr. Ellen Cutler<br/>
KingBio Food/Chemical Allergy Homeopathic remedy spray (at health food  <br/>
stores or _www.kingbio.com_ (http://www.kingbio.com)  )<br/>
 <br/>
I was supposed to do a bit of a write up for some others on this list and I  <br/>
apologize for not doing so.  If anyone has some specific questions, feel  free <br/>
to write me off-list and I will try to do a better job of answering.   :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like a conversation that I would have with Keon.  We have<br/>
weather discussions all the time.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I tell him<br/>
to go check for himself.  I figure if he feels what the weather is and<br/>
decides to wear his jacket and gets hot (which rarely he will notice due to<br/>
his limitations in being able to recognize such things so I would have to<br/>
tell him he is hot) that he can always take the jacket off.<br/>
<br/>
Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going and I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us<br/>
&gt; understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language comprehension is still<br/>
&gt; at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.  He must be spoken to very simply and<br/>
&gt; plainly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep.  Sounds very familiar.  It has gotten better this past year thanks to<br/>
age and development.<br/>
<br/>
So...I&#39;m thinking...is what he&#39;s eating the issue?  My son likes to graze -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.  All he likes to eat mostly<br/>
&gt; are carbs: cereal, waffles, bread, french fries, etc.  He won&#39;t eat much<br/>
&gt; meat or any other protein for that matter.  I think only eggs and peanut<br/>
&gt; butter - but that&#39;s about it.  Since I&#39;ve let go of food choices, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed his behavior getting worse in terms of his frustration levels.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; also noticed that he&#39;s eating LOTS of Froot Loops.  How do I talk to him<br/>
&gt; about that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have major issues with artificial colors.  Fruit Loops have tons of them.<br/>
Would he be open to eating a natural colored sweetened cereal?  There are<br/>
several on the market that taste remarkably like the original brand names.<br/>
My oldest child has a sensitivity to Red Dye #40 (a known behavioural<br/>
allergen!!!) and while her life isn&#39;t in danger if she eats it (like a<br/>
person who can&#39;t eat peanuts or shellfish) it does impact her ability to<br/>
cope.  She&#39;s aware of it and now as a teenager chooses whether or not she<br/>
wants to consume products that have this coloring in it.  There are SO many<br/>
artificial colors, flavors and preservatives that are behavioural<br/>
allergens.  We discovered Emily&#39;s allergy when she was a toddler (thankfully<br/>
as she was a real handful) and we allowed her to see how this product<br/>
impacted her behaviour.  We have never been very strict about her<br/>
consumption of it, but we have had to remind her on occaission the effects<br/>
that this product has on her body and ability to cope with life in general.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard about the elimination diet.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be very happy<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with that at all.  We would ALL have to go on that diet - and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do single food eliminations.  Although it isn&#39;t as effective, it can<br/>
be done.  There is a wonderful book called &quot;Is this your child&quot; by Doris<br/>
Rapp (maybe Rupp, it&#39;s not right here at the computer).  It is all about<br/>
allergens, including behavioural allergens.  It is SO comforting to actually<br/>
have someone acknowledge that there is such a thing as a behavioural<br/>
allergen!!  I see the book at half.com all the time for around $8.  It&#39;s a<br/>
HUGE book and a HUGE read, but you can break it down by symptoms if you need<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned this before.  Keon does not have the ability to recognize<br/>
things like being full, hungry, tired, frustrated, hot, cold, etc.  He also<br/>
will reach for carby food before proteins basically because carby food is so<br/>
much easier to get.  A bag of chips is easier to grab than a block of cheese<br/>
and a knife.  I&#39;ve gotten to where I will put aside leftover chicken in<br/>
cubes for him or purchase beef jerky or cube some cheese and leave for him<br/>
so he can easily access more proteins.  He will eat an egg just about<br/>
anyway, so I&#39;ll see him getting frustrated with his life due to lack of<br/>
proteins and offer to cook him an egg (or two or three.)  He&#39;ll eat them<br/>
boild, scrambled, fried, omellettes, poached, baked, doesn&#39;t matter. But it<br/>
is a quick easy protein to get into him very quickly.  We talk often (in<br/>
long drawn out conversations like the weather) about food choices and the<br/>
need for both protein and carbohydrates.  And sometimes I will tell him that<br/>
he seems like he just needs some more protein and he will ask me to come<br/>
help him find some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704585318">Hey Maisha<br/>
I know where you are coming from, I have an aspie and an autie, and  <br/>
they are much the same. WIth us, we&#39;ve always looked at food issues  <br/>
being a part of the sensory load. We initially dealt with the sensory  <br/>
stuff, and that seemed to help a lot with eating issues. So stuff  <br/>
like heavy lifting, lots of play in sensory bins , massage, lots of  <br/>
bouncing, and a technique called &#39;brushing&#39; (if you google  <br/>
willabarger you can read more) It made a huge difference in their  <br/>
comprehension, eating variety, and also sleeping and playing.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve removed from josh&#39;s diet and didn&#39;t notice anything, but  <br/>
removing corn products from Breanna did help. If she gets the tiniest  <br/>
bit of corn, she is lost. That includes corn starch, corn syrup, high  <br/>
fructose corn syrup, corn meal, corn flour, and anything cooked in  <br/>
corn oils.<br/>
<br/>
You might look into also, Teach Me Language, which helps with  <br/>
functional language. We don&#39;t use it the way most people do, which is  <br/>
sitting at a table doing tasks over and over with a reward system,  <br/>
but we&#39;ve managed to integrate it a lot into our lives, and it helps  <br/>
ME know what the deficits are. Language is too instinctual for me to  <br/>
understand why they are having trouble! One thing I noticed in the  <br/>
supplied conversation (which sounds like something in our house with  <br/>
any one of our kids lol!) was that you were answering all the  <br/>
questions. One thing we started doing was asking questions back to  <br/>
sort of give them more empowerment. So maybe when he asks if it&#39;s hot  <br/>
or cold, you could ask him what he thinks. Or when he asks if it&#39;s  <br/>
cold, you could ask him to do a weather check for the family and  <br/>
report back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138038062">Thanks - I hadn&#39;t even considered that.   I sure hope that&#39;s not it though.  The thought of telling him that he&#39;s got to give up the cereals he loves is NOT going to be a pleasant conversation!  LOL  I&#39;ll do some research on this.  Thanks again.<br/>

  Has he been tested for gluten intolerance?  He sounds very much like the son<br/>
  of a friend who was diagnosed with celiac disease and has since gone off<br/>
  gluten and recovered both mentally and physically.  A google search will<br/>
  yield a wealth of informaiton.  It may be worth investigating.<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;ve been reading with GREAT interest the posts about food choices.  I&#39;m<br/>
  &gt; not sure how to handle this with my 6 yr old son.  He still has MAJOR<br/>
  &gt; meltdowns and tantrums - he gets frustrated soooo easily.  Lately he&#39;s been<br/>
  &gt; getting extremely angry, jumping up and down and flailing is arms when he&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; frustrated.  And he doesn&#39;t want me to hug him when he&#39;s like that.  We&#39;ve<br/>
  &gt; seen a geneticist, made sure his skull has enough room for his brain to<br/>
  &gt; grow, etc.  I saw a doctor once who said my son definitely has some<br/>
  &gt; developmental issues, but nothing that could be pinpointed - great.  The<br/>
  &gt; geneticist and another psychologist said the same thing.  He has<br/>
  &gt; characteristics of aspergers, adhd, and ppd all at once.  He will ask me the<br/>
  &gt; same question over and over in the span of 5-10 minutes.  Anything I say to<br/>
  &gt; him has to be broken down to the barest of the english language.  Here is an<br/>
  &gt; example:<br/>
  &gt; Him - Mom what&#39;s the weather today<br/>
  &gt; Me - It&#39;s going to be 67 degrees<br/>
  &gt; Him - Is that hot or cold?<br/>
  &gt; Me - It&#39;s warm&quot;<br/>
  &gt; Him - so do I need my jacket?<br/>
  &gt; Me - no, but you can take it if you&#39;d like to in case you get cold<br/>
  &gt; Him - is it cold outside today?<br/>
  &gt; Me - no, it&#39;s not cold, it&#39;s warm<br/>
  &gt; Him - so I can wear my jacket?<br/>
  &gt; Me - yes<br/>
  &gt; Him - because it might get cold<br/>
  &gt; Me - yes<br/>
  &gt; Him - is it hot or is it cold<br/>
  &gt; Me - it warm<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going and I<br/>
  &gt; just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us<br/>
  &gt; understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language comprehension is still<br/>
  &gt; at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.  He must be spoken to very simply and<br/>
  &gt; plainly.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; So...I&#39;m thinking...is what he&#39;s eating the issue?  My son likes to graze<br/>
  &gt; - he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.  All he likes to eat<br/>
  &gt; mostly are carbs: cereal, waffles, bread, french fries, etc.  He won&#39;t eat<br/>
  &gt; much meat or any other protein for that matter.  I think only eggs and<br/>
  &gt; peanut butter - but that&#39;s about it.  Since I&#39;ve let go of food choices,<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve noticed his behavior getting worse in terms of his frustration levels.<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve also noticed that he&#39;s eating LOTS of Froot Loops.  How do I talk to<br/>
  &gt; him about that?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve heard about the elimination diet.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be very<br/>
  &gt; happy with that at all.  We would ALL have to go on that diet - and that&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; probably not going to happen.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Thanks for any advice and help<br/>

<br/>
  This sounds like a conversation that I would have with Keon.  We have<br/>
  weather discussions all the time.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I tell him<br/>
  to go check for himself.  I figure if he feels what the weather is and<br/>
  decides to wear his jacket and gets hot (which rarely he will notice due to<br/>
  his limitations in being able to recognize such things so I would have to<br/>
  tell him he is hot) that he can always take the jacket off.<br/>
<br/>
  Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going and I<br/>
  &gt; just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us<br/>
  &gt; understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language comprehension is still<br/>
  &gt; at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.  He must be spoken to very simply and<br/>
  &gt; plainly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yep.  Sounds very familiar.  It has gotten better this past year thanks to<br/>
  age and development.<br/>
<br/>
  So...I&#39;m thinking...is what he&#39;s eating the issue?  My son likes to graze -<br/>
  &gt; he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.  All he likes to eat mostly<br/>
  &gt; are carbs: cereal, waffles, bread, french fries, etc.  He won&#39;t eat much<br/>
  &gt; meat or any other protein for that matter.  I think only eggs and peanut<br/>
  &gt; butter - but that&#39;s about it.  Since I&#39;ve let go of food choices, I&#39;ve<br/>
  &gt; noticed his behavior getting worse in terms of his frustration levels.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  &gt; also noticed that he&#39;s eating LOTS of Froot Loops.  How do I talk to him<br/>
  &gt; about that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have major issues with artificial colors.  Fruit Loops have tons of them.<br/>
  Would he be open to eating a natural colored sweetened cereal?  There are<br/>
  several on the market that taste remarkably like the original brand names.<br/>
  My oldest child has a sensitivity to Red Dye #40 (a known behavioural<br/>
  allergen!!!) and while her life isn&#39;t in danger if she eats it (like a<br/>
  person who can&#39;t eat peanuts or shellfish) it does impact her ability to<br/>
  cope.  She&#39;s aware of it and now as a teenager chooses whether or not she<br/>
  wants to consume products that have this coloring in it.  There are SO many<br/>
  artificial colors, flavors and preservatives that are behavioural<br/>
  allergens.  We discovered Emily&#39;s allergy when she was a toddler (thankfully<br/>
  as she was a real handful) and we allowed her to see how this product<br/>
  impacted her behaviour.  We have never been very strict about her<br/>
  consumption of it, but we have had to remind her on occaission the effects<br/>
  that this product has on her body and ability to cope with life in general.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve heard about the elimination diet.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be very happy<br/>
  &gt; with that at all.  We would ALL have to go on that diet - and that&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; probably not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  You can do single food eliminations.  Although it isn&#39;t as effective, it can<br/>
  be done.  There is a wonderful book called &quot;Is this your child&quot; by Doris<br/>
  Rapp (maybe Rupp, it&#39;s not right here at the computer).  It is all about<br/>
  allergens, including behavioural allergens.  It is SO comforting to actually<br/>
  have someone acknowledge that there is such a thing as a behavioural<br/>
  allergen!!  I see the book at half.com all the time for around $8.  It&#39;s a<br/>
  HUGE book and a HUGE read, but you can break it down by symptoms if you need<br/>
  to.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve mentioned this before.  Keon does not have the ability to recognize<br/>
  things like being full, hungry, tired, frustrated, hot, cold, etc.  He also<br/>
  will reach for carby food before proteins basically because carby food is so<br/>
  much easier to get.  A bag of chips is easier to grab than a block of cheese<br/>
  and a knife.  I&#39;ve gotten to where I will put aside leftover chicken in<br/>
  cubes for him or purchase beef jerky or cube some cheese and leave for him<br/>
  so he can easily access more proteins.  He will eat an egg just about<br/>
  anyway, so I&#39;ll see him getting frustrated with his life due to lack of<br/>
  proteins and offer to cook him an egg (or two or three.)  He&#39;ll eat them<br/>
  boild, scrambled, fried, omellettes, poached, baked, doesn&#39;t matter. But it<br/>
  is a quick easy protein to get into him very quickly.  We talk often (in<br/>
  long drawn out conversations like the weather) about food choices and the<br/>
  need for both protein and carbohydrates.  And sometimes I will tell him that<br/>
  he seems like he just needs some more protein and he will ask me to come<br/>
  help him find some.<br/>

  Hi Maisha!  My children are both food sensitive and my son especially  falls <br/>
  on that PDD spectrum.  I think my daughter might too, just to a  lesser degree.<br/>
<br/>
  We have done a million and one things, including using homeopathy and going  <br/>
  to a Bioset practitioner (allergy elimination through acupressure).  We are  <br/>
  currently using food enzymes for autistics and we are very pleased with the  <br/>
  results.  Although I don&#39;t always, I am currently avoiding obvious food  <br/>
  coloring.  In the past, my kids were on the Feingold diet.  I also  like Tapas <br/>
  Acupressure Technique (TAT).<br/>
<br/>
  All of it has helped in one way or another, but we haven&#39;t found that magic  <br/>
  one thing.  It has been a journey.  I am considering going to a  homeopath <br/>
  next.<br/>
<br/>
  Some websites and other resources that have been helpful to me:<br/>
  _www.enzymestuff.com_ (http://www.enzymestuff.com)&lt;http://www.enzymestuff.com)/&gt;  and _www.houstonni.com_ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841421560">***He still has MAJOR meltdowns and tantrums - he gets frustrated soooo<br/>
easily.***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s little.  He&#39;s new on the planet.  <br/>
It&#39;s your job to help him before the meltdown.  You should be paying<br/>
attention to what makes him weary.  Too long between snacks?  Take him<br/>
food more frequently.  Too long without a touch from you, a hug, go hug<br/>
him when he&#39;s still happy and calm.    It&#39;s up to you to help him get<br/>
what he needs before he has to explode to get your attention. <br/>
<br/>
The conversation you posted is normal.  <br/>
Why do you think someone who is six should know what sixty seven degrees<br/>
feels like.  Sixty seven degrees feel different depending on cloud cover<br/>
or sunshine or wind or humidity or whether you&#39;re fat or skinny or maybe<br/>
a half dozen other factors.    <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with him!  <br/>
Maybe say &quot;I think it&#39;s warm enough you won&#39;t need a jacket &quot;  <br/>
And then YOU take his jacket incase the weather changes.   <br/>
And have a nice conversation about weather without thinking the worst<br/>
possible thing about your son. <br/>
<br/>
***and I just have to stop him.***<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;have to stop him.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
*** ...is what he&#39;s eating the issue? ***<br/>
<br/>
WHY are you looking for something to be wrong with this child?   He&#39;s<br/>
six.  He&#39;s experimenting with language, with conversation, with the world<br/>
around him.  He&#39;s learning every minute from everything he does.   He&#39;s<br/>
learning about hot, cold, warm, cool.  Learning.  Give him freedom.  Free<br/>
up your own mind to make room for this child&#39;s learning.   <br/>
<br/>
If there is a problem it&#39;s you.  Let him be six.  Let him talk the way he<br/>
wants to talk.   You don&#39;t get to make the rules for every conversation. <br/>
If he&#39;s not understanding you then that&#39;s YOUR responsibility.  You&#39;re<br/>
the adult.  You&#39;ve been on the planet long enough to have learned that<br/>
six year olds don&#39;t usually understand the nuances of temperature and yet<br/>
you&#39;re asking whether it might be Fruit Loops causing his questions about<br/>
the weather??!   You want to control the conversation and when you can&#39;t<br/>
you want to control his food.  It&#39;s stunning. <br/>
 <br/>
I think your kid is fine. I think he&#39;s perfect.   I think you might have<br/>
control issues.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902474013">&lt;&lt;I think your kid is fine. I think he&#39;s perfect.   I think you might have<br/>
control issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do have some control issues, but dealing in this circumstance isn&#39;t one of them.  I was only using that as ONE example.  Here&#39;s another: a man is walking towards us - clearly it&#39;s a man.  He knows his sister is in school.  He asks me &quot;Is that Rohana?&quot;  His sister (one year older) says &quot;no, that&#39;s a man Dakari.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now believe me...*I* know what I am dealing with here on a day to day basis.  I&#39;m sure he needs more hugs - who doesn&#39;t?  It wasn&#39;t that he should know whether it was warm or not.  It&#39;s that conversations with him go in circles.  I&#39;ve been around enough 6 yr olds, and 6 yr old boys at that to know when a conversation with one is out of the ordinary.  I&#39;m not looking for something to be &#39;wrong&#39; with him.  He&#39;s not something that&#39;s broken and needs to be fixed.  I&#39;m looking for ways to understand him better, and to help him navigate this world as best he can.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten the advice that I need on diet and how that may be a factor in his behavior (as it can be in anyone&#39;s).  I appreciate the input.<br/>

<br/>
I think this is a bit judgmental here?  If we wouldn&#39;t talk to our children this way (in a judgmental fashion), why someone else?  I&#39;m sorry if something I said struck a cord.  I don&#39;t mind input, that&#39;s why I asked.  I don&#39;t mind criticism, that&#39;s a way to grow and learn.  I do believe that there is a way to say things, and your statement above is worded in a way that can cause offense.  Now it&#39;s pretty hard to offend me, so I&#39;m not seething in anger or anything.    I would just appreciate a little benefit of the doubt.  Again, it wasn&#39;t about the temperature.  That was just an example of one conversation.  It is difficult to understand my son sometimes.  Not only because of the way he speaks, but how he uses the English language.  It&#39;s easier to understand my 3 yr old.  My 6 yr old just sees the world in a different way, and I&#39;d like to understand what he&#39;s saying and what he means.  I don&#39;t berate him for it.  I do my best.  I really do.  I&#39;m a work in progress just like he is.  I hope you can understand that.<br/>

<br/>
When I was 20, I lived in Germany and Austria for a year. It took me <br/>
six months for me to figure out Celcius!<br/>
<br/>
Then I moved back to Germany for three years when I was 26. I caught on <br/>
much more quickly---but just 5 years of not using it stopped me from <br/>
*thinking* in Celcius. I&#39;ve been away for many more years now. I <br/>
remember zero&#39;s freezing cold and 30 is pretty damned hot! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Stranger in a strange land, indeed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb lives in Montana. I tease her about her incredibly long winters. <br/>
But she&#39;s MELT here in a South Carolina August!<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;comfortable-to-walk-around-in-a-sweater&quot; probably looks/feels very <br/>
different to hers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the child as a different person---separate from you---is very <br/>
important. As is understanding that he only has a tiny bit of <br/>
information stored. He&#39;s not ready to need to know. Think of it as he&#39;s <br/>
just storing what you tell him every day until it makes sense to him. <br/>
He&#39;s taking it in, and one day it&#39;ll be there---clear as a bell! Until <br/>
then, you may be providing that information a zillion times!<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Patience. Deep breaths.<br/>

loves provolone) a little on the thick side (or get it sliced at the <br/>
deli, depending on what you get). Then use mini cookie cutters (LOL <br/>
our set is from pampered Chef) to cut out shapes. Store in a ziptop <br/>
bag or container in the fridge. Easily accessible and attractive/fun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He will eat an egg just about<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When DS is in an egg eating &#39;mode&#39;, we&#39;ll usually keep a dozen hard <br/>
boiled in the fridge ready for easy, fast access. Also, sometimes <br/>
he&#39;s okay with doing his own omelette (scrambled eggs) in the <br/>
microwave - our microwave has an &quot;omelette&quot; setting that does the <br/>
eggs nicely without leaving uncooked bits. Makes things easier if <br/>
the adults are tied up at the moment he wants eggs. He can crack <br/>
them into a known micro safe dish/bowl (he knows which to use), <br/>
scramble them around with a fork, then nuke.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s where our chalkboard list of proteins helps - I can go with <br/>
him, but DS can look at the list and decide what &#39;category&#39; he wants <br/>
(eggs, cheese, nuts, whatever) and I help him find something in that <br/>
group that we&#39;ve got available.<br/>

(like when he first gets up), he&#39;ll pop to the Weather Channel - he&#39;s <br/>
got the number memorized and DH set it up so that is the default <br/>
station - if you just turn the cable box off and back on, it starts up <br/>
at the Weather Channel. Over time, he&#39;s gotten to know (both by their <br/>
color coding and by experience) when he needs a jacket or long sleeves <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve considered but haven&#39;t yet done is getting a good <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050659898">I have decided that today is a new day for me. A fresh start. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve been on this group(and may more unschooling groups) for a long time, I tend to hide in the background, wanting to post having things to say but hardly ever doing it. Why? <br/>
   <br/>
  Because as many of my schooly notions that I have tossed to the wayside one has had a really good grip on me. I&#39;m behind the class. I try to read all the emails I get, knowing that there are so many wise women on these boards that have help change my families life I don&#39;t want to miss a thing. Well, life happens and  I can&#39;t keep up and I end up returning to an inbox FULL of emails. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll read and start to reply then notice the date is a month before, figure that every thing that could be said has been said and I&#39;ll go back to reading.<br/>
   <br/>
  Today, I deleted (gulp) 3057 unread emails. Today is the day I start to live in the now. I don&#39;t have to know everything that was said last month. I&#39;m not behind the class, there is no class. I can be here now and get everything that I need to continue down the path that my family has chosen.<br/>

(college). She was amazed at seeing people in jeans and jackets <br/>
while she was comfortable in a long sleeved t shirt and shorts. Then <br/>
the reverse - she moved back to NJ and was bundling up in sweaters <br/>
and jackets in September, way earlier than usual. She&#39;s better now <br/>
(mostly) but still gets cold sooner than she used to.<br/>
<br/>
And, I&#39;ve learned that the Y chromosome seems to do something to the <br/>
thermostat. Both DH and DS will be running around in shorts and <br/>
tshirts (or sweatpants and t shirts) and I&#39;ll be in jeans and a <br/>
sweatshirt and socks and looking for a blanket to huddle under. So <br/>
I&#39;ve learned not to gauge how DS will be comfortable based on my <br/>
comfort level. I&#39;ll give him information based on my opinion - and <br/>
let him know it&#39;s my opinion &quot;I&#39;m planning on wearing jacket when we <br/>
go outside. It&#39;s sort of medium temperature but breezy.&quot; And we&#39;ll <br/>
usually do a final check at the door as to whether he wears his <br/>
jacket or just wants to bring it along. Often, in the in-between <br/>
weather months (spring and fall) we just keep a spare jacket in the <br/>
car all the time because it&#39;s changeable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262792835">I made another big choice this weekend. <br/>
   <br/>
  We live in Ca, and one of the homeschooling options here is to do so with a charter school.  I caved to family pressure last Sept. and enrolled Jaiden(7). The EF(teacher) we got is great, she understands unschooling, up to a point, and was willing and able to work with us as far as providing samples.<br/>
   <br/>
  However every 2 months (when samples were due) I would panic and Jaiden and I would rush to pull together enough workbook samples for her.  Jaiden is also supossed to take the STAR test in a few weeks.<br/>
   <br/>
  After a huge charter vs r4 filers( another option here in Ca) and doing a lot more research on the ins and outs of charter schools I&#39;ve decided not to go the charter route next year. And I&#39;m going to opt Jaiden out of testing. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m a little scared, the family response will be less than stellar. The money that we recived was really helpful. And this will be my first &quot;legal&quot; year doing it all on my own.<br/>
   <br/>
  But I&#39;m happy with the decision, Jason(dh) is on board with the idea of the r4 and with unschooling. Still getting him to the &quot;radical&quot; part of it, but he is on the way.<br/>
   <br/>
  I haven&#39;t said anything to our EF about it yet. I&#39;m kinda scared to, must be more schooly stuff rearing it&#39;s ugly head.<br/>

to the children&#39;s &quot;education.&quot;  It goes something like this, &quot;Yes; the<br/>
children are doing great with their studies. We have the perfect curriculum<br/>
for them.  They are thriving in their home environment.  Our social calendar<br/>
is as full as our learning calendar.  And they are right where they are<br/>
supposed to be academically.&quot;  I&#39;ve not told one lie but it eases her fears.<br/>
<br/>
I find it quite interesting that when someone has a child who is the public<br/>
school system, people very very rarely question what curriculum they are<br/>
using and whether they are getting enough of the right kind of<br/>
socialization.<br/>

  I&#39;m getting there. I&#39;m in the process of changing the way I relate to my parents. I&#39;m 28 and I have 3 kids. It&#39;s time that my parents see me as an adult, and it&#39;s time that I start acting like one with them. It&#39;s just hard to change a relationship thats been one way for so long and turn it into the one that I need it to be for me and my family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And that means what?  If you are complying with the law there is NOTHING the<br/>
truant officer can do even if your mother does work for the school board.<br/>
Just keep your homeschool documentation (the stuff that proves you are<br/>
following the letter of the law) handy.  My brother is a police officer in a<br/>
neighboring town which does not have a truant officer (they have one<br/>
elementary, one middle and one high school - all located in the same block).<br/>
They &quot;contract&quot; out with the school district to investigate reports of<br/>
truancy (either provided by the schools or from individuals)  The first<br/>
thing that they always ask when an individual calls complaining about<br/>
truancy is &quot;Are they homeschooling?&quot; If the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>
they will contact the schools to see if the child is on the records. If not<br/>
they blow it off.   If it is &quot;yes&quot; they tell the caller that they are<br/>
powerless unless there is signs of physical abuse or neglect and hang up.<br/>
My brother&#39;s ex homeschooled their daughter for 4 years and knows what the<br/>
laws are in the state.  Most likely if your momcalled the truant officer she<br/>
would have to explain why she felt that the children were truant and I am<br/>
sure that homeschooling would eventually get mentioned.  If not they would<br/>
come and investigate and you would show them your compliance paperwork and<br/>
they would leave you alone.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I aked my mom once, &quot;Do you not trust me to make the best decisions that I<br/>
can for my children?&quot;  It always surprises me because my mother raised me<br/>
completely different from the way she was raised so I have a hard time<br/>
figuring out why she has a hard time dealing with me being even more radical<br/>
than she was.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925717509">Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
I can really relate to this. My 5 1/2 year old daughter is very similar. <br/>
We have had conversations that try me past the end of my patience, because <br/>
I feel as though she is purposely trying to annoy me. What I have realized <br/>
though is that almost always, she is simply processing things in a <br/>
different way from the way I do. She is putting some pieces together, and <br/>
something is about to click for her if I can just hang in there. I get <br/>
frustrated with it much more often than I would like, but I&#39;m learning. We <br/>
had one of these circular conversations yesterday, and after I felt as <br/>
though I answered the exact same question 6 times (literally)I snapped at <br/>
her. She got quiet, and I regretted it my reaction immediately. After <br/>
about 5 minutes, she was brave enough to make one more attempt, and she <br/>
phrased the question in a different way, and I realized that I had not <br/>
answered her question earlier at all. I had answered the question I <br/>
thought she was asking. I felt badly, and I thanked her for trying again, <br/>
and apologized for my behavior. She was so pleased when we got it cleared <br/>
up. <br/>
<br/>
I would have given the details to this situation, but I think it would <br/>
have been too hard to get across. It involved which pile of dirt among <br/>
three was best for the trees we were planting.<br/>
<br/>
Gayle   Mom to Faye - 5 1/2 and Annika - 4 in 2 weeks<br/>

<br/>
Now believe me...*I* know what I am dealing with here on a day to day <br/>
basis.  I&#39;m sure he needs more hugs - who doesn&#39;t?  It wasn&#39;t that he <br/>
should know whether it was warm or not.  It&#39;s that conversations with him <br/>
go in circles.  I&#39;ve been around enough 6 yr olds, and 6 yr old boys at <br/>
that to know when a conversation with one is out of the ordinary. <br/>

children are doing great with their studies. We have the perfect curriculum<br/>
for them.  They are thriving in their home environment.  Our social calendar<br/>
is as full as our learning calendar.  And they are right where they are<br/>
supposed to be academically.&quot;  I&#39;ve not told one lie but it eases her fears.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

  I need to do that. I plan to use the &quot;pass the bean dip&quot; response when I talk to her, I just tend to give more and more info. I&#39;m think I&#39;m trying to hard to make her understand where we are.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I find it quite interesting that when someone has a child who is the public<br/>
school system, people very very rarely question what curriculum they are<br/>
using and whether they are getting enough of the right kind of<br/>
socialization.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

  Ahh, part of my problem, not only is my little brother in school, my mom works in the school system.  So she thinks she knows all about cirriculum and what is needed at Jaidens age.  She is constantly asking me if Jaiden has reached this level yet, or covered this concept yet. Drives me nuts.<br/>
