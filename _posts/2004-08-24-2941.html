<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011924861">I remember hearing that Rudolf Steiner said that young children must wear<br/>
jackets when they&#39;re young, that they needed to protect their bodies so they<br/>
can be left to grow.  Young children he said,  could not tell whether they<br/>
were cold or not  .At the time I thought, mmm, sounds reasonable.  But when<br/>
I had a child and saw daily how he feels things exquisitely, I had to say,<br/>
HUNH?  Why wouldn&#39;t he be able to feel the cold of the air on his body as<br/>
well as bumping his toe. Well obviously he can so when he got old enough to<br/>
have a preference, I followed that.  He&#39;s a little steam engine and stays<br/>
very long while I&#39;m bundling up, shivering.<br/>
