8)  Remember that we can ask for &quot;do overs,&quot; &quot;rewinds,&quot; and &quot;try <br/>
agains.&quot; Our children need to hear us apologize and do better when we <br/>
screw up---and they&#39;re very generous with the number of times they&#39;ll <br/>
let us fix ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
9) At the same time, we don&#39;t GET a &quot;do over.&quot; Childhood is NOT a dress <br/>
rehearsal. This is the ONE chance we get with each child. We can&#39;t do <br/>
the whole childhood over once it&#39;s over. We only get this one shot.<br/>
<br/>
Often, we hear someone say that her parents are *much* better <br/>
grandparents than they ever were as parents---and she wishes they had <br/>
been that nice to *her* as a child.<br/>
<br/>
What a waste! Be the grandparent NOW to your own children! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

OMG!  I think that sometimes to remind myself how I<br/>
wish to be.  And it is funny, my father says that his<br/>
parents treated me and my brother so differently than<br/>
they treated him.  And I see how my dad is so<br/>
different with my kids than he was with us (although<br/>
he doesn&#39;t understand nor would he support the way we<br/>
choose to live).  Time to break that cycle! Laurie <br/>
