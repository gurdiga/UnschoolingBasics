<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653192653">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
My nearly 15 yo always unschooled son wants to go take some classes <br/>
at the local community college. He has decided he wants to be a vet <br/>
and wants to start taking a math class. He did the assesment tests at <br/>
the college and both scores for math and writing were so low they <br/>
don&#39;t want to admit him (of course reasding is at college level). <br/>
They don&#39;t want to make an exception, since they cannot believe he <br/>
can learn normally with such low scores. DUH, never heard of <br/>
unschoolers who suddenly decide to do something and then just do it??<br/>
Anyway, we are now looking for a crash course for math and one for <br/>
writing.<br/>
He needs to know the basicsof math: operations with whol numbers, <br/>
fractions, decimals;percentages;ratio and proportion; measurement.<br/>
And the basics of writing: grammar, sentence structure, etc. I don&#39;t <br/>
think he even needs to know how to spell for that.<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone have a child who was in this predicament? He is in a <br/>
hurry now and does not want to go thought a while taxt book. I will <br/>
help him do it quickly. hejust needs a really quick, but thorough and <br/>
well-done crash course for both.<br/>
<br/>
Who can help?<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644255044">There are some very nice self-paced sites for math where you can learn or<br/>
brush up on just the topics you need. I recommend that he check out the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
Math.com covers all of the areas of math you mentioned and you can select<br/>
the level from &quot;first glance&quot;, &quot;in depth&quot; or &quot;workout&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.math.com/">http://www.math.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
The Maths dictionary is excellent for all sorts of math concepts and<br/>
terminology he might need for an entrance exam. Most come with an animated<br/>
example of the concept or term being defined:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amathsdictionaryforkids.com/">http://www.amathsdictionaryforkids.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
For basic math practice, I enjoy the games at these sites:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://multiplication.com/interactive_games.htm">http://multiplication.com/interactive_games.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.games.exuberanteye.com/index.html">http://www.games.exuberanteye.com/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And there are a gajillion links to other online games listed on this site<br/>
(just found this one on Google)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://classroom.jc-schools.net/basic/math.html">http://classroom.jc-schools.net/basic/math.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Good luck to him in his studies!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187590369">Josh has really liked the &#39;for dummies&#39; books. They are short,  <br/>
concise and they really are misnamed, as they aren&#39;t for dummies at  <br/>
all ;-)<br/>
I&#39;ll bet there is a math for dummies, also, look for &quot;Kiss My Math&quot;,  <br/>
and then  &quot;Math Doesn&#39;t Suck&quot;. It&#39;s written by the girl from the  <br/>
Wonder Years, but dh and I skimmed through it and were really  <br/>
impressed at how easy she made it.<br/>
It&#39;s a little girly, but I don&#39;t know of any guy versions.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea on the grammar though, sorry,<br/>
Melissa<br/>

Perfect for his purposes, if he&#39;s okay with working online. It is very  <br/>
very well done and lets you move super fast through stuff you already  <br/>
know and gives you more time and help on stuff you don&#39;t know.<br/>

Elements of Style&quot; - two are beautifully illustrated &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed &quot;The Elephants of Style&quot; by Bill Walsh. It&#39;s funny  <br/>
and helpful.<br/>

His blog on that site is cool, too, as he relates grammar and  <br/>
punctuation to current culture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516056335">WOW, you are all fantastic! So much to look into. I will spend a big <br/>
part of the weekend looking at all the suggestions and I&#39;m positive one <br/>
of them will work well for him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much!<br/>
