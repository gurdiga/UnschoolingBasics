<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764757209">The &#39;Public School&#39; thread really hits home with me.  This is probably <br/>
completely OT of unschooling, but I know you will have some good advice <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Thomas (10) has decided to return to school this fall.  We&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling for nearly 2 years.  We started out doing &#39;school at <br/>
home&#39; but that changed to unschooling as Thomas refused to do any <br/>
school work.  Eventually, we worked our way to days spent on hs <br/>
outings, reading, Lego building, experiments, cooking, watching <br/>
historical documentaries, playing Game Cube, playing with Pokemon <br/>
cards.  All great stuff, but in his mind, not educational and a <br/>
complete waste of time, since now he&#39;s &#39;behind&#39; in math and writing.  <br/>
<br/>
Back in mid-June he announced he was going back.  He was confident and <br/>
sure of himself.  He had mentioned going back a few months earlier, but <br/>
was always crying and unsure.  Now that school is a week away, he&#39;s <br/>
angry, aggressive, unhappy - all the behaviours that mean he&#39;s feeling <br/>
unsure, worried, etc.  I understand the feelings and dh and I have told <br/>
him that it&#39;s ok/normal to be unsure, worried and all.<br/>
<br/>
But, how do I help him see the value of our unschooled lifestyle?  That <br/>
schools are not the only place learning of value happens, that he will <br/>
get that &#39;school stuff&#39; when he needs or wants it?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s made it 100% clear that he doesn&#39;t want me to be his teacher.  <br/>
What do I do if he comes home and he wants to do academics (or thinks <br/>
he needs to) but not with me.  Do I find a tutor, sign him up at Kumon, <br/>
try private school?  This kid is a thinker.  He wants to be doing <br/>
something.  How do I make him realize that everything he does is <br/>
worthwhile, and even if it isn&#39;t taught in a school, it still has <br/>
meaning and value. <br/>
<br/>
Confused and wanting to do the best for him.  He is so torn up about <br/>
this.  It is painful to see.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe the problem is why he wants to attend school- most kids nad <br/>
adults are scared that without school telling you you are learning <br/>
then you must not be- my son has been doing this and he is 14 but <br/>
his schooled friends and family and he is concerned he is missing <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
your son is 10 and a thinker- will he read about other unschooled <br/>
kids do you hang out with any unschoolers or can you find a group in <br/>
your area? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe each time you realize he learned something you say &quot;hey thats <br/>
not learning is it?&quot; or maybe get a hold of a grade level test and <br/>
give it to him or a check list of what his grade should know. Let <br/>
him test himself or look through a book- will the school let you <br/>
borrow one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is a math class he can take through community ed or a <br/>
friend or neighborhood high schooler that could give him lessons in <br/>
what ever subject he wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
unschooling is not about NEVER taking a class but taking a class for <br/>
the right reasons- learning- or entertainment. Maybe a video from <br/>
the library could help teach.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe trying out school and seeing what it is like will help him see <br/>
the value of unschooling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257364775">***or maybe get a hold of a grade level test and <br/>

<br/>
Using school methods to evaluate learning will not help him <br/>
understand learning is natural.  <br/>
<br/>
***Maybe there is a math class he can take through community ed or a <br/>
friend or neighborhood high schooler that could give him lessons in <br/>
what ever subject he wants to learn.***<br/>
<br/>
The problem is he still believes the way people learn is through <br/>
lessons and school and study.  Encouraging lessons and tests and <br/>
other schoolish methods is not the answer. <br/>
<br/>
***unschooling is not about NEVER taking a class but taking a class <br/>
for <br/>
the right reasons- learning- or entertainment. Maybe a video from <br/>
the library could help teach.***<br/>
<br/>
This case is not &quot;the right reason&quot; for classes.  The posters son <br/>
believes learning only happens from teaching and study.  More <br/>
teaching and study won&#39;t help them unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the mom could plan a lot of excursions and adventures away from <br/>
home, hiking, camping, swimming, going to the park to play Frisbee, <br/>
going to museums, movies, dinner theater, concerts,  bike rides, <br/>
etc.   Fill up his life with new things and new experiences.  Give <br/>
him lots to do and to think about.   Talk to him about news and world <br/>
events.  Read interesting articles or snippets of articles to him.  <br/>
Be on the lookout for things he likes and share them with him.  And <br/>
when the topic of school comes up, talk about the mistakes schools <br/>
make in not understanding that learning is natural.   Talk about why <br/>
and how people really learn.  Talk about how he (the posters son) <br/>
learned to walk and talk and how that kind of natural learning is <br/>
life long .   Tell him that sometimes we can&#39;t identify what we&#39;ve <br/>
learned but every experience builds on our model of the world and <br/>
helps us connect thoughts and ideas.  Tell him learning is happening <br/>
every minute, even when we can&#39;t see or define it.  Find ways to help <br/>
him trust himself.  Don&#39;t reinforce his belief that he needs school <br/>
methods in order to learn.<br/>

   <br/>
  Thanks for your response.  <br/>
   <br/>
  There are hsing classes at the local Community College that I think he would find a lot more interesting than school, but he&#39;s not interested.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We do hang out with a group of hsers - some unschoolers, some school-at-home types.  He has even met some older teens who have been unschooled for many years.  But he doesn&#39;t internalize it.  He thinks there is something different about them, something special,  something he doesn&#39;t have that makes them cool and successful.  He&#39;s unable to expand on that.<br/>
   <br/>
  I really don&#39;t think that classes are the answer, but if he asks for them, we&#39;ll take a look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-338155116">Ren, <br/>
   <br/>
  We live near Baltimore, MD and within driving distance of the Live and Learn conference.  Unfortunately, we&#39;ve got other commitments that weekend so we can&#39;t make it down there.  I was hoping to get up to Toronto last May, but sick kids and a travelling hubby made that impossible.  We will get to an unschooling conference someday!  <br/>
   <br/>
  It was great to meet some unschoolers at a local hsing event and Thomas did enjoy spending time with a few of the older boys.  Later, when talking to him about them, he seems to think they have special something that makes them successful.  Something he doesn&#39;t have, something he&#39;s missing.<br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;ve met some great unschoolers and continue to see them at various outings, but no one lives near enough to be &#39;best buds&#39; with. No one he can bounce ideas off.  Most of his hs friends are school-at-home types or attend various co-op classes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839303038">Deb,<br/>
  I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  He doesn&#39;t need any classes, he needs to unschool more fully.  He needs to realize that learning doesn&#39;t mean the painful lessons from school.  He needs to realize that everything he does has meaning, to trust that he is fine.<br/>
   <br/>
  But how do I help him to learn to trust himself?  I can talk to him until I&#39;m blue in the face and what he&#39;s doing is learning, but until he internalizes it, he still thinks of his days as wasted.  He also hates when I point out that something is &#39;educational&#39; or that he &#39;learned something from it&#39;.  He tells me that I ruin all his fun by pointing those things out.  I don&#39;t do it in a &quot;Ha ha, you just learned xyz by watching that show/playing Pokemon!&quot; kind of way.  I do it off-handedly, just casually, usually when we are chatting at bedtime.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And, if he really wants to go to school, should I allow him?  We&#39;ve looked into a private school that is much more open and relaxed.  It opens the week after ps so he has time to experience ps and check out the private one.   I would prefer him to stay home, but in all honesty, it&#39;s easier at home with the younger 2 without him here.  That&#39;s awful to say, and it hurts to admit it, but he is sooo difficult at home right now (and has been in the past).  I&#39;m certainly not giving up on him and I want him home, his brother and sister want him home, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t looking forward to time with the other 2 without him raining on our parade or interrupting.  Please don&#39;t think we don&#39;t include him, we always ask him to join, always leave it open for him to join, but his response is usually &quot;That&#39;s stupid!&quot; or some such comment and he messes up what we&#39;re doing or demands my attention.<br/>
   <br/>
  Gosh, it sounds like Thomas is a monster - he not!  He&#39;s sweet, kind and caring when all is settled in his mind.  But at times of uncertainty, he&#39;s rude, disrepectful, angry and destructive.    He has made huge leaps in dealing with his feelings more appropriately, but not all the time.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

  As I read this reply to my hubby, he nodded and said, &quot;This woman knows kids!  We need to do those things with Thomas.&quot;  This from the man who not 10 minutes earlier said, &quot;He&#39;s going to school and he can be miserable there!  He&#39;s driving me crazy!&quot;  When dh loses his patience, you know it&#39;s been tough around here!<br/>
   <br/>
  Tell us what he likes to do and we&#39;ll see if we can come up with <br/>
things to offer. Make life at home more interesting than school. <br/>
Fill him up at home so that he doesn&#39;t feel the need to look to <br/>
school to fill him up. <br/>
   <br/>
  He loves to read and be read to, work on his Legoland in the basement, play Pokemon on his DSLite, play Civilization IV with his dad, do science experiments (but not from a book! - from his &#39;What will happen if I do this? perspective&quot;, take things apart and not try to fix them or put them back together (he was in heaven when the VCR, vacuum and hand mixer broke all within a month!), loves to experiment with lit candles and various combinations of paper, pretzels and skewers, enjoys rock climbing, wrestling, biking, possibly skateboarding(is thinking about trying it), loves to go the physiotherapist with his dad (&quot;It&#39;s cool all the stuff they use to make Daddy&#39;s back better, and to watch him squirm!), outdoor activities like hikes with a purpose, bugs, animals, loves historical documentaries about wars, ancient civilizations, shows like Mythbusters, How&#39;s It Made and Dirty Jobs, Survivor, Amazing Race, music (piano and guitar)<br/>
   <br/>
  The one thing I would ask you to keep in mind is that it isn&#39;t just Thomas here.  We have a daughter who is 8 and another son who is 6.  They both love Thomas but wonder why he&#39;s so angry and nasty at times.  They are thrilled when he gives them a hug or kiss or does something special for them (&quot;He loves me, he really loves me!&quot; my little guy said in awe one day.)  Ally is old enough to stay for a couple hours at home by herself occasionally.  I&#39;ve been looking for someone Brian&#39;s age to trade off, but no luck yet.<br/>
   <br/>
  Not only are schools not the only place learning happens they are <br/>
among the least likely places for learning to happen.<br/>
Tell him that and tell him why. Tell him learning happens when <br/>
people have the freedom to pursue what they&#39;re interested in for as <br/>
long (or as short a time) as they want. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve explained this to him and used cooking as an example.  He was soo excited about cooking and he did it passionately for about 3 weeks and now he&#39;s done - no problem.  He and his sister spent 3 or 4 days making catapults out of scrap wood and clothes pins and hot glue.  We talked about what they had figured out on their own and then I asked how he thought it would have been presented a school.  He had a lot of fun telling me how those lessons would look in a school.<br/>
   <br/>
  Can you tell him that he doesn&#39;t have to start school at the <br/>
beginning of the year, that he could join any time? Ask him to wait <br/>
because you had so many things you wanted to do together and school <br/>
would get in the way. Then, get busy finding things to do and <br/>
places to go to make his life at home with you so busy and fun he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have time to think about school.  If he still wants to start school make sure he knows he can come home any time. <br/>
<br/>
  He knows he can come home anytime but he wants to start with his friends, or thinks he does.  He thinks it&#39;ll be harder to start late.  I agree with him.  If he waits and he&#39;s not feeling good about hsing then he&#39;ll be angry about not starting in Sept.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Do you think there are kids who have been &#39;damaged&#39; by school to such an extent that they cannot find themselves again?  He was in school for just over 3 years and he changed so much in those years. I want my pre-kindergarten Thomas back!<br/>

   <br/>
  We have actually met at a couple MPNL events - laser tag and the MPNL curriculum fair last spring.  Thomas loved the &#39;choose your own adventure-type&#39; movie your boys made.  He&#39;s the one I was referring to when I said that Thomas thought &quot;those boys had something special that I don&#39;t have&quot;.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll let you know about Sat. night. And, yes, he&#39;d love to hang out with some older unschooled kids some time.  To see other kids grow up, be interesting and obviously not stupid, would help him embrace unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697570707">This topic has started me thinking about something related- It seems to <br/>
me that my son as he got to be<br/>
about 10-11years old began to feel a little bored with things he had <br/>
been doing and was ready to<br/>
try some new more challenging things. I have talked to other parents of <br/>
kids this age who<br/>
have experienced something similar- a period of restlessness and boredom <br/>
while their child searches<br/>
around for themselves and moves into a new phase. This is sometimes when <br/>
a child might<br/>
decide to go to school- as it is something new and challenging out there <br/>
to attempt- especially if<br/>
nothing else is readily apparent.  I know Thomas has been in school <br/>
before, so this isn&#39;t new for him.<br/>
 A friend of mine with a son who is goinginto school for the first time <br/>
said something like this- he needs a new challenge, and that is where he <br/>
sees it. She wishes he would find some other interests such as my son <br/>
has but just hasn&#39;t seen<br/>
anything else that interests him. Maybe she doesn&#39;t realize that is her <br/>
job to search things out- or maybe<br/>
he really doesn&#39;t know yet- or possibly school is where he will find it.<br/>
<br/>
My son started to feel like he wanted to measure up in some more <br/>
traditional way at that time. He began to<br/>
be around more schooled kids here and there. He insisted that we buy a <br/>
math text book- I really<br/>
tried to suggest other ways to meet whatever need he had there but he <br/>
was very clear. He has had one<br/>
around since then and picks it up when he wants.  This is really not <br/>
important, though.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly he has made huge incredible leaps into the world out there and <br/>
gotten involved in many<br/>
ways with older kids and adults who share interests. He has been very <br/>
lucky in meeting people willing to<br/>
work with him, and his ability to focus on the task at hand and behave <br/>
responsibly has really<br/>
impressed people- it is almost comical how much positive feedback he <br/>
gets. I feel like jumping up<br/>
and down and saying See, See, it does work!! Yeah! I just smile.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe figure out how he can meet adults or older kids who are into what <br/>
he is doing and offer that as<br/>
an option. My son has done an apprenticeship with a luthier through a <br/>
local youth employment service,<br/>
taken music lessons with performing musicians, played magic with teens <br/>
and adult at a game store and at<br/>
the university game club, performed with adults at the farmers market, <br/>
an art museum opening, etc, will be setting<br/>
up sound for a local live music radio broadcast, had a job at the <br/>
science center(he was invited back), played<br/>
at open music jams at clubs, etc, invited to sit in on college music <br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
This can be harder for a 10-11 year old but once kids reach the teen <br/>
years more opportunities are available. And<br/>
once the adults see how great the kids is then the whole world opens up. <br/>
I think John Taylor Gatto talks about this - kids around this age really <br/>
thriving on being able to participate in real life rather than being <br/>
relegated to a kids world. (not all of them, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is now about 10 and was feeling a little frustrated at the <br/>
lack of opportunities for kids her age to work.<br/>
She is starting a jewelry business- her grandma will sell some, and she <br/>
will try to find some other ways to sell<br/>
things around here.<br/>

Yep. I knew I knew you!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could talk to Andrew about how insecure Andrew feels about his<br/>
math skills sometimes. (He keeps working on Algebra off and on).  But that <br/>
it is OK and he has no plans to go back to traditional school so that they <br/>
can &quot;teach him&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe a Pokemon day at the local library room or something.  My boys have no <br/>
problems reviving<br/>
their past love with younger cousins etc.<br/>
I may have to disagree a little with those who say &quot;no schooly things&quot;.  I <br/>
think it provides a base of security in the transitional stages.  I have <br/>
found that as we went from eclectic to unschooling my kids quickly began to <br/>
recognize<br/>
the arbirary nature of things and got too busy to be bothered and we <br/>
gradually dropped them one by one.<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if Thomas ever went to school but going &quot;cold turkey&quot; can <br/>
be harder on some than others.<br/>
Providing them with all those fun &quot;other&quot; things is still best of course.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Please don&#39;t think we don&#39;t include him, we always ask him to join, <br/>

usually &quot;That&#39;s stupid!&quot; or some such comment and he messes up what <br/>
we&#39;re doing or demands my attention.<br/>
************************<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that the situation with the other two kids is a big <br/>
big part of *why* he wants to go back to school. It sounds like he <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel connected to what&#39;s going on in the family so he&#39;s <br/>
looking to school to provide a sense of connection. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m stuck especially by the comments that &quot;we always ask him to <br/>
join&quot; and that he has to &quot;demand... attention&quot;. That makes it sound <br/>
like there&#39;s an us-and-him mentality in the house. Worse, the &quot;us&quot; <br/>
is frequently making the decisions about what&#39;s going on in the home <br/>
and &quot;he&quot; can only agree or not. <br/>
<br/>
In order to unschool with your guy, he&#39;s going to need to feel like <br/>
a valued member of the family. When Ray moved in with us, it was <br/>
easy for me to see that one of the things &quot;we&quot; needed to do was to <br/>
help him feel valued and a part of the family as much as possible <br/>
right from the start. It may be that since your guy has lived with <br/>
you all along it didn&#39;t occur to you that you&#39;d have to go through a <br/>
similar process. You may have just assumed it was a matter <br/>
of &quot;fitting him in&quot;. Oops.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing a new kid into an already unschooling family is similar to <br/>
having a new baby. There needs to be a whole lot of thought and <br/>
energy and time given to the new unschooler - his emotional needs <br/>
are going to be greater for awhile. He&#39;s going to need more support <br/>
and more attention for awhile. He&#39;s going to need &quot;babying&quot; to some <br/>
extent.<br/>
<br/>
When Ray first moved in, I was shocked at how little he seemed to be <br/>
able to do independenly, compared to Mo. Some of that is personality <br/>
(Ray is very social) but a lot of it, especially at first, had to do <br/>
with the fact that he wasn&#39;t used to having much autonomy. At 13 he <br/>
needed at whole lot more help - and the gentlest most non-<br/>
judgemental help possible - than a much younger child. Its possible <br/>
your guy needs waaaaay more help than you&#39;ve been offerring him. <br/>
School has trashed his self-confidence and he needs mom and dad to <br/>
help him build it back, through tons of non-judgemental support. <br/>
<br/>
School has also trained him that the *last* thing he wants to do is <br/>
ask for help, so the closest he can get to that is by being <br/>
demanding or obstructive. Sound familiar? <br/>
<br/>
*************************<br/>
Do you think there are kids who have been &#39;damaged&#39; by school to <br/>
such an<br/>
extent that they cannot find themselves again? He was in school for <br/>
just over 3<br/>
years and he changed so much in those years. I want my pre-<br/>
kindergarten Thomas<br/>
back!<br/>
*************************<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s still plenty young enough to heal from his schooling, <br/>
but he&#39;s going to need a whole lot of really tangible support. <br/>
Maybe, rather than arguing with him about school, you can go to him <br/>
and say &quot;Look, I think we (mom and dad) really messed up, here. We <br/>
haven&#39;t been paying enough attention to you and your needs and <br/>
that&#39;s why it seems like you haven&#39;t been learning anything. Can we <br/>
please have another chance?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And, as Deb said, find a gazillion things to do with him. And maybe <br/>
*for* him as well. Are there little ways you can show some care and <br/>
thoughtfulness? Spend a little extra of the family budget on him for <br/>
awhile? Get/do more things just for him? Talk honestly with the <br/>
other kids about this, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145835065">When I read your first e-mail and the first part of a more recent one, I wrote the <br/>
following: <br/>
<br/>
Have either of you read &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn? <br/>
It might give you both a jumping off point for understanding learning without <br/>
school and being able to discuss it.  Though it&#39;s aimed at teens, there&#39;s a wealth <br/>
of knowledge applicable to all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read this part: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I  would prefer him to stay home, but in all honesty, it&#39;s easier at home with <br/>
&gt; the  younger 2 without him here. That&#39;s awful to say, and it hurts to admit it, <br/>
&gt; but  he is sooo difficult at home right now (and has been in the past).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; snip&lt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Please don&#39;t think we don&#39;t include him, we always ask him to join, always leave it open for him <br/>
&gt; to  join, but his response is usually &quot;That&#39;s stupid!&quot; or some such comment and he <br/>
&gt; messes up what we&#39;re doing or demands my attention. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gosh, it sounds like Thomas is a monster - he not! He&#39;s sweet, kind and <br/>
&gt; caring when all is settled in his mind. But at times of uncertainty, he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; rude,  disrepectful, angry and destructive. He has made huge leaps in dealing with <br/>
&gt; his feelings more appropriately, but not all the time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like more is going on here than school vs unschooling.  He&#39;s been in school while<br/>
younger ones have been home, right?  Do you think that maybe he might really *need* more attention?  He could be feeling wrong or different and if he&#39;s sensitive (and it appears to me that he might be) he&#39;ll feel this keenly, whether anything is said aloud or not. Kids who feel<br/>
&quot;not right&quot; are going to look for alternatives to feeling bad. That might mean school...<br/>
<br/>
I have two more book recommendations, in this case: The Highly Sensitive Child <br/>
by Elaine Aron and The Explosive Child by Ross Greene. Both of these books <br/>
(though they do have chapters that focus on dealing with school) helped me understand <br/>
more about who my dd is and what I can do as a parent to help her. There is <br/>
great informatiion about how to see a child in a different light. They helped me see the <br/>
underlying &quot;sweet, kind and caring&quot; person she is in the midst of difficult moments.  I realized <br/>
that if it&#39;s hard for me during these times, it&#39;s even harder for her. <br/>
<br/>
I am better able to understand her triggers, her sensitivities and notice my own unconscious<br/>
behaviors that were making things worse. I&#39;m not expert at it, yet, but I try to change for the<br/>
better each interaction that I&#39;m aware of.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, can you spend time with him and just him?  He&#39;s only 10 (still young).  He may need as much of your love and attention as your younger ones.  Some focused doing-what-he-wants-to-do time might help.  But don&#39;t make it a &quot;learning experience,&quot; just connecting time. <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of learning, my sensitive dd would be really annoyed by me pointing <br/>
out how much and what she&#39;s learning, even if she was talking about &quot;not learning enough&quot;.  She <br/>
often just wants to be heard - to have attention paid to how she&#39;s feeling.  It would be pointing out ( at least, to her) where she might be deficient, if I did otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better for her that I&#39;m interested in what she&#39;s doing and what she wants to tell me without the commentary. Her learning is her learning and my quantifying it diminishes her experience. This may not be true for your ds, but it&#39;s something to consider. I make a mental note of what I see, but I usually refrain from &quot;framing&quot; her activities in terms of &quot;education&quot; to her.  &quot;Hearing&quot; her is more important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962482735">Robin,<br/>
   <br/>
  What you say is true.  <br/>
   <br/>
  He does crave 1:1 time with me, or hubby.  He often asks for it and we say yes whenever we can.  It doesn&#39;t happen all the time, with 2 other kids also wanting the 1:1 time.  I try to schedule it in, but sometimes he asks for it, verbally or non, and it just can&#39;t happen.  He&#39;s actually said to me, &quot;Why can&#39;t we have time together when they have quiet time?&quot;  It makes perfect sense, so we do.  Some days I just need 10 minutes on my own and he respects that and then we do something.  When he&#39;s had the 1:1 time, he is so much happier - all the kids are.  <br/>
   <br/>
  He has always been sensitive and when he&#39;s feeling not right, it is obvious to all.  We are not giving him what he needs here at home so he&#39;s looking elsewhere for it - school could be the place (he thinks).  Today was a better day though.  We kept busy finishing a read-aloud, burning things, Lego building.  I made a point of asking him what he wanted to do - go to Target and buy the Firestation Lego set he saved up for.  We went, found it and came home.  While he built it I sat in the same room and read to his sister.  When he got tired of building, I helped him finish.  He was thrilled.  When hubby got home they played Civ. IV and then I layed down with him at bedtime.  He was pretty content.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As for quantifying his learning, I understand that by pointing out the learning I was  making him feel inadequate (I&#39;m sure that if I asked him, he&#39;d tell me it&#39;s so.)<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for all the food-for-thought.  I&#39;ll check out the books you mentioned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940515616">I really think is a destructive situation that has been created in the <br/>
country in having such a separation between people of different ages- <br/>
physical separation as well as differences in rights and access to work <br/>
and many other things. I realize there are/were good reasons for child <br/>
labor laws- but  compulsory schooling only seems to be minimal <br/>
improvement- perhaps(though not always) the kids are at least physically <br/>
safe and can get outside a little more. In my daily life I am repeatedly <br/>
struck by the disrespectful things people say about young people and <br/>
even their own children (most of these are homeschooling families).  I <br/>
cringe especially when people say negative things about teens in <br/>
general- to the effect of: oh, now that you are a teenager you are <br/>
destined to become even more annoying and useless. I would say that my <br/>
son, who is 14 has better skills at getting along with all kinds of <br/>
people and being helpful and seeing what needs to be done in a situation <br/>
than many adults I know.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is transition from childhood is made difficult by arbitrary <br/>
limits- for example kids not being able to hold jobs until they are 14. <br/>
When if an environment is safe and the young person is choosing to work <br/>
and has enough to eat and time to sleep and rest and not work, that <br/>
could really be the absolute best thing for that young person- to be <br/>
involved in a work environment.<br/>
<br/>
It is frustrating not be allowed to do things because of your age. Young <br/>
people of many ages can do real and significant things - they often <br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to. They are in a holding tank where they are supposed to <br/>
learn first all things other things which they are supposed to need to <br/>
know before they are able to do something real.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of interesting things out there that adults are doing <br/>
for pay or for fun or to help someone, or all three. It is a challenge <br/>
and requires some persistence in the parent&#39;s part in convincing other <br/>
adults to allow a young person to participate. We have found some great <br/>
people willing to allow our son to do real things- he has also been <br/>
involved in situations where he thinks he will be able to do something <br/>
real but actually isn&#39;t- this is very frustrating. I do see a trend at <br/>
least in our area towards recognizing that teens at least benefit from <br/>
being involved with adults in work situations- which is encouraging. <br/>
There are many more things available to our son now that he is 14.<br/>

****I&#39;m glad you brought this up, my oldest just turned 12 and he has<br/>
been having that feeling. Some days he tells me he is bored with<br/>
everything he has and I try to offer suggestions but it&#39;s not what he<br/>
wants. I think there is something about this age also and he wants to do<br/>
something real and significant. I appreciate knowing that others go<br/>
through this, heck it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had a 12 yr old boy &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s<br/>
all new, everyday and stage of development.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631337029">There seems to be a real change happening in the preteen and early <br/>
teen years- I letting go of childish or even current things. I <br/>
chance to examine the future and think about things. This is <br/>
probably why it becomes such a tug of war between parents and teens. <br/>
<br/>
I think they need choices to drop things they no longer want to do <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164948373">Hi Jen,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What you say is true. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He does crave 1:1 time with me, or hubby. He often asks for it and we say yes <br/>
&gt; whenever we can. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time, with 2 other kids also wanting <br/>
&gt; the 1:1 time. I try to schedule it in, but sometimes he asks for it, verbally <br/>
&gt; or non, and it just can&#39;t happen. He&#39;s actually said to me, &quot;Why can&#39;t we have <br/>
&gt; time together when they have quiet time?&quot; It makes perfect sense, so we do. <br/>
&gt; Some days I just need 10 minutes on my own and he respects that and then we do <br/>
&gt; something. When he&#39;s had the 1:1 time, he is so much happier - all the kids <br/>
&gt; are. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I undertstand that it&#39;s harder with more than one.  I only have one, so I can&#39;t give any suggestions on that score &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; He has always been sensitive and when he&#39;s feeling not right, it is obvious to <br/>
&gt; all. We are not giving him what he needs here at home so he&#39;s looking elsewhere <br/>
&gt; for it - school could be the place (he thinks). Today was a better day though. <br/>
&gt; We kept busy finishing a read-aloud, burning things, Lego building. I made a <br/>
&gt; point of asking him what he wanted to do - go to Target and buy the Firestation <br/>
&gt; Lego set he saved up for. We went, found it and came home. While he built it I <br/>
&gt; sat in the same room and read to his sister. When he got tired of building, I <br/>
&gt; helped him finish. He was thrilled. When hubby got home they played Civ. IV <br/>
&gt; and then I layed down with him at bedtime. He was pretty content. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>See?  You knew just what he needed, all the time :-)  This sounds like a great day together.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; As for quantifying his learning, I understand that by pointing out the <br/>
&gt; learning I was making him feel inadequate (I&#39;m sure that if I asked him, he&#39;d <br/>
&gt; tell me it&#39;s so.) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be good to ask him.  It could be something different, too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thanks for all the food-for-thought. I&#39;ll check out the books you mentioned. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome &lt;g&gt;.  Happy reading!  And while I think of it. Anne Ohman&#39;s list &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; might be worth a look.  I&#39;ve learned lots from the wise folks there, also.<br/>
