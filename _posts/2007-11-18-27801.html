However, our 4-yo. tells her that she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>

 <br/>
Have you talked with your 4 YO about why it is she doesn&#39;t want to be  <br/>
friends.  It might be something really simple to help with.  I would  never push my <br/>
kids to be friends, or to play with someone or to share.   That just isn&#39;t how <br/>
we work.  But I might help her find words to express  how she feels (once I <br/>
knew really how she felt, maybe she doesn&#39;t like how the  girl dresses, or how <br/>
she plays with other children, maybe it is just as simple  as she would rather <br/>
play with you, or would rather not play in that group  setting)  in a way <br/>
that doesn&#39;t hurt the other child&#39;s feelings, but still  gets her point across.  <br/>
KWIM.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s actually a little comical, but once she pushed the 3-yo. and I<br/>
said &quot;please use words&quot; and she said&quot;, I did, but she doesn&#39;t listen.&quot;<br/>
 LOL.  I think that the 3-yo. just loves her and wants to be with her<br/>
all the time.  This is too much for my 4-yo.  I&#39;ve spoken to the 3-yo.<br/>
about how my 4-yo. needs alone time and have tried to distract her,<br/>
but this only works on occassion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would  never push my <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No I don&#39;t push my kids to be friends or share, either, but I know<br/>
that in this particular group, which we have been members of<br/>
for over 5 years, I do tend to feel pressured. Part of me wants to<br/>
leave the group, but my kid&#39;s and I have made some really wonderful<br/>
friends. None are radical unschoolers - not even close, but I still<br/>
feel the pros outweigh the cons at this moment. If only I could find<br/>
a group of radical unschoolers in our area - but I&#39;ve tried without<br/>
success. The closest group is over 2 hours away and that just isn&#39;t<br/>
feasible right now (especially with gas prices - ugh!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I might help her find words to express  how she feels (once I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; knew really how she felt, maybe she doesn&#39;t like how the  girl<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dresses, or how <br/>

 </span></blockquote>would rather <br/>

 </span></blockquote>a way <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that doesn&#39;t hurt the other child&#39;s feelings, but still  gets her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>point across.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m still struggling with the tone and language of my<br/>
daughter. On occassion, calling the 3-yo. &quot;stupid&quot; and telling her <br/>
that she &quot;hates&quot; her. I try to tell her that she can express things<br/>
differently without namecalling, such as saying &quot;I don&#39;t feel like<br/>
playing right now.&quot; But I feel that even this carries some of my<br/>
negative energy. If you have any ideas for how to deal with this, I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear them.<br/>

 <br/>
I personally would try helping her find words like you suggested (I don&#39;t  <br/>
feel like playing right now) and help her practice those phrases before she goes <br/>
 to the park.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My youngest had a period of time back along when he did  not want to go to <br/>
park day because of a couple of children.  It is hard to  &quot;get away&quot; from those <br/>
children.  You could try inviting families of your  choosing over to your <br/>
house, for a play day or craft day or something.  I  know I have two children and <br/>
my oldest always wanted to go to the park, so I  would have other alternatives <br/>
that my youngest liked to do, when he did not want  to play.  Like we would <br/>
bring books and I would read to him in the car or  at the picnic tables.  I <br/>
would bring DVDs and would sit in the car  with him to watch them, etc.  A couple <br/>
of times I would bring Art Trading  Card stuff, everyone would get involved <br/>
in making their own so it wasn&#39;t a  &quot;cooperative&quot; thing to do.  So that he <br/>
would not feel the pressure to play  and would not have to continually be asked to <br/>
play and why he didn&#39;t want to  play etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am sure there are other alternatives so that your one  child can feel more <br/>
secure, and not have to use harsh words to get her point  across.  Remember to <br/>
validate her and let her know that it is fine to not  want to play, she does <br/>
not have to play if she does not want to.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know my youngest would resort to names like &quot;stupid&quot; if the other child  <br/>
were persisting.  KWIM.  Like his frustration level was building, so  having <br/>
things at the park that your daughter can do alone, or that comfort  her, might <br/>
help with that frustration level.   Have a way that  she can let you know that <br/>
she is getting frustrated and needs help maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017683300">Thanks, Pam.  Those ideas are very helpful.  I do struggle, because<br/>
the older one looks forward all week to playgroup day and the little<br/>
one loves her yoga class (but that might be because she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to play with anyone - lol).  But focusing more on giving her things<br/>
that she can just do on her own, as you suggested, is a great idea.  I<br/>
do tell her that it is o.k. to not play with others or share if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to.  I guess continuing to give her better words to use<br/>
is the second part.  I just have to work on doing that part with<br/>
positive not negative energy (because I&#39;m usually thinking negative<br/>
thoughts when I tell her).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for some great suggestions!<br/>
