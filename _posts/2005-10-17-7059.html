<div id="ygrps-yiv-91430737">I wrote an update to my blog on Public School vs Unschooling here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://key-words.blogspot.com/2005/10/ps-vs-us-redux.html">http://key-words.blogspot.com/2005/10/ps-vs-us-redux.html</a><br/>
<br/>
basically dealing with unschooling philosophy when allowing your child to go<br/>

Hope you enjoy it!<br/>
