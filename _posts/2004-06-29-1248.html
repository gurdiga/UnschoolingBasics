<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449033342">Once again I have to say I&#39;m no expert in this feild, BUT.....My 3rd son  was <br/>
in a preschool similar to the one it sounds like your stepson is in.   They <br/>
went so far as to tell me before he left for K that he would not be  accepted <br/>
due to the fact that he didn&#39;t know his alphabet backwards, forwards,  and <br/>
unside down.  ok, it those weren&#39;t their words, but what I am trying to  say is <br/>
they expected way too much out of him.  And he was only 4!   When he went to K <br/>
screening, he blew them away with what he knew.  I think  these people that run <br/>
some of the preschools push and push to make themselves  look good to attract <br/>
more customers.<br/>
  Now, at this point, he is 6.  He would not sit down to  workbooks or <br/>
writing (this was before we found unschooling!) and now i&#39;ve  absolutly stopped <br/>
pushing him.  His absolute favorite thing is to be read  to.  I do that whenever <br/>
he wants and especially at bedtime, he just loves  it so much.  But, I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed over the last few months that he won&#39;t even  try to answer questions <br/>
sometimes, and i&#39;ve come to the conculsion that he was  pushed so hard in prek that <br/>
now he has a fear of having a wrong answer.   This is the honest to God truth. <br/>
 He is just not starting to ask tons of  questions that other kids would have <br/>
started doing a long time ago, and thats  not to compare him to anyone else, <br/>
but being my 3rd I pretty much realize when  they start doing this.  So its <br/>
taken almost a year to deschool him from  something so innocent as prek.  Oh if <br/>
I could only go back and do it  differently I would.  <br/>
  Why does anyone expect a 4year old to read?  Sure, there are  alot of them, <br/>
especially girls, that DO read by then, and alot of them seemingly  on their <br/>
own.  But boys have a way different makeup then girls.  Why  would he even <br/>
need to ability to write at 4? (and i&#39;m questioning all 4  year olds, i&#39;m not <br/>
attacking you!)  <br/>
  My strongest advice to you from somone who has been there is to stop  <br/>
pushing, read on child development, especially good is John Holt, and then ask  the <br/>
prek what and why they are expecting so much out of someone who has only  <br/>
been in this world for 4 years!<br/>

<br/>
   I was a an owner/preschool teacher in what feels like my past life and I<br/>
can tell you from experience that the main cause of such strict curriculum<br/>
is the parents themselves and the kindergarten teachers.  I was happy with<br/>
learning through play, but after hearing the majority of parents demanding a<br/>
better education for their children or they were going to move them to the<br/>
stricter place down the road you almost begin to feel forced in to it.  I<br/>
ended up expected way too much from those kids and started hating my job.<br/>
Now I stay home with my kids and Unschool.<br/>
   FYI a great majority of the kids I took care of ended up burning out at<br/>
school and staying back a grade.  Most were also in special ed. classes,<br/>
because they had a hard time focusing on their work.  I feel terrible about<br/>
letting those parents convince me that it was good to push their kids.  I&#39;m<br/>
glad I&#39;m out of that business.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276227270">We live and we learn. I just remembered a bit ago that they left my sons  <br/>
shoes untied, because he wouldn&#39;t (couldn&#39;t) learn to tie them, at 4.   ERRRRRR!<br/>

 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>
