&gt; &gt; I agree we need to support his goals<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know the feeling. My kid wants to be a Broadway musical theater<br/>
&gt; star. I have the same concerns about that bursting bubble, that you<br/>
&gt; do, even though my kid is talented and hard-working and has a<br/>
&gt; (remote) chance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - we support that interest, entirely and wholeheartedly.<br/>

preforming arts.  They get a chance to get some &quot;professional<br/>
time&quot;under their wings and beef up their resume.  There used to be a<br/>
young girl at my church who was so gung-ho on being a Broadway<br/>
actress.  She went to college and found out about this program.  Every<br/>
summer she would go there and work and she did a 2 year internship<br/>
there after she graduated from college.  She loved it!  I wish I knew<br/>
what she was doing now because she was one of those really neat kids<br/>
that was truly living her passion.  I don&#39;t know if she ever made it<br/>
to Broadway, but I do know that she had many wonderful adventures<br/>
getting there!<br/>

theater friends work there and I imagine she&#39;ll be wanting to work  <br/>
there, soon. They are characters (Stitch, Prince Charming), they  <br/>
dance down the street in the parades, they&#39;re in the Aladdin show,  <br/>
etc. I&#39;ll have to look into any actual internship programs.<br/>
