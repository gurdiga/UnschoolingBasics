<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900073989"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m new to unschooling basics, and I haven&#39;t read the archives.  I&#39;m Lucy,<br/>
&gt;and I live in Texas with my husband, and four kids.  I would say we are<br/>
&gt;extremely relaxed, but leaning toward unschooling more, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to say hello Lucy.  I&#39;m in Texas too, North of Dallas in<br/>
Plano/Allen area.  Wanted to let you know, in case you didn&#39;t of a<br/>
conference in Irving, TX.  It&#39;s called Rethinking Education.  If you<br/>
register before April 30 the fees are almost half.  Someone in  local<br/>
unschooling group recommended it to me.<br/>
