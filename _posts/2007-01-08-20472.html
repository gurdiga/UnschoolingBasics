<div id="ygrps-yiv-401060403">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;After this child ate and ate and ate she told him &quot;you&#39;re teeth <br/>
will<br/>
fall out&quot;. And just for the record.. that IS true. Sugar rots teeth,<br/>
no matter what you say.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to break it but this is not true!  It may effect SOME people <br/>
that way if they live on candy alone and never brush their teeth but <br/>
it has more to do with genetics than anything.  My son only brushed <br/>
his teeth about once a month and ate plenty of candy when he was much <br/>
younger.  We went to the dentist and I was sure that he was going to <br/>
have cavities and that just might get him to brush his teeth more <br/>
often.  Well, NO cavities, not a one, and we only go to the dentist <br/>
once every three or four years.  In fact, all my kids eat candy and <br/>
only one of my children has ever had a cavity and it was so small they <br/>
ground it down in about 5 seconds with no numbing involved.<br/>
<br/>
Saying candy rots your teeth is like saying if you tan in a tanning <br/>
bed you WILL get cancer.  Wrong!  There are a lot of factors involved.</div>
