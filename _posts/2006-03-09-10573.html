<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650759286">&quot;I agree but what this mom wrote above &quot;forced&quot; can appear alarming<br/>
depending <br/>
how it was done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The word forced was the mother&#39;s not mine.<br/>
<br/>
We all got in my mini-van and I got my DD secured in her car seat and<br/>
checked with my DS that he was buckled in - I got - I already did it mom! I<br/>
responded that that was great. The other mother climbed in the front next to<br/>
me and I looked back and her daughter was unbuckled.<br/>
<br/>
I always give a choice that I guess isn&#39;t always much of a choice but I<br/>
asked her, &quot;Can you buckle yourself in or do you need help?&quot; She responded<br/>
that she didn&#39;t need help. I fiddled with my MP3 player to find my son&#39;s<br/>
requested song and looked back again and she was still needed to buckle her<br/>
seatbelt.<br/>
<br/>
I repeated that her seatbelt needed buckled and that I knew my backseat was<br/>
sometimes tricky. The seatbelts sometimes hide between and they can be<br/>
difficult for the kids to find. She responded that she didn&#39;t want to buckle<br/>
her seat belt.<br/>
<br/>
My DS ever the helper said that he could do it. Jumped up and helped her<br/>
buckle her seat belt. It wasn&#39;t even me who buckled it. My son is used to us<br/>
have younger and older kids in our mini-van needing help finding the buckle.<br/>
<br/>
The other mother was noticeably irritated when I asked her the problem she<br/>
went on and on about that unschoolers don&#39;t have rules and that she would<br/>
never force her daughter to buckle her seat belt and then on and on about<br/>
the other things my family does wrong as unschoolers. How it is one thing to<br/>
be safe and another to be neurotic about it.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to share the full story I guess because I was afraid she was<br/>
right and that - while I will accept that occasionally I have some control<br/>
issues that I try very hard to bring my son the world he wants not the one I<br/>
want him to be in. To be honest, I have found that my son&#39;s world is simple,<br/>
peaceful and fun - mine would have been full of stuff to do but potentially<br/>
less fun.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me feel worlds better that there other unschoolers concerned with<br/>
safety and I now feel less neurotic. I don&#39;t know yet what I am going to say<br/>
to the other mother...maybe I will just suggest that we ride separately next<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone who responded...<br/>

She should have respected your family value/safety/love for everyone&#39;s good  <br/>
health. <br/>
<br/>
The other mom was wrong. I think I get was she was &quot;trying&quot; to say but  seems <br/>
as if she did have great issues with you so much so she felt  the needed to <br/>
draw attention to that.<br/>
 <br/>
Rules are something that unschoolers don&#39;t agree with but not in the  way she <br/>
used it. Safety is important and we do have values. Some take that  deeper <br/>
and call them rules. If a family eats dinner together that&#39;s a value. If  you <br/>
choose to eat alone and are disciplined for doing so that&#39;s a  rule/punishment. <br/>
That in turn takes the value out of family bc then the joy and  happiness had <br/>
just been removed.  <br/>

What took place is much different than what I had in my mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for telling more of this story. What was interesting to me  <br/>
about it was that the daughter didn&#39;t seem to object to being  <br/>
buckled--that she might not have done it on her own but didn&#39;t seem  <br/>
to distressed about having it done. But the mother took what sounds  <br/>
like a fairly gentle and straightforward request and offer of help  <br/>
meeting the request as &quot;forcing.&quot; And then used that as an excuse to  <br/>
let you know about your other character flaws as well....ewwww.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this mother thinks of any request or persuasion as &quot;forcing.&quot;  <br/>
Which would be an interesting discussion, I think--at what point does  <br/>
persuasion become coercion?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221838429">Time..breathing and not setting a child up as clearly appears to be what  <br/>
took place here.<br/>
 <br/>
The mom (of the un-seat-belted child)should have known her choice of no  <br/>
seatbelts would be an issue for nearly all drivers. I wonder is this mom has a  <br/>
car and drives?<br/>
She needs a reality check and should have seen it coming. A freedom of no  <br/>
seat belts IS a safety issue not to mention against the law. All I am suggesting <br/>
 is time. Being in a rush is challenging but I personally wouldn&#39;t put my <br/>
child  in another car and expect that driver to risk being fined.<br/>
For clarity my kids wear seatbelts and I am not advocating going without at  <br/>
all...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917935302">&quot;It&#39;s refreshing to hear that there&#39;s someone else out there that<br/>
understands that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean your kid is a &#39;little adult&#39;<br/>
with all the knowledge and abilities an adult has to be able to find<br/>
the information they need to make informed decisions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm.....<br/>
this list is here to examine and encourage a partnership with your<br/>
children. While I don&#39;t see children as &quot;little adults&quot; (that would be<br/>
disrespecting their development) I also think they DO have quite a bit<br/>
of wisdom in making choices and I am here to assist them in that<br/>
exploration of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Unlimited sugar, tv and no bedtimes, does not equal a &quot;free for all&quot;.<br/>
What it means around here is that my children will roast marshmallows<br/>
and throw one away because they&#39;ve decided they have had enough. My<br/>
5y.o. will eat brocolli for dinner and all of them know how to listen<br/>
to their bodies. They do it better than I!!<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll turn down a lot of things I wouldn&#39;t have. Balance is a<br/>
wonderful thing and you can&#39;t learn to feel balance when another human<br/>
being is making a bunch of decisions for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are so right!  I think it was fairly well demonstrated in a post <br/>
about ps friends spending the night and eating everything in the <br/>
house...obviously didn&#39;t know when to stop, there was no link to their <br/>
internal balance. <br/>
 I have a cousin who was raised by a very strict mom...no sweets, only <br/>
healthy food, ect...whenever she and her brother came to our house <br/>
they gorged themselves on our candy.  Every single time they came!  <br/>
Their mom eventually found out about it and made them stop coming.  If <br/>
they had been given free rein in their food usage, I don&#39;t think they <br/>
would have rebelled so...my brother, sister and I had complete freedom <br/>
and LOVED to go to their house and eat all the wonderful &quot;healthy&quot; <br/>
things her mom made.  I do believe she would have enjoyed them more if <br/>
it hadn&#39;t been such an issue.  <br/>
If you are (as in a school) being told when to eat and when to drink <br/>
and when to &quot;go&quot;, how can you learn to listen to your body?  Instead <br/>
you learn to ignore the messages your body sends.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441436708">I sort-of see this just as I would see it if it were about smoking in<br/>
someone else&#39;s home.  It&#39;s about respect.  I have a non-smoking home and<br/>
would never think that someone would come into my home and just light-up<br/>
knowing that there is no smoking in my home.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s her choice... ride with you = wear a seatbelt.  Just as it would be<br/>
riding a carnival ride... want to ride = buckle up!  It&#39;s that simple. <br/>
There is no issue here!  None. Zip.<br/>
<br/>
That mom was out of line telling Shannon that she doesn&#39;t unschool because<br/>
they have to wear seatbelts in her car.  Out of line because she&#39;s imposing<br/>
her views about so called &quot;schooly&quot; things.  Since when does unschooling<br/>
give anyone a right to tell someone else what to do?  You could be so anti<br/>
this or that... that you know longer unschool because your anti becomes the<br/>
only thing that is allowed in your home.<br/>

&gt; I agree but what this mom wrote above &quot;forced&quot; can appear alarming   <br/>
&gt; depending<br/>
&gt; how it was done. That is my issue with this conversation. I refuse to<br/>
&gt; promote &quot;force&quot; (equal as in police use of force) attached to  <br/>
&gt; unschooling.  Safety<br/>
&gt; is good but force is NOT the solution with a child in this  <br/>
&gt; situation.  Force<br/>
&gt; does NOT equal unschooling..<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a solution, then, do you think, in the moment? Imagine that  <br/>
Mom 1 requires seatbelts in her car; Mom 2 does not. Mom 2 and her  <br/>
kids are riding with Mom 1, and there&#39;s not much opportunity to  <br/>
change that for this outing though not sharing rides could be a  <br/>
solution in the future. Mom 2 will not ask her kids to wear seatbelts  <br/>
in Mom 1&#39;s car.  What can Mom 1 do?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m shifting this to a hypothetical because that wasn&#39;t the question  <br/>
the original poster asked about and I don&#39;t want her to feel like  <br/>
we&#39;re talking about what she should have done. But I&#39;m having trouble  <br/>
generating solutions and wonder what people think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981920366">&quot; Since when does unschooling<br/>
give anyone a right to tell someone else what to do? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I was thinking. If that other Mom does things differently,<br/>
that&#39;s fine, but beating Shannon up over her choices (unschooling or<br/>
not) was inappropriate in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends that don&#39;t unschool, some that unschool but control<br/>
several things we don&#39;t, I never felt like it was my place to tell<br/>
them how to do things unless they asked. I do share bits and pieces<br/>
when appropriate of course.<br/>
<br/>
Last week a Mom commented that she doesn&#39;t allow violent video games<br/>
in their home and I said &quot;we don&#39;t control our children&#39;s choices&quot;.<br/>
I told her what WE did, not what SHE should do.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Mom was totally wrong to tell you that you aren&#39;t an<br/>
unschooler (whether you are or aren&#39;t!) and to attack your choices.<br/>
It&#39;s much better to surround yourself with friends that can at least<br/>
be tolerant with differences.<br/>
<br/>
I think one important aspect of unschooling/learning/life is learning<br/>
that other people have different boundaries and sensitivities than we<br/>
do and how to respect that.  Going into someone elses home, or car<br/>
means some things will be different than in our own home...unschooler<br/>
or not.<br/>
If she&#39;s modeling to her child, that THEIR values should be imposed on<br/>
other people wherever they go, that&#39;s not a great skill at getting<br/>
along in this life.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s values are so different that we can&#39;t be comfortable in<br/>
their home, we don&#39;t go there.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how wearing a seatbelt infringes on anyone&#39;s rights when<br/>
in another persons car. Cripes. It didn&#39;t sound like the child had any<br/>
issues with it either...funny how the Mom made it all about herself<br/>
really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218456378">There was a lot covered in a short time while my family had a rush of<br/>
activity both good and bad - short story - husband has been dealing with a<br/>
car accident involving a co-worker backing up into him - younger sister<br/>
coming home from Florida - other sister getting a job interview for a<br/>
promising career - my brother getting the stomach flu and a flat tire.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to truly thank everyone, she is someone I have known for a<br/>
long time and I care about deeply. I still haven&#39;t talked to her but I will<br/>
