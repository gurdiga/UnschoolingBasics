<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832421862">&quot; No matter what great families they might interview, <br/>
they&#39;ll probably find the most outrageous family to put on the<br/>
air and ridicule the whole concept of homeschooling. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Um...are you sure you&#39;re thinking of Dr. Phil? I&#39;ve never seen anyone<br/>
ridiculed (other than some snide comments about dysfunctional behavior<br/>
perhaps) on his show. While I don&#39;t agree with all his opinions, it&#39;s<br/>
NOT a free-for-all-be-rude-as-you-like on his show. It&#39;s more about<br/>
exploring and discussing.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to be on his show, whether he agreed with me or<br/>
not. It&#39;s pretty mellow and respectful for the most part.<br/>
