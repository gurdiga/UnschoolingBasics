&quot;(...)  because a toddler wants to learn what his people do, he <br/>
expects to be able  to center his attention on an adult who is <br/>
centered on her own business.  An adult who stops whatever she is <br/>
doing and tries to ascertain what her  child wants her to do is short-<br/>
circuiting this expectation. Just as  significantly, she appears to <br/>
the tot not to know how to behave, to be  lacking in confidence and, <br/>
even more alarmingly, looking for guidance from  him, a two or three <br/>
year old who is relying on her to be calm, competent,  and sure of <br/>
herself.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
What that sounded like to me is that a child wants a parent that has  <br/>
passions and interests, wants to watch the parents in action, doing what they  are <br/>
doing.  If, everytime  the child comes near, the parent stops to  find out what <br/>
the child wants or  wants from the parent, trying to find out  what the child <br/>
needs, then the child misses the opportunity to just observe the  parent in <br/>
action.  Misses that chance to see what being totally engrossed  in something  <br/>
is like.  It didn&#39;t sound to me like the author of that  quote was suggesting <br/>
to just ignore the child, but not to always assume that  because a child comes <br/>
to you, that they want something from you.  <br/>
Just what I took from that quote, <br/>

our house than either of those: the adult invites the child in to <br/>
whatever it is they are doing (offering some yarn to play with while <br/>
the parent knits, offering some clay while sculpting, asking for a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ding ding ding ding!! Give Deb a bonbon for that wonderful<br/>
observation.  I, too, picked up on &quot;something missing&quot; from Leidoff&#39;s<br/>
comments, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on it.  I, too, saw it as an<br/>
either or situation.  Either the child stands and watches the parent<br/>
be engaged or the parent stops what they are doing to engage in the<br/>
child.  I loved the Continuum Concept and it really spoke to my heart.<br/>
 I dont&#39; remember this particular paragraph, but got a feeling from<br/>
rereading this that children need to see adults engaged in their<br/>
passions, not just living to serve them yet not neglecting the<br/>
children&#39;s needs at the same time.  I&#39;ve seen extremes of parents who<br/>
&quot;follow their passions&quot; at the sake of their children.  the children<br/>
grow up seeing mom and dad&#39;s passions as more important than their<br/>
children.  The teacher who spends more time helping her students than<br/>
her children, the actor who lives on a stage and the children buy a<br/>
ticket to go see their father, the non-profit fundraiser whose<br/>
children only see them at fundraising functions, the parents who spend<br/>
every non-working hour at church.<br/>
<br/>
While my mom was a sahm while we were in school she was always<br/>
engrossed in her own world.  Whether she was going to school, involved<br/>
in church activities, or creating art, we watched my mother from the<br/>
sidelines.  Rarely were we invited into the &quot;inner sanctum&quot; to<br/>
participate.  I remember only a handful of times that my mom would let<br/>
us into her studio to do something and then she would get upset<br/>
because we weren&#39;t as neat as she was.  I have two pieces of clay that<br/>
I made when I was a teen and those are the only two things that I ever<br/>
was allowed to make, yet my mother had her own business where she was<br/>
making various things all the time.  She made the stained glass window<br/>
at the church we grew up in, yet we were hardly even allowed to watch<br/>
much less help.  She quilted, knit, sewed, wove, spun, and did all<br/>
kinds of other textiles which I learned not through doing but through<br/>
watching.  I did eventually learn how to knit, but it was after much<br/>
begging and whining.  Maybe that is why I jump at the chance to teach<br/>
children to knit and am proud that all my kids know how to at least do<br/>
a knit stitch.  I can&#39;t think of a craft or art that I have pursued<br/>
where I haven&#39;t involved the kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was a fun thing for DS - last summer DH was sitting for a <br/>
sculptress friend of ours (his baby fine hair down to his shoulders <br/>
with his bushy facial hair, beard down the middle of his chest, made <br/>
a great textural piece) and DS went with him to her studio (she knew <br/>
in advance that that was part of the deal and she&#39;s really cool with <br/>
kids). Her one concern was all the sketches she had hanging up of <br/>
nudes. I told her not to worry - if DS had questions, he&#39;d ask, but <br/>
that he already knew what DH and I look like unclothed, so no <br/>
big &quot;surprises&quot; there. When they got there, he did ask a <br/>
question &quot;How come there are so many naked butts?&quot; She just <br/>
explained that she used those sketches to know how to make her <br/>
sculptures and all...and he said Oh okay and went back to playing <br/>
his Gameboy. When he showed an interest in the clay and how she was <br/>
using it, she handed him a couple of bits that she had removed in <br/>
the process and let him go to town with it. Nothing he wanted to <br/>
keep but he had fun experiencing it.<br/>
