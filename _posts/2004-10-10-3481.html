<div id="ygrps-yiv-656438792">Hey Claudia you sound like me. I also use the Attached Parent philosophy for<br/>
my son and do for my 12 year old too. My 15 year old wasn&#39;t so lucky because<br/>
I was young and dumb and knew nothing about AP. Well I wasn&#39;t totally<br/>
clueless...she did co-sleep, and was breastfed, but everything else was not<br/>
AP.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842076319">Hello there. I&#39;m new  to the list and I&#39;m having a wee bit of trouble deciphering the abv. you guys use. Would someone be so kind as to list a few of them for me. <br/>
 <br/>
Also do any of you have older children who aren&#39;t reading or doing math up to what ever standard? My daughter is 10 and isn&#39;t doing either and her peers are. (Peers that are in public school mind you). It doesn&#39;t bother me for the most part but it would be nice to know I&#39;m not alone because sometimes I certainly feel it.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you<br/>
Cheyenne<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m fairly new to this list as well, but haven&#39;t found any acronyms that aren&#39;t familiar.  Are you talking about things like LOL (laughing out loud), DH (dear, darling, d@mn husband), SO (significant other), BTW (by the way), or are there other acronyms I&#39;m missing?  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Also do any of you have older children who aren&#39;t reading or doing math up to what ever standard? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Math math math.  It seems to be the one thing that most of us stress over the most.  How do you figure that she isn&#39;t where they are?  Is it because she can&#39;t rattle off the multiplication table or is she just not putting 1 and 1 together and getting 2, literally?  There are some great puzzle books and magazines out that have wonderful ways of playing with numbers while not really doing math.  My kids are a whiz with fractions because we use them in cooking all the time.  We have a favorite recipe for cookies that we make each Yule (and now for hurricanes LOL!) that has 2/3, 1/4, 1/8, 1/2, 3/4, and 1/3 of various wholes used in it.  When we make these cookies we are always doubling and tripling the recipe (we would quadruple but I don&#39;t have a bowl that big LOL!)  I&#39;m sure if I were to sit them down with a sheet of math problems they would look at me like I was titched in the head, yet they can figure out how much pepper we need for the cookies if we are making a triple batch of cookies and it calls for 1/8 t.  even when the measuring spoon doesn&#39;t have a 3/8 t. slot (I have sliding measuring spoons).  It&#39;s &quot;fun math&quot; without having to think of it like math.  <br/>
<br/>
I was at B&N today and was looking at some math puzzle books.  I didn&#39;t get them only for the reason that they have the appearance of math rather than just puzzles.  We subscribe to Puzzle magazine and work on it through the month.  There are lots of fun puzzles in there that make you use that &quot;mathematical&quot; side of your brain without feeling like you are doing math.  Music is another way to stimulate the mathematical parts of your brain.  Just listening to it can help.  Creating it is even better.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids just need a bit longer to figure out things than others.  And just because the neighbor kids have been drilled with useless math facts doesn&#39;t mean that they really understand what they are being &quot;taught.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193470279">Hi Claudia,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support. We have follow AP thinking since Hannah was born and<br/>
I have worked hard on following a gentle discipline approach as well. I have<br/>
not always been successful but I keep trying. I was raised in a punitive<br/>
home and so some of that old learning slips in, but I keep working on it. I<br/>
have never done a time out with her and have only spanked her twice which I<br/>
so ashamed of and apologized to her for afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks again,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve known and now know kids not reading at 10 or 11 or 12 years old. <br/>
It is within the range of &quot;normal&quot; for kids allowed to do what is <br/>
natural for them. The only advice I&#39;d give would be to be sure to read <br/>
TO them a lot and provide books on cd/tape. No reason for them not to <br/>
be &quot;well read&quot; just because they aren&#39;t reading for themselves, yet.<br/>
