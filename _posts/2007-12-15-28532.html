<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162483437">Maybe I am way out of line by posting this here but I am not sure <br/>
who to talk to about a problem I am experiencing.  I so much value <br/>
the advice and opinions of the moms on this list, so I thought I <br/>

<br/>
This past year I have pretty much lost all interest in having a <br/>
sexual relationship with my hubby, whom I love dearly.  We have been <br/>
married for 14 years and have 2 kids that I am unschooling (well, we <br/>
are still doing some math first thing in the morning, but that&#39;s <br/>
it.)  <br/>
<br/>
I have been, shall we say, &quot;giving in&quot; to him to keep him happy <br/>
although he would like to have more frequent encounters.  After <br/>
about 2 weeks, he announces how much time has gone by, and then I <br/>
give in after 3 weeks, when he declares that it&#39;s now been 3 weeks!  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that really got me thinking about unschooling, is how I <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy feeling forced into doing this (and that&#39;s how I feel) <br/>
but if I don&#39;t comply, I probably won&#39;t stay married.  <br/>
<br/>
Do other wives feel this way?  I feel I&#39;ve had enough sex to last me <br/>
a lifetime and just don&#39;t want to do it anymore.  I am 43 and once <br/>
we get going, I enjoy the encounter and we definitely &quot;are great&quot; <br/>
together.  I think, &quot;why don&#39;t I want to do this?  It felt <br/>
wonderful.&quot;  But then afterwards, I just am not in the mood.  I <br/>
think most of it may be that I am very tired in the evening.  We get <br/>
together only on the weekends because my husband gets up VERY early <br/>
and I go to bed later.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613001407">In a nutshell -- yes, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
More elaboration now.  I have periods of time when my libido is very<br/>
low.  (And when we first got married and I was on the pill, it was<br/>
more or less non-existent.  I finally went off the pill, because I<br/>
figured, why was I on hormones all month long for something that was<br/>
only happening occasionally, and then only out of guilt.)<br/>
<br/>
Later, I had infertility issues.  HAVING to have sex (a necessary<br/>
ingredient to baby-making) at a specific time/interval is far less<br/>
romantic.  He once complained about it -- and I said to him, &quot;After<br/>
all I&#39;ve been through this week, the least you can do is your part<br/>
without complaining!&quot;  (Yeah, seriously funny when you think about it!)<br/>
<br/>
Now I know that my cycle and libido are connected -- that my libido is<br/>
higher, my lubrication more there, when I am around ovulation.  <br/>
<br/>
However, when I&#39;m tired, I really really don&#39;t feel like it, even<br/>
then.  I often put on a happy face, as it were, because if dh is<br/>
happier, so am I -- but it occasionally is like laundry.  A chore, but<br/>
not odious.<br/>
<br/>
If my allergies are bad, I&#39;m less interested.  Much less.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m sick, forget it.<br/>
<br/>
There are many factors involved, but remember -- the libido is a<br/>
physical thing, and those factors can effect that as well.<br/>
<br/>

I feel it is a bit of paranoia, and other times I worry I have some sort <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76320027">Linda and Sarah--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always a good one to bring up taboo subjects.  I figured this <br/>
sort of ties in with unschooling, because unschooling is about <br/>
choice and sometimes I feel like I don&#39;t have choice and must do an <br/>
obligatory duty.  I don&#39;t like to feel that way about it, but here <br/>
lately I have.  <br/>
<br/>
I will definitely take into account ovulation.  I had not remembered <br/>
that ovulation was a time that may be best for libido (not sure if I <br/>
have any of that though).  My mom says what I&#39;m experiencing is not <br/>
normal and I should have my hormones checked, which I might do.  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah, my husband also went through a spell where he did not have <br/>
interest in sex.  It was while I was pregnant and it was so hard for <br/>
me.  I remember feeling rejection and I know that is how he is <br/>
feeling right now.  However, I tried not to make him feel <br/>
compelled.  It has gone full circle with us it seems.  I remember <br/>
that what we did to help him when he had no interest was we watched <br/>
some &quot;steamy&quot; films together and that really helped and then he was <br/>
better as I recall.<br/>
<br/>
I have done more thinking today and one idea is that we should try <br/>
to get together at another time rather than late at night on the <br/>
weekends.  Also, exercise may give me more energy and help me feel <br/>
better about myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it fair to tell him though that just because it&#39;s been 3 weeks,  <br/>
I don&#39;t have to do something I don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228338098">I think this is a common problem among busy women!  We have so much going on<br/>
it is hard to just relax and give in to pleasure for its own sake.  But...<br/>
its not really just for its own sake.  I am only actually *interested* in<br/>
sex 2 or so days per month (it&#39;s been found that humans do go into heat;<br/>
they could have just asked us women, eh?)  However, when I&#39;m not in the mood<br/>
and hubby is, I have basically three choices.  I can say, &quot;Not tonight, I<br/>
have a headache.&quot;  I can &#39;give in&#39; and let him get his rocks off (yuck!) Or<br/>
I can intentionally and consciously refocus on my husband and our<br/>
relationship and intimacy and how important our marriage is to the kids, and<br/>
remind myself of the pleasure to come, and completely enjoy the experience.<br/>
 My recommendation? Stop making the poor guy wait and beg!  Think sexy<br/>
thoughts.  Look at sexy pictures.  Read a romance novel.  Whatever it takes<br/>
to keep you in the mood.  Imagine being a man who wants to reconnect with<br/>
his wife and he knows deep inside she&#39;s just doing it to placate him.  Don&#39;t<br/>
expect to be &#39;in the mood&#39;.  Create the mood yourself, intentionally.  Kind<br/>
of like creating a mind-shift around housework (I haven&#39;t pulled that one<br/>
off yet), only I&#39;d say sex is a lot more rewarding lol.  Anyway that&#39;s my<br/>
thoughts on the matter.<br/>

&gt;   Maybe I am way out of line by posting this here but I am not sure<br/>
&gt; who to talk to about a problem I am experiencing. I so much value<br/>
&gt; the advice and opinions of the moms on this list, so I thought I<br/>
&gt; would just throw it out there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This past year I have pretty much lost all interest in having a<br/>
&gt; sexual relationship with my hubby, whom I love dearly. We have been<br/>
&gt; married for 14 years and have 2 kids that I am unschooling (well, we<br/>
&gt; are still doing some math first thing in the morning, but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; it.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been, shall we say, &quot;giving in&quot; to him to keep him happy<br/>
&gt; although he would like to have more frequent encounters. After<br/>
&gt; about 2 weeks, he announces how much time has gone by, and then I<br/>
&gt; give in after 3 weeks, when he declares that it&#39;s now been 3 weeks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing that really got me thinking about unschooling, is how I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t enjoy feeling forced into doing this (and that&#39;s how I feel)<br/>
&gt; but if I don&#39;t comply, I probably won&#39;t stay married.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do other wives feel this way? I feel I&#39;ve had enough sex to last me<br/>
&gt; a lifetime and just don&#39;t want to do it anymore. I am 43 and once<br/>
&gt; we get going, I enjoy the encounter and we definitely &quot;are great&quot;<br/>
&gt; together. I think, &quot;why don&#39;t I want to do this? It felt<br/>
&gt; wonderful.&quot; But then afterwards, I just am not in the mood. I<br/>
&gt; think most of it may be that I am very tired in the evening. We get<br/>
&gt; together only on the weekends because my husband gets up VERY early<br/>
&gt; and I go to bed later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be very appreciated. If this discussion is<br/>
&gt; inappropriate for here, then I certainly understand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Martha<br/>

correlation between hormones near ovulation and cervical mucus -- and<br/>
I never noticed it until I was on pergonal, because, well, I probably<br/>
never had it!  It makes sense, though, from a biological point of<br/>

think about it.  But we so rarely think about it!  However,<br/>
perimenopause on, sometimes messes up those hormones, so that could<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18175670">I&#39;ve been following the whole sex discussion with great interest, because I am one of those exhausted moms for whom there is never a good time for sex, I am just not interested 99% of the time.  I love what Karen has said and I say a hearty amen!  I have learned lately that when I say no to him when he asks for sex that after awhile I&#39;m not just saying no to him, I&#39;m rejecting him loving me and him feeling love from me.  He is very willing to sleep in Saturday mornings so I can sleep until I want to, or to give me neck massage when I have a tension headache, or to just try and make things better for me, so why am I so quick to say no when he asks for a little.  Mostly because I&#39;ve been giving giving giving all day, and with 3 year old twin girls I&#39;m really touched OUT by the time evening comes!!!  Anyway, just wanted to say an amen to Karen&#39;s email and this is a work in progress for me about being open and loving with my husband even when I sometimes (often!) don&#39;t feel<br/>
 like it.  Thanks so much for all the honesty and sharing I&#39;ve been able to read and learn from here.  I would love another name for unschooling, because the whole unschooling philosophy is sure bigger than just not doing school isn&#39;t it?!? I think I like life learning better :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668637259">I agree with Justine&#39;s comments about making a choice -- not with a <br/>
sense of giving in just to keep him happy, since that&#39;s a choice likely <br/>
to create resentment in you.<br/>
<br/>
I think he is looking for connection with you -- he&#39;s speaking in a <br/>
love language that for him says he&#39;s loved, and that he uses to tell <br/>
you he loves you.  Sex is an essential part of a happy marriage for <br/>
most couples -- it&#39;s a connection, a release, appreciation and trust <br/>
for many people. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re wanting to &#39;unschool&#39; your marriage -- in that <br/>
you&#39;d like the same freedom to say no that you give your kids in <br/>
unschooling.  And wouldn&#39;t you like to give him the same freedom and <br/>
desire to meet his needs you extend to your kids -- to be able to give <br/>
that freedom and respect and support to each other? <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a yahoo group for unschooling parents/couples who want to <br/>
unschool their marriage, to better live the unschooling principles in <br/>
their partnership they&#39;ve seen work so well with the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships/</a><br/>
<br/>
The listowner is an unschooling Mom from my local tribe in Albuquerque, <br/>
and the group has been hugely helpful to me as we find our way thru a <br/>
change in our routine that has dh away more than he&#39;s home. I think <br/>
that when you apply to join, you need to wait for approval, and I know <br/>
Beth has houseguests this weekend, so she may be slow responding to <br/>
requests to join. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160609839">Coming from the guy...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it fair to tell him though that just because it&#39;s been 3 weeks,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have to do something I don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish I had an answer for you.  My gut says that this is a surface<br/>
question, but there are more important issues that need to be addressed<br/>
first.  Unschooling has taught me that, in many, many cases, the direct<br/>
answer to a problem is very often the wrong answer.  And the &quot;Most Obvious&quot;<br/>
way to look at a problem is the one that prevents us from seeing a<br/>
solution.  They look like they model reality correctly, but too often they<br/>
don&#39;t take into account other important factors.  And sometimes we&#39;re too<br/>
blind to see those issues.  For example...<br/>
<br/>
... Could this just be the accumulation of so much sleep deprivation that OF<br/>
COURSE you don&#39;t want to.  About a month of sleeping would get you<br/>
interested again ...<br/>
<br/>
... maybe he doesn&#39;t shower but once a week, and ya know, you just don&#39;t see<br/>
the romance of week-old B.O. ...<br/>
<br/>
... more exercise for you?  To get energy, expend energy ...<br/>
<br/>
... more exercise for him?  When his paunch overlaps his knees, something<br/>
has to give ...<br/>
<br/>
... I think someone mentioned hormones ...  (sleep can help this also)<br/>
<br/>
... A lot has been said about what DW needs to look at, and what might be<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; with her.  Perhaps there&#39;s also (or only) something &quot;wrong&quot; with DH<br/>
as well.  I agree that each of us are ONLY in charge of ourselves.  Pointing<br/>
the finger elsewhere (blaming) does no good.  But since I AM married,<br/>
there&#39;s another Me here, and that is the Married Me, or the Royal We.  It&#39;s<br/>
also up to me to respectfully address this with the other half of We.<br/>
<br/>
...Or... have you considered the possibility that what lights your fire<br/>
could be so drastically different than what it was before you had kids that<br/>
you might not even know what it is?  People change constantly, and<br/>
sometimes, dramatically.  Since having kids, your needs have changed.  You<br/>
give of yourself in different and in more intense ways.  You give more of<br/>
yourself than ever before.  So why wouldn&#39;t your personal, intimate needs<br/>
change?  Maybe even drasitcally?<br/>
<br/>
And what if you know what that is, but he doesn&#39;t?  How do you tell your DH<br/>
to try something different?  To repeat an earlier post,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In general, men get affirmation of the love their wives feel for them<br/>
&gt; through sex. It&#39;s NOT just a physical release. It is often one of the only<br/>
&gt; times that they are vulnerable and open.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sometimes shocks me how insecure I am when being intimate with DW.  If<br/>
she says, &quot;Hey, are you willing to try something?&quot; I hear, &quot;You know, you<br/>
just couldn&#39;t do it for me.  Something&#39;s wrong with you.&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make<br/>
sense unless you understand the insecurity there.<br/>
<br/>
So, how to broach new things with DH and (hopefully) still keep everyone<br/>
having fun?<br/>
<br/>
a.  Unschool your DH.  Respectful interaction.  We&#39;ve learned (somewhat,<br/>
anyway) how to talk to our own kids respectfully.  Gotta apply it to us,<br/>
too.  Our egos are only 5 years old, sometimes, too.<br/>
b.  A long lead-in time for me to get used to the idea.  This helps me get<br/>
over my insecurity, sometimes by half-believing it was my own idea by the<br/>
time we get to it.<br/>
c.  if you get as far as actually trying something different, then while DH<br/>
is &#39;assisting&#39;, then very positive encouragement.  Almost ridiculously<br/>
positive encouragement.  Think especially of unschooling your DH here.<br/>
Except here you can use your Adult Bedroom Voice of Encouragement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661657198">I am thinking about Rob¹s post for this first paragraph. One thing that<br/>
might work is to learn about something sex related together ­ then try it.<br/>
For example, maybe oral sex is not in your regular repertoire. Then get and<br/>
read together (in whatever way works for you two) books like She Comes<br/>
First: the Thinking Man¹s Guide to Pleasuring a Woman. If you approach it<br/>
with the attitude ³play with me ­ and I¹d like to learn more about this²<br/>
then it might not be so threatening to DH. There is similar book written for<br/>
women about pleasuring their man ­ so you could both benefit in multiple<br/>
ways. <br/>
<br/>
Also, consider your age when thinking about your attitude towards sex. For<br/>
many women, lubrication wanes as they age and for other reasons. Sometimes<br/>
you just need a great lubricant to help get you in the mood. Or maybe it<br/>
would help if he did the dishes (or fill in other task which he rarely does)<br/>
and made you feel like you had more time available. You of course could<br/>
reciprocate the job trade and then go make out on the couch:-)<br/>

You know, that just reminded me of a book I used to have a long time<br/>
ago. Didn&#39;t care for the title but it had some good stuff in<br/>
it...something like &quot;How can we light the fire when the kids are<br/>
driving us crazy?&quot;<br/>
The title sounds terribly disrespectful towards children, but as far<br/>
as I remember, the book was pretty useful in some areas. Might be<br/>
worth looking into anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851979114">Dear Martha,<br/>
<br/>
I did the same thing you&#39;re doing for years. I felt like if I never had sex again in my life I wouldn&#39;t miss it. It didn&#39;t feel good to me or my husband to be in this place where he was always begging and I was always refusing him or giving in out of guilt. A few months ago, I went to see an accupuncturist for fatigue and libido, and it really has helped.  I have a lot more energy and I enjoy sex.  The accupuncturist I saw was a five element accupuncturist.<br/>

Best of luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442280551">Perhaps you could try just connecting with dh more in<br/>
general.  Like spend more time together doing things<br/>
you both enjoy.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean alone,<br/>
you can do it anytime.  Ie. If the kids are playing on<br/>
the floor and dh is playing with them, join them and<br/>
sit close to dh.  Play too and enjoy yourself and your<br/>
family.  And do take advantage of snuggling or hugging<br/>
if you enjoy that and wish to just let him know you<br/>
love him.  Like if you are all watching tv or reading<br/>
a book together, do sit next to dh and relax together.<br/>
 All these little interactions might add up and make<br/>
you feel more positive towards your dh and in general.<br/>
 And...well...maybe just plan on cuddling in bed naked<br/>
(after kiddos are sleeping) and just see if that leads<br/>
anywhere or not.  Sometimes it might just be nice to<br/>
snuggle that way, and other times it might turn you on<br/>
and lead to more.  Laurie<br/>

quiet that you need ...if you take care of you it makes you a better<br/>
mother and wife (when the tank is empty you have nothing to give!)  <br/>
In those days my kids went to bed fairly early (9 or 10) So after they<br/>
were down for the night I hit the tub!   <br/>
<br/>
The second thing is that if you touch your husband and accept his<br/>
touch throughout the day it builds a deeper intimacy that in my<br/>
opinion makes you feel less &quot;surprised&quot; when he wants to have sex. <br/>
Think of it as continuous foreplay!   My husband is a toucher so my<br/>
first reaction when we were first together was &quot;uh oh he&#39;s touching me<br/>
that means he wants something more&quot;  which was my experience in<br/>
previous relationships.   For him it&#39;s an extension of his love and<br/>
his need for touch...to touch and be touched.   During those times I<br/>
felt less receptive I would realize that we were so busy we weren&#39;t<br/>
touching each other like we usually did.   <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I think helps is that we value our time alone<br/>
together.... when our kids were little we would go away for a weekend<br/>
alone a couple of times a year and leave the children with their<br/>
grandparents.   We find time to go and have lunch together, we shop<br/>
together and other little things like that that just give us small<br/>
bits of time together to reconnect.   I think when you do that you<br/>
feel less torn at home when you want to be with your spouse and your<br/>
children and everyone&#39;s needs seem to weigh heavily on you.    <br/>
<br/>
Also be honest with your husband.... let him know that how you feel so<br/>
you aren&#39;t&#39; just playing this avoidance game that leaves him wondering<br/>
what&#39;s wrong with him!    Men are very visual so understand that him<br/>
wanting to be intimate is a bit compliment because the mere sight of<br/>
you does it for him!  It&#39;s also the reason that it&#39;s hard for men to<br/>
just &quot;cuddle&quot; or to rub your back and not want more.    If you are<br/>
honest and tell them you need to feel loved and cherished by touching<br/>
only and the expectation is clear then you are both getting your needs<br/>
met.  I have found lots of times when he is able to give me what I<br/>
need and understand the limits of it then the deeper intimacy comes<br/>
along on it&#39;s own (not always that night but it starts the process).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway those are things that have helped my relationship with my<br/>
husband... hopefully something I have shared will help yours!   It&#39;s<br/>
so hard to feel like you are letting someone down or that there&#39;s<br/>
something wrong with you (I mean everyone else just loves sex and has<br/>
it 14 times a week don&#39;t they?? HA!)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973029596">Just wanted to add two more cents to this topic: I recently started back doing yoga just about every morning (I go really early before my husband goes to work) and not only am I feeling tons better (doing something for myself FIRST every day has been amazing), but I now ocassionaly actually want sex (that I want it at all is also amazing :o)).  I know for me dealing with kids is so unpredictable and so intense that I barely notice if I&#39;m breathing most moments, and the yoga forces me practice slowing down, focusing on my breath, be in my body, which are also things that really help me enjoy sex and have the energy for it.  It&#39;s also something regular for ME that I don&#39;t just &#39;fit in when I can&#39;, but it&#39;s 4x a week like clockwork now.  I paid for the whole year in advance so I&#39;d keep going when it got tough :o).<br/>
  All the best,<br/>

<br/>
I did the same thing you&#39;re doing for years. I felt like if I never had sex again in my life I wouldn&#39;t miss it. It didn&#39;t feel good to me or my husband to be in this place where he was always begging and I was always refusing him or giving in out of guilt. A few months ago, I went to see an accupuncturist for fatigue and libido, and it really has helped. I have a lot more energy and I enjoy sex. The accupuncturist I saw was a five element accupuncturist.<br/>

Best of luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669323781">After I responded to this I still thought about it<br/>
more.  I wondered if you wanted to reconnect with him<br/>
more and really feel like you *want* to have sex or if<br/>
you want to know it is truly okay to not have it if<br/>
you don&#39;t feel like it.  I had originally thought you<br/>
were looking for ways to want to again, but now I want<br/>
to add this: <br/>
1. My husband and I respect each other&#39;s feelings and<br/>
just tell each other if we are not interested.  And<br/>
that I do believe that a person should not just do it<br/>
to please another.  Of course, each person must decide<br/>
whether the are willing to just do it or not.  2. I<br/>
agree with other posters that you can just feel so<br/>
touched out and stretched in so many ways, esp when<br/>
you have wee ones and are nursing around the clock.  I<br/>
don&#39;t feel like it for so long after the birth of my<br/>
kids!! <br/>
3. And lastly, if there are other issues going on<br/>
between the two of you, you may not feel like it<br/>
because you may feel upset with either him or yourself<br/>
or both.  Resolving conflicts or just the process<br/>
itself of beginning to address conflicts might help<br/>
you to feel closer (if that is what you are seeking). <br/>
Look within yourself to realize what  you want and<br/>
what you need to do to to get there.  Laurie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142449054">I&#39;ve got to jump in here and pass on a GREAT website and book, both by Dr.<br/>
Laura Brotherson, and &quot;Intimacy Educator&quot; and &quot;Relationship Consultant.&quot;<br/>
The website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.strengtheningmarriage.com/,">http://www.strengtheningmarriage.com/,</a> and she&#39;s got a bunch<br/>
of articles on there, a Q&A section, and a bunch of other great information.<br/>
I read her book &quot;And They Were Not Ashamed&quot; and it was a HUGE help for me<br/>
when I read it a few months ago.  One great thing is that it is from the<br/>
female perspective, so for husbands it&#39;s got a lot of great information.<br/>
She talks about the &quot;Good Girl Syndrome,&quot; the female sexual response, lots<br/>
of scriptural references about intimacy in marriage, and even how to talk to<br/>
your kids about sex.  She is very blunt and to the point.  I&#39;ve listened to<br/>
some podcasts with her answering questions as well, and I&#39;ll tell you, she<br/>
loves to talk about sex.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Before reading the book I wouldn&#39;t say I was entirely uninterested, but it<br/>
was very seldom that I was looking for it.  I definitely look more forward<br/>
to it, and things just keep getting better.  I honestly feel like sex has<br/>

Maybe it will help if you can identify a particular actor that you regard as<br/>

them from the library. Get lots!<br/>

Get a x-rated movie not Basic Instinct. They now hae some nice ones made for the women viwers. they have stories and are &quot;nicer&quot;.<br/>
Also i agreee with getting exercise. Any kind. Yoga, biking, pilates, body pump. Streching. Whatever moves you. It makes a HUGE difference for me. take care of yourself.<br/>
Go get your hair done, buy new sexier clothes, get a massage.<br/>
You need to feel sexy and beautiful to feel sexy.<br/>
Eating healthy somehow helps me too.<br/>
Making sure I am not having any issues with dh. Work them out before your date.<br/>
think about all the wonderful things about your dh that made you love him.<br/>
Remeber all the great sex you had with him.<br/>
Drink a glass of good wine. ( don&#39;t dring more than two or it backfires as you become less sensitive physicaly)<br/>
<br/>
All these have helped me a lot when my libido is down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643984945">After much reading on this subject Ive decided to add my bit. My hubby loves<br/>
luxurious sex [this means that he does not like it to end] and this can be a<br/>
serious issue after 10hrs of my body being pushed and pulled around buy a 3<br/>
and 5 yr old.<br/>
By the end of many days I honestly feel that my body need some re coop<br/>
&#39;down&#39; time. [to be left alone]<br/>
<br/>
My solution is simple I set some &#39;rules&#39;<br/>
1] heh... don&#39;t ask after 10h30 at night!<br/>
2] When I am tired respect this, that in its self is sexy [for the next day]<br/>
3] Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like hours of intimacy, so quickies are great AND<br/>
defined as such! [no changing your mind 10min into it!!!!]<br/>
4] Oh if you want to entice me DONT be direct [verbally or physically] -<br/>
make me want it!!!<br/>
5] When I am tense a massage relaxes me and, well, a relaxed me is a sexy<br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
I have introduced these over the last several years [one at a time -of<br/>
course] And he has responded favourably to it although initially he felt a<br/>
little offended and thought I did not enjoy sex any more. Well now he has a<br/>
great marital bed and he thinks he is the stud!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gives you some additional ideas. Our sex life has definitely<br/>
improved as we both feel honoured and validated.<br/>
<br/>
good Luck<br/>
Carle<br/>
