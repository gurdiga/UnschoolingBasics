<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296758278">[I posted this on AlwaysLearning last night and then<br/>
realized I really should have posted it here.}<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest child is almost seven and is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My husband goes through various degrees of fear ...<br/>
there are certain things about unschooling that have<br/>
always appealed to him, but right now he&#39;s going<br/>
through one of his &quot;doubt periods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today I printed and read a few articles from Sandra&#39;s<br/>
reading page to him. He liked them, but had some<br/>
questions. I told him I would write down some of his<br/>
comments and present them to you guys, and he seemed<br/>
to like that idea.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of his comments:<br/>
<br/>
*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sometimes you need somebody to kinda help push you<br/>
through a sticky spot [in learning and/or achieving<br/>
something], and then you appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
&quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>
seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>
but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>
somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>
look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>
on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>
sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>
teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
get on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>
for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>
It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>
would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>
all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and this one I forgot about when I posted<br/>
originally: &quot;I&#39;m afraid [our six year old daughter]<br/>
isn&#39;t being challenged enough ... and the longer that<br/>
goes on, the hesitant she&#39;ll be to challenge herself,<br/>
and the more resistant she&#39;ll be to challenges. I&#39;m<br/>
afraid that after a while she&#39;ll even start to feel<br/>
like she&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267225921">I&#39;d like to try a couple of these! Kind of like testing my own<br/>
learning process.  LOL   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the first thing that came to mind was would I rather be PUSHED<br/>
through a cave or be guided through!  <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a huge difference between pushed and guided.  In my<br/>
experience this isn&#39;t even unschooling specific.  It is also easy to<br/>
come to the conclusion that a child who isn&#39;t pushed doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
elarn/achieve ANTYHING.  Especially given the resistance that public<br/>
school children have toward learning new things.  they are being<br/>
pushed every day.  Children who have never been to school or who are<br/>
completely deschooled won&#39;t have that resistance.  Unless of course,<br/>
it TRULY isn&#39;t something they want/need to learn right now.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the Karate kid movies!  They are my son&#39;s favorites!  You may<br/>
also notice that in the Karate Kid Mr. Miagi (sp) never once required<br/>
anything of Daniel.  He offered his help and was open to Daniel when<br/>
he was ready.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt; &quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe this is another misconception of unschooling.  Unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
hands-off parenting.  It seems like I went through a short period of<br/>
time like that.  Where i was kind of hands off, and sat back thinking<br/>
to myself, &quot;what&#39;s wrong here&quot;.  LOL  Maybe if you think of the parent<br/>
as more of a facilitator.  Or a even a guide.  Or even &quot;partner in<br/>
crime&quot; is one of my favorites.  We do all sorts of things together<br/>
now, sometimes they are the kids ideas, sometimes they are mine.  It&#39;s<br/>
been awhile since we&#39;ve really hunkered down and stuck to one<br/>
thing/topic, but I will tell you that our lives are richer than they<br/>
ever have been. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of benefit to a child if they<br/>
don&#39;t want to do this type of learning.  Children (and this goes for<br/>
humans and animals) are the most curious beings.  They learn with all<br/>
their senses.  It is only in recent times that we have decided that<br/>
children need to learn only with books and teachers and one or two<br/>
field trips a year.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he would agree that when the experience is joyful the learning<br/>
is maximized.  When the learning is boring and forced, so much is<br/>
lost.  Like...  Joy!<br/>
<br/>
There may also be a time when someone chooses that type of focussed<br/>
and structured learning.  But really, it isn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
considered the only and right way.<br/>

saying this can&#39;t happen, or doesn&#39;t come up from tie to time.  But in<br/>
my experience it usually comes from constantly being compared to other<br/>
kids your age.</div>

&gt; something], and then you appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ****************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People who&#39;ve experienced a positive outcome from being pushed in  <br/>
some activity they enjoy are certain this is true.<br/>
<br/>
People who&#39;ve experienced a negative outcome usually don&#39;t make  <br/>
generalization about pushing being universally good or bad. They just  <br/>
decide they don&#39;t like the pusher, don&#39;t like what they were being  <br/>
pushed to do, and don&#39;t like being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
So the larger truth in the above statement is that people remember  <br/>
the positive results and forget the negative results. A not very  <br/>
scientific process!<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, it&#39;s better not to learn to depend on an outside  <br/>
source to push you past rough spots. It&#39;s far more useful for a  <br/>
lifetime to learn how to push yourself. Kids get that by having  <br/>
opportunities to discover that by pushing past rough spots, there are  <br/>
-- usually! -- rewards and a sense of accomplishment beyond the rough  <br/>
patches. And a really useful skill is being able to assess along the  <br/>
way and determine when an activity is draining more than it&#39;s  <br/>
returning (or likely to return.) Sometimes we&#39;ll guess wrong. But  <br/>
that&#39;s okay. We learn from our mistakes. And when we have the freedom  <br/>
to drop things and pick them up again, we know we can go back and  <br/>
pick something up when we feel we&#39;re ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, people can *choose* to find someone who will push them,  <br/>
knowing full well that they&#39;re choosing to be pushed and can choose  <br/>
to drop the pushing any time. (Athletic coaches come to mind.) While  <br/>
choosing to have someone push you may look the same from the outside  <br/>
as someone pushing someone else, it has a totally different feel  <br/>
inside the person. And since all learning happens inside, what&#39;s  <br/>
happening inside the person is more important than what it looks like  <br/>
from outside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
&gt; things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
&gt; like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
&gt; a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
&gt; wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is true. But what we don&#39;t know is what *else* they would have  <br/>
done if they had the freedom. We *can&#39;t* know. And because we can&#39;t  <br/>
know, it&#39;s scary. If we&#39;re in a place we like, it&#39;s scary to think we  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have gotten there except by being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to take fears out and examine them! Often they encourage us  <br/>
to do things to avoid worst case scenarios to make us feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a way around that fear other than face it. To also see  <br/>
the benefits of unschooling until that becomes way more important  <br/>
than the unfounded fears.<br/>
<br/>
And unschoolers *do* introduce their kids to a variety of activities.  <br/>
When the kids show an interest in something, we help them find ways  <br/>
to explore it. If they want, that can be a mentor who knows an  <br/>
instrument well or knows programming if that&#39;s where they&#39;re headed.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids *do* let us know what interests them even when it&#39;s  <br/>
outside of the things we&#39;re showing them. They may not jump directly  <br/>
to programming but they will be asking questions  about how people  <br/>
get things to do things. And it grows from there as we find ways to  <br/>
answer their questions, and find others to answer their questions  <br/>
when the need more than we can provide.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the sticking points to getting unschooling. When we  <br/>
only know the success of being led through something, when we see all  <br/>
that we needed to know in order to get where we ended up, it seems  <br/>
impossible for that to have happened any other way.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest cure to that is seeing kids who have learned loads about  <br/>
something just by playing, wanting to learn it, and doing it. Kids  <br/>
learn HTML, Java and Javascript all by wanting to do stuff with it  <br/>
without a programmed process leading them from one thing to another.  <br/>
They just plunge in and learn what they need in the moment. (It&#39;s  <br/>
exactly how I learned HTML.) While the process is chaotic and pretty  <br/>
much untestable since kids are zigzagging from one bit to another,  <br/>
reaching for what they need to know in the moment without any  <br/>
apparent plan to get &quot;everything&quot;, the process is exactly the way  <br/>
they learn to speak English. And that works *way* better than sitting  <br/>
in a classroom to supposedly learn Spanish!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a lot like the process my daughter is going through  <br/>
learning guitar. She told her instructor what kind of music she liked  <br/>
and they both work together on suggesting what she could learn.  <br/>
Sometimes she picks the songs. Sometimes he does. She likes the blues  <br/>
but he had a lot more knowledge and helped her a lot on what he  <br/>
suggested she learned. Sometimes she sees someone doing something and  <br/>
tells him she&#39;d like to learn it. Sometimes she figures it out on her  <br/>
own. While he suggests and helps because he has a bigger picture of  <br/>
music, she&#39;s in the driver&#39;s seat and can decide which way to  <br/>
ultimately go.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds scary when we&#39;re used to programmed learning! What if she  <br/>
misses something? Ah, the truth is that programmed learners miss  <br/>
loads. They just don&#39;t know it! The programmed course leads them to  <br/>
believe it&#39;s everything they need. People buy into that. But when you  <br/>
walk into work that first day, you realize how much you don&#39;t know!  <br/>
And a much more useful skill is knowing that you don&#39;t know  <br/>
everything but having the confidence you can learn it when you need  <br/>
it -- rather than assuming you need someone to teach it to you :-)<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s not a perfect analogy since you need to know something to get  <br/>
the job! But with unschooling, kids are learning all along, getting  <br/>
what they need to know. It&#39;s just a different process. They get to  <br/>
the job *better* prepared because they&#39;ve had the freedom to do real  <br/>
life versions of the job rather than cramming in esoteric information  <br/>
that might suit the type of job they might want one day.)<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of learning by doing is that we naturally encounter what  <br/>
we need to know. We come across problems and learn -- as a side  <br/>
effect -- what we need to get past it. We encounter everything we  <br/>
need in real life contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Just as it was with learning English. Kids don&#39;t set out to learn  <br/>
English. They set out to get from life what they want. English is a  <br/>
tool that that use. They don&#39;t even consciously try to improve their  <br/>
tool use. They just get better at it by using it as a side effect of  <br/>
wanting something else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt; And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>
&gt; seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>
&gt; but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>
&gt; somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>
&gt; look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>
&gt; on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>
&gt; sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>
&gt; teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get on his own.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, people remember the times that worked for them.<br/>
<br/>
There are far more numerous times when it doesn&#39;t work, when it turns  <br/>
someone off to something they would have enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
What turned me off to organ was learning songs that I didn&#39;t care to  <br/>
learn because there was supposedly a progression one had to go  <br/>
through. The teachers went through it and it got them where they are  <br/>
so the progression must work. Well, actually what it did was filter  <br/>
out the people that process  didn&#39;t work for!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is learning to play the guitar by playing the rock songs  <br/>
she wants to play. She&#39;s motivated to work past the tough spots  <br/>
because she wants the song. As opposed to the standard method of  <br/>
cramming in all the stuff kids will one day need to play what they  <br/>
want. Most kids never get past the cramming part. My daughter gets to  <br/>
jump right to what she wants and learns what she needs as a side  <br/>
effect because she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Schuyler about the Karate Kid. Actually I like the scene  <br/>
because I like the feeling of knowing something someone else doesn&#39;t  <br/>
and making them do things to get them to understand not only what I  <br/>
know but that I&#39;m superior.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a power trip.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s a good thing to recognize so we can avoid doing it to our  <br/>
kids because the other end of the power trip is *not* fun. The  <br/>
learner may learn something, but in the process they learn that  <br/>
having power rocks and not having power sucks. It can motivate  <br/>
someone to learn (have power) but it can also motivate people to lord  <br/>
their power over others because they were deprived of power  <br/>
themselves. (They become sensei who foist the wax on wax off power  <br/>
trip onto their students because it was done to them.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt; &quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re imagining unschooling as parents stepping back and children  <br/>
learning everything on their own through their own discoveries, then no.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re imagining children having *the freedom* to explore  <br/>
according to their interests, then yes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s our job as parents to run the parts of the world we think might  <br/>
interest them into their lives. And to help them reach what they&#39;re  <br/>
trying to reach. And to get out of their way when they&#39;re engaged.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is being on the look out for things a child might  <br/>
like. Just as you might do for your wife. If you&#39;re in a bookstore  <br/>
and see a book you&#39;re pretty sure she&#39;d like, you might buy it for  <br/>
her or at least tell her. Let her know it exists. We do that for our  <br/>
kids. But more actively since they can&#39;t be as much out in the world  <br/>
as adults can, won&#39;t be scanning lists of classes and events for  <br/>
something that sounds interesting. We use our superior knowledge of  <br/>
the world to filter out the stuff that probably won&#39;t interest them  <br/>
so they can see the stuff of potential interests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* hard to see how it works when the only model someone is  <br/>
familiar with is schooled kids who are being made to learn. Schooled  <br/>
kids tend to avoid stuff that has the patina of school because they  <br/>
negatively associate those things with school. Unschooled kids don&#39;t  <br/>
have that. Shakespeare and Spongebob are all equal: something to like  <br/>
or not like today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt; &quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
&gt; but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>
&gt; for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>
&gt; It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>
&gt; would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>
&gt; all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The advantage we have is that we know kids (our own and ourselves  <br/>
too!) who have experienced forced learning and natural learning. We  <br/>
can see the difference. Those who have only experienced forced  <br/>
learning can only imagine what the effect of natural learning is by  <br/>
extrapolating from forced learning.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t work. What seems likely to happen isn&#39;t what actually happens.<br/>
<br/>
As for focused, structured, incremental ... I think you&#39;re equating  <br/>
it with forced learning. The two can be separated! My daughter has  <br/>
been taking college math classes since she was 13. She likes them. To  <br/>
her they&#39;re fun. Statistics, problem solving, algebra, pre-calculus.  <br/>
Two her father taught, all of them she and her Dad did the homework  <br/>
together in the evening. What encouraged her to keep taking classes  <br/>
was that his goal wasn&#39;t for her to learn but to have fun. As a side  <br/>
effect, she did learn. (Or at least did well on the tests which isn&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily the same thing!)<br/>
<br/>
What my husband does with our daughter is what, I think, people  <br/>
imagine the ideal of structured learning is. Two people working  <br/>
together, having fun in discovering  things through a structured  <br/>
course. But it isn&#39;t the structured course that comes from. You can&#39;t  <br/>
sit a child down with a course and expect that magic to happen. It  <br/>
comes from someone loving the material, being enthusiastic and not  <br/>
caring if the child does the material or not. The goal is to have  <br/>
fun. If it&#39;s not fun, it gets dropped for something that is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about choice.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing about focused, structured, incremental learning is that  <br/>
the results are a lot easier to see. Structured education is more  <br/>
satisfying from someone *monitoring* the learning process. (It&#39;s also  <br/>
easier for educators to prove to parents, states and the school board  <br/>
that learning is taking place.) We *assume* that since we can see the  <br/>
learning and the progress that it must be superior to learning  <br/>
organically.<br/>
<br/>
Can you prove that? How would you prove it? With a test that is  <br/>
designed to test whether structured teaching has in fact resulted in  <br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
Can schools prove that their focused, structured, incremental process  <br/>
works? They have some kids that come out having done well on tests,  <br/>
but they also have kids who don&#39;t. They assume the process is  <br/>
responsible for the successes but without a control group how can  <br/>
they prove that claim? They can say the failures are the fault of the  <br/>
kids or family life, but, again, without a control group, how can  <br/>
they prove that claim?<br/>
<br/>
The real proof is in what unschooled kids do as adults I think. We&#39;re  <br/>
the control group. Our kids are learning and moving on in life  <br/>
without forced learning so it *can&#39;t* be the forced learning that is  <br/>
causing kids to learn in school. Fortunately we&#39;re paving the way  <br/>
with our own kids so you don&#39;t have to just trust that this is all  <br/>
some rosy glass type of deal. :-)<br/>

It is an efficient way to put large numbers of people through a  <br/>
process of exposure to a given body of material.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make it the best way to learn and our kids are REALLY  <br/>
lucky that they aren&#39;t stuck in a system that presumes it is.<br/>
<br/>
Because our society places so much emphasis on schooling (which mostly  <br/>
relies of formal educational methods), there is a tendency for people  <br/>
to think of these methods as the best or even the only way to learn  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, we counter that bias by talking a lot about all the  <br/>
other ways people learn.<br/>
<br/>
But, unschooling doesn&#39;t mean never being able to choose formal  <br/>
educational methods. It does mean seeing them for what they are,  <br/>
efficient for delivery of a body of material, but not particularly  <br/>
good at facilitating real learning, and, for unschoolers, just another  <br/>
possible option.<br/>

*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sometimes you need somebody to kinda help push you<br/>
through a sticky spot [in learning and/or achieving<br/>
something], and then you appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A:  &lt;HACKNEYED_PHRASE&gt;&quot;When the student is ready, the teacher appears.&quot;<br/>
&lt;&#92;HACKNEYED_PHRASE&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t help someone who doesn&#39;t want to be helped.  Even if you force<br/>
your will on them, even though you know it&#39;s &quot;for the better,&quot; they surely<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate it.  After many years, I finally understand why my own<br/>
father &quot;taught&quot; me what he did, the way he did.  And not surprisingly,<br/>
because he sucked at that kind of teaching, I didn&#39;t really learn those<br/>
lessons until long after the lesson was &quot;taught.&quot;  And THEN I get the guilt<br/>
trip that IF ONLY I HAD LISTENED....  Right, that whole line of reasoning is<br/>
for the birds.<br/>
<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
&quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>
seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>
but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>
somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>
look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>
on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>
sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>
teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
get on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A:  Again, you can&#39;t teach someone who doesn&#39;t want to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A:  As long as they&#39;re not told they&#39;re too stupid to do it.  I bought into<br/>
it, and now I&#39;m a wonderful sheep.  My DW can&#39;t understand how I can just<br/>
take someone else&#39;s &quot;word for it.&quot;  I have to work to maintain my own<br/>
identity sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Reverse question:<br/>
     Does wisdom come only through old age?<br/>
It is said that the beginning Buddhist student sees only her/himself, the<br/>
cup and the tea.<br/>
The experienced (?) student can see that he and the cup and the tea are one.<br/>
The Master sees him/herself, the cup and the tea.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, I think we spend our lives to re-learn what kids already know.<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>
for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>
It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>
would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>
all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A:  Great answers already!<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m afraid [our six year old daughter]<br/>
isn&#39;t being challenged enough ... I&#39;m<br/>
afraid that after a while she&#39;ll even start to feel<br/>
like she&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A:  I disagree.  I think what discourages children the most is being told,<br/>
through words, actions, or the overall environment they live in, that they<br/>
cannot do it and that they must be helped.  Another discouragement is that<br/>
they are constantly told that the world is a dangerous place.  Told this<br/>
enough, they will believe that it is ONLY a dangerous place, and the only<br/>
SAFE place is to withdraw FROM the world.  Given enough room and enough<br/>
experiences that the world is truly exciting and fun, she will challenge<br/>
herself in the ways that she wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the &quot;stupid&quot; part comes from comparing with others.  This can<br/>
be made worse if the child believes that the world is inherently dangerous<br/>
(withdraws), or that they cannot &quot;do it&quot; and must be constantly &quot;helped.&quot;<br/>
Add comparison to other kids, and they would likely feel GROSSLY<br/>
inadequate.  I know I did.  NOT comparing is a really tough issue, but it is<br/>
an important  one to be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
I have more to add, but then I always do.  (&quot;I&#39;m a ramblin&#39; man, and I&#39;ve<br/>
bored a lot of folks...all over the world...)<br/>

I&#39;m trying really hard to think of a time when someone did this to me <br/>
that I actually appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Huh uh. I&#39;m just resentful.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it was something that *I* wanted in the first place. THAT s <br/>
different. If I&#39;m struggling and I ask for assistance to get over the <br/>
hump---that&#39;s way different. I don&#39;t appreciate being forced to do <br/>
something &quot;for my own good.&quot; A swift kick in my pants isn&#39;t a bad <br/>
thing---IF I&#39;m looking for it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I don&#39;t remember the movie, but did the old man TELL the child <br/>
*why* he was doing the &quot;wax on-wax off&quot;? THat would make a really big <br/>
difference to me.<br/>
<br/>
And not just telling the child. But having the child *understand*.<br/>
<br/>
When Cameron first started with the drums, he didn&#39;t want to practice <br/>
paradiddles. It wasn&#39;t until *HE* found that he needed to do <br/>
paradiddles---why paradiddles were important---to HIM--that he decided <br/>
to play them.<br/>
<br/>
Had Mr Miogi (or whatever his name was) had explained FIRST *why* and <br/>
had the boy understood their importance, it would have made him less <br/>
resentful and more interested in waxing on and off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you EVER read anything here that said that a child guides himself?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you husband thinks unschooling is?<br/>
<br/>
That may be the fundamental confusion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Forced or chosen?<br/>
<br/>
Often I indulge in focused, structured, incremental learning. So do my <br/>
husband and kids. That&#39;s absolutely natural when you are serious about <br/>
a passion. Or passionate about a seriousness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you think there&#39;s NONE of that in unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think we *grow* into it though---as our passions become more *firm* <br/>
and our goals more concrete.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think young children need to focus so much. But I think if <br/>
there&#39;s something we&#39;re truly passionate about (at any age), we <br/>
naturally tend to focus more, structure our learning, and take more <br/>
deliberate, incremental steps.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and this one I forgot about when I posted<br/>
originally: &quot;I&#39;m afraid [our six year old daughter]<br/>
isn&#39;t being challenged enough ... and the longer that<br/>
goes on, the hesitant she&#39;ll be to challenge herself,<br/>
and the more resistant she&#39;ll be to challenges. I&#39;m<br/>
afraid that after a while she&#39;ll even start to feel<br/>
like she&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OHMYGAWD! SIX????<br/>
<br/>
A six year old needs to be challenged???<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think LIFE is challenging *enough* at six without having <br/>
arbitrary challenges imposed on a *very* young child??<br/>
<br/>
Seriously---she&#39;s mastering a language. She&#39;s learning how her body <br/>
moves and reacts. She&#39;s figuring out other humans&#39; (and animals&#39;) <br/>
bodily cues. She&#39;s studying strangers and culture and customs and <br/>
smells.<br/>
<br/>
At SIX, she&#39;s still grasping concepts (like numbers and vocabulary and <br/>
grammar and cuisine and culture) that an adult would CRINGE at if asked <br/>
to do so in a foreign land!<br/>
<br/>
Give her a break! Don&#39;t overload her little mind and body!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be up for many more challenges as she grows. I promise. It&#39;s <br/>
what humans DO.<br/>

more naturally to women than to men, to whom it may at first appear<br/>

Both guitar playing and computer programming are things people often  <br/>
learn without someone leading them through it - they &quot;play around&quot;  <br/>
with it, they pay attention to what other people have done, they try  <br/>
stuff on their own, they have fun, they work at it and use a lot of  <br/>

And I&#39;d like to take it further.<br/>
<br/>
At what point is someone &quot;good&quot; at something?<br/>

At what point is someone &quot;wiser&quot; and at what point can someone know how <br/>
to lead you through it?<br/>
<br/>

The first time I actually *taught* a dog obedience class, I was <br/>
petrified. Ben reminded me that, although I wasn&#39;t an &quot;expert,&quot; I <br/>
certainly knew more about dog training than anyone else there that <br/>
night. &lt;G&gt; That&#39;s kind of what a &quot;teacher&quot; is, isn&#39;t it? Someone who <br/>
knows more than the &quot;student&quot;?<br/>

The funny thing is (to quote _Illusions_): &quot;We teach best what we most <br/>

up, and I can definitely get by in the instrument, and I&#39;ve earned a <br/>
fair bit of money over the course of time playing guitar <br/>
professionally.  Knowing what I know about myself, I think that <br/>
lessons might have actually hindered my natural explorations of the <br/>
instrument.  The guitar fascinated me (still does), I made amazing <br/>
discoveries about the logic of the instrument, which led me to <br/>
discover music theory and physics.  I know that for many people, <br/>
music theory can be a dry subject, but not for me!!  I found it to be <br/>
incredible, full of metaphor and logic and beauty.  Perhaps if it had <br/>
been rammed down my throat I couldn&#39;t have discovered its richness.<br/>

program for the Mexican migrant farmworker community.  There are guys <br/>
who come every week and there are guys who come for a few weeks and <br/>
then move on.  A lot of guys show up wanting to learn to play guitar, <br/>
so I help them as best I can to get started, if they want me <br/>
to.  Last night, I saw this one guy showing a newcomer an exercise <br/>
that he had only just learned a few weeks earlier.  So very, very cool!<br/>

But for us he&#39;s learning lots, our son has xbox live so he&#39;s playing against other people of multiple ages, he&#39;s learning communication skills, virtual pen pals, he has friends  all over the world many of whom are homeschooled.  He&#39;s learning typing, critical thinking, strategic planning.  In addition our kids personally we go to the YMCA where they swim, do weights, the girls take areboics classes, they play Y sports from time to tiem when a sport interest them, the girls do gymnastics. We also have all of our kids in boy/girl scouts. Through scouts alone they do all sorts of camping, science merits, history merits, art merits, a variety. we also go on field trips with our homeschool group at least one a month. We feel all this combine makes a perfectly well rounded education!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would watch Family Guy with him.  There are tons of things that <br/>
come up on those shows that are fun to talk about and laugh <br/>
about.  By increasing your connection with him through these things <br/>
you can begin to get an idea of what other things will expand his <br/>
universe (Futurama, the Simpsons, et al. are also a lot of fun and <br/>
there is a ton of learning in each ~ verrrry educational!), and you <br/>
can suggest those things.  Right now, the prospect of leaving the <br/>
house may not be more interesting than what he&#39;s doing at home.  But, <br/>
what if you learned of, say, a Family Guy convention nearby?  He&#39;d <br/>
probably be into going to that.  What else might that lead to for him?<br/>
<br/>
Same with the video games.  I support my son&#39;s interests in the <br/>
various video games he plays by getting him strategy guides (how he <br/>
learned to read), looking things up on the Internet for him when he <br/>
needs me to, posting questions in his behalf, helping him get more <br/>
games that are interesting to him.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Liam, is really loving Guitar Hero right now, and it&#39;s <br/>
incredible how that has broadened his horizons, as well as what it&#39;s <br/>
done for his reading (musically and otherwise) and his <br/>
timing.  Really cool!  He goes between Guitar Hero, World of <br/>
Warcraft, Dragonball Z on the Wii, Pokemon on the DS, running around <br/>
outside.  He is a happy, thriving person!  (yay!!!)<br/>
<br/>
By increasing your connection with your son through the things *he* <br/>
loves to do, you make your connection stronger and both of your lives <br/>
more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little.  I&#39;m gonna let someone else field the <br/>
other question about your husband &#39;cause I&#39;m *supposed* to be working <br/>
right now!  ;-)<br/>

My DS (12.5yo) has been out of school now for 1.5 years. During this<br/>
time he&#39;s had no interest in leaving the house. Right now his day<br/>
consists mostly of playing XBox (mostly Oblivion or Circle of Doom)<br/>
and watching Family Guy DVD&#39;s. What types of things would you do to<br/>
expand his world and play a more active role in his day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Play WITH him. Show that*you* have an interest in what interests *him*.<br/>
<br/>
After a year or so of this (or what SEEMS like a year or so!), he will <br/>
start reciprocating. But *you* will need to show him what that looks <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep i n mind that, right now, he&#39;s healing from years of school <br/>
damage. He needs your support in this healing. The more support you can <br/>
give, the sooner he&#39;ll heal. The *less dupportive you are, the longer <br/>
it&#39;ll take.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also, my DH is against unschooling - how would you show DH that DS<br/>
is learning by playing video games all day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Make your husband play video games all day? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your husband is willing to see how difficult the games actually <br/>
ARE----by *playing* them---he&#39;ll be more likely to accept that they <br/>
aren&#39;t a waste of time. They really DO require focus and strategy and <br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
ALso---a few books and an article, if he&#39;s willing to read:<br/>
<br/>
Mark Prensky & Daniel Pink---two MEN (men tend to respect PhDs with <br/>
penises. &lt;g&gt;) who truly see the benefits  *in this day and age* of <br/>
video games.<br/>

But here&#39;s where my husband&#39;s coming from: <br/>
<br/>
He tried to play the piano for years as a teen, really liked it, <br/>
worked hard at it, even wanted to be a concert pianist! It wasn&#39;t til <br/>
years later that he realized he was mostly &quot;spinning his wheels&quot; all <br/>
those years. He didn&#39;t any have any real direction, didn&#39;t realize <br/>
how lacking his skills were and what skills he would need to even <br/>
come CLOSE to CONSIDERING being a classical pianist. (For example, he <br/>
had never played a scale, doesn&#39;t know how to tell what key a piece <br/>
is in, and had never memorized a piece.)<br/>
<br/>
And he feels like he wasted a LOT of time and energy, in an area that <br/>
REALLY interested him, because he didn&#39;t have somebody knowledgable <br/>
guide him. [He had a teacher, but not a very skilled one, although <br/>
both he and his parents thought the teacher was great; they didn&#39;t <br/>
know any better.]<br/>
<br/>
Similar experience for him in computer programmer. He learned on-the-<br/>
job, and yes, he can do it, but he&#39;s had many periods of banging his <br/>
head against a wall and going in circles for a LONG time trying <br/>
to &quot;connect the dots&quot; in a way that, he claims, wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
elusive to him had he gotten his degree in Computer Science and gone <br/>
through all that coursework. <br/>
<br/>
So partly because of this two experiences, he believes that learning <br/>
through playing around, trial and error, trying stuff on his own, is <br/>
actually MORE frustrating, LESS efficient, and wastes a lot of time <br/>
and energy, than structured, thought-out instruction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685370100">Did he really waste a lot of time?  Did he not enjoy the process of<br/>
playing?  The time spent &quot;banging&quot; on the keys?  I guess I&#39;ve never<br/>
thought I&#39;ve wasted my time during a pleasurable pursuit.  I draw, I<br/>
enjoy it.  I&#39;m not good at it.  I do cartoon stuff.  But it&#39;s not a<br/>
waste of my time if it brings me joy.  Can I make a living at it?  No.<br/>
 Not with the skill set I have now, but if I wanted to, I could seek a<br/>
qualified teacher (and I would know who that was now as an adult but<br/>
not as a child) and learn and then attempt to use it as a job, but<br/>
somehow I think *having* to do it, for someone else, to their<br/>
standards and on a deadline would take the fun out of it.  In fact I<br/>
know it would, because I write too...and when I write for the joy of<br/>
it I do enjoy it.  But when I&#39;m on a deadline and dealing with editors<br/>
it&#39;s not as much fun.  Anyway, I guess I think your husband didn&#39;t<br/>
waste his time because he enjoyed it.  Just because he&#39;s not making a<br/>
living at it doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t still mess around playing the<br/>
piano.  We can&#39;t all be superstars in everything but that shouldn&#39;t<br/>
stop us from enjoying messing around with it.  Whether that be<br/>
football, drawing, piano, or whatnot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591261599">Dear Jenny:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know everything about your husband&#39;s experiences with music and<br/>
computers, but it may be worthwhile to observe that he has not yet<br/>
experienced structured instruction in these two areas.  So how does he know<br/>
that he would have accomplished more if he had gone through with a degree or<br/>
whatever?<br/>
<br/>
For my own part, I have met with great success in publishing poetry, in<br/>
spite of�or rather because of�zero formal training or guidance in this area.<br/>
Nobody taught me anything, and I still don&#39;t know anything about poetic<br/>
forms, what rhymes and what doesn&#39;t, etc.  I just played around.  Yes, a lot<br/>
of my work in the beginning was very bad, but I am convinced that if anyone<br/>
had tried to &quot;guide&quot; me during this stage, it would have either destroyed<br/>
the fun in it or it would have limited my later success, for though it may<br/>
have weaned me of the junk and directed me to make more sense, how much<br/>
would I be able to accomplish creatively in that direction?  Maybe nice,<br/>
sensible, and solid work, but nowhere near the spectacular and original<br/>
poetry I did that won much recognition�for example, getting published in<br/>
POETRY, many fellowships, and being broadcast on Martha Stewart.  And I<br/>
never did take a single class in composition, let alone poetry writing!  <br/>
<br/>
So I can certainly vouch for playing around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s my personality, but I&#39;ve always been a skeptic. I tend to  <br/>
compare what I&#39;m being taught against the real world and question the  <br/>
rightness of the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that in an &quot;I&#39;m superior&quot; way, but it&#39;s a good thing  <br/>
to examine why there weren&#39;t clues over the years for your husband  <br/>
and his parents.<br/>
<br/>
It could be personality, especially if his parents are the same way.<br/>
<br/>
It could be school had taught him to believe a teacher without question.<br/>
<br/>
So what was the answer? Not the teacher, I think, but the ability of  <br/>
the student to question himself and his world.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why schools are a dangerous place! The whole point is &quot;Sit  <br/>
down, shut up, do what I tell you without question and you&#39;ll end up  <br/>
where experts think it&#39;s best you be.&quot; It&#39;s a lie. Obviously from  <br/>
your husband&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Similar experience for him in computer programmer. He learned on-the-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or he could have had teachers like his piano teacher.<br/>
<br/>
He *thinks* school would have straightened out his confusion. He  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
Just ask the thousands of kids graduating from public school who are  <br/>
still confused after 12 years whether school is a cure for confusion!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always learned best by plunging in and doing. When I have a  <br/>
question, I hunt resources (including other people) for answers,  <br/>
tried various things until I found an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the question is, why didn&#39;t that work for him?<br/>
<br/>
One reason might be that it&#39;s antithetical to school learning for  <br/>
kids to learn how to solve problems on their own. Kids are there in  <br/>
school to memorize the right answers and the right methods. Real life  <br/>
isn&#39;t like that. Questions are messy and there actually might be  <br/>
dozens of right answers with varying degrees of good and bad points  <br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why school isn&#39;t a great place to learn how to learn!<br/>

<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo---because he worked hard at it (although not so hard as to learn <br/>
to play a scale, understand what key a piece is in, OR memorize a piece <br/>
of music??!! ), he assumed he could be a concert pianist???<br/>
<br/>
I know there were/are kids in high school that think they can be <br/>
professional basketball players and think that, if they are better than <br/>
the few guys in the neighborhood, they can be the next Michael Jordan. <br/>
Maybe so, but most realize that it takes a lot of *talent* as well as <br/>
hard work to get to that point. They eventually come to know that they <br/>
aren&#39;t that good OR they go on to pursue it harder and closer and find <br/>
bigger and better venues/coaches/opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my questions would be: How come he thought his skills were so <br/>
high? Did someone lead him to believe that? Did he not listen to/watch <br/>
big name pianists? Whom was he comparing himself to? What opportunities <br/>
did he have to explore piano?<br/>
<br/>
I know I had the *talent* (as well as the desire) to try out for the <br/>
Olympics. I felt there were other obstacles. School was one. (Go <br/>
figure! &lt;G&gt;) Moving away from home at 16 was another. There was no <br/>
guarantee that I would have made it, but looking back---it would have <br/>
been nice to go for it. &lt;g&gt; But there were bigger names in the sport <br/>
who felt I should have the opportunity. I didn&#39;t &quot;make that up&quot; because <br/>
I wanted it---*others* in the sport came to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And he feels like he wasted a LOT of time and energy, in an area that<br/>
REALLY interested him, because he didn&#39;t have somebody knowledgable<br/>
guide him. [He had a teacher, but not a very skilled one, although<br/>
both he and his parents thought the teacher was great; they didn&#39;t<br/>
know any better.]<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear he felt that he wasted his time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
The time I spent at my sport was HUGE. It shaped me like nothing else <br/>
---other than maybe becoming a parent---ever has. Involving myself in a <br/>
passion---any passion---has been important in becoming Who I Am.<br/>
<br/>
Also---I didn&#39;t take one person&#39;s word for anything. I looked for <br/>
different trainers. In fact, at one point, I had a different coach for <br/>
each day of the week! &lt;G&gt; They each had a specialty and a different way <br/>
to approach the same problem, and it was good for me to try different <br/>
tactics. I used what worked for me and enjoyed the novelty of the <br/>
different trainers and their abilities. ANd I worked HARD for each of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve encouraged both my boys to immerse themselves in their passions <br/>
wholly and fully. Cameron&#39;s interests in magic, baseball, soccer, <br/>
skateboarding, film-making, drumming, cooking, and now outdoor <br/>
leadership/camping/backpacking---not a MINUTE of those passions has <br/>
been wasted. Each as given him a huge sense of Who He Is and what he <br/>
can accomplish. He has learned skills and abilities he didn&#39;t know. If <br/>
he never plays another game of baseball or never does another magic <br/>
trick (and he was GOOD!!!) or makes another film---all those things <br/>
have been essential to Who He Is Now. I hope he never thinks of that <br/>
time as wasted.<br/>
<br/>
I also encourage them to meet as many different ways to approach their <br/>
passions. When Cam was playing drums, he explored the djembe, bamboo <br/>
drums, Scottish pipe and drums corps, jazz, blues, and funk. Danny was <br/>
his main instructor, but Cameron worked with other bigger names in <br/>
drumming when he&#39;d meet them---just asked for an hour of their time. <br/>
People LOVE to share their passions---and when they find a young person <br/>
(or even an OLD person! &lt;G&gt;) with the same passion, they are THRILLED <br/>
to share what they know. I mean---*beyond* thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Similar experience for him in computer programmer. He learned on-the-<br/>

elusive to him had he gotten his degree in Computer Science and gone<br/>
through all that coursework.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that almost anything that&#39;s new and worth learning---and <br/>
especially something that&#39;s difficult!---requires a lot of <br/>
head-banging. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I know several computer programmers who learned without <br/>
getting a degree in Computer Science. What about them?<br/>
<br/>
Did he never think to *ask* a more knowledgeable person for help?? Or <br/>
did he just sit there trying to figure it out for himself?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a LOT to be said for figuring it out by yourself, but <br/>
sometimes, there&#39;s just no need to reinvent the wheel.<br/>
<br/>

So partly because of this two experiences, he believes that learning<br/>
through playing around, trial and error, trying stuff on his own, is<br/>
actually MORE frustrating, LESS efficient, and wastes a lot of time<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes. But if so, why didn&#39;t he seek out more help?<br/>
<br/>
Each person learns best in his own way. It&#39;s a good idea to know what <br/>
works for you.<br/>
<br/>
I like a lot of information but not so much direction. I usually gather <br/>
as much information on a subject as I can and then work my way through <br/>
it as best I can. I make mistakes (we call them learning-takes) and <br/>
learn from them, and then I fix those mistakes and go on. Sometimes <br/>
that&#39;s frustrating, but I can choose to keep doing it or quit.  Other <br/>
people prefer more hand-holding. It&#39;s really about what works for *you*.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband can&#39;t decide what works for your son. Only your son can <br/>
make that decision. But that takes trial and error---to find what works <br/>
for each individual. And that may change as we grow and learn and get <br/>
older. It helps to be open to what works for us at the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think the role of facilitator rather than teacher comes somewhat<br/>
more naturally to women than to men, to whom it may at first appear<br/>
purely passive. For men it may be easier to agree that there is a<br/>
difference between leadership and dictatorship. Then the question<br/>
becomes: how to put that distinction to work in practice?<br/>
<br/>

I would be willing to discuss this further if you could clarify what <br/>
you mean.<br/>

I&#39;m trying to find an angle to come at it from. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785992250">Gotcha. I understand.<br/>
<br/>
Did his parents know what he was trying to do? Did they not help him?  <br/>
Fill him in on what he would need to do to become a concert pianist?  <br/>
Did he refuse to have a teacher? Why would he refuse help?<br/>
<br/>
This is why the role of the unschooling parent is SO important - we&#39;re  <br/>
there to help our kids achieve their goals, right? If he was an  <br/>
unschooler, his parents would be taking him to concerts, introducing  <br/>
him to concert pianists, making sure he had lots of access to full  <br/>
information, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Or - it is pretty odd that he worked that hard, loved it so much, had  <br/>
such concrete plans, but never asked to take a lesson, never looked  <br/>
into what it takes to actually become a concert pianist? Maybe he DID  <br/>
know, deep down, that he wasn&#39;t really preparing to be a concert  <br/>
pianist, but he just loved playing and it somehow justified the time  <br/>
spent on it if he claimed to want to be a concert pianist. (Just a  <br/>
wild guess, but I&#39;ve heard this before.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836407964">&quot;So partly because of this two experiences, he believes that learning<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quite understanding the argument here, because it seems to me he&#39;s<br/>
proving your point.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
First of all, if someone told him he needed further instruction to reach his<br/>
goals would he have pursued it?  Why did he never look into what it takes to<br/>
become a concert pianist?  When he found out that his instruction hadn&#39;t<br/>
prepared him, why didn&#39;t he find what he needed?  What is stopping him from<br/>
pursuing that as a career now, or at least continuing to enjoy playing the<br/>
piano?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No one is saying &quot;because we&#39;re unschoolers we can&#39;t seek out structured,<br/>
thought-out instruction&quot;.  As unschoolers, I&#39;d say we&#39;re more equipped to<br/>
look for exactly what we want and find it.  Its all about taking back your<br/>
own power;  getting a second opinion, finding what works for *you* (or our<br/>
kids finding what works for them, with our help, a role that our parents<br/>
weren&#39;t prepared to fill but that we can fill for our kids because we have<br/>
resources like books, email lists, websites, etc.).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, choosing to seek out structured, thought-out instruction is a<br/>
completely different world from having structured, thought-out instruction<br/>
imposed upon you.  I would argue that the only people who benefit fully from<br/>
formal instruction are those who have chosen that instruction freely.   To<br/>
devote yourself to something is not the same thing as someone else devoting<br/>
you to that activity without your input.    Or even the same as saying &quot;so<br/>
you want to be a piano player?  Well, here&#39;s your teacher, do what she says<br/>
and you&#39;ll learn how.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are many different learning styles, and &quot;structured, thought-out<br/>
instruction&quot; can take many, many different forms- all of them valid and<br/>
useful for different people.   Just because one approach, teacher, or<br/>
teaching method doesn&#39;t work for a particular learner it is not an<br/>
indication that the learner is incapable of achieving a higher level of<br/>
skill, and it also doesn&#39;t prove that the particular approach, teacher, or<br/>
teaching method is a failure.  It&#39;s just not the right match between the<br/>
learner and what they want out of their experience.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It looks to me that you&#39;re seeing &quot;one right way&quot; thinking.  Your dh is<br/>
stuck in the place where he thinks there must be one right way to do or<br/>
learn things- the BEST way.  The thing is, we live in a world of infinite<br/>
possibilities.  We just need to open ourselves up to seeing all of them.<br/>
And what is best for one person isn&#39;t necessarily the best for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this isn&#39;t as coherent as it could be.I have a 3yo jumping up and<br/>
down on me asking to play Webkinz- makes it hard for me to focus!  So I&#39;m<br/>
off to play.<br/>

and respond to him ...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the idea of having the right &quot;tools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone else had posted, &quot;Was it really a waste of time? Didn&#39;t he <br/>
enjoy playing?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well, he probably did (and still does), but he feels like he was <br/>
trying to accomplish something and just spent a LOT of time going <br/>
around in circles. And he COULD have at least come a lot closer to <br/>
accomplishing what he wanted (a flawless Rachmaninoff piece, for <br/>
example, even if he didn&#39;t have a career as a musician) -- had he <br/>
just been shown and given the proper tools.<br/>
<br/>
An analogy he gave me is that if you&#39;re trying to learn something - <br/>
say, woodworking, which he has done -- where there is a finished <br/>
product in mind, and you&#39;re spending hours and hours and failed <br/>
attempt after failed attempt trying to get a straight corner, and <br/>
it&#39;s driving you crazy ... and then, somehow, you learn about a tool <br/>
(I think in this case it&#39;s called a jig.)<br/>
<br/>
And you go, &quot;Oh my gosh! With this proper tool, I can make the corner <br/>
FLAWLESSLY in just a few minutes with little effort! I wasted SO MUCH <br/>
TIME trying to do it myself without this simple tool! It&#39;s a GOOD <br/>
THING I found out about jigs, or else I&#39;ve be wasting weekend after <br/>
weekend trying to get that corner straight, and there&#39;s NO REASON to <br/>
have to work so hard or be so frustrated ... you just have to have <br/>
the RIGHT TOOLS!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s afraid our kids are not going to get all the &quot;tools&quot; they <br/>
need for all kinds of things in life if I don&#39;t sit down and show <br/>
them how to write their letters correctly, etc etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally understand. He had a lousy teacher and he, himself, didn&#39;t  <br/>
have the kind of personal initiative that an unschooler would  <br/>
typically have, to realize he had a lousy teacher and go out and get  <br/>
the information on his own. He&#39;s resentful - and understandably so. He  <br/>
believed his teacher would tell him everything he needed to know.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the unschooled kids view teachers as  <br/>
resources, not as all-knowing experts to be totally depended upon to  <br/>
provide all possible or all necessary information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell him that he&#39;s right that there are times that it makes a lot  <br/>
more sense to utilize an expert who can help you organize your  <br/>
approach to learning something. For sure. Especially as what we want  <br/>
to learn gets more specific and more goal-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
But, most younger children learn most things better if they more or  <br/>
less construct their own knowledge in an environment that is rich and  <br/>
stimulating and with supportive adults who pay close attention and  <br/>
interact and help.<br/>
<br/>
He may be picturing kids just playing around without any guidance or  <br/>
support - that&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to be a professional actress. She spent years  <br/>
playing around with acting as a young child, with support in the form  <br/>
of going to LOTS of shows, being provided lots of chances to play with  <br/>
other kids who also liked putting on shows, being provided with lots  <br/>
of costume materials and prop materials, and chances to perform when  <br/>
she wanted to do that. As she got older, we worked together to figure  <br/>
out what kind of acting workshops or lessons or classes or other  <br/>
experiences would be good for her to pursue. I learned a whole lot  <br/>
about acting schools, performance groups, how to pursue a career in  <br/>
the performing arts, colleges and vocational schools, internships,  <br/>
scholarships, private and group lessons, and on and on, and passed  <br/>
information on to her.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;d been my unschooling son, he wouldn&#39;t have been in the dark  <br/>
about what was needed - I&#39;d have helped him and he&#39;d have pursued the  <br/>
information. For sure.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a lot easier to blame a teacher (or lack therof) for some<br/>
perceived failure, rather than look within. That&#39;s what the schooled<br/>
mentality creates in human beings. When a mind has been schooled<br/>
properly, that person gives credit to teachers for success and blames<br/>
teachers for perceived failures. Sounds like he&#39;s been well-schooled!;)<br/>
<br/>
As to older unschoolers....my oldest is 18. He&#39;s starting to travel on<br/>
his own now (a kiddo that hated to travel, got sick on every airplane<br/>
and was fearful of traveling without his parents). Took a bus ride to<br/>
visit his girlfriend two weeks ago and just got back home. The very<br/>
first exam he ever took in his life was voluntary, a college exam<br/>
actually.:)<br/>
He sits in on Moira&#39;s college courses when he visits her and took the<br/>
political science exam one time, just fer fun. He did better than most<br/>
of the kids in the class without having studied the materials. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a logical guy. Looks at issues from lots of viewpoints and<br/>
reasons things out in a very intelligent manner. I learn a lot from<br/>
him. Trevor knows more about computers and technology than most of the<br/>
&quot;tech support&quot; people we talk to. He&#39;s not the kind of person that is<br/>
in the spotlight, or doing some grand-looking thing or wears some<br/>
label of &quot;success&quot; according to most of the world. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s thoughtful, intelligent, well-spoken and capable. He trusts his<br/>
own abilities more than I ever did at that age. He struggles with his<br/>
own issues too, just like any human. He&#39;ll also tell you that<br/>
unschooling was the best way for him to learn and grow. He&#39;s very<br/>
grateful for his free life and I can see the results in a beautiful,<br/>
brilliant and strong human being that is quite comfortable in his own<br/>
skin. What more could a parent want for their child?<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The thing is, the unschooling mindset would have a woodworker going &quot;hmmm,<br/>
there should be a tool that makes this easy&quot;, and then the unschooling<br/>
woodworker would ask around, do some research, and discover that indeed this<br/>
tool exists and learn how to use it through whatever means were available<br/>
and fit him, whether that be an online tutorial, a book, a tv show, or being<br/>
shown how to by someone who knows.  Or, if the tool didn&#39;t exist, perhaps<br/>
this woodworker would say &quot;this seems like it should exist&quot; and figure out<br/>
how to create such a tool- again, using a variety of resources that are at<br/>
the disposal of anyone who cares to look for them.   As unschooling parents<br/>
its our job to let our kids explore and provide support when its needed- so<br/>
if the woodworker were a child, the parent would be responsible for saying<br/>
&quot;wow, that looks difficult, do you want some help looking for a way that is<br/>
less frustrating?&quot; or just doing some research and finding out for them,<br/>
then offering the information. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is never too late to find the tools you need to do something you want to<br/>
do.  But you need to take personal responsibility for your learning in order<br/>
to do it.  If a learner is going to sit and wait for a teacher to hand them<br/>
everything they need, they very well may not get what they need at all.<br/>
Which is what your dh&#39;s piano story illustrates rather vividly.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As Pam said though, young children do tend to learn more through exploration<br/>
than through being shown exactly what to do.  It&#39;s a developmental<br/>
difference between children and adults (whether young or more mature) .<br/>
With my own kids I have noticed that even though they sometimes appear to<br/>
need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, rejecting suggestions or new information<br/>
initially,  their learning has so much more depth than if they had just<br/>
automatically adopted new information or taken suggestions.  <br/>

&gt; aren&#39;t a waste of time. They really DO require focus and strategy <br/>

 My DS is almost 14. We took him out of school in May 2007. At first, <br/>
we tried the school thing at home. You know, a math workbook etc.. <br/>
Quickly discovered, NOT! He also almost exclusively plays xbox. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t wish for me to play with him(right now anyway) he does <br/>
however (more and more so) talk with me about it. He also doesn&#39;t <br/>
wish to leave the house very often.<br/>
One thing I found is it&#39;s okay to talk with him about my feelings and <br/>
thoughts and it leads to him talking more also about his. This is new <br/>
to both of us.<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions and encouragement from all, as I&#39;ve been <br/>
a &quot;lurker&quot; for some time. Often I felt I was the only one <br/>
experiencing these feelings, anxieties, etc.. Thanks.</div>
