   Just going to be honest with myself and say &#39;yes&#39;, what I&#39;m worried<br/>
about is that OTHERS will think my children are &#39;stupid&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is what others think about them more important than *they* are?<br/>
<br/>
--==-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the world were a bigger better nicer place then it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
concern...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But if *you* don&#39;t make it a concern,...<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the world changes a little bit with each of us.  <br/>
Maybe---probably--- just a tiny, infitismal amount.<br/>
<br/>
But if one person were to announce, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me what <br/>
others think of my children&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, if one person, just one person, does it they may think she&#39;s <br/>
really sick and<br/>
they won&#39;t believe her.  And if two people, two people do it, in <br/>
harmony,<br/>
they may think they&#39;re both nuts and they won&#39;t take listen to either <br/>
of them.<br/>
And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in<br/>
singing a bar of &quot;It Doesn&#39;t Matter What Other People Think About My <br/>
Children&quot;<br/>
and walking out? They may think it&#39;s an organization!  And can you, can <br/>
you imagine<br/>
fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day, walking in singing a bar <br/>
of &quot;It Doesn&#39;t Matter...&quot;<br/>
and walking out?  And friends they may thinks it&#39;s a movement.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;It Doesn&#39;t Matter What Other People Think About My Children&quot; <br/>
Movement.<br/>
<br/>
They might call it unschooling.<br/>
They might start e-lists.<br/>
They might start conferences.<br/>
Conferences all over the country....<br/>
<br/>
Children might become free of school! Free to think, learn, and be. <br/>
Living through life joyfully!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this.  Just this morning I had a LONG conversation with a lady who<br/>
picked up a sewing machine that I freecycled.  She saw Mary Elayne and asked<br/>
if my kids were home sick and I said that we homeschooled.  First words out<br/>
of her mouth, &quot;What curriculum do you use.&quot;  So I thought about this &quot;It<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter&quot; thread and so instead of my usual &quot;we do interested led<br/>
learning&quot; I said, &quot;Oh we don&#39;t use a curriculum at all.  Kids are going to<br/>
learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it.&quot;  Then we had a<br/>
nearly 40 minute discussion (quite civil) about learning and schools and how<br/>
I came to trust my children to learn what they need to learn when they need<br/>
to learn it.  It dawned on me that she is not DCFS or CPS or the school<br/>
board or the truant officer.  And she didn&#39;t strike me as the type that<br/>
would go out of her way to call DCFS, CPS, the school board or the truant<br/>
officer and when she drove out of my yard with her new sewing machine<br/>
whatever happened with our conversation would be of little impact on my<br/>
children (but hopefully it would open her eyes to other possibilities for<br/>
her children :) )  She actually thought it was pretty cool and when I didn&#39;t<br/>
show any remorse in &quot;being stuck home with my kids&quot; and that I enjoy being<br/>
with them she backed off on the &quot;why would I do something like that line.&quot;<br/>
I wonder if I even got her wheels turning.  She (of course) asked about<br/>
socialization and I asked her if she had talked to anyone today.  Store<br/>
clerks, friends on the phone, her children, me?  I said, that is all<br/>
socialization.  I said that the beauty of homeschooling is that my kids are<br/>
able to socialize with all kinds of people of all ages and backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
So either she thinks I&#39;m pretty cool because I homeschool my kids and follow<br/>
their lead or either she thinks I&#39;m that crazy woman with the weedy front<br/>
yard wearing the hippy broomstick skirt sucking down Chakra tea.  Either<br/>
way, I don&#39;t care.<br/>

Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
hehehe... that made me laugh... because I am so that hippy chick with the<br/>
weedy front yard with the skirt and the tea.... hehehe.... and it&#39;s so nice<br/>
that I&#39;ve actually started to accept myself and love myself for being who I<br/>
am and no longer feeling ashamed that I&#39;m not living up to some arbitrary<br/>
standard that my family or the world has put on me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Just going to be honest with myself and say &#39;yes&#39;, what I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; worried<br/>
&gt; &gt; about is that OTHERS will think my children are &#39;stupid&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is what others think about them more important than *they* are?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; If the world were a bigger better nicer place then it wouldn&#39;t <br/>

&gt; &gt; concern...<br/>

&gt; &gt; -=-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But if *you* don&#39;t make it a concern,...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Plus, the world changes a little bit with each of us.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe---probably--- just a tiny, infitismal amount.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But if one person were to announce, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You know, if one person, just one person, does it they may think <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; really sick and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they won&#39;t believe her.  And if two people, two people do it, in <br/>
&gt; &gt; harmony,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they may think they&#39;re both nuts and they won&#39;t take listen to <br/>
&gt; either <br/>
&gt; &gt; of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people <br/>
&gt; walking in<br/>

&gt; &gt; Children&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and walking out? They may think it&#39;s an organization!  And can <br/>
&gt; you, can <br/>
&gt; &gt; you imagine<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They might call it unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They might start e-lists.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They might start conferences.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Conferences all over the country....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Children might become free of school! Free to think, learn, and <br/>
