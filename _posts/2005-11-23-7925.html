<br/>
1 Chile pepper, cut in 1/2, seeds removed.<br/>
5 C. 1/2 and 1/2, or whole milk<br/>
1 vanilla bean, split<br/>
1-2 cinnamon sticks<br/>
8 oz. bittersweet chocolate<br/>
2 Tbs. sugar<br/>
1 Tbs. almonds, ground fine<br/>
<br/>
Add Chile pepper to 2C. boiling water, cook until liquid is reduced <br/>
to 1C.  Remove pepper and strain liquid, set aside.  In med. <br/>
saucepan, combine milk, vanilla bean and Cinnamon stick.  Heat until <br/>
bubbles appear around edge.  Reduce heat to low, add chocolate and <br/>
sugar, whisk until dissolved.<br/>
Turn off heat, remove cinnamon stick and vanilla bean.  Stire in <br/>
ground almonds, add chile pepper infusion a little at a time to <br/>
taste (making sure flavor isn&#39;t too strong).<br/>
<br/>
I got this from Fuegonuevo.com...I think. It&#39;s a Mayan food cuisine <br/>
site. Haven&#39;t really looked around, but thought this looked really <br/>
good.<br/>
