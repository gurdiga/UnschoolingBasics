<div id="ygrps-yiv-323867933">Yelling &quot;bad mommy&quot; doesn&#39;t sound experimental, it sounds like something borne <br/>
from frustration or tiredness or hunger. I don&#39;t think you can fix her <br/>
frustration without focusing more on her. <br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis wrote an e-mail on this list in March that really is the best response <br/>
to a child who is &quot;acting out.&quot;<br/>

***My ds is 4 and he takes tools (real, toy, knives, whatever he can find <br/>

something with) and digs, cuts, scrapes into one of the windowsills and one <br/>
particular<br/>
part of the living room wall.***<br/>
<br/>
Where are you when he digs the windowsills or walls?<br/>
If you know he&#39;s likely to do it (because he&#39;s done it before) you should be <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
***For the most part he&#39;ll stop when redirected, or told<br/>
why it&#39;s not ok. ***<br/>
<br/>
But he does it again? After you told him why it&#39;s not ok?<br/>
He needs you with him more, then.<br/>
<br/>
***he will hit or throw things at his sister when she doesn&#39;t want to play <br/>
with<br/>
him. He won&#39;t be dissuaded by our attempts to get him focused on something<br/>
else, playing with dh or me, helping us with something***<br/>
<br/>
It seems like he needs more direct attention from you so that he&#39;s not left <br/>
to dig walls or depend on his sister to be his play mate.<br/>
<br/>
Busy moms sometimes forget how much four year olds still need attention. <br/>
They can seem so mature about so many things - able to get snacks and <br/>
drinks, able to work the TV and DVR and computer.  But they really need mom <br/>
attention.  If you are doing housework or on the computer while he&#39;s doing <br/>
his own thing, he&#39;s on his own too much.    Play with him a lot while his <br/>
sister is in school.  Get out and do things together, even if that&#39;s just <br/>
digging a big hole in the garden.  Be right with him, be his companion. <br/>
Helping him find appropriate things to bang up and destroy is fine but it <br/>
has to come with the attention and companionship he&#39;s craving or it won&#39;t be <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
If being destructive is his outlet for feelings of frustration or loneliness <br/>
you can change that.  If he has opportunity to destroy appropriate things <br/>
but still feels frustrated or lonely, he might find other, possibly more <br/>
destructive outlets.  Don&#39;t expect the act of destruction to fulfill him. <br/>
*You* are the only thing that can fulfill him.  Your time, your attention.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve said he&#39;s not polite, he&#39;s destructive and he&#39;s hurting his sister, <br/>
you should be with him all the time.  If that means leaving housework until <br/>
your partner gets home, or waiting to get on the computer until he&#39;s asleep, <br/>
then that&#39;s what it means right now.  He&#39;s growing and changing and won&#39;t be <br/>
four forever.<br/>

<br/>
Time is what you need to give, spend more and more time with your daughter. Lots <br/>
and lots of time playing and hanging out and talking about things and brushing <br/>
barbies hair and drawing and watching Spongebob together or Phineas and Ferb or <br/>
whatever and just be with her. The more time you spend with her, being with her, <br/>
the less angry she&#39;ll get in a moment. There won&#39;t be such a build up of need <br/>
behind her to create such an explosion of frustration. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Step away from the idea of experimenting with a behavior and instead see her as trying to communicate. She has big feelings, so she uses the biggest words and phrases she has, in terms of their impact, to express them. In 4yo terms, &quot;bad mommy&quot; is about the worst cuss imaginable! So its important to respond to all that emotion without getting tangled up in the grown-up baggage tied to those words.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a little bitty person in a world that&#39;s too big and complex for her to deal with all on her own - that&#39;s rough. Its easy to forget that its hard to be a little kid, and some kids have a much harder time Being little, being children! than others. <br/>
<br/>
Do you ever swear? If not, maybe you could start - when something goes wrong from her perspective, exclaim &quot;Tartar Sauce&quot; or whatever you like. That&#39;s something for you to experiment with, rather than trying to explain to her that you don&#39;t like her words - offer her different words by the simple expedient of exclaiming them yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I cringe frequently around others...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever heard a cop say &quot;you can&#39;t let other people do your driving for you&quot;? That&#39;s a line I&#39;ve held in mind more than once! And really, it doesn&#39;t Help to think about what others are thinking and saying - what helps is focusing on the needs of your child in the moment. Its so easy to get wrapped up in grown-up thoughts and expectations and forget how the world can seem to someone who&#39;s little and relatively helpless still - easy to forget just How helpless a 4yo still is! She doesn&#39;t get to forget that, though - and she doesn&#39;t appreciate your forgetting either because that leaves her even more helpless. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Say the kinder thing for your daughter. She&#39;s not ready to manage her big feelings and being polite about others&#39; feelings yet, so help her out - say &quot;woops, I&#39;m sorry, its not what she thought it would be&quot; or words to that effect. Mo&#39;s a veeeeery conservative eater, so I&#39;ve developed some practice at soothing the ruffled feelings of ladies who want to cook for her. It does take some practice not to take the traditional path of &quot;she made it so you have to eat it&quot; but it absolutely makes for warmer relationships over time. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
That might be better for another post - can you lay out some details? When and how does she hit and push? Is she frustrated? Hungry? Need attention? Over enthusiastic and trying to play?<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the specifics, though, it can make a big big difference in your relationship to actively look for things to love about your girl. Every day, several times a day, make a point of thinking about things that are wonderful and amazing about her. It can take practice, if you&#39;ve slipped into defensive mode, I know! With time and practice, you may well come to see these big feelings as one of the amazing parts of her - she&#39;s a vital, sensitive soul who feels things deeply. If you can see her that way more, her falling apart and saying the wrong things will seem more like a bump in the road than a defect. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758785469">I so appreciate the responses, Schuyler and Meredith. I don&#39;t like how I can become so reactive to her and it is true, I need to be more attentive. I feel so fed up at times that all I want to do is sit with my laptop while she and her brother seem to be getting along but it quickly escalates and usually ends in her screaming at him, hitting and then running to a different room and him crying for me. It seems like she is starting to see herself in a negative light and I&#39;m so sad because I know that it coming from how I respond to her lately. Ironically, I am now on the computer seeking the support from you guys when I probably need to be with her...but I&#39;m trying to learn new ways to respond to her to stop damaging our relationship...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am definitely going to post about the sibling issues when I get a chance. Many thanks for sharing your feedback.<br/>
