Yeah.&lt;sheepishly hanging head&gt;.  I could hardly respond. She just went on &<br/>
on.  She&#39;d occasionally ask a question, &quot;So does he (ds) just play video<br/>
games all day?&quot;   or &quot;He&#39;s so smart.  And he won&#39;t even know how to cope<br/>
with real life?&quot; (since I&#39;m not schooling him), blah blah blah.  <br/>

I was in Phoenix with dh, driving to a dance, so once we got there & by the<br/>
door with the music blaring, I said something like &quot;well, we just got to our<br/>
dance workshop, gotta go!&quot; and hung up.  I was on the phone with her last<br/>
week and she didn&#39;t mention it.  She was wondering what our Christmas plans<br/>
were.  As if we&#39;d come to visit!<br/>
