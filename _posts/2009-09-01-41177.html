information and first hand stories about it. Soy milk is not the only<br/>
option. You can also try coconut milk, rice mile, or almond milk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340290618">:)<br/>
Two of my three girls have never had anything other than soymilk, after weening.  The oldest has been drinking soymilk since she was about 2.  They do eat cheese, ice-cream and yogurt.  Non of them have shown any signs of abnormal development.  The oldest is turning 13 in October and has experienced typical puberty.  My middle daughter will be 10 this weekend and is developing at her own pace (possible consitutional growth delay - meaning she&#39;s not growing on the &quot;typical&quot; growth curve, but possibly she got the random short gene that is on both side of the family) and is most likely going to hit puberty later than her sisters have/will, and my youngest is 8 1/2 and is very much on a normal developmental pattern and she has been the biggest soymilk drinker of the three.<br/>
 <br/>
The younger two girls have been vegetarians their entire lives and the oldest since she was 2.  They eat tofu about once a week.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally I&#39;m more concerned about growth hormones in dairy and hormone disrupting chemicals in cosmetics and other products. I haven&#39;t found any first hand evidence of soy causing problems.    <br/>
 <br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379950667">You may want to try raw milk!!  Since it hasn&#39;t been pastuerized (cooked), the enzymes are still in there that allow us to digest the milk.  People who have trouble with pasteurized milk often do very well with raw milk as well as with cultured dairy products such as yogurt and kefir.  Go to the Weston A. Price Foundation for more info!  www.westonaprice.org or www.realmilk.com to find raw milk availability in your state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728256119">The commercial dairy industry is responsible for the hormones and other crap in the milk.  If you find a farmer who grazes his cows (&quot;grass-fed&quot;) and can sell you the raw milk, you will be getting a beneficial product rather than a detrimental one, such as that found in supermarkets. <br/>
<br/>
As for the soy, those cultures who consume soy consume naturally fermented soy such as the tofu you find in the refrigerated section or tempeh, etc.  It&#39;s the processed soy &quot;products&quot; that we have in this country that are damaging.  <br/>

  Two of my three girls have never had anything other than soymilk, after weening.  The oldest has been drinking soymilk since she was about 2.  They do eat cheese, ice-cream and yogurt.  Non of them have shown any signs of abnormal development.  The oldest is turning 13 in October and has experienced typical puberty.  My middle daughter will be 10 this weekend and is developing at her own pace (possible consitutional growth delay - meaning she&#39;s not growing on the &quot;typical&quot; growth curve, but possibly she got the random short gene that is on both side of the family) and is most likely going to hit puberty later than her sisters have/will, and my youngest is 8 1/2 and is very much on a normal developmental pattern and she has been the biggest soymilk drinker of the three.<br/>
   <br/>
  The younger two girls have been vegetarians their entire lives and the oldest since she was 2.  They eat tofu about once a week.<br/>
   <br/>
  Personally I&#39;m more concerned about growth hormones in dairy and hormone disrupting chemicals in cosmetics and other products. I haven&#39;t found any first hand evidence of soy causing problems.    <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps.<br/>

<br/>
My daughter was lactose intolerant from birth (and my son is also).  She used soy milk - Vitasoy is the yummiest we think at least.  She drank it her whole life and she didnt blossom earlier than anyone else in her class/school.  She is now 20 and we&#39;ve seen nothing untoward due to that.<br/>
<br/>
I also am lactose intolerant and I have been drinking soy milk for years, and I havent gone through menopause early - mores the pity ;)<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view Id rather drink a soya bean than a cow anyday ;)<br/>

My son grew up on soy milk, tofu and tempeh.  He&#39;s had no phytoestrogen related problems.   He&#39;s seventeen, healthy, no moobs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Phytoestrogens are present in lots of different foods including nuts, rice, oats, and apples - stuff most of us eat every day.    *All* plants make hormones.  Every plant in your diet contains plant hormones.    <br/>
.  <br/>
I&#39;m not worried about phytoestrogens.  I buy organic soy products because soy is a pretty commonly genetically modified crop.  Some people aren&#39;t worried about that.  All those &quot;Round -up Ready&quot; people. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217429476">Hi Karen,<br/>
I could be wrong, and anyone please feel free to correct or add to my research.  An herbalist, Julie James, spoke out earlier this year at a Pasadena Holistic Moms Network about the dangers of soy.  I know that there is much more to it than estrogens.  It can very well not only effect your hormones, but have possible poor long-term effects on digestion, fertility, and thyroid.  Soy is a very big part of many asian cultures, but they do not consume nearly as much as Americans do.  Americans who consume soy, take in larger amounts of soy than what is considered a healthy intake of soy.  Soy diet for Asians used to consist of the more traditional soys such as tempeh, natto, and miso.  Much has changed since America&#39;s influence of soy processed products.  The traditional soy is much better for your than the processed soys, such as soy ice creams, soy milk and soy cheese. Soy is actually really nasty tasting, they have to add a lot of sugar to give it<br/>
 a pleasant flavor.  The key here is to be selective on the type of soy you consume and to try to avoid it altogether.  I know it&#39;s harder that it sounds.  There is soy in practically everything.  Also you might want the read the book, &quot;The Whole Soy Story&quot; by nutritionist Kaayla Daniel.  Check out Dr. Mercola&#39;s website and type in soy for more information.  If you&#39;re brave I would encourage you to try raw milk.  My ex-boyfriend is lactose intolerant and I got him hooked on it.  The strange thing is when he drinks raw milk he doesn&#39;t get the stomach pain he would get with pasteurized dairy products.  There are many beneficial enzymes and vitamins in raw milk that are killed during pasteurization.  It even has more vitamin C than orange juice.  I don&#39;t work for a raw milk company I just love it and it tastes great.  If you don&#39;t want to try raw milk, the other alternatives would be almond milk or rice milk.  Although those types of milk don&#39;t<br/>
 really have much more nutritional value than cow&#39;s milk.Hope this helps!  <br/>

worth trying but it may not solve your problem with cow milk. I remember<br/>
reading that a large number of people who are lactose intolerant are also<br/>
casein (milk protein) intolerant as well. Our daughter&#39;s diet changed just<br/>
after her 4th birthday. We tried some of the alternative milks (rice, hemp)<br/>
but she wasn&#39;t into them and really many of them don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
nutritional value so we just skipped them. She drinks water (we don&#39;t do<br/>
juice). Calcium she gets from bone broth, veggies, and a supplement if<br/>
needed. <br/>

all some people can take (like me). Soy milk daily (as in one bowl of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028736274">I really appreciate everyone&#39;s input.  I&#39;m gladdened by how much everyone<br/>
&quot;drops what they are doing&quot; and helps.  It&#39;s really nice.  I guess I&#39;m on<br/>
the fence with the soy milk.  That&#39;s all the soy she gets really.  Though we<br/>
do eat veggie burgers every now and again.  I don&#39;t have access to raw milk<br/>
since the USDA is trying to keep tight control on that.  (My husband is<br/>
military and he&#39;s out in 5 more years...we are SO moving to where I can have<br/>
a small family farm!)  anyway, we limit her to 12oz of soy milk a day and<br/>
water all the rest of the time.  We do know juice causes explosive GI<br/>
issues.  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the sugar in it.  She won&#39;t drink almond milk<br/>
(I don&#39;t blame her it&#39;s nasty plus has a lot of sugar in it.)  And I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have coconut in my house because the smell is enough to gag me.  =P<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it was this list where someone said that kids will choose<br/>
foods they are allergic to and prefer them or if I read that somewhere else,<br/>
but I don&#39;t believe that is correct.  Humans are pretty useless when we<br/>
stack our young against the young of other animals, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;d<br/>
have gotten very far as a species if our young actually sought out foods<br/>
that would kill them.  In fact I think the &quot;fussiness&quot; that we see in<br/>
toddlers and little kids is a function of their selectiveness of palate to<br/>
keep them from eating things that are dangerous.  I just can&#39;t go there from<br/>
an evolutionary/anthropological model.<br/>

I *could* limit her access to her soy milk, but then again I don&#39;t limit the<br/>
boys&#39; access to their foods and they could get diabetes from eating too much<br/>
sugar etc...so it seems wrong to me to limit or take away the soy milk that<br/>
she loves because their might be some connection.  And I&#39;ve read the<br/>
studies...and I still want to know who paid for them to be sure of their<br/>
bias.<br/>
<br/>
But I do thank all of you for your help.  I&#39;ll continue to watch her and as<br/>
she gets more language skills etc...she&#39;ll be free to ask for what she&#39;d<br/>
like.  Until then, I suppose I feel like I need to limit her ability to get<br/>
things that give her the explosive issues because she can&#39;t (like the rest<br/>
of the family) say &quot;I know this will make me sick, but I&#39;m willing to deal<br/>
with it for the pleasure of eating this.&quot;  She&#39;s not cognitively there yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

&gt; My daughter is also adopted from China and she is intolerant to dairy and<br/>
&gt; gluten. We tried raw milk for a while before actual testing and although it<br/>
&gt; was better it did not relieve her symptoms. I&#39;m not saying that it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; worth trying but it may not solve your problem with cow milk. I remember<br/>
&gt; reading that a large number of people who are lactose intolerant are also<br/>
&gt; casein (milk protein) intolerant as well. Our daughter&#39;s diet changed just<br/>
&gt; after her 4th birthday. We tried some of the alternative milks (rice, hemp)<br/>
&gt; but she wasn&#39;t into them and really many of them don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
&gt; nutritional value so we just skipped them. She drinks water (we don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; juice). Calcium she gets from bone broth, veggies, and a supplement if<br/>
&gt; needed.<br/>

Not sure which thing you do, limit or not?    If she&#39;s not having problems with soy there&#39;s no reason to assume she&#39;ll have problems with soy.   Stories about other people having problems aren&#39;t an indication that your little girl will.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555357347">Well at this point she&#39;s kind of limited, but it really depends on the day.<br/>
Morgan&#39;s situation is complex and we are trying to heal more than just body<br/>
abuse she suffered.  She can&#39;t ask (well is asking now) for anything (no<br/>
language) but within the last week or so she&#39;s been saying a word for &quot;milk&quot;<br/>
so we&#39;ve let loose with trying to limit it.  Because she now can express a<br/>
preference.  I&#39;m sorry about that confusion.  It&#39;s what I get for posting<br/>
before I have the full cup of coffee.  So to be clear, when she wants a<br/>
drink, and asks for milk, she gets it.  If we are sitting down to a meal, we<br/>
all drink water and she gets water...unless she asks for milk.  But she<br/>
usually wants what we are all having.<br/>

1 diabetes (juvenile), they&#39;re absolutely sure it isn&#39;t sugar. It  <br/>
might be a virus or auto-immune deficiency. Something destroys the  <br/>
insulin producing cells in the pancreas.<br/>
<br/>
Being overweight can trigger Type 2 diabetes in people who are  <br/>
already genetically predisposed to diabetes. But it isn&#39;t sugar  <br/>
that&#39;s causing it. It&#39;s eating too many calories, too little  <br/>
exercise. (And even that isn&#39;t as simple as it sounds.)<br/>
