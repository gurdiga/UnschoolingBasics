 </span></blockquote>***** Awww, thank you, Sandy. I&#39;m glad you were there. I guess I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t mention the struggle Laurie is going through getting comfy <br/>
in grad school, huh? &lt;g&gt;  I spent last weekend with her and she was <br/>
practically in tears with her assignment. I read over what she had <br/>
to do and read a few chapters of complete gobbledy gook (in this one <br/>
class, she has to read 300 pages a week and write a 5-6 page <br/>
summary) and started asking her questions about it. It was <br/>
frustrating for her at first, because I didn&#39;t know enough about the <br/>
topic at hand to ask intelligent questions, but the more I asked and <br/>
the more she answered, it came clear to her what her goal was for <br/>
the paper. Whew! It was all so over my head that I got a headache <br/>
trying to think of questions. lol<br/>
<br/>
She fretted and worried that she can&#39;t be an equal in this classroom <br/>
of 7 other students, most of whom already have a PhD in another <br/>
field. BUT...her unschooling is showing (shining) through already. <br/>
Out of two papers the students have had to turn in, he&#39;s picked her <br/>
paper as &quot;best satisfies what I wanted from everyone.&quot; And it&#39;s not <br/>
that he&#39;s playing favorites. They aren&#39;t allowed to put their names <br/>
on their papers, so he has no idea whose paper he&#39;s liking best. As <br/>
a free-thinker, it&#39;s more natural for her to &quot;please&quot; the professor <br/>
because she&#39;s writing it from her free-thinking perspective; <br/>
something all professors seem to love.<br/>
<br/>
I just talked to her and she&#39;s feeling more confident about her <br/>
choice to get an accelerated PhD. The fear is fading. :-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
