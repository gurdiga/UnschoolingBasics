<div id="ygrps-yiv-970719366">&quot;I&#39;m several<br/>
hours away in East TN. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hey Sam, did you know there&#39;s a TNunschooling list? There&#39;s also one<br/>
for the Tri-Cities just East of you a bit further. I don&#39;t remember<br/>
seeing  you there, but I don&#39;t always remember names on lists very well!:)<br/>
<br/>
I have this goal to turn the Tri-Cities area into an unschooling RICH<br/>
place.  I just found out last night that an RU family relocating from<br/>
New Orleans is moving here. Once they get settled, there&#39;s the chance<br/>
that 1-2 other unschooling families from their area will come.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on my sis and another friend from P&#39;cola that say they&#39;re<br/>
coming as soon as possible! AND another friend that used to live in<br/>
P&#39;cola and is in SC right now is thinking about this area.<br/>
So......it&#39;s happening!! Tri-Cities TN is the place to be folks.:)<br/>
