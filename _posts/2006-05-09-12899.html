<div id="ygrps-yiv-702084251">Hi everyone. I am running into a situation right now. My husband is a <br/>
roofer.  And, this week he is all alone. Well he took our 10 year old <br/>
son with him for this job.  Our son is LOVING it and learning a lot. <br/>
The problem is I have family who is questioning me on this. And, I am <br/>
so frustrated with them right now I can not think of something good to <br/>
say back to them. I am getting questions like...well why is he doing <br/>
this on a school day? What can he be learning? Etc.. mind you they are <br/>
being really rude with their comments too. If you can think of anything <br/>
please let me know. Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892640180">If family is being rude about it I would guess that no answer you give them<br/>
is going to be satisfactory. It&#39;s a waste of time to try to make them see<br/>
what they are not willing to see. It doesn&#39;t seem that they are asking<br/>
because they really want to understand. I would answer with a generic<br/>
response accompanied by a big smile. (I do this all the time with my<br/>
in-laws.) &quot;We are very pleased with what he has learned this week.&quot; Or just<br/>
lie. &quot;He has been keeping up with his regular lessons in the evening.&quot; Or &quot;I<br/>
hear ya. We&#39;ll really have to cram next week to make up for this week, but<br/>
the quality time he&#39;s spending with his dad is worth it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The truth will always be beyond their reach if this continues to be their<br/>
attitude.  Tell them what they want to hear then everyone is happy.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone. I am running into a situation right now. My husband is a<br/>
&gt; roofer.  And, this week he is all alone. Well he took our 10 year old<br/>
&gt; son with him for this job.  Our son is LOVING it and learning a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Change your attitude.  I&#39;m not saying this in a rude way, but when people<br/>
ask or question be positive and optimistic!  For instance if they ask where<br/>
your son is say, &quot;! (How I wish we had ! and ? at the beginning of sentences<br/>
like the Spanish) Oh he went with his father this week to help him with some<br/>
roofing jobs!  He is just so excited and this is such a wonderful<br/>
opportunity for him.  If he were in school he would never have the chance to<br/>
learn all the things that he is this week.  It&#39;s almost like an<br/>
apprenticeship if you think abou it!!&quot;  And smile and look happy about him<br/>
having this opportunity.  It&#39;s one of the things I learned being a LLL<br/>
Leader.  If people ask you stupid questions like, &quot;Is he sleeping through<br/>
the night?&quot; you simply repy (with a huge smile and try your best to look<br/>
rested LOL!) &quot;We are sleeping just beautifully!  I love to watch his little<br/>
face at night as he curls up and slumbers!&quot; You don&#39;t tell them that he is<br/>
curling up to slumber 10 times a night :-D<br/>
<br/>
well why is he doing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this on a school day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His school is his LIFE!  He IS learning things.  And who says that Monday<br/>
through Friday is a &quot;school day&quot;  Do public school children learn NOTHING on<br/>
the weekends?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What can he be learning? Etc.. mind you they are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being really rude with their comments too. If you can think of anything<br/>
&gt; please let me know. Thank you<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What can he be learning?  A career.  Not that he will necessarily pursue it<br/>
as a career, but he is learning about a career choice.  He is learning about<br/>
angles, measurements, layout, design, safety, putting in a hard day&#39;s work,<br/>
gaining pride in a job well done, satisfying a curiousity, further<br/>
developing his relationship with his father!  OMG if all our children could<br/>
have that opportunity!<br/>
<br/>
Dan periodically takes Emily to work with him (he&#39;s a computer network<br/>
engineer and programmer.)  Seems like everytime he does he manages to find a<br/>
way to put her to work. Something blows up or they get an emergency where<br/>
they need 100 laptops out the door for adjustors so he has her configuring<br/>
the laptops and doing inventory checks.  When he first started doing this he<br/>
was questioned all the time.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t she be at home studying or<br/>
something?&quot;  Now they love it when she comes in because she knows what she<br/>
is doing, can be trusted with a task, and can actually communicate problems<br/>
and suggest solutions to resolve them.  All this at 13 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn&#39;t spell check this, my 1 yr old is needing me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1yo&#39;s always outrank spell check :)  Remember as I always say, &quot;The only<br/>
person that you need to be accountable to about your children&#39;s education is<br/>
your children.&quot;  Your family probably already thinks you are crazed for even<br/>
wanting to homeschool, so it may or may not help to say anything positive,<br/>
but just keep repeating yourself like a broken record.  Another good<br/>
communication tool is to use lots of feeling words. Like you can say, &quot;You<br/>
are surprised that I would let my son go learn a skill with his father.&quot;<br/>
Bwahahahahahahahaha!<br/>

remember what a wonderful experience it was, not what he learned.  What he<br/>
learned will just get absorbed into who he is. What he gets from being with<br/>
his father is going to be one of those impressionable moments that he will<br/>
look upon fondly!  When he&#39;s an old man he will say something like, &quot;I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698541900">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is that its best to thank your inquisitive family and assure them <br/>
that you appreciate their concerns and enthusiastically state that you know <br/>
are doing what&#39;s best for your kids.  If they sense any apprehension on your <br/>
part they will continue to try to persuade you to do it their way.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
try to sell them on the idea that spending the day at work with Dad is better <br/>
than sitting at a desk writing spelling words 10 times.  They will probably <br/>
never understand the truth and it will open up a door for them to continue to <br/>
question your methods.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t the bean dip idea from this loop?  After reminding your family that <br/>
you are taking care of your child&#39;s education offer them some bean dip.  If they <br/>
continue with questioning repeat that you have your son&#39;s education under <br/>
control and that there is no need to worry and offer the bean dip again.  If it <br/>
continues, stand your ground, reassure them and offer the bean dip again.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and good luck fending off the doubters.  They may understand eventually <br/>
as they watch your children thrive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995465106">Hello,<br/>
I am new to unschooling and the group but I have been lurking and reading the emails for awhile.  Before I came home with my three children I was a recreation therapist for 15 years and what I know is that people do not give much credit to what they don&#39;t know or to the everyday things or leisure activites they do for learning purposes.  It is when those things are taken away that they see the value.  Instead of giving family or others answers about what our children are learning I often ask them what they learned from the same actiivity. I know that my children learn conflict resoluiton from play from picking teams or sharing on the playground.  I also believe that the people questioning me are doing so that I am able to see the positives of uncschoioling and help me remeber why I do what I do for my children  even when I doubt are they learning enough.  <br/>

If family is being rude about it I would guess that no answer you give them<br/>
is going to be satisfactory. It&#39;s a waste of time to try to make them see<br/>
what they are not willing to see. It doesn&#39;t seem that they are asking<br/>
because they really want to understand. I would answer with a generic<br/>
response accompanied by a big smile. (I do this all the time with my<br/>
in-laws.) &quot;We are very pleased with what he has learned this week.&quot; Or just<br/>
lie. &quot;He has been keeping up with his regular lessons in the evening.&quot; Or &quot;I<br/>
hear ya. We&#39;ll really have to cram next week to make up for this week, but<br/>
the quality time he&#39;s spending with his dad is worth it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The truth will always be beyond their reach if this continues to be their<br/>
attitude.  Tell them what they want to hear then everyone is happy.<br/>

Hi everyone. I am running into a situation right now. My husband is a <br/>
roofer.  And, this week he is all alone. Well he took our 10 year old <br/>
son with him for this job.  Our son is LOVING it and learning a lot. <br/>
The problem is I have family who is questioning me on this. And, I am <br/>
so frustrated with them right now I can not think of something good to <br/>
say back to them. I am getting questions like...well why is he doing <br/>
this on a school day? What can he be learning? Etc.. mind you they are <br/>
being really rude with their comments too. If you can think of anything <br/>
please let me know. Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn&#39;t spell check this, my 1 yr old is needing me.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t do that, lol, maybe others can but it&#39;s not in me to just say<br/>
something to appease my friends and family when it comes to<br/>
unschooling.  It&#39;d feel to much like lying, I don&#39;t have lessons<br/>
planned for my kids, they aren&#39;t going to have to cram.  If my family<br/>
or any friends or my husbands family, attacks me for how we<br/>
homeschool...tough shit.  I&#39;ll give a small sample of why we unschool<br/>
and how freaking AWESOME unschooling is and unless they are willing to<br/>
read books or even just TRY to understand, the subject will end.   I<br/>
was worried earlier this month about our trip but I&#39;m not anymore, I<br/>
feel so empowered.  I don&#39;t have to be nasty but I can be firm.<br/>
<br/>
I had a VERY positive unschooling moment today.  Zachary *wanted* to<br/>
do the PRE-GED (couple weeks ago) and he was doing damn good learning<br/>
on his own, if he had a question he asked.  That proves that he is<br/>
self motivated and capable of learning things at &quot;higher levels&quot;.  A<br/>
child doesn&#39;t need 12 years of an education to prepare for an SAT<br/>
should Zak want to go college...he only *needs* prep study guides and<br/>
prep tests..that is it.  He has a love of higher maths, say he just<br/>
solely looks at math/physics for the next several years, he can CLEP<br/>
out of having to take math in college.  If he wants it bad enough<br/>
he&#39;ll do it.  Everyday, both of my children learn something, that<br/>
PROVES that they are capable of learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I WILL MISS ALL OF YOU!!!  See you in about 17-20 days!<br/>

Hello,<br/>
I am new to unschooling and the group but I have been lurking and reading<br/>
the emails for awhile.  Before I came home with my three children I was a<br/>
recreation therapist for 15 years and what I know is that people do not give<br/>
much credit to what they don&#39;t know or to the everyday things or leisure<br/>
activites they do for learning purposes.  It is when those things are taken<br/>
away that they see the value.  Instead of giving family or others answers<br/>
about what our children are learning I often ask them what they learned from<br/>
the same actiivity. I know that my children learn conflict resoluiton from<br/>
play from picking teams or sharing on the playground.  I also believe that<br/>
the people questioning me are doing so that I am able to see the positives<br/>
of uncschoioling and help me remeber why I do what I do for my children <br/>
even when I doubt are they learning enough.<br/>
 <br/>

If family is being rude about it I would guess that no answer you give them<br/>
is going to be satisfactory. It&#39;s a waste of time to try to make them see<br/>
what they are not willing to see. It doesn&#39;t seem that they are asking<br/>
because they really want to understand. I would answer with a generic<br/>
response accompanied by a big smile. (I do this all the time with my<br/>
in-laws.) &quot;We are very pleased with what he has learned this week.&quot; Or just<br/>
lie. &quot;He has been keeping up with his regular lessons in the evening.&quot; Or &quot;I<br/>
hear ya. We&#39;ll really have to cram next week to make up for this week, but<br/>
the quality time he&#39;s spending with his dad is worth it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The truth will always be beyond their reach if this continues to be their<br/>
attitude.  Tell them what they want to hear then everyone is happy.<br/>

Hi everyone. I am running into a situation right now. My husband is a<br/>
roofer.  And, this week he is all alone. Well he took our 10 year old<br/>
son with him for this job.  Our son is LOVING it and learning a lot.<br/>
The problem is I have family who is questioning me on this. And, I am<br/>
so frustrated with them right now I can not think of something good to<br/>
say back to them. I am getting questions like...well why is he doing<br/>
this on a school day? What can he be learning? Etc.. mind you they are<br/>
being really rude with their comments too. If you can think of anything<br/>
please let me know. Thank you<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry I didn&#39;t spell check this, my 1 yr old is needing me.<br/>
 <br/>
