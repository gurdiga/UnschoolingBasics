<div id="ygrps-yiv-934499959">I just laughed so hard at this one and there is a good reason.  Yes, Sorscha<br/>
is our daughter and no...we are completely not offended. Why<br/>
laughing?......Sorscha always informs us that she is not human but an<br/>
animal.  You must have been getting the vibe!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the advise on the VIDEO thing.  I guess that we just miss<br/>
her....I figured that one out today.  We miss reading with her, bike riding<br/>
with her, and just being with her.  It&#39;s not that she is sitting and playing<br/>
the games (yes, the exercise thing bugs us), it&#39;s that the games now come<br/>
before us.  Oh my gosh....we&#39;re jealous!  Whoa...I having to pause at that<br/>
thought.  Wow, we&#39;re jealous.  Hmmm, how do we move on from that<br/>
realization.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930437486">Whatever you do, don&#39;t take away the gaming now because then you&#39;ll lose her<br/>
trust more and have to start over again if you ever decide to give her that<br/>
freedom again.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a relative who felt that her kids would never stop watching tv if<br/>
they had any good channels.  I tried to assure her that it would ease up<br/>
with time and freedom.  They got satellite TV for the kids and let them<br/>
watch.  One of them was still watching more than she was comfortable with<br/>
after 6 months and they removed the satellite.  I tried to tell her that he<br/>
felt it would eventually be limited again (they had gone back and forth with<br/>
limits several times) and therefore he was watching all he could while it<br/>
was available.  I only thought they would limit it, not get rid of the<br/>
satellite.  He was right to watch it as much as he could because in the end<br/>
they did take it away.<br/>
<br/>
Without bringing the gaming into it, you could still let your dd know you<br/>
miss interacting with her and offer for her to join you in something you<br/>
both will enjoy.  I love playing board games and often when the kids have<br/>
been busy for long stretch without me, I will get something out and see if<br/>
anyone wants to join me.  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.<br/>

<br/>
Two years ago when we first discovered unschooling, Logan (now 12) played  <br/>
video games almost every day for several months.  It absolutely drove me  crazy. <br/>
 I initially used that time to read on the unschooling boards and  lists and <br/>
gradually I started to relax.<br/>
 <br/>
Logan and I both had had to recover from all those rules I had  arbitrarily <br/>
imposed.  I now shudder to say that one of them was Only One  Hour of Video <br/>
Games a Day!   <br/>
 <br/>
I also missed my time with him playing board games and doing puzzles and  <br/>
going for walks.<br/>
Two things were my answer to this and I recommend them both.  I  started <br/>
following my own passions AND  I learned to play video games.   We bought a Game <br/>
Cube and I discovered Donkey Konga and Animal Crossing and I  was hooked.<br/>
 <br/>
Now , Logan occasionally plays video games but prefers going out  geocaching, <br/>
 hiking to look for rocks or working on robotics  creations.  We left our <br/>
Game Cube in Florida with his cousin when we  moved to New Mexico last month and <br/>
I&#39;m the one who misses it the most  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
As for exercising, both Donkey Konga and the Eye Toy games for Game Cube  <br/>
involve moving around while you&#39;re playing. There are also the games  involving <br/>
dancing (DDR?) which she might enjoy.<br/>
 <br/>
Joining her sometimes with the video games as well as exploring and  <br/>
developing your own interests should help you with your unschooling  journey.<br/>

I&#39;m SO glad I didn&#39;t offend you and that you got a good laugh out of <br/>
it!  I love her name!   My dd loves animals too and want to do <br/>
something involving them for her life&#39;s work someday.<br/>
