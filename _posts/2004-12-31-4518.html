<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744255238">Hi.Kelly, I didnt intend to upset you if thats what I did.Well if you <br/>
want books and article names- good luck-I have read different things <br/>
on various web pages through the years and I didnt keep records of <br/>
who said what(sorry).I will tell you that I am sincere.I do think <br/>
there are a lot of children(like you said) who would love an <br/>
unschooling life but I think some children do prefer more structure.I <br/>
was pretty much unschooled(when not in school) because I was alone to <br/>
do what I please.I would have loved some one to tell me its time to <br/>
come in or you need to clean your room ect(I know you think I am <br/>
crazy)but a lot of time my mother was not as strict as other parents <br/>
and it made me feel as though she didnt care as much as she could-but <br/>
thats just me:)<br/>
As you said you like lists so I will try-<br/>
Cons-no structure,no help.No money for the music lesson or space camp <br/>
the child wants.Not being able to run to the library when one wants <br/>
to learn about something(several babies).Being scared your kid will <br/>
grow up and wont know what state he lives in or just basic things- <br/>
cause all he ever wanted to do was watch spongebob and play in the <br/>
hot tub:)Lack of ideas (and money)for fun projects.Lack of fieldtrips <br/>
which is very important in unschooling,being afraid your child wont <br/>
know enough to even pass the GED exam and get a good job-to name a <br/>
few.But this is just me,I am sure they dont apply to a lot of people.<br/>
Pros-Fun,freedom,not having to listen to what others say about what <br/>
your child should be doing,learning, or playing.Not being tied down <br/>
with a curriculum.Lack of work for the parent as far as preparing a <br/>
lesson everyday goes and freedom to just live and be happy - to name <br/>
a few:)<br/>
I hope you dont get to upset from this-I really want to do this but <br/>
there are those few nagging doubts that keep me up and wont let me <br/>
rest.<br/>

Hi.Kelly, I didnt intend to upset you if thats what I  did.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You didn&#39;t upset me. I do this daily! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

who said  what(sorry)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve been reading sites that are anti-unschooling-----and from what you  <br/>
write below, you&#39;ve received all your unschooling information from people who  <br/>
have no idea what it is.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I will tell you that I am sincere.I do think  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>there are a lot of children(like you said) who would love an  <br/>
unschooling life but I think some children do prefer more  structure.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Many adults crave structure. And so they should be in prison? or the  <br/>
military? There&#39;s a way to provide structure without running the child&#39;s life  for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was pretty much unschooled(when not in school)  because I was alone to <br/>

 <br/>
You weren&#39;t unschooled in any way, shape, or form. You were neglected. And  <br/>
you may have bought into the societal &quot;if you love them, you MUST have  <br/>
limits/structure/discipline.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As you said you like lists so I will  try-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cons-no structure,no help&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No help? Have you been reading ANTI-unschooling sites ONLY? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No money for the music lesson or space camp  <br/>
the child wants.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And school or school-at-home would fix these situations.....how?<br/>
 <br/>
No money is no money. Unschooling has nothing to do with that.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not being able to run to the library when one  wants <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to learn about something(several  babies).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Bookmobile. Friends. The INTERNET. You&#39;re here now, learning about  <br/>
unschooling. No library in sight! It&#39;s the best library EVER! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Being scared your kid will <br/>

cause all he ever wanted  to do was watch spongebob and play in the <br/>
hot  tub:)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
And he wouldn&#39;t know the name of his state.....why?  My eight year old  knows <br/>
when we cross state lines because we honk our horn as we cross the line.  <br/>
Basic things----like how to change the tv channels and wash his face? What&#39;s a  <br/>
&quot;basic thing&quot; to you? His name? Address? Phone number? How to read? write? jump <br/>
 rope?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lack of ideas (and money)for fun  projects.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Money doesn&#39;t necessarily equal fun. <br/>
 <br/>
And THIS bunch is a wealth of ideas! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lack of fieldtrips which is very important in  unschooling,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh? Our local group scheduled a &quot;field trip&quot; to Bi-Lo a few years  ago----we <br/>
go there 4-5 times/week! What kind of field trip was THAT? Yes, going  and <br/>
doing IS important in unschooling. But it&#39;s called just going somewhere!  <br/>
There&#39;s PLENTY of free stuff out there! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being afraid your child wont <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know  enough to even pass the GED exam and get a good job-to name a  <br/>

 <br/>
And if he were to go to school or school-at-home, this is a gimme?  <br/>
Guaranteed? Really?<br/>
 <br/>
Can you define success for us----in *your* mind?<br/>
 <br/>
You have a GED, right? And you&#39;re still so unsure about learning.....  Better <br/>
to have a good grasp of what learning *really IS than a piece of paper.  And <br/>
many unschoolers go to college without a GED.<br/>

 <br/>
Well,  you&#39;re bound to be disappointed with THIS! &lt;bwg&gt; MANY  people will <br/>
have LOTS to say about what he&#39;s doing! LOL It&#39;s up to you to tune  it out!<br/>

 <br/>
Lack of work as a parent----with regards to a curriculum, yes. But you&#39;ll  <br/>
have MUCH more work making a learning-rich environment for your child. It&#39;s  <br/>
intense----and relaxed. It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s NOTHING you can imagine  <br/>
at this time.<br/>

 <br/>
_www.unschooling.com/messages_ (http://www.unschooling.com/messages)    Read <br/>
archives, NOT what was just posted yesterday. Pick out threads under topics  <br/>
you&#39;re interested in. Read the GOOD stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
I have to wonder why in the world you&#39;re so interested in unschooling when  <br/>
you think so negatively about it.<br/>

This list is a great place for calming those irrational fears.<br/>
<br/>
Lack of fieldtrips<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which is very important in unschooling<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, I don&#39;t really love the term &quot;field trip.&quot;  In our <br/>
family we do a lot of interesting things and go to a lot of <br/>
interesting places just as a part of life.  Having such experiences <br/>
beyond the walls of our home is important IMO whether unschooling or <br/>
not.  I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a &quot;con&quot; for unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839415083">[Cons-no structure,no help.]<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants structure . . . give them structure.  Uninvited <br/>
&quot;arbitrary&quot; structure is the no-no here.  Does that make more sense?<br/>
<br/>
[No money for the music lesson or space camp the child wants.]<br/>
<br/>
Does your local school district fund trips to space camp?!?  Wow!  ;)  <br/>
Children to attend Space Camp raise their money the same way whether <br/>
they attend school, are school-at-homed or unschooled.  Donations, bake <br/>
sales, auction fundraisers, scholarships, etc.  If there&#39;s a will <br/>
there&#39;s (usually) a way.  :)<br/>
<br/>
[Not being able to run to the library when one wants to learn about<br/>
something(several babies).]<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just &quot;life&quot;; not unschooling.  You&#39;d still have a baby on your <br/>
hip while running errands even if the other children were in school.  <br/>
See if your local library is linked up online so that you can browse <br/>
their catalog and the libraries that they&#39;re hooked up with.  Then you <br/>
can place your &quot;order&quot; for books that you want to check out and they&#39;ll <br/>
be waiting at the desk for you.<br/>
<br/>
[Being scared your kid will grow up and wont know what state he lives<br/>
in or just basic things-cause all he ever wanted to do was watch <br/>
spongebob<br/>
and play in the hot tub]<br/>
<br/>
Why would your child not know what state you live in???  Go check out <br/>
this collection of fallacies related to this kind of &quot;if I let him, he <br/>
would never ....&quot; thinking.  Changing your mindset can change <br/>
everything.  :)<br/>

<br/>
[Lack of ideas (and money)for fun projects.]<br/>
<br/>
Lots of ideas here and on other lists and web sites.  Money sure can <br/>
help, but it doesn&#39;t cost you anything to tour a bakery, visit a park, <br/>
go for a walk in the woods, go pet puppies at a pet shop, and stuff <br/>
like that (other than gas for the car or bus fare).<br/>
<br/>
[Lack of fieldtrips which is very important in unschooling]<br/>
<br/>
We, personally, don&#39;t care much for big &#39;organized&#39; field trips.  Too <br/>
many people, too much hurry-hurry-hurry to try and see it all in 2 <br/>
hours.  We much prefer to go on our own and follow our own interests -- <br/>
invite along a friend or another laid back family if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
[being afraid your child wont know enough to even pass the GED exam<br/>
and get a good job-to name a few.]<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not likely to be an issue (GED).  What is a &quot;good job&quot; anyway?  <br/>
Do you mean one that pays the bills, but that you loathe?  Or a job <br/>
that&#39;s OK, but is uninspiring and mindnumbingly dull.  Or a job that <br/>
you absolutely love, but might need to live frugally and not have all <br/>
the latest gadgets and trendy fashions?  How do you define success?  <br/>
Better yet, how does child(ren) define it?<br/>
<br/>
Just some things to think about.  :)<br/>
