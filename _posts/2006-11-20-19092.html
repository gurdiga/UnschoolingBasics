We have not found that to be true in our home and lives.  It does mean  being <br/>

<br/>
But see, that sounds like rhetoric to me. Meeting underlying needs is<br/>
great, but you still aren&#39;t getting exactly what you want initially. I<br/>
still want a dog, but I don&#39;t have one. <br/>
<br/>
My love for Markus is greater than my need for a greyhound. So<br/>
everything in my life is exactly what I choose. But that involves<br/>
compromise of some things we&#39;d like. Dh would like our house to be<br/>
spotless....he realizes that the other family members have different<br/>
ideas so he meets that need in some creative ways, none of which<br/>
involve having our home be ultra-tidy or nattering at the other people<br/>
living here.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of SO many day to day solutions we&#39;ve come up with that<br/>
work great, but involve a bit of &quot;giving up&quot;......again, not a<br/>
negative thing to us. I see giving to and for others something that is<br/>
healthy when done for the right reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I also think parents SHOULD give up some of their own needs in order<br/>
to meet the needs of their child. That&#39;s part of being a parent. My<br/>
very real NEED for sleep is not as important as a babies need to<br/>
nurse. I see it as giving my child what they need, my CHOICE and yet I<br/>
ignore my biological need for sleep to do that. <br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. Service done out of a sense of duty or because a person<br/>
feels they have no choice isn&#39;t service at all. True giving comes from<br/>
the heart. That&#39;s why I think negotiation and compromise are useful<br/>
tools though. It give us all a chance to figure out what is really<br/>
important in the moment and how to eventually get what we want.......<br/>

The difference is what is it *you* really want? *What* does Markus <br/>
*really* want?<br/>
<br/>
Markus doesn&#39;t want hair? Responsibility? Another mouth to feed? <br/>
Licking? Scooping poop? WHAT is the issue?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really want a dog? A smaller dog? A furry thing? Sometihng to <br/>

No one is compromising. He&#39;s not giving even a little. You don&#39;t even <br/>
have a cat. Nothing is getting done at all.<br/>

<br/>
Knowing *what* bothers him is the first step towards consent. My piles <br/>
bother Ben. If things are put away, he can deal with dirt. The house <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be spotless: as long as I can tidy up and not make more <br/>
piles, I&#39;m meeting his needs.<br/>

Maybe if you were to change your vocabulary---just as we tell newbies <br/>
to unschooling to do! Change your words *first*. Then your mindset and <br/>
intent change as you go with the better understanding of words.<br/>

I think you need to be old enough to actually *consent*---or your <br/>
caregiver needs to act in your behalf. &lt;g&gt; As the parent, that&#39;s part <br/>
of your job---to act as your child&#39;s &quot;consentor.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

compromise by choice in your family. I don&#39;t agree that parents<br/>
&quot;should give up some of their own needs in order to meet the needs of<br/>
their children&quot;. I don&#39;t believe it is necessary. I do trust that<br/>
there are solutions which don&#39;t involve coercion or compromise that<br/>
meet the needs of all members of a family. We&#39;d love to trouble shoot<br/>
with you on the CL group, if you&#39;d like. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Pam, the key is being committed to finding solutions that<br/>
meet the underlying needs of everyone. Is &quot;getting exactly what you<br/>
want initially&quot; the priority? From my experience, if all needs are<br/>
met, the initial strategy becomes obsolete.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662491042">~~I agree with Pam, the key is being committed to finding solutions that<br/>
meet the underlying needs of everyone. ~~<br/>
<br/>
Again, give me a good solution to having your sleep needs met with<br/>
three older children that need you and a baby that nurses at night?<br/>
Ignoring the baby is not an option, napping when you have an intense<br/>
child that does not nap is not an option and when that child is going<br/>
through a phase that they need to nurse every two hours. There are<br/>
times that the babies needs ARE more important. If a person isn&#39;t<br/>
ready to deal with that reality, I don&#39;t see how they&#39;ll make a good<br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t my reality any longer, but it was for quite a while....I<br/>
can live without enough sleep for periods of time in order to make<br/>
sure my child is safe and getting breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
We just had a very long discussion over at AU about not allowing a<br/>
small child to hurt animals. I don&#39;t think the child was consenting to<br/>
being gentle...some things are not acceptable, mainly where safety is<br/>
concerned. If Jalen wants to throw a rat up and down I need to stop<br/>
that. As much as we can discuss alternatives and underlying needs,<br/>
sometimes his desire collides with another beings need for safety.<br/>

this, but feel compelled. *g*)<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a huge difference, imo, between saying that something <br/>
extreme needs to stop in the moment and bypassing the problem solving <br/>
strategies by which everyone&#39;s needs may be met.<br/>
<br/>
Even in that discussion, there was a whole lot of brainstorming that <br/>
went on as to how mom could keep the animals safe *and* meet the child&#39;s <br/>
need, which may have been for play, for attention, for space, for time <br/>
to learn and develop, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that stepping in and stopping something immediate <br/>
precludes the possibility of finding a win/ win solution.<br/>
<br/>
As I was writing that, I thought to myself that maybe I should stop <br/>
short of saying living consensually because stopping something <br/>
mid-action isn&#39;t always &quot;consensual&quot; within the moment, even if it may <br/>
have been a negotiated solutions outside of the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s where I see where Ren&#39;s coming from, but also see the <br/>
point that compromise doesn&#39;t need to be part of a consensual lexicon.<br/>

That&#39;s EXACTLY what I&#39;m trying to say. Just because I DO step in at<br/>
the moment, does not mean the process is thrwarted or bypassed. That&#39;s<br/>
what I&quot;m trying to say (not as eloquently) when I say the need isn&#39;t<br/>
getting met in the MOMENT but it is being met long term.<br/>
<br/>
In the moment, sometimes a very fast response is needed by a person<br/>
with the ability to keep members safe.  That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t sit<br/>
down with both victim and attacker to discuss what we can do<br/>
differently, what each person&#39;s needs are and truly listen to their<br/>
frustration and/or feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the immediate action is NOT consensual at all...but the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But even this I find myself wanting to tweak and continue to dialog over...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the midst of figuring out for myself some very difficult, nuancy <br/>
philosophical issues. One of which (and I can hear Pat typing away <br/>
furiously with the whole victim/ attacker duality) is the whole blame/ <br/>
fault paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself drawn to RU, C-L, TCS ideas precisely because of my <br/>
thoughts about rights, justice, equity, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the more I think about connection and relationship paradigms, the <br/>
more I see that this way of thinking is a roadblock to trust, <br/>
partnership, connection, relationship thinking. Rights, justice, equity <br/>
fall by the wayside in consensual thinking.<br/>
<br/>
More and more I&#39;ve been thinking about my own phrasing (and that of <br/>
other RU-ers as well)--everyone has a &quot;right&quot; to be safe in their home. <br/>
Well, yeah. That&#39;s not really something I&#39;m going to dispute or <br/>
repudiate. But there comes a point where I can see that phraseology <br/>
working in much the same way as loaded political polls, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
While I wouldn&#39;t check a &quot;no&quot; box to the question &quot;everyone has a right <br/>
to live safely in his/ her own home,&quot; I can see how the focus on that <br/>
question can preclude all kinds of solutions that might be mutually <br/>
agreeable.<br/>
<br/>
Am I ready to give up the thought of &quot;rights&quot; altogether? No way. Not <br/>
yet, anyway. But, I&#39;m continually evolving and changing. (Hey Kelly! Did <br/>
I just figure out my talk topic? Maybe so!)<br/>
<br/>
What I can see is that if someone who carries cultural authority, as a <br/>
parent does, is exclusively focused on the issue of &quot;rights&quot; to the <br/>
exclusion of a focus on problem solving, then the whole <br/>
consensual-living paradigm is thwarted before it even gets going.<br/>

<br/>
Pat: <br/>
I agree that addressing the underlying needs of both parties is the<br/>
goal. However, in my experience when we create a sense of entitlement<br/>
of &quot;rights&quot;, then individuals vie for the &quot;more important&quot;, or<br/>
priority &quot;right&quot;. The focus on &quot;rights&quot; creates an obstacle to sharing<br/>
a *common goal*. <br/>
<br/>
The discussion becomes &quot;I have a right&quot; and &quot;he violated my rights&quot;.<br/>
There becomes an either/or quality to the interaction, rather than<br/>
spending energy on &#39;my needs are xyz and your needs are abc, how can<br/>
we solve for both?&#39; Most conflicts do seem to escalate when one person<br/>
isn&#39;t hearing another person&#39;s needs, and then the unheard person<br/>
&#39;takes matters into his own hands&#39;, as it were. The construct of &#39;I<br/>
have a right to xyz&#39;, seems to encourage &#39;enforcing my right&#39;, often<br/>
in a physical manner. Or, the parent may &#39;protect the child&#39;s rights&#39;.<br/>
None of these represent the &#39;working together&#39; paradigm of a common<br/>
goal of all the needs being addressed. It seems derailed at figuring<br/>
out who is in the &quot;right&quot;, and who is in the &quot;wrong&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If instead, we state our needs/wants/desires (rather than our<br/>
entitlement) for xyz, the other person doesn&#39;t need to *defend* his<br/>
&quot;right&quot; to xyz. To me it just seems more steamline to discuss needs,<br/>
rather than get in a debate about whose &quot;right&quot; is more important. For<br/>
instance, if ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS sits in, dh<br/>
could claim &quot;I have a right to sit in MY chair&quot;. Then ds is left to<br/>
DEFEND, or GIVE UP, what he has. Or else...what? Dh must enforce his<br/>
&quot;right&quot;, or give up his &quot;rights&quot; to the chair? If dh were to state, &#39;I<br/>
need someplace to sit&#39;; and ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS<br/>
sits in, there are many solutions to the dilemma which don&#39;t involve<br/>
enforcing a sense of entitlement. Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>
accessing the multitude of solutions?<br/>
<br/>
In the event of one person hitting another, I have found it more<br/>
effective to Facilitate Safety by removing the injured person; and<br/>
model empathy for the feelings and needs of the injured person, while<br/>
also validating the feelings and needs of the angry person. In the<br/>
heat of the moment, it is A LOT to do! But, it is easier, in my<br/>
experience to remove the injured party than to remove the angry party.<br/>
And in my opinion, it is much easier to discuss underlying needs, than<br/>
to debate &quot;rights&quot; in the heat of the angry moment! Even very young<br/>
children can identify with core feelings and needs, as those are not<br/>
in dispute. It is often an &quot;infrigement&quot; on perceived &quot;rights&quot; that<br/>
precipitates conflict, ime. But, we have the choice to focus on<br/>
&quot;rights&quot;, or not, in our home. We choose to focus on feelings and<br/>
needs instead. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard ds say, nor he heard us say, &#39;I have a right to abc&#39;.<br/>
He is very quick to articulate his needs, and we ours; and then we all<br/>
are trouble shooting together to create a solution which encompasses<br/>
all needs. He is amazingly adept at it because he trusts that his<br/>
needs will be addressed, and just suggests alternatives which also<br/>
address our needs. We do the same thing; and generally, it is very<br/>
quick that we find a solution which is preferable to everyone. No one<br/>
is spending time defending their needs or qualifying or justifying<br/>
their needs as &quot;more important&quot;. It is so, so much easier to reach<br/>
agreement when everyone is working toward the same goal: everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs are addressed.<br/>

Pat:<br/>
Deb, I know you are joking here, but this IS how conflicts escalate<br/>
within a blame/fault paradigm from my experience. One person stakes a<br/>
claim, and another either is blamed, or must *give in*. In our family,<br/>
we&#39;d rather focus on feelings and needs and work to address those as a<br/>
team; not as a competition for whose &quot;rights&quot; are &quot;more important&quot; and<br/>
who is at fault for breaching them.<br/>

<br/>
Not always possible. Works great if the angry party isn&#39;t angry enough<br/>
to start breaking things, chasing down the injured party AND the<br/>
parent to create more harm, smashing doors, walls etc....<br/>
<br/>
Jalen is slowly getting more and more tools so this isn&#39;t a very<br/>
common scenario any longer, but there are times that removing him is<br/>
the ONLY option. Especially in a room full of friends and family that<br/>
have a RIGHT (yes, I believe in rights) to peace and safety and<br/>
unbroken eardrums.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560699010">***in Consensual Living, the focus in on feelings and needs, rather<br/>
than &quot;rights&quot;; and on creating solutions when conflicts arise, that<br/>
address the underlying needs, rather than enforcing &quot;rights&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see rights as things that need enforcing within our family.  We&#39;re <br/>
all concerned with living well together.   There&#39;s no denial of rights. <br/>
There&#39;s no enforcement of rights.   As parents and the big people with power <br/>
we deliberately talked about rights because we were parenting differently <br/>
than almost all other parents Dylan knew.   When Dylan wondered why some <br/>
parents took away a kid&#39;s X box, we talked about the ideas that allow some <br/>
people to comfortably control and coerce others.   There was no <br/>
establishment of rights within our home as an establishment of rights within <br/>
a system of government.  The rights always were.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in a family with lots of kid things are different but I&#39;m thinking <br/>
back to the days when we&#39;d get our nieces and nephews for three months in <br/>
the summer.   We went from a house with one kid to a house with six kids. <br/>
We got along well because everyone knew their needs would be addressed. <br/>
Again, there was no need for enforcement of rights because there was no <br/>
denial of rights.<br/>
<br/>
I believe some needs have priority.  The need to be safe is a higher <br/>
priority than the need to smack something with a stick.  The kid who was the <br/>
something being smacked needs to be helped to safety.   The kid who needs to <br/>
smack then, needs help to find something that&#39;s ok to smack.<br/>
<br/>
I think basic needs are a priority.  Food when someone&#39;s hungry.  Sleep when <br/>
someone is tired, a potty when someone needs to go, safety when someone is <br/>
being injured,  those needs take priority but that doesn&#39;t mean other needs <br/>
get ignored.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***None of these represent the &#39;working together&#39; paradigm of a common<br/>
goal of all the needs being addressed.***<br/>
<br/>
And I think our common goal of working together to meet the needs of all <br/>
family members is what helps us understand children have the same rights as <br/>
adults.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***If dh were to state, &#39;I<br/>
need someplace to sit&#39;; and ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS<br/>
sits in, there are many solutions to the dilemma which don&#39;t involve<br/>
enforcing a sense of entitlement. Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>
accessing the multitude of solutions?***<br/>
<br/>
I think we don&#39;t mean the same thing when were talking about rights.  My <br/>
right so sit on my chair is a general right because I was born in a country <br/>
where people have the right to own property.  Under my philosophy of <br/>
unschooling though, I don&#39;t have more right to a chair in a home I share <br/>
equally with other people.   Anyone in my house would move from one chair to <br/>
another if anyone else said, &quot;I wanted to sit there.&quot;   No struggle over <br/>
rights would ensue because no one has more right to any particular chair <br/>
than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
My kid has the same rights his dad and I have in our house.  He doesn&#39;t have <br/>
the same rights we have in society.  I compensate for that as much as <br/>
possible when I can, out in the world.   At home though, he&#39;s not desperate <br/>
to get the last piece of cake in order to enforce his right to have the same <br/>
number of pieces of cake his dad or I had.    It doesn&#39;t happen.  He&#39;s not <br/>
fighting for anything because he&#39;s not in any danger of losing anything.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that a person might have more need to sit in a particular chair - <br/>
my mom needs a higher chair and the chair with the lift to help her stand <br/>
up - and because it is our goal to live well together we don&#39;t push Grammy <br/>
out of the chair. &lt;g&gt;  (she&#39;s little, I could do it)<br/>
<br/>
***Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>
accessing the multitude of solutions?***<br/>
<br/>
I think that could be possible in a case were the people involved were used <br/>
to having to fight for what they needed or where they felt things were often <br/>
unfair.<br/>
<br/>
Our experience has been that because we believe our kid has the same rights <br/>
we do we are more able to see solutions that honor everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
***know you are joking here, but this IS how conflicts escalate<br/>
within a blame/fault paradigm from my experience.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was joking.  Other people seldom find me as amusing as I find myself. <br/>
I can live with that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I mostly see conflicts in other families escalate when the people involved <br/>
believe they&#39;re at risk of not getting what they want, or haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
what they want.<br/>
<br/>
We throw blame and fault around pretty freely and part of that might be <br/>
residual childhood fear of punishment stuff.  But generally speaking humans <br/>
use the concepts of blame and fault to learn about their world and to <br/>
understand natural consequences.    Radically unschooled kids might be less <br/>
likely to use blame and fault as a means to manipulate others or to comfort <br/>
themselves.<br/>
