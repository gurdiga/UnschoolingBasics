<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723444082">Hello, I&#39;m new here.<br/>
<br/>
My children currently attend public<br/>
school, but I am researching the<br/>
unschooling option.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have at this <br/>
particular time is this: <br/>
<br/>
Is SOL and/or SAT testing <br/>
required at all for unschoolers? <br/>
(we live in Virginia in case there&#39;s<br/>
anyone here with first-hand <br/>
experience in unschooling there).<br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;m asking is that<br/>
the unschooling approach<br/>
looks very relaxed (which imo<br/>
is a good thing!) that it almost <br/>
seems as if there is no form of<br/>
testing lurking in the futures of<br/>
those who practice this method<br/>
of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any <br/>
input on this little detail!  :)<br/>

Check here as a starting point for what&#39;s required in VA:<br/>

Each state is different.   I&#39;m in MA and we have a choice as <br/>
homeschoolers (I don&#39;t tell them we&#39;re unschoolers, they wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
a clue!) for the methods of assessment.   I&#39;m sure there&#39;s someone on <br/>
this list from VA who can give you more particulars!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928713084">I&#39;m not in VA but I looked up the legal stuff and you have 2 options <br/>
as far as evaluation (providing you are homeschooling under <br/>
the &#39;homeschool&#39; option and not under a religious exemption or tutor <br/>
option): 1 - you can submit results of -any- nationally standardized <br/>
achievement test (not just SAT or SOL, look into the PASS test <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hewitthomeschooling.com/test/tmain.asp)">http://hewitthomeschooling.com/test/tmain.asp)</a> and the resulting <br/>
composite score must be above the 23rd percentile (4th stanine) - <br/>
that means that 86 of 100 people taking the test did better than <br/>
your child, and your child did better than 22 of 100 people taking <br/>
that same test at that same time, not that they got 23% correct. So, <br/>
if 22 kids got 1 correct, your child got 2 correct and 86 kids got 3 <br/>
correct (out of 100 questions let&#39;s say), that&#39;s still 23rd <br/>
percentile, even though your child got 2 percent correct.<br/>
<br/>
The test need not be administered through or by the school system.<br/>
<br/>
2 - you can submit an evaluation or other assessment which <br/>
shows &quot;an &#39;adequate&#39; level of educational growth and progress&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to test (we don&#39;t even file notice or keep any sort of <br/>
records either here in CT) but &quot;lurking&quot; is not a word I&#39;ve heard <br/>
folks I know in other places use. It&#39;s more like testing is just <br/>
another hoop - no great shakes, just something that gets done one <br/>
day a year to keep the other 364 free. And something like the PASS <br/>
test (which was designed for homeschoolers) can be done at home, <br/>
untimed, relaxed. Also, check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests">http://sandradodd.com/tests</a> for <br/>
more ideas on dealing with tests without them making a big impact on <br/>
real life.<br/>
