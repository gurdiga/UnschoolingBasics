<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619533833">Just wondering if anyone knows anything about playing WOW on a private <br/>
server? Eric says that he played on one at the conference on someone <br/>
else&#39;s computer. I don&#39;t know enough about this, and I don&#39;t know what <br/>
information on google to go by, or if it is even allowed. I feel so <br/>
ignorant about this game. Every time I think I am learning, something <br/>
else comes along, and I am lost again! <br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>

&quot;What would it be like if you lived each day, each breath, as a work of <br/>
art in progress? Imagine that you are a masterpiece unfolding, every <br/>
second of every day, a work of art taking form with every breath.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129540772">From what I understand, it&#39;s legal to make your own private server (for<br/>
yourself only) if you own a copy of the game, but you cannot legally create<br/>
a server that other people can play on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008479288">My son says there is good and bad to playing on private server-- you <br/>
get to be higher level real quick but it is mostly an anything goes <br/>
place with no oversite or game rules. More of a free for all but you <br/>
get to be a 70 and try out the high level stuff without being a high <br/>
level. <br/>
