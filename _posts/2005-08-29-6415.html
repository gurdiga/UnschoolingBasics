<div id="ygrps-yiv-100014599">I read one blog of someone on this list but wonder if any of the rest of you do or know unschooling blog links?  I like to see how unschoolers do things and I am a bit fed up of the &quot;we are starting our school schedule next week (or this week a week early)&quot; type blogs I seem to be coming across. Also the stuff these people say they do ( do people really get up at 5 am everyday even if they don&#39;t live on a farm?) would give me burn out in a month lol so I don&#39;t want to read them anymore.<br/>

I am somewhat new to blogging and didn&#39;t add anything all summer due<br/>
to a broken computer. It isn&#39;t always about the kids either, sometimes<br/>
I just post my musings or rants..it&#39;s a mosh of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s only a few posts so far, I plan to be more active with it<br/>
after we move. I did add a hurricane post yesterday....anyhoo, it is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool, Ren. I just added yours to the list over at AU homepage, under <br/>
&quot;links.&quot;  For those who belong to both lists, I try to keep a pretty <br/>
updated links section there. Check the folder &quot;Unschoolers Websites and <br/>
Blogs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My blog is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There is an Unschoolers blog ring, but the rules state that you need to <br/>
post weekly--too rigid for this unschooler! ;)  Here&#39;s a link to that:<br/>

Haha!  That&#39;s great!  A bunch of our local unschooling groups have gotten a<br/>
sudden influx of Thomas Jefferson-pushing folks.  It&#39;s weird and they seem<br/>
to be trying to recruit people at our park days.  :o(<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway... I&#39;ve not blogged about this yet, but my husband&#39;s father&#39;s wife<br/>
has invited us to Ireland.  She asked about me, which was a first and we<br/>
were so excited about it that my daughter decided to learn Farsi.  So, we&#39;ve<br/>
been doing the Instant Immersion Farsi CD all day today (well, she outlasted<br/>
me by about 2 hours).  Right now she&#39;s lying on the bed saying toilett e<br/>
khanumha kojast (where&#39;s the ladies&#39; room?).  :o)<br/>
 <br/>
The day before that, we slept in until 1:30, hung out and went to the park<br/>
at 5 to meet our unschooling buddies.  Played until 10:15 until there were<br/>
no other people there, came home, ate a late dinner and watched TV Land<br/>
until 1:30.  Then she read me a kid version of The Tempest.  We finally<br/>
turned off the light at 2:30 and slept until 12:30 today.  Well, she did.  I<br/>
was up at 10.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve been having a ton of fun with our new (to us) vintage blocks we got<br/>
from Ebay.  We&#39;ve been building tall structures and taking pictures of them.<br/>
We&#39;ve also been playing a lot of Jenga, and we just start messing around<br/>
with a tangrams set.<br/>
 <br/>
Margaux (8) missed the release of Eldest, so that&#39;s on our &quot;to do&quot; list for<br/>
this weekend.  <br/>
 <br/>
Our unschooling schedule is that we have no schedule at all.  :o)  And we<br/>
like it that way.<br/>

over and over that no, we don&#39;t start school today. (or this week or ever)<br/>
We live each day like its summer vacation and we are all learning all the<br/>
time.  All I get, pretty much, are blank stares.<br/>

Me to. Everyone keep saying schools are going back on Monday ( UK) and what will you be doing?  Pretty much what we always do is the answer.  No one gets it. My mother - when she was speaking ( nearly a year of wonderful silence from her now)- was always saying &quot;what schooling did you do today&quot; . Er ...we didn&#39;t. But they will grow up illterate, you are ruining their lives is what I got.  Another biggie was if they don&#39;t get up at 7 am they will never be able to get up for work.  Never did understand that one.  <br/>
 <br/>
I had to laugh yesterday cos my 6 year old found some Evan Moore books I had bought in a panic fit ages ago.We never ever got them out. He dragged the pile over and aid &quot;These are boing mummy. Will you sell them on HAmozun?&quot;  So today I am putting them on listing lol He prefers real books and hands on stuff.<br/>

<br/>
We started our &quot;Disneyland schedule&quot; today. We have annual passes -  <br/>
most of the summer was blocked out, so, for us, this is not Back-to- <br/>
School time, but Back-to-Disneyland time!<br/>
<br/>
So - does that make you feel better?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes that makes me feel much better. We have 3 trips soon cos it would have been too busy in the school holidays.  Two museums and a pirate re-enactment/living history day Mind you I am horrible cos I couldn&#39;t help but snigger at some blogs after a disastrous first few days of schooling and how the schedules had already gone to pot.vbg. I resisted putting any comments lol.  I am so glad am not bound up by all that.  <br/>
