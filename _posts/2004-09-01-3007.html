<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751085167">I just finished reading &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; and sort of winced<br/>
through the whole section on taking care of Mom.  This is an area where I<br/>
tend to fall short and I do pay by going through times of exhaustion.  So<br/>
I&#39;m looking for inspiration and encouragement.  What do all of you do to<br/>
renew yourselves and take care of yourselves so that your children have a<br/>
joyful and energetic parent?  I am particularly interested in any input from<br/>
anyone whose children still have difficulty separating a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340656539">Hi, Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear about your situation which sounds very challenging.  Two main<br/>
thoughts came to me reading your post.  One was that I was wondering about<br/>
the character of your son&#39;s friendships with these boys, especially since<br/>
you wrote &quot;I will be glad when all these boys go back to school, and we can<br/>
be a bit more peaceful and hang out with some other kids.&quot;  That sounds like<br/>
perhaps the friendships you are describing in this email are not overall<br/>
positive ones for your son?  I&#39;m wondering if they are overall positive<br/>
friendships which sometimes denigrate into tussles and hard feelings, or if<br/>
the tussles and hard feelings and teasing pretty much define the<br/>
friendships.  If the former is the case, then it makes sense to me to<br/>
support your son&#39;s hanging out with them and work on the times hard feelings<br/>
happen.  If the latter is the case, then it makes more sense to me to talk<br/>
to your son about the character of the friendships, help him identify<br/>
whether they are ones he wants to continue or whether he&#39;d like to break<br/>
them off (perhaps with your help) and hang out with the &quot;other kids&quot; to whom<br/>
you refer now.  Is there a reason he has to wait till they go back to<br/>
school?  That sort of sounds like they are initiating things right now and<br/>
perhaps your son could use your help thinking things through and breaking<br/>
things off with them.<br/>
<br/>
For friendships that are positive overall and that your son values and wants<br/>
to keep but where he tends to sometimes lose his temper over things and lash<br/>
out, in addition to talking about other ways to handle anger, my other<br/>
thought is that you could try role playing situations your son finds<br/>
inflamatory with him so that he can practice handling it a different way.<br/>
This could be done yourselves or with puppets (I had a friend with a<br/>
daughter your son&#39;s age who was amazed at how her daughter responded to<br/>
discussing and working things out through puppet play and swore by it).<br/>
This way he&#39;ll have practiced doing things a different way and this may help<br/>
him interrupt his own process of coming to physical blows when the next<br/>
situation happens.<br/>
<br/>
Good for you for not listening to those telling you it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and<br/>
implying you should ignore it!  Good luck getting it resolved....<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would be mostly how I would describe this relationship. These boys are <br/>
brothers, and sometimes are here at the same time, sometimes separately. <br/>
Thereis a lot of teasing, in schooly way, they are from a very fundamentalist <br/>
family, and I believe they come here because things are just not as tough as at <br/>
home. They get &quot;the belt&quot; when punished,  and I even had a lecture from the older <br/>
one once that Tommy should be punished more. I t hink that they are very <br/>
wrapped ina struggle for power in everything they do as they have less than none at <br/>
home. So even play is used to get power. I really love these kids, and I see <br/>
Tommy drawn to the big excitement, fast paced play with them. He gets to do <br/>
big guy rough play, and do x-box and watch movies, we float down our river with <br/>
them, etc. But I really think that they are attracted to Tommy because they so <br/>
often get the upper hand by virtue of his age, and because I am so easy going <br/>
compared to home. I tend to do stuff with them, playing games, bikes, <br/>
swimming etc, where their mom is very busy. <br/>
Ds and I have talked about the nature of the friendship, and he knows he is <br/>
more relaxed without them , yet he really feels called to their energy, and the <br/>
good times they do have. It is almost like they are older brothers to him, so <br/>
I try to support him thru this, as I won&#39;t make the choice for him. <br/>
thanks for your reply, Joan. I have calmed down now, and we talked last night <br/>
about using physical force, and walking away to get help. I realize he really <br/>
is very young, just in a big package. He is the same size as the two <br/>
teenagers. I suggested maybe the kid he had the tussle with was intimidated by his <br/>
size, we have experienced that iwth other kids, who go out of their way to pick <br/>
on him because he is soo big.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348992082">I have a big son too, but he&#39;s only 3years and 40pounds (20pounds at <br/>
4 months! *ouch* my back!)<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that comes to my mind is: Is there a way that you can <br/>
channel his physical energy?  Is there someone who he can wrestle <br/>
with? Father, uncle, you?  This would be a good outlet for him to be <br/>
physical, and learn when to stop.  Perhaps he is interested in <br/>
getting involved in some type of sports to get out all that energy?  <br/>
Bike riding?  Soccer?  Baseball?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Tommy is quick to get hot under his collar<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this because he is self conscious about his size?  I know having a <br/>
big kid for his age, some people &#39;expect&#39; more from him because he is <br/>
so big, but he is really young.  This can be frustrating for the boy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;will hit or lash out if he is really ticked off. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This should be addressed.  Perhaps you can dialogue with him about <br/>
nonviolent alternatives- just walking away, using words<br/>
Maybe talk about why he is *really* angry.  Do kids call him &#39;fat&#39; or <br/>
tease him?  This may cause him to be angry.  Sounds like it would <br/>
also help for him to have friends who&#39;s parent do not hit them.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jennefer, yes we do al ot of physical stuff, we live on a small <br/>
acreage with horses, bikes, dogs, we built a climber for him, he is very much  a <br/>
physical child. I have always had to work to help him find good outlets for that. <br/>
Wea re planning to start martial arts this fall, hoping that will help. <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is this because he is self conscious about his size? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He has a great attitude about his size, he sometimes gets angry that he can&#39;t <br/>
move as fast as the little skinny kids, but he can do a lot of powerful stuff <br/>
they can&#39;t. He has just always had a bit of a quick temper, he hates to be <br/>
controlled, I think I was way too controlling when he was little, but have been <br/>
changing over that last number of years. <br/>
<br/>
I have worked hard at this for a long time, I think perhaps too hard? I am <br/>
really uptight about it, and I think I have come down too tough on him <br/>
sometimes, his personality is very sweet and kind, he is very social, and I think other <br/>
kids don&#39;t understand why he is not the same as other 13-14 year old kids his <br/>
size. He is only 8almost9, and it looks like he is just a weird older kid.<br/>
I appreciate  your reply, Jennefer, we do try to find kids from similar <br/>
situations, but they are hard to come by. In our town, there are only 2 other <br/>
families of unschoolers that we see, and that is hard to orchestrate sometimes. <br/>
tommy doesn&#39;t get teased by anyone about his appearance, he is never in that <br/>
type of situation. Only one neighborhood kid ever tried that with him, and all <br/>
the other kids stuck up for ds, and caused it to end.<br/>
Certainly dialoguing about alternatives would be great to do again, I just <br/>
have to wait till I am not so upset, or I tend to moralize with him, and get <br/>
worked up myself. Yikes, some work to do on myself obviously. This always <br/>
happens, when something comes up that is difficult, it turns out ot be me with real <br/>
problem, then everything else seems to fall into place. <br/>
Thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85233288">&lt;&lt;We are planning on starting martial arts hoping that will help&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just be careful of the instructor you get.  I would stay away from <br/>
sports karate and focus on old time self-defense.  That way your son <br/>
will at times be confronted with his anger and will be forced to <br/>
learn to control his responses incrementally (if you don&#39;t, it tends <br/>
to cause pain to your partner....and then its their turn to practice <br/>
on you &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Sports karate uses extreme motion control but doesn&#39;t tend to <br/>
develop the intra-personal emotional control.<br/>
