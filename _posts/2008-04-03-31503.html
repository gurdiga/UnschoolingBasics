<div id="ygrps-yiv-631239961">We are headed south next week, to Pawley&#39;s Island for a family<br/>
vacation.  I hear there is a family beach in Pawley&#39;s?  Not sure if<br/>
its public or what.  After checking it out, we&#39;ll definitely be going<br/>
to the city market in Charleston.  We&#39;d LOVE to meet some other<br/>
unschoolers if anyone is up for meeting us!  The market looks like a<br/>
day well spent, any takers?  Other ideas?  I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ll<br/>
make it to Columbia Kelly, but would still like to get together if<br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some other questions...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever been to a MagicQuest?  There is one down in Myrtle<br/>
Beach that my son wanted to check out last time.  Any reviews?<br/>
<br/>
Also...  we&#39;re fairly familiar with the area and the mainstream<br/>
attractions.  But does anyone have any other ideas as for some unique<br/>
and different activities?  You see, this vacation is with the<br/>
in-laws...  so keeping busy outside the house is key!!! &lt;BWG&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335177996">We have taken eco-tours in Charleston a couple of times, and I<br/>
*highly* recommend that experience! The company we went through was<br/>
Barrier Island Eco-Tours. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nature-tours.com/index.html">http://www.nature-tours.com/index.html</a>  They<br/>
took us to Capers Island, an undeveloped barrier island and nature<br/>
preserve, where they cooked out for us (yum!) and the kids could<br/>
wander around, and gave us a tour of the tidal creeks. They catch sea<br/>
life in a net, tell what they know about it, then release. (They have<br/>
a tank onboard) We did go with a group, I&#39;ve never done it<br/>
individually. I *loved* the tour guides, they&#39;re all naturalists, and<br/>
they really made the trip fun. Worth *every* penny, then some.<br/>
<br/>
We saw dolphins!<br/>
