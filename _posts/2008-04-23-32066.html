<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072870225">Hi, I&#39;m not sure if this is how to respond, i just hit reply, but i would like <br/>
to add my two cents to the topic of &quot;delayed speech in the eight month old.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
My daughter, Ani, began making sounds on a &quot;normal&quot; timetable, then just stopped <br/>
&quot;progressing&quot; at about ten months.  She didn&#39;t say ANY words at all.  She would <br/>
&quot;woof&quot; when the dog was at the door, and that was it.  I was becoming concerned <br/>
that perhaps she was deaf or hard-of-hearing, as I have some exp. within deaf <br/>
culture, and thought perhaps i was blessed with a &quot;special&quot; child after all.  <br/>
 <br/>
She and I communicated beautifully, however, it was just all telepathic.  She <br/>
has been E.C&#39;d since three months, and we always made it to the potty without <br/>
her vocalizing any thing. <br/>
 <br/>
Fast forward to this Christmas:  she was nineten months old, still not saying <br/>
any words.  She&#39;d been making tons of sounds, trying out each one, practicing <br/>
diff. pitches and tones for each new sound, incorporating the new sounds with <br/>
her reproitoire of previously mastered one, yet, no words.  Then we introduced <br/>
the Santa story to her.  Suddenly, everything&#39;s Santa!  santa, santa, <br/>
santa...within the month, she was speaking, quite clearly, appx. 18 words.  <br/>
 <br/>
As I looked back on the time, I realize that a lie was the reason she began <br/>
communicxation in spoken language.  Our telepathy worked perfectly until that <br/>
point, because all i&#39;d told her was the TRUTH.  As soon as an untruth was <br/>
introduced, she was removed from the purity of complete truth, had fallen to <br/>
this earth and had to adopt the &quot;normal&quot; way of communicating, i.e., through <br/>
spoken language. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, at 22 months, she is stringing together two and three word phrases.  She <br/>
and I are still telepathic and I feel this is the future of human <br/>
communications.  As we learn to live in light, in complete openness and freedom, <br/>
we will lose the need to decieve, to hide our true thoughs and intentions from <br/>
one another.  When we all begin to speak the truth, we will no longer need to <br/>
speak at all. <br/>

Laura, your post was great! I also did EC with two of my kids and I <br/>
do know what you mean about the telepathy, although I feel that their <br/>
talking was just another additional way of communication,instead of a <br/>
trade in. When they are little and you have them right there in arms <br/>
and they nurse freely without needing to ask, they sleep with you or <br/>
on you as they doze when they are tired... they do not need to talk <br/>
or cry because all of their needs are met. They are content.<br/>
<br/>
In my personal experience with my four kids and my friends, some who <br/>
have many children(one family has 7, another has 5), kids will <br/>
develop outside of the range of &quot;normal&quot; and be just fine.One of mine <br/>
walked at 8 months, but he didn&#39;t utter a word until well after 2. <br/>
Two talked very well and early. One was &quot;right on schedule&quot;. I have <br/>
seen an 18 month old who did not walk or talk, she just sat around <br/>
smiling. We called her the Budda Baby. Eventually she did just get up <br/>
and walk and talk. No problems at all.She was from the family of 7 <br/>
kids. They also had an 8 month old walking baby, so they have had <br/>
both extremes and everything in between.<br/>
<br/>
By contast, my sister has a son,her only child, who is now 4. When he <br/>
was born his esophegus was connected to his trachea, andwas not <br/>
connected to his stomach. He had surgery right away and many <br/>
complications.  He stopped breathing two times as an infant. As he <br/>
has grown,he was delayed in his development in crawling, walking, <br/>
talking and eating. Yet at 18 months I saw him catch up to <br/>
the &quot;average&quot; child. Yet,my sister and his Dr&#39;s were still saying he <br/>
was delayed in speach , and physical development. He did talk with <br/>
few words, but more than the Budda Baby!  He was walking, but didn&#39;t <br/>
like to get his hands dirty. They called this a sensory issue. I have <br/>
a kid who never liked to get dirt on his hands, not as a baby and not <br/>
now at 11. He is a very neat and tidy person.<br/>
 At 4 years old a therapist told my sister that her son was not <br/>
speaking properly,that he was just repeating phrases that other <br/>
people have said to him. He tells me all sorts of things,not <br/>
repeated, but he does repeat one thing I&#39;m sure he was told, he <br/>
says &quot;I have issues&quot;.<br/>
 Honestly, 8 months old is so little and there is still such a wide <br/>
range of development. I personally would just choose the wait and see <br/>
method.<br/>
