<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842112883">Can anyone recommend a book I could get for my daughters.  I have <br/>
two new grandchildren and one on the way.  <br/>
<br/>
A SHORT HISTORY:  I&#39;m a mother of seven children in a combined <br/>
family.  The four oldest, 18/18/19/20, were not homeschooled and <br/>
really don&#39;t know much about unschooling.  The youngest, 12, has <br/>
been homeschooling for three years, half of that unschooling. LOVE <br/>
IT!  The middle daughter, 16, has been unschooling since December <br/>
when we pulled her out of public school.   Our oldest boy, 14, will <br/>
be coming home fom PS to unschool in June.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since getting serious about unschooling and immersing myself <br/>
in information I would really like to share some of what I&#39;ve <br/>
learned with my older daughters...especially since they&#39;re having <br/>
children.  Our oldest grandchild will be 8 months next week.  I&#39;d <br/>
really like to get her mom, along with the other two, a book that <br/>
would be interesting and informative with an unschoolish attitude <br/>
for the beginning years.  Since I wasn&#39;t even aware of this <br/>
lifestyle when my children were young I really have nothing to fall <br/>
back on.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398343002">One of my favorites is &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John<br/>
Holt. It&#39;s about little kids learning about the world<br/>
without being taught. If my memory serves me right,<br/>
it&#39;s mostly about little kids, many under 5.<br/>
Definitely unschoolish.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of newer books around. I just haven&#39;t<br/>
had the chance to read any of them :(<br/>
