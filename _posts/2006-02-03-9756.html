<div id="ygrps-yiv-594434179">&quot;My kid does cool stuff too but he also does some not so cool stuff -<br/>
how do you handle in your house when one child is misbehaving?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Misbehavior is better viewed as a lack of tools. A child doesn&#39;t do<br/>
things for no reason....so if we can see beyond the behavior and try<br/>
to understand why a person would act hurtful or mean, we can see our<br/>
children as perfect and whole, even in the rough moments.<br/>
<br/>
Children are like foreigners in a strange land. They come to us whole,<br/>
but not with a framwork for how the world works. They need to gather<br/>
up tools along the way, without feeling &quot;less than&quot; when they mess up.<br/>
<br/>
If we can understand this, if we can assist them as foreigners trying<br/>
to understand and learn, we can see that punishment only gets in the<br/>
way of true understanding. It&#39;s harmful, not helpful. It takes away a<br/>
sense of internal motivation a sense of wholeness.<br/>
<br/>
We are here to guide and assist as needed, and young children need us<br/>
a LOT. Punishment puts a wedge between you and your child, they need<br/>
to trust us to assist them without harm.<br/>
<br/>
There are times I must remove a child very quickly from a situation.<br/>
If a person is being harmful to anyone, it needs to be stopped. But as<br/>
soon as I fill that person up with love, hugs or food (or whatever it<br/>
is they need at the moment) they are free to do and go where they<br/>
choose. There is no need for punishment. The issue was dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
Every person in my home deserves peace and safety, I think it is my<br/>
main job to ensure the household environment has the best odds of<br/>
providing that. I can&#39;t think of a single instance where any of my<br/>
children need punishing for anything they&#39;ve done. Perhaps you could<br/>
use some real life examples so we can examine the whole issue of<br/>
punishment and rewards more clearly?<br/>

<br/>
Gladly, I really value your perspective. Some is an issue of yelling. My son<br/>
(5 1/2) is a very sweet hearted loving boy most the time but when someone<br/>
new is over or sometimes without explanation he gets very loud. Each time I<br/>
very calmly explain to him that I don&#39;t yell at him and I would like him not<br/>
to yell at me. It is often nothing mean more like &quot;I want some milk&quot; but he<br/>
says it up in my face very loudly which is often hard for me to understand<br/>
what he says.<br/>
<br/>
The other is my son very often what his sister (13 m) to come play with him<br/>
or cuddle with him and she doesn&#39;t always want to he will try and force her<br/>
to do it by picking her up or holding her where he wants her. Then when she<br/>
does want to play he pushes her away. Last night he swiped her hand away<br/>
when she touched his belly. She, I think, gave the best punishment to him<br/>
then we could. She got the most pitiful face, I mean full pout in the truest<br/>
of misery and cried. I held her to me and was about to say something to him<br/>
but the look on his face was of regret. He knew but I don&#39;t know how to give<br/>
him the tools to deal with our newest person.<br/>
<br/>
The other is getting him to be still. Maybe he just isn&#39;t capable yet but<br/>
sometimes I really need him to stop juggling around for like 10 minutes so<br/>
we can get stuff like errands done or waiting in line like at the grocery<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t want to give the impression that my children are awful or that I<br/>
think they are. I am truly blessed to have the children I have - they are<br/>
bright, imaginative, sweet, caring, cuddly kids. Most days we have wonderful<br/>
days and I know that everyone has a bad day. <br/>

says it up in my face very loudly which is often hard for me to understand<br/>
what he says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jalen has a very high volume at times too. Always has. I&#39;ve spent a<br/>
lot of time saying, &quot;Jalen, that&#39;s hurting my ears, could you talk<br/>
lower?&quot; Or &quot;Can you use a voice like this (as I&#39;m talking softer) so I<br/>
can listen better?&quot;<br/>
He really is starting to catch himself now and honor my need for a<br/>
gentler voice (he just turned five) I try to save that request for<br/>
when I really need it.  It&#39;s never a time for making him feel badly<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The other is getting him to be still. Maybe he just isn&#39;t capable yet<br/>
but sometimes I really need him to stop juggling around for like 10<br/>
minutes so we can get stuff like errands done or waiting in line like<br/>
at the grocery store.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unrealistic expectation probably. Can you re-direct the wiggling so<br/>
it&#39;s simply done near you?  I&#39;m not sure why he would need to stand<br/>
still in a line, unless he&#39;s going too far away from you. Maybe you<br/>
could explain what the problem with movement is in that situation.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the wiggling is something other people give you strange<br/>
looks for. But as long as Jalen isn&#39;t truly harming anything or<br/>
getting somewhere he really shouldn&#39;t be, I figure there&#39;s no harm in<br/>
a wiggly boy.<br/>
He actually does not stay by my side when I&#39;m checking out, but I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to give him as much freedom as age allows for safely and he&#39;s<br/>
quite willing to stay nearby. Often, he sits on the electric shopping<br/>
carts and eats some popcorn I picked up for him.<br/>
He never stands still though. Again, I don&#39;t see why that would be an<br/>
issue to make him feel badly over.<br/>
<br/>
Can you bring some interesting snacks or toys with you for those<br/>
moments you really feel he needs to be more still? There are so many<br/>
ways to help a child cope, without trying to conform them to some<br/>
unrealistic behavior. Young children NEED to move, NEED to explore and<br/>
talk and be loud in many cases. We can help them gain tools for<br/>
coping, but most of the time it&#39;s US that need to do the adapting, not<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of younger sibling stuff, it&#39;s just plain hard at that<br/>
age.  He&#39;s not going to really appreciate and enjoy her play until<br/>
she&#39;s older.  It&#39;s really vital to be very present until that day.<br/>
Five is still so very young. He&#39;s only had five years to learn to walk<br/>
and speak a whole language, he just hasn&#39;t had time (nor the<br/>
development) to figure out all this relationship stuff, or pick up<br/>
great communication tools. He&#39;s using what he has....there is no shame<br/>
in that. Punishment won&#39;t help him navigate any of the above<br/>
situations though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924207407">&quot;I know that my discipline is still a still a form of punishment. I<br/>
ask my son to go to his room until he can manage himself better. I<br/>
would like better ideas but I haven&#39;t found any.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but you&#39;re starting to see why it sucks.:)<br/>
Society says it&#39;s ok to treat children as inferior citizens. They are<br/>
not given the dignity and respect they so richly deserve by most<br/>
parents. You mentioned in the last post that you wouldn&#39;t question<br/>
another adult the way you question your child.....and your child knows<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
As far as sending a child to their room. Imagine if your dh did that<br/>
to you when you were in a pissy mood. Maybe you say something cutting<br/>
or inappropriate and he said &quot;go sit in your room until you can be nicer&quot;.<br/>
OOH YUCK! Would it make you want to act nice? NO, it would make you<br/>
resent the hell out of him.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE times I need to get a child away from other people. That can<br/>
be done with kindness though. Pick them up, hug them, tell them you<br/>
need to spend some time away from other people so the other person can<br/>
have their peace.  Sit together, talk if the child feels like it,<br/>
sympathize with them, rub their back and let them know you care that<br/>
they&#39;re having a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs and love go a long way to shifting inappropriate behavior.....and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t drive a wedge between you and the child. We all could use a<br/>
bit of sympathy when we&#39;re having a rough day....a little understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There were times when the children were much younger that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
take a child away from everyone, so maybe I had one in a sling (or on<br/>
the hip) and one on the other hip, or next to me or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Sending a person away makes them feel rejected, not understood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847074662">Well put Ren!  You mentioned Alfie&#39;s book &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;, and I would<br/>
like to add that his book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; touches on the P/R<br/>
dialogue, but from the parenting perspective.  The book is wonderful for<br/>
anyone interested in a non-punishment based parenting style.Just thought I&#39;d<br/>
chime in!<br/>

moments you really feel he needs to be more still? There are so many<br/>
ways to help a child cope, without trying to conform them to some<br/>
unrealistic behavior. Young children NEED to move, NEED to explore and<br/>
talk and be loud in many cases. We can help them gain tools for<br/>
coping, but most of the time it&#39;s US that need to do the adapting, not<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of younger sibling stuff, it&#39;s just plain hard at that<br/>
age.  He&#39;s not going to really appreciate and enjoy her play until<br/>
she&#39;s older.  It&#39;s really vital to be very present until that day.<br/>
Five is still so very young. He&#39;s only had five years to learn to walk<br/>
and speak a whole language, he just hasn&#39;t had time (nor the<br/>
development) to figure out all this relationship stuff, or pick up<br/>
great communication tools. He&#39;s using what he has....there is no shame<br/>
in that. Punishment won&#39;t help him navigate any of the above<br/>
situations though.<br/>

Yes, sometimes I contradict what I believe with the way I act because I lack<br/>
the tools and sometimes the patience. Actually, my husband has sent me to my<br/>
room and I do resent it. I need a new tactic because I don&#39;t like send him<br/>

Ah, but you&#39;re starting to see why it sucks.:)<br/>
Society says it&#39;s ok to treat children as inferior citizens. They are<br/>
not given the dignity and respect they so richly deserve by most<br/>
parents. You mentioned in the last post that you wouldn&#39;t question<br/>

<br/>
As far as sending a child to their room. Imagine if your dh did that<br/>
to you when you were in a pissy mood. Maybe you say something cutting<br/>
or inappropriate and he said &quot;go sit in your room until you can be nicer&quot;.<br/>
OOH YUCK! Would it make you want to act nice? NO, it would make you<br/>
resent the hell out of him.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE times I need to get a child away from other people. That can<br/>
be done with kindness though. Pick them up, hug them, tell them you<br/>
need to spend some time away from other people so the other person can<br/>
have their peace.  Sit together, talk if the child feels like it,<br/>
sympathize with them, rub their back and let them know you care that<br/>
they&#39;re having a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs and love go a long way to shifting inappropriate behavior.....and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t drive a wedge between you and the child. We all could use a<br/>
bit of sympathy when we&#39;re having a rough day....a little understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There were times when the children were much younger that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
take a child away from everyone, so maybe I had one in a sling (or on<br/>

Sending a person away makes them feel rejected, not understood.<br/>

Well put Ren!  You mentioned Alfie&#39;s book &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;, and I would<br/>
like to add that his book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; touches on the P/R<br/>
dialogue, but from the parenting perspective.  The book is wonderful for<br/>
anyone interested in a non-punishment based parenting style.Just thought I&#39;d<br/>

time--basically until my youngest got old enough to be really tired of <br/>
getting carted around every where and begin to be really verbal about it.<br/>
<br/>
Once that happened, after some serious soul-searching we began cutting <br/>
way back on our outings to honor his need to stay home and just *be*.<br/>
<br/>
That said, however, there are still times when for one reason or another <br/>
we need to go out. The single greatest tool I&#39;ve found for being in long <br/>
lines or difficult standing still (relatively speaking) and waiting <br/>
situations with young kids is &quot;Simon Says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My three will happily play &quot;Simon Says,&quot; something we never play at <br/>
home, while waiting in a really long line. We rotate being &quot;Simon&quot; and <br/>
do really silly things. Before we know it, it&#39;s our turn at the <br/>
check-out, and we&#39;re out of there as gracefully as can be.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with everything Ren already said but wanted to expand a <br/>
bit--from my perspective, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are two opposing goals in the op &quot;discipline&quot; idea. One is <br/>
the goal to have the child take some time until they&#39;re feeling more <br/>
social; the other is (maybe) to teach the child the lesson that they <br/>
need to be nice.<br/>
<br/>
The first goal, imo, is not a misdirected goal--if a person is feeling <br/>
grumpy or cranky, then being in a less social situation is likely a good <br/>
plan. I do that when I&#39;m feeling grumpy for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
The issue arises, as I see it anyway, when goal one gets coupled with <br/>
goal two. The second goal is what, imo, makes the action &quot;go to your <br/>
room&quot; punitive. It turns a natural social conflict into a situation of <br/>
power and punishment.<br/>
<br/>
If my dh is feeling grumpy, the best solution for the family is for him <br/>
to own that grumpiness and either make an emotional shift or to go putz <br/>
around in the barn, chop wood, or engage in some other solitary activity <br/>
rather than pick fights with those around him. Let&#39;s face it, we all <br/>
have those grumpy moments when we are likely to grump at people around <br/>
us and pick fights even (and sometimes especially) with those we love. <br/>
When I&#39;m feeling really pms-y, I try to realize that right away--observe <br/>
it and know it about myself--and honor that feeling at the same time I <br/>
honor my relationships. I&#39;ll say to my kids that I&#39;m feeling grumpy, <br/>
that I&#39;m choosing to clean or garden or whatever so that I don&#39;t grump <br/>
at them, and I tell them where I&#39;ll be if they need me. I&#39;ll try to take <br/>
some solitary time to honor my own feelings and move through them, so <br/>
that I feel more available to family members at other times.<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s a really long-winded way of saying that in our family the <br/>
goal is to help our kids do this same thing--recognize and honor their <br/>
own feelings while at the same time respecting and preserving our <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I&#39;ve gently removed one of my children from a <br/>
space, but the goal has always been to help them honor and process their <br/>
emotions in a space that&#39;s conducive to that and respectful to the other <br/>
members of the household. So, when I remove one of my children or gently <br/>
suggest they go to a safe space and offer to go with them, the goal is <br/>
to help them process their strong feelings, not to make them stop having <br/>
those strong feelings or to isolate them if that&#39;s not a choice they&#39;d <br/>
like to make. I&#39;m there to be with them, comfort them, maintain a calm <br/>
presence in the face of their intense emotion, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think it *is* important to do this in a way that respects other family <br/>
member&#39;s right to space. But that&#39;s not to say that the child&#39;s room is <br/>
the only space where this can happen. It could be my room, the computer <br/>
room, outside on the trampoline, where ever they can take the space and <br/>
time they need to express and move through their emotion. If I had an <br/>
only child, I imagine that I&#39;d do a lot more of this honoring within the <br/>
space we were in. But, because I have three children, honoring the <br/>
intense emotion often coincides with removing ourselves to a different <br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
What I believe makes this non-punitive is my willingness to accompany <br/>
the child, so it does not amount to love withdrawal, to borrow Alfie <br/>
Kohn&#39;s term, and the fact that the child controls when s/he feels ready <br/>
to rejoin the social space.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best measure of punitive/ non-punitive is to measure our own <br/>
behavior with a child versus how we would behave with a spouse or a <br/>
friend. If I had a friend who was bereaved or angry and chose to express <br/>
that in very verbal and public ways, I would gently and persuasively <br/>
attempt to get that person out of that public space and to a more <br/>
private space as quickly and quietly as possible. So, too, if my husband <br/>
seems grumpy or becomes particularly angry do I try to persuade him to <br/>
remove himself as gently and respectfully as possible, though I&#39;m also <br/>
not adverse to putting myself less-tactfully between my dh and my <br/>
children in much the same way I&#39;d stand between a dear friend and harm&#39;s <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Consciously and carefully thinking through actions with my children and <br/>
measuring them against the yardstick of how I might behave with an equal <br/>
has been an invaluable tool in my own journey in respectful parenting.<br/>

The 2 year old is not feeling well and choose not to nap so she is super tired and cranky and doing nothing but following me around and whining. Id like to just sit down and snuggle her but cant because Im cleaning up poop. The 6 year old is bouncing off the walls after sitting at school all day.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798974316">&quot; But that&#39;s not to say that the child&#39;s room is<br/>
the only space where this can happen. It could be my room, the computer<br/>
room, outside on the trampoline, where ever they can take the space and<br/>
time they need to express and move through their emotion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you brought this up. When I remove someone from a volatile<br/>
situation, it&#39;s pretty unusual that we go to the child&#39;s room<br/>
actually. Sierra will choose her room for some private time on her<br/>
own, but when I intervene it could be the living room, my room or even<br/>
outside. Typically it&#39;s Jalen that needs to be moved away from people<br/>
for a short time. And typically, once he has some hugs and love he&#39;s<br/>
ready to go back.<br/>
<br/>
I once read about how human beings tend to associate certain<br/>
activities with spaces in the home and it can bring about certain<br/>
emotions. Using a child&#39;s bedroom as a place of punishment is really<br/>
awful if you think about it....beyond the punishment being a<br/>
not-so-great thing, associating it with a space you want your child to<br/>
feel comfort and peace in, isn&#39;t so good either.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer all of the spaces in our house be associated with good<br/>
feelings.:) When we have rough moments, those comforting associations<br/>
with space can help us shift into a better place.<br/>

Don&#39;t feel guilty about not being always able to be everything to  <br/>
everyone in your family - get some help. Even another set of eyes  <br/>
would be great - they&#39;d notice your 4 yo making a mess before it got  <br/>
too bad, they&#39;d sit and read to your little one for a while, or  <br/>
whatever you need. I had a girl come help me after I had my second  <br/>
child and I was working from home - she was pregnant, herself and it  <br/>
was a good situation for both of us, for about 6 months or so.  Don&#39;t  <br/>
underestimate how much difference it can make to have another adult  <br/>
present, even just for a couple of hours.<br/>

thinking you like the baby more than him. If you get angry at him  <br/>
(though I know you didn&#39;t that time) when he&#39;s trying to play or  <br/>
trying to get something in an inappropriate way, he&#39;s going to feel  <br/>
you think the baby&#39;s feelings are more important. If he wants to  <br/>

you&#39;re expecting that you can explain what you want and that&#39;s going  <br/>
to change him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is something very worth thinking about now, while he&#39;s so  <br/>
little, because the same principle will hold when he&#39;s 15 as when  <br/>
he&#39;s 5 -- &quot;He will do what he wants to do.&quot; Parents who restrict and  <br/>
discipline think they can control their kids. Ha. We all know kids  <br/>
who are little angels around their parents and holy terrors away from  <br/>
their parents.<br/>
<br/>
So - recognizing that we don&#39;t control them (at least not for long)  <br/>
is Step 1. The next thing seems to be that people think they should  <br/>
be able to talk them into behaving as the parent wants. Nah.<br/>
<br/>
The radical unschooling parent&#39;s role is best described as &quot;create a  <br/>
workable environment.&quot; Set things up so that kids CAN choose to do  <br/>
what they want and parents can be comfortable with the choices. Work  <br/>
toward THAT. If a kid is repeatedly engaging in some behavior that  <br/>
the parent can&#39;t tolerate, then the PARENT is messing up by setting  <br/>
up the situation or allowing the situation to exist, over and over.  <br/>
Use your greater knowledge, greater power, wider perspective and far  <br/>
greater resources to change the circumstances. Be creative. Be  <br/>
clever. Be smart. Be kind and loving and make life good for your  <br/>
child. They&#39;ll pay you back with their own kindness and respect and  <br/>
caring and, when they are teens and the decisions matter a lot more,  <br/>
they&#39;ll be far more willing to consider your input.<br/>
<br/>
When you very calmly explain to him that you don&#39;t yell and would  <br/>
like him not to yell - you&#39;re telling him something he already knows.  <br/>
He KNOWS you don&#39;t want him to be loud - that is undoubtedly WHY he  <br/>
is being loud, to get your attention. It is insulting and infuriating  <br/>
to be told something you already know, in the first place, and,  <br/>
second, there isn&#39;t much MORE infuriating than being frustrated and  <br/>
upset enough to raise your voice and having the other person tell you  <br/>
to calm down, instead of responding to the real issue.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s being loud just for the fun of it - then you&#39;re a spoilsport  <br/>
and your expectations are unreasonable. Kids ARE loud. Let it be.  <br/>
Have fun with it. He&#39;s a little little boy.<br/>

Yes, it was helpful because it reminds of what my grandfather used to tell<br/>
me - no matter how bad your day is going there is always someone&#39;s day that<br/>
is worse. It is also helpful because it reminds me that everyone has bad<br/>
days and that it is okay to loose your patience. Most of my childhood<br/>
memories are of a lot of yelling - my mom&#39;s creedo is that she yelled a lot<br/>
but once she yelled for five minutes it was over. The yelling may have been<br/>
over but I still very small when someone yells and I don&#39;t want my kids to<br/>
feel like that.<br/>
<br/>
Do you teach your son sign language? I used to do therapy for kids with<br/>
autism when I was in college and I taught sign language. It was very<br/>
rewarding to see a child who was frustrated because she knew what she wanted<br/>
but couldn&#39;t tell anyone.<br/>

I really agree with what you are saying.  I learned early with ds 1 who is now 5 yrs old that I really had no control over him.  People used to think I was crazy for saying that but ultimately children will always choose their behavior because that is what people do.  However, I can relate to Joyce.  When ds1 was younger, especially pre-verbal, he would hit me when he was angry.  Sometimes I handled it appropriately and other times I lost it as I was clueless and shocked that I had a child who hit considering that I did not hit him.  However, as he got older and had more words the hitting declined.  But one day I said told him that we do not relate to one another with hitting.  I told him that I did not hit him and that I did not want him to hit me because I do not liked to be hit.  In his face I saw something click, he got it and stopped hitting.  He is the type of child who I guess is rather logical and so that approach has worked very well with him.  It is all about mutual respect because I have no problems with him calling me out if do something that infringes on his respect.  <br/>
<br/>
DS2 is proving to be more challenging in a way.  He hits, too.  It has bothered me way less this time around because I understand it.  What ds2 is showing me is that the logical approach will not work for him.  I HATE being hit by my children, and I must admit, especially in public.  I do feel in a way he is doing what some children do.  I don&#39;t see his behavior as anti-social or anything and I am even beginning to realize that often times when he is sleepy, he is uncontrollable with the hitting and pushing.  I don&#39;t know anyone who has experienced a child who hits who can make me feel comfortable that this will go away in time.  I am at a place where it is getting crucial for me because he is quickly moving towards 3 yrs old.  I have to be honest with you all, I will be damn before  I have a big child hitting me.  It is okay now that he is little but I am just not going to have it once he gets older.  Call it conditionings, call it controlling, call me disrespectful, but I work hard to be a loving parent, and I am one who really has to WORK HARD.  I have control and anger issues that I work to transform everyday so that I am a loving and available mother.  So, in a way I think that as he gets older, he is going to have to express himself in a different way because I am getting to a place where I am growing weary.  He is little still and I am dealing with it.  I have even tried to soften him down during those times by giving him loving and nursing him.  I guess what I am wanting to know from others who understand and/or have experience with this, will he grow out of it as he gets more verbal?  He is slower with coming into his speech than my older son.  Or what internal process can I tap into to help me better understand so that I can help my son express himself differently?  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your input and understanding.<br/>

  So - recognizing that we don&#39;t control them (at least not for long)  <br/>
  is Step 1. The next thing seems to be that people think they should  <br/>
  be able to talk them into behaving as the parent wants. Nah.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  When you very calmly explain to him that you don&#39;t yell and would  <br/>
  like him not to yell - you&#39;re telling him something he already knows.  <br/>
  He KNOWS you don&#39;t want him to be loud - that is undoubtedly WHY he  <br/>
  is being loud, to get your attention. It is insulting and infuriating  <br/>
  to be told something you already know, in the first place, and,  <br/>
  second, there isn&#39;t much MORE infuriating than being frustrated and  <br/>
  upset enough to raise your voice and having the other person tell you  <br/>
  to calm down, instead of responding to the real issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386737373">Sorry, I sent the last a little too soon... today has been kind of hectic<br/>

<br/>
&quot;If he&#39;s hurting his sister, help her be safe and help him figure out a<br/>
better way to play with her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want anyone to think that he does this deliberately. He loves his<br/>
sister and usually wants to cuddle and hug her possible to death. She is a<br/>
strong little cookie, red hair with the attitude to match and while in out<br/>
and out fight her brother would probably win she would get him as much.<br/>
Often the situation is not one where he has hurt her but more upset her<br/>
because he wants her to do the opposite of what she wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
She knows how to stand up to herself and if I don&#39;t help develop a balance<br/>
between them I foresee some major battles between them. Both my sister and I<br/>
are redheads and our childhood was a constant battle of wills which has kept<br/>
a breach to this day. While we work to build a better relationship between<br/>
us, I want to help my kids never to have to go through that.<br/>
<br/>
I see I won&#39;t have to search for books to read for a while. I am going to<br/>
look for a copy of Siblings Without Rivalry by Adele Faber and Elaine<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re looking for the magic thing that will change him and  <br/>
make him behave the way you want to.<br/>
<br/>
It will help to see him as doing the best he can with the tools and  <br/>
skills that he has. Give him the information he needs so he can use  <br/>
it when he is able &quot;A quiet voice will help me understand what you&#39;re  <br/>
asking for better.&quot; But you may need to keep doing this for a while  <br/>
until he&#39;s able to stop and think before he acts.<br/>
<br/>
(When I get frustrated with my daughter choosing the emotional route  <br/>
rather than the logical route, I try to remember some senseless  <br/>
choices I&#39;ve made even knowing full well what the better choice is.  <br/>
(My senseless choices usually involve food ;-) Like taking a second  <br/>
piece of cheesecake or eating half a bag of Oreos!) If *I* can&#39;t  <br/>
always be sensible, how can I expect someone who has only been on the  <br/>
planet for a few years to always master their emotions and make the  <br/>
more social choice?)<br/>
<br/>
Look at him as trying to get something he doesn&#39;t yet have the  <br/>
appropriate skills for. You can&#39;t give him those skills. You can&#39;t  <br/>
make him understand. But he will when he&#39;s able. So once you&#39;ve done  <br/>
what you can, then help him.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s hurting his sister, help her be safe and help him figure out  <br/>
a better way to play with her.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I held her to me and was about to say something to him<br/>
<br/>
I can see this as natural but I can also see this as leading him to  <br/>
thinking you like the baby more than him. If you get angry at him  <br/>
(though I know you didn&#39;t that time) when he&#39;s trying to play or  <br/>
trying to get something in an inappropriate way, he&#39;s going to feel  <br/>
you think the baby&#39;s feelings are more important. If he wants to  <br/>
play, help him figure out how to make the baby smile. If he wants  <br/>
something else and is using the baby as a means to that end, help him  <br/>
get what it is he wants.<br/>
<br/>
A really good book is Siblings Without Rivalry by Adele Faber and  <br/>
Elaine Mazlish. It&#39;s a very easy read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828524125">For the past couple days I have been going through stuff we don&#39;t need like<br/>
workbooks I got eons ago and have never used and packing up stuff that my<br/>
daughter isn&#39;t ready for and my son has out grown. I figure I will slowly<br/>
start introducing her to stuff I packed up in six months or so and if not<br/>
pack it back up and wait longer. So my son has spent a lot of time at the<br/>
table playing with things we couldn&#39;t get to because there was too much<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he didn&#39;t want to go to bed, my DH wasn&#39;t feeling well and was in<br/>
bed and he was playing nicely at the table so I didn&#39;t make an issue of it.<br/>
These days, I only really encourage him going to bed or coming to cuddle on<br/>
the couch when he is getting tired and being tired he gets frustrated.<br/>
Finally, I told him he needed to go get ready for bed and pick a movie<br/>
because everyone was going to bed. He got up, got ready for bed, picked a<br/>
movie and went to bed after kisses and hugs of course.<br/>
<br/>
Also, today, his Uncle &quot;Shaggy&quot; came over and he usually bounces off the<br/>
walls in excitement. My DH warned him if he didn&#39;t calm down he would need<br/>
to go to his room. He has just finished up some finger painting so I asked<br/>
him to come to the kitchen. Asked if he was done - he was and had washed his<br/>
hands he told me. I said that I knew he was excited to see Uncle &quot;Shaggy&quot;<br/>
and instead of bouncing around why didn&#39;t he go give him a big hug and when<br/>
Dad and Uncle &quot;Shaggy&quot; got finished catching up that Uncle &quot;Shaggy&quot; would<br/>
spend some time with him.<br/>
<br/>
It worked! It worked! I know someone is laughing at me and that is okay. It<br/>
isn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t think it wouldn&#39;t work but I guess I thought it would<br/>
take more time. He gave him a hug ended up bumping his nose and had to be<br/>
loved up a little but was otherwise okay and calmed down. After a little<br/>
catch up, Uncle &quot;Shaggy&quot; read my DS a story - no more bouncing off the wall<br/>
and everyone is happy!<br/>
<br/>
YEAH!<br/>

might unknowingly be creating a wall between them. If you step in to  <br/>
defend your daughter, your son will see that as taking her side  <br/>
against him. The book will help you find ways to help them both  <br/>
without giving them the idea you&#39;re taking sides.<br/>

But don&#39;t expect it to work! ;-) His emotions are still going to get  <br/>

emotions are so powerful. Just remind him and assume he&#39;s doing the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754961600">&lt;&lt;Before I have a big kid hitting me...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not allow anyone to hit me, adult or child.  However, having said that, I have zero control over whether they take a swing at me.  You are an adult, you know it is likely to happen.  Step out of his way, block it with your forearm, catch his arm as he swings.<br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s husband very recently passed away after a very long illness.  The oldest child is 5 and a little rambunctious anyway.  He is having a difficult time.  I was with him at a park day and he got to hitting at me with a shoe.  It started as playing but I could tell that it was moving to a dark place for him, a place he probably is spending a lot of time these days.  He swung that shoe at me as long as he needed to, I simply blocked it with my arm and kept on talking and joking with him.<br/>
<br/>
I think people should take responsibility for being hit.<br/>
