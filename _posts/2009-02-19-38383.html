<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072424158">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for answers from different unschoolers to the following  <br/>
question/s:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do/did you reconcile working life/your job with unschooling your  <br/>
kids?&quot; / &quot;How do you manage to unschool and your job (as a family)?&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;Can you give beginning Unschoolers an advice on how to approach  <br/>
this issue?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I need short precise answers that I can quote in our German magazine,  <br/>
following an article about managing to unschool while still working/ <br/>
how to change things so you can unschool etc. What do unschoolers do  <br/>
to have enough time to unschool and still finance their life? Did you  <br/>
change or quit your job? do you get help? what about your partner?<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to give me quotable answers, please write to me to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dialog@...">dialog@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Please not that I will NOT change your quotes (maybe I&#39;ll have to  <br/>
shorten them, then I&#39;ll ask for your permission). I&#39;m fully supportive  <br/>
of unschooling and promise not to twist any answers as to depict  <br/>
unschooling as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or anything. The magazine &quot;unerzogen&quot;  <br/>
is about unschooling, democratic education and respectful parenting.  <br/>
We have printed articles/interviews from: Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly  <br/>
Lovejoy and Sandra Dodd.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support! Unschooling (homeschooling even) is illegal  <br/>
in Germany. Please help us contribute to inform people about  <br/>
unschooling ideas by sending me answers that I can use :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
In case my questions are not clear, here are possible answers, so you  <br/>
can see what I&#39;m looking for:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I quit my job and my husband works. We&#39;ve cut back and live in a  <br/>
smaller flat so we can finance unschooling&quot;.<br/>
&quot;We both work and do this in different shifts so that most of the time  <br/>
someone is at home with the kids&quot;<br/>
&quot;We have a problem and have not come up with a solution yet, but we&#39;re  <br/>
working on it&quot;<br/>
&quot;We have an network of unschooling friends and try to help each other  <br/>
out&quot;<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;m not looking for people who fit my answers -- these were  <br/>
rather jus examples. I&#39;m looking for real solutions that you&#39;ve come  <br/>
up with. Or maybe even different ways to approach this &quot;problem&quot; (like  <br/>
not seeing it as a problem?..) The answers should not be too long, so  <br/>
I can quote many different unschoolers on one page.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
