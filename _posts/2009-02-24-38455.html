<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104735366">It is coming to the end of the month. If you&#39;d like to sumbit a blog post to<br/>
the carnival please email me with it soon (by the 27th). Also, Please<br/>
forward this to other lists you may be on. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the open ended topic is Video Games.<br/>
<br/>
Ren usually adds a few thoughts to start us out. So...<br/>
<br/>
How are video games a part of you and/or your kids lives? How do you support<br/>
video gaming in your household? if you haven&#39;t always been supportive how<br/>
did you &quot;get there&quot;?<br/>
Do you play video games as a family?<br/>
How do you deal with your mainstream friends ideas about video games?<br/>
What do you say to your kids when their friends aren&#39;t allowed to play V&#39;s<br/>
because of restriction?<br/>
Thoughts on violence and VG, or learning through VGs.<br/>
How does VG system or console sharing work in your house, how has it<br/>
evolved?<br/>
how much is &quot;too much&quot;?<br/>
Ok so there are some starts. I hope that works for eveyone :-) This is my<br/>
first try with this.<br/>
<br/>
So send the links to me on here or at littlemsvoid at gmail on or before<br/>
25th as I will be out of town starting 27th and I want to have this posted<br/>
before then.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun writing!<br/>
