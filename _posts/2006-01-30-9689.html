Hi ladies,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about those of you who have only children. Although we&#39;ve <br/>
been hs&#39;s for 4 years, we&#39;ve only been unschooling the last 4 - 5 <br/>
months. I read a lot (on message boards, in hs/us magazines, etc.) <br/>
about familes with 2+ children. Their kids play together, do projects <br/>
together, etc. I know that these parents also spend a lot of time <br/>
with their kids, but their kids also seem to spend a fair amount of <br/>
time doing things *together*. We don&#39;t have any kids nearby, nor <br/>
unschoolers (we do know some VERY strict school-at-homers, but we <br/>
don&#39;t socialize with them much). There aren&#39;t any hs co-ops or <br/>
playgroups in the area, unless the kids are 5 and under. He does have <br/>
some public school friends that come over every weekend, plus several <br/>
other weekly activities with kids, so he&#39;s not completely isolated.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just wonding how other familes like ours work. What <br/>
works, and doesn&#39;t work, for your families? <br/>

***************************<br/>
I have a 16 year old son, only child. I agree that homeschooling and  <br/>
unschooling will probably look different when there isn&#39;t a built-in companion  that <br/>
your son can run off and play with. On the other hand, there are no sibling  <br/>
fights. (Mom, wherever you are, please once again accept my apologies!)<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve been homeschooling for a while, and your son already has friends he  <br/>
spends time with. I assume when you were homeschooling vs. unschooling that  <br/>
every hour was NOT taken up with structured schooling. The rest of time, I  <br/>
suspect, sometimes you hung out together and played together, or chatted.  <br/>
Sometimes he spent hours creating with legos or watching movies. Maybe you read  <br/>
together or separately, or made cookies, or maybe he rode his bike, with family,  <br/>
friends, or by himself.<br/>
 <br/>
The difference with the unschooling is that he gets to do the fun stuff all  <br/>
the time and you can stop planning lessons and do fun stuff too.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;d be wonderful to have an unschooling companion next door. But even if  <br/>
you did, they might or might not like each other. I think if it&#39;s even a  bit <br/>
possible that Unschooling conferences are really great for only children,  <br/>
especially as you approach teen years. I think the conferences, for teens, may  <br/>
help unschoolers not decide school is a sexier option -- they have a community.  <br/>
They can be in touch with their community through the internet and  telephone.<br/>
 <br/>
Where are you? The national Live and Learn Unschooling Conference is in  <br/>
Albuquerque this year, and there are other unschooling regional conferences  <br/>
scattered about, including one in Massachusetts in May.<br/>
