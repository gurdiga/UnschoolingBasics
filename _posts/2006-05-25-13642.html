Subject: OT: Tivo question<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Is it supposed to have that hum? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe it should.  We have 3 Tivo&#39;s from three generations of<br/>
Tivo&#39;s from the first one up to a HD from Direct TV.  To my knowledge, none<br/>
them hum.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;What happens if you unplug it at night so it can&#39;t hum? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We gave my parents a first generation, and I believe they left it unplugged<br/>
at certain times, but they had to be careful or they would miss the download<br/>
time and not receive any of the guide information.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
