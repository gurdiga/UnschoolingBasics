Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling&quot; which is awesome. I highly recommend it. <br/>
Straightforward, interesting, inspiring - lots and lots of material in <br/>
which to immerse yourself!<br/>
<br/>
I love Rue Kream&#39;s book, as well - it is focused on unschooling as <br/>
parenting, not  a how to unschool book in the academic sense like the <br/>
book you&#39;ve just read by Mary Griffith - very different.<br/>

I just want to second Schuyler&#39;s recommendation. All of her information in that post was very helpful but I would spend the money on Rue&#39;s book first if it were up to me.:)<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and I believe that unschooling doesn&#39;t need to be paired with any belief system, it works regardless of your beliefs as long as you trust and respect children and natural learning! <br/>

Would you mind giving us a peek into that book Pam? I don&#39;t have that one yet and would love a more detailed review here at the list and maybe a couple of excerpts? Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807365509">Hi there. I haven&#39;t actually done an introduction yet, but read the list daily as well as a gazillion books about unschooling! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my favorite books on the life are David H. Albert&#39;s books. Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self Discovery; And the Skylark Sings with Me; Have fun, learn stuff, Grow: Homeschooling and the curriculum of Love. <br/>
<br/>
His books are creative non-fiction essays that use specific examples of life learning to relate to great life lessons both for him and his daughters. He also includes a great many educational, historical, political, and informative references for why they don&#39;t send their kids to school. I find it great fodder for people who want an argument. <br/>
<br/>
After reading Rue&#39;s book, my appetite was whetted, but after finishing David&#39;s I was completely sold.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345963698">I was fortunate that my first conference (when my only child at that time was three years old) was an Unschooling conference in NJ and David Albert was speaking!  We absolutely loved his talk and I think it helped dh understand how wonderful homeschooling could be.  I bought David&#39;s book &quot;And the Skylark Sings With Me&quot; and devoured it.  Although I have all three books you mentioned, that one is my favorite David Albert book.  Laurie</div>
