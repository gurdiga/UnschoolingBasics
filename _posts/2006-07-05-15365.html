<div id="ygrps-yiv-162078564">I only have a few minutes (we&#39;re camping and have free wifi but it&#39;s <br/>
unreliable!).   A friend of mine is considering homeschooling her <br/>
daughters in NC and they may be moving for less than a year to Mexico.  <br/>
Looking for NC support groups (she&#39;s just beginning, so if there&#39;s a <br/>
homeschooling group that could help her get started with the legalities <br/>
that would be great!)   I already gave her the NHEN site.  She&#39;s not at <br/>
the unschooling phase (yet)!<br/>
<br/>
If you could email me offline that would be great, I won&#39;t be able to <br/>
read the posts on the groups for a few days and I know I&#39;ll have a lot <br/>
of catching up to do when we get home, I don&#39;t want to dig for it on <br/>
the posts since they&#39;ll be moving soon.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
