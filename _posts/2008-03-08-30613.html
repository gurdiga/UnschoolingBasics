I’m not clear what the author’s viewpoint actually is. I can read it a couple of ways. Here’s the title and first paragraph. <br/>

Nursing is the biological norm for mothers and babies. <br/>
It is a relationship that links the baby&#39;s immune system to the mother&#39;s, <br/>
provides the baby with stimulation and connection while providing the mother <br/>
with stress reducing hormones. It even feeds the baby. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957260731">quick intro before I rant :) I&#39;m Cid, mama to always-unschooled  <br/>
Declan (8.5) and Torin (5)....and I live in California :)   I&#39;ve been  <br/>
on AlwaysUnschooled for a couple of years now, and have recently  <br/>
decided to sign up for a few more lists (to foster my own interests,  <br/>
as I do the boys, lol) Besides being overwhelmed by the sheer volume  <br/>
of messages coming through, I&#39;ve SO enjoyed all the great posts/ <br/>
threads and look forward to participating in discussions after I lurk  <br/>
and get a feel for the list for awhile :)<br/>
<br/>
I had to post after reading the article referred to (Bill  <br/>
Cavala...Dodo Bird).  It&#39;s been a long while that I&#39;ve felt ENRAGED  <br/>
after reading something on the internet. This guy IS A DODO BIRD, and  <br/>
I am so thankful that I&#39;ve never had to converse with anyone so  <br/>
ignorant and ridiculous in person....I think I&#39;d be speechless (and  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t happen often!) ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, Cid in CA<br/>

At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from  <br/>
another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of  <br/>
those who have lighted the flame within us.<br/>
