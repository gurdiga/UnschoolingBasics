<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915111100">I am quite hesitant to post because the other boards I belong to can <br/>
be quite honest and brutal though I know they mean well.  I am a <br/>
mother of 4 beautiful, creative, free spirits.  I have not yet made <br/>
the &quot;switch&quot; to unschooling though I am slowly adding elements to our <br/>
life.  I love the ideology of John Holt and unschooling, and there <br/>
are many moments in our daily life where I can see how unschooling <br/>
works.  I am coming to realize that learning is hard-wired and my dc <br/>
are naturally inquisitive and fearless.  Unfortunately, I am still <br/>
way too neurotic to be radical yet, but that is the direction I would <br/>
like to take.       <br/>
My question is regarding strewing. I have read several posts on it, <br/>
including Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.  I am limited on where I can place <br/>
things (we have a very small home,1000sq. ft) Currently, I have a bin <br/>
of odds and ends on a livingroom table.  I will place bits of puzzles <br/>
and prized objects on the kid&#39;s bedroom table.  Each child has a <br/>
raingutter bookshelf near their bed that I will rotate books and <br/>
such.  How often do you change out the old.  I wait and watch and if <br/>
the kids are interested and use what is it, I leave it.  If not, I <br/>
leave it out for awhile (1 -2 weeks) and then switch it around <br/>
again.  I am constantly watching and I realize that we have stuff <br/>
that never has been used.  How long should I wait and how often <br/>
should I place these things in their path before donating or tossing <br/>
them?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56516999">Hi There,<br/>
<br/>
My idea of strewing is not just limited to visually presented items. <br/>
It can be anything from the songs we listen to, to what we&#39;ll be <br/>
watching, to what shall I cook for lunch or dinner. It&#39;s about <br/>
making everything accessible. <br/>
<br/>
It is discussions like this that can actually triggers off alot of <br/>
other discussions, research or activities, which can actually lead <br/>
to picking out a cd/ dvd/ book off the shelf.   <br/>
<br/>
We have books in every corner of our home, on the sofa, on the <br/>
coffee table, on the side of the stairs. But they are all mixed up, <br/>
some are mine, some my son&#39;s, some hubbies. I don&#39;t separate them. <br/>
My son do flick thru some of my picture books. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can try mixing everyone&#39;s book into 1 common shelf/ <br/>
area. This way, everybody is welcome to pick-up any book that <br/>
catches thier attention and you don&#39;t have to rotate them. Books <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have age limitation on them. Anybody can pick up a book, <br/>
and just enjoy looking thur them. <br/>
<br/>
I have toys anywhere and everywhere that&#39;s accessible by any child. <br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean they are constantly lying on the floor, tho they <br/>
can be most of the times. But my kid&#39;s Lego is on the coffee table <br/>
that&#39;s been relegated to the corner of the living room. It&#39;s on the <br/>
dining table that is no longer in use because we prefer eating on <br/>
the sofa, in front of the tv. Infact, he and his little friends has <br/>
built an entire city out of Lego, on the dining table. <br/>
<br/>
His transformers is in a big plastic crate on the floor in a corner. <br/>
<br/>
On the dining table, we have a globe, we have game boxes stacked up, <br/>
we have shoes boxes filled with lots of interesting stuff labelled <br/>
on the side like playdoughs, army sets, batteries, more Lego bricks, <br/>
a vase of paintbrushes, a plastic tube of pens and pencil and <br/>
another stack of books with 5 boxes of mini experimental kit on top <br/>
of it. <br/>
<br/>
On my window sill, I have photographs, a microscope, a bug viewer, <br/>
an electric motor that son built, some clay model he made, a huge <br/>
model train, more books, chessmen, a vase filled with long drinking <br/>
straws, some Lego structures that he built and sold to me (LOL!!),  <br/>
<br/>
I find boxes with lids, like shoes boxes, very useful. They can be <br/>
stacked up in a corner, helping to keep things neat and tidy without <br/>
having to put it away. <br/>
<br/>
And of course, the tv is always on either on his cartoon channels or <br/>
my documentary/ news channels.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my strewing. I like evrything to be close at hand, I don&#39;t <br/>
like having to climb and take something off the top of the wardrobe <br/>
or go to the shed for my kid&#39;s bike. This way, we can into alot of <br/>
things without any obstacles/ fuss.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great question. I find myself asking it all the time. I go by how<br/>
long have we had the object/book/whatnot and how likely I think it may be<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I have some books about science experiments. The kids haven&#39;t<br/>
looked at them in months because they have been into other things. But I<br/>
know that winter is nearing and the colder weather means more indoor times.<br/>
They will likely use them in the next few months. We have the space so I<br/>
keep them.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is ds5 was into Power Rangers but now he isn&#39;t. So I<br/>
gathered up all the PR stuff that hasn&#39;t been touched in months and asked<br/>
his thoughts on moving it out. At first he wanted to keep it. So I set the<br/>
box aside. A few days later he came and told me that he&#39;d like to give it to<br/>
a friend that loves PR. So we did.<br/>
<br/>
Other examples are things I pick up for my kids that just don&#39;t interest<br/>
them. I let it hang out for a while, maybe even directly show it to them. If<br/>
there is no interest I let it go. I pick up free junk all the time so there<br/>
is constant flow in our house. And there are 5 humans of various ages and<br/>
interests. I try not to form attachments to things *I* think my kids<br/>
*should* like or be interested in. (like an awesome bird calling tape) If I<br/>
didn&#39;t get it for me and they don&#39;t want it, it goes. Freecycle and<br/>
craigslist are great place to get rid of things and try things out.<br/>
<br/>
About placing things in their path; I don&#39;t think that this is something I<br/>
even think about (until you write it). I just show them cool stuff I find.<br/>
More often they are with me and pick up cool stuff along with me. If not<br/>
(dd11 usually stays home) she greets me to see what cool stuff I have. I<br/>
have been finding her amazing clothes lately which makes her super happy.<br/>
Otherwise our home is laid out to live in. We have books, toys, games, odds<br/>
and ends, kitchen stuff, water toys, outdoor toys, you name it hanging out<br/>
to be used in one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
My mother always talks about how much *stuff* we have in our house. She has<br/>
suggested we minimize and make it easier to clean etc. But we like it like<br/>
this, full of life and creativity. We even have a project room full of weird<br/>
stuff and art supplies.<br/>
<br/>
My kids also make amazing discoveries when we have &quot;clean out&quot; days. I&#39;ll<br/>
pick out a stack of books that seems like no one wants and ask everyone to<br/>
go through them before I donate them. I typically find a human or two<br/>
sitting and reading soon after. This works for toys as well. It is fun like<br/>
an adventure in its own. We unearth cool stuff.<br/>

<br/>
LOL! That happens here, too. I half-jokingly call it &quot;unstrewing.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just standing all the books back up on the book shelf, or <br/>
neatly sorting the toys back into the bins (Mo loves to use the <br/>
bins...) has the same effect as getting something entirely new - <br/>
hey, mom, look at this! Wow! Cool! Oh, you like that? We&#39;ve had it <br/>
for five years, y&#39;know.<br/>
<br/>
One of the questions I ask before I get rid of something is how much <br/>
it interests *me*. Is this something I&#39;d like to read/try if I <br/>
ever &quot;find the time&quot;? Those I&#39;ll keep, even if my kids seem to have <br/>
outgrown them - like making goofy stuff with pipe cleaners. I just <br/>
know that One Day I&#39;ll &quot;find the time&quot; to do that! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Going shopping together, or looking through catalogs, is a kind <br/>
of &quot;strewing&quot;. Mo and I did that last night - the xmas catalogs are <br/>
starting to come out and we looked and looked, talked about this and <br/>
that, do you want one? could we make our own? There were some things <br/>
that reminded me of when I was a kid, and we talked about that - <br/>
hey, I had one of those! or my uncle made one of these when he was a <br/>
teenager... all sorts of fun family stories came up. <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing to remember about strewing is to be open to <br/>
possibilities. A picture of a tea cup can lead to buying a tea-set, <br/>
or it could lead to learning about Japanese tea ceremony, or it <br/>
could lead to a conversation about ceramics and what&#39;s &quot;bone china&quot; <br/>
and on to talking about the Great Wall of China and panda bears and <br/>
making a new blanket for Teddy. <br/>
