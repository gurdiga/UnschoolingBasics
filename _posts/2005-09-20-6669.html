<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071963552">I totally understand about hating math.  Basic math is ok, but <br/>
anything beyond that I&#39;m lost.  My freshman year in hs, I had a <br/>
algebra teacher who would call me stupid and would ask me why I <br/>
didn&#39;t get it.  It was very humiliating to say the least.  The only <br/>
way I got through college math was with the help of my husband.  He <br/>
would have to walk me through the questions at night.  As an RN I <br/>
don&#39;t even use that crap, ok maybe a little, but hardly.<br/>
<br/>
My husband on the other hand is a very slow reader, hates to read <br/>
and in 23 years of marriage I have never seen him read a book.  I&#39;m <br/>
just beginning to understand that somewhere he probably was <br/>
traumatized like I was with math.  I love to read even though I <br/>
didn&#39;t start reading until I was 9.  The teachers and my mom were <br/>
worried, but for some reason it didn&#39;t bother me or at least that I <br/>
can remember.  <br/>
<br/>
Our dtr was a early reader but because she spent 4 years in ps it <br/>
has nearly destoryed any love for reading.  At 11 she is beginning <br/>
to read again without any coercion on my part.<br/>

Well, at least when you DO use it, it&#39;s applied directly to a real life  <br/>
situation, and not printed in some book and meaning nothing but a bunch of  <br/>
letters and numbers! I think if all the complicated math had been presented to  me <br/>
in real life situations, where it would actually be useful, I would have  <br/>
&quot;gotten&quot; it easier. Like the Accounting... I GOT that, it was REAL...   <br/>
ab+2c(a/24+38c) means NOTHING to me...<br/>
