Greetings from the 2008 Unschooling Conference in Madison, Wisconsin.<br/>
<br/>
Our 2007 conference, the first unschooling conference ever in Wisconsin, was a huge success!  It was a very energizing and renewing experience.  Participants took full advantage of the small size of the conference and the intimate atmosphere to connect and have in-depth conversations with other conference attendees and presenters.  Feedback was very enthusiastic, and many people asked for another conference in 2008, so here we go.  <br/>
<br/>
The 2008 Unschooling Conference, January 12, will feature a keynote address by Manish Jain of Shikshantar: The Peoplesâ Institute for Rethinking Development and Education, in Udaipur, India. We are looking forward to another exciting and fulfilling day of connecting with unschoolers, and expanding our unschooling horizons.<br/>
<br/>
For more information and to download a registration form, please visit our website:   www.unschoolingconference.com.  We look forward to seeing everyone in January!<br/>
