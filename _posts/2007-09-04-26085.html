<div id="ygrps-yiv-794300628">I noticed the following post on my local Freecycle list.  I offered a <br/>
website resource, and they agreed.  I need one or two sites that won&#39;t <br/>
scare off someone completely new to the idea of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply directly to my email (you can copy to the list as well, if <br/>
desired) as I&#39;m on digest and would rather get a response to this mom <br/>
right away.<br/>

I have a huge family and with no good help from my childhood, we need<br/>
help knowing ideas to do with the kids. Like exp:<br/>
How to keep home life in order?<br/>
How to help kids with homework?<br/>
How to help kids adjust to having two homes?<br/>
How much tv is to much?<br/>
How much should kids get out doors to play?<br/>
How to be a PTA mom?<br/>
Things of this sort in any parenting book would be great. I can learn<br/>
from most any book. Thanks in advance for the HUGE help!<br/>
