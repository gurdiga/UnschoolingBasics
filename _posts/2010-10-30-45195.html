<div id="ygrps-yiv-975758075">My dd has recently started complaining that her legs feel weird at night, kind of like an uncomfortable, burning, tingly sensation on the skin, not the deeper pain felt with muscle cramps. She is having trouble sleeping through the night and says the sheets &quot;hurt&quot; her because they are so smooth. I have also had similar experiences, especially with some clothes touching my legs, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a genetic thing or what. We&#39;ve tried switching to Free & Clear detergents(which helps me), but so far nothing is helping her. We&#39;ve also tried putting down a towel or blanket on her bed and that seems to help for a while, but I&#39;d really like to know what is going on. Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100576069">Is it RLS?  (Restless Leg Syndrome)   I have this and it drives me nuts. From wikipedia: &quot;The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations. Those with RLS have a hard time describing them, using words like: uncomfortable, &quot;antsy&quot;, electrical, creeping, painful, itching, pins and needles, pulling, creepy-crawly, ants inside the legs and numbness.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s very different than leg cramps -- for me it&#39;s creepy-crawly / antsy, and I have to move my legs. Happens to me mostly at night and I have a hard time falling asleep because of it sometimes.<br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like you need to chat w/your doc to see if they have ideas.  For a switch in sheets, my kids have sensitive skin and really, really love their fleece sheets. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Sheets/Fleece,/material,/1/subcat.html">http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Sheets/Fleece,/material,/1/subcat.html</a>  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561320583">I have always had some of the same issues with fabrics and other things on my <br/>
skin. When I was little all the sensory information was not what it is today. I <br/>
had to have all the tags removed from all my clothing and was restricted to only <br/>
cotton. My son also has some of these issues and of course some of his own ways <br/>
of dealing with sensory input. We did the OT thing for a while but I found that <br/>
really with some reading and communication we could figure out what he lacked or <br/>
needed more of. I have read a lot about this just very curious cause when I <br/>
really started looking closer I found that I had a ton of these so called <br/>
&quot;issues&quot;  I think honestly it is just a hyper sensitive thing, perhaps <br/>
neurological. I was reading some information about the nerves of the skin just <br/>
being in hyper drive with feeling sensations. So what may be a little itchy <br/>
material to one, this person feels like a million bugs are all over them. I am <br/>
not a doctor that is for sure but here is some food for thought from my personal <br/>
and sons experience thus far. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The free and clear soap is better but I found that the detergent with no <br/>
sulfates/chemical free is easier to tolerated, seven generation is one. But <br/>
honestly just a mixture of baking soda and vinegar is GREAT, more affordable but <br/>
not to much baking soda because it will be rough if not rinsed all the way.  <br/>
Stubborn stains can be lifted with hydrogen peroxide versus spray n wash<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We use only cotton one because it breaths and two because it is the only thing <br/>
my skin will withstand. I know this sounds weird but used cotton sheets may be <br/>
better for her because they have been broken in. I am not this sensitive now but <br/>
once was. Also try to get sheets for her that are not full of color, the dye is <br/>
a chemical and does transfer, she may have an allergy to one of them. They do <br/>
sale organic linens but they are $, we just get white.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Then maybe try stimulating her legs before bed, rub them down with warm olive <br/>
oil. This kinda lets her nerves know they are going to be touched then the <br/>
sensation of the sheets rubbing on her is not so stimulating. If she does not <br/>
like you doing it then maybe it would feel better to her if she rubbed her own <br/>
legs before bed. There is this brushing tech for the skin we have not used it as <br/>
massage is very welcomed in our home and helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps some and I hope she can find some comfort. It honestly is one <br/>
of those things were you just kinda experiment and then she will find what works <br/>
for her and stick with it, or at least that was me<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

if she would like to try that.  It is pretty simple and helps my son&#39;s<br/>

I have tried many of the suggestions, both from here and also from my broader web search. A couple of the things that did seem to help (but unfortunately not eliminate) her symptoms were brushing her legs before bed, putting Eucerin cream on her legs which seems to prevent them from sliding around and irritating her skin, extra potassium and calcium supplements, and also putting a bar of Ivory soap under the top sheet (weird, but proven true). I am also wondering if it has something to do with her laptop. Somedays it seems that holding the laptop in her lap is irritating to her skin and makes her uncomfortable. I am going to buy a better lapboard for her tomorrow and see if that makes a difference (this also made me wonder about her heating blanket...  maybe she can &quot;feel&quot; the electricity?). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934262303">hi there, i know i am a lurker and reader and never reply. it is a special<br/>
brush, you cant use any brush. my son gets brushed every 2 hours from the<br/>
time he wakes until bedtime, we have been doing it for 6 months and i am<br/>
just now seeing a teeny tiny tiny difference. its never a magic fix, nothing<br/>
is, it takes time for the therapies to work, but they do. it is a special<br/>
brush that the therapist gives. my son is now ready for his next brush in a<br/>
few weeks they say, im excited, i doubt he will be. then in 3 months they<br/>
move onto vibration. my son is 2 1/2yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
i go to this site ALOT, i get their email updates and I get great info from<br/>
them. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ourjourneythruautism.com/">http://www.ourjourneythruautism.com/</a>  they just had a whole month of<br/>
sensory awareness and shared tons of activites to help the children.<br/>
