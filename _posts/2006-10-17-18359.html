<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031648776">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling.  I agree with the need to raise HAPPY, <br/>
healthy, curious kids.  Three weeks ago I pulled my kids from school <br/>
for a few reasons.  My daughter is 8yrs old and she seems to have <br/>
had the zest for learning and life sucked out of her by the school <br/>
system  BUT I am confident that she will regain that zest for life <br/>
and will do fine because she can read and write.  My son who is 5 <br/>
1/2 still has his drive for learning and investigating intact (only <br/>
in school system for 1 yr) BUT he CANNOT read and write.  What I am <br/>
concerned about is will he really learn to read by living life and <br/>
having stories read to him?  Do I need to sit down with him and <br/>
teach him about phonics etc..?  I know I need to trust in my kids <br/>
but it seems hard to believe that they can learn the basics in <br/>
reading, writing and arithmetic through unschooling.  Does it <br/>
actually work????<br/>
<br/>
Any help here would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sue</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959858614">Yes, it actually &quot;works&quot; - I&#39;ve got an 8 yr old who has never been <br/>
schooled and he is doing just fine. He might not know all the <br/>
tidy &#39;packets &#39;o information&#39; that all the schooled kids have but <br/>
neither do they have the real life usable information he has <br/>
accumulated. Yes, he can read. Yes, he can form letters and is <br/>
currently interested in how stuff is spelled. Yes, he understands <br/>
numbers, though he hasn&#39;t sucked all the fun out of them by <br/>
memorizing the &#39;tables&#39; - we&#39;ve got them on the chalkboard (+ and x) <br/>
by his request so he can refer to it whenever he needs/wants to. He <br/>
also can handle basic tools competently and is currently intrigued <br/>
by the Periodic Table of Elements, and interested in Dr. Who, Star <br/>
Trek, and nutritional information on foods.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind is that reading (and writing and math) are <br/>
not ends in themselves, as schools would have it, but rather they <br/>
are tools, just like a hammer or screwdriver, to be used as needed <br/>
for a particular task. Do you pull out a hammer and do &#39;hammering <br/>
practice&#39; just in case you might need it next year? Reading, too, is <br/>
not limited to books - it&#39;s on road signs, and grocery store <br/>
shelves, and product packages, and websites, and videogames, and TV <br/>
listings and closed captioning/subtitles, and all sorts of stuff <br/>
besides books. So, when you are looking at his reading ability, <br/>
don&#39;t just look at whether he&#39;s picked up a book but whether he can <br/>
find the Stop signs or the Apple Jacks or whatever as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600728186">I&#39;ve got a five yo right now who is learning to read, without  <br/>
teaching. He&#39;s learning from being read to, whether it&#39;s books, video  <br/>
games, road signs, menu&#39;s or recipes. Those are the ones that top my  <br/>
mind right now, he WANTS to use those things, and asks us to read  <br/>
them to him. He&#39;s gotten quite a few sight words down...enough to  <br/>
play animal crossing without someone constantly reading to him. Best  <br/>
of all he&#39;s experimenting with letters and sounds, so he&#39;ll write  <br/>
letters to us, with the ones he knows the pronunciation of (started  <br/>
with &#39;s&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, and &#39;m&#39;, and asks us to read it aloud. He laughs when  <br/>
we pronounce it phonetically. We also write a lot for him, since he  <br/>
loves to tell stories, and send them to people as letters. That&#39;s  <br/>
been a big impetus for him, because he likes to look over what we&#39;ve  <br/>
written and make sure we&#39;re spelling right (he knows &#39;gold&#39;,  <br/>
&#39;dragon&#39;, &#39;cowboy&#39;, those types of words.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one should be expecting a 5 1/2 yo to be reading and writing. Lots  <br/>
of people do but they shouldn&#39;t. It just makes them unhappy and makes  <br/>
the 5 1/2 yos who can&#39;t unhappy and rewards the ones who can for  <br/>
something they have no control over. It&#39;s like celebrating a 9 mo who  <br/>
can walk as though they had some choice about it and being upset with  <br/>
a 18 mo who can&#39;t as though *they* had a choice about that.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. Why would a 5 yo need to read or write to do 5 yo  <br/>
things?<br/>
<br/>
What people fear is that it takes years of practice to learn to read  <br/>
and write. But that&#39;s only true if kids are forced to do reading  <br/>
practice when they don&#39;t want to or need to and before they&#39;re really  <br/>
ready to even make it work.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids typically pick up reading anywhere between 4-12.  <br/>
(Some even a bit earlier. Some even a bit later.) But an unschooled  <br/>
child who learns at 12 isn&#39;t 8 years behind a 12 yo who learned at 4.  <br/>
Within a few months the later reader is reading at age level just  <br/>
like the earlier reader. Soon they&#39;re indistinguishable from each  <br/>
other. Just as no one can tell which person walked at 9 mos and which  <br/>
walked at 18 mos.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I am<br/>
&gt; concerned about is will he really learn to read by living life and<br/>
&gt; having stories read to him?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. As long as he doesn&#39;t feel your worry or pressure from you that  <br/>
would attach unpleasant feelings to reading. Make the experience  <br/>
pleasurable for him. Give him good associations with the written word.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I need to sit down with him and<br/>
&gt; teach him about phonics etc..?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ick. No.<br/>
<br/>
If he asks, just answer his questions simply. If you know a clever  <br/>
trick, pass it along but judge by his attitude how much of that he  <br/>
finds interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know I need to trust in my kids<br/>
&gt; but it seems hard to believe that they can learn the basics in<br/>
&gt; reading, writing and arithmetic through unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yeah, it&#39;s hard to believe. We *have* to believe the rigors of  <br/>
school are necessary or all that time and effort we spent in school  <br/>
and doing work for school was wasted. To stay sane, kids buy into the  <br/>
belief too. Otherwise they know they&#39;re wasting their childhoods :- <br/>
( The really unhappy, angry ones never accept that delusion. Not sure  <br/>
which of those two choices is better :-/<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately they&#39;re not the only two choices!<br/>
<br/>
Math, I think, is the hardest because real life math bears very  <br/>
little resemblance to school math. And when it does resemble school  <br/>
math, there&#39;s so little of it -- considering all the hours and hours  <br/>
of instruction and practice we did in school -- that it&#39;s a drip when  <br/>
we think they need an ocean.<br/>
<br/>
But real math is about learning how numbers work, not memorizing  <br/>
abstract facts about them. Real math is absorbing what percentages  <br/>
are useful for from video games and shopping and art software and  <br/>
computers. It&#39;s learning how fluid numbers are and how they can be  <br/>
manipulated to give you the answer you&#39;re trying to get to. (E.g.,  <br/>
it&#39;s a whole lot more difficult to add 97+26 in your head than it is  <br/>
to recognize that 97 could easily be turned into 100 by taking 3 from  <br/>
26 and turning the problem into 100+23.)<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, kids learn math theory. They truly understand what  <br/>
numbers do (and can do) in a practical gut-feeling way. Picking up  <br/>
the formal notation for what they already understand is then very  <br/>
easy. Kids in school have to work so hard because they don&#39;t  <br/>
understand what the purpose of it is. They&#39;re basically practicing to  <br/>
get it in by rote. Schools *hope* that they&#39;ll develop an  <br/>
understanding but there&#39;s no guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
As for writing, once he&#39;s a teen (and often before!) and is IMing and  <br/>
playing online video games and emailing friends, he&#39;ll *have to*  <br/>
figure out the essence of communicating through the written word  <br/>
because he&#39;ll be writing for  a real purpose: to get his thoughts  <br/>
into someone else. It probably won&#39;t look like &quot;real&quot; writing but it  <br/>
will be the important essence of it. And the technical aspects of  <br/>
punctuation are easily learned. But also offer to take dictation of  <br/>
any stories he wants to tell. If he wants to illustrate them, print  <br/>
them out with lots of room for pictures and bind them up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it<br/>
&gt; actually work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, actually, all our kids are total nincompoops and the percentage  <br/>
of unschoolers who have gone onto college or hold a job is so small  <br/>
as to be laughable ;-) We just think the philosophy is really cool  <br/>
and want to spread it around even though it doesn&#39;t work. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081852790">Ah, divine timing, indeed!<br/>
This thread could not come at a better time. Here&#39;s my story:<br/>
My mother, a recovering alcoholic who stumbles and falls often on her journey, called me last night, while drinking (which she knows she is not supposed to do, I&#39;ve set that boundary with her) and asks if the boys are sleeping and if she could come over.  <br/>
No, the boys are awake, we were all just in bed reading together, but she can come over when they fall asleep.<br/>
Then she says &quot;i&#39;m scared, honey&quot;  I hear &quot;i need you, karen, i&#39;m struggling with something in *my* life&quot;.  Oh, no.  What she&#39;s scared about is that my 7yo (8 in january) isn&#39;t reading.  <br/>
I&#39;ll spare you all the details of our very short conversation, but I finally hung up on her when she said &quot;if the state ever found out, karen, that you are &#39;homeschooling&#39; and not teaching him anything, they could take your kids away&#39;.  <br/>
So, for those of you who have children who read great at 4yo!  Good!  For those of you whose kiddos don&#39;t read til their 12, great!  <br/>
My ds doesn&#39;t seem much interested in reading on his own just yet.  Occassionally, he&#39;ll ask me what something says, and I tell him.  I truly don&#39;t think he&#39;s developmentally ready to put all the pieces together right *now*.  <br/>
So, my concern is, should I be doing something more?  I don&#39;t want my child to feel &#39;less&#39;.  (and believe me, no more unsupervised visits with g/ma for a while, cuz she&#39;ll be the one to make him feel that way, like somethings wrong with him).  <br/>
I know nothing is wrong with him.  I truly know that.  I just want to make sure I am doing everything I can to help him.  I read about all the amazing things people on this list are doing, what they&#39;re children are up to and interested in, and I feel like I&#39;m falling short.  <br/>
I&#39;m not devaluing what my children enjoy doing, which is simply playing.  <br/>
What I need is a hug and a pat on the back, and some words of calming wisdom.<br/>

It&#39;s a &quot;lightswtich skill.&quot;  It&#39;s one of those skills that until they<br/>
are ready for it the switch will not turn on.  They may be able to<br/>
work out the sounds of the letters but they are not reading.  There<br/>
are many children on this list who have learned to read without<br/>
official &quot;real&quot; lessons.  Just everyday being surrounded by words.<br/>
Read to him, with him, for him until he is able to read himself.<br/>
There are several families on this list who had children who did not<br/>
read until they were 9, 10, or older who went from sounding out<br/>
s-t-o-p to reading chapter books in a matter of weeks and who now love<br/>
reading.  my own middle child didn&#39;t start reading until she was 8<br/>
years old and did  just that!  One weekshe *couldn&#39;t* read and the<br/>
next week she couldn&#39;t get enough material to read!  No pressure, no<br/>
challenge, just waiting for the right moment for it all to make sense<br/>
to her.<br/>

Here is your pat on the back, and a big hug.  You are<br/>
doing nothing wrong.  I think that you spending time<br/>
with your boys reading to them is great.  Eventually,<br/>
they will start to read on their own.   I think you<br/>
should stop worrying, and enjoy your kids.  When they<br/>
are ready to read, you will know.  If you try to make<br/>
them do more, they may not want to read at all.  (I<br/>
hope this makes sense.)  It will all come in time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a way, it does take years to learn to read and write - it starts <br/>
when a child is born and takes however many years until the pieces <br/>
click into place. Not years of phonics practice (bleh) but years of <br/>
being exposed to language. On the one hand, it can seem to <br/>
happen &#39;overnight&#39;. On the other, it can percolate internally for <br/>
years before it becomes visible.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the tool becomes useful to the person and they start <br/>
using it more and developing proficiency at using it - it seemed <br/>
like DS went from 0 to 60 in a matter of weeks (from not reading to <br/>
reading Captain Underpants) but really it was in little bits and <br/>
pieces over time, a connection here, a connection there, until it <br/>
all fit and made sense inside him. Best as I can figure, he handled <br/>
words the way he handles food - get a big bite in and then let it <br/>
digest into proteins and carbs and minerals and all that can be used <br/>
for whatever he needs to use them for. Nowadays, he may hole up in <br/>
bed in the evening and read a bit ... or not. Sometimes he goes for <br/>
weeks on end without reading *a book* - reading is still happening <br/>
though - last week, we went to a new market (checking out a local co-<br/>
op to see if we want in). I sent him to go get pasta sauce (within <br/>
eyesight at the other end of the same aisle I was in). I could see <br/>
him out the corner of my eye checking one jar then another then <br/>
another (I thought maybe he was looking for a familiar brand name) <br/>
then he came back sans sauce. He said they all had too much sodium <br/>
so he didn&#39;t get any. He was *reading* the label. (BTW I went back <br/>
with him and we hunted a bit more and found a low sodium organic <br/>
brand).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115635941">I have lots of e-mails to catch up on so I&#39;m not sure what everyone&#39;s elses response has been.  My 6 year old daughter started reading like she&#39;d been reading for years at age 4.......I don&#39;t think it happens that way for most kids.  My 8 year old really did not start reading until just recently.  She memorized a bunch of words I think just to please her teachers at public school, but she really did not have a grasp on it.  I know plenty of kids in public school that can&#39;t read or are really struggling, so going to school does not guarantee one will read either at a certain prescribed age......which is what schools want them to do.  But the beauty of homeschooling and especially &quot;unschooling&quot; is the child can do it on &quot;their&quot; schedule, not someone elses.  A really good recent example is my 8 year old with Math.  In public school she hated it and stunk at it.  I think because she always felt stressed and under pressure to get the math done.  Now she will sit and play with<br/>
 Math manipulatives for hours, and get a blank piece of paper and write math problems down by the dozens.......all on her own, nothing to do with me asking her.<br/>
   <br/>
  Recently I read an article about how &quot;playing&quot; has been lost in our society.  It said parents are so busy &quot;overscheduling&quot; their kids with hockey, karate, dance lesson, etc. that they don&#39;t realize their kids need to just play.  The best memories I had as a child were of &quot;playing&quot;.  When my girls were in school, and would come home to a bunch of homework I kept asking &quot;when do they get to play? and just be kids?&quot;  I had many reasons to pull them out of school, but one of those reasons was so that they could just play.  My kids are gonna have plenty of time when they are adults to be stressed out and worried about bills, and all those adult things.  Right now I just want them to be kids, and do kid things.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Oh, those phone calls from relatives are just wonderful aren&#39;t they?  My MIL, who also drinks tos much also calls us and all kinds of things come out of her unfiltered mouth.....one of them being how much she disagrees with us over the homeschooling.  So here&#39;s you hug and pat on the back.  Keep up the good work, you are doing the right thing.<br/>

          Ah, divine timing, indeed!<br/>
This thread could not come at a better time. Here&#39;s my story:<br/>
My mother, a recovering alcoholic who stumbles and falls often on her journey, called me last night, while drinking (which she knows she is not supposed to do, I&#39;ve set that boundary with her) and asks if the boys are sleeping and if she could come over. <br/>
No, the boys are awake, we were all just in bed reading together, but she can come over when they fall asleep.<br/>
Then she says &quot;i&#39;m scared, honey&quot; I hear &quot;i need you, karen, i&#39;m struggling with something in *my* life&quot;. Oh, no. What she&#39;s scared about is that my 7yo (8 in january) isn&#39;t reading. <br/>
I&#39;ll spare you all the details of our very short conversation, but I finally hung up on her when she said &quot;if the state ever found out, karen, that you are &#39;homeschooling&#39; and not teaching him anything, they could take your kids away&#39;. <br/>
So, for those of you who have children who read great at 4yo! Good! For those of you whose kiddos don&#39;t read til their 12, great! <br/>
My ds doesn&#39;t seem much interested in reading on his own just yet. Occassionally, he&#39;ll ask me what something says, and I tell him. I truly don&#39;t think he&#39;s developmentally ready to put all the pieces together right *now*. <br/>
So, my concern is, should I be doing something more? I don&#39;t want my child to feel &#39;less&#39;. (and believe me, no more unsupervised visits with g/ma for a while, cuz she&#39;ll be the one to make him feel that way, like somethings wrong with him). <br/>
I know nothing is wrong with him. I truly know that. I just want to make sure I am doing everything I can to help him. I read about all the amazing things people on this list are doing, what they&#39;re children are up to and interested in, and I feel like I&#39;m falling short. <br/>
I&#39;m not devaluing what my children enjoy doing, which is simply playing. <br/>
What I need is a hug and a pat on the back, and some words of calming wisdom.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Learning to read...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it actually &quot;works&quot; - I&#39;ve got an 8 yr old who has never been <br/>
schooled and he is doing just fine. He might not know all the <br/>
tidy &#39;packets &#39;o information&#39; that all the schooled kids have but <br/>
neither do they have the real life usable information he has <br/>
accumulated. Yes, he can read. Yes, he can form letters and is <br/>
currently interested in how stuff is spelled. Yes, he understands <br/>
numbers, though he hasn&#39;t sucked all the fun out of them by <br/>
memorizing the &#39;tables&#39; - we&#39;ve got them on the chalkboard (+ and x) <br/>
by his request so he can refer to it whenever he needs/wants to. He <br/>
also can handle basic tools competently and is currently intrigued <br/>
by the Periodic Table of Elements, and interested in Dr. Who, Star <br/>
Trek, and nutritional information on foods.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind is that reading (and writing and math) are <br/>
not ends in themselves, as schools would have it, but rather they <br/>
are tools, just like a hammer or screwdriver, to be used as needed <br/>
for a particular task. Do you pull out a hammer and do &#39;hammering <br/>
practice&#39; just in case you might need it next year? Reading, too, is <br/>
not limited to books - it&#39;s on road signs, and grocery store <br/>
shelves, and product packages, and websites, and videogames, and TV <br/>
listings and closed captioning/subtitle s, and all sorts of stuff <br/>
besides books. So, when you are looking at his reading ability, <br/>
don&#39;t just look at whether he&#39;s picked up a book but whether he can <br/>
find the Stop signs or the Apple Jacks or whatever as well.<br/>

          Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling. I agree with the need to raise HAPPY, <br/>
healthy, curious kids. Three weeks ago I pulled my kids from school <br/>
for a few reasons. My daughter is 8yrs old and she seems to have <br/>
had the zest for learning and life sucked out of her by the school <br/>
system BUT I am confident that she will regain that zest for life <br/>
and will do fine because she can read and write. My son who is 5 <br/>
1/2 still has his drive for learning and investigating intact (only <br/>
in school system for 1 yr) BUT he CANNOT read and write. What I am <br/>
concerned about is will he really learn to read by living life and <br/>
having stories read to him? Do I need to sit down with him and <br/>
teach him about phonics etc..? I know I need to trust in my kids <br/>
but it seems hard to believe that they can learn the basics in <br/>
reading, writing and arithmetic through unschooling. Does it <br/>
actually work????<br/>
<br/>
Any help here would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111779020">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
My experiences... and a question.<br/>
<br/>
My 15yo spontaneously read at around 5, 13yo (even with formal HS lessons!) didn&#39;t catch on until 8-9, 11yo started working it out around 6.5, 9yo devoured books at 5, 7yo same.  Now my 5.5 dd has NO interest in book reading.  She writes a lot of stuff though, especially copies book titles, our names, and dictates to me for letters to daddy (overseas working).  I think dd 3yo has more interest in reading and writing, and seems to be moving along more quickly than her sister.  What I mean is, she will frequently ask what a word says, how to write such and such, names of brekky cereals, etc.  We read a lot in our home.  We don&#39;t worship books, but love to learn about stuff, also to be entertained by books.  In fact, I&#39;ll often pick up non fiction books from the $2 store for a treat<br/>
<br/>
Now my question:-)<br/>
<br/>
What are people&#39;s thoughts on name tags?  If I printed out words and placed them on items around the house, just for them to be there, to look at, but not to drill, would it be useful to &#39;yet to&#39; readers?   I feel like it is similar to labelling my food tins. Sugar, flour, noodles, milk powder etc.  What is the value of this?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The most important question: Does she think it&#39;s interesting?<br/>
<br/>
I remember someone said she labeled things in the house and then  <br/>
after a while switched the labels around. The kids were challenged to  <br/>
put them on the right object -- because *the kids* thought it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s ready to read, the labels might be interesting because  <br/>
she&#39;ll be unconsciously curious to connect the sounds of words to how  <br/>
they look. If she&#39;s not, she&#39;ll probably tune them out. (We&#39;ve had  <br/>
many things labeled in Japanese for years and I honestly still can&#39;t  <br/>
remember what is what ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Are they necessary? Not in the least. They can be fun for some kids.  <br/>
They can feel like a quiz to some kids. They can be just so much  <br/>
paper scattered about for other kids. They can be a germ of an idea  <br/>
to label their own things. (Though don&#39;t be surprised if their labels  <br/>
have nothing to do with standard language ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is, &quot;It depends.&quot; It depends on whether she thinks it&#39;s  <br/>
interesting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are already surrounded by words.  Take a look around your house at<br/>
all the words that are already visible.  You mentioned food<br/>
containers.  There are tons of those eggs, milk, oatmeal, cans of<br/>
corn, 85/20 ground beef, Boca, ramen noodles, tomatoe sauce, etc etc<br/>
etc.  There are words in your car, there are words all along the<br/>
streets (even if they do happen to say Stop, yield, wrong way,<br/>
mcdonald&#39;s, pizza hut, etc.)  There are words in our places of<br/>
worship.  There are words everywhere.  Do you really feel the need to<br/>
add more words to your lives?  I would hazard that when you first put<br/>
the words up that they would be a novelty and within a few days or<br/>
weeks they would blend into just part of what makes up your house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062095924">I think that even though she&#39;s not reading books, she has an interest  <br/>
in language just from what you&#39;ve written. She may never be a person  <br/>
who reads books for fun, or she may be like your child that didn&#39;t  <br/>
start reading til 9yo. That&#39;s four years off from now, so I&#39;d let it  <br/>
be. She may start reading Dickens tomorrow. So what if the three yo  <br/>
passes her? They are each their own person.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched four kids now pass by Breanna, it doesn&#39;t make her any  <br/>
less the person she is, it just emphasizes that she is her own person  <br/>
and that she&#39;ll achieve what she&#39;s meant to be. If I make it a big  <br/>
deal, all it does is damage her self esteem and damage the children  <br/>
who happen to have achieved one thing before another child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027454420">So right, Melissa!  The kids look to their prents or significant adult in their lives for cues as to how to react....If it&#39;s cool with you that your daughter has not read until.....it will be cool with the rest of the kids. They will follow your lead.   I am just reading Hold On To Your Kids:  Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate....<br/>
  A great point that they make in the book is that the modeling of the adult who kids have bonded to needs to be the most important example...and that is the natural way of humans (although not the &quot;norm&quot; in our culture today).  Your   post made me think about what an important role we have in setting the tone for our kids becoming who they are, when it&#39;s right for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695295076">My daughter Emily who came out of school at Spring Break in K (almost 8 years ago) read somewhere between 10 3/4 and 11 1/2. She will be 13 in a month. I had noticed that she was reading things online and I had been waiting patiently with trust thanks to the people here and on other lists. I really wanted her to read and enjoy it. I read very early and it is one of my favorite things to do. My desire for her to read was not because I thought that reading is &quot;good for you&quot; &quot;It teaches you&quot; or &quot;how else is she going to LEARN anything?&quot;. I wanted to be able to talk about and share one of my loves with her. If she didn&#39;t share that love, that would have been ok too. We have plenty of things in common even if we don&#39;t share the love of stories.<br/>
Anyway, I wanted her to understand that for some people, reading is a hobby as well as a tool and can be very enjoyable. So I went to a book store and picked up Are You There God? It&#39;s Me Margaret. By Judy Blume, One of my all time favorite books from when I was a girl.<br/>
I literally thought, &quot;If this doesn&#39;t work, she&#39;s just not that into it.&quot;<br/>
She loved it, read the whole thing. She found joy in reading a story just for fun.<br/>
She went on to read more Judy Blume, and then switched to young adult chick lit.<br/>
Cool! fun light books about young women and relationships.<br/>
Emily is also taking a World history class with some other homeschoolers. She&#39;s the youngest one in the class, most are eclectically schooled teens prepping for college and keeping transcripts. She reads the textbook chapters with ease. What&#39;s amazing is that there are no ulteriors. No have to&#39;s, no deadlines. This is all for fun.<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach her to read. She learned in the same way that she learned to talk. She listened, she made connections between sounds and body language, she tried making sounds, analyzed the responses, adjusted and tried again.<br/>
In reading she listened to sounds coming out of peoples mouths, noticed patterns on paper (or screens) tried decyphering the sounds, analyzed the responses, adjusted and tried again.<br/>
My son who is seven is starting this journey. He has been completely unschooled since birth. There is a difference as he is not put off by anything that could remotely be attached to school style learning.I would guess that he will read a little earlier as he had no healing to do.  But, whenever!<br/>
It&#39;s all good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976948986">When my first child was born, I read a book called How To Teach Your Baby To Read.   (Long time before I learned of unschooling).  He explained how children learn and how the young eyes worked.  For young children, he said the words needed to be very large(3&quot;) and thicker lined.  He said to just use the word not the letters as letters have no meaning by themselves.  Between the ages of 1-2, I made up cards with the body parts and household stuff and put the body parts over the changing table and the other labels where appropreate.  I didn&#39;t drill my daughter but we did play fun games with them.  (Same as one would play head and shoulders and such with their babies.)  That same child, now sixteen, now labels the house in whatever language she is currently studying (Japanese, Spanish, German, & French..)  <br/>
<br/>
For my son, I would blame video games for most of his learning to read.  I have been amazed at just how much he has learned from the games he plays.  Comics are also an incredible way for kids to learn to read.  My son loves Calvin and Hobbes and On The Rocks  at<br/>
www.funbrain.com .  I&#39;d say example is the best way to encourage reading.  If you read, they will read.<br/>

&gt; What are people&#39;s thoughts on name tags? If I printed out words and placed them on items around the house, just for them to be there, to look at, but not to drill, would it be useful to &#39;yet to&#39; readers? I feel like it is similar to labelling my food tins. Sugar, flour, noodles, milk powder etc. What is the value of this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are already surrounded by words. Take a look around your house at<br/>
all the words that are already visible. You mentioned food<br/>
containers. There are tons of those eggs, milk, oatmeal, cans of<br/>
corn, 85/20 ground beef, Boca, ramen noodles, tomatoe sauce, etc etc<br/>
etc. There are words in your car, there are words all along the<br/>
streets (even if they do happen to say Stop, yield, wrong way,<br/>
mcdonald&#39;s, pizza hut, etc.) There are words in our places of<br/>
worship. There are words everywhere. Do you really feel the need to<br/>
add more words to your lives? I would hazard that when you first put<br/>
the words up that they would be a novelty and within a few days or<br/>
weeks they would blend into just part of what makes up your house.<br/>

Sorry, I have to disagree!   This is NOT true for every child.  I LOVE <br/>
to read and have always read out loud to my dd (now 14).  Both she and <br/>
my dh do not enjoy reading for pleasure, they&#39;re both right-<br/>
brained/visual-spatial learners, the sequential process of reading is <br/>
difficult and not pleasurable for them, they&#39;d rather get info in <br/>
other ways.  My dd HAS read books (when she was in school) and <br/>
certainly is able to read, but chooses not to.<br/>

<br/>
I have to second this.  I have been an avid reader since what seems <br/>
like birth.  As a child and teen I had a dresser for clothing and a <br/>
dresser for books, one of the old ones with big, deep drawers.  I <br/>
still have all of those books.  I&#39;ve created a mini-library in my <br/>
home.  I am always checking out anywhere from 30-60 books at a time <br/>
from the library.  Typically I am reading as many as five books at a <br/>
time, not to mention magazines and other resources.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have one child that shares my hunger for knowledge through <br/>
reading books, not one.  We have seven children.  Some don&#39;t like to <br/>
read at all, some are occasional, some read for knowlede only, etc.  <br/>
None read and read and read like I do.  This despite reading 30 <br/>
books a week to my youngest son at our peak...we spent a lot of time <br/>
waiting in the car when we did that.  My husband only reads when he <br/>
has to.  He does not enjoy it at all.<br/>
<br/>
None of these are better or worse than the other, but it is very <br/>
difficult for those of us that enjoy reading so much to even <br/>
understand &quot;how&quot; anyone that does not read often learns anything at <br/>
all.  :-)<br/>

people -- a few from the original series -- are donating their time  <br/>
to create brand new adventures you can download for free. They&#39;re  <br/>
treating them like plays so the characters are the same but new  <br/>
actors play the parts. The sets and effects are quite well done. The  <br/>
acting takes some getting used to ;-) (I&#39;d suggest avoiding the  <br/>

rather painful to watch since they&#39;re all so obviously *acting*. ;-)<br/>
