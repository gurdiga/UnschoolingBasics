<div id="ygrps-yiv-260695008">We are a few weeks into deschooling and dh hasn&#39;t said one negative<br/>
thing.  I&#39;ve forwarded short snippets of articles from Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
and Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s websites about deschooling and gaming, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if he is reading them but I&#39;m sending them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Zak seems to be going through what I believe Kelly said that her son<br/>
Cameron went through; a dark time.  He is joyful when playing<br/>
RuneScape but when we go somewhere or anything like that he seems very<br/>
depressed.  I must say that it is very, very hard for me to watch him<br/>
go through this.  He still loves to play the guitar but his Bonsai<br/>
desire when right out the door.  He said that ALL he wants to do is<br/>
play Runescape and the guitar.  RuneScape is played literally from<br/>
7-10 hours a day, he doesn&#39;t want to go outside or anything.  I&#39;ve let<br/>
him know that if there are any outside activities that he wants to do<br/>
like sports, karate, etc. all he has to do is let us know.  He says,<br/>
&quot;I only want to play RuneScape and the guitar.  When I&#39;m away from<br/>
RuneScape it is all I think about.  We&#39;ve gone to museums and parks<br/>
and walks, he just has a very moopy expression.  He keeps insisting<br/>
that he is happy.  We also have almost no social life because most of<br/>
his friends are busy participating in things outside of the home so<br/>
everyone is literally too busy for us and he has no desire to play or<br/>
participate in what his friends are doing. <br/>
<br/>
I have NO intentions of giving up, just sharing.  We have great<br/>
conversations and everything and he tells me he doesn&#39;t want to ever<br/>
go to school.  As a matter of fact, he wants to quit blended school<br/>
(which is one day a week) because he finds it boring and this despite<br/>
the fact that is where most of his friends are.  I ask him all the<br/>
time about his game and I am genuinely interested in hearing about<br/>
what he finds so fascinating about it; he glows and is all smiles<br/>
telling me about various challenges and how he only has so many to go<br/>
before reaching another level, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into what I see as him being depressed?  I<br/>
love him so much but hate seeing him sad.  He really had it tough with<br/>
me over the years (keep in mind that I was a bible thumper from ages<br/>
5-10 with him...no Christmas, no Easter, nothing)its now been over 2<br/>
years since I deconverted from the Christian religion.<br/>
<br/>
Our 8yo dd is doing wonderful, she was never as badly &quot;damaged&quot; as our<br/>
12yo ds though.  It mattered not what kind of homeschooling we did, it<br/>
never stopped creativity nor did it ever hinder her love for learning,<br/>
but unlike her brother, she always &quot;got it&quot;.  She isn&#39;t better or<br/>
smarter than him but to put it in better prespective, she&#39;d probably<br/>
fit easily into public schools and make all A&#39;s with little effort. <br/>
However, she has absolutely no desire to go to school at all.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finished rambling...<br/>

fabulous mind challenge, so he&#39;s going to be learning a lot while he&#39;s<br/>
doing this necessary work of healing. It might take a year, it  might<br/>
take longer. Keep on trusting him.<br/>

Take him food, watch him play, ask him questions.<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to offer a bit of &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Hang in <br/>
there, sounds like you&#39;re doing fine. :-) <br/>
I think it&#39;s so important for us as parents, to deschool ourselves <br/>
also. Sometimes it&#39;s hard for us to do that than for our kids to.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some thoughts on deschooling that may be of use. <br/>

Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into what I see as him being depressed?  I<br/>
love him so much but hate seeing him sad.  He really had it tough with<br/>

My dad&#39;s a psychiatrist. His first question to people who come in for <br/>
depression is, &quot;What do you do for fun?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Their answers can be very helpful in diagnosing depression. If your son <br/>
is DOING what makes him happy---going after it, it&#39;s probably not <br/>
*depression*. I&#39;d say he&#39;s just *really* focused! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep giving him what he needs. Keep offering alternatives. Revel in <br/>
what he delights in.<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t play Runescape only for the rest of his life. He&#39;ll grow and <br/>
change. Five years from now, you&#39;ll look back and laugh! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
