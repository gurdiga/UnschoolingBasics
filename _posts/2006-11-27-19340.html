<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286642530">Sometimes I need to be hit over the head with a brick but I&#39;m seeing<br/>
that this &quot;trust&quot; issue just isn&#39;t about &quot;what they need to know&quot;, it<br/>
encompasses EVERY aspect of their lives.  When my son tells me that he<br/>
is happy and that he isn&#39;t interested in doing things outside of the<br/>
home (for now) I need to TRUST him!  Why it has taken that so long to<br/>
get through my head is beyond me.  Even though *I* can&#39;t understand<br/>
how he could possibly be happy by not making any friends (btw, I&#39;m<br/>
very introverted but do miss having several friends but I&#39;m happy<br/>
regardless), doesn&#39;t mean that I should keep pestering him about<br/>
trying to make them.  He knows that the doors are open, all he has to<br/>
do is ask. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I rattled off a whole list of opportunitys to make friends<br/>
here in our area and he turned me down flat on all of them.  Right<br/>
now, he is happy playing Runescape, getting together with our friends<br/>
in Gulf Breeze, and staying home...I need to *trust* that he *is*<br/>
happy or I risk a chance for him to trust me.  Afterall, you can&#39;t<br/>
tell a child you trust them and then turn around and try to basically<br/>
say, &quot;I trust that you are happy but I really don&#39;t think that you<br/>
know what REAL happiness is so here, let me keep badgering you with MY<br/>
ideas on what could make you happier.&quot; Good gravy!<br/>

lately has me depressed.  Is it possible to be happy and depressed at<br/>
the same time?  LOL, I&#39;m confusing myself!<br/>

My friend and I meet for a grocery shopping trips, run errands<br/>
together, chat throughout the day on the phone with a &#39;gotta go now&#39;<br/>
understanding, attend a couple of parenting group events, and have an<br/>
occasional lunch or dinner out together. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry that I didn&#39;t make myself clear, it isn&#39;t that I can&#39;t get<br/>
together with others.  We suffered a loss of community and family<br/>
friends when I deconverted from Christianity...that is what I am<br/>
missing; not christianity but the friends base.  I&#39;m having a hard<br/>
time finding friends, I don&#39;t exclude others but find myself being<br/>
excluded.  However, I do have a very good friend here and our children<br/>
are great friends with hers.  My other friend has been too busy for us<br/>
over the past two months so that is why I&#39;m feeling a little lonely<br/>
and sad lately.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to start a home school group but am just having a little<br/>
trouble getting it off the ground.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975845152">~~~he is happy playing Runescape~~~<br/>
<br/>
I looked up Runescape a few days ago when it was mentioned in this group.<br/>
Now my daughter, son, spouse and I have been playing it for days!<br/>
What a fun game!  We love that we can go on quests together, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
