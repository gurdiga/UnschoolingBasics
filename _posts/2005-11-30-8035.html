<div id="ygrps-yiv-744023158">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m sorry if this is OT, but I love my <br/>
brother and I<br/>
miss seeing him smile. Any ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you spend some time with him when your dh is with your boys, <br/>
even just once a week?<br/>
What about just setting aside one afternoon a week and taking him to <br/>
a movie, or shopping or hang out somewhere he likes....go to coffee, <br/>
the bookstore, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t he come hang out at your house once in a while too?  Maybe <br/>
you could be his after school hang out?  Get him some cool computer <br/>
games (my Trevor could give recommendations) or a video gaming <br/>
system, maybe rent some movies...make your place the HAVEN.  Indulge <br/>
whatever his interests are, help him get film, or find cool <br/>
locations for shooting pics. Heck, you could both do a photo project <br/>
together.<br/>
Sierra and I are pairing up some of our favorite things this week, <br/>
as our theme for a roll of film. She may be shooting pink rice <br/>
krispie treats...:)<br/>
Photo projects can be a great way to connect and spark conversation.<br/>

  I was thinking about this, on the weekends I work at a coffee hut right around the corner, and I called and asked Miles if he&#39;d like to meet me for ice cream after I was done. He said that that sounded like fun.<br/>

  I invite him over all the time, he rarelly say&#39;s yes but I&#39;ll keep inviting. I like the idea of having things for him here, and I&#39;d love sugestions from Trevor. <br/>

  Sounds fun! I make krispy treats all the time, but how do you get them pink? Do you just color the marshmellow when it&#39;s melted?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx Ren for all your help. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052356059">&quot;Sounds fun! I make krispy treats all the time, but how do you get <br/>
them pink?<br/>
Do you just color the marshmellow when it&#39;s melted?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well.....if you want them edible, you could add a bit of food dye to <br/>
the marshmallow goo while you&#39;re melting it all.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, our project consisted of writing down 5 of our favorite colors, <br/>
3 of our favorite foods and 2 of our favorite activities (don&#39;t ask <br/>
why those favorites or the amount, it just evolved as we were <br/>
playing) then picking at least two items from the entire list and <br/>
representing it in a photo.<br/>
<br/>
So using Sierra&#39;s list, she could do pink rice krispie treats by <br/>
pouring acrylic paint over them...heck, it&#39;s a photo, you can get <br/>
crazy.:)<br/>
She could shoot with a purple filter over the lense (using colored <br/>
vellum or plastic is a cheap filter) and take a photo of someone <br/>
singing, or a photo of a paint pallette or....there&#39;s a million <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Her faves were:  pink, purple, green, black and blue<br/>
                 rice krispie treats, pizza and salad<br/>
                 creating art, dancing, singing and swimming.<br/>
(she decided two wasn&#39;t enough for the favorite activities category, <br/>
I stuck with it.:)<br/>
