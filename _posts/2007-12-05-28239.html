He is probably curious and has questions. Talk with him. It is possible he<br/>
did not realize what he was clicking on. Talk with him. Whether he got there<br/>
by searching for it or by accident might give you a guide as to what his<br/>
questions might be. Keep your cool. Talk more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647177771">Simon hasn&#39;t yet. He&#39;s 10 and he isn&#39;t particularly interested, yet. I figure there will come a day. He has had friends over who are quite interested in naked women. And Linnaea, who is 7, has played Barbie doll games that have some adult scenes going on, and has worked really hard to get her Sims to &quot;woohoo&quot; on the Sims2. Oh, and we have Leisure Suit Larry for the PS2, which they haven&#39;t played for ages, but which was sort of fun for a little while. Sex and sexual imagery just isn&#39;t quite fascinating, yet. <br/>
 <br/>
I would be most worried about the computer being vulnerable to trojans &lt;BWG&gt;  and other sorts of computer STD&#39;s that might be an issue than I would be about the exposure to naked folk. I&#39;d make sure I had really good firewalls and up to date virus software. From my teen years I have some pretty sexually explicit comic books, and some nice books of nudes, I might hunt through all the boxes from move after move and see if I could put my hands on those. I don&#39;t know that I would make a big deal out of it, but I&#39;d probably put them somewhere that I know he&#39;d see them and I wouldn&#39;t mention it. I would talk to him about Chris Langham and the trouble he got into for downloading images of children to his computer and how there are images that are available via the internet that could get him into seriously hot water. He needs to tread carefully if accessing nudity via the internet. That&#39;s what I would point out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828142724">Well, considering it&#39;s a pretty typical part of teenage life, I&#39;d be  <br/>
thankful that I knew, instead of having him sneak behind my back and  <br/>
never know. I&#39;d much rather him look at honest porn and know that  <br/>
they are consenting adults, rather than secretive tapes that boys (or  <br/>
girls) have taken of their partners and posted, or sex slaves from  <br/>
eastern Europe stuck in the US at a strip club.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d wonder what he&#39;s getting out of it. Is he curious about sex? Just  <br/>
about what porn is? Is he actually interested in having a sexual  <br/>
relationship?<br/>
<br/>
I can say that Josh has looked at porn online. He hasn&#39;t been ready  <br/>
to talk about it. My husband&#39;s mother was much the same, and dh says  <br/>
that it was the best thing, he could talk to her about anything. As a  <br/>
result, he was able to have access to what he needed, and engaged in  <br/>
only two relationships, both very serious and both planned out.<br/>
<br/>
My friends son was doing the same thing, and got a bunch of spyware  <br/>
on his computer, so I can be thankful that we haven&#39;t had to deal  <br/>
with that. Dh upgraded our fire wall just in case. Josh knows that he  <br/>
can talk to me about anything disturbing, and because we&#39;ve pretty  <br/>
much uncovered all the secrets of sex, he knows if/when things are  <br/>
exaggerated or just wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559746308">Well, as far as the spyware and viruses he is pretty good about that. <br/>
He&#39;s very computer savvy and does system checks frequently on his <br/>
own. <br/>
He may be getting more curious about sex than he has been in the <br/>
past, or maybe just porn. I&#39;m not sure. We have always had open <br/>
discussions about sex and he has asked a lot of questions. I have <br/>
never shyed away from the topic. I guess I&#39;m more concerned about <br/>
what it is he is seeing. It&#39;s pretty explicit stuff. The internet has <br/>
no boundaries as far as that stuff goes. It can be down right <br/>
shocking. <br/>
And actually he didn&#39;t come right out and tell me, I&#39;m sorry to say. <br/>
I found the websites in the drop box of internet explorer. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure whether to even mention it or not. I feel that he has the right <br/>
to privacy but I would also like to have an open discussion about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597487230">Hi Aubrey! Steven (14) says that it is highly likely<br/>
he is finding things while looking for other things. <br/>
Some of his suggestions for easily finding porn<br/>
included searching for cheat codes, serial numbers to<br/>
play games, flash or online games, and how to make a<br/>
bomb type instructions. <br/>
His other suggestion was to stop using IE because<br/>
there is a risk of phishing more predominantly at <br/>
websites that have a possibility of having flash or<br/>
other porn.<br/>
One thing he has seen is while playing a free online<br/>
strategy game, he found a banner ad for obscene Cosmo<br/>
magazine.<br/>
If he is specifically going to porn sites (grayvee.com<br/>
or  diablobabes.com for example) then its a personal<br/>
thing that he WANTS to look at them.<br/>
Those are his thoughts, porn is harder to avoid than<br/>
find. I even found something looking for rag rug<br/>
making instructions once!<br/>
