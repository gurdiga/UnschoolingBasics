<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757066638">Hi, Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that talking is not helping here because I think Khalid <br/>
has a need that he is trying to meet, and what you&#39;re telling him <br/>
isn&#39;t helping him meet his need.  Rather than talking and trying to <br/>
make him change, I think it&#39;d be good to do a little detective work <br/>
to try to understand what need he&#39;s trying his best to meet by <br/>
dancing in his sister&#39;s face, and then help him find a better way to <br/>
meet that need.  The need could be, for example, to engage you or <br/>
Safiya or anybody.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to talk about this with him, too, consider doing it <br/>
at a time when he&#39;s not trying to get attention.  While it is good <br/>
for him to understand that stop means stop, I wouldn&#39;t expect him to <br/>
be able to honor that yet.   He&#39;s really all about getting his needs <br/>
met right now, and that&#39;s really as it should be.  He really just <br/>
needs your loving guidance to find better ways to do it.  And, it&#39;d <br/>
be best to anticipate that need before he feels like he has to get in <br/>
other people&#39;s faces.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t post often but i wanted to say this works for<br/>
us also.<br/>
<br/>
the problem i have with my 3.5 yr old is that she<br/>
becomes unpredictably overcome with impulses (normal)<br/>
which hurt others (not normal). these don&#39;t seem to<br/>
occur in the heat of an argument with her brothers or<br/>
anything. there&#39;s usually no anger or frustration<br/>
involved. i can&#39;t seem to find a pattern. <br/>
<br/>
the difficulty is that often i cannot catch her before<br/>
she does it. for instance, to give a real example, a<br/>
couple of days ago she and i were curled up on the<br/>
floor on a pillow watching a dvd. her 9 yr old brother<br/>
was lying near us also watching. she seemed to be<br/>
enjoying it, there was no sign of unrest, but suddenly<br/>
her shoe-clad foot kicked her brother hard in the<br/>
head. it was very quick, very sudden. i comforted the<br/>
victim who was, understandably angry and hurt. i<br/>
wasn&#39;t quite sure what to say to her (and honestly i<br/>
was trying to figure it out while talking to her<br/>
brother and making sure he was okay). i ended up<br/>
getting authoritarian on her and saying something like<br/>
&quot;we don&#39;t hurt each other. your brother doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to lay by you anymore because you hurt him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
about 5 minutes later i was changing the 4 mo old<br/>
baby&#39;s diaper on the floor. 3 yr old tosses a large<br/>
wooden block and i say &quot;oo, be careful!&quot; with a smile<br/>
and meeting her eyes, and she immediately hums another<br/>
one and hits her baby sis in the face. i immediately<br/>
picked up the baby and moved her to a safer place.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*  i feel often as though i am failing at keeping<br/>
the other kids safe from my daughter. she and my 6 yr<br/>
old son do a lot of concensual wrestling-type play,<br/>
and we tickle and laugh alot, but i don&#39;t know why she<br/>
feels compelled to hit and throw. it is understandable<br/>
in a younger toddler, but after modelling and talking<br/>
so much, i feel that i don&#39;t know what else to do. i<br/>
honestly don&#39;t know if i should just ride it out,<br/>
hoping it&#39;s a behavior she won&#39;t always feel the need<br/>
for, but her brothers get angry and my husband and i<br/>
don&#39;t like it much either!<br/>
<br/>
any advice for helping her, keeping the others safe,<br/>
and words to use when she does these things?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>first of all this is so my 3 yr old and she has been VERY physical <br/>
since she could move- she would come up to you can bite you or hit <br/>
you as hard as she could or throw things at you for no reason-<br/>
<br/>
my 5 yr old will be laying on the couch and 3 yr old will walk over <br/>
and hit her on the head-- for no apparent reason--<br/>
<br/>
BUT<br/>
<br/>
I think for her it is a sensory thing- it does not hurt HER and she <br/>
sees no reason why it is bugging you- <br/>
<br/>
I think she really wants to touch she just does it really rough and <br/>
unexpectedly- so when she stood on the stool and expected me to <br/>
catch her even if I was not there I told her she needs to <br/>
say &quot;ready&quot; and if I do not say &quot;ready&quot; back then she can not jump<br/>
<br/>
or when walking past someone I say touchy &quot;gentle&quot; you can touch but <br/>
gentle and she does do it and will come over to me and say I touched <br/>
sister gentle<br/>
<br/>
sounds like you have the same sort of kid- expect that they will be <br/>
rough and try to always step in -- after a while she is better but <br/>
will still unexpectedly throw or hit but way less often<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814085359">I will try that.  Some days are really difficult where he is clearly trying<br/>
to get everyone&#39;s attention in the worst ways!  I do my best, but I&#39;m one<br/>
person (dh is not really on board yet) and sometimes I feel stretched a bit.<br/>
On top of that, dh says that Khalid acts one way with me, and totally<br/>
different (read obedient) with him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today we went to Ikea to buy a desk.  I thought dh should have gone alone,<br/>
but he likes *me* to go everywhere with him, which means we all go (no one<br/>
to watch the kids like that).  So..we go to Ikea.  He&#39;s frustrated &#39;cause<br/>
the kids want to buy something and it takes them forever.  I&#39;m working with<br/>
them, explaining our budget and such.  Everyone picks something out that&#39;s<br/>
within budget (yeah!).  Safiya wants something she can&#39;t have and is moping.<br/>
I respect that.  I talk with her.  We talk about wanting what we want *right<br/>
now*.  Normally I would try and make her feel better, but I didn&#39;t.  She<br/>
needed her feelings so I just tried to understand and empathize.  Dh was not<br/>
amused by her sadness.  Khalid..ah Khalid..he was getting tired...very<br/>
tired.  Khidar (2) had picked out a bat stuffed animal.  Khalid had picked<br/>
out a shark.  Now Khalid wanted the bat because he wanted something that<br/>
flies.  He was crying, screaming.  Some people were looking, of course.  Dh<br/>
was embarrassed - concerned about what others thought about him - not what<br/>
Khalid thought about him, but what strangers thought about him.  I<br/>
understood; I&#39;ve been there.  I hugged Khalid, I listened to him.  I let him<br/>
scream.  To try and stop him or make him feel better would not have worked,<br/>
I think.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Eventually Khalid did stop crying and he fell asleep on the way home.  Dh<br/>
vowed never again to take us with him and I could just go out with &quot;my kids&quot;<br/>
alone.  I had to work very hard at staying calm.  I know that those are just<br/>
words (although I usually do take the kids out solo).  I tried to understand<br/>
that from his perspective parenting is about controlling your kids, and to<br/>
him bad parents don&#39;t have control.  We still have lots to work on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289630668">on the issue of the radio, we got our  4yr. old an inexpensive mp3 so she could listen to her music if her teen brothers wanted to listen to theirs.  she&#39;s gotten more mature now and has come to understand that she can listen to her cd&#39;s in the car when it&#39;s just the 2 of us, but when her brothers are with us she tells them that they can listen to their music.(her idea) she actually has come to like their music (currently Prince and The Police!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210550979">Hi,<br/>
my 3.5 y.o. can get intense like this too. Ofen it is<br/>
that he just needs some attention or wants to move<br/>
around and if he is bothering his older brother it<br/>
often means he does not know what to do with himself.<br/>
A suggestion like, hey, if you want to dance around<br/>
why don&#39;t you come in the other room with me, we&#39;ll<br/>
put on some music and dance. Your siser would like to<br/>
have some quiet time now.<br/>
Also what has really worked well with asking my boys<br/>
to do something (I got this from the book &#39;hold on to<br/>
your kids&#39;) is to firs have a positive interaction,<br/>
like, &#39;you have so much energy and like to dance, hm?&quot;<br/>
then, when his attention is on you, you can then<br/>
possibly  suggest something else to do.<br/>
Saying stop does not work with my 3.5 y.o. Suggesting<br/>
what else to do often does. Of course we do have<br/>
situations where he wants to do this one thing badly,<br/>
but can&#39;t (like wreck his brothers lego castle that he<br/>
spend hours building) and I do prevent him from doing<br/>
it by protecting the castle. When he cries I<br/>
acknowledge that he is sad, but that his brother (who<br/>
is crying because he does not want it wrecked but does<br/>
not know how to stop him) has spend a lot of time<br/>
building and does not want it destroyed even if he<br/>
were playing the bad guys. I might suggest other<br/>
things, like building something his bad guys can wreck<br/>
etc. or just wait until he calms down. After the<br/>
initial sadness, he usually calms down and then we go<br/>
on playing.<br/>
In the past I have often tried to just say stop, don&#39;t<br/>
do this (like break the eggs in the store) and it has<br/>
not worked too well. What worked better was to have<br/>
him break a lot of eggs at home (like baking together,<br/>
or just breaking for the fun of it) and he has not<br/>
done it again in the store. Of course I would try to<br/>
stop him in the store, but when I wasn&#39;t looking for a<br/>
second he would run over to the eggs so fast we almost<br/>
broke one every time I went shopping. He was much<br/>
younger then, but the same goes for a lot of things.<br/>
The more he realized that I want to help him have the<br/>
experiences and never make him feel that he is<br/>
&#39;wrong&#39;, the more likely he is now to understand if<br/>
someone does not want him to do something.<br/>
Hope this helps some,<br/>
good luck,<br/>

it would be so nice- BUT<br/>
<br/>
in reality- dinner was so stressful that we were not connecting in a <br/>

<br/>
so now we eat where ever we want to- very peaceful- sometime we talk <br/>
while we on eating and on computer or watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
connecting in the car is not really connecting if everyone is grumpy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267278049">Hmmm...that&#39;s an interesting point about dad finding a solution that <br/>
works for him whether mom is comfortable with it or not. I&#39;m sort of <br/>
dealing with that right now. My husband just came home from a year <br/>
long deployment. His being here is interrupting our flow. His <br/>
solution to that is to sort of remove himself from the family. <br/>
<br/>
For example, we all share the same bed, baby, preschooler, mom and <br/>
dad. While dad was gone the rest of us got used to sleeping until <br/>
around 9 am. Dad gets up early, 6-7 am, which then wakes everyone <br/>
else. The rest of us are then grumpy all day because we didn&#39;t get <br/>
enough sleep. Dad&#39;s solution to this problem is for him to sleep in <br/>
another room. I don&#39;t like this idea because I think it detaches him <br/>
even further from the rest of family at a time when I think it&#39;s <br/>
very important for him to reattach himself. I don&#39;t really have any <br/>
other solution except to give it time for everyone to adjust to the <br/>
new schedule.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121085294">I agree with the others - talk is not what will work right now with a<br/>
4/5 yr old. My DS is 9 1/2 and he&#39;ll still get in my face (or DH&#39;s)<br/>
sometimes. Particularly irritating behaviors include repeatedly bumping<br/>
us, poking, making loud gibberish sounds directly in our faces,<br/>
deliberately moving in front of us as we&#39;re trying to go from place to<br/>
place (including physically blocking the way by holding onto<br/>
doorframes), etc. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve uncovered several &quot;triggers&quot; to this type stuff:<br/>
<br/>
1- lack of food, specifically protein, make impulse control harder for<br/>
him - he told us flat out when he was about 5 &quot;my brain won&#39;t let me<br/>
stop&quot; even though he knew what he was doing was irritating and we had<br/>
asked him to stop. So, we make sure he gets protein regularly throughout<br/>
the day, snackwise<br/>
2- tiredness sometimes because his motor is revving too fast, finding<br/>
some way (picking a movie, TV program, story, relaxed type board game)<br/>
to slow down and catch up to himself helps<br/>
3 - feeling rushed or pressured about something causes him to dig in<br/>
4 - needing focused attention - for instance, sometimes having me<br/>
reading a magazine article nearby while he&#39;s watching a favorite TV show<br/>
is fine. Other times, he needs me to be focusing on what he&#39;s focusing<br/>
on.<br/>
5 - odd as this may sound compared to #3, not going quickly enough - as<br/>
in, if we&#39;re leaving someplace (even a place he enjoys) those long chit<br/>
chatty goodbyes (see you soon, had a nice time, send me the recipe,<br/>
yaddayadda) are out - once we say Time to go, we&#39;re out of there as<br/>
quickly as possible. DH and I have had to learn to do all our winding<br/>
down stuff at social events BEFORE we get jackets on - once his jacket<br/>
is on, it&#39;s time to head out the door<br/>
6 - having to &quot;contain&quot; himself in some situations means that he&#39;s<br/>
likely to have trouble after a bit of time (30 minutes to an hour<br/>
depending on circumstance) as bits of &quot;energy&quot; start popping out. For<br/>
instance, he can manage about 30 minutes visiting FIL in the hospital<br/>
but that&#39;s about it (and he&#39;s got a bag stuffed with his DS & games,<br/>
sketchpad and writing stuff, snacks, water bottle, assorted other items<br/>
as he requests so it&#39;s not just nothing to do but sit). Hospitals are<br/>
places where quieter, restrained behavior is needed (no running,<br/>
jumping, yelling, etc) plus they tend to have bright lights, odd smells<br/>
and sounds, and a generally stressful atmosphere. All that plays into<br/>
the situation. He&#39;s fine playing with something we&#39;ve brought along for<br/>
up to 30 minutes. After that, we (DS and I) generally try to take a walk<br/>
or do something away from FIL&#39;s room (FIL is a bit of a depressing<br/>
person to be around anyhow and DS doesn&#39;t have a super strong feeling of<br/>
connection with him to start with). After about 30 minutes of doing<br/>
something else, we&#39;ll head back and let DH know it&#39;s time to leave and<br/>
off we go.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts to maybe jump start some things going in your mind as<br/>
to where stuff is coming from and what kinds of stuff might help. It may<br/>
be, at first glance, that he&#39;s just feeling a bit left out of his<br/>
sister&#39;s day - perhaps she&#39;s moved from a &quot;peer&quot; type playmate to being<br/>
a little older and having other interests more now (a natural<br/>
progression) and he&#39;s not getting as much of her attention as he used to<br/>
get. Working together to figure out how to give her her space and at the<br/>
same time &quot;fill his cup&quot; where it needs her attention is a discussion<br/>
point. And, perhaps, (just guessing) if she was his usual playmate but<br/>
isn&#39;t as interested anymore, you (mom) will need to take up some of the<br/>
slack and/or find other venues for him to develop new ways of getting<br/>
that (even though it&#39;s not the same as his sister, it might help).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989358968">Mara�s advice is really good.  A moving truck is easier to steer than it is<br/>
to stop � same with a little child.  The steering should be fun.  Be as<br/>
childlike and in the moment as he is and watch him engage with you.  The<br/>
older child who is the brunt of the problem might even decide to get into<br/>
the act too and then you�ll have everyone laughing and playing instead of<br/>
resisting each other.  I know this is hard, but try not to resist the idea<br/>
in your mind.  Just try it when the opportunity presents itself and go with<br/>
it and with the ideas that grow in you from there.  (Ooh, I think I�m<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349442289">my husband was deployed for 10 months during deschooling time and <br/>
then the girls who were 2 and 4 were pretty much sleeping with me in <br/>
our bed. I was worried about him not liking it and to my surprise he <br/>
said let them stay if that is what they want. <br/>
<br/>
He is also a morning person but the only day we all get woke up is <br/>
the weekends- ahhhh- I wished he would let me sleep till noon and <br/>
take care of the kids but he was lonely- we wanted my company- he <br/>
needed me more than I needed more sleep. <br/>
<br/>
So if you all sleep in the same bed he wants everyone to wake up but <br/>
if he is sleeping seperate he is ok waking up without you.<br/>
<br/>
Is he resentful of this option or does he seem really ok with it? <br/>
<br/>
If he is really ok with it it may be the best thing- you can always <br/>
go cuddle with him when you feel like it and he gets what he wants <br/>
and you get what you want which is more sleep<br/>
<br/>
after being gone for 10 months my husband was home a year and is now <br/>
back out for a 6 month maybe a year deployment- it is tough to get <br/>
them unschooly when the  military is so strict but if you let him <br/>
deschool sort of from the military he might come a long way.<br/>
<br/>
after he left a month ago the kids started staying up till 1am and <br/>
then we would sleep till 10 am- now that our mornings will be his <br/>
evenings and nights I may have to get up earlier to talk on webcam. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373518527">Hi Maisha,<br/>
Khalid, at 4/5 years old, does seem a bit young to be persuaded by<br/>
verbal explanations of why its good to have a &quot;stop when I say stop&quot; rule.<br/>
Just as an experiment, sometime when Khalid is playing with Safiya in<br/>
a way that Safiya begins to find annoying, then tells him to stop and<br/>
he continues, you might say &quot;Let&#39;s play a game. Let&#39;s say that for the<br/>
next minute or so there is no stop rule, and so if Safiya wants to<br/>
start tickling you and you ask her to stop, she doesn&#39;t have to.&quot;<br/>
Hopefully with a smile and a twinkle in your eye, Safiya can be<br/>
persuaded to play her role in a playful manner and not a retaliatory<br/>
one. Even so, getting tickled gets to be pretty annoying pretty fast!<br/>
Then to Khalid: &quot;What do think, Khalid - should we bring back the stop<br/>
rule now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you may just have to accept needing to continue to<br/>
intervene. I don&#39;t know if you can manage it, but it sounds to me that<br/>
if you could give yourself and your dh some private time for a day or<br/>
two while the children are perhaps left with a trusted relative, then<br/>
you would be able to come back to them feeling refreshed and<br/>
recharged, and more able to continue to give in this way.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I really appreciate your Dalai Lama quote,<br/>

<br/>
Stop means Stop for *everyone*<br/>
Modeling this helps. By 4/5 my kids had a great grasp of this and had NO<br/>
fear saying it to anyone who bothered them. They would wrest away from my<br/>
overly-physically-affectionate parents and emphatically state &quot;STOP means<br/>
STOP papa!!!&quot; When the grownup would look at me, I&#39;d raise my eyebrows in a<br/>
&quot;well? doesn&#39;t it?&quot; kinda way and viola! it stopped.<br/>
It has to be shown by the the humans with more life experience. Instead of<br/>
the brother/sister role-playing someone else suggested, I&#39;d recommend a<br/>
mama/daddy role-playing - daddy teasing mama and mama saying &quot;stop&quot; and<br/>
daddy replying, &quot;OH! Stop means Stop, I have to stop right now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I came from a family with prevalent sexual abuse that I really didn&#39;t want<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to have to talk to my kids about; at the same time, I desperately needed a<br/>
way for them to be safe in the world. It&#39;s imperative that kids grow up<br/>
knowing they have the power to stop unwanted advances (from strangers AND<br/>
those they love and trust; whether it&#39;s tickling, teasing or molestation of<br/>
another sort) and for them to understand another human&#39;s right to say stop<br/>
and mean it. All kids should know they have the support of their adults in<br/>
maintaining control of their bodies and their environment.<br/>

room. The problem is that I&#39;m very sensitive to him not being there. I <br/>
can feel the emptiness in the bed even if I don&#39;t hear him and there <br/>
are two kids between us. Once I&#39;m awake I can&#39;t go back to sleep. When <br/>
I get up the baby gets up and so on. <br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s fine with sleeping by himself. Even our 4yo said that <br/>
daddy could sleep in his own room and he and the baby could sleep with <br/>
me and we weren&#39;t even talking about it at the time. I&#39;m the one who <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is definitely Khalid.  He&#39;ll tell me (as he yells) &quot;I can&#39;t stop<br/>
yelling!&quot; or &quot;my body can&#39;t stop&quot;.  He&#39;s very expressive in how his body<br/>
feels.  He can tell me what his body feels like in any situation.  Yesterday<br/>
he told me &quot;my throat hurts; it feels spicy&quot;.  I figured that he had a sore<br/>
throat, and we dealt with it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s probably a good starting point for us - talking about how his<br/>
body feels with certain emotions.  That may help us figure out what he needs<br/>
and we can do to help him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642809525">Hey:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will add anything of value to the discussion about<br/>
&quot;stop means stop.&quot;  But I was reminded of a counseling technique that Adler<br/>
used sometimes to remedy people who say they can&#39;t help but gamble, drink,<br/>
lie, hit, or whatever.  He called this &quot;antisuggestion&quot; and he&#39;d suggest his<br/>
clients to do whatever it is MORE or HARDER, instead of trying not to do it.<br/>
This would usually result in the client reacting in two ways: Stopping,<br/>
because the client did not want to lie more, hurt others more, gamble<br/>
harder, whatever, or, by the client doing more or worse on purpose, the<br/>
client realizes whatever it is can be controlled and that the client can<br/>
help it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t stop yelling!&quot;  It might be wild, but might it be useful to suggest<br/>
that he yell more, louder, etc.?  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I don&#39;t know if it is any good, but the discussion just reminded me<br/>
of this concept and I thought I&#39;d just report it.<br/>

challenges at this point) trying to stop the behavior only makes<br/>
things worse. Redirecting can be helpful, but going with the flow of<br/>
what he needs is even better.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ll just step in (dh is good at this) and have an arm<br/>
wrestling contest or ask him to push against our hands. Anything<br/>
physical. When he wants to hit or throw, I quickly hold up a big<br/>
pillow or some object that is satisfying to hit (rice bags work great)<br/>
and tell him &quot;hit it HARD&quot;. Going along with that flow helps him more<br/>
than saying &quot;stop&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes some creativity in heated moments, but sometimes you can<br/>
think of an outlet that honors the need and also protects the other<br/>
