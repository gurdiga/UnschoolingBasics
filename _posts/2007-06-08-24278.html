<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909335178">Whatever happened on that morning, whatever happened in that family, they <br/>
weren&#39;t unschooling. And while I did go and read some of the newspaper <br/>
articles today, and I felt so sad for all the people involved, I don&#39;t think <br/>
that the story is applicable to me or my family. I&#39;m not going to set myself <br/>
in opposition to Simon or to Linnaea. If Linnaea or Simon are dating at 14, <br/>
then I will invite their girlfriend or boyfriend over for dinner and to play <br/>
games with us in the evening and to be apart of our life. And I won&#39;t push <br/>
them into sneaking around and climbing in and out of windows.<br/>
<br/>
Right this very minute, Linnaea has just invited me to join a chat with her <br/>
and her friend. Her friend would never dream of asking her mom to join, but <br/>
Linnaea likes my company. And that is real, and that is true, and that is my <br/>
unschooling life in action.<br/>
