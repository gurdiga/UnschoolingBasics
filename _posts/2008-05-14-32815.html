<div id="ygrps-yiv-420246039">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Greetings from VA. It&#39;s been a while since I posted here, but I am <br/>
excited to share that I have finally found some parenting advice that <br/>
is helping my child. The program is called Beyond Consequences.  I <br/>
encourage anyone & everyone to check out their website. Browse the <br/>
free audio downloads to get an idea of the model. <br/>
<br/>
I have been studying nonviolent communication and Parent <br/>
Effectiveness training for several years now and recently stumbled <br/>
upon Beyond Concequences.  I truly believe it has been the missing <br/>
component for me. The material really addresses the explosive child&#39;s <br/>
behavior (the brain & stress). <br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend anyone struggling with behavior or still using <br/>
rewards and punishments to check it out. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions <br/>
Below is a link. Good luck and enjoy life.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043488823">Hi there, <br/>
<br/>
I have been listening to the Post Institute&#39;s lecture series (Brian <br/>
Post, PhD). I believe he coauthored Heather Forbes&#39;s book. I know that <br/>
while they are 2 seperate companies, they share the same message. Tell <br/>
your freid to get the book and joing their Yahoo group. I believe that <br/>
if you buy the book you can attend a free seminar on how to apply the <br/>
material. Good luck<br/>
Sandra<br/>
