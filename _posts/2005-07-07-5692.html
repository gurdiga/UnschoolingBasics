<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285417284">I have a question. How can I unschool and follow the &quot;rules&quot; of the<br/>
state without feeling like I am lying to them? It is an issue. My 17<br/>
year old quit schooling altogether this year. He has a job and has<br/>
worked there for a year. School traumitized him so badly that even the<br/>
mention of learning anything turns him off. He has the rest of his life<br/>
to live and learn. Still people are always asking him if he graduated,<br/>
will he get his GED, etc. It is a part of life. He just says he is<br/>
homeschooled and then people are satisfied. Now he is not homeschooled<br/>
per his request. I still unschool my 14 year old. For the past 3 years I<br/>
put together what ever he experienced and &quot;make it fit&quot; the mold of the<br/>
state. Another thing that really irks me is that if we can<br/>
school/unschool our kids at home legally why are we not allowed to<br/>
legally give them a graduation diploma that counts to enter college if<br/>
they care to go? I hope my kids decide to do some alternative employment<br/>
like alternative medicine, healing practice, organic farming, etc. I<br/>
dont get to choose though:) Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uh, you can. It isn&#39;t &quot;accredited&quot; but neither are many private <br/>
schools&#39; diplomas. Likewise, it is possible to get a job or get into <br/>
college without a GED or &#39;accredited&#39; diploma - likely a <br/>
standardized test (SAT/ACT) like all the other applicants would be <br/>
required as well as a parental written transcript of what has been <br/>
covered - however, when DH chose to go to college (entering as a <br/>
freshman) a decade after high school, he was admitted without any <br/>
test scores (I think he took the ACT during orientation to fulfill <br/>
a &#39;hoop&#39; - he also took all the CLEP tests possible and ended up as <br/>
a sophomore after one semester). And, many colleges now have full <br/>
time admissions staff people to help homeschoolers <br/>
(generically)&#39;translate&#39; their life experience into academic-ese <br/>
(similar to what you do to fit the stuff they do to what the state <br/>
expects to see).<br/>
<br/>
Job applications just put graduated:Yes; date:whenever; <br/>
school:homeschooled) and that&#39;s it - and it is more likely to at <br/>
least get a second look because it is different from all 999 others. <br/>
Putting together a good curriculum vitae would probably also be <br/>
helpful - kind of like a resume of your life - places you&#39;ve <br/>
volunteered, major experiences (like spending a summer backpacking <br/>
in Europe), etc and how those experiences qualify you for the type <br/>
of position you are applying for.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921035292">Good info from Deb...<br/>
<br/>
Plus, are you planning to come to the conference? Wes Beach is going to <br/>
address *just* this issue!<br/>
<br/>
My Cameron (17) is still registered as a homeschooler, but he&#39;s mostly <br/>
just working. He has three paying gigs---two with  caterers and one <br/>
with a paper delivery, one volunteer gig at the local independent film <br/>
theatre, and a *very* busy (and profitable!) house/petsitting service <br/>
that he&#39;s started. He also has a band; they are working on three new <br/>
songs and on getting a gig at a local bar before the end of the summer.<br/>
<br/>
I take what he&#39;s doing at work and use it for &quot;school&quot; records. I can <br/>
also include his travel and what we do at home (talks, movies, games, <br/>
etc.) as school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked him whether he&#39;d like to be &quot;graduated&quot; this summer or keep <br/>
on keeping on as a homeschooler. No answer yet, but it&#39;s really just <br/>
more of what we&#39;ve been doing, so I doubt he&#39;ll make any changes. It&#39;s <br/>
just too easy to do what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
You *could* used his job as a &quot;work-study&quot; program that your very <br/>
progressive homeschool has implemented! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
