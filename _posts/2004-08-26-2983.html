<div id="ygrps-yiv-913064535">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just want to let you all know that all of the listowners and <br/>
moderators are going to be a bit hit and miss on this list over the <br/>
next few days.<br/>
My netzero software got corrupted, so I&#39;m temporarily using the <br/>
library for email access. I&#39;l also be leaving town on Monday for <br/>
Birmingham...but by then, the others should be back from the <br/>
conference.:)<br/>
So over this weekend, if posts are slow or anything crazy happens, <br/>
bear with us. We&#39;ll be back.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Ren</div>
