Here&#39;s a good quote from the beginning:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;First off, things go much more smoothly for me when I remember that I&#39;m *choosing* to visit, or to invite others over. I don&#39;t have to see anyone. You won&#39;t be arrested or jailed for not visiting with relatives. So right off, it&#39;s my choice. It&#39;s a much better mindset because from that perspective I see opportunity, not obligation.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611962854">Well said, thank you so very much for your words of support.  I &quot;always so look forward&quot; to visiting my in-laws--who by the way are all education &quot;professionals&quot;; teachers, professors, we have two guidance councilors and of course the family would not be complete without a principal...  Hey, when I look at it that way; maybe we DO fit in!  Thanks again.<br/>
Linda<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s all about perspective.&quot;<br/>
