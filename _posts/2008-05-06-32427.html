two children ages 8 and 11.  We covered the basics when they asked <br/>
for the information.  My son has been exposed to some graphic sites <br/>
thanks to the suggestion of boys he met at day camp (which he told me <br/>
about).  He has watched some movies with and also with his Dad (who <br/>
falls asleep and is less comfortable exploring consequential <br/>
conversation of sexual content).  My son loves humor and to my <br/>
chargin, Family Guy on Fox.  He has some new 13 old homeschool <br/>
friends who have introduced him to the conversations that boys this <br/>
age start to have (which my son has also shared with me).  I have an <br/>
awesome and open relationship with my son.  He&#39;d rather talk with me <br/>
about sex than his Dad.  AND, my husband and I have a new <br/>
masterbedroom and an 11 roommate.  Sometimes he starts out in his own <br/>
bed but more often sleeps with us.  When he&#39;s with us,all we do is <br/>
sleep.  He likes to be cuddled by both my husband and myself.  He&#39;s a <br/>
fantastic kid who is boyish, brawny, wild and sensative.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that he is &quot;humping&quot; , thrusting, moaning, basically <br/>
imitating it all and cracking himself up with his 8 year old sister <br/>
as the audience.  I am concerned and have not been able to help <br/>
myself by initiating conversation about the appropriateness of his <br/>
behavior while being careful not to shame or embarass him.  I&#39;ve <br/>
asked him to take it to him room.  Encouraged him to do what ever <br/>
dance he needs to do infront of is mirror, take his clothes off and <br/>
shake his booty in his room but to be considerate of his sister to no <br/>
avail.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday they asked me about rape and then went off into a silly <br/>
dialog that unnerved me then made me mad at them and then at myself, <br/>
questioning my parenting.  Last night my daugther leaped ontop of my <br/>
husband and did a little humping action herself and he sent her to <br/>
her room.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family history includes a step dad who molested his <br/>
sister.  My mother was a teenage mother at 16 who made my crazy with <br/>
fear about sex so we maybe hyper-sensative to his behavior.  I <br/>
thought my approach would take us in a different direction where they <br/>
would find the subject more matter of fact.  I have been very frank <br/>
and open with both kids when questions arise.  I want them to feel <br/>
good about their sexuality but aware of the consequences.  <br/>
<br/>
I would welcome any suggestions on what I should, or shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
doing.  I have suggested in the past that they allow their friends&#39; <br/>
parents enjoy the same kinds of intimate discussions rather than <br/>
being the kids on the block who are giving sex education on the back <br/>
step.  I just wouldn&#39;t want their behavior to extend to friends and <br/>
be an invitation for trouble now or in the future.<br/>
Thanks,</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692259931">I was sexually molested as a child, and so when our kids joked about   <br/>
that (at the same age) I was also offended. I did tell them, that I  <br/>
did not like that kind of talk because someone did that to me as a  <br/>
child. I also said that talking like that in public could really hurt  <br/>
someone else as well, so that they needed to think about it. There  <br/>
was no shame in it, I didn&#39;t lecture or yell, it was just information.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have a pretty good relationship, and they know that we can  <br/>
talk about those things seriously, but I don&#39;t like joking about rape  <br/>
or masturbation.<br/>
