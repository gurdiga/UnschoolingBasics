<br/>
From the site: &quot;The Alternatives to Compulsory Education Conference is an opportunity to hear new ideas, share resources, but most of all to develop a community among those who are interested in ways to promote education to everyone interested in learning without the involvement of compulsory institutions. It is hoped that attendees will actively support other individuals and organizations through a process of transparency whereby best practices can be shared and the viability of educating without compulsory schools will be firmly entrenched and legitimized. Organizations are encouraged to bring brochures as well as flyers about their upcoming events for distribution. Everyone is encouraged to network.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
