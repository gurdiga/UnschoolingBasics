<div id="ygrps-yiv-561873408">This thought has been dancing in my head for a few days now.<br/>
So I&#39;ll just post it.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, never did well in public nor private school.<br/>
Reaching for C&#39;s was a stretch.  She never learned to like <br/>
reading until she was 25yo and had just delivered her first<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
This young lady had dropped out of school at age 15, prior to <br/>
ever setting foot into a high school.  After having her son, she <br/>
decided that she wanted to learn.  She wanted to read before her <br/>
son did.  She went to the community college and had to take remedial <br/>
classes and such.  She earned her B.A. and her first real job is a <br/>
teacher at the local public high school.   Her son just turned eight. <br/>
<br/>
She has since married, had another child, and I must say, even though <br/>
her path isn&#39;t mine.  She got where she wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
My point?  There are many paths.  As parents, we should help our <br/>
children find theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad my parents never thought about unschooling.</div>
