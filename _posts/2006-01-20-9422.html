<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128476540">I just read the post about boys reading and for one I wanted to share that I<br/>
read that the reason boys read later than girls is the material they are<br/>
&#39;expected&#39; to read doesn&#39;t interest them.  Here is a site you might check<br/>
out...not that I am agreeing with everything he says but I think there are<br/>
some valid points not to mention some good ideas of things to suggest:<br/>

 <br/>
Also, at the end of Kelly&#39;s reply to the original &quot;reading&#39; post she wrote,<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s your hurry?&quot;  it struck me differently than any other time in my<br/>
life and I think it will become my mantra of sorts.  It also goes well with<br/>
something Ren posted in reply to my post on control, &quot;Fanny Crosby said<br/>
&quot;Live in the moment and make it so beautiful that it will be worth<br/>
remembering.&quot;  Thank you both for the words of wisdom!<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>
