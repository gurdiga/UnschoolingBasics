<div id="ygrps-yiv-162469938">Hello, I just joined, and wanted to introduce myself and possibly get <br/>
some advice.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lindsay, and I am 25 and married for a year to my beloved, <br/>
Dan. Six months ago my family had a tragedy, and everything changed. <br/>
My husband&#39;s brother and sister and their respective spouses had gone <br/>
on a weekend away when they were killed by a drunk driver. Between <br/>
the two families, there are 7 children, from age 4 to 13. My husband <br/>
was listed as back-up guardian in both sets of wills (they are a very <br/>
close family, and the primary guardians were all killed.)<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we are now parenting 7 children very, very suddenly. The <br/>
legal aspects have just been completed, and we are now legal <br/>
guardians for all the children. We have also just bought a new house <br/>
where we will all fit.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are grieving, but luckily they have one another. But they <br/>
are in new schools, and several of the kids are refusing to go. They <br/>
are afraid to be away from Dan and me and  each other <br/>
(understandably!) because they are afraid something will happen to <br/>
more people they love.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are lawyers at the very beginning of our careers, <br/>
but suddenly taking care of these kids seems more important. With the <br/>
life insurance money from both families, it is extremely doable that <br/>
either (or even both of us) could just not work and be home with the <br/>
kids. If either of us do that, it will change forever the kind of <br/>
careers we will have.<br/>
<br/>
But a few years ago I read Summerhill and Holt, and I think that <br/>
unschooling would be the perfect thing for the kids. They need time <br/>
and love. Other relatives think they should just be in school, and <br/>
that we should use the money to hire help. A couple have suggested <br/>
that the kids could be sent to boarding school. But they have lost so <br/>
much already.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? Would school give them more normalcy?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the kids are Annie, 10, Trey, 7, Lilly, 4, and Sophie, <br/>
13, Emma, 11, Becca, 9, and Phin, 7.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975944412">Hi Lindsay and Dan.  Wow, what a tragic story.  I wish you all  well as you <br/>
all adjust to so many changes and so much pain.<br/>
 <br/>
Most of our group is at the Live and Learn unschooling conference, so our  <br/>
list will be quiet for a week or so.<br/>
 <br/>
Others will have such great advise.  My thought is that maybe you  offer each <br/>
child a choice of whether they want to go to school or stay  home.  They have <br/>
had so many changes, maybe they could decide which place  will help them <br/>
adjust to their new life.  Chances are some may choose  school at first, then <br/>
maybe as they get more settled they will be ready to stay  home.<br/>
 <br/>
I do believe that unschooling heals children.  There are a few people  on <br/>
this list that have adopted children in great need of healing.   Hopefully they <br/>
will have some advise for you.<br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>
Leslie in SC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384741639">Dear Lindsay,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your letter brought tears to my eyes.  I&#39;m so sorry for your family&#39;s loss.<br/>
And I want to give you & your dh hugs for creating a safe home for the<br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
You ask if school would give them more normalcy.  But it sounds like the<br/>
children are already telling you what they want - they want to stay home, to<br/>
be with each other & with you & Dan, where they feel safe & loved.  I&#39;m<br/>
guessing your relatives are giving advice by thinking about what they would<br/>
do in your situation.  Just because they might put the children in school or<br/>
send them to boarding school, does not mean they are thinking of the best<br/>
interests of the children.  It sounds like you are.  Follow your heart.<br/>
Welcome to the list.  <br/>

<br/>
Welcome Lindsay... I&#39;m very sorry for your losses and how wonderful that  <br/>
these children have a single place to go to and someone to love them and care  <br/>
for them...<br/>
 <br/>
In my opinion, I think they need each other to heal and deal with their  <br/>
grief. Let them talk about their feelings, react to their feelings and just  &quot;be&quot;. <br/>
I know, from my own experiences, schools don&#39;t always handle grief very  <br/>
well... with so many issues each individual may or may not have, sometimes the  <br/>
important stuff gets swept under the carpet and no good results from that.<br/>
 <br/>
Are either you or your husband able to work from home? I wouldn&#39;t think you  <br/>
would necessarily have to end your careers, just shift a little. See what <br/>
could  work for you. Maybe you could work at home some days while your husband is <br/>
at  the office and vice versa. You need to figure out what will be best for <br/>
you and  your family.<br/>
 <br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t worry about what other family members say... shipping them  <br/>
off to boarding school?? Yikes! You are the childrens&#39; legal guardians now.  <br/>
There must have been a good reason why you and your husband were chosen and not  <br/>
other family members. Those kids need each other right now, not to be torn <br/>
apart  anymore. They need time to heal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320683798">Oh my heart!!  How sad!  God bless you and your husband for taking in these<br/>
poor children.  They NEED family around them right now. It sounds like they<br/>
are telling you that very loud and clear.  Those children&#39;s whole world has<br/>
changed, as far as they are concerned they have lost everything.  Unless<br/>
THEY want to and desire school that is the last thing they need right now.<br/>
They need to be able to live and grow confident in their new surroundings<br/>
and new &quot;parents&quot;.  Praise God that you won&#39;t have a financial burden if you<br/>
or hubby quits working..so many people choose to live as one income families<br/>
and struggle financially their whole lives but they are so happy as a family<br/>
because they have that family bond and closeness  that working parents just<br/>
can&#39;t have with their children.  Listen to the kids.ask them what THEY want<br/>
and do what they want.  Don&#39;t listen to relatives and others who are not in<br/>
your shoes or the shoes of those children who are grieving.  Boarding<br/>
school???!!!!!  You have got to be kidding me!  That sounds to me like<br/>
whoever suggested that just doesn&#39;t want to see the grieving children or<br/>
have to deal with their grief..better to send the child away and let<br/>
somebody else deal with their grief!<br/>
<br/>
I will be praying for you and your husband and your new responsibilities.<br/>
Hope things smooth out for you guys!<br/>
<br/>
Much love and prayers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011632783">Welcome Lindsay,<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear your tragic story, but how lucky for the kids to <br/>
be able to be together. <br/>
<br/>
I agree that they need time to grieve at home, where it&#39;s safe.  Take <br/>
the time and talk with them, let them share what they feel they need <br/>
right now.  If you&#39;re able to do that financially, then what a gift <br/>
you will give them.<br/>
<br/>
As someone posted, most of the &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers are at the <br/>
Live and Learn Conference thru the weekend, but if you have a chance <br/>
to go back and read through some of the archives this is a great <br/>
group for newbies to unschooling.  My daughter just finished 6th <br/>
grade, and is deschooling big time.  I researched homeschooling <br/>
starting over 2 years ago, found unschooling, have read tons of <br/>
books, websites, joined (and unjoined!) several yahoo groups and have <br/>
found the people here to be so supportive.   I KNOW that unschooling <br/>
is what&#39;s best for my child.   Feel free to share some of your <br/>
thoughts here (even with many of the more experienced unschoolers <br/>
gone for the week),  sometimes it helps to have a place where you <br/>
know you can ask questions where others understand and have been <br/>
there (or in some cases are still &quot;there&quot;!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814133246">Dear Lindsay:  Thank you for reaching out to this unschoolers list at this time of incredible tragedy and change for you, your husband and your new family.  There is alot of hope and wisdom here.  I&#39;m new to the unschooling philosophy (have been homeschooling for 3 years but only in the last year have shifted to unschooling.)   We have three adopted children, my daughter decided to go to school this year, my boys are unschooling (they&#39;re 12).  My partner and I also  work, so it is possible to continue careers with adjustments.  As other people have counseled, it sounds as if the children are guiding you towards what they need and want.  It may not be the same for all of them, in terms of what they need to grieve and process all this change.  What a gift that you both have the time, space, heart, to welcome them into your family.  I send you all my thoughts and prayers.  love, Ann.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936168176">School would give them all KINDS of additional pressures and stresses  <br/>
and steal a lot of their time which could be used for bonding and  <br/>
healing - with you and each other. If they go to school, you&#39;ll spend  <br/>
ALL your time on logistics - getting them dressed and fed and  <br/>
homework done and all that. And you&#39;re guaranteed to develop at least  <br/>
a somewhat adversarial relationship with them when you have to make  <br/>
them do stuff. I really don&#39;t see any way that putting them in school  <br/>
could be better than a nice long vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Give them the gift of a year of peace and support and envelop them in  <br/>
your new large family life. You don&#39;t have to make a commitment for  <br/>
&quot;forever&quot; - just take this year.<br/>
<br/>
And - I also left a high-powered career to be a homeschooling parent  <br/>
- I wouldn&#39;t trade one MINUTE of homeschooling for my foregone career.<br/>
<br/>
Also - you might be surprised what can happen, work-wise, when you  <br/>
step off of the conventional path - you might end up with a far more  <br/>
satisfying career, anyway, once you start thinking creatively it is  <br/>
amazing what completely unexpected developments arise.<br/>

<br/>
Time and love don&#39;t happen at school. You&#39;re right though, that is the<br/>
best thing for them...time and love that is.:)<br/>
What a wonderful thing that they have you in this terrible tragedy.<br/>
I really don&#39;t think there is anything &quot;normal&quot; about school, it&#39;s a<br/>
false environment at best. I don&#39;t see how sucking it up and suffering<br/>
more helps anyone...especially a grieving child.<br/>
School is abuse of the human spirit, they&#39;ve been through more than<br/>
most  young people in this country will ever suffer, give them freedom<br/>
of choice and plenty of wonderful things to do outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Please start reading some of the things listed in the &quot;links&quot; section<br/>
of this site. I really, really wish you could all get to St. Louis for<br/>
the conference this weekend. Maybe next year? If you could all get<br/>
there, you can register at the door.:)<br/>

<br/>
Like the others who have replied I commend you both for opening your home<br/>
and hearts to loving your nephews and nieces, even while you must be<br/>
grieving also. I agree with Pam that treating life as temporary vacation<br/>
would be a great idea, to help the children move from a place of fear to a<br/>
place of confidence. I&#39;m sure that incipient puberty is complicating the<br/>
emotions of some of your children. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My husband and I are lawyers at the very beginning of our careers, <br/>
but suddenly taking care of these kids seems more important. With the <br/>
life insurance money from both families, it is extremely doable that <br/>
either (or even both of us) could just not work and be home with the <br/>
kids. If either of us do that, it will change forever the kind of <br/>
careers we will have. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your heart and intuition are telling you the truth, I think. Taking care of<br/>
these kids *is* more important. I hope that you can see this as an<br/>
opportunity to embrace freedom for yourselves, and find creative ways to<br/>
still practice. Many people do not have financial freedoms that allow them<br/>
to consider the choice of one parent being home, let alone both. It makes a<br/>
lot of difference to my dd to have her father and I with her most of the<br/>
time - although in our case that was due to an injury. <br/>
<br/>
BTW there is a group called National Home Education Legal Defense - the<br/>
goals and mission are spelled out at the website www.nheld.com . They are a<br/>
secular group of lawyers, not to be confused with HSLDA. It is probably too<br/>
soon to think about this, but here may be a way to continue to foster your<br/>
interest in law and bring your expertise to bear with a group that can<br/>
always use more help.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What do you think? Would school give them more normalcy? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that normalcy is something to be desired when their emotional<br/>
situation is so far from normal. Boarding school is certainly not a normal<br/>
situation. Take it from one who&#39;s been there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038889348">Hi Lindsay...<br/>
It&#39;s best for you to follow their lead.  These<br/>
children have been through enough -- things they had<br/>
no control over.  Give them back some control.  If<br/>
they don&#39;t want to attend school, don&#39;t make them.  If<br/>
any of them really want school, allow them to attend. <br/>
Let them make the choice and support them either way.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry for what you and your family have gone<br/>
through.  I encourage you to hang out here and ask any<br/>
and all questions you might have and read everything<br/>
you can about unschooling.<br/>

your husband in the same type of law (ie family, crimnal, etc) because<br/>
you might consider opening your own law firm as it seems you may have the<br/>
funds available and if so then you could both &quot;take turns&quot; being there<br/>

<br/>
even though I am no seasoned unschooler, I feel compelled to respond because<br/>
your post so touched me. I feel terribly sorry for you and your dh&#39;s loss,<br/>
as well as the children&#39;s loss, it is so tragic! On the other hand, I feel<br/>
happy and relieved for the children for they have wonderful guardians who<br/>
are so willing to consider their true needs! I think they are very lucky and<br/>
would like to tell you how touched it made me to read the words you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
You asked abt school and normalcy. I don&#39;t see how going to school will make<br/>
things or them &quot;normal&quot;- imagine them seeing parents of their classmates<br/>
picking them up from sch, attending activities, eating foods from home, etc<br/>
etc. Their state now is far from &quot;normalcy&quot;, goodness, they just lost their<br/>
parents! It may take years for them to work out their grief. I agree with<br/>
what all the others have said, they need a lot of space to grief, think<br/>
things through, and be in a space of love and safety. Thank goodness it is<br/>
possible for this to happen!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I will really like to recommend the book &quot;Hold on to your<br/>
Kids&quot;- even tho it is geared towards parents, I think everyone shd read it.<br/>
It will lead to an understanding why the &quot;normal&quot; way our society function,<br/>
or treat children, is actually heading us to problems. It may also show you<br/>
(or rather your relatives) why it is so crucial now for the children to be<br/>
able to have your love and guidance, instead of being thrown off to school.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to have an open heart, and this will lead you and the children<br/>
well! Your post actually gave me much food for thought, and much hope,<br/>
because I see a caring soul who understands the truly important things in<br/>
life, and this inspires me, so I thank you!<br/>
<br/>
You did not say which state you are in, maybe if you do there are<br/>
unschoolers near you who can give you some support. It may also be good for<br/>
the kids to know/meet other children who do not go to school, and do not<br/>
need to go. Explore the idea of unschooling with them and see how they feel<br/>
about it.<br/>
Find support for yourself too, I am sure you will need it some time down the<br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
All the best to you and your new family!!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077935288">Is it possible for one or both of you to have a home-based practise?<br/>
<br/>
Even if you both have to work out of the home, can there be some<br/>
flexibility that allows tag teaming child care between parents and a<br/>
hired person, at least until the oldest / older 2 are old enough to<br/>
help out, possibly for a small wage?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to another country for a one year program, and am the<br/>
primary (only, except for 3 days every 2 weeks) caregiver of my 6 yr<br/>
old now.  Initially, I thought I would have to leave my son with<br/>
extended family, or a close friend.  This was unacceptable to us both.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I went at it from the other end...  what are our needs?  Then the<br/>
way to make it happen seems clearer, and an easier jump.  I have<br/>
arranged for a young teen peer of my son to be a live in nanny, for<br/>
room & board + small monthly allowance.  It&#39;s a great opportunity for<br/>
her to experience another culture with security, and a perfect<br/>
solution for us.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your family comes to a solution without  any more pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545777523">Oh, bless you!  Thank you for taking these children in and <br/>
investigating unschooling.  If you or your husband are willing to <br/>
take a year off and just be with the kids, I think it would make a <br/>
world of difference in their healing process.  After that year, you <br/>
can all discuss, as a family, if they want to stay home or if they <br/>
want to go to school.  I can&#39;t imagine how putting a child that has <br/>
just lost both parents into school could be at all helpful.  How can <br/>
they possible concentrate when their world has been torn apart?  By <br/>
making it for a year to begin with, you don&#39;t have to project into <br/>
the future and worry about careers etc.  Just do what you need to <br/>
right now, the future will be there later to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
I have a PhD in science and spent many years building a successful <br/>
career.  When my son was born, I was just going to stay home with him <br/>
for a year.  He is six now and I don&#39;t plan on ever going back to <br/>
work full-time.  Being with him means so much more than any career <br/>
ever could.  But, I have found some fun and creative ways to still be <br/>
involved in science (and make some money).<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the best.  You are doing an amazing thing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508092587">Thank God those children have you two.  It is a huge leap of faith, <br/>
but I have to think that to model trust in their learning can only <br/>
help the children regain some of teh trust in the universe that they <br/>
must have lost.<br/>
<br/>
School won&#39;t help them bond, build trust in you and themselves, or <br/>
heal their pain.  But maybe you can.  Stay home, watch good movies, <br/>
play games and make some gentle unschooling friends.<br/>
<br/>
Also, others may be able to speak more to this (and check out <br/>
sandradood.com on unschooling school <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a> ).  Basically, what I have heard <br/>
people say is that you may have school in your life, but it is just <br/>
some *thing* in your life~not *the* thing that will bring normalcy to <br/>
you lives.  I really liked a book called _The Intentional Family_ by <br/>
William Doherty.   Here&#39;s a link  to amazon:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038073205X/002-8263217-2710409?">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038073205X/002-8263217-2710409?</a><br/>
v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance<br/>
<br/>
This book is a user friendly book that describes rituals you can use <br/>
at home (candles at dinner or going around the table saying favorite <br/>
parts of the day) pretty easily that create community feeling.  I <br/>
have to say, tho, that I haven&#39;t looked at it in a few years and it <br/>
may be very &quot;schooly&quot; as I was a different person then (but we still <br/>
do a lot of the rituals).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the children may choose school, and some may stay home.  You <br/>
sound so respectful of them already, you are on the right track <br/>
already no matter what you choose.<br/>
<br/>
As for the money, just because they are all home doesn&#39;t mean you may <br/>
not still use some of it for help.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling/homeschooling is something that people (relatives) <br/>
frequently have objections to, or even gentle concerns about. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, as &quot;instant&quot; parents, you guys haven&#39;t already lived <br/>
through everyone having an opinion about your babies; clothes, <br/>
nursery colors, names, how you are carrying your babies, binkies, <br/>
breast feeding, sleeping, carrying, crying, consoling/not consoling, <br/>
reading, tv, gun toys, natural foods, additives, detergent types, <br/>
time outs, etc, to name a few things my family has expressed an <br/>
opinion about LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes and much admiration and love for you and those children.<br/>
<br/>
Peace~Jessica</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370410097">You know something.....all this talk about careers and quitting careers <br/>
to stay home with kids made me think of a conversation I had with one of <br/>
my teenage daughters recently.  She just graduated this past year and is <br/>
in college now, but she doesn&#39;t drive yet.  She is extremely nervous and <br/>
hates driving.  I have made her drive more and more lately (with me of <br/>
course since she doesnt&#39; have her license yet!) hoping that her <br/>
confidence will build and she will start driving herself to things.  She <br/>
attends college, coaches cheerleading at the community ballpark, has a <br/>
weekly babysitting job and weekly cleaning job and I cart her back and <br/>
forth to all this stuff.  My husband and I are getting ready to leave <br/>
town for 3 weeks at the end of this month to go on a trip cross country <br/>
to celebrate our anniversary (we are taking our 9-yr-old with us and he <br/>
is so excited!)  Anyway, I have been preparing my dd for this separation <br/>
because she is going to have to drive herself around town (unless she <br/>
sweet talks grandma and grandpa to cart her everywhere....LOL)  She made <br/>
the comment recently that she is going to miss me and our talks when I <br/>
am out of town and she doesn&#39;t want to drive by herself back and <br/>
forth....she LIKES me driving her around because we talk and cut up and <br/>
hang out.  I felt so honored! <br/>
<br/>
I was a single mom early on in my twenties and I went to college, worked <br/>
full time and raised 3 small children by myself for 5 years before I <br/>
remarried.  Once I remarried, my husband and I decided to have a child <br/>
of our own and when he was born a year later I wanted to quit work and <br/>
stay home with our son.  I ended up working until he was two and by then <br/>
my other children were in middle school.  I worked in dialysis at the <br/>
hospital and loved my job but I was always taking off work to chaperone <br/>
field trips and do things with the kids.  My boss told me one day I <br/>
needed to make a decision whether I was going to have a career there or <br/>
be a mom.....so I quit!  Without even discussing it with my husband.  He <br/>
about freaked when I told him. <br/>
<br/>
Well that was 7 years ago now and I praise God every day that I have <br/>
been able to stay home with the kids.  Since my daughter has started <br/>
college this year she has asked me recently if I have any desire to go <br/>
back to work at the hospital one day and I told her heck no!  I was in <br/>
the medical field for 10 years and loved every bit of it but now that I <br/>
am out of it and have expanded my horizons and lived life I have so many <br/>
other interests I would pursue before ever going back to work in that <br/>
field.  Sort of like unschooling!  I was allowed to spread my wings and <br/>
fly the last 10 years along with my children and I have learned so much <br/>
and experienced so many things.  It has been an awesome time of growth!  <br/>
Thanks for listening..........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337781309">What wonderful responses you&#39;ve been getting to your post!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share this site for you (nhen.org, they list support <br/>
groups in every state), in case you want to try to find local <br/>
homeschooling support groups (there are often a lot of unschoolers <br/>
who belong to these groups as well) and also if you post what state <br/>
you&#39;re in here there might be some members who can help you get <br/>
started (depending too on what your state&#39;s homeschooling <br/>
requirements are - in some states you don&#39;t have to do anything, <br/>
others, like mine (MA) are more particular, but fortunately we have <br/>
some great sites for guidance and I also belong to a MA yahoo group <br/>
that has been very helpful in getting started as far as what&#39;s <br/>
required by my state).   You might want to do a search on yahoo <br/>
groups (&quot;unschooling&quot; and your state name, or if you just put <br/>
unschooling, you can look through what you come up with to see if <br/>
there&#39;s any in your particular state).<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us posted.  I&#39;m sending hugs and love in your direction.<br/>

Hello, I just joined, and wanted to introduce myself and possibly get <br/>
some advice.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lindsay, and I am 25 and married for a year to my beloved, <br/>
Dan. Six months ago my family had a tragedy, and everything changed. <br/>
My husband&#39;s brother and sister and their respective spouses had gone <br/>
on a weekend away when they were killed by a drunk driver. Between <br/>
the two families, there are 7 children, from age 4 to 13. My husband <br/>
was listed as back-up guardian in both sets of wills (they are a very <br/>
close family, and the primary guardians were all killed.)<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we are now parenting 7 children very, very suddenly. The <br/>
legal aspects have just been completed, and we are now legal <br/>
guardians for all the children. We have also just bought a new house <br/>
where we will all fit.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are grieving, but luckily they have one another. But they <br/>
are in new schools, and several of the kids are refusing to go. They <br/>
are afraid to be away from Dan and me and  each other <br/>
(understandably!) because they are afraid something will happen to <br/>
more people they love.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are lawyers at the very beginning of our careers, <br/>
but suddenly taking care of these kids seems more important. With the <br/>
life insurance money from both families, it is extremely doable that <br/>
either (or even both of us) could just not work and be home with the <br/>
kids. If either of us do that, it will change forever the kind of <br/>
careers we will have.<br/>
<br/>
But a few years ago I read Summerhill and Holt, and I think that <br/>

and love. Other relatives think they should just be in school, and <br/>

that the kids could be sent to boarding school. But they have lost so <br/>
much already.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? Would school give them more normalcy?<br/>
