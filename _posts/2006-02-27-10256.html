<div id="ygrps-yiv-928459366">&quot; Veronica has down syndrome and I have to <br/>
say I question myself regarding her all the time.  I find very <br/>
little support for homeschooling her.  I belong to a few yahoo <br/>
groups but - they are pretty mainstream homeschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, my advice would be to get off those lists!! But that&#39;s a<br/>
personal thing.<br/>
I have cared for kids with Downs and I just don&#39;t understand all the<br/>
push for them to be taught and schooled.  I believe that while there<br/>
are obvious physical and mental differences with Downs, they can learn<br/>
beautifully with unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling is all about meeting the child&#39;s needs in their own unique<br/>
way, so if there is something that helps her, you&#39;ll find it right?<br/>
And letting every child simply BE who they are is so important in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I love about DS people? They tend to be so SUNNY! They<br/>
take joy in the little things and smile SO much....what a great<br/>
example of living the unschooling life. I say trust her and let her<br/>
just BE.<br/>
<br/>
So much of the things I&#39;ve read on schooling kids with differences, is<br/>
how to make them fit in to society. How about honoring them for who<br/>
they are today? I think the things she loves and will be best at, will<br/>
show up even better in an environment of support and TRUST.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>
