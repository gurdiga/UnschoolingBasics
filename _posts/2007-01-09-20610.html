<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826751534">We&#39;re planning to have a family meeting about some changes in our<br/>
budget.  We are currently on the brink of a significant financial<br/>
crisis and need to get our spending better under control.  It won&#39;t<br/>
impact the kids allowances, but it will greatly reduce the number of<br/>
toys, games, etc. that they get every month (pretty much from getting<br/>
something everytime we shop, to primarily using what they saved in<br/>
their allowance for things and getting things at the holidays).  I<br/>
admit, I&#39;m pretty naughty when it comes to getting the kids extra<br/>
toys, etc.  I just see something and think how much my kids (and often<br/>
I, lol) would enjoy it.  Also, I rarely say &quot;no&quot; to them when they ask<br/>
for something at the stores.  All of this has contributed to our<br/>
financial problems.  It&#39;s also led to significant organization<br/>
problems, as there is not enough places to store all the stuff we buy.<br/>
<br/>
We have talked about the budget before, when making or not making<br/>
purchases.  For example, I&#39;ll say that we don&#39;t have enough money this<br/>
week, but maybe next week we can get the item.  Or we&#39;ll get one item<br/>
and tell them to put the other on their wish list.  We do this weekly,<br/>
but this next budget is going to be much more drastic and I&#39;m<br/>
wondering how to discuss this with them and handle it at the store,<br/>
when I&#39;m going to be saying that we have to hold up on things much<br/>
more than we have in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193083614">Since you seem to have so many toys (hence the storage problem)... <br/>
what about getting together with some friends so the kids can have <br/>
a &quot;toy swap&quot;. That way you can clear out some of the clutter and the <br/>
kids can have some new toys. All without spending a dime :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340773471">What we do is talk about what money we DO have to spend (above the basics and their weekly amount) and decide what to do with the &#39;extra&#39; together.  We like to do this - especially - with the change jug...<br/>
