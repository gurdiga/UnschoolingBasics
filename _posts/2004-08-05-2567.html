<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795759650">I haven&#39;t read the book yet, but I watched the video today.  It was a <br/>
seminar put on by the author explaining his philosophy.  It was <br/>
wonderful.  It really was the blue print I needed in relation to <br/>
parenting as an unschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, though.  Watching it made me more aware of unschooling <br/>
and what I already knew to be true in my heart.  I was surprised at <br/>
how much I really knew already, the things that are common sense to <br/>
me that I have taken for granted.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend it to everyone.  The title is almost misleading as <br/>
it applied to parenting every child, not just explosive children.  <br/>
The title almost turned me away, because I wasn&#39;t sure that it <br/>
applied to my son.  I think it would be especially valuable to those <br/>
coming to the unschooling way of life later in the game.  <br/>
