Our first Breaking Pavement column, by Idzie, a grown unschooler.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/06/bare-feet-and-learning-connections/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/06/bare-feet-and-learning-connections/</a><br/>
<br/>
An excerpt<br/>
...And I started thinking about *why* I like going barefoot. What about this<br/>
no shoes thing makes me so happy? I realized that what it really is, the<br/>
connection. With shoes, I�m putting yet one more barrier between me and the<br/>
world around me. Without them, I feel more connected to the<br/>
dirt-grass-gravel-pavement-mud.<br/>
<br/>
Connection is so important.<br/>
<br/>
Connection�to people and place (or, should I say, connection to all Peoples,<br/>
not just the human kind. Yes, I am a hippie.)�is what makes life good.<br/>
Connections are also what fuel learning. I might go so far as to say<br/>
*all*learning is the making of connections! ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219828543">A wonderful new column by Heather Burditt of Swiss Army Wife blog.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/11/unschoolingad/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/11/unschoolingad/</a>&gt;Heather is a gifted<br/>
writer. She writes eloquently about radical unschooling and loving life with<br/>
her children.<br/>
<br/>
This month she touches on the issue of unexpected tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling after Death<br/>
<br/>
I had a few articles started for this. With Halloween just leaving, I was<br/>
writing about unlimited candy! Then I had found some cool science<br/>
experiments you can do with candy, so I was going to mention those. Cool<br/>
stuff you can do with candy beside�s eat it? Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
That will all have to wait though, because I�m feeling quite serious today.<br/>
I opened my facebook yesterday and learned that an Unschooling dad had<br/>
passed away. It would appear that he was posting about not feeling good and<br/>
having a fever for a few days, but I read this morning that he also may have<br/>
had a heart condition. He will truly be missed by many, reading the comments<br/>
on his wall I am blown away by the size of his family.<br/>
