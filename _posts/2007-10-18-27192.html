<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000673343">As we sometimes say in our house (in an exaggerated British accent, for  some <br/>
reason) &quot;I&#39;m not too bright, but I&#39;m pretty.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
A very kind person just pointed out I had the dates for the conference  <br/>
wrong. It is May 23-25, with the picnic on Monday, the 26th. <br/>
 <br/>
Be patient. I am addled.<br/>
