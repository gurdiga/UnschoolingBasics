Wow, that was just harsh. And I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s not just this post, <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
lots of them, I just chose to respond to this one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we don&#39;t want to hear the message we vilify the messengers.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found the honesty from those on this list refreshingly motivating.  It <br/>
has worked for my family whose parents (hubby and I) needed it to drive us <br/>
beyond the point of resisting change.  For what its worth, every area in which we <br/>
have surrendered our control has been hugely successful and made for a much <br/>
happier bunch of young people and adults.  We have found it very true that <br/>
children instinctually do make the best choices for themselves.  For the past nine <br/>
years we were sure they needed us to make their decisions for them.  We were <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion for those who read and believe and embrace the idea of <br/>
unschooling but don&#39;t like the method in which the message is being delivered--try it <br/>
anyway!  Let go. Open your mind - fully.  There is a reason you joined this <br/>
list.  These are not new ideas, this is the way things have been done forever, <br/>
before the industrial revolution, before modern man made all the silly <br/>
buildings to put the future little conformists in.  The apes still do it this way...   <br/>
<br/>
Go out and play.  Leave the laundry and go dig in the dirt with your kids. <br/>
Learn from each other.  This is how life is supposed to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Robin, who is surprised at how protective she feels about the mentors on this <br/>
list. <br/>
