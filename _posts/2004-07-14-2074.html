&quot;The Little Boy&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Once a little boy went to school. <br/>
He was quite a little boy. <br/>
And it was quite a big school. <br/>
But when the little boy <br/>
Found that he could go to his room <br/>
By walking right in from the door outside, <br/>
He was happy. <br/>
And the school did not seem quite so big <br/>
<br/>
Anymore. <br/>
<br/>
One morning, <br/>
When the little boy had been in school awhile, <br/>
The teacher said, <br/>
&quot;Today we are going to make a picture.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Good,&quot; thought the little boy. <br/>
He liked to make pictures. <br/>
He could make all kinds, <br/>
Lions and tigers, <br/>
Chickens and cows, <br/>
Trains and boats. <br/>
And he took out his box of crayons <br/>
And began to draw. <br/>
<br/>
But the teacher said, &quot;Wait, <br/>
It is not time to begin.&quot; <br/>
And she waited until everyone looked ready. <br/>
&quot;Now,&quot; said the teacher, &quot;We are going to make flowers.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Good!&quot; thought the little boy. <br/>
He liked to make flowers. <br/>
And he began to make beautiful ones <br/>
With his pink and blue and orange crayons. <br/>
<br/>
But the teacher said, &quot;Wait,&quot; <br/>
And I will show you how.&quot; <br/>
And she drew a flower on the blackboard. <br/>
It was red with a green stem. <br/>
&quot;There,&quot; said the teacher, <br/>
&quot;Now you may begin.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The little boy looked at the teacher&#39;s flower. <br/>
Then he looked at his own flower. <br/>
He liked his own flower better than the teacher&#39;s. <br/>
But he did not say this. <br/>
He just turned his paper over <br/>
And made a flower like the teacher&#39;s. <br/>
It was red with a green stem. <br/>
<br/>
On another day <br/>
When the little boy had opened <br/>
The door from the outside all by himself, <br/>
The teacher said, &quot;Today we are going to <br/>
Make something with clay.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Good!&quot; thought the little boy. <br/>
<br/>
He liked clay. <br/>
He could make all kinds of things <br/>
With clay: <br/>
Snakes and snowmen, <br/>
Elephants and mice, <br/>
Cars and trucks. <br/>
He began to pull and pinch his ball of clay. <br/>
<br/>
But the teacher said, <br/>
&quot;Wait. It is not time to begin.&quot; <br/>
And she waited until everyone looked ready. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now,&quot; said the teacher, <br/>
&quot;We are going to make a dish.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Good!&quot; thought the little boy. <br/>
He liked to make dishes. <br/>
And he began to make some. <br/>
They were all shapes and sizes. <br/>
<br/>
But the teacher said, &quot;Wait, <br/>
And I will show you how.&quot; <br/>
And she showed everyone how to make <br/>
One deep dish. <br/>
&quot;There,&quot; said the teacher, <br/>
&quot;Now you may begin.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The little boy looked at the teacher&#39;s dish. <br/>
Then he looked at his own. <br/>
He liked his dishes better than the teacher&#39;s. <br/>
But he did not say this. <br/>
He just rolled his clay into a big ball. <br/>
Again. <br/>
And made a dish like the teacher&#39;s. <br/>
It was a deep dish. <br/>
<br/>
And pretty soon <br/>
The little boy learned to wait, <br/>
And to watch, <br/>
And to make things just like the teacher. <br/>
And pretty soon <br/>
He didn&#39;t make things of his own <br/>
<br/>
Anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Then it happened <br/>
That the little boy and his family moved to another city, <br/>
And the little boy had to go to another school. <br/>
This school was even bigger than the other one. <br/>
And there was no door from the outside into his room. <br/>
He had to go up some steps <br/>
And walk down a long hall <br/>
To get to his room. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the very first day he was there, <br/>
The teacher said, &quot;Today, <br/>
We are going to make a Picture.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Good!&quot; thought the little boy, <br/>
And he waited for the Teacher to tell him what to <br/>
do. <br/>
But the teacher didn&#39;t say anything. <br/>
She just walked around the room. <br/>
<br/>
When she came to the little Boy, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t you want <br/>
To make a picture?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the little boy. <br/>
&quot;What are we going to make?&quot; <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know until you make It,&quot; said the teacher. <br/>
&quot;How shall I make it? said the little boy. <br/>
&quot;Why, any way you like,&quot; said the teacher. <br/>
&quot;And any color?&quot; asked the little boy. <br/>
&quot;Any color,&quot; said the teacher. <br/>
&quot;If everyone makes the same Picture and uses the same Colors, how <br/>
would<br/>
I know who Made what and which was which?&quot; <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said the Little boy. <br/>
<br/>
And he began to make a flower. <br/>
<br/>
It was red, with a green stem. <br/>
