<div id="ygrps-yiv-666751732">I want to thank everyone for all the great ideas and activities as <br/>
well as for the inspiration! I decided on following this path for a <br/>
reason, and I&#39;m not ready to give up yet! I really believe in the <br/>
philosophy of unschooling...I just needed to be talked down off the <br/>
ledge! LOL! My ex-husband does put a lot of pressure on the situation <br/>
by making his &quot;demands&quot; for testing-and it&#39;s a power trip for him, but <br/>
since we have joint legal custody, he can really jam up the works for <br/>
us if I don&#39;t play along. I don&#39;t want them to be forced back into <br/>
school because I&#39;m not meeting his demands, y&#39;know. Anyhow-thanks to <br/>
everyone who responded to my long rambling and for reminding me that <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t LOOK like a regular public school day. Sometimes I <br/>
get so hung-up on that, but I will keep working at relaxing. I will <br/>
remind myself until it finally kicks in. Thanks again!<br/>
