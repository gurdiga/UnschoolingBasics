<div id="ygrps-yiv-830224798">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
today I&#39;d like to ask all of you if you go to work? Or do you all  <br/>
stay at home? Is unschooling only possible if there is always someone  <br/>
at home? What kind of jobs do you have, if any? Who brings &quot;the  <br/>

have to work so much in order to have enough for all that he (I&#39;ll  <br/>
just assume it&#39;s he) hardly gets to see his children? How about the  <br/>
relationship between him and the children? And if some work at home,  <br/>
how do you manage it, do the children leave you alone doing your  <br/>
work, do you have a schedule, how long do you work each day?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904224654">Hi Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
To answer your questions-first I am new to this, so I<br/>
don&#39;t know about the working and still being possible<br/>
to unschool.  I am a stay-at-home mom, and my husband<br/>
works.  I have been able to stay with the kids since<br/>
they were born.  It gets really tight with the money<br/>
sometimes, but if you are careful enough, it can work.<br/>
 My hubby goes to work, before the kids are out of bed<br/>
(7 a.m.), and is usually home by 4:30-5:00.  So he<br/>
gets plenty of time with the kids, especially since<br/>
his job is Monday - Friday, and no weekends.  He has a<br/>
wonderful relationship with the kids, and they even<br/>
help with his wood-working projects that we do on the<br/>
weekend.  (we are doing some renovating in the house).<br/>
 Sometimes I think their relationship is stronger,<br/>
because he does involve them with things he/we do<br/>
around the house, and he tells them what he does for a<br/>
job.  I hope this helps in some ways.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My co-parent is the primary &quot;bread winner.&quot;  He works very long hours<br/>
*and* he has an hour and a half commute each way.  He usually leaves<br/>
the house around 7:30 in the morning and comes home around 8:00-9:30<br/>
(if not later) However, since part of his job is computer programming<br/>
(the other part is network administration and engineering) he does<br/>
work from home 2 (or more) days a week.  I have a home based business<br/>
and my kids help me out with it by stamping catalogs, putting together<br/>
show packets, helping me with new recipes, putting my crate together<br/>
before shows and sometimes they even attend shows with me as my<br/>
&quot;beautiful and talented assistant&quot; (one at a time).  I do have a teen<br/>
and a tween and they are used to staying by themselves for stretches<br/>
of time and are very responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Does Dan have enough time with the kids?  No.  And sometimes he even<br/>
is working from home of fixing something on the weekends.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
like it.  We don&#39;t like it and we are looking for ways to change that.<br/>
 It is one reason he has started working from home a few days each<br/>
week.  He can actually get more done working at home with &quot;children<br/>
distration&quot; than he does at work with &quot;co-worker distraction.&quot;  Is one<br/>
income enough?  Hmmmm.  We make it.  It has become more difficult<br/>
because of the rising gas prices, the rise in home insurance rates<br/>
(thanks to hurricanes), having to buy a new car (thanks to the<br/>
aforementioned hurricanes) and the increase in property taxes.  We<br/>
have $800 more going out each month than we did 2 years ago when we<br/>
bought our house.<br/>

be available to them and not have a paying job. Because he would be <br/>

what we have. There are plenty of things we do to make it go <br/>
further. <br/>

He switched jobs last year for this reason. He was working full time <br/>
but his 40 hours varied each week, were spread out over 7 days and <br/>
he wasn&#39;t able to spend a lot of time with us. Now he works 40 hours <br/>
but it&#39;s M-F 7-5. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We adopted our three on 2003 so we&#39;re still ironing out some <br/>
kinks. :-) <br/>
<br/>
In our case, we made some changes when we decided on this lifestyle. <br/>
Like I said before, one of them was moving out of NYC. The other was <br/>
him changing jobs so the hours better suited us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411594995">Hubby and I both used to work - we would work opposite shifts in <br/>
order for one of us to be home for the girls.  We never had any <br/>
family time (unless you count the one day off hubby had on Sunday).<br/>
<br/>
With a cross country move and a new job, hubby works and I stay at <br/>
home.  For his job he works 2 weeks on and then has 2 weeks off.  So <br/>
we don&#39;t get to see him for a while, but he has 2 weeks vacation <br/>
every time he is home.  For the past 2 years it has been wonderful.  <br/>
It took some getting used to being alone for 2 weeks, but I now <br/>
enjoy the time - unschooling myself - LOL  The girls took it hard at <br/>
first, but now they don&#39;t seem to mind as much.  They hang out with <br/>
dad when he is home, and he often takes them places for daughter-dad <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
As for the money - he makes more in 2 weeks than I did at my <br/>
previous 35 hr/wk job in 4 weeks.  But his job is very physical and <br/>
dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
From my past experience telecommuting from home: I worked a split <br/>
shift 3 hours in the morning and 4 in the evening.  I tried to work <br/>
early in the morning before my kids were up (they were 4 and 1 then) <br/>
but if they were awake during my morning shift I would bring toys in <br/>
the office and they would play while I worked.  I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
make phone calls or anything so it was basically typing and <br/>
research.  Then hubby was home in the evening when I worked the last <br/>
4 hours. Some days were great, but others (especially as they got <br/>
older) were hectic.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anything is possible.  <br/>

Also on a Saturday he finishes up by 1pm. So he does manage to spend quite a bit of time at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505673916">I&#39;ve stayed home since I was pregnant with my eldest.  When he was one year<br/>
old, I started a home business (selling various baby carriers, like Maya<br/>
Wraps, Baby Bundlers, etc) that I ran for several hours a day, usually when<br/>
my husband was home or when the baby napped.  I sold my business just in<br/>
time to birth my 3rd child.  They business had grown, was demanding more of<br/>
my time, and I didn&#39;t feel I would have the resources to keep it going and<br/>
give all three boys what they would need from me at home.  Since then, 4<br/>
years ago, they&#39;ve been my main focus.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is the sole provider, now, and he makes enough for us to live<br/>
comfortably.  It wasn&#39;t always so.  We made major sacrifices in the<br/>
beginning so that I could be home with the boys.  Some might say we still<br/>
do.  We&#39;re a single car family, which some friends find &quot;shocking&quot;.  We<br/>
don&#39;t vacation every year.  We spend alot of our time at home (and home is<br/>
humble), exploring here on the mountain.  I don&#39;t view those things as<br/>
sacrifices, but others might.<br/>
<br/>
Dan is gone before we wake up in the morning, and is home for dinner, an<br/>
hour or so of playtime, baths, brushing teeth, story time, and bed.  He has<br/>
about 3 hours of time with them every day, and he does their bedtime ritual<br/>
solo, most nights.  From my subjective viewpoint, the boys all have a<br/>
wonderful relationship with their father and vice versa.  He does work<br/>
overtime on weekends, but not every weekend, and not most weekends.  Most<br/>
weekends he&#39;s home with us, chopping wood, hiking, building fences, cutting<br/>
trails, wrestling, building Bionicles, playing pirate, ninja, and war, and<br/>
taking us on long drives to see what we can see.<br/>

40+ hours per week.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What kind of jobs do you have, if any? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I work fulltime as a software quality analyst for a software <br/>
developer. DH is at home fulltime with DS (8).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and is it enough if only one does it? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes. gotta define &quot;enough&quot; - enough for us, yes. enough for some <br/>
folks, probably not. we don&#39;t have the biggest greatest house (it <br/>
could really use some work in some areas), it&#39;s out a bit (not <br/>
the &quot;prime real estate&quot; area, it&#39;s a little under an acre of <br/>
property of which 20% is wetlands that are unusable entirely, we <br/>
have two vehicles, both 8 yrs old and paid off completely. we&#39;re <br/>
still paying DH&#39;s college loans (he started college 2 yrs before DS <br/>
was born, 2 yrs after we got married, he was 28 at the time). We&#39;ve <br/>
also got some accumulated debt we&#39;re working on as well. Are we <br/>
keeping current with expenses and bills? Yes. Would we like to have <br/>
a bit more discretionary cash? Sure, we&#39;d love to be able to go to <br/>
BOTH the Northeast Unschooling Conference AND Live & Learn AND have <br/>
a family vacation to Europe. Do we have to have it? No. Is it worth <br/>
sending DS off to school so DH can work fulltime? No way. Perhaps <br/>
once DS is an older teen, DH might choose to take on some part time <br/>
work or something but that&#39;s still years in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and doesn&#39;t he/she  <br/>
&gt; have to work so much in order to have enough for all that he <br/>
&gt;(I&#39;ll  <br/>
&gt; just assume it&#39;s he) hardly gets to see his children? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope - I get to work between 7:30 and 8 am and get home somewhere <br/>
between 5 pm and 6 pm (it&#39;s about a 15 minute commute and when I <br/>
leave depends a bit on when I get in and what is happening at work). <br/>
Basic 40 hr type work week. I see DS every evening and all weekend <br/>
long plus paid holiday and vacation time (I get about 3 weeks paid <br/>
vacation per year that I can pretty much take whenever I choose - <br/>
I&#39;m taking a half day off to go to the Big E, the New England <br/>
version of a state fair). Fortunately, since DS doesn&#39;t have <br/>
homework from school, I can actually spend real time with him in the <br/>
evening instead of basically supervising homework and bathtime and <br/>
bedtime (and the attendant wranglings). We also go out on regularly <br/>
scheduled &quot;dates&quot; - whether we go sip chai at Starbuck&#39;s or browse <br/>
the shelves at Borders or take a walk on a nice hiking trail or <br/>
whatever. Gives us a chance to spend time talking and gives DH a bit <br/>
of a breather from DS (who can talk nonstop for 8 hrs or more). I <br/>
sometimes see DS in the mornings, depends on when he wakes up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How about the  <br/>
&gt; relationship between him and the children?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just fine - it&#39;s a priority so we work on it, just as one would work <br/>
on a relationship with a partner. Thus, we have regular &#39;dates&#39;, we <br/>
have &#39;family traditions&#39;, etc. I call home once or twice a day just <br/>
to see what&#39;s happening and DH and DS can call me at will (I keep my <br/>
cell phone handy but they can also use my office phone). I&#39;ll email <br/>
DH interesting tidbits during the day and NeoMail DS occasionally <br/>
(emailing through NeoPets rather than opening his computer up to <br/>
regular email).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And if some work at home,  <br/>
&gt; how do you manage it, do the children leave you alone doing your  <br/>
&gt; work, do you have a schedule, how long do you work each day?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve worked at home at times and DH worked part time from home for a <br/>
couple years as well. Pretty much kept it to set times and gave DS <br/>
attention as needed - works out better to give him 5 focused minutes <br/>
when he needs it than to put him off over and over so that he gets <br/>
in a habit of pestering to get what he wants/needs. DH would work <br/>
about 2 to 3 hours per day Monday-Friday when he was working. He&#39;d <br/>
do much of it before DS woke up in the morning (on average, DH is up <br/>
around 6 am and DS gets up closer to 8). He&#39;d also work once I was <br/>
home if needed, so DS had my attention while DH worked. DH and DS <br/>
were doing okay with that until DH was asked to be in the office for <br/>
the hours he worked - they tried it, there was even a mini office <br/>
for DS with a couch, desk, computer, TV/VCR but it started getting <br/>
in the way of other stuff so DH resigned. I sometimes bring DS to <br/>
work with me for a while if DH has an appointment (like Dr or <br/>
Dentist). He usually brings his laptop and some movies or games to <br/>
play. DS is now 8, DH&#39;s work arrangement ended when he was around 5 <br/>
or 5 1/2. When I work at home, I can usually talk while I work (just <br/>
as I sometimes do here -at- work) as well as sometimes he just wants <br/>
to be near me playing while I work or watching TV or a movie (my <br/>
computer is in our bedroom which is more like a room and a half). My <br/>
job doesn&#39;t require things like being on the phone a lot or what-<br/>
have-you (little to no &quot;customer&quot; contact required, none at all when <br/>
I&#39;m working from home).<br/>
<br/>
So, no, it is not *necessary* that the parent who works be out of <br/>
touch with the family; it is not *necessary* for one parent to be <br/>
home all the time (many families trade off shifts so that a parent <br/>
is home but one parent works days and one works evenings or 3 on 4 <br/>
off type shifts or something); the amount of income *necessary* is <br/>
not necessarily what society considers &quot;necessary&quot; - sometimes there <br/>
are things that just have to wait until we can afford it (I want to <br/>
take DH and DS to Europe sometime, where we&#39;ve got friends, that&#39;ll <br/>
take about two years or so of planning and saving; and, we&#39;ve got <br/>
some unschooling friends down in the US Virgin Islands that we&#39;d <br/>
love to go visit but that&#39;s another bit of saving up as well).<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a single mom of little ones, 2 and 4, so they just play, watch <br/>
movies and do arts and crafts while I work at home.  I try to keep a <br/>
balance of play time, out of the house time, pool time and my work <br/>
time.  When they were real little I hired a mothers helpers from 9am <br/>
to 1pm to help with housework and play with the children so that I <br/>
could work in the other room.  Now I have alot of housekeeping help <br/>
and there are still times when I&#39;m making important calls that I am <br/>
VERY interrupted.  But I let everyone know that my primary &#39;job&#39; is <br/>
being their mom.  Just 2 days ago I took them around to do 3 <br/>
different property appraisals.  They&#39;ve been with me to lots of real <br/>
estate closings, even nursing in slings!!  I still will ask friends <br/>
or helpers occasionally to come play with them if I have a long and <br/>
important phone call to make.  If they take a nap during the day <br/>
then so do I, then when they go to sleep at night, I get to work, <br/>
usually from about 8 to midnight.  The amount of work I actually get <br/>
done during the day varies and I try to go with their flow.  If they <br/>
are playing well without me - I get over to the computer.  If they <br/>
want alot of attention - I let it go for another time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve worked at home at times and DH worked part time from home for a <br/>
couple years as well. Pretty much kept it to set times and gave DS <br/>
attention as needed - works out better to give him 5 focused minutes <br/>
when he needs it than to put him off over and over so that he gets <br/>
in a habit of pestering to get what he wants/needs. DH would work <br/>
about 2 to 3 hours per day Monday-Friday when he was working. He&#39;d <br/>
do much of it before DS woke up in the morning (on average, DH is up <br/>
around 6 am and DS gets up closer to 8). He&#39;d also work once I was <br/>
home if needed, so DS had my attention while DH worked. DH and DS <br/>
were doing okay with that until DH was asked to be in the office for <br/>
the hours he worked - they tried it, there was even a mini office <br/>
for DS with a couch, desk, computer, TV/VCR but it started getting <br/>
in the way of other stuff so DH resigned. I sometimes bring DS to <br/>
work with me for a while if DH has an appointment (like Dr or <br/>
Dentist). He usually brings his laptop and some movies or games to <br/>
play. DS is now 8, DH&#39;s work arrangement ended when he was around 5 <br/>
or 5 1/2. When I work at home, I can usually talk while I work (just <br/>
as I sometimes do here -at- work) as well as sometimes he just wants <br/>
to be near me playing while I work or watching TV or a movie (my <br/>
computer is in our bedroom which is more like a room and a half). My <br/>
job doesn&#39;t require things like being on the phone a lot or what-<br/>
have-you (little to no &quot;customer&quot; contact required, none at all when <br/>
I&#39;m working from home).<br/>
<br/>
So, no, it is not *necessary* that the parent who works be out of <br/>
touch with the family; it is not *necessary* for one parent to be <br/>
home all the time (many families trade off shifts so that a parent <br/>
is home but one parent works days and one works evenings or 3 on 4 <br/>
off type shifts or something); the amount of income *necessary* is <br/>
not necessarily what society considers &quot;necessary&quot; - sometimes there <br/>
are things that just have to wait until we can afford it (I want to <br/>
take DH and DS to Europe sometime, where we&#39;ve got friends, that&#39;ll <br/>
take about two years or so of planning and saving; and, we&#39;ve got <br/>
some unschooling friends down in the US Virgin Islands that we&#39;d <br/>
love to go visit but that&#39;s another bit of saving up as well).<br/>

I&#39;m really behind, but have a file full of posts I wanted to answer. <br/>
Bear with me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
today I&#39;d like to ask all of you if you go to work? Or do you all<br/>
stay at home?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I groom dogs in a little room in my garage. Ususally 1-3 dogs, 2-3 <br/>
days/week. Sometimes waay more, occasionally none in a week. Having <br/>
been gone for the last two weeks, I have two this afternoon, four <br/>
tomorrow, two on Wed, one on Thurs, and two on Fri. Not a typical weel, <br/>
but the boys will be sleeping a lot this week! &lt;g&gt; I usually schedule <br/>
my clients while the boys are still asleep---from 7-11 am, so I&#39;m <br/>
available when they wake up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently started selling Usborne books, but ONLY to a school where <br/>
I know the head. It&#39;s more work than I thought it would be, but it&#39;s <br/>
only 2 times per year, really---so I can suck that up! &lt;G&gt; The great <br/>
deal on books for Duncan is the cool kicker!<br/>
<br/>
I also coordinate the Live and Learn Conference. Some days, I&#39;m on the <br/>
computer almost ALL day. Others, not at all. But I&#39;m available for the <br/>
boys---and a lot of my organization and ideas happen when I&#39;m out <br/>
driving or gardening or whatever---NOT while I&#39;m sitting at the <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Is unschooling only possible if there is always someone at home?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the age(s) of the child(ren). Little ones? Yes---someone <br/>
must be home. A little older, and they can be at a friend&#39;s house for <br/>
often days at a time (Duncan&#39;s friend Bo will be here this morning and <br/>
will stay until Thursday or Friday, probably!). By the time the child <br/>
gets a driver&#39;s license, things change so much! Cameron had his first <br/>
job at 14---*before* he could drive. I would take him in. As soon as he <br/>
got his license, a lot of his learning happened withOUT me at all! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
What kind of jobs do you have, if any?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just answered me above. Ben is a Lt Col in the Air National Guard. He <br/>
rides his bike 13 miles to work, so if I must be out, the boys can call <br/>
Ben and know he&#39;s only a few minutes away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who brings &quot;the  money&quot; home? and is it enough if only one does it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ben. Most definitely. Ben&#39;s paycheck covers everything we need. My <br/>
grooming $$ covers fun: gardening & bees for me, YuGiOh! cards, <br/>
NBTSCamp (although Cam&#39;s choosing to pay for those things now), <br/>
birthday and Christmas gifts, travel (which we seem to be doing a  lot <br/>
of lately!!!), etc.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Enough&quot; is really relative! &lt;g&gt; It *has* to be enough---whatever it <br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
and doesn&#39;t he/she<br/>
have to work so much in order to have enough for all that he (I&#39;ll<br/>
just assume it&#39;s he) hardly gets to see his children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
WOW! Ben&#39;s home SOOO much more now that he&#39;s back in the military! That <br/>
was one of the &quot;perks&quot; of re-upping with the Guard compared to selling <br/>
food to restaurants or selling pharmaceuticals, both of which he did <br/>
before! He was NEVER home---and even when he *was* home, he was <br/>
working! We see him so much more! Plus---he gets to ride his bike more! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; That makes *him* happy!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 How about the<br/>
relationship between him and the children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good, and always getting better. ANd just after each conference, he <br/>
seems to fit in better---to make a huge leap in how he works and plays <br/>
with the boys. It&#39;s pretty cool to watch.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And if some work at home,<br/>
how do you manage it, do the children leave you alone doing your<br/>
work, do you have a schedule, how long do you work each day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My schedule is soooo flexible. I don&#39;t work unless I want to---and I <br/>
can reschedule clients to suit me. As they have gotten older, they need <br/>
me less and less for certain things. I mean, they can cook for <br/>
themselves and do laundry and answer the phone. &lt;g&gt; Plus, I&#39;m *only* <br/>
just outside.<br/>
<br/>
I know the conference planning can get time-consuming sometimes---like <br/>
making those damned name badges! &lt;g&gt;, but they&#39;ve learned to tell when <br/>
I *need* to work and when I can break away and when I just want to say, <br/>
&quot;screw it!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re both now, at ten and 18, quite self-sufficient. They don&#39;t need <br/>
me 24/7 as they used to. I still make sure to schedule some fun things <br/>
each week (Tomorrow is International Talk Like a Pirate Day, so I&#39;ll go <br/>
today to get eye patches and schtuff). We all watched _V for Vendetta_ <br/>
together last night. We&#39;re going out for breakfast this morning after <br/>
we pick up Bo, but Duncan and Bo will play while I work this afternoon, <br/>
and Cameron will be out and about after we get his car from the shop.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lucky---or have arranged to be lucky! &lt;g&gt;---to have my work at <br/>
home. Clients know where my priorities are and are willing to work<br/>
around me and my boys. The $$ I make grooming dogs goes directly <br/>
towards fun stuff for the boys, so they can see the benefit of having <br/>
me slightly unavailable for a few hours each week. So far it&#39;s worked <br/>
out great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499535171">I work at the children&#39;s museum of Houston.  My position is &quot;Discovery <br/>
Guide&quot;.  I absolutely love my job.  It&#39;s a part time job with a lot of <br/>
flexibility.  You are scheduled for part time hours, but if you so choose, <br/>
you can either add your name to an empty spot on the schedule or sub for <br/>
another person to acquire extra hours up to 40 per week.  If we are <br/>
shortstaffed, they allow more than 40 per week for time and a half pay.  <br/>
When I have a baby, the plan is to work Saturdays and Sundays, and then on <br/>
Thursday evening from 5-9 for free family night.  Those are the hours when <br/>
they most need people, and this way, we wouldn&#39;t need other care.<br/>
I have not ruled out staying at home, but I feel more at ease contributing <br/>
to the family finances.  That way, if something happened to my husband or to <br/>
his job, I could be in a better position all around.  Besides, there are a <br/>
lot of feminists in my family- they already want to kill me because I got <br/>
married, I can&#39;t imagine how bad they will react with my first child, and if <br/>
I stayed home, they&#39;d probably burn my house down.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s very odd.  I&#39;m a feminist.  My mother is a feminist.  I have<br/>
many friends who are feminists (both female *and* male).  None of them<br/>
would burn your house down if you *chose* to stay home with your<br/>
child.  Feminism is not about womyn having to work outside the home<br/>
and &quot;free&quot; themselves from the apron strings of domesticity.  Feminism<br/>
is about having a *choice* and being supported in that *choice.*<br/>
While your friends may not *choose* to have children and stay home, I<br/>
would really question if they are feminists if they didn&#39;t support<br/>
YOUR *choice* to do such.<br/>

I think the most empowering thing that feminism brought about is women&#39;s ability to now choose the lifestyle that they truly want. *And* we get to change our minds and go in different directions when we choose too! <br/>

I started out with a career, moved into motherhood where I chose to stay home and am now a business owner with by husband. All valid choices and all choices I would support for my friends or family.<br/>
