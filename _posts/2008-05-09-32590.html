<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197598500">Ive been reading through some of the messages here and I am very <br/>
confused about unschooling and radical unschoooling. I must say that <br/>
I thought that &quot;unschooling&quot; was a different way in teachng your <br/>
children about life and learning. I thought that it meant teaching in <br/>
your own way, not sitting at a table reading and writing and doing <br/>
work for 8 hours a day. The more I have read it seems as though <br/>
people are putting limits to unschooling as well. As saying...well if <br/>
u are a radical unschooler your children should not have chores, <br/>
bedtimes, routines or discipline...Is this true? Should we let our <br/>
children run our home? I can tell you that if my children could do <br/>
WHATEVER they wanted they would be wild. My 3 yr old would eat until <br/>
he pukes and my 4 yr old would get into so much trouble ect ect. <br/>
Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that <br/>
it hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life? I am very confused here. <br/>
I let my children learn freely. They dont sit at a table or a desk <br/>
for 8 hours staright and do writing, reading, homework whatever...BUT <br/>
I do sit them at a table for maby 1/2 an hour here and there to do an <br/>
activity, paint a picture, play with playdough...or even let them <br/>
climb on my lap and read them a book. My children do have their <br/>
chores, they do have discipline and they do have rules. Im not quite <br/>
sure what this makes me or what &quot;catagory&quot; I fit into to. I dont <br/>
follow a curriculum, although I dont let my children run full range <br/>
of the house either. Please help me learn what exactly unschooling <br/>
and radical unschooling is. I am teaching my children the way I want <br/>
to and the way I believe they should be taught...as they are My <br/>
children. I thought that unschooling is different for each <br/>
family...we all have bounderies, even adults. SO why so much <br/>
commotion  over who is a REAL unschooler and who isnt?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278665538">~~I must say that<br/>
I thought that &quot;unschooling&quot; was a different way in teachng your<br/>
children about life and learning. I thought that it meant teaching in<br/>
your own way, not sitting at a table reading and writing and doing<br/>
work for 8 hours a day. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s going beyond the idea that children need to be &quot;taught&quot; and that<br/>
they will, in a nurturing and respectful environment, learn everything<br/>
they need for life. That doesn&#39;t mean ignoring them, like you<br/>
described when they obviously need help (hitting each other is sign<br/>
that things have devolved way past the point of needing help) but it&#39;s<br/>
also not aimed at trying to control them.<br/>
<br/>
What you wrote about your 4y.o. eating until he/she pukes shows a real<br/>
lack of trust. People will eat what they need, when they need it if<br/>
they aren&#39;t being externally controlled. If your child would eat until<br/>
the point of puking, then that child is VERY out of touch with their<br/>
own body already! I would think it&#39;s a huge wake up call to quit<br/>
controlling their food intake and re-learn some trust. At some point<br/>
that child will control everything about their food intake (much<br/>
sooner than you believe probably) and then what will they do without<br/>
Mom controlling their choices?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the trust that people will learn everything when<br/>
they&#39;re good and ready. Radical unschooling says that same trust<br/>
people apply to academics can be applied to everything in life.<br/>
<br/>
Why would we trust a child to learn how to read, but NOT trust they<br/>
can learn how to eat? Why would we trust they can learn basic math<br/>
concepts by living life, but not trust they can learn basic household<br/>
tasks by living life? Learning is learning. We don&#39;t separate<br/>
different kinds of learning. It&#39;s all part of the  human journey.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean the child doesn&#39;t have a connected and aware adult to<br/>
help them navigate all the things they are learning about. That is of<br/>
ultimate importance in this lifestyle.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree my girls are 5 and 3 and when they want to help out it is up <br/>
to them- sometimes I ask them to help me but a yes or no is <br/>
acceptable- I notice that they like to do different things- for <br/>
instance the 5 yr old LIKES to wash the walls or doors- not <br/>
something I like to but I would not make it her chore- she also <br/>
likes to organize things<br/>
<br/>
my son was 13 and his chores were getting the mail, taking out trash <br/>
and emptying the dishwasher- guess what he HATES to do- BUT he will <br/>
clean up his room when he is ready and is starting to straighten up <br/>
the bathroom which is my hated thing to do- he will take out the <br/>
trash if I ask and there are a lot of bags- I am 6 months pregnant <br/>
so I need a little more help and he is happy to do it. <br/>
<br/>
my husband is also chore free- he does not HAVE to help bring in <br/>
groceries though when given a choice he is happy to help me<br/>
<br/>
I choose to clean the things I do and all of it gets done eventually-<br/>
 <br/>
they do not need chores and will help out on the things they want to-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332534842">Ren,Thank you for making THIS clear, as I believe it hits exactly the<br/>
question that was being asked by the OP:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There are a lot of unschoolers out there that cling to rules and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>chores and discipline. They&#39;re still unschoolers.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I would only add that &quot;clinging&quot; has a negative connotation which seems<br/>
disrespectful to me. I would have phrased that same statement perhaps as<br/>
&quot;There are a lot of unschoolers out there that CHOOSE to have rules and<br/>
chores and discipline. They are still unschoolers.&quot; I believe that is more<br/>
of a descriptive informative statement that doesn&#39;t include either a<br/>
positive or negative judgement, therefore respecting the ability of the<br/>
reader to make up their own mind as to the (negative of positive) value of<br/>
the CHOICE of those parents to have rules and chores and discipline.<br/>
<br/>
To the OP, that difference you notice is the difference between so-called<br/>
&quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; (which really doesn&#39;t have to do with the way kids are<br/>
or aren&#39;t &quot;schooled&quot; and a lot  more with the way they&#39;re &quot;parented&quot;, IMO)<br/>
and just plain old unschooling, which IMO is what that parent is, from her<br/>
own description.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that clarifies things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530647839">Jolene,I would warn you against getting your young children &quot;hooked&quot; on<br/>
stickers/heavy praise/ ANY kind of EXTERNAL incentive to do what they simply<br/>
should be doing for its own sake...Everything else you&#39;re doing is fine<br/>
(being there doing it with them, giving them verbal approval at the<br/>
beginning in order to establish those good habits, BUT THEN gradually and<br/>
consistently letting THEM take responsibility on their own for those<br/>
behaviors) but you want to be careful or your intentions might backfire when<br/>
your kids stop caring for stickers and stop being interested in the act of<br/>
cleaning up after themselves. These should be INTRINSIC acts, in other<br/>
words, they should be their own reward (in that your children will get use<br/>
to having a clean room, finding their toys the next day when they go looking<br/>
for them where they belong, etc). These are not as IMMEDIATE and TANGIBLE<br/>
consequences as a sticker they get right away might be, but they are the<br/>
REAL (vs. &quot;manipulated&quot;) consequence of the actions you&#39;re trying to<br/>
establish as habits, kiwm?<br/>
<br/>
I would also warn you against using the term &quot;chores&quot;since it has that<br/>
negative connotation of drudgery, something that&#39;s a pain to do, etc. Why<br/>
not capitalize on kids&#39; joyful way of doing everything? I feel more adults<br/>
could learn from kids to do those helpful things (such as taking<br/>
responsibility for your own self and one&#39;s  belongings) joyfully rather than<br/>
grudgingly. No stickers necessary! :) And yes, they can be harmful. Just try<br/>
breaking them from it and you&#39;ll see!<br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned the Alfie Kohn book, Punished by rewards.I highly<br/>
recommend it. One thing that makes me CRAZY about public schools (and many<br/>
other schools, though not all) is the general attitude that kids are<br/>
learning &quot;in order to get something else&quot; (be it grades, praise, or other<br/>
rewards) rather than learning for its own sake.<br/>

compromise the relationship, then chores, bedtimes, routines and  <br/>
discipline aren&#39;t needed and can be seen as incredibly disrespectful  <br/>
of another human being.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband put up a big sticker chart for the  <br/>
chores he assigns you to do? How would it make you feel? How would  <br/>
you feel about him?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think in terms of &quot;Yeah, but I need to get them to ...&quot; as  <br/>
though the situation were different. Really think about how you&#39;d  <br/>
feel if he created chores and he watched to see what you did and put  <br/>
stickers on a chart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should we let our<br/>
&gt; children run our home?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We each will make our own decisions. We each get to decide what our  <br/>
goals are. We each decide what philosophy we&#39;ll use to reach our goals.<br/>
<br/>
So, you can if you want. It&#39;s a free country, though I can&#39;t see the  <br/>
advantage. Seems a recipe for disaster to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can tell you that if my children could do<br/>
&gt; WHATEVER they wanted they would be wild. My 3 yr old would eat until<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet kids who are raised with trust and help and without controls  <br/>
aren&#39;t eating until they puke and aren&#39;t getting in trouble. So what  <br/>
happened?<br/>
<br/>
The thing about raising kids with principles and a partnership is  <br/>
that other parents who control their kids think, &quot;Well, yeah, you&#39;ve  <br/>
got good kids so of course you can do it that way. My kids would be  <br/>
wild so I have to control them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nope. Works the other way. Kids who are raised knowing their parents  <br/>
are there to help them get what they want from life *continue* to be  <br/>
trustworthy kids. Kids who are controlled, who know their parents  <br/>
will say no, learn that to get what they want they have to get around  <br/>
their parents somehow. Their parents aren&#39;t their partners. Their  <br/>
parents are their adversaries in a game of getting the kids to do  <br/>
what the parents want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that<br/>
&gt; it hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t thinks so because it&#39;s unlikely that&#39;s the lesson that would  <br/>
be learned. It&#39;s very likely that the older, bigger one would bully  <br/>
the younger, smaller one. The older would learn that to solve  <br/>
problems it rocks to have power. The younger would learn that it  <br/>
sucks to lack power but often the best course is to give in.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s also, often the lesson kids learn when parents hold the power.  <br/>
They learn that the best way to solve problems is to force someone to  <br/>
do it your way. It&#39;s the way parents have come up with after spending  <br/>
30+ years on the planet so power must be the best solution to problems.<br/>
<br/>
We have the opportunity to put real problem solving into practice and  <br/>
help kids figure out better ways to get what they want than forcing  <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like ideas on ways to help them figure out how to solve  <br/>
relationship issues you could ask here. Real scenarios work better  <br/>
than hypotheticals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am very confused here.<br/>
&gt; I let my children learn freely. They dont sit at a table or a desk<br/>
&gt; for 8 hours staright and do writing, reading, homework whatever...BUT<br/>

&gt; activity, paint a picture, play with playdough...or even let them<br/>
&gt; climb on my lap and read them a book.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you want your husband to sit you at a table and do an activity?  <br/>
Would you do that to a friend?<br/>
<br/>
Why do think your kids would feel differently than an older person  <br/>
about being made to do something? Aren&#39;t they humans too?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My children do have their<br/>
&gt; chores, they do have discipline and they do have rules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has invitations to spend time with me and help, she is  <br/>
trusted to want to be a good person though sometimes she needs  <br/>
suggestions on how she can approach a problem in a better way, and we  <br/>
live by principles so we don&#39;t need rules.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im not quite<br/>
&gt; sure what this makes me or what &quot;catagory&quot; I fit into to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you want to fit into a category or develop a philosophy that helps  <br/>
you meet your goals?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dont<br/>
&gt; follow a curriculum, although I dont let my children run full range<br/>
&gt; of the house either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter can run from the attic to the basement if she wants. But  <br/>
she prefers running outside. Especially hills!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please help me learn what exactly unschooling<br/>
&gt; and radical unschooling is.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am teaching my children the way I want<br/>
&gt; to and the way I believe they should be taught...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, so is everyone, from the sweetest earth mothery type to the  <br/>
child molester. That&#39;s the problem with a vague philosophy. It really  <br/>
doesn&#39;t help anyone figure out how to solve problems! It&#39;s sort of a  <br/>
&quot;do the best I can and after that it&#39;s a crap shoot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and mindful parenting philosophies are a lot more helpful  <br/>
for reaching the goal of joyful living, great relationships and  <br/>
thinking kids! And the results a lot more predictable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as they are My<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that helps is to not see them as possessions.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be that men would say that about their wives. Mine. Mine  <br/>
to treat as I think best.<br/>
<br/>
Children are tiny human beings that you have invited into your home.  <br/>
Often they are treated as adults&#39; toys to be played with when it&#39;s  <br/>
convenient and put in their place when it isn&#39;t. (Children often  <br/>
don&#39;t cooperate with that though!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought that unschooling is different for each<br/>
&gt; family...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t an *official* definition of unschooling -- with like  <br/>
stamps and seals of approval and so forth -- so the label gets  <br/>
applied to a lot of different ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The label &quot;organic&quot; used to be a lot like that too until official  <br/>
standards were applied. Not sure we want that ;-) but as it is,  <br/>
people can use unschooling as they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Originally the term was coined by John Holt. By reading his books you  <br/>
can see the evolution of his thought and how he got to where he ended  <br/>
up. But what he labeled was what humans were born to do: learn by  <br/>
living life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we all have bounderies, even adults.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do. But often adults impose more boundaries on kids as practice  <br/>
for real life boundaries. Kids see right through that. If your  <br/>
husband said to you &quot;You can&#39;t go out past 8PM,&quot; would that have the  <br/>
same feel as the STOP sign at the end of the street? Kids know  <br/>
arbitrary parent imposed (or even family discussed) rules aren&#39;t the  <br/>
same as the real limitations of the rest of the world. And it really  <br/>
ticks them off that parents treat them the same!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SO why so much<br/>
&gt; commotion  over who is a REAL unschooler and who isnt?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t. No one is labeling *people*. *Ideas*, though, are  <br/>
labeled as helpful or not helpful in building relationships and in  <br/>
treating children with the respect we would give another human being.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part of extending unschooling philosophy into family life  <br/>
is that parents can&#39;t conceive of what tools to use in place of  <br/>
traditional tools. So they immediately assume no tools at all. &quot;You  <br/>
don&#39;t tell them no??? You don&#39;t have rules??? ....&quot; Just because you  <br/>
can&#39;t see what other tools are possible, doesn&#39;t mean the tools don&#39;t  <br/>
exist!<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most helpful thing you can do for yourself to figure out  <br/>
unschooling is to assume we want the exact same thing for our kids as  <br/>
you do. We want them to go to college if they want. We want them to  <br/>
be kind and generous. We want them to be self-confident. We just have  <br/>
different tools that work a whole lot better than traditional  <br/>
parenting tools. :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This can be accomplished without using carrots (stickers). I just <br/>
ask my 4yo ds to do something like throwing his trash away or <br/>
putting dirty clothes in the hamper. Most of the time he&#39;s happy to <br/>
do it. If he&#39;s not, I do it. No big deal. I don&#39;t need to bribe him <br/>
with stickers or candy or hugs or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to do if you&#39;ve always been doing this, though. It <br/>
may seem like a punishment if they suddenly don&#39;t get stickers <br/>
anymore. I guess you&#39;d have to go through a deschooling time with <br/>
the stickers. Although, if they continue to get the allowance even <br/>
without the chore/sticker chart, it may be a non-issue.<br/>

Well, really, do you have to &quot;teach&quot; this? Tell them what you&#39;d like <br/>
them to do, explain if it seems to help, thank them when they do it <br/>
and pick the clothes up yourself otherwise. And buy lots of <br/>
stickers, since they like stickers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;he gets allowence no matter how many stickers he has but I pretend <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that its becuase he helped me clean all week. <br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound like a particularly good way to build trust, to <br/>
me. Its pretty convoluted - either the kids eventually figure out <br/>
that the allowance has nothing to do with chores (so much for mom as <br/>
trustworthy) or at some point the allowance *becomes* linked to the <br/>
chores in your mind, too, and you have a reward/punishment system <br/>
set up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I dont say...WELL NOW U DONT GET A STICKER...KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to say it. They notice. Sometimes the reward isn&#39;t <br/>
worth the bother. That&#39;s what reward systems ultimately &quot;teach&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need rewards to help out - I have a 14yr old stepson who <br/>
transitioned from a traditional school family to our radical <br/>
unschooling home a year and a half ago. He has no chores. There are <br/>
no &quot;rewards&quot; and any money etc he gets from us is totally unrelated <br/>
to anything he does. But over time he has started helping out around <br/>
the house. Why shouldn&#39;t he? Its his home. <br/>
<br/>
My 6yo has &quot;always&quot; been unschooled. She has no chores and we don&#39;t <br/>
do any kinds of rewards at all. Sometimes she picks up, or washes <br/>
some dishes, or folds and puts away laundry, or feeds the pets. <br/>
Sometimes we ask her, other times she sees something needs to be <br/>
done and decides to do it. Its not the picture-perfect child putting <br/>
away toys every night, for sure, but its totally voluntary on her <br/>
part, and that&#39;s marvelous to me. <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to address this from the earlier post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;my 4 yr old would get into so much trouble ect ect.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that<br/>
it hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life? <br/>
***************************************<br/>
<br/>
My stepson lived with rules and discipline. And yet, he was one of <br/>
those kids who was always in trouble. Eventually, the school was in <br/>
the process of expelling him and he pulled a knife on his mom&#39;s <br/>
boyfriend and she sent him to live with us. Now he lives with no <br/>
rules - just those principles that Joyce and others have mentioned. <br/>
They aren&#39;t &quot;applied&quot; to him in the ways rules are applied, its a <br/>
different way of thinking, really. <br/>
<br/>
My partner and I value mutual support, for example, so we support <br/>
each other and our kids as best we can - and over time Ray has <br/>
started to be supportive of us and Mo, too. We value kindness and <br/>
respectfulness, so we are kind to the kids and each other, we <br/>
respect each others ideas and wants and wishes and try to honor <br/>
them - the kids&#39; too. And so a 14yo &quot;troublemaker&quot; is now kind and <br/>
gracious and respectful of others&#39; ideas and wants and wishes. Why <br/>
would this be? Bc he lives in the middle of these values (or <br/>
principles) and knows how it feels to be treated this way. It feels <br/>
good. It meets some of his own, human needs for connection and <br/>
feeling loved and valued. And that lets him turn around and offer <br/>
the same goodness to others. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how &quot;principles&quot; work. Its a different mindset from rules. <br/>
Its not that I&#39;m kind as a way to &quot;get&quot; my kids to be kind - but I <br/>
know that when people are kind to me I&#39;m motivated to be kind to <br/>
others and I trust that other people, the people in my family in <br/>
particular, will respond the same way. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so tying that back in with the &quot;chores&quot; thing - in an <br/>
environment of mutual supportiveness, people want to help one <br/>
another and look for ways to do that. Even kid-people! They don&#39;t <br/>
always have the energy to be helpful and supportive, though. Little <br/>
kids, especially, use a whole lot of their daily energy just meeting <br/>
their internal needs - there are just sooooooo many things they need <br/>
help with. If they don&#39;t get enough help (and &quot;enough&quot; varies with <br/>
the kid, the day, hunger, tireness....) they aren&#39;t able to turn <br/>
around and be helpful very well. <br/>
<br/>
The difference between radical unschooling and more traditional <br/>
parenting is that when kids aren&#39;t feeling up to being helpful, its <br/>
an invitation to unschooling parents to practice some more of those <br/>
lovely principles, like kindness and grace and compassion. In <br/>
traditional parenting, its time for a lesson. It might be a gentle, <br/>
subtle lesson, like no offer of a sticker, but its still not a kind, <br/>
compassionate response to a small person who just isn&#39;t up for <br/>
putting his socks in the hamper today. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say you&#39;re some kind of big meanie! It sounds like <br/>
you are trying to keep the &quot;lesson&quot; as kind as possible. What I&#39;m <br/>
saying is that you don&#39;t need lessons at all. Its a different way of <br/>
looking at the whole picture.<br/>

I have been moving toward it, but it has taken me a while to <br/>
recognize some things that are MY limits and issues, and more time to <br/>
trust enough to let go of them.<br/>
<br/>
To be above &quot;clinginess&quot; is like a pridefull thing, like saying &quot;well <br/>
I&#39;m there and your just not yet,so I am above you somehow&quot;. Does <br/>
unschooling have levels like Karate? Is an unschooling master <br/>
completely free of cling? It&#39;s not a bad kind of pride to know that <br/>
you are good at something and take pleasure in that, but it is a bad <br/>
kind of pride if you use that talent to place yourself above others <br/>
instead of using you skill to help others get where you are.<br/>
<br/>
For seeing clingy in a negative...I know I see my little children <br/>
as &quot;clingy&quot;, and have never felt that the need or the word was <br/>
negative, just descriptive of the need to be closely held, like how <br/>
saran wrap is clingy. It&#39;s not negative, it just means &quot;holding on <br/>
to&quot;. Well,just my 2 cents anyway.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Ive been reading through some of the messages here and I am very<br/>
confused about unschooling and radical unschoooling. I must say that<br/>
I thought that &quot;unschooling&quot; was a different way in teachng your<br/>
children about life and learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It is. Kind of. It&#39;s a different way to *LOOK* at life and learning. <br/>
We&#39;ll leave &quot;teaching&quot; for the schools. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought that it meant teaching in<br/>
your own way, not sitting at a table reading and writing and doing<br/>
work for 8 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, how about &quot;Learning&quot; in your own way? Or &quot;allowing your child to <br/>
learn in his own way&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The more I have read it seems as though<br/>
people are putting limits to unschooling as well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of them as &quot;limits&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
In your first statement you wrote: &quot;a different way in teaching your <br/>
children about life and learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more about not *separating* life and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Living is learning is unschooling is living is learning is unschooling <br/>
is....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As saying...well if<br/>
u are a radical unschooler your children should not have chores,<br/>
bedtimes, routines or discipline...Is this true?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that, if I believe if *all* learning is valuable and if I <br/>
believe that children learn what&#39;s important to them when they&#39;re ready <br/>
and if I believe that children need to listen to their bodies and if I <br/>
believe that children want to be the best person they can be, why would <br/>
they need chores, bedtimes, or other arbitrary rules imposed by me?<br/>
<br/>
Routines are natural for some people---they impose them on themselves. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t impose a routine on someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Discipline---hmmmm..what do you mean by discipline?<br/>
<br/>
To learn? The Latin, &#39;&quot;discere&quot; means to learn. But it has a lot of <br/>
meanings in our society. If you mean &quot;training them to behave&quot;---then <br/>
no, I don&#39;t think children should be &quot;disciplined.&quot; If you mean <br/>
spanked, then definitely not. What do you mean by &quot;discipline&quot;?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Should we let our children run our home?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I *really* liked Joyce&#39;s answer. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think my children run my home?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I&#39;m suggesting that you do that?<br/>
<br/>
Ours is a pretty peaceful, joyful household. Really.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that if my children could do<br/>
WHATEVER they wanted they would be wild.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I sent this to Sandra&#39;s &quot;If I Let&quot; page.  <br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling/ifilet<br/>
<br/>
Why would you have such negative thoughts about your children?<br/>
<br/>
*I* do whatever *I* want. So does my husband. So do my boys, 12 & 20 <br/>
years old. We work *together* so that all of *can* do whatever we want. <br/>
That&#39;s the GOAL!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 3 yr old would eat until<br/>
he pukes and my 4 yr old would get into so much trouble ect ect.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope 1) that you don&#39;t really think that, and 2) that you could start <br/>
seeing them for the amazing children they are.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-===-=-<br/>
<br/>
Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that<br/>
it hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would you allow anyone to hurt one of your children???<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think they would choose to beat each other up?<br/>
<br/>
I think they know what hurts them and what doesn&#39;t, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am very confused here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So I see.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I let my children learn freely.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Only certain things?<br/>
<br/>
Only academics?<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe that they are incapable of learning to eat, sleep, <br/>
clean, help without your direct control?<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Why aren&#39;t those things *just* as natural to learn as algebra and <br/>
Shakespeare?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They dont sit at a table or a desk<br/>
for 8 hours staright and do writing, reading, homework whatever...BUT<br/>
I do sit them at a table for maby 1/2 an hour here and there to do an<br/>
activity, paint a picture, play with playdough...or even let them<br/>
climb on my lap and read them a book.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You &quot;sit them&quot;---you mean you *make them*?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t think they&#39;d choose to do that just for fun?<br/>

<br/>
they do have discipline and they do have rules.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My children have trust and respect and principles.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Im not quite sure what this makes me or what &quot;catagory&quot; I fit into to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking to fit into a category?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I dont follow a curriculum, although I dont let my children run full <br/>
range<br/>
of the house either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a three year old and a four year old NEED a curriculum? <br/>
Aren&#39;t they a little young?---even for die-hard schoolers?<br/>
<br/>
I think three and four year olds should just be playing.  But *I* think <br/>
12 year olds and 20 year olds should just be playing too. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve kept mine out of the house if I&#39;d tried <br/>
(which I didn&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please help me learn what exactly unschooling<br/>
and radical unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling was coined by John Holt, who wrote about freeing children <br/>
to play and learn in their own time in their own ways.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is about learning *everything* naturally---by trial <br/>
and error, by modeling, by DOing, by asking for help, by observing. <br/>
It&#39;s about understanding that children are learning machines and don&#39;t <br/>
need arbitrary rules imposed by adults to make their way through the <br/>
world. They need guidance and assistance. They need partners, not <br/>
dictators.<br/>
<br/>
The owners and moderators of this list---and many contributing members) <br/>
are radical unschooling parents. We really do believe that children are <br/>
extremely capable beings who *want* to be the best people they can be. <br/>
They *want* to learn---that they&#39;re hard-wired to learn and to be a <br/>
part of society.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am teaching my children the way I want<br/>
to and the way I believe they should be taught...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As are all of us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
as they are My children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who was it that suggested not treating them as possessions? Joyce again?<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s really important. They are *in your care*. But you don&#39;t <br/>
own them. The decisions *you* make *for* them today can backfire if you <br/>
don&#39;t put a lot of thought into why and how.<br/>
<br/>
*This* list is a place to question a lot of parenting and educational <br/>
practices that most people take for granted. A lot---*most* of <br/>
us---have questioned how we were reared and how we were educated and <br/>
believe we have found a better and more respectful way of living with <br/>
our children.<br/>
<br/>
You certainly don&#39;t have to subscribe to radical unschooling to read <br/>
here! But this list is meant to help parents make those changes that <br/>
will allow a more trusting, respectful relationship with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought that unschooling is different for each family...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It is. But the underlying principles look the same: Children will <br/>
learn. Trust them. Respect them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
we all have bounderies, even adults.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Adults should have a bit more control over their own selves and their <br/>
boundaries, don&#39;t you think? We&#39;ve had a lot more years on this planet <br/>
to figure things out. Kids need more leeway to work out issues. They&#39;re <br/>
*new* here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
SO why so much<br/>
commotion  over who is a REAL unschooler and who isnt?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I first read that, I thought---&quot;what is she talking about? Are we <br/>
having that conversation aGAIN?&quot; Then I realized that Jodi posted about <br/>
the &quot;unschoolers&quot; in her city.<br/>
<br/>
If/When you make these radical changes of trusting and respecting <br/>
children, it makes it hard to be around those who don&#39;t. Really, really <br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
I choose to make huge efforts to BE with other radical unschoolers. I <br/>
know they will be nice to my kids and treat them as humans as opposed <br/>
to a couple of grubs, waiting to become human. I know they won&#39;t talk <br/>
down to my boys. I know they will understand when there&#39;s a meltdown <br/>
(because they understand that the child NEEDS something, not that he&#39;s <br/>
just spoiled or manipulative). I kow they will be fun and seek JOY in <br/>
every action and not worry what others think of them (in a good way).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re simply more FUN to be with!<br/>

<br/>
.Example...putting dirty clothes in the hamper...when it is<br/>
bathtime...instead of throwing their clothes on the floor they place <br/>
them in the<br/>
hamper and are excited to get a sticker!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you get stickers for putting laundry in the hamper?<br/>
<br/>
Why not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I feel that this will teach them dirty clothes go in the hamoer not on <br/>
the floor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;ll teach them to do *anything* to get stickers. Maybe it&#39;ll <br/>
teach them eventually that no number of stickers are worth putting <br/>
clothes into hampers.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked my boys to please put clothes in the hamper. And they <br/>
watch me and Ben put clothes in the hampers.<br/>
<br/>
At 20, Cam puts *all* his clothes in the hamper. At 12, Duncan put <br/>
*most* of his in. &lt;g&gt; But that&#39;s OK---he&#39;s still learning. I pick up <br/>
after him, and he remembers sometimes that he forgot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANother example....putting toys<br/>
away....at the end of the night, they pick up their toys and out them <br/>
away and<br/>
recieve a sticker.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished By Rewards? It should be at the top <br/>
of your library queue.<br/>
<br/>
If the boys like stickers, buy a BUNCH and let them have at it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I always tag along and help them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mine often tag along and help me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Trenton does help with laundry and on garbage day he likes to get the <br/>
smaller garbages from the<br/>
batheroom and bedrooms...so I added them to his chore chart...at the <br/>
end of the<br/>
week...he gets allowence no matter how many stickers he has but I <br/>
pretend that<br/>
its becuase he helped me clean all week.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t &quot;pretending&quot; kind of like *lying*?<br/>
<br/>
Cameron is a recycling NUT. He&#39;s taken over the garbage detail because <br/>
Ben and I tend to throw out more recyclables than he&#39;s comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The boys like this and I dont force<br/>
them to do any chores...I ask them or remind them something needs<br/>
 to be done and if they do it they get a sticker if they dont..<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If your husband asked you to do a few chores (but *asked* rather than <br/>
*forced*) but only gave you a kiss when you DID do the things and no <br/>
kiss if you didn&#39;t....how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I just let it be...I dont say...WELL NOW U DONT GET A STICKER...KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t you think they are getting a few messages you&#39;re not meaning <br/>

Ren,Thank you for making THIS clear, as I believe it hits exactly the<br/>
question that was being asked by the OP:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There are a lot of unschoolers out there that cling to rules and<br/>

<br/>
Ren realizes that there are many people who call themselves <br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; and who simply don&#39;t buy curricula---they still require a <br/>
lot of schoolwork from their kids, but they don&#39;t *BUY* curricula. She <br/>
also realizes that there are people who call themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; <br/>
and who &quot;unschool&quot; everything but math and reading. She realizes that <br/>
there are *plenty* of people who call themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; and who <br/>
require chores, limits foods, enforce bedtimes, and have lots of rules.<br/>
<br/>
Ren and I will be speaking at the New England Conference later this <br/>
month about how *we* don&#39;t think that works so well. &quot;It Ain&#39;t Just <br/>
About Academics&quot; will cover topics like chores, food, bedtimes, and <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would only add that &quot;clinging&quot; has a negative connotation which seems<br/>
disrespectful to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Uhmmmm...I *think* Ren *meant* to use a negative connotation. Because <br/>
&quot;clinging&quot; to those things is disrespectful of the CHILD and what he&#39;s <br/>
capable of. The longer that parents cling to rules and chores and <br/>
discipline, the longer it takes to make unschooling work well (or most <br/>
often, the more impossible it becomes!).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would have phrased that same statement perhaps as<br/>
&quot;There are a lot of unschoolers out there that CHOOSE to have rules and<br/>
chores and discipline. They are still unschoolers.&quot; I believe that is <br/>
more<br/>
of a descriptive informative statement that doesn&#39;t include either a<br/>
positive or negative judgement, therefore respecting the ability of the<br/>
reader to make up their own mind as to the (negative of positive) value <br/>
of<br/>
the CHOICE of those parents to have rules and chores and discipline.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---except that a goal of *this* list is to help people move aWAY <br/>
form such arbitrary control.<br/>
<br/>
To the *owners* of this list, it *should* have a negative connotation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
To the OP, that difference you notice is the difference between <br/>
so-called<br/>
&quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; (which really doesn&#39;t have to do with the way <br/>
kids are<br/>
or aren&#39;t &quot;schooled&quot; and a lot  more with the way they&#39;re &quot;parented&quot;, <br/>
IMO)<br/>
and just plain old unschooling, which IMO is what that parent is, from <br/>
her<br/>
own description.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe. To you.<br/>
<br/>
But how does a child who is controlled with food, bedtimes, chores, <br/>
discipline, rules---how does that child *learn* what&#39;s right for him? <br/>
When mom&#39;s imposing all these &quot;flexible rules&quot;? How does that work? How <br/>
can you trust your child to learn grammar but not trust him to learn to <br/>
pick up his clothes? How can you trust your child to learn to multiply <br/>
but not trust him to sleep when he&#39;s tired and wake when he&#39;s rested?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think kids don&#39;t start questioning that themselves? Then what?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see how they can be separated. Learning is learning. I don&#39;t <br/>
divide our world into &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;non-academic.&quot; It&#39;s ALL learning <br/>
and ALL important. And I trust that my boys will learn because they <br/>
*want* to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936991350">Oh, I so much would love for my husband to listen to that one talk. Is singing yours (and Ren&#39;s) praises beforehand and talking loads about what you have done for my parenting and happiness any form of secret coercion? <br/>
I do try to talk about that real unschooling is a way of life and that I would like him to share it, but he still has some real trouble understanding what I mean by that. He still feels the need to when we are out in the yard together for example shout out things like: &quot;watch out with that sick&quot;, careful, you are going to fall&quot; &quot; you better come down from there...&quot;&quot; I told you not to do this ... and if you don&#39;t listen, you can go in the house&quot; etc. etc. Those things are so ingrained in him that he does not understand my cringing and feels like he is always being criticized. Often I am close to tears and feel like he is hindering their &#39;being&#39;, our happy and trusting peaceful LIFE. I really do want him to be part of it, but how?<br/>
We have made some &quot;unschooling&quot; friends who are lovely people but they are not radical in any sense. They still tell their kids what to do or have some limit or another set up (sometimes just math, sometimes food, sometimes telling them how to behave...). I don&#39;t mind, I still love them, but I feel the need to be RADICAL.<br/>
Sorry I am getting totally off topic... so much for 3 am writing. <br/>

I would also warn you against using the term &quot;chores&quot;since it has that<br/>
negative connotation of drudgery, something that&#39;s a pain to do, etc. <br/>
Why<br/>
not capitalize on kids&#39; joyful way of doing everything? I feel more <br/>
adults<br/>
could learn from kids to do those helpful things (such as taking<br/>
responsibility for your own self and one&#39;s  belongings) joyfully rather <br/>
than<br/>
grudgingly. No stickers necessary! :) And yes, they can be harmful. <br/>
Just try<br/>
breaking them from it and you&#39;ll see!<br/>

don&#39;t do academics, per se. We do learn all aspects of life as we go <br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
I find this discussion of unschooling academics but not other <br/>
aspects of life interesting. I would think it would be harder for <br/>
most people to trust that their children would learn grammar and <br/>
math vs. learning when to eat or go to bed or put dirty clothes in a <br/>
hamper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508237353">~~Uhmmmm...I *think* Ren *meant* to use a negative connotation. Because<br/>
&quot;clinging&quot; to those things is disrespectful of the CHILD and what he&#39;s<br/>
capable of. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a thread going on somewhere else (can&#39;t remember which list)<br/>
about &quot;what do you do if you know your child is capable of something<br/>
but reluctant to try?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about parents who are capable and won&#39;t try??:)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, everyone figures out what they&#39;re willing to GET<br/>
comfortable with in their own homes. Some people still see children as<br/>
beings that need to be controlled. Or they decide to let go of control<br/>
but have nothing to replace it with and things DO devolve into chaos.<br/>
Then they have &quot;proof&quot; that RU doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;clinging&quot; because rules and chores and control are comfort<br/>
zones for most people. It&#39;s what we knew, it&#39;s what we use if we don&#39;t<br/>
learn a better way of relating to humans. Yes, better. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with utilizing the judgement I&#39;ve been wired<br/>
with.:) It&#39;s a useful tool for humans. People who claim they are<br/>
non-judgemental crack me up. We ALL need to use judgement to stay<br/>
safe, to make friends, to make choices every day. <br/>
<br/>
Judgement isn&#39;t an excuse to be rude to people we don&#39;t agree with. It<br/>
is ideally a way to make better choices though. I judge punishment and<br/>
forced chores and other such things as a &quot;lesser&quot; way of relating to<br/>
children. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have friends that do these things,<br/>
nor do I tell them what I think most of the time. <br/>
<br/>
This list exists to examine those very things. Yes, I believe you are<br/>
&quot;clinging&quot; to a comfortable way of being if you can&#39;t release<br/>
punishments and manipulation of your children. I also believe nobody<br/>
can assist anyone in releasing those things unless they want to.<br/>
<br/>
The list is here to help people do just that, IF they wish. If not,<br/>
people can utilize the parts they like and ignore the rest. Just like<br/>
everything else in life...they can use THEIR judgement to choose.:)<br/>
<br/>
I think the word &quot;respect&quot; is flung about too casually. I DON&#39;T<br/>
respect certain practices. I DO respect people&#39;s right to make their<br/>
own choices though. There&#39;s a big difference.<br/>

Is your husband open to letting this stuff go? I asked my husband to <br/>

hurt!&quot; I asked him to say, &quot;Please be careful. That looks <br/>
dangerous,&quot; or &quot;You could get hurt,&quot; so that he wasn&#39;t phrasing it <br/>
as a certainty. Eventually, he moved to, &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll get <br/>
hurt.&quot; I still ask my ds to be careful and tell him when something <br/>
makes me nervous or I&#39;m worried that he could get hurt. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing I do with my husband is ask him to tell me what would <br/>
be the worst thing that could happen. Most of the time, it&#39;s not <br/>
really that bad. Then he&#39;s more likely to let go of trying to stop <br/>
the kids from doing something.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s just what you&#39;re comfortable with. I know parents on both <br/>
extremes---some who can&#39;t fathom how children would learn academics, <br/>
but are fine with all the &quot;life learning&quot; and some who are fine with <br/>
teeth and food and sleep and chores but can&#39;t for the life of them see <br/>
how math and reading can be learned outside a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just strange to me.<br/>
<br/>
I mean: I can get those parents who think that *everything* MUST BE <br/>
TAUGHT. Just a huge lack of understanding of how learning happens---and <br/>
they maybe need/want the control that they didn&#39;t have as children. Or <br/>
they&#39;re just horribly lacking in trust in how humans *are* and what <br/>
learning machines we truly *are*.<br/>
<br/>
But when you pick only parts to trust and can&#39;t see how ALL learning is <br/>
natural, when you can&#39;t trust children with ALL of it---like some <br/>
things are just impossible without outside, parental control---that <br/>
baffles me.<br/>
<br/>
If you trust your child can learn algebra naturally without coercion, <br/>
why do you struggle with his learning to care for his teeth?<br/>
<br/>
If you trust that he will learn to eat when he&#39;s hungry and sleep when <br/>
he&#39;s rested, why do you struggle with reading?<br/>
<br/>
Humans learn. Everything. When they are ready and interested. Even HARD <br/>
stuff! REALLY hard stuff! Because they want to.<br/>

<br/>
Sierra is learning guitar right now. She asked her Dad to help her<br/>
learn how to play something, so they started with &quot;Mary Had a Little<br/>
Lamb&quot;. Of course.:)<br/>
<br/>
Her next song? Ironman. Yes, the heavy metal song. She learned part of<br/>
it and then part of a Deep Purple song. <br/>
<br/>
She and I went to Michael&#39;s last night, to spend a Birthday gift card<br/>
....she tells me that she&#39;s tired of playing the same two songs and<br/>
wants to learn something new. Then, a few minutes later she says &quot;you<br/>
know, I should just learn the rest of those songs first&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She picked up yarn to knit some projects on her looms. She got wads of<br/>
paper to make ATC&#39;s at the NE Unschooling conference. She started<br/>
blogging again this last week and made a new food blog.:) Girl after<br/>
my own heart. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
She cleaned the entire basement area while I was at work the other<br/>
night. It was a complete DISASTER! She organized and vacuumed and<br/>
cleaned like a crazy person. Nobody asked her. I was actually feeling<br/>
guilty because it was SUCH a huge job and I wished I&#39;d been there to help.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see...she plants the garden with me, she collects wild edibles<br/>
for cooking with, she cares for her cats and rabbit, she sings and is<br/>
obsessed with music....I could go on.<br/>
<br/>
She learns all sorts of things that seem hard or difficult. Guitar is<br/>
not an easy instrument in my opinion! She&#39;s asking for a piano too.<br/>
<br/>
People LOVE to learn. Hard things, crazy things, interesting things.<br/>
Things we might never recognize as &quot;valid&quot; because of our past<br/>
programming. But I watch these natural learners eating up the world,<br/>
the universe and I stand in awe.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need subjects, or school lessons..in fact, those things<br/>
NARROW their world. We need freedom to explore that which fascinates<br/>
us. Whether for a moment or for a lifetime. Life is a rich and varied<br/>
journey. If you trust a child, TRULY trust a child then the things<br/>
that seemed trivial are suddenly sacred. <br/>
<br/>
Those scribbles of a toddler may be profound art one day. That crazy<br/>
outfit your child is wearing may look like a fashion designer someday.<br/>
If not? They ENJOYED the journey along the way. What more could one<br/>
ask of life?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995934193">Point taken (and cleverly made, if I might add). And yet, just like the<br/>
other poster below whose toddler is quoted as saying &quot;I want chores!&quot; I<br/>
really do think that the negative connotation of &quot;rules&quot; is in the eye of<br/>
the beholder. In fact I&#39;m very glad you made the parallel, since I can<br/>
actually see both sides of the issue in both cases (that of *rules* and that<br/>
of *chores*) only I&#39;ve been looking at each mostly from opposite sides - but<br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean either HAS to be negative - only if we ourselves assign that<br/>
value to them. Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219301624">For that matter, do clothes HAVE TO go in a hamper? It&#39;s a convenience<br/>
and yes, *I* prefer to have stuff in a basket and not on the floor BUT<br/>
even as an adult, there have been times/places when my used clothing has<br/>
been in a pile in a corner of the floor until laundry doing time because<br/>
I didn&#39;t OWN a hamper/basket and/or I didn&#39;t have space for a<br/>
hamper/basket. There was a place for it, just no container for it.<br/>
Generally, laundry ends up in or near the basket, and when I put my own<br/>
laundry in there at the end of the day, I pick up whatever stuff is<br/>
nearby that didn&#39;t get into it, it&#39;s usually in the general area but<br/>
sometimes the casual toss doesn&#39;t quite get there. We don&#39;t have rewards<br/>
for DS (now almost 10) to put his laundry in the basket, never have.<br/>
But, I might remind him to please toss his clothes in the basket (same<br/>
as I&#39;d possibly remind DH that his sweaty green tinged post-lawn mowing<br/>
socks need to get in the basket and not left on the middle of the<br/>
bedroom floor). Generally, reminders are met with Okay because I don&#39;t<br/>
pester but rather model both doing it myself AND grabbing their stuff<br/>
and putting it in the basket since I&#39;m heading that way anyhow most<br/>
likely. Modeling and serving seems to have created (in our house anyhow)<br/>
a more peaceful, less stressed, atmosphere AND stuff gets done without<br/>
Mom/Dad always doing it. (FWIW DH is the at home parent so he does most<br/>
of the laundry, most of the cooking, most of the house stuff etc as well<br/>
as the mowing and other yard work AND just being with DS all day,<br/>
exploring, interacting, etc I mostly handle grocery shopping and bill<br/>
paying as well as WHO fulltime).<br/>

I think this side of things might tie into fears - of pain, illness, etc<br/>
- and wanting to protect our kids from that. If someone doesn&#39;t know<br/>
algebra, they can still get along, survive, not be hurt (generally<br/>
speaking). If someone doesn&#39;t care for their teeth in such-and-such way<br/>
(the thinking goes) there will be cavities, pain, expensive dental<br/>
procedures, heart disease, etc. If someone doesn&#39;t read at age 6 or 8,<br/>
there might be times they miss something here or there but it&#39;s not<br/>
likely to be fatal (since serious hazards are usually marked with<br/>
symbols like red X or skull and cross bones or whatever as well as<br/>
words) but if they don&#39;t bathe and/or wash their hands thus often, there<br/>
are all those germs out there just waiting to swoop in and cause<br/>
illnesses. Operating out of fear is often a major road to controlling<br/>
whatever - I MUST control x in order to prevent y scary thing - because<br/>
when there are so many things that seem scary and possible, we (people<br/>
in general) tend to want to control as much as we can in order to keep<br/>
scary stuff at bay. <br/>
