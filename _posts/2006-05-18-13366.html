Why were you watching that with your daughter around? My kids are a lot <br/>
older, but because they&#39;re healing from the trauma of abuse, if my <br/>
husband or I want to watch a movie with violence (like we watched Four <br/>
Brothers last night), we wait until they&#39;re in bed. <br/>
We also don&#39;t watch movies with natural disasters (tornados/hurricanes) <br/>
when Shawna is up. She&#39;s terrified of stuff like that and will be <br/>
convinced that it&#39;s going to happen here.  <br/>

<br/>
If she&#39;s never seen someone get smacked around before she probably didn&#39;t<br/>
understand what was happening.  The noise might have registered as<br/>
alarming, like any loud and at first unidentifiable noise does.   <br/>
<br/>
I think you think you know how to explain it.  &lt;g&gt;  I think you&#39;ll think<br/>
what you want.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to correlate the one thing with the other. <br/>
How do you know she&#39;s having nightmares and not gas pains?  <br/>
Dylan talked really early  and really well but wouldn&#39;t have known what a<br/>
nightmare was or what that word was to tell me.   Is it possible she&#39;s<br/>
waking for other reasons and because of your concern about the images she<br/>
saw you&#39;re projecting &quot;nightmare&quot; in there?<br/>
<br/>
If I thought a movie had disturbing scenes and loud, startling noises I<br/>
didn&#39;t watch with Dylan around.   If Dylan wanted to be with me when I<br/>
was watching such a movie I&#39;d turn it off and do something fun with him. <br/>
 When Dylan expressed an interest in watching something with me - and<br/>
that&#39;s different than wanting to be with me to play or hang out - then<br/>
I&#39;d tell him it might be scary or might be noisy and we&#39;d watch together<br/>
and fast forward through the prickly patches... then as time went on<br/>
rewind and watch them again. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Not limiting TV doesn&#39;t mean having a kid watch whatever is on.   It<br/>
means not stopping a child from seeing what he chooses to watch.  It<br/>
means helping him watch what he wants and being right there with him to<br/>
explain what&#39;s happening or to talk about why certain characters have<br/>
acted in a certain way.   It means using discretion about what we watch<br/>
when our kids are around if we suspect certain things might be<br/>
disturbing.    Not limiting what they *want* to watch doesn&#39;t mean making<br/>
them watch everything.  <br/>

Right at the time you could have given her a simple explanation of  <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s just people pretending to hit.&quot; She might not understand the  <br/>
words, but the tone and attitude that it&#39;s nothing to be concerned  <br/>
about will come across.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s having nightmares, it could be because you&#39;re concerned and  <br/>
she&#39;s picking up your negative emotions that there&#39;s something to  <br/>
worry about. Let your worry go and be happy around her :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318561427">Hi I&#39;ve been telling ds who is almost 3 now about tv being pretend for<br/>
a while.  For instance &#39;Oh Brother Where Art Thou&#39; is a hilarious<br/>
spoof with so much wonderful folk music that ds enjoys.  He gets that<br/>
there&#39;s a lot of humor, but since there&#39;s a lot of violence he<br/>
sometimes gets quite concerned too.  I fast forward through the scene<br/>
with the bible salesman when he&#39;s frog squishing, tree limb bashing<br/>
and the whipping scene.  They make *me* cringe.  But I tell ds that&#39;s<br/>
a pretend cow that got run over.  Those aren&#39;t real bullets... that&#39;s<br/>
just for the movie.  &quot;Oh no... not the livestock.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I started doing more of this when we watched the Cat in the Hat movie<br/>
starring Mike Myers (a movie I personally didn&#39;t like).  That is,<br/>
after I read one of the unschooling lists advising to tell kids movies<br/>
aren&#39;t real, especially at disturbing points.  WellYeh... duh on me. <br/>
Too straightforward for me to think of.  I tend to make these things<br/>
harder than they have to be.  It&#39;s not like I have a great mentor I<br/>
can go to --other than the RU lists-- for parenting advice, so thanks<br/>
for spelling this stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
And during that same general time I found myself telling ds the things<br/>
he had up til then absolutely loved, enjoyed and gotten so much fun<br/>
out of --monsters-- aren&#39;t real.  He became frightened of them<br/>
overnight it seems like, and suddenly they had taken on different<br/>
dimensions to him.  He was saying there were monsters in the potty. <br/>
??  I&#39;m not sure how that fear came about and I&#39;ll probably never<br/>
know.  I told him the only monsters we had in the house were on the<br/>
tv, and even those weren&#39;t real.  He hasn&#39;t brought it up since, and<br/>
gone back to playing monster with gusto.  No worries.<br/>
<br/>
Just think... here I was a couple years ago, concerned about the bad<br/>
influence of tv.  Huh... tv has been a FANTASTIC easy way to build<br/>
trust with ds.  It even helps with real life --not just what&#39;s on the<br/>
screen.  Wow.  Too cool... too cool.<br/>
<br/>
A very simple thing.  I was glad for the support of unschooling lists<br/>
which always have an odd habit of bringing up subjects right when I<br/>
need them.  I rarely if ever post a question.  Somebody always beats<br/>
me to it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait... how have you guys dealt with fear of the dark?  That&#39;s<br/>
something I haven&#39;t been able to beat for ds.  I never have been<br/>
afraid of the dark myself.  Go figure.  I don&#39;t know why.<br/>
<br/>

least online anyway<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360879003">I have been afraid of the dark in the past, I know exactly why (a<br/>
particular episode of a particular TV show no one&#39;s even heard of),<br/>
and I&#39;m mostly over it now (I can&#39;t sleep with any light any more).<br/>
However as a result of my fear, what I ended up with was an inability<br/>
to sleep without something weighty over me.  I can be sweltering hot<br/>
in the summer but still need a blanket on my core to feel &quot;safe&quot;.  And<br/>
yes, it truly does come down to a belief that I know is irrational<br/>
that that piece of fabric will protect me from the bogeyman which I<br/>
rationally know doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
So covering all the things that worked for me over the course of this<br/>
fear of the dark, we have: leaving a light on in the room, playing<br/>
soothing music/sounds, focusing the mind on something just before<br/>
sleep (reading myself to sleep with a COMPLETELY non-scary story),<br/>
leaving the door to the hallway open with the hallway light on,<br/>
allowing/encouraging him to sleep/stay in our bed (something only<br/>
available to us in bad nightmare times), using a blanket as<br/>
protection, etc.<br/>

I need to have that too---but not due to a fear of anything. I just <br/>
*love* the weight on my lower legs and feet!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the &quot;old dog&quot; thang---one of my first dogs slept at the foot of <br/>
my bed. I used to slide my feet up under her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a beagle that snuggles st my side and a German shepherd that <br/>
will sleep on the pillow if given half an opportunity. No one at my <br/>
feet! Well, the occasional cat, but that&#39;s not weighty!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, as a child, you had an old dog? Safety feature? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
