<div id="ygrps-yiv-345857310">I bought one of those trays with the different sections you often see<br/>
at parties with dip and veggies. I started putting it out trying to<br/>
balance the nutritional and flavor options by having some nuts and<br/>
some fruits and/or veggies and something like pretzels for them to<br/>
choose from. At first it was a big hit but even though I tried<br/>
changing it up a bit keeping the things they really liked and changing<br/>
out the things not getting munched on they soon tired of it and things<br/>
started going to waste. It may be possible that this is just the<br/>
nature of our family as we tend to be that way with other food things<br/>
as well. <br/>
<br/>
Part of this may be due to a limited number of options as my family<br/>
and myself are picky about things like oxidized fruit and veggies and<br/>
meat that has been left out and such. I have tried to stick with<br/>
things that don&#39;t get funky quickly like cherry tomatoes and grapes.<br/>
<br/>
So far my list of monkey platter options have been:<br/>
Grapes<br/>
little orange sections<br/>
pineapple<br/>
craisons<br/>
trail mix<br/>
Cherry Tomatoes<br/>
cucumber slices<br/>
baby carrots<br/>
celery<br/>
pretzels<br/>
chips<br/>
nuts (of a variety of kinds and styles)<br/>
sesame stick <br/>
chex mix<br/>
fried won tons<br/>
rice crackers<br/>
humus<br/>
ranch <br/>
peanut butter<br/>
honey<br/>
sweat and sour<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You may notice that there is no candy and such listed. This is because<br/>
we have a candy pig that they store their candy in and can generally<br/>
eat from whenever they want.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335087630">I bought a tupperware container with sections and a lid that can sit on the bottom shelf of the fridge.  The food stays appealing looking, and the kids can get it themselves.  It&#39;s usually what they go for first when they&#39;re hungry/snackish, before they ask me for anything.<br/>
