<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818472876">Hi Robyn.  This is the part that we are not great at.  Science was never my<br/>
thing...until now.  LOVE IT NOW!  To many unconnected facts in school for<br/>
me.  In CA, we are now in NM, I had to write down everything dd did.  I came<br/>
across so many problems trying to find how to categorize something.  For<br/>
instance...as you put it...wave motion..physics.  Do you or does anyone know<br/>
of anywhere where this type of information is spelled out easily for me.<br/>
Kind of like you were so kind to do it below.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I do not need to do anything here in NM....but it&#39;s just<br/>
something I want to know for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>
Crystal<br/>
