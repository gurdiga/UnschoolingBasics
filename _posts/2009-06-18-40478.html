<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780919832">Hi all.  It seems that there are a few new unschooling books out <br/>
there, and I&#39;m wondering what they are.... I like to be able to give <br/>
recommendations to other people in our local group.  I&#39;ve got Rue&#39;s <br/>
book. <br/>
<br/>
  I believe Dayna Martin has a new book out, not sure of the name.  <br/>
Also, does Sandra have a new book coming out? (I have her Puddles <br/>
essays book)<br/>
<br/>
  Does anyone else know of any other books out there right now?  <br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter (don&#39;t think I spelled that right) has been <br/>
working on a new one too, not sure when it is coming out.<br/>
<br/>
  I know there are these great lists, and lots of blogs too, I&#39;m just <br/>
trying to track down the new books as they come out.  Since they are <br/>
usually publised by small publishers, they&#39;re not something people will <br/>
find on the Barnes&Noble website...<br/>
<br/>
  thanks,<br/>
<br/>
