<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537864832">Hi, all,<br/>
I just thought I would share a couple of online games that my kids<br/>
like since I have had problems finding good online games for them<br/>
because they are under 10.  My ds (9) wants to play more elaborate<br/>
games but doesn&#39;t read so hot so games like Runescape are too<br/>
difficult.  Anyway, here are a couple we like, if you have any<br/>
suggestions, please send them!  We are always on the look out!<br/>
<br/>
Club Penguin  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/club-penguin/en/">http://www.miniclip.com/games/club-penguin/en/</a><br/>
A MMORPG for little kids!  My 6 yo dd loves this game.  You create a<br/>
penguin character who gets to toodle around making friends and buying<br/>
stuff with &quot;money&quot; he earns by working in the Penguin World.  You can<br/>
interact with the other children online and create a &quot;buddy list&quot;.  My<br/>
kids love the &quot;ultra-safe&quot; mode because they can just pick from a list<br/>
of pre-written things to say to the other kids, like &quot;hi&quot;.  Great for<br/>
non-readers!  Mostly free but if your kid wants to be able to by stuff<br/>
the cost is around $6 a month.<br/>
<br/>
Adventure Quest <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.battleon.com/">http://www.battleon.com/</a><br/>
For the kids who aren&#39;t quite able to do Runescape or WOW.  Not a<br/>
multi-player game, but my 9 yo boy loves it.  One thing he says he<br/>
likes about it is that the reading is not so difficult.  Free for a<br/>
week, then your character disappears although you can make another<br/>
one.  Cost is a flat $20 which is cheaper than most PS games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028832999">Hi Alice,<br/>
<br/>
My kids, ages 8 & 11, and I all play Toontown.  It is an online role playing<br/>
game, where you are a cartoon character that<br/>
you get to create & then you fight robots (&quot;cogs&quot;) with gags (pie in the<br/>
face, squirtgun, etc).<br/>
You earn jellybeans by fishing or winning games after riding the trolley.<br/>
It is a great game.<br/>
Pretty easy for non-readers to play once you get them started.  Although<br/>
they might need help reading their &quot;toontasks&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here is more info:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online</a><br/>
<br/>
I think it is $5/month per account.<br/>
You can sign up for a free 3-day trial at toontown.com.<br/>
<br/>
I can send out an invitation email which is a 7-day trial.<br/>
note:  I sent one to Alice.  If anyone else would like one,<br/>
please email me.  I earn jellybeans for sending them.<br/>
<br/>
We started playing this game after I read the book &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me, Mom!<br/>
--  I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc Prensky.<br/>
It was one of the games the author recommends to parents to play with their<br/>
kids (if they don&#39;t already play<br/>
online games together).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

My kids also LOVE millsberry; at least, they did until our main computer<br/>
crashed.  LOL.  Hopefully we&#39;ll get that one going again soon so they can<br/>
continue!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397355207">Y&#39;all finally pulled me out of lurkdom!<br/>
Brief intro... I&#39;m married to an Army guy (who is in Baghdad), we&#39;ve got two<br/>
kids, 8 1/2 and 2, neither have ever been institutionalized or even forced<br/>
to do workbooks.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My dd love, love, LOVES My Little Ponies, so she&#39;s nuts for the game at<br/>
www.ponyisland.net (I think that&#39;s the address).  It costs about $20/year<br/>
and you can breed ponies of all kinds, sell them, develop them through<br/>
contests, and buy interesting homes and accessories.  It can be complicated<br/>
enough that even adults play it.  Kids who like mythical beings might like<br/>
it, too, as there are phoenix-ponies, valkyrie-ponies, and more.  It&#39;s a<br/>
fabulous way to learn genetics.  You do have to stay active with your<br/>
account, as you have to feed your ponies... if you don&#39;t log on and feed<br/>
them, they will die.<br/>
Oh, and there is a free one-month trial.<br/>
<br/>
She just started playing www.furry-paws.com which is a free RPG.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure what it&#39;s like yet, as she just started.  It seems to be better for the<br/>
younger set, as there is a looong tutorial.  Upon completing the tutorial<br/>
(which isn&#39;t mandatory), she&#39;ll get $5000 to spend on her dogs, kennel,<br/>
accessories, whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799858343">My girls were just asking me the other day if any of the unschoolers play on<br/>
horseland.com.  If any of your kids do I would love to be able to connect<br/>
them.  This is a really cool game that allows you to own horses and dogs.<br/>
You have to board your animals with someone to feed and care for them.  You<br/>
can buy and sell.  I really don&#39;t know all of the details, but my girls<br/>
really enjoy the game.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531290237">Hi:  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking too!  My dd 13 yo loves &quot;toontown&quot;.  She found it<br/>
when we started unschooling 2 years ago.  She was on Millsberry for<br/>
awhile and she occasionally plays Neopets.  She seems to bounce<br/>
around, whatever floats her fancy for the day.  But toontown has been<br/>
her main stay.<br/>
