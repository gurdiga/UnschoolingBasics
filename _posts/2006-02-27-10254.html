<div id="ygrps-yiv-696776609">Hi I am Christi, I stay home with our two children.  Wheatley just <br/>
turned 8 and Veronica will be 3 in April.  I love the freedom we <br/>
have found through unschooling.  I will say we are still in <br/>
transition and just living life.  I am working on getting my DH to <br/>
stop asking DS what he has learned today.  But, my DH has alot to <br/>
work on - that is another story.<br/>
<br/>
I will probably have lots of questions as time goes on.  I love <br/>
reading and learning from everyone.<br/>
<br/>
My question now is does anyone know anyone who has unschooled a <br/>
child with Down syndrome?  Veronica has down syndrome and I have to <br/>
say I question myself regarding her all the time.  I find very <br/>
little support for homeschooling her.  I belong to a few yahoo <br/>
groups but - they are pretty mainstream homeschoolers.  There are <br/>
all these - comments and opinions about how &quot;they&quot; learn and the <br/>
best way to teach them.  Sometimes I really wonder if I do need to <br/>
do something different with her.    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really know why I wonder so much because although she is <br/>
delayed she really is moving along and I see her learning all the <br/>
time, and figuring things out in her own way and in her own time.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have yammered on long enough.  I look forward to reading and <br/>
meeting everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796791087">Hi Christi<br/>
<br/>
The short answer is yes you have to do something different with her - <br/>
but not because of Down Syndrome but simply because Veronica is <br/>
Veronica just as Wheatley is Wheatley and Christi is Christi.<br/>
<br/>
Would finding some outside resources help? Maybe. I haven&#39;t been in <br/>
your shoes so I can&#39;t say. Follow your heart - it&#39;ll know what you <br/>
need to do<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735332467">hi, i&#39;m new and just posted an intro a couple of days ago. i have to get<br/>
this off of my shoulders once and for all. in the back of my mind i know<br/>
that this question shouldn&#39;t really come up if i believe in unschooling, but<br/>
it keeps nagging at me so i would love to hear how some responses.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
my biggest doubt about unschooling is how to teach my children to write. my<br/>
dh and i are both architects. in our case this means that we are very<br/>
visual. as it turns out neither of us really write well and we realise that<br/>
this is a critical skill later in life. how would we help our children learn<br/>
how to write if we don&#39;t know how to write well? i love to read (dh doesn&#39;t)<br/>
but this doesn&#39;t seem to have helped me become a better writer. my ds will<br/>
be trilingual (he&#39;s 17 mo) hopefully and this makes the problem even worse,<br/>
since i wouldn&#39;t be able to guage how he&#39;s doing in his father&#39;s mother<br/>
tongue (german). dh is also not so very fluent in english since his<br/>
day-to-day work activity is in german even though we live in new york city.<br/>
also, he doens&#39;t speak a word of my mother tongue which is indonesian. so<br/>
this also adds to the confusion.  i would be very happy if my ds could<br/>
eventually write well just in english. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i know that to unschool you have to trust in the child and his built-in<br/>
desire to learn but my self-doubt is getting the better of me. would i try<br/>
to get someone else to help him with this skill when he shows interest? it<br/>
just seems to me that writing is such a long term learning skill that one of<br/>
his parents should know how to do this well. otherwise it seems to me that<br/>
my ds will be short changed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m also enjoying the discussion about letting the child choose their own<br/>
foods. completely unheard of where i come from (i also have food issues)! my<br/>
brain is reeling from so much information - in a good way though :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489117258">Hi Riena (pretty name!)<br/>
<br/>
(I hope none of this is a repeat of what may have been posted. I <br/>
didn&#39;t read the replies yet)<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be helpful for you to stop saying that you don&#39;t <br/>
write well. :-) I understood your post just fine and I&#39;m sure <br/>
everyone else did also. I didn&#39;t see any typos and if there was, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t anymore than some of mine probably have had. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That bit of information was very helpful to me when I first read it <br/>
(I think on unschooling.com) because I always thought of myself as <br/>
not good in math, because that&#39;s what school told me. But in <br/>
reality, my everyday math is pretty good....and so is your <br/>
writing. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128324210">A friend of mine (who helped raise me) and I both homeschool - okay well she<br/>
homeschools and I unschool though she is working on the unschooling part she<br/>
just pulled her kids out of PSS and well. baby-steps, baby-steps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She has three kids B10, G7.9 and G6. Mine are B5.5 and G1.2.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when her oldest and my oldest get together they generally end up<br/>
rough housing and one ends up hurt then the one that got hurt hurts the<br/>
other and back and forth one out doing the other until one of them has<br/>
enough and comes and get one of us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They usually go back and forth blaming who started when it comes down to the<br/>
fact that they were rough housing and it got out of control. We don&#39;t assign<br/>
blame and we try to defuse the situation or I one of us tried to stay in the<br/>
room but we are often told to &quot;go away&quot; that they are playing. We know this<br/>
means they are up to something they don&#39;t want us to know about but it is<br/>
always harmless except the times that the boys start rough housing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they intend to hurt each other and it is never more then a<br/>
bump or bruise occasionally a scrape and the grossest think B10 does is lick<br/>
people. I try to mediate though I really don&#39;t want to hear who started<br/>
because the blame game is endless and all it comes down to is that they got<br/>
too excited, one got hurt by accident and the other strikes out at the other<br/>
in response.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I need a better way to defuse the situation. Any ideas to keep it from<br/>
happening? A way to improve the way they deal with each other. What to do or<br/>
say when they want me to go away?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s so critical, then how can you and your husband function as successful adults without this skill? How are you communicating on this list without being able to write? That&#39;s meant to be a joke of course. Writing a certain way is critical for school success, but this is unschooling and the process and form will flow differently. Your ability to think and read and write as well as you do will enable you to help your child learn when the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
And what kind of writing are you thinking of? There&#39;s the ability to physically form letters and words on paper, the skill of typing, the flair of telling a good story, the technique of putting together an editorial, etc. Some people are more drawn to one type of communicating than another. That&#39;s okay.<br/>

<br/>
He will. He&#39;s young now and it&#39;s so easy to become overwhelmed, but really he will learn. Even though he&#39;s exposed to other languages at home, he lives in the US. He&#39;ll be immersed in English. Surround him with books and tapes and music and pictures and stories. Give him plenty of paper and crayons and foam letters and paint and clay. You&#39;ll see him learn when he&#39;s ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310923953">Hi Shannon, <br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to diffuse it when it&#39;s happening, talk to them <br/>
before it happens...when you first get together. It&#39;s easier to <br/>
discuss something like this when it&#39;s NOT happening. <br/>
<br/>
We keep our hands (and feet) to ourselves in my home and that <br/>
includes guests. One one end, I have a 7 year old girl who would be <br/>
the one most likely to get hurt whenever any type of physical <br/>
touching activity went on...and on the other end I have a VERY tall <br/>
13 year old who could easily hurt another child without even <br/>
realising it. <br/>
<br/>
Being present with your kids would probably be a good thing also. <br/>
You asked for ways to help them deal with each other. By being <br/>
nearby and available, you can help them before it happens and needs <br/>
to be diffused. Maybe get out of the house when they come over...go <br/>
to a park or something. If they have that much energy, maybe a bike <br/>
ride or roller blading would be a way to get some of that energy out <br/>
and nobody gets hurt.       <br/>

*******************************<br/>
<br/>
hhhhhm. good one! we do (did) function well in our jobs, i&#39;m a SAHM now. but<br/>
i&#39;ve always felt very uncomfortable when my work required me to write since<br/>
i realise that however long i spend on it i will not reach the level of<br/>
eloquence that i would like to have. i think i write more now that i stay at<br/>

That&#39;s okay. <br/>
<br/>
*******************************<br/>
<br/>
i guess i&#39;m talking more about the flair of telling a good story and putting<br/>
together an editorial (i can&#39;t do that, and i know dh can&#39;t do this in<br/>
english - not sure about german). the basic skills i&#39;m not so afraid of<br/>
since dictionaries and spell check is all around us! i&#39;ve noticed that my<br/>
language skills depend very much with whom i communicate with within a<br/>
relatively short period of time. if i don&#39;t talk to an adult for a couple of<br/>
days, once i do the words don&#39;t come out so easily. this is very frustrating<br/>
to me and another source of self-doubt - i would like my ds to communicate<br/>
his thoughts easily in at least one language.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
and you&#39;re right, it&#39;s really ok for me to be able to communicate one way<br/>
and not another. but when it comes to my ds, i want him to have what i don&#39;t<br/>
have! this is really the key issue - more about me than anything else. i&#39;m<br/>
sure this is a normal feeling and a reason why people send their children to<br/>
preK with a price tag of ivy league schools. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
yes!!!!! you&#39;re right! i know i need to relax, but unschooling is such a BIG<br/>
decision that i need to think about it from now. i know i will get a lot of<br/>
resistance so i have to load up on knowledge and feel comfortable with it<br/>
before i can make others around us comfortable with it too. my MIL was an<br/>
elementary school principal and my parents in a passive way pushed us to<br/>
excel in school. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>him plenty of paper and crayons and foam letters and paint and clay. You&#39;ll<br/>
see him learn when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
*******************************<br/>
<br/>
we have a foam mat on the floor with the alphabet on it. not because we want<br/>
him to learn the letters, but we couldn&#39;t find a foam mat without letters!<br/>
when we first got the mat my husband started pointing out letters to him but<br/>
i asked him to stop. then a couple of weeks ago my ds (17 months) pointed to<br/>
a letter, looked at me and asked me what it was (he has a standard &quot;das da?&quot;<br/>
question for everything). so i told him what letter it was. it happened to<br/>
be an &quot;M&quot; and my husband a couple of weeks back had told him that &quot;M&quot; is for<br/>
&quot;mama&quot;. so he said, &quot;M, mama&quot;. he also recognizes the letters &quot;P&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;<br/>
and asks about random letters sometimes. he also points out the letter &quot;M&quot;<br/>
in different signs. like CMOM (children&#39;s museum of manhattan). <br/>
<br/>
what would unschoolers do in this case? after reading &quot;how children learn&quot; i<br/>
started to point to the words i was reading to him, mostly dr. seuss books<br/>
and he started to move my finger around so i read what he wanted me to read.<br/>
i was afraid at first that he was just repeating what my dh was saying to<br/>
him, but it seems that he understands the concept of letters and reading,<br/>
could this be at 17 mo? i acknowledge his interest in the letter M but don&#39;t<br/>
try to point out other letters unless he asks me specifically. he does get<br/>
excited when he finds an &quot;M&quot; somewhere and i do get excited with him by<br/>
matching his tone and facial expression. he also asks us to read signs on<br/>
the street by specifically pointing to them and will keep pointing till we<br/>
read it.<br/>
<br/>
what would other people do?<br/>
<br/>

my  biggest doubt about unschooling is how to teach my children to write. my<br/>
dh  and i are both architects. in our case this means that we are very<br/>
visual.  as it turns out neither of us really write well and we realise that<br/>
this is  a critical skill later in life. how would we help our children learn<br/>
how to  write if we don&#39;t know how to write well?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with the other posters.....I could read what you wrote and  <br/>
understand it easily!  That is the point of writing, to communicate  ideas.  Not all of <br/>
us can be poets or bestselling authors, that is a gift,  not unlike an <br/>
architect&#39;s visual gifts.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My husband is not a strong writer and he does have to write frequently for  <br/>
his work.  He&#39;s been through several writing courses (he&#39;s military, part  of <br/>
the job to have this continued education).  He struggles through these  <br/>
courses, barely passing them.  The interesting thing is that as his  personal editor, <br/>
I get to see writing from many of his co-workers and about half  of them can <br/>
write and the other half can barely form sentences.  They were  all schooled <br/>
and some of them went to prestigious colleges, and they all have to  take these <br/>
writing courses every few years.  Some of the important  documents just limp <br/>
along until they get put on someone&#39;s desk that can correct  them.  I have <br/>
rewritten dozens of letters and requests of some of the men  that work under my <br/>
husband.  They can be so poorly written that I have no  idea what they even <br/>
asking for!<br/>
 <br/>
When I worked, there was always someone in the office that was a gifted  <br/>
writer.  Anything important was always run by that person.<br/>
 <br/>
Even schooled people are not necessarily good writers.  In fact, most  people <br/>
I&#39;ve been around in the working world were barely functional  writers.  But <br/>
they knew it and got help when it was needed.<br/>
 <br/>
But I think children today have a great advantage over our  generation.  They <br/>
actually use the written word on the computer in their  day-to-day <br/>
communications!  I think the extent of my non-assignment writing  as a child was passing <br/>
notes in class.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling does not mean ONLY learning from your parents.  When your  child <br/>
has need for more than you can provide, you will be able to find someone  who <br/>
can.  Or it is something you can learn together!<br/>

goodness, don&#39;t we all... I had to deschool myself with this idea, too.  my<br/>
DD is a unique individual and will do things how she does them... not what I<br/>
would like for her to do or be.  I&#39;ve lived my life feeling that who I am<br/>
and what I do is not enough... and I want my daughter to know way down deep<br/>
in the core of who she is, that she is enough, period.  You hit the nail<br/>
right on the head... the issue is with you.<br/>

You can&#39;t change how other&#39;s feel about your decicions.  And really to feel<br/>
comfortable with unschooling, you need to feel comfortable with who you are<br/>
(or be willing to work on the processes nessecary to become so).  I&#39;ve also<br/>
found it helpful to not go into details about how our homeschool is run.  I<br/>
ve never mentioned unschooling to family (just the issue of homeschooling<br/>
caused huge issues).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
certainly, children are learning all the time, why not at 17 mo.  you&#39;re<br/>
little one is self-direct learning already!  how fun is that!  :)<br/>

You have a beautiful example of what unschooling is already in your little<br/>
one.  Enjoy it!  It&#39;s life, it&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s grace, it&#39;s fun!  Relax and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996451622">I have discussed it with each of them before it happens.<br/>
<br/>
We are a fairly physical group and we do lots of stuff unfortunately with<br/>
the weather being really cold, windy, rainy, and generally unpleasant we<br/>
don&#39;t do a lot outside. My son grew up here in Maryland and he goes outside<br/>
almost no matter what - even in the rain unless it is lightening. The other<br/>
three grew up in Tenn and are used to mild or hot weather and so prefer to<br/>
stay inside unless the weather is nice and even then it is difficult to get<br/>
them outside except the youngest who seems to enjoy it outside.<br/>
<br/>
I am always nearby and available but they also know that if they are going<br/>
to wrestle around or even using stuff animals to play their version of<br/>
&quot;pokemon&quot; dueling that if someone gets hurt - they aren&#39;t to hurt each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem I see is that they are both the oldest child and used to<br/>
getting their own way. They both think of the other as a brother and so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t always bother me when they disagree until mine says that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to be around anyone but his girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
Although we can&#39;t get outside, they are all artistic and we have decided to<br/>
start planning some art activities when they all get together. I know that<br/>
at least one will not want to do something we plan and that is okay but if<br/>
we can direct some of the energy until this spring when we can start going<br/>
outside we have a shot at defusing some of the battles.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Shannon, <br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to diffuse it when it&#39;s happening, talk to them <br/>
before it happens...when you first get together. It&#39;s easier to <br/>
discuss something like this when it&#39;s NOT happening. <br/>
<br/>
We keep our hands (and feet) to ourselves in my home and that <br/>
includes guests. One one end, I have a 7 year old girl who would be <br/>
the one most likely to get hurt whenever any type of physical <br/>
touching activity went on...and on the other end I have a VERY tall <br/>
13 year old who could easily hurt another child without even <br/>
realising it. <br/>
<br/>
Being present with your kids would probably be a good thing also. <br/>
You asked for ways to help them deal with each other. By being <br/>
nearby and available, you can help them before it happens and needs <br/>
to be diffused. Maybe get out of the house when they come over...go <br/>
to a park or something. If they have that much energy, maybe a bike <br/>
ride or roller blading would be a way to get some of that energy out <br/>
and nobody gets hurt.       <br/>

house, a car, an M, a sun, a rocketship, a B, etc. They were shapes <br/>
and squiggles that were in his environment so they got on paper. <br/>
Over time, he connected that these shapes communicated information - <br/>
for ex: he saw me making grocery lists, paying bills, writing to-do <br/>
lists for myself, etc. He also saw these same shapes in books and <br/>
magazines and signs and such. So it was all tumbled together in <br/>
making connections between the shapes and combining them <br/>
into &#39;words&#39;. I have around here somewhere his first grocery list <br/>
made when he was around 4 - he asked me to tell him the letters one <br/>
at a time for the words he wanted to write Carrots Milk Cheese I <br/>
think it is (gotta go hunt it down before it&#39;s gone). So, seeing the <br/>
shapes, making the shapes, combining the shapes, reading were all <br/>
part and parcel of a continuum, not separated at all. Kind of like <br/>
trying to pick out individual ingredients in soup. You can see the <br/>
veggies, the meat, maybe some seasonings, rice or pasta, and so on, <br/>
but they are not separate on the plate, they all merge together and <br/>
taste great. To pick each part out separately is to no longer have <br/>
soup - it&#39;s meat and veggies and broth on a plate side by side.<br/>

<br/>
From the early scribblings of a two year old (or younger) as soon as they are able to pick up a pen or pencil they will mimick your writings - it may look like scribbles to you but it is writing.  if you journal they will journal (i have spiral notebooks of their scribbling), if you make lists their scribbles will look like lists.  If you write stories, their scribbles will look like stories.  From there it progessed to menus...lists of food for their restaurants, signs for their stores.  My girls had businesses set up and needed names and numbers to add credibility to their activity.  They were bankers and realators, tax accessors and county clerks, postal clerks and food managers (all depending on where life had taken us in the previous days or weeks)<br/>
<br/>
As they grew, it was no longer scribbles but asked for spellings...how to write a certain letter...how to write a certain word...we had a letter chart posted somewhere on the wall but they always seemed to like it better to copy my writing.  <br/>
<br/>
We still do a lot of dictating.  My dh and I still will do a lot of writing for them as it&#39;s just easier.  They know the tool of using the skills of others.<br/>
<br/>
Today my dd asked how a certain letter looked in script.  They progress from print to mimicking script...connecting letters...each child has their own ability in writing their letters/words clearly - has nothing to do with age...(linked to fine motor skills)..each child has their own ability in absorbing the concept of capitals and lower cases...<br/>

<br/>
My kids knew that the words in books were saying something even before they knew how to read them. Writing with Conor started with his name probably. Little by little he&#39;d write more things when we&#39;d send cards or notes or whatever. I just drew the letters and he copied them. He was probably  4 or 5 when he started. Writing is NOT his thing though and he never liked it. Still doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Casey was 18 months old when she started learning her letters and three when she started writing and she wrote a lot. Still does. <br/>
Her first writing was because she wanted to write a note to her best friend next door. She asked me how to make the letters to write each word she wanted in her note. I described verbally to her how the letters were formed. She put them sort of in order but kind of all over the page. You really had to work to find the words. &lt;g&gt; She just kept at it because she desparately wanted to write. Much more than she wanted to learn to read. She&#39;s still more of a writer than a reader although she reads plenty.<br/>
<br/>
Later she moved on to inventive spelling. She was writing so much and asking for so much spelling that I explained she could write the words as they sounded and people would still be able to read it. This really freed her up and she wrote a series of stories like that. She was 5 almost 6 then. Although she could sound out words and do some sight reading, I wouldn&#39;t say she was a real reader till about 8 or 9.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766680346">~&gt;&gt;&gt; Trust the journey. Maybe you&#39;ll start to see that school lied to<br/>
you...you are not &quot;bad at writing&quot;. You&#39;ve been duped and it&#39;s time to<br/>
start embracing the things you&#39;re good at and let those old wounds heal.<br/>
<br/>
hmmmm... this is really food for thought... i&#39;ve been thinking about this<br/>
since i&#39;ve read your message Ren several days ago.~<br/>
<br/>
I feel the need to expand on this whole writing issue.:)<br/>
<br/>
There are different kinds of writers, we all know that. But do we<br/>
really think about the different ways and methods of writing? Do most<br/>
schooled minds really grasp that not everyone needs to be &quot;good at<br/>
writing&quot; only good enough to communicate?<br/>
<br/>
What IS &quot;good at writing&quot;?<br/>
I can write my feelings and thoughts out. I can write about our lives<br/>
and things I feel passionate about, but I have yet to craft a really<br/>
well written piece of fiction (in my own opinion).<br/>
<br/>
When I write an article or essay, I send it on to people I know have<br/>
good editing skills! I don&#39;t place my comma&#39;s correctly, nor do I use<br/>
the correct grammar some of the time (ok, a lot).<br/>
But somehow I&#39;ve made a bit of money publishing a few articles.:)<br/>
So what IS this idea of &quot;being good&quot;?  There are different kinds of<br/>
&quot;good&quot; in the writing world. There are technical writers and fiction<br/>
writers and editors and ghost writers (where someone else will get the<br/>
credit for THEIR writing!!) and all different ways of communicating<br/>
that can equal &quot;good&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
School sends this bizarre message that we all need the SAME set of<br/>
skills to succeed in life. It&#39;s totally WRONG!<br/>
We all were born hardwired with certain skills/gifts/talents.<br/>
Our environment either aided or hindered that hardwiring.<br/>
So here we are today, each of us with different desires, interests,<br/>
passions, skills and talents.  That&#39;s a really great thing, this<br/>
diversity we all bring to the table.<br/>
<br/>
Each person has a unique journey on this earth. Only that person can<br/>
choose the skills and talents they need to develop for their journey.<br/>
Writing is just one tool amongst many,many tools we can choose to<br/>
develop.  Even those of us that call ourselves &quot;writers&quot; are not<br/>
&quot;good&quot; at every aspect of it!!:) Nor should we carry the baggage<br/>
around that we need to be!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625511334">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I love hearing what you have to say.  You seem so much further along on the<br/>
self-healing journey than I am.  <br/>
<br/>
A question for you... how do you continue along your path when friends and<br/>
family seem to try to derail you at every turn?  I guess I struggle with the<br/>
lack of support from those who I feel should support me no matter what. <br/>
Most of the time I feel very alone in this world.  I&#39;m certain that most<br/>
people think I&#39;m nuts.<br/>
<br/>
How do you heal when life keeps flinging #### at you?  I&#39;ve explained to a<br/>
dear uncle of mine that I have such deep wounds that even the slightest<br/>
scratch hurts and brings back all of the pain.  How do you move on from<br/>
that?  <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m afraid to be seen... afraid of letting the anger out... afraid<br/>
of opening up because I am so easily hurt...<br/>
<br/>
I feel pain that&#39;s not even mine... not like that&#39;s a bad thing... but where<br/>
does the healing begin when there is so much pain in the world?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;d love to hear how you and others start your healing path and your<br/>
struggles with it and if you still have stumbling blocks now and again.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720474554">&quot;A question for you... how do you continue along your path when<br/>
friends and family seem to try to derail you at every turn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Avoid them.<br/>
Seriously, I think part of the healing journey is to surround yourself<br/>
with positive people that are spiritually evolved enough to let you BE.<br/>
People that are filled with the joy of LIFE and are interesting and<br/>
open minded. They&#39;re out there you know. Open yourself up to the<br/>
universe, trust that you will find the people you are meant to find<br/>
and it will happen.<br/>
They might not be unschoolers, but they will honor your unschooling<br/>
journey.:)  They will be curious, passionate, joyful people that will<br/>
enrich your life. They are out there, waiting to connect with you at<br/>
just the right moment.<br/>
<br/>
For now, try to limit contact with people that re-open old wounds.<br/>
Until you&#39;re strong enough to not let it affect you, be very, very<br/>
careful about the amount of time and what events you choose to attend<br/>
with negative people. None would be best, but I also understand trying<br/>
to keep family communication open.<br/>
Limit the conversations. Change the subject if it gets too close for<br/>
comfort. I&#39;ve found the best method of deflection is to ask someone a<br/>
question about themselves, preferably one that lets them share what<br/>
they enjoy or like to brag about.<br/>
<br/>
Find that well of peace within you. Try to remember the perfection<br/>
that is YOU...that place of accepting what IS, and who you are right<br/>
now. Where you are, is simply where you are. You can&#39;t be anywhere<br/>
else but right here, right now.<br/>
Whatever wounds you carry, that&#39;s all part of the<br/>
right-here-right-now.  It&#39;s all ok. Be ok with all of that and make an<br/>
agreement with yourself to not push the healing process. It is<br/>
happening constantly, as you question and ponder and grow. It is<br/>
happening as you trust your children and learn to find the joy in the<br/>
simple moments. It is happening as your awareness and mindfulness grows.<br/>
<br/>
As YOU grow, the wounds will seem smaller and less significant. So<br/>
don&#39;t focus on the hurt or pain, just focus on the joy and<br/>
growth....soon it will be enough to diminish all that hurt to the<br/>
point that you feel strong and brave and unable to get beat down.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, protect yourself. You wouldn&#39;t hesitate to protect<br/>
your children from a bully. YOU deserve the same love and protection<br/>
you give your children.<br/>

It&#39;s still gonna be darn hard for me to let her go to school again (if <br/>
she chooses to do it), but it helps to know that I haven&#39;t failed in <br/>
some way because she wants to go back. She does seem to enjoy our <br/>

I&#39;ll just go with her flow...<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, yesterday we got our Lift the Lid on Mummies kit in <br/>
the mail, and she sat down as soon as we got home and did everything in <br/>
it. At one point, she stood up and exclaimed, &quot;I LOVE HOMESCHOOLING! <br/>

Isn&#39;t that an awesome little kit, Breezy?  Tristan loves Egypt (he&#39;s always proud to tell people he plans to be an &quot;Archaeologist Egyptologist&quot; &lt;vbg&gt; ), and we got this kit a few days after I pulled him from school.<br/>
<br/>
I found out recently that his old class is learning about Egypt right now.  I&#39;m SO glad he isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;m sure he is probably more knowledgeable about the subject than his former teacher, and I can just envision him trying to correct the teacher while she lectures.  LOL<br/>
