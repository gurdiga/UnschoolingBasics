<div id="ygrps-yiv-325275860">I live in Richardson, about 30 minutes away.  Texas is VERY friendly towards<br/>
homeschooling in general, and my wife and I are members of at least two<br/>
(that I know of) local unschooling groups.  The annual Rethinking Education<br/>
conference is held in Irving, or thereabouts, which is about 20 minutes away<br/>
from Lewisville.  There&#39;s a bunch of us here.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand homeschooling laws here in Texas, it actually rests on a<br/>
couple of court decisions.  I don&#39;t believe we even have annual or regular<br/>
academic &quot;equivalency&quot; tests (y&#39;all with older kids, correct me on this if<br/>
I&#39;m wrong).<br/>

&gt;   Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband is looking at a possible job transfer to Lewisville, TX.<br/>
&gt; Anyone in or around the area who could tell me how Unschooling<br/>
&gt; friendly it is, and how Texas is in regards to homeschooling laws? I<br/>
&gt; posted this on two lists, so sorry if you received it twice!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Much Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129754790">I used to live in Lewisville - before I moved here to Tucson almost 7 years<br/>
ago.<br/>
(And in Richardson as well, when I first moved to Texas when I was 12).<br/>
Texas is a great place to unschool!  I know a few unschoolers in the area.<br/>
I&#39;ll  check in with them about local groups & get back to you...<br/>
