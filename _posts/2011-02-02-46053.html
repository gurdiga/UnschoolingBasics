My son (11) absolutely loved the Assassins Creed series and devoured it in  <br/>
the past few months. He is looking for other historically based games to <br/>
try. <br/>
 <br/>
He prefers game play on the XBox 360 but we have all the systems. <br/>
 <br/>
If you or your kids are into Assassins Creed, what other games out there  <br/>
have a similar style of play? <br/>
 <br/>
(Historical setting, historical weapons, integrating history, etc)  <br/>

Assassins Creed is a kind of like Prince of Persia. Maybe Prince of Persia or <br/>
one of the many sequels would appeal. I always thought it was a very pretty <br/>
game, but I was never quite technically proficient enough to play it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eternal Sonata is a kind of historical. Again it wasn&#39;t a hit with any of us, <br/>
but I know lots of folks really enjoyed it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600828070">That sounds like so much fun! I hope you share the details of your trip  <br/>
when you go. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the suggestion. My other boys love those games but it is not  <br/>
what my oldest is looking for. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, Alex.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758091951">Thanks, Cara and Schuyler. Uncharted 2 and Price  of Persia are closer to <br/>
what we are looking for. I haven&#39;t heard of Eternal  Sonata. I&#39;ll check that <br/>
one out too. <br/>
 <br/>
I really appreciate everyone&#39;s thoughts. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498842585">I liked Gun for the PS2. It&#39;s set in the old west, you ride horses, shoot pistols and various other historically accurate weapons. There are some cowboy vs. Indian scenarios, horse thieves, sniper mission, wildlife hunting missions, etc. I thought it was fun but I don&#39;t remember it being a very long game. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s exactly similar to Assassin&#39;s Creed but it does have a lot of historical stuff going on.<br/>
