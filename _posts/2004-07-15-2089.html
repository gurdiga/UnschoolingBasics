<div id="ygrps-yiv-72869007">***i am wondering how your children learn  much when its just left up to<br/>
them?***<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you could do right now is relax and enjoy your baby. <br/>
While you watch your baby learn to walk and talk and zoom around and<br/>
throw and climb and dress (and undress!&lt;g&gt;) and all the things babies and<br/>
toddlers do, you will begin to understand how and why kids learn. <br/>
<br/>
Kids learn from living in an environment where interesting things are<br/>
happening.  They learn because they are part of the human race.  We are<br/>
creatures who are learning every minute of our lives. <br/>
<br/>
***...seems to me like the kids wouldn&#39;t want to learn on their own due<br/>
to lack of motivation...***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gently offering this as something to ponder;  Why do you think a<br/>
person wouldn&#39;t want to learn?  What about being ignorant and feeling<br/>
left out would appeal to a person? <br/>
<br/>
When my son was very little he watched us and saw that we took a glass<br/>
from the cabinet when we wanted something to drink.  He understood where<br/>
the glasses where and what they were for.  He couldn&#39;t reach them, so he<br/>
surmised he could push a chair to the counter and climb for a glass. <br/>
What made him do that?  He could have asked for a drink (he learned to<br/>
talk very early) so why did he want to find a way to get the glass<br/>
himself?   It&#39;s because that&#39;s what humans do.  We observe, think,<br/>
participate, learn and finally &quot;do&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
The bigger question in my mind is why anyone would ever imagine a person<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to?  Wait, I know!  Because of school.   In school we&#39;re<br/>
made to believe learning comes in categories with some aspects being much<br/>
more important than others.   We&#39;re made to feel we&#39;re empty vessels<br/>
until an expert opens our head and pours the knowledge in.   It&#39;s just<br/>
not so.  Humans existed long before schools and if school was the only<br/>
way to learn what we&#39;d needed to get along in the world no one would have<br/>
been left.<br/>
<br/>
*** i cant imagine a 12 y.o. learning something &quot;important&quot; like math, or<br/>
spelling<br/>
, or whatever , without any structure.***<br/>
<br/>
Conveniently, my son is twelve. &lt;g&gt;   He&#39;s never been to school and has<br/>
always been an unschooler.  This week he&#39;s learning to drive.  He told me<br/>
he wanted to learn and we&#39;ve been going out on the back roads and he&#39;s<br/>
been driving.  He&#39;s doing very well.   He&#39;s a kind of natural at the<br/>
wheel, maybe from all these years of playing video games and keeping<br/>
characters aligned on narrow paths, avoiding obstacles.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learning about  the life in Iraq for military men as his uncle is<br/>
here on R&R.   <br/>
He&#39;s learning more about Hitler after checking out &quot;The Rise and Fall of<br/>
the  Third Reich&quot; by William Shirer. <br/>
It&#39;s an enormous book, and dry, and he&#39;s plodding through it and looking<br/>
up or asking about things he doesn&#39;t understand.<br/>
He&#39;s learning about Yellow Bellied Marmots because we pass a family of<br/>
them every evening on our walk and these are the first he&#39;s been able to<br/>
really observe.   He&#39;s looked up everything he can find about them. <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have time to read everything he&#39;s learning about in summer of<br/>
2004. &lt;g&gt;  But he made coffee for my mom when she came and I was in the<br/>
shower and they were happily chatting about hummingbirds when I came out.<br/>
 He bought me a Chai when he ran into the store for a Coke yesterday.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask for one, he just noticed them there in the cooler and knew I<br/>
liked them and brought one out to me, paid for with his own money.   Last<br/>
night he did his own laundry and took out the trash.  I didn&#39;t ask him<br/>
to, he just saw there were things needed to be done.   All of this is<br/>
important life stuff and all of it came to him without lessons. <br/>
<br/>
This is not a remarkable boy in any sense that would impress snobby IQ<br/>
testers or &quot;educational&quot; professionals.  He can add and subtract and form<br/>
a complete sentence but there&#39;s nothing wildly spectacular about him<br/>
unless you consider his confidence and joy and fearlessness when learning<br/>
and his perfect understanding of what it is to be a free, capable,<br/>
learning human being. <br/>
<br/>
***&quot;important&quot; like math, or spelling, or whatever ,***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forty one and I couldn&#39;t recite the multiplication tables to you nor<br/>
could I spell &quot;multiplication&quot; correctly without the help of spell check.<br/>
&lt;G&gt;  Yet I&#39;ll bet anyone who looks at this e-mail will be able to read<br/>
the words.  (Whether it will make sense to them is a different matter.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;)   I&#39;ve owned my own business, worked for people who&#39;d have me back<br/>
again, I can balance my checkbook and I&#39;ve written letters to my senators<br/>
and congressmen.   I&#39;m getting by!  I&#39;m not a math wiz nor a spelling wiz<br/>
and I went to public school, had a structured education and somehow<br/>
missed those things anyway.   Still, without mastering those skills I&#39;ve<br/>
had a successful, happy life.  I&#39;ve lived all these years since school<br/>
and I haven&#39;t needed to recite multiplication tables once.   I&#39;m sure<br/>
it&#39;s on my permanent record somewhere that I&#39;ll never make it. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***i understand that they learn thru life experiences, but they don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily learn every thing they might need.***<br/>
<br/>
I went to school but I didn&#39;t learn everything I needed.  Lessons are no<br/>
guarantee a person is learning, much less learning &quot;everything&quot;.   But<br/>
what you come to understand about learning is that it&#39;s not a thing<br/>
that&#39;s ever accomplished.  It&#39;s a continual process.  When we need or<br/>
want information we find it.  When we need or want a skill we acquire it.<br/>
 People go on from school to hold jobs, pay taxes, vote, buy properties, <br/>
find life partners, have babies, cope with illness, travel, explore,<br/>
climb mountains... how did they learn that?  They learned by living.  <br/>
<br/>
***how do you get a child to want to learn instead of play video games,<br/>
etc?.***<br/>
<br/>
Play *is* learning.  Playing video games might be one of the most<br/>
effective ways to acquire skills I&#39;ve ever seen.  The player is<br/>
interested, challenged, but not beyond what she can eventually master and<br/>
encouraged to go on by the thrill of accomplishment and ever increasing<br/>
challenge.   Just like life, only with pause, save, and restart. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to get a child to want to learn.  All you have to do is<br/>
avoid turning leaning into a boring, terrible experience.  The way you<br/>
avoid that is by seeing your child as a whole and perfect learning<br/>
individual and then, helping that individual do the things he or she<br/>
wants to do.  Don&#39;t give lessons, don&#39;t lecture, don&#39;t make learning out<br/>
to be something that has to be done *to* your child.  Convince yourself<br/>
learning is what people are all about.  <br/>
<br/>
Read what you can about unschooling and let go of schoolish ideas about<br/>
what people need.  Look at your remarkable child and watch how life<br/>
carries your baby along.  Provide him or her with interesting things and<br/>
a happy mom and days full of play and you will very quickly understand<br/>
how and why kids learn - how and why we all learn, our whole lives long. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And ask lots of questions on lists like this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
