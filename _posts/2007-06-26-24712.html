<div id="ygrps-yiv-199938771">I have read many of John Holts books and numerous unschooling <br/>
websites/blogs and I am both excited and nervous. Most of the <br/>
featured families seem to live much more enriching lives than our <br/>
family.  I am not complaining, I love our life and felt content, but <br/>
now I wonder if it is &quot;enough&quot; of an environment to unschool.  We <br/>
live in the suburbs instead of on a farm or in a city, although we <br/>
do go to museums and outings a couple times a month.  We don&#39;t have <br/>
a homebased enterprise where the children can learn about economics <br/>
and we don&#39;t have jobs where we can take them.  I do volunteer work, <br/>
but it is with battered women, so I can&#39;t involve the kids there, <br/>
although I am sure that there are community programs where the kids <br/>
could get involved if we decided to go in that direction instead.  I <br/>
am not super creative, although I can work a glue gun in a pinch, <br/>
but I don&#39;t make my own furniture or clothes.  We do enjoy our <br/>
children and like spending time with them, and as we are learning <br/>
more about unschooling we are shedding a lot of our prior notions <br/>
about what is kid stuff and what is for adults (although I still <br/>
can&#39;t get hubby to let dear son use power tools----he is 4)  <br/>
So I guess I am wondering how average (god I hate that word) people <br/>
unschool.  Do they?  Or maybe this is also an opportunity to really <br/>
examine the &quot;averageness&quot; of our lives and make some changes?  Are <br/>
there any reading materials that include how children are soaking up <br/>
knowledge in the midst of conventional life?  Or are the featured <br/>
families I am reading about not the norm but the &quot;goal&quot;?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756562711">We don&#39;t live on a farm or in a city - it&#39;s 15-20 minutes to the <br/>
mall (and DS has his own Starbuck&#39;s card lol). I WOH fulltime, DH is <br/>
fulltime at home with DS. Our days consist of lots of videogames <br/>
(both DH and DS love them, I&#39;m just getting going on an old GameBoy <br/>
with Pokemon Ruby), movies, TV, occasional campfires in the back <br/>
yard (don&#39;t forget the &#39;smores!!), lots of time hanging out with our <br/>
games (both guys have Nintendo DSs and I have the GBA) at Starbucks. <br/>
We look at stars when the night sky is really clear - but we don&#39;t <br/>
know all the constellations and we don&#39;t (yet) have a super <br/>
telescope. Yesterday DH spent a good part of the day making a case <br/>
for his DS from duct tape (it&#39;s pretty cool). DS and I want one too <br/>
so we&#39;re going to Staples tonight to pick up multi colors of duct <br/>
tape. Most of what goes into blogs and postings are the &quot;highlights&quot; <br/>
and occasional &quot;lowlights&quot;, not the average days. I might post about <br/>
how DS did this or that cool thing but that&#39;s one &quot;postable&quot; thing <br/>
among dozens of days.<br/>
<br/>
A typical week is basically: I work, they game, housework gets done, <br/>
we eat on a fairly regular basis, grocery shopping gets done, we <br/>
watch movies/TV (old episodes of MASH and Monty Python are &#39;hot&#39; at <br/>
our house right now), we play with the dog, watch the fish in the <br/>
fish tank (nothing &#39;fancy&#39;, some mollies, some neon tetras, and of <br/>
course the scum sucker fish), maybe play some board games. That&#39;s <br/>
about it. Oh, we do have one &#39;date night&#39; per week, that alternates <br/>
between DH and DS (I get 4 dates each month, they each get 2). When <br/>
DH and I go out, DS visits MIL and FIL.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t write off the kids being involved with your volunteer <br/>
work. Yes, they probably can&#39;t come with you BUT they could <br/>
collect/donate toys for the kids of the women that come through the <br/>
shelter (for example).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re focusing on what you don&#39;t have, don&#39;t do, etc. What DO you <br/>
have? What DO you love? What DO the kids love? If there are things <br/>
you&#39;d love to do but haven&#39;t, look for ways to explore them. Big <br/>
exciting stuff all the time isn&#39;t really typical as far as I&#39;ve <br/>
seen. Curiousity about the whole world is. And when you&#39;re curious <br/>
about everyone and everything, life really isn&#39;t so boring -there&#39;s <br/>
always something new to explore, do, learn - whether it&#39;s clearing a <br/>
bit of backyard space for a firepit or learning how to make sushi or <br/>
shopping in an ethnic market or going to a park in a different part <br/>
of town. Your kids already know this, learn from them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something to look into if your kids are interested - maybe <br/>
see if there&#39;s a food pantry associated with the shelter so all <br/>
y&#39;all can work together.<br/>
<br/>
But the overall question is more &quot;are the kids bored&quot;? Real life <br/>
isn&#39;t always mile-a-minute excitement, and that&#39;s a good thing. I <br/>
enjoy having long days of doing &quot;nothing much&quot; with my kids - <br/>
nesting. <br/>
<br/>
That sort of thing doesn&#39;t make good press, so it doesn&#39;t get <br/>
written about much. Yesterday, my dd and I made playdoh and she and <br/>
Ray played on the new PS2 most of the day. She climbed trees and <br/>
spun on her sit-n-spin at various times, found a little mud to <br/>
smoosh, and dug a really nice hole in the sawdust pile. Ray worked <br/>
on making a spear and did some target-practice with it in between <br/>
playing on the PS2. That&#39;s about it. Pretty normal day. We do have <br/>
some excitement now and then, but our life is pretty cozy, rather <br/>
than thrilling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228339126">I&#39;ve been struggling with the same concerns about whether our &#39;average&#39; life measures up for <br/>
  an unschooling environment. Some of the unschooler&#39;s blogs I&#39;ve read from various sites have left me questioning if I am a slacker! Granted, I have a new baby, and have to let a LOT of things go, but I have a hard time watching my 4.8yo occupy himself so much with TV and video games, which I allow only so I can have a breather. But when I take stock of what we accomplish in a days&#39; time, from conversations we have (that a month later he&#39;ll repeat ver-batem), to cooking time shared, and the oh-so-many learning opportunities that fall in-between our &#39;activities&#39;. I&#39;m raising a compassionate, self-motivated, well grounded little boy, who is a joy to be around. <br/>
   I guess the question is, am I self-motivated? In my own way, I am. During my entire childhood I had a scheduled life. To this day, my mother attempts to impose a schedule on me (to no avail). I have chosen an unscheduled life, whereby I live by inspiration. &#39;What do I feel like doing now&#39; is what I live by. I offer the same lifestyle to my children. I feel it is their right, as is it mine. When I am still, inspiration comes. Some days I crave learning new things. I find my 4.8yo is the same (as I presume we all are, given the freedom to be still long enough to listen to ourselves.) <br/>
  Writing gives me clarity, and I have found the reassurance I was seeking by just writing about this. I guess one unschooling principle that applies to this subject is &#39;not imposing outside standards/expectations on our children&#39;s development.&#39; Now if we could only figure out how to take that advice re: our own parental development!    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964657263">unschoolingbasicsSo your kids haven&#39;t won the spelling bee, enrolled in college at 12 and found a cure for cancer? You are not hosting cow milking lessons while wearing your denim jumper? You and the kids did not build your home from the plans on the back of a cereal box? <br/>
<br/>
And, yet, some of us manage to unschool. :)<br/>
<br/>
A dear unschooling friend and I joke that nobody really suspects what we are up to. We look so white bread suburban it is ridiculous. She&#39;s driving around in her minivan and me in my (very used :) ) Volvo station wagon. The kids are being carted to this event or that activity. DH&#39;s both go to work and we Moms stay home. How &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot; could we look?? :)<br/>
<br/>
But the secret is that what things look like from the outside is not what matters. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are being carted to things they chose! For instance. <br/>
<br/>
When we are at home, we are not sitting around the kitchen table crunching math worksheets. We are online or DS is gaming or DH and DD are puttering in the yard or we are lounging with whatever book we picked up at the library or. . . etc. . . just glorious everyday life. In a loving home with mutual support. <br/>
<br/>
We have not built any rocket ships in the kitchen sink but we do what we want to do and are happily unschooling. And you can too! :)<br/>

home parent with DS, going places and doing things. He&#39;d look so <br/>
loverly in a denim jumper with his big old beard! Think a youngish <br/>
Santa (pre-white hair) in a jumper and that&#39;d be DH. It&#39;d make it a <br/>

And my DH wears bibs/jeans overalls ( AKA denin jumper ) everyday morning  and night to milk our cows...lol.<br/>
