<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971704871">Hi everyone!<br/>
I need some input on how to deal with my 5-6 yr old daisy troop. I have <br/>
been noticing as the year goes on that my girls are having some issues <br/>
with each other. I think it is in part due to school (my dd is the only <br/>
hsing child let alone radical unschooled child!)I am the leader of the <br/>
troop and I am trying to find ways to help the children deal with each <br/>
other. <br/>
A lot of the girls are being really mean to each other. I think it is <br/>
in part due to being around each other a lot. Secondly because of their <br/>
own family dynamics. <br/>
I think our next meeting is going to be about respecting each other and <br/>
ourselves etc. I am hopeing to show them that we should try and treat <br/>
everyone respectfully. Such a hard thing at this age with children that <br/>
I doubt are given much respect. My dd is having a hard time dealing <br/>
with a couple of girls because they are SO mean and she has never been <br/>
treated that way before. Tonight I talked her through some ways to <br/>
problem solve, one being to avoid them. (her idea) Another was to plain <br/>
tell them they are being mean and she doesn&#39;t like it. Thankfully she <br/>
isn&#39;t usually targeted (this is actually the first time) but it bothers <br/>
her when they are mean to others because she is so in tune with others <br/>
feelings.<br/>
So really the answer I would like is how to help them as a group to get <br/>
along. Any fun games we could play to instill respecting each other. <br/>
Also how to explain to our dd how to deal with others in these <br/>
situations because it is part of life. Any good tips?? :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Jessica:)</div>

that you can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them to be nicer.<br/>
<br/>
Set up the environment to support being nicer. Don&#39;t set up situations <br/>
where girls have to be &quot;picked&quot; by other girls, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even do small group things if that creates any conflict about who <br/>
is going to be in which group.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us when the conflicts or meanness occur and we can give you more <br/>
specific ideas for setting things up to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Keep them so busy and having so much fun that they are in too good a <br/>
mood and don&#39;t have time to be mean. That&#39;s the real solution.<br/>

By a Canadian author -- great resource.  As Alfie Kohn <br/>
says, &#39;competition (k-12) teaches only one thing:  that other people <br/>
are obstacles to my success.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244333524">That looks like an awesome book! <br/>
<br/>
I am going to get it. We don&#39;t play competition games though. It is mostly taking turns that bothers them right now. <br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about making a chart of who has done certain things to make sure everyone gets a turn. I hate charts so I was REALLY reluctant to do this. But unless someone has a better idea, I think it might help in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I am also thinking of doing the wrinkled heart activity. Has anyone done that or read about it before? I thought that might be a good way to see how what you say affects the person you say it to. I really want to girls to respect their own feelings/boundaries while respecting the others in our group. It is a really hard thing to do with so many different personalities and this age. Mostly I don&#39;t like how they are hurting each others feelings. A few parents have just said it is normal for this age but I don&#39;t think it makes it right. I don&#39;t really think most of them realize how mean they are being. They are all GREAT girls. I really cherish each of their uniqueness. I think if they could work out the kinks they will all get along great (as much as groups do) and we will have a really fun group!<br/>
