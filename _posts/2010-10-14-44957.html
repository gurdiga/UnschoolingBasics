<div id="ygrps-yiv-740781591">She says she&#39;s doing this because a good friend of hers did it recently and she also says it feels daring and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like not letting my husband know, but although he is an awesome unschooler, this is one area he is uncomfortable with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899105339">Is it legal for her to get it done?<br/>
I had it done and I loved it but it does take a good six months, sometimes <br/>
loger, to heal completely.<br/>
Its one of the piercings that causes most infection so it does need to be well <br/>
taken cared of.<br/>
I think they are beautiful and  sexy. I took mine off during pregnancy when I <br/>
lost the ring.<br/>
It closed  off  and there is still a  mark and hole on top of my belly button.<br/>
I may re-do it just to get rid of it someday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861509189">Fortunately, she&#39;s decided to not do it (atleast not anytime soon).  We spoke with a friend who has many piercings, who had a lot to say about concerns about belly piercings.  We also looked at some pics of belly piercing infections, so things are on hold right now - Thank goodness.  <br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate that she did want to discuss it with me before she did it, unlike her friend who still hasn&#39;t told her mother that she did hers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
