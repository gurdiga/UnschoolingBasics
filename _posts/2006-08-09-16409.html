<div id="ygrps-yiv-946675991">Just thought id share my mix of humor and frustrations in more bored random <br/>
web  searching today.  Yahoo has a forum called yahoo answers  which I got to <br/>
by googling how much is a broken front axle.  After discovering that i truly <br/>
dont know anything about cars I decided to type in what is unschooling......  <br/>
WOW lets just say if i were still new  id would have never trusted myself to try <br/>
to let go after browsing there!  So if your bored theres a whole lot of <br/>
posting that can be done!  Id say just google yahoo answers to get started!<br/>

I have no desire to debate ignorant uninformed people.<br/>
One post was really odd though. In response to &quot;What&#39;s your take on Unschooling?&quot;<br/>
Someone posted &quot;It&#39;s OK except for the creepy christian aspect&quot;<br/>
BeeZaar!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  HRmmm....perhaps the only book theyve seen at barnes and noble was unschooling children in the freedon of christ ( or something like that) ?<br/>
   <br/>
  Or wait...surely we are one of those cults who gasp! treat our children with respect love and kindness<br/>
   <br/>
  growl :) I probably shouldnt be posting today..Im in a cynical pissy and downright rotten mood<br/>
