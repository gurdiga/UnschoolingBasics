<br/>
Well said, Judy!<br/>
<br/>
Maria<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Well, not exactly.<br/>
This is a list for those looking to make the leap to unschooling.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t even come close to helping others understand how unschooling works.<br/>
First of all, the mom who responded doesn&#39;t have a child over age five. <br/>
So, she really isn&#39;t technically an unschooler. Her only &quot;school age&quot; child is in<br/>
kindergarten.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s also assuming the worst of her children from the get-go.  <br/>
She&#39;s still controlling what they do. She&#39;s assuming that they will not<br/>
chose healthful foods or sleep when they are tired or wake when they are rested <br/>
or ever turn off the tv.<br/>
Well, let&#39;s look at her points:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with my own children.<br/>
My children are 5 and under.  Their birthdays are in April.  Lauren (2 yo)<br/>
gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her take a nap.  Moira<br/>
(5 yo) is quite happy to stay up until 1 am, and often does when we have our<br/>
friends over every other weekend for table top gaming.    I am not yet<br/>
unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten, so she has to be up in time to get<br/>
on the bus, which means she has to go to bed by a certain time every night<br/>
to get enough sleep.  I do let them lay in bed reading (or looking at the<br/>
pictures) for as long as they like every night.  Usually they are all asleep<br/>
within an hour.  On weekends I am far more lax.  They get to stay up later<br/>
and they can get up whenever they feel like, but Lauren is predictably up<br/>
between 6 and 6:30 every morning.-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Children are NOT unschooling. So sleep patterns are school-determined. NOT natural.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-My girls could (and have) convince(d) anyone that I starve them within a<br/>
half hour of eating a huge meal.  I feel strongly that family meals are an<br/>
important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for everyone in<br/>
the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a must for<br/>
me. -=-=-=-=-<br/>
Have you asked your children what *they* think? <br/>
Why do you think they aren&#39;t full after a huge meal? Maybe because YOU are <br/>
telling them when they should be full or hungry? <br/>
Samll children have small stomachs. They don&#39;t NEED huge meals!<br/>
You might want to listen to them a bit more.<br/>
-=-=-=- Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad timeframe<br/>
(not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and say they<br/>
are full), and can be eaten pretty much anywhere except upstairs in their<br/>
bedrooms.  I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly about<br/>
good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with<br/>
eating junk food all day.-=-=-=-<br/>
Sandra has pages of &quot;If I let&quot; quotes from moms over the years: Take a look:<br/>
www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling/ifilet<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really important to be able to take a bite and say that you&#39;re full. It REALLY <br/>
is! If you *are*.<br/>
As for &quot;junk&quot;---I keep platters of pears and cheese and grapes and <br/>
carrots and muffins and other wholesome foods within reach all day. I <br/>
also have a big bowl of M&Ms or jelly beans in the den. We have cookies and <br/>
ice cream available all the time. My boys, at nine and 17, are just as <br/>
likely to fix a quesdilla as they are to reach for the chips. Maybe MORE so,<br/>
because they&#39;ve been given that choice for so long and they  know how <br/>
different foods make them feel.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-As for the TV, I let them watch as close to all they want as is reasonable.-=-=-<br/>
Who decides what&#39;s reasonable?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-My husband has shows he likes to watch in the late morning, so after the<br/>
girls have watched 4 hours of TV, it is his turn.  And that is how we view<br/>
it.  Whenever multiple people want to use the same thing but differently,<br/>
they have to take turns and share.  TV is the same way in our house.-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you need more than one tv? That way everyone can be happy and not <br/>
*just* the person with the TV.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-Sometimes, though, I will shut it off and not let anyone watch for a little<br/>
bit because I grew up without a TV and having it on *all* the time drives me<br/>
batty.  I have to have some quiet in the house sometimes.  That is my turn<br/>
with the TV.  :)-=-=-=<br/>
Creepy.<br/>
-=-=-When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>
on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>
then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually playing with<br/>
her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was shocked.  I had<br/>
never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.-=-=-=<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe because your viewing was controlled as a child?<br/>
Our children seem to only watch when there&#39;s something interesting on. <br/>
They regularly turn it off to do other things. Amazing? No. <br/>
Expected when it&#39;s not limited.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-I see my role of parent as being that of provider and protector.  I see a<br/>
lot of emphasis on provider in all the info I have found on unschooling, but<br/>
the protector part seems to be overlooked, at least in what I have found.-=-=-=-<br/>
Right. We&#39;re all out to make sure harm comes to our children. The more <br/>
dangerous, the better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-There is a reason why humans rear their children for roughly two decades,<br/>
instead of leaving them to their own devices from day one like reptiles do.-=-=-<br/>
And now we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices? And being compared to crocodiles????<br/>
How long have you been reading here?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that will cause<br/>
themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the benefit of my<br/>
experience and wisdom. -=-=-=-<br/>
See, I choose to help my children make wiser decisions (and allow them to make <br/>
a few mistakes---which we call learning-takes) NOW rather than have all their <br/>
decisions made FOR them and then turn them loose at 18 with no real handle on <br/>
how to weigh those decisions.<br/>
 -=-=-=-Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>
think of a better way to phrase it right now.-=-=-=-<br/>
Yes, it does. To us AND to your children.<br/>
 -=-=-=-At such a young age, my<br/>
children don&#39;t have the experience or knowledge to make decisions about what<br/>
kinds of food to eat.  The relationship between diet and health is too<br/>
abstract for them right now.  It is easier to relate too much sugar to an<br/>
upset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>
is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day. -=-=-=<br/>
 <br/>
Huh?<br/>
See, I feel that the honest relationship between me and my children is MOST important.<br/>
I trust when they say they&#39;re hungry or when they&#39;re full. <br/>
And cod liver oil every day prevents the flu??? That&#39;s a fact? Call the AMA!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>
because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>
and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t like<br/>
getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have been<br/>
prevented with a simple nap.-=-=-=-<br/>
She&#39;s TWO?  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than that.<br/>
If allowed to learn when she needs sleep, she will nap when she is tired.<br/>
&quot;Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>
and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.&quot;<br/>
This one just makes me sad for that little girl. She gets yelled at for being tired???<br/>
She&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
No. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your children. <br/>
But that has nothing to do with structure.<br/>
 <br/>
You might want to read more about unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, who is usually more forgiving and <br/>
patient on this list. I just got pretty peeved.<br/>

  Children are NOT unschooling. So sleep patterns are school-determined. NOT<br/>

<br/>
  **** My children&#39;s sleep habits were not determined by school until a few<br/>
months ago.  What I described is what happened *before* Moira started<br/>
school.  Also, I am not comfortable going to bed while my children are still<br/>
up and about.  Therefore, I make sure I put them to bed before I go to bed.<br/>
<br/>

metabolisms or they are lying to me.<br/>

  Creepy.<br/>
<br/>
  **** Why is needing some quiet time &quot;creepy&quot;? See, what I have gotten from<br/>
these lists is that children have needs that must be met, but parents don&#39;t.<br/>
Well, I do.  Most of the time, they get their TV on for every waking hour.<br/>
Once a month, if that, I say it stays off for an hour or two.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>
  on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>

<br/>
  **** I don&#39;t consider my TV viewing as having been controlled as a child.<br/>
We didn&#39;t have electricity to run a TV.  I did sometimes watch TV at my<br/>
friends&#39; houses.  It is no different than someone who grew up without pets<br/>
because they had no ability to care for one (for whatever reason).  Was<br/>
their pet situation &quot;controlled&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-I see my role of parent as being that of provider and protector.  I<br/>

  And now we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices? And being compared to<br/>
crocodiles????<br/>
  How long have you been reading here?<br/>
<br/>
  ****  I have been reading here and at UnschoolingDiscussion for nearly a<br/>
month. I have also read some of Sandra Dodd&#39;s articles, but it will take me<br/>
a long time to read them all.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that<br/>

  how to weigh those decisions.<br/>
<br/>
  ****I believe in learning from the mistakes of others so you don&#39;t have to<br/>
repeat them for yourself.  I do also let them make some mistakes as well, as<br/>
experience is a better teacher in some circumstances.  When I do make a<br/>
decision for them, I explain why so that they can learn without the pain of<br/>
the mistake.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>
  think of a better way to phrase it right now.-=-=-=-<br/>

<br/>
  **** The flu shot certainly doesn&#39;t. You avoid the flu by maintaining a<br/>
healthy immune system.  CLO is one way to do that.  Obviously it is not the<br/>
only way, not can it do so all by itself.  But I am not here to discuss<br/>
nutrition.  I used it as an example of a cause-effect relationship that is<br/>
too obscure/subtle for small children to understand by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky<br/>
by 5 or 6 pm<br/>
  because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and<br/>
misbehaves<br/>
  and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t like<br/>

  She&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>
<br/>
  **** No.  Read what I said.  I said she misbehaves and gets yelled at for<br/>
it.  She gets yelled at for hitting her sisters and screaming at us and<br/>
throwing things around the house, not for being tired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  No. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your children.<br/>

  **** I posted this so that you would understand what my thought processes<br/>
are now and show me how and why I should change them.  I certainly did not<br/>
expect this kind of passive aggression.  I have read plenty of posts saying<br/>
that you should never say no to a child because it hinders their learning<br/>
process.  I have not seen any posts about saying no to a child to protect<br/>
them from a danger they don&#39;t understand.  Try as I might I cannot see the<br/>
logic in that.  I wanted more people to explain it to me in the hopes that<br/>
someone else&#39;s POV would help me understand.  I feel like I am being<br/>
attacked for my ignorance and must defend myself.  I hope that that changes.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen MANY posts that suggest making &quot;Yes&quot; the default instead of <br/>
&quot;No,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t preclude ever saying &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The point of trying to say &quot;Yes&quot; more often is that most parents in our <br/>
society automatically say &quot;No&quot; most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Making the default be &quot;Yes&quot; means that parents will say &quot;No&quot; only when <br/>
there is good reason. It doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;No&quot; will never cross their <br/>
lips - but it does mean that they try to find a way to make things work <br/>
out for EVERYBODY, rather than just flat-out saying &quot;No,&quot; if possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709404913">Thank you so much for further explaining that for me.  I remember once my<br/>
dad noticed that he made No the default answer for my brothers, but not for<br/>
me.  I recently (several months ago) noticed that I do the same and have<br/>
been actively trying not to say no if I don&#39;t have a very good reason.  And<br/>
if I do say No, I explain why and try to come up with an alternative.  It is<br/>
a hard mindset to change, though.<br/>

  I&#39;ve never seen a post on the unschooling lists that says &quot;never say no<br/>

<br/>
  I&#39;ve seen MANY posts that suggest making &quot;Yes&quot; the default instead of<br/>
  &quot;No,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t preclude ever saying &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The point of trying to say &quot;Yes&quot; more often is that most parents in our<br/>
  society automatically say &quot;No&quot; most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
  Making the default be &quot;Yes&quot; means that parents will say &quot;No&quot; only when<br/>
  there is good reason. It doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;No&quot; will never cross their<br/>
  lips - but it does mean that they try to find a way to make things work<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174354697">Kelly, first and foremost, I said, &quot;Well, said&quot;.  Alright, oops, my <br/>
mistake, I should have said, &quot;Well, explained&quot;. My bad.<br/>
<br/>
The gal that posted, unsure of her name, is obviously NOT an <br/>
unschooler.  Maybe she hasn&#39;t read much on radically unschooling and <br/>
just jumped in with her views?  Not sure, either way, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
get upset.  You did a wonderful job explaining how REAL unschooling <br/>
is in comparison to how she parents.  Also, maybe she is a Christian <br/>
(but maybe not) which would explain how she might not want her kids <br/>
to watch certain shows.<br/>
<br/>
You made some great points and because I&#39;m about to leave for work, <br/>
I just don&#39;t have time to pick them out word for word like you <br/>
did.   But, I really agree with you!  My kiddos, I feel watch t.v. <br/>
all day.  Cartoons 98% of the time.  The way we as parents get our <br/>
time to watch t.v. (we only have one) is we say, &quot;Alright, now it&#39;s <br/>
mom and dad&#39;s turn to learn something!&quot;  Never once do they <br/>
complain!!<br/>
<br/>
As for the food thing, I was raised with controled meal times.  This <br/>
for me has turned into a weight problem because I always feel I <br/>
should eat when there&#39;s food in front of me, even if I&quot;m not <br/>
hungry.  And, I&#39;m used to eating past full, just to clear my plate.  <br/>
From the get go, we have raised our kids to ask when they are hungry <br/>
for me to feed them.  That snack idea that you do was a great idea.  <br/>
After they are fed, if they only eat two bites, great!!  <br/>
Wonderful!!  I know that I will never have to worry about them <br/>
having the kind of problems in that area that I have.  And, because <br/>
we are unschoolers and HOME with them EACH and everyday, pretty much <br/>
at all time, we technically are eating together as a family all the <br/>
time.  I might be reading while my son is eating lunch but we are <br/>
still eating together aren&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, many more points you made were right on to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Well said!!  :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well said, Judy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maria<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; Well, not exactly.<br/>
&gt; This is a list for those looking to make the leap to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t even come close to helping others understand how <br/>
unschooling works.<br/>
&gt; First of all, the mom who responded doesn&#39;t have a child over age <br/>
five. <br/>
&gt; So, she really isn&#39;t technically an unschooler. Her only &quot;school <br/>
age&quot; child is in<br/>
&gt; kindergarten.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s also assuming the worst of her children from the get-go.  <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s still controlling what they do. She&#39;s assuming that they <br/>
will not<br/>
&gt; chose healthful foods or sleep when they are tired or wake when <br/>
they are rested <br/>
&gt; or ever turn off the tv.<br/>
&gt; Well, let&#39;s look at her points:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with <br/>
my own children.<br/>
&gt; My children are 5 and under.  Their birthdays are in April.  <br/>
Lauren (2 yo)<br/>
&gt; gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her take a <br/>
nap.  Moira<br/>
&gt; (5 yo) is quite happy to stay up until 1 am, and often does when <br/>
we have our<br/>
&gt; friends over every other weekend for table top gaming.    I am not <br/>
yet<br/>
&gt; unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten, so she has to be up in <br/>
time to get<br/>
&gt; on the bus, which means she has to go to bed by a certain time <br/>
every night<br/>
&gt; to get enough sleep.  I do let them lay in bed reading (or looking <br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; pictures) for as long as they like every night.  Usually they are <br/>
all asleep<br/>
&gt; within an hour.  On weekends I am far more lax.  They get to stay <br/>
up later<br/>
&gt; and they can get up whenever they feel like, but Lauren is <br/>
predictably up<br/>
&gt; between 6 and 6:30 every morning.-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Children are NOT unschooling. So sleep patterns are school-<br/>
determined. NOT natural.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-My girls could (and have) convince(d) anyone that I <br/>
starve them within a<br/>
&gt; half hour of eating a huge meal.  I feel strongly that family <br/>
meals are an<br/>
&gt; important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for <br/>
everyone in<br/>
&gt; the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a <br/>
must for<br/>
&gt; me. -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Have you asked your children what *they* think? <br/>
&gt; Why do you think they aren&#39;t full after a huge meal? Maybe because <br/>
YOU are <br/>
&gt; telling them when they should be full or hungry? <br/>
&gt; Samll children have small stomachs. They don&#39;t NEED huge meals!<br/>
&gt; You might want to listen to them a bit more.<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=- Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad <br/>
timeframe<br/>
&gt; (not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and <br/>
say they<br/>
&gt; are full), and can be eaten pretty much anywhere except upstairs <br/>
in their<br/>
&gt; bedrooms.  I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing <br/>
wrong with<br/>
&gt; eating junk food all day.-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Sandra has pages of &quot;If I let&quot; quotes from moms over the years: <br/>
Take a look:<br/>
&gt; www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling/ifilet<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s really important to be able to take a bite and say that <br/>
you&#39;re full. It REALLY <br/>
&gt; is! If you *are*.<br/>
&gt; As for &quot;junk&quot;---I keep platters of pears and cheese and grapes and <br/>
&gt; carrots and muffins and other wholesome foods within reach all <br/>
day. I <br/>
&gt; also have a big bowl of M&Ms or jelly beans in the den. We have <br/>
cookies and <br/>
&gt; ice cream available all the time. My boys, at nine and 17, are <br/>
just as <br/>
&gt; likely to fix a quesdilla as they are to reach for the chips. <br/>
Maybe MORE so,<br/>
&gt; because they&#39;ve been given that choice for so long and they  know <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; different foods make them feel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-As for the TV, I let them watch as close to all they want <br/>
as is reasonable.-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Who decides what&#39;s reasonable?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-My husband has shows he likes to watch in the late morning, <br/>
so after the<br/>
&gt; girls have watched 4 hours of TV, it is his turn.  And that is how <br/>
we view<br/>
&gt; it.  Whenever multiple people want to use the same thing but <br/>
differently,<br/>
&gt; they have to take turns and share.  TV is the same way in our <br/>
house.-=-=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Maybe you need more than one tv? That way everyone can be happy <br/>
and not <br/>
&gt; *just* the person with the TV.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-Sometimes, though, I will shut it off and not let anyone <br/>
watch for a little<br/>
&gt; bit because I grew up without a TV and having it on *all* the time <br/>
drives me<br/>
&gt; batty.  I have to have some quiet in the house sometimes.  That is <br/>
my turn<br/>
&gt; with the TV.  :)-=-=-=<br/>
&gt; Creepy.<br/>
&gt; -=-=-When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>
&gt; on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a <br/>
while,<br/>
&gt; then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually <br/>
playing with<br/>
&gt; her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was <br/>
shocked.  I had<br/>
&gt; never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.-=-=-=<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Maybe because your viewing was controlled as a child?<br/>
&gt; Our children seem to only watch when there&#39;s something interesting <br/>
on. <br/>
&gt; They regularly turn it off to do other things. Amazing? No. <br/>
&gt; Expected when it&#39;s not limited.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-I see my role of parent as being that of provider and <br/>
protector.  I see a<br/>
&gt; lot of emphasis on provider in all the info I have found on <br/>
unschooling, but<br/>
&gt; the protector part seems to be overlooked, at least in what I have <br/>
found.-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Right. We&#39;re all out to make sure harm comes to our children. The <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; dangerous, the better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-There is a reason why humans rear their children for <br/>
roughly two decades,<br/>
&gt; instead of leaving them to their own devices from day one like <br/>
reptiles do.-=-=-<br/>
&gt; And now we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices? And being <br/>
compared to crocodiles????<br/>
&gt; How long have you been reading here?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions <br/>
that will cause<br/>
&gt; themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the <br/>
benefit of my<br/>
&gt; experience and wisdom. -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; See, I choose to help my children make wiser decisions (and allow <br/>
them to make <br/>
&gt; a few mistakes---which we call learning-takes) NOW rather than <br/>
have all their <br/>
&gt; decisions made FOR them and then turn them loose at 18 with no <br/>
real handle on <br/>
&gt; how to weigh those decisions.<br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think of a better way to phrase it right now.-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Yes, it does. To us AND to your children.<br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-At such a young age, my<br/>
&gt; children don&#39;t have the experience or knowledge to make decisions <br/>
about what<br/>
&gt; kinds of food to eat.  The relationship between diet and health is <br/>
too<br/>
&gt; abstract for them right now.  It is easier to relate too much <br/>
sugar to an<br/>
&gt; upset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the <br/>
flu that<br/>
&gt; is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every <br/>
day. -=-=-=<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Huh?<br/>
&gt; See, I feel that the honest relationship between me and my <br/>
children is MOST important.<br/>
&gt; I trust when they say they&#39;re hungry or when they&#39;re full. <br/>
&gt; And cod liver oil every day prevents the flu??? That&#39;s a fact? <br/>
Call the AMA!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets <br/>
cranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>
&gt; because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and <br/>
misbehaves<br/>
&gt; and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
like<br/>
&gt; getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; prevented with a simple nap.-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s TWO?  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than that.<br/>
&gt; If allowed to learn when she needs sleep, she will nap when she is <br/>
tired.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>
&gt; and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.&quot;<br/>
&gt; This one just makes me sad for that little girl. She gets yelled <br/>
at for being tired???<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; No. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your <br/>
children. <br/>
&gt; But that has nothing to do with structure.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You might want to read more about unschooling.<br/>

&gt; patient on this list. I just got pretty peeved.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hear tons of what is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. I think because it&#39;s easy to explain how to stop making <br/>
kids eat their dinner. But what it&#39;s replaced with isn&#39;t another action <br/>
like making them a peanut butter sandwich. It&#39;s replaced with a whole <br/>
philosophy that will help you figure out what to do with your <br/>
particular children.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of learning to trust that kids understand their needs <br/>
better than we do. It&#39;s a matter of learning that many of the things we <br/>
think are right and important to make them do or stop them from doing <br/>
are what are causing them to act as though they can&#39;t be trusted.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting is oriented towards molding kids into what we <br/>
want them to be. Presumably we want good things for them! Like being <br/>
kind, learned, honest, safe. But to get those good things conventional <br/>
parenting methods put huge strains on the relationship between parent <br/>
and child. And we accept that the strain is normal and natural. It&#39;s <br/>
not uncommon for a conventional parent to say something to the effect <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t care whether you like me or not. It&#39;s not my job to be liked. <br/>
I want you to get up and do your homework.&quot; Or be in before midnight. <br/>
Or stop listening to that raunchy music. Not being liked sometimes, <br/>
making kids cry, making them really pissed off at us on occasion seems <br/>
to be part of the price we need to pay to raise good kids.<br/>
<br/>
But what if unschoolers said the bad parts weren&#39;t necessary? What if <br/>
unschoolers said they had kids who were kind, learned, honest and safe <br/>
and all the other good stuff we want but it was accomplished without <br/>
control and without the subsequent fights against the control?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people would immediately come up with all sorts of scenarios <br/>
where kids need forced and assume we&#39;re sacrificing our kids health and <br/>
safety to avoid making them mad.<br/>
<br/>
But that isn&#39;t so.<br/>
<br/>
The first step is to turn off the voice in your head that says &quot;That <br/>
can&#39;t possibly work,&quot; and ask questions as though it did work. :-) <br/>
Rather than assuming that kids won&#39;t eat, won&#39;t brush their teeth, <br/>
won&#39;t turn off the TV, won&#39;t sleep assume that they do and ask how. <br/>
Rather than assuming that it works for us because our kids are <br/>
naturally good and naturally do all the right things, assume we have <br/>
regular kids who would behave as yours do if they were controlled. <br/>
Rather than assuming kids need protected from various things, ask how <br/>
we help them be safe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I know that I can&#39;t be doing too<br/>
&gt; much wrong because everyone tells me what wonderful, happy children I <br/>
&gt; have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if something seems to be working people will rarely see a need to <br/>
change!<br/>
<br/>
But lots of time we&#39;ve learned to accept the bad parts of what we&#39;re <br/>
doing as just the way things need to be so we don&#39;t notice the bad <br/>
parts. Parents accept that kids will be mad at them and will be sad. It <br/>
seems justified that a little anger and sadness is the price they and <br/>
we need to pay for something we know is even better.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
And we assure ourselves they&#39;ll get over their upsetness.<br/>
<br/>
But in reality every time we pull the &quot;I know what&#39;s best for you card&quot; <br/>
on them, we chip away at the relationship between us. And the more we <br/>
chip, the wider the gap between us becomes. Chipping away at the <br/>
relationship is like whacking a big tree with an ax. The stronger the <br/>
tree, the less likely it will break. But the ax damages the tree even <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t fall and even if the wounds heal over. The difference, of <br/>
course, is that we can&#39;t always see the damage that we&#39;ve done to <br/>
children. We may only realize it when they&#39;re teens and they aren&#39;t <br/>
speaking to us or as adults when they move far far away. And even then <br/>
when we did everything we were &quot;supposed&quot; to, it&#39;s more likely we&#39;ll <br/>
blame them as being bad or ungrateful than that we&#39;ll see how we pushed <br/>
them away.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once characterized relationships like deposits and withdrawals. <br/>
Every time we do something that builds a closer relationship it&#39;s a <br/>
deposit. Every time we do something deliberately -- even if it feels <br/>
justified -- to hurt them, it&#39;s a withdrawal. If we extend the <br/>
principles of unschooling -- trust and respect -- into parenting we can <br/>
minimize the withdrawals and actively work at the deposits. And not <br/>
only do we end up with great kids but we end up with a stronger <br/>
relationship with them.<br/>

A big part of unschooling is trusting kids. Their tastes are different. <br/>
Their needs are different. Sometimes they&#39;ll tell us things that don&#39;t <br/>
seem to make sense, like they&#39;re hungry 10 minutes after they&#39;ve eaten. <br/>
But if we learn to trust them and respond with respect, the more <br/>
they&#39;ll learn about themselves and the more we&#39;ll learn about who they <br/>
are and the better we can help them.<br/>
<br/>
When she was little, my daughter used to eat just about anything. When <br/>
she was about 4 her tastes started shutting down. There were just a few <br/>
foods that she&#39;d eat and she&#39;d get tired of those. And then when she <br/>
was 11 her tastes started opening up again and now at 13 she&#39;ll try <br/>
just about anything and eats a wide variety of foods. The change wasn&#39;t <br/>
because I made her eat a wide variety. It was just body chemistry. It <br/>
was like for 9 years she lived in a world where nearly everything <br/>
tasted like liver and she hated liver. And having people get frustrated <br/>
with her for not enjoying a wider range of foods didn&#39;t make the liver <br/>
taste wonderful. It was just a life of liver *and* frustrated people.<br/>
<br/>
When we treat kids as though their problems were deliberate attempts to <br/>
make our lives more difficult we add frustration and uncaring to a <br/>
problem they are struggling with and have no idea how to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we can&#39;t solve their problems. But the least we can do is be <br/>
sympathetic and try to see what life is like living as they do with the <br/>
needs and lack of skills and lack of control that they do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you help your children recognize when they need sleep?  From <br/>
&gt; birth<br/>
&gt; mine have all refused to acknowledge that they are tired even as their <br/>
&gt; eyes<br/>
&gt; droop and their heads fall.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perfectly normal :-) Even for adults. If there&#39;s something really <br/>
exciting going on adults will fight off sleep too. And for little kids <br/>
life is exciting so they don&#39;t want to miss a moment. But they don&#39;t <br/>
want to be tired either.<br/>
<br/>
So you ease them into winding down.  Find a routine they find soothing <br/>
and begin that when you notice they&#39;re getting tired. (Not to the point <br/>
of being too wound up to wind down.) For instance turn the lights down <br/>
lower. Put on soft music or story tape. Rock with them. Read to them. <br/>
Do calming things that will relax them. Hold them and talk about their <br/>
day and about tomorrow. Have a family bed. Tell them stories. Set up <br/>
the environment so it feels like they won&#39;t be missing out on things if <br/>
they go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a specific thing to do that will work for all kids. The <br/>
goal is to associate pleasant things with going to bed. If bedtime is a <br/>
negative thing, a time of fighting against control to be in bed at a <br/>
specific time, fighting against being separated from their parents, <br/>
they&#39;ll fight even harder. Against both being controlled and against <br/>
the unpleasant associations with going to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe none of those will work with your kids. Which is why it&#39;s hard to <br/>
tell someone what to do instead. But when you&#39;re committed to helping <br/>
them get what they want, when you understand that they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
make your life more difficult, you will want to do what you can to help <br/>
them find ways to be peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I set a time for them because they haven&#39;t shown me that they<br/>
&gt; will sleep for themselves.  Sometimes Lauren does come to me and ask <br/>
&gt; me for<br/>
&gt; a nap.  She has probably done that twice ever and she will be 3 in <br/>
&gt; April.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because you&#39;re focusing on what you want her to do rather than <br/>
helping her get what she wants. The hard part is they can seem like the <br/>
same thing but when a parent decides a child needs to sleep, to the <br/>
child it doesn&#39;t feel like the same thing at all.<br/>
<br/>
What if you got tired in the middle of the afternoon and your husband <br/>
got irritated with you mentioning it so decided you had to take a nap <br/>
at 3 everyday? Would it feel like he was helping you? Or would it feel <br/>
like he was just trying to get rid of an annoying problem?<br/>
<br/>
Being made to do something, even something that someone thinks is right <br/>
for us, is maddening whether we&#39;re children or adults. And children <br/>
have the same feelings of anger and irritation that adults do when <br/>
they&#39;re treated like that. And yet we think kids are good when they do <br/>
what others think is right for them but adults with that same trait are <br/>
wimps.<br/>
<br/>
What if, instead, your husband took the kids out in the afternoon? Or <br/>
let you sleep in in the morning? Or brought you a cup of your favorite <br/>
hot beverage while he played with the kids?<br/>
<br/>
When we identify the problem and impose a solution on it, then <br/>
implementing the solution then becomes a problem. The problem is no <br/>
longer a tired child but making someone take a nap.<br/>
<br/>
*BUT* I wouldn&#39;t recommend starting letting go of control with sleep <br/>
issues! Start with something easier like food issues ;-) Whenever we <br/>
let go of controls, kids -- adults too! -- tend to try to grab as much <br/>
of what was controlled as they can get, fearing the controls will <br/>
return. So adjusting to new sleeping arrangements can put convictions <br/>
to the test. Which is why people recommend saying yes more rather than <br/>
telling kids there&#39;s no more set bedtimes. Once you&#39;re committed to <br/>
honoring and respecting and trusting your children, it will be worth <br/>
going through the transition from strict bedtimes to helping them get <br/>
to sleep when they&#39;re tired.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256156548">I do have bedtime routine at my house.  It starts after dinner, usually<br/>
sometime between 7 and 7:30.  We brush their teeth, brush their hair and<br/>
they all go potty.  They say goodnight to Daddy and we go upstairs and put<br/>
on pajamas and finish picking up their rooms.  We read a story (they<br/>
routinely fight over whose turn it is to pick the story) then they each go<br/>
to their own rooms and get in bed.  I sing them each their own lullaby and<br/>
tuck them in.  I leave the hallway light on for them and they have a pile of<br/>
books on their beds (which we change out every so often) that they may<br/>
browse through until they are ready to fall asleep.  We do a modified<br/>
version of this for naps (just a story and song) and nearly every time that<br/>
Lauren decides she is going to kick and scream and thrash to not take a nap,<br/>
simply asking her if she wants to go upstairs and read a story is enough to<br/>
calm her down and go willingly to her nap.  Do you consider that to be<br/>
control/coersion?  Is there a better way I can do this?  Should I even worry<br/>
about it until summer when I don&#39;t feel pressured to make sure they are up<br/>
at a certain time?<br/>

Just because YOU believe that doesn&#39;t make it the answer for others <br/>

think that they won&#39;t do it because XYZ happened.  Not the case for <br/>
many many other people.  Everyone&#39;s learning styles are different and <br/>
there are some things that can&#39;t be understood with words from others, <br/>

understanding can take place.  And maybe a mistake for you isn&#39;t a <br/>

<br/>
Being tired is the cause and those are all things that are the affect <br/>
of being tired.  Yelling at her doesn&#39;t help to center her, to connect <br/>
with her, to help her wind down and relax and breathe.  My DD (4 last <br/>
week) is easily overwhelmed when she&#39;s sleepy.  She gets cranky and <br/>
needs her space and time to herself.  If her needs aren&#39;t being met <br/>
then she does yell and scream and cry.  She may hit her brother (5) if <br/>
he won&#39;t listen to her saying &quot;get away from me!&quot;.  That&#39;s my cue to <br/>
step in and try to redirect DS to another activity while letting him <br/>
know that sister needs some space and quiet because she&#39;s sleepy.  I <br/>
pick her up and hold her.  Comfort her.  Lay down with her if she wants <br/>
to.  It might be more tricky since you have more children than me (2) <br/>
but the point is to BE the provider of comfort and calm.  Not the one <br/>
adding to the chaos and upset.  :)<br/>

And it&#39;s not generally recommended that you make an announcement <br/>

Just start by saying &quot;yes&quot; more.  DD gets home from school at 4pm . . . <br/>

her to ask at all -- just offer a snack and a smile.  And if you don&#39;t <br/>

to cheerfully reply &quot;Yes, baby, what can I get for you?&quot;  :)<br/>

Start by saying &quot;yes&quot; more as you loosen your controls on eating and <br/>

It&#39;s sometimes hard to get naps in when you have younger children that <br/>
are pretty close in age.  Mine are 20 months apart and often one would <br/>
be sleepy and the other one would want to bang pans together instead.  <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
When my children were smaller and they obviously were tired but they <br/>
were &quot;fighting it&quot; I might get the stroller out and take them for a <br/>
walk and they&#39;d usually conk out for a while.  If the weather wasn&#39;t <br/>
ideal or I just didn&#39;t feel like walking *S* I&#39;d get us all into the <br/>
car and just go for a drive.  I&#39;d usually set out to drive along the <br/>
waterfront or to a park across town or somewhere pleasant to look at.  <br/>
Nine times out of ten they&#39;d take a nap.  I&#39;d bring a drink and a snack <br/>
for everyone and also a book or magazine for myself because once they <br/>
were good and asleep I&#39;d stop at a park and read while they slept.<br/>
<br/>
It was refreshing just to get out of the house and have a get of <br/>
scenery even if nobody fell asleep on our outing.  Maybe that&#39;s <br/>
something that would work for you, too.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683882110">&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have bedtime routine at my house. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think most families with small children do.  I have 5 kids, 3 <br/>
within 3 years of each other and they share bedrooms.  We have to <br/>
have some kind of routine because the kids have trouble remembering <br/>
not to be too loud or too rambunctious to not wake the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a difference between routine and absolute rules.  I <br/>
know families where the kids are in bed by 8:00 no matter what.  My <br/>
younger ones are usually in bed by 9:00 but not if they have a tv <br/>
show they really want to watch or we have company or they fell <br/>
asleep at dinnertime or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is looking at the situation and working with <br/>
what is really happening.  My now 5yo gets really cranky by supper <br/>
time.  She would cry and whine about every real or imagined slight.  <br/>
So I looked at things that helped her sleep and suggested those or <br/>
got those moving during the afternoon.  Example:  she loves to sleep <br/>
in my bed so I might suggest if she wanted to  take her blanket into <br/>
my room and listen to the radio since she seemed tired.  She loves <br/>
to cuddle with her oldest sister so I would ask her if she wanted to <br/>
watch a movie with Adriane (after I had already checked with <br/>
Adriane).  She would happily drift off to sleep and the entire house <br/>
was happier.  If all else fails, I would do reflexology on her feet <br/>
and off she goes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812913834">Okay.  I just let my 2yo have 2 snacks!  She asked me for snack at 9:50 and<br/>
I said sure (ten minutes before &quot;snacktime&quot;).  I gave her her leftover ice<br/>
cream from yesterday.  Then she came and asked for a second snack.  I said<br/>
okay.  I offered her a sandwich, which she said yes to, but in the process<br/>
it morphed from a ham and cheese sandwich to just two slices of ham rolled<br/>
up.  We are all out of cheese, so I offered her a ham only sandwich.  Then I<br/>
asked if she wanted one slice of bread or two and she said she wanted the<br/>
ham rolled up.  She then declined any bread at all.  She seems satisfied<br/>
with that because she hasn&#39;t asked for anything else to eat yet.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, one reason I really want to do this is because I see what a<br/>
difference EC has made in my babies&#39; lives.  EC is elimination<br/>
communication, basically learning when your baby needs to go potty and<br/>
taking them instead of putting them in diapers all day.  Lauren took over<br/>
her own potty needs around 18 months old, and I am successful with Rowan<br/>
about half of the time now.  They both get to run around naked at home all<br/>
they want and I have started taking Rowan out on short trips without a<br/>
diaper.  I first started it to save money on diapers, but then I saw that<br/>
they were happier without diapers and realized that not paying attention and<br/>
making them sit in wet or messy diapers really is cruel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176528066">Thank you for the apology.  I was stunned at the tone and I&#39;m afraid I went<br/>
to bed crying last night.  The first thing I did this morning was to come<br/>
and see what others had to say.  I was so relieved to see a different tone<br/>
in the inbox.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter mostly enjoys going to kindergarten.  Before kindergarten she<br/>
had no friends.  I am a bit of a homebody and we don&#39;t have neighbors, just<br/>
businesses all aroud us.  I have always wanted to homeschool.  I saw my<br/>
brothers both get coded and lost in the school system until they dropped<br/>
out.  I am continuously learning more horrifying things about the public<br/>
school system, like the fact that 2/3 of high school graduates are not able<br/>
to pass the GED.  Also, at the time I was working and couldn&#39;t stay home to<br/>
homeschool her.  I felt that kindergarten was harmless enough and would give<br/>
her some social contacts that I had failed to give her.  She has been<br/>
wanting to go to school ever since her older (half-) sister started school.<br/>
My oldest lives with her dad and we have her most weekends and for summer<br/>
vacation.  She is 8 and in 3rd grade.  I want to let Moira finish out the<br/>
school year (it&#39;s only three more months) since she does seem to enjoy<br/>
going, some days more so than others.  It will also make it easier to deal<br/>
with the SAU if we start between school years rather than in the middle.<br/>

Okay.  I just let my 2yo have 2 snacks!  She asked me for snack at 9:50 <br/>
and<br/>
I said sure (ten minutes before &quot;snacktime&quot;).  I gave her her leftover <br/>
ice<br/>
cream from yesterday.  Then she came and asked for a second snack.  I <br/>
said<br/>
okay.  I offered her a sandwich, which she said yes to, but in the <br/>
process<br/>
it morphed from a ham and cheese sandwich to just two slices of ham <br/>
rolled<br/>
up.  We are all out of cheese, so I offered her a ham only sandwich.  <br/>
Then I<br/>
asked if she wanted one slice of bread or two and she said she wanted <br/>
the<br/>
ham rolled up.  She then declined any bread at all.  She seems satisfied<br/>
with that because she hasn&#39;t asked for anything else to eat yet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Judy, I&#39;m so happy for you guys!  That wasn&#39;t too hard was it?  :)  <br/>
She&#39;s happy; you&#39;re happy.  Life is good!<br/>

I first started it to save money on private school, but then I saw that<br/>
they were happier without tests and grading and school and realized that <br/>
not paying attention to them and<br/>
making them sit in a small classroom all day with a bunch of strangers really is cruel.<br/>

I first started it to save money on food, but then I saw that<br/>
they were happier without scheduled mealtimes and realized that not paying attention<br/>
to their bodies and their own hunger pangs and<br/>
making them sit and finish a meal or sit and wait for a snack really is cruel.<br/>
Parents can be incredibly cruel without thinking about it.<br/>
 <br/>
A HUGE part of unschooling is questioning WHY we do/say something. <br/>
Thinking about how and why is the basis for our parenting and unschooling.<br/>

The difference between what you&#39;re describing and a more unschooling <br/>

Thank you for the apology.  I was stunned at the tone and I&#39;m afraid I went<br/>

You&#39;re welcome. <br/>
We started this group to give folks a place to ask VERY basic unschooling questions, <br/>
but I still get peeved. I also sometimes forget which list I&#39;m on when I write! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m supposed to be NICE here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Have you asked HER what *she* wants to do? <br/>
You could make school optional. It&#39;s only kindergarten after all! And not complusory.<br/>
You could make her days home much more attractive than her days at school, so she <br/>
will *want* to stay home with you next year!<br/>

What&#39;s an SAU?<br/>
She will KNOW you value her opinion if you let her in on the decision-making!<br/>
And pulling her out in the middle makes you both look and feel more powerful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569120764">Yes, my husband is home all day.  At least for now.  He is a landscaper and<br/>
the season hasn&#39;t started here yet.  He is hoping to be back to work in a<br/>
month or so.  I generally try to get dinner on the table between 6 and 6:30.<br/>
I spoke to DH this morning after reading here some and he is okay with my<br/>
moving dinner to 4ish, so I will start doing that.  I hope that will give<br/>
more evening relaxation time so that they will naturally wind down.  But I<br/>

many decisions regarding my children the more I started <br/>
understanding what all these seasoned moms were talking about.  I <br/>
think that Kelly was trying to point out how UNunschooling many of <br/>
your thoughts and actions are.  Lauren&#39;s napping was one way that I <br/>
100% agree with her.  Your yelling at Lauren for hitting her sister <br/>
is based in her not having a nap.  If she were well rested she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be cranky and irritable and hitting her sister.  So in a <br/>
sense her being punished for hitting her sister is really being <br/>
punished for not getting a nap.  It&#39;s all interconnected.  And you <br/>
might be surprised that Lauren is viewing it the same way, <br/>
especially if you say things like, &quot;If you had taken your nap.....&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you will stay around and read more (and ask more) and take <br/>
the big dive into the unschooling pond.  Your household may seem <br/>
chaotic at first, but in time it will settle down into a sort of <br/>
chaord that is well grooved with your family.<br/>

A big part of making the whole unschooling food thing work is changing your<br/>
attitude about food.  If you are thinking, &quot;Ack, she is snacking again&quot; it<br/>
isn&#39;t going to make the transition any easier.  What food is she snacking<br/>
on?  Can you keep easy to prepare healthy foods available for her to eat<br/>
when she pleases without thinking, &quot;Ack, she is snacking again.&quot;  Why does<br/>
it matter if she eats her food in many small meals (snacks, which is more<br/>
natural) or in larger meals at a selected dinner time?  <br/>
