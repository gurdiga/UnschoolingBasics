<div id="ygrps-yiv-979776331">I am posting this for any of you with an interest in taking a survey.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not about unschooling---just check out the questions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But if you&#39;d like to contribute to her study...<br/>

<br/>
I am a home schooling parent completing a graduate degree in School<br/>
Psychology from the Citadel. I plan to work with home-schooling <br/>
families. My<br/>
research thesis is on reasons families choose to home-school and the<br/>
needs/concerns they have. I will be sharing the results of my research <br/>
with<br/>
teachers and school psychologists, helping them to better understand the<br/>
home schooling population.<br/>
<br/>
I am requesting your help with my research. I have a short survey posted<br/>
on-line at   www.survey.chriswogamon.com  . Would you be willing to <br/>
inform your<br/>
members about the survey and provide a link to it either through your<br/>
newsletter or an email message. They will not be asked to identify<br/>
themselves by name and can submit the survey either electronically or <br/>
via<br/>
mail. If you would be willing to help with this project, please let me <br/>
know<br/>
how many members you have and how you will be sharing this with them. I <br/>
can<br/>
provide an announcement that can be put in your newsletter or sent via<br/>
email. Your help is greatly appreciated.<br/>

  One of the questions was something like &quot;under what circumstances would you send your kids to school?&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I answered:<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;If hell froze over?  lol<br/>
   <br/>
  We would live in a tent before sending our kids to school.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  It seemed to me she was looking for ideas to change the public schools so that people wouldn&#39;t want to homeschool.<br/>

I filled one of these surveys out for a local college student. I actually<br/>
got to meet her once [Great story! She&#39;s the one who found Hannah&#39;s urn in<br/>
her new home and called to return it to me. We had a great talk about my<br/>
unconventional lifestyle philosophy] -- she remembered my form because my<br/>
answers were all over the margins instead of a simple *fill in the bubble*<br/>
-- though fascinating, she thought, I didn&#39;t much contribute to the ideals<br/>
she continues to hold about what homeSCHOOLING looks like and why folks do<br/>
it. I was just glad to have a follow-up with her so she could see<br/>
UNschooling in action and the Real Life benefits.<br/>

   One of the questions was something like &quot;under what circumstances <br/>
would you<br/>
send your kids to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I answered:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;If hell froze over?  lol<br/>
  We would live in a tent before sending our kids to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I wrote &quot;Only if he would want to and only if I couldn&#39;t come up <br/>
with a btter alternative that would suit him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   It seemed to me she was looking for ideas to change the public <br/>
schools so that<br/>
people wouldn&#39;t want to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to her on the phone. She&#39;s homeschooling her own kids, and my <br/>
impression was that she wasn&#39;t planning to send her kids, even if they <br/>
improved. Her goal seemed to be how to get the schools to adapt their <br/>
plans to include homeschoolers in extracurricular.<br/>
<br/>
Under &quot;What would the schools have to do to get you to put your child <br/>
in school?&quot; I wrote, &quot;Eliminate compulsory attendance. Eliminate <br/>
testing and grading.<br/>
Eliminate age segregation.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
