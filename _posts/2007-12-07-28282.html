<div id="ygrps-yiv-83019691">I just wanted to share.  My 8 year old DS was in the kitchen <br/>
baking and I was helping him convert fractions so he could figure out <br/>
the right measurments. He got all excited and said &quot;I get it now, you <br/>
go to school to learn how do things but when you unschool you learn by <br/>
just doing those things&quot; I think he does get it and I would like to <br/>
say, he is turning into quite the little chef.<br/>
<br/>
      <br/>
      Then later that night we were watching C.S.I. Miami, his new fave <br/>
and they mentioned something about the cuban missile crisis. I then was <br/>
able give him an overview, which he was totally interested and it <br/>
seemed to be just the right amount of information.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Sometimes we take big steps forward and some days we take huge <br/>
steps back, but it helps knowing I am at least on the right path.</div>
