<div id="ygrps-yiv-636066041">Hi.  I introduced myself, but have not had a question til now.  I <br/>
know you all cover many, many topics in this group, but I have a <br/>
specific one for my situation.  Thanks for reading...<br/>
<br/>
We are a family of four kids, myself, and my husband.  We have for my <br/>
years now, been very &#39;mainstream&#39; in our parenting..ie, <br/>
punishment/reward system, public school, curriculum based <br/>
homeschooling, etc.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  I found <br/>
out about unschooling as regards to a method for *learning* and fell <br/>
hard and fast for it, really feeling in my heart like it was how it <br/>
should have been all along.  More recently, I have began reading and <br/>
learning more about unschooling as a &#39;lifestyle&#39;....ie, respect, <br/>
bedtimes, etc.  I had a hard time swallowing the *no bedtime* <br/>
suggestion.  <br/>
<br/>
The other evening, though, I decided I would try it. Let the kids <br/>
decide when they go to bed. (Now, I don&#39;t know if I went about this <br/>
all wrong, and I hope you can tell me otherwise if I &#39;messed up&#39;) <br/>
They were thrilled.  They range in age from 5-10 and I stayed up with <br/>
them.  We had a great time.  We dug in my scrap box of fabric, picked <br/>
out fabric, hand-sewed a little, watched a movie.  Finally, at 3:30 <br/>
am, I was sooooooo exhausted, I had to go to bed. (I get up every <br/>
morning at 5:30 am because I have an online business, and I work on <br/>
my craft and business at that time, before the kids are up, so I can <br/>
spend the rest of the day with them.) So I told them we had to go <br/>
ahead and go to bed.  They were half asleep and were not happy about <br/>
going to bed at 3:30am.  Should I have let them stay up while I went <br/>
to bed?  They are only 5,6,7 and 10, and I was afraid for their <br/>
safety, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we told my husband about them staying up late and decided he <br/>
did not like the fact I was &quot;letting them do as they please&quot;, etc.  <br/>
It has caused problems in our relationship and I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
explain it to him, or how to &#39;get him on board&#39;.  He is very <br/>
traditional in his parenting &#39;skills&#39;... which from what I am <br/>
learning, we have BOTH been way off on our &#39;skills&#39;.  I am trying to <br/>
do better as a parent, but I don&#39;t know how to handle that he won&#39;t <br/>
listen to me about what I am trying to do. I caved in and for the <br/>
past few nights have been putting them to bed at a &#39;decent&#39; hour, and <br/>
it has been hell here.  They were instantly in great moods and even <br/>
*gasp* getting along better just from that one night..(although my <br/>
follow-through with it failed.) Now, they are confused because I seem <br/>
to be vascilating (sp?) back and forth. <br/>
<br/>
I tried talking to my mother (who is normally very open-minded) and <br/>
she thinks the techniques for living this way will result in (and I <br/>
quote) &#39;panty-waist kids who think they are entitled to every little <br/>
whim&#39;.  Well.. it ticked me off and I feel very frustrated and quite <br/>
lonely right now.  If someone has any suggestions, it would be <br/>
appreciated.  Thanks sooo much.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487775089">I wanted to share this article that helped me a bit with my DH.<br/>

<br/>
About bedtime.. I refuse to be the bedtime police.  If HE wants them <br/>
to be in bed at X hour, HE can give them their baths an hour before, <br/>
read them their stories and lay down with them to get them to go to <br/>
sleep.  Most of the time he doesn&#39;t want to do that or he&#39;s working, <br/>
so he&#39;s not home and they stay up.  (But my kids are 2 and 4 and co-<br/>
sleep so I don&#39;t know how helpful that is for you!)<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you! Its not an easy path this unschooling stuff!  I <br/>
don&#39;t &#39;talk&#39; to my mother or MIL about these things anymore.. I find <br/>
that its easier for me to talk about all the positive and none of the <br/>
negative- that stuff is saved for my online friends. ;) Someone said <br/>
it before, but if you care very much what other people think, this <br/>
journey will be more difficult. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610271424">Hi Amanda,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes used to be an issue for us too. I am tired at night. Like <br/>
you I start out early and I am worn out by ten pm. Dh also works <br/>
early and hard.<br/>
<br/>
What has evolved for us were some guidelines around mutual respect. I <br/>
do not tell the kids to go to bed. We do however have a quiet time. <br/>
When folks start going to bed it is time to respect that and have a <br/>
mellower time. My younger kids head to their bedrooms. They can draw, <br/>
surf the net, read, watch tv, play whatever just quietly. With the <br/>
younger ones I have suggested snacks they can have if hungry and I am <br/>
asleep. I keep them available.The older kids just respect our sleep <br/>
time in the same way I respect theirs. I wait for loud activities <br/>
until everyone is moving. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I really started thinking about bedtimes and considered if my dh <br/>
or someone else sent me to bed, told me I had to sleep. It felt very <br/>
very disrespectful. <br/>
<br/>
Now my kids have just finished swim team and during meets and early <br/>
practice I may remind them that we have to be up at six am to get to <br/>
our destination for swimming. But I do not tell them to go to sleep. <br/>
lol. Saturday my two oldest at home came home from the state meet and <br/>
were in bed by nine. <br/>
<br/>
As far as dh, it sometimes does take longer for dhs to get on board. <br/>
We do not all run on the same schedule as far as our unschooling <br/>
curve..lol. But unschooling does not mean kids do whatever whenever. <br/>
It means we are partnering with them in exploring the world in a way <br/>
they find interesting. It means we are respecting them and helping <br/>
them meet their needs. <br/>
<br/>
In my experience unschooled kids are not panty waists but extremely <br/>
independent, articulate, and self confident. I think honoring who <br/>
they are is the same gift I give myself today. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408809762">So...in your family, what is unschooling looking like right now?  <br/>
Because it is all intertwined...If kids are restricted in other ways  <br/>
and given freedom in only one or two ways, then they will probably  <br/>
choose to exercise that freedom to the extreme. Not to mention, that  <br/>
the first times they are given freedom, they are going to stretch  <br/>
much further than they are even happy with, because of the need to be  <br/>
autonomous.<br/>
<br/>
It took my older children more than a year to get to a point where  <br/>
they could admit their exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how you approached this also. Did you just announce,  <br/>
that tonight they could stay up as late as they want? Because that  <br/>
would not have worked for us when we started unschooling. We would  <br/>
have gotten exactly what you got, and sick kids on top of that (I  <br/>
don&#39;t know why, but if Josh gets sleep deprived, he throws up)  I can  <br/>
only imagine that they were so tired at that point they were even  <br/>
more outraged when you &#39;changed&#39; your mind and sent them to bed.<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, what I would have done was maybe extend bedtime for a  <br/>
few weeks. Instead of say, 9pm, make it 10 or 11pm. Use that time to  <br/>
play and sew and craft. Then at that time ask about baths, snuggles,  <br/>
stories. Also, if they were already laying around watching a movie, I  <br/>
probably would have just covered them with blankets and said, I&#39;m  <br/>
going to bed, I&#39;ll see you in the morning. My five year old is  <br/>
probably the best for leaving alone...he knows the expectations: We  <br/>
don&#39;t go outside, we play quietly while others are sleeping, no  <br/>
cooking without mom. I have a snack tray that I refill at about 9pm  <br/>
so that they can help themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts off the top of my head. Hope it helps some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237447621"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The other evening, though, I decided I would try it. Let the kids <br/>
&gt; decide when they go to bed.<br/>
&gt; They range in age from 5-10 and I stayed up with them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First thing you need to remember is if you are removing a limitation <br/>
or restriction, it will seem like a piece of heaven and the kids will <br/>
do it as much as they can.  They aren&#39;t really sure if you mean the <br/>
removal to be forever so they are going to go all out just in case <br/>
it&#39;s pulled away from them.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to keep in mind is that everyone&#39;s sleep needs may be <br/>
different.  If you can&#39;t stay up super late because of an early <br/>
morning  committment, then you need to explain that to the kids.  <br/>
That is real life learning and you&#39;re modeling life for them.  If <br/>
they choose to stay up late, the family needs to work together to <br/>
meet everyone&#39;s needs without disrespecting other family members.  <br/>
<br/>
In our home, the working parent is Dad (my husband).  He likes to go <br/>
to bed around 10:30pm.  When he goes to bed, the rest of us do quiet <br/>
things so as not to disturb his sleep.  We can still watch tv, play <br/>
games together, read, be on the internet, etc.  Sometimes I go to bed <br/>
around 11pm because I just can&#39;t keep my eyes open.  My kids can stay <br/>
up, doing the same quiet things as when I&#39;m awake.  When we let go of <br/>
bedtimes, it did seem like we were having a slumber party every <br/>
night.  The kids were so excited at being awake past bedtime!  But <br/>
over time, the thrill has gone away and now we just do our own things <br/>
and sleep when we feel ready to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
We have also had to be creative to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  Sometimes <br/>
my kids want to stay up watching tv but they were uncomfortable in <br/>
the living room alone.  They have a tv, computer and video game <br/>
system in their room along with their toys, books and collections.  <br/>
<br/>
Explaining unschooling to an unsupportive family member can be <br/>
tricky.  That might be best discussed as a separate topic, maybe even <br/>
by separating concerns.  Your husband really needs to be on board <br/>
with the parenting style or your relationship can have problems which <br/>
will also affect the children.  You might want to try slowing down <br/>
the transition into total life unschooling.  Read about it and <br/>
discuss it with your husband.  He&#39;ll be working through his own <br/>
issues just like you&#39;re having to face and work through your own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928619517">Thanks to all of you who responded.  Unschooling right now really only covers our &#39;learning&#39;.  We still have restrictions on everyday life, I don&#39;t spend near enough time interacting with my kids, I am trying to balance helping to make a living, spending time with my husband and children, etc.  I *soooooooooo* appreciate the advice you all have given to me.  It&#39;s so hard when you know deeeeeep down that living a certain way is going to be the very best for your family, but I have felt lost in the transitioning..  I like the idea of taking it slow.  I read and am learning all I can about living life this way, and it&#39;s like I can see the other side, I want to get there as quickly as possible, but I do have to take it slower and help everyone, including myself, with the changes happening.<br/>
 You are absolutely right in saying the children were not sure if being able to stay up late was going to be taken away from them, and they were taking it to extreme.... and then I reinforced the fact that it was taken away, so we are in chaos once again.  I see now where I slipped up and I truly appreciate what you all have suggested.  Thank you so much.  I can now move on, instead of beating myself up about what I have done wrong.  <br/>
Peace and Love to all~Amanda<br/>

&gt; but one DH is against it and two once DH goes to bed how do I make  <br/>
&gt; sure the<br/>
&gt; house looks close to what it looked like when I went to bed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A shift in perception (like you did with the electrical cords for your  <br/>
daughter) would be a good first step. This quote came up on  <br/>
AlwaysLearning, generated on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, which may be  <br/>
appropriate here:<br/>
<br/>
~ It has more to do with why people are doing what they are doing and<br/>
what they believe about it than WHAT they are doing.— Sandra Dodd ~<br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t about &quot;no bedtime&quot; in unschooling families. It  <br/>
definitely doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids to their own devices. It&#39;s more  <br/>
about helping kids understand their bodies&#39; need for sleep, the cues  <br/>
their bodies give them and also creating an environment conducive to  <br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that they don&#39;t take the family&#39;s  <br/>
(including partner&#39;s) needs seriously. There are ways to get all your  <br/>
needs met, including yours. It takes some creativity and flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at what your children want and need (connection with you,  <br/>
fun, attention, eventual sleep &lt;g&gt;), perhaps you can see it  <br/>
differently. My dd had a natural late-night rhythm and a physically  <br/>
active period in the evening. However, she did want to settle down  <br/>
eventually and nurse to sleep because she craved that connection with  <br/>
me. When she no longer nursed to sleep, I read to her and we snuggled  <br/>
to sleep. It was rarely difficult because her needs were being met. I  <br/>
could even adjust the timing to a bit earlier in the evening if  <br/>
necessary, because we were together. She also slept with us for a long  <br/>
time, since she didn&#39;t want to sleep alone.<br/>
<br/>
I realize meeting three kids&#39; needs is more challenging than one, but  <br/>
I know families with more than one child have figured it out in ways  <br/>
that work for them.<br/>
<br/>
Would your three-year old be happy to bring her markers and paper into  <br/>
bed while you settle the baby? This might require using old sheets  <br/>
that could be marked up, or you could give her fabric markers and she  <br/>
could make new and beautiful patterns. Give her old pillowcases that  <br/>
she can cut holes in, or soft fabric cords that wouldn&#39;t disturb your  <br/>
sleep if you rolled over on them. This is where creativity can come in!<br/>
<br/>
This may sound completely wacky to you and it&#39;s only one of many  <br/>
avenues you could explore. But, it has a completely different feel to  <br/>
it than her up by herself with markers, paper and scissors while you  <br/>
are elsewhere. Could she play beside you, instead? You could then  <br/>
transition to reading to her and encouraging her sleepiness. You can  <br/>
help her understand everyone&#39;s need for quiet and sleep time.<br/>
<br/>
If your dh has a need for quiet time, can you move your sleep ritual  <br/>
to another room? Maybe he will look at bedtime rituals as a way for  <br/>
him to connect with the kids, too, and still get his own time before  <br/>
or after.<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t the only things you can do, but it might give you a start  <br/>
of thinking of how to change things up for everyone. Most times, it&#39;s  <br/>
adjusting our *ideas* about sleep (or food, or tv). It requires seeing  <br/>
things from a different point of view entirely and working within a  <br/>
new framework. Seeing your kids&#39; needs as something to work *with*  <br/>
instead of against is a big shift.<br/>
<br/>
In that same post on Always Learning, Sandra wrote:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about when your kids go to sleep, it&#39;s about why they go to<br/>
sleep, how they feel about it, whether they chose to or were forced<br/>
to (as if you can force someone to sleep, not counting drugs, which<br/>
my mom&#39;s cousin used to do--and probably badillion others in the<br/>
1940&#39;s; she gave them peregoric, which is opium).<br/>
<br/>
Ewww.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, and (especially on unschooling lists &lt;g&gt;) it can also be important  <br/>
to examine your thinking about children&#39;s needs by watching how you  <br/>
say things (language influences our thinking and vice versa). Saying  <br/>
an infant &quot;has taken up a nasty habit&quot; shuts off the path to  <br/>
understanding *why* a baby might have changed his or her sleep  <br/>
patterns. You may have meant it innocently, but when you look at that  <br/>
statement, it seems you are saying your baby is doing something  <br/>
expressly to upset you. I don&#39;t imagine that&#39;s it at all :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562911808">I have a few funny ones about that too. I think both of my older children<br/>
have climbed on daddy&#39;s back to &quot;ride horse&quot; right in the middle. lol.<br/>

ever so rarely they are all asleep and we race. Having an infant makes it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007463159">I am sorry, I just spit out my iced tea over daddy being ridden like a horse. I don&#39;t think I have one to top that story, at least not yet. <br/>
<br/>
We were waiting for nights when the children went to their own beds, by their choice. Now we have my brother in law (DH&#39;s brother) watch the kids for a couple of hours at the park, beach, or what ever other adventure they come up with. DH and I also work different shifts so that special time has become very hard to find. Creativity is the spice of life, in all aspects. The kids have learned that daddy likes to get his back washed by mommy and things like that. If we don&#39;t have someone to watch the kids or we actually see that they are occupied with some game or project we just announce we are taking a shower and will be back out in a little while.<br/>

the evenings to unwind, watch TV, catch up with each other etc. etc.  <br/>
It was a real sticking point for us and he resisted A LOT!! I really <br/>
struggled with making sure everyone&#39;s needs were met during this <br/>
particular transition and confess to pretty much railroading my ever-<br/>
patient partner on more than one occasion...*sigh* ;}<br/>
<br/>
I found that in the beginning, Savannah (5yo) was just so excited to <br/>
be up and about until SHE wanted to go to sleep that she spent a few <br/>
weeks being fairly manic in the evenings...which drove hubby crazy <br/>
and made it harder to convince him that this really WAS a good <br/>
thing!  After several family discussions we agreed that it was <br/>
important that everyone should be able to enjoy their evening in <br/>
their own way, but not to infringe upon other family members <br/>
enjoyment. ie. if Savannah was feeling bouncy, she should bounce <br/>
somewhere other than in front of the TV that Daddy was watching his <br/>
news program on.  Eventually, after the &#39;novelty&#39; of it wore off, <br/>
Savannah started to naturally migrate up to her room for quiet time - <br/>
we would read or chat or watch TV...she would wander up and down the <br/>
stairs from time to time, checking in on us but not in the <br/>
old &#39;what&#39;s everyone else doing?&#39; way, just when she thought of <br/>
something she wanted to tell us or to get a drink or snack...I guess <br/>
she finally realized we&#39;re not all that exciting after dark! ;}  <br/>
Also, she and dh started watching some TV programs together...they <br/>
watch the Simpsons, Iron Chef, stuff on the Discovery channel...they <br/>
connect really well that way. She asks a bezillion questions, they <br/>
talk, they learn, they spend quiet time together....<br/>
<br/>
Then the day came, not so long ago, that in the middle of a favourite <br/>
show, Savannah announced that she was tired and wanted me to go and <br/>
tuck her into bed! I suppressed a triumphant grin as my hubby looked <br/>
quite disappointed that she was leaving before the end of the <br/>
program...;}<br/>
<br/>
Time and gradual transitioning I think is the key. I think my mistake <br/>
was trying to do everything at once.  I was so enthusiastic about the <br/>
whole idea, I wanted to do it all, RIGHT NOW!  Only when I stopped, <br/>
took a deep breath and slowed down, did things start to fall into <br/>
place. And it meant a lot of changes.  I&#39;ve made the choice to stay <br/>
up until my kids are asleep..which at its latest is about <br/>
11:30pm...not my ideal - I&#39;m an early-to-bed-early-to-rise type <br/>
naturally, so it&#39;s been a stretch out of my comfort zone to do this, <br/>
but it *feels* right to be with them right now. Given the conditions <br/>
conducive to sleep, but without someone telling them WHEN they will <br/>
certainly begin to listen to the cues their bodies are giving them.  <br/>
My son, (3.75) prefers to fall asleep in the playroom while watching <br/>
a movie...we dim the lights, he picks his final movie and asks me <br/>
to &#39;cozy up&#39;...snuggles, tucking in of blankets etc. then I leave him <br/>
until he&#39;s asleep and carry him upstairs to bed. Because the playroom <br/>
is in the basement I&#39;m not comfortable leaving him there as we are <br/>
two stories above him, so I wait to carry him up before falling <br/>
gratefully asleep myself...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, but I wanted you to know that you&#39;re not <br/>
alone in your struggles to help your hubby embrace this particular <br/>
aspect of unschooling.  But if you truly believe that this is the <br/>
path that is *right* for your family, then all will be well.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242762862">Well, if the kids stay up late and fall asleep and sleep in, how about a<br/>
little &#39;shower time nookie&#39; before spouse heads off to work? :-)<br/>
Seriously, it&#39;s about working out creative solutions - adult time need<br/>
not be from 9 to 11 pm because that&#39;s when the kids&#39; bedtime is. I WOH<br/>
fulltime and DH is at home. I REALLY need my sleep and both DH and DS<br/>
know it. BUT DH and I have signals (nonverbal cues) that say &quot;once DS is<br/>
asleep, wake me up!&quot; And, as someone mentioned, once the kid(s) get a<br/>
little older, it&#39;s easier - DS knows that we knock before entering his<br/>
room, he knocks before entering our room, it&#39;s respectful of someone&#39;s<br/>
privacy - yeah, we&#39;ve had a few close shaves when he knocked the walked<br/>
right in (&quot;Oh, hi - I&#39;ll meet you in your room in a couple minutes -<br/>
thanks&quot;) and, again since he&#39;s gotten older (he&#39;s now 10), he does know<br/>
that mommy and daddy sometimes use that &#39;private time&#39; for sex (and he&#39;s<br/>
got the basics of that concept as well). We&#39;ve used really late night<br/>
time, early morning time, visiting grandma&#39;s house time, and other<br/>
&#39;arrangements&#39;. Kids don&#39;t stay little for long and grownups don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily need to put them to bed at a set time to create that night<br/>
time &#39;private time&#39; - a simple signal (a tie on the door knob) plus<br/>
prior preparation (snacks, videos, etc within easy reach and such) and<br/>
you can create the space to have that time.<br/>

How do you squeeze in &#39;time with DH&#39;??? :)  Night time has for so long <br/>
been our<br/>
&#39;time&#39; to &#39;keep the fires burning&#39;.&lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Night time&quot; is over-rated. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It may have been convenient and easy, but now you have children. <br/>
Nothing is as convenient or easy any more. Get over it and get creative.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
So... how do other parents handle juggling time with DH and kids having <br/>
no<br/>
bedtime?  Locks on doors?  Rabid animal chained to door knob in case <br/>
children<br/>
get nosey about what&#39;s going on?  I have used the &#39;mommy and daddy were<br/>
wrestling line for so long.... I don&#39;t think they believe us anymore.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wellll...if they&#39;re not believing your lies any more, maybe you need to <br/>
tell them the truth. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re &quot;nosey,&quot; they&#39;re probably ready to be told what IS going on.<br/>
<br/>
They will probably be grossed out and start *avoiding* you when you <br/>
disappear into the bedroom!<br/>
<br/>
We told the boys that we needed some time alone together. Here&#39;s a <br/>
movie. Here are some snacks and a drink. Please don&#39;t interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
And probably since we&#39;d done the same with *them* when one of them <br/>
needed time alone with me or Ben, they were respectful of *our* need to <br/>
be alone.<br/>
<br/>
Not that we have never been interrupted. &lt;g&gt; It happens.<br/>
<br/>
As infants, they don&#39;t care an<br/>
d sleep right through it. Toddlers can be <br/>
worked around easily as they need so much sleep. But just about the <br/>
time that they&#39;re old enough to have it explained, it&#39;s GROSS, and <br/>
they&#39;re incredulous. Then, as they age and as they start realizing you <br/>
may have been telling the truth, it&#39;s even GROSSER to think your <br/>
PARENTS are doing that. THEN, as THEY start to engage on their own, <br/>
they&#39;re more than willing to give you all the privacy that they would <br/>
like. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it works in our *favor* to be open and honest. Just like Pam <br/>
Sorooshian! &lt;G&gt; (I love that story!)<br/>
