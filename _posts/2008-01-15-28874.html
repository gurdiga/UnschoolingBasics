<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537293739">Hi folks! Several people have nagged, umm, I mean, kindly suggested that I  <br/>
remind people that the Early Bird deadline to register for the Northeast  <br/>
Unschooling Conference over Memorial Day weekend is coming up on Friday. We also  <br/>
need all scholarship applications by then.<br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to let people know that we are trying to increase our block  of <br/>
rooms at the Marriott. If we have to we can go to a second hotel, but it&#39;s  <br/>
better to keep everyone together. The staff is trying to find out from another  <br/>
block if they&#39;re planning to use the rooms.  Right now there ARE rooms  <br/>
available at the Marriott in our block. Reserve early if you can!<br/>
 <br/>
Other Announcements:  The Fabulous Ben Lovejoy will by reprising his  support <br/>
for unschooling dads. And the awesomest Chris Trainor will be  coordinating <br/>
the conference raffle.  And Friday night of the conference  will be a great <br/>
Unschooling Themed Cocoa House!<br/>
 <br/>
Feel free to call me or email if you have any questions!<br/>

all ages. Sometimes, groups of teens will make their own thing (setting <br/>
up gaming or cheerleading or music jams or whatever) when they get <br/>
there - often later in the evening once most of the &#39;formal&#39; activities <br/>
are winding down.<br/>
