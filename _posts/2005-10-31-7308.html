<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046116245">**By the way has anybody read any of Joy Hakim&#39;s newer series, &quot;The  <br/>
Story of Science?&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
She only has one out so far - Aristotle leads the way. It&#39;s just as <br/>
engrossing as The Story Of US. I wish the woman wrote faster. :/<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s history and math and philosophy and geography and art and biography <br/>
and... it&#39;s wonderful<br/>
