<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204860326">Katharine      I to am wondering about this.  I have 6 kids and I try my best to do for them but it is like a never ending job.  I get so down on myself because the simple things that need to be done are not getting done, and it feels like the more you give the more they want.  I hope to gleem some wisdom from the group also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166686889">I agree with trying to allow extra, extra time to get ready particularly if you have small children who cannot &#39;do&#39; for themselves.  The older children can do some things for themselves (e.g., getting the last minute cup of juice as we race out the door) , or even helping a younger sib get a last minute cup of juice so mommy can take care of the infant.  I find it works well if we make it a team effort to get out the door on time and peacefully. The old option in our famliy (which did not work so well) was mommy racing around trying to get everyone else ready and out the door (including herself)  without blowing a fuse or resorting to screeching at the children ( which I would feel terribly guilty about once we were in the car on our way). (It seemed no matter how early we got up there was always a last minute frantic race to get out the door)  . My children (as do most I suspect) tend to  get themselves immersed in whatever game they are playing at the moment and  &#39;forget&#39; that we<br/>
 need to leave by a certain time. I still need to remind them (no matter how early we start the process of &#39;getting ready&#39; ) to make sure they get socks and shoes on, get whatever toys they are bringing along , etc., SEVERAL times.   :-)   I do try to teach my children (when they are old enough to understand of course)  that  when we make certain types of commitments ( a doctor appointment for example) that it is important to arrive on time out of respect for the doctor&#39;s time and also for the patients who have appointments following ours.  I try to show them that, when you  are told you have an hour before the family needs to leave  for an appointment, you need to think about making sure you are dressed, fed, and have used the toilet. Oh, and that you gathered up a book or toy if you want to take it along.  Naturally I help as needed with these tasks but as my children become older they can take more responsibility for some of these things.  I don&#39;t think it sends a good message t<br/>
o <br/>
my children if I allow them to run back into the house for forgotten toys or a last minute drink at the expense of the doctor (or whoever is waiting on our arrival). For us its a better lesson to let the child go without the toy for the hour we are at the doctor appt that day.Perhaps  then the  next time a similar situation arises and mommy says an hour in advance&#39; ok guys, be sure you get a toy ready, its close to time to leave&#39;  the child will remember (and I will remind him gently) being unhappy because he forgot a toy and be certain to have it ready this time around.   Its not that I think my child&#39;s needs are less important than the doctor&#39;s time but we have to function in a society where at times appointments must be made and kept.  And I do want my children to be respectful of others&#39; time and needs, as well as their own. <br/>

From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:katharinewise@...">katharinewise@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Someone (Joyce?) recently made a distinction (or possibly I read it <br/>
on a<br/>
website) between saying yes whenever possible with our goal being to <br/>
help our<br/>
children get what they want/need and being a doormat.  I was talking <br/>
with a<br/>
friend about this today and she said, &quot;That&#39;s my problem -- being a <br/>
doormat and<br/>
then feeling put-upon and getting angry -- but how do you do that?&quot;  <br/>
Since I&#39;m<br/>
still trying to figure this one out myself, I&#39;m hoping you all have <br/>
some<br/>
answers!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there&#39;s not a *solution*---it&#39;s more of a paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s understanding that these little people NEED us so damned much! I <br/>
mean: really, really NEED us!<br/>
<br/>
We *all* (even my heroes, Deb and Rue) sometimes feel put-upon and get <br/>
angry. But it&#39;s not THAT we feel that way---it&#39;s how we choose to <br/>
handle it when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Before unschooling, I would fuss and TELL them how put out I was---or <br/>
ask them to do it themselves, damn it! Then after starting to <br/>
incorporate the ideas I read from unschoolers, I would still grind my <br/>
teeth and glare. &lt;g&gt; Now, years later, I may still feel deep down <br/>
somewhere as if they *could* do it themselves (they *are* a lot older, <br/>
after all! &lt;g&gt;). Instead I smile and happily do it, knowing that it <br/>
*could* be the last time I get to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it&#39;s about changing the mind-set---changing the way YOU feel <br/>
about the same thing/situation. And KNOW that they won&#39;t be little <br/>
forever. They won&#39;t be around forever: children grow up and move out. <br/>
Unfortunately, some die very young. There are no guarantees!<br/>
<br/>
How would you treat them if this were the last day you had together? <br/>
Would you be GLAD to be a doormat? Would even SEE yourself as a <br/>
doormat? Or as a mom who adores them and can&#39;t get enough of them and <br/>
can&#39;t DO enough for them?<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t always work---some days you *will* feel worn out and unable to <br/>
do *one more thing* for them. But if that *were* the last thing you <br/>
*could* do---wouldn&#39;t you? And it gets easier: the more you practice <br/>
gentle, mindful parenting, the easier it gets---plus: they get older <br/>
every single minute!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you want a specific scenario, here&#39;s one, although I&#39;m really <br/>
looking for<br/>
broader thoughts rather than help on this incident:<br/>
<br/>
Trying to get out the door early to a commitment (substitute teaching <br/>
Sunday<br/>
School) and 4yo wants a toy.  Find the toy.  Wants a snack.  Fix the <br/>
snack.<br/>
Wants something else, I no longer remember what, find it.  Get to the <br/>
car, snack<br/>
falls, wants it washed off -- but by now we&#39;re 10 minutes *late* as I <br/>
discover<br/>
car clock is later than kitchen clock.  Rest of the family had gone <br/>
earlier, so<br/>
I was on my own.  This time I said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it fell in the dirt, <br/>
and you<br/>
really wanted to eat it now.  I really don&#39;t have time to wash it now <br/>
because<br/>
we&#39;re already late and people at church are depending on me and <br/>
wondering where<br/>
we are.  We can take it in to the water fountain and wash it at <br/>
church.&quot;  But<br/>
really, I think I did too many things before we left.  I really did <br/>
have a time<br/>
commitment, but I kept thinking, &quot;It will be much faster to find the <br/>
toy than to<br/>
try to take an upset child...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I know it was just an example, but let&#39;s use it:<br/>
<br/>
I think a big part of it is seeing that NONE of that was *his* fault! <br/>
YES, if you were childless, you could get out the door quickly and <br/>
easily. You&#39;re not! You need to prepare ahead of time. You&#39;re a <br/>
parent---and parents run on &quot;kid time&quot; not adult time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t fix what&#39;s already passed, but in this instance: Maybe he&#39;s too <br/>
young for you to make outside commitments, like subbing at Sunday <br/>
school. And if you *do* have places to go (on time), you may need to <br/>
either realize you&#39;ll be late OR---better: get up earlier! Have all <br/>
those things in order and already in the car or in a bag to grab <br/>
(snack, toys, shoes, coats) as you walk out the door. Be proactive! If <br/>
you *know* he&#39;ll need these things, get them ready the night before or <br/>
before he wakes up.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the clock thing: that was *really* not his fault! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It probably WAS a lot faster to find the toy---and I&#39;m sure he <br/>
appreciated your searching for it! As well as your explanantion of why <br/>
you needed to go. But again---that was not *his* problem! &lt;G&gt; HE didn&#39;t <br/>
make that commitment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I HATE to be late, so if I am, there was something really wrong. I get <br/>
up extra early and try to pack and organize things ahead of time. I <br/>
like to be able to just walk aout the door. Cameron (19) is like that <br/>
now: years of modelling! &lt;g&gt; Duncan (11 next week) is getting that <br/>
way---especially with trips, but I still do most of his packing and <br/>
organizing. I also remind him of things that I know he&#39;d miss having <br/>
along(stuffed animal, game, pillow).<br/>
<br/>
You already know what went wrong *last* time, so you can take steps to <br/>
avoid *those* things next time. There will still be new things that <br/>
come up &lt;g&gt;, but you can add those things as you learn them to make it <br/>
better and better. He will too!<br/>

Some of those requests are pretty predictable, too. I&#39;m a list-<br/>
maker, and especially if I&#39;m feeling a bit scattered a list can <br/>
really help this whole process *and* help me and Mo communicate <br/>
about our various needs. I put everything I can think of on my <br/>
getting-ready-to-go lists: getting snacks, finding shoes, going <br/>
pee... and if something else comes up - on the list it goes. Since <br/>
Mo&#39;s pretty visual, that really helps her understand what&#39;s going <br/>
on, why is mommy taking so long, and how our various needs in the <br/>
moment interact. She also likes crossing things off as they <br/>
get &quot;done&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Really, I think the big difference between helping our kids get <br/>
their needs met and being a doormat is having open two-way <br/>
communication. <br/>

arguments, I *told* you to get ready and even how. Ouch. <br/>
<br/>
If going to the doctor is a regular occurrance in your family, maybe <br/>
y&#39;all - and I mean all y&#39;all together - can brainstorm some new <br/>
ideas for making the process easier. Are there some special books <br/>
and toys (and shoes and sweaters...) that can stay packed in the car <br/>
*just* for appts? Can you get ready the night before? Can you create <br/>
a bunch of mini-lists for each of the kids - say one kid gets to <br/>
round up all the shoes and line them up by the door while another <br/>
puts games in the car?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A team effort sounds great. You don&#39;t need to add &quot;lessons&quot; <br/>
or &quot;consequences&quot; to that. The kids can tell the difference between <br/>
a smooth and a rough transition. Talking about what made it smooth <br/>
or rough, thanking them for their help, commiserating over forgotten <br/>
items - all those things can reinforce the feeling of &quot;we&#39;re all <br/>
working together&quot; and demonstrate the sort of mutual respect you are <br/>
hoping they learn.<br/>

    I agree with trying to allow extra, extra time to get ready <br/>
particularly if you<br/>
have small children who cannot &#39;do&#39; for themselves. &lt;snip&gt; I find it <br/>
works well if we make it<br/>
a team effort to get out the door on time and peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Extra, extra time is really importat when you have littluns.<br/>
<br/>
And working together almost always beats doing it all yourself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do try to teach my children (when they are old enough to understand <br/>
of course)<br/>
that  when we make certain types of commitments ( a doctor appointment <br/>
for<br/>
example) that it is important to arrive on time out of respect for the <br/>
doctor&#39;s<br/>
time and also for the patients who have appointments following ours.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wish the doctors could be *just* as respectful of *my* time (and <br/>
that&#39;s coming from a doctor&#39;s kid! &lt;g&gt;). Just be aware of the lack of <br/>
reciprocation.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s simply important to be on time and respectful of others&#39; <br/>
time---doesn&#39;t matter  *who* is on the other end---the doctor, the <br/>
plumber, the cable guy, my kids!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it sends a good message to<br/>
my children if I allow them to run back into the house for forgotten <br/>
toys or a<br/>
last minute drink at the expense of the doctor (or whoever is waiting <br/>
on our<br/>
arrival).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you never run back into the house for anything? Car keys? money? <br/>
tickets? a sweater?<br/>
<br/>
If one of us forgets something, we *quickly* discuss whether it&#39;s <br/>
better to turn around and run back in or forgo the missing/forgotten <br/>
item. I have modelled this enough that the boys can decide for <br/>
themselves what&#39;s more important. Sometimes it&#39;s NECESSARY to go back <br/>
for something. Other times, it&#39;s a just an inconvenience NOT to have it <br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 For us its a better lesson to let the child go without the toy for the<br/>
hour we are at the doctor appt that day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When  &quot;teaching lessons,&quot; it&#39;s important to understand that what&#39;s <br/>
*learned* isn&#39;t necessarily what you *think* you&#39;re &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And an hour at the doctor&#39;s office is certainly A LOT better (for <br/>
everyone!) when the toddler has his favorite toy---even if you&#39;re three <br/>
minutes late.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps  then the  next time a similar<br/>
situation arises and mommy says an hour in advance&#39; ok guys, be sure <br/>
you get a<br/>
toy ready, its close to time to leave&#39;  the child will remember (and I <br/>
will<br/>
remind him gently) being unhappy because he forgot a toy and be certain <br/>
to have<br/>
it ready this time around.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s where it gets sticky:<br/>
<br/>
*I* would be sure that the special toy is tucked under *MY* arm so that <br/>
the child knows how seriously I take his needs. I wouldn&#39;t make his <br/>
miss that toy in order to teach a lesson---or even be happy that maybe <br/>
next time he&#39;d remember. If *I* remember, I&#39;m passing on the care and <br/>
concern I hope he develops too. I&#39;m showing *him* how important I find <br/>
*him*. By modelling *that*, I hope he will be just as compassionate and <br/>
generous as I&#39;ve been to him. If he saw that I left my purse on the <br/>
kitchen table and yet walked on by to &quot;teach me a lesson&quot; not to forget <br/>
my purse,... yikes! I haven&#39;t modelled the behavior *I* want to see. <br/>
I&#39;d hope he&#39;d pick it up and kindly hand it to me, as I would for him!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Its not that I think my child&#39;s needs are less<br/>
important than the doctor&#39;s time but we have to function in a society <br/>
where at<br/>
times appointments must be made and kept.  And I do want my children to <br/>
be<br/>
respectful of others&#39; time and needs, as well as their own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
No one thinks you think your child&#39;s needs are less than. But the best <br/>
way to get our children to be respectful of others&#39; time and needs is <br/>
to BE respectful of our children&#39;s time and needs.<br/>
<br/>
If *we* make that extra effort *now*, *they* will make that extra <br/>
effort later, when they&#39;re ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A better lesson for the child ...... I know that if I  find myself in a situation where I am unprepared and am uncomfortable as a result ( be that discomfort emotional or physical) it helps me to learn that the next time I want to be better prepared. Children are certainly capable of the same learning experiences. I am referring to a child who is old enough to understand the requests being made of him in advance of putting him a certain situation (e.g., please select a toy because it is almost time to go to baby&#39;s doctor appt) The intention is not to be cruel but as a different approach to helping them see the importance of  getting ourselves ready to go out in more functional way for everybody- and precisely because nagging them over and over  each and every time we went out of the house was not effective. <br/>

<br/>
We all have responsibilities to other people besides our children.  A parent might feel their children&#39;s needs  should always take priority and in a perfect world or in a vaccuum this would be the case. There are times when even within a family one child&#39;s (sickness for example) needs might necessarily  take priority over another child&#39;s needs (needing help with a video game). When mommy is helping her sick child throw-up the video game will have to wait .  That is life.   Sometimes the priority is being someplace and being there on time.  If I have one sick  infant  in need of a doctor&#39;s attention, and two other children over the age of 7 who are feeling well and are capable of understanding that &quot; baby needs to go to the doctor. We need to leave the house in 30 minutes to bring the baby to the doctor so please choose the toy you would like to bring along if any.  This is not an unrealistic expectation, and there is no misunderstanding the request.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>arguments, I *told* you to get ready and even how. Ouch. <br/>
Punishment or consequence?  The reality is that there are always consequences (be they positive or negative) to our actions.   If a child is kindly reminded that the family is going to an appointment and asked if they would like to take along a toy- if that child says &quot;yes&quot; and mother says- &quot;ok we will be leaving soon , please go ahead and select a toy so we can leave the house&quot;- child says &quot;ok&quot;- then proceeds to get involved in another activity and forgets to choose a toy  (mind you, this is not a single episode, occurs repeatedly), then another way of learning is needed. Unfortunately leaving toys packed in the car does not do the tricks.  Tried and failed.  There comes a time when I feel my children do need to understand and respect what the needs are of others in the family (and in their world).   <br/>

&gt;on, get whatever toys they are bringing along , etc., SEVERAL <br/>
&gt;times. :-) <br/>
<br/>
If I find I&#39;m repeating myself, I take that as a cue that something <br/>
isn&#39;t working. My expectations are too high, my kids aren&#39;t <br/>
understanding, or I&#39;m just plain not paying enough attention. So I <br/>
try to remind myself to slow down, take some deep breaths, and look <br/>
at the whole situation differently. Do I need to stop and make a <br/>
list or do some other advance organization? Maybe I need to <br/>
reprioritize - most often by shifting my kids&#39; needs to connect with <br/>
me to a higher level of importance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;For us its a better lesson to let the child go without the toy for <br/>
&gt;the hour we are at the doctor appt that day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Perhaps then the next time a similar situation arises and mommy <br/>
&gt;says an hour in advance&#39; ok guys, be sure you get a toy ready, its <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s punishment. Do it my way or be unhappy - your fault, no <br/>
arguments, I *told* you to get ready and even how. Ouch. <br/>
<br/>
If going to the doctor is a regular occurrance in your family, maybe <br/>
y&#39;all - and I mean all y&#39;all together - can brainstorm some new <br/>
ideas for making the process easier. Are there some special books <br/>
and toys (and shoes and sweaters...) that can stay packed in the car <br/>
*just* for appts? Can you get ready the night before? Can you create <br/>
a bunch of mini-lists for each of the kids - say one kid gets to <br/>
round up all the shoes and line them up by the door while another <br/>
puts games in the car?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I find it works well if we make it a team effort to get out the <br/>
&gt;door on time and peacefully. <br/>
<br/>
A team effort sounds great. You don&#39;t need to add &quot;lessons&quot; <br/>
or &quot;consequences&quot; to that. The kids can tell the difference between <br/>
a smooth and a rough transition. Talking about what made it smooth <br/>
or rough, thanking them for their help, commiserating over forgotten <br/>
items - all those things can reinforce the feeling of &quot;we&#39;re all <br/>
working together&quot; and demonstrate the sort of mutual respect you are <br/>
hoping they learn.<br/>

One of the tenets of unschooling is that everyone learns in their own <br/>
way.  So that while you may learn from discomfort it may not be true <br/>
for others.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest forgetting the premise that any other person is capable <br/>
of the same learning experience.  Its kind of like saying, &quot;it worked <br/>
for me it will work for you.&quot;  If that were the case then <br/>
one &#39;curriculum&#39; would work for everyone and there would be no need <br/>
for &#39;homeschooling&#39; at all &lt;g&gt;  - certainly no impetus to unschool.<br/>

***********************<br/>
<br/>
So the question i have is who is to determine what age is the right <br/>
age for understanding a request?  We all learn different lessons at <br/>
different ages.  we all interpret requests in different ways.  The <br/>
way i communicate to one child in my home is very different than how <br/>
i might communicate to another.  They are different people and i have <br/>
come to know that requests need to be addressed differently if i want <br/>
them to be understood.<br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling venue expectations of learning are not based on <br/>
age.  In fact expectations of learning only seems to get in the way <br/>
of real living, real relationships and real learning.<br/>

************<br/>
i agree whole heartedly.  If what i am doing repeatedly is <br/>
ineffective and i continue to repeat the same action expecting <br/>
different results i refer to this as insanity.  So as the adult, i <br/>
can choose to take rational and responsible action by changing my <br/>
behavior and/or changing my expectations.  It is my responsibility as <br/>
the parent to be mindful of what works best for my child.  In our <br/>
house, coersion is not productive. Negative consequences do not build <br/>
positive self esteem.  quite the contrary.<br/>

To a small child, *intent* doesn&#39;t enter ino it though. They really <br/>
don&#39;t *see* the importance of getting ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
And if mom&#39;s &quot;nagging them over and over each and every time.&quot; then <br/>
they aren&#39;t nearly ready to see that importance.<br/>

If I<br/>

over the age of 7 who are feeling well and are capable of understanding <br/>

<br/>
Children over seven? I though we were talking about a four year old. <br/>
Most children over seven/eight DO have that concept.<br/>

And yet they aren&#39;t complying? Could there be another explanation?<br/>

Punishment or consequence?  The reality is that there are always <br/>
consequences<br/>
(be they positive or negative) to our actions.<br/>

<br/>
Punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed there are consequences; but when they are arbitrarily imposed by <br/>
the parent, they aren&#39;t natural---and children can see through that. It <br/>
can make the children sneaky and unreliable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If a child is kindly reminded<br/>
that the family is going to an appointment and asked if they would like <br/>
to take<br/>
along a toy- if that child says &quot;yes&quot; and mother says- &quot;ok we will be <br/>

toy  (mind you, this is not a single episode, occurs repeatedly), then <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Well, in this case, the mom is not seeing that the child is not quite <br/>
ready for this responsibility. Get the toy. And if it happens <br/>
repeatedly, that should be a HUGE clue!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not &quot;another way of learning,&quot; but time and modelling is what&#39;s <br/>
needed.<br/>

not for the child. This is exactly the sort of situation - the sort <br/>
that I find occurring repeatedly, I mean - where I find it really <br/>
really valuble to step back and ask myself what *I* could be doing <br/>
differently. What am *I* missing? How can *I* make this easier for <br/>
the kid in question? <br/>
<br/>
In the situation described above, I wonder if the problem isn&#39;t <br/>
getting ready, but lag-time. The child needs to get ready *and* pass <br/>
the remaining time before actually leaving. Both my kids (and their <br/>
dad!!!) struggle with this, so part of my getting-ready-to-go <br/>
planning has to include dealing with this complex in-between time. <br/>

to come home. That&#39;s an hour-and-a-half each way, so going back was <br/>
out of the question for the day. We could have looked at the matter <br/>
as a lesson in consequences for Rayan, but instead we commiserated <br/>
and appologised to Ray for not having helped him remember. Now <br/>
George and I double-check that he has all his gear. I suppose you <br/>
could say we chose to see the &quot;lesson&quot; as being about team-work. If <br/>
we all help each other, everything runs more smoothly.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found it helpful, personally, to break the idea of &quot;respect&quot; <br/>
down into smaller components - its a pretty vast concept. In this <br/>
thread, I&#39;d consider the underlying principles to be those of <br/>
consideration and mutual assistance. Those are pretty important <br/>
principles, to me. They aren&#39;t the sorts of things kids learn <br/>
from &quot;consequences&quot; though. People learn the value of consideration <br/>
by having it shown to them. <br/>
<br/>
My active, boistrous 5yo is amazingly quiet and considerate when I&#39;m <br/>
sick. She *wants* to help. She doesn&#39;t always know *how* - yesterday <br/>
she made me lukewarm tea and a bunch of mustard sandwiches &lt;eeew&gt; <br/>
but she certainly goes out of her way trying. I&#39;m getting over the <br/>
flu, and she&#39;s getting a little tired of hearing &quot;Mommy&#39;s still <br/>
sick&quot; (I&#39;m getting tired of saying it!) but she&#39;s still being as <br/>
considerate as a 5yo can possibly be. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson has only lived with consideration for a few months. It <br/>
startles him. A couple times he&#39;s been on the verge of tears because <br/>
of small acts of kindness. He&#39;s not learning that there are no <br/>
consequences to his actions and he doesn&#39;t think his stepmom is a <br/>
doormat ;) He&#39;s learning the value of consideration from the inside. <br/>
We definately have to *ask* him to do things, but he does things for <br/>
us willingly and cheerfully, because he sees the value in mutual <br/>
assistance.<br/>

The intention is not to be cruel but as a different approach to <br/>
helping them see the<br/>
importance of getting ourselves ready to go out in more functional way <br/>
for<br/>
everybody- and precisely because nagging them over and over each and <br/>
every time<br/>
we went out of the house was not effective.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
To a small child, *intent* doesn&#39;t enter ino it though. They really <br/>
don&#39;t *see* the importance of getting ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
And if mom&#39;s &quot;nagging them over and over each and every time.&quot; then <br/>
they aren&#39;t nearly ready to see that importance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the priority is being someplace and being there on time. <br/>
If I<br/>
have one sick infant in need of a doctor&#39;s attention, and two other <br/>
children<br/>
over the age of 7 who are feeling well and are capable of understanding <br/>
that &quot;<br/>
baby needs to go to the doctor. We need to leave the house in 30 <br/>
minutes to<br/>
bring the baby to the doctor so please choose the toy you would like to <br/>
bring<br/>
along if any. This is not an unrealistic expectation, and there is no<br/>
misunderstanding the request.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children over seven? I though we were talking about a four year old. <br/>
Most children over seven/eight DO have that concept.<br/>
<br/>
And yet they aren&#39;t complying? Could there be another explanation?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;That&#39;s punishment. Do it my way or be unhappy - your fault, no<br/>
 </span></blockquote>arguments, I *told* you to get ready and even how. Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment or consequence? The reality is that there are always <br/>
consequences<br/>
(be they positive or negative) to our actions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed there are consequences; but when they are arbitrarily imposed by <br/>
the parent, they aren&#39;t natural---and children can see through that. It <br/>
can make the children sneaky and unreliable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a child is kindly reminded<br/>
that the family is going to an appointment and asked if they would like <br/>
to take<br/>
along a toy- if that child says &quot;yes&quot; and mother says- &quot;ok we will be <br/>
leaving<br/>
soon , please go ahead and select a toy so we can leave the house&quot;- <br/>
child says<br/>
&quot;ok&quot;- then proceeds to get involved in another activity and forgets to <br/>
choose a<br/>
toy (mind you, this is not a single episode, occurs repeatedly), then <br/>
another<br/>
way of learning is needed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Well, in this case, the mom is not seeing that the child is not quite <br/>
ready for this responsibility. Get the toy. And if it happens <br/>
repeatedly, that should be a HUGE clue!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not &quot;another way of learning,&quot; but time and modelling is what&#39;s <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately leaving toys packed in the car does not<br/>
do the tricks. Tried and failed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? How?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There comes a time when I feel my children do<br/>
need to understand and respect what the needs are of others in the <br/>
family (and<br/>
in their world).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They need to be given/shown that understanding and respect *themselves* <br/>
before they can give/show it to others.<br/>

Wow, I seem to be approaching parenting from a very different <br/>
perspective than<br/>
many of you (having grown up a &#39;processed child&#39; with two public school <br/>
teachers<br/>
as parents) .<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d venture to say that almost (if not all) of us grew up <br/>
&quot;processed&quot;---very traditionally! We&#39;ve just decided to change how *we* <br/>
parent. By changing our own perspective, we can *start* to make it <br/>
easier for our children to be better parents too. Changing is hard. <br/>
Shedding that baggage is hard. My children already have less baggage to <br/>
unload.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I will have to take some time to digest this and ponder your<br/>
perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good---but don&#39;t take *too* much time! Your kids aren&#39;t getting any <br/>
younger! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That being the case there are times when I get impatient with the<br/>
children (and myself) when things seem &#39;out of control&#39; (for example <br/>
when we<br/>
need to be somewhere and things aren&#39;t coming together smoothly) . I <br/>
don&#39;t want<br/>
to feel impatient with them but as someone mentioned, perhaps a <br/>
different way of<br/>
looking parenting would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We all feel that way. But if *you* are 35---with  35 years of <br/>
experience---can you imagine how a five year old could feel just a <br/>
*bit* more overwhelmed than *you*?? I mean: he&#39;s had only four years of <br/>
experience---yet we get angry and impatient when he can&#39;t figure out <br/>
how to deal wit the situation! Stopping and thinking about how *HE* is <br/>
feeling can make all the difference!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It definitely changes my perspective if I<br/>
imagine this could (on any day) be my last day with them....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And as much as we&#39;d all like to think it won&#39;t happen to us, there are <br/>
two unschooling moms (regular readers/posters) who each lost an <br/>
eight-year-old child. It *can* and *does* happen.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m about to lose it, if I can stop, breathe, and think of what it <br/>
would  be like without him, I can recenter myself and deal with the <br/>
situation rationally. Makes all the difference in my world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  In some ways I am finding your responses  ironic because I&#39;d always <br/>
thought of myself as very<br/>
liberal, lenient , free parent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many of us did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am one of the few unschoolers I know in my area.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I had concerns that I was not doing enough to<br/>
maintain parental control of my children (comparing myself of course <br/>
with those<br/>
families I come into contact with regularly in the local homeschooling<br/>
community).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
yeah---but if it&#39;s about *control*, you&#39;ve come to the wrong place. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
We&#39;re not about control of our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest staying away from controlling parents until you&#39;re <br/>
comfortable where you are on your own journey. After you &#39;get&quot; it, <br/>
thenm you probably won&#39;t *want* to be around those parents any more &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I travel to see my unschooling/gentle, mindful family friends. <br/>
Sometimes 4-5 trips. But it&#39;s worth it.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When mommy is helping her sick child throw-up the video game will  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when children&#39;s needs are treated with respect, then they are  <br/>
more accepting of waiting. It&#39;s when they feel they have to compete  <br/>
with others for a limited quantity, when they feel that unless  <br/>
they&#39;re tended to immediately they&#39;re likely to be forgotten that  <br/>
they will continue to fight for what they need.<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t help clarity of thinking to lump emergencies in  <br/>
with normal getting the kids out of the house. *If* you do experience  <br/>
a lot of emergencies, then in a way they become normal and you can  <br/>
think ahead and plan better: having the typical things that kids will  <br/>
need ready and waiting to go.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband liked to arrive when he planned even when time  <br/>
wasn&#39;t an issue. What if you were going to his family&#39;s house and he  <br/>
said he&#39;d be there at 3. What if, a few minutes into a two hour trip,  <br/>
in the flurry of getting kids ready, you realized you&#39;d forgotten  <br/>
your knitting (or something that made a 2 hour trip enjoyable for  <br/>
you) and he said no, he was sorry he wanted to be there at 3 not  <br/>
3:05, so he wouldn&#39;t turn around. You had to learn to remember.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is different *and yet* from children&#39;s point of view  <br/>
it&#39;s exactly the same. They *can&#39;t* see the difference between the  <br/>
scenarios until they&#39;re older. So until they&#39;re older you&#39;re coming  <br/>
across to them as rigid rather than instructive. While your practice  <br/>
might actually make the kids remember, it won&#39;t be a pleasant  <br/>
association they have with remembering. It will call of memories of  <br/>
anger and resentment more than the boredom.<br/>
<br/>
What if, instead, he asked before you walked out, if you had your  <br/>
knitting? What if, before you were ready, he asked if there was  <br/>
anything he could do for you? What if *he* remembered your knitting  <br/>
and had it all packed for you?<br/>

Which person would you want to not inconvenience more? Which would  <br/>
you want to go out of your way to be nice to?<br/>

independent. One of her first words was &quot;Self!&quot; I&#39;ve gotten pretty <br/>
comfortable with communicating with her and figuring out her needs, <br/>
even when she&#39;s not really able to express them directly. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson is a *very* different person. He&#39;s much, much more verbal <br/>
and social - he doesn&#39;t like doing things by himself for the most <br/>
part, but his interests are really different from mine. So I&#39;ve <br/>
been &quot;stretching&quot; myself in a lot of different ways since he moved <br/>
in (back in Nov) trying to figure out how to parent such a different <br/>
kid. <br/>
<br/>
If I were to look at Ray through the lens of Morgan, I&#39;d be saying a <br/>
lot of things like: &quot;I showed you this once already, why can&#39;t you <br/>
get it?  you&#39;re 13 for pete&#39;s sake!&quot; But Ray&#39;s not Mo, doesn&#39;t learn <br/>
the way Mo learns, and doesn&#39;t want the things she wants. He&#39;s a <br/>
different person with really different needs. In a way, I&#39;m grateful <br/>
for that. I think we&#39;d all be having a harder time in terms of <br/>
expectations if Ray were more like Mo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156011431">I&#39;ll agree with Deborah on this one. You have a commitment. Occasionally<br/>
(some more than others) adults have commitments other than their<br/>
children. Children need to respect and understand this - they too will<br/>
one day have commitments.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that knowing you had such an important day, you focused on<br/>
yourself rather than your child, child noticed the difference, and so<br/>
did what he could to get the attention he is accustomed to back ala &quot;if<br/>
you give a mouse a cookie&quot;. Did you tell your child how important this<br/>
day was to you, how excited you were about it, that you really wanted to<br/>
be on-time, and could he help you get ready? Perhaps next time he will<br/>
pack your bag, rather than you packing his.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading John Holt/Patrick Farenga Teach Your Own. You<br/>
would not believe how many times Holt talks about the importance of<br/>
children being exposed to adults whose primary work is *not* taking care<br/>
of kids. It is not ever too early for children to understand there is a<br/>
world outside of themselves, and that understanding does not in any way<br/>
spoil their childhood. Saying &quot;yes&quot; to kids is not about giving them<br/>
everything they want just because they want it, but rather about<br/>
enabling to learn things *for themselves*.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that is both specific and general ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks :-)  That is encouraging!  It seems that, rather than compartmentalizing my existing philosophies of  &#39;parenting&#39; and &#39;learning/schooling&#39;,  I should be thinking of the unschooling journey as an entire  &#39;lifestyle philisophy&#39;.  Well, I can see I still have some learning to do myself. :-) <br/>
Will continue to read and realize.  Thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892879035">I am still new to this type of parenting and relapse back now and <br/>
then. I have to say thought that I now think about these so <br/>
called &quot;natural consequences&quot; often. I have a 6 yr old that is  <br/>
difficult. When I occasionally ask her to do something, that I know <br/>
she understands is important, and just refuses to do it almost <br/>
always , well, what is the &quot;natural consequence&quot; to that? <br/>
<br/>
For example, the other day my kids got out the flour and water on <br/>
threw it all over the counter (and floor) I did not get mad ...as I <br/>
knew they wanted to make play dough. I cleaned it up a bit and added <br/>
some salt. ..and just let them do their thing. I saved the dough as <br/>
well for more play later. TOday, I needed to be on the phone with <br/>
some important calls for a bit. I told my dds that I need some quiet <br/>
time, before I called. I then saw my 6 yr old take out the salt <br/>
dough and they were becoming loud. I muted the phone and explained <br/>
again about my need for some quiet phone time. (this rarely ever <br/>
works by the way) then my 6 yr old went and got a large container of <br/>
very soapy water and I saw her about to throw the dough into it. she <br/>
did this the day before and I knew the 2 of them would start <br/>
throwing it around and making a huge mess, and be very loud. I muted <br/>
the phone AGAIN ,and gave her  a choice of playing with only the <br/>
water with the funnel, or only the dough, UNTIL I was off the phone <br/>
and then we could do it outside. Two seconds later...in went the <br/>
dough into the soapy water and the loud mess began....I could not <br/>
hear on the phone. The caller said my kids sound very wild! I had to <br/>
end the call. I was very angry. She understood everything perfectly <br/>
well! She tests me all the time to see if she can do exactly what I <br/>
respectfully ask her to wait on..etc etc. HOw would all of you <br/>
UNSCHOOLERS handled this...because I do not see this approach <br/>
working in all circumstances. To me, if she cannot respectfully <br/>
carry out an occasional important request, then the consequence <br/>
should be ..that neither will I with her For example I may just <br/>
say, &quot;no, I will not take you to the park right now, as I now have <br/>
this huge mess to clean,(they rarely will help clean up) when I <br/>
asked you to wait until it was outside! And secondly I need to call <br/>
back the person I was speaking with , when they could not hear me on <br/>
the phone!&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473444917">Ray:  My guess is that knowing you had such an important day, you focused on<br/>
<br/>
yourself rather than your child, child noticed the difference, and so<br/>
<br/>
did what he could to get the attention he is accustomed to back ala &quot;if<br/>
<br/>
you give a mouse a cookie&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:  Well, to be honest, I think he simply didn&#39;t want to go.  I was subbing for his sunday school teacher (I normally go to his class with him anyway because he doesn&#39;t want me to leave).   But he really doesn&#39;t want to go at all.  I know that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother bag of worms.   Frankly, I insist we go because dh is the pastor, it&#39;s a small, struggling church, and if we didn&#39;t...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ray:  I am currently reading John Holt/Patrick Farenga Teach Your Own. You<br/>
<br/>
would not believe how many times Holt talks about the importance of<br/>
<br/>
children being exposed to adults whose primary work is *not* taking care<br/>
<br/>
of kids. It is not ever too early for children to understand there is a<br/>
<br/>
world outside of themselves, and that understanding does not in any way<br/>
<br/>
spoil their childhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:  Actually, I do believe it:-)  And others too.  I think the first thing I read that said that was The Continuum Concept, and I&#39;ve struggled with it ever since.  I like the idea of children being involved in the world of meaningful, working adults.  I know an organic farming, homeschooling family and often think what a wonderful life for the kids that is -- lots of interesting help and visitors, adults engaged in real  (and interesting to kids too -- not typing at a computer) work, lots of space to explore and play outside.  But I taught before I had kids, not a world I could bring them into or want to at this point, though I might have then:-)  I don&#39;t really know how to do this in our age-segregated culture.  Most of us have to choose between continuing what we did before having children, or being with our children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds to me as though you are seeing this as a control issue <br/>
(child is &quot;difficult&quot;), whereas I would see it as a communications <br/>
and/or logistics issue. Living with other people can be terribly <br/>
inconvenient. Trying to communicate in a group of people with <br/>
different levels of energy and differnt needs is challenging. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To start with, if I know ahead of time that I&#39;m going to be on the <br/>
phone, in particular, I work to get my 5yo set up with a project <br/>
that she can be totally immersed in *before* I get on the phone <br/>
*and* I explain that I&#39;m going to be mostly unavailable for X amount <br/>
of time. If its really important, I have a back-up plan.<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t have the luxury of preplanning, though (more the norm, <br/>
for me), I may have to grab something fast off a shelf, offer to <br/>
call back in 5min, or, in the incident above, I&#39;d have said to <br/>
myself &quot;I&#39;ll deal with the mess later, at least she found a project&quot; <br/>
and walked far enough away from the delighted squeals to be able to <br/>
hear the phone. Its just a mess.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I muted the phone and explained <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it doesn&#39;t work, you need a new strategy - maybe better planning, <br/>
or working on your communication skills, or your relationship with <br/>
your dd outside of these kinds of moments, or your expectations wrt <br/>
the patience and emphathy of six year olds. <br/>
<br/>
You have a whole bunch of skills she doesn&#39;t have yet - the ability <br/>
to see a bigger picture, look at situations from another <br/>
perspective, and make concious decisions to change the way you do <br/>
things in light of that. Maybe you grew up in a household where the <br/>
adults didn&#39;t do those things, so you are struggling to learn them <br/>
*now* - but you *can* learn them. Choosing to learn better parenting <br/>
skills doesn&#39;t make someone a doormat.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; asked you to wait until it was outside!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You sound really frustrated. Take a deep breath and step back. <br/>
Lashing out in frustration isn&#39;t going to help you to communicate <br/>
with your kids, its going to throw up walls *preventing* <br/>
communication. The consequence of your lack of proactive parenting  <br/>
is that you are angry and frustrated. Its OK to express that to your <br/>
kids! Its not okay to blame them for it. They are just kids being <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me, if she cannot respectfully <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think about it from her pov - why is talking to some imaginary voice <br/>
in the ether more important than a Majestic Science Experiment? <br/>
Flour, water, salt and soap??? Ooooohhhh ahhhhhhhhh..... the <br/>
chemistry, the physics, the art of it all... all *you* were doing <br/>
was talking. She was inventing the world.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more helpful in terms of building relationships to turn  <br/>
the thoughts around to knowing and trusting that children will be  <br/>
able to respect others needs when they&#39;re raised in an atmosphere of  <br/>
respect *and* when they are developmentally able.<br/>
<br/>
If *we* decide, for whatever reason, that they are able and expect it  <br/>
of them, we set them up to fail *and* set ourselves up for  <br/>
frustration when they fail to live up to expectations.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to avoid that is to plan around them not yet having  <br/>
the skills. (Or not consistently having the skills.) So when they  <br/>
actually do do something respectful, it feels like a gift they&#39;re  <br/>
giving us. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did you tell your child how important this<br/>
&gt; day was to you, how excited you were about it, that you really  <br/>
&gt; wanted to<br/>
&gt; be on-time, and could he help you get ready? Perhaps next time he will<br/>
&gt; pack your bag, rather than you packing his.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this can be an effective strategy: helping the child feel a  <br/>
part of the solution rather than turning the child into the problem.<br/>
<br/>
But if someone is looking for a single technique that will make kids  <br/>
understand how important Mommy&#39;s needs are, it just isn&#39;t out  <br/>
there! ;-) Long term respect of needs that we don&#39;t understand will  <br/>
-- as children are developmentally able -- get us respect for our  <br/>
needs that the child doesn&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
To get respect for needs a child doesn&#39;t understand, we need to model  <br/>
that for them. But it&#39;s likely to fail if we&#39;re respecting them with  <br/>
the expectation of them respecting us. It works a lot better to  <br/>
respect their needs because it&#39;s a nice thing to do for someone you  <br/>
love.<br/>

them, you got frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge gap between understanding something and being able to  <br/>
control your emotions and reactions and needs. They understand the  <br/>
words &quot;This is important,&quot; but they aren&#39;t capable of dealing with  <br/>
the emotions that come up in the meantime -- or even the emotions of  <br/>
feeling that you&#39;re out of touch!<br/>
<br/>
Their *actions* are telling you something loud and clear and you want  <br/>
to not hear it because it&#39;s more convenient if they can play quietly  <br/>
for a period of time when you need them to. In 11 years -- which will  <br/>
pass faster than you think it will -- your 6 yo will be gone from the  <br/>
house and you&#39;ll have loads of time for &quot;important phone calls&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan on them needing you, you&#39;re not going to be  <br/>
disappointed. ;-) As Meredith suggested, build that into your plans.  <br/>
Help them find something to do if you know ahead of time that a phone  <br/>
call is coming. Expect that they&#39;ll need you.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you&#39;re in a place where you expect them to walk but they  <br/>
keep showing you that they aren&#39;t ready and you&#39;re getting frustrated  <br/>
that they can&#39;t and looking for ways to make them walk. The  <br/>
expectations are unreasonable. See who they are right now rather than  <br/>
looking at them through lenses of expectations.<br/>
