<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257389551">My 16 year old son wants to go to school because he feels like he&#39;s<br/>

has almost completed all her general ed requirements with straight As  <br/>

has taken college courses that interest her (including political  <br/>
science, math, and sign language along with lots of music, theater,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431823583">I just want to say that the GED test is surprisingly easy. I was<br/>
completely flunking out of school... I mean with 9s, 13s, etc.<br/>
skipping school more than half the year.. and I aced three portions of<br/>
the test and made above average scores on the rest of it. <br/>
<br/>
This is a school flunkie who did not study AT ALL, for the GED test. <br/>
<br/>
But, in order to boost his self confidence, maybe you could check out<br/>
a GED study book from the library and let him see just how hard it<br/>
will be for him. Our state also offers GED study classes to boost your<br/>
chances, before taking the test. They are free, except for the<br/>
workbooks, I think, which are like $30. Anyway, there are maybe 6<br/>
2-hour long classes and there is an instructor.. but, they don&#39;t<br/>
*teach* they are just there to help if people have questions about<br/>
things in the workbooks.</div>

Why doesn&#39;t he teach himself math with your help? I&#39;m trying to brush<br/>
up right now on the math I learned in school, so I can take the<br/>
placement test at community college. I found some great books at the<br/>
library, and many great online tutorials. One site even has videos of<br/>
what I swear is my 7th grade teacher using a dry erase board. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds almost like you&#39;re taking this as a philosophical issue,<br/>
like he&#39;s tearing down unschooling. From what you say, I hear that he<br/>
wants to feel competent and has decided on the only solution he can<br/>
think of- school. Maybe you can ask him about his concerns, his goals<br/>
for himself, and his ideas on how to get where he wants to go. If you<br/>
keep arguing with him that everything&#39;s fine when he clearly thinks<br/>
it&#39;s not, he will just keep arguing back. But if you can get on the<br/>
same side as him, you can use your greater experience to help him find<br/>
alternatives to school.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember/can anyone point to the blog entry by that kid<br/>
who tried school for a year and wrote about his experiences? He went<br/>
in with wide open eyes and was amazed by how right his parents were!<br/>
The kids were immature and ignorant, there was a lot of wasted time.<br/>
He really laid it all out there. This would be a great read for your son.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932849527">Thanks everyone for the suggestions - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not much help to him in the Math department.  I really suck at math and never got past Algebra.  I pretty much failed that.  I barely passed history, but that was with a D and it was only because my boyfriend loved history and helped me.  <br/>
<br/>
My son and I have been talking more.  He know that I dropped out of school in 11th grade for medical reasons and took my GED and passed with flying colors.  No prep or studying at all.  But he is assuming that the GED has gotten harder now.  He plays World of Warcraft a lot and has many friends that he is in contact with thru WOW and I think they may be a factor in his &quot;worry&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing that made him feel so much better is that a friend his age is doing horribly with long division and my son thinks that long division is incredibly easy - this has helped give him quite a boost!<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the advice.  We are heading to the library this weekend and I think he will probably get a GED prep book (or whatever it&#39;s called).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806245215">Hi<br/>
I&#39;m new on here (from England), with one 11 yr old son just starting to<br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note to pass on this link for an amazing website with<br/>
everything to do with math. :)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.khanacademy.org">http://www.khanacademy.org</a><br/>
<br/>
There have 700+ videos on YouTube covering everything from basic<br/>
arithmetic and algebra to differential equations, physics, and finance<br/>
which have been recorded by Salman Khan. He has also developed a free,<br/>
adaptive math program.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this might be useful<br/>

My son and I have been talking more.  He know that I dropped out of school in <br/>
11th grade for medical reasons and took my GED and passed with flying colors.  <br/>
No prep or studying at all.  But he is assuming that the GED has gotten harder <br/>
now.  He plays World of Warcraft a lot and has many friends that he is in <br/>
contact with thru WOW and I think they may be a factor in his &quot;worry&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
I took my GED in either 1999 or 2000 and it wasn&#39;t hard. This was 2 or<br/>
3 years after I dropped out of school (where I was flunking everything<br/>
anyhow), so plenty of time to forget almost everything. LOL<br/>
<br/>
The thing that makes the GED test so easy is that almost all of it is<br/>
multiple choice... and much of the test gives you context clues in<br/>
passages and such, that will help you get the right answer. Even if<br/>
you come to a hard part.. you still have a 25% chance of getting the<br/>
right answer... but, I&#39;d raise that even further because they always<br/>
put at least one answer that is so completely ridiculous that no one<br/>
would choose it. LOL</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512798692">What I am reading is that you are suggesting that:<br/>
<br/>
A) People you don&#39;t know should place arbitrary limits on their children&#39;s<br/>
activities because of your fear that they might become so full of joy with a<br/>
game that they will want nothing else when they grown up.<br/>
<br/>
B) That there is something wrong with your husband because he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
his job more than a video game.<br/>
<br/>
C) That 10 hours of joy is bad if it is in front of a video game.<br/>
<br/>
D) That you feel like their is something lacking in your husband&#39;s life due<br/>
to playing video games so much as a child.<br/>
<br/>
E) You are attempting to control an adult that you choose to marry.<br/>
<br/>
a) I feel like placing limits is more likely to create an imbalance that<br/>
will last until adulthood. I think arbitrary limits inhibit a respectful<br/>
trusting relationship between two people. I prefer to celebrate my<br/>
children&#39;s and my husband&#39;s passions and interests. I find that<br/>
participating in or sharing the joy brings more joy and friendship and love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
b) Perhaps your husband needs a more fullfilling job. One that brings joy to<br/>
him instead of sucks it from him. Perhaps the activities that you are<br/>
talking about are less interesting than the game he loves. My husband LOVES<br/>
WoW. He plays frequently. He also loves his work and family. Because he<br/>
loves and enjoys them all he finds balance.<br/>
<br/>
c) If someone found 10 straight hours of joy while reading would that be ok?<br/>
If someone found 10 straight hours of joy at church would that be ok? If<br/>
someone found 10 hours of joy working on physics problems? Why would one<br/>
passion or pursuit be better than another?<br/>
<br/>
d) You husband is exactly who he needs to be right now at this moment.<br/>
Regret is a waste of energy and a vacuum to joy. Sure my life would have<br/>
been different if xy or z didn;t happen. Reality is that xyz did happen, it<br/>
shaped who I am. I like who I am. If I regret those things I am expressing a<br/>
dissatisfaction with who I AM. Instead if I don&#39;t like something I am doing<br/>
I changer that.<br/>
<br/>
e) I thing trying to control your husband (or children) is just going to<br/>
cause resentment and anger. Perhaps you could find a way to celebrate his<br/>
video game obsession. Bring him special food while he plays, sit next to him<br/>
and rub his shoulders that must be stressed from working a job he doesn&#39;t<br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823693306">I&#39;m not going to say that someone should impose limits on another person<br/>
and I strongly believe in supporting my kids&#39; and wife&#39;s passions. I&#39;ll also<br/>
say that some of you have never met someone suffering from video game<br/>
addiction. Some people (I&#39;m one of them) have seriously addictive<br/>
mentalities and find the virtual world such an incredible escape from the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; world that they completely check out. The built-in systems of<br/>
activities and small rewards are more than entertaining to some and become<br/>
an extremely addictive driver of behavior. There are countless documented<br/>
cases of people losing their jobs, failing school (I know, who cares right?)<br/>
and even divorced due to video game addiction and the resulting neglect of<br/>
everything and everyone around. People have even died from starvation or<br/>
malnutrition while playing WoW, LotR, Everquest, UO, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and hopefully add some credibility to my story by<br/>
saying that my wife and I played WoW for almost 2 years together. We<br/>
experienced at least 8-10 hours of &quot;joy&quot; every day during that period. I<br/>
played at work, we played together at home, we played when the kids were<br/>
sleeping, awake, eating, you name it. The leveling, resource gathering,<br/>
quests, raids, and rep grinding were all we thought about day and night. We<br/>
lost touch with every real world friend we had known save one, despite how<br/>
much they expressed concern for us. Between me and my wife we gained 100<br/>
pounds. It really didn&#39;t matter because there was always another purple epic<br/>
sword or staff our mount or raid boss to conquer. One day we left the water<br/>
running while playing and the entire upstairs of our house filled with<br/>
water. When we got up from playing at 4am (I had to be at work at 7am), the<br/>
carpet in our office was like a marsh. We only played 6 months more after<br/>
that happened.<br/>
<br/>
As a kid, I played dozens of similar games, the most notable being the<br/>
Ultima 1 - Ultima 8 series. The difference with these games is that they all<br/>
had an ending where the game can be beaten or won. The last game I &quot;won&quot; was<br/>
Ultima 4 which took me about 2 months playing every day after school. This<br/>
was in 1985. Once the game was over, it was back to the real world for a<br/>
while for a &quot;reality check&quot;. With WoW, the game never ever ends and you can<br/>
never obtain or attain the highest levels of gear and proficiencies no<br/>
matter how many thousands of hours you commit to it. If you are &quot;casual&quot;<br/>
then you might have a great social time, but your progress will stop hard at<br/>
some point. The amount of time commitment during what is unfortunately<br/>
called the &quot;end game&quot; stage increases exponentially and this is a common<br/>
formula among most MMORPGs.<br/>
<br/>
Are the games fun, yes of course! But, video game addiction is as real as<br/>
alchoholism or gambling addiction. I&#39;ve met hundreds of in-game addicts. If<br/>
there is someone in your life who has stopped eating, bathing, or leaving<br/>
the house, you have a right to be concerned (even if they are just reading<br/>
books I would argue).  Should you force your will on others? No way. Anyone<br/>
who known an alchoholic will tell you the first step to recovery is<br/>
recognizing you have a problem. Tell your husband/wife/kids that you miss<br/>
them and the types of interactions you used to have together. Ultimately<br/>
there needs to be a balance between the video game and the people, places,<br/>
things and SELF that you care about in your real world.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing at all bad about playing WoW. It is an incredible world to<br/>
explore. I have been back to Azeroth a few times in the past 2-3 years but I<br/>
don&#39;t find it very fun because I&#39;m not willing to put in the time to<br/>
&quot;succeed&quot; and my friends are all once again in the real world. I would<br/>
encourage people to try out WoW even though I wasn&#39;t able to hold my<br/>
conjured glacier water and murloc fin soup.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;   What I am reading is that you are suggesting that:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A) People you don&#39;t know should place arbitrary limits on their children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; activities because of your fear that they might become so full of joy with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; game that they will want nothing else when they grown up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; B) That there is something wrong with your husband because he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; his job more than a video game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; C) That 10 hours of joy is bad if it is in front of a video game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; D) That you feel like their is something lacking in your husband&#39;s life due<br/>
&gt; to playing video games so much as a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; E) You are attempting to control an adult that you choose to marry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a) I feel like placing limits is more likely to create an imbalance that<br/>
&gt; will last until adulthood. I think arbitrary limits inhibit a respectful<br/>
&gt; trusting relationship between two people. I prefer to celebrate my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s and my husband&#39;s passions and interests. I find that<br/>
&gt; participating in or sharing the joy brings more joy and friendship and<br/>
&gt; love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; b) Perhaps your husband needs a more fullfilling job. One that brings joy<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; him instead of sucks it from him. Perhaps the activities that you are<br/>
&gt; talking about are less interesting than the game he loves. My husband LOVES<br/>
&gt; WoW. He plays frequently. He also loves his work and family. Because he<br/>
&gt; loves and enjoys them all he finds balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; c) If someone found 10 straight hours of joy while reading would that be<br/>
&gt; ok?<br/>
&gt; If someone found 10 straight hours of joy at church would that be ok? If<br/>
&gt; someone found 10 hours of joy working on physics problems? Why would one<br/>
&gt; passion or pursuit be better than another?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; d) You husband is exactly who he needs to be right now at this moment.<br/>
&gt; Regret is a waste of energy and a vacuum to joy. Sure my life would have<br/>
&gt; been different if xy or z didn;t happen. Reality is that xyz did happen, it<br/>
&gt; shaped who I am. I like who I am. If I regret those things I am expressing<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; dissatisfaction with who I AM. Instead if I don&#39;t like something I am doing<br/>
&gt; I changer that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; e) I thing trying to control your husband (or children) is just going to<br/>
&gt; cause resentment and anger. Perhaps you could find a way to celebrate his<br/>
&gt; video game obsession. Bring him special food while he plays, sit next to<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; and rub his shoulders that must be stressed from working a job he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; love.<br/>

This is a board for unschoolers and those on the path towards unschooling.<br/>
We are aiming towards respectful parenting and loving partnerships. Stopping<br/>
children from playing video games because they might become addicts is as<br/>
ridiculous as stopping your children from eating because they might become<br/>

 <br/>
To me, this really highlights the concept of working through the fears we as parents may have, in order to fully respect and support the interests of our kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
Comparing the results of growing up in an alcoholic, chaotic, home to being raised in a peaceful, joyful, mindful, respectful, home, is no more helpful than comparing apples to bananas.  This kind of comparing just feeds the fear we are trying to understand and heal, and in turn offer our kids something better.  I still have a little (very unhelpful!) voice in my head that comes to life every time my girls have watched more than about 3 hours of tv at once, and I&#39;m still a work in progress.  I don&#39;t know about you, but my kids having *more* of everything than what I received as a child (respect, freedom, etc.), *really* pushes my buttons sometimes!<br/>
 <br/>
The people on this list who have older kids, and who have parented mindfully, are the ones to look to for what results come from mindful, respectful, unschooly parenting.  Let&#39;s ask Joyce, and Kelly, and Ren, and Rue, and a host of others here with older kids what the results are  - I have a feeling their kids are turning out just fine :).<br/>

<br/>
One thing you might want to consider, though, is that the life of an  <br/>
unschooled child is one in which there is a rich tapestry of  <br/>
experience offered and tremendous support provided by the parents.  <br/>
Playing video games in that environment is not escapism, it is a  <br/>
choice to do something for the love of it. Moving positively toward  <br/>
something (choosing to play video games for the pure joy of it) is  <br/>
very very different than moving away from something (playing video  <br/>
games to avoid facing problems in one&#39;s life).<br/>
<br/>
Still, I feel for you and I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re facing such problems.<br/>

Here is your link. Looks like it was Starcraft and not WoW, sorry about<br/>
that. I know, it&#39;s an isolated instance. He had all the joy he could handle<br/>

Faith,<br/>
My education mostly predates unschooling. I was not &quot;nurtured and supported&quot;<br/>
by my dad who died in 1983 and my mom who has not spoken to me since our<br/>
first child was born in 2001. I don&#39;t blame them and I don&#39;t blame WoW<br/>
either. I had some issues to work through that it sounds like your kids will<br/>
never know. Despite all of that, there are in fact people (~4% of WoW<br/>
players) who play more than 80 hours per week. Probably most of them are<br/>
escaping something as I did to some degree. Probably none of them are<br/>
unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere did I or would I discourage people from playing WoW or other games.<br/>
But for some people on here to say that there is no such thing as gaming<br/>
addiction, internet addiction is ridiculous. Further, to call me names for<br/>
sharing a personal experience that is obviously not my proudest time doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel unschooly to me either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215269007">Thanks Pam, this is basically the point I was trying to make. Escapism is<br/>
often the cause of addiction. Unschooling, although wonderful is not magic.<br/>
It&#39;s still possible that kids could become unhappy or depressed and escape<br/>
into drugs, video games, or something else entirely. If done properly,<br/>
unschooling should give all the options of the world and alleviate most<br/>
sources of unhappiness in a typical child&#39;s life (bullying, homework, fear<br/>
of failure, ...). But to say, &quot;that could never happen to my child&quot; is naive<br/>
and insulting to kids who might really be suffering from depression or other<br/>
issues beyond the direct visibility of the parents.<br/>

depression. The behavior is a symptom not a cause. Removing what is  <br/>
used as an alleviator doesn&#39;t remove the cause.<br/>
<br/>
In fact if there&#39;s enough fear and control from the parents it might  <br/>
cause depression. Feeling out of control and fearful are certainly  <br/>
good reasons for escape.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parent shouldn&#39;t assume escapism from behavior. A  <br/>
unschooling parent should be involved in their child&#39;s world enough  <br/>
to know what&#39;s going on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why we discuss relationships so much and help parents stay  <br/>
connected to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re reading the surface of the responses and seeing people  <br/>
*only* say &quot;Let your kids play as much as they want,&quot; you need to  <br/>
read more and deeper. The goal is to help kids be happy. Happy isn&#39;t  <br/>
achieved when parents detach from kids to let them do whatever they  <br/>
want. That&#39;s neglect. Happy is helped by remaining connected.  <br/>
Connected might be playing with them, learning enough to have  <br/>
conversations, bringing them food, finding other kids to play with,  <br/>
helping them find cheats and walkthroughs on line, buying the gaming  <br/>
magazines and guides, going to conventions, helping them take breaks  <br/>
at a convenient pause point to go to the bathroom, and for kids who  <br/>
are carrying the tension of play into life a parent can help them  <br/>
become more aware and find strategies to sidetrack it before it grows  <br/>
so large they can&#39;t handle it. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and mindful parenting is *very* hands on.<br/>

<br/>
*Why* did he play to the point of death? The game didn&#39;t do it. It  <br/>
was whatever was going on in his life that drove him to want to  <br/>
commit suicide.<br/>
<br/>
It muddles thinking to see two identical surface behaviors (many  <br/>
hours of game playing) and assume there&#39;s a connection. What is  <br/>
causing the behavior is the key, not the behavior itself.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t take away everything that someone might use to commit  <br/>
suicide! To prevent suicide people need to get to the root causes.  <br/>
It&#39;s possible if there were no video games he wouldn&#39;t have had the  <br/>
courage to kill himself another way. But should society&#39;s inability  <br/>
to support someone who is spiraling down into depression mean we  <br/>
should deprive millions of people who happily play games because they  <br/>
enjoy them?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not going to say that someone should impose limits on another person<br/>
and I strongly believe in supporting my kids&#39; and wife&#39;s passions. I&#39;ll also<br/>
say that some of you have never met someone suffering from video game<br/>
addiction. Some people (I&#39;m one of them) have seriously addictive<br/>
mentalities and find the virtual world such an incredible escape from the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; world that they completely check out. The built-in systems of<br/>
activities and small rewards are more than entertaining to some and become<br/>
an extremely addictive driver of behavior. There are countless documented<br/>
cases of people losing their jobs, failing school (I know, who cares right?)<br/>
and even divorced due to video game addiction and the resulting neglect of<br/>
everything and everyone around. People have even died from starvation or<br/>
malnutrition while playing WoW, LotR, Everquest, UO, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and hopefully add some credibility to my story by<br/>
saying that my wife and I played WoW for almost 2 years together. We<br/>
experienced at least 8-10 hours of &quot;joy&quot; every day during that period. I<br/>
played at work, we played together at home, we played when the kids were<br/>
sleeping, awake, eating, you name it. The leveling, resource gathering,<br/>
quests, raids, and rep grinding were all we thought about day and night. We<br/>
lost touch with every real world friend we had known save one, despite how<br/>
much they expressed concern for us. Between me and my wife we gained 100<br/>
pounds. It really didn&#39;t matter because there was always another purple epic<br/>
sword or staff our mount or raid boss to conquer. One day we left the water<br/>
running while playing and the entire upstairs of our house filled with<br/>
water. When we got up from playing at 4am (I had to be at work at 7am), the<br/>
carpet in our office was like a marsh. We only played 6 months more after<br/>
that happened.<br/>
<br/>
As a kid, I played dozens of similar games, the most notable being the<br/>
Ultima 1 - Ultima 8 series. The difference with these games is that they all<br/>
had an ending where the game can be beaten or won. The last game I &quot;won&quot; was<br/>
Ultima 4 which took me about 2 months playing every day after school. This<br/>
was in 1985. Once the game was over, it was back to the real world for a<br/>
while for a &quot;reality check&quot;. With WoW, the game never ever ends and you can<br/>
never obtain or attain the highest levels of gear and proficiencies no<br/>
matter how many thousands of hours you commit to it. If you are &quot;casual&quot;<br/>
then you might have a great social time, but your progress will stop hard at<br/>
some point. The amount of time commitment during what is unfortunately<br/>
called the &quot;end game&quot; stage increases exponentially and this is a common<br/>
formula among most MMORPGs.<br/>
<br/>
Are the games fun, yes of course! But, video game addiction is as real as<br/>
alchoholism or gambling addiction. I&#39;ve met hundreds of in-game addicts. If<br/>
there is someone in your life who has stopped eating, bathing, or leaving<br/>
the house, you have a right to be concerned (even if they are just reading<br/>
books I would argue). Should you force your will on others? No way. Anyone<br/>
who known an alchoholic will tell you the first step to recovery is<br/>
recognizing you have a problem. Tell your husband/wife/ kids that you miss<br/>
them and the types of interactions you used to have together. Ultimately<br/>
there needs to be a balance between the video game and the people, places,<br/>
things and SELF that you care about in your real world.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing at all bad about playing WoW. It is an incredible world to<br/>
explore. I have been back to Azeroth a few times in the past 2-3 years but I<br/>
don&#39;t find it very fun because I&#39;m not willing to put in the time to<br/>
&quot;succeed&quot; and my friends are all once again in the real world. I would<br/>
encourage people to try out WoW even though I wasn&#39;t able to hold my<br/>
conjured glacier water and murloc fin soup.<br/>

&gt; What I am reading is that you are suggesting that:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A) People you don&#39;t know should place arbitrary limits on their children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; activities because of your fear that they might become so full of joy with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; game that they will want nothing else when they grown up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; B) That there is something wrong with your husband because he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; his job more than a video game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; C) That 10 hours of joy is bad if it is in front of a video game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; D) That you feel like their is something lacking in your husband&#39;s life due<br/>
&gt; to playing video games so much as a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; E) You are attempting to control an adult that you choose to marry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a) I feel like placing limits is more likely to create an imbalance that<br/>
&gt; will last until adulthood. I think arbitrary limits inhibit a respectful<br/>
&gt; trusting relationship between two people. I prefer to celebrate my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s and my husband&#39;s passions and interests. I find that<br/>
&gt; participating in or sharing the joy brings more joy and friendship and<br/>
&gt; love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; b) Perhaps your husband needs a more fullfilling job. One that brings joy<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; him instead of sucks it from him. Perhaps the activities that you are<br/>
&gt; talking about are less interesting than the game he loves. My husband LOVES<br/>
&gt; WoW. He plays frequently. He also loves his work and family. Because he<br/>
&gt; loves and enjoys them all he finds balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; c) If someone found 10 straight hours of joy while reading would that be<br/>
&gt; ok?<br/>
&gt; If someone found 10 straight hours of joy at church would that be ok? If<br/>
&gt; someone found 10 hours of joy working on physics problems? Why would one<br/>
&gt; passion or pursuit be better than another?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; d) You husband is exactly who he needs to be right now at this moment.<br/>
&gt; Regret is a waste of energy and a vacuum to joy. Sure my life would have<br/>
&gt; been different if xy or z didn;t happen. Reality is that xyz did happen, it<br/>
&gt; shaped who I am. I like who I am. If I regret those things I am expressing<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; dissatisfaction with who I AM. Instead if I don&#39;t like something I am doing<br/>
&gt; I changer that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; e) I thing trying to control your husband (or children) is just going to<br/>
&gt; cause resentment and anger. Perhaps you could find a way to celebrate his<br/>
&gt; video game obsession. Bring him special food while he plays, sit next to<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; and rub his shoulders that must be stressed from working a job he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; love.<br/>

raped as my first sexual experience and I have an anxiety and personality<br/>

moving forward to be the best parent I can for my children. I do not use<br/>

&gt; players) who play more than 80 hours per week. Probably most of them are<br/>
&gt; escaping something as I did to some degree. Probably none of them are<br/>
&gt; unschooled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nowhere did I or would I discourage people from playing WoW or other games.<br/>
&gt; But for some people on here to say that there is no such thing as gaming<br/>
&gt; addiction, internet addiction is ridiculous. Further, to call me names for<br/>
&gt; sharing a personal experience that is obviously not my proudest time<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel unschooly to me either.<br/>

&gt; I took my GED in either 1999 or 2000 and it wasn&#39;t hard. This was 2 or<br/>
&gt; 3 years after I dropped out of school (where I was flunking everything<br/>
&gt; anyhow), so plenty of time to forget almost everything. LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I took my GED when I was 16, too. It really was easy, though I did<br/>
take a prep class. However, I have so rarely come across any occasions<br/>
where it did me any good, I really question why I did it at all. I<br/>
mean, if he wants to go to college, I think he should do it. But a GED<br/>
is not much of a goal in itself because as an adult, no-one questions<br/>
whether I finished high school or not. There are so few jobs where<br/>
they are going to check and see if you graduated high school. What<br/>
does he see doing in the future he&#39;s imagining? If it involves<br/>
anything with more requirements than grocery store cashier or factory<br/>
worker, you could help him to stop sweating the small stuff. Because<br/>
learning the kind of basic math they test for on the GED probably<br/>
won&#39;t be all that hard for him, and is just one step of the journey.</div>
