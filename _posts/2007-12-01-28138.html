<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326747577">My name is Angel and I need some help and advice.  I have an 11yr old <br/>
boy who has always been homeschooled.  He spent one year in preschool <br/>
when he was 4 but didn&#39;t like it.  <br/>
<br/>
My trouble is that he was home outside playing in our front yard (we <br/>
live in a subdivision on a cul-de-sac street) on Thursday late <br/>
afternoon when a girl and two other children we don&#39;t know came along <br/>
riding thier bikes thru our court.  The story from my son is that the <br/>
girl came up to him and asked him if he wanted to fight.  She started <br/>
to kick at him and he punched her in the face and she fell down and <br/>
then got up and kicked him again and ran home.  The police were <br/>
called and a report was filed.  I think the girl ended up at the <br/>
hospital for a checkup to see if she was alright.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is my question.  When you have a homeschool/unschooled child <br/>
when do they learn to get along with others.  This is not his first <br/>
time in a fight but he is not going around looking for one either.  <br/>
They seem to come to him.  He is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs <br/>
about 150-160lbs.  He is very big for his age and I think that <br/>
intimidates alot of kids.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I help him get along with others when we don&#39;t usually meet <br/>
with too many people?  We do belong to a homeschool group and meet <br/>
once a month for park day.  Any suggestions would be great and anyone <br/>
who has raised a teenage boy with helpful tips would be appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Angel</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534760990">I don&#39;t find it implausible. We lived in an area where my dd was<br/>
confronted by the same thing at a much younger age. We were unable to<br/>
move immediately and had to deal with it, Even where we live now,<br/>
which is a &quot;nice&quot; area our next door neighbors would beat my (then) 4<br/>
y/o up (they were 11 and 12) for no reason. So we just don&#39;t go out<br/>
when they are out anymore. And I can&#39;t let him out with his sister,<br/>
w/o me in our own backyard. We are moving but things take time, We<br/>
just talk to our kids a lot. Anyway, it is definitely not implausible,<br/>
nor is it easy or practical to just pack up and move.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319538029">We live in a very nice area.  Nothing like this has happened before.  <br/>
He got into a tousle with a boy a couple of days ago when this boy <br/>
took our ball away from our daughter(7yr).  Justin our son, got the <br/>
ball back but pushed the kid to do it.  I think this boy may have <br/>
asked this girl to come into our area and pick a fight.  <br/>
<br/>
We are military and awaiting orders to move so that will happen in <br/>
the next 6 months or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I have told him about jail in the past and I think he always thought <br/>
it could not happen to me.  Now that the officer has been here he is <br/>
more aware that things can happen to him.  <br/>
<br/>
We have always homeschooled him eclectic style.  We have tried <br/>
Charlotte Mason with him and he is loving it.  I would love to go the <br/>
unschooling route but I get scared they aren&#39;t learning enough and <br/>
then I start with studies again.  I thought that joining this group <br/>
may give me the courage to trust them more as well as myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Angel<br/>
