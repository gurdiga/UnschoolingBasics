<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844448904">Hello to any and all lovely unchoolers in the Milwaukee area!<br/>
<br/>
We are going to be in the area the first week of June for the Bead and<br/>
Button show. We found an amazing deal for a hotel ($40 downtown at a 3<br/>
1/2 star!) but the parking price is crazy. We have an extra ticket<br/>
into the show and were wondering if anyone would like to trade an out<br/>
of town free parking spot and the ride to and from for the free<br/>
ticket, some free beads and some unschooling fun involving beads,<br/>
jewelry and the business thereof (if desired). We love talking about<br/>
and showing off our beads.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly our kids opted to stay home. They are sufficiently bored of long<br/>
days at bead shows.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much if you can help!<br/>
<br/>
Jean Elizabeth and Esther<br/>
