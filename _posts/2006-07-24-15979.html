<div id="ygrps-yiv-226058269">Yes Deb, it would be pretty catastrophic if Mars were that close. I<br/>
went and read at the NASA site some more, it&#39;s pretty interesting.<br/>
Apparently, this close encounter will look pretty much the same as it<br/>
did in &#39;03, to the naked eye:<br/>
<br/>
Here are the facts: Earth and Mars are converging for a close<br/>
encounter this year on October 30th at 0319 Universal Time. Distance:<br/>
69 million kilometers. To the unaided eye, Mars will look like a<br/>
bright red star, a pinprick of light, certainly not as wide as the<br/>
full Moon.<br/>
<br/>
Disappointed? Don&#39;t be. If Mars did come close enough to rival the<br/>
Moon, its gravity would alter Earth&#39;s orbit and raise terrible tides.<br/>
<br/>
Sixty-nine million km is good. At that distance, Mars shines brighter<br/>
than anything else in the sky except the Sun, the Moon and Venus. The<br/>
visual magnitude of Mars on Oct. 30, 2005, will be -2.3. Even<br/>
inattentive sky watchers will notice it, rising at sundown and soaring<br/>
overhead at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
You might remember another encounter with Mars, about two years ago,<br/>
on August 27, 2003. That was the closest in recorded history, by a<br/>
whisker, and millions of people watched as the distance between Mars<br/>
and Earth shrunk to 56 million km. This October&#39;s encounter, at 69<br/>
million km, is similar. To casual observers, Mars will seem about as<br/>
bright and beautiful in 2005 as it was in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Although closest approach is still months away, Mars is already<br/>
conspicuous in the early morning. Before the sun comes up, it&#39;s the<br/>
brightest object in the eastern sky, really eye-catching. If you have<br/>
a telescope, even a small one, point it at Mars. You can see the<br/>
bright icy South Polar Cap and strange dark markings on the planet&#39;s<br/>
surface.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506658390">Check the page again - they&#39;re talking about Oct. 30th, *2005*<br/>
<br/>
Unless you&#39;re planning on hopping in the DeLorean with Dr. Brown, I&#39;d<br/>
say you&#39;re a little late.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, Mars at its maximum visual magnitude is only about half as<br/>
bright as Venus at its peak, and about 1/6th the brightness of the<br/>
moon.  Note also that magnitude does not equal size, only apparent<br/>
brightness.<br/>
