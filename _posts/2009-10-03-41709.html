<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933216413">Is relocation an option? Do you have a survivor benefit income that would allow you to work only part-time, or not at all if you can find a more affordable living situation?<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine -- a widowed, unschooling Mom --  relocated from CA to NM because the cost of living is lower.  Between the equity on her California home and her Social Security Widow and Surviving Child benefit, she&#39;s been able to stay home with her son.<br/>
<br/>
Look at all your options -- relocation, co-housing, working from home, (I&#39;ve seen each of those work for widowed/never married unschooling Moms) and be willing to try anything that supports your goal of being able to give your daughter the life you want for her.<br/>
