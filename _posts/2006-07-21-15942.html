<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642412405">I am posting this for a member that wishes to remain anonymous on the<br/>
following post:<br/>
<br/>
I have a situation I&#39;d like feedback on. I need/want convincing on<br/>
something. My oldest and I can get into power struggles. Big time.<br/>
Much less now that we are on this unschooling road, thankfully, but<br/>
it still does happen, none the less. Tonight, he left the basement<br/>
light and fan on. I wanted him to go down and shut it off. He was in<br/>
his bedroom, playing his DS. I asked him to and he said he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go up and down the stairs again. I feel the old tapes in my<br/>
head not wanting to cater to him and shut it off.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why I NEED to shut it off and not pick this silly battle.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302965196">Can I answer your question with a question? :-)<br/>
<br/>
How would you have reacted if this was your husband who had left the fan and<br/>
light on? Would you even consider this a power struggle? If it had been my<br/>
dh I would have turned the light and fan off and maybe mentioned to my dh<br/>
that he forgot to turn the fan/light off *again*. I would probably not<br/>
mention it only because I would forget to. Would you feel it catering if you<br/>
turned off the fan/light for your husband? Or would you just do it to help<br/>
him out because he obviously forgot? Changing the roles around helped me a<br/>
great deal when I wanted to parent more mindfully. How would I treat my dh<br/>
or best friend or mom if it was the same situation? <br/>

<br/>
It sounds like you already know this from a logical point of view, but<br/>
your emotions haven&#39;t caught up yet. That&#39;s really normal.<br/>
I KNOW with all of my being how certain issues are best handled. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop old emotions from rising up at weak moments.  I guess I&#39;m<br/>
being made more aware of that baggage this last couple of weeks, as<br/>
Jalen has been having a really rough time of it.<br/>
<br/>
We can KNOW exactly how we would like to react ideally, yet emotional<br/>
baggage rears it&#39;s ugly head. I like to use internal dialogues in<br/>
moments like this. As Dawn mentioned, pretending like it was your<br/>
partner might help shift the perspective in the moment.  I do that, or<br/>
I talk to myself and question why/where/how this feeling is surging<br/>
up. My kids have no idea how many times I talk to my inner self and<br/>
try to resolve issues before something pops out of my mouth or<br/>
manifests itself in some other lame way.;)<br/>
<br/>
Another tool in my toolbox is asking myself whether this issue would<br/>
be worth taking a stand on if myself or my child was gone tomorrow.<br/>
Most issues aren&#39;t worth making a big deal about in light of that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a bathroom off a bright hall. As I&#39;m leaving there isn&#39;t a  <br/>
visual clue that the light is still on and I&#39;ve left it on as often  <br/>
as turned it off.<br/>
<br/>
How should the family get me to turn it off? Should they call me down  <br/>
from upstairs to turn it off? Should they get angry that I&#39;ve left it  <br/>
on again? Should they give me black star when I leave it on and gold  <br/>
when I turn it off?<br/>
<br/>
Would any of those work for you?<br/>
<br/>
How about if they saw it on they just turned it off? What if  <br/>
conserving electricity was the goal rather than training someone else  <br/>
to conserve electricity. (Especially since I already *want* to  <br/>
conserve electricity.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids honestly and truly tend to be unaware of their environment. As  <br/>
unaware as I am of the light in the bathroom behind me. They are so  <br/>
focused on what they&#39;re doing that they don&#39;t see what&#39;s around them.  <br/>
(Or don&#39;t see it in the same way as we do.) He probably will be more  <br/>
aware as he gets older but maybe it&#39;s just his personality and he  <br/>
won&#39;t. Calling him down to turn off the light won&#39;t make him aware.  <br/>
It won&#39;t change his personality. But it sure will make him irritated!  <br/>
And maybe you&#39;ll train him to associate the irritation with  <br/>
conserving electricity and he&#39;ll be determined to leave lights on as  <br/>
much as possible!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask yourself &quot;What if this is one of the moments he remembers  <br/>
from his childhood? Do I want him remembering me for this?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372430573">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I can strongly recommend the book of Eckhart Tolle about this issue.<br/>
<br/>
It is not your Being that responds to this situation but your ego. And <br/>
ego is always about struggle, fight, right and wrong and so on...<br/>
<br/>
I read this book and it taught me to see when I move from within and <br/>
when I move out of the cramps of ego.<br/>
<br/>
Hth,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137779687">Another tool that has helped me in these moments of frustration is<br/>
practicing observation of my feelings. Without trying to come up with<br/>
ANY solution, or fix anything in the moment, just noticing the<br/>
feelings that are surging up.<br/>
I feel them, question their origins and just let the frustration (or<br/>
feelings of being ignored, disrespected etc..) be noticed. After a<br/>
minute or two of feeling it, I notice it subsides a bit. Usually,<br/>
after being in this observation mode for a while, the feeling goes<br/>
away completely and I can really see solutions very clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Usually it&#39;s not about whatever seems to be frustrating me in the<br/>
moment. The dirty dishes (that nobody rinsed and are now like glue),<br/>
or puddle of water in front of the fridge (because somebody let ice<br/>
drop from the ice maker and didn&#39;t pick it up, so I&#39;ve stepped in a<br/>
puddle of cold water again) are not really the issues at ALL.  It&#39;s<br/>
the feelings I associate with those issues.....mostly because of my<br/>
past training.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can re-train our ingrained reactions to a large<br/>
degree...but when the ingrained reaction causes a strong emotion to<br/>
well up, I can still choose to simply observe myself, rather than react.<br/>
<br/>
The book &quot;Wherever you go, there you are&quot; helped me with this a lot.<br/>
Any of Jon Kabat-Zinn&#39;s books are fabulous.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106336350">I can&#39;t thank you all enough for being here, and so willingly sharing your experiences.  I understand this issue oh so well, and have to admit that my emotional baggage often pops out before my logic can take over, but I&#39;m working on it.  I like the dh suggestion.  I&#39;ve tried to stop and think how I would react if it was someone else&#39;s child--would I be more understanding or patient?  Thanks again!  Back to lurkdom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203638870"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Tell me why I NEED to shut it off and not pick this silly battle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get sucked into these emotional battles too.  Suddenly, it is not just <br/>
about turning off a light, it is this HUGE BIG DEAL and if I do it for <br/>
the kid then I am being MANIPULATED.  But I had a lightbulb moment a few <br/>
weeks ago when my niece (yes - the same one who was getting sick because <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to help when we were camping) pulled it on my 5 yo dd.<br/>
<br/>
What happened was this:  My dd came running into the house and left the <br/>
front door open.  Dear Niece (who is 9 BTW) walks into the front room, <br/>
sees it open and then begins this long and loud spiel. &quot;AUDREY!  <br/>
AUDREY!  Get in here right now!&quot;  Audrey comes running.  &quot;YOU left the <br/>
front door open!  What do you think???? Is it going to CLOSE by <br/>
itself??  YOU get over there and close it right now&quot;   Audrey is in <br/>
tears now and closes the door and runs  to me crying.  I was on my way <br/>
to stop the conversation but was too late.  I ended up telling my dn <br/>
that we don&#39;t talk to each other like that in this house and that if she <br/>
wants the door closed, just go over and close the door.  No need to make <br/>
someone cry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing my niece pull this on my daughter made me realize just how absurd <br/>
this type of behavior is.  Like someone said, focus on the goal of <br/>
turning of the light or closing the door.  This is so easy to accomplish <br/>
and no one needs to end up crying or getting mad over it.  I think the <br/>
only reason we adults pull this kind of behavior is because we were <br/>
treated this way as children.  As I listened to my niece, I thought &quot;Oh! <br/>
So that is how they talk to her at her house!  How horrible!&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Exactly!!<br/>
My dh has this thing about &quot;who left the mayonaisse out?&quot; (or milk or<br/>
whatever) rather than just putting it back in the damn FRIDGE!! Which<br/>
is the whole point right?<br/>
I see him spend more energy trying to track down who did it (just to<br/>
tell them to put it away) than simply opening the door and sticking it<br/>
IN. I laugh at him (not in a mean way, but a baffled way) and just put<br/>
it away for him then say &quot;ok, now you can go figure out who did it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t do that as often now.:)<br/>

 Tonight, he left the basement<br/>
 light and fan on. I wanted him to go down and shut it off. He was in<br/>
 his bedroom, playing his DS. I asked him to and he said he didn&#39;t<br/>
 want to go up and down the stairs again. I feel the old tapes in my<br/>
 head not wanting to cater to him and shut it off.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  So, did you ASK him? Was it a *request*? May he not say no? Why not? <br/>
May you say no, at *his* next request? Why?<br/>
<br/>
  Did he scream &quot;NO, I never will, and you can&#39;t make me!&quot;? Or did he <br/>
really just say that he didn&#39;t want to go up and down the stairs again. <br/>
Is that not reason enough? Is that a good enough reason for you or your <br/>
husband? Why? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
  If he lost the use of his legs, would that be enough of a reason? If <br/>
he were in a coma? If he leaves home because he thinks you&#39;re so <br/>
unreasonable? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Wouldn&#39;t it be better in the long run for him to see you do it out of <br/>
kindness? That way he&#39;ll learn to do things for *you* (and others) out <br/>
of kindness. Things done out of obligation or with bitterness---hell, <br/>
I&#39;d rather they not be done at all! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Because your relationship is more important than who turns out the <br/>
light.<br/>

  I sent an earlier e-mail about installing another switch. Seriously <br/>
consider that. It&#39;s not that expensive, and it could save a bunch of <br/>
steps and some anger too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>
