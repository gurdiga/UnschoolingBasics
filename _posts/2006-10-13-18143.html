<div id="ygrps-yiv-519470129">I&#39;m new to this site and fairly new to unschooling also, we have been &quot;practicing&quot; <br/>
unschooling for approx. 6 months.  My dh & I have a 4.5 year old and a 12 month old.  We <br/>
have totally embraced the &quot;discipline&quot; philosphy of unschooling, mostly modeling how we <br/>
want our sons to act.  For the most part we don&#39;t have conflicts in the house (occasionally <br/>
between the two, which just seems age appropriate at this time).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway my question has to do with the non negotiables concerning our 4.5 year olds <br/>
behavior when it is affecting another child&#39;s.  We aren&#39;t around other kids a whole lot, and <br/>
when we are he tends to get agressive at times.  What I&#39;ve noticed is that he does very well <br/>
with older kids that he associates with, but it is the younger kids that he seems to <br/>
overpower or get frustrated with.  How do you deal with agressive behavior?  Our son is <br/>
able to pretty much do what he wants when he wants when it doesn&#39;t concern hurting <br/>
another person, but when I step in under the latter situation he gets very defensive saying <br/>
&quot;I can do whatever I want to do&quot;, and I try telling him &quot;not when it concerns another <br/>
person&quot;.  I try to be positive and give him alternatives of what he can do, but sometimes <br/>
he literally seems out of control and can&#39;t redirect himself.  I know that sometimes he just <br/>
gets overwhelmed with other kids in general and if we are at home he will hop on the <br/>
computer or ask to watch a video to kind of take a break from the other children.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday a friend of mine came over with her two kids (3 and 10 months), and he was <br/>
getting agressive with both kids, which is unusual because he is usually very good with <br/>
babies, but he pulled on the baby&#39;s shirt at one point and even pushed her over once.  <br/>
Also at one point he was &quot;riding&quot; this plastic snail we have in the backyard very close to <br/>
the baby and I tried to move him away saying &quot;let&#39;s ride the snail over here so we don&#39;t <br/>
accidentally hit the baby&quot; and it turned into a power struggle of him moving it back to be <br/>
near the baby. <br/>
<br/>
How do you react in these types of situations?  What are some good ways to dialogue with <br/>
the child during an intense conflict?  Sometimes I&#39;m just at a loss and then feel like he is <br/>
getting away with inappropriate behaviors (I know not a good way to look at the situation).  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated,<br/>
<br/>

Hi Julie.  I&#39;m not going to be able to address the whole issue,  because my <br/>
4.5 year old was aggressive *most* of the time, not just *some* of  the time.  <br/>
LOL!<br/>
 <br/>
So, here are some thoughts.  First, is it possible to avoid these  <br/>
problematic situations for awhile?  At that age, there were only a very few  people we <br/>
could hang around and those moms were sympathetic to the issue.   If you still <br/>
need to go, you need to have some strategies in place for dealing  with the <br/>
problem.  For us, we needed to be able to leave or have the others  be able to <br/>
leave (without hurt feelings).  Usually, we would do things like  go someplace <br/>
neutral like the park (at non-busy times).<br/>
 <br/>
It seems like you are doing well with redirecting and such, but at times he  <br/>
is not able to respond.  I would do everything right now to *not* get to  that <br/>
point.  Have you read &quot;the Explosive Child&quot;?  In a nutshell, that  part of <br/>
the brain can take some time to develop, so give him the time to  grow without <br/>
putting him in the situations that trigger the problem.<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if some &quot;mirror talk&quot; would help him with the &quot;I can do what I  <br/>
want!&quot;.  It can be scary to validate this because it feels like you are  <br/>
encouraging the behavior.  But I find in general it is very helpful.   So when he says <br/>
&quot;I can do what I want!&quot; say &quot;wow! you can do what you want?  cool!&quot; and see <br/>
where it leads.  Back out of the verbal power struggle for  now.  I promise he <br/>
isn&#39;t going to grow up to be an ax murderer.   :)<br/>
 <br/>
What was also helpful to me when my kids were constantly engaging in some  <br/>
sort of power struggle was to excavate where in their lives they are feeling  <br/>
powerless.  Also, in a backwards way, some kids feel a little &quot;too  powerful&quot; at <br/>
stages, which is scary.  Like what if all of a sudden, you  found you had <br/>
magic powers to change the world at your will.  It is cool,  but also very scary. <br/>
You would want someone trusted to counsel you.  Maybe  with a switch to <br/>
unschooling, he is feeling a bit &quot;too powerful&quot; and feeling  like he wants to make <br/>
sure you are still going to help him manage the tough  stuff.  Does that make <br/>
sense?  It should even out.<br/>
 <br/>
So, no worries.  He will be fine.  He isn&#39;t &quot;getting away&quot; with  anything, he <br/>
is learning about complex behaviors and situations.  Oh, and  my totally <br/>
difficult 4 year old is a delightful 10 year old (today!).  <br/>
 <br/>
Hope something here is helpful.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024447542">Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your respons!  I think your right with just trying to avoid certain <br/>
situations.  He definately does great when we meet at a park or museum, ect... then when <br/>
it&#39;s at someones house and there&#39;s toys and other things that seem to cause conflict.  One <br/>
of my friends that we get together with has an almost 3 year old and for the most part <br/>
they get along, but both of them can be very intense at times and it takes my friend & I to <br/>
help diffuse the situation which can sometimes take 10 minutes!  I really trust this friend <br/>
and she totally understands my son&#39;s needs/wants as well as her own child&#39;s.  She&#39;s also a <br/>
fellow unschooler so we&#39;re on the same page.  That being said I still get stressed out when <br/>
we make plans to get together at either of our houses because there also eventually is <br/>
conflict and it&#39;s hard for me to help my son socialize when I have a 12 month old that is <br/>
nursing or wanting to be held, ect...<br/>
<br/>
Today in the car I was actually talking with the aforementioned friend about a mom&#39;s get <br/>
together tonight and when I hung up my son said &quot;what were you talking about&quot; and I said <br/>
&quot;about us getting together tonight&quot; (he thought I meant all of us), and he said (for the first <br/>
time ever) &quot;I really hate getting together&quot;, and I said &quot;you hate getting together?&quot; and he <br/>
said &quot;ya, because everyone likes to make their own choices and when we get together <br/>
people try and make my choices&quot;.  So I think after having this conversation with him he is<br/>
actually letting me know how he feels and that he doesn&#39;t want to get together .  I have <br/>
always let it be his choice about getting together, and he has always wanted to, even <br/>
suggesting it sometimes, but I guess I should have taken his behavior to mean that it&#39;s <br/>
just too much for him right now. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to see if our library has the book you mentioned.  I don&#39;t think he would be <br/>
classified as &quot;spirited&quot; or &quot;explosive&quot;, because most of the time we go along without <br/>
conflict, but I&#39;ve definately gained some insight by reading &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; for <br/>
the times that he is overwhelmed with emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I also like your suggestions of just mirroring what he is saying, I&#39;ve tried that before in <br/>
different situations and it does seem to work.  For example if there is a show he wants to <br/>
watch that isn&#39;t on, instead of saying &quot;you can&#39;t watch it because it&#39;s not on, I know you <br/>
want to, but it&#39;s not on&quot;, I will just say &quot;that show isn&#39;t on right now&quot; and then just keep <br/>
repeating &quot;you really want to watch that show now!&quot; and then he knows that I am hearing <br/>
him instead of trying to shut him up or just trying to make him feel better about it, which <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to help, it&#39;s almost antagonizing in a way to hear &quot;I know you want to, but <br/>
you can&#39;t&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your insight,<br/>
<br/>

Wow!  He is an articulate guy!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you found something helpful.  I think you are right.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do remember figuring out that Nick&#39;s behavior might mean he needed to  go.  <br/>
I began saying something to that effect, like &quot;your body/behavior is  telling <br/>
me that you want to go home&quot; and he was able to eventually connect to  that <br/>
himself *before* the meltdown.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think this is great.  You have both opened a new path of  communication and <br/>
trust.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, he has become very articulate as of late, and I blame it on unschooling:)  Seriously <br/>
though, in the 6 months we have been embracing radical unschooling, our dialogue with <br/>
our son has grown immensely in terms of talking with him, articulating feelings, coming to <br/>
an understanding that he won&#39;t be forced into doing anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, <br/>
trusting his judgement concerning his body and what he eats and does with his day, ect....<br/>
<br/>
I think it has opened up a whole new world for us and made my husband and I better <br/>
parents.<br/>
