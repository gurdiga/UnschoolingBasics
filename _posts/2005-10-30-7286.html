I&#39;m  definitely OUT of the closet! &lt;g&gt; Some traditional homeschoolers choose  <br/>
not to hang around with us but I find that&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve found so many more  <br/>
like-minded families by being open about Who We Are and how we  live.<br/>

Awww...thanks Kathryn. Right back at ya. And I feel so sad for your lesbian friends who were shunned from their local group. Tell them to come to Corvallis and join my homeschooling group. We understand what inclusive means!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110776489">hi mary.  speaking of closet-- that would definitely describe our area.<br/>
<br/>
  i think the local unschooling group (upstate s. carolina) lacks <br/>
encouragement and many don&#39;t think of themselves as unschoolers<br/>
anymore, <br/>
though there was a lot of interest a couple of years ago.  i don&#39;t want<br/>
<br/>
to take over or step on toes, so i was thinking of getting a group <br/>
started that&#39;s more alive.  but i can&#39;t help but wonder if since i&#39;m a <br/>
newbie myself in need of support, what to do?  i have talked with a <br/>
co-mod and actually met her at another group in a bookshop about 2<br/>
years <br/>
ago.  she used to be into unschooling.  that seems typical around here,<br/>
<br/>
and the dh&#39;s seem for the most part interested in upholding &quot;standards&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and their position in the status quo.  we met a couple last night at <br/>
dinner and though the lady and children were pleasant, dh and i were <br/>
appalled how long everyone laughed over her dh&#39;s antics about how <br/>
effective his punishments are.  i guess some people have nothing better<br/>
<br/>
to say.  anyway, it&#39;s generally quite repressive.<br/>
<br/>
kelly lovejoy & family were great!  she&#39;s midstate.  and leslie another<br/>
<br/>
great encourager who i also met is in the low country near beaufort. <br/>
i&#39;m trying to see if i can find others nearer by.<br/>
<br/>
you- i&#39;m &quot;picking on&quot; because i like your group start page--tlc-- and <br/>
want to ask your opinion and experience there in corvalis.<br/>

My experience here has been that if you start it, they will come. :o)<br/>
<br/>
From the very beginning I decided to make this a group for *ME*.  &lt;g&gt; I tried NOT to make everyone happy, but to really put my energy into what my family needed. It has been tweaked over the two years we&#39;ve been together. I originally called it the Unschooling Family Connection. I got a small group of mostly unschoolers but it seemed like the word &quot;unschooling&quot; in the title made some people feel like they wouldn&#39;t be accepted. <br/>
<br/>
My kids wanted a bigger social group, so we changed the name of the group to The Learning Community to give it a broader appeal. At the same time I changed the group&#39;s page to be VERY weighted towards unschooling while making it clear that we&#39;re inclusive. We&#39;ve  doubled our size in the past two months. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to use my group start page as a template. Take whatever you like. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our group is the same way - started by, heavily influenced by, and  <br/>
protected by unschoolers - but we are inclusive to other people as  <br/>
long as they can accept happily that our children&#39;s free play time is  <br/>
THE most important aspect of the group. So we talk about that heavily  <br/>
on the website - but don&#39;t have &#39;unschooling&#39; in the group name. We  <br/>
do have non-unschoolers who love our group and a fair number who show  <br/>
up once or twice only - so I assume we&#39;re not what they were looking  <br/>
for. Which is fine - like Mary, we&#39;re NOT trying to be THE group that  <br/>
suits everybody.<br/>

It&#39;s great that you can meet at a park all year long. Ahhh...southern CA. That was a challenge for us once the rains started here. But we&#39;ve recently found an awesome gym/rec room space in a church (of all places). I think we&#39;re going to be able to maintain our once a week schedule year round now! :oD<br/>

did the layout, and created the website. I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll get to  <br/>
meet Dan and his family at the next Live and Learn Conference in  <br/>
Albuquerque!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - when we DO get rain, we&#39;re at a total loss about what to do.  <br/>
Sometimes we resort to mall food courts - which have lots of tables  <br/>
to sit around and play games. But I find the echo-y weird noise level  <br/>
in a food court is very stressful and exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t get enough rainy days, most years, to worry about it - but  <br/>
we&#39;ve had extra-rainy years when it seemed like we spent the whole  <br/>
winter sitting in the mall.<br/>
