<div id="ygrps-yiv-631292770">&lt;There is a whole lot of emotional and<br/>
social issues which make them different. They process information <br/>
about the<br/>

would tell<br/>
you it&#39;s not a gift, it&#39;s a curse. He wishes he was like everyone <br/>
else. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
This may be the case with your child, but I know a LOT of &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>
children that aren&#39;t any different, they just get really good grades <br/>
and are considered very &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;apply&quot; themselves.  I think <br/>
EVERYONE perceives the world differently and I think EVERYONE learns <br/>
differently.  The problem with the public school system is that it <br/>
is only set up to accommodate one type of learner, thus the need <br/>
for &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot; program.  Even those in the &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>
program are usually only considered &quot;gifted&quot; in one or two areas.  <br/>
<br/>
My son happens to be &quot;highly sensitive&quot; and it is good to understand <br/>
how his brain works and to have the support of others that have <br/>
children like him, at the same time 20% of people in this country <br/>
are like him so is it really necessary to assign a label?  My <br/>
husband was considered slightly dyslexic but they never labeled him <br/>
and he figured out ways to function within that, he never felt <br/>
different but knew that he had to find ways around it.  I think we <br/>
are all &quot;different&quot; and have different ways of functioning in this <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it is good to understand the deeper meaning of the <br/>
label but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to actually label.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to disagree with this one - what you are describing is a &quot;good<br/>
student&quot; - not a gifted child. Gifted children very often don&#39;t &quot;apply&quot;<br/>
themselves - they know they can pass a typical class without having to. They<br/>
aren&#39;t the ones eagerly answering the teacher&#39;s questions - they are the<br/>
ones asking the questions the teacher can&#39;t answer. They aren&#39;t the ones who<br/>
spend hours on end on their homework - they are the ones who do their<br/>
homework at the last minute during the teacher&#39;s lectures instead of<br/>
listening to the teacher - illegibly scrawling out the correct answers -<br/>
often without even bothering to show the necessary work because they just<br/>
&quot;knew&quot; the right answers. They aren&#39;t the ones who study ahead of time for<br/>
tests - they are the ones that come into class late, realize everyone is<br/>
doing a test, borrow a pencil and still finish the test first and get the<br/>
highest score.<br/>
<br/>
In school, gifted children are troublemakers - bored with class, with too<br/>
much time on their hands and a load of really interesting ideas that are<br/>
pretty much guaranteed to piss off the school teachers and administrators (I<br/>
had one friend who built a rocket out of a box of matches and set it off in<br/>
school - he showed an understanding of mechanics, force and motion WELL<br/>
beyond his peers and got suspended for it). They are often mis labeled as<br/>
adhd - even told they are stupid. They do NOT fit in with the rest of the<br/>
school - even when they are &quot;behaving.&quot; Their peers don&#39;t understand them<br/>
and the teachers don&#39;t have time to deal with them - they are too busy<br/>
dealing with the kids who are struggling with the material.<br/>
<br/>
People assume that gifted children have it easy - after all, they understand<br/>
the material presented to them. They assume that a gifted child&#39;s emotions<br/>
keep in pace with their intellect and expect him to show a level of maturity<br/>
that they would NEVER expect from his peers, and then when he fails to live<br/>
up to their expectations, they blame him. They don&#39;t understand the drive a<br/>
gifted child has for learning that interests him to the exclusion of all<br/>
else. They can&#39;t relate.<br/>
Just my two cents on the matter - really, none of the above applies when you<br/>
are unschooling :)<br/>

<br/>
While I understand exactly what you&#39;re saying Danielle, the &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
children that get the label in school, AREN&#39;T the highly intelligent<br/>
&quot;troublemakers&quot; you just described.<br/>
Though the &quot;gifted&quot; label is so wrongly applied in SO many cases in<br/>
the school system, I still have to agree with Heidi&#39;s version of it.<br/>
<br/>
If the school recognized what you just posted as truth, they&#39;d have to<br/>
change their gifted program really FAST. It would be great if they&#39;d<br/>
recognize the intelligence of those &quot;troublemakers&quot; YES!<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I can&#39;t stand the label &quot;gifted&quot;...we&#39;re all &quot;gifted&quot; in<br/>
some way. Yes, there are highly intelligent, unique children that just<br/>
seem to need more stimulation than others...but in school the &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
label means &quot;better than&quot; and it causes as much harm as the LD label<br/>
in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend (are you still here Millie?) that has a VERY unique<br/>
child that way. At 16 months Will was reading. I don&#39;t mean a word or<br/>
two occasionally...I mean fluently reading ANYTHING.<br/>
He was two when they lived with us for a while, and I saw him pick up<br/>
a newspaper article and start reading it, word for word.<br/>
It freaked me out! He would walk behind me while I was on the computer<br/>
and walk away chanting words that were on my screen. CRIPES!<br/>
He preferred encyclopedia&#39;s and factual books to any children&#39;s<br/>
storybooks. He was SO unique that way....also a more intense personality.<br/>
<br/>
I often wonder if Will would get the &quot;gifted&quot; label at school...I mean<br/>
it&#39;s obvious he has a very different learning path than other children<br/>
his age, but would they turn that ability into a disability?<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it happen to other highly intelligent children. They<br/>
actually end up with an LD label because they don&#39;t do the schoolwork,<br/>
they can&#39;t write neatly, they lose focus (who wants to focus on<br/>
something you aren&#39;t interested in?), perhaps act destructively.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....I wrote too much, all I wanted to say was that I think all<br/>
these labels are harmful to a child&#39;s spirit...soulcrushing actually.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children can just BE who they are, without judgements,<br/>
without divisive labels, simply being celebrated for who they are<br/>
today. It&#39;s a beautiful thing.<br/>
<br/>
I know you already agree with that Danielle...I&#39;m not writing that<br/>
aimed at you. I think you&#39;re absolutely right about many of the highly<br/>
intelligent children being &quot;troublemakers&quot; in school...but I don&#39;t<br/>
believe most educators see it for what it really is.<br/>

when you<br/>
are unschooling :)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was really the point I was trying to make.  You are right about <br/>
your description of what the label should mean but those definitely <br/>
weren&#39;t the kids that were labeled as gifted when I was going to <br/>
school and it certainly doesn&#39;t describe my nephew.  Anyway, my main <br/>
point was that we all function differently in the world, I am sure I <br/>
could be labeled with something too, maybe ADHD or something!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am just so thankful for unschooling and that my children are simply <br/>
honored for being who they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109557789">The only good I&#39;ve found with labels is a matter of degree.  If you&#39;re<br/>
trying to counteract a really negative label then a more empowering<br/>
label can be good.  OR even better is to get out of the labeling<br/>
business altogether and find ways around the blame game.  So often,<br/>
knowing who or what causes a person&#39;s life to be different, like you<br/>
said, doesn&#39;t yield a useful strategy for living that life.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with labeling children is that such things comfort<br/>
adults (parents, grandparents, teachers, administrators, doctors,<br/>
psychologists and so on) while taking more power from children through<br/>
assigned names, which are seldom sought or welcomed.  Entire<br/>
livelihoods<br/>
are based the job of labeling and doing things *to* people rather than<br/>
appreciating and doing things *for* and *with* them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the best of all worlds to spend the young years finding out for<br/>
yourself who you are and what you will do.  The alternative is to spend<br/>
a chunk or the entirety of your adulthood shedding old undesirable<br/>
labels.  If a person doesn&#39;t use their power someone else will.  The<br/>
greatest gift is to protect children from bullying, labeling, and<br/>
whatever else robs them of personal power over their life.<br/>
