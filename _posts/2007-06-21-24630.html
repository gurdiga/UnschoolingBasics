<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298126931">Please bear with me if you see this more than once I am trying to get<br/>
lots of information so am posting on a few lists...<br/>
<br/>
Where to start? I find myself suddenly wanting to learn blogging,<br/>
website design and what not... I also think there may be a good reason<br/>
now to learn educational-ese. I was all nice and cozy in knowing what<br/>
a great state NJ can be for unschoolers and whamo, we get those orders<br/>
(which are great mind you) to Italy and accompanied by the threat of<br/>
being reported for educational neglect blah blah blah...<br/>
<br/>
So I am really wishing I had paid attention to all those blogs that<br/>
have great educational-ese type talk on them, maybe then I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
panicked at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
Of course I have no idea where to start... site or blog? How to<br/>
password protect it, build it etc....and where the heck did I save<br/>
those posts about educational-ese just in case???<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe having a site or blog will allay those educational<br/>
neglect worries so I can say, see we are actively learning...<br/>
<br/>
Something like that anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea where to start??<br/>

I love my  blogspot blogs :) Though you&#39;ll not find much educationese on my<br/>
personal blog, it&#39;s a great documentation of our life and times &lt;3 I find<br/>
the site to be very new-user-friendly, self-exploratory *&* self-explanatory<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great page for *translation* should you need  documentation for<br/>
your Lifestyle:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190801672">Hi, I&#39;m new but I&#39;m just going to jump right in...<br/>
My plan is to start a blog just for the learning that my kids are doing.<br/>
I&#39;ll start in August, I imagine... I already keep a blog (link in sig) and<br/>
it seems like a good way for me to keep track of things. I love to go back<br/>
and read everything we&#39;ve done and what the kids have learned. Also it helps<br/>
with finding out dates we did things. I could imagine that keeping a blog<br/>
would be helpful... I don&#39;t know about keeping a site, I do know that<br/>
blogging (at least with blogspot) is EASY and that is what I need...nothing<br/>
to complicate my already busy life. And you can set it to private and invite<br/>
only those you want to read it.<br/>
Good luck and have fun!<br/>
Jen<br/>
