<div id="ygrps-yiv-801146469">OK, maybe this isn&#39;t the appropriate place to post these thoughts <br/>
but this is the only really active group I&#39;m involved with so if you <br/>
have another place I can rant please send me there.  Anyway, today <br/>
is a day when I&#39;m feeling like &quot;why bother&quot;.  It seems that no <br/>
matter what I do my son (4) is going to give me a road block. Now in <br/>
reality I know its all me.  For example... a couple of weeks ago I <br/>
was going to take my nephew to school and the night before I asked <br/>
Ian if he wanted to stay home in the morning with the babysitter or <br/>
go with me.. well he said me.Cool. but that morning all hell broke <br/>
loose.  (me again) because I wanted Ian to change his &#39;painted&#39;pants <br/>
in case we went out afterwards (ok I&#39;m worrying what other people <br/>
will think -- bad...) So I thought if I helped him he would be ok -- <br/>
nope.. long story short I lost it, hollered a little spanked, etc.  <br/>
However, I did take him to mc&#39;d&#39;s later and all was well. Except my, <br/>
geez, I could&#39;ve handled the whole morning differently.  I could <br/>
have just left the stinkin&#39; painted pants up -- who really cares and <br/>
if they do oh well.  But then again today same scenario promised my <br/>
nephew I would take him to school.  All right, this time I won&#39;t <br/>
even wake up Ian, I won&#39;t worry about what he&#39;s wearing at the <br/>
moment I&#39;ll just lay him down in the car wrapped in cozy blanket and <br/>
take the spare set of clothes with me (because geez somebody (like <br/>
my mother) may realize he&#39;s in the same pants as yesterday -gasp -- <br/>
can&#39;t have that).  All is well, proud of myself no craziness <br/>
leaving. but listen there&#39;s more... get to Mc Donalds and ask him to <br/>
put on the different clothes or we weren&#39;t going in (hmmm. could <br/>
this been the wrong words???) Spazzzz , even offered to help... nope <br/>
spazz -- mom blows once more -spanks (Mind you, I&#39;m sure the drive <br/>
in guy thinks i&#39;m just killing my kid -- because he&#39;s screaming -<br/>
which he was doing way before I even spanked.... still wrong answer <br/>
I know...) <br/>
   Later it&#39;s time to go to Aunt Shel&#39;s just down the road -- to <br/>
rake outside -- so ok no prob. but you need socks and coat, hat, <br/>
etc..  minor dilemma&#39;s but he puts stuff on. but just before were <br/>
going out the door to walk him down - spazz.. throws off hat/mask <br/>
(which he put on) and gloves we just put on because it&#39;s hard to <br/>
open door... the ever mature mom whops him on the head with the hats <br/>
in my hand and causes more tantrum -- makes him go outside and go to <br/>
aunt shel&#39;s -- in between trying to get him to look at me and trying <br/>
to hold him -- looks like I&quot;M doing who knows what and sounding like <br/>
a lunatic i&#39;m sure.  (so wonder why he won&#39;t listen to me at this <br/>
point????)  <br/>
<br/>
ok believe it or not working towards unschooling but how the heck do <br/>
I unschool myself.  It seems the more I work on joyful living, <br/>
peacefulness, etc I revert back to the old.  I swear, I scream, <br/>
spank, what the heck...  ALL NEGATIVE. <br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s my pity party, it&#39;s just me. single mom of 2. 4years old <br/>
and 7 month old.  no one to retrieve me -- monies running out, <br/>
stress over money, expected the ex-boyfriend to maybe step up to the <br/>
plate and help and help me to work only part time (now he&#39;s the ex --<br/>
 for a reason)  my mom thinks the ex- is why Ian and I battled but <br/>
the truth is battle is always here... me.... I don&#39;t get to stay <br/>
home like these other unschoolers and just enjoy..now i have to go <br/>
look for a job and be away from my boys -- hating it.. <br/>
<br/>
can you all see where my mind is going..  Basically after all this <br/>
ranting... HOW do I unschool myself from all this old patterns? It <br/>
isn&#39;t my children&#39;s fault I&#39;m stressed.</div>

 </span></blockquote>When i read that some of it struck home with me.  I  used to reach out and <br/>
swat or spank the kids cause i was so frustrated.  when my younger son hit <br/>
me and I said &quot;dont hit, we dont hurt each other in this family&quot; is when it <br/>
hit me.  So i promised them i would not do that ever again and I havnt.  my <br/>
5 year old heard that his friend got a spanking today and he told me &quot;I <br/>
havnt gotten a spanking in years cause you quit that stuff&quot;  now i just hope <br/>
he eventually forgets that i ever did.<br/>
The other week I had to get the kids up and to a 7 oclock drs appointment.  <br/>
I got them dressed the night before in something comfortable, put their <br/>
shoes on while they were still asleep and off we went.  Otherwise just let <br/>
him wear what he wants... no biggy especially at his age.. people just <br/>
assume he dressed himself.. which he did.  As for hats and gloves just take <br/>
them with you.. he will ask for them pretty quick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113660606">A late response, but better late than never.  Did I miss something? <br/>
Using the word spanking is really just a way to make yourself feel <br/>
better.  If we substitute that word for what it really is--<br/>
HITTING-would it still be brushed off as ok? I know that it&#39;s easy <br/>
to get caught up in a bad situation...but some things can never be an <br/>
option. HITTING CHILDREN CAN NOT BE AN OPTION. EVER.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077359239">Ok folks last time I wrote anything substantial I was having a pity <br/>
party.  Well, that&#39;s over (thank goodness) but I would like to <br/>
update all of you on progress we have been having in our lives!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote: But then again today same scenario promised my <br/>

even wake up Ian, I won&#39;t worry about what he&#39;s wearing at the <br/>

<br/>
Thoughts going on now:  So what if he has the same stinkin&#39; pants on <br/>
from yesterday, or painted pants, or (gasp) dirty clothes.  People <br/>
who think their kids have to look perfect all the time are not <br/>
living in reality.  My own mother is the first to say &quot;don&#39;t worry <br/>
about what other people say -- but is the first to scream &#39;neglect&#39; <br/>
if my boy has not taken a bath in a couple of days or has the same <br/>
clothes on for two days... But I&#39;m not going to argue about it.. I&#39;m <br/>
going to encourage him to change but if he doesn&#39;t whose it hurting -<br/>
- no one. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote:  Spazzzz , even offered to help... nope  spazz -- mom blows <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in guy thinks i&#39;m just killing my kid -- because he&#39;s screaming -<br/>

 </span></blockquote>answer <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know...) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thinking now:  Someone wrote on this group that spanking -is Hitting <br/>
and that should never happen.  That person is right.  Lately when I <br/>
start to even think about spanking I think to myself -- &quot;I&#39;m going <br/>
to hit you..&quot; WRONG. One time I even did the classic threat -- &quot;If <br/>
you don&#39;t stop I&#39;m going to spank you&quot;  NOPE Later I even told my <br/>
son that I was wrong to say that, because spanking is hitting and I <br/>
ask him not to hit so I shouldn&#39;t........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MORE THOUGHTS:<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I&#39;m recoginizing more and more that I am setting the tone <br/>
for the household. If I&#39;m snappy and grumpy, how are my kids going <br/>
to act?  This one is a hard one to swallow but true.  Lately, are <br/>
household is running much smoother because I&#39;m slowly learning to <br/>
stop and think before I react.  My children are a blessing and I <br/>
want to have a peaceful household and it starts with me.  When I was <br/>
last having my pity party I was crying about it being just me -- but <br/>
in a more positive light -- at least I don&#39;t have to battle a <br/>
partner that doesn&#39;t understand unschooling.....  <br/>
<br/>
More accomplishments (I think):<br/>
<br/>
1.  when my oldest has insisted he doesn&#39;t need a coat or hat, etc.  <br/>
I honor his decision and usually now he&#39;s been asking for his coat <br/>
to be zipped up, or a hat, or gloves all on his own.  (so what if my <br/>
mom thinks this is awful, I believe my child is smart enough to <br/>
realize when he is cold and will fix the problem (he&#39;s 4))<br/>
<br/>
2.  On Halloween my son decided to take his clothes off and just <br/>
where his scoby doo outfit with just underwear and socks.  I did try <br/>
to explain that he really need clothes underneath because it was <br/>
cold, but he started to argue -- so I just said ok. to say the least <br/>
we didn&#39;t get to far before he wanted to head home and he was cold.  <br/>
But when he started to become upset because he wanted in the <br/>
stroller instead of his gator, I just asked him to hold on a minute <br/>
and I got a blanket and put it around him....<br/>
the only thing I think I could have left out was the &quot;I told you <br/>
so...&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
3.  The other morning when he asked for fritos for &#39;breakfast&#39; I <br/>
said ok and even went and got them for him.  Why not?  Like someone <br/>
pointed out does it matter if he eats them in the morning or late <br/>
afternoon?  When I was laughing about this with my mom -- of course <br/>
I got the &quot;oh, Rebecca&quot; from her.. but I just told her &quot;does it <br/>
really matter?&quot;  Of course her rebuttal was &quot;depends on what he ate <br/>
the rest of the day&quot; --- Does it???? I basically don&#39;t make a big <br/>
deal out of meals.  We eat when were hungry.  <br/>
<br/>
So folks, I believe I&#39;m starting to come around to the unschooling <br/>
thoughts and I&#39;m working on being more mindful towards my kids (and <br/>
everyone for that matter) everyday. The biggest thing I kick myself <br/>
about now is my quickness to yell.  Even today my son said to <br/>
me &quot;you can&#39;t holler at me I&#39;m being nice to you&quot; (something I have <br/>
said similarly to him before) and all I could say was &quot;your right, <br/>
I&#39;m sorry&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  I hope I made sense and I know this was a pretty long <br/>
message to sort through.  Thank you for your ever watching/listening <br/>
ears.  And I am always open to more suggestions...Thank you</div>
