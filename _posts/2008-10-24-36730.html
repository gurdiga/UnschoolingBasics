<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402329312">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the curious sort, so I hope you don&#39;t mind lots of questions<br/>
(doubt you would, lol).<br/>
<br/>
I am a &quot;new&quot; homeschooler, who is very intrigued by unschooling.  I<br/>
have, in the past hung out on other unschooling lists where it seemed<br/>
very &quot;unsafe&quot;, for lack of a better word to explore my questions.  If<br/>
it is okay with you, I&#39;d like to ask a few.  If not, feel free to<br/>
delete ;-)<br/>
<br/>
1).  What are your best tips for &quot;letting go&quot;?  I&#39;m fully aware that I<br/>
have much deschooling to do myself; and my son, who did a year and 3/4<br/>
of school needs it too.  I&#39;m scared that he won&#39;t get all that he<br/>
needs, even though I have a voice of reason telling me that he&#39;s not<br/>
going to be 20 and not be able to add two digit numbers.  <br/>
<br/>
2).  My dh is not overly-supportive of homeschooling all together. <br/>
Unschooling will be a hard &quot;sell&quot;.  I&#39;ve been planting the seed, as<br/>
Joshua has been miserable with math in particular.  <br/>
<br/>
3). The biggest obstacle of all is the school district--in my short (5<br/>
month) homeschooling career, they&#39;ve harassed me in many ways, mostly<br/>
annoying, but worrisome to some extent when I get letters threatening<br/>
Superintendent involvement even though I&#39;ve turned in the paperwork in<br/>
question.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see how I can meet their &quot;requirements&quot; and still unschool.  <br/>
I&#39;m a strange bird, in some ways.  I can do &quot;radical&quot; (not meaning<br/>
specifically radical unschooling) things even though I&#39;m not 100%<br/>
certain.  <br/>
<br/>
My mantra might be &quot;do it afraid&quot;.  I&#39;m intrigued about unschooling<br/>
even though I haven&#39;t read tons on it, and I&#39;ve come to believe that<br/>
this approach will benefit my son and in the end, that&#39;s what it&#39;s all<br/>
about.  My stuff, I can get over.  Might be a challenge, but I can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157369243">Hi Christie! I think I&#39;m the same boat. I&#39;m Stephanie and I have three kids<br/>
ages 9,6, and 17 months old. Dh isn&#39;t very supportive of unschooling. He<br/>
thinks they should know the basics before unschooling. The kids haven&#39;t done<br/>
much schooling. Well my oldest was in school from k- half of second grade.<br/>
Since then he&#39;s had a whole month of schooling out of two years. He still<br/>
likes to play with video games and doesn&#39;t do anything that looks like<br/>
school. My 6 year old was in preschool for 4 months before I took her out.<br/>
She&#39;s had one month of real schooling. She likes to do headsprout sometimes<br/>
and draws a lot. Anyway, I feel like they&#39;ve been deschooled but I&#39;m<br/>
probably wrong. Maybe they need more time, I don&#39;t know. I signed us up to<br/>
go to the UWWG  and can&#39;t wait! I&#39;m hoping that it will help us all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307604070">I am just curious, but what does dear hubby do for a living?  Does he work outside the <br/>
home?  Does he get tested on the basics everyday? I have been wondering why we as <br/>
parents, and those before us, have gotten into the mindset that there are certain <br/>
benchmarks everyone needs to do at a certain time and we all fit the same mold.  If I was <br/>
pestered daily about learning multiplication I would come to HATE it.  If your DH was <br/>
pestered daily about doing the trash or the dishes he would feel the same way.  Nagging, <br/>
complaining, coercing or bribing would only help momentarily and create a need to rebel <br/>
as soon as they feel strong enough to beat you at your own game.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen Kung Fu Panda?  We went and saw it tonight as a birthday gift for my dd.  <br/>
This movie is full of unschooling!  Po the Panda doesn&#39;t learn the same way the 5 masters <br/>
did.  He is much different.  Not sleek, not a &quot;fighting machine&quot;, kind of a goof ball, very <br/>
large and rotund and eats when he is upset or worried.  He has a huge heart, a great sense <br/>
of humor, huge dreams and BOUNCES!  Some of us float, some of us glide, some of us are <br/>
sleek, some are slender, some plump and plushy and some of us BOUNCE!  :) He has to <br/>
find his own way to learn.  He has to find why he is special. We are not one size fits all.  We <br/>
are individuals with different hopes, strengths, dreams and destinies than others.  We are <br/>
born to learn--ready and raring to go right out of the box, so to speak.  Our learning isn&#39;t <br/>
one size fits all either.  We were not made to go to a box to be force fed with a teeny <br/>
spoon, we were meant to choose the size and shape of what we take into our brains.  <br/>
Some need a giant spoon, some drink from the bowl.  Some think noodles are the best <br/>
and others want steamed dumplings.  <br/>
<br/>
Our similarities bring us together and our differences keep life interesting. LIFE IS THE <br/>
BASICS! They are living from the moment they move inside you, from the moment you <br/>
know they are there...from their first breath of our air they are learning.  Through living <br/>
they learn how to crawl, get mom&#39;s attention, eat, giggle, walk....Their cares and worries <br/>
are not ours.  They are learning to navigate now.  Let them be little and learn to navigate <br/>
their world in their way.  I wish we adults had been allowed to do so, what a fantastic gift <br/>
to give our kids! <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!!!! The resentments, worries, need to attempt to control will go away as the <br/>
adults/parents realize it is their problem in their heads not the children&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Big Huggs,<br/>
Amberlee her family&#39;s Po the Panda...<br/>

<br/>
When you think about it, you&#39;ve spent 20+ years hearing that school  <br/>
learning is the only way to learn. If you fail at school, you&#39;ll fail  <br/>
at life. Why would that message be easy to let go of with out counter  <br/>
evidence? Even *with* counter evidence it&#39;s hard for some people!<br/>
<br/>
Going to an unschooling conference and seeing unschooled parents and  <br/>
kids, listening to speakers.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dh is not overly-supportive of homeschooling all together.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling will be a hard &quot;sell&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling conferences seem to be the best for convincing dads.<br/>
<br/>
Do be sensitive to the fact that he is unsupportive because he&#39;s  <br/>
scared and wants the best for his kids and you&#39;re trying out  <br/>
something weird.<br/>
<br/>
How would you react if he happily got involved in some religious cult  <br/>
and started taking your kids to the meetings? Would his conviction  <br/>
and happiness be enough for you to embrace it? Would you be open to  <br/>
reading literature written by the cult?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The biggest obstacle of all is the school district-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something best taken to state lists. The rules are different  <br/>
in every state (and country since this is an international list).  <br/>
What state are you in? Maybe someone can direct you to a good state  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
If not, Sandra Dodd has links to state unschooling lists and  <br/>
conferences here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
<br/>
Also try:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t see how I can meet their &quot;requirements&quot; and still unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is possible in every state. The key is to be fully  <br/>
informed of the state laws. (Often superintendents will try to  <br/>
enforce what they believe is right about education, depending on the  <br/>
homeschooling parents to be ignorant and intimidated by authority.)  <br/>
And the best place to get educated is a state homeschooling list.<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Read, read, read, read, read. Here, in the archives, and at these two sites:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
www.joyfullyrejoycing.com<br/>
<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s MONTHS of reading, even if you&#39;re a speed-reader!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Consider buying this book: Parenting a Free Child, an Unschooled Life by Rue Kream.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Understand that there&#39;s no &quot;magic age&quot; for anyone to know anything. We have our entire lives to learn what we need to learn----and, not only is it *easier* to learn those things when we need them, it&#39;s how we are hard-wired---AND it simply makes more sense! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2).  My dh is not overly-supportive of homeschooling all together. <br/>
Unschooling will be a hard &quot;sell&quot;.  I&#39;ve been planting the seed, as<br/>
Joshua has been miserable with math in particular.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that your husband loves your son too and wants the best for him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are frightened of the unknown. So help make it &quot;known.&quot; Attend an unschooling conference or gathering (there&#39;s almost no excuse now---there&#39;s one in some part of the country every six weeks or less!!!) so you can meet other unschooling parents---and especially TEENS.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing IS believing---really!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3). The biggest obstacle of all is the school district--in my short (5<br/>
month) homeschooling career, they&#39;ve harassed me in many ways, mostly<br/>
annoying, but worrisome to some extent when I get letters threatening<br/>
Superintendent involvement even though I&#39;ve turned in the paperwork in<br/>
question.  I can&#39;t see how I can meet their &quot;requirements&quot; and still unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The school district is your SMALLEST concern. Homeschooling&#39;s legal in all 50 states. Which state are you in? We have someone from there (and Deb Rossing! &lt;g&gt;) who can clarify the law for you and give you balls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible even in New York and Pennsylvania, the two toughest states.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My mantra might be &quot;do it afraid&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think better is: &quot;Find out MORE, so you&#39;re NOT afraid!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m intrigued about unschooling<br/>
even though I haven&#39;t read tons on it, and I&#39;ve come to believe that<br/>
this approach will benefit my son and in the end, that&#39;s what it&#39;s all<br/>
about.  My stuff, I can get over.  Might be a challenge, but I can<br/>
handle it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Read tons. &lt;g&gt; And then come back with more questions. <br/>

Well, he might say that he does as a programmer.  Based on the convos<br/>
we&#39;ve had about this, he thinks that there is a certain core knowledge<br/>
base that we all need, he doesn&#39;t think that Joshua will learn what he<br/>
needs to of his own initiative, and he doesn&#39;t really think I&#39;m<br/>
qualified to &quot;teach&quot; him beyond elementary school.  He liked school<br/>
and feels that it is valuable and necessary.  <br/>

your reply, btw (I told him that several of you empathized with him<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s something best taken to state lists. The rules are different  <br/>
&gt; in every state (and country since this is an international list).  <br/>
&gt; What state are you in? Maybe someone can direct you to a good state  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I found one.  Thanks!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling is possible in every state. The key is to be fully  <br/>
&gt; informed of the state laws. (Often superintendents will try to  <br/>
&gt; enforce what they believe is right about education, depending on the  <br/>
&gt; homeschooling parents to be ignorant and intimidated by authority.)  <br/>
<br/>

backed off now that HSLDA has contacted them.<br/>

&gt; 1).  What are your best tips for &quot;letting go&quot;?  I&#39;m fully aware that I<br/>
&gt; have much deschooling to do myself; and my son, who did a year and 3/4<br/>

&gt; Unschooling will be a hard &quot;sell&quot;.  I&#39;ve been planting the seed, as<br/>
&gt; Joshua has been miserable with math in particular.  <br/>

now---there&#39;s one in some part of the country every six weeks or<br/>
less!!!)Â so you can meet other unschooling parents---and especially TEENS.<br/>

&gt; month) homeschooling career, they&#39;ve harassed me in many ways, mostly<br/>
&gt; annoying, but worrisome to some extent when I get letters threatening<br/>

hopefully that will be helpful, but I&#39;m dizzy with all the new groups<br/>
