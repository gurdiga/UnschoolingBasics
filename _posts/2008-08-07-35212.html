<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248221588">Since we have a resident speech pathologist on the list, and lots of <br/>
parents with lots of experience, I do have a slight concern with my <br/>
3.5yo son.  When he was younger, he refused to sign (my first would sign <br/>
with me) and would point and grunt.  That was fine, we could figure out <br/>
what he wanted.  He finally decided to talk right before his 3rd <br/>
birthday (November).  His speech almost sounds indicative of someone <br/>
with a hearing problem, but he hears fine.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is troubling me a bit is that he has started stuttering <br/>
and it seems to be getting worse.  At first it was mild, and I thought <br/>
he was picking it up from the movie Alvin & the Chipmunks (which gets <br/>
watched a lot in the car).  In one of the scenes one of the guys (not a <br/>
chipmunk) says, &quot;Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave...&quot; and then he finishes his <br/>
sentence.  That&#39;s the only time this guy stutters his words in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Chase, my 3.5yo, would stutter some here and there and I just let it <br/>
go.  Now it&#39;s progressing and he&#39;s stuttering words multiple times and <br/>
really starting to stutter on words that begin with the &quot;s&quot; sound.  I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if some of it could be food related because he&#39;s been on an <br/>
unusually big sugar kick lately.  I don&#39;t really attribute sugar to any <br/>
behavior issues, but I&#39;m wondering if something in his diet could be <br/>
attributed to his stuttering.  Or, is this normal?  I have no idea <br/>
because no one in my family stutters, so I don&#39;t have any experience <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
All advice is welcome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154653405">A lot of what you&#39;re seeing is probably development.  There are tons of<br/>
people on the list and other lists too with children who stuttered.  Karl<br/>
repeats himself at the beginning of a sentence several times occasionally.<br/>
More so than he used to.  He has excellent speech otherwise at 5 and I am<br/>
not worried.  He will figure out what works for him.<br/>

It&#39;s not the sugar!!!  &lt;g&gt;  Dysfluencies are very common in  many children as <br/>
they are learning speech patterns.  Some kids don&#39;t have  any but many <br/>
children go through a period where they are repeating sounds and  syllables and <br/>
words.  Three to four year old children are going through  these amazing speech <br/>
and language  changes as they are learning  inflection and sound systems.  Also, <br/>
their vocabulary is just  exploding. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s one of the main concerns of parents at this age as their children  start <br/>
having repetitions with their expressive speech. I usually recommend  that 1) <br/>
make sure you are on their level when you talk with them....kneel down  and <br/>
get eye contact and have all the time in the world to listen.  Don&#39;t  finish <br/>
their words...just be patient.   When you understand what they  are saying, <br/>
repeat it back so they know you have understood.     2) Don&#39;t call attention to <br/>
their speech and find ways they can express  themselves nonverbally if they are <br/>
having a rough day<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just like walking or reading....kids go through the process in their  <br/>
own time and in their own way.  It is highly unusual for dysfluencies at  this <br/>
age to continue and progress to stuttering.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642651638">Have you tried Nonviolent Communication?  I recently found out about  <br/>
it from another list.  (I think NVC is great and powerful. Thanks  <br/>
Meredith:)) I can&#39;t quite think how to describe it in a way to let you  <br/>
know how important it is.  Here is a quote from the website (www.cnvc.org <br/>
) for the Centre for Nonviolent Communication:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;NVC involves both communication skills that foster compassionate  <br/>
relating and consciousness of the interdependence of our well being  <br/>
and using power with others to work together to meet the needs of all  <br/>
concerned&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You can search the list archives too as I know it&#39;s come up here years  <br/>
ago. My suggestion is that you read about it if you don&#39;t already know  <br/>
the process.  You could then try it with your friend and her children.  <br/>
When you use NVC, the other person doesn&#39;t need to know NVC for it to  <br/>
help.  You can start with the website and the book Nonviolent  <br/>
Communication: a language of life by Marshall Rosenberg.  The author  <br/>
has also written a booklet for parents Raising Children  <br/>
Compassionately: Parenting the Nonviolent Communication Way. (I&#39;ve  <br/>
requested this one on interlibrary loan and I&#39;m looking forward to  <br/>
reading it). You can order the books online or try your local public  <br/>
library. There are also workshops if you really get into it.<br/>
<br/>
As you describe the other parent as a friend, I can really understand  <br/>
why you would want to help her as well as her children. I&#39;d like to  <br/>
buy copies of the books for all my relatives and friends, but first  <br/>
I&#39;ll have to win the lottery!<br/>

<br/>
You know, it depends on the person and on your relationship. We can&#39;t <br/>
tell others how to parent, but we can offer options or be a sounding <br/>
board. It really depends.<br/>
<br/>
1) If it&#39;s a really good friend and you talk a lot, she may be open to <br/>
some ideas. Maybe give her Rue&#39;s book for the next gift-giving <br/>
occasion---or just because. Then offer to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
BE the change you want to see. BE a shining example. Offer to take the <br/>
child when things get crazy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) If it&#39;s not a really good friend, walk away. Your heart will break <br/>
each and every time you&#39;re around them, and it will get harder and <br/>
harder to be around them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost several good friends since we&#39;ve change our way of parenting <br/>
and/or since they became parents. BUT...our lives have been enriched <br/>
since then by the families we&#39;ve met who&#39;ve embraced the same <br/>
philosophy. It&#39;s just so much more pleasant around here NOT to have <br/>
that bad energy in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
We have an incredible circle of friends that we&#39;ve purposefully worked <br/>
at establishing these last eight years---and it grows each year! I&#39;d <br/>
hate to think what it would be like if we&#39;d kept all the same friends <br/>
we had ten years ago. Many are such downers. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150767811">My son went through a stuttering phase.  The SLP we were seeing at the time for the apraxia (I believe he was 4 to 4 1/2 years old) said it was a normal development stage.  Again for me it&#39;s about what is okay with the child.  If he or she is unaware and not bothered by it then I wouldn&#39;t be concerned.  If the child gets frustrated and gives up on the word, having to find another word to get what they desire or expresses to you feeling a loss of confidence due to the way they speak, then I&#39;d start researching how to help them through.  <br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113149997">I would have a hard time walking away from this. It sounds like the poor  <br/>
child is being mentally and maybe physically abused.  The child needs  someone to <br/>
stand up for him. Could you talk to another family member  (grandparent, <br/>
aunt)? Even if it does cost you the friendship maybe you could  tell your friend <br/>
how you feel and (strongly) suggest parenting classes or  counseling.<br/>

that is not an option.  I just don&#39;t know what to do. does anyone have  <br/>
any<br/>
suggestions?<br/>

You know, it depends on the  person and on your relationship. We can&#39;t <br/>
tell others how to parent, but  we can offer options or be a sounding <br/>
board. It really depends.<br/>
<br/>
1)  If it&#39;s a really good friend and you talk a lot, she may be open to <br/>
some  ideas. Maybe give her Rue&#39;s book for the next gift-giving <br/>
occasion---or  just because. Then offer to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
BE the change you want to  see. BE a shining example. Offer to take the <br/>
child when things get  crazy.<br/>
<br/>
2) If it&#39;s not a really good friend, walk away. Your heart will  break <br/>
each and every time you&#39;re around them, and it will get harder and  <br/>
harder to be around them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost several good friends since  we&#39;ve change our way of parenting <br/>
and/or since they became parents.  BUT...our lives have been enriched <br/>
since then by the families we&#39;ve met  who&#39;ve embraced the same <br/>
philosophy. It&#39;s just so much more pleasant  around here NOT to have <br/>
that bad energy in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
We have an  incredible circle of friends that we&#39;ve purposefully worked <br/>
at  establishing these last eight years---and it grows each year! I&#39;d <br/>
hate to  think what it would be like if we&#39;d kept all the same friends <br/>
we had ten  years ago. Many are such downers. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
