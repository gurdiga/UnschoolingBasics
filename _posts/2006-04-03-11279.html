<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871242718">I want to pass along some sad news for those that know the Jansens.<br/>
Rose Jansen has been a member of this list for some time and we hung<br/>
out with them a lot in Pensacola. Aaron rode with us up to the Live<br/>
and Learn conference last year.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, Aaron and his Dad were driving back to P&#39;cola and were in a<br/>
bad car wreck near Hattiesburg. They were airlifted to Memphis and<br/>
being cared for by both the hospital staff and local homeschoolers<br/>
(hurray for the homeschooling community!).<br/>
Both of Aaron&#39;s legs and wrists are broken and he will need more<br/>
surgery when some swelling goes down. Richard (his Dad) has hip and<br/>
leg injuries. It looks like they&#39;ll both be in wheelchairs for a while<br/>
and Rose will have her hands full. They&#39;ll be in Memphis for at least<br/>
the rest of this week. I don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll return to P&#39;cola.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to offer support, please email me offlist. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to get a big thread started, so please just write me<br/>
personally if you&#39;d like to reach out. I will be happy to pass along<br/>
information to those that want it. I&#39;ve posted pics of Aaron at my<br/>
blog, from last October....he&#39;s a really neat kid. I don&#39;t think Rose<br/>
will be reading here for some time, but I&#39;ll make sure any messages<br/>
you&#39;d like to forward get to her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
<br/>
