<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889728374">&quot;I really dislike the term Radical<br/>
Unschooling, as I don&#39;t really want to use the word radical to <br/>
describe mysel&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do like the term whole life unschooling, but I&#39;m very comfortable <br/>
with the term &quot;radical unschooler&quot; as well. The only time I&#39;d use it <br/>
is with other people that actually understood the term.  It&#39;s not <br/>
like we&#39;re throwing the term around in mainstream circles.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go around to my friends at work and say &quot;I&#39;m a radical <br/>
unschooler&quot;.<br/>
I guess it&#39;s all phases. If someone doesn&#39;t understand much about <br/>
homeschooling, I just say &quot;we homeschool&quot;. If a person understands <br/>
homeschooling, I might say &quot;we unschool&quot;, if they understand <br/>
unschooling, I might say &quot;we&#39;re radical unschoolers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just to make this concept clear, radical is a great term in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
Radical: 1. Arising from or going to a root or source. 2a.Affecting <br/>
the basis of something; fundamental in its effect, a far reaching <br/>
affect..<br/>
<br/>
If you put radical unschooling in light of the definition of <br/>
radical, it&#39;s the root of the philosophy (trust in children) which <br/>
we apply to ALL of life, not just education. Those that are radical <br/>
unschoolers are staying close to the source of the philosophy in all <br/>
that they do.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, radical unschooler to the core and proud of it!!</div>
