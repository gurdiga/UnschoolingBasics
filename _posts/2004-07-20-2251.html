<div id="ygrps-yiv-507497305">I have been considering sharing more about home/unschooling with Pat, <br/>
my fiance&#39;, in order to encourage him with his youngest, Amie and <br/>
Andrew.  I have wanted to include them in our homeschooling journey <br/>
ever since it began years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I am familiar with and currently living the unschooling way <br/>
it seems even more realistic for him to be able to do this with <br/>
them.  They have actually asked me on several occassions to <br/>
homeschool them, but to this point it&#39;s not an option.  The more I <br/>
learn, the more of an option it becomes in my mind.  Who knows, right?<br/>
<br/>
What I am wondering about is this.  I know that anyone can go to <br/>
college, but how does it work with the military?  Andrew is 12, and <br/>
he&#39;s been military bound since he was about six.  I never thought I <br/>
would encourage a child in this direction, but he lives and breathes <br/>
everything military.  He wants to fly.  If a child is unschooled, how <br/>
does it affect them enlisting in the service?  Anyone know about how <br/>
this works?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

 <br/>
Not an expert, by any means, but husband&#39;s a Citadel grad....<br/>
 <br/>
If he wants to fly, he&#39;ll be an officer. Officer&#39;s must have a college  <br/>
degree. So it would be the same childhood----no special classes. <br/>
 <br/>
He would need to go to a military school, like The Citadel or VMI, get a  <br/>
congressional appointment to one of the academies (Army, Navy, Air Force), or  <br/>
attend any school with a ROTC program----just like any other future officer. He  <br/>
could also just go to any old college, get a degree, and then apply to go  to <br/>
officer training school (OTS).<br/>
 <br/>
If he just wants to enlist at 18, he *might* need a diploma. I&#39;m not sure  <br/>
how keen the armed services are about taking homeschoolers. The really need  <br/>
soldiers to act without questioning, to follow orders. Critical thinkers can  <br/>
slow an army down!<br/>

This was recently posted on another list (WNLA -<br/>
Washington Natural Learners Assoc).  Thought you might<br/>
be interested....<br/>

Some of you may know that the military services were<br/>
conducting a five-year pilot study of homeschool<br/>
enlistees. That study concluded last year and the<br/>
report was issued in Janaury. The report recently<br/>
became available online and I&#39;ve written a short<br/>
article with reference links (available at the<br/>
website).<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass the link on to anyone else you know<br/>
who may be interested.<br/>

<br/>
Military Enlistment by Homeschooled Graduates<br/>
<br/>
Military service is not often the first thing that<br/>
comes to mind when one thinks about the aspirations of<br/>
homeschooled children (even military Brats), but<br/>
still, it is the choice of some. Because of the clash<br/>
between the sometimes &#39;loose&#39; homeschooling style, and<br/>
the distinctly &#39;unloose&#39; style of the military,<br/>
homeschooled teens without college credit hours have<br/>
found it difficult to enlist in the military. Some of<br/>
those homeschooling parents took their concerns to<br/>
HSLDA, and in 1998 an amendment to H.R. 3616, the<br/>
Defense Authorization Bill, was made establishing a<br/>
five-year pilot program to allow homeschooled<br/>
graduates to enlist in the military services as Tier I<br/>
recruits instead of Tier II recruits.** This amendment<br/>
was not universally<br/>
cheered in homeschooling circles.<br/>
<br/>
Last year the study concluded, and in January of this<br/>
year the study was published but was not available<br/>
online until recently: Final Analysis of Evaluation of<br/>
Homeschool and ChalleNGe Program Recruits. The results<br/>
aren&#39;t what many expected. Homeschooled recruits do<br/>
not have as good a record in completing initial<br/>
enlistments, or in re-upping, as do high school<br/>
graduates.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the expense of training military recruits,<br/>
&quot;Attrition is costly to both the military and the<br/>
taxpayer--estimated at $18,400 per premature<br/>
separation in 1987 dollars (Laurence 1987),&quot; the<br/>
military services want to recruit the people who show<br/>
the best record of returning value for the cost<br/>
of training (i.e., they complete their enlistments,<br/>
they re-up). It must be remembered that service in the<br/>
military is not a right, it is a privilege.  Because<br/>
of the special nature of military service,<br/>
restrictions are placed on the people who are allowed<br/>
to join.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning Tier assignment of homeschooled applicants,<br/>
the report&#39;s recommendation is: &quot;Given that tier<br/>
placement is based on attrition rates, the data do not<br/>
support considering ChalleNGe or homeschooled recruits<br/>
on a par with high school diploma graduates or<br/>
permanently placing these credentials in Tier 1.&quot;<br/>
(page 51 of the report)<br/>
<br/>
If a homeschooled teen wishes to join the service, and<br/>
to be considered as Tier I, the chances of enlistment<br/>
will be enhanced by taking college courses<br/>
and accruing a minimum of 15 credit hours. Otherwise,<br/>
check with a recruiter for the service under<br/>
consideration. Other alternatives are to acquire a<br/>
college degree and either enlist or be commissioned as<br/>
an officer, or to seek admittance to one of the<br/>
service academies. (see the Beyond Homeschooling page)<br/>
<br/>
============================================================================<br/>
**Tier II recruits are alternative-diploma holders,<br/>
not drop-outs; Tier III persons are those who hold no<br/>
secondary school diploma and, unless they have<br/>
exceptionally high scores, are not recruited.<br/>
<br/>
The misinformation on many homeschool websites about<br/>
homeschoolers being &#39;discriminated against&#39; concerning<br/>
military recruitment was not &#39;discrimination.&#39; The<br/>
Tier II categorization was based on the military&#39;s<br/>
experience with traditional high school graduates,<br/>
non-traditional graduates and non-diploma holders<br/>
(many of whom were probably drop-outs). If you want to<br/>
play in the Establishment&#39;s game, you have to jump<br/>
through the Establishment&#39;s hoops.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535208344">Thanks for this information!  I am SO glad I asked about this.  It <br/>
gives me much more to consider.  Seems strange to think that it may <br/>
not be in his best interest to be homeschooled.  My mind just is not <br/>
used to thinking that way...<br/>

<br/>
You can go to www.military.com and they let you get &quot;insider <br/>
information&quot; about recruiting and exactly what the process and <br/>
requirements are.  You sign up for the branches you want to know <br/>
about and I think they email you all of the information.  They may <br/>
be able to shed some light on it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right. Flying means being an officer, which means college. Getting <br/>
into college shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but I don&#39;t know how easy/hard <br/>
it would be to get into ROTC coming from homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Dh mentioned something about the Nat&#39;l Guard being able to appoint <br/>
people to the academies, so maybe some college classes and Nat&#39;l <br/>
Guard service is another path to an academy--if he&#39;s at all <br/>
interested in that path. <br/>
