<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100835776">I just got this really good idea, after reading a post on <br/>
shinewithunschooling and thought I would share here.  Someone over <br/>
there was just sharing a &quot;day in their unschooly life&quot; and I thought <br/>
it would be fun to keep a file of those stories, and maybe, just maybe <br/>
eventually turn it into some kind of a book.  I love reading those <br/>
stories, as I am sure most of you do too so share your stories, either <br/>
here or e-mail me off list and I will keep them in a file.  They are <br/>
very inspirational and remind us all of why we choose to live this <br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
