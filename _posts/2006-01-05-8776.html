<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427174353">Gayle, I haven&#39;t the time to read all the posts but I just wanted to <br/>
share something that has helped me completely let go of control.  I <br/>
take a few minutes and think &quot;what is the worst thing that can <br/>
happen?&quot;  Often that stops me in my tracks and anyone that knows me <br/>
now can vouch for me that I have totally let go of having to be in <br/>
control, mostly Ren because she is my sister!  Any mess can be cleaned <br/>
up, even if it does take a little time.  I will put a fun movie or <br/>
show on after the mess is made and then I have a bit of time that is <br/>
quiet and I just clean it up, sometimes my kids will do a good job of <br/>
helping me too!  It has probably already been said but you can do <br/>
it!!  Just recognizing that you need to change is a HUGE step and it <br/>
will not go away until the changes begin to happen.  You are a great <br/>
mom and you LOVE your kids enough to be aware of your behavior and <br/>
that is ENORMOUS!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
I agree. I took a Dale Carnegie class over 10 years ago and that is<br/>
the most important and lasting piece of advice I culled from it. In<br/>
_How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ the advice was<br/>
<br/>
1. Ask yourself what is the worst thing that can happen. (he even<br/>
takes it to far out extremes - like death)<br/>
2. Prepare yourself for the worst/accept what you can not change<br/>
3. Move on - usually the worst does not happen, so you are not doing too bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me this usually means, something might get destroyed. Usually, it<br/>
is not even anything I care about - so I can quickly redirect myself.<br/>
My big issue is when one child &quot;might&quot; hurt the other (from playing<br/>
around and having fun) - but that is another post.<br/>
<br/>
Stamps are actually pretty indestructible - but feelings and memories<br/>
are not. Have you done foot print painting? Take a long piece of paper<br/>
from an art roll and run it down the sidewalk. Let your kids dip their<br/>
feet in paint (use several colors so they can mix them up) and<br/>
dance/tiptoe/slide down the walkway. My kids LOVE this ! It is all<br/>
about the process, although sometimes the end product is pretty cool<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
You know, a lot of people ask Markus and I how we do some of the<br/>
things we do (formerly climbed mountains, move to strange places we&#39;ve<br/>
never been without jobs, start new businesses etc...).<br/>
My theory is this:  We get a ticket for this thing called life, just<br/>
one ticket (even if you believe in reincarnation, this is the ONLY<br/>
ticket you get for this particular life) and you already know the<br/>
ending to the story, it&#39;s tragic..YOU DIE.<br/>
So knowing that ending, that we ALL get to have, why NOT make the most<br/>
of that ride we get?<br/>
<br/>
If death is the outcome for all of us, then hell, let&#39;s have some<br/>
great memories and fabulous adventures until that day!!:)<br/>
<br/>
And another helpful reminder for me in dealing with my children, is I<br/>
might not always have them with me.  In the light of death, messes and<br/>
paint and stamps and food and all sorts of life issues, are suddenly<br/>
very easy to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Over at the Shine list, one of the families faced a very scary time<br/>
with a child hospitalized recently. Every time I read about Ryan and<br/>
the fear they were dealing with, I looked at my own sweet children and<br/>
thanked the universe they were healthy and able to make loud noise and<br/>
big messes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all perspective isn&#39;t it?  Sometimes our priorities seem very<br/>
different when we picture a breathing tube or surguries or any other<br/>
number of difficulties we could be facing right now. Doesn&#39;t hurt to<br/>
remember that once in a while.<br/>

what memories do you want to leave behind for your children and their <br/>
children? My mom had a stroke when she was very young (I was 5, my bro <br/>
3 and my sis was about 3 months old, my mom was 28). By nature and <br/>
nurture she was very much a &#39;tidier&#39; type person, she wanted the house <br/>
always clean and the yard nicely kept with flower gardens and all. She <br/>
recovered well from the stroke but it was merely a signal of a really <br/>
damaged heart. She had to choose *daily* where to invest her limited <br/>
energy reserves - scrubbing the kitchen floor or baking cookies with <br/>
us kids; clean the ceiling light fixtures or take a walk or go to the <br/>
park. She adopted as a motto &#39;what do you want as your epitaph: her <br/>
house was always clean OR she always had time for her family&#39;<br/>
