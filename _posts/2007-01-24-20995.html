**Well, if your life-expectancy is 30, marrying young and having a few kids right away makes sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As someone else has already pointed out, this low life expectancy is<br/>
mainly due to infant death. A more important point to consider in my<br/>
opinion, would be that kids started learning a trade at a way younger<br/>
age, so that they were expected to be able to have a job at 15, whereas<br/>
nowadays kids are considered kids until they graduate from college at<br/>
22-23yo. Life is more complicated now than it used to be, because kids<br/>
have more choices to make. If at 9yo I start learning to become a<br/>
shoemaker and it&#39;s obvious I&#39;m going to do that for a living for the<br/>
rest of my life, it&#39;s a lot easier to be mature at 15yo than if I&#39;m in<br/>
10th grade at 15yo and have to decide whether I want to go to college,<br/>
or trade school, and if so, what to major in, or travel across the<br/>
world, or this, or that. <br/>
