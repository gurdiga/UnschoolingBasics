<div id="ygrps-yiv-61575446">I started a new blog finally after asking Dayna Martin how to do it. It has only one post on it; it&#39;s sort of a field report.

Also the link below is to some my Dad&#39;s artwork...he&#39;s open to learning as an unschooler and in fact has always been one unknowingly...really both my parents have. Just have to help them see it!  <br/>

I started a new blog finally after asking Dayna Martin how to do it. It <br/>
has only<br/>
one post on it; it&#39;s sort of a field report. It does have a question or <br/>
two, but<br/>
also I think it gives a sense of how our efforts feel to me right now, <br/>
and if<br/>
anyone is willing to read it and perhaps give feedback, I&#39;d sure <br/>
appreciate<br/>
that. If not, that&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t know if this is OK to offer or not. I <br/>
tried to<br/>
leave it so anyone could comment there, and I hope I succeeded, but I <br/>
think you<br/>
could comment here, too.<br/>

Well, give Granville a big, giant hug from me!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s healing---and he&#39;ll come around to be with you on a more normal <br/>
schedule after a while. He&#39;ll have watched everything on TV until he <br/>
wants no more, and he&#39;ll crawl out of the deschooling with a passion so <br/>
big you won&#39;t know what hit you! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for Emily---she&#39;s showing you that *she* is more than capable of <br/>
learning on her own. It&#39;s cool that she can see that.<br/>
<br/>
And Burke---well he&#39;s a smart little bugger, huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being outside of the unschooling home probably *will* set them back a <br/>
bit. I&#39;m afraid that they may come doubting their ability to learn <br/>
without school---but it won&#39;t throw all the way back to the beginning. <br/>
Just a step or two back. I tried to keep Cameron away from in-laws and <br/>
anyone who would tease/hurt him in any way if I couldn&#39;t be right there <br/>
to stop it. It still happened, and he would seem a little bummed for a <br/>
while---and not much I could say would fix it.<br/>
<br/>
But *YOU* have BURKE! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s good when they get back home---I know you miss them!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537562577">I really enjoyed reading at your blog Cameron. I think it&#39;s awesome<br/>
that you&#39;re not overly focused on some destination, but being present<br/>
for the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Your Dad&#39;s art is amazing! I hate to ask what he sells those for but<br/>
I&#39;m lusting after one.:)<br/>
