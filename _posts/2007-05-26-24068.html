<div id="ygrps-yiv-723327418">My dh, who supports a lot of what we do (i.e. unschooling, family bed,<br/>
extended nursing, etc.) constantly complains about the housework not<br/>
being done.  I try to remind him that I am busy non-stop all day,<br/>
picking up, playing with the kids, making meals, etc.  The children<br/>
are my priority and I do what housework I can (besides constantly<br/>
picking up (which I don&#39;t mind), I try to focus on the clothes and<br/>
dishes - not meaning that I necessarily get them done).  <br/>
<br/>
One factor, which I&#39;ve pointed out, is that he is never home.  He<br/>
works long hours and when he comes home, he just wants to veg (which<br/>
means he jumps on the computer or watches t.v. alone in his room).  He<br/>
also is the leader of a nine-piece horn band (meaning he does<br/>
everything - sets up practices (trying to get 9 people together once a<br/>
week), copies cds and dvds, contacts venues, prints out promotional<br/>
stuff, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
So, my complaint is that he expects me to keep the house clean, but I<br/>
want him to realize that the kids are more important than the<br/>
housework.  And if he wants more housework done, he has to be around<br/>
more to help with the housework or play with the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t feel this is the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
How can we resolve this situation?<br/>

I know you&#39;ll get some great responses to this about expectations and  <br/>
communication between the two of you but I&#39;m going to offer just one practical  idea <br/>
that doesn&#39;t really address the underlying issues here but may help as you  <br/>
work things out.  Find a space that is just for your husband that can be as  <br/>
organized as he needs it to be.<br/>
 <br/>
I am one of those people who really needs a high level of organized clean  <br/>
space to feel at peace and be able to function at my best.  My husband is  gone <br/>
now most of the time and there is just too much for me to keep up  with.  My <br/>
kids are older so I don&#39;t really have the messy house issue  and I can just <br/>
close the door to a bedroom.  However,  I struggle  with keeping up all the <br/>
outside stuff...watering, moving, half done house  projects.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have two spaces in the house that I keep just like I want.  When I&#39;m  <br/>
feeling overwhelmed (like I am today)  I just go into one of those spaces  and <br/>
enjoy everything in it&#39;s place.  Then I feel able to just hang out with  the kids <br/>
or maybe do one more &quot;little&quot; thing that I want to get done.<br/>
 <br/>
I think I&#39;ve seen Ren post about a space like this for her husband.   It <br/>
might be worth a try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255914731">~~And if he wants more housework done, he has to be around<br/>

<br/>
EXACTLY!!<br/>
If you&#39;re comfortable with the level of cleanliness and he isn&#39;t, then<br/>
it becomes his issue. There&#39;s always the factor of trying to be<br/>
considerate of other people in the house and their need for clean, but<br/>
at this point, it sounds like he has expectations without taking any<br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d make it clear that you are comfortable with the way things are<br/>
(I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re fine with whatever level of clean/mess the house<br/>
is right now?) and ask him how he felt if you tried to impose your<br/>
level of comfort on him......rather than just asking for help.<br/>
<br/>
Eliciting cooperation works much better than coercing...for adults as<br/>
well as kids!!:)  We&#39;ve been known to have a 10 minute straightening<br/>
binge just before Bleu gets home, just because we know it will be<br/>
nicer for him. But someone grumping about mess doesn&#39;t inspire me<br/>
much! Asking for help works much better. <br/>
<br/>
Is he open to simply communicating when it bothers him and having a<br/>
quick clean-up party where everyone just pitches in for a few minutes,<br/>
making it a fun thing to do together?  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I had just highlighted your advice about this in order to respond,<br/>
then saw that you&#39;d written the above! :)<br/>
YES, a huge thing for us in choosing a home is making sure dh has his<br/>
own space. It&#39;s always neat and tidy, nicely decorated and very<br/>
calming. We love his space but find it difficult to keep our own<br/>
spaces that way...so we don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Our lives are much better when each of us has a space to do with as we<br/>
please. Especially for those personalities that really NEED a tidy,<br/>
organized space in families that don&#39;t have the same needs. <br/>
<br/>
Our living/dining is considered &quot;communal&quot; space and we all try to<br/>
keep it nice. Dh usually spends a chunk of time keeping it to his<br/>
standard, rather than imposing it upon us. And we all keep it tidier<br/>
than we would on our own. So it&#39;s a great way to meet in the<br/>
middle....and I really function better when it&#39;s neat so it helps me a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the house is up to individuals. Dh has a room with a<br/>
bathroom so he can keep it all however he chooses and the rest of us<br/>
can do the same. I think this strategy probably saved our marriage!:)<br/>

 <br/>
If you feel your needs for clean or not clean are being met, have you  talked <br/>
to your dh about his feelings and his needs?  If he needs a certain  level of <br/>
clean in the house there are  probably many options for him to get  his needs <br/>
met.  More than I am probably thinking of in the moment.   Maybe if all of <br/>
you sat down (children are great at finding creative  solutions) you could talk <br/>
about what it is exactly he needs and work to find a  solution that will fill <br/>
that need without you or the children sacrificing their  own needs in the <br/>
process.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494869579">I have seen several posts here and there lately from women who are<br/>
putting up with this garbage from their husbands. So bear in mind that<br/>
my response is carrying some of that baggage.<br/>
<br/>
Dishes and laundry and dusting and vacuuming are equal opportunity<br/>
activities. There is no restriction on him doing these things. If he has<br/>
time for a hobby, he can give part of that up to make the house as clean<br/>
as he likes. <br/>
<br/>
This is supposed to be a &quot;we&#39;re all in this together&quot; deal. Not some<br/>
sort of arrangement where you get to wait on him and he gets down time.<br/>
<br/>
If I walked into your house and plopped my feet up in front of the TV,<br/>
you might not think much of my conversational ability. <br/>
<br/>
But if I also criticized how your house looked and demanded that you do<br/>
more cleaning, while I rest and, btw, go out with my buddies, I hope you<br/>
would think I was extremely rude.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband has no more right to be rude to you than I do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The irony is, is that I&#39;m the tidier of the two.  dh is a pile person.<br/>
 He doesn&#39;t put things away, he just piles them in boxes, on<br/>
furniture, etc, as can be seen in his room (which is completely his<br/>
own).  In the computer room, which we all share, more of the<br/>
mess is his mail and band stuff.  I am more of a &quot;a place for<br/>
everything and everything in it&#39;s place&quot; person.  It may sound silly,<br/>
but I love organizing the house.  However, I&#39;ve changed a lot as I<br/>
like the kids to have access to the projects and games that they are<br/>
in the middle of.  This leads to lots of stuff being on tables and<br/>
occassionaly on the floor (usually I leave this to the front room<br/>
which is not used by dh).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve reminded dh about how clean and organized the house was prior to<br/>
kids and say that this is where we are right now.  We have a very<br/>
active 8-yo. that has several projects going at once and a 3.5 yo. who<br/>
loves to dump things out and play with 10 things together at a time. <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to work harder on the dishes, but he still isn&#39;t satisfied.<br/>
 I also remind him that no one ever laid on their deathbed and said<br/>
&quot;Gee, I wish I had done more dishes or cleaned the floor more often.&quot;<br/>
 If anything, people mention that they didn&#39;t spend more time with<br/>
their kids.  I don&#39;t like when I feel like I&#39;m being forced to make a<br/>
choice between my kids and housework.  Housework will always be there,<br/>
but not my kids.  They love being with me and are always asking me to<br/>
play with them.  I don&#39;t want to say &quot;no&quot; because of housework<br/>
(although I do, and much more often than I feel good about).  But my<br/>
dh gets so grumpy (right now he&#39;s cleaning the counters and griping<br/>
about how this should already be done).  I tell him that I do need his<br/>
help around the house if he wants it a certain way, but I need him to<br/>
do it without the griping and snide comments.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep working at it.  I like Pam&#39;s idea of getting together the<br/>
whole family and determining how to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  We went<br/>
through this process a while ago, but it definitely needs to be revisited.<br/>
<br/>

LOL do you live with my dh?  His need for order and cleanliness fae<br/>
supercedes mine.  Everyone gave great advice- what we did was rearrange our<br/>
budget and hire a cleaning lady every 3 weeks- eliminates my need to deep<br/>
clean and makes the everyday stuff like dishes, bathroom wipe downs and<br/>
laundry seem more manageable.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I make a game of laundry and the older 2 (8 & 12) help with<br/>
dishes.  Everyone including dh and my 2 yo puts away their own clean laundry<br/>
for the most part. <br/>
<br/>
The other thing *I* do- and this is just how I view it, I remind myself that<br/>
I would not want his job and the pressures of being responsible for making<br/>
enough $$ to support us.  I like what I do.  That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t<br/>

Oh my god!  My husband just let me have it about cleanliness last <br/>
night!!!  I laughed so hard when you asked, &quot;Do you live with my <br/>
husband&quot; because yes!  I think I do!  To be fair to my DH, I was an <br/>
incredible slob when we started dating and that was the only thing he <br/>
ever said he wished he could change about me.  He&#39;s VERY neat and I&#39;m <br/>
world renowned for my messiness.  One time, my sister came over to <br/>
help me move from an apt. many, many years ago and when she got a <br/>
look at my stuff she began humming the Sanford and Son theme song!  <br/>
It was hilarious and still makes me chuckle to this day.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what you said regarding his job, I feel the same way that <br/>
you do.  He has just as many pressures as I do and we&#39;re so lucky <br/>
that he&#39;s able to support us like he does.  What you said totally <br/>
makes sense to me.<br/>

Thank you for sharing this story about yourself!  It made me feel so <br/>
