 </span></blockquote>You left off a really good one:  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  When<br/>
Eowyn casts off the traditional role of &quot;the woman who stays at home<br/>
while the men go off to fight&quot; and then rips her helmet off and<br/>
declares &quot;I am no man!&quot;  I was not the only person in the theater who<br/>
stood up and cheered!<br/>
<br/>
Actually I like to look at movies in not so much terms of how they<br/>
empower women but how women and men treat each other.  That&#39;s much<br/>
more important to me than big strong women characters.  I want to see<br/>
films where I see women *and* men respecting each other.  I get a sick<br/>
feeling in my stomach from films where women trample men as much as I<br/>
do from films where men trample on women.  Maybe it comes from having<br/>
a son and wanting all my children to have healthy relationships and<br/>
respect in those relationships.<br/>
