<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087305358">Hi,<br/>
I have a formerly conventionally schooled daughter aged 14. I feel that she would have been a fabulous unschooler, and should have been unschooled from the start, but I had reasons why I had to go to work full-time and could not stay home and unschool. Consequently, and sadly, she spent 9 years in school and I watched the life get sucked out of her until she just could not take it any more and voluntarily announced that she was not going to High School. <br/>
My question is: How does one start unschooling a child who has had an institutionalized education and is turned off to anything that reeks of having to learn something? Does anyone else have a teenager that is new to unschooling? I am battling the family scrutiny (she isnt DOING anything!) and the parents of her friends (she will never go to college!). I really dont give a horses you-know-what about their opinions, I just need some suggestions about how to inspire my daughter.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322034088">First you need to give her time to deschool.  She may want to read the <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.  Really... just give her time.  My DD was in<br/>
the public school system from K-3... we quickly came to unschooling... it<br/>
took her about 6 months of *nothing* for her to express interest in even<br/>
going to the library to get videos or books about anything she&#39;s interested<br/>
in.  I didn&#39;t push... I knew from hearing all the advice on this group that<br/>
she would eventually come out of the abyss.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689211710">Hello!  I would suggest she or you read Grace Llewelyn&#39;s books - Teenage Liberation Handbook or Real Lives: 11 teenagers who don&#39;t go to school, etc. Better yet, just get the books from your library and leave them laying around so that she can pick them up if she wants to.  I am 36 and I feel that it took me a solid 18 years to get over being institutionalized.  It won&#39;t take her so long with all your love and support but remember that she IS an amazing person and she WILL find her way.  Trust her and trust what she wants to do.  We have a 19 year old young woman in our lives (she lives with us off and on) who was taken out of school when she was 11.  She deschooled for about a year (thanks to her cool, cool mom) and in the last three years has (completely on her own initiative) gone to Not-back-to-school-camp in Oregon (also a Grace Llewelyn thing), spent 3 months working on an organic farm in Japan, worked lots of jobs - scraping money wherever possible, travelled with us<br/>
 and other friends taking care of small children, gone to a midwifery conference in Denmark then spent 5 months working on organic farms in Spain, learned to sew and to garden and to play the piano, read countless books, had a romantic relationship, worked this year at Not-back-to-school-camp as a cook, and many, many other things.  And just let me say that she is not an exceptional person other than in the way that we all are if left to do as we should.  Congratulations to your daughter and to you/your family for supporting her.  She has a strong inner voice that will serve her well I&#39;m sure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800935652">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
I have been a lurker in this group for the past few weeks, but <br/>
you&#39;ve inspired me to &quot;chime in&quot;... although I definitely don&#39;t have <br/>
big answers for you--just wanted to share our situation which sounds <br/>
like it may be similar.  My son is almost 14 (in 8th grade--sounds <br/>
like your daughter is in 9th), and this is his first year out of <br/>
school. We also are new to unschooling/homeschooling, and it was not <br/>
something that we set out to do, as I and my husband both work full-<br/>
time.  Our son, like your daughter, is just not cut out for the <br/>
structure of schooling, and it took a crisis (major meltdown and <br/>
depression starting last spring) for us to realize that school was <br/>
killing him slowly.  We came to unschooling really because no other <br/>
option seemed right for our son... but I was extremely reluctant... <br/>
wondering what the family would think, wondering how I could <br/>
possibly handle this with a full time job (but I work at home which <br/>
helps)... and not really feeling cut out for this AT ALL.  But to <br/>
our son, unschooling sounded like salvation, and it just felt like <br/>
the right thing to do for him.  It&#39;s really hard on me I must admit, <br/>
but in a good way, and he is definitely a much happier person now... <br/>
We are still finding our way though, trying to rid ourselves of all <br/>
of the &quot;shoulds&quot; that really can screw things up!<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things that have helped so far which I&#39;ll just share <br/>
in case they may be helpful to you:<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve heard that does seem to be true is that when a kid <br/>
starts unschooling at a later age, it may take months <br/>
of &quot;decompression&quot; until they can even begin to see what they&#39;d like <br/>
to pursue.  So, your daughter probably needs time to just do nothing <br/>
for a while (or to do whatever she wants to do, even if it&#39;s to <br/>
watch TV all day). I don&#39;t think you can rush this (that&#39;s what I <br/>
keep having to remind myself of all day long). <br/>
<br/>
As for the relatives and friends, you can perhaps tell them (and <br/>
yourself) that the mental health of your daughter is far more <br/>
important than missing a few months of &quot;school&quot;.  In the larger <br/>
scheme of things, taking a few months of her life to chill out from <br/>
what was a very damaging experience, will not sentence her to a life <br/>
of working in McDonald&#39;s... probably just the opposite.  We are just <br/>
starting too, and definitely do NOT have this figured out, but I can <br/>
say that I have seen my son come back to life, and that is far more <br/>
wonderful to see than A&#39;s on a report card.<br/>
<br/>
When we decided to do this, I sent a long e-mail to all the family <br/>
and friends to explain what homeschooling/unschooling was, I laid <br/>
out all the reasons for doing it, all the plusses, as well as all <br/>
the concerns... and how great our son was doing as a result... and <br/>
somehow this seemed to not only appease everyone, but everyone was <br/>
cheering us on!!  Even my father (and believe me, this is EXTREMELY <br/>
out of character for him).  So, I only mention this because it might <br/>
be a way to address everyone&#39;s concerns all at once, and might even <br/>
clarify your own thinking, and it might quiet them down a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Last thing:  I was really afraid that my son would be isolated <br/>
socially, even more so than fearing that he wouldn&#39;t get the proper <br/>
academic education, so I really tried hard to find a couple of group <br/>
activities around his interests.  (We found a chess club and a <br/>
computer animation group)  This was a great move---it made him feel <br/>
like there were others like him out there, and I met some like-<br/>
minded parents who are helpful and supportive.  I&#39;ve had to make <br/>
adjustments to my work schedule to accommodate getting him to these <br/>
classes, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have gone on so long... I should add that we also have a 16-<br/>
yr-old daughter in 11th grade in public school, and she&#39;s doing just <br/>
great there.  She wouldn&#39;t consider unschooling if I paid her a <br/>
million dollars... so, to each their own.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps....<br/>
Linda<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969702844">Thank you for the advice. The fact that you say do nothing makes me feel more relaxed. She wanted to take a Digital Photography course so we enrolled in that at the Community College, but I am wondering if she is not mature enough for that yet. She is skipping tonight to hang out with friends. I just told her the decision was hers to go tonight or not but to remember that whatever she decided, it reflected on her.  I also took her to the bookstore last night at her request and she picked out a couple of books to read.  I guess I just need to relax. Its just hard sometimes to separate out the teenage issues from the deschooling issues and there is other stuff going on as well like we are in the middle of a move and her Dad is recovering from back surgery, so I cant quite quit my job yet. Yikes!<br/>

<br/>
I also have a 14 yo daughter.  This is her 2nd year out of school <br/>
(she left after 6th grade, she&#39;s at the older end of her class age <br/>
range).  I, too, wish I had found unschooling long ago, but I&#39;m at <br/>
least glad to have found it.  <br/>
<br/>
I came across the word unschooling when researching homeschooling.  <br/>
The thing that helped me the most was to read (and I&#39;m STILL <br/>
reading!) anything and everything I could get my hands on about <br/>
unschooling, learning, forgetting, education, whatever called to <br/>
me.  Actually, the first book I read that was like a slap upside the <br/>
head was &quot;Dumbing Us Down:  The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory <br/>
Learning&quot; by John Taylor Gatto.   &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by <br/>
Grace Llewyllyn is good (my daughter won&#39;t read it, I&#39;ve talked <br/>
about it with her), another by the same author is &quot;Guerilla <br/>
Learning:  How to give Your Kids a Read Education with or without <br/>
school&quot;.  Anything by John Holt.<br/>
<br/>
This is our 2nd year and even though I know this is the right path <br/>
for her, I still have my moments of doubt.   I can&#39;t offer as many <br/>
words of wisdom as well as so many of the seasoned unschoolers on <br/>
this list can, but I can share that there are others who pulled an <br/>
older child from school.  <br/>
<br/>
She has to deschool and heal (how long has she been out of <br/>
school?).   The general rule is to allow one month of down time for <br/>
every year your child was in school (and I included daycare, so <br/>
that&#39;s most of her life!).   This is not a hard and fast rule, it <br/>
might take less, it may take longer.   YOU have to deschool as well <br/>
(I call it &quot;dework&quot; sometimes!  I always worked full time).  Give <br/>
her lots of space.  My dd loves computer and video games.   She&#39;s on <br/>
most of the day (unless we have something planned).  Sometimes she <br/>
watches a favorite TV program.   She dislikes reading for pleasure.  <br/>
Her typing and spelling has improved dramatically from playing her <br/>
online games.   She loves to draw.   She just started taking a dance <br/>
class after being inspired by a summer theater camp.  We&#39;re <br/>
exploring places to take horseback riding lessons and working with <br/>
the animals, after going horseback riding this summer during a <br/>
camping trip.   She wants to do something with animals for her <br/>
life&#39;s work.<br/>
<br/>
She was getting frequent migraine headaches towards the end of her <br/>
last year in school.  She frequently was stressed and anxious.  She <br/>
gave up because the teachers didn&#39;t understand how she learns and <br/>
thinks (despite my attempts to educate *them* - they thought she <br/>
just wasn&#39;t trying hard enough).   Now she gets as much sleep as she <br/>
needs and is much more relaxed and confident.  No migraines.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not expressing myself very well tonight.  If you&#39;re interested <br/>
in reading some of the things I&#39;ve posted about as someone new to <br/>
unschooling with a teenager, search the archives under my name <br/>
(jlh44music).   There are others in a similar situation as well.<br/>
<br/>
Read.   Absorb.   Ask questions.  Expect that your concept of school <br/>
and learning will be challenged and thrown out of wack.  Be open to <br/>
new ideas.  Stop trying to inspire her.  She needs time to find her <br/>
own way.<br/>

My question is: How does one start unschooling a child who has had an<br/>
institutionalized education and is turned off to anything that reeks of <br/>
having<br/>
to learn something?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
1) Change your language. Understand the difference between teaching and <br/>
learning. Between have to and choose to. Between now and when I&#39;m ready.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have a teenager that is new to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not new to unschooling---he&#39;s now 18 and left school at the end of <br/>
sixth grade.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am battling the family scrutiny (she isnt DOING anything!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Tell them you&#39;d be happy to discuss uschooling with them AFTER they <br/>
read the following articles, books, and websites. (Give them a nice, <br/>
long list of *homework*.) They can&#39;t intelligently discuss something <br/>
they know *nothing* about, so until they research the subject and are <br/>
knowledgeable enough to carry on a decent discussion, the subject is <br/>
off-limits. Period.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
and the parents of her friends (she will never go to college!).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
What does it matter to *them*??? Seriously, why is it important to them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==<br/>
<br/>
I really dont give a horses you-know-what about their opinions, I just <br/>
need some suggestions about how to<br/>
inspire my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
BE inspiring yourself! Be interested in things. Be interesting. Have <br/>
hobbies and new things in your life. Go places. Do things. Be curious. <br/>
Be fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She is admittedly more relaxed these days, and I am not<br/>
pushing her, but what does unschooling look like given this situation?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, not much. Seriously. It may simply look like TV and <br/>
computers and the telephone. Oh---and sleep. Lots and lots of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But given time, it will look like soooo much more. Respect your child. <br/>
Let her heal---she&#39;s still hurting. Trust that she&#39;s getting what she <br/>
needs right now----even if it&#39;s the 400th rerun of That 70s Show! <br/>
Patience. Trust. Respect. More patience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been there and done that. It wasn&#39;t pretty.<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t have to answer to ANYBODY other than your daughter. Keep <br/>
others out of your lives for a while. Enjoy your daughter--watch <br/>
movies, eat at new restaurants, go to the zoo, travel. Just do fun <br/>
stuff for a while. Then KEEP doing it---that what unschooling is!<br/>

lot of time to get that institutionalization out of her.  :-)  Start<br/>
saying no less and yes more.  Be with her when she watches tv, plays<br/>
computer games, vegges outside watching clouds go by.  Pursue your own<br/>
passions and invite her along.  It may take her a year (or more)<br/>
before you start to value what she is doing as learning.  And you need<br/>
to deschool yourself as well.  You&#39;ve had probably twice (if not more)<br/>
schooling thoughts than she has.  One important thing to remember is<br/>
that she is not going to necessarily pick up a math book one day and<br/>
start doing algebra and what she does do may not look like the<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; that you know now.  Read Sandra Dodd&#39;s website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling</a>  Read the archives here.  Read<br/>

got homework!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854766321">First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded with words of advice on my post about my daughter. I feel more relaxed about the unschooling since I found this community. I belong to another homeschooling list, and I am finding that the unschoolers are more in line with my thinking. It helps to read this list because it is a constant reminder or shall we say affirmation that allowing my daughter time to &quot;deschool&quot; is the right thing to do. Sometimes it is difficult when I am not surrounded on a daily basis in real life with people who share my values on this, and have to deal with the parents of her schooled friends, the neighbors, family, etc. <br/>
One thing I did do was what someone else sugessted on this board: document in &quot;schooled terms&quot; everything she does that can be considered educational or schoolish, and I have a good list of documentation so if anyone pokes their nose into our business, I have stuff for show and tell. <br/>
As for Not Back To School Camp, she attended this past summer and had a WONDERFUL time! I had shown her the website and asked her if she thought it would be a good way to meet other homeschoolers and she decided on her own to go. I put her on a train alone at night in Emmeryville Ca for a 17 hour trip to Oregon. (Wait, Mom....you wont let me take the bus across town at night but I can take a train at night to another state?) I gave her &quot;Life Skills&quot; credit for that. Anyway, she did the Natural Building workshop and a lot of other stuff including belly and swing dancing. And she wants to go back next year for the whole two weeks. She was amazed at the unschoolers and commented how accomplished they were &quot;at more than one thing!,&quot; and that they were more educated than her peers. So I know she will be fine....i just need to trust the process and not be influenced by everyone else. <br/>
thanks again to all and I will keep reading!<br/>

Hello! I would suggest she or you read Grace Llewelyn&#39;s books - Teenage Liberation Handbook or Real Lives: 11 teenagers who don&#39;t go to school, etc. Better yet, just get the books from your library and leave them laying around so that she can pick them up if she wants to. I am 36 and I feel that it took me a solid 18 years to get over being institutionalized. It won&#39;t take her so long with all your love and support but remember that she IS an amazing person and she WILL find her way. Trust her and trust what she wants to do. We have a 19 year old young woman in our lives (she lives with us off and on) who was taken out of school when she was 11. She deschooled for about a year (thanks to her cool, cool mom) and in the last three years has (completely on her own initiative) gone to Not-back-to-school-camp in Oregon (also a Grace Llewelyn thing), spent 3 months working on an organic farm in Japan, worked lots of jobs - scraping money wherever possible, travelled with us<br/>
and other friends taking care of small children, gone to a midwifery conference in Denmark then spent 5 months working on organic farms in Spain, learned to sew and to garden and to play the piano, read countless books, had a romantic relationship, worked this year at Not-back-to-school-camp as a cook, and many, many other things. And just let me say that she is not an exceptional person other than in the way that we all are if left to do as we should. Congratulations to your daughter and to you/your family for supporting her. She has a strong inner voice that will serve her well I&#39;m sure!<br/>

I think you should let her do what she wants. Watch T.V., listen to her <br/>
radio, talk on the phone, nd whatever else she might do during the day. You <br/>
have to give her time to de-school. It may appear that she is doing nothing, <br/>
but she is! When your home take her with you to the store or bank or <br/>
whatever if she wants. If not, let her have some down time. I wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
anything to her or for her as far as academics go unless she ask. Maybe get <br/>
her few subscriptions to whatever magazines she likes if you want her <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, start reading up on unschooling, look at web sites, read <br/>
the blogs, and stay on these type list. It will take a natural course.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t &quot;Unschooled&quot; until my freshman year of highschool and I went to <br/>
college. It was a waste of my time for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
When I started unschooling It didn&#39;t look like I was doing anything for <br/>
almost a year, and even then it was slow. I had to learn a new thinking <br/>
pattern and redefine my own image of education. My parents had tried to show <br/>
me how to unschool, it was annoying. But when they showed me by example that <br/>
they were still students of life, I learned to become a student of my own <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] New and with a teenager<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2006 21:45:04 +0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;I have a formerly conventionally schooled daughter aged 14. I feel that she <br/>
&gt;would have been a fabulous unschooler, and should have been unschooled from <br/>
&gt;the start, but I had reasons why I had to go to work full-time and could <br/>
&gt;not stay home and unschool. Consequently, and sadly, she spent 9 years in <br/>
&gt;school and I watched the life get sucked out of her until she just could <br/>
&gt;not take it any more and voluntarily announced that she was not going to <br/>
&gt;High School.<br/>
&gt;My question is: How does one start unschooling a child who has had an <br/>
&gt;institutionalized education and is turned off to anything that reeks of <br/>
&gt;having to learn something? Does anyone else have a teenager that is new to <br/>
&gt;unschooling? I am battling the family scrutiny (she isnt DOING anything!) <br/>
&gt;and the parents of her friends (she will never go to college!). I really <br/>
&gt;dont give a horses you-know-what about their opinions, I just need some <br/>
&gt;suggestions about how to inspire my daughter. She is admittedly more <br/>
&gt;relaxed these days, and I am not pushing her, but what does unschooling <br/>
&gt;look like given this situation?<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to invite you and anyone else who unschools within driving<br/>
distance of Emeryville, CA to join the &quot;SFBUN&quot; group on Yahoo.  (SFBUN<br/>
stands for San Francisco Bay Unschoolers Network, I think.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got a picnic scheduled TODAY in Kensington (that may rain out)<br/>
and a game day at a Berkeley cafe tomorrow and a fun Halloween event<br/>
coming up.  If your daughter liked the unschooled teens she met at<br/>
NBTSC, then maybe she&#39;d enjoy meeting more kids that are local.  (If<br/>
you live a long drive from Emeryville, then I apologize for torturing<br/>
you.)<br/>
<br/>
This is a fun group and I think most all of it&#39;s members would be<br/>
happy if the group got bigger.<br/>
<br/>
link : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SFBUN/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SFBUN/</a><br/>
<br/>
I enjoy our online long distance relationships, but would be enthused<br/>
about meeting more people locally.<br/>
<br/>
(OK, back to the main topic.)<br/>

I can&#39;t recommend NBTSCamp (and the L&L Conference, of course!) enough.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so helpful for teens to see other teens living this lifestyle. <br/>
Helps them to realize that we parents aren&#39;t crazy either! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Smart, interested, interesting, full of life! It&#39;s just wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron went to NBTSCamp in West Virgnia last year. This year he went <br/>
to the Oregon AND the Vermont camps.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a powerful week. And they get to meet so many neat teens. <br/>
Unfortunately, several that Cam met were unschooling withOUT parental <br/>
involvement. The had just quit school and were trying to better <br/>
themselves completely on their own. That&#39;s hard. One boy got home from <br/>
camp and was immediately grounded because he hadn&#39;t cleaned his room <br/>
before he left for camp. :-(  So many of the kids don&#39;t have the <br/>
home-life that our kids do. That was eye-opening for Cameron!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---back to the point: &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s really good for kids to see other <br/>
kids living this lifestyle. I&#39;d make it a priority to let my child <br/>
connect with other unschoolers as much as possible. Plan <br/>
parties/camp-outs/whatever! Get them in touch with each other!<br/>

&gt; As for Not Back To School Camp, she attended this past summer and had a<br/>

&gt; thought it<br/>
&gt; would be a good way to meet other homeschoolers and she decided on her <br/>
&gt; own to<br/>
&gt; go. I put her on a train alone at night in Emmeryville Ca for a 17 hour <br/>
&gt; trip to<br/>
&gt; Oregon. (Wait, Mom....you wont let me take the bus across town at night <br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; can take a train at night to another state?) I gave her &quot;Life Skills&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m also planning a Regional Unschooling Conference for the Spring. That will have some form to it. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ll keep everyone posted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152221697">It also depends on what part of northern CA you&#39;re in.  The Bay area is<br/>
considered northern by most people, but it&#39;s 5 hours from the border.  Just<br/>
for comparison, it takes us 9 hours to drive from Bend, OR to the South Bay<br/>
(all depends on traffic too).<br/>
