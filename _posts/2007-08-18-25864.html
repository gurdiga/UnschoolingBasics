I have posted Field notes 2 at my blog, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ourmenagerie@...">ourmenagerie@...</a>. The above link is a website of my Dad&#39;s but the last choice will show some photos of us. I wish I had had time to figure out how to put these on my blog. And I will, but have worked about 75 hours per week the 2 weeks the kids have been gone to help pay for our month in NC and there&#39;s been no time to learn how to put photos on the blog.  I am sorry for the inconvenience for anyone who wants to look.  Thanks...Cameron_._,___<br/>
