Unschooling can be thought about and pondered on but it won&#39;t happen<br/>
until you do it.  You won&#39;t really understand about human learning until<br/>
you see it happen without coercion, without teaching, without<br/>
requirements.  You have to do it to believe it. You have to believe it<br/>
before you can see it.   <br/>
<br/>
There is a folder at the message board for unschooling an only child at <br/>
www.unschooling.info .<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling an only child is blissful. &lt;g&gt;  There&#39;s so much time for<br/>
conversation, few to no scheduling conflicts, so much flexibility.  It<br/>
will be the easiest, most natural, wonderful thing you&#39;ll ever do, like<br/>
giving birth again, only without the pain. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Congratulations! You&#39;ll probably want to just deschool for awhile. Just stop the curriculum and take a break. Declare a vacation and relax together. Go to the movies, take a nap, go out to lunch, take a walk, read a magazine, whatever. Pretend it&#39;s a weekend for the next 6 months. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628069802">Hey Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and can relate to your feelings!  So how has the<br/>
plunge been?  Today my kids just played outside and I was so tempted to<br/>
get out the spelling books but I didn&#39;t.  I can&#39;t say we&#39;ve officially<br/>
taken the plunge  but I&#39;m wanting to.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t been &quot;all day workbook homeschoolers&quot; but usually did<br/>
&quot;school&quot; from 9-1130 mostly covering math, bible, spelling and language.<br/>
Free reading time whenever they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m mostly nervous about my 12 yr old.  He talks of going to<br/>
college and all the questions arise in my mind.  How will he learn to<br/>
write essays, know grammar, advanced math, and enough to do well on the<br/>
ACT if he chooses to pursue college?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?  How about moms who unschooled and kids are in<br/>
college?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!!!!  Glad to have found this site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024326204">Well, everything has been great. Shareen slept late (9:30, very late <br/>
for her), we babysat for a friend of mine until about 12:00, we went <br/>
skating, and then went to another friend&#39;s house (with 4 children that <br/>
my dd likes to play with) and stayed until 10:00pm (past my normal <br/>
bedtime!). I just want to thank everyone for the encouragement, <br/>
stories, advice, and support that I have found here. Although I don&#39;t <br/>
post a lot, I read what other people post all the time and I find it <br/>
very inspiring, to say the least. You guys are helping me out when you <br/>
don&#39;t even know it! To see Shareen counting her tickets that she and a <br/>
friend won at the skating rink and dividing them up evenly would seem <br/>
like no big deal, but to me, this dd of mine freezes on tests and on <br/>
on-the-spot questions, it took everything I had not to yell &quot;LOOK, <br/>
You&#39;re using math!!!&quot;. And the interest she showed in the eggs in the <br/>
incubator at our local teaching supply store (where we stopped to look <br/>
for a computer game)! She actually asked the lady behind the counter <br/>
all kinds of questions (who gave them the eggs, how long do they stay <br/>
in the incubator, how long have they already been in there, etc). I <br/>
couldn&#39;t help but grin and encourage her. Ok, now I&#39;m just rambling...I <br/>
am going to love this unschooling/deschooling/lifelearning/whatever!</div>

<br/>
I know that there have been quite a few posts from unschooling parents about<br/>
their high school/college age unschoolers and how their doing with all of<br/>
that stuff that you question.  There is a search option on the groups home<br/>
page... you might want to look around at the old posts and see what you find<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and take the plunge!  It will be one of the most refreshing things you<br/>
ve ever done!  :)<br/>

I have a just-turned 18 year old who is on & off contemplating college. <br/>
He sat in on one sociology class two years ago.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll learn to write by writing for real.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll learn grammar if you use proper grammar with him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll learn advanced math is he&#39;s interested.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll do well on the SAT/ACT if he gets a book/computer program and <br/>
studies them.<br/>
<br/>
College entry isn&#39;t as black and white as high schools would like for <br/>
you to believe! &lt;g&gt; *Many* more ways to skin a cat if you want to!<br/>
