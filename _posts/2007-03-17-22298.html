Well, it can mean honestly and sincerely, &quot;May God bless him.&quot; <br/>

undergoing difficulties.<br/>

But, if said snidely, it means, &quot;What a dumb-ass!&quot;<br/>

fact that I live in an area called Dimal - that&#39;s really the name! The <br/>
bank ladies, especially, love to bless my heart. I have heard it said <br/>
kindly - once wrt a death and once when I mentioned my stepson moving <br/>
in with me. But usually its the meanest thing a &quot;respectable church <br/>
lady&quot; can say in public.<br/>
