<div id="ygrps-yiv-162164221">I am a part of this group, because I am unschooling my younger <br/>

year, and loves it.<br/>
<br/>
DD2, has no idea...we&#39;ve gone from Florida Institue of Tech, to <br/>
University of New Hampshire she is not applying, nor really seems <br/>
interested...ok...so, what can she do?  what will she enjoy?  what <br/>
are her options?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like she needs a year of deschooling, huh?  <br/>
<br/>
I figured I would ask the wise and worldly unschoolers on this <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398458708">Check out the book &quot;The Uncollege Alternative.&quot;  I think you can probably get it on amazon.  There&#39;s lots of ideas in there. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you ask *her* those questions, what does she say: I don&#39;t know? <br/>
She may really not know. She may really need to deschool the way so <br/>
many kids do when they first start unschooling - just take some time <br/>
off, decompress, and learn who she really is. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some ways to approach these questions - does she have any <br/>
hobbies? Has she been involved in any clubs that she liked? Are there <br/>
things she&#39;d like to try - even just dabble in? Would she like to get <br/>
a job - maybe even just a part time job for the holidays? <br/>
<br/>
I think its important to let her know that she doesn&#39;t have to find <br/>
The Right Thing to Do With Her Life right now - maybe not ever. Many <br/>
people change jobs, careers, whole lifestyles. Sometimes more than <br/>
once. I&#39;ve turned my whole life upside down a few times!<br/>
<br/>
I got a great piece of advice, once upon a time, about grad school <br/>
that could just as well apply to college, which was: &quot;don&#39;t go until <br/>
you&#39;re motivated and don&#39;t worry about *getting* motivated - it will <br/>
happen when (and if) it happens!&quot; <br/>
