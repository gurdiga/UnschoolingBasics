Your Mom may be old like me. :)<br/>
<br/>
At a certain point you learn, or not, that this is your problem. Holding onto it is your problem. You will not change the in-laws any more than they will change you. <br/>
<br/>
Once you learn to let go of wanting the relationship to be more than it ever can be, you will be able to do it. Until then, you will continue to bang your head against the wall insisting that you can somehow magically change them. <br/>
<br/>
Which is fine and dandy as a hobby. :)<br/>
<br/>
I would just suggest that your DH and son be excused from this exercise in futility. Especially son. DH can fend for himself but a hurtful arrow fired by Gramma can be just too much for a young heart. <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s me. I am old and mean. You do what you need to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938801765">---I am fortunate that alot of my family has not voiced any concerns or negativity to me except one person. I told them these are my children and I will do what feels right for us! <br/>
I get alot of socialization comments and I reply to them this: <br/>
&quot; do you send your children to school to socialize or to learn?&quot;<br/>

This made me laugh.  I&#39;ll just use that reason from now on, that I&#39;m old and mean :).  This one is going on *my* fridge.  I&#39;ve read this thread with interest, because the situation discussed is very similar to mine with my in-laws.  I&#39;ve done nothing *and* I&#39;ve bent over backwards trying to please them, all to the same no-win result.  It&#39;s so much more fun to do nothing.  Recently a friend suggested I write all about my &#39;ideal family&#39; (which included being best friends with my in-laws) and then burn it - very insightful and freeing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667791428">Thanks Nance.  I feel like you are right.  It&#39;s hard for me to let go.<br/>

By the way, judging by the words and sentiment you have communicated to me,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t consider you &quot;mean.&quot;  To me you seem honest, frank and practical.<br/>
