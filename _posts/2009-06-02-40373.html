<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462991083">Oh it is SO worth it! The flavor and texture is so amazing. DS says that<br/>
it tastes sweeter (with less sweetener) - makes sense, all the vital<br/>
oils in whole grains start going rancid as soon as the grain is ground.<br/>
We spent much time (better part of 2008) comparing prices on mills,<br/>
checking prices on grains, comparing that to the store bought organic<br/>
whole wheat flour we usually purchased and to comparable loaves of bread<br/>
at the store (a real whole grain wheat bread with no HFCS or<br/>
hydrogenated oils runs somewhere in the $3-$4 range at best, more if<br/>
it&#39;s also certified organic ingredients). When grain prices jumped over<br/>
the last year or so, it started making more sense to do our own. The key<br/>
to it all is having a reliable source for the grain (which we are<br/>
fortunate to have - we order through the co-op market we shop at and get<br/>
50 lb sacks of wheat every 2 to 3 months). <br/>
