<div id="ygrps-yiv-735926993">Hi!  I&#39;m new to the group but not to unschooling.  My kids have never <br/>
been to school but I was a former teacher so I had a lot of unlearning <br/>
to do and I&#39;m still unlearning.  I have a dd who is 11 and a ds who is <br/>
10.  My ds suffers from a birth defect in his kidney&#39;s arteries.  His <br/>
artery is too small to allow blood to flow smoothly so it causes him to <br/>
have high blood pressure.If he ellivates it drastically he could hve a <br/>
stroke.  He does so well anymore though physically because he is home <br/>
and doesn&#39;t have the stress that the typical child who would have gone <br/>
to school would have had to endure.  Trying to find a balance as well <br/>
at home, we try to live as stressfree and peacful as possible for him.  <br/>
He is on medications for his condition.  My struggle is video/ computer <br/>
games.  They are a big no no for his health.  He doesn&#39;t have an actual <br/>
video type of gaming system for this reason but his best friend does <br/>
and he is like a kid in a cnady store who is not allowed.  We try our <br/>
hardest to live  by &quot;unschool&quot; standards and allow natural consequence <br/>
to occur.  I don&#39;t want him to stress his condition etc...  My dh and I <br/>
have discussed this and are unsure what to do behaviorally about it.  <br/>
We are feaful of our ds having a stroke when he goes to his friends to <br/>
play.  Help! Thanks Anna</div>

he&#39;ll enjoy them so much that his<br/>
blood pressure will rise & result in a stroke?  One reason we encourage<br/>
families not to make something off-limits, like you&#39;ve done with gaming, is<br/>
that the results are often what you describe &quot;like a kid in a candy store&quot;.<br/>
Of course, he&#39;ll be that way.  Why wouldn&#39;t he?  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to<br/>
allow gaming in your own home, so he can learn, with your assistance, how to<br/>
play these games safely?  Couldn&#39;t he learn how to self-regulate, learn his<br/>
own body&#39;s signals of when he might need to take a break and so forth?  Then<br/>
when he&#39;s exposed to gaming in his friends homes, it won&#39;t be something<br/>
special.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048517702">if he is going to go out of your home to play these things you might <br/>
want to consider how to make them safe at home.<br/>
<br/>
How are video games more stressful than anything eles he does? How <br/>
do you know that playing video games WILL give him a stroke? if he <br/>
is already playing them at friends houses with no stroke then how <br/>
will he be able to trust you. If he knows that basicaly ANYTHING <br/>
could cause a stroke and chooses to live life doing what he enjoys <br/>
than why begrudge him that. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem with rules is that once kids are beyond the reach of  <br/>
rules, they can do anything they want.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of life skills, forbidding him and then hoping he&#39;ll forbid  <br/>
himself once you&#39;re not around, isn&#39;t a great strategy. I worked with  <br/>
a woman with a 20-ish son who had diabetes that she controlled  <br/>
according to the &quot;rules&quot; for diabetics. And boy was he self  <br/>
destructive. She couldn&#39;t understand why he was fighting what made  <br/>
sense and she was distraught. It was pretty obvious to me that he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t fighting common sense but her control.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how sensible the control, control is something to fight  <br/>
against. It&#39;s just human nature.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My struggle is video/ computer<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you need to reexamine that statement. It&#39;s not video games  <br/>
that are a no no. It&#39;s getting stressed -- at least from what you  <br/>
write -- that&#39;s a no no. I truly doubt there have been studies done  <br/>
that showed video games cause strokes in kids with your son&#39;s  <br/>
condition. It&#39;s just an item put on a list by a researcher who took a  <br/>
guess at things that might raise blood pressure. Then it became an  <br/>
official &quot;no no&quot; because it seemed like some expert must have studied  <br/>
this extensively.<br/>
<br/>
You could forbid him to see the friend, but that sets him up to learn  <br/>
to lie and sneak. You could forbid him to play games away from home,  <br/>
but how exactly will you make that work? Strap a video camera to him?<br/>
<br/>
Until *he* chooses not to play video games, there isn&#39;t a way for you  <br/>
to stop him.<br/>
<br/>
You could fill him full of fear that he&#39;ll have a stroke if he plays  <br/>
video games (or anything that you want him to avoid doing) but if he  <br/>
plays and doesn&#39;t have a stroke, he *knows* it&#39;s not a given. He  <br/>
*can* play and not have a stroke. (And the stress of disobeying to do  <br/>
something he loves could be far worse than video games!)<br/>
<br/>
*Much* better to help him play in a safe way. Work *with* him to be  <br/>
aware of his body, to take breaks when he starts feeling a certain  <br/>
way. Come up with *a lot* of strategies and tweak them. Be his  <br/>
partner in helping him live rather than his guardian.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t keep him home forever. Life is stressful. *Way* better to  <br/>
find methods to help him cope with stress than avoiding it.<br/>
