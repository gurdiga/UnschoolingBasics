<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954538025">We love our magazines a lot. <br/>
<br/>
We get Ranger Rick, Highlights, Puzzlemania, Muse. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also like Disney Magazine, Readers Digest, Skateboarding,and Pony <br/>
Magazine. <br/>
<br/>
We subscribe to all the free flyers from skate stores and knife and <br/>
armour catalogs too. <br/>
<br/>
Our very favorite is the Game Informer. It gives reviews and rating <br/>
and lets you know what games are worth the money and what games are <br/>
better for a rental. My kids read that one from front to back.<br/>
<br/>
We have also gotten the National Geographics Kids and Weekly Reader <br/>
in the past.<br/>
<br/>
My kids always pick up car catalogs from the news stand and then <br/>
plan which car each of them will be getting.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the Life Learning Magazine and I subscribe to <br/>
Connections Ezine, although my password did not work for the last <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck picking;]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Connections is an online &quot;magazine&quot; - no paper involved. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org/">http://connections.organiclearning.org/</a> is where it lives. There&#39;s a <br/>
sample &quot;issue 0&quot; there to look at and a link to subscribe ($10 US, <br/>
payable by PayPal or you can probably just mail a check. Danielle <br/>
Conger is the &quot;editor in chief&quot; and your truly (okay I <br/>
was &quot;secretary/transcriptionist&quot; for my guys) has an article about <br/>
Lego BrikWars in an upcoming issue. There are articles from all sorts <br/>
of folks, regular columns even as well as tidbits from various <br/>
groups&#39; &quot;hot topics&quot;. There are a couple of unschooler dads that <br/>
contribute regularly (Ben Lovejoy for one) which might be handy for <br/>
those spouses/partners who can&#39;t quite get their arms around the idea <br/>
and prefer something from &quot;a guy&#39;s perspective&quot;. What&#39;s nice is that <br/>
you can just provide a short article, not a book, not even a WHOLE <br/>
magazine.<br/>
