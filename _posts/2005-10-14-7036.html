<div id="ygrps-yiv-801622665">Hi all :)<br/>
<br/>
So today I sent out a letter of intent to HS to the superintendant and <br/>
principal. The moment I mailed out the letters I felt a weight <br/>
lifted...i feel so free! I&#39;ve just started reading,&quot;Dumbing Us Down-The <br/>
Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot; by John Taylor Gatto. Still <br/>
waiting for the Unschooling book I put on hold on the library. Jio was <br/>
thrilled to hear he would be able to stay home :) He spent his day <br/>
playing video games and computer games. <br/>

I love John Taylor Gatto, and this book was one of the first ones I <br/>
read that really changed how I look at public education.   Keep us <br/>
posted about what you think!   Have you read any John Holt yet?  <br/>
Awesome stuff as well.   There are so many great books....<br/>

I&#39;ve read them all (and more!)!   I started with Raising your <br/>
spirited child back when my dd was younger, before I even considered <br/>
homeschooling.   ANYTHING by Holt is good (How children Learn, How <br/>
children fail, Learning all the Time).  Google him and you&#39;ll find <br/>
stuff too.   My books are still in boxes (although I DID find them <br/>
earlier!  I need to get them out, I MISS THEM!).   Once I get them <br/>
out, I&#39;m going to make a LIST in word so I can pass it on!<br/>
