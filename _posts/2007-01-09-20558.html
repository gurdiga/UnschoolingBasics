the organisms in your mouth eat what you eat they give off an acidic <br/>

mineral content in this acidic environment ( demineralization) but <br/>
low and behold the saliva has minerals and as the acid is neutralized <br/>
the minerals in saliva are taken back into the enamel ( <br/>
remineralization) so you always have a minerals going out and back in <br/>
processs. fluride is supposed to help the minerals not get leached <br/>
out as much, so you take in more.  a cavity is when the mineral  <br/>
break down in the enamel goes to the point where the next layer of <br/>
the tooth is involved ( the dentin) now the dentin is not as dense (  <br/>
mineralized ) as the enamel so if it demineralizes it does it quicker <br/>
and starts to undermine the foundation of the above enamel ( read <br/>
cave in) thats the idea why you need a filling ; some dentists are <br/>
cautious ( read greedy) and will fill even small notches in enamel. <br/>
sugar is just a type of food that the germies eat rather quickly ( <br/>
simpler structure to break down and ingest) thats whay it is bad, a <br/>
lot of acid a lot of demineralizing. now pretzels , not as quick to <br/>
eat but stick to teeth so around longer and more time for the evil <br/>
crew to chow down. <br/>
 solutions brush or jush swish with some water to neutralize the <br/>
acid. <br/>
some kids / adults have tougher more mineralized teeth and more <br/>
minerals available in salvia , or perhaps mouth is not as tilted to <br/>
acidic scale of PH so they defy prognosis.<br/>
 that said , this is a theory. I certainly have seen it not have any <br/>
bearing on individuals but it seems somewhat maybe probable ( like we <br/>
like to live in newton world that really ain&#39;t existing via current <br/>
physics)<br/>
 alternate theory : we should never get out teeth cleaned the body <br/>
builds up mineralized deposits from the dead micro-organisms ( <br/>
calculus or tartar) and this protects teeth from decay, we look <br/>
different but perhaps we can carve intricate sculpural edifices into <br/>
out calculus encrusted mouths and open the next golden age of <br/>
artistic renewal<br/>
