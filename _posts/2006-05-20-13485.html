<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053449824">As usual I&#39;m a couple of days behind, and for some reason this list just<br/>
really seems to mesh with events in my life.    Just this morning I was<br/>
reading in &quot;What to Expect the Toddler Years&quot;, a book I only read<br/>
occasionally since I know that along with some of the good information it<br/>
contains a lot of bad advice and information.  Anyway, the part I read dealt<br/>
with explaining the facts of life, in light of the recent posts I wanted to<br/>
share what it said.  It really explained it in a way I thought was good.<br/>
They gave seven points on dealing with the facts of life.  First of all it<br/>
said &quot;Don&#39;t dodge the issue.&quot;  It could make your child feel shameful about<br/>
making babies, or about his curiosity.   Secondly it said to &quot;keep a united<br/>
front&quot; make sure that anyone who might be discussing the issue with your<br/>
child agree on the approach and use the same terminology.  It also said to<br/>
&quot;Give it to him straight.&quot;  They reiterated what several of you have said<br/>
about shaking his faith in you when he learns the exact truth.  The next<br/>
point was to &quot;Use the correct terminology.&quot;  One important point I felt they<br/>
made was &quot;to give only as much information as is asked for&quot;.  From the book:<br/>
If the child asks where the baby is tell him it&#39;s in the uterus or &quot;womb&quot;<br/>
not the tummy.  If she asks how it got there say that &quot;Mommy and Daddy love<br/>
each other a lot and love you so much, they wanted to make another baby.  So<br/>
Daddy put his sperm into Mommy.  And that sperm got together with a tiny<br/>
egg, called an ovum, that was inside Mommy all along, and they grew into a<br/>
baby.  Explain the biological part of the process only; for now, stay away<br/>
from the sexual aspects.  If she asks how the sperm got there just say<br/>
through the vagina. If she keeps persisting you can explain that Daddy&#39;s<br/>
penis put his sperm into Mommy&#39;s vagina.  The sperm met the egg and a baby<br/>
began to grow.  And the last point they made was to &quot;Give the child<br/>
perspective&quot; by showing pictures of when you were pregnant before, and<br/>
children&#39;s books that show a baby growing in the uterus.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I thought this was a good way to explain so I wanted to share.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard that point made many times and I don&#39;t agree with it at  <br/>
all. IF it said, &quot;Be careful not to get carried away and overwhelm  <br/>
the child with too much information, too fast,&quot; then I&#39;d agree. IF it  <br/>
said, &quot;Be sure you understand their question before you launch into a  <br/>
lengthy explanation of what you &#39;think&#39; they want to know,&quot; then I&#39;d  <br/>
agree.<br/>
<br/>
But I always give a little extra information, beyond just what is  <br/>
asked for, and then wait and see if that&#39;s appreciated or brings on  <br/>
more questions.<br/>
<br/>
No different than the way I engage with my kids on other topic of  <br/>
conversation that ever comes up.<br/>
