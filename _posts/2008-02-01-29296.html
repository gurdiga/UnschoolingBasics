<div id="ygrps-yiv-555213665">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group and thought I would introduce myself and my<br/>
almost 9-year-old daughter Hannah.<br/>
<br/>
We began our unschooling adventure on Monday! So much has<br/>
unfolded for us already. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading everything I can and I have been enjoying the wisdom and<br/>
experience that is being shared in this group.<br/>
<br/>
I also started a blog yesterday called &quot;In Her Footsteps&quot; to document our<br/>
adventure and just published my second post. My first post tells a little<br/>
about Hannah and my story.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to read it you can go to<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear your comments if you have the time or inclination.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank Ren for her words suggestion to check out Thing A Day.<br/>
We&#39;ve signed up. What fun!<br/>
<br/>
I have another daughter, Madeleine, who is 11, and has chosen to<br/>
remain in public school. I deeply honor her choice and have left the<br/>
door open to alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and we&#39;re happy to be here!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Nancy and Hannah<br/>
