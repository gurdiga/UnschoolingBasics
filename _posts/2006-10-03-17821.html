child starts a  path and falters or stumbles, YES I want to be able to<br/>

they wish to continue to do, then great!  Not only do I think that we<br/>
are supposed to be there to help them along the way, but I *want* to<br/>
be there.  I realize that one day my children will most likely venture<br/>
off on their owns.  Maybe sooner than I want them too (maybe later,<br/>
who knows.)  But I am not going to begrudge them the assistance that<br/>
they need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642984258">Actually, I totally agree.  My mother-in-law lives with us.  My parents live down the road.  The extended family is an awesome idea.  My oldest wishes to live in Europe but would like us to build a house big enough to house her (and her future family) when they are in the states.  My youngest (8) plans on living on our twenty acre farm for the rest of his life and has already told us that he plans to care for us as we care for his grandmother.   We really need to get that bigger house built.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126464982">Yesyesyes! Why has our society adapted SO much that this sounds  <br/>
bizarre? It happens all over the world, for a long time! I think we&#39;d  <br/>
need a MUCH bigger house though ;-) if all our kids got married and  <br/>
started families with us.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Emily&#39;s life goal is to get married and be a mom *with* me,  <br/>
not like me, but WITH me. yay!<br/>
