<div id="ygrps-yiv-520613523">It&#39;s basically the same in Texas.  All students take the  Accuplacer<br/>
(used to be THEA).  It covers math, reading and writing. Everyone takes it<br/>
unless they score over a certain number on their TAKS tests, Texas&#39;<br/>
standardized testing given all through Elementary-High school.  (have to be<br/>
passed to graduate)<br/>
<br/>
My older kids all graduated or got their GED, which was required for<br/>
admittance.<br/>
Haven&#39;t had the experience of entering as homeschooler yet.<br/>
