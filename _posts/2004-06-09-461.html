<div id="ygrps-yiv-792640322">Hello to everyone.  My name is Cheryl.  I am deschooling myself and <br/>
my husband and unschooling my two sons, Nat 11.5 and Joel 3.5.  We <br/>
pulled out of the school system last year and started school at <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
My son attended the same elementary school from K through the fifth <br/>
grade with only two good years out of six.  I have to say that he had <br/>
an excellent teacher in the second grade, one of those who manages to <br/>
inspire a whole classroom full of children with a love of learning.  <br/>
And while I now feel so strongly about unschooling that my youngest <br/>
will never set foot in a school, I would like to give credit to that <br/>
extremely rare creature, the wonderful teacher.  Yes friends, they do <br/>
exist, however endangered they may be.<br/>
<br/>
But I was never one of those Mom&#39;s who cheered the first day of <br/>
school. And I always resented the homework.  I mean, if I allow the <br/>
school to have my precious child for six hours a day, shouldn&#39;t they <br/>
allow me and my son a few hours together at home in the evening?  And <br/>
then there was the FCAT.  The first 3/4 of the schoolyear were spent <br/>
preparing for it.  They actually got FCAT homework.  I felt that it <br/>
was an enormous waste of time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
But the proverbial last straw was the fifth grade teacher.  My son <br/>
always hated writing essays and would usually freeze up and write <br/>
little or nothing.  Mrs. C was infuriated by this.  She accused Nat <br/>
of being lazy and stubborn.  And if he questioned something she said <br/>
in class she felt threatened by him.  She told me that he needed to <br/>
be *knocked down a few pegs* and that he would *have to conform* <br/>
(while beating her fist on the desk)!  I was so upset that I told her <br/>
I might just start to homeschool and she responded that maybe I <br/>
should.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I did!  And it was the best thing I ever did!  Even school at <br/>
home was better than that.  We settled in with a classical ciriculuum <br/>
that I designed myself. And slowly dropped what we didn&#39;t like.  In <br/>
January my husband and I went to a David Albert talk in Orlando.  We <br/>
have been deschooling ever since.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to find this group.  I am on other groups which I read, <br/>
but am afraid to post on because they are so large.  I guess I have <br/>
stage fright.  I am looking forward to the give and take.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace to all and thanks for taking the time to read this.<br/>
<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree with you more!  I don&#39;t know how many times I have <br/>
said this.  My step-children live with us 24/7, and they attend <br/>
public school.  This drives me batty!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has become a positive for our family, although no one <br/>
really knows it but me as Pat doesn&#39;t know much about homeschooling <br/>
let a lone unschooling, is that I found unschooling.  I have been <br/>
unschooling my 10 year old son since January.  We schooled at home <br/>
before that and public schooled for a couple years before that.  Even <br/>
though we have public schooled children in addition to our unschooled <br/>
child it effects the entire way of family life.  You just tend to <br/>
look at things differently, thereby reacting differently.  It&#39;s a <br/>
wonderful thing!  Some day soon I hope to get Pat on the bandwagon as <br/>
well...<br/>

Too many people have this kind of experience with teachers.  What about<br/>
the kids whose parents side with a lunatic teacher and make the poor kids<br/>
life at home as miserable as it is in school.  That&#39;s just heartbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you got him away from her.  <br/>
