<div id="ygrps-yiv-639106233">Ok so my mom is the type that thinks children need limits and I even fall back on my old ways at times and have to snap myself out of it :) <br/>
   <br/>
  When we were talking about the conference one of the things she brought up was that sometimes people have to do things they dont like......suggesting that there would be sometimes I have to make them study things because they needed to . <br/>
   <br/>
  What i replied with ........ the only time I can think of that adults do something they dont like and honestly have no choice is if a crime is being commited against them.  You dont have to do things you dont like. Sometimes you choose to do things you dont like because there is benefit in it for you but there is nothing stopping you from choosing to quit . Why should this be different for children? <br/>
   <br/>
  If someone has a better answer or more to add Id love to read it and if you dont mind forward it to her. <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear this argument alot and have been known to spout off about it <br/>
myself.  I think it&#39;s better when you aim at specifics rather than <br/>
just generals.  Put it back on her.  Ask her to give you a short <br/>
list of things she feels she &quot;needs&quot; to do that she doesn&#39;t feel she <br/>
has a choice to do or not do.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
<br/>
Dishes - I&#39;ve heard moms say they hate doing dishes but since they <br/>
need to be done, someone has to do them.  Therefore they force the <br/>
kids to do the dishes who in turn hate dishwashing.  The mothers say <br/>
doing something the kids don&#39;t like is building character.  Um, <br/>
okay.  So they delegate the household chores they don&#39;t like and <br/>
then justify their reasons for doing so.  <br/>
<br/>
Do dishes really need to be washed?  Are there certain dishes that <br/>
they don&#39;t like to wash or is it all dishes?  Can they get a <br/>
dishwasher?  Can they switch to paper cups and plates for at least <br/>
one meal a day to cut down on dishes?  Can they learn to do a quick <br/>
wash when they are finished with a dish and set it to dry in a rack <br/>
rather than waiting until the entire sink is full?  Can they ask for <br/>
help and cut the job in half or thirds?  For example, I&#39;ll do the <br/>
glasses, someone else can do the plates, someone else the <br/>
silverware.  Can they make the chore more fun by turning on the <br/>
radio or having someone sit in the kitchen with them to keep them <br/>
company?<br/>
<br/>
Do you get the idea?  One thing that unschooling has taught me is <br/>
that there are a myriad number of ways at looking at something.  <br/>
Alot of what we feel is necessary are still really choices.  And <br/>
even if something is truly necessary but not necessarily liked, we <br/>
can still perhaps find a way to get through it.  <br/>
<br/>
And last, she feels that kids need to study some things that are <br/>
necessary?  What is an absolutely necessary thing to study?  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling groups like this one are great resources to learn a new <br/>
way of looking at life.  Thank goodness I found my way back!  <br/>

I *LOVE* this question! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sooo---tell me ONE thing I *have* to do.  &lt;G&gt; Tell me one thing my <br/>
child *has* to do.<br/>
<br/>
As far as studying to *prepare* for the possibility of needing to know, <br/>
how about the *probability* that she might break her hip one day. How&#39;s <br/>
she preparing for *that*? &lt;g&gt; My cousin Vito could break her finger. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Even better is for Mom to do the dishes happily as a part of <br/>
gift-giving to her family.<br/>
<br/>
If we can *model* that dish washing is a pleasure, our kids will get <br/>
that message, just as easily as they get the message that dish washing <br/>
is a chore to be avoided and put onto someone else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the smaller picture.<br/>
<br/>
In the big photo: so many adults are unhappy with the jobs they have <br/>
and whine constantly about having to go to work. What kind of message <br/>
is that sending? No one *wants* to work! What kind of craziness is <br/>
*that*?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, ideally we&#39;re modeling working at a job we love. But even if <br/>
it&#39;s not the dream job, modeling joy at having a job and pride in that <br/>
job is a real gift to our kids. We can CHOOSE to do that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, very true!  In our household, my husband and I complement one <br/>
another very well.  It seems the things he doesn&#39;t like are the <br/>
things I don&#39;t mind and vice versa.  I guess this provides good <br/>
modeling for the children because things are done in a pleasant <br/>
manner rather than accompanied with griping.  In traditional <br/>
homeschool circles, I usually avoid the conversations about kids and <br/>
chores because people just don&#39;t seem to understand that we have no <br/>
need for a system, maybe I should put that word in quotes, in our <br/>
house.  We have tried having chore charts in the past but they <br/>
fizzle out after just a few days.  And the concept that really seems <br/>
to boggle people&#39;s minds is that my children truly don&#39;t mind doing <br/>
stuff around the house.  I believe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t make it a <br/>
hard and fast rule.  I&#39;ll ask them if they&#39;d like to help me and <br/>
they can honestly tell me no without worrying about any <br/>
consequences. Most of the time they are happy to help and there are <br/>
times when they just do something they see needs doing.  I love how <br/>
they find the joy in some of these tasks.  They can have so much fun <br/>
cleaning windows, vacuuming and dusting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198714248">***sometimes people have to do things they dont like......suggesting <br/>
that there would be sometimes I have to make them study things <br/>
because they needed to . ****<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take, for example, something like math facts.  This is <br/>
something traditionally minded people claim is essential.  &quot;All kids <br/>
must learn their math facts.&quot;  I majored in Mathematics in college.  <br/>
I taught Algebra in the public school system (before becoming totally <br/>
fed up with the lack of respect displayed toward kids).  I don&#39;t know <br/>
my math facts.  I&#39;ve found that the ability to immediately spout the <br/>
answer to 7x8 is not only unneccessary in life, but also unnecesary <br/>
in math.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you can find a plethora of examples of people like me who <br/>
can function quite well without knowing things that some would <br/>
claim &quot;must&quot; be known.<br/>
<br/>
I find it somewhat amusing that my 10yo understands a concept so many <br/>
adults have trouble wrapping their minds around.  If posed with the <br/>
question, &quot;What happens when you grow up and find you haven&#39;t learned <br/>
something you needed to learn?&quot; his response is &quot;I&#39;ll learn it <br/>
then.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153019299">Rather than answer her directly, answer her question with a question:<br/>
what things is she referring to? Make her get specific because,<br/>
generally, you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do much of anything really - there are<br/>
choices that most people make most of the time and often don&#39;t realize<br/>
it&#39;s a choice but that doesn&#39;t change that they are indeed choices.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t even have to eat BUT the consequences are not very nice. You<br/>
don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; work, wash dishes, do laundry, cook dinner, clean<br/>
bathrooms, ....BUT the consequences might not be what you want, so you<br/>
do them. For instance, you don&#39;t have to wash dishes - you can eat out<br/>
every meal (or eat only pre made ready to eat foods - for instance,<br/>
granola bars for breakfast); you can use paper/plastic plates, bowls,<br/>
cups, utensils; you can get new dishes every few weeks (whenever you run<br/>
out); you could even just leave the dishes in the sink for weeks on end;<br/>
get a dishwasher (either the mechanical kind or the paid housekeeper<br/>
kind) and probably other options  as well BUT there&#39;s a consequence (or<br/>
two) to the choices - it costs money, uses resources (paper/plastic non<br/>
recyclables), perhaps bugs, smell, mess, etc. You might not LIKE doing<br/>
the dishes BUT it is a CHOICE to do it (and there are ways to make it<br/>
less bothersome - I use a dish soap with orange oil because it&#39;s so<br/>
refreshing and uplifting, I&#39;ll often light a small candle on the<br/>
windowsill by the sink, and maybe put on some music nearby; DH and I<br/>
trade back rubs too - if I&#39;m doing the dishes, he stops by and rubs my<br/>
back while I work and vice versa; sometimes DS will hang out nearby and<br/>
we&#39;ll chat - I have fond memories of long conversations with my mom<br/>
while she washed and I dried).<br/>
<br/>
The other side of that is that people DO lots of things they don&#39;t like<br/>
*in order to* reach a goal of their own CHOOSING. I know several<br/>
triathletes here at work and one of them chose to learn how to swim in<br/>
order to compete - imagine going back in your early 30s to learn how to<br/>
swim after a lifetime of not swimming - it wasn&#39;t necessarily easy or<br/>
something he would have otherwise chosen BUT he had a goal - compete in<br/>
a triathlon just to do it (he had no plans of getting close to winning,<br/>
he just wanted to do it for himself). I&#39;m not all that tickled about<br/>
sticking my fingers to draw blood daily BUT my goal of being as healthy<br/>
as possible as long as possible, with fewest complications and<br/>
medications means that, as a diabetic, I stick my finger and watch my<br/>
food intake and get 20-30 minutes of cardio exercise (exercise bike or<br/>
treadmill) at least 5 of 7 days per week. No one is making me do that<br/>
(and I&#39;ve even disagreed with my endocrinologist about taking certain<br/>
meds) BUT I *choose* to do what it takes to avoid diabetic complications<br/>
(loss of sight, kidneys, nerve function in extremities which usually<br/>
leads to amputations, heart attack, stroke, etc).<br/>
