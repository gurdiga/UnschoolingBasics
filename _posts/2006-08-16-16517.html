<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671740270">&quot;Actually I wanted to pass on that I just downloaded GoogleEarth and<br/>
it is amazing!!!!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, we discovered Google Earth last year and it is a huge hit around<br/>
here! My wee man (Jalen 5y.o.) will sit and move the earth around<br/>
asking me a MILLION questions about places and people and flags and.....??<br/>
<br/>
The CIA factbook is a fun place to find out statistics and other<br/>
information on every country. We love traveling the earth from our<br/>
computer (for now). We have big plans for actually visiting many<br/>
places, but that will all happen in it&#39;s own time. Jared wants Japan<br/>
to be first on the list!<br/>
<br/>
Jared wanted to share a really cool link today. It&#39;s a video of<br/>
Kingdom Hearts characters singing the Hamster Dance. Totally hilarious<br/>
and it actually looks like they&#39;re singing it! If you have gamers,<br/>
show them this: <br/>

Thank you so much for sharing that link, Ren!  My little guy, Addison, <br/>
is a HUGE fan of the PS2 Kingdom Hearts...AND he likes to laugh.  The <br/>
sillier, the better.  :-)<br/>
