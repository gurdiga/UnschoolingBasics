<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132304886">Guess I was lucky - I was taught to enjoy math by teachers that loved<br/>
math. Two of my favorite math teachers in middle/high school were women<br/>
(pre-algebra and calculus). But then again that was back in the middle<br/>
ages and the whole &#39;space race&#39; and all - late 60s through the 70s (high<br/>
school class of &#39;79) - when there was still a huge focus on developing a<br/>
generation of math/science professionals and not so much emphasis on<br/>
standardized testing. We learned the &#39;shortcuts&#39; right along with the<br/>
textbook methods and the patterns and whys of things not just rote<br/>
stuff. We had the time to explore the ideas with the teacher rather than<br/>
plow through in time for a test.<br/>
<br/>
That attitude is really paying off because, by verbalizing my plan of<br/>
attack when dealing with numbers, DS is now using the same methods. Not<br/>
necessarily textbook, but quick and accurate. He told me that the other<br/>
day he added 3100+3050 in his head by first adding 3000+3000 then adding<br/>
100+50 then adding 6000+150 to get 6150. That&#39;s exactly how I would have<br/>
done it. Comes from lots of playing with numbers with him - a favorite<br/>
car game was for him to reel off strings of numbers for me to<br/>
add/subtract/multiply/divide and he&#39;d be pretty amazed that I&#39;d get the<br/>
answer pretty quickly after he got to the end of the string. On<br/>
occasion, when he asked, I&#39;d go back and show him how I handled it.<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;d make it a challenge match between me and DH to see who<br/>
could answer faster. And sometimes he&#39;d think up &quot;word problems&quot; for us<br/>
which usually devolved into silliness because we&#39;d ask him questions<br/>
about the things in the &quot;problem&quot; - If you are making 3 apple pies and<br/>
you&#39;ve got 15 apples, how many more apples do you need? Would have<br/>
questions like &quot;how big are the apples? How big is the pie pan? What<br/>
kind of apples are they? Which recipe are you using? Do any of the<br/>
apples have worms in them?...&quot; and it would go downhill from there :-)<br/>
