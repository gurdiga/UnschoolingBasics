<div id="ygrps-yiv-748900703">I&#39;m so GEEKED that this is being held in N. Carolina and that is only<br/>
a little over 8 hours from Pcola....I AM SOOOOO THERE!!! WOOT!<br/>
<br/>
:-)  BTW...the link for the YMCA doesn&#39;t work on the Live and Learn<br/>
Site but I googled it....wow, totally beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot hardly stand that we have a year but that is alright. <br/>
Sticking to this site and reading positive articles about unschooling<br/>
is helping me to stay focused although, I&#39;ve had a couple of ugly<br/>
thoughts creep into my mind but thanks to some wise advice, I&#39;m<br/>
speaking positively in order to rid them.  <br/>
