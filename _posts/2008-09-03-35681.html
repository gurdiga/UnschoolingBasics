<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704124406">I feel like as the day goes on the no&#39;s increase.  For example this <br/>
morning we had a few errands to run. mostly for the kids. My older <br/>
boys (5 and 6) wanted to find a specific lego set.  We looked in 3 <br/>
stores.  They couldnt find it, we also went to get some shoes for my <br/>
youngest (3) and went to the library.  Back home.  My kids never seem <br/>
to get tired but by the time lunch was over I am ready for a quick <br/>
nap.  I said yes as much as ever today but now I am tired.  But I dont <br/>
know how to get them to see boundaries without finally flipping out.  <br/>
I spend alot of time setting up a situation where I might be able to <br/>
sneak away for a nap but honestly I end up usually yelling at atleast <br/>
one of them.  I need a nap, i have to work tonight.  I am cranky and <br/>
annoyed at myself and them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751762274">Your kids are really young...do you usually get a nap?  Mine are 12,<br/>
10, and 4 and naps are kind of rare because of the 4 yr old.  I can<br/>
only nap when she does.  Which is usually about 4pm...I want my nap<br/>
1-3ish.  Before the 4 yr old got here (she&#39;s adopted) I was able to<br/>
nap more because the older two don&#39;t need to be watched all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394021657">No i dont usually get one.  but i need one.  I have the three I <br/>
mentioned and a 4 year old daughter. my youngest two are adopted as <br/>
well.  Last year.  I try to get the younger 2 to lie down with me or <br/>
without me so i can rest a few minutes but they are so wound up they <br/>
wont.  If they do they fall asleap and they know that so they wont <br/>
stop.  I see big behavioral differences in my daughter especially if <br/>
she is tired.  not everyday but really busy days.  She gets very <br/>
argumentative and difficult to get along with... kind of like me! <br/>
I feel like for half the day I am a good mother.  Then the other half I <br/>
absolutely stink at it.</div>
