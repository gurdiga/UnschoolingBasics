What was it like living at the commune? We have toyed with the idea on and off for a while. Basically as of next week we will have our own little village completed. My dad is moving in with us so it will be me, DH, both kids, brother in law (DH&#39;s brother) and my father. <br/>

Both my kids like to watch tv and play video games. <br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s really social, and always has been, even back before we had a <br/>
tv. He needed almost constant interaction when he was little, for <br/>
sure, and we were living in the woods in a commune. Can&#39;t blame the <br/>
tv on that one ;)<br/>
<br/>
Mo, otoh, is much more of an introvert. She&#39;s had unlimited movies <br/>
from toddlerhood and unlimited satellite tv for a couple years, now, <br/>
plus video games. She&#39;s definately a very busy person - always <br/>
building or creating something, it seems. The tv is often on at the <br/>
same time if she&#39;s inside, but she doesn&#39;t seem distracted by it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that child - maybe he goes to school and is worn out <br/>
after a long day? I&#39;m being facetious, but only slightly. I can <br/>
think of plenty of reasons for a school kid to be so utterly wiped <br/>
out as to doze off if not actively kept awake - or just so utterly <br/>
bored, for that matter. That doesn&#39;t really apply to my family.<br/>
