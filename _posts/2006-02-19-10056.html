<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103952274">When money doesn&#39;t seem to be enough to cover a child&#39;s interests,<br/>
that&#39;s your opportunity to be CREATIVE!!!<br/>
Finding a teen or parent that is willing to share their passion is a<br/>
great way, but there is also barter.<br/>
Most towns have some kind of parks and recreation program or community<br/>
centers that offer very low cost classes. We&#39;ve done gymnastics,<br/>
ballet, karate, art and music at community centers for next to nothing<br/>
cost wise! They were really great classes too.<br/>
<br/>
Look around, ask other homeschooling parents and I bet you&#39;ll find<br/>
some alternatives.  Sometimes classes aren&#39;t the best way to pursue an<br/>
interest anyway, so try to find other ways to fulfill the need if your<br/>
child enjoys that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of gymnastics, a tumbling mat and a mini-trampoline<br/>
would suffice? Totally depends of course, but there&#39;s a lot we can do<br/>
creatively and inexpensively.<br/>
Being the thrift hound that I am, I&#39;d be checking out garage sales and<br/>
thrift stores or your local freecycle group for the trampoline or<br/>
tumbling mat and building my own balance beam.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely. Check with local homeschooling groups to find mentors. 4-H <br/>
is another great way to find free mentoring for lots of expensive <br/>
activities--horse riding, etc. I ran a Rock Hounds club that included <br/>
rock climbing, knot tying, geology, geography, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Think outside of the box--that&#39;s the single most useful bit of advice <br/>
any one can take.<br/>
<br/>
Help your child *learn*--that&#39;s a whole different mentality than &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still thinking in a &quot;teach&quot; mindset, you&#39;ll be looking for <br/>
expensive classes and specialized lessons. But, thankfully, that&#39;s not <br/>
the only way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Look for books, videos, community mentors, internships--expand your <br/>
child&#39;s world in the direction of his/ her interests and lose the boxed <br/>
notion of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is interested in something, help them find ways to *do* that <br/>
thing--in small ways, different ways, volunteer ways, shadowing ways, <br/>
email interview/ conversation ways. Those are the kinds of things that <br/>
turn into internships, contacts, jobs, careers, transcripts, etc.<br/>
