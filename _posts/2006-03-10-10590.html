<div id="ygrps-yiv-336953786">--When we were kids we never wore seatbelts, if our cars even had them, we rode in the <br/>
back of trucks, and sat on Dads lap and helped him drive.  None of these things are ok for <br/>
me.  I have mentioned once we were in a car accident when my oldest daughter was 3, the <br/>
only thing that saved her-- her car seat had just been installed properly by someone from <br/>
the state(two days before).  I am very nerotic about seat belts and car seats/booster seats.  <br/>
If we don&#39;t have the right equiptment to ride safe, we don&#39;t go.  But having said that, I have <br/>
never had to force the kids.  It has always just been done. In fact THEY remind ME <br/>
sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
the reason i chimed in our kids Van Surf in our drive way also-no other cars and we go <br/>
slow. melanie in Vt- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;crissyhall&quot; &lt;crissyhall@...&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006531862">Funny, I grew up not wearing seatbelts  and as soon as I started driving<br/>
myself... I started wearing them... every time.  I can&#39;t tell you how many<br/>
times the seatbelt has kept me from injury... it&#39;s kept me from flying<br/>
through my windshield in one really bad accident.  I figured, I&#39;ll take the<br/>
small inconvenience of wearing the seat belt (I feel unsafe if I don&#39;t wear<br/>
one now) than to have my face and body smeared all over the pavement.... or<br/>
my body being mangled with the engine.  As much as death and gore intrigues<br/>
me... I&#39;m not interested in it for myself before my time.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think the fact that I (we) have no health insurance keeps me more<br/>
aware of safety for myself and my family, too.<br/>
