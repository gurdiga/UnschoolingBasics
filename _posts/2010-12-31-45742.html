<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209234556">The Tuesday before Christmas my step father had a stroke.  I live two<br/>
hours away from the town he lived in, so my partner and I drove over<br/>
that evening to visit him in the hospital and to see how we could<br/>
help.  Luckily Draven (our 10 y/o son) had already arranged to spend<br/>
the night with a friend and we contacted that family and asked if they<br/>
would let him stay for a few days, we also, at that time let Draven<br/>
know what was going on.  On Christmas eve my partner and I drove back<br/>
to our home town to pick up Draven, take care of the cats at our<br/>
house, and pack enough stuff for Draven and I to stay full time at my<br/>
mothers house for at least a month.  For some strange reason, about a<br/>
week before Christmas, we decided to go ahead and &quot;do Christmas&quot; and<br/>
allowed Draven to open all of his gifts from us.  This of course ended<br/>
up being a huge blessing because his Christmas wasn&#39;t really<br/>
overshadowed by this family emergency.<br/>
<br/>
At this point the decision has been made by everyone that we are all<br/>
going to move in with my mother and step father for at least 6 months.<br/>
 At least until tax time, my partner is going to continue spending a<br/>
few days a week in our home town where she has a part time job.  We&#39;re<br/>
going to give up our apartment within the next 2 weeks and move<br/>
everything to this town, splitting it between my mothers house and a<br/>
storage unit.<br/>
<br/>
We have lived in this town before (Draven and I spent 5 years here,<br/>
and my partner spent about a year here when we first got together).<br/>
Draven still has a few friends, both from when he was in school, and<br/>
from our years spent in the homeschool groups here.  He only has 2<br/>
objections to moving here.  One is that he&#39;s leaving all of his<br/>
friends behind, and we did explain that since my partners family is in<br/>
that town, we will still be going there relatively often.  His other<br/>
problem is the same problem all of us kind of have, which is that<br/>
we&#39;ll be living with my mother and step father, and they don&#39;t<br/>
completely agree with our parenting practices.  I&#39;ve had long talks<br/>
with my mother concerning the way we are raising and educating Draven,<br/>
and she has said &quot;It&#39;s your kid, none of my buisness, except that I<br/>
will try to keep your practices in mind when I am asking him for help<br/>
or just communicating with him&quot;  I&#39;m not too worried about her.  My<br/>
step father however is a very opinionated man, and he&#39;s not in the<br/>
mental state right now for me to have this conversation with him, so<br/>
we&#39;re just going to have to kind of deal with that as he gets better.<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;ve covered the conversational base so to speak with both Draven<br/>
and my mother.  We&#39;ve also already made time for Draven to spend the<br/>
night with some old friends, as well as taken one on one time with him<br/>
to let him spend some Christmas money.  Right now (until my youngest<br/>
sister moves out in a week or so) Draven, my partner and I are all<br/>
sharing one bedroom, so in the evenings we have plenty of &quot;family<br/>
time.&quot;  My step father also had his own apartment (he is recently<br/>
divorced from my mother), so while we were moving things out of his<br/>
apartment we made sure Draven was able to spend time with some local<br/>
friends so he could still be a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Draven is very excited that we have cable TV and high speed wireless<br/>
internet here, so that&#39;s been a huge plus for him (and all of us<br/>
really, because we didn&#39;t have those luxuries at home).  Another huge<br/>
plus is that we were struggling financially back home, and here our<br/>
bills will be about 1/4 of what they were there.<br/>
<br/>
The family politics (for lack of a better term) are very difficult<br/>
right now.  My step father has 2 biological children.  The youngest<br/>
who will be 21 in a month (the one currently living with my mom) said<br/>
from day one she refused to help with his care or any of this.  Her<br/>
attitude is basically that she didn&#39;t ask to have &quot;old parents&quot; and<br/>
this isn&#39;t her problem.  His oldest bio child, who is 25, lives an<br/>
hour away and works 2 full time jobs to support herself.  She is<br/>
willing to help, but is not willing to give up her small 1 bedroom<br/>
apartment and therefore he can&#39;t move in with her because she won&#39;t be<br/>
available for 24 hour care.  That&#39;s why our mother said she would let<br/>
him move in here and provide for his care, at which point my partner<br/>
brought up the idea of us moving in to help so that my mother wasn&#39;t<br/>
trying to do everything alone.<br/>
<br/>
So far I think I&#39;m handling this pretty well when it comes to keeping<br/>
Draven as included as possible during this process, but I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if anyone has been in this situation (or something similar) and can<br/>
point out things that we may be missing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any and all advice as well as any prayers that can be<br/>
passed our way while we all deal with this situation.<br/>

you offer some more concrete suggestions, like every Wednesday we will go to<br/>
X town. Then you can rotate things to do that are important to him. Does he<br/>
have access to his friends via internet, Xbox live or Skype?<br/>

someone convalescing.<br/>
<br/>
Since your step father is needing care it might be most helpful to empower<br/>
Draven. And to not have him alone in situations that may be difficult and<br/>
painful to navigate by himself.<br/>

&gt; *** A little over a year ago my step father was diagnosed with cancer. He<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lived for about 3 months after that. I am not sure how healthy your<br/>
stepfather is or how close he and Draven are. I did a lot of preparing my<br/>
kids. We knew his time was limited and tried to spend as much time as we<br/>
could with him before he was unwilling to have visitors. He was very private<br/>
towards the end. We talked a lot about life and death. We made videos and<br/>
took lots of pictures. We didn&#39;t live with them however.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about how I would handle that. Personally I would keep<br/>
assessing if it is the right option depending on how things go. If things<br/>
were to uncomfortable for my children I would consider other options. For<br/>
now it seems like everyone is on board, I would just keep an open mind and a<br/>
close eye on Draven and his reactions to everything.<br/>
<br/>
best wishes in this trying scenario.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565158017">First off, hugs to all - this is a really stressful time. Next, although<br/>
you may already know about it and have things in hand, be sure to be in<br/>
contact with the &quot;discharge coordinator&quot; at the hospital to arrange for<br/>
home care and respite care. All of you need some way of having a break,<br/>
not just rotating between you and your mom to care for a recovering<br/>
stroke patient. You&#39;ll all need some assistance in learning to do<br/>
whatever needs doing and a &#39;lifeline&#39; for providing assistance/advice<br/>
for new situations that may arise. If your stepfather was prickly to<br/>
begin with, he&#39;s liable to be even touchier now because he won&#39;t be able<br/>
to do all that he might once have done (physically AND mentally).<br/>
Everyone in the situation needs a way to keep themselves physically and<br/>
emotionally safe - it can be very easy to get sucked into a maelstrom of<br/>
turbulence. Having respite care so that the family can go out to dinner,<br/>
for example, is important.<br/>
