<div id="ygrps-yiv-995063984">I tried asking this on a different venue a while ago.  I&#39;m hoping <br/>
that someone here will be able to relate.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for <br/>
about eight months now.  Before that it was school-at-home, before <br/>
that it was public charter school, and before that it was school-at-<br/>
home.  Long story, but that&#39;s the low down.  Plus, you should also <br/>
know that we are a combined family of seven children, and my son, age <br/>
10, is our only un/homeschooled child.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you been through &quot;phases&quot; of boredom?  He went through it <br/>
a while ago.  It wasn&#39;t too long or too intense.  Currently he&#39;s kind <br/>
of freaking me out.  He is SO bored.  He sometimes walks around in <br/>
circles in the back yard because he can&#39;t think of anything to do.  <br/>
He spends a lot of time walking around sighing, etc.  When I ask him <br/>
what&#39;s up he says he&#39;s bored.  When I ask him what he wants to do he <br/>
says he doesn&#39;t know.  If I offer suggestions of things he might like <br/>
to do he&#39;s not interested.<br/>
<br/>
What is the appropriate response to this dilemma?  Have any of you <br/>
been through this?  The poor kid just doesn&#39;t really seem too <br/>
interested in anything.  I&#39;m looking forward to the time when the <br/>
other kids that are going back to school get there.  I know it may <br/>
sound mean to some, but that&#39;s when we can truely be ourselves and <br/>
spend our days the way we&#39;d like to without interference.  It really <br/>
is difficult raising one unschooled child, with so many others in <br/>
public school.  Can anyone relate to this?<br/>
<br/>
Any input on this subject would be greatly appreciated.  I&#39;ve really <br/>
been enjoying reading the discussions that have been going on <br/>
lately...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t relate in terms of my own experience, but from reading your post,<br/>
since you are saying spending your days as you like with your unschooled son<br/>
seems interfered by with your other schooled kids, I&#39;m wondering if the<br/>
&quot;boredom&quot; is an expression of frustration on your unschooled son&#39;s part that<br/>
there are things he wants to do that he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; right now?  I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
with my five year old niece, to whom most things at home are &quot;can&#39;t&quot; that<br/>
she is &quot;bored&quot; a lot and it seems to me to be related to her ability to<br/>
follow her natural inclinations being stuffed.  If you think this is the<br/>
case with your son, I wonder if talking to him about what he&#39;d do if the<br/>
other kids were back at school would help.  Maybe you could work with him to<br/>
figure out ways to do some of those things now, although not as<br/>
spontaneously?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a difficult situation.  Wish I had more to offer you...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418161293">Tina,<br/>
I do relate.  I decided to homeschool last year (against my ex&#39;s wishes)..my 8yo is homeschooled (mostly unschooled) and my 11yo goes to public school.  I have tried to entice him to homeschool, but he says ps is what he&#39;s used to, plus he knows his dad wouldn&#39;t be supportive.  It has made going to conference interesting because his first day of middle school is AUG 26, but we have agreed to wait until THURS afternoon to leave for MASS and he has agreed to miss FRIDAY of school.  I do get tired though of trying to juggle around his school schedule or feeling guilty if Eric and I do something while he&#39;s at school I think he would also enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
On the boredom note...Eric was having a similar &quot;I don&#39;t know what I want to do&quot; issue...so we decided that we will sit down once a week and plan out some things for the following week based on his current interests, so that when he doesn&#39;t know what to do we can refer back for ideas and we will have materials on hand.  He said the thing he didn&#39;t like about homeschooling was having to think of what to do all the time.  Also just having materials located where he can get them for whatever he wants to do has helped.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179396285">I really like this! No matter how energetic and responsive and <br/>
imaginative we want to be as parents, sometimes our enthusiasm flags, <br/>
and we may not do as much strewing (or other unschooling techniques) as <br/>
we should.<br/>
<br/>
I think its great when you start to hear &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; from a kid to put <br/>
the ball in their court, and say, &quot;I keep hearing you say that you are <br/>
bored this week. Let&#39;s make sure you aren&#39;t bored next week too by <br/>
sitting down now and planning one cool thing to do each day.&quot; And then <br/>
stick to the plan even if that &quot;one cool thing&quot; means getting in the car <br/>
and driving a long way, or represents a similar expenditure of effort on <br/>
the part of the parent. Or even if it means going to the zoo or aquarium <br/>
every day for a while until the child has gotten their fill, even if it <br/>
is boring for the parent after the second day.<br/>
<br/>
It puts kids in charge of actively pursuing their interests (love that) <br/>
and takes some of the guilt away from the parent for feeling like <br/>
they&#39;re not doing enough or being creative enough, while making sure <br/>
that it&#39;s not the parent calling all the shots. And puts an end to the <br/>
boredom. The kid might forever remember fondly &quot;that week we went to the <br/>
zoo 5 times.&quot; It also just might be inspirational to the parent who <br/>
might feel somewhat refreshed by forcing themselves to step outside the <br/>
regular routine.<br/>
<br/>
Magic!<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing that FIRST he needs to heal. I&#39;d let him rest and sleep and  get <br/>
to know himself more.<br/>
 <br/>
At the same time, I would plan things to do almost every day. <br/>
 <br/>
Monday: beach<br/>
Tuesday: art museum<br/>
Wednesday: play with clay<br/>
Thursday: picnic at the park<br/>
Friday: Japanese restaurant and going to the landscaping store to look at  <br/>
Japanese gardens<br/>
 <br/>
These are things for YOU to do, not him. Invite him, for sure. But plan on  <br/>
being interested and doing interesting things yourSELF! Give him time. He&#39;ll  <br/>
join you before too long. And car time is talk time! I love driving with my  <br/>
boys.<br/>

Oh how I would LOVE to go pick blueberries with you.  Gee, guess <br/>
what?  We can&#39;t!  Everyday this week is scheduled in preparation for <br/>
the graduation party.  I am putting on everything myself.  So, Monday <br/>
is last minute shopping and errand running with an eye appointment <br/>
thrown in the middle.  Tuesday is purchasing produce and PS <br/>
registration.  Wednesday is cleaning with a little help from a <br/>
friend, and Thursday and Friday are cooking, baking and cake <br/>
decorating.  WHEW!  Just per chance I can see a break anywhere, when <br/>
do you plan to go and where is it?  <br/>
<br/>
Did you get my email about when I told Adrian about your son?  His <br/>
reaction was so refreshing for me.  I have some old copies of some <br/>
unschooling magazines, but I don&#39;t remember their names off hand.  <br/>
They have been great reading for me.  I&#39;ve been thinking about a <br/>
subscription to Live and Learn.  Maybe it&#39;s time...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>
