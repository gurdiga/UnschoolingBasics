<div id="ygrps-yiv-77790417">&quot; Anyhow my children  Bethy age 8and half  and Jacob 7<br/>
want to share a room and turn the other room into a  playroom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is learning to listen to your heart, to your<br/>
children&#39;s hearts and IGNORING society.:)<br/>
<br/>
Your children have come up with a creative solution that sounds<br/>
wonderful. Go for it!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds very similar to the proposal I made to Sierra and Jalen, who<br/>
sleep together in my room anyway. We thought it would be cool to put a<br/>
bunk bed in her room, with all the books and stuffed animals and put<br/>
all the toys in his room (when we build it...right now they&#39;re sharing<br/>
by default) for a play area.<br/>
The bunk bed may not get used for some time, as they like sleeping<br/>
with us, but it would be great for company AND if they ever choose to<br/>
sleep somewhere away from me.:)<br/>
