A Conversation with John Holt (1980)<br/>
Interviewer: Marlene Bumgarner<br/>
<br/>
In 1980, Marlene Bumgarner, a homeschooling parent, hosted author John Holt in her <br/>
home while he was in California for a lecture tour. While he played in the garden with her <br/>
two children, John and Dona Ana, she interviewed him for the bimonthly magazine <br/>
Mothering.<br/>
<br/>
What is your philosophy of learning?<br/>
Basically that the human animal is a learning animal; we like to learn; we need to learn; we <br/>
are good at it; we don&#39;t need to be shown how or made to do it. made to do it. What kills <br/>
the processes are the people interfering with it or trying to regulate it or control it.<br/>
<br/>
Why homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big question. The great advantage is intimacy, control of your time, flexibility of <br/>
schedule, and the ability to respond to the needs of the child, and to the inclinations. If <br/>
the child is feeling kind of tired or out of sorts, or a little bit sick, or kind of droopy in <br/>
spirits, okay, we take it easy, and things go along very calmly and easily. When the child is <br/>
full of energy and rambunctious, then we tackle big projects, we try tough stuff, we look at <br/>
hard books. And I think schools could do much more than they do in this kind of <br/>
flexibility, but in fact they don&#39;t. I want to make it clear that I don&#39;t see homeschooling as <br/>
some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for <br/>
the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best <br/>
base no matter how good the schools were. The proper relationship of the schools to <br/>
home is the relationship of the library to home, or the skating rink to home. It is a <br/>
supplementary resource.<br/>
<br/>
But the school is a kind of artificial institution, and the home is a very natural one. There <br/>
are lots of societies without schools, but never any without homes. Home is the center of <br/>
the circle from which you move out in all directions, so there is no conceivable <br/>
improvement in schools that would change my mind about that.<br/>
<br/>
What does one do at a homeschool?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what Growing Without Schooling is about, of course. What one can do depends a lot <br/>
on what one&#39;s own life is. A lot of families have small businesses or subsistence farms or <br/>
crafts, or various kinds of activities that the parents are involved in, which the children are <br/>
also very involved in. The children just partake in the life of the adults wherever they are, <br/>
and then questions are answered as they come up. Other people may live at home and <br/>
work somewhere else; they may have a more conventional kind of existence.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in formal fixed curriculums, but it may very well be that when parents and <br/>
children start off, they&#39;re both a little nervous. They&#39;re both wondering what they should <br/>
be doing. If it makes people feel happier to have a little schedule, and to work with a <br/>
correspondence school for a year or so, kind of as a security blanket, there&#39;s nothing <br/>
wrong with that. It&#39;s a starting place.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is always to let the interests and the inclinations of the children determine what <br/>
happens and to give children access to as much of the parents&#39; lives and the world around <br/>
them as possible, given your own circumstances, so that children have the widest possible <br/>
range of things to look at and think about. See which things interest them most, and help <br/>
them to go down that particular road.<br/>
<br/>
How that&#39;s done depends very much on the family&#39;s circumstances and their interests, and <br/>
the particular interests of the children. Some kids are bookish, some children like to build <br/>
things, some are more mathematical or computerish, or artistic, or musical, or whatever. <br/>
The mix is never going to be exactly the same.<br/>
<br/>
Does homeschooling require that the parents spend a great deal of structured time with <br/>
their children in a formal learning situation?<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling doesn&#39;t require that parents spend a great deal of structured time. I think <br/>
as parents get into this they tend to spend less time. How much time they spend with their <br/>
kids depends a little on the circumstances in their own lives. Sometimes they spend a lot <br/>
of time in company together just because it&#39;s fun. Other times that&#39;s harder for them to <br/>
do. The children, though they may enjoy a lot of their parents&#39; company during the day, <br/>
don&#39;t need it once they get past 7 or 8.<br/>
<br/>
Is the parent without background in education or experience as a teacher at a <br/>
disadvantage in a homeschooling situation?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say they have a very great advantage. I wouldn&#39;t say that a person was disqualified <br/>
from doing it because they had had training in education, but I would have to say that <br/>
practically everything they taught you at that school of education is just plain wrong. You <br/>
have to unlearn it all. I never had any of that educational training. The most exclusive, <br/>
selective, demanding private schools in this country do not hire people who have <br/>
education degrees. If you look through their faculties - degrees in history, mathematics, <br/>
English, French, whatever - you will not see degrees in education. I think for the most <br/>
prestigious private schools you could almost set it down as a fact that to have a teacher&#39;s <br/>
certificate, to have had that kind of training, would disqualify you.<br/>
<br/>
Are parents talented or knowledgeable enough to teach physics or math?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well, the children don&#39;t have to learn physics or math from you. There are plenty of <br/>
people to learn from; there are plenty of books; there are plenty of extension courses. <br/>
GWS will have information on that. There are plenty of other people to answer your <br/>
questions. And the children don&#39;t have to get it all from Mom and Pop. There are people <br/>
who have only high schooling, or may not even have finished that, who are now teaching <br/>
their children at home and doing a very good job of it.<br/>
<br/>
What about the child&#39;s social life?<br/>
<br/>
As for friends Â– you&#39;re not going to lock your kids in the house. I think the socializing <br/>
aspects of school are ten times as likely to be harmful as helpful. The human virtues - <br/>
kindness, patience, generosity, etc. are learned by children in intimate relationships, <br/>
maybe groups of two or three. By and large, human beings tend to behave worse in large <br/>
groups, like you find in school. There they learn something quite different - popularity, <br/>
conformity, bullying, teasing, things like that. They can make friends after school hours, <br/>
during vacations, at the library, in church.<br/>
<br/>
What about the opportunity for youths to meet members of other backgrounds, other <br/>
socioeconomic classes?<br/>
<br/>
Most of the schools that I know anything about are tracked - there would be a college <br/>
track, and a business track, and a vocational track. Studies have shown over the years that <br/>
these tracks correlate perfectly with economic class. I think I know enough about most <br/>
high schools in this country to say there is very little mingling of people from different <br/>
backgrounds, different religious groups. The rich kids hang out with the rich kids, the <br/>
jocks hang out with the jocks, the pointy heads hang out with the pointy heads, the <br/>
greasers hang out with the greasers. Maybe there are some exceptions to that . . . but the <br/>
idea of school as a social melting pot where people of all kinds of backgrounds get <br/>
together - pure mythology, folks.<br/>
<br/>
What is your philosophy about teaching reading?<br/>
<br/>
I think the teaching of reading is mostly what prevents reading. Different children learn <br/>
different ways. I think reading aloud is fun, but I would never read aloud to a kid so that <br/>
the kid would learn to read. You read aloud because it&#39;s fun and companionable. You hold <br/>
a child, sitting next to you or on your lap, reading this story that you&#39;re having fun with, <br/>
and if it isn&#39;t a cozy, happy, warm, friendly, loving experience, then you shouldn&#39;t do it. It <br/>
isn&#39;t going to do any good.<br/>
<br/>
I think children are attracted toward the adult world. It&#39;s nice to have children&#39;s books, but <br/>
far too many of them have too much in the way of pictures. When children see books, as <br/>
they do in the family where the adults read, with pages and pages and pages of print, it <br/>
becomes pretty clear that if you&#39;re going to find out what&#39;s in those books, you&#39;re going to <br/>
have to read from that print. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to make reading interesting to <br/>
children in a family in which it isn&#39;t interesting to adults.<br/>
<br/>
What your philosophy about math?<br/>
<br/>
My approach to math is to say, What do we adults use numbers for? We use them to <br/>
measure things. And we measure things so that having measured them we can do things <br/>
with them, or make certain judgements about them. And so I say let children do with <br/>
numbers what we do with numbers. I&#39;m a great believer in many kinds of measuring <br/>
instruments - tapes (centimeter tape, inch tapes, rolls of tapes), rulers, scales, <br/>
thermometers, barometers, metronomes, electric metronomes with lights flashing on and <br/>
off that you can make go faster and slower, stopwatches, things for time.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is money. Kids are fascinated by money. We all say: &quot;We&#39;ll have to teach <br/>
them all this arithmetic so that some day they can deal with money.&quot; I think dealing with <br/>
money is inherently interesting to children. I say family finances ought to be out on the <br/>
table, charts on the wall: expenses, food, taxes, insurance, health care, how much this <br/>
costs, how much it cost last year. I think actually, like typing, double-entry bookkeeping <br/>
and basic accounting are fascinating skills, and if you&#39;re talking about basics, those are <br/>
basics.<br/>
<br/>
The fundamental idea of double-entry bookkeeping, the distinction between your income <br/>
and expenses and assets and liabilities is one of the really beautiful inventions of the <br/>
human mind. It&#39;s fabulous the way it works, and I think families should do their finances <br/>
as if they were a little teeny corporation with income and expenses and assets and <br/>
liabilities and depreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids might get to the point where they would want to be the family treasurer and <br/>
keep the family books and balance the checkbook. This is all really &quot;big adult stuff.&quot; Let <br/>
the child write out the checks that are paying the bills, instead of the harassed picture, you <br/>
know, of father with his tie untied, sitting at the desk and papers all over the place. Why? <br/>
This is inherently interesting, so let&#39;s at least make this part of our life - like every other <br/>
part - accessible to children. The best way to meet numbers is in real life, as everything <br/>
else. It&#39;s embedded in the context of reality, and what schooling does is to try to take <br/>
everything out of the context of reality. So everything appears like some little thing <br/>
floating around in space, and it&#39;s a terrible mistake. You know, there are numbers in <br/>
building; there are numbers in construction; there are numbers in business; there are <br/>
numbers in photography; there are numbers in music; there are fractions in cooking. So <br/>
wherever numbers are in real life, then let&#39;s go and meet them and work with them.<br/>
<br/>
What subject matter do you see as essential?<br/>
<br/>
None.*<br/>
<br/>
What about the parent who works outside of the home?<br/>
<br/>
One question which often comes up is &quot;How am I going to teach my kids six hours a day?&quot; <br/>
And I respond to that by saying, &quot;Who&#39;s teaching your kids six hours a day now?&quot; I was a <br/>
good student in supposedly the best schools and it was a rare day that I got five minutes <br/>
of teaching... that&#39;s five minutes of somebody&#39;s serious attention to my personal needs, <br/>
interests, concerns, difficulties, problems. Like most other kids in school, I learned that if <br/>
you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, for heaven&#39;s sake, keep your mouth shut. What <br/>
happens when children become ill, or have an injury, etc.? Home teachers come in for <br/>
three to five hours a week. It has been found that this is perfectly sufficient. These <br/>
children don&#39;t fall behind. No child needs, or should stand, six hours of teaching a day, <br/>
even if a parent were of a mind to give it. It would drive them up the wall!<br/>
<br/>
How are homeschoolers evaluated when they go to enroll at the university level?<br/>
<br/>
Just like anyone else. You know, there are these tests you can take... the College Boards, <br/>
the SAT, and so forth. Actually, homeschoolers do exceptionally well on these things. <br/>
They&#39;re more motivated to learn what areas will be covered, and prepare for them.<br/>
<br/>
Does it sometimes happen that a homeschooling student will express a desire to go to or <br/>
return to traditional schooling? How do parents handle this?<br/>
<br/>
Various ways. Sometimes parents have to decide (we&#39;re the grownups) that we don&#39;t want <br/>
them to go back to that school, and then stick with it. But other times, if the children want <br/>
to go, then that means they&#39;re immune to the manipulation the schools can do with the <br/>
children who don&#39;t have a choice about whether they have to be there or not. The school <br/>
loses some of its power when the children know they can quit if they want.<br/>

* Once when John Holt was speaking to a school audience, describing his views on the <br/>
their structured curriculum, a student asked him, &quot;But surely there must be something <br/>
important enough that everyone should learn it?&quot; He thought for a moment and replied, <br/>
&quot;To learn to say `I&#39;m sorry&#39;, `I don&#39;t know&#39;, and `I was wrong&#39;.&quot; [unpublished anecdote]</div>
