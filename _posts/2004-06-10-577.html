washing dishes, kids happily playing in the living room, I go in to<br/>

Why did he rip the screen door? Because he wanted the water to come<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m afraid this suggestion doesn&#39;t sit very well with me - not the dishes<br/>
part, the controlling part. In unschooling it&#39;s not really about &quot;having&quot;<br/>
the children do something that they may not wish to. Note that in this<br/>
instance &quot;having&quot; him come away to the kitchen would have meant interrupting<br/>
his happy playing. <br/>
What is supposed to happen next time it starts raining, and he starts<br/>
looking at the door with an anticipatory gleam? If it is anything contrived<br/>
it will probably be very obvious to this intelligent 5yo that he is being<br/>
diverted and mistrusted. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.5) also adores water, pouring water sometimes inappropriately, and<br/>
running out into the rain. Since she has more than once been overcome by her<br/>
need to pour water, the biggest development here has been her growing<br/>
ability to stop herself from doing it into the bed from a drinking bottle,<br/>
and go pour water in the bathroom instead. Initially asking her to go to the<br/>
bathroom, and if she couldn&#39;t do that at least to use the floor instead of<br/>
the bed, was my first suggestion to her. Showing her what a pain in the neck<br/>
it is to have to change all the sheets down to the mattress cover, and point<br/>
a loud hair dryer onto the mattress worked a lot better than getting angry.<br/>
Not getting angry has been my struggle in this situation, and I&#39;m happy to<br/>
say I have overcome my anger with just choosing to understand, and *express*<br/>
my understanding, that for some reason she sometimes just NEEDS to pour<br/>
water out.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is really proud of herself for gaining this much self-control -<br/>
stopping and running to the bathroom with her container. What would happen<br/>
if the bathroom door were locked? I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I think it might be better to somehow help him remember he can ask you for<br/>
assistance - such as if he finds a door latched when he wants to go outside.<br/>
One of us goes outside with Jayn whenever she wants to be in the rain. She<br/>
knows she can ask for me to open the screen door for her if it is closed. <br/>
<br/>
An alternative, since one of your concerns is baby proofing, could be a gate<br/>
that is low enough for him to climb over, but sturdy enough to keep in the<br/>
baby.<br/>
<br/>
As to the angry father, when Jayn has done something that might upset Daddy,<br/>
I try to tell him about it without her around, so he can get his grumps or<br/>
pissiness out with me, and then calm down before they interact. He is almost<br/>
never angry at her. If he is angry with me in her presence, it also upsets<br/>
her a lot. Resolving our adult differences of opinion is the biggest issue<br/>
in our home for me. Fortunately they are almost never disagreements to do<br/>
with parenting or unschooling - just his erroneous notions of who&#39;s boss. ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the advice Kay, I do like to have the kids come &quot;help&quot; me <br/>
with whatever I&#39;m working on, or sit with me in the computer room <br/>
when I&#39;m checking email, then I get to spend a little one-on-one <br/>
time with them and they likes that. But what do I do in the times <br/>
when I am putting the baby down for a nap and I need all the other <br/>
kids to sit quietly for just 5 minutes? Or when I ask Kenyon to come <br/>
wash dishes with me and he doesn&#39;t want to? <br/>
<br/>
Sure, I could strap the kid to my leg and then I would know exactly <br/>
what he was doing, but that would be horrible for both of us! I want <br/>
him to have his freedom and independence, but I am having a real <br/>
problem with the impulsive, destructive, disruptive behavior (there <br/>
are those words again!) I keep thinking there must be a way to allow <br/>
him to be who he is but at the same time communicate to him that it <br/>
isn&#39;t okay to destroy things that belong to other people, or that <br/>
it&#39;s really hard to get the baby down for a nap and you just can&#39;t <br/>
stand on the stairs and yell or you&#39;ll wake him up, etc. etc. I try <br/>
and try to &quot;express my comfort levels&quot; to him but he just doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to understand yet. I know he&#39;s only 5 years old and that as he <br/>
matures he will understand better. I have lived through this to some <br/>
degree already with my 8yo, so I know there is a light at the end of <br/>
the tunnel, but right now I am just feeling overwhelmed by the whole <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Joan, I really enjoyed your &quot;One small victory&quot; and I will remember <br/>
your story next time something gets broken :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone on this list who offers encouragement and advice, <br/>
It really helps to know that I am not alone and that you all are <br/>
willing to share your experiences and send me cyber hugs when I need <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amen! That&#39;s exactly my dilemma. He was playing happily with the <br/>
other kids when I left the room. But then he decided he wanted to go <br/>
out and the door was latched, so he just ripped the screen and went <br/>
through. I do not think he deliberately wrecked the screen, he just <br/>
wanted out.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to do with all my kids. If there&#39;s <br/>
something they want all they have to do is ask and I will do my best <br/>
to help them out. Sometimes I do have to say no because the thing <br/>
they ask for isn&#39;t an option right now (for instance, if we were <br/>
getting ready to leave the house we can&#39;t start watching a 2 hour <br/>
movie). But because we were controlling their every move for so <br/>
long, they are still in the mindset of, &quot;If I ask Mom she&#39;ll say no, <br/>
so I&#39;ll just go ahead and do it anyway and suffer the punishment <br/>
later.&quot; We&#39;re all still getting used to this &quot;YES&quot; thing &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

soaked carpet and the ripped screen, and when he talked to Kenyon <br/>
about what happened it was very obvious from his tone of voice that <br/>
he was angry, but there was no spanking and no yelling, so that&#39;s an <br/>
improvement :o)<br/>

wishy-washy and talk so much and get so wrapped up in talking about <br/>
things like &quot;comfort levels,&quot; that the kids stop listening and never <br/>

<br/>
Do you every simply say, &quot;I&#39;m going to put the baby down now and I want <br/>
you to be absolutely quiet for 5 minutes. How do you think you can do <br/>
that?&quot; Maybe he&#39;ll want to set the kitchen timer...or watch a video or <br/>
tv program.<br/>
<br/>
But - &quot;talking about comfort levels&quot; kind of sets off a little buzzer <br/>
in my head that says you may be talking too much and not being clear <br/>
about what you want from him.<br/>
<br/>
I had my first daughter with me, visiting relatives in Germany. There <br/>
was a basket of newspapers on the floor and she pulled some out and <br/>
started tearing them into strips - making a mess and destroying the <br/>
newspapers. I went over and picked her up and said, &quot;Hang on - somebody <br/>
might want to read these papers and they won&#39;t be able to do that if <br/>
they&#39;re torn up. Let&#39;s see if we can find something else to do.&quot; An <br/>
older woman came over and pulled out some of the newspapers and handed <br/>
them to my daughter. (I couldn&#39;t read the papers - they were in German <br/>
- but it was obviously mostly the advertising sections.)<br/>
<br/>
The basket with the &#39;not-to-be-torn&quot; papers sat right there on the <br/>
floor where it had been, while she happily shredded the papers she&#39;d <br/>
been given. THEN she was done - and there was a mess - and the same <br/>
older woman brought out a cloth grocery bag and knelt down and started <br/>
putting the pieces into the bag. I started to help and so did my <br/>
daughter. We cleaned up all the pieces we could, but there were lots of <br/>
little bitsy pieces, and the woman brought out a little hand vacuum. <br/>
She started to vacuum and then handed the vacuum to my daughter who <br/>
finished the job.<br/>
<br/>
The woman spoke no English, we didn&#39;t speak German. Did my daughter get <br/>
the message? Yep. It isn&#39;t THAT complicated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018995212">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use the phrase &quot;comfort levels&quot; with my kids, I got that <br/>
from Robyn&#39;s wonderful post:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It means that the parents get to own and express their own varying <br/>
comfort levels, without the rigid concept of setting limits&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to do is to get the kids to understand that most of <br/>
the time they are free to choose any activity they want to do, but <br/>
sometimes they just can&#39;t do what they want to do because a) it <br/>
interferes with someone else&#39;s activity, b) it&#39;s unsafe, c) it&#39;s <br/>
inconvenient for us to do that activity right this minute. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever I have to say &quot;no&quot; to an activity I always explain why we <br/>
can&#39;t do that particular thing, and then we work together to come up <br/>
with an alternative. And when I ask them to do something like be <br/>
quiet for a few minutes while I put the baby to bed, I make sure to <br/>
explain the situation and make suggestions for an appropriate <br/>
(quiet) activity. Usually my 8yo will stick to the quiet activity, <br/>
and I don&#39;t worry much about my 2yo as long as she&#39;s in a baby-<br/>
proofed space, but lately my 5yo just waits for the times when I am <br/>
preoccupied with something else and all heck breaks loose!<br/>
<br/>
As I said in another post, I am sure his &quot;heck&quot;-raising is just a <br/>
reaction to hearing &quot;no&quot; all the time, and now that I am <br/>
saying &quot;yes&quot; more the lying and sneaky behavior will fade away. I <br/>
just have to be p-a-t-i-e-n-t!<br/>
<br/>
~Sarah<br/>
<br/>
P. S. I loved your story about your daughter and the newspapers :o)<br/>
