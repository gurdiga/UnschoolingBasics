<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024214892">Once again, my almost 11 YO ds has told me how much global warming <br/>
bothers him.  He saw a segment, quite a while back I believe, on <br/>
20/20, about &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;.  He and my 13-YO ds have both <br/>
asked what they can do about global warming and seem very motivated <br/>
to want to do something. Not only that, but they want to know what <br/>
people in power are doing about it!   <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking and I wonder just how much the schools discuss it and <br/>
educate students about energy use, etc., and how involved the <br/>
students get.  It seems they could stay fairly busy studying for <br/>
tests, looking at college, etc., to try to save the planet.  As <br/>
unschoolers, our kids may have more time to devote to this if they <br/>
were so inclined.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that many adults don&#39;t really want to make sacrifices <br/>
or change their way of living to address what may be on the horizon <br/>
(hey, I&#39;m guilty too!).  I wonder if youth really understood what may <br/>
be at stake, and if so, if they would be more angry about how much <br/>
pollution, carbon, and waste is being generated.  I know when my boys <br/>
get to thinking about it, they get angry.  They keep asking <br/>
me &quot;what&#39;s being done about global warming?&quot;.  I honestly really <br/>
don&#39;t know what steps are being taken.  Does anybody have info on <br/>
what new laws have been passed recently that will really make a <br/>
change?  Specifically, is there anything new out there to help save <br/>
our rain forests?  I understand that there are many more coal-burning <br/>

we have a Sierra Club in our area, but don&#39;t know if they have a <br/>
youth group associated with them.  If there are already environmental <br/>
youth clubs out there that are striving for changes, I think it would <br/>
be more productive to look into joining them rather than reinventing <br/>
the wheel.  I know little on this subject, but my kids are so upset <br/>
about future predictions, I am trying to learn more about not only <br/>
what we can do as a family, but what steps government and countries <br/>
are taking as well.    <br/>
<br/>
I apologize if this thread has already been discussed repeatedly.  <br/>
I try not to go overboard on this topic with my boys and actually <br/>
rarely bring up the subject.  But they hear things and they are the <br/>
ones bringing it up and wanting to hear some good news about what is <br/>
being done.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918961120">this group might help: john robbins&#39; son ocean began this group called youth<br/>
for environmental sanity (YES):<br/>
<br/>
www.yesworld.com<br/>
<br/>
also, i know this isn&#39;t very unschool-y, but i heard somewhere that there<br/>
are teaching materials for schools to use to go along with &quot;an inconvenient<br/>
truth,&quot; to encourage kids to participate in creating social change.  i think<br/>
they are even free.  it might just be a good resource for other<br/>
organizations to contact and ideas of things to do.<br/>
<br/>
here are lots of books for kids or about kids helping and/or honoring the<br/>
environment.  &quot;celebrating the great mother&quot; is a great one.  &quot;earth book<br/>
for kids,&quot; &quot;save our planet,&quot; &quot;low-carbon diet,&quot; &quot;1001 little ways to save<br/>
our planet&quot; ...those are the ones that come to mind immediately, if you like<br/>
books.  :)<br/>
<br/>
and almost every environmental organization has a youth sub-group.  check<br/>
out the websites.<br/>
<br/>
as for changing laws, uh, yeah, it&#39;s happening, but not like your sons are<br/>
probably hoping.  as the bumper sticker says, &quot;to plant a tree, remove a<br/>
bush.&quot;  :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306997592">To truely understand global warming takes studying the earth and how the climate waxes and wanes. Temps have been heating up and cooling off as long as the earth is old. As far back the 1500s man has documented periods of increased heat and increased cooling. Back in the 1970&#39;s when we began being able to monitor the earth by satellite, they called for another ice age. It wasn&#39;t the first 20th century predicted ice age either. The vast majority of CO2 that&#39;s in the atmosphere comes from water vapor. Some of it comes from our exhaling. Manmade CO2 - even with all the SUVs, even with all the smoke stacks -- accounts for 4% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Food for thought at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your sons could study the climate patterns. They could go back as far as the 1500s and watch the patterns / cycles of temperatures. They could also study the cycles of the sun, which plays a part in how hot a summer can be. Sunspots are very interesting. <br/>
<br/>
There is so much information available to us regarding our climate, the earths cycles, solar cycles, (surprisingly) what goes in the atmosphere and much much more. To take a global warming warning without truely taking advantage of the information out there, would be cheating yourself of wonderful knowledge. Your sons would feel better knowing just how the climate works, history&#39;s recorded data and that there is so much more invovled with the climate than a movie tells you. Of course being green is a wonderful way to be. Sadly so many people don&#39;t put forth the effort. What is even more sad is too many of those that preach do not live the green way. There are so many things that your kids could learn about and do to set an example for others. As an astrophysics major I can tell you the information out there is beyond the quantity that you&#39;d need to put together a great lesson plan for discovery.  I wish them luck on their path. <br/>

have been getting periodic emails but I haven&#39;t checked out what kind  <br/>

rally:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since March 16, AlGore.com has grown by more than 250,000, to an  <br/>
&gt; amazing 555,392 members. However to ultimately succeed and convince  <br/>
&gt; our elected leaders to do what needs to be done, we have to grow  <br/>
&gt; much bigger still.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In addition to increasing the size of our movement, we want to be  <br/>
&gt; constantly alert to any opportunities where AlGore.com members can  <br/>
&gt; help build momentum to solve the climate crisis. Sometimes these  <br/>
&gt; actions will take place on AlGore.com - but there are dozens of  <br/>
&gt; other groups doing great work. One of those organizations is Step  <br/>
&gt; It Up 2007.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Step It Up 2007 has organized a National Day of Climate Action on  <br/>
&gt; April 14. They&#39;ve already scheduled more than 1,100 rallies in all  <br/>
&gt; fifty states - locations vary from the melting glacier on top of  <br/>
&gt; Mt. Rainier, to the levees in New Orleans, to underwater in an  <br/>
&gt; endangered coral reef off the coast of Florida, to your  <br/>
&gt; neighborhood park.<br/>

&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://stepitup2007.org/">http://stepitup2007.org/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One simple message will unite these rallies - &quot;Step it up,  <br/>
&gt; Congress! Enact immediate cuts in carbon emissions, and pledge an  <br/>
&gt; 80% reduction by 2050. No half measures, no easy compromises - the  <br/>
&gt; time has come to take the real actions that can stabilize our  <br/>
&gt; climate.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This reduction in CO2 may seem far-fetched, but it is within our  <br/>
&gt; grasp. Now we need our elected leaders to take the bold steps  <br/>
&gt; necessary to make it happen. Rallies in all 50 states are sure to  <br/>
&gt; further that goal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Participating in, or even hosting an event is easy. Take the first  <br/>

empowered to make changes, it really helps them not feel as anxious<br/>
about issues that might scare them. <br/>
<br/>
I have a close friend whose husband is a geologist that studies<br/>
permafrost. His work is closely related to global warming issues, as<br/>
the permafrost layer up North is considered a barometer of what is<br/>
happening globally:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_romanovsky.html">http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_romanovsky.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t read that to a child that already has fears, but it&#39;s<br/>
really interesting for those that are passionate about the topic.<br/>

not-let either of my kids watch tv or movies, but I do talk with them <br/>
both about content if I think there&#39;s something the younger will find <br/>
disturbing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102498824">Karen, my 10 year-old is in the same boat.  He is very stressed about <br/>
what he heard on that program.  Then my husband is an avid newspaper <br/>
reader and left the paper lying on the table with the headline about <br/>
European Team of Scientists predicting major consequences from Global <br/>
Warming.  I have mentioned to him before that he might want to think <br/>
about what&#39;s visible because he leaves the paper scattered all over <br/>
the table or the living room furniture.  It is pretty hard though to <br/>
protect kids from hearing doomsday predictions in regards to this.  <br/>
Although we certainly can reduce it.  I wish he never would have seen <br/>
that show to be honest.  I remember when I was a bit older than he <br/>
was, I was certain the world was going to be blown up from a nuclear <br/>
bomb and I would never actually &quot;grow up&quot;.  It stressed me out and I <br/>
remember worrying about that alot.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Beth-<br/>
