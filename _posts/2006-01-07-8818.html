<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629623132">Pam, that is so funny because my husband and I were just talking about <br/>
that, this evening, about how connected we feel to fellow unschoolers <br/>
even though we have never met so many of them.  We just spent two <br/>
WONDERFUL days with Mary Gold and her family.  We had SO much fun and <br/>
we felt like we had known them all our lives and we just met at the <br/>
conference.  There is something about knowing how the other person <br/>
feels about parenting, education, etc. that allows you to be relaxed <br/>
and free.  Maybe because we are all just a bunch of freaks!  LOL  I <br/>
had someone tell me yesterday that it was real gutsy to be an <br/>
unschooler.  She said &quot;I mean you have to totally buck the system!&quot;  <br/>
Duh!<br/>

system, usually. I feel excited and inspired.<br/>

I really liked how Ren described why she&#39;s able to take risks. That  <br/>
idea that we know there is going to be an end to this life, no matter  <br/>
how we choose to live it, so we might as well make it great in the  <br/>
meantime - that&#39;s exactly how I think, too. It sounds so morbid to  <br/>
say it - I seldom admit it aloud. Dwelling on it can be depressing, I  <br/>
suppose. But it also inspires me to want to make the most of each  <br/>
day, hour, minute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97929081">Heidi I was just about to write the same thing! Our two families melded together so wonderfully even though all of the kids were pretty shy at first. We all just knew to let it be and that we were coming from the same place. And we all had a really great time. My online friendships are WONDERFUL!<br/>

There&#39;s a song called Waltzing Along by my favorite group, James. There&#39;s a bit in there that reminds me of this sentiment when I hear it &quot;...all roads lead onto death row...&quot; You can view that as depressing or incredibly freeing. I feel free. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;These wounds are all self-imposed<br/>
Life&#39;s no disaster<br/>
All roads lead onto death row<br/>
Who knows what&#39;s after<br/>
May your mind be wide open<br/>
May your heart beat strong<br/>
May your mind&#39;s will be broken<br/>
By this heartfelt song&quot;<br/>
