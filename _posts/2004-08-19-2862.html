Well,  this must be my opening to ask about unschooling dogs! Yes, <br/>
it&#39;s silly,  but I&#39;m really wondering. It seems like most people I <br/>
know who have dogs  keep them in cages a lot of the time. And my <br/>
neighbor got a puppy and  worked hard to get him on a schedule, which <br/>
is so, ya know, un-AP!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
It&#39;s best not anthropomorphize the dogs. They are dogs, not children. They  <br/>
are den animals and prefer a &#39;covered&#39; place of their own---something  <br/>
&#39;den-like&#39;. Crates fit the bill.<br/>
 <br/>
Most people don&#39;t know much about dogs. They don&#39;t understand  <br/>
age-appropriate or instinctive or breed-specific behaviors. They  act as if they are <br/>
children. They aren&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
My dogs love their crates. Ryan will have his in the car (like a safety  belt <br/>
for dogs) and in the hotel room. You&#39;re welcome to witness it! &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ll <br/>
all nap in their crates with the doors open. It&#39;s a safe  place---and should <br/>
ALWAYS be treated as such. Flying on airplanes is *easy* when  the dog is <br/>
crate-trained. Often traumatic when not. Visiting friends and famiily  who aren&#39;t <br/>
dog-friendly is also easier.<br/>
 <br/>
Scheduling the puppy is not so much for the puppy&#39;s sake (other than to  <br/>
avoid human wrath), as for the human&#39;s. Potty training is easier when you know  <br/>
when he&#39;ll have to pee or poop----scoot him outside as soon as you can. He  <br/>
learns where to &#39;go&#39; and can get praised for it. Praise for going outside  is <br/>
perferable to pissing you off for going inside---and being on the receiving  end <br/>
of a &#39;white-carpet-rant&#39;. It&#39;s also using a natural tendency to not soil  where <br/>
he sleeps-----he won&#39;t soil his crate, and so will naturally &quot;hold it&quot;  until <br/>
he&#39;s let out of the crate and directly into the yard.<br/>
 <br/>
The easiest way to train a dog is to use his natural tendencies/instincts  to <br/>
our advantage. That&#39;s how we got herding dogs and hunting dogs----herding,  <br/>
pointing, retrieving are all &#39;parts&#39; of the natural hunting drive----watch  <br/>
wolves hunt in a pack; they used all this communication to work together.  <br/>
Terriers instinctively dig and hunt. Hounds use their noses or eyes to trail and  <br/>
hunt. Humans have just made the best of them by honing them to our needs.<br/>
 <br/>
For the most part, we&#39;ve left strict obedience behind in favor of  &quot;house <br/>
manners&quot;----more unschooly. &lt;g&gt; But still, we know what&#39;s  instinctive and how to <br/>
work WITH that, not against it.<br/>
