<div id="ygrps-yiv-147455364">Karen, I&#39;m so sorry your post got lost in the all the conversation.<br/>
 <br/>
This stuff is HARD. You made a really hard decision  to ask your  daughter to <br/>
leave, NOT because you don&#39;t love her or want her, but because you  had to <br/>
protect the whole family. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s angry. Hopefully her grandmother  will <br/>
care for her without buying into her anger. Stay in touch with her. Call  her <br/>
every day, even if she won&#39;t talk to you. Not to process or discuss her  <br/>
issues, but just checking in. Encourage the other kids to stay in touch with her  <br/>
too.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck:)<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
