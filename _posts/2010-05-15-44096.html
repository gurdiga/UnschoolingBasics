<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875297812">My 10 y/o son really, really, really wants a job.<br/>
<br/>
At first the issue was just money.  We couldn&#39;t figure out how to fit<br/>
an allowance into our already tight (so tight sometimes it&#39;s choosing<br/>
food or electric) budget.  Our income fluctuates from week to week (my<br/>
partner and I both work in retail) and we pay the bills as we can<br/>
scrape together the money.  A set allowance wouldn&#39;t work, because<br/>
some weeks the only $5 left over isn&#39;t really left over because we<br/>
need to get gas.  I&#39;m sure some of you have been there before.<br/>
Suddenly it hit me  . . . a percentage!  He now gets 1% of all of our<br/>
income.  If/when I start getting child support again (not holding my<br/>
breath on that one) then we&#39;ll give him a higher percentage of that<br/>
particular income.  Some weeks he gets $5, this week he got $8, some<br/>
weeks it may be even more.  This works out well because the more hours<br/>
we work, the more we ask for help keeping the house running, so where<br/>
I don&#39;t feel right paying him for helping exactly, it does feel right<br/>
that when he&#39;s more inconvenienced (by spending more time alone, less<br/>
time with someone to drive him to where he wants to go, etc.) he gets<br/>
more money.<br/>
<br/>
However, he wanted more.  So I helped him place an ad on craigslist as<br/>
a mothers helper.  We didn&#39;t get a single response, which is somewhat<br/>
understandable . . . most people wouldn&#39;t think a 10 y/o boy would be<br/>
capable of being a mothers helper.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I mentioned the idea of volunteering at a store that<br/>
sells things he&#39;s interested in.  That way he could trade his time for<br/>
knowledge about the items he&#39;s interested in, as well as knowledge<br/>
about running a business.  At first he was hesitant . . . &quot;I want<br/>
MONEY!&quot;, but once I reccomended he try the Magic Card/ D&D / Comic<br/>
shop he brightened up and started pointing out all of the positive<br/>
aspects to volunteering.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped by the card shop and were shot down by a very rude manager<br/>
who said point blank &quot;we just fired two people for theft, we&#39;re not<br/>
allowing anyone to work in this store&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When we were driving home, Draven pointed out the little toy/hobby<br/>
shop within walking distance of our house.  We stopped in and talked<br/>
to the manager there and he was very receptive, but said he had to<br/>
check with the companies lawyer and that may take some time.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t frequent many shops, so I don&#39;t know any store owners<br/>
personally.  He&#39;s not interested in doing yard work (we&#39;re in florida,<br/>
and he&#39;s not fond of the heat).  Honestly, I&#39;m out of ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283992079">I had a paper route at 10. I babysat at 10 as well. Walking dogs and/or picking up dog poop for others is a good offer to put up on boards at nearby stores or Craigslist. Selling lemonade or something along those lines on a busy block may be a good money making scheme in a hot area. Washing cars, watering plants, pet sitting, working in a retirement community to help the elderly with computer skills, or with household chores like vacuuming, for a momentary income selling things on-line or in a yard sale could make a bit of money. Collect and recycle aluminum cans (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2299682_get-paid-recycling.html">http://www.ehow.com/how_2299682_get-paid-recycling.html</a> has a few suggested ways to make money recycling, one of which is collecting golf balls on golf courses), apparently most states will pay 35-70 cents for a pound of aluminum which is about 16 cans. <br/>
<br/>
I found a few of those googling for ways for a 10 year old to make money. He isn&#39;t alone in his desire for extra cash, or his frustration with the lack of options. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992316353">Is he comfortable reading out loud? If so, he could offer to read for an elderly person who may have failing vision. I work with a 94-year-old man who has lots of readers (some paid some volunteer) who help him with reading mail, newspapers, books, etc. Your son could post an ad on Craigslist about it, but I&#39;d also recommend making up flyers to post in retirement communities and nursing homes. He could also pull weeds for someone. Or walk a dog. My son has a dog walking job and it&#39;s been terrific. He gets exercise and spending money at the same time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051352947">in our city, a cart (on wheels, like a cooler with dry ice) is the same as a lemonade stand, no business license required....my teen and her friends are about to launch a natural fruit popsicle cart and take it to parks and events this summer.  it&#39;s very inexpensive - the popsicle place gives you a poster sticker for the cooler, and sells you the dry ice and the popsicles at prices intended for resale - the pospicles are 85cents each, and can be sold, i imagine, for 1.50 or so....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509957212">Tina - I feel you!  Lol.  My kids want money too.  And with 4 of them there<br/>
hasn&#39;t been a way to carve out a decent (in their eyes) allowance.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I suggested that they sell goodies this summer.  In our neighborhood the ice<br/>
cream man comes around with all his ice cream goodies, chips, etc.  I told<br/>
the kids if they wanted to they could sell stuff from our home, and kind of<br/>
undercut the ice cream truck guys.  Even if they made $5-10 bucks a week<br/>
they would feel excited about it.  Is that something your son could do in<br/>
your neighborhood?  You guys might need to give him the initial investment,<br/>
but after that he can pay for more product with his profits (or you can buy<br/>
more for him).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll read the rest of the posts with interest because this is something that<br/>
has come up in our home as well.<br/>
