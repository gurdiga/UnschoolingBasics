<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509617301">All the ones to do with schooling explain so well why we don&#39;t want our <br/>
kinds in school!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Hypocrisy Chronicles use humor to drive home the point that many <br/>
of the ways that children are viewed and treated in society are <br/>
contrary to a society that is based on freedom, equality, human rights <br/>
and democracy.&quot;<br/>
