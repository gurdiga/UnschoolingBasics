<div id="ygrps-yiv-18269787">Greetings all! I am relatively new here (this is my first post!), <br/>
and had a question for you all. Forgive me if this has been answered <br/>
ad naseum or in archives etc. But....<br/>
What brought you to unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
Why did you choose it and what put you on the path? Was is a gradual <br/>
transformation of the homeschooling journey? Did you read John Holt <br/>
in college or while pregnant and just know you wanted to unchool? <br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
I see posts all the time about &quot;how&quot; to unschool, or &quot;why&quot; to <br/>
unschool (as in the philosopy behind it). I just want to hear about <br/>
your journeys and what brought you here.<br/>
<br/>
For example. I&#39;ve always homeschooled my 2, but I started out trying <br/>
to be really structured (curriculum in a box anyone?) and then <br/>
Charlotte Mason and Classical (talk about a distaster!)and have <br/>
gradually discovered that unschooling just fit our personalities and <br/>
lifestyles to a &quot;T&quot;. I love unschooling!! It just took me awhile to <br/>
get over my brainwashed perception of what learning was (and to find <br/>
awesome books and websites about uncshooling). Fortunately, my kids <br/>
are young enough to have not been scarred by my earlier attempts <br/>
at &quot;school&quot;. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Just musing on the thought and wanted to hear other stories.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Getting to unschooling was a journey for us.  We started off with our<br/>
oldest in Kindergarden although we knew eventually we would be<br/>
homeschooling because we knew how &quot;smart&quot; our child was and that<br/>
eventually traditional schooling would be of little use for her.  She<br/>
had the &quot;dream teachers&quot; for K through 2nd (and I truly do believe<br/>
that they were wonderful teachers.  Had my children been fortunate<br/>
enough to have teachers like this all along we probably would never<br/>
had homeschooled!)  Her third grade teacher was a disaster!  We made<br/>
it a whole 3 weeks before we leapt into homeschooling.  I really felt<br/>
that my daughter needed to heal from those horrible three weeks and<br/>
then realized that I couldn&#39;t really do much that looked like real<br/>
school.  3or so years ago they dabbled back in school for a year when<br/>
their father and I separated and divorced, but came home that summer<br/>
(actually Emily quit school mid-year because of another disasterous<br/>
teacher) when my ex and I bought a house together.  From the point<br/>
when Emily quit school we started unschooling.  First it was just<br/>
cuirriculum and it eventually flowed into the rest of our lives as I<br/>
allowed myself to trust my children.  I had heard of unschooling here<br/>
and there, but hadn&#39;t done much reading of it until we really started<br/>
doing it.  Ren is the one that pointed me towards Holt, Dodd, Kohn,<br/>
etc and this list.  It was her personal touch that really helped<br/>
though.  Being able to go to her house and see her in action with her<br/>
kids.  See it all working.  That was such a blessing!  I think that is<br/>
one of the big reasons that I miss her (oh and that she always had a<br/>
pot of tea going LOL!)  Tea with Ren.  I should write a book :)<br/>
<br/>
I think that reading books from experienced unschoolers (including my<br/>
friend Terry who is quoted throughout the Unschooling Handbook - and<br/>
who I know through LLL) and blogs and posts and articles has really<br/>
helped affirm more than convince me of where we are heading.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For our family we have always worked to live consensually with our <br/>
children.  Them being human beings, not less than as some parents see <br/>
their children, with thoughts, feeling, ideas, wants and needs all <br/>
their own.  We have always believed that the individual is fully <br/>
capable of knowing what is best for himself.  Having this foundation of <br/>
working together, talking, seeking, and exploring, has led us to <br/>
explore unschooling as one facet of our lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Our children became &quot;school age&quot; we all knew that school would not work <br/>
for any of us.  They were not ready to be apart from the loving, <br/>
nurturing environment they had, why would they.  We were not at all <br/>
comfortable with the idea of sending a 4 or 5 year old off on their own <br/>
all day to &quot;fight&quot; their way through.  So we began exploring all <br/>
alternatives.  Homeschooling was the way, and unschooling just fit in <br/>
with our philosophy of self determination.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we have days filled with joy, and wonder as I get to see the world <br/>
a new, with my children exploring and learning all the time.  So <br/>
unschooling is a choice we made, and that we continue to make on a <br/>
daily basis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656686839">We fell into unschooling. We always coslept, fed on demand, etc. We  <br/>
started the traditional route with schooling, but I never really  <br/>
liked being away from my kids. When we decided to pull them out of  <br/>
school (due primarily to the use and abuse of my children with  <br/>
difAbilities), I started with the school at home, but *I* was so  <br/>
uncomfortable with it that we stopped. When I was put in bedrest, the  <br/>
rest of it fell into place. Didn&#39;t know what it was til a sahd  <br/>
pointed it out to me. I haven&#39;t read any of the books, just stuff  <br/>
online, esp at sandradodd.com<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just before I was pregnant with DS, my MIL called us and asked us to <br/>
do some research for her (we&#39;re good at it and way more computer <br/>
literate). She was having problems with the two youngest (DH has 3 <br/>
sisters, one is 2 yrs younger and the other two are 15 and 17 yrs <br/>
younger respectively). They were diagnosed with anxiety disorders and <br/>
depression right around age 14ish (one right after the other). They <br/>
could NOT go to school - between the anxiety and the medication which <br/>
often had them awake all night and asleep all day and all like that. <br/>
MIL requested the school send a homebound tutor (DH had had a tutor <br/>
for a bit around age 11 when he was literally bedridden after hip <br/>
surgery). The school district wouldn&#39;t help an inch. MIL was about in <br/>
tears about what to do, truant officers, DCF, etc. We found that CT <br/>
(where they live, we were in OK at the time) has really great <br/>
homeschooling laws, or rather lack thereof. MIL and FIL both worked <br/>
fulltime but the girls were old enough to be home by themselves. In <br/>
the process, DH and I started discussing the idea of homeschooling. <br/>
Then lo and behold I was pregnant! According to MIL I called and <br/>
said &quot;You&#39;re going to be a grandma and we&#39;re homeschooling&quot; Now, MIL <br/>
had texts and left assignments for the girls to do and all like that <br/>
(relaxedly schoolish). DH and I fell onto the topic &quot;unschooling&quot; and <br/>
I read a bunch at various places and we started on the path - it made <br/>
perfect sense to DH, I still kind of looked at scope & sequence stuff <br/>
a bit until DS was maybe 4 or 5 - then it was so apparent that <br/>
learning was happening in all sorts of ways, I just stopped bothering <br/>
about it. Over time, things have changed and grown or refined - for <br/>
instance, we did smack his butt on occasion when he was really young <br/>
(that ended by the time he was about 3) and he did have a bedtime <br/>
(which ended when he was about 5). Food and electronics (TV, video, <br/>
computer, videogames) were never big issues - though we did avoid <br/>
videogame systems for a bit because of DH&#39;s history with them. But <br/>
when DS was about 5, we got him a gameboy and that has progressed to a <br/>
PlayStation 2 and his own laptop at this point (he&#39;s 8 now).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876565503">Well, to share with everyone, then we can take details offlist, for  <br/>
much the same reason that any child shouldn&#39;t be at school. They are  <br/>
incapable of honoring differences. Even if your child is disabled,  <br/>
and they are servicing them in a disability program, once those  <br/>
differences make your child the wrong shape to fit in their cookie  <br/>
cutter program, then they get difficult, everyone gets stressed. I  <br/>
know I said this before, I cannot emphasize enough, that kids who  <br/>
appreciate scheduling will put themselves through hell to maintain  <br/>
that schedule. It&#39;s a far greater service to put some sort of  <br/>
schedule up at home. It&#39;s not difficult and worth it to boost their  <br/>
self-esteem.<br/>
<br/>
Breanna was all smiles through kindergarden. She had a few incidents,  <br/>
but nothing major. They &#39;taught&#39; her how to cut out shapes, how to  <br/>
trace letters, how to stand in line. all stuff that I&#39;m very aware  <br/>
now that she&#39;s older were things that she would have done when  <br/>
developmentally ready.  But it was very obvious that they were  <br/>
teaching her nothing academic, and not so much as far as social  <br/>
skills go. In fact, she learned how to hit and scream and cuss at  <br/>
school, in the first grade.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve learned is that the schools are great at hiding  <br/>
problems, and kids with disabilities often are not aware that what&#39;s  <br/>
going on is wrong. So even unpleasant, harmful things like being  <br/>
called names, being pulled around by the arm, being put in time out  <br/>
are things that they accept willingly. And being nonverbal is worse,  <br/>
because at least Josh, who has aspergers and never once realized that  <br/>
it was wrong to be treated that way, could tell me what happened and  <br/>
*I* could say something. But with Bre it was a matter of catching  <br/>
them. I was up there all the time. An hour after I dropped her off,  <br/>
an  hour at lunch, an hour before school let out. I dropped into  <br/>
music, pe, lunch, recess, at different times of the day. I made them  <br/>
very aware that I was a consumer, and that I very much expected them  <br/>
to accept my input.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d probably<br/>
