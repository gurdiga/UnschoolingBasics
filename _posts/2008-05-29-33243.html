<div id="ygrps-yiv-697673634">Just a little more insight into this since I have a child with autism<br/>
and this has been much discussed on the autism support lists I am on.<br/>
 First this child has a form of high functioning autism which means in<br/>
this child&#39;s case he is likely to be able to more than handle the<br/>
academic coursework or be on a standard course of study as they call<br/>
it.  What is happening in many of our schools is that if your child<br/>
can be on SCOS they are mainstreamed many times without appropriate<br/>
support for behavioral and social issues which these children tend to<br/>
struggle with.   Many regular classroom teachers have no training or<br/>
experience with this population but are expected to handle this child<br/>
in the regular classroom without much help.   The parents are told if<br/>
they child needs more support than that they need to be in a self<br/>
contained classroom where many times the child is not allowed to be on<br/>
the SCOS because they require a separate classroom (most restrictive<br/>
placement) and well you see the tangled web!!!<br/>
In our county here in NC  they are doing away with many self contained<br/>
classrooms and mainstreaming any child they think they can... teachers<br/>
have no additional training or support and many times neither does the<br/>
child but the parents are basically told they have to chose how<br/>
&quot;impaired&quot; their child is and don&#39;t we all want our child to be<br/>
challenged in life? (UGH!)    <br/>
So basically this child is being being blamed for being different and<br/>
needing the supports the school refuses to give him from an untrained<br/>
teacher(who seems to have some difficulty being a decent human to<br/>
boot) and people just want to blame his parents for this whole<br/>
catastrophe!     <br/>
<br/>
Anyway just another perspective and one more time in life I have to<br/>
say I am so glad my kids typical and otherwise don&#39;t have to be at the<br/>
mercy of such a broken system.<br/>
