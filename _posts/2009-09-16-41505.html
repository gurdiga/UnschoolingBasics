<div id="ygrps-yiv-337960582">I locked on to this conversation because my own son is experimenting with drugs at the moment.  I like what Diana said at LIG, that it&#39;s an entirely different ball game for kids who are doing drugs to &quot;fill a hole&quot; than for kids who are experimenting.  <br/>
<br/>
In our home we TALK A LOT!!!  And Kev researches the hell out of things so he knows an incredible amount about each and every drug.  There are certain drugs that he won&#39;t touch, no matter what!  He has experimented with pot and mushrooms at this point and really wants to do LSD.  We&#39;ve talked with several people who have experimented with it as well and he is very informed on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s already been mentioned but you aren&#39;t going to stop a child who really wants to do those things, what you can do is make it as safe as possible and I&#39;m really glad that we have the kind of relationship that he can come to me and talk to me about it.  And he isn&#39;t a &quot;druggie&quot;- he is an extremely responsible, well-grounded individual.  Diana reminded me that the man who created LSD lived to be 103 and did LOTS of it so...........  <br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m an advocate for drugs, lol, but not all drugs are the scary, &quot;oh my god, he is going to be a loser the rest of his life&quot; thing that society makes them out to be.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374649373">no, not all drugs are scary.  It&#39;s too bad that we try to lump all &quot;drug&quot; into one category.<br/>
<br/>
When we go to the Dr office it is often &quot;drug&quot; that we are<br/>
prescibed.  I have even had the experience of calling what a dr<br/>
wanted to give me drugs and they thought I meant street drugs and had<br/>
to explain.....quite the funny.<br/>
<br/>
There was an interesting person who experimented with LSD in the 60&#39;s I think. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember his &quot;real&quot; name but he goes by ram das now. wrote a book called<br/>
<br/>
Be here now.   He got to a point were he realized that the<br/>
LSD was to intermittant and went on a spiritual path. I think there is<br/>
a dvd out now about him.  He had a stroke.....<br/>
<br/>
I know very little about him.  <br/>
