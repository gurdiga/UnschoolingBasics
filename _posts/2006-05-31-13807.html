<div id="ygrps-yiv-699619794">&lt;&lt;It was nice finally meeting you too Laura! This is all very new  to <br/>
us, and although my mind is fully there, putting it all in practice  <br/>
has a way to go!   Rest assured, this is not the last time we will  <br/>
be together, and we always have here, or email, to communicate!  We  <br/>
should definitely try to get our kids together sometime (I&#39;ll keep <br/>
you  posted if we come up your way camping - we WILL be at Danforth <br/>
Bay near  Ossipee in a couple of weeks!)&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thank you. <br/>
I wanted to say in my last post that Dustin used to be shy also until we  hit <br/>
the 2004 convention. I know we discussed it but on the drive home  Sunday <br/>
Dustin and I talked more about it. He said that it helped him in 04 to  remember <br/>
our talk about being in a new place and being anything/anyone you want  to be. <br/>
His goal in 2004 was to meet as many as possible. This year it was to get  <br/>
into that teen room. <br/>
He met another girl who was wanting to meet the teens (this was her first  <br/>
year). With a lil (a few supportive words) prompting they bit the  bullet and <br/>
walked into the room. My heart sunk. There is no way as a teen I  would have <br/>
been able to do that. My eyes welled with tears I could quickly  blink away when <br/>
I saw my son brave the unknown. I hoped he would have a great  experience and <br/>
he did. My son the former introvert seeking friendship also  joined the <br/>
hugging session. He wore a pink ribbon on his name tag too (took  me a second to <br/>
figure that out but I got it).<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling but I wanted to say that next time your  daughter is <br/>
welcome to connect with us and Dustin said he will walk her in  and stay with <br/>
her. I will remember she&#39;s there..I have no clue how I missed  that she wasn&#39;t <br/>
out and about and for that i&#39;m sorry.  Dustin  said he wished he knew and to put <br/>
his name on that meet list next time and he&#39;ll  hook her up with some new <br/>
peps:)<br/>
 <br/>
I still need to DL the photo&#39;s but I&#39;ll get them out.<br/>
I keep smiling and thinking of the dude from Maine who sang the song  and <br/>
forgot the words and sang something like Laa laa laa I forgot the words...  but <br/>
it&#39;s ok... bc this is an unschooling conference ..and you all wont  judge me <br/>
for forgetting. The applause he got brought more tears as I tried to  snap a <br/>
photo. I got it though!<br/>
