<div id="ygrps-yiv-703551467">I am a writer. As we removed my son Julian (now 16) from school after the  <br/>
third grade, he hated to write. All of his experiences with writing had been  <br/>
forced &quot;journal&quot; writing and stupid vocabulary sentences.<br/>
 <br/>
Shortly after he&#39;d NOT gone back to school, I invited him to go across the  <br/>
street to the beach we lived near to write poetry. I think he was so startled <br/>
by  the question he said yes. (we&#39;d already had multiple conversations and  <br/>
experiences where he knew he could say no.)<br/>
 <br/>
So we sat on the beach and I told him about haiku. He liked the idea of  <br/>
haiku because it was short, had structure that his little Virgo brain  <br/>
appreciated, and was usually about something in nature, and animals were his  passion.<br/>
 <br/>
VERY quickly he&#39;d written a very nice poem about our friend Sarah&#39;s guide  <br/>
dog, whom he loved. He was thrilled that he was able to write something he  <br/>
actually liked, and wrote several more. That was it for quite a while.<br/>
 <br/>
The next writing experience was quite a few months later. The church we  went <br/>
to had a mouse problem. At first they put out a few have-a-heart traps that  <br/>
apparently the mice liked quite a bit -- bait disappeared but never was a <br/>
mouse  caught. The church has a food pantry (that Julian volunteered at, with me), <br/>
and  they had to deal with the problem. They called an exterminator, who <br/>
informed  them they had thousands of mice living in there.<br/>
 <br/>
Julian, who had always been a vegetarian and, as I said, LOVED animals, was  <br/>
horrified and upset. He understood that there really wasn&#39;t another option, <br/>
but  he wanted to do something.<br/>
 <br/>
What he did was to write something for the church newsletter telling people  <br/>
about the situation and to be careful not to leave food out that could attract <br/>
 mice in the future. He used the word &quot;tragedy&quot; several times, and quite a <br/>
few  adults later told him that his writing helped them to remember to be  <br/>
careful.<br/>
 <br/>
He didn&#39;t write often for a long time. His handwriting was awkward and he  <br/>
found it frustrating. He was doing other things. Then when he had just turned 14 <br/>
 he took a class at Harvard University Extension in Evolution and Society.   <br/>
He was very interested in the topic, and despite his age, his fellow students  <br/>
(the next youngest was 21) assumed he was at least 18.<br/>
 <br/>
He had several challenging papers to  write, and we coached him  through <br/>
them. We didn&#39;t write them for him (we knew nothing about the topic),  but we did <br/>
do some typing as he spoke, and we showed him how to structure a  paper. He <br/>
ended up getting a B+ in the class, which was nice (and is useful when  talking <br/>
to a skeptical grandmother), but not really why he took the class.<br/>
 <br/>
Now he writes songs and has taken a couple more courses with lots of  <br/>
writing. He is fine. His writing has developed because he had authentic reasons  for <br/>
doing it that he cared about. Writing is still not something he loves for  the <br/>
sake of doing it, but it&#39;s a tool for him.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh....his handwriting is still not, well, pretty...but he types very fast  on <br/>
the computer and now the act of recording his writing can keep up with what&#39;s <br/>
 happening in his brain. That has made a HUGE difference.<br/>

I wonder what that is based on, because I too, have terrible handwriting<br/>
(I think) but I type like a maniac.  And am also a virgo.  :-)  I never<br/>
liked writing until I started typing, and typing didnt come easily at<br/>
first either, not until I got an instant message program in college!<br/>
Now I type nearly 75wpm.  And can keep up with whats happening in my<br/>
brain :-)  <br/>
 <br/>
I should write more.I think Ill think about that some and see if I can<br/>
get anything to come out :-)  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981489352">I just realized that I haven&#39;t introduced myself!  <br/>
 <br/>
Hello All :-)  I am Kristin, mother to Ainsley who is nearly 5yo.  I<br/>
have no intentions of using the public school system here in Florida, as<br/>
it is dreadful (IMO)<br/>
 <br/>
I am trying to unschool my child, or let her lead the way in her<br/>
learning, while also keeping 4 &#39;other peoples kids&#39; in my home during<br/>
the day.  I have found this to be most challenging, however it is our<br/>
only option right now.  I am a single mom, and the daycare is my only<br/>
income.  At least it gives me the opportunity to stay home!!!  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope to learn much from the group. :-)  <br/>
