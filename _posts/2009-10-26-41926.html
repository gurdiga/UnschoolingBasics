<div id="ygrps-yiv-521985526">This looks like an interesting children&#39;s book for a child who&#39;s family is<br/>
going to have a homebirth.<br/>

Hello Ladies of BirthNet NY,<br/>
I hope this finds you all well. As my husband and I began to prepare for our<br/>
Dec homebirth, we realized how little was out there by way of children&#39;s<br/>
literature for our nearly 2yr old who will be there for the big day, so I<br/>
have written/illustrated and self-published a children&#39;s book for<br/>
homebirthing families and wanted to share the website with you. I am getting<br/>
great feedback from midwives/doulas and families who are finding it to be a<br/>
fun, informative, useful and very affordable tool for children whose<br/>
families are planning a homebirth...which is fantastic!<br/>

<br/>
As you well know, the homebirthing community is strong and tight, although<br/>
rather small. I encourage you to share the link with anyone and everyone who<br/>
you think can benefit from it, and I thank you in advance for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
All the very best,<br/>
Kelly Mochel<br/>

PS. In addition to the positive review on my website, ICAN is set to publish<br/>
a positive review in the next issue of the Clarion...which we are thrilled<br/>
about!<br/>
