<br/>
I put myself in time out occasionally! In fact, I did so last night. I<br/>
was really, really cranky....just felt like snapping at anyone in my<br/>
path and was trying to re-gain a sense of calm by cleaning the<br/>
kitchen. The kids were asking me to make rice krispie treats and there<br/>
wasn&#39;t a single inch of counter space available.<br/>
I explained that NO, I could not think clearly at the moment and to<br/>
please give me some time to clean so I could respond better.<br/>
Sierra was kinda mad at me, so I cleaned up and sat at the computer<br/>
for five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
She came in and asked about the rice krispie treats and I said &quot;I&#39;m in<br/>
time-out for a little while&quot;<br/>
&quot;I HATE time out&quot; she proclaims. This made me laugh a bit, since she&#39;s<br/>
never been in time out, but she hates it when there&#39;s an idea brewing<br/>
and I have to hide for a minute. I apologized and told her to give me<br/>
five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I got centered, had a clean kitchen again and started the rice krispie<br/>
treats. We ended the evening eating our treats and watching America&#39;s<br/>
funniest home videos, laughing our butts off and trying to laugh<br/>
without being too loud for Markus, who was sleeping by now (it was<br/>
midnight).<br/>

<br/>
Please blather away... I am always reading three books - one for pleasure,<br/>
one for enrichment and one on homeschooling, unschooling or parent issues.<br/>
This week it is Witch Storm, a reread of the Tao de Ching and starting How<br/>
To Talk So Your Kids Can Learn.<br/>
<br/>
I am always looking for new perspectives and new tools to help guide my<br/>
children to become happy, healthy, well adjusted adults. Every once in a<br/>
while I have a bad day and it gives everyone a bad day - it is nice to hear<br/>
that there are others that have bad days. I feel guilty about bad days - my<br/>
logic says everyone has bad days but my emotional side says yes, but what<br/>
have you modeled for your children?<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am working (and have been for months) on my yelling. I hate<br/>
yelling but when I get frustrated I yell so I am working towards not doing<br/>
that. I think when I beginning to get frustrated I am going to stop<br/>
everything and hug and kiss the kids instead.  <br/>

***********<br/>
 <br/>
Humor is a good transition out of anger.  My kids like all  things silly.  <br/>
Last time I yelled, once I caught myself, I started  saying &quot;Mommy is a crazy <br/>
person&quot; and parodied myself being upset and out of  control.  They liked that a <br/>
lot &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
 <br/>
A good follow-up is &quot;mommy yells when she gets mad, what do you do?&quot;.   <br/>
Everybody puts on a good show and has some fun.  I think it helps to  not take it <br/>
all so seriously, and to understand that everyone has intense  feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun, Shannon!  <br/>

I am going to have to go back to look at these two books again.  I had problems with them when i read them years ago. I found them to be a bit manipulative and even condescending.  Though I suppose for some it may be a good starting place for better communication skills.  I recall thinking the suggestions to be motivated by coercion rather than real empathy or compassion - the goal being to control and manipulate your child.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lisa - I sort of agree. They are motivated by the parent wanting to  <br/>
know how to get kids to do what they want them to do. I think that is  <br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
So - yeah - take them with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
Still - they are great examples of ways to communicate without  <br/>
nagging and yelling and commanding, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are cartoons and scripts - I got a LOT out of them when my kids  <br/>
were little and it made a HUGE difference in how my husband spoke to  <br/>
the kids. I&#39;ll never forget how it bugged him so MUCH that Roya would  <br/>
leave wet towels on the furniture - he used to lecture and get mad  <br/>
and beg and demand - always caused hard feelings. Then he read about  <br/>
the &quot;Say it in a word&quot; idea  --- and one night Roya tossed her wet  <br/>
towel on the back of the couch and was walking away and Cyrus just  <br/>
said, &quot;Towel.&quot; Quietly. Calmly. Roya turned around and grabbed her  <br/>
towel and took it with her. Happily.<br/>

Still - they are great examples of ways to communicate without  nagging and yelling and commanding, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to learn to &#39;control&#39; your kids wo nagging yelling and commanding - there is a workbook format for the authors&#39; works to help increase your power skills &lt;g&gt;.  I know several local folks who have used it.  And there are folks who lead workshops in these techniques.  btw - leading workshops could be a source of addtional income for some sahm as the books are so popular.<br/>

<br/>
I like this image.  When my dh  makes a shift and is less bullying in communicating his need, he too is met with supportive humor and joy that he is growing.  It&#39;s nice when our kids can have compassion for adults learning to shift behaviour.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree too. But when coming from more traditional ways of treating  <br/>
children, it&#39;s a turn in the right direction. I think it&#39;s very  <br/>
helpful in getting parents to see that children do things -- or  <br/>
refuse to do things -- for very legitimate-to-them reasons. And if  <br/>
you&#39;re approaching them as though they&#39;re being unreasonable, as it  <br/>
is with most traditional parenting, it&#39;s just going to backfire. It  <br/>
turns into a battle of wills. Their books approach interacting with  <br/>
children by parents understand their kids&#39; points of view. At least  <br/>
that &#39;s what I got out of it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lisa - I kind of think that&#39;s an overstatement, though. For example,  <br/>
there is help on how to respond when something goes really wrong for  <br/>
your child and you can&#39;t fix it, at least immediately. We&#39;re in the  <br/>
car, driving across Arizona, a hundred miles from the next rest stop,  <br/>
the kid wants to stop NOW and get ice cream. These books would have  <br/>
some ideas for ways to respond to that which would not escalate the  <br/>
bad feelings, but help the kid get through the next hour and a half  <br/>
while waiting. Beats the heck out of a parent feeling helpless and  <br/>
maybe even getting frustrated and angry that the child doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand the constraints.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m most definitely not saying these books, in and of themselves, are  <br/>
perfect. To me, the authors missed the underlying principles of many  <br/>
of their OWN ideas - they don&#39;t have a unifying basis and so the  <br/>
impression is just that these are &quot;techniques&quot; that &quot;work.&quot; THAT I  <br/>
don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
But - for someone who has (or is developing) a truly respectful  <br/>
parenting approach, these books are really great at helping provide  <br/>
ideas for words to use. My husband was at a complete loss - he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why a kid would toss wet towels on the furniture  <br/>
after she&#39;d been very nicely asked to not do that (I should mention  <br/>
that we have a pool and the kids have to walk through the living room  <br/>
to get to the bathroom or their bedrooms AND we do get mold and wet  <br/>
stuff doesn&#39;t dry quickly when piled up). SHE had good intentions -  <br/>
but she was and is VERY much in a hurry and very often doesn&#39;t take  <br/>
the few seconds it takes to stop and think about what she&#39;s doing. I  <br/>
kept telling him that he didn&#39;t need to get irritated with her, just  <br/>
remind her nicely. But HE thought she shouldn&#39;t need reminding and  <br/>
that she was doing it on purpose and so on. &quot;I&quot; could just say, &quot;Hey,  <br/>
honey, take your towel with you,&quot; and her internal response  <br/>
(conscious or not) would be, &quot;Oh - yeah - my towel, thanks for  <br/>
reminding me.&quot; But he&#39;d say things like, &quot;How many times do I have to  <br/>
remind you to take your towel.&quot; Or, &quot;You forgot your towel again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again - nothing wrong with a reminder - but HOW to do it matters a  <br/>
lot. He&#39;d hurt her feelings over and over by the tone and by the  <br/>
words he chose. I showed him the little section of the &quot;How to Talk&quot;  <br/>
book about &quot;Use a Word&quot; and that was a really big eye-opener to him.  <br/>
Not just that she&#39;d &quot;do what he wanted.&quot; That was the LEAST important  <br/>
part - it was that he realized that she truly wasn&#39;t purposely  <br/>
ignoring him, that she wanted to be helpful, that she was fine with  <br/>
taking her towel, and so on. Changed the way he thought of her ---  <br/>
that&#39;s a lot different than saying he just found a technique that  <br/>
worked to let him control her.<br/>
