<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070103009">Kelly,   A couple of your recent posts have really hit home with me.  I<br/>
wanted to add my 2 cents and pose a question or two.   First, though,<br/>
I&#39;ll introduce myself as I&#39;ve been lurking for months.    We live in MD<br/>
and have been homeschooling since Oct. 2005.  Thomas had just started<br/>
3rd grade and the same old junk was happening so he and Ally(1st grade)<br/>
came home.  Brian(4) was in a wonderful nursery school and he loved it<br/>
so he stayed.  If only public schools were like that nursery school. BIG<br/>
SIGH!    Fast forward to now.  Thomas has decided to return to ps for<br/>
5th grade.  I don&#39;t want him to but I&#39;m supportive of his decision.  He<br/>
is a bright kid, and did well, by school standards.  While in school, <br/>
his behaviour at home was a nightmare - all the stress from the school<br/>
day came out as aggression and anger toward us.  He really relaxed as we<br/>
de-schooled for 4 months and seemed to enjoy our homeschool routine<br/>
(school-at-home) for a couple months in 2006.  At that point he began to<br/>
rebel against schoolwork so I researched unschooling, joined a yahoo<br/>
group, did lots of reading and we moved towards the unschooling.   But<br/>
he was lost.  Without the structure of a school day he felt his days<br/>
were wasted and any attempt on my part to engage him resulted in<br/>
meltdowns and lashing out.  He viewed it as me trying to &#39;teach&#39; him<br/>
something.  Honestly, I was trying to help him work through it all - to<br/>
give some direction to his day so he wouldn&#39;t feel wasted.  So, I waited<br/>
for him to engage me, to ask me to do something.  He always wanted me to<br/>
read to him, so read, read, read, is what I did.  I felt like I was<br/>
ignoring the younger 2 but they were content to play with each other and<br/>
when they needed me, Thomas was ok with &quot;I&#39;ll be back in 10 minutes.&quot;<br/>
Usually he&#39;d read ahead in the book and I&#39;d have to catch-up .  This<br/>
lasted for about 6 months - somedays we&#39;d build Lego or he&#39;d tell me<br/>
about his comics.  He&#39;d spend hours on Club Penguin, or he&#39;d read by<br/>
himself.  He did a SpongeBob keyboarding game so he could IM his cousins<br/>
without me.  I could tell he was healing.  Then one day he announced<br/>
that he wasn&#39;t ever going to do math.  He was going to be a<br/>
grocer-bagger because they don&#39;t need math. No problem.  Then he started<br/>
saving money for a DS Lite.  He asked how much grocer-baggers made.  He<br/>
realized he&#39;d need a better paying job as an adult( I know, far in the<br/>
future, but that&#39;s how he thinks), so he decided to be a chef - &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
only do fractions and measurements!&quot;  He made chicken cacciatore,<br/>
angelfood cake, beef barley soup, peppermint brownies - nothing easy,<br/>
and he did it pretty much on his own.  His cooking phase lasted a couple<br/>
months.  Then he got restless again - teasing, bugging, wandering, etc. <br/>
I didn&#39;t know what to do to help him.  Eventually he told us he felt<br/>
like he was stupid, like he didn&#39;t do anything all day, that he was<br/>
behind all his friends in school.  He&#39;d cry that he wanted go back -<br/>
maybe, maybe not.  Then one day this past  June, he announced that he<br/>
was going back to school this fall.  Since he&#39;s made the decision he has<br/>
been much calmer, happier, and settled.  I don&#39;t know how long he&#39;ll<br/>
stay in school - he hated it!   But he&#39;s made a decision he&#39;s happy with<br/>
and he leave 5th gr. and come back to homeschooling.     Your comment<br/>
You weren&#39;t unschooling. You were just letting him be while you did<br/>
other things. Unschooling is about trusting that he will learn when he<br/>
is ready. That INCLUDES reading and math. in response to Tyra&#39;s post<br/>
really hit home with me because that was me!  I did let him be while I<br/>
did my own thing, but lots of reading (here and various books) helped me<br/>
to see that.  And now, I do trust that he will learn whatever when he&#39;s<br/>
ready/wants.  He and I have talked about it endlessly, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>
trust himself.  How do I get him to that point?    And this one No, he<br/>
hates being having his mother as his teacher. A very common<br/>
problem in school-at-home families. Standards are high, pressure is<br/>
high, and child feels like crap because he can&#39;t please his own mom---OR<br/>
even complain to his mom and dad that his teacher sucks.  was also true<br/>
for us.  My goodness!  It&#39;s painful to realize.  He hated having me as<br/>
his teacher - he said so a million times, but I never thought about the<br/>
2nd part (feeling like crap &#39;cause he can&#39;t complain) Talk about being<br/>
hit over the head with a sledgehammer!  I didn&#39;t realize how awful it<br/>
was for him.  There was no safe outlet for his frustration and anger -<br/>
we were together all the time and I was constantly harping on him - poor<br/>
guy!  And now that I&#39;m  not going to be his teacher, he can love me<br/>
again, as his mom - only his mom!  It makes so much sense.  I must<br/>
remember to talk to him about this when he gets home from camp.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want him to stay in school because it is the lesser of the two evils.  I<br/>
want him to come home and enjoy our time together as a family.       <br/>
there is a LOT of teaching going on in schools during this time; and<br/>
since the students are still in a learning mode, they&#39;ll seem to know so<br/>
much more than your own, unschooled kids. What&#39;s good to keep im mind is<br/>
that they aren&#39;t RETAINING much of this! Sure, they can regurgitate a<br/>
bunch of facts, but it&#39;s not really learning that sticks. our children<br/>
are *absorbing* HUGE amounts of<br/>
facts and figures and ...schtuff! But it&#39;s not yet regurgitable. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Here: Schooled kids are *swallowing* the info and spitting it back out. <br/>
YOUR kids are DIGESTING a lot of the same material---it&#39;s becoming part<br/>
of them---just like longer bones and more skin and bigger teeth. But<br/>
your children&#39;s knowledge won&#39;t show up<br/>
as....something.....*Tangible*!...until quite a while afterwards.   It<br/>
has taken me the past 2 years to understand the truth of this!  How can<br/>
I help him recognize the truth of this?  Where he realizes that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t need a school schedule to learn these things, that his schooled<br/>
friends only know that stuff  &#39;in the now&#39; but it&#39;s meaningless to them<br/>
and it was torture for many of them.   I know this is long - sorry!    <br/>
Thank you so much for this group!  I am so fortunate to have you all to<br/>
give advice, kick me the butt, pick me up and put me back on the<br/>
unschooling path.    Jen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984421075">We live just north of Baltimore.<br/>
   <br/>
  We are involved with a bunch of hsing groups - lots of field trips, classes, informal get-togethers.  Thomas enjoys most of that and has met a couple good friends (both unschoolers) but at home he is &#39;lost&#39; and I don&#39;t know how to help him get past the mindset of &#39;if I&#39;m not in school learning then my day is wasted&#39;.  He will actively engage in 1:1 activities with me (like reading and lego, or building stuff in the garage, crafts), but with 2 other kids I can&#39;t do that all the time.  <br/>

It may be not so much that he needed &quot;structure&quot; as routine and <br/>
predictability. When Ray was younger he was much steadier with a <br/>
regular routine and lots of discussion about any variability. He <br/>
*liked* doing new things, but didn&#39;t deal very well with spur-of-the- <br/>
moment changes. <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I notice that when his routine has been really regular for a <br/>
few weeks he&#39;s much more willing to do things on the fly and make snap <br/>
decisions. When his routine is disrupted (it has been lately) he <br/>
gravitates toward what&#39;s most predictable in his world. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975374821">Thanks Meredith,<br/>
   <br/>
  I like that differentiation between structure and routine.  You are right!  Whenever we had a routine, he was better - more settled and calmer.  And when the routine varies, he&#39;s usually adaptable, but if it is an ongoing interruption (i.e more that a couple days) it gets more difficult for him to deal with it.  But he also gets bored with it after a couple weeks and then we need to change things around.<br/>
   <br/>
  Can I ask what you did for a routine to help Ray feel settled?  If I had suggestions for him from someone else, it may help him, rather than everything coming from me. Unfortunately, when we talk about setting up a routine, he meltsdown and tells me I&#39;m trying to control him - sigh!  <br/>

<br/>
Hey Meridith,<br/>
<br/>
great distinction there. I find the same - it&#39;s not so much the structure,<br/>
but how stable or consistent we are as human beings towards our kids. I think<br/>
some parents themselves feel &#39;out of control&#39; without lessons, so the kids<br/>
would respond to that by acting out, etc. I find that we can cover any &quot;book<br/>
larnin&#39;&quot; as a choice we all make - I mean if we all decide to read together<br/>
and then discuss the book, etc. And my kids like to know what&#39;s happening<br/>
on any given day, or the day after - my daughter has learnt the days of the<br/>
week and tome by asking &quot;What are we doing later?&quot; and &quot;What are we doing<br/>
tomorrow?&quot;. I admit that I don&#39;t ALWAYS know the answer to that question,<br/>
but I certainly think it helps the kids to know what is on the agenda, both<br/>
to look forward to things and make choices re - participation.<br/>

*******************<br/>
<br/>
We never really suggested or &quot;set up&quot; a routine. It was more a <br/>
committment (mostly on my part) to doing things in a very <br/>
predictable, orderly way/sequence and discuss any changes with Ray <br/>
beforehand. *He* had to be free to do things his own way within my <br/>
routine. I arranged my own routine around his needs, mostly wrt <br/>
food - making meals and offerring snacks at regular intervals. <br/>
Breakfast became our time to check in and discuss any variations in <br/>
the day&#39;s routine, trips to the store or whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
With Ray, predictability extended to &quot;a place for everything and <br/>
everything in its place&quot;. If he had to hunt for something, he was <br/>
more out-of-sorts in general. If he had to hunt for something *and* <br/>
he was hungry or tired, it was a lot more likely he&#39;d meltdown. This <br/>
is waaaay less of an issue nowadays, but some of that may be that <br/>
George and I are pretty well &quot;trained&quot; at this point, especially in <br/>
the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe with your son you could talk about wanting to have more of <br/>
a routine for yourself and asking for his input. What sorts of <br/>
things do you do that he likes? dislikes? For instance, does he like <br/>
to come and wake you up, or would he rather get up to find mom <br/>
already awake and doing something? Does he like to talk about things <br/>
first thing in the morning? right before going to bed? some other <br/>
time? <br/>
<br/>
Think about your routine as a framework - like a jungle-gym. Meals <br/>
and check-ins and sleep form the structure, but he can climb in and <br/>
around and over it, and even jump off if he wants. <br/>
