<br/>
Waving from Calgary too!  Hey, maybe we could do a lake day on the Sunday?  It would still be nice in September.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420385971">thanks Jodi - I will watch for it. <br/>
I mentioned it to the girls and they sounded pretty interested. <br/>
Hope there is something there for  shy teenagers and 70 year old great-<br/>
grandmas- ;-)  like comfortable chairs-<br/>
<br/>
Judy- a lake day sounds great if next September is anything like this <br/>
one was here.<br/>
Would need someone to follow-havnt driven in Calgary for ten years-<br/>
havnt even gone there in about 4.<br/>
too much traffic for a rural old gal.<br/>
but Logging roads and mountain roads -no problem.<br/>
