<div id="ygrps-yiv-12704662">Interested in room-sharing with me at the Live and Learn Conference?<br/>
<br/>
I have two double rooms reserved for my family and any adventurous<br/>
souls  who wish to join us at a zero or reduced room rate. This may<br/>
involve &quot;camping&quot; on the floor if the beds fill up.  If it&#39;s anything<br/>
like last year, you won&#39;t be spending much time in the room other than<br/>
sleeping and washing up...<br/>
I&#39;m thinking we could maybe have a quiet room for those who reslly<br/>
NEED to sleep and a night owl room for those who need less sleep and<br/>
more socializing time.  <br/>
(This is my own &quot;project&quot; to try helping others alleviate the<br/>
financial crunch of attending.  Not affiliated with the organizers of<br/>
the conference.)<br/>
<br/>
Email me or call me BY AUGUST 15  to &quot;reserve&quot; your space <br/>
