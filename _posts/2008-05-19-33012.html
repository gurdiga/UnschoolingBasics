<div id="ygrps-yiv-769466516">Well, with us structure doesn&#39;t mean a strict schedule of how and  <br/>
when things happen. What it does mean is that there&#39;s a pretty set  <br/>
routine that we follow (breakfast, play, lunch, play, dinner, play,  <br/>
bath, bedtime). We can insert things into the routine with some  <br/>
advanced warning, and Sunday nights we sit down as a family and talk  <br/>
about what is coming up that&#39;s pretty mandatory (drs appointments  <br/>
mostly) and ask what people would like to see (zoo trips mostly) and  <br/>
insert that into the calendar.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids I think appreciate knowing what&#39;s going to happen. Most of  <br/>
my kids need to know or their anxiety shoots up really fast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307212510">We have structure when the kids want structure. My kids both are happier <br/>
when they have a plan for the day- they prefer to get out of the house <br/>
and see people every day which does usually take planning. I on and off <br/>
will make up a calendar for them that has all our scheduled activities <br/>
on it - when they ask. And we all have our routines- such as what feels <br/>
better to do first thing in the morning though this is all a choice, <br/>
too, and just seems to happen.<br/>

<br/>
I have young kids (6 & 4), and my oldest really does better when he can<br/>
predict what&#39;s going to happen.  So we have a weekly calendar up on their<br/>
bedroom wall.  (Each day of the week is written on an index card and put<br/>
across the wall in order.)  Every morning (or the night before) we cuddle on<br/>
the floor and talk about what each person wants to do that day.  We write<br/>
each idea on a sticky note and put them under &quot;today&#39;s&quot; day of the week.  If<br/>
we don&#39;t get to something, or it would work better on a different day (for<br/>
example, the kids wanted to go on a hike today, but it rained), we just put<br/>
the sticky note on the next day.  If there is something that happens weekly<br/>
(T-ball games), I usually write that on an index card and keep it under the<br/>
appropriate day of the week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033300606">Ds9, dh, and I all use a Google calendar to keep track of our activities. We<br/>
each have a personal calendar which is able to be viewed by the others. We<br/>
also have a family calendar which has events that involve 3/4 or 4/4 of us.<br/>
DH and I know to check dsÂ¹s calendar frequently since we usually need to<br/>
drive him places. Dd4 is using a paper calendar with some homemade stickers<br/>
for each activity going during the money (Monday she gets her weekly<br/>
spending money, Thursday gymnastics, friends coming to play tomorrow, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Ds also has a chalk board in his room on which we have written things to do<br/>
for the following day just before bed. He is shifting in his before bed<br/>
needs and currently does nothing but change clothes in his room. The<br/>
chalkboard has not been used in weeks. But I am sure that will change again<br/>
as soon as I get used to it :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197517451">Sometimes my kids want structure and other times they don&#39;t.  Lately we&#39;ve been making &quot;Smile Lists&quot; (just a catchy name that we made up) in the morning while we eat breakfast because my oldest has had a hard time understanding that he can do most of what he wants within a day.  I make a list of what each of us wants to do that day and then we discuss how we can fit it in.  If we don&#39;t get to something that day, we add it on a later date.<br/>
