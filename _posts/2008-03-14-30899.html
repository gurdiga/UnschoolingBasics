<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413375055">OK, I ordered Rue Kream&#39;s book, read it and packed it for my husband<br/>
(who only reads when he&#39;s TDY) after he read 40 pages we had a less<br/>
than pleasant discussion over the phone about it.  I wasn&#39;t happy, he<br/>
wasn&#39;t happy.<br/>
<br/>
Then two days later he had finished the book and said &quot;Well, I can&#39;t<br/>
say that I agree with the whole book, but I want you to help me do<br/>
better for the kids.&quot;  This is HUGE for him.  HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to figure out how to help him repair his chaotic upbringing<br/>
by raising our kids more gently.  All the while trying to do the same<br/>
for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you list.  Thank you Rue.  Thank you Dagny and Rowan.  It was<br/>
their Q&A at the end that pushed him over to see this as valid and the<br/>
right path.  He&#39;s military so being told what to do, and telling<br/>
people what to do...Service before Self...it&#39;s so a part of him.  Then<br/>
the violence in his childhood.  Oh my...this is HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27582040">Karen - You&#39;re very welcome.  That&#39;s really exciting :o). You guys<br/>
should try to get to one of the conferences.  There&#39;s nothing quite like<br/>
meeting and talking to unschooled kids and seeing how they relate to<br/>
their families.<br/>

<br/>
It is WAY too much to expect most people to read Rue&#39;s book and just  <br/>
flip the switch and agree with all of it. Nice when it happens, but  <br/>
people have to be ready to really get it. And, mostly, that readiness  <br/>
comes from experimentation. (It also often comes from meeting, in  <br/>
person, other families who have older kids raised as Rue describes.)<br/>
<br/>
So, if he&#39;s inspired to do better, go easy, pick something to focus on  <br/>
that will provide a big payoff in terms of kid-happiness.<br/>
<br/>
That is SO cool!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for this comment, Pam. i am having trouble getting my head  <br/>
around the candy and teeth freedoms, tho ibtellectually I get it as  <br/>
part of the continuum. I&#39;ve been reading about unschooling for about  <br/>
2 years now, but 8 mos ago put my older daughter in preschool -- she  <br/>
said she was lonely for more kids, my mom & spouse were concerned I&#39;d  <br/>
get ppd -- then my second daughter was born late in the summer, and  <br/>
we had some health scares, both she & I -- all resolved, I am  <br/>
grateful to say -- anyway the winter&#39;s been intense and my temper and  <br/>
old childhood hurts/angers have been hard to work with at times -- <br/>
that and school have been hard for my older girl....all of which is  <br/>
just to say I feel humbled by all you experienced unschoolers, and  <br/>
feel a novice, and it&#39;s also a great feeling....I already feel  <br/>
healing and growth in our family, and what&#39;s more my husband does too  <br/>
-- so I am really hopiong to convince us all to skip kindergarten  <br/>
come August.<br/>
<br/>
I will be here on list, listening gratefully---<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where in California? You could hang out at a mostly-unschoolish kind  <br/>
of homeschool group. The groups I&#39;ve been involved with were very  <br/>
happy to have families with kids younger than school age - that&#39;s a  <br/>
way for your daughter to hook up with homeschooled friends - and  <br/>
eventually she won&#39;t want to go to school and have to miss out on the  <br/>
fun. Also, there is the HSC conference in Sacramento - homeschoolers  <br/>
from all over the state go. There are lots of unschoolers there, even  <br/>
though there are lots of other kinds of homeschoolers there, too. Or,  <br/>
take a trip and go to the Life is Good Conference up in Oregon/ <br/>
Washington. Going to a radical unschooling conference will jump start  <br/>
your progress.<br/>

Right now I wonder if we need time together to regroup.....<br/>
I would love to convince my husband to go to the Life is Good conference, but I also just quit <br/>
my job and our car isn&#39;t being reliable, etc.....<br/>
But Sacramento would be doable, by train and we could stay with my sister!<br/>
When is that conference?<br/>
