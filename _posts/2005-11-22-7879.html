<div id="ygrps-yiv-127432359">I&#39;ve posted the conference version, but could NOT find the original <br/>
of this &quot;test&quot; I&#39;ve used at various talks.<br/>
<br/>
Finally found it last night...the joys of moving eh?<br/>
<br/>
1) List all the ways you&#39;ve earned an income in your life:<br/>
   (include side jobs and career paths)<br/>
<br/>
2) List some hobbies you pursue in your leisure time:<br/>
<br/>
3)What are driving passions and interests that make life meaningful <br/>
and fulfilling for you? <br/>
<br/>
4)List ALL the interests you would like to pursue or learn about <br/>
before you die?<br/>
<br/>
5)What would you be doing right now if there were NO obstacles in <br/>
your path?  (dream big)<br/>
<br/>
After the participants fill this out, I have them tally up all the <br/>
items listed. THEN, have them go back through the list and tally up <br/>
how many of those items they got proficient at, by attending school, <br/>
or COULD have gotten proficient at by attending school (through 12th <br/>
grade, not counting college or any post high-school since that isn&#39;t <br/>
compulsory).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a variety of answers, but it does get people thinking <br/>
about how meaningful the learning is that happens outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Some other questions I added, but only did verbally;<br/>
<br/>
How many of you have one or more degrees?<br/>
Of the people that have degrees, how many of you are actually using <br/>
that degree in your work today?<br/>
If you are using your degree today, do you really LOVE your work?Are <br/>
you passionate about what you do?<br/>
<br/>
This might be a good &quot;quiz&quot; for those reluctant partners. If they&#39;re <br/>
willing to play around with it, it could get them thinking about the <br/>
ways that humans really learn in a meaningful way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99199761">Thanks Ren!   I was one of the ones looking for input in Oct as I was <br/>
speaking at my first homeschool info night with the local group I <br/>
joined (we only had one couple, but I got to meet some other members <br/>
of the group, we had good conversations!)<br/>
