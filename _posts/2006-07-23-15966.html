<div id="ygrps-yiv-559516786">I&#39;ve posted here about our son, Andrew-14, before but haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
any responses.   I have just kept reading here and trudging <br/>
forward.  Things have improved, but we are still at a tough spot.<br/>
<br/>
The only way I know how to word it is that he is really mean and <br/>
rude.  This is especially with me and our younger son, Adrian-12.  I <br/>
should mention that Andrew has been a struggling public school <br/>
student his entire life.  He just came home in April.  Adrian is a <br/>
veteran unschooler by now...he did do a little time though.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when I posted before I could not think of a specific example <br/>
of Andrew&#39;s &quot;undesirable&quot; behavior.  I have one from tonight.  I did <br/>
handle it WAY better than I would have in the past, but I&#39;m still <br/>
not feeling that I was *effective*.  Maybe you all can shine a light <br/>
for me.  I would really appreciate it.  Here&#39;s the play by play:<br/>
<br/>
Pat, dh, myself and Adrian were watching a stand-up comic on <br/>
television in the front room.  Andrew was in my bedroom on the <br/>
computer just off the front room.  (My bedroom door is right next to <br/>
the television)  He heard us laughing and came out to see what was <br/>
so funny.  This means he was standing right in front of the <br/>
television, but was not in mine or Pat&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian had gotten up to go into the kitchen because he was making <br/>
himself some alfredo pasta on the stove.  When his food was done he <br/>
came back and sat down on the love seat.  Andrew was now in his line <br/>
of vision.  Adrian said, &quot;Excuse me, Andrew.&quot;  Plain and simple and <br/>
kind.  No nasty inflection or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew got outwardly irritated and said, &quot;Why would you sit there if <br/>
you can&#39;t see?&quot;  I carefully pointed out that Adrian asked him <br/>
politely and was not being rude to him.  He said, &quot;excuse me&quot; nicely <br/>
and all.  Andrew continued, &quot;It was rude of him to even ask me to <br/>
move.&quot;  I calmly pointed out that when someone asks you to do <br/>
something reasonable and they are polite that there is nothing wrong <br/>
with that.  He insisted that Adrian was rude for even asking and <br/>
that he, Andrew, was right in his behavior.  I let it drop.<br/>
<br/>
My issue is this...he acts like this very regularly and literally <br/>
thinks that this type behavior is appropriate and acceptable, even <br/>
if I try to talk with him about it.  Honestly, it is REALLY getting <br/>
old and exhausting.  <br/>
<br/>
Why is he being so nasty?<br/>
<br/>
How should I help him through this? <br/>
<br/>
What should I do/not do in these situations?<br/>
<br/>
I really suck at thinking on my feet.  Any input on this type of <br/>
situation would be SO appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529317839">Hi Tina, <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m no expert on 14 yo&#39;s, but this sounds something like what our 9yo ds was doing about which I posted.  I found that what worked best and most often for me was an adaptation of _How to talk so kids really listen and listen so kids will talk_.  First, name the feeling.  &quot;You sound angry.&quot;.  Then say nothing.  Hopefully, Andrew will tell you more.  If not, wait a reasonable amoutn of time and try again.  As he speaks, be sure to listen.  Use &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;I see&quot;, and &quot;hmm&quot; as he speaks.  These convey that you are listening but does not convey agreement.  When Andrew is finished speaking, you might choose to paraphase what he said, &quot;So you&#39;re saying that...&quot;.  That may cue him to tell you more, to complete a thought.  <br/>
   <br/>
  When I used this I found that I unearthed something that I might not have gotten if I didn&#39;t use it and/or it helped my diffuse my son.    <br/>
<br/>
  I give you credit for pointing out that the request was reasonable, etc.  Who says you can&#39;t think on the fly??  <br/>
   <br/>
  Is there ever a time when Andrew does this when you can talk to him about it?  Maybe tomorrow, a few days later?  I also found that if I left it alone and tried again at a later time, I got some of the answers I needed.  <br/>
   <br/>
  HTH some!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For how ever many years he was in school he heard or it was implied  <br/>
by all the adults around him &quot;Go to school. Do your homework. Sit  <br/>
down. Pay attention. Stop talking. Be hungry when we&#39;ve scheduled you  <br/>
to eat. ...&quot; And all the adults thought that was appropriate and  <br/>
acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s angry and he&#39;s hurting. People who&#39;ve been hurt often want to  <br/>
hurt others. He&#39;s been pushed around. People who are pushed around  <br/>
can learn to push back. It&#39;s one of the reasons parents push their  <br/>
kids around. They were pushed around their whole lives and now it&#39;s  <br/>
finally their turn to do the pushing :-/<br/>
<br/>
Right now he&#39;s depressurizing -- like the bends! -- from the control.  <br/>
The best present you could give yourself is &quot;Parent/Teen  <br/>
Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach&quot; by Myra Kirshenbaum (along  <br/>
with How to Talk, which doesn&#39;t totally jive with mindful parenting  <br/>
but is *very* helpful).<br/>
