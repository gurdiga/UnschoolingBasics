<div id="ygrps-yiv-271558787">Hi Barb,<br/>
Yes, we need a certified teacher to fill out the form. We&#39;re in West  <br/>
Virginia. The form says that the teacher has reviewed a sample of the child&#39;s  work <br/>
and they are working to their ability. I would appreciate any help. Thank  you.<br/>
