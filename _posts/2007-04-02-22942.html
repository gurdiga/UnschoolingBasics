<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130992194">Thank you for all the posts about this issue.  I am not so much  <br/>
thinking that I want Paige to understand time (because I know it&#39;s a  <br/>
concept that only comes when it comes - although I love the ideas  <br/>
that you all gave (giving a watch, talking about other timed events  <br/>
in relationship to what we are doing, not anticipating what she is  <br/>
afraid of and answering questions more generally - these will all  <br/>
help!)), but that I can see that the fears that one child has greatly  <br/>
impacts what the other child can/can not do at that moment in time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to talk to them (at calm moments) about fears in  <br/>
general, and about how each person fears something different, and  <br/>
that all fears are important and that we can help people when they  <br/>
have them.<br/>
<br/>
But my girls&#39; fears are very intense (for Tess it&#39;s part of her TS,  <br/>
for Paige it&#39;s reminding me of how Tess&#39;s TS started), that when they  <br/>
crop up, we usually have no option other than to leave somewhere (a  <br/>
park that Paige is having fun at because Tess sees a bee, a concert  <br/>
that Tess wants to hang around at the end of (to see the singer in  <br/>
the lobby) but can&#39;t because Paige HAS to get out of the theatre  <br/>
before it &quot;closes&quot;).  So then each one feels resentful of the other  <br/>
when this happens.  I try to help with problem solving when it  <br/>
happens, but I think we all feel overwhelmed (including me, because I  <br/>
can so easily go into &quot;project into the future&quot; mode and react as if  <br/>
they will never be able to leave the house in their lives!).<br/>

  My daughter also has TS (amoung other things).  Do you think your daughter has some type of Anxiety Disorder?  So many of these disorders run in families or have co-mingling conditions.  <br/>
