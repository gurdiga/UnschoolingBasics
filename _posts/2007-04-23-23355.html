  &quot;The good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.&quot; -Lao Tzu <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brenda hosts:<br/>
  Re-Inventing the American Dream: Learning to Live with Less<br/>
  Brenda will inspire/assist those willing in de-cluttering their lives of excessive material possessions, reconnecting with the dream we wish we were living, reforming our attitudes towards wilderness and wildlife, aligning our spiritual beliefs with the manner in which we walk in the world, and focusing on personal action that will lead to a healthier planet and unencumbered, debt free lives.<br/>
<br/>
                    JOIN US!<br/>
  <br/>
  Join hundreds of unschooling families from around the globe as we rethink the meanings of education, learning and parenting. Rethinking Education supports attachment parenting, unconditional love, support for each person&#39;s unique journey of life experience, freedom with responsibility, unschooling and you. YOU are the vital ingredient at this conference, as we come together and revel in the magic and mystery of kindred spirits and each other&#39;s rich diversity, as we challenge ourselves to trust the extraordinary process of living and learning, the wondrous ability to improve the ways we communicate, discovering new ways of listening to one another, giving full support to our dreams, no matter how wild or ordinary, large or small.<br/>
  Unschooling is vital to the profoundly intelligent development of our children. And yes, as adults we can even unschool ourselves... as you will discover.<br/>

                    MORE 2007 Highlights: JANEEN NICHOLAS<br/>
  <br/>
   Janeen Nicholas is a former career woman with two M.A. degrees in her past life, and is now a happy unschooling mom to one lively kindergartener, and life-long learner herself. After one career in education (teaching and being the special education director for a public school system), and another career in software design, and a third in six sigma consulting, I have come full-circle, educating my own child at home. She lives in the Dallas/Fort Worth area with her husband, daughter, dog, and fish. Active in my local homeschooling community, and currently the coordinator of Spirit Play programming in my UU (Unitarian Universalist) church, she regularly leads Spirit Play classes for young children. Janeen bakes all her own bread with wheat that she grinds herself, loves plays and roller coasters, and enjoys being able to travel to wonderful places as a family while the rest of the world is in school.<br/>
  Janeen will host:<br/>
  Child-Centered Spirituality: When Kids Ask the Big Questions<br/>
  Explore how to become the facilitator in the process your child goes through in thinking about their own unique spiritual path, as differentiated from the traditional model of telling children what they should believe. Janeen will focus on introducing children to many different spiritual ideologies geared just for their young ages, and then prompt them to wonder about those ideas and continue a thoughtful inquiry. This session is particularly suited to parents and their children aged 3-8, but all ages are welcome. Janeen&#39;s guidance is directed toward parents, and one or more stories will be told to the children as examples. Stories will be drawn from the Unitarian Universalist Spirit Play Stories from the following list: The Wise People and the Elephant (Traditional Buddhist Parable) Hide and Seek with God by Mary Ann Moore (Many Paths/UU) Small Fry by Ruthilde Kronberg & Patricia C. McKissack (Secular Humanist) Day of the Dead by Tony Johnston (Mexican traditional<br/>
 celebration) The Empty Pot by Demi (Chinese folk tale) The Mountains of Tibet by Mordicai Gerstein (Hindu)<br/>
  Child-Centered Spiritual Journeys<br/>
  Throughout the weekend in short, 15 minute periods, Janeen will invite children to listen to thought-provoking stories of a spiritual nature and to explore them in their own ways. Stories are presented in the style shown in the Child Centered Spirituality session, in which children are encouraged to explore their own spiritual uniqueness, as differentiated from the more traditional model of telling children what to believe. The stories will be drawn from a variety of faiths, including Theist, Buddhist, Hindu, and Humanist, each with many possible interpretations. Each short session will include the presentation of one story, followed by encouragement of the children to process the ideas presented and to draw their own conclusions. Geared for ages 3-8, but all ages are welcome.<br/>
