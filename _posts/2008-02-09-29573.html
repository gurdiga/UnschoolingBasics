<div id="ygrps-yiv-404214213">Are there any larger families on this list? and how are you working out the daily walk of being an active facilitating mom to a large group. Handing out the work assignments to everyone sitting around the living or dining room is a lot different than trying to always be available for what 8 or 10 different people want to do or explore at any given time....<br/>
Help! I think I am finally ready to change but I am not sure where to start? or not start?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547746733">Well, I don&#39;t have 12, but I do have seven.<br/>
I don&#39;t really know how I work it out, mostly lots of caffeine, a  <br/>
nightly two mile walk and yoga (to regain my sanity) My oldest is 13,  <br/>
and we have a 10yo, 9yo, 7yo, 6yo, 4yo, and 2yo, so it&#39;s pretty  <br/>
hopping most of the day, but really not that bad. The older kids  <br/>
mostly direct themselves, and I hang out with the two youngest, and  <br/>
do a round robin check on everyone every half hour or so (with  <br/>
whatever  tasks need done) I can usually sit for some amount of time  <br/>
with everyone, and usually in the afternoons I can spend an hour or  <br/>
two with one set. But all of our kids really like to hang out  <br/>
together, so it&#39;s not really too hard. And they are pretty  <br/>
understanding if I say that So-n-so needs this RIGHT now, and I can  <br/>
help them in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
It just takes a lot of practice....we&#39;re heading into our third year,  <br/>
and I have good days and not-so-good days with my coping. I am a  <br/>
solitary person by nature...need my quiet and such lol! Ironic, huh?<br/>
