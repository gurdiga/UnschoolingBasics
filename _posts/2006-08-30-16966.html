<div id="ygrps-yiv-310945039">Just wanted to share what my oldest has been working on recently.  I<br/>
am just so proud of her accomplishment!  I&#39;m amazed by her artistic<br/>

<br/>
That was totally amazing.  Me and my kids just loved<br/>
it.  I told them that a child being homeschooled did<br/>
this, and they were in awe.  What a fantastic job your<br/>
daughter did.  She should be really proud of herself,<br/>
as I can tell how proud you are of her.  Just out of<br/>
curiousity, how old is she?  (my kids wanted to know.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that with us.<br/>

(she uses Windows Movie Maker) it&#39;s the artistic putting it all<br/>
together that amazes me.  How she can look at these different clips<br/>
and visual the different parts of the music working together.  Slowing<br/>
things down or speeding them up to work right.<br/>
<br/>
Yes; I am very proud of her accomplisments.  But I&#39;m mostly proud of<br/>
the self confidence she has gained in herself at having figured it out<br/>
and made it so pleasing to herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339313328">I loved it.  After viewing it I commented (my moniker is &quot;pleez&quot;) about the<br/>
pace, the way it moved to the music, I loved her choices.  Then I got lost<br/>
on the<br/>
site - trying to get back to hers, but accidently viewing OTHER clips of the<br/>
same song, before finally going back to the digest/email from you to find<br/>
the<br/>
link to her video and got me back to the start point.  I was glad that I got<br/>
to see a few other attempts to put the song to video<br/>
because it gave me something to compare to (beyond my initial reaction of<br/>
liking it).  Hers was sooo much better than the ones I saw.  She clearly has<br/>
an eye and ear for this.  And - just wanted to mention that I loved her<br/>
sensitivity<br/>
to the emotions in the piece, the shots she chose really communicated the<br/>
feelings, along with the rest of the story.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, my thoughts also. I meant to comment on Emily&#39;s fine job with her<br/>
use of Evanescence music with the Kingdom Hearts graphics, but forgot!<br/>
Tell her it was really fun to watch (and we&#39;re pretty picky about our<br/>
gaming videos).<br/>
<br/>
Has she watched the Kingdom Hearts II &quot;Hamster Dance&quot; video yet?  We<br/>
play that all the time around here...cracks me up every time.<br/>
We&#39;re big Evanescence fans, so I dig her choice of music!<br/>
