<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695376978">Hello all<br/>
<br/>
We just began unschooling this year and have some questions regarding end of the year portfolio workings.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that we are bit late on getting this reviewed but we have been keeping a journel of sorts throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
We are in Ohio.  Are there other families in Ohio that prefer the portfolio vs the standardized tests?  (Bleh to standardized testing, IMHO) So what resources do you use?  Is there a specific site that is helpful?  Do you have the same reviewer each year?  Do you recommend a different reviewer for a high school student?  (My daughter is a sophmore.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anything else that I should be asking?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a whole bunch of flowers!<br/>

this is Sandra Dodd&#39;s list of US unschooling lists and resources. There are<br/>
two for Ohio.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154414204">Hi Lynette,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Ohio and rely on the portfolio method.  We prefer it as it&#39;s a<br/>
more comprehensive look at what the kids are doing<br/>
and what their skills are.  Although we&#39;ve already had ours reviewed - I<br/>
don&#39;t think you are late in the game - the assessment<br/>
forms don&#39;t need to be turned in until the beginning of your districts<br/>
school year.  Now I particularly enjoy the portfolio<br/>
as it is a way for me to stave off the &quot;are we doing enough&quot; momma<br/>
bologna that happens from time to time.  I found our<br/>
reviewer via a local yahoo home school group.  We love working with our<br/>
reviewer and plan to do so for as long as she is available.<br/>
The whole process is stress free.  I can&#39;t imagine why you would need to<br/>
have a different reviewer for higher grades unless<br/>
you felt that you needed some guidance.  In which case, I would just<br/>
find other families with kids of a similar age and ask<br/>
them what they do or how they work out various issues....  You can find<br/>
some info on reviewers here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homescdhool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homescdhool/</a>&gt;    in their files<br/>
section is an area for notification and assessment options - they<br/>
have a list you can work from of certified teachers.  Or speak with<br/>
other homeschoolers/unschoolers in your area.  My best<br/>
advice is to find a reviewer that jives with you and your philosophy and<br/>
ask them what they like to see - since its your first<br/>
year with a portfolio, most folks will be flexible.  Our portfolio is a<br/>
journal that shows what they were doing in the<br/>
beginning, middle, and end of the year.  We have some photos (okay a<br/>
lot).  I also include samples of stuff they worked<br/>
on - typically something that is representative of their writing ability<br/>
and a list of books they&#39;ve read.  I also slap<br/>
all of this online so the extended family (and ex-spouse) can see what<br/>
we&#39;ve been up to and so I don&#39;t have to carry around<br/>
bag/boxes when we go to meet the reviewer -I just send her this year&#39;s<br/>
link - then we meet to talk, she signs papers<br/>
(which she provides) and I give her cash for her time ($50 for two<br/>
kids).  Voila!  I provide more than some people and<br/>
probably less than others, but I like it how we do it.  I figure by the<br/>
time the kids reach college age (and if they pursue<br/>
college) - we&#39;ll have a substantial amount of information to provide in<br/>
lieu of (or in conjunction with) a transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
