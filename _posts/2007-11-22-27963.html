<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567283787">How in the world do I change my ways from rules-driven to principle-driven?<br/>
I came from a family drowning in rules and my husband came from a house with<br/>
basically no rules, but no supervision either, so for the last 5 years we&#39;ve<br/>
raised our children on what we thought were good principles, but I am<br/>
finding out, as I am learning more and more about unschooling, that it&#39;s all<br/>
RULES we have hundreds of them~!<br/>
<br/>
Do I ask my kids what they think is important at 5, 3 1/2, and 16 months?<br/>
Do my husband and I sit down and decide what&#39;s best for the family and then<br/>
approach the children with it?<br/>
<br/>
When someone breaks one of the principles, how do you discipline?  I know<br/>
that&#39;s not the right wording, but for my rule bound mind right now, it&#39;s all<br/>
I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
I want to dive straight into unschooling. I don&#39;t want to send my kiddos to<br/>
public school and I don&#39;t want to just school at home.  I thought  I was<br/>
going along just fine, until tonight when I am sitting here reading about<br/>
principles versus rules.  Sheesh I feel like a complete failure~!<br/>
<br/>
How do we restart fresh?<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t. They&#39;re really little.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d just start living by principles. If my children asked what&#39;s up, <br/>
I&#39;d try to explain it as simply as possible.<br/>

You can&#39;t break principles.<br/>

You can just keep striving *for* them.<br/>

Tell us some rules, and we can suggest some principles to take their <br/>

Then it&#39;ll just be about putting the principles into practice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t break principles. You live them or not live them.<br/>
<br/>
Principles aren&#39;t something you impose on someone. They&#39;re the parts  <br/>
of a philosophy that help you decide if an action is in keeping with  <br/>
your own personal philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re having a hard time figuring this out because you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
change your kids to make them behave differently. Use your own  <br/>
principles to help them navigate the world. Help them get what they  <br/>
want in ways that don&#39;t hurt someone. It *is* what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>
do. They *don&#39;t* want to hurt someone. But when humans have a need  <br/>
and can&#39;t figure out more principled ways of meeting it, humans often  <br/>
start tossing out the principles. Even the most peaceful mom is  <br/>
likely to kill someone to protect her kids if she&#39;s backed into a  <br/>
corner and can&#39;t figure another way.<br/>
<br/>
Help you kids not feel backed into corner. Give them escape route.  <br/>
Give them the confidence that you will help them.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the biggest problems with rules is they&#39;re used as  <br/>
substitutes for being there. It&#39;s like the parents are handing the  <br/>
child a bit of themselves and telling the child to obey it. It&#39;s like  <br/>
remote control parenting.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a substitute for being there. A great deal of  <br/>
conventional parenting is reactive: responding to problems. Mindful  <br/>
parenting is about being aware of our kids and their needs and  <br/>
responding before things escalate. (We can&#39;t be perfect but we can be  <br/>
better!)<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us some examples of problems? It&#39;s a lot easier to  <br/>
explain with real life examples.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t. Life doesn&#39;t work that way. You do better today if you know better and be happy you even got that far. Most people don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Millions of words have been written about unschooling but you still have to feel your way, do your best, think, try again, etc. Lay down the guilt about not being perfect or spouting all the right things and enjoy!<br/>

-Wow.  That whole explanation was absolutely mind blowing for me.  I had<br/>
never thought of rules as remote controlled parenting.  I really do try to<br/>
be proactive giving each of the kids what they need or want, attention,<br/>
space, creative outlets, puzzles, games, on and on.  It&#39;s actually quite<br/>
exhausting.  lol.<br/>
<br/>

Honestly the times that we(my DH and I)  are having a hard time with are<br/>
running in the house, jumping on the bed, and bedtimes.<br/>

<br/>
There are many things that can be used to &quot;buffer&quot; sharp corners. How <br/>
often have they run into corners or fallen on toys? How painful is <br/>
that? Would they be willing to keep a pathway to run safely?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We have a park across the street and we go there almost everyday for <br/>
running<br/>
and jumping purposes.  We have been in a constant dialog with them <br/>
about the<br/>
safety of the house and how it&#39;s different from the old house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The park is great---it&#39;s good to have that option.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re having a &quot;constant dialogue&quot; that&#39;s not working, it&#39;s time to <br/>
try something different.<br/>
<br/>
Kids run---it&#39;s just one of the ways they get around.<br/>
<br/>
The only *rule* we have here is no running around the pool. The pool <br/>
deck is made of brick---old ones. Some are missing (actual *holes*), <br/>
and most are uneven, at best. We also had to dig up two long areas to <br/>
replumb the pool last spring, so there are these long holes. We haven&#39;t <br/>
put a new deck in yet---it&#39;s on &quot;The List.&quot; &lt;g&gt; It freaks me out to <br/>
have folks run---I just *know* I&#39;ll be cleaning up blood one day soon! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; But I explain to guests that it really bothers me---and why! I <br/>
usually have to ask them to walk several times &#39;cause it&#39;s not *normal* <br/>
for a child to *walk* anywhere! Most kids know that&#39;s the only thing I <br/>
freak about, so they tend to try to work with me on this. &lt;g&gt; A soon as <br/>
we have a new deck poured, I&#39;ll relax about it.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s a *huge* safety issue here. It follows our Safety <br/>
principle---and mine never run around the pool! It&#39;s just others I have <br/>
to worry about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Think about it this way: You and and a friend are arguing over  <br/>
something and you&#39;re both pretty mad. A woman comes by and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
like the way you&#39;re arguing so she swoops in and tells you apologize  <br/>
to each other and tells you that what you said made your friend  <br/>
angry. So instead of yelling, she tells you to practice saying what  <br/>
you have to say nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help you and your friend resolve your problem?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you be kinda pissed that some know-it-all came in and took  <br/>
over, turning it into her agenda and pushing yours aside?<br/>
<br/>
Basically what it is is some woman coming in turning your argument  <br/>
into her personal vendetta against your style of argument, trying to  <br/>
get you to conform to her standards.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t turn their argument into your problem with how their handling  <br/>
it. Help them with *their* problem.<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;No hitting. How can I help?&quot; If they&#39;re too emotional,  <br/>
call the one that was losing aside and have them tell you what  <br/>
happened and help him figure out something better. But read at  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s pages. She explains it much better since she had 3  <br/>
passionate kids :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49967677">&quot;There are many things that can be used to &quot;buffer&quot; sharp corners. How<br/>
often have they run into corners or fallen on toys? How painful is<br/>
that? Would they be willing to keep a pathway to run safely?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the thing when they run in our new house they get hurt almost every<br/>
time.  Each time I see them run especially since there is 3 of them  (or<br/>
jump or whatever) I cringe~!  I try to remind them about safety and how<br/>
different this house is to our old house.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re having a &quot;constant dialogue&quot; that&#39;s not working, it&#39;s time to<br/>
try something different.<br/>
<br/>
Kids run---it&#39;s just one of the ways they get around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Should I start suggesting if they want to run that we should go outside and<br/>
run?  I know they are kids and they are going to run, I am just so afraid of<br/>
20 stitches going into any of their heads~! (or any other part of their<br/>
bodies)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better way to get a 3 year old to understand?<br/>

<br/>
Well for example if one of my children decided to hit the other, what <br/>
do you<br/>
do at that point?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to be there *before* it escalates to hitting. Help them find other <br/>
ways to communicate. Help find ways to meet their needs before the <br/>
frustration sets in.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll take a while for them to catch on, but if you&#39;re consistently <br/>
there and helping them *through* things, they&#39;ll figure out how to work <br/>
together. They need help though!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Go and talk to them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, ideally you&#39;re there talking with them *before*!<br/>
<br/>
But apologizing for not being available when they needed you is a start.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask what happened and give them<br/>
feeling words to explain how they felt?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re there as things start to break down, you can talk about how <br/>
they *feel* not how they *felt* after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Basically now, I ask them to apologize for hitting,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think they&#39;re truly sorry for what they did? Or do you think <br/>
they feel they got revenge?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 but tell the other person that when they take their<br/>
toy (for example) that makes them very sad and angry.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think they know that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Then I ask the other<br/>

get a<br/>
dialogue going, between them.  Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really about doing all that BEFORE it escalates. Help them to <br/>
dialogue before it becomes and issue. Not when they&#39;re angry and <br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>

 find out how I could be different today~!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s so sweet! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;m glad you&#39;re working so hard!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As far as our rules go,<br/>
<br/>
a couple we are really having a hard time with are:<br/>
<br/>
1)no running in the house, and<br/>
2) no jumping on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just start with those.<br/>

Can you tell us why you have these rules?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my kids were younger and would get into big fights, I found<br/>
that many times?there wasn&#39;t a toy or something in there that they<br/>
really wanted, and decided that perhaps what they were really wanting<br/>
was *me.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figured this out after a few times of talking to them separately<br/>
and letting them tell me in great detail what happened, with me asking<br/>
things like &quot;Well, what happened before that?&quot; and &quot;What?was it that<br/>
made you want to do that?&quot;?but without making any judgments.? Then I&#39;d<br/>
go back to the other and say &quot;He said you did this.? Is that what<br/>
happened?? And if so, &quot;Did he do something else before that?&quot;?and go<br/>
back and forth as many times as necessary.? ?And I&#39;d go into it<br/>
considering the possibility that both kids contributed<br/>
*something*?to?the conflict, and that both were doing their best and<br/>
neither were really all that happy about the way things worked out.?<br/>
But the idea would be just to get the story and let each kid completely<br/>
explain their side of it, not for the purpose of deciding who&#39;s fault<br/>
it was.??And I&#39;d let them know that.? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And only *after* letting each kid have their complete say, would I<br/>
start suggesting that things could&#39;ve been done differently<br/>
to?help?each of them get a better outcome.? At that point they were<br/>
*much* more willing to listen to my point of view, hear about anybody<br/>
else&#39;s feelings and consider suggestions for doing things differently<br/>
next time.? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what was interesting is that it was often things like &quot;He made<br/>
a stupid face at me&quot; and &quot;She pushed me&quot; and &quot;Yeah, but not that hard&quot;<br/>
and it just escalated from there.? So when I&#39;d get through it all, I<br/>
might say &quot;Is it that?you guys bored?&quot; and suggest I play a game with<br/>
them, or offer to do something fun with each of them separately, and<br/>
everything would be fine.? So it really, really helped when I made<br/>
an?effort to make myself more available, often just by choosing to?be<br/>
in the same room with them more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another little thing is that I&#39;d try to use the word &quot;what&quot;<br/>
instead of &quot;why&quot; when I asked them about their behavior.? I read it<br/>
somewhere a while back and have used it ever since.??I&#39;ve found that?it<br/>
sounds less accusatory and most people respond better to it.? So &quot;What<br/>
was it that made you want to do that?&quot; tends to go over?better than<br/>
&quot;Why&#39;d you do that?&quot;? <br/>

issue and are trying to &quot;get&quot; the kids to agree (and calling <br/>
that &quot;understanding&quot;). We&#39;re saying Wait a sec, Mom! Why is *that* <br/>

to stop running and jumping&quot; but &quot;hey, I don&#39;t like it when y&#39;all <br/>
get hurt - any ideas to change this?&quot; And see what comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you&#39;re kids aren&#39;t used to this kind of dialog and/or aren&#39;t <br/>
very verbal, you might not get much response the first time. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean your kids can&#39;t do it - all y&#39;all just need some <br/>
practice problem solving together. So you may still need to find <br/>
some other options on your own. <br/>
<br/>
Besides padding the corners, can you rearrange any of the furniture <br/>
so there is at least one &quot;runway&quot;? I know, it sounds kind of <br/>
whacked, but its *a* way to solve the problem (possibly). If not a <br/>
runway, is there a place they can run in circles? Can the bed be <br/>
move? Is there another piece of furniture they *can* jump on that <br/>
you can offer? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; run?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good idea, too. One thing to keep in mind is that whatever <br/>
solution y&#39;all come up with it may take lots and lots of reminders. <br/>
They&#39;re not trying to drive you crazy, they&#39;re kids and forget <br/>
things, especially new patterns of behavior. So remember to *remind* <br/>
them, not snap at them. Oh, I&#39;m going to repeat that one bit for <br/>
emphasis:<br/>
<br/>
They are not trying to drive you crazy. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I forget that about my kids, so if you&#39;re anything like <br/>
me, you might want to write yourself a note ;)<br/>

<br/>
Going to the park is nice but since kids, and other people, don&#39;t have set times during the day when they need to move freely, that doesn&#39;t actually solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
How about talking to the kids and admitting that this seemed like it would work but obviously it&#39;s just more hassle than it&#39;s worth. That some or all of this big furniture has to go and will go and they can help find replacement furniture, as budgets allow, and things may not look so pretty for a while as sharp corners are covered with foam/whatever and toys will be put in a better place and they can help figure out where that better place will be and could they please help you and all of them get settled into your new home.<br/>

-It does have to do with safety. We moved from a larger house to a smaller<br/>
house and still have the large furniture that we purchased long ago. It&#39;s<br/>
really tight just to walk through, let alone run.<br/>
<br/>
The kids room has a wall furnace that has sharp edges and many other toys<br/>
that they could fall on top of.<br/>

We have a park across the street and we go there almost everyday for running<br/>

Thanks Nance.  We&#39;ve actually talked about replacing the furniture, we just<br/>
have to wait until tax return time.  Maybe we can just replace the big couch<br/>
at christmas time and then do the rest later.  I&#39;ll have to talk to DH about<br/>
that.<br/>

I totally agree with this and am trying my best.  The last 2 days have been<br/>
really awesome.<br/>
<br/>
But apologizing for not being available when they needed you is a start.<br/>
I am just learning that it&#39;s okay to admit when I am wrong as a parent, and<br/>
apologize to my kids.  I never had that as a child and still don&#39;t have that<br/>
as an adult (referring to my relationship with my parents)<br/>
<br/>
As far as our rules go,<br/>
<br/>
a couple we are really having a hard time with are:<br/>

1)no running in the house, and<br/>
2) no jumping on the bed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Can you tell us why you have these rules?<br/>
<br/>
I think we already address this part, and I am now understanding many<br/>
different ways to address it.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I popped in a tae bo video and then we watched some disney show<br/>
that was about dancing bunnies and I let them (trying not to grimmace, and<br/>
smiling and laughing the whole while) dance and spin and play with the<br/>
music.  I just sat the couch cushons around and made sure that the baby<br/>
didn&#39;t get to wild.  lol. We really had fun.  It&#39;s been a while since I<br/>
watched cartoons with the kids; so I was surprised how much I laughed. :P<br/>

Will they run into something that could break? Can you move those <br/>
items? Why are they running in the house? Chasing each other? <br/>
wanting something fast? <br/>
<br/>
Bed jumping is a fave in our house as is jumping on the couch and <br/>
off the table and stools to the floor but we make landing pads out <br/>
of pillows nad blankets to make softer landings and to make it <br/>
quieter to the neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
Will your beds break from jumping on? Is there a bed that would hold <br/>
up better and that be the jumping bed?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106427898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; couple we are really having a hard time with are:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;1)no running in the house, and<br/>
&gt;2) no jumping on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Find times/places where they CAN run, and CAN jump - they are needing<br/>
these physical outlets and if they can&#39;t get them one way, they&#39;ll get<br/>
them another. For us, we&#39;ve got a third hand couch and loveseat in the<br/>
living room, large sturdy bookshelves and entertainment center along the<br/>
walls (nothing small or light enough to tip easily) and that&#39;s it - lots<br/>
of space in the middle of the room (no end tables or coffee table or<br/>
anything like that - we have some small stackable plastic tables that<br/>
can be moved out of the way as needed - most breakables are up high<br/>
enough to be safe OR put away and only come out on limited occasions).<br/>
The way we figure it, another 10 years and DS will be grown (he&#39;s 9 now)<br/>
and not needing to bounce on the couch. Then, we&#39;ll get the nice<br/>
furniture and all. Just when the nice new furniture is starting to be<br/>
&quot;old&quot; in 5 or 10 years from then (15-20 years from now), the grandkids<br/>
will come along and the furniture will be in just the right state of<br/>
&quot;oldness&quot; for them to relax on and bounce. One of DS&#39;s favorite things<br/>
is flipping up and over the loveseat when it&#39;s away from the walls<br/>
(perpendicular and out in the room when we&#39;ve got the Christmas tree up<br/>
- after a while, though, he wants the open space back so we move it back<br/>
out of the way once the tree is away). Nephew (he&#39;s 4 now) wanted to do<br/>
it too - but he was too small to manage it. So, we got DS&#39; small step<br/>
stool and it was just right. We made sure to keep an eye on things for<br/>
safety (DS has become really good at adjusting his behaviors with<br/>
smaller people around - interesting since he&#39;s an only, no &#39;built in&#39;<br/>
smaller people to practice with). And, this past weekend, we were at a<br/>
family holiday gathering in a VERY small place with MANY people (18<br/>
people in a space the size of about 20x10 - and that includes the<br/>
kitchenette area with table and chairs, an additional 6 ft long table, a<br/>
recliner, a sofa, a TV/entertainment center, and a pair of bookshelves -<br/>
it was VERY crowded). 16 adults, a 9 yr old, and a 4 yr old. When the<br/>
kids started getting antsy, I sat myself on the middle of the sofa and<br/>
nephew was given the go ahead to launch himself across the room (all 3<br/>
feet or so of floorspace) and leap onto me - I&#39;d catch him, set him<br/>
down, and he&#39;d go again. In between times, DS wanted to do the same but<br/>
we decided that since his mass was bigger than nephew&#39;s, the energy<br/>
resulting from it would likely push the couch around, so instead he&#39;d<br/>
stand in front of me directly and jump up into the air and then onto me<br/>
(vertical instead of horizontal motion). After a couple dozen jumps,<br/>
nephew and DS were both playing quite happily and folks started saying<br/>
&quot;Ok enough - leave her alone&quot; to which I said &quot;Nope, I&#39;m fine&quot; and we<br/>
continued. Eventually, both boys decided to just stop and snuggle up on<br/>
either side of me. The alternative was to rein them in to NO physical<br/>
activity and spend the day rule-ing and regulating and punishing them<br/>
for simply being energetic boys in a confined space. By giving them a<br/>
safe way to burn energy, we ended up with a much more comfortable time<br/>
for all (BTW what we were doing is something I&#39;ve played with DS since<br/>
he was a toddler so I&#39;m quite practiced in absorbing/deflecting the<br/>
energy to keep myself and the jumper safe - no bumped nose, noggins,<br/>
knees, etc)<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t want bouncing on our bed - a lovely select comfort extra big<br/>
king - BUT we didn&#39;t make a &quot;rule&quot; about it. We discussed with DS<br/>
various aspects from OUR perspective (since we have a cape style house,<br/>
the ceiling angles to meet the wall over the bed - too short a distance<br/>
between head and hard popcorn textured surface; nightstands create<br/>
corner issues; lamps on said nightstands are breakable; etc) and<br/>
listened to HIS perspective on what he wanted to get out of bouncing on<br/>
the bed - and worked together to find ways to meet his needs AND our<br/>
needs. The thing with rules is that it creates a win/lose situation<br/>
while what we&#39;re working toward is win/win - as many needs as possible<br/>
get met one way or another. For us, that meant getting a mini<br/>
trampoline, an inflatable punching bag, and developing games that we<br/>
*could* safely play on/around the bed area that involve vigorous<br/>
activity *safely* (for instance, I sit on the edge of the bed and DS<br/>
runs across the room, safely cleared floor space, and tries to push me<br/>
over - sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t, but either way, we get<br/>
some vigorous play going).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784715113"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Besides padding the corners, can you rearrange any of the furniture so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is at least one &quot;runway&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
Or can you sell some of the big furniture and get smaller pieces with<br/>
the proceeds or simply decide which piece is absolutely too huge and<br/>
just get rid of it and leave it at that to make space to move? Find a<br/>
friend&#39;s/relative&#39;s garage/basement/attic/whatever to store it in if<br/>
this is a temporary situation and you know already you&#39;ll want this<br/>
piece again in a year or three? It sounds like the things are getting in<br/>
the way of the people (you acknowledge that it&#39;s tight for the adults<br/>
too - so why not open up some space for everyone).<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978607980">These things that Meredith said reminded me of two great books (that I&#39;ll<br/>
mention below):<br/>
 <br/>
	&quot;Part of the problem is that you&#39;ve decided on The Way to fix the<br/>
issue and are trying to &quot;get&quot; the kids to agree &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
	They are not trying to drive you crazy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first statement brings to mind &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; that I believe has<br/>
been mentioned here before.  I think the title is unfortunate in a way<br/>
because it may alienate those who (a) don&#39;t like labeling their children,<br/>
and (b) don&#39;t think it applies to them because their child is not explosive.<br/>
I found the book to be a real gem in regard to helping the parent shift<br/>
paradigms from &quot;parent&#39;s way&quot; to collaborative problem solving.  It really<br/>
benefits everyone, not just parents of explosive children, as it&#39;s valuable<br/>
for all of us to develop the habit of solving problems instead of powering<br/>
through control struggles.<br/>
<br/>
The second statement brings to ming &quot;When Anger Hurts your Kids.&quot;  Another<br/>
unfortunate title that may be off-putting to some.  It has a wonderful<br/>
exercise to identify and chart your triggers - and a common trigger is that<br/>
&quot;The kids are trying to drive me crazy/doing this to irritate me.&quot;  It has<br/>
greatly helped me see that many of the things I get angry about are *my*<br/>
triggers and *my* issues and not those of my kids.  It&#39;s wonderful to,<br/>
instead of reacting with anger, remember that &quot;this is one of my triggers.&quot;<br/>
Just having that thought pop into my head begins to diffuse my irritation<br/>
and turn me toward unraveling that issue instead of blaming my kids.  It<br/>
also really helped me prepare for *visiting grandparents* who may not share<br/>
our unschooling values.  I was apprehensive about what I viewed as my dad&#39;s<br/>
increasing tendency toward getting irritated easily - then I shifted my<br/>
thinking to try to figure out some of his triggers ahead the visit.  Boy,<br/>
that went a LONG way in helping us have a peaceful visit.  I realized when<br/>
he gets worried about safety he reacts with anger, which is very common.  I<br/>
made sure if we were playing or doing activities that would make him<br/>
anxious, that I stayed nearby so he didn&#39;t feel that he needed to be &quot;on<br/>
alert.&quot;  It took a load off of each of us.<br/>
<br/>
Just sharing two good books,<br/>
<br/>
