<div id="ygrps-yiv-675146155">I remember being in the grocery store once many years ago (DS was still<br/>
under 5, he&#39;s 11 now) and mentioning something casually as we stood in<br/>
line about the bags of those neon orange &quot;circus peanuts&quot; (basically<br/>
stiff marshmallow things, sugar + air + coloring) and how when I was<br/>
little they were a &#39;favorite&#39; thing. As you&#39;d probably expect, that<br/>
piqued DS&#39; interest and he asked for them. 99 cents, okay, that&#39;s doable<br/>
for a bag. Got them home. He headed straight for them. Ate HALF of one<br/>
and put it down. To his taste, they were too sweet and fairly boring. I<br/>
ate one or two and then we tossed the bag. On the other hand, he fell in<br/>
love with a particular type of snack cake. I&#39;d buy a box a week when I<br/>
shopped and they&#39;d be gone in a day, maybe two. DS wanted them every<br/>
week and any other time he could get them (at a mini mart) as well. So<br/>
we kept buying them. One week, that particular item was on special at<br/>
the market. When we got to there in our shopping, I told DS to get FIVE<br/>
boxes - he was Ecstatic! As expected, first box disappeared in a day or<br/>
two. Second box took a bit longer, by the third box, it was taking a<br/>
while, and by boxes 4 and 5, DH and I were more likely to grab them than<br/>
DS was. He&#39;d moved on to other things - there was no need to get them<br/>
quickly because they&#39;d be there whenever he wanted them, it didn&#39;t have<br/>
to occupy as much thought space. Fast forward a bunch of years...we&#39;ve<br/>
got a houseguest from Italy this month and he brought some gifts with<br/>
him for us...the thing that brought the biggest sparkle to DS&#39; eyes was<br/>
a HUGE amazing chunk of REAL Parmesan side by side with a BIG chunk of<br/>
awesome Romano. DS was bouncing happy when he saw that (surprised our<br/>
guest a little, he expected that the soccer jersey would be the bigger<br/>
hit...) This is a kid who tries to guess the percentage of cocoa in dark<br/>
chocolates now... We&#39;ve had guests over for dinner who were a bit<br/>
startled that he&#39;d put aside half a donut (double chocolate!) to eat<br/>
some steamed broccoli and salmon and then go back to the donut. And<br/>
therein lies the key - in his non-baggage mind, a double chocolate donut<br/>
and steamed broccoli are equal &#39;value&#39;, which he eats when just depends<br/>
on what he feels his body needs at the moment. It&#39;s not either donut or<br/>
broccoli - it&#39;s BOTH!<br/>
