==============<br/>
<br/>
What do you think is the central intention behind unschooling?  I have  <br/>
started looking at unschooling because it seemed to me that the  <br/>
central intention had to do with relationships - maintaining, building  <br/>
up, sustaining, and putting ahead of other things... So, very much  <br/>
unlike that tigermother who put academic or musical achievement way  <br/>
way ahead of anything else, or even the conventional schooling  <br/>
approach that says academics are the answer to everything... the point  <br/>
(one of many?) of is to establish a partnership and trust first and  <br/>
foremost, which can then serve as a base point from which to explore  <br/>
all that the world has to offer...  Something like it?</div>

<br/>
I see the intention of radical unschooling as joyful living and  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation that allows that to run smoothly, I think, is great  <br/>
relationships. The principles that help those relationships grow are  <br/>
peace, security, joy, respect, trust, honesty, truth, kindness,  <br/>
helpfulness, patience, compassion and so forth.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are unschoolers who confine the free exploration and discovery  <br/>
to academics. They require chores and can otherwise look like  <br/>
conventional parents. I can&#39;t say that their children&#39;s exploration of  <br/>
&quot;the world&quot; is hampered. They&#39;re free to follow their interests and  <br/>
are trusted they&#39;ll discover what they need to know by doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers extend the principles of unschooling into  <br/>
parenting so it&#39;s not that the relationship needs to come before the  <br/>
exploring. The relationship is an integral part of radical unschooling  <br/>
by definition. The exploring and relationship are partners. They  <br/>
coexist. The sum is greater than the parts :-)<br/>
<br/>
But when searching for solutions to problems, whatever moves towards  <br/>
better relationships or helps avoid damaging the relationship is  <br/>
likely to help someone move toward smoother flowing radical unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588499019">Well, this is where my cold-blooded side is going to come screaming to the fore, because I don&#39;t see relationships as the point of unschooling but as a primary tool for creating an environment that supports exploration and discovery.

<br/>
The central premise of unschooling is that human nature itself is sufficient for learning (which, outside of radical unschooling is defined more narrowly as &quot;sufficient&quot; for learning certain subjects or skills but not others).<br/>
<br/>
The main correlary to that premise is that human beings can support one another so that each person&#39;s learning may flourish in ways special to that individual.

Its pretty dead these days, but it could be a fun way to liven things up with a purely theoretical debate. (Newcomers welcome, but be advised its much more heavily moderated than most unschooling lists).<br/>

includes a whole lot more than the learning that happens.<br/>

But the focus of the discussion here on the list is about learning and  <br/>
how to create an environment for that. The discussion is about joyful  <br/>
living in support of joyful learning. But I doubt anyone here sees  <br/>
joyful learning as the only reason to live joyfully! :-)<br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t really get how parents could be unschooling and then realize they<br/>
need to change the way they are parenting. That seems like so much work! I<br/>
did the reverse. It seemed so natural. But I could have gotten off track<br/>
quite easily. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been working on my relationship with my son from day 1. Sometimes I<br/>
wonder if he hadn&#39;t been such a demanding baby if I would have been a<br/>
different parent. The way I am raising my son certainly isn&#39;t the way I was<br/>
raised! I have empathy and compassion that wasn&#39;t shown to me. As it turned<br/>
out, he hated to be left alone (in a bassinet, in a swing, in a stroller) so<br/>
in order to not have to hear him cry, I held him a lot. I had slings, wraps,<br/>
and carriers for different purposes. My back ached but my baby was happy. We<br/>
quickly gave up on the bassinet idea and let him sleep with us. All things<br/>
centered on what made the baby happy because if he was happy, I was too. I<br/>
felt like a good mother.<br/>
 <br/>
It gets a little harder though, as kids grow up, to continue treating them<br/>
that way. I mean as I started to hang around other mothers and kids it<br/>
seemed like there was a fine line between letting your child explore a room<br/>
while keeping him safe and controlling what he explores. As the kids learned<br/>
to talk, they could tell us what they wanted. It seemed like then the mother<br/>
could continue to give the child what he wanted or withhold for some reason<br/>
and that&#39;s when mothers started to say no. For various reasons or seemingly<br/>
no reason.<br/>
 <br/>
Child: I want cookie.<br/>
Mom: No cookies, we&#39;re having lunch soon.<br/>
Child cries. <br/>
Mom: Stop crying. Play with this toy.<br/>
Child takes toy and throws across room while crying harder or screaming.<br/>
Mom yells at child to not throw toy and stop crying. Maybe even puts in time<br/>
out.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t say I had a lot of friends who were like that, but I did see<br/>
episodes like that. Mothers following a script of what they think they are<br/>
supposed to be doing. Somewhere we get off track. We stop following our<br/>
baby&#39;s cues and start trying to make them follow ours. And we don&#39;t even<br/>
know the reasons why we are doing some of the things we do! I can see where<br/>
parents might start out with the best intentions and then get off track. Do<br/>
I keep doing what feels right? I don&#39;t want a spoiled child. Or do I start<br/>
doing what everyone else is doing?<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I was just trying to explain how I feel like I started off on the<br/>
right path to having a good relationship with my son, but was almost<br/>
sidetracked into the folly of mainstream parenting as he got older. Many of<br/>
my friends started sending their kids to preschool at ages 2 and 3. I<br/>
wondered why a SAHM would opt to send her child away, willingly, for someone<br/>
else to raise. I was a little more understanding of working moms doing that,<br/>
I mean they had to work, right? But those who stayed home? I couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand it. A few of my friends kept their kids at home and we continued<br/>
meeting up and going to the zoo and stuff like that. <br/>
 <br/>
I could see where this was going though. They were going to put their kids<br/>
in Kindergarten and we&#39;d part ways. I started to seek out new friends. I<br/>
wanted more like minded friends who would support my journey because it felt<br/>
right to be compassionate when my son had a breakdown and to say yes to<br/>
things he wanted. <br/>
 <br/>
Luckily I found a good group of likeminded parents and a friend recommended<br/>
this unschooling conference to me. I went when my son was 3, almost 4, and<br/>
that changed my life! There were other parents helping their children<br/>
explore, saying yes, acting more as partners in learning than dictators. I<br/>
liked that atmosphere so much! I finally felt like I could stay on this path<br/>
and had examples of how kids could be if not sent to school. <br/>
 <br/>
So for me, unschooling flowed from the parenting relationship I had and<br/>
wanted to continue! It seems so natural I can&#39;t see a distinction from the 2<br/>
ideas. It&#39;s just a continuation of how I wanted to raise my child. I must<br/>
say that it helped tremendously to see other people doing it and have a<br/>
model to follow and connecting with others within that community. It would<br/>
be hard to do alone with no similar friends. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963038464">Kim, yes - if one starts unschooling from the get-go as you have, then<br/>
it all kind of flows together, the parenting and everything else (since<br/>
parenting starts first and then the &#39;school years&#39;). However, many folks<br/>
don&#39;t take that path. They don&#39;t even look for something like<br/>
unschooling until school starts not working for their children. They<br/>
start with trying to find a better educational path for their child(ren)<br/>
and maybe discover that learning freely &#39;works best&#39; for their kid(s).<br/>
Trusting the kids to learn to read, write, find Brazil on a map,<br/>
whatever, questioning whether the &#39;traditional&#39; educational paradigm is<br/>
valid, then draws into question all the other parenting paradigms and<br/>
&quot;givens&quot;. If kids don&#39;t have to go to school, do they have learn in the<br/>
same way school does things? If they aren&#39;t getting up early for school,<br/>
are 8 pm bedtimes mandatory? If they aren&#39;t having to leave the house<br/>
early for school, is it mandatory to have breakfast and be dressed first<br/>
thing? And so on.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, coming into the relationship with my stepson when he was 4, rules seemed like they worked at first, also. He&#39;d had so much chaos and uncertainty in his life that rules were better! But over time I started to realize that adhering to rules also introduced a level of chaos and uncertainty - so I shifted to looking for the reasons behind the rules and looking for way to meet needs rather than &quot;correct&quot; behavior. But! at the same time I was also homeschooling (school at home). <br/>
<br/>
Poor Ray got to suffer through my learning process, I&#39;m afraid, while Mo has mostly reaped the rewards of unschooling from the start. <br/>
