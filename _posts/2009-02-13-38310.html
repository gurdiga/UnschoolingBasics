<div id="ygrps-yiv-646163693">Hello! I&#39;m Melissa, momma to three & newly interested in unschooling. <br/>
My eldest child, Madison, is 7 & we spent a year homeschooling <br/>
followed by a year in public school. We removed her from school at <br/>
the beginning of the her second year of public school & began <br/>
homeschooling again. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always taken a really laid back approach to parenting & <br/>
schooling. We&#39;re mainly a family who really enjoys spending time <br/>
together, which is why we decided on the homeschooling route in the <br/>
first place. My husband works retail, so his schedule is always <br/>
changing & he rarely has weekends off; when Madison was in public <br/>
school, she would go days without seeing her dad. Not cool!<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve just recently joined this list & have been quietly reading <br/>
for a few days. There are some awesome people here & I totally <br/>
appreciate the words of wisdom passed along. I&#39;ve even written down <br/>
some quotations that have struck me; rereading them & putting them <br/>
into practice I think has already helped me be a gentler momma. I&#39;m <br/>
so thankful for that, as I&#39;ve struggled with keeping my cool. I&#39;m <br/>
ashamed to admit I&#39;ve been a yeller, so reading through the posts <br/>
here and following some really interesting links has reenforced & <br/>
firmed up my ability to practice patience with my little ones. Thank <br/>
you all for that!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed & learned from the discussion on <br/>
bedtimes/routines. Like I mentioned, my husband works retail so he <br/>
has some really late nights sometimes, so we don&#39;t make an early <br/>
bedtime a big deal. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of flack from my dad about not <br/>
having my children on a schedule. I say, we do have a schedule; it&#39;s <br/>
just a floating schedule that changes as we need it to. :)<br/>
<br/>
So I do have some questions for whomever has stayed with me through <br/>
all the blabbering. First, what about chores? I don&#39;t assign a list <br/>
of chores, but I do expect my girls to help out as time & age permit. <br/>
They&#39;re usually happy to help out, but there is occasional grumbling. <br/>
How do unschooling families deal with chores/houseworky type stuff? <br/>
<br/>
We live in a modestly sized home, so it&#39;s important for sanity&#39;s sake <br/>
that we attempt to stay fairly well organized & pick up messes before <br/>
they become disasters. That said, I&#39;m not striving for anything other <br/>
than liveable & comfortable while my girls are young, so please don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;m asking how to keep a clean & pretty home. I simply wonder <br/>
what unschooling as a lifestyle says about having our children <br/>
perform some simple, basic chores.    <br/>
<br/>
I did have some other questions, but I&#39;ve managed to forget the <br/>
others in the time it&#39;s taken me to type this out, in between nursing <br/>
& answering questions & hearing some awesome facts about dinosaurs <br/>
(did you know that micropachycephalosaurus is the longest dinosaur <br/>
name?). <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to acquiring some more unschooling wisdom!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its useful to ask yourself &quot;simple/basic to whom?&quot; Kids are very busy <br/>
people. They are busy exploring and discovering and making <br/>
connections. That takes up a lot of time and energy, especially with <br/>
younger kids, like yours. Asking them to stop in the middle of all <br/>
that to do something they aren&#39;t interested in doing isn&#39;t a simple <br/>
request from their perspectives. Its just as invasive as telling a <br/>
child to put away the blocks and come do a math worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
 As kids get older, they&#39;ll start to have more appreciation for <br/>
order. Learning how to create order will become one of their <br/>
interests and motivations - it really will! Yesterday my 15yo was <br/>
utterly possessed with the urge to clean and organize his room. He&#39;s <br/>
not a tidy person by nature (and neither are his parents), either. <br/>
But he&#39;s reached a point in his life where cleaning his own space has <br/>
personal value. It happens. Kids are far less likely to do this sort <br/>
of thing willingly if they haven&#39;t had the option to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not <br/>
right now&quot; for awhile. Ray took almost two years of deschooling to <br/>
get there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...having our children perform...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I pulled this phrase out to highlight it a bit more. On its own, like <br/>
that, its a pretty scary concept. I suspect you don&#39;t really want <br/>
your relationship with your kids to be some kind of &quot;performance&quot; <br/>
that they put on for your benefit - most likely, you want to have a <br/>
genuinely caring relationship with them. But pushing children to do <br/>
chores is a lot like requiring them to perform in some way (in my <br/>
mind I have an image of a child standing on a chair reciting poetry <br/>
for guests) - it tears down the value of what they choose to do with <br/>
their own time and energy. Unschooling revolves around supporting <br/>
those very choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We live in a modestly sized home, so it&#39;s important for sanity&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sake <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that we attempt to stay fairly well organized & pick up messes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>before <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they become disasters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As much as possible, streamline cleanup. Put down blankets for toys <br/>
and games with small parts, so you can pick up the whole kitten-<br/>
kaboodle in one swoop. Place bins and baskets in convenient locations <br/>
for cleanup. It might help to rethink some of the ways your whole <br/>
house is organized with the needs of busy young children in mind, in <br/>
order to make putting things *back* faster and more convenient. <br/>
<br/>
In our house, for instance, all the books in the house are in the <br/>
process of being moved to the living room. My books and Morgan&#39;s <br/>
books have been in our respective rooms, but she likes to read in the <br/>
living room more often, now, and Ray wants to read all my books - so <br/>
its easier to do a big rearrangement than to keep running up and down <br/>
the stairs with armloads of books. <br/>
<br/>
Another example - an unschooling mom I know irl has converted one <br/>
bedroom in her house into The Lego and Trains Room. It ended up being <br/>
easier on everyone to reshuffle sleeping arrangements and give over a <br/>
whole room to things with lots of tiny parts, so that all those parts <br/>
can stay in one place. They moved a tv in there so the kids don&#39;t <br/>
ever have to argue about dragging legos into the living room to watch <br/>
tv. The mom likes a tidy house, and this was a solution that worked <br/>
well for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, if I&#39;m in the midst of cleaning or tidying up <br/>
for company I&#39;ll tell the kids (my 7yo, especially) &quot;please don&#39;t <br/>
bring that in here/ start that project/ get those toys out Right Now -<br/>
 I&#39;m trying to get the room clean!&quot; Plus I regularly say things <br/>
like &quot;please do that Over the trash can&quot; or &quot;do that in the sink&quot; or <br/>
even &quot;that&#39;s too messy for inside, take it on the porch, please.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Its not a matter of mom giving up all her boundaries or something! <br/>
Much of where unschooling is different from other kinds of parenting, <br/>
though, has to do with questioning those boundaries to see when they <br/>
aren&#39;t really boundaries at all. Sometimes what we think are <br/>
boundaries are habits or social conventions that can be modified or <br/>
done away with entirely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176674054">My boys are 5 & 6. I usually just do my household chores and allow<br/>
them the opportunity to help, if they want. Yesterday, I got some help<br/>
cleaning their bedroom and their bathroom and some of the kitchen and<br/>
sunroom (big cleaning day) without asking at all. They offer to help,<br/>
they help until they&#39;ve had their fill.. then they are free to go and<br/>
I will continue my work. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I ask if they&#39;d like to help - when it&#39;s work they enjoy.<br/>
For some reason, they like to do laundry, so I will announce laundry<br/>
time, to give them the opportunity to help. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any expectations on them when it comes to chores. I don&#39;t<br/>
expect them to do chores, I don&#39;t expect them to help the entire time,<br/>
and I don&#39;t expect them to do the job to *my* standards. They do<br/>
chores if they choose to do chores, they do them for as long as they<br/>
wish, and they do the chores to their own standards. <br/>
<br/>
I consider any chores they do to be very considerate toward me, as the<br/>
household chores are primarily things that are my responsibility. I<br/>
appreciate that they are so often willing to help me out and I don&#39;t<br/>
leave them stranded, doing chores on their own - unless they are<br/>
content to do it that way. Like, washing windows.. my youngest will<br/>
sit there and wash windows for ever and does not care if I am there or<br/>
not. But, for the most part, they are much happier to be helping me in<br/>
my company. <br/>
<br/>
The boys have started, about once a month or so, *surprising* me by<br/>
having done some task on their own, without my knowledge, for my<br/>
benefit. Like a gift from them.  I really like that. <br/>
<br/>
My father complained that I&#39;m not teaching them structure and<br/>
responsibility... but, I feel like having them CHOOSE to do the<br/>
chores, and setting their own standards of completion, and surprising<br/>
me with tasks done that I never had to ask them to do... sounds a lot<br/>
like responsible, considerate people. And if I forced them to do<br/>
things, and demanded that it be done this or that way - his way of<br/>
getting kids to do chores. I don&#39;t think it would sound so responsible<br/>
or considerate anymore. LOLOL</div>

<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
down the right hand side is a section for chores and several pages  <br/>
that address common questions.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the biggest difference between radical unschoolers and  <br/>
conventional parenting on chores is the mental shift to seeing the  <br/>
chores as something that *parent* has chosen for the life *parent*  <br/>
wants to have and provide and then kids can be invited along to help  <br/>
as you might a friend.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point. Sometimes kids really enjoy doing the things we <br/>
adults think of as &quot;chores&quot;. Washing is popular with many children - <br/>
they don&#39;t like to &quot;pick up&quot; but they&#39;re thrilled to wash counters, <br/>
floors, bathtubs, windows... For awhile Morgan had her own set of <br/>
spray bottles with different cleaning products: soapy water, plain <br/>
water and vinegar. That was enough for her to wash most things. She&#39;d <br/>
ask me to move furniture and bring a step ladder so she could wash <br/>
windows and mirrors - there were days when it was all I could do to <br/>
stay ahead of her LOL! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed to visit a home where children aren&#39;t allowed to <br/>
clean independently. Recently I was visiting a home where there were <br/>
lots of dirty dishes - and the mom was complaining that she &quot;had to&quot; <br/>
do the dishes at night or her 6yo wanted to help. It seemed like an <br/>
odd thing to complain about, but I&#39;ve heard other parents make <br/>
similar complaints about kids wanting to do dishes. Generally I <br/>
sugest offerring the child a plastic wash basin and a chance to wash <br/>
all the non-breakables - which are often the child&#39;s dishes anyway. <br/>
This particular mom looked really relieved at the suggestion - she&#39;d <br/>
honestly never considered that option.<br/>

they don&#39;t have a choice. They can be made to be resentful and they can <br/>
learn to shirk, when they are forced to do chores against their will.<br/>
