<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938396817">Hi. I am Nikki and I mostly read all the posts but haven&#39;t said too much.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been home schooling most of the time I&#39;ve had kids and my oldest is<br/>
almost 20.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids. Boy almost 20, Boy almost 16, boy 11 and girl 10.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used anything from pre-packaged curriculum to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I run a full time daycare in my home as well.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had structure so much my kids &quot;hate&quot; school.to now all they want to do<br/>
is play WOW.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is my problem, my 11 year old and 10 year old say they HATE to read. My<br/>
11 year old refused even to read in his bible class. Yes, he CAN read well<br/>
but just doesn&#39;t like to. I&#39;ve worked one on one with my 10 year old and at<br/>
night we are reading the Little house series together. I read mostly to her<br/>
unless she asks to read some and she really likes these stories. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I thought of some kind of incentive program maybe I can put in place for my<br/>
11 year old. I don&#39;t care if it is Sponge Bob he reads. He needs to be<br/>
reading something. He should tell his Sunday school teacher no, he won&#39;t<br/>
read. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If left to his own defenses, he would just play games all day. HELP!<br/>

Yesterday was the first time he ever picked up a book and read it from<br/>
cover to cover by himself.  It&#39;s amazing what happens when you don&#39;t<br/>
force reading on a child.  <br/>
<br/>
Try changing your perspective.  Instead of &quot;working with&quot; your 10 year<br/>
old, can&#39;t you simply enjoy stories together?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree.  My 14yo dd doesn&#39;t like to read either but I know <br/>
she is capable of it so I don&#39;t worry.  For her she doesn&#39;t like the <br/>
smell of books.  She likes to go to Barnes & Noble and sit in the <br/>
comfy chairs and read but doesn&#39;t like library books.  We have a <br/>
subscription to Audible.com and she gets two or three audiobooks a <br/>
month.  She listens to them on her i-pod every night.  She&#39;s also on <br/>
the computer a lot.  As an avid reader this was very hard for me to <br/>
understand but I got past it.  It is really about us being ok with <br/>
them learning in their own way.  I&#39;m still working on not needing to <br/>
look for the educational equivilant of everything she does and just <br/>
enjoy our life together.  I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a whole other topic <br/>
though. : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224791608">Well, there isn&#39;t a lot of reading done in wow for my boy.<br/>
<br/>
He and his dad have almost leveled to 70 together and my husband knew the<br/>
quests so my boy just follows his dad.<br/>
<br/>
Let me say this.<br/>
<br/>
Him playing wow from 4pm until 10:30pm at night is not what ANYONE would<br/>
consider educational and if you sometimes see the chatting that goes on in<br/>
general chat, it would be considered almost pg13 or above rating.<br/>
<br/>
I know all about wow cause I&#39;ve been playing the game since before it was<br/>
released cause I was in the beta testing phase of it.<br/>
<br/>
I want him to have a love of classical literature.  <br/>
<br/>
I can see him when he has his portfolio check with his teacher to send in<br/>
another intent to homeschool:<br/>

&quot; Oh my parents don&#39;t make me ready books: boy 11<br/>
<br/>
&quot;really, well, where do you get your reading practice then?&quot; Teacher<br/>

&quot;I play world of warcraft for 7 hours a day and 7 days a week. Sometimes<br/>

He might be interested in reading gaming magazines.<br/>

here find WOW (and other video games) quite educational.  i don&#39;t, but<br/>
a lot of parents here also play WOW.  your not coming into a board of<br/>
people who don&#39;t know what your talking about.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want him to have a love of classical literature.  <br/>

 <br/>

<br/>
As I&#39;m sure many of us do portfolio&#39;s I know that they do not need to<br/>
be filled with &quot;schooly stuff&quot; only.  I&#39;ve never done one, maybe<br/>
someone else will chime in?  We have had teacher assessments though. <br/>
There are lots of teachers that are unschool friendly and who can put<br/>
our lives in educationalese for us.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually it probably would.  Your husband and son are no doubt doing<br/>
some sort of reading together.  That counts.  Just because it isn&#39;t<br/>
printed on paper in a book, and just because he doesn&#39;t do it all by<br/>
himself, and just because you don&#39;t see it, doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t do<br/>
it and its not reading.  That&#39;s a little jumbled, but I think you get<br/>
my point.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your confused as to what unschooling is?  Or maybe your looking<br/>
for help with creating a educationalizing an unschooled life for a<br/>
portfolio?    Personally, I&#39;m a little confused as to exactly what<br/>
you&#39;re looking for?</div>

But that can&#39;t be forced. At all. Forcing it, or attempting to do so, will  <br/>
most likely disengage your child. You mentioned that &quot;no one&quot; would think  that <br/>
him playing WoW for 6 hours would be educational, but I&#39;m struggling to  find <br/>
out what is NOT educational. The stories I&#39;ve heard about Wow seem to be  <br/>
very supportive of delight driven learning...I&#39;m confused about your  Unschooling <br/>
interests, as it sounds like you are hoping more for school-at-home  than <br/>
unschooling. Perhaps we don&#39;t know you well enough yet to be able to  tell...? <br/>
 <br/>
more to come, right?<br/>

<br/>
How will he be a better him if he has classical literature in him? I  <br/>
mean really think about that. Not just theory about how literature is  <br/>
good for you, but how does it enhance a particular person&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
I would venture to say that the people who love classic literature  <br/>
are the ones who think like classic literaturists (if that&#39;s a  <br/>
word ;-) They don&#39;t see the world in terms of connections to classic  <br/>
literature because they&#39;ve read classic literature. They&#39;ve read  <br/>
classic literature because they love it and love to find the  <br/>
connections between it and life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a school idea that if we force x on kids that they&#39;ll get the  <br/>
benefit of those who have voluntarily taken in x. The most likely  <br/>
thing to happen is that kids will want to avoid x.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want him to have a love of classical literature.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can&#39;t make them love something. But we can make them avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m not a lover of classical literature, I chose to watch a lot  <br/>
of movies based on classical literature while in high school. Just  <br/>
because it intrigued me. Lots of Shakespeare. Jane Austen. Dickens.  <br/>
Antigone. Oedipus.<br/>
<br/>
The one bit if classical literature that I had a really hard time  <br/>
watching the kids&#39; version of was Silas Marner because some educator  <br/>
thought it would be good for me and made me read it in 10th grade.  <br/>
Blech.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want him to have a love of classical literature.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want to provide him an opportunity to love literature, make  <br/>
sure that his encounters with it are enjoyable. Think movies. Think  <br/>
-- even better -- modern adaptations. Then you can say &quot;This is a  <br/>
*really* old story that they updated. It was written over 300 years  <br/>
ago. *Intrigue* him.<br/>
<br/>
*Way* better that he watch &quot;Conscience of the King&quot; episode of  <br/>
classic Star Trek or Clueless or Forbidden Planet and come away  <br/>
smiling with a positive feeling that the originals might be something  <br/>
he&#39;d like to see some day than to sit through something because  <br/>
someone thinks it&#39;s good for him.<br/>
<br/>
(For anyone interested, here&#39;s something interesting. Filmed  <br/>
Shakespeare with a list of adaptations. (Just search &quot;adaptation&quot; on  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do our kids a huge disservice if we take their present behavior  <br/>
and project it into the future. There&#39;s something hugely important  <br/>
that he&#39;s getting out of his playing. You can&#39;t make that need go away.<br/>
<br/>
But you can make him feel bad about his need and about himself.<br/>
<br/>
You can limit his time so that the importance of play increases and  <br/>
he&#39;ll want to play more than he is right now (but won&#39;t be able to  <br/>
since he&#39;s limited.)<br/>

<br/>
And yet all are important to those ages. Right now he&#39;s learning  <br/>

school. (If you need help translating it into educationese, just ask  <br/>
and people here can help or point you to things that can help.) But  <br/>
learning through living doesn&#39;t look like school. School is a dried  <br/>
up, predigested, imitation of life. Life better *not* resemble it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It might help to read &quot;Why schools use the methods they do&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is my problem, my 11 year old and 10 year old say they HATE to  <br/>
&gt; read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do they hate to read?<br/>
<br/>
Because they were made to?<br/>
<br/>
The more you push, the  more they&#39;ll back off. You can&#39;t make them  <br/>
want to read. But you can further their dislike of reading.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. Think about something you dislike and someone  <br/>
hovering over you wanting you to like it, making you try it over and  <br/>
over, worried that you&#39;ll never like it. How would you feel about the  <br/>
thing? How would you feel about the person hovering over you? Just  <br/>
because you&#39;re certain you&#39;re right about reading being important,  <br/>
that won&#39;t change how your kids feel about your worrying and  <br/>
hovering. It&#39;s far more likely to make them back further off than  <br/>
pull closer.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to give them a chance to recover a like of reading you&#39;ll  <br/>
need to back off completely from wanting them to read. Make all their  <br/>
encounters with the printed word pleasant and they will begin to heal  <br/>
from the damage done.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Scott Noelle wrote as part of his &quot;Daily Groove&quot;.  <br/>
It&#39;s a question that a lot of new unschoolers struggle with: when  <br/>
helping them might not really be helping them but easing our fears.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
&gt; www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :: Helping vs. Co-creation ::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Q: How do you know when it&#39;s appropriate<br/>
&gt;        to offer your child help/assistance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    A: When the offer feels *inspired* rather<br/>
&gt;        than fear-based.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re coming from a perspective that your child is<br/>
&gt; helpless, damaged, weak, incompetent, lost, wrong,<br/>
&gt; etc., then your &quot;help&quot; will only give power to that<br/>
&gt; belief. It won&#39;t feel inspired to you, and it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; inspire your child to connect with his or her Power.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if you consciously shift your perspective to one<br/>
&gt; in which you see your child as capable of finding his<br/>
&gt; or her way, you won&#39;t feel like you &quot;should&quot; help, and<br/>
&gt; you probably won&#39;t offer to help unless asked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, you might be *inspired* to get involved in a<br/>
&gt; way that doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re a &quot;have&quot; helping a<br/>
&gt; &quot;have-not&quot; -- it&#39;ll feel more like two souls playing<br/>
&gt; together, co-creating purely for the joy of it!<br/>

happens with kids who have the freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
SECOND, know that we love our kids as much as you love yours. We  <br/>
don&#39;t want to compromise their futures for some wacky theory. We want  <br/>
them to be able to attend college if they want and hold jobs they love.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD, understand that many of us have older kids and some even  <br/>
adults who have been unschooling most of their lives. This isn&#39;t some  <br/>
untested theory. We can see the results of what we talk about here.<br/>
<br/>
FOURTH, know that there are many people here who were in the &quot;Are you  <br/>
people freakin&#39; nuts?!&quot; stage that you&#39;re in ;-) The most helpful  <br/>
thing you can do is assume that what you think will happen is *not*  <br/>
what will happen. Do ask how we avoid what you fear will happen.  <br/>
There&#39;s years of wisdom here and we&#39;ve heard most of the fears and we  <br/>
understand why it seems such and such will happen and why such and  <br/>
such won&#39;t.<br/>

at the world around him. He got what he needed and moved onto the  <br/>
next thing he needed.<br/>
<br/>
Do know that loads of people here have had kids who&#39;ve been in the  <br/>
hours of video games stage. We&#39;ve seen what&#39;s on the other side and  <br/>
it&#39;s not growing controls from your fingers and plugging directly  <br/>
into the system so you can play during your sleep :-)<br/>
<br/>
No matter how immersed kids seem right now, they do get their fill  <br/>
and the desire to play drops. It might take months! My daughter was  <br/>
fairly well married to cartoons during her preteen years. But she  <br/>
came out of it and is a vibrant interesting person. In fact she won&#39;t  <br/>
watch enough TV to keep the TiVo cleared off ;-)<br/>

he&#39;s having problems with the world.<br/>

Jesus had far more gentle thoughts about children than Churches would have<br/>
us believe...<br/>
Even his disciples say one must have the eyes of a child to enter heaven,<br/>
another place they say that as a child I behaved like a child (and as an<br/>
ADULT I put those child-like ways behind me).<br/>
My version of Jesus is *always* on the side of the child and *always* in the<br/>
perspective of &quot;Whole, Complete & Perfect&quot;<br/>

We&#39;ve had structure so much my kids &quot;hate&quot; school.to now all they want <br/>
to do<br/>
is play WOW.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my problem, my 11 year old and 10 year old say they HATE to <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That happens all the tome in school when kids are forced to read.<br/>
<br/>
How do you think it happened in your homeschool?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old refused even to read in his bible class. Yes, he CAN <br/>
read well<br/>
but just doesn&#39;t like to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did his teacher ask him to read? Or order him? If it were a request, <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;no&quot; an acceptable answer?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought of some kind of incentive program maybe I can put in place <br/>
for my<br/>
11 year old.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, many parents give gold stars and stickers for reading and take <br/>
away WOW. Usually with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe give stickers and gold stars for playing WOW and take away the <br/>
books. Yeah---forbid reading!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t care if it is Sponge Bob he reads. He needs to be<br/>
reading something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? Why does he NEED to read? Does he have a job that requires <br/>
reading? At 11?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If left to his own defenses, he would just play games all day. HELP!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has a collection of these statements: <br/>
www.sandradodd.co,/ifilet<br/>
<br/>
Maybe playing games is a way to defend himself from all the pressure to <br/>
read?<br/>

I&#39;m REALLY having some difficulty here with this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We know! It&#39;s not easy to comprehend. It&#39;s even tougher to put into <br/>
action!<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that both are possible!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So, leave EVERYTHING up to him?<br/>
<br/>
If he wants and is interested in nothing but video games, so be it?<br/>
I&#39;m concerned that is his only thing he likes to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, I wanted to only be with the horses.<br/>
<br/>
My parents were surely worried that I only had that damned horse on my <br/>
mind---it was all I wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being a tween and teen. I was ONLY happy at the barn.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, they let me spend a LOT of my time there.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot more than they could have ever imagined. My world is SO <br/>
much richer because of those horses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My son is a Christian but now in class he refused to read when his <br/>
teacher<br/>
called on him to read.<br/>
<br/>
What about that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about that? He&#39;s not &quot;obedient&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Is that your goal? Obedience?<br/>

&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. So be it for now because that&#39;s what he wants right now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First - it isn&#39;t the &quot;only&quot; thing, so don&#39;t exaggerate, even a little.  <br/>
I know you&#39;re exaggerating a bit, because he apparently does at least  <br/>
go to Sunday School. So he&#39;s doing something else.<br/>
<br/>
Second - you don&#39;t leave everything up to him - your job is to support  <br/>
him, help him, encourage him, offer him ideas and things and  <br/>
experiences and --- the world! But, start right now where he IS -  <br/>
right now he loves to play video games. Support that with all your  <br/>
heart - make it possible for him to really play as much as he wants.  <br/>
Take him food while he&#39;s playing. Subscribe to video game magazines.  <br/>
Buy him new games or upgrades as often as you can. Help find him other  <br/>
people who like to play the same games. Get him Skype so he can use  <br/>
voice-over-internet to talk to other players. Find related products -  <br/>
cd&#39;s of video game music, movies based on video games, etc. Whether  <br/>
you fully feel it or not, ACT like him playing video games is the most  <br/>
wonderful thing you can imagine him doing. Support support support.  <br/>
Sit near him in the same room when he&#39;s playing - let him TELL you all  <br/>
about it. Ask questions. Learn enough about it that you can have good  <br/>
conversations. Oh, look up online comic strips (I don&#39;t know names -  <br/>
my kids show them to me) - they are hysterical, but you often have to  <br/>
know about video games to get the jokes. Look up information about the  <br/>
composers of the video game music - what else have they done? You&#39;ll  <br/>
be surprised - maybe share just a bit of what you learn, with your  <br/>
son, if he&#39;s interested. GO to conferences/conventions or other events  <br/>
that are video game related.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, really truly get INTO this and support it  <br/>
wholeheartedly. THAT is what unschooling is about. At the same time,  <br/>
think about your son and what else he is interested in and offer other  <br/>
kinds of input as well. Do you do interesting things as a family? Go  <br/>
to the Renaissance Faire, camping, to concerts, museums, exhibits,  <br/>
theater, bowling, white water rafting, paint-ball playing, sky diving?  <br/>
Anything? Live a joy-filled life - focus on that and the learning will  <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you want to read some very interesting, but highly academic,  <br/>
discussion of video games, you might read a bit of this blog by a  <br/>
university professor: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://grandtextauto.org/">http://grandtextauto.org/</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is a Christian but now in class he refused to read when his  <br/>
&gt; teacher<br/>
&gt; called on him to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please please honor his desire not to read out loud in public. That is  <br/>
anxiety-provoking for many people and coercing it just makes it worse  <br/>
and worse. Show him you respect him and trust his judgment. If he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel comfortable doing it, support that. Tell his teacher that  <br/>
you prefer that she ask for volunteers and not put anybody on the spot  <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s in Sunday School, don&#39;t you want it to be a warm and  <br/>
wonderful experience for him? Shouldn&#39;t that time be really some of  <br/>
the most inspiring, life-affirming time of his week? It shouldn&#39;t be a  <br/>
time he dreads or is made to feel bad about himself, should it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What about that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rude of his teacher - that&#39;s what I think about that.<br/>
I taught Sunday School for many years. One reason I taught it was to  <br/>
be sure that my own kids had really good experiences - especially my  <br/>
youngest daughter who was a later reader. Sunday school teachers  <br/>
should be demonstrating the utmost kindness and respect for the  <br/>
children, not embarrassing them. They should be enticing them with the  <br/>
sweetness of the lesson and providing a wonderful living example, not  <br/>
shoving something down their throats, right? Of course, right! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
