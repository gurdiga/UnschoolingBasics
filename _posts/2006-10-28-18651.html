<div id="ygrps-yiv-585513550">***I feel like she<br/>
isn&#39;t grateful for all she has and worry I&#39;m raising a matrialistic<br/>
person. She told me she doen&#39;t get joy form giving, only<br/>
recieving. How do I turn this around?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s in need.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s young and inexperienced and she&#39;s in emotional need.  She doesn&#39;t know <br/>
how to fill the hole.   When adults don&#39;t know what will help them feel <br/>
better they eat, or drink, or gamble, or do drugs.  Some people shop and <br/>
spend money they shouldn&#39;t spend or worse, don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
What does she need?<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s asking you for the costume she&#39;s asking for you to fill her need.<br/>
<br/>
Buy her what she thinks she wants.  Give as much, -no, give *more* - <br/>
consideration to the things she wants than you&#39;d give to an item you want <br/>
for yourself.   In conjunction with that fill her up, emotionally.  Be with <br/>
her, play with her, be her best friend, listen to her, share with her, do <br/>
something everyday that&#39;s just about her and what she loves.<br/>
<br/>
If you knew she was hungry, you&#39;d feed her.  If you knew she was cold, you&#39;d <br/>
get her a blanket.  You know she&#39;s in need, emotionally.   Be present with <br/>
her all day.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the costume...<br/>
Even if she never touches the item again that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t <br/>
important to her.  As in learning to walk or dress ourselves or read, we all <br/>
will learn the dynamics of wanting, getting what we want and feeling <br/>
fulfilled,  *in our own time. *<br/>
<br/>
I have items that I really love and cherish but rarely touch.  Some are <br/>
tucked away in boxes and I don&#39;t know when I last looked at them but it <br/>
comforts me knowing they are there.   It&#39;s not your place to define and <br/>
decide what your daughter really wants nor is it your place to assess it&#39;s <br/>
importance to her according to how often she touches it.<br/>
<br/>
Much of your post was about *why* your daughter was wrong.  You felt that <br/>
was important to share here.  Your justification of not buying the costume <br/>
was First: she didn&#39;t *need* it - (which is not your call to make) and next: <br/>
you needed to use the money you had for other things.<br/>
<br/>
Could the project stuff have been postponed in favor of the costume?  Would <br/>
your daughter have preferred that?   Who were the gloves and boots and hat <br/>
for?  If they were for her mightn&#39;t she have had the choice to delay those <br/>
new items in favor of the costume?  Christmas is two months away.  Halloween <br/>
is here, now.   From your daughters point of view it looked like you got <br/>
everything you wanted that day and she got shafted.   Which person seems <br/>
materialistic in this scenario?<br/>
<br/>
***(decisions are hard for her because of her anxiety disorder). ***<br/>
<br/>
Decisions are hard for lots of people who don&#39;t have anxiety disorder. <br/>
Decisions might be hard for her because she doesn&#39;t want to face what you <br/>
will say about her decision.   Or because she feels pressure from you, <br/>
subtle or overt, to make a different decision from the one she really wants <br/>
to make.<br/>
<br/>
***I was thinking of allowance maybe. I don&#39;t know.***<br/>
<br/>
If you have money to give an allowance then it seems you could have just <br/>
purchased the costume.<br/>
<br/>
My son (usually) gets half my paycheck now that I&#39;m working.  I&#39;m working to <br/>
pay vet expenses that our budget didn&#39;t easily absorb and for some little <br/>
extra money for Dylan.  So when his dad gets paid we try to give him some of <br/>
that and when I get paid - with vet expenses as a consideration- he usually <br/>
gets half my check.  (I work a few days a week, so we&#39;re not talking <br/>
thousands!&lt;g&gt;)  If the vet bill is higher than half my check can cover, I <br/>
pay the bill and give Dylan the balance.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this he has money to put into his savings account, money to spend <br/>
on books or music or movies or art supplies- that&#39;s mostly what he buys <br/>
these days - money to take his mom to an occasional movie.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before I was working we tried to give him at least fifty dollars a month. <br/>
That was based on the kinds of things he wanted to purchase.  Video games, <br/>
books and cd&#39;s are more expensive than the things I used to want to buy when <br/>
I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
An allowance should be a reasonable amount, a &quot;living wage&quot; based on the <br/>
kinds of things the kid wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071335376">i dont have to origional email to refer back to however there were a few <br/>
things i wanted to say.<br/>
I dont know if i would have bought the new costume or not.  Given our <br/>
current (and not changing anytime soon) income i could not have bought it, <br/>
however, when i tell our kids we cant get something when we are shopping or <br/>
atleast not that day, i am not planning on buying ALOT of other stuff and <br/>
going out to lunch.  Saying sorry we cant afford that today cause we have to <br/>
buy ALL this other stuff and go to lunch anywhere you want sounds like an <br/>
excuse (even if somewhat true) to a kid.  Typically when we go out I let the <br/>
kids know exactly what we are going for.  If they really like something we <br/>
talk about coming back next month or the next day or perhaps giving up <br/>
eating out or some other compremise.  My kids are still young enough that a <br/>
trip to the dollar store helps fill the need something but i know that <br/>
doesnt work as they get older.  That being said NOONE in our family gets to <br/>
just go to the store and buy something very often cause we trully cant <br/>
afford it.  It we want something my dh and I talk about it , where it will <br/>
be bought, when etc.  and that is true for almost all purchases including <br/>
books, movies, kitchen appliences, tools, etc... They have rarely seen us <br/>
just go in a store and buy something cause it looks interesting or fun cause <br/>
we trully cant afford it.  That being said I think it is easier in someways <br/>
to accept, &quot;not today&quot; from us.<br/>
Sometimes just telling the child that yes, i understand you really want this <br/>
and yes it looks cool and then figuring out together away you could make it <br/>
or buy it the day after halloween or something helps.  I also think <br/>
allowance helps ALOT.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338740991">***So, are you saying I should buy her stuff to fill her emotional<br/>
needs?  ***<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly.   If you deny her things she feels are important you&#39;ll be <br/>
making the hole bigger.  It&#39;s not about the stuff.  The stuff isn&#39;t the <br/>
issue.  The issue is her need, but in denying the stuff you make the need <br/>
greater.   When she feels emotionally fulfilled, and when she&#39;s had more <br/>
experience with getting what she needs, emotionally and materialistically, <br/>
she&#39;ll be able to see the difference.  She won&#39;t feel the &quot;need&quot; for <br/>
*things* like she does now.  But that takes time and can only be done on <br/>
*her* schedule.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why your personal attention and involvement is the other side of the <br/>
coin.  Your involvement is more important than the stuff. Personal attention <br/>
from you is what she&#39;s really in need of.<br/>
<br/>
***I do.***<br/>
<br/>
It might not be enough.   Sometimes it can feel like we&#39;re giving an giving <br/>
and it should be enough, but when another person has a need only they can <br/>
determine what the right amount of personal time and attention is enough. <br/>
Your daughter might need more than your giving.  She won&#39;t get filled up, <br/>
emotionally, if her needs aren&#39;t being met.  Spend more time with her.<br/>
<br/>
***Those are pretty big assumtions.  ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Trouble making decisions&quot; is an assumption too.    &quot;Trouble because of an <br/>
anxiety disorder&quot; is an assumption.  Lots and lots of people are not easy <br/>
making decisions.  But with kids especially, the more opportunity they have <br/>
to make decisions that receive the support of a parent the more comfortable <br/>
they get and the more they come to trust their own judgment.  There are <br/>
adults who struggle making decisions.  It&#39;s not fair to expect a little <br/>
girl, who has much less experience making decisions,  to have mastered it.<br/>
<br/>
***My dh & I talked about giving her $7 a week for an allowance.  The<br/>
costume cost $30.  You do the math.***<br/>
<br/>
Seven dollars a week won&#39;t help her get a costume she wants by Halloween. <br/>
How much do you spend a week on the things you want?<br/>
Thirty dollars is a pretty expensive costume but I bet she could have <br/>
enjoyed it a hundred times that amount if she&#39;d received it joyfully and if <br/>
you&#39;d been enthusiastic for and with her.   You could have made the <br/>
allowance retroactive, back five weeks, then she could have gotten the <br/>
costume.  She could have taken a draw on the next five weeks.  She could <br/>
have paid you back from her allowance over a few months.  Lots of <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
If your child already has anxiety issues you must know that a visit to a <br/>
doctor or therapist will cost you more than thirty dollars.<br/>
<br/>
***Thanks, Deb, for the helpful, kind advice.***<br/>
<br/>
It would be worth it, for your daughters sake, to just be objective and look <br/>
at the things *you* have control over and see where you might make a <br/>
different choice next time.   If I had said , &quot;yeah, she&#39;s selfish and <br/>
materialistic&quot; would you have thought that was helpful and kind?   I was <br/>
thinking of your daughter, and what it must feel like to be little, and <br/>
needy, and have your mom thinking badly of you on top of all that.<br/>

<br/>
So, are you saying I should buy her stuff to fill her emotional<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat. She probably needs more of your *time* and is filling that <br/>
need with stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
***  From your daughters point of view it looked like you got<br/>

I didn&#39;t get anything.  We left the store with nothing.  Not that<br/>

for supplys for my dh&#39;s bussiness, Christmas presents,<br/>
Hats/gloves/boots for my daughter, and a project that dd & I were<br/>
going to make togeather to give as a gift.  That makes me<br/>
materialistic?  I&#39;m confused.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But you went with the intent on buying LOTS of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
When adults buy stuff---seriously, even laundry detergent and toilet <br/>
paper---it&#39;s ADULT STUFF. Kid stuff always comes in second and only IF <br/>
the adult is generous enough to give TO the child. A child will watch <br/>
her parent spend $120 on groceries, but refuse to get her that $4 book. <br/>
From a child&#39;s PoV that just doesn&#39;t seem fair.<br/>
<br/>
So you left without buying anything, but your intent was to buy <br/>
Christmas presents, winter clothes, office supplies, and project <br/>
materials. Couple of hundred bucks? For *you* (we&#39;re looking at this <br/>
 from the CHILD&#39;s Point of view, remember!) So why would a $30 costume <br/>
seem so out of line? She already had a costume, I understand---but <br/>
don&#39;t you have plenty of office supplies, and project stuff and winter <br/>
clothes? From HER PoV?? What&#39;s just ONE more costume?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Decisions might be hard for her because she doesn&#39;t want to face<br/>
what you  will say about her decision.   Or because she feels pressure <br/>

you,  subtle or overt, to make a different decision from the one she<br/>
really wants  to make.***<br/>
<br/>
Those are pretty big assumtions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, but we&#39;re only going on what you write. Plus, Deb&#39;s pretty <br/>
astute! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You also wrote that she wrote &quot;I hate you&quot; on her pants. If she&#39;s not <br/>
comfortable saying that aloud, she may have issues facing you with <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*** If you have money to give an allowance then it seems you could<br/>
have just  purchased the costume.***<br/>
<br/>
My dh & I talked about giving her $7 a week for an allowance.  The<br/>
costume cost $30.  You do the math.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
$7 x 4 would almost cover it! A month&#39;s allowance? Could she have <br/>
gotten an advance?<br/>
<br/>
But if you can afford $28/month, couldn&#39;t you also afford to buy the <br/>
costume?<br/>
