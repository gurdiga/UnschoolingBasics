<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695022002">We went and saw POTC2 tonight and one of the previews was for an<br/>
upcoming movie this fall called Accepted.  It&#39;s about 2 guys who<br/>
(through a serious of unfortnate events) open up their own college.<br/>
The kids study what they want, when they want and how they want.  All<br/>
my kids were nearly screaming saying, &quot;OMG it&#39;s Unschooling<br/>
University!&quot;  It looks really cute.  Oh and Pirates was fantastic, now<br/>
we just have to wait until next May when the third one comes out!<br/>
