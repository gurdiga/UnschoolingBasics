Good question.  I guess im just concerned that she is so overwhelmed  that <br/>
she is just shutting down and how do I help her yet not make matters  worse?  I <br/>
wasnt and am not bothered by her not reading at all but yet am a  bit <br/>
concerned that she no longer wants me to read to her. She was before cooking  with me <br/>
and wanting to help and now she will only help if I do all the measuring  and <br/>
she just mixes which is fine..... I just dont want to be missing something  <br/>
that I should be doing.  This could all be normal and that would be  great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629964830">Maybe there is an underlying problem to her headaches.  Maybe she <br/>
needs glasses, or maybe she just does feel overwhelmed with the <br/>
reading or being read to that it is stressing her.  She is probably <br/>
entering puberty and that could be the basis for her stress and <br/>
feelings of overwhelm.<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.raisingadaughter.com/index.php?">http://www.raisingadaughter.com/index.php?</a><br/>
option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=32 - It talks about puberty <br/>
and the different &quot;steps&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If it really is that she is uninterested, then she is uninterested.  <br/>
We did a couple of really great unit studies quite a few years back <br/>
that interested my kids.  My kids liked something and we poured <br/>
ourselves into it.  They still do, but in the older levels now.<br/>
<br/>
Stuff we did:<br/>
<br/>
Little House on the Prairie, lots of cooking, sewing, reading the <br/>
stories, watching the movies; lots of great information at the <br/>
library; or<br/>
<br/>
Puppets.  We once took an old refrigerator box and made a puppet <br/>
theatre out of it.  We painted it with some leftover paint, cut out <br/>
an area at the top for them to do their puppet acts while being in <br/>
the box, made curtains, made some puppets and then my kids wrote cute <br/>
little plays to perform for us.<br/>
<br/>
I have items laying around the house that my kids are interested in.  <br/>
Rock and Fossil books, magnifying glasses, rocks, jewlery making <br/>
books, comic books, paper and paint, lots of craft items, cardboard, <br/>
etc.  My youngest is really big into collecting comic books right <br/>
now.  He has bought some comic books, checks out their prices on -<br/>
ebay and in a comic book price guide and also tells me which ones he <br/>
is looking for.  Neopets is another good internet site for children.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I wouldn&#39;t stress yourself about it too much. It took my <br/>
kids a long time to deschool and now there is no stopping them.  Now, <br/>
I can&#39;t afford everything they want to do and learn about.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about deschooling too long, but I was<br/>
told one month per every year your child was in<br/>
school.  I am still new to this, but I do know that my<br/>
daughter would stress over math (it&#39;s been hard for<br/>
her), and I would get calls from school to come and<br/>
get her, because she had a stomach ache.  Stress does<br/>
really wierd things to your body, and my daughter<br/>
would get stomach aches from the stress/anxiety of<br/>
doing math.  It might just be stress/anxiety.  You<br/>
might have to give up on the reading for a while, and<br/>
come back to it, when she gets more interest in it. <br/>
Sooner or later the head aches will disappear, and she<br/>
will be ready to read again.  (or she may need<br/>
glasses.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!!<br/>

  So my question is can you deschool too long?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Like everything else: it takes as long as it takes. Somepeople are more <br/>
sensitive than others.<br/>

<br/>
My  daughter who is 9 though gets<br/>
horrible headaches when anything is too  schooly  for her. She even <br/>
lately has<br/>
been telling me she doesnt want me to  read to her because she feels <br/>
like im<br/>
pushing her to read and she just cant take  the stress.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then she&#39;s right. Back off. Do nothing schooly or even remotely <br/>
schooly. Just FUN stiff. Let her know you trust her. She&#39;ll be there <br/>
when she gets there. Not a moment before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656717803">Just leave stuff available for her - paper, fun markers, glitter glue, <br/>
whatever looks fun and interesting - NO STRINGS ATTACHED.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you do whatever interests you and invite her along - maybe get <br/>
some candle making stuff or soap making or candy making or knitting or <br/>
wood carving or whatever YOU enjoy - and go do it, again NO STRINGS <br/>
ATTACHED. Rather than waiting for her to &#39;move on&#39;, get doing yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Third thing I wanted to say was broaden your scope of what &#39;counts&#39; as <br/>
reading. Odds are she is reading more than you are noticing because <br/>
you&#39;re focused on book reading. What is it she ENJOYS doing? Odds are <br/>
that somewhere along the way, there are words involved (videogame <br/>
instructions, shopping catalogs, whatever). It&#39;s unlikely she&#39;s <br/>
spending 24/7 staring at the wall - so ask her what you can do <br/>
with/for her (including just getting out of her way for a while) - <br/>
would she really really like to get outdoors more, go for walks in the <br/>
woods, or whatever? or listen to different types of music? or spend <br/>
time with animals? or learn to sew or knit or carve fancy pumpkins? <br/>
Whatever it is, be a resource to get those things - you&#39;ve got the car <br/>
keys and credit cards but let her lead - you push the cart, let her <br/>
fill it. Avoid the temptation to jump in and take over the idea (by <br/>
going out and getting a bunch of how to books and supplies and setting <br/>
it all up and then pushing her at it) - just sit back and give her <br/>
space and time. If she feels like she&#39;s being pushed, even if you <br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;re pushing, you&#39;re pushing as far as she&#39;s concerned. <br/>
Maybe find a time to just go out for coffee together or something and <br/>
talk - being in the car is great for talking because you don&#39;t have to <br/>
look at the other person the whole time. I know when I was growing up, <br/>
Mom would often approach difficult topics in the car because it was <br/>
easier to talk then - no outside interference (except driving of <br/>
course but no phones, TV, siblings, etc) and maybe pose a &#39;fun&#39; <br/>
question - do you ever think people will live on Mars? what would you <br/>
do with 24 hrs to spend a million dollars? where in the world would <br/>
you most like to live? to vacation? Who (living or dead) would you <br/>
most like to have dinner with? what would be an ideal vacation? Or, <br/>
maybe, suggest you play &quot;the story game&quot; (as DS calls it) - each <br/>
person contributes a sentence then the next person goes so you build a <br/>
story one sentence at a time. It can take all sorts of wild turns and <br/>
get really funny or serious or spooky or whatever. A few years ago, we <br/>
had a multi chapter story of &quot;King Hiam&quot; going with DS - he&#39;d remember <br/>
where we left off and we&#39;d continue from there next time we were in <br/>
the car for a time. King Hiam decided that all kids had to go to <br/>
school but there was a gentle loving family out in the middle of the <br/>
forest who didn&#39;t send their kids to school (DS&#39; idea). When the king <br/>
found out, he went to see them, and in the end (many chapters later) <br/>
King Hiam rescinded his rule and let families choose what they wanted <br/>
to do, including unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Are the books you are reading from her &quot;schooly&quot; type books?  Non<br/>
fiction or really factual historical fiction?  Does she dislike all<br/>
books, or just some of them?<br/>
<br/>
My son, 12, wasn&#39;t much into being read to as a little kid but he is<br/>
really into it now, and has been for 3 or 4 years.  Since he was 6 or<br/>
7, he has selected everything that I read to him.  People may find<br/>
that extreme, but he waved aside nearly everything I suggested and<br/>
insisted on his own choices.  As an unschooler, I respect that he<br/>
knows what he likes.<br/>
