<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730773477">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 3 years and I&#39;ve finally<br/>
decided to go with unschooling after much<br/>
deliberation.  My daugher 7, has never been to school<br/>
but I did teach her to read, write and do math in her<br/>
younger years.  There was always so much time left for<br/>
her that she has not been negatively impacted. <br/>
Learning to her is a joy.  OTH, my son was in the<br/>
system for from 3-8 and then I schooled at home with<br/>
him too, never settling in on anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fortunate to live in Pensacola near Ren, who :-(<br/>
will be moving.  Anyway, she has been a wonderful<br/>
inspiration to me in not just unschooling but with<br/>
another area that is very emotional for me.  She<br/>
accepted me with open and loving arms and has been the<br/>
single most factor in my decision to unschool.  For<br/>
the past few days, I&#39;ve been at her new website,<br/>
pouring over the wealth of information.  It is my hope<br/>
to become as wonderful and relaxed about unschooling<br/>
as you all are.<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, it is myself that needs to overcome<br/>
things and especially about my son.  I&#39;ve been a<br/>
&quot;worrier&quot; all of my life and it is eating &quot;me&quot; up to<br/>
see him not really be a go getter.  However, I know it<br/>
is ME that needs to change.  He is loving Harry Potter<br/>
right now so I am not complaining!  He used to hate<br/>
reading and he has made it through the first 4 books<br/>
already in less than a month, he eats those books up. <br/>
He generally though is not very ambitious.  He&#39;ll be<br/>
excited to do something and the second a little<br/>
thought is required, he gets a defeated attitude.  I<br/>
try to be supportive but he&#39;d just rather not even<br/>
try.  Of course, this is my main concern because I<br/>
can&#39;t help but see this going into adulthood. <br/>
However, I love him where he is at but am worried<br/>
about his future.  Also, I do realize that this has A<br/>
LOT to do with being schooled much of his life.<br/>
<br/>
Today, on Ren&#39;s site I read that if a child has<br/>
choices but still isn&#39;t happy then something is wrong.<br/>
 I asked Zachary if he was happy and he said yes.  We<br/>
spoke about how he has freedom to choose what to learn<br/>
and he got so excited about having a chemistry set. In<br/>
the past, I&#39;ve &quot;tried&quot; to unschool but unsuccessfully,<br/>
I&#39;d panic and we&#39;d start in with a schoolish type<br/>
approach.  Lately though, I was reminded of Zak and<br/>
how much he learned about Egypt and it wasn&#39;t because<br/>
I taught him anything, he asked for things about Egypt<br/>
and we got em&#39;.  I haven&#39;t a clue why I panic other<br/>
than because &quot;they don&#39;t know what the school kids<br/>
know.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest and STUPIDEST stumbling block to<br/>
unschooling has been concern about me dieng.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know why, I just do.  I think &quot;if I die what will<br/>
happen to the kids?&quot;  DH will have to work and they&#39;d<br/>
never make it into school, I&#39;d have failed them and<br/>
only made things harder.  My mom was a HUGE &quot;what<br/>
iffer&quot; and sadly, this same thing has been the worst<br/>
plague in my life.  My children are totally unaware of<br/>
my what &quot;iffing&quot; because I do not want that habit to<br/>
rub off on them, they are clueless to my concerns<br/>
about this area.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I realize that that is a little deep, but I&#39;ve<br/>
been watching the posts for a few days and see much<br/>
wisdom here.  Maybe somebody knows someone who has the<br/>
same concerns and would be able to share how they have<br/>
overcome them, regardless of how petty they may seem. <br/>
:-)  Looking forward to learning more about this<br/>
wonderful path of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely<br/>
~Sandy Winn<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a what-iffer too - I&#39;ll be driving along and think &quot;what if that <br/>
18 wheeler passing me suddenly starts to swerve out of control?&quot; all <br/>
that kind of stuff. BUT instead of stewing, I -plan-. I&#39;m the sole <br/>
income in our family and DH is at home with DS (sounds similar to <br/>
your situation). So, I make sure (a) that I do what I can as far as <br/>
general health goes (b) that we have insurance that will cover them <br/>
for 6 months to a year&#39;s worth of expenses (mortgage, utilities, <br/>
food, etc) so that they can take some time to explore their options <br/>
rather than a panicked jump into something. For instance, even <br/>
though our mortgage has a penalty if you move in less than 10 yrs <br/>
(through the state, they want to build &#39;stable&#39; neighborhoods) BUT <br/>
if there is a death or divorce, that is waived (if I remember <br/>
correctly). So, they could find someplace else to live (cut expenses <br/>
a bit perhaps) and extend that time. DH and I have discussed things <br/>
as well and it is likely that my guys would be able to arrange <br/>
something - and it gets more and more likely and easier as DS gets <br/>
older. He&#39;s 7 now but it won&#39;t be long until he&#39;s 12 or 13 and can <br/>
stay home by himself or go to a friend&#39;s house for the day or <br/>
something like that. Also, one of my SIL&#39;s (DH&#39;s middle sister) is <br/>
the daycare provider for our nephew and a couple of other children, <br/>
so we could possibly arrange that as well. And, it would be perhaps <br/>
possible that DH could actually take over my job (he has the skill <br/>
set to do it) - it&#39;s a pretty family friendly company and DS could <br/>
come to work with DH or DH could work some from home and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m (longwindedly) saying is instead of worrying about <br/>
how they&#39;ll do in school if you die, make plans that would give them <br/>
and DH -options- should that happen so they can take time and decide <br/>
IF school is where they -want- to be or if there needs to be other <br/>
arrangements. It&#39;s not an either/or black and white situation. There <br/>
are lots of gray areas. And the older the kids get, the more options <br/>
open up.<br/>

<br/>
Honestlt, I think this is a very valid worry... I worry about the same  <br/>
thing. How will they cope? I had a majorly rough time after the birth of my  <br/>
youngest, so much so that I was having nightmares of my own funeral. Yeah,  morbid, <br/>
and terrifying. Thankfully, THOSE have dwindled down to maybe once a  month, <br/>
but the worry is still there.<br/>
I think the worry part is natural. I am also a big worrier. I worry about  my <br/>
husband commuting, at work... I worry when the kids are out of my sight... I  <br/>
just deal with it. My husband humors me though, calls me on his breaks, on <br/>
his  way home. <br/>
I&#39;ve thought about talking to a professional about it, but, once again, I&#39;m  <br/>
worried they&#39;ll think I&#39;m psychotic (I&#39;m not, really) and want me on meds or  <br/>
whatever. So, I just try to push all negative thoughts of worry out the second <br/>
 they try to weasel in. And, instead, rely on my gut feelings. If something <br/>
truly  is bothering me, then I will call whoever, find whoever, do something to <br/>
ease my  concerns.<br/>
(((hugs)))<br/>
Not a huge help, but at least you&#39;re not alone...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980777157">Welcome Sandy!!!  Glad you are here!  Your children are wonderful.....<br/>
you have no problem, you are doing an awesome job with them!<br/>
Looks like it is going to rain tomorrow for &quot;pool&quot; time, huh?  Thanks to <br/>
Hurricane<br/>
Rita!!  Dakota and I went to the beach today and walked the <br/>
pier.....fascinating!<br/>
The waves were crashing up under the bottom of the pier, we got soaked.  <br/>
The wind<br/>
was so strong that when we got caught in the rain, it hurt like heck!!  <br/>
Stinging rain and<br/>
stinging sand blowing all around....hard to believe the storm isn&#39;t even <br/>
coming here!<br/>
Let me know about tomorrow......and welcome to this group.  I learn a <br/>
lot from this group.<br/>
Oh yeah, one more thing....I have had the same thoughts about <br/>
dying....what if something happens<br/>
to me?  Will Dakota be put in school or allowed to continue <br/>
unschooling?  I have gotten my mother<br/>
more on board than my husband....will let them &quot;fight it out&quot; LOL!<br/>
