<div>I think this is very true -- and no matter how you homeschool, it&#39;s a big transition for anyone used to the school telling you what to do all the time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have to resist &quot;doing&quot; for grownups sometimes, too.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have a private school for hsers called Florida Unschoolers. It&#39;s one of the paperwork options here in Fla. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some new FUers ask me, repeatedly, whether there is a form to fill out to register, what form they should use to report attendance, how they should schedule their &quot;school year.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is a big adjustment for a lot of people to hear: &quot;There is no registration form -- send me the info in a lettter or note, there is no one attendance format, make up your own, there is no one school year, make up your own (180 day min) schedule or lack thereof, report what makes sense, learning happens all the time, this is just the paperwork, it will barely reflect the reality of your hsing.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be easier, I think&nbsp;to myself, to just go ahead and make up a form for registration, make up a standard attendance form, tell folks what my school&#39;s school year is. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I think it is better to leave all those decisions with the families and not get into the whole &quot;I am in charge of your schedule&quot; thing. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is about ownership and responsibility for your own time and schedule -- and, imo, if the families have to think about it, even just for a minute, rather than just filling in a form I provide, it will be more &quot;theirs.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And I think that&#39;s a good thing. :)</div>

<div>But for school-at-homer (doh!) kids, it can be even worse!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Schooled kids can at least come home to get away from a creepy teacher. 
Kids whose mom is teacher and dad is principal have no where to turn.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They also have little to no say in what they are going to learn. Abeka, 
Sonlight, Bob Jones---when they&#39;re tied to a curriculum, they&#39;re still being 
told what to do, how to do it, and what time period to do it in.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&#39;s sad. But it&#39;s true.
