<div id="ygrps-yiv-636434054">Hi. I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Home Education&#39; magazine for years and always meant to join an unschooling group online, I am finally here.  I need some support and ideas.  No one else near me unschools, and I am coming up against hostility to the point where I have to respond with proof that our children are learning.<br/>
<br/>
A brief history of our homeschool:<br/>
<br/>
Our girls were both adopted, both of them have trauma history, both of them were difficult children.  2 years ago, when they were 9 and 10, they finally began to settle down to where I could get them to cooperate with me.  Before that, obviously, we were 100% unschooled.  At ages 9 and 10, neither of them were reading and math was difficult for both of them, even though I&#39;d been talking about math in our daily lives for years.  They&#39;ve known phonics since they were 5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.  <br/>
<br/>
Unless you&#39;ve experienced raising children who have trauma history, it is difficult to understand what it is like.  We have family and friends who feel we were doing a poor job parenting because we didn&#39;t have control of our children like they thought we should.  My girls&#39; emotional health has always been top priority for me and when I found an expert in parenting children with trauma history to follow, it helped a great deal.  My children still have some issues, but for most part, they are doing well emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
So, at 9 and 10, I took them to an eye doctor, looking for vision therapy since we were at the point where I felt like I could get the girls to work with me.  This eye doctor was no help at all.  So like a true unschooler, I set out to learn all I could about vision therapy.  We ended up traveling 10 hours to New York City to consult with the best optometrist I could find.  I learned much through him and he did help the girls, but it was a very expensive undertaking and it was difficult to get to him.  I&#39;ve now found a doctor who works with vision training an hour from home and because of our experience with the New York doctor, I am confidant that my children are getting the best I can get for them.  During our recent visit with this optometrist, I looked at my children sitting very cooperatively in his office and though &quot;Wow, he can&#39;t tell at all because of their excellent behavior the behavioral difficulties we&#39;ve been through.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve worked with brain gym, I&#39;ve read books on teaching children who&#39;ve had difficulty learning to read and we&#39;ve followed the method set out in the book &quot;Reading Clinic&quot; most days throughout the school year. And now, just as the girls have turned 11 and 12, they are finally reading.  Still beginners, but reading.  In just the last 8 weeks, my twelve yo has made great strides.  My 11 yo has is where her sister had been as she began to read.<br/>
<br/>
The girls are finally catching on to arithmetic also. Again, daily throughout the school year, I&#39;ve worked with them. For several months we followed a workbook, then, when it became a real chore daily to get them to do their math, I started tailoring my own worksheets for them based on their level and using math books as a guide to be certain we were covering everything such as fractions, decimals, geometry and all the math vocabulary that children who do the workbooks are exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve written this, I realize I probably don&#39;t have to defend myself to all of you, as you already understand that children learn as they are ready.  We live in Ohio, where I can either report standardized test scores to the superintendent, or have a certified teacher sign that the child is working up to her potential, which is what I&#39;ve done in the past.  I&#39;ve sent a summary of what we&#39;ve done for the year to a teacher whose children were homeschooled.  I&#39;ve been very honest in the reports and he has always signed it for me, but with this hostility, we are not comfortable asking him to sign it without closely following what the girls are learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a teacher who is certified in Ohio who understands unschooling and that some children read late to work with us.  I&#39;ve also contacted a tutoring center, who I would have tried before if it weren&#39;t for the cost and my confidence that my girls will read and do math just fine as they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, and please offer feedback.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know if this is the kind of feedback that you want, but  <br/>
it&#39;s useful for others beginning unschooling to read.<br/>
<br/>
I would say your girls are not developmentally ready to read or do  <br/>
arithmetic. There are still areas in their brains that need to mature.  <br/>
And that can only come with age.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s understandable to assume that  one difference causes  <br/>
everything that seems out of the norm. But that&#39;s not necessarily so.  <br/>
It helps to read about the greater variety of norm among unschooled  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids, schooled or unschooled, have reading click for them in the  <br/>
6-8 range. But not being developmentally ready to read at 9 and 10 is  <br/>
not unusual. Not being ready until 12 or 13 is also not unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids who can&#39;t read go about their lives, learning just  <br/>
fine in ways that are more natural to their brains. Hands on.  <br/>
Listening. Picking up clues from pictures. Body movements. Taste and  <br/>
smells. All are important ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled kids who can&#39;t read are treated as though they were broken in  <br/>
need of fixing. And they&#39;re subjected to all sorts of lessons to get  <br/>
them to do what they supposedly haven&#39;t figured out yet. One of the  <br/>
side effects is some can end up feeling stupid. Or, to protect  <br/>
themselves, feeling reading is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually most of the schooled kids read. So it seems like the  <br/>
instruction worked.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, the unschooled kids also eventually read without the instruction.<br/>
<br/>
The only common factor is they&#39;ve both gotten older.<br/>
<br/>
(Schools focus on reading not because it&#39;s the best way to learn  <br/>
everything but because it&#39;s the cheapest way to mass educate: one  <br/>
teacher can make 30 or more kids read what she wants them to learn and  <br/>
then quiz them on their understanding. It would be too expensive, need  <br/>
too many teachers, to allow each child to learn in the ways that are  <br/>
best for them. And since the focus is on reading, what kids learn is  <br/>
focused on what&#39;s best acquired through reading, rather than on what  <br/>
it&#39;s best to learn. (Which is highly individual anyway!)<br/>
<br/>
Reading is much much more than a mechanical process of applying  <br/>
knowledge to print -- despite what schools keep trying to get kids to  <br/>
do. Despite the fact that it *seems* to make sense that reading is  <br/>
just sounding out letters and squishing them together into words.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will get phonics because that&#39;s how their brains work. But  <br/>
they don&#39;t need phonics to figure out reading. They will figure out  <br/>
the rules that help with whatever they&#39;re puzzling out as they go  <br/>
along. And they&#39;ll do it without realizing they&#39;re doing it ;-) They  <br/>
will absorb an understanding by reading and getting real feedback  <br/>
(whether the meaning they&#39;ve pulled from the black squiggles makes  <br/>
sense). Just as kids absorb an understanding of speech by speaking, by  <br/>
getting feedback, by absorbing the interesting (to them) parts of  <br/>
what&#39;s going on around them.<br/>
<br/>
But for lots of kids, phonics is a layer of confusion between them and  <br/>
the words. Many kids absorb words whole. It sounds inefficient! But  <br/>
it&#39;s how their brains work. Eventually they will see patterns within  <br/>
their collection, but they learn best by absorbing chunks.<br/>
<br/>
And even as adults it&#39;s rare when we read letter by letter. How do you  <br/>
figure out how to pronounce:<br/>
<br/>
misodoctakleidist<br/>
phaneromaniac<br/>
xanthoderm<br/>
<br/>
I bet you didn&#39;t tackle them letter by letter. You broke them into  <br/>
chunks you recognize.<br/>
<br/>
And from tales of unschooled kids reading, it&#39;s a huge mistake to  <br/>
assume that approach is advanced stuff and kids need the process  <br/>
dumbed down. Kids figure out the reading code in whatever way makes  <br/>
sense to them.<br/>
<br/>
As for arithmetic, well I&#39;ve had huge rants about how schools teach  <br/>
math ;-) It&#39;s backward to how we naturally learn. It&#39;s teaching the  <br/>
abstract before someone has a grasp how how things work in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I just wrote about how my daughter picked up all she needed to know  <br/>
about math by playing video games (and other encounters in real life):<br/>

Hi. I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Home Education&#39; magazine for years and always meant to <br/>
join an unschooling group online, I am finally here.  I need some support and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579430724">Joyce!  I love you.  I needed this today!  My daughter, who loves learning, is 6 and I unschool her.  She is beginning to read but she often looks at the first letter and guesses the rest of the word.  I am fine with her pace, except that my ex-husband had her tested without telling me and the test shows she went from a first grade level last year to a a K level this year.  (What does that say about our school testing system?).  Anyway, his solution is to put her in school which neither she nor I want.  He hated school and dreads that homeschooling is keeping her &quot;behind&quot;.  I struggle to find the words to explain to him that she really is doing very well and this 4 hour impromptu test is not reflective of her learning, nor is it fair to her.  I try to impart that she will read when she is ready, and school is not going to help this.  I feel like I need a sheet of facts to present to him to &quot;fight&quot; my cause.   He compares her to a friend whose child read at age 3, and to older kids we know.<br/>

It helps to read about the greater variety of norm among unschooled <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids, schooled or unschooled, have reading click for them in the <br/>
6-8 range. But not being developmentally ready to read at 9 and 10 is <br/>
not unusual. Not being ready until 12 or 13 is also not unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids who can&#39;t read go about their lives, learning just <br/>
fine in ways that are more natural to their brains. Hands on. <br/>
Listening. Picking up clues from pictures. Body movements. Taste and <br/>
smells. All are important ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled kids who can&#39;t read are treated as though they were broken in <br/>
need of fixing. And they&#39;re subjected to all sorts of lessons to get <br/>
them to do what they supposedly haven&#39;t figured out yet. One of the <br/>
side effects is some can end up feeling stupid. Or, to protect <br/>
themselves, feeling reading is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually most of the schooled kids read. So it seems like the <br/>
instruction worked.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, the unschooled kids also eventually read without the instruction.<br/>
<br/>
The only common factor is they&#39;ve both gotten older.<br/>
<br/>
(Schools focus on reading not because it&#39;s the best way to learn <br/>
everything but because it&#39;s the cheapest way to mass educate: one <br/>
teacher can make 30 or more kids read what she wants them to learn and <br/>
then quiz them on their understanding. It would be too expensive, need <br/>
too many teachers, to allow each child to learn in the ways that are <br/>
best for them. And since the focus is on reading, what kids learn is <br/>
focused on what&#39;s best acquired through reading, rather than on what <br/>
it&#39;s best to learn. (Which is highly individual anyway!)<br/>
<br/>
Reading is much much more than a mechanical process of applying <br/>
knowledge to print -- despite what schools keep trying to get kids to <br/>
do. Despite the fact that it *seems* to make sense that reading is <br/>
just sounding out letters and squishing them together into words.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will get phonics because that&#39;s how their brains work. But <br/>
they don&#39;t need phonics to figure out reading. They will figure out <br/>
the rules that help with whatever they&#39;re puzzling out as they go <br/>
along. And they&#39;ll do it without realizing they&#39;re doing it ;-) They <br/>
will absorb an understanding by reading and getting real feedback <br/>
(whether the meaning they&#39;ve pulled from the black squiggles makes <br/>
sense). Just as kids absorb an understanding of speech by speaking, by <br/>
getting feedback, by absorbing the interesting (to them) parts of <br/>
what&#39;s going on around them.<br/>
<br/>
But for lots of kids, phonics is a layer of confusion between them and <br/>
the words. Many kids absorb words whole. It sounds inefficient! But <br/>
it&#39;s how their brains work. Eventually they will see patterns within <br/>
their collection, but they learn best by absorbing chunks.<br/>
<br/>
And even as adults it&#39;s rare when we read letter by letter. How do you <br/>
figure out how to pronounce:<br/>
<br/>
misodoctakleidist<br/>
phaneromaniac<br/>
xanthoderm<br/>
<br/>
I bet you didn&#39;t tackle them letter by letter. You broke them into <br/>
chunks you recognize.<br/>
<br/>
And from tales of unschooled kids reading, it&#39;s a huge mistake to <br/>
assume that approach is advanced stuff and kids need the process <br/>
dumbed down. Kids figure out the reading code in whatever way makes <br/>
sense to them.<br/>
<br/>
As for arithmetic, well I&#39;ve had huge rants about how schools teach <br/>
math ;-) It&#39;s backward to how we naturally learn. It&#39;s teaching the <br/>
abstract before someone has a grasp how how things work in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I just wrote about how my daughter picked up all she needed to know <br/>
about math by playing video games (and other encounters in real life):<br/>

I do understand unschooling, and it is what I would be doing if it weren&#39;t<br/>
for the hostility we are getting because our children are 11 and 12 and<br/>
barely reading.  How can I defend myself to others when it looks to them<br/>
like we are getting nowhere?<br/>

Naomi offers phone counseling and also on one of her cd&#39;s she speaks specifically about reading. I know it can be extremely stressful considering what and how we do things as homeschoolers versus what the majority or conventional thinkers say. Naomi has a cd set called Trusting Our Children Trusting Ourselves. Excellent. Wish I could offer more. Stay encouraged.                Andrea<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are in compliance with the local educational laws, then you are not committing educational neglect. Double-check with your evaluator to make sure alllll your ducks are in a row in that regard. Is all your paperwork up to date? Everything you need on file? Check tangetial stuff like immunization records (or waivers) too, just to be sure. And if people threaten you Tell them &quot;I assure you I am fully incompliance with homeschooling regulations.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If you are neglecting your children in some other way that&#39;s generally and issue for the local variation of Child Services. If you&#39;re concerned in that regard, call Child Services yourself. Let them know you homeschool and some neighbors have raised an eyebrow - don&#39;t go overboard with information, but do express your concerns about the potential of a wrongful or malicious report. <br/>
<br/>
You might also consider the value of &quot;labling&quot; your children - telling people they &quot;have special needs&quot; or &quot;have learning delays&quot;. If they have any diagnoses, consider mentioning them. It&#39;s a mixed bag in terms of benefits and costs, for sure, but those kinds of statements can go a long way in terms of getting random busybodies off your back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3977726">What comes to mind is how every plant grows and blooms in its own way, at its pace. A flower does not need to grow at the rate of a tree or vice versa. Both have their own value and beauty. Some plants take a long time to germinate and sprout, and some go fast. I recently learned that bamboo needs a long time to prepare itself, and once it is started, it can grow up to 1 meter per day. Don&#39;t worry if your girls are blooming later than what&#39;s considered the average. It doesn&#39;t mean a thing.<br/>
<br/>
I did not have unschooling as a child. At school, I realized that I read more slowly than my classmates. And I was much distracted in class or when I was studying. I competely lost confidence and my love for learning and reading. When I was older, I was advised to undergo neurological examination and I got some stupid treatment with a cold high diploma docter. Now I still read slowly, but I learned that it has a purpose. I can only fully commit myself to reading what interests me, or what I find important, regarding the difficulty level. And what I read is much in depth and not superficial quick reading.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to add, not to get too much occupied with looking up docters and experts to investigate eyes and brains. If they need simple basic things like glasses, get them glasses. But apart from that, your girls will do better without special examinations, labels and treatments. <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Second, there is a HUGE unschooling community in Ohio! HUGE! They provide LOTS of opportunities to meet other unschoolers. Look around.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
We do have a couple pockets of unschoolers in the north and some more scattered throughout the state. It depends a lot on where you are, Jill. There&#39;s a solid group in Cleveland (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NorthernOhioUnschoolers/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NorthernOhioUnschoolers/)</a> a small, but very active group in Akron (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AkronTribe/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AkronTribe/)</a> and if those aren&#39;t in your area, there is a state-based group (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolersNetworkOhio)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolersNetworkOhio)</a>. The state-based group has a lot to weed through in regards to &quot;we unschool except for...&quot; and academic unschoolers, but it is a good jumping-off point for connecting with folks who might know more local folks. The Cleveland group has a couple regular things, but is fairly quiet; there are long-time unschoolers, though. The Akron group is fairly close-knit and has periods where there is quiet spells, but is fairly active. There&#39;s a Mom&#39;s Night Out going on tonight in Fairlawn/West Akron at Applebee&#39;s, starting at 6:00 pm. You&#39;re welcome to contact me offlist, if you like (BiggWylma @ aol.com)<br/>

My extended family and some friends. The friends we&#39;ve not much seen<br/>
socially since the girls were little and these people thought we should be<br/>

educational neglect if we don&#39;t enroll them in school right away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I&#39;d say these are not &quot;friends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;friends&quot; report you to DSS, DSS must investigate; but if you are following the state&#39;s homeschooling law, you have nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d simply avoid these &quot;friends.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If all children *must* be &quot;at grade level,&quot; two-thirds of the children in each school class would be considered &quot;educationally neglected.&quot; That&#39;s why it&#39;s called compulsory *attendance*, not compulsory education or compulsory learning. There&#39;s no way a school can be sure that *all* children have a firm grasp of the material. School is set up *specifically* to target the &quot;average&quot; student. A third will be &quot;ahead;&quot; a third will be &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Homeschools can be individualized to each child. ARE individualized.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Operate your homeschool within the law, and you&#39;re fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If extended family is concerned,<br/>
1) realize that they are asking because they care for/love the children. <br/>
2) assure them that the children are progressing and that you are following state law.<br/>
3) inform them that hurrying a child means the child misses important information/learning possibilities. This is NOT a race.<br/>
4) remind them that YOU are the parents, not them.<br/>
5) know that you control who sees and interacts with the children. You can keep them from seeing the children if they insist on making your lives difficult.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling often means growing balls. ;-)<br/>

&gt; If &quot;friends&quot; report you to DSS, DSS must investigate; but if you are<br/>
&gt; following the state&#39;s homeschooling law, you have nothing to worry about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d simply avoid these &quot;friends.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If all children *must* be &quot;at grade level,&quot; two-thirds of the children in<br/>
&gt; each school class would be considered &quot;educationally neglected.&quot; That&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s called compulsory *attendance*, not compulsory education or compulsory<br/>
&gt; learning. There&#39;s no way a school can be sure that *all* children have a<br/>
&gt; firm grasp of the material. School is set up *specifically* to target the<br/>
&gt; &quot;average&quot; student. A third will be &quot;ahead;&quot; a third will be &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschools can be individualized to each child. ARE individualized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Operate your homeschool within the law, and you&#39;re fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If extended family is concerned,<br/>
&gt; 1) realize that they are asking because they care for/love the children.<br/>
&gt; 2) assure them that the children are progressing and that you are following<br/>
&gt; state law.<br/>
&gt; 3) inform them that hurrying a child means the child misses important<br/>
&gt; information/learning possibilities. This is NOT a race.<br/>
&gt; 4) remind them that YOU are the parents, not them.<br/>
&gt; 5) know that you control who sees and interacts with the children. You can<br/>
&gt; keep them from seeing the children if they insist on making your lives<br/>
&gt; difficult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling often means growing balls. ;-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi. I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Home Education&#39; magazine for years and always meant<br/>
&gt; to join an unschooling group online, I am finally here. I need some support<br/>
&gt; and ideas. No one else near me unschools, and I am coming up against<br/>
&gt; hostility to the point where I have to respond with proof that our children<br/>
&gt; are learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A brief history of our homeschool:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our girls were both adopted, both of them have trauma history, both of them<br/>
&gt; were difficult children. 2 years ago, when they were 9 and 10, they finally<br/>
&gt; began to settle down to where I could get them to cooperate with me. Before<br/>
&gt; that, obviously, we were 100% unschooled. At ages 9 and 10, neither of them<br/>
&gt; were reading and math was difficult for both of them, even though I&#39;d been<br/>
&gt; talking about math in our daily lives for years. They&#39;ve known phonics since<br/>
&gt; they were 5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless you&#39;ve experienced raising children who have trauma history, it is<br/>
&gt; difficult to understand what it is like. We have family and friends who feel<br/>
&gt; we were doing a poor job parenting because we didn&#39;t have control of our<br/>
&gt; children like they thought we should. My girls&#39; emotional health has always<br/>
&gt; been top priority for me and when I found an expert in parenting children<br/>
&gt; with trauma history to follow, it helped a great deal. My children still<br/>
&gt; have some issues, but for most part, they are doing well emotionally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, at 9 and 10, I took them to an eye doctor, looking for vision therapy<br/>
&gt; since we were at the point where I felt like I could get the girls to work<br/>
&gt; with me. This eye doctor was no help at all. So like a true unschooler, I<br/>
&gt; set out to learn all I could about vision therapy. We ended up traveling 10<br/>
&gt; hours to New York City to consult with the best optometrist I could find. I<br/>
&gt; learned much through him and he did help the girls, but it was a very<br/>
&gt; expensive undertaking and it was difficult to get to him. I&#39;ve now found a<br/>
&gt; doctor who works with vision training an hour from home and because of our<br/>
&gt; experience with the New York doctor, I am confidant that my children are<br/>
&gt; getting the best I can get for them. During our recent visit with this<br/>
&gt; optometrist, I looked at my children sitting very cooperatively in his<br/>
&gt; office and though &quot;Wow, he can&#39;t tell at all because of their excellent<br/>
&gt; behavior the behavioral difficulties we&#39;ve been through.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve worked with brain gym, I&#39;ve read books on teaching children who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had difficulty learning to read and we&#39;ve followed the method set out in the<br/>
&gt; book &quot;Reading Clinic&quot; most days throughout the school year. And now, just as<br/>
&gt; the girls have turned 11 and 12, they are finally reading. Still beginners,<br/>
&gt; but reading. In just the last 8 weeks, my twelve yo has made great strides.<br/>
&gt; My 11 yo has is where her sister had been as she began to read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The girls are finally catching on to arithmetic also. Again, daily<br/>
&gt; throughout the school year, I&#39;ve worked with them. For several months we<br/>
&gt; followed a workbook, then, when it became a real chore daily to get them to<br/>
&gt; do their math, I started tailoring my own worksheets for them based on their<br/>
&gt; level and using math books as a guide to be certain we were covering<br/>
&gt; everything such as fractions, decimals, geometry and all the math vocabulary<br/>
&gt; that children who do the workbooks are exposed to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that I&#39;ve written this, I realize I probably don&#39;t have to defend<br/>
&gt; myself to all of you, as you already understand that children learn as they<br/>
&gt; are ready. We live in Ohio, where I can either report standardized test<br/>
&gt; scores to the superintendent, or have a certified teacher sign that the<br/>
&gt; child is working up to her potential, which is what I&#39;ve done in the past.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve sent a summary of what we&#39;ve done for the year to a teacher whose<br/>
&gt; children were homeschooled. I&#39;ve been very honest in the reports and he has<br/>
&gt; always signed it for me, but with this hostility, we are not comfortable<br/>
&gt; asking him to sign it without closely following what the girls are learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am looking for a teacher who is certified in Ohio who understands<br/>
&gt; unschooling and that some children read late to work with us. I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt; contacted a tutoring center, who I would have tried before if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
&gt; the cost and my confidence that my girls will read and do math just fine as<br/>
&gt; they are ready.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening, and please offer feedback.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
