<div id="ygrps-yiv-33817371">I&#39;ve been on the list awhile and really appreciate everything I read.<br/>
   My ds is 4.5 yrs old.  We are unschooling and mom (me) works each<br/>
day to deschool myself in thoughts of education and parenting!  I<br/>
think I&#39;m getting it but I know I can slip up from time to time when<br/>
I&#39;m tired and exhausted.  Our ds has lead us to unschooling.  I&#39;m so<br/>
glad he did! <br/>
<br/>
My ds is high energy,  loves to run, bounce, climb and have fun.  He<br/>
also likes things his way and has even so much told me recently,  &quot;I<br/>
want to do this or that my way and I know what I want&quot;.  Great!  No<br/>
trouble having to guess what he wants at that time.  However, it can<br/>
make play dates difficult from time to time.  Other children may not<br/>
want to necessarily play his way.  KWIM. ;) My real concern is,  I<br/>
have observed him in his gymnastics class being pushy to the other<br/>
kids to get the exact place he wants to be in line or sitting waiting<br/>
for the next exercise.  Let me state he loves gymnastics.  He can&#39;t<br/>
wait to get there each week.   We&#39;ve talked about how everyone gets<br/>
their &quot;turn&quot; to do each piece of equipment etc.  I have also noticed<br/>
the instructor being aware of this and will often pick the children<br/>
out of the line in not a consistent order.  So if ds is in front the<br/>
instructor may pick a child from the middle or end.  So my ds and I<br/>
have talked about how would he like it if another child pushed him to<br/>
get in a particular spot etc. When they are sitting I&#39;ve noticed he<br/>
will lean on the person next to him till they move.  We&#39;ve talked<br/>
about how pushing another person isn&#39;t kind and that person could get<br/>
hurt. At the end of class this week,  I saw him push this little girl<br/>
twice who was in front of him.  When he came to me after class.  I<br/>
asked if he had fun and he was excited and said yes.  We basked a<br/>
little in his excitement.  As we talked about what they did in class I<br/>
told him I had seen him push this little girl.   I asked him why did<br/>
he push her.   His answer was,  &quot;she&#39;s moving too slow and was in my<br/>
way.  I wanted to be first in line.&quot;   In our discussion we talked<br/>
about how gymnastics class is set up by children getting into line to<br/>
move from each different exercise.  It really doesn&#39;t matter where you<br/>
are in that line as each person gets an equal turn on the equipment. <br/>
We also talked about how the instructor choses the kids randomly from<br/>
the line so placement doesn&#39;t really matter.  We also talked about he<br/>
could of really hurt this little girl by pushing her.  She also asked<br/>
him to stop the first time he pushed her.  He did it again and she<br/>
asked him to stop. Then she told the instructor what he did.   Again<br/>
we talked about it, if he was in line and the person behind him pushed<br/>
him and he asked to not be pushed, how would of he felt if the person<br/>
pushed him again.  He said he wouldn&#39;t like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts out there?  We are talking about it but I often read such<br/>
great things from many of you on the list.  I&#39;m always open for<br/>
different perspectives and always, always learning!  I&#39;ve got my<br/>
newspaper rolled up and ready to whack myself on the head at any given<br/>
time.  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your advice.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116142221">My girls are in a gymnastics class, they are 7 & 9.......and also LOVE gymnastics.  Most of the kids in the class are between 7 and 10, but there is one little girl that is around your sons age.  She is in the class because she is a pretty good little gymnast and the pre-school age class is just too easy for her.  But she is young so same thing as your son.  She pushes, she screams at people, she will do anything to shove her way to the front, etc.  <br/>
  I really just think it&#39;s the age.  I know this is not helpful, but I would just continue to talk to him.  I do remember this stage with my daughter&#39;s and learning to take turns was really a really hard one.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you all for your thoughts and suggestions.  It&#39;s so funny and<br/>
great you mention hockey.  I had inquired about hockey lessons/local<br/>
team just a few weeks ago.  I made arrangements with the instructor<br/>
that we could come watch the first lesson/practice and see if this is<br/>
something ds would like to do.  He&#39;s taken a few sessions of ice<br/>
skating lessons and does enjoy it.  As a matter of fact,  he and his<br/>
dad went ice skating today.  So I just love your suggestion.    It<br/>
will provide that outlet.  He is a rough and tumble boy, but has a<br/>
heart of gold and at the same time can be so sensitive.</div>

(Vicki)  Yes he does have empathy but I think you are right.  His own<br/>
desires are so strong he can&#39;t think of that empathy at the moment. <br/>
He does later.  So any suggestions on working on helping him with that<br/>
or time will tell?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; much - what would help you remember not to push?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
(Vicki) Absolutely!  Our discussions always are first about the other<br/>
child&#39;s feelings.   Feelings have always been our focus and I guess I<br/>
should of expressed that in the post.  One thing we have always talked<br/>
about is &quot;would you like it if so-and-so pushed you or jumped in front<br/>
of you in line?&quot;  I always get the answer &quot;NO&quot; loud and clear.  Then<br/>
we talk about what he did to that person and he thinks about it and<br/>
then defends himself by saying &quot;but they were taking too long or they<br/>
are in my way&quot;  Which brings me back to we are all different and we<br/>
move in different ways and sometimes it can be frustrating to us if<br/>
things don&#39;t happen the way you want but remember,  you will get a<br/>
turn.  This is his third session of these 10 week session of<br/>
gymnastics and this behavior has just cropped up in the last few<br/>
weeks.  It seems to me he has went through another developmental phase<br/>
as he&#39;s grown in height and suddenly his interests have changed.  For<br/>
example,  he had no interest before in the alphabet.  Now he&#39;s learned<br/>
all of his letters in no time and is actually trying to read.  It&#39;s<br/>
like he can&#39;t get enough of alphabet stimulation.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&gt;(Meredith) Were you in the room?  <br/>
(Vicki)YES,  but it&#39;s a huge gymnasium and I was not next to him. This<br/>
is not a parent/child class.  This is a child class and parents can be<br/>
in the gymnasium watching from the side lines.  I watch him throughout<br/>
the class.<br/>
<br/>
(Meredith)&gt; We use &quot;stop&quot; as our &quot;safe word&quot; as it were,  and I&#39;ve<br/>
been known to say something like: &quot;I heard a &quot;stop&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;Ouch means stop&quot; or (my personal favorite) &quot;Stop means Stop!&quot; I <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t leave something like that up to a teacher or worse, a group <br/>
&gt; of little kids, I&#39;d say something myself, *especially* to my own <br/>
&gt; child! <br/>
<br/>
 (vicki)Oh my Meredith,  I wouldn&#39;t dream of leaving something like<br/>
that to a group of little kids.  Hmmm,  I must present myself better<br/>
in posts if that is what you understood!!  That&#39;s a very scary<br/>
thought!  I also wouldn&#39;t leave it to the instructor.  You are right,<br/>
 this is my child!  Of course I said something immediately,  but he<br/>
couldn&#39;t hear me as I was across the gymnasium.  As soon as he was<br/>
close enough I talked with him.    When I have observed him leaning on<br/>
some one while sitting there I have got his attention.    Shook my<br/>
head no.  He stopped immediately.  Sadly,  this was one of those<br/>
situations where I just couldn&#39;t get his attention quick enough.   I<br/>
should also detail again that behavior in line is something relatively<br/>
new. So I want to nip it in the bud quickly as I don&#39;t want a bully!! <br/>
 <br/>
Its this kind of situation exactly that led me to <br/>
&gt; homeschooling in the first place - some kids need a whole lot more <br/>
&gt; feedback and support in groups than others and its unkind to <br/>
&gt; everyone, including the &quot;bullying&quot; child, to withhold that support. <br/>
<br/>
Again Meredith.  You are absolutely right!  I am not a parent that<br/>
throws my child out there and doesn&#39;t pay attention to what&#39;s going<br/>
on. I know he needs my feedback often.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion I think there are &quot;hands-on parents&quot; and there are<br/>
&quot;hands-off&quot;.  We are totally hands-on and I do want to help guide my<br/>
son to peaceful play,  kind and gentleness towards others,  think of<br/>
others feelings.  At the same time I want to honor the fact that he&#39;s<br/>
strong and wants to lead.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking one way to help him is outlets that let him be rough<br/>
and tumble. Like hockey if he likes it.  Empathy discussions when<br/>
needed.  Any peaceful leadership ideas? </span></blockquote></div>

empathy will ebb and flow a little, especially with other <br/>
developmental stuff going on. <br/>
<br/>
Its really sounding, from your reply, as though the problems he&#39;s <br/>
having are to do with the environment more than anything else - its <br/>
a big space and you can&#39;t be right there to get his attention when <br/>
he needs Mom. Is there antoher, smaller place he can do gymnastics <br/>
or something similar enough for his needs? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any peaceful leadership ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you find an older kid or young adult who is willing to be led a <br/>
bit? That might let him get some rough-and-tumble fun in, too - <br/>
moreso than a same age or younger child. <br/>
