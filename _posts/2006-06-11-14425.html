Hi Barbara,<br/>
<br/>
A belated welcome to the list. I&#39;ve been crazy busy this past week <br/>
with VBS at church and just haven&#39;t been online much which has felt <br/>
very strange for me! :)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t DO summer anymore than we DO any other traditional school <br/>
break. Life doesn&#39;t stop during the summer. We live and learn <br/>
every day of every year during our entire lifetime. The whole point <br/>
of unschooling is to learn to step away from the nonsensical method <br/>
of viewing learning as being able to happen only in certain places <br/>
(i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) or at certain times (from Sept to May, <br/>
Monday through Friday, 8am to 3pm). <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I see most newbies to unschooling misunderstand is <br/>
that life and learning happen without us pointing it out to one <br/>
another, whether to our spouses, friends, children, or whoever. New <br/>
unschoolers expect their children to choose to do schoolish things <br/>
like work through a Math textbook, study a certain time period in <br/>
History perhaps through reading regular books, set up a Science <br/>
experiment, etc. It truly helps to focus YOUR thinking away from <br/>
schoolish things. All the things we do in life can be categorized <br/>
in some manner if you speak educationlese, but one wonders WHY you <br/>
need to do that? For example, when you prepare your grocery list <br/>
and complete your shopping, do you award yourself a grade or some <br/>
other form of external reward for doing something in Home <br/>
Economics? Do you consider your Math lessons done for the day when <br/>
you balance your checkbook? Adults do not, normally, separate <br/>
everything into subjects but we sure expect that of our children.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started unschooling, I had to genuinely believe that it <br/>
was OKAY that my children may never, never do anything that looks <br/>
like schoolwork. Over time, I&#39;ve become so excited by that fact <br/>
that I now take a double-look when I do see them choosing something <br/>
that looks like schoolwork! *lol* <br/>
<br/>
I may repeat this alot and it&#39;s also for my sake, but I think <br/>
the &#39;unschooling&#39; term is more for us parents trying to let go. I <br/>
don&#39;t think of my kids as unschooling because they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
undo anything. Instead, they are living life... actually WE are <br/>
living together and that encompasses so very much if you truly stop <br/>
and marvel at it.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the welcome, Jann. I did think of one question - I&#39;m sure I will<br/>
&gt; have more. With the unschooling philosophy of your children pursuing what<br/>
&gt; interests them, i.e. making learning and doing a natural part of life, along<br/>
&gt; with working at their own pace, how do you do your summer break? Or, how do<br/>
&gt; you stop &quot;school&quot; for the summer?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Summers look just like winters but it&#39;s hot. (At least here in<br/>
Florida LOL!) Depending on your neighborhood or your children&#39;s<br/>
relationships with schooled children, there might be more kids at your<br/>
house in the summer than the winter on more days than in the summer<br/>
than the winter. If you &quot;stop unschooling&quot; for the summer then it<br/>
would mean you would be schooling during the summer.<br/>

Hi, welcome to the list. I&#39;m relatively new to this, but wanted to <br/>
share something. Rachel, my six yo, came up to me last week with a <br/>
puzzled look on her face. I asked her what was going on (I was <br/>
kneading dough at the time), and she looked up at me and said <br/>
&quot;Multiplying things is figuring out how much groups of numbers equal, <br/>
right?&quot; I thought I knew where she was going with this, but I asked <br/>
her to clarify. &quot;Well, if you have nine of something, then that&#39;s <br/>
nine times one&quot;, I affirmed this and she continued. &quot;So, if you <br/>
wanted to do nine times two, it would be eighteen, right?&quot; Yup. &quot;But <br/>
if you said nine times zero, it would mean you had nothing!&quot;. Yep, <br/>
you&#39;re right again. &quot;But I&#39;ll bet nine times infinity is still <br/>
infinity.&quot; Holy cow child!<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t need to memorize anything. It came to her, on her own, <br/>
while she was counting ants in the backyard. Something I had to be <br/>
taught in animal behavior was to estimate herds and flock numbers by <br/>
counting by groups. She figured it out on her own. College is <br/>
overrated. College prep is doubly so. You&#39;re eight year old will do <br/>
the math she needs. Math isn&#39;t hard. Nothing truly is until you are <br/>
told that it is (or unless you are forced to learn it when you&#39;re not <br/>
ready), and you&#39;re own baggage makes it difficult at that point.<br/>
<br/>
My four year old is learning how to read. i haven&#39;t taught him. He <br/>
started by wanting to find his sports bottle in the cabinet. He finds <br/>
S-A-M. Then it moved to reading the bionicles gameboy game, he needed <br/>
to know which defense to use. I have never taught him ABC&#39;s or <br/>
phonics or even Dolce sight words. but he can read....<br/>
<br/>
People are talking about trust. I know you probably feel attacked <br/>
right now, but don&#39;t take it personally. Take it as genuine concern <br/>
for your family, and try to be open minded about listening. Trust <br/>
opens up the world, suspicion closes minds.<br/>

I have been interested in &quot;delight-directed&quot; homeschooling which I <br/>
tried to<br/>
incorporate a little last year without much success. The thought of <br/>
going<br/>
all out and trying unschooling intrigues me, but I am a researcher <br/>
first.<br/>
Hence joining this list. :-) I look forward to learning from you and<br/>
hearing more about how unschooling works as I&#39;m only about halfway <br/>
through<br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook.<br/>

<br/>
AND - lots of times we will not be so lucky as Melissa was - we won&#39;t <br/>
be let in on the fact that specific learning has happened.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing new unschoolers have to learn is not to constantly be <br/>
worrying about what the kids are learning - especially not to quiz <br/>
them. (It is okay to be silently in awe of the whole amazing <br/>
process.) We have to trust our kids to grow and learn, just like we <br/>
trust seeds to grow into plants and trust plants to grow and blossom. <br/>
Quizzing the kids is like digging up seeds to see if they&#39;ve sprouted <br/>
or pulling up plants to see if the roots are growing. Bad idea - <br/>
stunts growth.<br/>

It helps a lot not to see high school as preparation for college but <br/>
to see college as *a* way to pursue a particular interest.<br/>
<br/>
So for unschoolers college is just a way to continue to pursue <br/>
interests and the best way to prepare is ... by pursuing interestst!<br/>
<br/>
Transcripts for college from unschooled kids don&#39;t look like <br/>
transcripts from high school kids. Applications willlook more like <br/>
what colleges get from adult applicants, instead of lists of subjects <br/>
theirs will be full of life :-)<br/>

<br/>
Well, if you are a researcher then that is an interest of yours.<br/>
Researching is very &quot;unschooly&quot; to me if it is based on what you want<br/>
to learn. YOU want to learn about unschooling so you are surrounding<br/>
yourself with information about unschooling. You have bought a book,<br/>
joined a webgroup, looked things up on the ineternet, joined in<br/>
discussions, and are immersing yourself in that interest.<br/>
<br/>
The first step you are going to have to do before your children can<br/>
get to that point is to deschool. Even though you have homeschooled<br/>
all their lives, you have still have very schoolish ways of doing<br/>
things. Your children are going to have to learn to trust that you<br/>
are going to let them delve (like you are doing) all the subjects that<br/>
interest them. That&#39;s *all* the subjects, just not the schoolish<br/>
looking subjects. There are *some* children who will do the same with<br/>
math or reading or geography or science or social studies, but it<br/>
won&#39;t look like school - it will look a lot like them pursuing their<br/>
interests. Just like you are doing with learning about unschooling.<br/>

What is they refuse to do any learning at all? My 12 year old is<br/>
like this. He won&#39;t do anything that he might accidently learn<br/>
something from.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because he&#39;s once bitten, twice shy. He&#39;s avoiding learning <br/>
because it&#39;s painful or boring or senseless. To *him*---that&#39;s all that <br/>
matters. Not your feelings---HIS.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
I thought he might like to cut up dead animals. I seriously thought<br/>
he would enjoy it. So I offered to get him a dissection starter kit<br/>
that came with all the tools you need, plus pig, rat, worms,<br/>
starfish, about 9 specimens.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Too schooly. Road kill might&#39;ve appealed to him more. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He thought it was a cool idea at first,<br/>
but then after he thought about it said no because &quot;He might learn<br/>
something&quot;. His words, not mine. I said it would be fun. He agreed<br/>
but said &quot;It&#39;s biology&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because you&#39;ve &quot;taught&quot; him that it is. It&#39;s really just cutting <br/>
up dead animals. You can write &quot;biology&quot; down in your documentation for <br/>
whatever things you have to provide to the state. But when dealing with <br/>
your son, lose the school terminology. (It&#39;s best to do hat in your own <br/>
head, as well, but one step at a time.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he gets an idea that he might learn something about a<br/>
topic, he backs off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;ve taught him that lesson.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t read any books or watch any documentaries--even about<br/>
topics that he is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;ve taught him that lesson.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems like the only learning I can get him to do is forced<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s no such thing. Oxymoron.<br/>

He used to be the complete opposite. He used to read the dictionary<br/>
for fun. But he went to school from k-2 and ever since won&#39;t do<br/>
anything that he might learn something from unless I make him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you possibly imagine what that could have been to make him hate <br/>
learning so much?<br/>
<br/>
Happened to my son too. After eight years of school, he said he would <br/>
never read again. The damage was that severe.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s healed now. Carries a book everywhere he goes now.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t eough hours in the day for all he wants to learn. He needs <br/>
two of himself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He seems to be rebelling against education. I don&#39;t know what to do<br/>
to spark interests in him strong enough for him to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, you could push more &quot;forced learning&quot; on him. How&#39;s that been <br/>
working for you?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt; Example:<br/>
&gt; I thought he might like to cut up dead animals. I seriously thought<br/>
&gt; he would enjoy it. So I offered to get him a dissection starter kit<br/>
&gt; that came with all the tools you need, plus pig, rat, worms,<br/>
&gt; starfish, about 9 specimens. He thought it was a cool idea at first,<br/>
&gt; but then after he thought about it said no because &quot;He might learn<br/>
&gt; something&quot;. His words, not mine. I said it would be fun. He agreed<br/>
&gt; but said &quot;It&#39;s biology&quot;<br/>

&gt; As soon as he gets an idea that he might learn something about a<br/>
&gt; topic, he backs off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this to be mean or judgemental. BACK OFF. Seriously,<br/>
you have given him the seed that this is a possibility. Later he<br/>
might come to you and say, &quot;Remember that dissection kit you offered?<br/>
Is that still available?&quot; But he will do it when he has gained your<br/>
trust that he can do it for his own exploration not out of something<br/>
that YOU want him to learn. You need to gain that trust from him.<br/>
Shoving things at him because you are afraid he isn&#39;t *learning* is<br/>
never going to gain his trust that he can explore his world without<br/>
you getting all involved in making it a teaching experience. You have<br/>
shown him again and again your fears. You don&#39;t trust him to learn so<br/>
why should he trust that you aren&#39;t going to teach? You both need a<br/>
period where you can learn to trust from each other and it isn&#39;t going<br/>
to happen by continuing to feed him information. It&#39;s going to happen<br/>
by you backing off, watching him and being involved in his lead.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My dh is in the Air Force and is very <br/>
knowledgeable about weapons. He likes to play shooter games on the <br/>
computer or be an assassin in games & stuff like that. He&#39;s not a <br/>
violent person at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds so much like my husband who is in the Army. He also happens to be a demolitions expert (he&#39;s a Combat Engineer). Right now he is teaching Iraqi soldiers how to detect and defuse IEDs (improvised explosive devices). He&#39;s probably the most levelheaded and sincere person I&#39;ve ever met. He&#39;s also not violent at all. But, boy, does he love his demolitions! He&#39;s like a really big kid when he starts talking about his job...he gets that twinkle in his eye, and his face just lights up. The sign of someone who is passionate about his job.<br/>

Just chiming in on this topic of bombs and weapons interest in <br/>
relationship to a young man. Our first five were girls...the last <br/>
two boys. What a WORLD of difference. They truely are from <br/>
Mars! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest boy, Andrew, is 14, and he has wanted to go into the <br/>
military ever since he was five-years-old. He loves everything guns <br/>
and knives. He loves to explore martial arts. He thinks the idea <br/>
of killing a squirrel or a bird is a-okay, and in the right instance <br/>
maybe even funny. Andrew is also a natural shot and great hunter. <br/>
He views violence in war as necessary and acceptable. On the flip <br/>
side he is excellent with young children, extremely helpful, <br/>
compassionate, a good writer and a wonderful artist who wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest boy, Adrian, is 12, and he loves &quot;violent&quot; video games, <br/>
b.b. guns, South Park, Joe Cartoon and looks forward to joining Pat <br/>
and Andrew for his first hunt this fall even though he&#39;s a <br/>
vegetarian. On the flip side he is thoughtful, knowledgable about <br/>
small animals and history, has extreme polital views and interests <br/>
and is also good with young children. He would never hurt anyone <br/>
and thinks senseless killing is, well, senseless.<br/>
<br/>
I think that our boys can come as a shock to us moms at times. <br/>
There were times that Adrian&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot; made me raise an eyebrow <br/>
here and there, but I just paid close attention to him. I listened <br/>
more and got as in tune with him as I possibly could. From my <br/>
experience it seems that boys, maybe not all of them...but at least <br/>
some of them, go through a real &quot;snakes and snails&quot; phase. They are <br/>
SO different than girls, and I&#39;m a girl. So, I don&#39;t get A LOT <br/>
about them. When it comes to this I am VERY grateful that my <br/>
husband is around. I also try to read about boys specifically. It <br/>
really does help.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to be VERY, VERY open to them. They talk about <br/>
disgusting stuff that involves bodily fluids, bodily sounds and <br/>
natural urges. They talk about killing and hurting and like <br/>
aggressive things. That&#39;s not my bag, but I do talk and laugh with <br/>
them. If something REALLY grosses me out, or I just can&#39;t handle <br/>
the way they are talking, I will comment something to the tune <br/>
of, &quot;Okay, ladies are present.&quot; or, &quot;Mom&#39;s REALLY don&#39;t NEED to know <br/>
that!&quot; This is always with a smile, and they tend to laugh, but <br/>
they do back it off a bit to respect my poor, little brain.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever &quot;get&quot; boys, but I do know we have <br/>
excellent relationships with eachother. It didn&#39;t start this way, <br/>
but it became open and wonderful by one means. Someone else <br/>
mentioned it earlier, *I* changed, not them. It is SO true that <br/>
your behavior will change your children. Openness is ESSENTIAL for <br/>
a mom to have a successful relationship with her son...not that it <br/>
isn&#39;t essential for other things too, we just happen to be talking <br/>
about boys right now.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two-cents worth...<br/>

The site also offered the incubator without the eggs. This is great for my family since Hawaii doesn&#39;t allow many types of animals to be introduced. We&#39;re going to contact some farmers that offer chicken eggs and hatch them- then give the chicks back to the farmer. That might be an idea for anyone without the ability to keep the quail.<br/>

chicks. They grow so fast. I would love to do it. We<br/>
just don&#39;t have the room, that&#39;s something more to<br/>

&gt; Mostly if left to his own he plays xbox live and chats with friend<br/>

&gt; could make a poison out of castor beans?&quot;, he says stuff like that<br/>
&gt; to me all the time)<br/>
<br/>
Who knows? Maybe one day instead of reading up on how to create<br/>
poisons from castor beans he will find a way to create antidotes to<br/>
poisons from castor beans.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He watches movies on Comedy Central, mostly comedies. He watches<br/>
&gt; South Park and Family Guy.<br/>
<br/>
Does one need drama to be &quot;well rounded?&quot; Is &quot;well roundedness&quot; the<br/>
goal? What&#39;s wrong with wanting to laugh in life? And you did say<br/>
*mostly* comedies which means he is watching other things as well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really don&#39;t see him learning anything schoolish from it. I admit,<br/>
&gt; I have a strong need for his learning to be schoolish topics even if<br/>
&gt; obtained by unschoolish ways.<br/>
<br/>
Why does it have to be schoolish? This is all about *your* need, not<br/>
*his* need. And the sentence is an oxymoron if you think about it.<br/>
If he is unschooling nothing he does is going to look &quot;schoolish&quot; He<br/>
may learn some facts and figures that would be taught in school, but<br/>
they aren&#39;t going to look schoolish at all. And how do you know he is<br/>
learning nothing that is &quot;schoolish&quot; by watching comedies and South<br/>
Park. I think South Park has some pretty interesting concepts that<br/>
can open up some great discussions. Do you watch these shows with<br/>
him?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see how any of this will prepare him for a career or college<br/>
&gt; someday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is college *his* goal or your goal for him? And as young as he is he<br/>
has no idea what his career will be or if he will want or need to go<br/>
to college to get there.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Has anyone had luck with their kids playing sports at the local high<br/>
school as homeschoolers? I am in California and the school is adament that<br/>
my kids can&#39;t....but why? I have contacted the CIF and they say no too. I<br/>
wonder if anyone has taken this to court?&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
the school can so NO. that&#39;s their right. it&#39;s up to each individual<br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
if I were you, I&#39;d try to find other ways to do the sports your kids want to<br/>
do. try the park district or local gyms. <br/>

My dad did....relatively easy since he&#39;s only third generation, he <br/>
went back to about 1750. But Swedish is harder than it looks...my <br/>
friend has a CD learning set she&#39;s going to give me after *she* <br/>
learns it (her son emigrated there, married a nice swede, and just <br/>
had baby number 2, she figures she&#39;d better learn the language fast <br/>
so she can talk to the grandkids!)<br/>
There is also French and Welsh, but I like to say I&#39;m honorary Irish <br/>
since I&#39;m born on St Patricks day, and I love pretty much all things <br/>
Irish.<br/>

&quot;Summers look just like winters but it&#39;s hot. (At least here in<br/>
Florida LOL!) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just woke up this morning and someone had opened the bedroom window.<br/>
A cool breeze is blowing in...probably about 65 degrees outside right<br/>
now and I just thought &quot;GAWD I&#39;m glad we left P&#39;cola!!&quot;:)<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course there was marble-sized hail last night!!<br/>
