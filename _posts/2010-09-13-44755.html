October&#39;s theme comes from a Twitter follower/friend Diana Jenner. The<br/>
discussion was about people&#39;s reasons for unschooling. Why do you unschool? Is<br/>
it a feeling or did you come to it by trial and error or much research?<br/>
<br/>
This theme is pretty open-ended. Think about not just what thoughts and<br/>
experiences led you to the path you&#39;re currently on, but what daily reminders<br/>
life may present you that your particular choices are right.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond by Sept 28, at<br/>
