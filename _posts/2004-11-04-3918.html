<div id="ygrps-yiv-876920645">Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
Your post didn&#39;t say how old your son is.  But going from the fact that he can say &quot;in a minute&quot;, I figure older than a toddler.  I went through this with my own kids and I think it is important to remember that the issue is no longer orange peels on the floor but that he says he will do something and then he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people will recommend that you simply pick up the peels from the floor in a happy manner and eventually, your son will as well.  That recommendation might work very well, but the fact that y&#39;all have other issues going on (Mom is mentally ill, having to be away, etc.).  I would take a much more hands on approach.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would pick up the peels and point out that I thought he was going to do it.  Not in a mean way, just matter of fact.  If it keeps happening, I would ask him during a happy time, why he tells me he will pick up the peels and then he doesn&#39;t.  If it continues, I would point out how he might feel if I threw my trash down in his room and when asked to pick it, I said I would and didn&#39;t.  And so on.  I&#39;m not saying punish him or yell at him.  I&#39;m saying keep bringing to his attention that this is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
To me it is one thing if the kids are playing and leave their toys out.  I will gladly put them away, no problem.  It is another when the kids just throw trash in the floor because they can&#39;t be bothered to walk 5 steps to the trash can.  I see it is being very disrespectful.  I wouldn&#39;t treat anyone that way and don&#39;t want anyone treating me that way, adult or kid.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thought.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411547016">Is there a way to keep a small trash can near the <br/>
couch/chair/whatever? I know with DS (6 1/2), when he is into <br/>
watching something, he doesn&#39;t want to miss a moment of it and then <br/>
he&#39;s on to something else and he has truly forgotten that he said <br/>
he&#39;d do something in between. Or, perhaps, he/you can peel the <br/>
orange in the kitchen and then take it to the living room? There are <br/>
probably lots of ways to come to a suitable situation besides he <br/>
does it or you do it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the cartoons, just a hunch here, but I&#39;d guess he is <br/>
probably using that as an outlet, an escape, from all the big life <br/>
stuff going on right now. DH is 36 and when he is stressed he will <br/>
play video games in every free moment (and get tense, grumpy, if he <br/>
can&#39;t play or gets interrupted - which is a problem since he&#39;s the <br/>
at home parent with DS - and a 6 1/2 yr old needs attention). <br/>
Reading or anything else takes concentration and energy which he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to spare right now - all that is bundled up in all the <br/>
emotions and stresses of having an unstable parent who has been away <br/>
for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
I might even suggest finding both boys some sort of counselor who <br/>
can help them express and deal with what is going on inside them.</div>
