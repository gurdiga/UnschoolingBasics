<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741084359">&quot;&gt; Well the thing is, even if it is morally reprehensible<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to many of us,  spanking, even with a switch or &quot;rod&quot;,<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t illegal in *any* state, and  doesn&#39;t fall under<br/>
&gt; the legal category of abuse. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not true.<br/>
I realize I&#39;m coming in a bit late to this conversation, but I can&#39;t <br/>
leave an innacuracy alone.:)<br/>
In the state of Alaska for example, anything that leaves a visible <br/>
mark is illegal. That information came from a licensed social worker <br/>
that lives there. I&#39;m sure there are other states that have laws <br/>
against children being hit with sticks and such. I sure hope so anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I insert the phrase &#39;hit your wife&#39; doesn&#39;t it make your skin <br/>
crawl to<br/>
think about associating with such a person? Why is a child any less<br/>
deserving of equal protection?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sylvia, BUT, would you quit associating with the wife <br/>
just because she was being abused? <br/>
<br/>
Profound influence can happen when one DOES associate with people that <br/>
don&#39;t necessarily treat their children with respect most of the time. <br/>
ON the other hand, I couldn&#39;t be around extreme negativity all the <br/>
time either. Life is too short.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I had such a hard time believing that people in this<br/>
group of all places were justifying spanking and saying it wasn&#39;t all <br/>
that bad<br/>
even that using a small stick was no big deal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have read this conversation in it&#39;s entirety, and I can not find ONE <br/>
post condoning the hitting of children or justifying spanking on any <br/>
level. <br/>
Unschoolingbasics has been a voice of gentle parenting, utmost respect <br/>
for children and assisting others in finding their way along the <br/>
unschooling path since the day it started. We will continue to ensure <br/>
that this is a place for the unschooling philosophy and how it affects <br/>
ALL of life with our children.<br/>
<br/>
When someone asks for advice, that means they want to hear other <br/>
opinions. If you come here with your mind made up, it might be harder <br/>
to sift through other opinions and  find anything useful.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember though, everyone here is volunteering their time and <br/>
energy to give advice and try to be helpful. I get a bit tetchy when I <br/>
read posts that say &quot;I don&#39;t care what you say&quot; or being negative <br/>
towards incredibly valuable voices like Deb L.<br/>
<br/>
Assume that everyone here is trying their best to be helpful, that <br/>
they are giving of their time to try and make things BETTER for <br/>
children and families. If something doesn&#39;t work for you, that&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
My feelings run deep for many of the beautiful voices here and I&#39;d <br/>
like to make sure they keep on posting their incredible advice and <br/>
being a voice of sanity in an insane society. Be good to them please.:)<br/>

This is really more along my lines of thinking...not the &quot;let&#39;s all <br/>
get along&quot; thing that was interpreted from my post.  Basically, what I <br/>
believe is that we are all in different places.  We CANNOT do anything <br/>
other than what we know.  AND, how do we learn anything new if we are <br/>
never exposed to new things AND different thinking people? Not to <br/>
mention the fact that in order to learn and grow we NEED TIME to <br/>
change.  A lifetime of living in any way is NOT changed in an instant. <br/>
<br/>
I have really enjoyed this &quot;brain stretching&quot; discussion...what a hot <br/>

<br/>
By choosing to be exposed to new things and different thinking people.  It&#39;s a choice.  Everybody knows that there are different ways of being/thinking/doing but not everybody chooses to seek them out.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is very supportive of the way I&#39;ve raised my children, despite having raised me and my siblings very differently.  But she has a need to occasionally justify her past choices by saying she didn&#39;t &quot;know better.&quot;  But really, the reason that *I* know better is because I purposely *looked* for better... nobody handed anything to me.  La Leche League didn&#39;t come knocking on my door,  John Holt&#39;s books weren&#39;t placed in a basket on my doorstep, and unschooling message boards didn&#39;t lay down in my path, ya know?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an unschooler because I was lucky enough to be exposed to it.  I&#39;m an unschooler because I seek and I seek until I find what makes sense and what feels right in my heart and soul.<br/>
&quot;I didn&#39;t know better&quot; is a pretty lame excuse when it comes to parenting IMO.  Forgivable but lame. ;-)<br/>

****<br/>
 <br/>
Well, we&#39;re straying off-topic here, but whether I would give up the friendship depends on the situation.  Does she come running for advice then not follow thru?  Is it just about the drama, without any readiness to find a solution?  I don&#39;t have the energy available to be involved in a running soap opera where the star never empowers herself, or keeps running back for more.<br/>
 <br/>
If she really wants out and needs help for a plan, then I&#39;m there.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, with a child it&#39;s different. I would want to be available to the child, but in a way that also protected my own children from unnecessary harm.  It can be a hard line to walk.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about the negativity -- after a while it drains me and I&#39;m not able to be at my best for my own kids.<br/>

<br/>
But that was because something in your soul sent you on a quest for information.  Something sparked you .....whether it was running into a person, a feeling, an idea.....something suggested to you that there are &quot;other ways&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are pretty natural seekers.  When society says &quot;this is how we do this&quot;, the natural seeker naturally says &quot;why?&quot;.....that would be me.<br/>
<br/>
Some people aren&#39;t.  When society says &quot;this is how we do this&quot;, it is one less thing to think about and the non-seeker says &quot;ok&quot;.....that would be my husband.  He isn&#39;t a bad guy.  He just lives in a rather small world, somewhat disconnected to civilization at large.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the kid who was questioning whether there was a God while still in elementary school, laying in bed at night trying to logically figure it out.  To this day, dh says it simply doesn&#39;t cross his mind.<br/>
<br/>
After 8 years of radical unschooling, he is a huge proponent of it.  But if the schooling decisions had been left completely in his hands, the kids would have been in school all this time, simply because it wouldn&#39;t have crossed his mind to consider education from &quot;outside the box&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
That would be me as well...when I was younger anyways.  Now, I <br/>
question everything it seems.  :)  Fortunately, I&#39;ve learned to <br/>
trust my instinct a lot more.  I still remember talking to a friend <br/>
when I was a young teen.  He asked me if I liked such and such <br/>
music.  I said I never heard of it.  He asked why, and I said that <br/>
I&#39;d never been exposed to it.  He told me that was no excuse.  I can <br/>
still remember the confusion in my mind.  How was I supposed to know <br/>
about something that I&#39;d never been exposed to?  It never dawned on <br/>
me that there were different styles of music other than what was <br/>
played on the radio.  So, I never searched out ANY new music, ever.<br/>
<br/>
It was not until I had a very good friend that homeschooled that I <br/>
even knew it was an option.  From there I researched extensively and <br/>
made the decision to homeschool my youngest.  Through all that <br/>
extensive research it was YEARS before I discovered unschooling.  <br/>
And, honestly I don&#39;t even remember *how* I came to know there was <br/>
such a style of living...<br/>

<br/>
In her case, she vastly improved her parenting over her own parent&#39;s<br/>
parenting.  She was thinking outside the box for her time.  There are things<br/>
that she would change, I am sure, if she knew then what she knows now, but<br/>
even for a forward thinker of that time, there just wasn&#39;t&#39; the information<br/>
so readily available to her generation that is available to ours.  We are<br/>
very fortunate indeed to have the internet to aid us in our parenting. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that my own children improve on my parenting.  I think we do a pretty<br/>

about child rearing that wasn&#39;t available to me.  It isn&#39;t because I am not<br/>

I think that too much &quot;natural seeking&quot; is squashed by schools. I doubt <br/>

Thanks for this explanation -- it really sums up my inlaws.  A couple of weeks ago, my Mom and I were discussing the inlaws&#39; approach to life&#39;s big questions (things she and I have always wondered about) and I just couldn&#39;t find the word to describe them.  I know it&#39;s not that they&#39;re shallow (tho that was the best word I could come up with) or not intelligent.  My Mom had called it a complete lack of curiousity, which neither of us can imagine.   Thinking of them as non-seekers seems more accurate than &#39;shallow.&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never been able to stop the seeking questions that run thru my mind, and wondered how it is others don&#39;t have the same running commentary.<br/>

 <br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s lame at all.  As Angela pointed out, we have more access to new ideas, examples and support from other parents thru the internet.  We&#39;re able to get info that wouldn&#39;t have been available in the 70&#39;s (or even the late 80&#39;s, having a been a young mom then myself).  Our mothers learned from their mothers, and from society at large.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s also easy for me to forget that I have so much more power than my Mom ever had.  I have legal rights she didn&#39;t have, more insight into people and situations.  I was able to easily get a divorce when my first marriage sucked, she wasn&#39;t able to get out for 20 years.  During my early days as a working Mom, I made a decent wage.  When she was a young Mom, women made much less for the same workweek than men.  <br/>
 <br/>
She was mothering in a virtual warzone with my Dad -- and I know we weren&#39;t the only household where that was true in that time.  She might have heard of families where things were different, but for her that was a pipe dream at best.  More likely, it was just another reminder of how powerless she was to effect change in her own life and those of her children.  <br/>
 <br/>
In recent years -- say the last two, really -- she&#39;s softened in many ways.  I realize, too, that much of her harshness in response is about her fears that she will have somehow failed us, and her awareness of how easy it is to fail one&#39;s children as a mother.  She knows how high the stakes are (and just how unkind life can be), and she&#39;s seen us all suffer for the circumstances she wasn&#39;t able to change when we were young.  I can see it breaks her heart.  She&#39;s bitter at times, and I can understand why.  Her life didn&#39;t turn out at all as she had hoped it would.  She has also said she&#39;s very blessed -- her life plans didn&#39;t include children, and she can&#39;t imagine not being a Mom.  <br/>
 <br/>
My point is that our mothers lived in a very different world than we do, than most of us can even conceive.  My Mom did many things differently than I do, but above all we always knew she loved us.  Somehow that told me the rest would work itself out, if only I kept trying.  I &#39;got&#39; that from watching her always try for us.  <br/>

My mother once lamented to me that at the time I was born there wasn&#39;t La Leche League, and homeschooling was unheard of.<br/>
But there *was* La Leche League -I believe it was founded in the fifties and was quite popular by the seventies- I know that some of my friends&#39; mothers were involved in it during that time.  And homeschooling *was* heard of.  Some of the books that first convinced me to keep my kids out of school were published before I was born/school age.  The information *was* there had my mom been a seeker of different ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
***We are<br/>
very fortunate indeed to have the internet to aid us in our parenting.***<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely- it makes things *much* easier.  But I didn&#39;t have internet access until well after I&#39;d decided to homeschool.  My resources at the the time was oldest was approaching school age were books, alternative publications, and likeminded people I met through parenting/homeschooling groups.   When I had two toddlers I remember searching directories in the back of magazines like GWS to find contacts and attending local get-togethers to pick the other mothers&#39; brains. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that some people seek and some people don&#39;t, regardless of how marvelous the depth of the available resources are.  Otherwise there would be a lot more people unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s hard to imagine getting any better than respectful parenting and unschooling though, isn&#39;t it?  What I hope for my children is that they don&#39;t fall as far short of their ideals as I tend to.  Then again, they won&#39;t have the same rusty tapes playing in their brains that some of us need to overcome from our own childhoods.<br/>

Right---they&#39;ll have better role models.<br/>
<br/>
My parents did what their parents did who did what their parents did. <br/>
By shifting our parenting this far, we ensure that our kids won&#39;t have <br/>
as far to adjust---just a tweak or two rather than a whole paradigm <br/>
shift.<br/>

<br/>
I have to agree with you there, Kelly.<br/>
<br/>
My three youngest wanted to try school last year.  They were in First and Kindergarten, had never been in a structured setting and are all quite verbal and natural seekers.  The school initially suggested Special Education LOL.  After spending time with the kids, the teachers changed their minds and thought the kids were quite bright.  After spending time with the schools, the kids decided to come home.  LOL<br/>

<br/>
FWIW We have a situation where I am close to some children who are abused<br/>
and have been taken from their home more than once.  They are presently<br/>
awaiting placement in foster care - again.  When they were home with their<br/>
mom I did continue my friendship with them but consciously limited my<br/>
children&#39;s exposure and association with them.  My kids like them and play<br/>
with them but do not ever ask to see them - the other kids always do the<br/>
asking.  My point being, I was able to befriend and assist these kids a bit<br/>
without throwing my kids into harms way.  Oh, and when they did play<br/>
together it was always with me present, at our house or a park.  I would<br/>
never leave my kids at their house.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m enjoying reading her book now, but I looked all through the book <br/>
for an &quot;about the author&quot; type of thing.  When I read &quot;Unschooling <br/>
Handbook&quot; I liked that I could skip to the back and find out about <br/>
the people whose input I was reading.  I assume the answer is yes, <br/>
but is Rue one of those people who started unschooling from birth so <br/>
to speak, or one who found it later?  I think it would be nice to <br/>
have a little bio info even for some of the posts I read here.  It&#39;s <br/>
nice when people include in their signature line things like mother <br/>
to 5yo so-n-so etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a parent of a toddler I&#39;m always looking for input on unschooling <br/>
with a single child in the toddler-preschool age range.  (and yes <br/>
I&#39;m on the AU group too.)  Sometimes I wonder if the response I&#39;m <br/>
reading ever dealt with only having one child or didn&#39;t start <br/>
unschooling until they were 8 or whatever.<br/>

**Hi Misty - Dagny went to kindergarten because we didn&#39;t know homeschooling<br/>
was an option.  She had never been in daycare or preschool.  She&#39;ll be 14 in<br/>
a few months, so she&#39;s been unschooling for 8 years.  Rowan&#39;s 9 1/2 now and<br/>
has never been to school.  Our parenting has always been based on respect<br/>
and trust, although when Dagny was little we did our share of messing up<br/>
while figuring out how to translate the principles we believed in into day<br/>
to day life with a toddler.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what other &#39;about the author&#39; info you&#39;d be interested in, but<br/>
feel free to ask anything you&#39;d like to know.  ~Rue<br/>

    I actully just finished reading your book  today.  It was wondeful.  It <br/>
really helped me to see that i am doing  things right.  The format is very easy <br/>
to follow and the questions that you  choose to answer were perfect. Thank <br/>
you so much for taking the time to put it  all down.  I loved every min of it.<br/>
