<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081644233">Okay, sorry, I know this wave of conversation has kind of passed--I&#39;m <br/>
always so behind in my distest.  But I LOVED that movie, Cast away.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen it a half dozen times. I had to speak regarding this product <br/>
placement nonsense (my opinion)! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there were actual brand names mentioned repeatedly (notably FedEx <br/>
and Wilson, as discussed), however, looking at the whole story, rather <br/>
than pulling out of context the mere fact of these logo&#39;s presence, <br/>
misses the point of a piece of great storytelling.  Tom Hanks starts out <br/>
the vision of FedEx-ness, yes, but by the end he has left that life <br/>
completely, and for the better.  He has Cast Away that entire life, the <br/>
life he thought was so important and central--comically so!--and become <br/>
something more stripped down and real.  Same with Wilson, his buddy.  He <br/>
has to LET GO of Wilson in order to survive.  He has to let go of all of <br/>
it, all the attachments to stuff, in order to live and become who he <br/>
will become--a person who can freely choose what path he wants at the <br/>
crossroads in the end.  That is clearly a message antithetical to &#39;buy <br/>
fedex because you saw the brandname logo a couple dozen times.&#39;  That <br/>
story-truth is MUCH more impacting, I think, than any supposed product <br/>
placement could ever be.  I think of that scene where he habitually does <br/>
the &#39;sort&#39; with the washed up packages and these items he has described <br/>
as being &#39;the golden egg&#39; are so ridiculously banal, it makes the whole <br/>
fed-ex mythos seem silly. <br/>
<br/>
It would be a great loss, I think, to throw out movies and tv that <br/>
accomplish story telling of this quality, because of a fear of being <br/>
overly influenced by some possible logo placement.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I just had to get that off my chest.  Thanks if you actually read <br/>
this far!<br/>
