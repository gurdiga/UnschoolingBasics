<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783839926">I would like some advice on what to do (or not to do) about<br/>
something Sophia(5) did today that I found, well, mean.  We were at<br/>
the local Rec Center and she was in the wading pool, she had made<br/>
friends with a girl and *ditched* me in the hydro-pool to go with this<br/>
girl. I thought, wow, this is great because she does not usually play<br/>
with anyone but me. There was a boy, maybe 3 or 4 who was also in the<br/>
wading pool and his mom was sitting on the pool deck pretty close to<br/>
him.  He was not bothering Sophia or even aware really that she was<br/>
there and went about his business.  I watched Sophia look at his mom<br/>
and wait until the mom was not looking at the boy then splashed him in<br/>
the face.  The splash itself is not a big deal but what bothered me<br/>
was the look on Sophia&#39;s face(mean) and her scoping out if the boys<br/>
mom was looking. The boy didn&#39;t seem bothered by the splash and Sophia<br/>
didn&#39;t do it again so I decided not to say anything. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045784300">i have a hard time w/ when other kids are downright cruel and seem to <br/>
single out my dd megh who is 4.5yo.  this happened recently w/ 2 kids <br/>
from 2 different families at one of my homeschool/unschool groups (i <br/>
don&#39;t know how they think combining homeschoolers w/ unschoolers is <br/>
somehow like-minded...it is but it isn&#39;t ya know...). i was apalled <br/>
at how my dd and her friend who is 5 were picked on...they were <br/>
peacefully playing. some of my friends from that group tell me to <br/>
have tolerance for the kids as they may have been having a bad day or <br/>
a hard time at home or whatever but still...it makes me not want to <br/>
be around these families if this is how rude their kids are.  <br/>
<br/>
now as far as kids bickering sometimes, i am alright w/ that...that <br/>
is a given.  like w/ your dd...although i do notice that w/ some of <br/>
meghans&#39; friends some are just always so mean after a while to <br/>
her...either totally shut off from her after a while, or are real <br/>
rude and selfish w/ megh after a while...i&#39;m considering not having <br/>
megh and this girl get together too much anymore cuz i&#39;m not liking <br/>
this girls&#39; attitude. she is schooled (not hs&#39;d or us&#39;d)...going into <br/>
kindergarten in the fall...been to preschool all year...her best <br/>
little girlfriend seems like a snobby little &#39;princess&#39; mainstream <br/>
type. ish!<br/>
<br/>
but these 2 kids i was telling you about(ages 4 or so and 7) were <br/>
downright bullying.  i don&#39;t care what their reason. they walked up <br/>
to megh and her friend and let them have it.  it was outrageous to <br/>
me.  the 4 yo boy walked up and kicked their pile of sand over and <br/>
then informed them that they cannot put sand on the sidewalk.....and <br/>
when the 7 yo girl came up to them she insisted they give her the ONE <br/>
and ONLY chalk duster they had for the chalk crayons HER family <br/>
brought to share with EVERYONE.  she was so rude. demanding it...said <br/>
MY family brought it...give it to me.  WOW. i just sat back <br/>
astonished at these 2 incidents.<br/>
<br/>
megh bickers w/ one of her little friends who is 5 but they always <br/>
make up. he even will hit sometimes (and she will hit him back) but <br/>
they make up.  i am not sure what to make of this relationship yet <br/>
but that he has a mama who is way too hard on him. so he lashes out <br/>
like she does so to speak in giving him rough handling and time <br/>
outs...etc.  it is hard being w/ mainstreamers! actually that family <br/>
is not a mainstream one, they are hs&#39;ers.  much more structured ones. <br/>
strict at home. ie. the mama who is my friend asks me the dumbest <br/>
questions challenging why i&#39;d pick a midwife over an OB and why i&#39;d <br/>
even do a VBAC considering the &quot;dangers&quot;...all hs&#39;ers are NOT created <br/>
equal.<br/>

And she&#39;s, how old, four you said? How do you teach your kids to <br/>
accept others and then call a little toddler a snobby princess??<br/>
<br/>
You probably wouldn&#39;t like my 3 year old then... she&#39;s a <br/>
total &quot;princess&quot; and can be a little snobby at times. But thats <br/>
her... and I love her just the same.<br/>

I hope nobody else would see her and put judgement on her like you <br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I do see my kids having more communication and problem-solving <br/>
skills than their schooled peers I have also found it important to <br/>
look at other children with the same unschooling eyes I use to view <br/>
my own kids. Kids do the best they can with what they have available <br/>
in terms of skills, knowledge and support. We can&#39;t know what kinds <br/>
of skills and knowledge other children have available to them, but <br/>
we have the potential to *be* part of that support. When we don&#39;t <br/>
feel up to being part of their support we can recongnize the ways in <br/>
which they are not being supported. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does your dd want? Is she upset by the interactions and wants <br/>
to avoid these kids? Morgan is sometimes upset in the moment but <br/>
cools down quickly and wants to play more. Other times she seems to <br/>
get along fine with other kids (and adults) but later will tell me <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to see person X for awhile. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, you used the expression &quot;after a while&quot; three times and I&#39;m <br/>
seeing that as a big Aha! So things start off fine? Maybe the other <br/>
kids are getting tired or in need of a snack or break. That&#39;s <br/>
something you can help out with. You can schedule shorter visits. <br/>
You can suggest or offer snacks. You can do something with Megh to <br/>
give the other kids a break. You can spend more time with the <br/>
kids &quot;after a while&quot; to help with the communication and problem <br/>
solving. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing you were too far away to say anything, but if these <br/>
sorts of interactions are common in this group, that&#39;s a good <br/>
indicator that you need to be spending more time closer to your dd <br/>
so that you *can* help out. If you were right there, did you work <br/>
toward reassuring the little guy that it was okay and y&#39;all would <br/>
clean up when you were done? Often that&#39;s all a young child needs in <br/>
that sort of situation - adult reassurance that &quot;its okay&quot; to break <br/>
whatever rule he&#39;s stressing over. No sand on the sidewalk, in this <br/>
case.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and ONLY chalk duster they had for the chalk crayons HER family <br/>
&gt; brought to share with EVERYONE.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So the parents decided to share the kids&#39; toys and one of the kids <br/>
wasn&#39;t happy about that? Poor girl. That sort of thing always makes <br/>
me really sad. I hope you validated her desire to reclaim her own <br/>
things and helped your dd find something else to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it is hard being w/ mainstreamers!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is. The hardest part for me is that conventional parenting <br/>
assumptions creep into my own thinking - all those shouldn&#39;ts and <br/>
musts and don&#39;ts - not really for my *own* kids, but those others. <br/>
Its much more helpful to look at other kids with compassion and try <br/>
to figure out what I can do to help smooth things over. Its <br/>
challenging and I don&#39;t always &quot;get it right&quot; in the moment - but I <br/>
do try to look at the other povs afterwards.<br/>

could not put my finger on what was bothering me about it- then it hit <br/>
me as I lay in bed thinking.<br/>
<br/>
You said that your kids were picked on by other kids and that this <br/>
made you upset. When I take my kids anywhere regardless of if we know <br/>
the kids or not I ALWAYS make sure I am near my girls (ages 4 and 2) <br/>
for 2 reasons one is for their safety and two so I can see what is <br/>
happening with other kids. <br/>
<br/>
If I saw any children picking on my kids I would go and stand next to <br/>
them and talk to them about their play- if children were being mean or <br/>
cruel I would talk to that child and say something like &quot;lets work it <br/>
out- you all get a turn&quot; or &quot;did you build that sand castle? was it <br/>
yours to knock down? did you ask them if you could knock down their <br/>
tower? <br/>
<br/>
When I am around a lot of children and I am &quot;in charge&quot; they will <br/>
often come and tell me when someone did something to them and I will <br/>
say to them tell that person what you thought or how you felt. It is <br/>
amazing to watch small children (3-4 years) go back and say &quot;do not <br/>
hit me or I did not like you pulling my hair.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
All this being said I hear your frustration when kids disrupt your <br/>
kids when playing by themselves but I think we need to discuss how to <br/>
handle it. Sometimes it is okay to yell at other kids to leave you <br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids are not bothered by other kids invading their play <br/>
space and others are. I tell my girls that they have the choice. Just <br/>
some thoughts to consider.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528443926">Hi, I&#39;m new here, and would like to respond because I&#39;ve recently <br/>
dealt with a similar situation with my 4.5 yo son. <br/>
I agree we should monitor our children&#39;s playtime with each other, <br/>
and even instruct them on how to defend themselves to empower them in <br/>
moments where they are being singled out by bullies. I also feel that <br/>
the other parents should be JUST as involved in watching out for YOUR <br/>
child. You would not let your child mistreat another child, and turn <br/>
a blind eye, and neither should they. If all else fails, and the <br/>
learning experience has passed with little results, I say take the <br/>
child out of the situation entirely. <br/>
 As for me, I addressed the problem repeatedly with my friend over a <br/>
2 year period, pulling away and limiting playdates. When I finally <br/>
saw that she saw nothing wrong with her son&#39;s bully behaviors, <br/>
actually citing Ryan&#39;s passivity as reason for her son&#39;s <br/>
aggressiveness, I broke ties with her (last Monday). Not an easy <br/>
choice for me, as it took me 2 years to reach this point., But I want <br/>
to teach my children they deserve to be with people who treasure <br/>
them, and they should feel free to walk away from people who mistreat <br/>
them. I only wish I had to nerve to do it earlier (I am one to give <br/>
benefit of the doubt long after someone deserves it.)    <br/>
<br/>
