My son is 4 and a half and about 6 months ago I explained to him how <br/>
cavities were formed, in full scientific detail.  Since then he has <br/>
been very good about brushing.  He is also really into microbes and <br/>
really understood what I was explaining to him.  There has to be some <br/>
kids book that explains how cavities are formed?  <br/>

My now 5 year old brushes her own teeth every night (w/o prompting) and also <br/>
rinses with a grape flavored flouride rinse once a week.  All because her <br/>
pediatric dentist is so wonderful :)  Once she explained about cavities and how to <br/>
take care of your teeth, it just clicked with Emma.  She&#39;s (Emma) has also <br/>
examined mine and dh&#39;s teeth and has seen all the fillings we&#39;ve had put in due <br/>
to us not taking very good care of our teeth when we were young.   I think she <br/>
(being very independent minded anyway) likes that *she is in charge of <br/>
keeping her teeth healthy.  She keeps an eye out of any new toothbrushes that come <br/>
out, and I happily supply her with whichever one she wants : )<br/>
