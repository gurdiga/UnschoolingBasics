<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553989389">Issue 6 of *Connections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting* is <br/>
now available online, offering some really terrific articles that we <br/>
hope will inspire and interest:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>
<br/>
Joanne Greco has a feature article in this month&#39;s issue, titled <br/>
&quot;Unschooling As a Tool for Healing&quot; where she discusses pulling her <br/>
children out of school to promote family bonding and healing from past <br/>
trauma from the foster system. Dayna Martin explores the connections <br/>
between Heavy Metal music and unschooling as she muses on the kind of <br/>
parent she strives to be in the other feature article, and Imagination <br/>
Station this month focuses on Brik Wars in the Rossing family. Never <br/>
heard of Brik Wars? Check it out--a whole new way to play with legos!<br/>
<br/>
Our regular columnists offer thought-provoking discussions in this <br/>
edition, ranging from learning despite &quot;Education&quot; to music festivals to <br/>
mantras and dreams. Also in this issue is Rue Kream&#39;s last Ask Rue <br/>
column--we&#39;ll miss you Rue!<br/>
<br/>
*Connections* is pleased to offer such an inspiring line up of articles <br/>
for Issue 6. Thank you all for your support and enjoy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry for the confusion. I just changed the format of the index page to <br/>
make the &quot;Subscribe&quot; page more obviously accessible. Now folks who visit <br/>
the main page will see in the left sidebar under &quot;Log In&quot; the option to <br/>
either view a sample issue or to go immediately to the subscribe page. I <br/>
also changed the sidebar on the sample issue as well to try to make the <br/>
subscription page more obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone may subscribe by going to <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like also to remind folks that usernames and passwords are *case <br/>
sensitive*, so log-in trouble 9.9 times out of 10 is solved by checking <br/>
the caps; only twice has it been a browser issue.<br/>
<br/>
There have also been a few instances of the username and password email <br/>
being dumped directly in people&#39;s spam folder. If you haven&#39;t heard back <br/>
after subcribing, *please* check your spam folder.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for everyone&#39;s interest and support!<br/>
