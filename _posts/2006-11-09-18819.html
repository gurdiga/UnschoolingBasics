<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087390955">To recap my situation- I have a 14 y/o daughter new to unschooling. She decided not to do ninth grade and at this point wants a diploma so she can get college credit for any classes she takes at the community college. She wants to prep for the California High School Proficiency Exam, which is the legal equivalent of a diploma. I know that as a private school I can issue her a diploma, but somehow that seems wrong to me at this time, since I have nothing to put on a transcript, should I ever be asked to provide one for any reason. I am also not sure what kind of example that would set for my daughter to just say &quot;you want a transcript?&quot; Heres one. Right now she is completely unschooling, and enjoying it, but she chose to take a photography class at the community college and is a bit bugged by the fact that due to her age, she wont get college credit. All this is complicated by the fact that we are both deschooling and I know that both of us havent entirely shrugged off all the schoo<br/>
lish notions. How do you deal with the diploma issue? Any feedback regarding this that will help me see things from an unschooling perspective is appreciated. <br/>

it a state law or is it a rumor that you have heard or even that has<br/>

an 8-hour intensive language course at uni this summer and has no<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246304752">My understanding is that if a child is under the age of 16, they cannot get college credit for community college courses, only High School Credit. I also heard that it is up to the individual community college whether they would grant the credit to children under 16, and each college does things differently. So far I have not been able to get an answer at our local community college. Also, my daughter is still deschooling, and still wants a &quot;real&quot; recognized diploma. Perhaps in due time she will realize it is not necessary. But after 9 years of institutionalized brainwashing, its going to take time to see things differently. I just dont know how to balance deschooling with facilitating her current goals and desires. If she feels like passing the proficiency exam is necessary to her, and what she wants to do, for whatever reason, shouldnt I assist her with that? I suppose she could go through the process and discover for herself its not really necessary. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750074211">This is probably getting too California-specific - if you want to  <br/>
write to me offlist, Kathryn, I can help you out if you need more  <br/>
information. Write to me at &lt;pamsoroosh @ earthlink.net&gt; --- Pam  <br/>

<br/>
Just get the CHSPE study guide published by Barrons - they have it at  <br/>
all the regular bookstores. There are two practice exams, plus a  <br/>
diagnostic exam, included. It describes the CHSPE and goes, in  <br/>
detail, into everything covered on the test.<br/>
<br/>
I tutor kids who want to take the CHSPE.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the CHSPE rules say the kid has to be 16 or in the 2nd  <br/>
semester of 10th grade to be eligible to take the test. Homeschoolers  <br/>
get around that all the time by listing the kid&#39;s grade as 11th  <br/>
grade, no matter how old the kid is. My oldest daughter took it at 14  <br/>
and passed it.<br/>
<br/>
The reason you&#39;re having trouble getting information about &quot;credit&quot;  <br/>
out of the college might be because they don&#39;t even fully understand  <br/>
the question. They have no authority to give &quot;high school credit.&quot;  <br/>
They are not a high school. If you (as a private high school, want to  <br/>
give high school credit for college courses, that&#39;s up to you, not  <br/>
them. They are a college - when they give &quot;credit&quot; it is college  <br/>
credit - the only distinction for them is whether it is  <br/>
&quot;transferrable&quot; or &quot;nontransferrable&quot; to 4-year colleges and  <br/>
universities.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of homeschooled kids in California take the CHSPE because it  <br/>
lets them enroll in community college just like any other college  <br/>
student - as a &quot;high school graduate&quot; they don&#39;t have to get special  <br/>
signatures and fill out extra forms just because they are under age.  <br/>
They can still take community college classes, for credit, without  <br/>
the CHSPE, at most ccs, but having passed the CHSPE makes the  <br/>
application and registration process easier. On the other hand, most  <br/>
of the cc&#39;s don&#39;t charge any tuition to nongraduated, under-age  <br/>
students, so it is often worth jumping through the extra hoops in  <br/>
order to save the $26 (soon to be $20) per unit fees.<br/>
<br/>
The other big thing passing the CHSPE does is allow them to work  <br/>
without having to obtain a work permit or obey minor work hours/days  <br/>
restrictions.<br/>
