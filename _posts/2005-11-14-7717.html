<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912302686">I have been reading anything I can get my hands on about homeschooling<br/>
and unschooling since my 15 yr old son informed me he wants to drop<br/>
out of school.  He is living with his dad right now, and dad is trying<br/>
to get a job in South Korea.  My son would have to attend an exclusive<br/>
private school there.  He suffers a lot of pressure in a school<br/>
environment and is bored with what they expect him to learn.  I am<br/>
working on my own issues from my schooling, as well as trying to find<br/>
the best way to show my partner that unschooling is the best way for<br/>
my son to have the life he wants.  I am more flexible about the school<br/>
system because I am a born rebel and I tutored GED for two years to<br/>
adult women.  I had to relearn math on a HS level in order to teach<br/>
it.  It was so much easier to learn as an adult!!!!  I&#39;m talking 32<br/>
years old...not 15 and expected to grasp it.  I am always<br/>
learning...every day I learn something, I seek out new things all the<br/>
time.  This is something I was never taught to do, just a natural<br/>
aspect of my personality...I know intellectually that, if I can impart<br/>
that same desire for learning to my son, he will be able to realize<br/>
his life&#39;s dreams.  It&#39;s just that I am afraid for him.  I look back<br/>
and wish someone had told me about unschooling when I was 14...yet I<br/>
feel panicked about doing this for my son.  I have trust issues with<br/>
him based on his lackadasical attitude towards life.  I am concerned<br/>
that he will miss out on learning necessary life skills unless I push<br/>
him, which is the antithesis of unschooling.  Yes, I am aware that my<br/>
son and I need to resolve the trust issue...does anybody have<br/>
suggestions for getting him started?  I plan on letting him decompress<br/>
this summer, as well as conversing about life, unschooling, etc.  I<br/>
have purchased a copy of &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and a couple<br/>
others for him to browse through and get ideas.  Seems like this is<br/>
enough for a start...any insights?  Anyone had a similar situation???<br/>
 Thanks!</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him based on his lackadasical attitude towards life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure you don&#39;t have my son?  ;-)  I have a 14 yr old, <br/>
though -- and I have heard stories about 15 yr old boys, from those <br/>
who have &#39;em.  When the 5th Harry Potter book came out (we are big <br/>
HP fans, and were in a lit. discussion group lead by another fan), <br/>
the mom, whose son was 15, said, &quot;BOY, did J.K. Rowling have 15 yr <br/>
old boys pegged!&quot;  So I&#39;m waiting....<br/>
<br/>
My son has always approached things differently than I do -- more <br/>
like my dh, I guess.  But I was amazed when, finally, years after I <br/>
knew he was a morning person, he finally figured it ot -- that he <br/>
thinks better first thing, gets more done, understands things <br/>
better, makes fewer mistakes, etc., first thing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am concerned<br/>
&gt; that he will miss out on learning necessary life skills unless I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>push<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him, which is the antithesis of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something I&#39;ve heard, and take to heart, is that unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
unparenting.  I view some of those things as family issues -- my son <br/>
is a member of the family, and as such, expected to help, too.  When <br/>
I ask him to do whatever (it varies), he generally does it <br/>
cheerfully (but remember, he hasn&#39;t hit 15 yet...), and does not <br/>
expect pay (I don&#39;t pay for that sort of thing, any more than I get <br/>
paid to do the things I am expected to do!)<br/>
<br/>
What does your son see himself doing?  My son (like so many other <br/>
teen boys, I think) decided he really likes designing computer <br/>
games, so he has made some of those.  (Currently too busy playing... <br/>
but that&#39;s another issue!)  I find that when I talk with my son, <br/>
voice any concerns I might have, he may have a different take on it, <br/>
or a solution that I would not have thought of. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, if you&#39;re not part of the solution, you&#39;re part of the <br/>
participate!  (Sorry, chem. humor.)<br/>

Sounds like you&#39;re off to a great start.  I also think you sharing your<br/>

<h4>Flo and Andy</h4>
<p><small><time>23 Jun 2007, at  5:08pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135293050">Hi!  I&#39;m Flo, mama to a four year old son and an almost three year old<br/>
daughter, in the Baltimore area.  I just joined this group recently, and<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking a little bit.  I&#39;ve read a little bit of John Holt (I&#39;m<br/>
reading Learning All the Time now and it&#39;s fascinating), I&#39;ve read The<br/>
Unprocessed Child-I&#39;m really interested in kind of how unschooling works in<br/>
everyday life.  I think that unschooling and unstructured learning are the<br/>
right path for my kids (my son has really already started to surprise me<br/>
with his discoveries and the things he&#39;s able to do without me ever having<br/>
&quot;taught&quot; him)-but I&#39;m also a former middle school teacher.  As such, the<br/>
idea of unschooling makes a lot of sense to me-just getting out of the way<br/>
and letting my kids learn their own way, at their own pace just seems so<br/>
empowering for them as opposed to traditional school experiences.  But I get<br/>
hung up when it comes to documenting, and I worry they may miss<br/>
something-that&#39;s the teacher in me I think, that I need to learn to silence.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear how unschooling sort of &quot;works&quot; for some of<br/>
you-what you tend to do on a daily basis and how you support their learning<br/>
without getting in the way of it.  Also, how you manage reviews and<br/>
documentation-kind of &quot;proving&quot; that learning has happened, for the local<br/>
school district, if you have to do that (we do here in MD).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks in advance,<br/>

Hi, Flo!!! My parents came from Baltimore, and I&#39;m a &quot;Baltimoron&quot; by proxy  <br/>
as a result ;) My grandparents live in Olney, my aunt and uncle in Forest  <br/>
Hill..and I &quot;grew up&quot; in College Park, eating Ledos (the original one, of  <br/>
course!) and then the Creamery at U of M! Yummy! ;) Let alone crabs at all the  <br/>
yummy, brown-papered places ;) Anyway, lol...sorry fo the Old Home Week feel,  lol <br/>
but welcome! This is such a cool list. I&#39;ve never been more (joyfully)  forced <br/>
to think critically. The list is my own self education, and I hope you  have <br/>
the same greatness from it that I have found. <br/>
 <br/>
Welcome! <br/>

Something that I found helpful when Mo was little was to keep a journal<br/>

did it for a few weeks before I realized just how much learning was<br/>
going on all the time! Pretty astonishing.<br/>

My stepson, Rayan, has only lived with us since Nov, and I keep a blog<br/>
for &quot;reporting purposes&quot; if you&#39;re interested in seeing how that looks.<br/>
He&#39;s registered through an &quot;umbrella school&quot; for tedious legal reasons,<br/>
and that&#39;s reflected in the blog, but the main &quot;reporting&quot; we have to do<br/>
is to his mom, so I rarely mention unschooling. Here&#39;s the addy if you<br/>
