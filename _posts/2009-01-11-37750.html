<br/>
Naomi Aldort will be hosting a telecall next Sunday (Jan 18) on<br/>
Unschooling.  It&#39;s actually a two part call - the first 45 minutes will be<br/>
one-on-one with a woman (who is currently unschooling her 2-year-old son)<br/>
dealing with feelings of anger toward her son; the second 45 minutes will be<br/>
a one-on-one about unschooling.  The unschooling one will actually be with<br/>
the husband (who has doubts about unschooling as do many husbands I know!)<br/>
and may or may not include the wife on the call as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The call is Jan 18 at 11AM PST and costs $20.  You will be able to listen to<br/>
a recording after the fact if you sign up and are unable to listen live.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass the information along to any other parents who might be<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
