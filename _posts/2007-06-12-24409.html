<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008705959">Hello again. :)<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make someone want something. Unschooling can seem scary and<br/>
weird. Remember, we are raised to think as homeschoolers are social<br/>
hermits who have no lives. Not to say some aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s important<br/>
to find other ways to socialize, but it might be good to befriend some<br/>
unschooling families, and invite them over for dinner some time. It<br/>
would help if they had teenagers, but it isn&#39;t that important. Try to<br/>
introduce them to some unschoolers who share similar interests. <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t force anything on them. Remember that the kids choices are<br/>
what unschooling is about. Or at least I think so.</div>

So, I&#39;ll ask again! How can I help my 2 older teens accept/want <br/>
unschooling<br/>
compared to the conventional education that they want right now? James <br/>

Grace is 15. I want them out of school and unschooling, they both want <br/>

<br/>
Making them stay home against their will is as bad as making thme go to <br/>
school against their will.<br/>

Besides leaving The Teenagers Guide by Grace<br/>

<br/>
How interesting are your homeschool days? How about making your days at <br/>
home *much* snazzier than their days at school? If you have a <br/>
fun-filled week planned, they may decide that unschooling looks like <br/>
more fun and stay home.<br/>
<br/>
Children WILL choose the better of the choices.<br/>
<br/>
Monday---A day at the beach or a day at school?<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday---A day full of popcorn, pizzas and movies in your pjs or a day <br/>
at school?<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday---A day making sushi or a day at school?<br/>
<br/>
Thursday---A day visiting the raptor center and picnicking or a day at <br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
Friday---A day building a butterfly garden or a day at school?<br/>
<br/>
If you have an interesting thing to do each and every day, you might <br/>
actually BE more stimulating/exciting than school. BE that stimulating <br/>
and exciting!!!<br/>

 <br/>
Two responses come to mind, and the second might strike people as  <br/>
manipulative. But school is manipulative, so you can decide what you  think...<br/>
 <br/>
First, you can&#39;t make them want something. You MIGHT be able to make them  do <br/>
it (and at 17 and 15, that seems unlikely) but you can&#39;t make them like it.  <br/>
And at 17, if he&#39;s been traditionally schooled all along and NOT hated it, <br/>
your  son may figure he may as well finish up. But you can let him know he has a  <br/>
choice, which is cool.  Your daughter, a bit younger, seems a more likely  <br/>
prospect.<br/>
 <br/>
So, my second idea. Bribe &#39;em. Is there something either or both would LOVE  <br/>
to do, but school gets in the way? Or something they want? Tell them you&#39;ll <br/>
make  it happen if they&#39;ll give unschooling six month&#39;s chance. Take them on an  <br/>
amazing trip or buy them kayaks, or whatever. Be clear that you KNOW you&#39;re  <br/>
bribing them, and why, and if they say no, accept gracefully and let them know <br/>
 you want to support them in ALL their decisions. If they agree, and six <br/>
months  later, want to go back to school, say thanks, and support them.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is wonderful, but an even better gift is letting them know that  <br/>
they have your support even if they make choices different than yours.<br/>

 Why not unschool right now to try it out.  Discuss with them what<br/>
they would like to do etc.  Then, after the summer, then can decide<br/>
whether to go back to school or not.  And make sure to tell them that<br/>
if they do decide to go back to school, they can leave it again at<br/>
anytime.  And reassure them that they are not giving up or failing!<br/>
<br/>
If they go to school, continue to do fun things with them even during<br/>
school hours - like say, pick them up early and head to the beach<br/>
together or whatever.  And YOU can stop worrying about grades,<br/>
homework, attendance etc.  Another option, if they don&#39;t want to give<br/>
up school entirely, is to just take the classes of their choosing and<br/>
leave the rest.  I know several homeschooled kids that do this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever they choose next year, you can continue to live your life and<br/>
lead your family in an unschooling direction.  Read Grace Llewellyn&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Guerrilla Learning&quot; so that if they do choose school, you can take it<br/>
not so seriously.  Focus on having great relationships with them and<br/>
listening to them.  Like someone else said, they will choose whatever<br/>
they feel is better choice for them, so if they are still choosing<br/>
school, you may have to do some deep thinking and talking to them<br/>
about why.  My own teen was very reluctant to leave school because he<br/>
thought homeschoolers were losers and he didn&#39;t want to be a loser.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, just a few thoughts!<br/>

option to school? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking to just let things happen. I read some of the other replies,  <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t DREAM of forcing either of them, no matter how dreadful I think  <br/>

I would LOVE to go, but not sure I can (afford, time, location). I must say  <br/>
that the kids feel that I am too much of a hippie, lol, and they don&#39;t want a  <br/>
thing to do with THAT kinda stuff...Ugh, ugh...They are very concerned with  <br/>
fitting in - the older one, James (17), is very aware of how he is still not  <br/>
comfortable enough to even drive my van (a minivan) to summer school. He  <br/>
admitted it, he is aware of it...so maybe if he HATES the summer school class he  <br/>
has decided to try and go to. So maybe after this summer, he&#39;ll fall into  <br/>
something different. He just simply doesn&#39;t trust himself. At all. Not with that  <br/>
kind of stuff. Same with Grace (15). They both don&#39;t think of themselves as  <br/>
smart (they are, very!) or capable (they are, of course!) of having &quot;book  <br/>
smarts.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Oh...One day, I hope they see what I see. I hope at least a glimpse comes  to <br/>
them. <br/>
 <br/>
So...I will back off verbally, and do more by showing :) Leave the book out  <br/>
and about and...yeah, well, there ya go, lol! <br/>

That&#39;s the odd thing - he did HATE it. I mean HATE it...we have tried  <br/>
various things this past school year and he is sooooo hesitant and untrusting of  <br/>
unschooling. Too &quot;hippie&quot; for him, as am I a lot of the time ;) Grace loves the  <br/>
social stuff from school - I see my &quot;job&quot; as showing them that social  <br/>
interaction doesn&#39;t really only come from school..in fact, Grace&#39;s best friend  she <br/>
met because they lived in the same neighborhood, not because they went to  the <br/>
same school, lol...go figure! ;) James has a VERY nice social life - busy  <br/>
every day with friends, despite not going to conventional school all this year.  <br/>
He has been at Global Village School - an online, wonderfully supportive <br/>
school.  But he hasn&#39;t liked it - he doesn&#39;t consider any of what he has been <br/>
doing  &quot;normal&quot; and he really just wants to fit in. I hope to help him see that he <br/>
can  and does fit in with a variety of types of people, in a variety of <br/>
settings. I  don&#39;t think either see their beautiful strengths and qualities that <br/>
well yet. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, my second idea. Bribe &#39;em. Is there something either or  both would LOVE  <br/>
to do, but school gets in the way? Or something they  want? Tell them you&#39;ll <br/>
make  it happen if they&#39;ll give unschooling  six month&#39;s chance. Take them on <br/>

know <br/>
you want to  support them in ALL their decisions. If they agree, and six <br/>
months   later, want to go back to school, say thanks, and support  them.<br/>
I actually like that idea, because they are thinking so conventionally,  <br/>
perhaps a conventional way to get this moving isn&#39;t a bad idea. I can&#39;t bribe  <br/>
them with too much stuff however - I do mean &quot;stuff&quot; like tangible objects, or  <br/>
high monetary value items - we are pretty much living to the penny as it is. <br/>
But  I will think on this...a trial sounds good...I also suggested to Grace that <br/>
if  she is unable to do well enough in conventional high school here with me, <br/>
that  I&#39;d really like the option to do homeschooling with her - not as a <br/>
punishment,  but as a way to help her get out of high school and move forward. She <br/>
knows that  *I* care little about grades - that I care about her spirit and <br/>
sense of self  first and above all else. We are becoming good friends :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is wonderful, but an even better gift is letting  them know that  <br/>
they have your support even if they make choices  different than yours.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
Yup, I agree. Thanks, Kathryn. I appreciate the help and advice! <br/>

Well, sort of. Grace was in conventional hs this past year at her dad&#39;s  <br/>
house, and is taking a summer school class because she failed math. James has  <br/>
been doing, sorta, lol, an online high school called Global Village, which *I*  <br/>
love (but it&#39;s costing me too much right now, even though they are a good price <br/>
 I feel) due to it&#39;s unschooly feel and open program, but HE doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
normal.  He just wants to be &quot;normal.&quot; (his word, not mine) and he is also taking <br/>
a  summer school class. Maybe they&#39;ll both hate it wildly and decide to stay <br/>
home  next year... ;) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If they go to school, continue to do fun things with them even  during<br/>
school hours - like say, pick them up early and head to the  beach<br/>

Never did. Was accused of being uncaring and not involved and even of being  <br/>
a bad parent - by them AND other family members (on their dad&#39;s side). But <br/>
yes,  the fun things - yes, yes! Good point to add them into it all. Sometimes I <br/>
can&#39;t  see the forest for the trees, lol...<br/>
<br/>
Another  option, if they don&#39;t want to give<br/>
up school entirely, is to just take the  classes of their choosing and<br/>
leave the rest.  I know several  homeschooled kids that do this.<br/>
I like that too, though I can only imagine the fun conversations with the  <br/>
local high school...(I went there, I think I am holding a grudge, lol)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever they choose next year, you can continue to live  your life and<br/>
lead your family in an unschooling direction.  Read  Grace Llewellyn&#39;s<br/>

Yes, and I will get that book, too. I love her writing and her expression  of <br/>
her ideas. <br/>
<br/>
My own  teen was very reluctant to leave school because he<br/>
thought homeschoolers  were losers and he didn&#39;t want to be a loser.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is it! YES!!! That is IT, 100%. They both are stuck in that horribly  <br/>
wrong impression. So much so, that I couldn&#39;t get them to attend a conference or <br/>
 any outings or anything...unless I bribed them, lol...which I might do! But <br/>
yes,  that is indeed the crux of the matter. And since it&#39;s totally untrue, <br/>
but hard  to show them...how do I show them that? And what does your son think <br/>
now? How  old is he? Does he live near me, lol..? Might he be willing to share <br/>
with me his  change in perspective? <br/>
 <br/>
Gee, thanks so much for that. It may sound silly, but even though they said  <br/>
those very words, I couldn&#39;t keep them in my head when discussing this with <br/>
all  of you. <br/>
 <br/>
This is REALLY helping all. The whole group is, actually...<br/>

Happily,<br/>

yes, both have done &quot;poorly&quot; in school, both show signs of dyslexia and  <br/>
james, now 17, was tested at his elementary school and was diagnosed with  <br/>
&quot;auditory processing disorder.&quot; he also has failed so many classes, that  credit-wise <br/>
speaking, he is a sophomore at best, when time-wise, he is to be a  senior <br/>
next fall. other teens, i think not. james has a good and active social  life <br/>
and grace is rather social too, though she has been at her very  conventional <br/>
dad&#39;s house this past year, so my familiarity with her social stuff  is pretty <br/>
nil. she did however, just last weekend, compliment me on my  parenting. she <br/>
says my trust in her allows her to trust me. i&#39;m hoping she can  begin to trust <br/>
