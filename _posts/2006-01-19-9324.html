<div id="ygrps-yiv-869280874">&quot;I am new to the unschooling way, so can you guys please give me an<br/>
overview of what the goals are of losing food controls?<br/>
My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only for a while.:) Nobody feels good if all they eat is sugar, kids<br/>
are no exception. Binging is normal at first, but rather than say<br/>
anything to your child, just start honoring their choices more...say<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; more.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit from my point of view, is a balanced, whole child. A<br/>
person that trusts themselves and knows their own body.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I also think you need to see the whole picture of a<br/>
child that isn&#39;t &quot;food controlled&quot;. I DO notice symptoms of hunger,<br/>
inbalance in my younger children and make sure to keep healthy foods<br/>
available. I will point out that they might need some protein, or<br/>
maybe a smoothie...I&#39;m not just putting out plates of candy and<br/>
ignoring them!<br/>
<br/>
We bring a wide variety of foods into the house...some would be<br/>
considered &quot;health food&quot; some would be called &quot;junk&quot;. It&#39;s just food.<br/>
Yeah, we talk about what is better for your body, but there&#39;s not a<br/>
bunch of guilt associated with eating things that aren&#39;t as healthful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just part of the ebb and tide of life. Sometimes I want chocolate<br/>
for days in a row, but then I feel like salad, salad, salad.<br/>
I want my children&#39;s choices to be honored, I don&#39;t want to send<br/>
messages that they aren&#39;t trustworthy.<br/>
When children are raised like this, they are quite adept at figuring<br/>
out what feels good and right for them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids will ask for things like brocolli, brussel sprouts, raw<br/>
sprouts, tofu etc...because I will also buy the candy, soda etc.. when<br/>
they ask (and sometimes just because).<br/>
<br/>
Your kids will only eat sugar if that&#39;s all you make available to<br/>
them. I dare you...I double dare you to put out a big platter of<br/>
crackers and cheese and grapes and carrots and dip and raisins and<br/>
peanut butter and apples and (well, use your imagination) and just<br/>
leave that big &#39;ol platter of yummy, healthy food on the table and<br/>
just see if it disappears. <br/>
Next time throw some chocolate chips on too...I bet they&#39;ll disappear<br/>
first...but then so will the other stuff. Eventually, they&#39;ll trust<br/>
that there will be chocolate chips anytime they want &#39;em and the<br/>
carrots might disappear first. Truly.:) <br/>
<br/>
Human beings naturally eat whatever is easiest and yummy (hey, we&#39;re a<br/>
lot like squirrels aren&#39;t we?). So make a nice assortment of food<br/>
easily available (usually &quot;junk&quot; food is the only thing readily<br/>
available..open and eat) and watch all that healthy stuff disappear<br/>
before your eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671449684">&quot; So, I&#39;d buy a box each time I went grocery shopping and he&#39;d<br/>
finish them off in a few days. Then they were on sale one week - 5<br/>
boxes $5. So I picked up 5 (actually, he was with me so I told him to<br/>
grab 5 boxes - he was grinning ear to ear as he stocked our cart with<br/>
them).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You reminded me of something I did a couple years ago.<br/>
Trevor LOVED Twix bars. He&#39;d ask for one every single time I went to<br/>
the grocery store. I&#39;d usually pick up 3 and they&#39;d be gone the same<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I finally got smart and bought a box at Sams club that had 36 bars or<br/>
some ungodly amount.  He ate and ate Twix bars, then decided he&#39;d had<br/>
enough.<br/>
He did ask for one when I went to the grocery store occasionally, then<br/>
that tapered off, then he decided he didn&#39;t want Twix bars anymore.<br/>
<br/>
He might eat one every couple of months. If your children act<br/>
obsessively about something, give them LOTS of it and they&#39;ll figure<br/>
out their balance. I&#39;m not recommending that to a diabetic or<br/>
anything..you have to get more creative if you&#39;ve got real life issues<br/>
that prevent this. But for the average person, let &#39;em eat sugar...it<br/>
gets really old (unless it&#39;s truffles and darjeeling, which I vow to<br/>
eat and drink for the rest of my life). ;)<br/>

occurred once we finally ran out of Swiss Cake Rolls. DS was with me <br/>
as usual (often the two of us go and leave DH home for some quiet time <br/>
since he&#39;s home with DS all day most of the time). I stopped by the <br/>
Swiss Cake Roll display (and they have all sorts of other snack foods <br/>
right there) and asked if he wanted anything. He said &quot;No thanks. Can <br/>
we go find the cottage cheese now?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I do want to reiterate one thing: he&#39;s a never regulated kid. For <br/>
someone who is used to being limited, portioned, controlled, going <br/>
slowly and just saying Yes a whole lot more is often more comfortable <br/>
for everyone. Kids don&#39;t get confused and mom doesn&#39;t suddenly freeze <br/>
up and worry when the kids eat more of the &quot;junk&quot; food than mom is <br/>
used to seeing. Put out lots of things to eat at regular times (mid <br/>
morning, midafternoon, early evening, in addition to the typical <br/>
breakfast, lunch, dinner times). Include the kids in grocery <br/>
listmaking, if not the actual grocery store trip. Just as I ask DH if <br/>
there&#39;s anything he wants picked up at the market, I specifically ask <br/>
DS if there&#39;s something he&#39;s wanting as well. Sometimes yes, sometimes <br/>
no, sometimes I pick up something he mentioned a few weeks ago and <br/>
forgot about. Like when he sees a PopTarts commercial and notes that <br/>
it&#39;s been a while since we had any. Several days later when I&#39;m making <br/>
the list, he might not remember that comment, but if I do (and that&#39;s <br/>
always iffy lol) I&#39;ll try to pick some up.<br/>
<br/>

got cookies! yummy homemade choc chip cookies!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve always been regulated, and part of helping *me* cope with being  <br/>
open is leaving a divided party tray out all day. The first few  <br/>
weeks, they were always eating, but now it&#39;s only happening when they  <br/>
are really hungry. I just refill each container as they empty. All  <br/>
kinds of dried fruits, nuts, crackers, pretzels, cheese, veggie  <br/>
sticks, and candy. We started right after advent began, our big party  <br/>
season, and it was because of all the candy we had around. I just  <br/>
left it out. It really works.<br/>

have always been just as likely to ask for fruit or veggies as they  <br/>
do sweets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977482891">This reminds me of something that happened recently with chocolate  <br/>
pudding cups. I&#39;d bring one package home from the store, and they&#39;d  <br/>
be gone by the end of the day. I wasn&#39;t really paying attention, but  <br/>
then I heard Eric start to say things like, &quot;Will there be enough  <br/>
pudding for me?&quot; and I realized that even though I wasn&#39;t consciously  <br/>
restricting the pudding cups, I wasn&#39;t buying enough of them to keep  <br/>
him from experiencing a feeling of scarcity, which resulted in him  <br/>
getting anxious about pudding cups and needing to eat them all at  <br/>
once to be sure he got his share.<br/>
<br/>
Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, I just without comment put two  <br/>
packages in the cart. It didn&#39;t make it through the week, so I picked  <br/>
up some more partway through the week. Eric liked opening the fridge  <br/>
and seeing so many there. He liked feeling like he could have as many  <br/>
as he wanted and there would still be more. He liked feeling so  <br/>
confident that there were enough that he could _offer_ pudding to his  <br/>
friends and little brother.<br/>
<br/>
I am still bringing pudding cups home every week, but he might not  <br/>
even eat one every day, and he doesn&#39;t dash to the grocery bags to  <br/>
get them out first thing. He still likes having them around, but he  <br/>
can forget about them sometimes because he knows they&#39;ll always be  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
It was an eye-opener to me to realize that he can experience a limit  <br/>
even if I don&#39;t perceive myself to be setting one. A new twist to  <br/>
keep in mind for me.<br/>
