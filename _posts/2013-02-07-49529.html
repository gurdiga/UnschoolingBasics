Martine  asks:<br/>
Gina, could you please share your link when you said: offer him the opportunity to learn how to create video games from an online source that was designed for kids his age.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m not Gina ;) but there&#39;s a free programming platform called Alice which is decent and easy to use - pretty straightforward for any kid who has played SIM type games. Mo liked it well enough, but prefers Scratch, another free program, since it lets her draw more of what she wants. It takes a bit of reading, but it also has some nice interactive tutorials.<br/>
