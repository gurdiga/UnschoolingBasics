<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595921712">Hi I just joined this yahoo group. I am a sahm of a my daughter Maddie <br/>
and I am beginning to research homeschooling and unschooling. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure where to begin and was looking for suggestions as well as other <br/>
unschooling families. I would like to learn more about natural <br/>
learning and gather info on some typical days as a <br/>
homeschooler/unschooler. Thank you in advance to any ideas or <br/>
suggestions!</div>
