they&#39;re full what they really mean is that they&#39;re<br/>
done eating as much of the whatever was served as they<br/>
wanted. I have now started asking if they want<br/>
something else instead. Sometimes I get a yes and<br/>
other times it&#39;s a no followed by a request for snack<br/>
a few minutes later. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of traffic on this list today and I&#39;m way<br/>
behind. So I&#39;m sure everything that I&#39;m going to say<br/>
has been said already. I&#39;m new here. I&#39;m unschoolish<br/>
(Thanks Pam for that word) and not a veteran at this.<br/>
<br/>
I too believed in family dinner times. Some of my<br/>
fondest memories are of dinner times. We would sit<br/>
around the table talking long after everyone was done<br/>
eating. So I tried to do the same. But it didn&#39;t work<br/>
and too much energy was being wasted in getting them<br/>
to eat &quot;properly&quot;, so that we didn&#39;t have much<br/>
conversation anyway. Looking back at my childhood I<br/>
realized that the family dinner routine was<br/>
established when we were all older - above 8 for sure<br/>
and did not need help with eating. Also that was the<br/>
_only_ time that we connected with our parents. So<br/>
I&#39;ve dropped the family dinner for now. We feed the<br/>
kids first if they&#39;re hungry or they eat whenever<br/>
they&#39;re hungry. The connecting still matters to me. I<br/>
work full-time and am not with them all day. But that<br/>
does not have to happen over dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea I had was that food had to be eaten at<br/>
the table and not elsewhere. Mostly because of not<br/>
wanting to clean up a mess everywhere. My kids would<br/>
much rather be playing than eating and would not eat<br/>
enough and then get up in the middle of the night<br/>
asking for milk. I&#39;ve decided that my sleep is more<br/>
important that rules about when and where to eat :-).<br/>
So I&#39;ve loosened my rule about eating at the table. I<br/>
decide based on the food item instead of it being a<br/>
blanket rule. I also feed the younger one while he&#39;s<br/>
chugging his trains or watching a movie. He eats more<br/>
willingly that way and I get a good night&#39;s rest.<br/>
<br/>
Also it helps me to acknowledge my own needs. So I let<br/>
them know when I&#39;m hungry or sleepy and hence likely<br/>
to be impatient. Sometimes they nap and then are up<br/>
jumping on the bed at 10.30 pm. I tell them that I<br/>
need to go to bed, but I&#39;m willing to read to them<br/>
right now and they don&#39;t have to go to bed<br/>
immediately, but won&#39;t get another book when they&#39;re<br/>
ready to go to bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747098630">&quot; I couldn&#39;t get her to <br/>
understand that it didn&#39;t matter if he ate one of his pieces of <br/>
turkey now or in 15 minutes.  What did it matter if he ate it now.  <br/>
He was hungry now. &quot;<br/>

I have a good friend that sort of understands unschooling, but is <br/>
still very traditional in some ways. They were over at our house for <br/>
dinner one night and her ds kept munching on some carrots I had out.<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;Don&#39;t eat any more of those, it will spoil your appetite.&quot;<br/>
I looked at her and said &quot;Isn&#39;t that the whole POINT of eating? <br/>
Those are probably healthier than anything we&#39;re eating for dinner!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked at me and said &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t know why I <br/>
said that!&quot;<br/>
It was an instinct reaction...leftover from how she was raised. <br/>
There was no thought or logic used, just a knee jerk &quot;don&#39;t eat <br/>
before dinner&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The whole &quot;spoil your appetite&quot; thing is SO stupid. Anytime you eat <br/>
you take away appetite...that&#39;s the whole POINT!!!<br/>
So people should eat when they&#39;re hungry and stop when they aren&#39;t. <br/>
We&#39;ll have a lot healthier society if everyone would do that.<br/>
