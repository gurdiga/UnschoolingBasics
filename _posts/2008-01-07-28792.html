<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734067489">Hello, I found this group from another site I thought I would introduce <br/>
myself. My name is Christina, I am a single mother of two daughters <br/>
ages 10 & 11. Currently they both are attending public school, however <br/>
we are moving out of the area and Im pretty sure Ive decided to home <br/>
school them both. So I have been researching, and trying to gather <br/>
different ways to best teach my children from home. Anyways, I&#39;m sure <br/>
as I search through the current posting I may find some great <br/>
information or suggestions. However if you have any links, or advice I <br/>
would be very grateful. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Christina</div>
