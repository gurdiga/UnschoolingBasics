<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110019356">Queana - I just have one second to type.  When my kids were at school and I<br/>
was haveing to deal with problems there every week or so, I asked my husband<br/>
to take a turn looking out for his kids, speaking to teachers and<br/>
headmaster, making sure the kids had what they needed for school, that sort<br/>
of thing.  That was a nice way of telling him that if he wants those kids in<br/>
school so bad, then he need to help handle the situation, &#39;cause I had had<br/>
enough of that stupid school and those hateful children my kids had to live<br/>
with all day long, every day, with no way out!!  I was impressed by how<br/>
quickly my dear husband, (who is a loving daddy) came around to support<br/>
homeschooling!  Once he saw how stressful it really was for the children and<br/>
for me, (esp. not being able to help my son protect himself!!), he changed<br/>
his tune.<br/>
    Also, as far as getting your 9 yo out of school immediately, maybe you<br/>
can find another homeschooling family for your son to hang out with while<br/>
you are at work.  Or two of them, on alternating days or something.<br/>
Personally, my kids would love to have some company, maybe there&#39;s a family<br/>
like ours in your area.  You just need someone to be with him during the day<br/>
while you are at work, right?  You don&#39;t have to be with him yourself.<br/>
Although that would be best, it&#39;s only for a few months.<br/>
     And I agree with Ren:  Don&#39;t buy a house based on two incomes!  Bad<br/>
idea even for people with no children.<br/>
    Also, I have never heard of graduating from 8th grade.  But I guess now<br/>
that it&#39;s so important to your son, you can&#39;t really do much but be<br/>
supportive....<br/>

 - if I quit to bring him home, I will not be able to afford my 8th<br/>
grader graduating with his class.  We will not be able to afford our new<br/>
house.  My husband would be very unsupportive of this idea (and he just<br/>
recently became finally supportive of homeschooling).</div>
