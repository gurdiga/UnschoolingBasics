HE wanted. And this wasn&#39;t constant, but he would do it  on and off for a <br/>
couple of years.  <br/>

Do you think he  wanted the structure or set learning time as a result of<br/>
having previously  been in school or do you think that&#39;s just  his<br/>
personality?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

*******************<br/>
Interestingly, it wasn&#39;t until a few years after he&#39;d been out of school  <br/>
that he wanted this. And it was never a schooly sort of thing. It was more that  <br/>
he would get distracted with some things he wanted to do and never get around <br/>
to  other things he wanted to concentrate on. He never devalued the other <br/>
stuff he  did as NOT being learning. So, I really don&#39;t think it was <br/>
school-influenced. I  think it was just him.<br/>

And how old was he then?  Just wondering.  It would seem to me that that<br/>
might be more likely to happen with an older child who had some specific<br/>
goals he wanted to reach.  <br/>
