<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145974738">&lt;&lt;We are sexual creatures.  And it is<br/>
natural for us to want to explore that side of us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if the person you want to &quot;experiment&quot; with is your sibling???  Two of my children were &quot;experimenting&quot; the other night.  No genital areas were touched, and there was no kissing because, as my 7 yr old put it &quot;I wasn&#39;t comfortable with that&quot;.  (whew!  that&#39;s a good thing!  LOL)  But there was touching and caressing and pecking on other parts of the body.  I asked them about it (in a very non-judgmental way) and my daughter said she wanted to see what it was like to have a boyfriend or a husband.  I explained that while she loved her brother, he couldn&#39;t help her to understand that because he was her brother, and she couldn&#39;t feel for her brother the way she would feel for a boyfriend or a husband.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is the second time that I&#39;ve found them playing this way, and it makes me apprehensive about them watching anything more than they already see.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else&#39;s children done this?  I mean, I did it too ---- with friends, not siblings LOL, so I&#39;m not upset at experimentation.  I just don&#39;t want my kids experimenting with each other.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865865643">Two of my kids experimented sexually with each other.  They were <br/>
adopted as infants and very close in age.  Their thoughts were that <br/>
they aren&#39;t &quot;really&quot; brother and sister, just legally.  That was a <br/>
twist to ponder.  I don&#39;t think it is an unusual thing.  In fact, in <br/>
certain societies it is considered quite the norm.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn&#39;t considered a &quot;good thing&quot; in our society and so we deal <br/>
with that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. My children (siblings that we adopted through foster care) were <br/>
sexually abused before we adopted them. About six months after we <br/>
adopted them, my youngest came to me and confided that there was <br/>
sexual activity going on, initiated by my middle child and involving <br/>
all three of them. Without having to go into private details, it was <br/>
much more serious than experimenting. It changed the way we live <br/>
from that day forward. They have a lot of healing to do and we have <br/>
certain safeguards set in place in an attempt to ensure safety for <br/>
everyone. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to reply because what you&#39;re talking about is <br/>
probably the kind of stuff all kids do and it&#39;s normal and healthy. <br/>
In our case, it wasn&#39;t and it was a very emotional time for all of <br/>
us. <br/>
