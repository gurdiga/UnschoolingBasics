&gt;teacher and she always told me to look a word up.  I wasn&#39;t excited to<br/>
&gt;do it, but I did. and I alays thought that I&#39;ll tell my kids the same<br/>
&gt;thing. When my dd asks me to spell a word, I ask her to sound it out<br/>
&gt;and I help her figure it out. Why is this so bad?<br/>

Hi.  I&#39;m new to the group too.  Very exciting stuff here, and I have my &quot;own<br/>
cup of tea&quot; that needs helps and will post soon.  But, as for &quot;go look it<br/>
up&quot;..........<br/>
<br/>
When I was (a child), and I asked my mother the same question, she gave the<br/>
same answer...&quot;look it up.&quot;  What do you think I did?<br/>
<br/>
I got mad at her and mad at myself for not knowing how to spell it.  And I<br/>
DID NOT look it up.  Instead, I dumbed myself down by choosing a smaller,<br/>
easier word to spell.  The sad part is that I still do this today.<br/>
UGGGG....what deprograming I still have to do.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, daily when I post emails, I cannot spell certain words. But, I do<br/>
have good news for you.  I can now spell the following words below because I<br/>
have misspelled them sooo many times that spell-check has automatically<br/>
&quot;looked them up&quot; for me.<br/>
<br/>

spelling.   What I remembered (other than to make sure I spelled it <br/>
correctly going forward) was the way she spoke to me, shaming me, <br/>
making me feel stupid, instead of being kind.  It hurt.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is still very new to me but one thing that<br/>
touched about asking a child to &quot;look-it up was the<br/>
following:  Would a child think that &quot;k&quot; would be the<br/>
place to look for the word &quot;cat.&quot;?  What about words<br/>
that don&#39;t follow the rules but break them? i.e.<br/>
break/brake Wouldn&#39;t a child more than likely go to<br/>
the &quot;bra&quot; spelling?  What about gnat? Or right, write,<br/>
rite? Read/red feed/fed? I guess I see the dictionary<br/>
as a valuable resource if one is looking up<br/>
definitions but not for someone who doesn&#39;t know how<br/>
to spell.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll ask my 7yo dd how she &quot;thinks&quot; something is<br/>
spelled and at the first missed letter I say, &quot;That<br/>
was a great try but this is how you spell it.&quot;  She is<br/>
also learning by typing on the computer (because she<br/>
wants to) and because of that is learning how to use<br/>
the spell and grammar check.  That is what is working<br/>
for her as of now.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271522860">If there&#39;s an &#39;oddity&#39; I might mention to DS (if he wanted to look <br/>
something up) something like &quot;that&#39;s one of those odd words - gnat <br/>
actually starts with g&quot; and let him go from there. Mostly I&#39;m right <br/>
there with him looking things up -together- so it&#39;s no big deal. <br/>
Generally, if he asks and I know the answer already, I&#39;ll just tell <br/>
him. Often, the odd words generate additional discussion (why in the <br/>
world is it spelled like THAT?) and THEN we pull out the dictionary <br/>
together and look up the roots of it - DS is 7 and is learning how <br/>
to decipher the linguistic backgrounds of words as noted in the <br/>
dictionary (he knows to look for OE or Fr or whatever and if it&#39;s <br/>
one that he hasn&#39;t met with, we check it out and find out what it <br/>
is).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817866397">Hi<br/>
My mil is nuts about spelling.  She took a letter my sil wrote her ( yes, my sil is not a good speller) and found all the spelling mistakes and wrote her back a 4 page letter telling her all the grammatical & spelling errors she could find and how to use a dictionary to look up &quot;her words&quot;.  I always found it difficult to look up a word I couldnt spell to begin with :)<br/>
Long story short: my sil wrote her a letter back filled with spelling mistakes on purpose.  She put a little sticky on it and said &quot;since your so bored with your life I&#39;ve sent you something to do........... look them all up please !!&quot;<br/>
As you can tell its not a good relationship but making her dil feel bad doesnt help.<br/>
And she wonders why my kids wont write to her  after this !!!<br/>

me to do things for myself. If I asked, she helped. I&#39;ve never felt<br/>
