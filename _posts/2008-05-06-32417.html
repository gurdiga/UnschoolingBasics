<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121400223">My daughter just turned seven last month. <br/>
<br/>
If she asks me what a word is, I tell her. I don&#39;t ask<br/>
her to sound it out or give her a mini-phonics lesson.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not interested in reading &quot;beginner books,&quot; but<br/>
she does like to listen to Junie B. Jones books, and<br/>
Judy Blume&#39;s Fudge books, on audio, then later read a<br/>
chapter or two of the book herself.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, she seems to struggle over reading<br/>
these, but she is not frustrated by it. What I mean<br/>
is, she doesn&#39;t seem to mind the struggle. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
say things like, &quot;This is so hard, I can&#39;t do this!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s where I&#39;m getting all weird and worried: Am<br/>
I making her struggle unecessarily because I&#39;m not<br/>
spending time teaching her phonics rules and things<br/>
like that?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that they are &quot;tools&quot; that will help her<br/>
accomplish her goal (of reading Junie B jones books)<br/>
and when I think of it that way, it seems like it<br/>
would be only kind to give her the tools she needs.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just worry that I&#39;m making things harder for<br/>
her by not giving her more information. Of course, if<br/>
she asked, I would tell her. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts about all this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jenny<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It makes sense that handing people the information first so they can  <br/>
do something would work best. But it isn&#39;t how human brains operate.  <br/>
If they did, schools would work wonders and everyone would come out  <br/>
as Harvard material ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We learn best by figuring things out and reaching for information  <br/>
when we can see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
For most people it&#39;s much easier to mess around with something new  <br/>
and then read the directions. Messing around gives us a structure to  <br/>
hang new information on and since we&#39;ve created the structure  <br/>
ourselves and are reaching for information that goes in a particular  <br/>
spot we want to figure out, it makes a lot more sense.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is handing us answers to questions we aren&#39;t asking we  <br/>
just have to memorize it. It isn&#39;t meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
If people like the answers before the questions, we&#39;d all just look  <br/>
up the answers to the crossword puzzles without trying them ;-) We&#39;d  <br/>
look at the last chapter to see who did it.<br/>
<br/>
Puzzling things out is fun :-) It&#39;s like a mystery story we get to  <br/>
figure out for real. And we can test our theories out for real. And  <br/>
we can interview experts to fill in gaps in our knowledge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821343681">***What I mean<br/>

<br/>
I think this is the key!  If she doesn&#39;t mind the struggle, then she is<br/>
doing just fine!  She obviously doesn&#39;t see a problem.  In fact, she&#39;s<br/>
probably enjoying &quot;solving the puzzle,&quot; as Joyce put it!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I would go about this, if this were my child:<br/>
I&#39;d notice that DD was enjoying doing what she&#39;s doing, and let her be.  If<br/>
at any time I sensed (or she directly asked me) that she might be interested<br/>
in &quot;phonics&quot; or any other reading strategy (Remember, there are many more<br/>
ways to read than by just using phonics!), then I&#39;d give her just a little<br/>
taste.  If she liked it, I&#39;d give her more.  If not, I&#39;d forget it.  And the<br/>
most important thing would be to always stay in tune with her, and not hop<br/>
on the reading train with my own agenda, just because she showed a spark of<br/>
an interest.<br/>
<br/>
She is enjoying reading right now, and that is the biggest thing that will<br/>
make her want to continue reading (and figure things out).  If she wants<br/>
more guidance, you&#39;ll be able to sense that.  She will either ask you<br/>
directly, or you&#39;ll notice, because you are in tune with her needs.  Just<br/>
don&#39;t make decisions based on your fear that she is not going to learn if<br/>
you don&#39;t teach her something.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even better, don&#39;t think in terms of some formal body of knowledge  <br/>
that&#39;s outside of her that she needs inside of her. Forget that  <br/>
there&#39;s some collection of rules out there that kids &quot;need&quot; in order  <br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
Picture it like this:<br/>
<br/>
Teachers face this huge pile of bricks stacked up for them that  <br/>
they&#39;re required to hand to the child in a specific order. They&#39;re  <br/>
always facing that pile and handing off bricks and judging to see how  <br/>
well they&#39;re transferring the pile.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t have a pile. They have the world around them. But  <br/>
instead of facing the world, they face the child. If the child asks  <br/>
for a brick, you hand it to them. But you&#39;re confident the child is  <br/>
running around picking up her own bricks because you&#39;ve got her out  <br/>
in the world (instead of locked up in the classroom with the bricks  <br/>
controlled by the teacher).  If you know of an interesting brick that  <br/>
would go with the one she&#39;s asked for or picked up, point it out. If  <br/>
she&#39;s interested, find more. If she&#39;s not, let it go.<br/>
<br/>
So, just answer her questions. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you have something interesting to add -- eg, &quot;Ph usually means the  <br/>
word was originally Greek,&quot; &quot;There&#39;s &quot;a rat&quot; in separate.&quot; -- add it.  <br/>
It could start a conversation, one that might lead well away from  <br/>
learning to read. That&#39;s how real learning happens. Things connect to  <br/>
other things in seemingly random fashion, but that&#39;s how we learn, by  <br/>
creating a huge multi-dimensional net of connections.<br/>
<br/>
By her reaction, by her body language, by her other questions judge  <br/>
if she wants more information. Get to know your daughter that way :-)<br/>

I like this analogy!  I think it&#39;s what I was trying to say, but since I am<br/>
new to unschooling, it probably sounded schoolish.  This is a great<br/>
unschooling way of looking at it!  I love it!  Joyce, you&#39;re awesome!<br/>
