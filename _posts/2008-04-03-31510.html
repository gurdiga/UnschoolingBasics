<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402302839">My 10 year old daughter is up all night and sleeps all day. She <br/>
spends most of her night watching ONDEMAND tv and surfing the net. <br/>
<br/>
She used to be totally ok with this, except for the occasional day <br/>
when she wanted to go somewhere specific and was too tired to get out <br/>
of bed to make it there. <br/>
<br/>
Lately, however , I think she&#39;s been very lonely on this shift, as I <br/>
am asleep during those hours. <br/>
<br/>
Last night she woke me up 4 times! Once because she had read about a <br/>
pregnant man, and wanted to discuss how that was possible. Another <br/>
time to watch a youtube video of a video game she had found that had <br/>
creeped her out. Another to show me that she learned all the words to <br/>
a Japanese song (in Japanese!) that she had listened to on the net. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great she&#39;s coming to me when she is puzzled by <br/>
something, or finds something neat and wants to share it with <br/>
someone..but it&#39;s hard for me to be there for her at 3:30 AM!<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to her a little about sleeping at night instead of day, <br/>
but she says she is not even tired at night, and doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>
make herself so. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot stay up all night (though I did try to stay awake until 1:00 <br/>
am for her,  and woke up when she called me!) Today I am completely <br/>
exhausted! I don&#39;t function well on such little sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I think she would like to sleep at night..but she&#39;s always been a <br/>
night owl, and we don&#39;t know how to straighten her out. Sometimes, we <br/>
can get it under control for about a week, but before too long, she <br/>
slips right back into it.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on how we could find a way to spend time together without <br/>
one of us losing much needed sleep?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254875214">Don&#39;t know that it would help necessarily but my almost-10 yr old son<br/>
has taken to being up much of the night and sleeping during the day (as<br/>
we speak he&#39;s asleep after having been up late/early - he greeted me<br/>
when I got up around 6 to get ready for work, he was already downstairs<br/>
watching TV - for whatever reason, he sometimes prefers getting up and<br/>
going downstairs to just watching TV in his room in the morning - and<br/>
had already fed the fish in the aquarium - then he fell asleep somewhere<br/>
between then and when I finished breakfast around 7:15). When there&#39;s<br/>
something he wants/needs to be up in the morning for, when he knows he<br/>
needs to get to sleep *before* midnight (and he&#39;s had the freedom to<br/>
explore the whole concept of &#39;enough sleep&#39; since he around 4 or 5 when<br/>
bedtime went byebye), he generally just snuggles in our bed with us<br/>
instead of going to his room once *I* need to turn out the lights and go<br/>
to sleep (which is usually between 10 and 11). Yeah, sometimes he pops<br/>
in at random times (like the other night, he popped in 2 or 3 times to<br/>
tell me tidbits of whatever) but by and large he knows I need my sleep<br/>
to get up for work. If he starts feeling lonely, he knows he&#39;s always<br/>
welcome to come quietly snuggle in with us for the night or for a few<br/>
minutes or hours, his choice. I noticed that if he stayed in with us,<br/>
he&#39;d fall right to sleep many times where if he chose to go back to his<br/>
room, he&#39;d be up for hours longer so I try to deliberately encourage him<br/>
to stay and snuggle with me on nights before we have something the next<br/>
day (even if it&#39;s an evening event, since by then he&#39;s usually ready to<br/>
sleep and needs to be home and able to just curl up and sleep). I don&#39;t<br/>
even try to be &quot;all there&quot; at 3 am for DS - I&#39;ll wake enough to<br/>
acknowledge that he&#39;s talking to me but if it&#39;s something that warrants<br/>
further discussion, I&#39;ll ask that he remind me of it during the day so<br/>
we can talk more (most often it&#39;s tidbits about a plotline or a future<br/>
broadcast that he just found out about or whatever - like when he found<br/>
out that the entire Star Wars saga is going to be broadcast starting<br/>
soon (tonight?))<br/>
<br/>
All that to say, perhaps find a way (discuss together) to encourage<br/>
earlier to bed when there&#39;s something she wants to do in the morning.<br/>
Oh, also, DS will sometimes request that I make him a &#39;relaxing<br/>
beverage&#39; and I know just what he wants - take a cup of milk (dairy or<br/>
not as you prefer) and add a pat of butter (or butter like substance of<br/>
your choice, but real butter tastes best in this). Microwave for about a<br/>
minute, until the butter is pretty much melted. Stir in a favorite<br/>
sweetener to taste (we use honey or agave nectar but real maple syrup is<br/>
also really good here). It&#39;s usually just warm enough to sip right away<br/>
(not too hot) and it is quite relaxing even if non-dairy milks don&#39;t<br/>
have the same &#39;sleepy&#39; chemical in them, the warmth is often enough to<br/>
relax things - it&#39;s also very soothing to a dry or scratchy throat (but<br/>
not so good if there&#39;s a lot of mucous involved). Plus, I&#39;ll usually sit<br/>
there in the kitchen with him while he drinks it so it&#39;s a way to unwind<br/>
in the quiet as well. Yeah, he could do it by himself (he can handle the<br/>
microwave like a pro when he wants) but having me there seems to help (I<br/>
try to &#39;exude&#39; sleepy thoughts/vibes at him lol).<br/>
