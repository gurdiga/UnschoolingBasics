<div id="ygrps-yiv-613210818">Wow, I just knew I&#39;d get some clarity from you all.  Thank you so <br/>
much for helping me sort through things and get to the heart of the <br/>
matter!  All of what was posted, whether I agree or not, has given <br/>
me so much food for thought.  That, plus a very good discussion with <br/>
DH this morning, and I&#39;m in a much better &quot;head screwed on right&quot; <br/>
sort of place.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your time and honesty.  I do believe that we can <br/>
continue moving toward unschooling in our whole lives even though we <br/>
didn&#39;t start out that way -- although I think it must be easier if a <br/>
family doesn&#39;t have to overcome damage from a control-paradigm.  I <br/>
totally see that I was focusing on the negative -- precisely what <br/>
was bugging me about DD-8yrs.  (Freaking ice cream cone for on top <br/>
of the bowl!  Argh!  I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten so wrapped up and could <br/>
have seen that simple solution!)  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote our summer had been excruciating -- but you know what???  A <br/>
few moments, a handful, maybe two handfuls really are all that were <br/>
excruciating (probably only because I made them that way!) and they <br/>
were in the context of an incredibly fun and adventurous summer -- <br/>
we did some way cool things and had tons of fun and togetherness!  <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;ve talked (DH is supportive of unschooling, he&#39;s just got <br/>
more authoritarian baggage to unpack than I do -- I&#39;ve got plenty of <br/>
other sorts of baggage though, lol) and we too are parenting in the <br/>
gap (love that!) but are committed to making this work.<br/>
<br/>
DH actually asked me a very interesting question: &quot;Are you using <br/>
unschooling to control things?&quot;  And we spent some time on the idea <br/>
of &quot;if I get it right all will be peaceful and pleasant and perfect <br/>
and happy all the time&quot; being a pipe dream and what is more <br/>
realistic.  Anyway...I just wanted to thank you and let you know <br/>
that I&#39;m now processing your replies and working with DH and think <br/>
we&#39;re on track again.  It&#39;s good to know that I can come back here <br/>
if another stupid ice cream sort of &quot;incident&quot; occurs and you&#39;ll <br/>
give me the swift quick I need to see clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
