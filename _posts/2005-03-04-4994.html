<div id="ygrps-yiv-137395986">I have a very dear friend whose daughter was just suspended from <br/>
school for the rest of the year.  It&#39;s a long story but is wrapped <br/>
up in some very oogey thought patterns by the school administration <br/>
and security (like not being able to recognize metaphors!)  Anyway, <br/>
the school now considers them &quot;homeschooled&quot; and I would love to <br/>
find a good supportive non-judgemental group (or family) for them to <br/>
be involved with in the Tulsa area (they actually live in Jenks).  I <br/>
really think her dd would be fantastic as an unschooler.  She has a <br/>
wonderfully creative mind and is very expressive.  She just has a <br/>
problem with authority ;-)<br/>
