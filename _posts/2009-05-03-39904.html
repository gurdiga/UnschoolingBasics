<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026938427">...for anyone interested. I was interviewed for an online article about home/unschooling:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.babygooroo.com/index.php/2009/05/03/oh-yeah-school-about-that%E2%80%A6/">http://www.babygooroo.com/index.php/2009/05/03/oh-yeah-school-about-that%E2%80%A6/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty good article over all. Though we don&#39;t use our garden to teach any &quot;lessons&quot;...but most people don&#39;t really understand the difference between teaching and learning anyway. Other than that, I thought it was very positive and well written.<br/>
