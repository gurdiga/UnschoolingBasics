<div id="ygrps-yiv-484731109">My son (11) is trying to making an electronic listening device.  He wants it <br/>
to collect distant sounds in order to amplify them.  The Radio Shack guy said <br/>
to go online and find directions as to what he needs but we have not been <br/>
successful in our searches.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want a premade kit but wants to make this completely on his own.  <br/>
Any suggestions for websites that we could go to that might point us in the <br/>
right direction?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068429996">I think I saw something like this in an old Popular Science magazine. <br/>
It was the shotgun type (a microphone in a tube), but I don&#39;t see why<br/>
there shouldn&#39;t be something parabolic out there.  I think they are<br/>
called Directional Microphones.<br/>
