<div id="ygrps-yiv-903566974">My son who is 21 months has decided that everything is worth throwing<br/>
LOL, especially food/plates/flatware at the table.  I realize this<br/>
will pass, but while I find it mildly amusing at home, DH does NOT,<br/>
and we do socialize quite a bit with my IL&#39;s who like to eat out and<br/>
then it is NOT amusing, and it can be downright dangerous when it&#39;s a<br/>
fork.  How can I handle this?  Obviously he is too young to<br/>
differentiate between what is OK to throw and what is not, but how can<br/>
I communicate this to him?  He uses plates/ flatware and even if we<br/>
just placed the food on the table in front of him, he&#39;d throw the<br/>
food.  FWIW, we have tried ignoring it, but that does not seem to make<br/>
a difference.  Any words of wisdom here?<br/>
TIA<br/>

   <br/>
  Maybe you could opt out of these dinners for a few months? This phase would probably pass by then..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198880568">my dd went through this also. i know this sounds crazy but it worked <br/>
for me....<br/>
<br/>
when we would go into a restairant I would ask for extra straws i <br/>
would let her rip the paper from the straws into small pieces and <br/>
throw them all over. when she would reach for another object i would <br/>
say no we dont throw that and make a &quot;nasty&quot; face (like i was saying <br/>
ewww) and then hand her back some more paper and make an very happy <br/>
(almost stupid looking lol) face when she threw it.<br/>
<br/>
the paper cant travel very far since its so light and it kept her <br/>
busy and when we got up id just pick it all up off the floor since <br/>
it didnt leave a mess and was quick and easy to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
she got to have her fun and i got to eat without all the looks from <br/>
neighboring tables.<br/>
<br/>
try it :)<br/>
