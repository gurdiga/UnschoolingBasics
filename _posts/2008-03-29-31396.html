<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033362483">Hi, my thinking is far from clear, I could use some help with this one!<br/>
My son is enrolled in a charter school. I chose this route because of <br/>
the budget, but am having a VERY difficult time going back and forth <br/>
between two ways of thinking....supporting my childs interests and <br/>
having great times with him, and then categorizing what we&#39;ve been <br/>
doing/providing &quot;proof of learning&quot; to meet the requirements of this <br/>
charter. I feel that not having any connection with the charter school <br/>
would be the best choice to free up my thinking to more easily provide <br/>
the environment that is best for our family, but am still wondering <br/>
what I can do to make it work for us. Maybe pro/con lists for using a <br/>
charter and for going it alone...lol, but serious! Did any of that make <br/>
sense?!?<br/>

We are also with a public charter school and I go back and forth about<br/>
staying.  We&#39;re in California, and with the current question about the hoops<br/>
one will need to jump through to homeschool here, I&#39;m so far deciding to<br/>
stay with the charter.  They cover me legally, give us funds for tons of<br/>
resources, and our charter is quite easy to work with for unschoolers.  You<br/>
do have to submit attendance charts and a monthly chart of what was covered<br/>
for each subject.  Most months are so easy - I just leave the chart on the<br/>
fridge and when anything comes up that could feasibly fit under a category<br/>
(and usually under several!) I jot it down.  We turn in portfolio samples<br/>
four times a year, and my Educational Specialist (teacher we&#39;re assigned to)<br/>
accepts just about anything; photos, drawings, craft samples, blog entries,<br/>
etc.  The biggest stickler for me is the annual STAR testing each year<br/>
(California test for all public schooled kids).  However, with the way the<br/>
law may be swinging out here, I&#39;m guessing that might be a requirement for<br/>
all homeschoolers anyway when all is said and done.  So we&#39;re hanging with<br/>
the charter for now.<br/>
 <br/>
But I hear ya on the wavering - there are definitely some weeks where I<br/>
stress that we haven&#39;t written down anything or history or science or (fill<br/>
in the blank)!  But it usually resolves itself in a few days.  When it gets<br/>
really tough, our ES is very helpful in brainstorming things we might have<br/>
done that will fill in the chart.  I definitely think having her on our<br/>
&quot;team&quot; makes it much easier.  I can see that with a stricter ES - or one who<br/>
just doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling - it would be more of a challenge.<br/>

What did you get with the money that makes it worth this?<br/>

I think you&#39;ll be glad you did it - you won&#39;t miss that money and  <br/>
you&#39;ll feel so MUCH more free. It changes your perspective when you  <br/>
become truly independent. Really!<br/>

the judges have decided to reconsider the case. That most likely means  <br/>
the outcome will be in our favor. It will make our position even  <br/>
stronger than it ever was before, and we can feel even MORE secure  <br/>
homeschooling as the most private of private schools with no  <br/>
government restrictions, oversight, or reporting on our children of  <br/>
any kind at all.<br/>

ourselves. Money was the main reason, but there were actually <br/>
many...that haven&#39;t proved to be of any use, mostly just added to the <br/>
hassle. Yuck. <br/>

in fact, much of what is on our &quot;wish list&quot; would not be approved by <br/>
the charter anyway...<br/>

reading/writing about this I&#39;m figuring out what&#39;s holding me back is <br/>
some personal stuff. Which to address first is what I should be <br/>
figuring out, I guess :) This schooling/lifestyle choice sure has <br/>
brought up a lot of &quot;stuff&quot;! I absolutely love it, never felt better!<br/>
