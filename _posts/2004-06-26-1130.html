<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938488855">&quot;I&#39;ll turn 50 next year and one of the things I&#39;m planning for myself :) is to get our family to next year&#39;s Live & Learn convention.  I get goose bumps just thinking what that experience would mean for my dh and dd!  I&#39;m also hoping that we can make it to Ren&#39;s?? beachparty since we&#39;re really not THAT far <br/>
away!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well you&#39;ll be happy to know, that Ren&#39;s beach party is now officially the next Live and Learn conference!:) So you can take one trip and get it ALL in. <br/>
I expect all of you to start saving money to come hang out with me at the beach, and listen to some great unschooling speakers. I&#39;m actively working on a venue right now and expect to have some information for all of you in the next month. In the mean time I&#39;m driving Kelly and Kathryn nuts by asking them a million questions!!<br/>
<br/>
And Sheri,<br/>
Don&#39;t feel the conference won&#39;t be useful and WONDERFUL for your family, just because you&#39;re in Canada. It&#39;s not about laws and technicalities, it&#39;s about unschooling.<br/>
The workshops are amazing, the speakers inspirational and meeting 300 other unschoolers is truly MAGICAL!! The two conferences we&#39;ve attended are huge highlights in my children&#39;s lives.<br/>
They are busily helping me plan next year...totally excited and bummed that it&#39;s so far away (though I am relieved, I need time to plan!).<br/>
<br/>
So I hope many of you will plan to visit our beautiful beaches next year. The hotel will be on the beach and the weather is perfectly lovely in October.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237832241">&quot;Can you recommend a good book that isn&#39;t too heavy in it&#39;s presentation that<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t recommend one specific source that is a simple read...though I could recommend many good parenting books. One of the best is &quot;Living joyfully with children&quot; by Winn and Bill Sweet (in my opinion).<br/>
I think all the Non-violent communication stuff is really helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as child development, I read the typical books about &quot;your baby from birth to 5&quot; kind of stuff...also my Mom&#39;s college texts (she got a degree in early childhood education while I was in HS). I think the best way to get a quick, simple overview of child development is to google Piaget&#39;s theories, which have held up fairly well over time, where Freud&#39;s have not.<br/>
Keep in mind, there is going to be some mainstream thinking in there...what I found most helpful was simply how the brain develops, because your realize that a lot of what we expect kids to possess at certain ages, just isn&#39;t possible! They can fake it, to keep parent&#39;s happy, but they just can&#39;t truly understand certain concepts. You realize how stupid it is to push math and reading at young ages in light of some of this developmental stuff...and you wonder how teachers can learn the theories and not see this!<br/>

<br/>
I was thinking the same thing!  I want to second &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot;.  It totally changed my thinking on parenting.  Its wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would also recommend &quot;Everyday Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting&quot;  by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn.   Again it isn&#39;t talking about developmental stages,  but it talks about being present in the moment, for your children.  I&#39;m reading it now a second time,  there&#39;s so much wonderful information in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766595486">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am going to be working on coming to your conference next year. A beach in<br/>
Oct should be an easy sell for my family and so it just might work. We can<br/>
arrange a side trip from there after the conference as we often travel in<br/>
Oct and Jan each year and Florida is a good taking off point.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info,<br/>
