<div id="ygrps-yiv-127499261">Hello.  I&#39;m Beth and my DS is almost 16 months.  I also have a 6 1/2 yo <br/>
stepson who I do some supplemental homeschooling with.  He&#39;s in PS and was not <br/>
ready for academics which start so early in PS (Kindergarten).  So my DH and I <br/>
have had to do some things to help him get caught up and stay caught up.  I&#39;m <br/>
planning to unschool my DS, although I&#39;m just now becoming more comfortable with <br/>
the idea of completely unschooling.  I may lean more towards relaxed <br/>
homeschooling until I build my confidence (please don&#39;t feel you need to convince me - <br/>
I know it works.  I just need to get the &quot;school&quot; out of my head! &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing how ingrained it is).  <br/>
 <br/>
I just wanted to pipe in (no pun intended) and say I was glad to see the post <br/>
about teens and pot.  I&#39;m a long way from that stage, but I really like the <br/>
way you handle it, Kelly.  It&#39;s so nice to hear about how other parents handle <br/>
situations like this.  My own opinions on pot are very liberal although I knew <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to make it seem to my kids that it was ok to do everyday or <br/>
even in the house.  So, thanks for posting how it works in your family!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943934081">Hi I just joined this list!  I have been UN schooling my two kids  Michelle <br/>
age 12 and Henry age 15 since 2000.  we live in Mass.  I just  joined HSLDA too <br/>
for the first time.  Since we may be changing towns i  think i may need them, <br/>
the new town insists on TESTING yearly and my children  havent tested  since <br/>
I took them out of public school.  I am going to  try to keep them under the  <br/>
school theyre under now , after all theyre  monitored but aren&#39;t taking any <br/>
taxpayer resources for their education in the  town.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for letting me join! I have already found sources of information I  <br/>
didnt even know were available to me<br/>

If you haven&#39;t sent your money in already, you might want to reconsider  this!<br/>
 <br/>
H$LDA will NOT support unschoolers. You will waste your money. They have an  <br/>
agenda, and it doesn&#39;t include us weird, liberal unschoolers!<br/>
 <br/>
MA is a hotbed of unschooling----talk with folks who are unschooling. Go to  <br/>
the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Peabody in August. Do a little  <br/>
research before signing up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your individual city, school system and county MUST abide by the <br/>
state&#39;s laws regarding homeschooling.  They can&#39;t just make up their <br/>
own or they&#39;re not within their legal &#39;rights&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in luck being in MA!  There&#39;s an unschooling conference in <br/>
Peabody that I&#39;ve heard will be wonderful.  :)  I just wish we could <br/>
swing it this year.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139035911">Hi Lin - I&#39;m in MA too.  The town cannot insist on testing.  They have to<br/>
come to an agreement with you regarding what form of assessment you will<br/>
use.  Have you talked to any homeschoolers in the new town?  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216909300">Hi Lin,<br/>
<br/>
If you have homeschool legal questions of any kind - hassles from <br/>
local school administration, questions about what&#39;s within your <br/>
rights as a homeschooler, etc, please feel free to contact Deborah <br/>
Stevenson, the executive director of National Home Education Legal <br/>
Defense (NHELD). The goal of NHELD is to have a network of local <br/>
attorneys who specialize in educational law and are licensed to <br/>
practice in their home states(many members of HSLDA would not have <br/>
access to a lawyer who is knowledgable in educational law and/or is <br/>
licensed to practice law in their state if there is a problem).<br/>
<br/>
The website is www.nheld.com and here is other contact information:<br/>
National Home Education Legal Defense<br/>
<br/>
Attorney Deborah G. Stevenson<br/>
<br/>
Executive Director-NHELD<br/>

<br/>
And here is a brief Bio on NHELD:<br/>
<br/>
NHELD was founded by Attorney Deborah G. Stevenson. She has a <br/>
private practice in Southbury, Connecticut, handling cases in all <br/>
aspects of education and appellate law. In addition to her legal <br/>
practice, Attorney Stevenson is also a veteran homeschool Mom and <br/>
founder of Connecticut&#39;s Citizens to Uphold the Right to Educate <br/>
(CT&#39;s C.U.R.E.) and Executive Director of Home Education Legal <br/>
Defense of Connecticut, newly reorganized as National Home Education <br/>
Legal Defense or NHELD.  CT&#39;s C.U.R.E. has operated continuously <br/>
since 1989 as a grassroots citizens group dedicated to assisting <br/>
parents who wish to maintain the freedom they currently have to <br/>
educate their own children in the best manner possible. NHELD also <br/>
assists local public school districts in providing accurate <br/>
information about education law and in mediating any disputes with <br/>
parents, and additionally assists in providing information to state <br/>
Department of Education officials and legislators on the subject of <br/>
home education and parental rights.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202927492">Hello, my name is Stephanie, I&#39;m a SAHM to Corbin (3) and Daniel (18 months) with our third coming in June. We are AP parents and always knew we wanted to homeschool (I was homeschooled for 4 years). It wasn&#39;t until the last year when Corbin started to show his learning style that I thought about UnSchooling. He&#39;ll absorb anything very quickly from a book or video, but you put a textbook or worksheet in front of him and he freezes. I have a lot of questions about Unschooling, mostly just the typical newbie ones. Does anyone have any websites or books to share that would be good for a beginner? Thanks!<br/>
