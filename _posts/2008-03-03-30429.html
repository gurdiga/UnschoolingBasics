<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816882484">This is a question that a lot of new unschoolers struggle with: when  <br/>
helping them might not really be helping them but easing our fears.<br/>
<br/>
Another gem from Scott Noelle :-)<br/>

:: Helping vs. Co-creation ::<br/>
<br/>
    Q: How do you know when it&#39;s appropriate<br/>
        to offer your child help/assistance?<br/>
<br/>
    A: When the offer feels *inspired* rather<br/>
        than fear-based.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re coming from a perspective that your child is<br/>
helpless, damaged, weak, incompetent, lost, wrong,<br/>
etc., then your &quot;help&quot; will only give power to that<br/>
belief. It won&#39;t feel inspired to you, and it won&#39;t<br/>
inspire your child to connect with his or her Power.<br/>
<br/>
But if you consciously shift your perspective to one<br/>
in which you see your child as capable of finding his<br/>
or her way, you won&#39;t feel like you &quot;should&quot; help, and<br/>
you probably won&#39;t offer to help unless asked.<br/>
<br/>
However, you might be *inspired* to get involved in a<br/>
way that doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re a &quot;have&quot; helping a<br/>
&quot;have-not&quot; -- it&#39;ll feel more like two souls playing<br/>
together, co-creating purely for the joy of it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672825228">Thanks Joyce for forwarding Scott Noelle&#39;s blurb today.  I was just about to forward it and noticed that you beat me to it.  I have often opened my mouth to &#39;help&#39; one of my girls, and realized it wasn&#39;t help at all, but coming from my own fears.  I think the simplicity of this question and answer are brilliant!<br/>
