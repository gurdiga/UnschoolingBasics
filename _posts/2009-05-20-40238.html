<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186425015">I just wanted to give everyone the heads up that this is a conference<br/>
weekend and traffic might be dramatically slowed!<br/>
If a question is posted, there might not be a flurry of answers until next<br/>
week Tuesday (or later, depending on travels!). Please be patient, we&#39;re<br/>
really busy being immersed in Unschoolers :D<br/>
I&#39;m available via cellphone/text 605.201.9863 & I&#39;ll be Twittering all day,<br/>
every day  (if you don&#39;t wanna sign up, you can read my updates on<br/>
hahamommy.blogspot.com - there&#39;s a feed in the side bar!)<br/>
If you&#39;re at LIFE is Good, come by and say hello!<br/>
(I&#39;ll be no mail til Tuesday)<br/>
