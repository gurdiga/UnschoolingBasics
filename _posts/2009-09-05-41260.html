<div id="ygrps-yiv-194374854">Hi we may be moving to theBoston area (suburbs to the west). I have been looking online for info and can&#39;t really find the answers I need. Does anyone live there that can help me out?<br/>
<br/>
I understand you need permission from the superintendent? How do you do that and how does an unschoolers produce enough to be approved?<br/>
<br/>
We would be moving in a month or so. How would I get approval when  the school year already started?<br/>
<br/>
We would b living near the Sudbury school. Does anyone have any info about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance! Kelli</div>

as my letter of intent. The good thing about MA is that you don&#39;t  <br/>
have to show you&#39;re keeping up with the schools. You just need to  <br/>
demonstrate progress from one year to the next. So you definitely  <br/>
want to suppress any urge to impress the superintendent with how  <br/>
brilliant you kids are! Or by senior year you may need to say they&#39;re  <br/>
building their own mini nuclear reactors in the basement to top the  <br/>
previous year ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The particulars are best asked on MHLA&#39;s list or, if you have town  <br/>
specific questions, on the Metrowest list.<br/>
