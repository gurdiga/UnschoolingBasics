<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201002064">I was just reading an article in the most recent &quot;Life Learning&quot; about<br/>
trusting children.  I trust my children in most issues (i.e. sleeping,<br/>
eating, learning, etc.), but, as you can tell from my posts, I have a<br/>
lot of trouble trusting them with conflict resolution.  Part of this<br/>
is because neither my husband or I have ever done very well in this<br/>
area.  We&#39;ve been trying to work on it, but have a long way to go<br/>
(although I am going to take a workshop this month by Marshall<br/>
Rosenberg on non-violent communication that should help).<br/>
<br/>
How do I let go of this issue?  My 7 yo. dd and 3 yo. dd are very<br/>
high-spirited and can get very physical during arguments.  I just feel<br/>
that since I&#39;m not yet modeling the tools they need for resolution,<br/>
that I need to remind them to ask for what they need, etc. To guide<br/>
them during their arguments to a more peaceable way of working together.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99144715">I think it&#39;s a huge mistake to let children *work thing out on their own.<br/>
(e.g. fight)  They often don&#39;t have the words to communicate their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
  When my children were smaller and were having more difficulties than<br/>
normal I would make sure I was right there with them to help them with their<br/>
words *before a conflict happened.  It has made our lives VERY peaceful in<br/>
the long run and my children (now almost 10 and 11.75) are great at<br/>
communicating now and rarely need help.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do not know any other family where the children get along so well and<br/>
treat each other half as respectfully as my children treat each other.  In<br/>
fact, the more friends they have and see interact with their own families,<br/>
the more they appreciate our family and each other.  I am not sorry one bit<br/>
for all the time I took to help the girls problem solve over and over again<br/>
when they were small.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read Marshall Rosenberg and while I think he has some wonderful ideas<br/>
that I&#39;ve incorporated into our lives, I never could get past the feeling<br/>
that the way he advocates speaking seems so fake.  It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t<br/>
get something out of it; I got a lot out of it.  But remember that you don&#39;t<br/>
have to incorporate that stilted language and every aspect of what he<br/>
teaches to help your family communicate with each other better.  Good luck!<br/>

understanding they have.<br/>
<br/>
But *don&#39;t* trust that they&#39;ll figure out peaceful coexistence on  <br/>
their own. Especially since the 7 yo is bigger and can &quot;fix&quot; things  <br/>
by learning how to bully.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than seeing your job as teaching them how to interact and  <br/>
solve problems, see your role as keeping them safe and *helping* them  <br/>
figure out new strategies. Call one away to do something when tempers  <br/>
are flaring. *Trust* that they really don&#39;t *want* to hurt each  <br/>
other. They just don&#39;t have the tools or maybe even the ability to  <br/>
stop and take another route. Do talk about other choices later.<br/>

Have you read Siblings Without Rivalry? IT&#39;s a very easy read.<br/>

Sandra Dodd has some good stuff about conflicts on her website:<br/>

<br/>
Marla - The response to your question was great, and very informative.  She <br/>
really had a lot of great things to say, backed up with experience since her <br/>
children are older now.<br/>
<br/>
When I am with 2 children, I validate and mirror each childs feelings.  Thus, <br/>
I do not take sides.  I just repeat in my words what each child has just <br/>
said.  I continue to do this, until they resolve it on their own.  I am there to <br/>
make sure no one gets hurt, but stand back coaching to help them resolve on <br/>
their own.  I think that Thomas Gordon in PET talks about this.  It is also very <br/>
helpful when dealing with a friend or spouse.  <br/>
<br/>
I can appreciate the other posts opinon on NVC.  My experience with NVC has <br/>
been nothing short of awesome!!!   I don&#39;t want you to get discouraged or <br/>
scared about your workshop that you are going.  I think that if a person is <br/>
authentic when they speak in NVC, then what they say will sound authentic.  If you <br/>
are just reciting it, then it certainly could sound fake.  If you are feeling <br/>
it, then it will sound authentic.  We read this book for a book club that I was <br/>
in.  I printed up a sheet with feelings, on it.  When (or afterwards to <br/>
reconnect) my dh and I get into a dispute, we pull the sheet out and identify what <br/>
we are feeling.  I think this is very helpful for men, since they often were <br/>
not allowed to identify or have feelings.  This method has helped more marriages <br/>
with the people that I know, than any other method.  It is so simple.  If you <br/>
go to the seminar, and your dh doesn&#39;t,  you can just give him the sheet of <br/>
NVC.  My dh never read or attended a seminar.  He just used the one page sheet <br/>
that I made up.  I will see if I can post it to the homepage.  In times where <br/>
I am feeling heated, it gives me a &quot;script&quot; to fall back on; since I am not <br/>
much in &quot;thinking&#39; mode at that time.  It helps me to focus on my feelings, <br/>
rather than the other person being annoying, rude, irritating, mean, etc.  I feel <br/>
that identifying and expressing feelings is modelled to children, they have a <br/>
great basis for futher communication.  My ds is only 3, but he has already <br/>
started expressing how he feels.   <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and enjoy the seminar.  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Cynthia <br/>

 </span></blockquote>First off, do you really think that a 7yo and a 3yo have the tools for<br/>
effective conflict resolution?  I don&#39;t.  I would think that one of<br/>
two things happens in your house (maybe both and maybe at the same<br/>
time).  1.  Your children argue to a point where it esculates into a<br/>
loud roar with everyone angry (including you because they have caused<br/>
you to hear them fighting yet again.)  2.  They come to you to &quot;make&quot;<br/>
the other one do __________.  (Blank being &quot;be nice&quot;  &quot;share&quot;  &quot;change<br/>
the tv&quot;  &quot;stop breathing her air&quot; etc.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t take this harshly, but where are you when this is going<br/>
on?  Are you in another room involved in your own thing or are you<br/>
sitting on the sidelines waiting for them to figure it out?  Be *with*<br/>
them.  They really need you at this age especially if they have not<br/>
had good models before.  Try to avoid the conflicts by circumventing<br/>
them or heading them off before they start.  Be proactive in seeing<br/>
when a conflict might happen and put the brakes on it by going into<br/>
action to help them not have to argue or fight.  Look at what their<br/>
most common complaints are and see what you can do to fix that.  We<br/>
had a problem with three kids wanting to watch 3 different things on<br/>
tv (or use tv in 3 different ways such as PS2, PIU, DVD) at the same<br/>
time.  Our solution?  Three tv&#39;s and a DVR!  that didn&#39;t completely<br/>
solve the problem, but it still helped ease many many arguments over<br/>
who gets to watch what when.<br/>
<br/>
How do your children see you dealing with conflict resolutions?  A<br/>
phrase that I heard often when I was growing up was, &quot;It will be<br/>
interesting to see how you work this out.&quot;  My mom said it to us when<br/>
we were fighting over tv (and, gosh, we only had 4 stations on a black<br/>
and white tv with rabbit ears! LOL!) or when we were having issues<br/>
with friends (or teachers) at school.  We were never given effective<br/>
tools yet we were expected to find our own solutions.  I will admit<br/>
that I do use that phrase often, but with adults.  Like my friend who<br/>
decided to park in a handicap parking spot because it was raining and<br/>
she was only running in for one thing and ended up with a $500 parking<br/>
ticket and whined that it &quot;wasn&#39;t fair&quot; that all the good spots are<br/>
taken up by handicap spaces.  I just looked at her and said, &quot;It will<br/>
be interesting how you work this out.&quot;  However, my child coming to me<br/>
because his sister came in and cleared off aproject he was working on<br/>
from the table without asking him first needs me to be involved.<br/>
They&#39;ve asked for my help and I am going to offer it.  Your children<br/>
are asking for your help as well, even if they aren&#39;t coming directly<br/>
to you and saying, &quot;Mom, help us work this out.&quot;  If you heard your<br/>
child crying because they had fallen would you go to them?  Yes.  If<br/>
your child fell because there was a spilled glass of water on the<br/>
kitchen floor wouldn&#39;t you clean it up so that the next time your<br/>
child wouldn&#39;t spill?  And (better yet) if you saw a puddle of water<br/>
on the kitchen floor and you knew that your child could (not<br/>
necessarily would) slip on it wouldn&#39;t you clean it up to keep that<br/>
from happening?  Helping our children with conflict resolution is much<br/>
like cleaning up a spill on the floor, answering to a cry of pain (or<br/>
frustration) from a fall and observing why those falls happen in the<br/>
first place and what we can do to prevent them in the future.<br/>

shows out here yesterday!&quot;. I suspect more TVs would help, but you <br/>
will not eliminate issues over using them.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have been following this thread with interest because my younger <br/>
son (10) feels like I don&#39;t really ever punish older brother (12) <br/>
when he teases or bullies him.  He accuses me of &quot;not really doing <br/>
anything about it.&quot;  I studied the &quot;PET&quot; book in college and it is <br/>
helpful in many circumstances and I use it alot by stating what is <br/>
going on and feelings behind situation.  However, there are really <br/>
no punishments in that book for when one of the kids has done <br/>
something wrong to another sibling.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess my question is do radical unschoolers actually ever punish <br/>
their children or do they stop at reflecting feelings when a <br/>
conflict does escalate or a child does something very unfair and <br/>
unkind to a sibling?  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I did like how you say &quot;It will be interesting to see how you <br/>
work this out?&quot;  I am going to try to start saying that when the <br/>
opportunity presents itself.<br/>

embroidery.  :)  And my oldest child did not recognize that my son&#39;s<br/>
project was a project.  He was building something with Legos and had<br/>
left them there.  She didn&#39;t realize that it was something that he was<br/>
still working on and cleared them off to have space for something she<br/>
wanted to do.  She actually thought she was doing a good thing :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a matter of choice.  What do you choose to do?   My children<br/>
enjoy spending some time alone and do.   We also spend *a lot* of time<br/>
together, though.  I watch hours of them playing video games or<br/>
watching their shows with them (I usually knit or embroidery or sew<br/>
while I do these things because honestly there are only so many times<br/>
that I can watch the same episodes of Full Metal Alchemist)  Sometimes<br/>
I just sit in the room where they are and listen to them interact<br/>
while doing my own thing.  Sometimes I am an active participant in<br/>
their play or projects.  Sometimes they ask me to go away.  :)<br/>

significantly help in such a way that if I needed a fourth tv to<br/>
further help I would buy one.  I was just using the tv scenario as an<br/>
example of finding ways to lessen avoidable conflicts.  We have a much<br/>
larger house than I had ever wanted, but I had 5 people who all wanted<br/>
their own space.  This was the way that we chose to honor that.  We<br/>
chose to have a larger house and a larger house payment in order to<br/>
meet some needs that the members of the family have.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What purpose does punishment serve in being respectful to another<br/>
person?  We think in punitive terms because of our society.  &quot;You do<br/>
something bad, you serve time.&quot;  That goes for murder as well as<br/>
squabbling with a sibling.  Does punishment work?  I would look at how<br/>
many repeat offenders we have in our prisons as an answer.  Even the<br/>
states that have &quot;three strikes then life&quot; have not had much of an<br/>
impact on repeat offenders.  They only stop after three times because<br/>
they don&#39;t have the ability to offend any longer.  Parental<br/>
punishments are much the same just on a more local and smaller scale -<br/>
but generally with the same results.  If you have used punishment in<br/>
the past as a means for controlling a situation, has it worked?  In<br/>
the long run?  Or are you still punishing for the same &quot;offenses?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471488733">Hi Michelle, <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all of your wonderful insights.  As I mentioned, I do<br/>
believe in giving our children conflict resolution tools.  It&#39;s just<br/>
that I had just read an article in &quot;Life Learning&quot; that said the<br/>
complete opposite.  So, as I usually do, I put it out to the group to<br/>
see if anyone else had a similar experience and if I was missing<br/>
something contrary to what I was currently doing.<br/>
<br/>
The responses have been very helpful in reaffirming that I am doing<br/>
the right thing by being there and helping them with their conflicts.<br/>
 Unfortunately, I was never taught the appropriate way to resolve<br/>
conflict, so I am continuing to learn along with them and sometimes<br/>
feel like I am lacking good tools.  So, I continue to lurk, post, and<br/>
read in hopes to fill my own tool box with good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your time.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m doing my best to wipe up<br/>
the spills, before my kids fall - lol.<br/>

&gt; solve the problem, but it still helped ease many many arguments over<br/>
&gt; who gets to watch what when.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How do your children see you dealing with conflict resolutions?  A<br/>
&gt; phrase that I heard often when I was growing up was, &quot;It will be<br/>
&gt; interesting to see how you work this out.&quot;  My mom said it to us when<br/>
&gt; we were fighting over tv (and, gosh, we only had 4 stations on a black<br/>
&gt; and white tv with rabbit ears! LOL!) or when we were having issues<br/>
&gt; with friends (or teachers) at school.  We were never given effective<br/>
&gt; tools yet we were expected to find our own solutions.  I will admit<br/>
&gt; that I do use that phrase often, but with adults.  Like my friend who<br/>
&gt; decided to park in a handicap parking spot because it was raining and<br/>
&gt; she was only running in for one thing and ended up with a $500 parking<br/>
&gt; ticket and whined that it &quot;wasn&#39;t fair&quot; that all the good spots are<br/>
&gt; taken up by handicap spaces.  I just looked at her and said, &quot;It will<br/>
&gt; be interesting how you work this out.&quot;  However, my child coming to me<br/>
&gt; because his sister came in and cleared off aproject he was working on<br/>
&gt; from the table without asking him first needs me to be involved.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve asked for my help and I am going to offer it.  Your children<br/>
&gt; are asking for your help as well, even if they aren&#39;t coming directly<br/>
&gt; to you and saying, &quot;Mom, help us work this out.&quot;  If you heard your<br/>
&gt; child crying because they had fallen would you go to them?  Yes.  If<br/>
&gt; your child fell because there was a spilled glass of water on the<br/>
&gt; kitchen floor wouldn&#39;t you clean it up so that the next time your<br/>
&gt; child wouldn&#39;t spill?  And (better yet) if you saw a puddle of water<br/>
&gt; on the kitchen floor and you knew that your child could (not<br/>
&gt; necessarily would) slip on it wouldn&#39;t you clean it up to keep that<br/>
&gt; from happening?  Helping our children with conflict resolution is much<br/>
&gt; like cleaning up a spill on the floor, answering to a cry of pain (or<br/>
&gt; frustration) from a fall and observing why those falls happen in the<br/>
&gt; first place and what we can do to prevent them in the future.<br/>
