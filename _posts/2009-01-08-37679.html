<div id="ygrps-yiv-942016678">Hi,<br/>
We got a cell phone for our 9 y/o dtr for Christmas. She left it in<br/>
her pants pocket and it went through the washer. Initially, hubby<br/>
wanted her to pay for replacing it. Then, he decided to tell her we<br/>
would split the cost of it with her. Yesterday, she was crying about<br/>
it and saying she&#39;s not responsible enough to have a cell phone. She<br/>
went on to say she should get rid of her pet rats too because she<br/>
sometimes doesn&#39;t want to clean their cage and isn&#39;t responsible<br/>
enough to have them either. It was a good opportunity for me to tell<br/>
her about age appropriate mistakes I&#39;ve made and about self-forgiveness.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m all confused about how to handle replacing it. My thinking<br/>
is clouded by messages I would have been given. <br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

_____<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d replace it as soon as I could financially do it.? I&#39;d also recommend getting insurance on the next one.<br/>
We&#39;ve lost, misplaced and damaged cell phones, sunglasses, purses, walkie talkies, driver&#39;s licenses etc.? It&#39;s all been unintentional and normal no matter what age.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine she feels responsible and will certainly be more careful with the next one.? Borrowing from Kelly, think of it as a &quot;learning take&quot;.? I have washed my $60 clip on sunglasses and had to replace them so often that I&#39;m on my 10th &quot;learning take&quot;.? :-)<br/>
<br/>
If she has a little money and wants to help contribute maybe that would allow you to replace it more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make a big deal of it.? It&#39;s just life and learning happening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220750532">LOL. I&#39;m so clumsy I break things so I only get upset when it&#39;s because my son is having a tantrum. Let me explain, he&#39;s 13! I check pockets because I smoke and am terrified I&#39;ll burn down the house drying a lighter. BUT I break dishes frequently and figure it&#39;s part of life. My ex-husband was bad about cell phones (ran 1 over, left one on top of car) and I never got upset. It&#39;s part of life! Tell her she&#39;s human like all of us and we all forget things and make mistakes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023342685">Ha!  My 9 month old (now 2 yrs older) flushed mine down the toilet.  I lose<br/>
mine, drop it, etc.  So, my dh bought a cheap one off of Ebay.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
dropped it or lost it, lol.  Go figure.  It&#39;s big, bulky and ugly, but it is<br/>
durable and seems to like me, so it stays.  I eventually found my pretty<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280406193">I also have washed both my cell phones and my husband&#39;s cell phones in the washer.  Mine wasn&#39;t such a big deal because I don&#39;t use it as much as my husband does (his is for work), but both are a big deal when you don&#39;t have the money to replace them.  After the 2nd (or was it 3rd) time, we discovered that we could buy the cheap pre-paid phones that our cell phone company offers and simply put our SIM cards from the old (washed) phones in them and they work fine.  They aren&#39;t as fancy, but they do both make calls and text and they only cost between $15 and $50 which is much cheaper than replacing them with non-prepaid ones.  Just to make sure this is clear, even though we bought the pre-paid model, we do not have to prepay our plans.  Our old plans work with the new, cheap phones.  I don&#39;t know if this will help in your situation, but it might work in honoring your husband&#39;s request that she pay for it (whether you agree with this or not) and<br/>
 working with the finances of your daughter.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; We got a cell phone for our 9 y/o dtr for Christmas. She left it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; her pants pocket and it went through the washer. Initially, hubby<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted her to pay for replacing it. Then, he decided to tell her we<br/>
&gt; &gt; would split the cost of it with her. Yesterday, she was crying about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and saying she&#39;s not responsible enough to have a cell phone. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; went on to say she should get rid of her pet rats too because she<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes doesn&#39;t want to clean their cage and isn&#39;t responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to have them either. It was a good opportunity for me to tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; her about age appropriate mistakes I&#39;ve made and about self- <br/>
&gt; &gt; forgiveness.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m all confused about how to handle replacing it. My thinking<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143682280">On the cell, are you sure it&#39;s toast?  Google for &quot;repair wet electronics&quot;<br/>
or &quot;repair wet cellphone&quot; or &quot;drying out wet phone&quot;.  Water doesn&#39;t always<br/>
ruin electronics.  Circuit boards are rinsed in water as part of the<br/>
manufacturing process.  What breaks them is the short-curcuits caused by the<br/>
battery being installed, so a current is coursing through the board when it<br/>
gets wet.<br/>
<br/>
My wife&#39;s purse fell in a canal a few years ago and in it she had a Canon<br/>
Elph digital camera, her Palm Treo cell, and an mp3 player.  The purse was<br/>
drenched.  Water was dripping from the electronics.  I pulled the batteries<br/>
(except the mp3 player, which didn&#39;t have a removable battery) and when we<br/>
got back to the hotel I put all 3 devices in front of a warm hair dryer (not<br/>
too hot) for about 6 hours, then left them to passively dry for another 2<br/>
days.  Reinstalled the batteries, and they all worked fine except for the<br/>
mp3 player.  This is one reason I avoid buying items (like ipods) that have<br/>
non-removable batteries.  If it gets wet, yank the battery as soon as<br/>
possible!<br/>
<br/>
Last year I bought my 3 y/o son a Cowon A2 Personal Media Player (PMP)<br/>
that&#39;s similar to a video ipod but with a 4&quot; screen.  I was tired of dealing<br/>
with DVD disks for travels and daily car trips.  2 weeks after getting it,<br/>
he dropped it in the toilet (clean, thankfully).  I tried to revive it for a<br/>
week, then submitted it for warranty repair.  Usually warranties don&#39;t cover<br/>
water damage, and manufacturers actually put water-sensitive stickers on the<br/>
inside of the device that change colors if an item has been submerged.  But<br/>
in that instance they replaced it, thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
4 years ago I got in my car, at night, and put my iRiver mp3 player<br/>
(hard-drive based) in the cup-holder in the console after I plugged in the<br/>
cassette adaptor I was using to hear it via my car stereo.  Less than a mile<br/>
down the road, the music stopped.  When I picked up the player, my hand got<br/>
wet.  A friend had used my car that day and spilled water in the console,<br/>
and hadn&#39;t cleaned it up.  So my mp3 player was sitting in 2 inches of<br/>
water.  Dried it out with a hairdryer for a few hours, and it&#39;s still<br/>
working fine today.<br/>
<br/>
10 years ago, I had a cordless Uniden house phone that spent a night at the<br/>
bottom of a hot tub.  I bought a new one immediately, then a month later a<br/>
friend told me the old one might still work.  He was right.  I put it on the<br/>
charger, it charged, and worked fine for another few years.<br/>
<br/>
So not all electronics can be revived after a water dunking, and I don&#39;t<br/>
know how the washing machine soap would have added to the damage, but try to<br/>
dry it out.  I&#39;m not an electrical/electrician guy at all (but I&#39;m thrilled<br/>
they exist...without them we&#39;d all be ohmless), but give it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
With your daughter, I can only say that cell phones are cheap.<br/>
Relationships are precious and priceless.  Expecting a child to pay to<br/>
replace something in a case like this is simply a form of punishment...teach<br/>
them a lesson, make it hurt financially, &quot;so they&#39;ll remember it next time&quot;.<br/>
While you&#39;re at it, you might as well spank her and sentence her to a<br/>
week-long timeout/grounding/solitary confinement in her room.  Financial<br/>
penalties, spanking, timeouts...they&#39;re all equally-damaging punishments in<br/>
my mind.  I was raised in a punitive household (very Christian,<br/>
spare-the-rod=spoil-the-child kinda place), so I know for a fact that<br/>
punishment can only breed resentment and creates distance and distrust in<br/>
the relationship.  I still don&#39;t like my parents much today.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t learn to be responsible with their possessions via punishment or<br/>
lecturing.  They only learn it by watching US, the parents, be responsible.<br/>
So if you want to be closer to your daughter, buy her another phone as soon<br/>
as you can afford it, with a smile.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139215896">I&#39;m a 33 year old mother of 6 children and, by your dd&#39;s standards, I&#39;m <br/>
not responsible enough to have a cell phone!!!  I washed my phone (in <br/>
my jeans pocket) in July :)<br/>
<br/>
It dried out and works just fine (within 3 days), BUT we have a front <br/>
loading washing machine which doesn&#39;t use as much water as the top <br/>
loading ones (basically the difference in it getting wet in a <br/>
thunderstorm versus being dropped in a swimming pool).  So, it&#39;s <br/>
possible that the phone will work again if it has a few days to dry <br/>
out.  If not, you can get really cheap cell phones from walmart or <br/>
target and put your sim card in it.<br/>
<br/>
There has to be some way to get another phone without it costing a lot <br/>
of money!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914930967">sorry, i know you didn&#39;t get on to her, and I wasn&#39;t more specific.  <br/>
But the way dh is handling it, what is she feeling?  I meant, after  <br/>
implication to go on to say that I would handle it the same way my  <br/>
husband handled it when he found mine. &quot;Woops, your phone was in the  <br/>
washer, I set out the battery to dry.&quot; That was it. Twice it has  <br/>
worked, and once it did not, so we went and bought a new phone. You  <br/>
can either go to the phone store, or just go to walmart and get one  <br/>
of those disposable ones. You just have to put your sim card in to  <br/>
activate it to the same account. For that matter, we replaced on of  <br/>
Josh&#39;s with a phone we got from freecycle, again, just replace the  <br/>
sim card.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the way your dh is handling it is making her  <br/>
really question her ability to do anything, and rather than problem  <br/>
solving the phone together, he&#39;s saying &#39;Here&#39;s my solution, it&#39;s  <br/>
either A or B&#39;. Self-forgiveness doesn&#39;t go far if you feel someone  <br/>
is judging you based on your actions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got a cell phone for our 9 y/o dtr for Christmas. She left  <br/>
&gt; &gt; it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her pants pocket and it went through the washer. Initially, hubby<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted her to pay for replacing it. Then, he decided to tell  <br/>
&gt; &gt; her we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would split the cost of it with her. Yesterday, she was crying  <br/>
&gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it and saying she&#39;s not responsible enough to have a cell  <br/>
&gt; &gt; phone. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went on to say she should get rid of her pet rats too because she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes doesn&#39;t want to clean their cage and isn&#39;t responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough to have them either. It was a good opportunity for me to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her about age appropriate mistakes I&#39;ve made and about self-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m all confused about how to handle replacing it. My  <br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is clouded by messages I would have been given.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93267930">Going through a washer is harsher than most cell accidents, because of the <br/>
shocks in addition to the water. Still, you never know. You could also try <br/>
packing it into a bunch of those silica gel packets (silica gel crystals would <br/>
probably work even better but you&#39;d probably never get them all out of the <br/>
crevices!). A friend recently saved his brand new iPhone with the silica gel packets.<br/>
<br/>
I can also recommend just letting it dry a long time. Sarah&#39;s cell went into <br/>
a foot and a half of muddy water in September, knocked out of her pocket when <br/>
she went out the window to help Patrick push the van up out of the puddle we&#39;d <br/>
just stalled in. :(   We dried it out with a hair dryer, but it still flaked <br/>
out. We bought her a new one the next day. Two months later, on a whim, I <br/>
turned her old cell on to see what would happen. It works, and still had all her <br/>
photos and everything else in memory, the things the ATT tech had unsuccesfully <br/>
tried to retrieve for her in September.<br/>

from the old (washed) phones in them and they work fine.  They aren&#39;t<br/>

between $15 and $50 which is much cheaper than replacing them with<br/>
non-prepaid ones.  Just to make sure this is clear, even though we<br/>
bought the pre-paid model, we do not have to prepay our plans.  Our<br/>
old plans work with the new, cheap phones.  I don&#39;t know if this will<br/>

Yes. She asked for it for Christmas. Hubby was very reluctant to get<br/>
it and I am sure she heard some of his concerns. He claims he never<br/>
said a 9 y/o is not responsible enough to have a cell phone. However,<br/>
he did say things like, &quot;She doesn&#39;t need a cell phone!&quot;<br/>

ours at the time anyhow). He pondered and said No, he didn&#39;t need one.<br/>
When DS was 9, we asked if he wanted a cell phone. He thought a minute<br/>
and said No, I can just use yours if I need one. When DS turned 10 in<br/>
June 2008, we asked if he wanted a cell phone and he mused and said No<br/>
thanks. In December 2008, DH and I were upgrading our phones (DH&#39;s phone<br/>
was starting to show the ill effects of wear and tear) so we asked DS on<br/>
the way to the phone store if he wanted a cell phone. This time, he<br/>
paused and said &quot;Yes, this seems like a good time&quot; So, now he has a cell<br/>
phone. We use the address book so that he knows who is calling - if it&#39;s<br/>
not a &#39;name&#39; he doesn&#39;t bother answering it. Then we check the &quot;missed&quot;<br/>
calls to see if &quot;oops, we forgot to add Grandma&#39;s new cell number to the<br/>
address book&quot;. And, we put any &#39;spam&#39; type calls into the reject pile so<br/>
they automatically get cut off in the future. Mostly, he uses it to text<br/>
me when I&#39;m at work which is fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080304266">I don&#39;t know about this. It seems like the child is saying she doesn&#39;t want<br/>
the phone because she doesn&#39;t feel worthy. That is a big issue. She deserves<br/>
to be guide through. Having a phone doesn&#39;t meant hat she has to behave in<br/>
the way her father sees as responsible. She was responsible, she felt sad<br/>
when her phone was lost. She will likely learn through that mistake. I WANT<br/>
my childrent o make lots of mistakes WITH me around. I want them to retain<br/>
their self-respect and confidence through their mistakes. I want them to see<br/>
that punishment doesn&#39;t help you learn, reflection and figuring out a<br/>
different way does.<br/>
<br/>
I would feel insulted if me dh let me go on feeling bad ABOUT mySELF while<br/>
he waited for me to get over it and feel worthy of a phone again. Then it<br/>
would be further insulting to me for him to expect me to pay for my mistake.<br/>
I would hope that because he loves me and respects me and thinks I am a good<br/>
person that he would buy me another phone with a smile in his heart.<br/>

&gt;   Well, if she is now saying she does not want, I would not replace it for<br/>
&gt; her. She may not feel ready for it after all, and is telling you so. Just<br/>
&gt; avoid explicit as well as implicit &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When she does say she wants another, ask her how to go about paying for it.<br/>
&gt; She may offer to pay full price, she may ask to split or you pay it all. But<br/>
&gt; if she is now saying she does not want it, I would go with that.<br/>

It is showing lots of improvement, but still a few kinks.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t really have any advise on how to handle the responsibility,<br/>
but I do have have some advise on helping her get a new phone. Sell<br/>
the phone for parts on eBay. There are a lot of broken phones selling<br/>
for sometimes a little more than half the price of the new phone, even<br/>
if it is water damaged. If you have the box and manual that will also<br/>
help the price.<br/>

&gt; Godd luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; We got a cell phone for our 9 y/o dtr for Christmas. She left it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; her pants pocket and it went through the washer. Initially, hubby<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted her to pay for replacing it. Then, he decided to tell her we<br/>
&gt; &gt; would split the cost of it with her. Yesterday, she was crying about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and saying she&#39;s not responsible enough to have a cell phone. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; went on to say she should get rid of her pet rats too because she<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes doesn&#39;t want to clean their cage and isn&#39;t responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to have them either. It was a good opportunity for me to tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; her about age appropriate mistakes I&#39;ve made and about<br/>
self-forgiveness.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m all confused about how to handle replacing it. My thinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; is clouded by messages I would have been given.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
