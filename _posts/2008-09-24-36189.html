Siblings Without Rivalry.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/4tw9dz">http://tinyurl.com/4tw9dz</a><br/>
<br/>
(Their How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk  <br/>

<br/>
Short explanations, cartoons, dialog, different ways to approach the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984700274">Hi Marla,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going through the same thing in my house.  My DS age 8 & my DD <br/>
age 4 are constantly &quot;at&quot; eachother.  My son almost tries to parent <br/>
my daughter! He corrects her, he shooshes her, and in turn, she tries <br/>
to be a mommy to him, gets upset when he won&#39;t play with her.<br/>
I have 2 older brothers who are a lot older than me. So I was pretty <br/>
much raised as an only child. The concept of sibling rivalry has <br/>
always been foreign to me.  I always thought that if I had a <br/>
brother/sister to grow up with, we&#39;d be best friends!I know that&#39;s <br/>
totally not realistic, but I guess it hurts me to see my 2 being <br/>
unkind and hurtful. I find myself stepping in a lot as well.  I&#39;m <br/>
trying not to do that as much!<br/>
I&#39;m going to get that book that was recommended. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666063302">Hey Joyce, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for the response.  My copy of &quot;Sibling&#39;s without<br/>
Rivalry&quot; is one of my most worn-out books - LOL.  The pages are<br/>
well-worn and I&#39;ve written all over it (I also was fortunate to take a<br/>
several week class with one of the author&#39;s daughters on &quot;how to talk&quot;<br/>
even before I&#39;d ever heard of unschooling or had a second child).  I<br/>
guess I just am still struggling with getting past my emotion enough<br/>
to use the techniques.  My kids relationship, unfortunately, is one of<br/>
my biggest struggles.  Fortunately, I have met a cool new therapist<br/>
who is into unschooling, so I&#39;m hoping I can finally get to the root<br/>
of it all.  In the past, my therapists have spent time harping on how<br/>
I&#39;m parenting, rather than helping me move forward.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep working on it.  Thanks again for your input!<br/>

a big difference. Think of other ways your family as a whole is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928717197">Marla,<br/>
I&#39;m just curious, how did you go about finding a good therapist who understands your lifestyle?  I really feel my 6 y/o (almost 7) needs to talk with someone other than me.  It would also help me figure out what is happening with her.  I know we are going through many things/ issues in our home and its got to affect her as well, only I don&#39;t think she&#39;s coping well.  She was always this happy carefree girl and now has these crying or whinny/clinging periods that seem to be happening more often and for longer periods.  When I ask her about it she says she can&#39;t help it that there is a monster inside.  She also gets angry and or frustrated and doesn&#39;t seem to know how to tame it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m confused as to how to help her.  I&#39;ve been thinking of going to a therapist but I just know it will be terrible.  I imagine it will end up being a session of questioning my homeschooling life and I don&#39;t feel I need to justify answers to something I think is going well overall.<br/>
 <br/>
How do I go about finding a therapist who is acceptable of homeschooling and preferable unschooling?  <br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Rebecca<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470693582">Hey Rebecca,  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are going through a really tough time.  I wish I<br/>
had an easy answer, but I don&#39;t.  It was just luck that another<br/>
unschooling mom met a therapist who lent her &quot;The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook.&quot;  When I spoke to this therapist she really supported<br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, most of the therapists my husband and I, or myself,<br/>
have gone to have blamed our parenting (i.e. not sending our children<br/>
to school) as the cause of all of our problems.  Most recently I had a<br/>
therapist who constantly compared her own mothering with mine saying<br/>
that her kid was just fine and went to school and asked me questions<br/>
like,&quot;do you ever say &quot;no&quot; to your kids?&quot;  At first I thought I was<br/>
just educating her about a different lifestyle, but it eventually made<br/>
me feel like she was using me to measure her own mothering style.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wish I could help more, but before you begin with a<br/>
therapist you can ask them their feelings about unschooling.  Also, as<br/>
Pam pointed out, you can ask other unschoolers local to your area.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this wholeheartedly!  The problem is that they both want<br/>
me to spend more time with them as an individual and not the other<br/>
sibling.  When I spend time with one, the other complains.  When I<br/>
spend time with both, they often can&#39;t agree on what to do (they are<br/>
4.5 yo. - 5 yo. and 9 yo., so they are in different places<br/>
developmentally, etc.). So, I still am working on this issue. <br/>
Hopefully, as the younger one gets older, it will get easier - LOL.<br/>

Sometimes it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a reflection of how my husband and I are communicating, or not<br/>

does effect the kids behavior in a negative way.  But we&#39;re working on<br/>
minimizing these rough times through counseling.<br/>

it.  However, I didn&#39;t radically unschool Amy until she was 5 or 6 yo.<br/>
 Up to then I set limits on food and screen time, though I still<br/>
didn&#39;t use punishment.  I do mention it to Amy at times, but I agree<br/>
that I need to discuss it with her more (about the way I parented her<br/>
vs. how I parent Lily). Thanks for reminding me about that one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894990221">The problem is that they both wantme to spend more time with them as an<br/>
individual and not the other sibling. When I spend time with one, the other<br/>
complains. When I spend time with both, they often can&#39;t agree on what to do<br/>
(they are<br/>
4.5 yo. - 5 yo. and 9 yo., so they are in different places developmentally,<br/>
etc.). So, I still am working on this issue.<br/>
Hopefully, as the younger one gets older, it will get easier - LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking you will probably want to do something until the youngest one<br/>
grows a bit :-)<br/>
I have 3 that are very far spaced and very different developmentally, dd1,<br/>
ds5 (almost 6) and dd11 1/2<br/>
What I try to do is give them a few minutes of undivided attention each day.<br/>
When we haven&#39;t done it in a while and things get a little yicky between the<br/>
kidlets it takes a few days to get back into a groove. So it may be that you<br/>
need to be persistent about it until you get into a groove. I just let the<br/>
kids know that I have X amount of time to be with each individually. Then we<br/>
work out who gets my time 1st or 2nd. The baby is a baby so they get that,<br/>
mostly :-) I use this if I need time for me as well.  They know that I will<br/>
be a better mama and that they will get exactly what they need if they are<br/>
pacient. How is looks in my family is ds5 usually gets his needs met first<br/>
because he has little to no pacience. Then I will hang out with dd when the<br/>
baby sleeps or late in the evening/night after her sibs are in bed. We have<br/>
our best talks then, she loves the darkness.  When we are all going out I<br/>
try to make sure that everyone is getting what they need. Like when we do<br/>
something for dd1, I will create a stop that interests ds5. I will also take<br/>
the baby&#39;s mneeds into consideration and plan accordianly/&#92;<br/>
This takes some finesse and trail and error. It is worht the persistence<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s still young and concrete in her thinking and is swayed by the  <br/>
immediacy of harsher parenting approaches. If parents punish or  <br/>
threaten to punish, it looks to HER like parents get results because,  <br/>
yeah, they DO get immediate results. They get worse behavior in the  <br/>
long run and the punishment interferes with the parent-child  <br/>
relationship so that, as teens, the kids become sneaky and engage in  <br/>
risky behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
See, all this thinking ahead is beyond your older daughter&#39;s  <br/>
comprehension, right now. But, she can start to get it that you&#39;re  <br/>
thinking about more than just how to control the younger child&#39;s  <br/>
behavior right this minute.<br/>
