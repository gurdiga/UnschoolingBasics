<div id="ygrps-yiv-12959163">Ok, my head is spinning from conflicting advice.<br/>
<br/>
When my boy was born, my parenting style was to try to speak to my kids as I would an adult. I spoke gently and politely and did not act like an authoritarian.<br/>
<br/>
When the second came along I started to realize that I was starting to drown. My son was wild, not socializing well with other children and not listening to me.<br/>
<br/>
Time marched on and my children are rather wild and unruly. Friends told me that I am harming my children and causing them socialization problems because of my lack of structure and by not &quot;acting like a parent&quot;. So, since I had no one to tell me otherwise, I tried to be more authoritarian and &quot;be the parent.&quot; I incorporated structure as much as I was able (not too well, though.)<br/>
<br/>
By the time ds entered fourth grade he went through a great change. Maybe because of biofeedback; maybe because of positive reinforcement; maybe because of maturity. In any case he started to do much better in school and is generally easier for me to work with. The other children won&#39;t forget though and he still has social issues.<br/>
<br/>
DD on the other hand, has gotten in trouble so much at school that I can&#39;t bear it anymore. She does well academically, but she spent more of first grade in the principal&#39;s office than the classroom. Second grade the teacher decided to try to clamp down on her harder to get better behavior. It seemed to work some of the time, but most of the time she would get notes home from school complaining that she was rude and disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
Given that long background I&#39;ll let you know my real question. So now that we&#39;re trying homeschooling, I feel as though I&#39;m working to bring her back to healing. We&#39;re working on conflict resolution rather than just punishing bad behavior. I&#39;m trying to undo the parenting I had become, but I&#39;m actually finding it a big challenge. I realize that the authoritarian route also has me getting angry and I don&#39;t like getting angry with my children.<br/>
<br/>
So I need suggestions... yesterday we got back from a lovely afternoon at the pool. I asked dd (7.98yo) to go back to the car to get the rest of her things. At first she ignored me, so I politely asked again. (Starting to feel the heat rise.) I asked her why she wasn&#39;t replying and she said, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;No what?&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t go to the car.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want to. I want to play with the dog.&quot; That was it... I gave an authoritarian response. I believe I threatened a consequence and she eventually went.<br/>
<br/>
Because of conflict resolution exercises that we&#39;ve been working on as part of our schooling lessons, DS has been working hard to speak politely too. Yesterday she was poking him with a cattail plant (part of a writing lesson we were about to do) He said, &quot;Miss T, please stop...PLEASE!... MOM! Why won&#39;t she listen?!&quot; She wouldn&#39;t listen to me either so I took it away.<br/>
<br/>
So that microcosm of conversations felt as though gentle-speak doesn&#39;t work and authoritarian does. My friends would say I&#39;m confusing her with gentle-speak by making her feel as though the task is optional. They would say that kids and pets feel more secure when they get clear commands and they don&#39;t want a friend. <br/>
<br/>
What could I have done differently? <br/>

Maybe it is because you &quot;asked&quot; her to do it first off instead of <br/>
telling her to do it.  That sounds different from what I mean <br/>
though.  lol!  Instead of &quot;would you please go get me a diaper?&quot; you <br/>
say &quot;get mom a diaper&quot; or &quot;get mom a diaper please&quot;.  This is based <br/>
on *The Continuum Concept* of parenting.  Here is a link to an <br/>
article that you might find interesting.  I sure did.  :)<br/>

Restoring Harmony: A Mother&#39;s Story <br/>
by Abigail Warren <br/>
<br/>
Here is a quote from the article:<br/>
&quot;Jean proceeded to describe all the common mistakes made by parents <br/>
who are genuinely trying to do everything right (holding our babies, <br/>
nursing, sleeping with them). Terrified of doing anything wrong, and <br/>
trying so hard to save our children from all the agony we suffered as <br/>
children, we go overboard in the other direction (what Jean refers to <br/>
as &quot;child-centered&quot;). We try too hard to please, and too hard not to <br/>
antagonize. We are over-attentive and self-sacrificing (how did Jean <br/>
know me so well?). We look guilty and anxious as we plead with our <br/>
children, ask permission of them, and continuously reason, explain, <br/>
and apologize. All of this puts the child in control, and since what <br/>
the child innately wants and needs is not to be in control, and to <br/>
have a mother who is in control, it makes the child insecure and <br/>
eventually angry. <br/>
&quot;The child needs a mother who is confident and calm,&quot; Jean <br/>
explained. &quot;A mother who knows what to do, and doesn&#39;t ask permission <br/>
from her child. It may look the opposite  that the child is <br/>
struggling for more control, but ironically she is struggling not to <br/>
be in control and is pushing you until you stand firm. When a child <br/>
feels that she might gain control, her impulse is to push for it. She <br/>
cannot resist this, as it is human nature and is exactly what she is <br/>
programmed to do. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t plead with her over anything,&quot; Jean went on. &quot;If you&#39;re <br/>
pleading with her, then she&#39;s got the power, and it makes her nervous <br/>
because it means you&#39;re not sure of yourself, and you&#39;re begging her <br/>
for acceptance. Any grown-up lady that pleads with a four year old is <br/>
not to be relied on. Do not ask her what she wants to do, tell her, <br/>
but be sure you don&#39;t do it in an angry way. Just be matter of fact <br/>
and nicely say what you want her to do. Treat her as your ally, <br/>
expecting that she wants to know, expecting that she will listen. And <br/>
you don&#39;t give her endless reasons; that tends again to sound like <br/>
pleading. <br/>
&quot;Even when you hug your child, see if you&#39;re in any way asking for <br/>
forgiveness  pleading with the child in some way.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HTH!  :)<br/>

If your child wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to say &quot;no&quot; then you weren&#39;t really <br/>
ASKING her.  If you request something then you need to be prepared for <br/>
a &quot;no&quot; too.  You should have just gone out to the car yourself and <br/>
gotten the rest of the items or you could have asked her if she&#39;d do it <br/>
for you later (again with the option of saying &quot;no&quot;).  Threatening her <br/>
or using punishments isn&#39;t causing her to want to do you any favors.  <br/>

This &quot;iron fist in a velvet glove&quot;/parents know best/no choices for kids is<br/>
exactly what turned me soundly off the Continuum Concept. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively you could have genuinely asked (instead of pretending to ask<br/>
but really telling) your daughter to do something that was slightly<br/>
important to you, and then cheerfully accepted that she had a perfectly good<br/>
reason for saying &quot;no&quot; at the time. Just as sometimes she will ask you for<br/>
something and you will have a real reason for saying &quot;no&quot;. What a shame she<br/>
had to interrupt her important playing with the dog for something that<br/>
probably was parental convenience rather than something urgent or crucial<br/>
(like a life or limb threatening safety issue).<br/>
<br/>
Whilever her priorities and ideas of importance are treated as less valid<br/>
than yours, she will probably continue to fight for them.<br/>

little. I think I tend to claim I&#39;m giving choices when I&#39;m not, so <br/>
it can be good to be clear about that. Last week my kids had a <br/>
stomach bug that resulted in lots and lots of poopy diapers. Mikey <br/>
got diaper rash pretty bad because I wasn&#39;t checking him every 5 <br/>
minutes at first. He got really scared of diaper changes and I tried <br/>
to give him some choices of how to do it, but it just didn&#39;t work. He <br/>
was scared, it was hurting, it was going to get worse with time and I <br/>
had no intention of waiting more than a couple minutes. The only <br/>
thing that made it better was getting it over and there was no way he <br/>
was going to choose any particular method. My giving choices just <br/>
dragged out the process, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when we have somewhere to be at a certain time (or when someone <br/>
is waiting for us), I&#39;m not giving the kids a choice, so it&#39;s not <br/>
good to say &quot;you don&#39;t want to be late, do you?&quot; or &quot;do you want to <br/>
go?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Neither of these are common, thankfully. I don&#39;t go many places the <br/>
kids don&#39;t want to go! When I do get protests, it&#39;s usually an effort <br/>
to be heard and taking a couple minutes to listen almost always <br/>

Poor little guy. Jayn had some painful &quot;acidy&quot; poops for a while when a baby<br/>
that meant she had to be changed instantly or get a sore rash. Hope he feels<br/>
better soon. Can he run about outside without any dydee for a while?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This makes sense because it is a context of a real situation and genuine<br/>
reason to be somewhere. The CC seems to make it a habitual state of affairs<br/>
that children simply be told. I remember the example of the girl at the<br/>
restaurant and her father ordered for her without consultation. I just went<br/>
&quot;ughh&quot; at the time. Also that parents should not play with their children in<br/>
the kid&#39;s games, only allow the children to imitate adults.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn&#39;s protests resolve after listening. However on several recent<br/>
occasions we have decided not to go because she was truly miserable about<br/>
the errand. There are times when we believe errands are crucial and time<br/>
sensitive when they are really just a matter of convenience. Sometimes it is<br/>
really about: dh just doesn&#39;t want to go himself (too lazy - I mean really<br/>
that is the reason - he&#39;s not working, he has loads of free time) so he gets<br/>
angry that I didn&#39;t force Jayn to go out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796189904">I am slowly weaning myself from the idea that all of this is my job. Not sure <br/>
if it has anything to do with gently parenting. But I figure if the shoes are <br/>
in the car, they&#39;re in the car. They&#39;re not my shoes. I like mine to be in <br/>
the shoe basket in the garage (or near it anyway :) ). <br/>
<br/>
Pool stuff staying in the car can be stinky though -- towels have to come in, <br/>
right? But they don&#39;t have to come in right this minute.<br/>
<br/>
Later, when everyone is cooled down a little, it is literally 99.5 degrees in <br/>
my backyard right now, I might say, &quot;somebody come and help me get this pool <br/>
junk out of the car.&quot; Somebody usually does.  <br/>
<br/>
And if it&#39;s just me getting the junk, I just get the towels I was worried <br/>
about. The rest of the stuff -- well, that&#39;s yours and you know where it is and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t bother me that it&#39;s on the backseat floor.<br/>

after themselves. So if it hadn&#39;t been the dog it would have been the t.v.<br/>
or the computer or ... whatever.  Does that mean that I should expect to do<br/>
anything myself that they don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>
<br/>
What I hadn&#39;t mentioned in my original post was that as we approached the<br/>
house I reminded both children that Mr. B had cleaned the car very nicely<br/>
and I&#39;d like to keep it that way so please bring all of your stuff in the<br/>
house with you. Miss T couldn&#39;t carry it all so I reminded her that she<br/>
could do it in more than one trip if she wants. She brought in one load,<br/>
went to the bathroom and then started playing with the dog leaving the bulk<br/>
of her belongings in the car.<br/>
<br/>
So the problem that I have with speaking to them as I would speak to adults<br/>
is that adults don&#39;t just capriciously say &quot;No&quot; and leave you with all the<br/>
work (or at least the adults I know usually don&#39;t.)<br/>

<br/>
I hate to bring in stuff from the car.  I never do it.<br/>
 Consequently, when I am anywhere and we<br/>
need....ANYTHING, I have it in the car.  I LOVE to be<br/>
able to do this.  I have swimming suits, towels,<br/>
trucks, books, food, drinks, shovels, bowls,<br/>
plates...you name it, I have it in there.  This drives<br/>
my husband crazy.  He says &quot;Can&#39;t you clean out your<br/>
car?&quot;  I say &quot;The next time we get somewhere where YOU<br/>
need sunscreen or a candy bar, you will thank me.&quot; <br/>
and he has.  But he drives a perfectly empty car, and<br/>
I drive a perfectly full one.  It&#39;s not disrespectful<br/>
of me to NOT clean out my car because he asked me to<br/>
years ago....I told him my feelings on the subject,<br/>
and he would be treating me with disrespect if he kept<br/>
harping on it....<br/>

We have a very open, close relationship and I know she&#39;d feel I was invading<br/>
her privacy and feel a lack of trust on my part if I monitored her computer<br/>

parental blocks.   As it is, she tells me lots about who she talks to and<br/>
what&#39;s up with them and what neat websites she&#39;s found.  I know that if she<br/>
came across anything or anyone she wasn&#39;t comfortable about she would come<br/>
to me (she has a couple of times).  ~Rue<br/>

up after themselves. So if it hadn&#39;t been the dog it would have been the<br/>
t.v. or the computer or ... whatever.  Does that mean that I should expect<br/>
to do anything myself that they don&#39;t feel like doing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I also would rather do just about anything fun than pick up<br/>
after myself. It sounds like a sane and sensible ordering of personal<br/>
priorities. What I do to avoid housework is get on line. ;) <br/>
<br/>
However, kidding aside, at our house the answer to that question is really<br/>
simply &quot;yes&quot;, if it is important to *you*. I guess what you might ask<br/>
yourself is whether you are trying to &quot;teach&quot; her some kind of lesson by<br/>
forcing responsibility on her. Most people here recommend modeling and<br/>
kindness instead. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;What I hadn&#39;t mentioned in my original post was that as we approached the<br/>
house I reminded both children that Mr. B had cleaned the car very nicely<br/>
and I&#39;d like to keep it that way so please bring all of your stuff in the<br/>
house with you. Miss T couldn&#39;t carry it all so I reminded her that she<br/>
could do it in more than one trip if she wants. She brought in one load,<br/>
went to the bathroom and then started playing with the dog leaving the bulk<br/>
of her belongings in the car.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would urge you to look at this way of speaking again. It sounds like you<br/>
were trying to &quot;guilt&quot; and manipulate your kids. They are not very likely to<br/>
look at Mr. B&#39;s efforts very cordially or with gratitude if the result is<br/>
that you use them as a reason that they then have to do stuff they don&#39;t<br/>
want to. I wonder why she couldn&#39;t go get &quot;her belongings&quot; when she needed<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;So the problem that I have with speaking to them as I would speak to<br/>
adults is that adults don&#39;t just capriciously say &quot;No&quot; and leave you with<br/>
all the work (or at least the adults I know usually don&#39;t.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that it is more *not* saying things that you would<br/>
not say to an adult because those things are disrespectful in that context,<br/>
so they are just as disrespectful of the child. Also if an adult said, &quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t help you with that right now, because I&#39;m doing something&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
you respect that? Would you assume they were being capricious, or maybe<br/>
genuinely tired/distracted/in need of a break and intending to do it later,<br/>
unless they forgot. <br/>

Personally, I don&#39;t think that was the case, this time, but that&#39;s a good point. She seems to get these *random* fears of the dark or of our upstairs where she can&#39;t go alone. I&#39;m listening carefully to the warnings on this list not to try to &quot;desensitize&quot; her. But this is becoming a drag for the family because we have to escort her to all sorts of places in the house. We&#39;re moving to cohousing next year so I think this will have an end, but if anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m all ears.<br/>

anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m all ears.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope this does not sound harsh or hurt anyone on this list, but I seem to<br/>
be the resident out-on-a-limb goer.<br/>
<br/>
When I start to feel resentful (it does happen) about some little need that<br/>
Jayn has, that could seem to be a &quot;drag&quot;, I remind myself how grateful I am<br/>
that she is here with me, alive and healthy, to have these nuisancy needs.<br/>
There is so much stuff that can go wrong, with a child&#39;s brain chemistry,<br/>
with a child&#39;s health, accidents - even here on this list there are kids who<br/>
have all kinds of physical issues that their parents have to deal with. Some<br/>
of these are horrendous, and even life threatening. Some people still<br/>
unschooling, have even lost a child. I bet they wish they had that &quot;drag&quot; on<br/>
their time. I salute their patience and bravery.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly - do you really have so much else to do that caring for your<br/>
daughter&#39;s fears by &quot;escorting&quot; her places, is a drag for you? Can&#39;t you<br/>
make it your special task to save the rest of your family (I&#39;m assuming her<br/>
sibling doesn&#39;t dig it much) from growing resentments? <br/>
<br/>
The fears will get better on her own schedule, or never. But if you push her<br/>
because you fear inconveniencing someone else, you could create a lifelong<br/>
paranoia, or worse - erode her trust in you. Any time a child has to move to<br/>
a new living arrangement fears are likely to exacerbate for a while, not<br/>
lessen.<br/>

Boy , she&#39;s just like both of my kids!  The youngest won&#39;t go  upstairs alone <br/>
either, or to the bathroom.  I do find it hard sometimes to  just be quiet <br/>
and go with him, because usually i&#39;m in the middle of doing  something else when <br/>
he has to!  His brother got over his fright of the  upstairs sometime this <br/>
last year, he&#39;s 11 now so he got thru it at age 10.   So, it might just take <br/>
time for your dd like it did for my oldest.  I am  hopeing though that his little <br/>
brother starts going alone alittle sooner!  lol!!!!<br/>
ps...We just stopped ps last Oct., so i&#39;m wondering if just the fact that  my <br/>
oldest ds is home all the time has helped him to get to know his own home  <br/>
better.  ??    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can relate to this myself.  My sister and I shared a room when we <br/>
were little and we always had to negotiate who was going to be the one <br/>
to turn off the light because neither one of us felt &quot;safe&quot; walking the <br/>
few steps from the switch to our bed.  Creepy feeling!  We would swipe <br/>
the switch and take a running LEAP onto the bed just in case there <br/>
really was a monster under the bed waiting to grab our ankles.<br/>
<br/>
To this day I don&#39;t like walking on stairs that don&#39;t have a riser <br/>
(open underneath) -- it creeps me out.  My sister is *really* creeped <br/>
out by those kind of stairs and bounds up them as quick as she can.  <br/>
We&#39;re both right around 30!  Sure we know that we&#39;re being paranoid ;) <br/>
but the feelings are there just the same.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I could really get myself worked up enough that I&#39;d <br/>
actually image that I saw ghosts or a skeleton in the shadows.  If I&#39;d <br/>
have had a night light, a flashlight, a hand to hold and some kinds <br/>
words maybe it wouldn&#39;t have lasted for all the years that it did.<br/>
<br/>
HER reality is that she doesn&#39;t feel safe.  Dismissing her feels as <br/>
&quot;silly&quot; or a &quot;drag&quot; isn&#39;t doing her any favors, Mama.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So the problem that I have with speaking to them as I would speak to adults<br/>
&gt; is that adults don&#39;t just capriciously say &quot;No&quot; and leave you with all the<br/>
&gt; work (or at least the adults I know usually don&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither do kids. But adults will judge the reasons kids have (or seem to<br/>
have) as not good enough and judge kids&#39; reasons as &quot;capricious&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Kids *do* see the world differently. But different isn&#39;t wrong. A child<br/>
might think it&#39;s ridiculous to put away toys when it&#39;s much easier to use<br/>
them when they&#39;re out to be seen. An adult might think it&#39;s dangerous to<br/>
leave them out because people could trip over them.<br/>
<br/>
Is the child wrong? Is the adult right? No. Both are right from their own<br/>
point of view. What&#39;s wrong is when the adult determines the child&#39;s point<br/>
of view is wrong and the adult point of view needs to prevail.<br/>
<br/>
What adults then end up modeling as a problem solving technique -- and it<br/>
must be a *good* technique since adults use it *a lot* -- is that the way to<br/>
resolve conflicts of interest is to be big and strong and make a weaker<br/>
person do it your way.<br/>
<br/>
When we see kids solving problems that way, we get concerned that they&#39;re<br/>
becoming bullies. But we don&#39;t see that they learn that technique from us!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems to me that my children would rather do anything rather than pick up<br/>
&gt; after themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.<br/>
<br/>
But what you&#39;re really saying is that kids generate a lot of mess and that<br/>
you resent them for &quot;making&quot; you clean up after them.<br/>
<br/>
But they *aren&#39;t* making you clean up. You&#39;re *choosing* to keep the house<br/>
at a standard that makes you comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if it hadn&#39;t been the dog it would have been the t.v.<br/>
&gt; or the computer or ... whatever.  Does that mean that I should expect to do<br/>
&gt; anything myself that they don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. If you go into it with the attitude that they get to play while<br/>
you get to do all the work, you&#39;re going to resent them.<br/>
<br/>
Change will come when you can see with a new attitude or new point of view.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect right now that you approach their helping as something you expect<br/>
and then you send out negative emotions when they don&#39;t. So they&#39;re stuck<br/>
between a rock and a hard place.<br/>
<br/>
What if a friend volunteered cleaning up a park. What if she assumed since<br/>
you live in the town too that you had a duty to clean too. So when she asked<br/>
you to help, she wasn&#39;t really asking because no wasn&#39;t an acceptable answer<br/>
to her. She was &quot;politely&quot; telling you to get down to the park and help. But<br/>
when you did show up to help, her attitude was basically &quot;Here&#39;s the jobs<br/>
that need done.&quot; And when you were done, her response was essentially<br/>
&quot;Thanks. You can go now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But what if another friend called and said she was in a bind. She said her<br/>
helpers hadn&#39;t shown up and she was desperately in need of help to clean up<br/>
the park before the afternoon concert. And what if she said she totally<br/>
understood that you had more important things to do but that she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
ask if she wasn&#39;t in great need. And then when you showed up you could feel<br/>
and hear she was very greatful. And afterwards what if she offered to take<br/>
you to lunch or take the kids for the day to show her appreciation?<br/>
<br/>
Which friend would you be more likely to help? Which friend would you likely<br/>
do the barest minimum for so you could escape? Which friend would you likely<br/>
pull the curtains on if you saw coming up the walk?<br/>
<br/>
When we appraoch chores with the attitude that it&#39;s kids duty to help and<br/>
give them grudging thanks for doing what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do and flak<br/>
if they don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t encourage them to help. It encourages them to<br/>
avoid us and anything that looks like work.<br/>
<br/>
If we take full responsibility for all chores in the house and *ask* for<br/>
help -- knowing they can say no -- and assume they&#39;re doing their best even<br/>
if it isn&#39;t as much as we would like and truly appreciate them taking time<br/>
from more interesting things to do us a favor, then we can be people they<br/>
want to help.<br/>
<br/>
If parents have been authoritarian it takes a while for kids to catch onto<br/>
the new attitude. They&#39;ll still hear authoritarian even when we don&#39;t mean<br/>
it. They&#39;ll still hear questions as demands even if we intend for them to be<br/>
true questions.<br/>
<br/>
It will help if you invite kids to do fun things with you that will help. Or<br/>
to just spend time with you to keep you company. You can ask them to do a<br/>
little thing to help out, like something that needs three hands. And<br/>
appreciate their help. And their company :-)<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t really an easy answer. It&#39;s emotianally draining being<br/>
authoritarian, getting everyone to do what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do. But it<br/>
is straightforward to explain to others. If you want your kids to do x, then<br/>
you do y.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle parenting is something else. It isn&#39;t about getting them to do what<br/>
you want. It&#39;s about living together peacefully. Part of living peacefully<br/>
is wanting to be together and help each other. But there isn&#39;t a way to<br/>
*make* kids do that. It comes from projecting an attitude of appreciation<br/>
for them being in your life. And if they feel that, they&#39;ll want to return<br/>
it.<br/>

Not easy. Simple, but hard. <br/>
 <br/>
But it gets easier and easier as you go along---to the point that it&#39;s just  <br/>
second nature---and joyful and good.<br/>

Once  your home is more and more relaxed and joyful and she <br/>
isn&#39;t suspicious of  your motives to change her you&#39;ll probably see her <br/>
door open more and  more.  Hang in there!  :)<br/>

M&#39;s father and i talked about the sleeping pattersn which were disturbing  to <br/>
us, and i had already decided to just let it be and see what happens with  <br/>
it,   last night i met her at 3am when i was getting up for the  bathroom- she <br/>
had just gotten up- all i said was good morning to her and she  sort of looked <br/>
at me like- where&#39;s the lecture?--  she didnt get one<br/>
 <br/>
then she came out at 5:30 to sit on the porch with me to watch her dad  leave <br/>
for work and announced she had just been talking to a friend in NY!!! so  <br/>
there is at least ONE other person awake at that hour! LOL<br/>
 <br/>
Parenting isnt new to me but parenting this way is- we have been  unschooling <br/>
for 4 years, this is my second marrige and second set of kids the  girls form <br/>
the firat marrige went to  regular school-- a &quot;normal&quot; life by  the rest of <br/>
the world&#39;s standards i guess.  These kids were take out of  school  M in the <br/>
third grade and H in the 6th she was steadfastly refusing  to do anything in <br/>
school especially with math and theu werent helping her at all  she would be <br/>
sent home and not a word from the school on how she was doing!! I  only found out <br/>
when the end of the year came!! so that was it, out she  came!!  my  son was <br/>
constantly harassed because he was a peaceful kid,  not wanting to fight but <br/>
having to just to get thru a day.  then i heard  the reports of knives and guns <br/>
and drugs and that was the end of it.    that condition still exists here in <br/>
the schools.  some of his friends he  had from school are in jail or <br/>
probation... on drugs, pregnant.... neither of my  children are into drugs, alcohol, <br/>
violence except for online games which they  know is entertainment and not real <br/>
life....  big difference even if   most folks think we are odd for not sending <br/>
them to school-- then i will remain  odd if it means  my kids arent exposed <br/>
to something that could kill or maim  them!I am seriously thinking of doing the <br/>
same with my grand daughter, she is 10  mos old right now and living with us.<br/>
