<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370418253">&quot;&gt;&gt;My middle son (age 10 next month)<br/>
is still having a very hard time reading. &gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to see him as &quot;learning to read&quot; not having &quot;a very hard time<br/>
reading&quot;. <br/>
He&#39;s in the process, the process just looks very, VERY different from<br/>
child to child. I really wish I could back up my next statement with a<br/>
link, but I don&#39;t even remember where I read it at this point. You&#39;ll<br/>
just have to trust me;)(scary, I know).<br/>
<br/>
I read once that the &quot;average&quot; ages for children to read are anywhere<br/>
between 3 and 12. That&#39;s AVERAGE. There were children that were<br/>
outside those &quot;normal&quot; parameters, either earlier or later (and<br/>
according to this research, it was NOT problematic for a child to be<br/>
later at all) but that our society has become so brainwashed by the<br/>
school system, most folks think 5-7 is &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My Jared at age 10 was not reading. He was learning to read, but he<br/>
asked us to read EVERYTHING to him at that age. Everything.<br/>
Once we read his game cards over and over, he would remember them. He<br/>
could remember literally hundreds of cards, hundreds of game symbols<br/>
but he couldn&#39;t decipher the alphabet or written words.<br/>
<br/>
To the world, he was a &quot;non-reader&quot;. I could see he was learning more<br/>
and more as he asked about words, why they sounded a certain way,<br/>
where letters came from etc... He was curious.<br/>
<br/>
Up until very recently (he was 12 in August) he didn&#39;t read fluently.<br/>
All of the sudden, he&#39;s not only reading better than his younger<br/>
sister (who has been reading much longer than him) he&#39;s writing and<br/>
typing. <br/>
<br/>
He was just on the game &quot;Kalonline&quot; (which requires talking to other<br/>
players) and when I walked in the room the game was gone and a message<br/>
in my search bar said &quot;it&#39;s all yours Mom&quot;. :)<br/>
<br/>
He types messages all the time now!! He&#39;s asking how to spell things<br/>
all the time and is reading quickly. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stress. Try to see your child as &quot;learning&quot;, not having<br/>
&quot;trouble&quot;. It will happen, just not on someone elses time table and<br/>
NOT nearly as well if you push.<br/>
