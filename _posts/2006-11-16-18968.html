<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774665125">Hi, <br/>
Is there anyone out there unschooling a child with Asperger&#39;s <br/>
syndrome? I&#39;d love to hear from someone in a similar circumstance and <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently met someone who has a child similar to my son and after <br/>
speaking to the mother I really feel for her, but there&#39;s something I <br/>
don&#39;t get. She feels raising her child is very challenging and has <br/>
her son in a lot of different programs to help him. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but wonder if I&#39;m doing a disservice to my son, however <br/>
to us he seems just fine so I don&#39;t know. Are special social skill <br/>
classes etc necessary or can we continue teaching him as we go about <br/>
our life? It seems to work but am I wrong. <br/>
<br/>
The other day she told me that she fought with her son for 2 hrs and <br/>
wanted to know if that ever happened to me. It never has. I have a <br/>
very happy child. ( just lucky?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given him a lot of freedom. If he wants to eat ketchup on a <br/>
fried egg, fine, go ahead. Don&#39;t want a jacket? That&#39;s fine, it&#39;s in <br/>
the car if you change your mind. Paper air plane in the living room? <br/>
Hang a ghost from the light? Knock yourself out. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My concern, is it ok to give such a child all the freedom I&#39;m giving <br/>
him? Will I hurt him in the long run? Is it ok to totally unschool an <br/>
aspie? He&#39;s learning tons and I like him the way he is. He&#39;s friendly <br/>
and easy to get along with. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to here from someone who may know. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening to my rambling and for any comments. Hope you <br/>
all have a great day!<br/>
<br/>

Isn&#39;t his happiness enough to let you know that you&#39;re doing just fine?<br/>
Why would you want to emulate someone that fought with her child for<br/>
TWO hours?? Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Keep trusting him. I think children with these traits are MUCH better<br/>
served with the unschooling lifestyle and have less challenges as<br/>
adults because of that freedom. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he&#39;s happy and learning, what more could you want?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there are a lot of families dealing with Aspergers and Autism<br/>
traits.<br/>

My question would be, if your child is happy, friendly, easy to get<br/>
along with, and learning tons, why wouldn&#39;t you want to continue doing<br/>
what you are doing?  It sounds as if something is working right.  :)<br/>
<br/>
What is it you feel he would be missing by going to traditional<br/>
schools?  What do you think he would gain from such a venture?  Can<br/>
you meet his needs yourself?  Unfortunately, I have met many parents<br/>
who have the attitude of &quot;This is too hard for me so I am going to let<br/>
someone else deal with this.&quot;  (This being their child.)  I ran into a<br/>
high school friend the other day.  She is a local &quot;celebrity&quot; in that<br/>
she had a set of quints 11 years ago (they are the same age almost to<br/>
the day as my 11 year old.)  We chatted for a while as I watched her<br/>
boys reading books and loving being in a bookstore.  She asked me what<br/>
grade the kids were in now and I said, &quot;Um, I don&#39;t know.  We<br/>
homeschool and I don&#39;t keep up with grades.&quot;  She then went on about<br/>
how hard it was to raise 5 children and how she was SO glad that there<br/>
was free public education so she didn&#39;t have to &quot;deal&quot; with her<br/>
children all day and how she could never homeschool because her<br/>
children are so vastly different with IQ&#39;s from 95 to 170 and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be fair to homeschool them since the smart one would make the<br/>
not-so-smart one feel stupid all the time.  Yet she has her children<br/>
(all age 11) in three different grade levels and in two different<br/>
schools.  Yeah, that&#39;s fair.  All I could think about was how cool her<br/>
kids are and how much fun it would be to set out on an adventure with<br/>
the five of them and explore the all the world had to offer.  All she<br/>
could see was work.  She thought I was &quot;wonderful&quot; to be able to<br/>
homeschool my three vastly different kids.  I just had to chuckle to<br/>
myself because she just didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting your friend doesn&#39;t get it either.  The system has made<br/>
raising a child with different needs seem more difficult than it is.<br/>
I bet with some gentle parenting and some reevaluation as to what is<br/>
important that the arguments and such would diminish greatly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902494779">I know OF some families unschooling their children with Asperger&#39;s, and it&#39;s <br/>
working out very well for them.  Have you thought about looking into an <br/>
Asperger&#39;s homeschooling yahoo group?  There is at least one.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
if anyone there could help you, but you never know.<br/>

Sorry I cannot offer first hand advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129019642">Oh Maggie, I&#39;m so glad you posted.  I have an undiagnosed Aspie.  We are in the process of getting her diagnosed.  She SOOOO fits the criteria though.........Terrible Social Skills, Hand Flapping, Rages, Anxieties and Fixations, Sensory Processing Disorder, the list goes on and on.  Anyway my daughter is 6 and has Oh, so many issues we are dealing with right now.  She flies into rages where she kicks and punches the walls, screams bloody murder.......I&#39;m sure the neighbors will be calling the cops and or social services on us.  She can&#39;t control her impulses......etc. etc.  Now I know any number of parents also that say Oh, I can&#39;t deal with that, let the school system come up with a way to deal with that.  NO WAY!  I pulled my girls out of school in September and it&#39;s one of best darn decisions I ever made.  My daughter hated school......both of my daughters actually.  School put my daughter into sensory overload and she would come home after school and rage for two hours<br/>
 everyday.  She learns differently than other kids.  The school system was not going to honor that.  My daughter was expected to sit in a desk for long period.  That just did a number on her sensory issues.  Here at home she does not have to sit in a chair or desk.  Often she eats while standing at the table or writes in her journal while standing.  At school she was constantly in trouble, and for things I saw as non-issues.....but the school saw them as issues.  I remember her  coming home one day and saying she got in trouble because she was reading a book and would not put it down.  OK, I get that the class was moving onto something else, but OMG it was a big eye opener for me.  If my child wants to read for two hours why not?  My daughter was also bored to tears in school.  She was so far ahead of the other kids.  It just was not gonna work.  As far as classes/services/therapies etc. well that is up to each individual.  We will probably get Mariah some Occupational<br/>
 Therapy for her Sensory Issues.  She has had it in the past and it&#39;s helped a lot.  Other Therapies I am not sure yet.  Now I have a friend that is an adult aspie.  She to this day can&#39;t stand anything social.  If you think you are going to her house for a BBQ......no way.  But anyway she total functions in society.  She has worked for the US Government for 20 years.  She is extremely intelligent, has a advanced degree.  She has two kids (one of them an aspie) and a husband.  Her husband is kind of anti-social like her so it works out fine.  She is happy and life is fine.  Anyway my point to that is she tells me all the time about how school was pure hell for her.  College and beyond were fine, because then it was on her terms.  She sends her kids to an excellent private school for special needs kids, but she is strongly in favor of homeschooling.  So I love having the adult aspie perspective on this one.  So if you ask my opinion, Yes, an aspie can be homeschooled and/or<br/>
 Unschooled.  I love my daughter and I know I am doing the best thing for her.  She loves being home and she loves learning in freedom.  She&#39;s six, and just last night wrote a book about gardening with illustrations and all.  She did it because she wanted to and enjoyed it, not because it was being forced on her.  I am amazed at the wonderful things she does everyday.  I hope I&#39;ve eased your mind.  I think you are doing the right thing.<br/>
