OK this leads me to a question of how much &quot;meddling&quot; I ought to do.<br/>
My son Liam (9) seems to be having autoimmune issues.  Well we know he<br/>
is.  He&#39;s been having trouble (erythma nodosum) and we&#39;ve been just<br/>
doing for him at home.  But it recently got so bad he asked to go to<br/>
the Dr.  So we went.  Given that I have AI issues, my mother and much<br/>
of my father&#39;s family as well...they pulled blood to check him.  We<br/>
are still waiting for results.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing.  Liam doesn&#39;t want to do meds.  (I don&#39;t blame him.)<br/>
 He wants to try to manage this naturally which means rest, good diet,<br/>
exercise for the most part.  Now, since he&#39;s 9 he doesn&#39;t always get<br/>
enough rest.  Or eat right etc.  And I&#39;m caught where I don&#39;t know how<br/>
to remind him or help him without it looking like nagging.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>
complained about nagging, I am just aware of how it might sound.  So<br/>
what is the right way to work this without making it seem like I&#39;m<br/>
pushing or nagging but I know that he sometimes forgets things or<br/>
isn&#39;t aware of what he&#39;s eating etc.<br/>
<br/>
**RE: the food.  I don&#39;t really care what he eats but some things will<br/>
make him feel better than others and some things will actually cause<br/>
him physical pain like artificial sweetners.  We&#39;ve made the<br/>
connection already.  (It does the same thing to me too.)  BUT if he<br/>
chooses to suck up the pain and have whatever I&#39;m fine with that.  I<br/>
just don&#39;t know in the moment *the time before he puts it in his<br/>
mouth* if he&#39;s making a decision based on knowledge or just doing it.<br/>
And I don&#39;t know how to make &quot;Hey do you know what you are eating?&quot;<br/>
not sound like I&#39;m nagging.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750123778">Well, for *us* it means that if I notice Dan is picking up something  <br/>
with wheat (which at four, he&#39;s pretty good about knowing what is  <br/>
safe and what is not) I&#39;ll say &quot;Hey, that has wheat in it, do you  <br/>
want to try something else?&quot; at which point he has a choice. He  <br/>
usually picks something wheat-free, but that means that I have LOTS  <br/>
of alternatives that are appealing. We&#39;ve made homemade ding dongs,  <br/>
twinkies, lots of baked goods.<br/>
Most of what we have grocery wise that has wheat, we either purchase  <br/>
an alternative or be prepared to make one quickly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t *he* the best judge of whether it&#39;s nagging?<br/>
<br/>
Ask *him* what he&#39;d like you to do rather than what other people  <br/>
think you should do for him ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you put providing information in the category of nagging, it&#39;s  <br/>
going to feel like nagging.<br/>
<br/>
If you put requirements on the choice he makes with the information,  <br/>
it&#39;s going to *be* nagging ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I think one aspect that differentiates &#39;nagging&#39; from providing<br/>
information is that nagging tends to have an undertone of expectation -<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m telling you this and I expect you to act in thus and such way.&quot; If<br/>
you&#39;re providing information &quot;hey that has HFCS in it&quot; or &quot;gee you might<br/>
feel better later if you have a bit of cheese before you have another<br/>
donut&quot; then allowing the person addressed to *choose* whether to have<br/>
the HFCS or not, or another donut or some protein, or whatever, then<br/>
it&#39;s not so much nagging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963358143">OK because as I said, it&#39;s up to him.  I sometimes make a decision<br/>
that it&#39;s worth whatever pain I might have to eat something at that<br/>
time, but I&#39;m hyper-aware of what&#39;s in the foods I eat.  Because he&#39;s<br/>
9 and this is new to him I know he doesn&#39;t think about it much.  I<br/>
want to help him manage his body in the way he is most comfortable so<br/>
I don&#39;t want to make him feel as though I&#39;m nagging him at all.  Good<br/>
suggestions everyone I appreciate it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ask him how he wants it handled? Maybe he wants you to remind him <br/>
what&#39;s what. Maybe he knows what&#39;s in a lot of things only wants <br/>
info when he asks for it. You could set up an understanding ahead of <br/>
time of how much info to offer and when based on what he wants.<br/>
