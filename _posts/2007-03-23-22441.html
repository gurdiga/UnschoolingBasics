<div id="ygrps-yiv-765310376">Often, I hear folks don&#39;t quite know how to connect to other<br/>
homeschoolers in our area. There are many groups with people new to<br/>
homeschooling, or new to the area, who haven&#39;t created connections<br/>
with other homeschoolers. So, last month I put together a list of<br/>
weekly activities that worked for me and our friends, and posted it<br/>
around to many of the local groups and invited all to join us. It has<br/>
grown to now include weekly park days, and partnering with the library<br/>
for space to meet weekly for Fun Clubs and Game Days. <br/>
<br/>
The activities include area parks, state parks, bike days, hiking,<br/>
museum outings, picnicking, and weekend family events such as camping,<br/>
festivals, parades, gem shows, etc. There is no age restriction for<br/>
participation, all family members are welcome. We are focused on fun<br/>
and connecting with others. <br/>
<br/>
The template for our Fun Clubs is &quot;Do What You Love! Share What You<br/>
Love!&quot; Clubs will be led by adults or kids about their passions. Here<br/>
are some ideas to start brainstorming, what do you and your kids<br/>
LOVE?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anime, art/drawing Club<br/>
ATC-Artist Trading Cards Club<br/>
Astronomy Club<br/>

Yu-Gi-Oh! Club<br/>

<br/>
Hope that sparks some creativity for meeting needs in your community!<br/>
Many of the other groups are academic focused, so by creating<br/>
something with a *Fun Focus*, we are attracting more relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers to have fun with! (Build it and they will come! ;-))<br/>
