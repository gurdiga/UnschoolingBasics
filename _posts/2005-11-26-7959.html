<div id="ygrps-yiv-71888577">&quot;What I&#39;m asking for here are specific ideas/examples of how some of <br/>
you did<br/>
things back in the day of young children, nursing babies who don&#39;t <br/>
nap, and<br/>
so on!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I&#39;d suggest a sling, but I saw you with that little one <br/>
strapped on at the conference, so I know you&#39;ve already got that <br/>
covered!:)<br/>
I think when your children are very little, you really have to work <br/>
as seeing the time you have with them as your only job. If you get <br/>
to clean or cook, it&#39;s a bonus.  I know that sounds lame, but if you <br/>
accept that, it will be easier.<br/>
<br/>
If you can afford to hire a nice older lady or teen to come in and <br/>
play mothers helper once a week, DO IT. Let them cook or clean while <br/>
you play with the kids, OR let them distract the kids while you <br/>
catch up. It&#39;s so worth the money. I didn&#39;t get to do this often, <br/>
but those rare times were lovely.<br/>
<br/>
I always suggest keeping a stash of dollar store toys, new snacks, <br/>
any interesting items that are different than what you already own.<br/>
Pull those out when you really are longing to see your counters <br/>
again, or when the kids are cranky and you need to re-focus the <br/>
energy.  PLAYDOUGH! I can&#39;t say enough good about playdough. When <br/>
the playdough was out, that one area of the house was getting <br/>
trashed but I could run around and pick up some other stuff. I don&#39;t <br/>
care for many baby contraptions, but I DID love having a high chair <br/>
for wee babsy art projects. Jalen never had one, but it might have <br/>
been nice for the playdough moments.:)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a new game I&#39;ve discovered that allows me to clean while <br/>
playing with Jalen and Sierra...Hide-n-seek.  I LOVE being the one <br/>
to count, because the entire time I&#39;m looking for them, I&#39;m picking <br/>
stuff up. It&#39;s great. They are happily playing and I actually get <br/>
something done.<br/>
It&#39;s easier for us now, with mostly older kids in the house. <br/>
Just remember, when you&#39;re in the midst of baby/toddler stuff, it <br/>
feels like it&#39;s going to be forever.<br/>
You&#39;ll be hugging big, tall teens soon and all the mess and chaos of <br/>
the younger years will be forgotten and mostly what you&#39;ll remember <br/>
is the happy smiles and fun projects and cuddly moments.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and going for drives. I know you don&#39;t get housework done, but a <br/>
long, exploratory drive is a great way to keep everyone happy and <br/>
spark new connections.<br/>
