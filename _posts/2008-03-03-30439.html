<div id="ygrps-yiv-463324405">Hi all-<br/>
I am putting together my sons portfolio (Florida) and need to put his main passion which is physical exercise and working out into educationalize.  He spends 3-4 hours a day at the gym, we have a home gym w/ punching bags, weights, bench press, medicine ball, etc.  Other than the obvious physical education and anatomy, can anyone give me additional ideas on how to incorporate additional &#39;subjects&#39; from this?  Any help or web links would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763877748">does he research anything in relation to what he&#39;s doing - read body<br/>
building magazines, look up info on nutrition, etc? That&#39;d be reading,<br/>
for starters. Figuring out stuff related to BMI, etc would incorporate<br/>
math. In addition to anatomy, there&#39;s also biology and physiology and<br/>
kinesiology. Does he talk with folks he works out with? That&#39;d be social<br/>
skills. Does he explore things like martial arts or anything? that&#39;d<br/>
encompass history and geography (don&#39;t know if that applies at all)<br/>
Also, FL does not legally mandate any specific subject areas so you have<br/>
some leeway there.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for next year, have you considered going with an umbrella rather<br/>
than through the district? - that way you basically email attendance<br/>
info once a month and that&#39;s it.<br/>

I find it rare when someone has an all-encompassing interest and <br/>
doesn&#39;t include history, art, math, science, reading, social studies, <br/>
and writing in it. It&#39;s just natural!<br/>
<br/>
Science: physics of lifting/throwing/movement. chemistry of food & its <br/>
preparation. biology---of the whole-she-bang: <br/>
anatomy/physiology/nutrition/etc. Psychology of sports & athletes.<br/>
<br/>
History: GREECE, especially. Mayans---or was it the Aztecs? history of <br/>
sports and sporting events through the ages. Sports of each continent. <br/>
Asian sports/martial arts: karate/judo/etc. Sports as they relate to <br/>
war---HUGE! and funeral games popular with many, many groups---esp the <br/>
Romans. Gladiatorial fights. Oh---Greeks and Trojans! Speaking of <br/>
Trojans---names of sports teams.....maybe that should be under Social <br/>
Studies. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Social Studies: interaction with other athletes, study of sport and <br/>
events on society, gym mentality---just observations of athletes and <br/>
sporting events. Advertising to athletes. Names of sports teams. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Math: weights & measures. lots and lots of physics (and the cool thing <br/>
about physics is that it counts as science AND math! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Literature/Reading: I&#39;m guessing what he reads is magazines and books <br/>
related to the body/sports/etc. Use them!<br/>
<br/>
Composition/Writing: IM and e-lists. What else does he write? <br/>
Journaling about his progress.<br/>
<br/>
Art: again---endless opportunities here---especially with the Greeks! <br/>
Athletes in art. Sports in art. The human body AS art.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a hobby or sport or interest that doesn&#39;t touch on each and <br/>
every &quot;school subject.&quot; Sometimes it just takes some *looking*.<br/>
<br/>
Does this get you started? Or do you need more help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887425941">biomechanics and even some physics if you look at anything long enough<br/>
you can find LOTS of &quot;subjects&quot;.  My son Liam is going nuts on the<br/>
microscope now, so for that work I&#39;ve got: (oh and I don&#39;t list<br/>
anything by &quot;subject&quot; usually, just as skills)<br/>
<br/>
Biology<br/>
color<br/>
chemistry (preparing slides with gram stain)<br/>
optics<br/>
hand-eye coordination<br/>
fine motor skills<br/>
sample collection and preparation<br/>
fresh and salt water microecology<br/>
lab equipment prep and care<br/>
writing<br/>
drawing<br/>
compare and contrast<br/>
Anthony Leeuwenhoek<br/>
scientific method<br/>
journal keeping<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just off the top of my head.  I&#39;m sure I could come up with more.<br/>
