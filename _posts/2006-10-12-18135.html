I think that unschool mom must be very old and very tired.... She&#39;s<br/>
been on the march a long time, you know. And look at her  rag-tag<br/>
little classroom! All she has has for pupils are you and me. Dumb<br/>
little class. Listen! The drum beat isn&#39;t even regular. Everyone is<br/>
out of step. And there! You see?  She keeps stopping along the way to<br/>
pick up one of her tinier pupils who decided to wander off and play<br/>
with a frog, or run in a field, or whose foot got tangled in the<br/>
underbrush. She will never get anywhere that way. And yet, the march<br/>
goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see how the marchers have broken up into little groups? Look at<br/>
that group up near the front. Now, there&#39;s a snappy out fit... â€“at<br/>
least they&#39;re in step with each other. Only they&#39;re not wearing their<br/>
shoes. They&#39;re carrying them in their hands. Silly little band. They<br/>
won&#39;t get far before mom will have to stop again.... And that group<br/>
over there.  They are holding hands.  Except the ones on the ends<br/>
noticed that they weren&#39;t holding another hand so the formed a circle.<br/>
 They will never get anywhere that way.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
Whenever I think about what unschooling is all about this is the image<br/>
I get. (I adapted that from a piece of prose by Martin Bell in his<br/>
book &quot;The Way of the Wolf&quot;  It is a collection of Christian prose,<br/>
poem and thoughts written eeek maybe 30 years ago?)  Anyway, the poem<br/>
is called God&#39;s Rag-Tag Army and it truly is descriptive of our<br/>
household.  If we were an unschooling army we would be marching in<br/>
circles, playing with frogs, getting caught in the underbrush, yet we<br/>
would still continue our &quot;march&quot; forward, getting to where we want to<br/>
get one step at a time, one adventure at a time, with no regards to<br/>
how an &quot;army&quot; should behave (unless, of course, we were wanting to<br/>
know how armies really behave :-D)<br/>
