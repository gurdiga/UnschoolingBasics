<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534579569">Certified isn&#39;t the proper word.  In Vermont you must be &quot;enrolled&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure being the highest tax burdened state in the nation<br/>
screams individual rights.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is a ling directly to the Dept. of Ed. so you can see EXACTLY the<br/>
paperwork that comes along every year.  Have fun!  (said sarcastically)<br/>

<br/>
We are considered a &quot;red state&quot;.  Very strict.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong.  Unschooling is very, very possible.  There are<br/>
many of us here.  There are a few ways to &quot;assess&quot; at the end of the<br/>
year and still be compliant.  Also, there are plenty here who are<br/>
non-compliant.  Those who have chosen to fly under the radar.  <br/>
<br/>
If you would like a brief explanation of the guidelines the HSLDA<br/>
website should have them listed.  (although I am not endorsing the<br/>
HSLDA, they have a good map.  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149490115">Also, In Vermont, when enrolling you must prove that your child is NOT<br/>
disabled.  <br/>
<br/>
I always thought that was the most screwed up policy.  I mean to we<br/>
really have so many disabled children here that I have to prove that<br/>
mine isn&#39;t?  Vermont likes us on state programs and state insurance. <br/>
That might be why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295400495">I was surprised, but I don&#39;t live in VT.  Saddens me a bit.  We like to <br/>
think of the northern New England states as supporting the old values of <br/>
Yankee independence and self-reliance.  Another illusion shattered ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the NEA is a national organization with a lot of clout at the state and <br/>
local level.  MA is moving towards adding an hour and a half to the school <br/>
day.  School districts get a lot of funding if they agree to do this.  Two <br/>
school districts close to ours have implemented pilot programs.  If they <br/>
did it here it would mean that elementary school children would go from <br/>
8:30 AM until 4:30 PM.  They call it expanding the child&#39;s learning <br/>
opportunity or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
The older of my two still school aged opted out and is unschooling now, but <br/>
the younger, in grade 6, is not ready yet.  I don&#39;t push her but she&#39;s <br/>
beginning to think about how she can leave school and still maintain the <br/>
things she enjoys, mostly the social aspect.  We talk about participating <br/>
in sports, involving her school friends in our volunteering efforts, <br/>
etc.  I think she&#39;ll be ready next year, but will honor her choice if she <br/>
wants to stay in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673844741">We&#39;re Vermont homeschoolers. This is our second year.<br/>
<br/>
We used the teacher assessment option last year and it went very well. <br/>
No pressure. She talked to us for a while, learned what we had been <br/>
doing, wrote a letter to the state and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the year (for the first 3 years, I believe) you have <br/>
to send in a notice of enrollment in homestudy and a &quot;minimum course of <br/>
study&quot; describing your plans for the year. I can tell you my first <br/>
year&#39;s study plan bore little resemblance to what we actually did, and <br/>
that was fine. This year my study plan was much shorter!<br/>
<br/>
Other than those two sets of paperwork, we&#39;ve had no interaction with <br/>
the state on our homeschooling.<br/>

If you belong to any YahooGroups this may be important...<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo is now using something called &quot;Web Beacons&quot; to track Yahoo<br/>
Group users around the net and see what you&#39;re doing and where you<br/>
are<br/>
going (similar to cookies.) Yahoo is recording every website and<br/>
every<br/>
group you visit.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at their updated privacy statement:<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
http://info. yahoo.com/ privacy/us/ yahoo/details. html<br/>
<br/>
2. About half-way down the page, in the section on Cookies, you<br/>
will see a link that says Web Beacons. Click on the phrase &quot;Web<br/>
Beacons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3. That will bring you to a paragraph entitled &quot;Outside the Yahoo<br/>
Network&quot;. In this section you&#39;ll see a little &quot;click here to opt out&quot;<br/>
link which will let you &quot;opt-out&quot; of their new method of snooping You<br/>
need to click the confirm opt out on that page.<br/>
<br/>
4. Once you have clicked that link, you are exempted. Notice the<br/>
&quot;Success&quot; message on the top of the next page. Be careful because<br/>
on that page there is also a &quot;Cancel Opt-out&quot; button which, if<br/>
clicked, will *undo* the opt-out. It appears after you have hit the<br/>
opt-out button so is very confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to forward this to others and groups.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t be too sad - CT is still the land of the free, us diehard, hard<br/>
nosed New England Yankees. There is NO homeschooling law here, not even<br/>
&quot;case law&quot; (as in MA). The applicable statute is basically an updating<br/>
of the original Ludlow&#39;s Code of 1650 that says that a parent is to<br/>
educate their children - no word on how, when, where. A later clause was<br/>
added to allow for public schools &quot;educate or cause to be educated&quot;.<br/>
Yes, there are those who try to coerce parents into things that aren&#39;t<br/>
required and there&#39;s the occasional attempt to legislate regulations<br/>
but, like the Minutemen of old, we hit the state capitol en masse and<br/>
make sure that doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>

   <br/>
  How are the taxes in CT? My dh is from CT but his home of record is VA (military). I&#39;ve been trying to get him to switch back to CT because I heard they don&#39;t require military living outside the state to pay any state taxes. That wasn&#39;t my reason for asking that, though. I&#39;d move there (which my dh would love) for the homeschooling laws if I didn&#39;t have to freeze my butt off. Is there ANYWHERE warm to live in CT? I cannot stand being cold. If the temp dips below 70, I need long pants and a sweater. <br/>
