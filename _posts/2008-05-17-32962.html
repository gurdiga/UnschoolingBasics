If it hasn&#39;t been said yet (I have way too many groups I belong to - over  <br/>
200 emails, lol!), Rue Kream&#39;s &quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot; is an EXCELLENT book and <br/>
 one that describes life itself. A great read! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446373193">Maybe it should be in my sig line! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
_Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life_ by our very own Rue Kream <br/>
(a moderator here).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth its weight in gold---and has a picture of Rue&#39;s cute butt on <br/>
the cover. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

From the conversations going on, I think what I am<br/>
trying to do is radical unschooling. My husband isn&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-261350830">I second that it&#39;s a great resource! And, because it&#39;s written in a Q&A<br/>
type style, it&#39;s easy to just read a section and put it down and come<br/>
back to it later. Which makes it great bathroom reading for reluctant<br/>
spouses :-) It&#39;s not a huge time commitment which sometimes gets in the<br/>
way of people, especially those who are hesitant in the first place. <br/>
