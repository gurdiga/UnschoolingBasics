&gt;&gt;Is 14 months old enough to self-regulate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you mean by &#39;self-regulate&#39; sleep when tired, awake<br/>
when not tired enough to fall asleep, then I say<br/>
children are born with the ability.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If you have experience with this, how did it work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for you?<br/>
<br/>
I never have/never will give my children &quot;bed times&quot;. <br/>
They fall asleep when and where they want to.  I can<br/>
tell when my children are tired and ready to fall<br/>
asleep.  If they don&#39;t just pass out on the spot, I<br/>
help them fall asleep by &#39;nursing them down&#39;.  Do you<br/>
still nurse your 14 month old?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My main concern is that she will be overtired and<br/>
&gt;&gt;not function well <br/>
&gt;&gt;during the day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this happens to us all when we don&#39;t get<br/>
enough sleep.  But, it&#39;s not the end of the world. <br/>
Naps help.  They may also fall asleep earlier the next<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want to &quot;force her to sleep&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t.  Do you want to be forced to sleep?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She, even now, has the ability to play quietly or<br/>
&gt;&gt;look at books or <br/>
&gt;&gt;move around when in her room.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume she sleeps in her room, and you sleep<br/>
separately in yours?  Have you tried letting her play<br/>
in your room and do the things above in your room<br/>
while you are sleeping?  Perhaps you can close the<br/>
door and child proof the knob so she can&#39;t get out if<br/>
there are safety issues.  Then she can fall asleep<br/>
when *she* is ready to; not necessarily when *you* are<br/>
ready for her to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She sleeps on a mattress on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you tried sleeping with her?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If we close the door, she screams and screams until<br/>
&gt;&gt;we either bring <br/>
&gt;&gt;her out to be with us or falls asleep eventually. I<br/>
&gt;&gt;do not want to <br/>
&gt;&gt;continue this way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds scarey.  What message is this sending her?<br/>
Abandonment.  No one cares about her feelings. <br/>
Helplessness.  All the reasons I hate Ferber. I am<br/>
glad you want to try something different.<br/>

<br/>
She gave up nursing about a month ago on her own.<br/>
She just got more and more squirmy and seemed like she would rather <br/>
get down and play. Started being unable to nurse with anyone else <br/>
around first, then just stopped wanting to at all.<br/>
So, unfortunately, no nursing as comfort :(<br/>
(That did work with my son)<br/>
<br/>
The overtired part is very hard because both of my kids are so <br/>
little. Her feelings spill over onto Jacob and he gets all worked up <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, part of the puzzle is getting clearer today.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t really sure why it was bothering me all of a sudden.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know if she was being more difficult or I was just getting <br/>
more run down. <br/>
The books and posts were definitely making me think a lot about her <br/>
needs and what she might be wanting.<br/>
Tonight, she was really congested at bedtime and she had some GI <br/>
issues earlier this week.<br/>
I think maybe she has a little bit of a bug and is really <br/>
uncomfortable (on top of teething)<br/>
She was fussy at bedtime in the past and was having trouble going <br/>
down, but nothing like this.<br/>
Hopefully, I can bear with her and things will get better soon.<br/>
<br/>
She is up again (it is midnight here) so I need to go.<br/>
Thank you for the ideas and support<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711789552">Hi Kiersten !<br/>
 I&#39;ve just now found some time this week to read thru the post.  I <br/>
was wondering if Emma got to bed alittle easier after her 30 min nap <br/>
the other day?  My boys are 6 and 11 now, but I have raised another <br/>
one also, and I can certainly remember those times being up at night <br/>
and feeling like I&#39;m never going to get caught up on sleep again!  <br/>
Now, I&#39;M  the one taking naps, ALL the time!  <br/>
  Though my kids didn&#39;t go thru quite what your daughter is, I have a <br/>
friend who&#39;s daughter never slept from her 1st day home!  Ok, she had <br/>
to sleep sometime, but I had never seen anything like it before. <br/>
   Anyway, her 13 year old was and still is extremely bright.  I <br/>
could rattle on at what she was doing at what age, but that really <br/>
isn&#39;t important. But what I do want to say is if your reading John <br/>
Holts books, remember, he says children learn by playing.  I have a <br/>
feeling Emma is so thrilled with the world around her she is afraid <br/>
she is going to miss something by sleeping!<br/>
  This won&#39;t last forever and before you know it, she&#39;ll be going <br/>
thru some other stage!  I do hope she&#39;s feeling better today!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752267575">Hi Syndi,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, her name is Emma :)<br/>
Well, actually she didn&#39;t go to bed till 4:45 in the morning!<br/>
That night was really hard.<br/>
But, I DO think it was because she has a cold.<br/>
She and Jacob are both faucets of snot today.<br/>
I bet that is why I started feeling so overwhelmed!<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to make the bedtime experience an even more <br/>
peaceful, happy time.<br/>
I rearranged her room, to give her the option of sleeping on the <br/>
toddler bed or on the bed on the floor. I also have found that if I <br/>
leave the door wide open and pretty much &quot;shut down&quot; all the <br/>
stimulus in the rest of the house, she will eventually come and lay <br/>
with me. It is almost like she is happy to know she has the option <br/>
to leave at any time so she is content to stay.<br/>
(Before I was shutting her in with me during the attempts for sleep <br/>
and only opening the door when I thought she was ready to sleep)<br/>
<br/>
I think she is probably very similar to the child you describe.<br/>
It is all &quot;learning time&quot;<br/>
She has hit every milestone early, crawling at 5 months, walking at <br/>
9, etc.<br/>
We have always joked that it was because she spent so many more <br/>
hours a day practicing, LOL<br/>
Guess I should be happy she is so interested in everything around <br/>
her.<br/>
Hopefully, it will make unschooling that much easier.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t want to lose that spark :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder that all will get better.<br/>
I feel very positive about everything today, like it is all back in <br/>
perspective!<br/>
I do think that the more I quit trying to control things (and/or <br/>
people), the calmer I feel which makes the world better for all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891315006">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always had a negative visceral reaction to toy guns (or cannons, or<br/>
other imlements of destruction) and I guess I was kind of hoping my kids<br/>
might not really be attacted to them, like EVER.  But being on this list and<br/>
especially the discussions we&#39;ve had about values and kids choices helped<br/>
prepare me for today!  I went with my sister and all our kids to a nearby<br/>
playpark that has a gift shop on the way out.  I was nursing my tired son<br/>
outside the gift shop while my sister was in there with her kids and my<br/>
daughter (5.9).  I knew my dd was picking out a toy and offered one to my<br/>
son also.  When we got inside, my sister was heading for the exit ... I<br/>
asked my dd, who was a ways away, if she had something she wanted and she<br/>
waved something at me I couldn&#39;t see, saying &quot;Aunt Marie already got it for<br/>
me!&quot;  My sister was tired and had a toddler diving out of her stroller so<br/>
she said &quot;Meet you at the van...&quot; and headed for the door with her kids and<br/>
my dd.<br/>
<br/>
After getting my son&#39;s toy we got to the car and turns out my daughter had<br/>
picked out this Western play kit that had two guns in it - a rifle and an<br/>
old fashioned western gun.  I was less than thrilled and sort of wished I<br/>
had the opportunity to have talked to her a bit before we bought it....YES,<br/>
if she insisted on it I would have bought it, but I would have likely<br/>
mentioned that toy guns remind me of real guns which I find upsetting, and<br/>
as it turns out after I mildly mentioned this in my sister&#39;s van, turns out<br/>
it was the handcuffs that attracted her in the first place - possibly we<br/>
could have just found those without the guns.  But she said &quot;Well, mom,<br/>
these are PRETENDIE...They can&#39;t hurt anyone.&quot;  She&#39;s right.  In any event,<br/>
she had the guns and I knew that it was going to be interesting figuring out<br/>
how to honor my own feelings about them and express those while allowing her<br/>
to do what she needed to and wanted to do with them.  But I did feel better<br/>
just asking her questions and listening to her talk about them in the van,<br/>
how she could play police officer and bandit (there was a mask) with them at<br/>
the same time.  She was really excited by the possibilities of play, and it<br/>
wasn&#39;t about hurting.  I calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
She played with them in the car - mostly figuring out how they worked - then<br/>
we got back to my sister&#39;s house where we played for a while before coming<br/>
home.  Dd was playing with the rifle and my brother in law came in the room.<br/>
She was showing it off to him and pointed it at him and pulled the trigger.<br/>
He seemed unbothered by it, but my sister all of a sudden came out with &quot;You<br/>
shouldn&#39;t point that at someone and shoot.  You should learn about gun<br/>
safety because if that was a real gun you shouldn&#39;t ever do that...&quot; and<br/>
then she left the room.  Aline came over to me, very upset, and said &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t understand Aunt Marie&#39;s rule ... these are pretend guns, they don&#39;t<br/>
hurt anyone...&quot;  I said &quot;Yes, they are pretend.  Let me go talk to Aunt<br/>
Marie and find out what&#39;s up..&quot;  I talked to my sister about her comments,<br/>
pointed out these guns were pretend and Aline knew that, pointed out that a<br/>
major way to play with them was in fact to point and pretend to shoot them,<br/>
pointed out that there are plenty of times we&#39;re glad police officers have<br/>
them, and asked if what she was trying to do was possibly express that she<br/>
personally is uncomfortable with Aline playing with them.  She said yes,<br/>
that was what she was trying to say (which of course makes me wonder a lot<br/>
about her purchasing them for Aline without talking to me first if she felt<br/>
that uncomfortable...)<br/>
<br/>
Dd, Aline, seems to have gotten over my sister&#39;s comment - in the car on the<br/>
way home I told her I talked to her aunt and found out what she really<br/>
meant, but dd said &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to hear it&quot; so I respected that.<br/>
Actually after watching all the joy go out of dd&#39;s face at my sister&#39;s<br/>
comments, I am pretty determined to not superimpose my own discomfort on her<br/>
joy and to try to see what she is doing through her eyes instead of mine<br/>
before I speak.  It seems to me now that it&#39;s really not about the gun, but<br/>
about what she perceives she&#39;s doing with it that actually has an impact on<br/>
how I feel.  I am wondering though how to deal with the comments of others,<br/>
such as my sister, since we do know at least one family who has strong<br/>
feelings about guns.  I want to preserve my daughter&#39;s joy at playing with<br/>
them but also honor the feelings they evoke in others (and I can relate to<br/>
that since I have many of them).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Anybody been through anything similar with their kids?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be on vacation this week but reading replies in digest form when I get<br/>
back on Friday...Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is a terrific expression of a huge concept that could apply, not just<br/>
toy guns, but all kinds of areas where we as adults have a value judgment<br/>
that may be different from the child&#39;s. Recently somewhere (was it here?)<br/>
there was a thread about (schooled) teens appearing unmotivated, and one of<br/>
the reasons suggested was that they may be keeping their passions secret<br/>
from their parents because of the interests being judged and invalidated as<br/>
trivial or less worthy (ie not educational or vocational) over the course of<br/>
their childhood.<br/>
<br/>
It can be hard to remain open minded when it is a toy gun, because there is<br/>
a pervasive belief in the wider community that playing with guns equates to<br/>
a child becoming a violent person - not unlike playing violent video games.<br/>
This is a theory that is not borne out by the experiences related by long<br/>
term Unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
One of the wonderful moments from the Conference last year was when I was<br/>
chatting with a mother in the hall (sorry I don&#39;t remember who) when she<br/>
spotted her dd passing by. She called out to her and politely but excitedly<br/>
asked if she would mind letting her brother know that some other kids (pre<br/>
and early teen) were nearby playing some pretend game with long sticks (made<br/>
from pvc pipe) and he would be interested in joining it. <br/>
<br/>
This struck me most forcibly as being the exact opposite of how many parents<br/>
would react to the whole idea of that kind of game, including assuming the<br/>
children would be careless and dangerous, as well as spiritually/emotionally<br/>
harmed by the fighting fantasy. They would want it stopped at once. <br/>
<br/>
I have faith that the kids were responsible, careful and experienced. I am<br/>
totally sure that if there was a kid in the game who seemed to be lacking<br/>
self-control and dangerous to others, there would be a halt called and they<br/>
would seek the help of a familiar adult if the problem could not be<br/>
resolved. I can only assume that the other mother had equal faith. <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, the kids were playing absolutely openly and publicly in<br/>
the funshop room (more like a ballroom sized chamber). There was no secrecy<br/>
or hiding. There was acceptance and encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It seems to me now that it&#39;s really not about the gun, but<br/>
about what she perceives she&#39;s doing with it that actually has an impact on<br/>
how I feel.  I am wondering though how to deal with the comments of others,<br/>
such as my sister, since we do know at least one family who has strong<br/>
feelings about guns.  I want to preserve my daughter&#39;s joy at playing with<br/>
them but also honor the feelings they evoke in others (and I can relate to<br/>
that since I have many of them).&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My first thought is to not take the gun to that other family&#39;s home. On<br/>
other occasions, especially in your (her) home, it is more important to<br/>
honor your daughter&#39;s feelings than the possible feelings of other people,<br/>
none of whom you can control. You can continue to observe your dd and take<br/>
comfort in her evident grasp of the difference between fantasy play and<br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, another thing is to give her time for the newness of this toy to<br/>
wear off before necessarily having a play date with that particular family,<br/>
so that suggesting different games may be less of a privation for her. <br/>
<br/>
This issue has come up on occasion on my local group list in relation to<br/>
Park Days. Rarely, a family is anti-gun on broad principle; others subscribe<br/>
to the bad-toys-breed-psychos theory (see above); others are concerned about<br/>
immediate safety - the kids getting too excited and there being accidents in<br/>
&quot;violent&quot; play. These are some of the reasons our group tends to look for<br/>
good sized parks to allow the kids to separate into different groups for<br/>
different games. <br/>
<br/>
It is sometimes harder for people to deal with very realistic looking guns,<br/>
rather than colorful &quot;ray guns&quot; or something other weapon like faux swords.<br/>
On occasion people have been concerned that other park users will get &quot;the<br/>
wrong impression&quot; about our kids, especially during war-time. It is possible<br/>
to get tied into knots of non-logic worrying about pretty unlikely scenarios<br/>
and the opinions of unconnected strangers. <br/>
<br/>
One of the responses has been to reassure everyone that although there have<br/>
been the odd accidents at park days, none have been related to fantasy<br/>
weapons role playing. Another has been to talk about the kids&#39; needs to<br/>
process some of their fears and feelings about the war news, or societal<br/>
violence in general, to feel powerful in a safe environment with the surety<br/>
of their parents available to step in if it all got too much at any time.<br/>
<br/>
These are ideas that have been expressed by some of the parents of mostly<br/>
boys in our group who continue to engage in gun or weapons games. Jayn has<br/>
to date shown no interest in these games at the park. She does enjoy playing<br/>
&quot;On guard&quot; with us at home with her swords and shields - lots of collapsing<br/>
&quot;dead&quot; cured with the following incantation, &quot;magic, magic back alive!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Gun playing doesn&#39;t bother me. A child getting upset enough to use any toy<br/>
or object as an actual weapon, as against a fantasy weapon, is much more<br/>
worrying. Sand is more dangerous at the park than one kid&#39;s habitual bow and<br/>
suction cup arrows have ever been.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028171969">Now I&#39;m wondering about my reaction to my ds&#39;s gun play.  He has a few small<br/>
guns.  I too have felt uncomfortable w/ guns but bc of his desire to play w/<br/>
them and reading about the wrangling of others on unschooling lists, I&#39;ve<br/>
shifted my thinking.  But, I have asked my ds not to point it at anybody. T<br/>
date he hadn&#39;t payed guns w. any of his friends.  Only on his own when at<br/>
home.  He has a gun that shoots little plastic pellets and if anything were<br/>
to get in there, it could shoot it out.   It also has seemed to me logical<br/>
in that if he ever was in a situation where he found a gun, it would be<br/>
ingrained in him not to point it.  Maybe I&#39;m selling him short here thinking<br/>
he possibly wouldn&#39;t know the danger.  I don&#39;t know.  I do know though that<br/>
I&#39;m comfortable in asking him not to point it at me.  I do think it&#39;s fine<br/>
to share what makes me uncomfortable even if I get to a point where I think<br/>
pointing it at someone else is fine.<br/>
<br/>
More thinking to do on this one.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts in this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070859706">Hi Joan, <br/>
  I&#39;ll might not have any answers here but will share my story with <br/>
kids and guns.<br/>
  My oldest DS (who would be 22 now) was NEVER allowed to play with <br/>
pretend guns!  I was very young when I had him and just sorta <br/>
followed the crowd in the family in not letting kids have them.  By <br/>
the time he was 13 he owned his 1st BB gun, and after that a (Bb?) <br/>
pistol (not a real pistol but shot bb&#39;s i think or pellets).<br/>
  So when my 2nd ds came along I TRIED to keep him from the toy guns <br/>
also.  But by now we were in a new family with different ideas.  All <br/>
his cousins had their guns and mine didn&#39;t , so what did he do?  He <br/>
grabbed anything that looked like a gun and used it!  Needless to say <br/>
i&#39;ve given up the fight on &quot;gun (toy) control at home&quot;!<br/>
  So these guns of ours do get taken with us sometimes everywhere we <br/>
go.  Parks, stores, and such.  And i&#39;ve basically discussed with my <br/>
boys (6 and 11) that there are some people that do not care for guns <br/>
of any kind, and out of respect for them that we should not take our <br/>
guns into the stores or to the parks.  Reminding them that if it were <br/>
the other way around, we would hope that people would respect our <br/>
wish&#39;s.  Well, so far so good.  They&#39;ve never been upset at not <br/>
taking them any place we knew others wouldn&#39;t appriciate them.  But <br/>
then there were the times we didn&#39;t think anyone else would <br/>
be &quot;packin&quot; and sure enough they were! <br/>
well, thats how its been for us<br/>
