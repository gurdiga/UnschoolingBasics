<div id="ygrps-yiv-764423885">Jalen calls it &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; (prounounced nah-nah). He talked later, and <br/>
had a lot of frustration with not being understood. I started <br/>
calling them &quot;na-na&quot; because it was one of the only sounds he could <br/>
prounouce around 2y.o. It stuck.<br/>
He was really good with hand motions, telling us entire stories <br/>
without words until he was 3y.o. But sometimes the frustration level <br/>
would get high very quickly, so it was nice for him to have a word <br/>
for nursing that everyone understood...or that we could ask him and <br/>
get an affirmation.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s four now, and still loves his &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; every night (sometimes <br/>
in the wee hours of the morning too) and when he wakes up.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I dream of my body being my own again...but when we&#39;re <br/>
snuggled under the covers and that sweet little head is right under <br/>
my nose, there is nothing better in all the world.<br/>
I know how fast he&#39;ll be a teen, so I&#39;m just treasuring my last <br/>
little toddler. sigh.<br/>
