 </span></blockquote>For those who are in/close to the UK  - A quick reminder that we have an unschooling camp in Dorset next month, and any unschooling families are welcome to join us. I&#39;ve copied the original details below. If you think you might come along, sign up to the yahoo group, as we&#39;re starting to make plans over there. We already have 25 families in the group, so it should be a great opportunity to hang out with other unschoolers in a relaxed environment........<br/>
<br/>
A few of us are planning to go camping for a week in September, and would love for other unschooling families to join us. It will be very informal, and you can come along for the whole week or any part of it. We will be going to a fantastic campsite in Dorset : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.burnbake.com/.">http://www.burnbake.com/.</a> The site doesn&#39;t take bookings, but will not be busy after the school term starts, so there shouldn&#39;t be any problem getting pitches. The campsite is set in ancient woodlands and is just brilliant for children, with loads of rope & tyre swings, places to explore, a stream, bike trails nearby etc. Corfe Castle, the Swanage Steam Railway, Swanage and beautiful Studland beaches are all very close.<br/>
<br/>
The dates are Saturday 17 September through to Sunday 25 September. If the weather forecast is completely terrible as the date approaches, we will consider pushing it back by 1 week, so it would worth trying to keep that following week flexible if possible. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve set up a yahoo group to make it easy for anyone who is interested to stay in touch with the plans and each other - please sign up there if you think you might come along : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/UK_Unschooling_Camp/">http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/UK_Unschooling_Camp/</a><br/>
<br/>
For more info, either join the group and post there, or else email me directly<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some old and new friends at the camp<br/>
<br/>
