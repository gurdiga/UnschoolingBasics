<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097352245">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
It was great to meet so many people at the conference.  I was so <br/>
pumped and energized by it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ren and anyone else effected by hurricanes you are in our thoughts <br/>
and I&#39;ll go over Kelly&#39;s post again and see what we can do to help.<br/>
<br/>
Ok...I think I need some moral support...I totally believe in what <br/>
I&#39;m doing, but I think today I&#39;m having a bad day...getting up at 6AM <br/>
to help my 11 yo get to school (his choice)...then being with the 20 <br/>
month old all day who is very high energy and always on the go, <br/>
discovering and studying bugs, digging in sand and mud, going for <br/>
walks 10 AM - 10 PM NO NAP and having time to read 2 chapters of <br/>
Series of Unfortunate Events, play games, discuss games, getting <br/>
everyone to swim practice/lessons, and honoring my 8 yo sleep pattern <br/>
of being up late and sleeping late,ETC...I&#39;m sure you all do the <br/>
same :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just today I felt so crabby and out of control...I want to honor <br/>
each of my childrens choices and uniqueness, but I&#39;m feeling <br/>
overwhelmed...no time for me to take a breather...with three kids <br/>
there is always (and always will be) someone who needs or wants <br/>
something from Dawn to the witching hour<br/>
<br/>
I know they will only be young and little for a short time (I am <br/>
realizing this acutely as my &quot;baby&quot; turns 12 next month) and I do <br/>
feel very blessed that at present they are all healthy and I love <br/>
spending time with them...<br/>
<br/>
guess I&#39;m just feeling guilty for being crabby today...how do all of <br/>
you wonderful people cope daily :)<br/>
<br/>
As I said I guess I just need some support.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you Unschooling Goddesses of Divine Wisdom  ~`.*<br/>
