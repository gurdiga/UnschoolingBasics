<div id="ygrps-yiv-528453822">Hello,<br/>
I am new to the list and sort of new to unschooling.  I have 4 children ans have been homeschooling for nine years.  I have never consciously chosen to unschooling before but did fall into with the birth of my babies, illnesses, etc.  We ha e sort of been unschooling for six months this time since my baby was born.  I have only recently considered unschooling as a full-time way of schooling my children.  I was wondering if anyone could give me ideas or suggestions for beginning a full-time unschooling lifestyle?  My children are 11,7, 4 and 6 mos. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Live as though you&#39;re on vacation. :-) Not summer vacation where kids  <br/>
are sent off to play, but all together on vacation. Explore. Do  <br/>
things. Be out of the house. Be in the house doing things too. (TV and  <br/>
video games and exploring the internet is *also* doing.) When they&#39;re  <br/>
engaged step back to awareness and readiness. Strew their lives with  <br/>
interesting things for them to pick up (or not.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple of pages of ideas to get you started:<br/>
