<div id="ygrps-yiv-804512688">From the time stamped on my sent email to the actual posting to the group of posts there has been between a 6 hr and 24 lag in the past 2 days. Is anyone else experiencing this?<br/>
<br/>
I bring it up because, for me, it&#39;s disrupting the flow of the thread and at times makes my posts appear as though repeating something someone else has already said. I just wanted y&#39;all to know I&#39;m not hammering a point, I am at the mercy of the Yahoo servers. ;-)<br/>

&quot;Song for a Fifth Child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mother, oh Mother,<br/>
<br/>
come shake out your cloth,<br/>
<br/>
empty the dustpan,<br/>
<br/>
poison the moth,<br/>
<br/>
hang out the washing<br/>
<br/>
and butter the bread,<br/>
<br/>
sew on a button and make up a bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where is the mother whose house<br/>
<br/>
is so shocking?<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s up in the nursery,<br/>
<br/>
blissfully rocking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve grown shiftless as Little<br/>
<br/>
Boy Blue (lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>
<br/>
(pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).<br/>
<br/>
The shopping&#39;s not done<br/>
<br/>
and there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>
<br/>
and out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo.<br/>
<br/>
Look! Aren&#39;t her eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>
<br/>
(lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cleaning and scrubbing<br/>
<br/>
will wait till tomorrow,<br/>
<br/>
for children grow up,<br/>
<br/>
as I&#39;ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
So quiet down, cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
Dust go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby and babies don&#39;t keep&#39;<br/>

I bring it up because, for me, it&#39;s disrupting the flow of the thread and at<br/>

Everyone still on moderation is experiencing it. &lt;g&gt;   This list has two owners and two moderators.  One owner is unavailable right now and one moderator (me) is only occasionally available.  That leaves two people moderating.   Two people who are also mom&#39;s with big lives and kids who have places to go and people to see. &lt;g.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back to my regular moderating duties after the tenth of April.  I&#39;ll have time then to get some of y&#39;all off moderation and that&#39;ll help the lag.  <br/>
All new members are on moderation until they&#39;ve posted enough that we know they&#39;re weird serial killers or worse, spammers.   New members are taken off moderation as moderators have the time (and remember to do it.) &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is a yahoo thing and there&#39;s not much moderators can do about that but lately, here, it&#39;s a scheduling thing. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, everyone,  for the inconvenience, we&#39;re working on it!   <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s ok to post a response similar to what someone else already posted.  The reason these lists are good sources of information is because so many people can respond.  Your style may be just exactly what appeals and makes sense to someone, even if you&#39;re posting essentially the same thing as the previous poster.   That&#39;s why we&#39;re here. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419958055">Yes, I am having the same difficulty with my posts for groups I use regularly with no moderation.  I am receiving things one or two days late or not at all and have emailed yahoo but have no reply yet.  Its not just you.  I have been having to go to the websites to read messages in order and see what I missed. - Robin<br/>

<br/>
There was a not in my head when I wrote that -it never made it to the screen.    <br/>
<br/>
We take members off moderation when we know they&#39;re *not* weird serial killers.    Members who are weird serial killers will remain on moderation until they kill all the moderators.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears things up.<br/>
