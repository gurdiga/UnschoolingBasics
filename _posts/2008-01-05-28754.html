<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221427898">I have recently discovered a wonderful hairbrush that I use on my<br/>
curly long haired boy.  Its very gentle.  Much more gentle than even<br/>
my careful finger combing with conditioner which he always says<br/>
ouch no matter how careful I am.  He never says ouch with this<br/>
brush and will in fact try to use it himself.  The brand name is <br/>
Bass and the number on it is 876SB.  100% wild boar/ soft.  I <br/>
had the stomach flu a last week and my hair was a wild matted<br/>
mess and my dd brushed my hair for me and it never once hurt<br/>
as she detangled it!  I think it cost about $12.  Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907159063">There are many questions here.<br/>
Does he want his hair long?<br/>
Does he mind it is tangled?<br/>
You can have him in dreads. You can untangle with your hands ( just gently pull apart the hair) Tkes a logn time and patience but works great.<br/>
He might decide he just wnats it shaved off. No hair to deal with. just and inch of fur.<br/>
He might like to use a braid or pony tail to keep hair from getiting matted.<br/>
As for washing my ds is the same way but he does eventually let me wash it. I am just super careful not to get his face wet.<br/>
He did go longs times without washing and his hair still felt and smelled wonderful ( as much as 4-6 weeks)<br/>
You can use self rinse shamppos ( no water needed) <br/>
You can use a little spray with conditioner or essencial oils and water to help demmatt and clean if needed.<br/>
Even corn starch and baking soda can be used to keep hair clean I heard.<br/>
My ds did not need anything as his hair really never got dirty or tangled ( very sliky).<br/>
As for dad you need to talk to him.<br/>
Remind him of all the manly man that has long hair and that it is a self expression he needs to respect.<br/>
So many big, strong maly guys have long hair.<br/>
Bullying his son will most likely erode the little boy&#39;s self steem and their relationship.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m going to answer in sections, ok? Thanks so much! <br/>
<br/>
There  are many questions here.<br/>
Does he want his hair long?<br/>
Yes, he does. Papa has long hair too - to his waist, in fact. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does  he mind it is tangled?<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure. I think he cares very little. But he clearly cares  what <br/>
Papa thinks and what others say to him. It&#39;s myself and my dad that (and  his <br/>
wife) that say next to nothing, usually nothing. His big brother and  <br/>
sisters, Papa, my mom and his Tios tease him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You  can have him in dreads. <br/>
It&#39;s kinda like one, single dread now :)<br/>
<br/>
You can  untangle with your hands ( just gently pull apart the hair) Tkes a <br/>
logn time  and patience but works great.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried a bit, but will try more. He&#39;s VERY head sensitive, and now fear  <br/>
is adding to it - adrenaline, anxiety over it. So now, the emotional aspects <br/>
are  equally as painful as the physical. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He  might decide he just wants it shaved off. No hair to deal with. just and <br/>
inch  of fur.<br/>
He&#39;s scared silly of that idea. Change is not cool with Mr. Julian right  now <br/>
- I *think* he thinks he won&#39;t be HIM anymore, so as for now, that&#39;s not an  <br/>
option. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He  might like to use a braid or pony tail to keep hair from getting  matted.<br/>
Tried that, but the brushing it took to get the braid or pony in was so  hard <br/>
for him, this is now the result. Power struggles are HORRID and that&#39;s what  <br/>
seems to be happening over and over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As  for washing my ds is the same way but he does eventually let me wash it. <br/>
I am  just super careful not to get his face wet.<br/>
We&#39;ve tried so many ways to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s his fear of  <br/>
it happening that seems to be the worst part. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He  did go longs times without washing and his hair still felt and smelled  <br/>
wonderful ( as much as 4-6 weeks)<br/>
We&#39;ve done that too, but it didn&#39;t smell &quot;wonderful.&quot; Not bad though  either. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You  can use self rinse shamppos ( no water needed) <br/>
THAT sounds GREAT! Where are they??? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You  can use a little spray with conditioner or essencial oils and water to <br/>
help  demmatt and clean if needed.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of a product called Dread Remover - it&#39;s just costly, and  since <br/>
it&#39;s not Julian&#39;s desire, I wonder if it should be bought or not, kwim? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even  corn starch and baking soda can be used to keep hair clean I  heard.<br/>
Great ideas! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My  ds did not need anything as his hair really never got dirty or tangled ( <br/>
very  sliky).<br/>
As for dad you need to talk to him.<br/>
Remind him of all the manly  man that has long hair and that it is a self <br/>
expression he needs to  respect.<br/>
So many big, strong maly guys have long hair.<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s what appears to be dirty hair. It&#39;s about  <br/>
how people perceive him as a dad, me as a mom. I&#39;m 100% sure that&#39;s the issue  <br/>
(as I said before, Papa has long hair, black and to his waist - he&#39;s Mexican <br/>
and  it&#39;s just dashing...and having Mexican/Caucasian hair seems to be an issue <br/>
too -  the textures are here and there, but not well combined - seems a few <br/>
other  &quot;halo-halo&quot; kids I know have the same issue with it - Mexican-Cauc. that <br/>
 is)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bullying his son will most likely erode the little boy&#39;s self steem  and <br/>
their relationship.<br/>
I know. Sigh. Papa is not an unschooler, but is trying in many ways to come  <br/>
around. I&#39;m trying by showing, but I have become quite...erm...bitchy. Juan is <br/>
 an authoritarian style parent, we have cultural differences, Unschooling is  <br/>
terrifying to him I think in some ways (yet other ways, he&#39;s all easy going,  <br/>
like video games, TV, all media). So all of that seems to be literally, <br/>
wrapped  up in Julian&#39;s hair. Perhaps I should get India.Arie&#39;s song, &quot;I&#39;m Not My <br/>
Hair&quot;  as a mantra for Julian to proclaim :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alex<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, Alex. Maybe I just need to mull this all over and practice  following <br/>
my heart. Juan and I NEVER get any time alone to talk, and in fact,  our <br/>
marriage is in a shambles right now :(  Our parenting differences and  the <br/>
resulting tension has bled into our other aspects, too. It&#39;s all related, I  know. <br/>
And the hair is almost a manifestation of it...I hate this. Struggling a  LOT <br/>
these days. Your advice and help is really appreciated. Thanks again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452198526">Hi Karen,<br/>
 I am Latina also. Actually I am from Brazil. My mom&#39;s side is French/German and my father Portuguese?Dutch .<br/>
Having lived nad travelled in South America I undertand the difference in culture you are facing even thou my DH says I am americanized LOL.<br/>
 I know lots of couples that are american/latino.<br/>
Anyways <br/>
The self rinse shamppoo I am used is actually sold for dog shows but I heard they have fo people. Myabe Google it. I have used the dog version many times and it works really good but maybe a lttle drying so I would definetely use a leave in conditoner after.<br/>
Dh and I also don&#39;t have many opportunities to talk alone ( I don&#39;t remeber last time we did). I used to be bicthy to my ds too.<br/>
Since I started Unschooling out relationship things have gotten a lot better.<br/>
I still have to work since I can become a dictator and apin in the a@@ with him. But if I just stop, take a deeep breath and refrase what I am about to say then he is much more open to what I have to say.<br/>
I also realize my DH was far from mindfully parented and very damaged in school.  He  is like a child that never had his real needs met. I need to treat him like I do my kids. How can he be something if he was never treated respectfully as a kid.<br/>
Unschooling and accepting him has been key to our relationship.<br/>
GTG for now,<br/>

One more  question.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
USUALLY, I tell the person that it&#39;s just hair and all things change and  <br/>
it&#39;s fine for now. But sometimes I say that I know it&#39;s a bit difficult and  <br/>
we&#39;ll be taking care of it soon (which leads to The Conversation with Julian of  <br/>
course - which is sometimes just calm and fine and other times, a Battle of  <br/>
Wills - when hunger, tiredness, depression, frustration and all that stuff are  <br/>
overlapping) and other times, the least often, I just laugh it off and wrap it <br/>
 up with a nod and a smile. <br/>
 <br/>
I received the other email and I&#39;m googling the no rinse as we speak! <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for that and for the multicultural support and acknowledgment too  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969546502">Have you tried letting him wear swimming goggles or a diver&#39;s mask?  Even <br/>
with a snorkel?<br/>
<br/>
Is he afraid of water in general?<br/>
<br/>
When mine were young we had a big container of bath toys and some bath&#39;s <br/>
were a &#39;play tubby&#39; where they could play to their heart&#39;s contents.  I&#39;d <br/>
add warm water every half hour or so as needed.  I had some fun-shaped <br/>
soaps that they would play with and once in while we got a bar that had a <br/>
toy at the core, so as they used it the toy emerged.  I made sure the water <br/>
was not deep enough to go over their ears so their faces stayed dry and I <br/>
told them how much I enjoyed lying back in the tub as a boy, and pushing <br/>
myself up and down the rub with my hands and feet, making waves. Eventually <br/>
they loved to lie back in the tub and let their hair float, and if I stayed <br/>
away and didn&#39;t try to wash it, so they always felt in control, it got <br/>
pretty clean.  Their fear was a control issue; having someone else wash <br/>
their hair took control away from them, made them feel powerless and at <br/>
another&#39;s mercy.  For some this is not a trust issue. or a feeling unsafe <br/>
with a particular person issue. It&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>
<br/>
Brushing/de-tangling is another story.  I used a ton of no-more-tangles on <br/>
my daughters&#39; hair, but it still hurt them.  I have a very sensitive head <br/>
also.  One thing that might help relax him is to begin giving him gentle <br/>
scalp massages, very gentle.  A very sensitive head really appreciates a <br/>
gentle scalp massage.  No brushing or combing, just the <br/>
massage.  Eventually he may let you use a brush on just then ends at first.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Dad&#39;s attitude goes, while I understand his feelings, I hope he <br/>
can realize that the opinions of others mean nothing, and only have the <br/>
power we assign to them.  My oldest is 35 now.  When he was 4 he had the <br/>
most beautiful head of chestnut banana curls you&#39;ve ever seen, and we got <br/>
plenty of looks and comments about his &#39;girly&#39; hair from strangers and <br/>
family alike.  But I haven&#39;t thought of that since then, until now.  It <br/>
means nothing at all to me.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;as quickly - this happens only every week or so, MAX, due to his fears and<br/>
&gt;sensitivities to water and brushes/combs (he also is slightly SPD and I KNOW<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s part of this). I talk to him gently, help him try and cope with his<br/>
&gt;fears...but get so much pressure from others...I just don&#39;t know what to <br/>
&gt;do. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;a huge issue in the house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I can cope with bluntness, ok? In fact, I WANT it. My gut says &quot;let it<br/>
&gt;go, he&#39;s ready when he&#39;s ready&quot; but part of me is the Old Me that says it<br/>
&gt;&quot;must&quot; be dealt with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Karen<br/>

&gt;the advice was helpful for untangling, it wasn&#39;t RU in any way, really)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053233865">I don&#39;t know if it will help but my 5 y/o very sensitive boy has very<br/>
long hair. He really doesn&#39;t like to wash/condition/brush it but likes<br/>
it &quot;smooth&quot; (his word). So when it gets yucky we do the &quot;beauty<br/>
parlor&quot;. We get all the stuff together and have a bath just for hair<br/>
care. We bring in his favorite (at the moment) dvd and watch it while<br/>
I gently do his hair. Watching the dvd has really helped. Somedays he<br/>
will brush his hair on his own in front of the tv<br/>

I think it&#39;s getting easier. When Juan is happy, he has WAY less &quot;issues&quot;  <br/>

comes out in various ways. <br/>

I think between the hairbrush (the Bass one) and the waterless shampoo, we  <br/>

I have worked with show dogs all my like and grooming show dogs and pets and that is a way to get some really bad matted hair taken care of. Than continue to work with your hand separating the hair.<br/>
I wish you were close so I could show it to you.<br/>

Even better: use thinning shears rather than regular shears/scissors. <br/>
Takes less hair off and looks more natural.<br/>
<br/>
Just wiggle the shears down close to the scalp and take a tiny snip <br/>
left, right, and center. Then work with the hairs to pull them apart.<br/>

Kelly, what are thinning shears? Are they easily bought?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Any dog grooming supply catalogue has them! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They look like scissors, with one side flat and one side &quot;toothed.&quot; <br/>
They take off less hair than regular scissors, &quot;thinning&quot; rather than <br/>
cutting bluntly---it&#39;s how the &quot;shag&quot; haircut was born! &lt;G&gt; So when you <br/>
cut, some hair gets cut off by the teeth, other hairs slide in a <br/>
protected area and don&#39;t get touched by the sharp parts of the shears.<br/>
<br/>
All barbers use them, and I think all hair stylists have a pair---even <br/>
if they don&#39;t use them regularly. So look at Sally&#39;s Beauty Supply or <br/>
some such place.<br/>
<br/>
The finer the tooth, the more hair that is cut and the finer the <br/>
finished look, so a coarser toothed shear would work better for what <br/>
you need.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&q=thinning+shears&um=1&ie=UTF-8">http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&q=thinning+shears&um=1&ie=UTF-8</a><br/>
<br/>
I just googled &quot;thinning shears&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can pay $4.00 for a major cheap pair that will probably do what you <br/>
need them to do---all the way up to hundreds of dollars.<br/>
<br/>
For $20-30.00 you can get a very serviceable pair that will last you <br/>
for years. (You could also ask a groomer friend if you could borrow a <br/>
pair for a night! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
