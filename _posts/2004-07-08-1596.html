<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905920373">&quot;&quot;What a lot of us here have found, is you don&#39;t need either the passive/do <br/>
nothing or the disciplinarian approach. There is a middle ground. One where <br/>
children ARE treated with equal respect as adults, but where the parent also <br/>
cares about themselves and is capable of setting healthy boundaries.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~Great! How do I do that?~<br/>
<br/>
By deciding to not force people against their will unless it is truly necessary (to prevent bodily harm or something). To treat them with the same respect you&#39;d give an adult (that doesn&#39;t mean treat them like and adult, but respect them equally). It means do a lot of nice things for them, like pick up their dishes or laundry and smile...by joyful instead of resentful, they will pick up on that aura of joy!<br/>
<br/>
Children WANT to be part of the adult world, unless they&#39;ve learned that adults are the enemy. We must be their partners. I am here to help my children get what they want/need in life, while talking to them (only when necessary) about my own feelings, budget, time constraints..whatever.<br/>
<br/>
They are my companions, not my servants that need to obey my every whim. If there is something I feel strongly about, I explain why, my children are very empathetic and helpful. But this atmosphere did not come about on it&#39;s own. We had to leave punishments behind forever. We had to prove that we were interested in their world completely. I do not request things that would take them from something interesting unless it&#39;s really of ultimate importance.<br/>
<br/>
If you fill them up with joy and kindness, they have enough to share back. If we fill them up with resentment and coercion, they&#39;ll use those same tools on us. I think one of the most disturbing things about being a parent, is seeing ME reflected back in how my children talk and act. My sarcastic remarks started coming back to me. My resentment of household chores was evident in their avoidance. Now that I have learned to be joyful about daily life, to breathe deep when struggles arise, I notice helpful, happy people at my side, concerned for my well being.<br/>
It works. But we, as the parents, must make the biggest, most difficult changes for it to work.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I can&#39;t recommend the book &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; enough. It&#39;s that balance you&#39;re looking for I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697315361">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just needed to share something my dd (4) did with people who would<br/>
appreciate it:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other day at a birthday party she got 5 felt whales in her gift bag, so<br/>
of course we had to go out this week and buy the makings for a felt board<br/>
and to make the ocean and a bunch of other creatures. So we came home, she<br/>
told me what she wanted to have. I struggled with my minimal artistic skills<br/>
to draw and then cut out the pieces for her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She said she wanted a bunch of fish, and so we made them. when her dad came<br/>
home she showed him her fish and I called it a school of fish. She looked at<br/>
me and said &quot;no mommy home-schooled fish!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We had a good laugh and I felt so proud that she is embracing this so<br/>
wholeheartedly,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339398353">That was cute!!!<br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>
