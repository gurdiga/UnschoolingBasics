<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391274997">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am a new member and have not posted yet so I would like to introduce<br/>
myself for a bit.  My name is Angela.  I am Mom to three children ages 11, 9<br/>
and 4.<br/>
<br/>
We are lucky enough to live in St. Louis where the Live and Learn conference<br/>
was this past year.  It was such a joy to have been able to attend.  I was<br/>
not on any unschooling lists until the conference.<br/>
<br/>
 We have homeschooled since the beginning.  I had read most of the books<br/>
that everyone seems to recommend and my heart was there for years.   We<br/>
unschooled for a few years until I became very insecure in my decision.  All<br/>
of the homeschoolers that I seemed to meet around town were &quot;school at<br/>
homers&quot; so I wavered in my decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, my heart was there but my head was still stuck in school.  I<br/>
guess that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t much of a stretch for me to waver and start<br/>
school at home.<br/>
<br/>
So here we are now,  Post conference.  Thankful for it all.  We are already<br/>
planning on going to New Mexico next year.  I have never traveled on a long<br/>
vacation to the West.  It has always been to the East to visit family.  This<br/>
will be quit a change for us but it should be an awesome time!  We are<br/>
excited already and looking for fun things to do on the way.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly mentioned the conference CD&#39;s a while back.  If you didn&#39;t get  the<br/>
chance to attend you really should get them.  But even if you attended like<br/>
I did they will be good to listen to again.  We listened to our  MP3 on a 14<br/>
hour car trip and it was so wonderful.  We got to hear the sessions that we<br/>
somehow missed that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra and Ren&#39;s session on Mindful Parenting was so great.  It seemed to<br/>
have come at just the right time (driving home from a week visiting my Mom)<br/>
and I am really thankful for that one.  Thank you , Ren, for that.  And<br/>
Sandra, too, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much Joy!<br/>
Angela<br/>
