I think this is probably the best thing I&#39;ve read so far.  I see that I have<br/>
several areas where I can improve and if I try to tackle them all at once, I<br/>
know I will fail at all of them.  I will start with food, then this summer I<br/>
will move to sleep.<br/>

I personally think that&#39;s a good idea considering your oldest is in school. <br/>
There ARE reasons for her to sleep at a regular time because of that.<br/>
From your description of night/nap routines, it sounds to me as though that s <br/>
a pretty gentle way of helping them. Sometimes it is suggested that we talk <br/>
to our kids while we are doing these routines so that they can hear their <br/>
feelings being put into words. &quot;Sometimes feeling cranky like this means that our <br/>
bodies are telling us we need some down time. How about we go read our books <br/>
and if we feel like it we can close our eyes.&quot;<br/>
Wwhen you yourself are feeling  cranky because you are tired, acknowledge <br/>
that out loud, that helps them to see how others handle feeling tired. &quot;Oops, I <br/>
wan&#39;t very nice just now, I&#39;m cranky because I&#39;m feeling sleepy. I&#39;ll go lay <br/>
down for a few minutes and I bet that&#39;ll help.&quot;<br/>

I think there is a difference between routine and absolute rules<br/>
YES! There is a WORLD of difference between:<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s time for bed because it is 8:00 and that&#39;s when children should go to <br/>
sleep&quot; <br/>
and<br/>
&quot;we&#39;ve had a long day, the kids are fighting with each other and rubbing <br/>
their eyes. I think I&#39;ll turn the lights down and snuggle up on the couch with a <br/>
good story of watch that great Raffi tape with them under some throws.&quot;<br/>
