would  you call not letting your kid <br/>
to run in the street (dangerous), draw on  your antique table <br/>
(destructive) or screaming while you are on the phone  (disruptive) <br/>
limits or what????<br/>
-<br/>
Limits? What do I care what anyone calls them? <br/>
<br/>
My kids were taught how to safely cross a street, which at a wee age involved <br/>
NOT crossing the street, Mom or Dad holding a hand, etc. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any furniture that would qualify as antique :) -- but the kids <br/>
have been taught that things cost money and if they break something, it&#39;s <br/>
likely not to get replaced. Just reality around here. This translates to &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
fiddle with the car door windows because goodness only knows what is holding the <br/>
thing together at this point and it&#39;s 90+ degrees out and if you break the <br/>
electric window, you will be hot.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m on the phone, and a kid comes up to me to talk (which always seems to <br/>
happen) I point at the phone and say it is important, or somesuch, if it is -- <br/>
sometimes phone calls are more important than &quot;Hey, Mom, look at this cool <br/>
thing I drew.&quot; If the house was on fire or the kid was injured, the phone call <br/>
would not be as important. <br/>
<br/>
Just life, imo. Which has limits but doesn&#39;t have to have more than <br/>
necessary. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560914907">~~I was reading the posts about setting limits etc and have a<br/>
question. Are there no limit setting in unschooling? ~~<br/>
<br/>
Sure there are. <br/>
Every family decides that for themselves. What we discuss here are<br/>
ways to meet the underlying needs of a child, without controlling<br/>
their choices.<br/>
<br/>
Just now I had a real-life limit come up. We just installed a lovely<br/>
Mayan handwoven hammock swing here in the basement. Jalen was climbing<br/>
up onto the wooden bar (that the hammock hangs from) and hanging<br/>
upside down and doing other stunts. I stopped him. It&#39;s right over<br/>
concrete and it&#39;s about 6 feet off the floor! I&#39;m not really willing<br/>
to trust his 6y.o. flipping ability enough to find out if his head<br/>
will crack when it hits concrete.:)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, after explaining why I wasn&#39;t ok with the activity, I offered a<br/>
few other choices......<br/>
~buy a special bar just for flipping from, with a mat under it<br/>
~buy a mat for under the chair, for flipping time<br/>
~put a bar outside over soft ground (dh&#39;s idea)<br/>
~or???  I asked if he had any ideas for making it safe.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t care anymore. He had moved on to other activities.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, dh and I now know he will want to hang and flip from the bar. We<br/>
can meet the underlying need and keep him safe (and keep me from<br/>
having a heart attack at the same time;) all at once. Rather than<br/>
limiting him, we can expand his world. Now he&#39;ll have a hammock swing<br/>
to be snugged up in AND a bar for hanging from. <br/>
<br/>
The limit is only in the moment....it&#39;s a lot easier to meet needs,<br/>
than to constantly try to stop someone from doing what they want.<br/>

<br/>
I joined this particular list recently after yakking with Kelly at the LIFE<br/>
is Good conference.  I&#39;m catching up on posts because my computer&#39;s been<br/>
crashing, but it seems to be giving me a small window of opportunity right<br/>
now.  So, I&#39;ll take that to say &quot;Hi Sylvia&quot; before I carry on.<br/>
