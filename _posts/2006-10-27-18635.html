*******************<br/>
they are throwing play dough. they won&#39;t stop. I will ask them not to and<br/>
they will do it right in front of me. I left them in the art room and they<br/>
are still throwing I can hear it and hear them screaming with laughter as<br/>
they do it. They are 9 yob, 6 yob and 3 yog. It is mainly the 9 yo. He is my<br/>
wild playful one. The others are learning from him. I am trying so hard to<br/>
be a gentle parent who doesn&#39;t hit or punish or even yell. I have already<br/>
lost my temper over this with both boys. So I came up to write this while<br/>
they continue. They may be throwing something else by now. My 9 yo has been<br/>
a thrower ever since he could. I can feel myself ready to snap so I am not<br/>
going down there.<br/>
he has plenty of acceptable things to throw. balls, stuffed animals. I can<br/>
hear them wrecking things down there. I am the annon poster from a few<br/>
months ago who was trying to decide if my oldest should go to school or not.<br/>
Well he chose to go. I hate having him go though I have supported him. He<br/>
was only going to go for a month, dh talked him into going til halloween. So<br/>
Weds is his first report card. He isn&#39;t sure if he wants to keep going or<br/>
not. He likes school. But I have already had a formal meeting with teacher,<br/>
principal, school psychologist and others. He doesn&#39;t pay attention. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t focus. He doesn&#39;t retain what he&#39;s read. blah blah blah. I want him<br/>
home and he knows that. Yes it will be a challenge having him home. Like<br/>
right now when I would like to send him to a 24 hour care facility for &quot;bad<br/>
boys&quot;. The home and the other children are calm and peaceful when he is not<br/>
home. I still want him home. Dh doesn&#39;t. I would really like to tell my son<br/>
that I will make the decision for him and keep him home. Except for moments<br/>
like this when I want to order child-size straight jackets. &lt;g&gt; How do you<br/>
all keep your sanity????<br/>
When I go next week to meet with the teacher and get his report card, and<br/>
she tells me he is failing this and failing that etc, I know I am going to<br/>
say, ds, you are not going back. I hate all that pass/fail grading bs. But<br/>
if he is home 24/7 I may have to order a straight jacket for myself. And ear<br/>
plugs! Somebody help and tell me some of the wonderful ideas you have for<br/>
me!<br/>
As background, he went to public school for the first time last march, april<br/>
and may, then chose to go this sept and oct. he had never been in ps before<br/>
and he is in 3rd grade. I also have an 11 month old baby. Thank you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450012749">I&#39;m sorry things are so tough.  Hugs, and I will say a prayer for you.  I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will have much better advice.  But I will put my two cents worth in.  I also have days that the WILD, OUT OF CONTROL BEHAVIOR, just grates on me and wears me down.  My six year old has possible AS and SPD.  She is just so wild, and she can keep up the wild and hyper for hours.  Yesterday she shoved her sister against a window.......not because she was mad at her but because she was just goofing off and being wild. And I&#39;m still trying to figure it all out myself.  But so far the only thing that I have found that has worked is to separate my children.   I realize that does not solve your whole picture, but there are just times I put one kid on one floor of my house and another kid on the other floor and tell them they just can not be together right now.  So far it is working really well.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454808074"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; they are throwing play dough. they won&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it turned from a practical suggestion to avoid getting play  <br/>
dough into the carpet into a power struggle to make them do what  <br/>
you&#39;ve told them to do.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to go into more detail about why you were right in  <br/>
this case. There are, of course, times when we might need to dip into  <br/>
our emergency bag and just say &quot;No, stop,&quot; because what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
is dangerous or destructive and we can&#39;t at the moment think of a  <br/>
better way. But the less they hear no, the more likely they are to  <br/>
listen when we really need them to.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most common source of parenting frustration is trying to  <br/>
control kids, make them behave, make them act right, stop them from  <br/>
making our lives more difficult. If you set your life&#39;s goal as  <br/>
herding cats, think what a life of frustration it would be. If you  <br/>
set you life&#39;s goal as enjoying who the cats are, life for all of you  <br/>
would be more pleasant. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids *are* messy. And loud. And autonomous beings with needs that are  <br/>
inconvenient to a relaxing life. The sooner we accept that, the  <br/>
easier it is to start letting go and stop trying to make our lives  <br/>
into some sitcom image we have in our heads of kids that are snarky  <br/>
for 26 minutes and 30 seconds until they see how right their parents  <br/>
are in the last 30 seconds so the credits can roll ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying to get some renewal in your life by trying to  <br/>
control your family into giving it to you, it could be you need to  <br/>
get away and do something just for yourself for an hour or so a week.  <br/>
Ask your husband to watch them so you can go to Borders and read for  <br/>
a while, or take a bath, or go for a walk. It&#39;s really hard to give  <br/>
when we&#39;re tapped out ourselves, but it doesn&#39;t work to try to get  <br/>
the kids to give us the peace we need.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m throwing out a lot of ideas here and some or all may be missing  <br/>
the mark. There isn&#39;t much to go on, but this play dough incident  <br/>
sounds like a last straw issue. So I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s a whole lot  <br/>
more than play dough going on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I will ask them not to and<br/>
&gt; they will do it right in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There might be a number of reasons for this:<br/>
<br/>
It could be that your automatic response is &quot;No,&quot; so the word has  <br/>
lost its meaning. It may not feel to you like you say no a lot, but  <br/>
they&#39;re reacting and responding based on *their* perception, not yours.<br/>
<br/>
It could be that your requests *FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW* make no sense.<br/>
<br/>
 From their point of view, whatever issue that has your panties in a  <br/>
knot is not high on their priority list. It may be play dough in the  <br/>
carpet. Or play dough bits going everywhere that you&#39;re envisioning  <br/>
having to clean up. Or waste. Or whatever. It doesn&#39;t make a  <br/>
difference. From *their* point of view they&#39;d rather have no carpet,  <br/>
or a dough-mud-paint splattered play place, or whatever it is that&#39;s  <br/>
blocking them from being free to play. From *their* point of view,  <br/>
your actions say &quot;I don&#39;t care what you want. This is what I want and  <br/>
what I want is important so you need to stop making it so difficult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. It means your  <br/>
visions of life are clashing. As the one who decided to bring them  <br/>
into the world, you&#39;re the one who needs to figure out how to fit  <br/>
your goals around their goals.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re ignoring you to deliberately do what you&#39;ve asked them not  <br/>
to do, then there&#39;s something more going on than not listening. And  <br/>
you&#39;ll need to do some serious self-examination. See the world  <br/>
through their eyes rather than seeing them as deliberately defiant.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will help: One of your goals is to create a home for your  <br/>
family. Their goal is to play. Your goals are clashing. But as a  <br/>
mindful parent your goal is to get those *goals* to mesh and work  <br/>
together *not* get your kids to mesh with your goals.<br/>
<br/>
Right now their perception is that your goal is to make life more  <br/>
convenient and less difficult for you. And your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; are oriented  <br/>
towards that goal. But since your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; are interfering with their  <br/>
goals, and you apparently don&#39;t care about what they want, they are  <br/>
showing you the same lack of caring about your goals and wants.  <br/>
They&#39;re learning by example to treat others&#39; needs and wants as less  <br/>
important than their own. They&#39;re learning they need to fight to get  <br/>
what they want because you&#39;re their adversary.<br/>
<br/>
Now it may *feel* like you give and give and give so you have the  <br/>
right to draw the line. But from their point of view, they know  <br/>
everything the want to do is in your power to grant or deny. Imagine  <br/>
living with a husband who, though generous, could use his power to  <br/>
tell you when to go to bed, when to get up, when and what to eat,  <br/>
what and how much to watch on TV, whether or not you could go to the  <br/>
store and how much you could spend, and required a convincing  <br/>
explanation that met his needs for you when you wanted to buy  <br/>
something for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s exhausting just thinking of living life like that. And yet  <br/>
that&#39;s how conventionally parented kids live. And the harsher it is,  <br/>
the sooner they want to leave home.<br/>
<br/>
To get back on the mindful parenting track, you need to create  <br/>
confidence in them that your goal is to help them get what they want.  <br/>
That&#39;s your top priority. You may not always be able to forge a  <br/>
direct path, you may have to find a different -- and better :-) --  <br/>
option than the one they&#39;re asking for or put something off until the  <br/>
next day -- and then move the earth to make it happen the next day  <br/>
until they&#39;re rock solid certain that their needs *are* at the top of  <br/>
your list. But you want to work towards a certainty that you&#39;re their  <br/>
partner and advocate rather than their adversary.<br/>
<br/>
*Then* when they&#39;re confident that you&#39;re trying to help them, *then*  <br/>
they&#39;ll be willing to work with you rather than against you. Right  <br/>
now it sounds like they&#39;re fighting against you to get what they want  <br/>
because you&#39;re adversaries, each trying to be the one to get to your  <br/>
respective goals. They know you hold the power to grant or deny. And  <br/>
they need to fight to get what they want. Stop the struggle. Be their  <br/>
partner. And they&#39;ll be yours. (It will take time though! You can&#39;t  <br/>
be their partner with the idea to make them yours. It has to be a  <br/>
free gift because that&#39;s what you want to give.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I left them in the art room and they<br/>
&gt; are still throwing I can hear it and hear them screaming with  <br/>
&gt; laughter as<br/>
&gt; they do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s a choice between laughter and tears, which would you choose?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what it feels like is that they&#39;re laughing at you. It  <br/>
perhaps feels sort of mocking when they&#39;re laughing and having a good  <br/>
time doing something you&#39;ve asked them not to.<br/>
<br/>
Turn your view point around. They&#39;re laughing because they&#39;re happy  <br/>
and having fun. And you&#39;re trying to be, what someone called, the fun  <br/>
police. And it makes you angry that they&#39;re having fun (and you&#39;re  <br/>
not.) There&#39;s often a bit of jealousy in parents that their kids  <br/>
*can* be so free of care and responsibility. (Not &quot;have to&quot; pick up  <br/>
all that play dough.) The thing is that when we were kids it was  <br/>
implied that when we were adults it would be our turn to get what we  <br/>
wanted. But when we got to be adults and took on responsibilities  <br/>
(and filled our heads full of &quot;have tos&quot; and &quot;can&#39;ts&quot;) we realized  <br/>
that was a big fat lie. And we&#39;re unconsciously resentful. We&#39;ve got  <br/>
this voice in the backs of our heads that says &quot;When&#39;s it going to be  <br/>
my turn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But we *can* get what we want. It just isn&#39;t going to look like we  <br/>
thought it would and we need to go about it differently than stealing  <br/>
it from our kids the way our parents may have stolen their turns from  <br/>
us.<br/>

  I thought this might be of interest to all of you Harry Potter fans (and also budding novelists!)....My kids and I just watched this segment of 60 minutes with JK Rowling....It was inspirational and funny and I think that her filing system resembles my own!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075556547">well all the replies helped....and I realized that its ok to throw <br/>
playdough....who&#39;d have thought?  after all he was down in the art room <br/>
where the floor is tiled and making a mess is ok.  I took all the little <br/>
containers of craft supplies and moved them so they wouldn&#39;t be knocked all <br/>
over the place and told him to go ahead and throw all he wanted. he said, <br/>
you mean I can throw it?  I said, well you were doing it anyway when I said <br/>
not to, so go ahead!  maybe at times I am too uptight.  last night I didn&#39;t <br/>
say a word when my boys were running threw the house shooting and throwing <br/>
play knives at each other and then winding yard all around the house.  they <br/>
had a blast.  fortunately dh stayed upstairs and so he didn&#39;t get all <br/>
annoyed.  I am really trying to implement the RU lifestyle here as best I <br/>
can.  Yet I still find myself saying No without even thinking or asking <br/>
myself why not?  so I am working on it.  there is so much for me to learn! <br/>
so many things to let go of!  this list is helping me tremendously though.<br/>
<br/>
And as for the unschooling part of RU I am still working on that too.  dh <br/>
is not on board with un-schooling. I can&#39;t say I am totally sure of it <br/>
either.  I do like to teach them things, when I have time which seems like <br/>
never.  But I am not sure if I know how to unschool them but at the same <br/>
time not neglect them.  This morning my oldest stayed home from school <br/>
(long story, I thought he was getting his report card last night but I was <br/>
a week off and we were waiting for that before making the decision to pull <br/>
him out.....he will go a few more days....) and I went down and spent about <br/>
an hour helping him finally finish building the megabloks ninja turtles <br/>
house that he got last Christmas.  Plus I played ball with him some in the <br/>
afternoon.  And he did a little of his home work. But other than that I <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything one on one with him.  Is that enough? Plus I haven&#39;t <br/>
done a thing wrt teaching my 6 yo (k) to read or math or anything since the <br/>
school year began.  But he is always very busy playing etc.  And I do <br/>
usually read to the 6 and 3 yo at bed time.  Is that enough for now? (also <br/>
have a baby to keep me busy).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps waiting for the piece of paper gives a sense of completion...a sense of &quot;I succeeded at this&quot; rather than &quot;I didnt make it.&quot;  I gave my daughter the option of quitting school in January or February, but as miserable as she was she insisted on finishing the eighth grade because she &quot;didnt want to be a quitter,&quot; and didnt want to &quot;feel like a failure&quot;  because she couldnt hack eighth grade. Her grades were dropping to record lows because she could not stand the meaninglessness of the work, but it was still important for her to demonstrate to others that her decision to unschool high school was by choice, not because she was an &quot;academic failure.&quot; I know these are all very schoolish notions, but the reality is she was in the system for a long time and it will take her a long time to deschool. I just honored her wishes. She is probably older than the child who is the subject of the above post so perhaps circumstances are different, but I thought I would add my two cents for any<br/>
one in a similiar situation.<br/>

I am still trying to figure it all out, and realize it&#39;s a journey........it won&#39;t just all fall into place overnight.   I think playing blocks and then playing ball with your son is wonderful.  As for the six year old playing........well I&#39;ve got a six year old upstairs playing her leapster right now.  She is not as interested as my 8 year old in reading, writing in a journal, math, etc.  But that&#39;s o.k.  We are still de-schooling (the kids and myself) and she will find her own way.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476552871">Thanks Kelly....I said that to myself the whole time he was 5....well he&#39;s <br/>
only 5....he should be playing all day.....and then when he turned 6 in <br/>
Sept the guilt has started to set in....I should be doing this with <br/>
him....we haven&#39;t touched the math book yet....etc. because 99% or more of <br/>
the people around here send their kids to school....and he would be in <br/>
kinder if I had sent him, which is full day (ick).  and people here do that <br/>
even though the law says kids don&#39;t have to go to school til they are 8! <br/>
most people don&#39;t even know that.  it boggles my mind. so I am trying to <br/>
let go of these schoolish notions and the guilt and when my mom calls I <br/>
just say, the kids are fine and try not to talk about it. the guilt is big <br/>
though.  big. I need to let it go and let the kids play.<br/>
