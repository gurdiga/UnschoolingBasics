It&#39;s  appropriate and right for many <br/>
people all over the world. Lots and lots of  kids are still nursing at <br/>
three years old and I know some who nursed until  six or seven.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My oldest nursed until the day before he turned 5 years old, and my  youngest <br/>
nursed until one month before he turned 8 years old.  Neither one  of them <br/>
stopped for any amount of time and then wanted to go back, so I can&#39;t  answer as <br/>
to how I would feel.  I can say I think it would be OK with  me.  I have <br/>
heard of children wanting that when they were tired or sick or  in a new <br/>
environment etc, for comfort.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my experience,<br/>
