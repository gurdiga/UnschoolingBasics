<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040692674">&quot;If so, how do you use these in an unschooly way? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I opened one and skimmed through, laughed loudly and stuck it<br/>
back on the shelf!!:) Does that count?<br/>
<br/>
I thought the items they thought were all-so-important were laughable<br/>
(WHY does my child need to hear certain fairy-tales by a prescribed<br/>
age?)  and the knowledge they DO possess is much more interesting and<br/>
varied. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could use them to further your unschooling trust? Since the<br/>
stuff in there seems really ridiculous as it pertains to real life.<br/>
