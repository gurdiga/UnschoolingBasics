<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857250463">&lt;&lt;&lt;How does writing happen naturally? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much time to read all the replies so forgive me if I am <br/>
repeating what someone else has already posted about.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that I have a 14 year old son that has always <br/>
HATED to write with a pen and paper but enjoys putting his thoughts <br/>
and ideas down.  So he does it all on his computer.  He rarely writes <br/>
with pen and paper but does a TON of writing on his computer!  He also <br/>
has not had any formal writing lessons but writes better than I do.  <br/>
He loves to read and he knows what sounds right and what doesn&#39;t.  He <br/>
has also figured out, I guess by reading, when to capitalize and when <br/>
to put the appropriate punctuation.  This is when I REALLY realized <br/>
that kids do learn, naturally, what they need, when they need it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542379027">As I sit here reading this thread, my ten year old always unschooled dd is<br/>
sitting next to me at her computer writing a story.  She�s on page 19 of<br/>
this really elaborate story of a baby who encounters one downfall after<br/>
another.  It�s very humorous in a sick sort of way but she is so enjoys<br/>
writing these type of stories.  When she was little she learned to write<br/>
because she wanted to write back to her pen pals (cousins).  At first I had<br/>
to show her each letter and how to write it.  Now she has 5 or 6 pen pals<br/>
from all over the country and she enjoys writing to them as well as writing<br/>
stories.  I help her to punctuate it as needed so that people can understand<br/>
what she writes.  When she tries she can do this well but when she�s in the<br/>
middle of creating her stories she just writes and we go back later to<br/>
punctuate it.  It�s been fun to watch her learn to write as she found the<br/>
need to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861804026">I want to thank everyone for all their insight on my question.  I got my question answered <br/>
and then some.  Thank You! Thank You!  Thank You!  <br/>
<br/>

Your right, he really has no need to write right now.  He is content where he is and writing <br/>
isn&#39;t something he is interested in now.  If I or somebody else were to &quot;teach&quot; him, it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be him initiating it because he has no need/interest to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Laura,<br/>
<br/>
He has never been interested in coloring, painting occasionally, but he never wants to sit <br/>
down and color or draw.  Whenever coloring or drawing is suggested he says &quot;I don&#39;t like <br/>
coloring&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t draw&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

I agree that there are a lot of things young children SHOULD be doing other then reading, <br/>
writing, mathematics, ect...  I think it is so pervasive in our society right now to have kids <br/>
doing academics earlier & earlier and to buy them all sorts of &quot;educational&quot; toys, when <br/>
they just need to be living life and PLAYING more than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice of looking at what my child IS doing right now instead of what he <br/>
isn&#39;t.  There are a lot of different things he IS doing right now, although his main interest <br/>
is space, he really has a variety of interests.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the space thing is concerned, we haven&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; him anything, he learns on his <br/>
own by watching videos, having us read him books, and going onto various websites <br/>
dealing with space.  I really couldn&#39;t tell you whether he even knows the names of all the <br/>
planets, or if he knows what order they go in as far as the sun is concerned, as we never <br/>
&quot;quiz&quot; him on what he knows.  He watches very technical videos and wants to check-out <br/>
very technical books from the library, it is pretty much all him initiating whatever planet he <br/>
seems to be interested in at a particular time or whether he wants to check out books <br/>
about stars or the moon or sun, ect....  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Julie</div>
