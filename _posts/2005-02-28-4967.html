<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024301439">***I was going to ask what your kids called nursing. ***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan talked well and early.  <br/>
He used to say &quot;nertsing.&quot;    &quot;I want to go nertsing.&quot; or &quot;Can we go<br/>
nertsing?&quot;<br/>
And if he was very tired or grumpy and just couldn&#39;t wait one more minute<br/>
he&#39;d say &quot;Give me that stinking nertsing!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He nertsed until just short of his fourth birthday.   Six months or so<br/>
after he quit nertsing he caught his first cold and he wanted to nerts<br/>
again so I tried it.  All my milk came back.  With gusto!  And he only<br/>
wanted to nerts for a few days. : /  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be thirteen in May and if I look at him when he&#39;s sleeping I still<br/>
get that feeling like my milk is letting down.   He still looks like a<br/>
baby when he&#39;s asleep.   My baby.  My really, really big baby. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438873144">When ds was little he called nursing &quot;ma ma&#39;s&quot;, and he called one &quot;Big ma ma&quot; <br/>
and one &quot;yu yo Ma Ma&quot;, because the milk came ripping out of big ma ma and the <br/>
let down was so slow out of the &quot;other&quot; one, he called it yu yo for other. IT <br/>
ticked him off . <br/>
Dd calls it &quot;noonies&quot;, and just points to the one she wants, calls them &quot;dis <br/>
noonie&quot; . She told me the other day that she loves noonie milk because it is <br/>
so full of goodness. <br/>
The whole thing is such a great experience. <br/>
When I was getting dressed to go to town the other day, dd told me I had to <br/>
wear a shirt, or everybody would see my noonies and want to drinkthem, and they <br/>
were only for her.<br/>
 <br/>
Nancy in BC, conscientiously covering my noonies.<br/>
