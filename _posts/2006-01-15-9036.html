<div id="ygrps-yiv-844090829">hi, i&#39;m rebecca in tooele, utah.  i read from the list every morning, tea in hand, finding encouragement and support. thank you! i have three children hannah (dd9), jerusha, (dd7), and eli (ds4).  we&#39;ve always homeschooled and began our journey to unschooling about a year ago.  i began looking into unschooling, reading john holt years before.  one day i questioned, &quot;why not?&quot;  that began a fabulous chain reaction and now our home is a hub for creativity, exploring passions, a sanctuary where all are respected and loved.  <br/>
   <br/>
  i need help!  i&#39;m searching for unschoolers in the salt lake city, utah area.  i am having a difficult time finding unschool support.  a friend and i recently started a yahoo group for utah unschoolers. so come take a look because we&#39;d love to make connections with others on the same journey of living every day joyfully and soulfully.<br/>
   <br/>
  glad to be here,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Reba. I lived in Park City for 4 years. For a long time I felt like I was the ONLY unschooler in the state so I know how you feel. I used to travel down to Salt Lake City a lot to find connections for my kids. I only know of one unschooling family in Park City, but knew many relaxed homeschoolers/almost unschoolers in the Salt Lake valley. <br/>
<br/>
Are you a member of SLHE?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you announced your new yahoo group on the Salt Lake City and Utah elists? That helps get the word out. This website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xmission.com/~nprw/HS-ingUtah.html">http://www.xmission.com/~nprw/HS-ingUtah.html</a> has listings for most of the groups in the state. Put your group on there and send notices to all the lists.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665141017">I&#39;m collecting state information - how do unschoolers manage to  <br/>
unschool while meeting state requirements?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could talk about that among yourselves on your new Utah  <br/>
list and send me a summary?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
