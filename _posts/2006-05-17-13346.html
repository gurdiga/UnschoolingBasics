<div id="ygrps-yiv-706032078">&quot;If any of you have read about the subject or dealt with the subject,<br/>
you would understand my intention in bringing it up to gain support<br/>
with our multiple issues of asynchronous development and other<br/>
challenges.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming an awful lot of a group that is nearing 900 people.<br/>
There are many of us here, that have researched this subject in depth<br/>
and still disagree with your use of the label.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that when people point out information different than<br/>
your perception, they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about or haven&#39;t<br/>
researched it.  There are former teachers here, as well as those in<br/>
other specialized fields that have studied &quot;asynchronous&quot;<br/>
development....oh, and just us laypeople that like to research things<br/>
for the helluvit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an &quot;attack&quot; for people to question your ideas. <br/>
The list states very clearly that if you don&#39;t want something<br/>
discussed, please don&#39;t post about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270949949">Yes, it is a complete paradigm shift!  and it is extremely uncomfortable at<br/>
times, but it&#39;s so worth taking another look... through another lens... at<br/>
our lives and how we parent our children.<br/>

Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] support vs. discussion<br/>
 <br/>
Just hang in, read and try to listen to what&#39;s being discussed.  I am new<br/>
here myself and this philosophy requires a new train of thought.  Even<br/>
though it goes against everything I was taught, I believe the responses<br/>
given are profoundly clear as well as purposefully blunt and to the point.<br/>
If the unschooling voices of wisdom here tip-toed around your posts, it<br/>
would be a tremendous waste of precious time and a disservice to inquiries<br/>
seeking honest insight to what this philosophy is all about.  Please stick<br/>
with it if you inclined to learn something entirely new.<br/>
