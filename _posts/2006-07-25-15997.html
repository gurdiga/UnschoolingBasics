<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780214420">Hey everyone!  I need a little feedback from those of you that have<br/>
been to unschooling conferences and workshops and those that are just<br/>
so darn creative.  We have a small &quot;funschool&quot; here in Pensacola that<br/>
we did started last year.  We ended up with two classes that made it<br/>
for the whole year and that was dulcimer and drama.  We had a<br/>
&quot;gathering of minds&quot; to come up with ideas for next year and was<br/>
disheartened with a lot of the ideas that were being brought up.  They<br/>
were very, well, schooly.  When I talked to the kids about what was<br/>
suggested they all rolled their eyes and expressed disinterest.  This<br/>
was FUN last year and it looks very schoolish this year.<br/>
Unfortunately, we have lost quite a few of our unschooling families<br/>
because they dared to MOVE AWAY or the just DON&#39;T COME anymore (you<br/>
know who you are! LOL!)  Anyway, three of the parents that came to the<br/>
funschool planning meeting are more traditional homeschoolers.  One<br/>
even has a child in a church run &quot;co-op&quot; which is nothing more than a<br/>
low cost private school.  So the ideas being bantered around were very<br/>
schoolish-looking.  So I talked with Rose (hi Rose) and I told her I<br/>
would post here for some ideas about FUNSHOPS.  So, what funshops have<br/>
you or your kids done at conferences and other unschool get togethers<br/>
that we might be able to copy, borrow or steal?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912499653">Playdough - the recipe with the cream of tartar and unsweetened kool <br/>
aid was really great; nice texture, smells good, cool colors, <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;bleed&quot; color the way food coloring tends to<br/>
<br/>
Found materials - for example, marshmallows and toothpicks, <br/>
cardboard tubes and yarn and glue; just have folks save up misc bits <br/>
(cardboard tubes; bits of foil - you know how that last bit of foil <br/>
in the package is *always* too small for whatever you want to wrap <br/>
LOL; oddments of yarn; craft sticks; markers, crayons, glue, <br/>
glitter, tuna cans (melt crayons and pour into tuna cans to make <br/>
really wild multi color fat crayons), fabric scraps, etc.) - can do <br/>
building, can do puppetry (maybe even produce a puppet show if drama <br/>
was popular), can make all sorts of crafts. Not totally a found <br/>
thing but if someone can pick up photosensitive paper (at a craft <br/>
store), you can go out and find leaves and rocks and flowers and <br/>
such and make &quot;sun prints&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve got a kitchenette available, food is always good: soft <br/>
pretzels are fun and easy, for example. DS was in a &quot;co-op&quot; activity <br/>
a year or so ago that was &quot;cooking science&quot; where they explored how <br/>
yeast works and sugar crystals and whipped cream (which of course <br/>
once they made whipped cream they HAD TO have ice cream sundaes <br/>
lol), could also make butter to go with some fresh bread (depending <br/>
on the time you&#39;ve got available). And so on. It was pretty cool <br/>
stuff and Tasty!<br/>
<br/>
DH coordinated a chess club during that co-op time. No one was <br/>
required to play or anything (as if he would do that lol) but he <br/>
explained stuff for beginners, had chess puzzles (like from the <br/>
newspaper) available for more advanced kids, and for the last <br/>
meeting day he challenged the whole bunch - they could team up even <br/>
(2 or 3 kids per board) if they wanted to and he played several <br/>
simultaneous games at once - the kids thought that was fun and it <br/>
gave each group of kids a little time to consider moves as he moved <br/>
from board to board. So, maybe an open board game time would be fun -<br/>
 I&#39;m sure there are kids there who are tired of playing the same <br/>
games with their younger siblings over and over and would relish a <br/>
bit more of a challenge (or vice versa the little ones might like <br/>
playing with someone on their own skill level). <br/>
