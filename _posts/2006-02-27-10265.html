<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547827191">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;my biggest doubt about unschooling is how to teach my children <br/>
to write.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was probably my biggest hurdle too, even though I was already <br/>
unschooling.  I was able to coast through my self-doubt and I am <br/>
glad I did because my oldest son is a beautiful writer, great <br/>
spelling and grammar!!  He learned it through MSN messenger, <br/>
reading, and tons of hours just messing with the computer.  Funny <br/>
thing is that he HATES to write with a pen and paper but that is <br/>
okay because we do most everything on our computers anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing that you can&#39;t be concerned with though is WHEN <br/>
everything happens because it is different for every child.  Kevin <br/>
didn&#39;t really become proficient at writing, grammar, etc, until <br/>
11/12 years old, for some kids it is a lot older.  He learned to <br/>
read at 6, my middle son is just learning to read and he is 10, and <br/>
my daughter is 7 and just learning her sounds and putting them <br/>
together.  <br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing is that, for my kids, learning is just part of <br/>
living and it is a lot of fun.  The other day my daughter had the <br/>
computer, journal and pen, and her leap frog letter sound thing <br/>
out.  She was typing and writing away and the sounds of the letters <br/>
were coming from the leap frog.  She was just playing a game but she <br/>
was learning her letters!!<br/>
