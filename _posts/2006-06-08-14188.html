Hello Pam,<br/>
I know you wrote that for another person, but I would love it (and really <br/>
appreciate it:o) if you, or anyone else out there, could point me in the right <br/>
direction to state-level info. for unschooled kids to qualify for college and <br/>
for financial aid. I am in Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

What questions do you have?  We&#39;re also in Michigan and my oldest has been<br/>
in college and qualified for financial aid without the least bit of a<br/>
problem. Feel free to email me off-list. Each school is different but I know<br/>
others as well, and except for Oakland U., no school has ever been a<br/>
problem.<br/>

My kids are, 21 (moved out on his own) and (only) 11 and 12 1/2. Yes, way too <br/>
early to think about college, but fears have a way of creeping into their <br/>
minds (and mine too) every now and then. Sometimes they say to me that they feel <br/>
like they are &quot;stupid or dumb&quot; compared to kids in schools. That they feel <br/>
like they know they are behind or that they might want to go back some time. (I <br/>
think that is only some *candy coated* memories of school creeping into their <br/>
minds also) I told them that they don&#39;t need to *compare* themselves to anyone, <br/>
ever. That just because a kid is in school, doesn&#39;t mean he is smarter than <br/>
them! It just means that he is sitting at a desk every day being forced to *so <br/>
called learn* things that he will most likely forget as soon as he walks out <br/>
of the room, or at least by the time he graduates! I know I did. But, it weighs <br/>
on their minds every now and then. My 11 yo&#39;s best friend that lives across <br/>
the road is an unschooler and her Mom is sending her and her sister back to <br/>
school next year. (a charter school) I think both my dd&#39;s are worried that they <br/>
are being left behind. I just have to find some ways to reassure them a bit. <br/>
When I saw the posts about college, it was right after my dd mentioned college <br/>
to me and I thought I&#39;d ask for any info. I could get.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to &quot;Michigan Unschoolers&quot;! (Hello April:o) I guess I should have <br/>
been looking there! and of course, our wonderful GOOGLE! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
