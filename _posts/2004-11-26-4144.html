<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258681402">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the unschooling ideas.  I have two kids, Kain-5 and<br/>
Jocelyn-1.  I thought I was an unschooler, untill I joined an<br/>
unschooling group.  I have found a whole new way to look at things.  I<br/>
would like to try to unschool.  I know my mom thinks the whole idea is<br/>
crazy, and I haven&#39;t mentioned it to my husband yet.  I want to try to<br/>
use the unschooling ideas in everyday life.  How does it work out with<br/>
kids not having chores or bed times.  I think the only way I could<br/>
convince my huscband is if I said we would do it on a trial basis, for<br/>
a certain amount of time and see how it works.  How long would you ask<br/>
for.  Thank you,<br/>
Amanda</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609044722">Hi Amanda,<br/>
<br/>
The trouble with doing a trial basis with this type of freedom, is that it<br/>
can take a long time to undo the harm you&#39;ve done by being coercive in the<br/>
past.  There isn&#39;t a certain amount of time that will work for everyone.<br/>
The less you have to undo, the less time it&#39;ll take for your children to<br/>
learn with joy and help out around the house with joy.  The more you model<br/>
doing things out of love for them and with joy, the sooner they&#39;ll do the<br/>
same for you.  Your kids are pretty young though.  Instead of dropping it in<br/>
your dh&#39;s lap, you could start by giving him some small articles to read,<br/>
one at a time, and at the same time, start saying yes to your kids more and<br/>
finding ways to work things out in a non-coercive manner.   And model<br/>
helping others with joy.  It&#39;s really all about the joy.   As far as<br/>
education goes, it often helps newer unschoolers to log the learning that<br/>
goes on day to day and share it with your dh.  (I would do this without the<br/>
kids knowing, so they don&#39;t think more value is placed on educational<br/>
things.) <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Good plan! If one year &quot;trial&quot; sounds too long to your dh, what about saying<br/>
just the rest of this &quot;school year&quot;, since for some reason many people who<br/>
are not fully cognizant of how Unschooling works still think that summer is<br/>
a vacation time free of any learning. This way you get pretty close to a<br/>
year anyway. I&#39;d be willing to bet that by the time September rolls around<br/>
again, he would be a convert.<br/>
<br/>
Do some reading about De-schooling at www.sandradodd.com/unschooling .<br/>
Really crucial concept. At that site there are also pages about gradually<br/>
moving into De-choring etc with the least upheaval.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468889123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi amanda!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never did tell my husband what I was doing, its just come about <br/>
gradually.  He stills wants the boys to go to bed at a certain time, <br/>
but I remind him that I don&#39;t tell HIM when to go to bed!<br/>
  As a matter of fact I took it all very slow with dh, knowing he had <br/>
not been learning about unschooling like I had.  And probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t.  When he questions something, I explain it.  Maybe just ask <br/>
him to let you try it and not exactly set a time to stop?!  I don&#39;t <br/>
think you could put a time limit on letting kids set their own <br/>
internal clocks!  Keep reading on here, you&#39;ll learn about the chores <br/>
and such soon, seems to be one subject that comes up alot!<br/>
  Glad your here<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amanda, I know you already talked to your dh, but I wanted to answer <br/>
anyway! We started letting go of controls about 6 months ago, but <br/>
didn&#39;t let go of everything all at once. First of all, it&#39;s hard to <br/>
suddenly let go completely. Second, it can be overwhelming for the <br/>
kids and a less than completely on-board dh. Letting go of controls <br/>
gradually can be a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
I let go of asking for help cleaning up and it took a few months <br/>
before ds (4 y o) started to help.<br/>
<br/>
I just let go of bedtime recently. There were practical problems and <br/>
most of the time ds didn&#39;t mind going to bed. A couple weeks ago, it <br/>
started to get upset about it, so now he goes to sleep on the couch <br/>
with me. He goes to sleep about an hour later than he used to, but <br/>
sleeps a little later, too. I really like having him snuggled next to <br/>
me while I watch a little tv at night. He falls asleep at almost the <br/>
exact same time every night and he&#39;s started to recognize when he&#39;s <br/>
getting sleepy. That&#39;s important to me because I&#39;m pregnant and it&#39;s <br/>
getting harder to carry him up the stairs. I&#39;ll need him to go to <br/>
sleep in his bed in another couple months. We&#39;ll probably move the tv <br/>
in the kitchen to his room and buy a cheap dvd player so I can have <br/>
both kids upstairs to go to sleep without them making noise and <br/>
waking dh up--he goes to sleep earlier than both kids. Anyway, it <br/>
took a while for me to stop clenching and worrying and actually open <br/>
up my mind to look for ways to make it work out. I *can* carry Mikey <br/>
upstairs now, so it&#39;s okay for him to stay downstairs now. <br/>
<br/>
Food is still an issue. We were in a really bad place with his eating-<br/>
-or not eating. He wouldn&#39;t eat just because we were asking. He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t try anything new. And so on. We haven&#39;t let go of controls <br/>
completely and so we&#39;re still having some battles. Both kids ate huge <br/>
amounts of candy for the month around Halloween and it bugged me. <br/>
Looking back now, I can see that sighing and saying &quot;alright&quot; when <br/>
they asked for candy is not the same as leaving the candy bowl where <br/>
they could reach it. Maybe today I&#39;ll finally get around to <br/>
reorganizing some shelves and put more food where they can reach it. <br/>
That really is different than saying yes to requests...They do eat <br/>
lots of fruit and I&#39;ve learned that putting it out in the morning <br/>
leads to fewer candy requests in the afternoon! They have their dad&#39;s <br/>
sweet tooth, which is quite different than my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to babble about our experiences in the last 6 <br/>
months. How fast your children change depends on where you and they <br/>
are now, how much you really change--it can be hard to stop asking <br/>
for help cleaning up without getting annoyed--right away and how much <br/>
your dh is still saying things like &quot;you need to clean up this mess <br/>
right now&quot; and &quot;no pie until you eat your dinner&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325555325">I guess I&#39;ll try letting go a little at a time.  I don&#39;t really have<br/>
that far to go, since I&#39;m already pretty relaxed.  I think bed time<br/>
will be the last thing to go.  I really like having some quiet at the<br/>
end of the day.  But I always let him play quietly in his room untill<br/>
he&#39;s ready to go to sleep.  Thank you everyone for the advice.  I&#39;ll<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230539489">Hi, <br/>
I just wanted to chime in, too!  I and my husband are in the process of &quot;letting go&quot; as well....Had an interesting experience at Thanksgiving dinner with my family, who seem very into &quot;eat this and you can have that&quot;.  My brother was sitting at the table with me and my 5 and 8 yo were at the next table.....he said to my 5 yo son &quot;eat 4 more bites of your turkey and you can have dessert!&quot;  I told my brother and his wife &quot;John and I aren&#39;t really into that sort of thing....he knows when he is full.&quot;  About ten minutes later, my brother announced, &quot;I&#39;m really full.  I can&#39;t eat another bite!&quot; and I noticed that his plate was still full...I said, &quot;OK, but you have to have 4 more bites before you have dessert!&quot;  His wife and I had a good laugh and he got my point.....I hope he&#39;ll remember this when his new baby comes along in March.<br/>
Thanks to everyone for sharing...hearing your stories not only encourage me and make this all easier, but more fun, too!<br/>
Beth  <br/>

taking our time going home along the coast, hopefully seeing some <br/>
whales migrating at Depoe Bay, and we&#39;ll also be checking out the <br/>
Tillamook Cheese Factory.  <br/>

new to unschooling and are going to the Life is Good Conference. My<br/>
husband can&#39;t take the time off of work to go but my mom is coming<br/>
with dd&#39;s and I. It would be great to meet you. Maybe we can figure<br/>
out a meeting place? <br/>

&gt; Hi, my name is Tracy and I have two girls, ages 9 & 13, that I <br/>
&gt; unschool. We started out homeschooling 1 1/2 years ago and over the <br/>
&gt; past few weeks have been making the transition to unschooling. My <br/>
&gt; husband of 15 years is very supportive of me and the girls way of <br/>
&gt; learning. I would love to meet some of you and have the girls make <br/>
&gt; some new friends as well. We are going to the Life is Good Conference <br/>
&gt; next month in Oregon and would love to make some friends that will be <br/>
&gt; there too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100500370">Hello to everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group & unschooling. I have 2 girls, Forrest 11y/o & <br/>
Lei&#39;Anie 6m/o. It will be our first yr since I pulled out my firstborn <br/>
from public school. I&#39;m curious how/what you guys do with the required <br/>
annual assessment?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223373885">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
Not all of us have any required assessment - requirements vary by state.<br/>
It depends on what the assessment is and whether that&#39;s the ONLY option<br/>
you have. I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re in Washington state (since there&#39;s<br/>
Seattle in your screen name). One thing to note is that even though a<br/>
standardized test is the basic option, the results are RETAINED by you,<br/>
not submitted to anyone unless requested (which is rare I think). And,<br/>
that is not the only option - if you can find (through local<br/>
homeschoolers) a homeschooling/unschooling friendly person who is<br/>
certified to teach in WA to do a personal evaluation, that is acceptable<br/>
too. What many people do when tests are required is to check out what<br/>
their test options are (some places limit you to a short list of<br/>
acceptable tests, others don&#39;t) and take the least intrusive one. For<br/>
instance, I think the PASS test is one that allows you to do the test at<br/>
home yourselves (you &#39;administer&#39; it to the kids). Then you tuck the<br/>
results in a drawer without opening the envelope. You maybe give each<br/>
child a die so they can choose a random answer for ones they aren&#39;t sure<br/>
of - tossing a die makes it obvious that it has nothing to do with what<br/>
they do or don&#39;t know. I think <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests">http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests</a> can<br/>
give you some ideas and there are links to other things there as well.<br/>
One link it references is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.familylearning.org/">http://www.familylearning.org/</a> which is based<br/>
in WA which might be helpful for you.<br/>
