<div id="ygrps-yiv-165398520">Thank you all for the sincere posts.  I am glad so many responded.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me though, how radical unschooling parents monitor <br/>

unvaccinated, a major reason I pay close attention to how much junk <br/>
food they consume.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand the concept that guiding children and allowing them to <br/>
make their own choices in the long run is ideal, however, I am <br/>
ultimately held accountable for their health/safety.  At 2, 5, and & <br/>
7 they have no concept that unhealthy food can = illness.  In <br/>

own food addictions too.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to comment on the cleaning up after kids issue?  I have <br/>
been doing this for several years.  My children do not and will not <br/>
clean their messes.  It is a ton of work on me.  They don&#39;t care if <br/>
our living area is messy.  I believe people function much better in <br/>
a clean environment.  I&#39;m not a tyrant by any means; I just like to <br/>
not be lost in clutter.  Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter has a chronic constipation problem, severe<br/>
enough to be on medication for several years. She is<br/>
recently off of medication. So eating healthy is very<br/>
important to us. The trick is to have a lot of healthy<br/>
choices available.  We buy lots of whole grain foods<br/>
and cereals. We bake our own whole wheat flour<br/>
cookies.<br/>
We have baby carrots and cherry tomatoes sitting in<br/>
the fridge.<br/>
<br/>
We talk a lot about fibre and protein content of<br/>
foods. Sometimes my kids ask for some high-sugar<br/>
low-fibre cereals. I buy them, but explain to them<br/>
that nutritionally that&#39;s no different than eating<br/>
candy. I don&#39;t try to control how much sugar they get,<br/>
but I do try to ensure that they get adequate protein<br/>
and fibre. That does sometimes mean saying &quot;after you<br/>
finish your cereal (or PBJ sandwhich...)&quot;. But I think<br/>
it&#39;s better than saying No.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you tried asking for help? It works sometimes. My<br/>
kids help only if they see a reason to cleanup, namely<br/>
if we&#39;re going to have company. Or to make room for<br/>
another messy game. But honestly, I remember my mother<br/>
asking me to cleanup what looked to me like a<br/>
perfectly fine room. And not everyone functions better<br/>
in a clean environment. I&#39;ve a very high tolerence for<br/>
mess and can find what I need in my own mess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878017911">Why would eating junk food would be associated increasing likelihood  <br/>
of contracting childhood illnesses? unhealthy food does not equal  <br/>
illness, bacteria and virus&#39;s do! Be much more concerned about  <br/>
washing their hands and hanging out with kids who have recently been  <br/>
vaccinated! Our kids aren&#39;t vaccinated either, so I understand your  <br/>
concerns, but it&#39;s not fair to equate sugar to illness. True, eating  <br/>
too much at once can cause an upset stomach, but that&#39;s about the  <br/>
extent of it. As long as they are eating other healthy foods, then I  <br/>
would suggest that their immune systems will still be strong and  <br/>
develop.<br/>
<br/>
What we have is a tupperware divided party tray. It has six  <br/>
compartments. Each one has stuff in it, today was animal crackers,  <br/>
cheese cubes, raisons, orange slices, chocolate bars, and carrot  <br/>
sticks. I keep it filled up all day. They will choose to eat those  <br/>
healthy foods as well, because they are good, but if you&#39;re telling  <br/>
them the only chocolate they are getting that day is right there, of  <br/>
course they are going to gorge on that. I keep track of how much of  <br/>
what the kids are eating. If I feel that they aren&#39;t eating enough  <br/>
veggies, I obviously haven&#39;t offered the ones they like. We go out  <br/>
and buy different kinds, same for fruits or carbs. Keep it cut up and  <br/>
available. It will get eaten. Make sure that you are setting a good  <br/>
example by eating healthy foods where they can see.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, sugar is hard to turn down. Unless you&#39;ve had the  <br/>
opportunity to eat enough to get sick. As a personal example,  <br/>
yesterday my mom made us a few dozen chocolate chip cookies. I ate  <br/>
about eight of them. Not healthy, except for the fact that when I was  <br/>
done, I had absolutely no desire for more cookies. I haven&#39;t had any  <br/>
desire for them today. I&#39;ve eaten my fill, and I trust that the kids  <br/>
will reach the same point. Today I really really enjoyed my steamed  <br/>
brocolli. I ate about two heads of it. Again, not a well-balanced  <br/>
day, but over the course of a week, it&#39;s going to look okay. I like  <br/>
the suggestion I first got when I joined. Just say &#39;why not&#39; and let  <br/>
them do it. Today the kids were asking me for giant pixi stixs first  <br/>
thing. I put it clearly, &#39;I worry that if you eat that sugar on an  <br/>
empty stomach, you won&#39;t feel well enough to play&#39;. Sometimes they  <br/>
don&#39;t care, they want  it then. This morning Rachel said &quot;Hm, I see  <br/>
your point. Can I have one after breakfast?&quot; Josh wanted one right  <br/>
then. He ate it. He was fine. Then he asked for some yogurt and an  <br/>
apple.<br/>
<br/>
On the cleaning. I think that kids this young still need primarily  <br/>
someone else to be cleaning. At the very least they need someone to  <br/>
clean with...rather than being forced to do it alone. I don&#39;t demand  <br/>
that my kids help, but usually when I ask them to do something, they  <br/>
are more than happy to! Not always, but usually. Eh, hope this helps,  <br/>
I&#39;m fairly new at this myself, and I&#39;m sure others will have more to  <br/>
say!<br/>

My oldest thinks there should be dessert with lunch and dinner I dont really plan desserts but there is almost always candy , cookies, a pie we have baked whatever. <br/>
  However, she generaly eats whatever sugary stuff she wants right before a meal...she says &quot;it feels better that way&quot;<br/>
  She is a picky eater and has only a small selection of foods she likes to eat but she does cover all the food groups over the week . I do give her a vitamin pill but figure shell be fine. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246701337">The concern, in my opinion, is more about the body not have the right nutrition to draw on when illness does strike, as well as the impact of sugar and inactivity in developing diabetes. Illness is more than just throwing up, or green runny noses. Illness is the body not working properly, and it can&#39;t do that if it&#39;s clogged up with sugars and chemical additives and the like. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m transitioning to a raw vegan diet right now because I&#39;m sick, and a poor diet has been part of it. While eating SAD (Standard American Diet) I am overweight, have chronic fatique symptoms, depression, bad skin and am prediabetic. When I eat raw, my aches and pains go away, I&#39;m not moody or depressed, and my skin clears up. <br/>
   <br/>
  My children and I talk often about how foods are fuel for the body, and keeping the body healthy. They have freedom in what they eat, and most of the time they choose fruits over sweets.     <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps some!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913069558">After my neighbor&#39;s granddaughter died of cancer - her mother because aware<br/>
of a program on television. It was a while back it might have been on CNN or<br/>
CBC, the program was called toxic soup and it talked about the toxic<br/>
household chemicals we use every day. This information caused her to search<br/>
further and lead her to the NIH website about household toxins.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;If you really care about your son you&#39;ll check it out...&quot; that is what Lynn<br/>
told me. Of course, I put it off and put it off. I had better things to<br/>
think about but eventually as I was using my typical all purpose cleaner -<br/>
my favorite back then was 409. I got a headache and sat down with my laptop<br/>
to check my email and Lynn had sent me an email asking if I had checked the<br/>
website. I thought no but if it is that important to her I would look into<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, I got to the site and looked around for a few minutes thinking there<br/>
was too much to look at, then I thought about the cleaner I use and thought<br/>
I would look just that up. It was really the only thing I used and if it was<br/>
fine then my son would be fine, right.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You could look it up on your own but to save you time I will give it to you.<br/>
After all, we are all busy and that is what kept me from looking in the<br/>
first place. I didn&#39;t have enough time.<br/>

Formula 409 Spray All Purpose Cleaner - I used it every where... <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Acute Health Effects: From MSDS<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Mild eye irritant. Overexposure to this product may cause the Worker<br/>
Exposure Limit if ethylene glycol monobutyl ether to be exceeded. Reports<br/>
have associated blood and bone marrow damage with exposure to ethylene<br/>
glycol monobutyl ether. Substance can be absorbed through the skin and may<br/>
contribute to overall exposure. Medical Conditions Generally Aggravated by<br/>
Exposure: None known. Under normal consumer use conditions the likelihood of<br/>
any adverse health effects is low.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
After I read this I freaked, I called the company because I wanted to know<br/>
what normal use was in their definition. The customer service rep I talked<br/>
to said that that normal customer use was defined as once a week to not more<br/>
then five times per month. I don&#39;t know about anyone else but at the time my<br/>
son was three. He made daily messes as well as three cats and you combine<br/>
that will just general kitchen clean up. I was using it at least once a day.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I called Lynn and cried and she told me about a company that sold products<br/>
that are completely non-toxic, really work and were the same or less then<br/>
what I bought in the store. I have been a Melaleuca Customer ever since. I<br/>
am not trying to sell anyone anything but in light of what has been going on<br/>
lately as well as everyone&#39;s concern for their children&#39;s health - I feel<br/>
obliged to pass the info on. So, check out the information - if nothing<br/>
else. Look up the products you use, to clean your house and then look at the<br/>
ones your put in and on your body that you absorb through your skin.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So now you have the information - it up to you to decide what to do with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524892459">I borrowed and have just finished reading a book that has been around for a<br/>
while evidently it is called Eating for Your Blood Type.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that there are 4 known blood types among all the people of our<br/>
planet: A, B, AB and O. Type O is considered the oldest, Type AB the latest<br/>
to appear in the world&#39;s history. Type A is considered to fare better on a<br/>
grain-based diet than Type O. Type O is considered to fare better on a diet<br/>
that includes more meat. <br/>
<br/>
This theory is based on the idea that certain foods cause allergic reactions<br/>
and even agglutination of blood cells, due to reactions to various foods,<br/>
and specifically proteins in different foods that the body treats as foreign<br/>
antigens, much like the an immune system response to antigens (proteins)<br/>
present in bacteria and viruses. We are therefore advised to eat foods which<br/>

there is almost always candy , cookies, a pie we have baked whatever. <br/>
  However, she generaly eats whatever sugary stuff she wants right before a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916153472">What I read is that she didn&#39;t want her children eating junk food  <br/>
because it will increase their chances of getting the diseases that  <br/>
children are usually immunized against, measles, mumps, rubella,  <br/>
polio, diphtheria. I don&#39;t see what that has to do with household  <br/>
toxins, unless you&#39;re getting to the cleaning part...and it&#39;s  <br/>
permission to not clean as often ;-)<br/>
<br/>
All I was saying was that it didn&#39;t seem fair to limit their choices  <br/>
based on her fears. I don&#39;t regret giving my kids choices or anything  <br/>
that they consume. It all evens out over long term. And in light of  <br/>
current events, I think probably not a good idea to equate cleaners  <br/>
with cancer. It&#39;s certainly not the only cause, sometimes crap just  <br/>
happens. :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443368311">Shannon has said that she&#39;s a customer of Melaleuca and that using  <br/>
their products instead of regular household cleaners will be &quot;safer&quot;  <br/>
and more &quot;nontoxic&quot; for our children.<br/>
<br/>
I have a different opinion on that - based on personal experience and  <br/>
offer a bit of scientific evidence to back up my own experience.<br/>
<br/>
To support a friend who was trying to start a home-based business, I  <br/>
bought months&#39; worth of this company&#39;s products and used it - rather  <br/>
sparingly, by the way. It gave me a very bad rash, smelled bad, and  <br/>
my family complained. I ended up throwing it all away, after spending  <br/>
a lot of money on it.<br/>
<br/>
Melaleuca is sold through a multi-level marketing program.<br/>
<br/>
After having severe allergic reactions to it, myself, I did a little  <br/>
online investigating. What I found was that there are people who are  <br/>
very allergic to tea tree oil, which is what melaleuca products  <br/>
contain. I found that putting it on the skin - as in the bath bars or  <br/>
lotions - can result in red, burning, itching skin rashes and  <br/>
swelling. Taking it orally - as in vitamins and other supplements, or  <br/>
breathing the fumes of cleaning products containing it, can result in  <br/>
children experiencing drowsiness, muscle weakness, muscle tremors,  <br/>
depression, loss of coordination, and difficulty walking. Other  <br/>
possible adverse effects include stomach discomfort and abnormal  <br/>
blood counts. Use of products containing tea tree oil is not  <br/>
recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women or children.<br/>
<br/>
Here is further information:<br/>
&quot;Although tea tree oil has been suggested for many conditions, it has  <br/>
not been proven for any health problem. It should be avoided in  <br/>
pregnant and breast-feeding women and in children. Because it is  <br/>
toxic if taken by mouth, tea tree oil should be used only on the  <br/>
skin. Side effects may include skin dryness or peeling, and allergies  <br/>
have been reported. Consult your health care provider immediately if  <br/>
you experience side effects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For more information, here is a site that you can have a look at - it  <br/>
lists many studies of the effect of tea tree oil. It is definitely  <br/>
not totally safe or even &quot;nontoxic.&quot;<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/31402/405383.html?">http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/31402/405383.html?</a> <br/>
d=dmtContent&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of claims are made when products are sold through multi-level  <br/>
marketing methods - the original company can&#39;t really control what  <br/>
people are saying in order to sell their product.<br/>
<br/>
Being careful about what products we use is great - and that includes  <br/>
using things that are aesthetically appealing as well as safe. I  <br/>
agree with that recommendation, of course, just not with the  <br/>
suggestion of that one particular company&#39;s products as if that  <br/>
guarantees safety. They sell things like sparkly toothpaste for  <br/>
children that contains tea tree oil, for example. That is really not  <br/>
a safe use of tea tree oil, since children using that toothpaste are  <br/>
likely to be swallowing some of it on a daily basis.<br/>

Wish I could find it but recently a lot of research has been done on <br/>
processed foods/junk foods versus whole foods. The studies ARE showing <br/>
that there is a link to high quantites of illness in children and high <br/>
intake of processed/junk foods. Of course who knows why, at this <br/>

The concern, in my opinion, is more about the body not have the right<br/>
nutrition to draw on when illness does strike, as well as the impact of<br/>
sugar and inactivity in developing diabetes. Illness is more than just<br/>
throwing up, or green runny noses. Illness is the body not working properly,<br/>
and it can&#39;t do that if it&#39;s clogged up with sugars and chemical additives<br/>
and the like. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m transitioning to a raw vegan diet right now because I&#39;m sick, and a<br/>
poor diet has been part of it. While eating SAD (Standard American Diet) I<br/>
am overweight, have chronic fatique symptoms, depression, bad skin and am<br/>
prediabetic. When I eat raw, my aches and pains go away, I&#39;m not moody or<br/>
depressed, and my skin clears up. <br/>
   <br/>
  My children and I talk often about how foods are fuel for the body, and<br/>
keeping the body healthy. They have freedom in what they eat, and most of<br/>
the time they choose fruits over sweets.     <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps some!<br/>

<br/>
Every body can handle quite a bit more than what the alarmists would<br/>
like you to believe. I&#39;m pretty health consicous, I can tell you a LOT<br/>
about herbs and healing and alternative eating. I&#39;ve done classes on<br/>
vegetarian cooking and making healthy changes.<br/>
<br/>
I also let my children choose their own food (obviously they&#39;re<br/>
influenced by my choices and cooking) including chips, soda and sweets.<br/>
Not ONE of them has been to the doctor in years.<br/>
In fact, my 16 y.o. only went to the Doctor when he was very little<br/>
for illness, my 12 y.o. has been ONE time for illness, 8y.o. has been<br/>
ONE time and my 5 y.o. has never seen the Doctor for illness of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
Not much of a connection between &quot;junk&quot; food and health here. Now<br/>
there IS a correlation between a lack of nutritional food and illness.<br/>
I don&#39;t really think an overall healthy person, that eats a wide<br/>
variety of foods needs to stress about sugar and other snacks. You&#39;ve<br/>
got to look at the big picture.<br/>
<br/>
Food has not been an issue here. My kids will happily eat brocolli as<br/>
often as chocolate. If you don&#39;t make a big deal about food, just buy<br/>
what they choose (sometimes point out similar choices you&#39;re more<br/>
comfortable with if necessary) fix lotsa good food and DON&#39;T WORRY!<br/>
Truly.<br/>
<br/>
When worrying about food choices, just remember...the worry kills you<br/>
faster than a burger and fries will.<br/>

Yes, but what if your children have lived with restrictions, as mine have. <br/>
We stopped that about 2 months ago, and though I must say I am pleased <br/>
that it hasn&#39;t been worse, they are definitely binge-ing on junk. I know <br/>
that&#39;s normal, but does anyone have experience moving away from those kind <br/>
of restrictions that can tell me about how long this might last?<br/>
        Sugar is a health issue for me. I have low blood sugar that may be <br/>
moving toward pre-diabetes. Both my parents are now diabetic. Though I <br/>
believe having a healthy attitude about food is the way to go, and not <br/>
making things off limits, this all does make me nervous. Here&#39;s the thing <br/>
that I&#39;m aware of: we all need a certain number of calories everyday. The <br/>
more that come from sugar and other empty calories, the less that come <br/>
from nutritious calories, unless we overeat. SO, I very much want to <br/>
believe the time will come that they will be finished pushing the old <br/>
limits and will make healthy choices for themselves.<br/>
        As I said, it has not been all bad. I work hard at putting out <br/>
fruit and vegetable plates, etc. and they are eating them. I&#39;m not <br/>
panicking here, just looking for some encouragement about the future.<br/>
        Also, another concern I have is that I was not limited in my sugar <br/>
intake as a child. I ate pretty much as much as I wanted, and still I have <br/>
sugar compulsion, though it used to be worse before my health went <br/>
downhill. THEN I reacted positively and made different decisions from a <br/>
different motivation, but I don&#39;t want it to come to that for my girls.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder what messages you got along with food, though? I&#39;m thinking  <br/>
about my own experience--my mother kept lots of sugary things in the  <br/>
house, as well as convenience foods we could fix for ourselves, like  <br/>
little spaghetti packets you just had to add hot water to. But she  <br/>
also harangued us about food all the time--I saw her do this with my  <br/>
niece awhile ago, when my niece got a Coke from the fridge: &quot;You  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have another Coke, you&#39;ll end up fat like your Aunt Susan  <br/>
[that&#39;s me], with your ethnic background [niece is Hispanic] you&#39;re  <br/>
at greater risk for diabetes, you&#39;re lucky you aren&#39;t already  <br/>
diabetic with all the sugar you eat...&quot; Non-stop, the whole time my  <br/>
niece was drinking it. That was my experience growing up, that the  <br/>
food was there and we could choose it, but we were judged and blamed  <br/>
for choosing it. I do believe that it would have been better for my  <br/>
mother to establish matter-of-fact restrictions than to treat it that  <br/>
way--we could have the food but always felt guilty and bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
My mother also was a compulsive eater, and although she tried to hide  <br/>
it from us, I believe she modeled that behavior in ways that I, at  <br/>
least, picked up on.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a lot of residual food issues. I have never gotten to the  <br/>
point of being able to keep sugary things in the house without eating  <br/>
more of them than I feel good about eating, and this is actually a  <br/>
challenge for me because my kids like to have some sweets in the  <br/>
house and have very healthy, happy relationships to them, but it is  <br/>
better for ME to have a very limited amount of sugar available, so we  <br/>
have had to work on striking a balance there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that my childhood experience necessarily parallels  <br/>
yours. It&#39;s just that, when we get talking about food limits, my own  <br/>
experience suggests to me that the messages kids get about food--what  <br/>
is good and bad, whether they are good or bad for eating certain  <br/>
things--have been more of a determinant than whether the food was  <br/>
available.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894133470">Hi Su. Thanks for your response. I can certainly see how those kind of <br/>
messages would contribute to an unhealthy relationship with food. I don&#39;t <br/>
remember that kind of thing in my house growing up. I think we were all <br/>
pretty ignorant at that time about the ways that sugar might not be a <br/>
great thing to eat in large quantities. I don&#39;t remember being hassled <br/>
about my eating. I was always thin and pretty physically fit, so there <br/>
wasn&#39;t a worry there. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... perhaps that was the part that was lacking - being taught about <br/>
healthy choices in eating, eating sweets in smaller quantities and only <br/>
occasionally being a wiser choice than in large quantities daily. I don&#39;t <br/>
think my parents were negligent. I think there was less information at <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said earlier though, I think my main concern is that when we get <br/>
our calories from things heavy in refined sugar or &#39;junk food&#39;, then that <br/>
number of &#39;empty calories&#39; is replacing more nutritional choices.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t buy this.<br/>
When I eat too much sugar (to the point I don&#39;t feel good) I CRAVE<br/>
protein and healthy food. I think I actually eat the same amount of<br/>

unless you have a really good reason to worry about caloric intake,<br/>
then it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see...I drink cream with my tea which is about 4-5x per day, I<br/>
eat truffles (loaded with fat and sugar). In fact, I was just talking<br/>

He&#39;s good under pressure. He knows that a cup of tea and some truffles<br/>

I have friends that eat much more carefully than I do and are<br/>
overweight. Sure, people could be more aware of ingredients and<br/>

I share nutritional info. with my kids, I ask if I can replace a<br/>
cracker they want with a healthier version, but in the end we just<br/>
don&#39;t stress about it. Balance, balance...once again.<br/>
<br/>
Once I get a garden big enough, we&#39;ll be eathing lotsa raw, organic<br/>
veggies. Once we actually have incomes, we&#39;ll be buying more organic<br/>

  Its interesting you mention this. I used to be in gymnastics, slim muscular in great shape. She was overweight my entire childhood and used to constantly say things like you have a family history of diabetes , your weight is ok now but you are going to have to be very careful not to gain any blah blah blah. <br/>
   <br/>
  so I went through a phase of trying to starve myself and now Im fat :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556557645">I could debate this, but I&#39;m not really interested in doing that. On the <br/>
whole I agree with your message - access to good food, information, no <br/>
guilt... Great. I too am fortunate to have genes that keep me thin <br/>
regardless of how I eat. Adding calories is not a problem. That is not the <br/>
case for everyone. Many people (in the  U.S., in my town, in my family) do <br/>
have reason to worry about caloric intake. Also, being thin and *looking* <br/>
fit are not the only issues. We don&#39;t always know what&#39;s going on on the <br/>
inside. When I started having some serious medical problems , people were <br/>
shocked - &quot;you&#39;ve always seemed so healthy&quot;. Yes, I always thought I was <br/>
healthy too. For me, removing refined sugar from my diet was necessary and <br/>
left doctors shaking their heads at how I turned some physical problems <br/>
around. I wasn&#39;t interested in their path and left allopathic medicine <br/>
behind. Do I recommend *everyone* stop eating refined sugar? No. Do I <br/>
think some of my problems came from excessive refined sugar intake? Yes. <br/>
Well I appear to have debated anyway, and that was not my intent. I have <br/>
avoided these discussions for months, because I don&#39;t want to argue about <br/>
it. I really don&#39;t. <br/>
However, I do have questions, and...<br/>
My original question still stands, i.e. does anyone have experience <br/>
removing restrictions with their children, and if so what was that like? <br/>
How long did it take for the children to settle into making decisions <br/>
based on how they feel now, rather than reacting to formerly imposed <br/>
arbitrary restrictions? I would love to go back and not force my eating <br/>
choices on my children in their first few years, but alas I can not, so we <br/>
go on from here. My husband is amazed that I am able to let them make <br/>
their own decisions now without putting guilt trips on them, knowing how <br/>
strongly I feel about eating nutritional, whole foods. The thing is, it <br/>
makes total sense to me that I can not force what I believe onto others, <br/>
including my children, and respecting them is just as important as <br/>
honoring my (or their) physical body(ies). <br/>
To explain my concern just a bit more, in the past, Faye and Annika ate <br/>
more of a variety of things (not by force, by choice). Now it seems they <br/>
are more willing to decline because they know there are other &#39;tastier&#39; <br/>
things around that I will not stop them from having, like cookies, cheetos <br/>
or whatever. (Faye has always been somewhat picky, but now she is ruling <br/>
out even more.) Again, I think this is somewhat reactive, and I&#39;m trying <br/>
to trust that it will not be permanent.<br/>
Any stories from the experience of others are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Gayle<br/>
<br/>
P.s. I have shared the many responses to my post a while ago about my <br/>
control issues (remember the example was about stamping?) with several <br/>
friends and family members. I still have them in a word document to refer <br/>
back to. Those emails helped me turn a corner, and I&#39;m so grateful to you <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599549964">We did that. We did that in October of 2005, so it wasn&#39;t that long  <br/>
ago. They based their choices on eating on how they felt then. They  <br/>
felt that they needed to eat sugar then. They were making up for  <br/>
years and years of not getting to choose. They ate until they felt  <br/>
like they didn&#39;t want more. They still do it sometimes.  *I* still do  <br/>
that. And while you said that your children ate a variety by choice,  <br/>
in the next sentence you say that now you have &quot;other &#39;tastier&#39;  <br/>
choices around&quot;. So, yeah, they are getting to choose things now,  <br/>
things that they want to choose, not just  what&#39;s most appealing out  <br/>
of what you bought previously. Give it some time. Trust in them.  <br/>
Trust in their bodies. Trust that the choices they make are right for  <br/>
them. Bodies crave what they are not getting enough of. Bodies get  <br/>
sick of what they get too much of. I mentioned before that I noticed  <br/>
with my kids, if they weren&#39;t eating what the American dietary  <br/>
whatever said was enough, then I would buy a TON of different  <br/>
veggies. And I would remember that kids portions of food are 1/2 to  <br/>
1/3 the size of mine. Kids need more spare calories than adults do  <br/>
too, because they are growing and burning energy by learning, running  <br/>
and just being!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve only been doing this for six months. We are still seeing the  <br/>
effects of previously being limited. The best step we&#39;ve taken to  <br/>
break this is going to Sam&#39;s club, buying the biggest container of  <br/>
each of their favorite candies, and leaving it in the kitchen.  <br/>
Whenever they ask, we say yes. That&#39;s all, just &#39;yes&#39;. Sometimes I&#39;ll  <br/>
say yes, and then ask if they&#39;ll bring me one too. Just put all your  <br/>
snacks out for snack time, invite them in. Let them make snacks. My  <br/>
hubby bought a cookbook called my first cookbook where they can make  <br/>
cookies and ice cream snacks and all kinds of fun stuff. Not only do  <br/>
we get to do things together, they&#39;re homemade, less preservatives  <br/>
and highfructose corn syrup, and we have a great time together. We  <br/>
dip a lot of fresh fruit in chocolate almond bark (nutrients and  <br/>
chocolate at the same time) And sometimes one of them will say, &quot;mom,  <br/>
I could really use some broccolli right night&quot;, and so that&#39;s what we  <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll work out. Give it six months. Then reassess what&#39;s going  <br/>
on. :-)  Scary, I know! I still worry.<br/>
