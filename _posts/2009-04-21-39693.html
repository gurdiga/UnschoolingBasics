<div id="ygrps-yiv-978201347">Hi all,<br/>
May be a strange post, but I wanted to let you all know that we have the<br/>
chicken pox, or at least my son Nathaniel does. He was not vaccinated and<br/>
has a mild case. I know some people may want to expose their children to it<br/>
so they can get it over with before they get much older. If you&#39;d like to<br/>
expose your child, let me know and we can make arrangements to let them hang<br/>
out. He&#39;s already starting to crust over with some and isn&#39;t developing many<br/>
more--the doctor says its a pretty mild case. But it should still be<br/>
sufficient for him to develop the antibodies. Anyway, let me know. And feel<br/>
free to forward to other local lists.<br/>
Best,<br/>
