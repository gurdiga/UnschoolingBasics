How to do the Great Backyard Bird Count<br/>
It&#39;s as easy as 1, 2, 3!<br/>
<br/>
tallboy.jpg1. Plan to count birds for at least 15 minutes during<br/>
February 16Â–19, 2007. You can count each day or just some of the days<br/>
and you can count in different places. Just be sure to keep a separate<br/>
list of birds for each day and each location.<br/>
<br/>
2. For each type of bird you see, count the most you see at any one<br/>
time. For example, maybe you see two chickadees when you start<br/>
watching, then five chickadees a few minutes later. The number you put<br/>
on your list for chickadees is five. Do not add two plus five. (That<br/>
way you won&#39;t accidentally count the same bird twice.)<br/>
<br/>
3. Enter your results on the Great Backyard Bird Count web site! Then<br/>
watch the maps as more and more people enter their reports.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s it! Now get ready to participate in the Great Backyard Bird<br/>
Count because when it comes to watching birds, kids count!</div>
