<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923411005">&quot;Therefore, I really<br/>
need to be certain about this method of homeschooling before I try and<br/>
sell it to him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you do. But you don&#39;t have to convince him of unschooling, just<br/>
homeschooling. I wouldn&#39;t talk much about unschooling actually, but<br/>
simply log everything they do to keep him happy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not worth a battle over homeschooling with an ex....they can sue<br/>
you for custody and I&#39;ve seen that go wrong more than once. A good<br/>
friend is fighting for her child right now, over a custody<br/>
issue....hoping to homeschool again. It can get really ugly.<br/>
<br/>
So.....read &quot;colouring outside the lines&quot; by Roger Schank and<br/>
&quot;Guerrilla  schooling&quot; (I think that&#39;s the name) and learn how to<br/>
support their interests and not focus on grades or other such nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
You may not be able to homeschool....please consider that before you<br/>
move. And how do your children feel about living off the grid? I<br/>
really think unschooling works best if you have access to museums,<br/>
stores and fun places to visit regularly. I know people that live<br/>
rurally and make sure they get to places, but if you&#39;re too far out it<br/>
can be a huge challenge. Unschooling isn&#39;t about isolating our<br/>
children against their will, just to fulfill our ideals of living off<br/>
the land. It can work beautifully, or it can be really frustrating for<br/>
the children, you need to make sure they&#39;re truly on board...even<br/>
then, be willing to make a shift if they change their minds.<br/>
