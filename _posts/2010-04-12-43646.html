<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973851852">Are you considering coming to the Great Big Happy Life conference this year?<br/>
June 7-10th in the beautiful mountains of New Jersey?<br/>
<br/>
As we near our registration deadline of May 1st, we wanted to give folks<br/>
more of a sneak peek into the Great Big Happy Life experience in the hopes<br/>
that you will come and be a part of this unique combination<br/>
conference-retreat. <br/>
<br/>
Registration for the Great Big Happy Life Unschoolers<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greatbighappylife.com/">http://www.greatbighappylife.com/</a>&gt;  Conference Retreat will close May 1st<br/>
and we still have a few rooms left as well as some tent spaces.  Our main<br/>
focus is creating an environment in which parents can really focus on being<br/>
with their kids- while getting recharged by sharing space and experiences<br/>
alongside other unschooling families who have chosen this life with their<br/>
children. You won&#39;t have to think about meals since we are a catered event<br/>
with seasonal natural fresh foods, you won&#39;t have to think about going<br/>
anywhere- we are like a little self contained unschooling village. With your<br/>
kids you can just enjoy the spaciousness, calm and quiet of the beautiful<br/>
250 acre campus,  or if you prefer, find a tribe and absorb the joyful<br/>
noises of kids doing their thing.  We plan to have massage by the minute-<br/>
and there will be a morning Qigong experience each day. <br/>
<br/>
We have added Sandra Dodd to the menu of wonderfulness that we plan to offer<br/>
this year. In addition to hosting a lunch group amusingly called &quot;How to<br/>
Screw Up Unschooling&quot;, Sandra will be giving a talk called Connections-<br/>
about the unfoldment of learning for all of us and how if happens. Erika<br/>
Davis-Pitre will also be talking about Unschooling Diversity and Unschooling<br/>
Teens. <br/>
<br/>
We have also contracted with Wildman Steve Brill<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/">http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/</a>&gt; , a naturalist and forager to come and<br/>
work with our group, giving us a tour of the wild around the camp. This is<br/>
great fun for everyone and you actually learn which plants are edible, what<br/>
not to touch and how to identify things in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
We are working to entice a NJ author of books about ghosts and hauntings<br/>
coming to give us a glimpse into the spine-tingling fun world of ghost<br/>
hunting, and he may even join us for our campfire for a round of spookiness.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a share our wares table for kids and grownups to sell their<br/>
creations- and raffles and passion baskets to discover and win!<br/>
<br/>
There will be an 8-minute Dating for families event- a HUGE hit last year as<br/>
it allows everyone to meet and say hi and learn about one another in a<br/>
totally silly and pressure free way- many friendships were forged last year<br/>
as a result of 8 minute dating- and it is great for those of us who are a<br/>
bit on the shy side!<br/>
<br/>
Funshops are being added all the time- most recently a gnome home funshop,<br/>
smashing t-shirts, knot tying, fishing fest and a music jam. We also hope to<br/>
get our cookie diva to return for some cookie decorating fun- and we will be<br/>
offering waterfront activities at the lake. <br/>
<br/>
We will have a room set up just for gamers, a movie night, talent show,<br/>
superhero breakfast (you have to come to find out about that one) and lots<br/>
of sunshine and wide open spaces of time. <br/>
<br/>
The conference runs from dinner Monday thru breakfast Thursday- and our<br/>
prices are family friendlier than last year as we found a beautiful new home<br/>
for our gathering that allows families both the privacy of their own rooms<br/>
with the experience of living in a community. <br/>
<br/>
Say YES to the Great Big Happy Life! Whether this is your first conference<br/>
or your tenth, we need your energy and we welcome you and your family! <br/>
<br/>
With Love, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
