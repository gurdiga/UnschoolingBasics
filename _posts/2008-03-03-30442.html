Hi all-<br/>
I am putting together my sons portfolio (Florida) and need to put his main passion which is physical exercise and working out into educationalize. He spends 3-4 hours a day at the gym, we have a home gym w/ punching bags, weights, bench press, medicine ball, etc. Other than the obvious physical education and anatomy, can anyone give me additional ideas on how to incorporate additional &#39;subjects&#39; from this? Any help or web links would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Gianna</div>

No, she doesn&#39;t.  I realize that FL law doesnt require it but my son is a <br/>
bit of a special case.  I really hate to go into anything on a public forum <br/>
but I am trying to cover all my bases since court/probation is involved <br/>
(nothing to do with homeschooling).  I will never show it to anyone unless <br/>
it becomes necessary, I just want to be proactive and be ready should I have <br/>
to justify my &quot;curriculum&quot; because at this point, we are not sure what is <br/>
going to happen.  This is not the typical portfolio, but I have been <br/>
searching online and haven&#39;t really found anything that would be helpful and <br/>
was hoping to pick some &quot;experienced brains&quot;, if there are others in other <br/>
states that do go into detail.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Gianna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932997053">I don&#39;t know if I have the full question--is it that you are trying to find other &quot;subjects&quot; from all the sports/working out etc your son does?  If so, how about team work--are there ever other people involved?  Nutrition, herbology, anatomy (I know you already thought of that), science--do certain materials aide the muscle building better than others?  What offers the most resistance?  Why?  What materials can be used to make weights, machines etc?  Can you visit a place that manufactures these things?  Sales?  You get the theme here.  Time management is another.  Statistics.....how many repetitions in how long of a time period?  Charting--measurements, weight loss/gain, etc.  Does the brain behave differently because of the exercise.  What physical/emotional differences are evident after 1 week of not working out.  Does the concentration level change depending upon yoga being added?  I am reaching here to get you to find your own questions.  there are probably lots more!  Where in the world do the world champions live?  Where did they train and how?  Where will the Olympics be?  What are teh Olympics--when was weight lifting determined to be a sport?  Where are its origins?  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
