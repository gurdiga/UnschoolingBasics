<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069048263">Hi!  I found this list while searching frantically for curriculums<br/>
after pulling my son out of second grade in public school.  I thought<br/>
I was using positive parenting until I started reading these groups<br/>
and now I realize that I nag, coerce, bribe, praise, reward, and<br/>
punish and attempt to control my kids pretty much all day long.  Oops!<br/>
<br/>
But my intention since they were born was to parent them respectfully.<br/>
 I did a much better job of that when they were very small and I am<br/>
working hard to return to being the parent I want to be.  I&#39;m<br/>
practicing saying yes, which is a great relief to them and to me.  It<br/>
was hard to let my daughter dig the ashes out of the fireplace and<br/>
dump them all on the hearth but you know what?  She had a blast for<br/>
almost an hour and it took all of ten minutes to clean the whole mess up!<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re all really struggling with sibling squabbles.  My daughter<br/>
is four and she has a lot of explosions.  She was having a meltdown<br/>
almost every night at bedtime...screaming, kicking, biting and<br/>
scratching me.  So ok, no more bedtime, problem solved!  But it&#39;s not<br/>
that easy when her brother&#39;s interests are at stake too.  I&#39;ve read<br/>
the Explosive Child and Siblings without Rivalry and I&#39;m still at a<br/>
loss how to say yes to both of them when they both want to watch<br/>
different things on the same tv at the same time.  I feel forced to<br/>
choose sides several times a day because if I just let them work<br/>
things out my son invariably has to be the one to give in or he gets<br/>
hurt because she flies into a violent rage.  I prevent outbursts in<br/>
every way I can think of..keeping them entertained, having the<br/>
discussions recommended in Explosive Child and working out strategies<br/>
with her to deal with her anger, and modeling calm, gentle behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Now part of what&#39;s bothering her might be my past attempts to control<br/>
her, maybe it will just take her some time to trust me not to do her<br/>
that way anymore and to find better ways to control herself.  But in<br/>
the meantime how do I keep them from hurting each other without making<br/>
my son feel like he has to walk on eggshells around her?  How do I get<br/>
through this while making both children feel respected and valued?  I<br/>
know I must be missing a piece of the puzzle...someone please tell me<br/>
what it is?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837213145">Erin,<br/>
<br/>
I can totally relate to your youngest dd controlling the oldest.  My<br/>
dd is like that with her older brothers.  I think she feels out of<br/>
control because she is the youngest & wants to be included and she is<br/>
the only girl.  Therefore, not quite the same situation as you.  With<br/>
3 kids, I find myself, making schedules of whose turn it is to do<br/>
what.  Since they all want equal time with tv, computer, mom & dad,<br/>
etc.  and of course, they want the particular thing at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I am very new to the idea of unschooling - I understand the basic<br/>
premise, but haven&#39;t had time to read much about how to implement it.<br/>
 So, my idea of taking turns of course, was MY idea, not theirs. <br/>
However, most of the time they seem to be ok with it.  Also, when I<br/>
ask my oldest ds what he thinks we should do about the situation, he<br/>
often comes back with a similar thought to mine.<br/>
<br/>
[my ds are over 3 yrs apart & dd is 2 1/2 yrs younger than 2nd ds;<br/>
oldest ds is 1 1/2 months shy of being 6 yrs older that dd]<br/>
<br/>
As to the letting them work it out, I have not been one to do this.  I<br/>
feel that if there is a big age discrepancy, then this isn&#39;t possible<br/>
until the younger sibling has the skills TO work it out.  In our house<br/>
the older ds always gets his way, if I don&#39;t step in.  Within the past<br/>
year, however, our younger ds seems to be more able to fend for<br/>
himself.  They both still want me to intervene (probably because I<br/>
always did).  Often, I tell them they both were at fault and need to<br/>
work it out or the TV, computer, etc. will be turned off.  As to<br/>
fighting, last spring a counselor suggested to me that we send the<br/>
boys outside to work out their differences.  It was hard for me at<br/>
first, but I kept an eye/ear on the situation where they didn&#39;t see. <br/>
It didn&#39;t take them long to get over the original problem, but I<br/>
noticed that my older ds was antagonizing my younger ds (they were 9<br/>
yr & 6 yr at the time).  I felt like this was confirming my idea that<br/>
they weren&#39;t old enough to work out their differences.  The counselor<br/>
said to leave the antoginizer outside, until he was calm and let the<br/>
other boy come back in.  OK, I think I got a little OT...<br/>
<br/>
My 4 yr old dd responds well to time-out.  By that, I mean, she goes<br/>
to it and stays there for her 4 min.  She seems calmer & apologetic<br/>
afterward and I talk with her about how we don&#39;t hit, bite, etc.<br/>
because it hurts.  She needs to use her words, etc. or come to me.  I<br/>
am not sure if this method truly gives her time to calm down or if she<br/>
is learning not to express her anger.  I hope it is the former. Again,<br/>
I truly believe she is too young to just &quot;work it out&quot; without<br/>
guidance from an adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032943979">Time outs don&#39;t work.  Sorry to be so blunt.  But they are a <br/>
temporary solution in the parent&#39;s best interest.  Have you read <br/>
Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn?  I would suggest it and an <br/>
article on his website about the problems with the Super Nanny.  <br/>
Time out is a term that was coined in the fifties when scientists <br/>
were doing tests on mice.  It basically means time out from love or <br/>
love withdrawal.  It can create many of the situations that you are <br/>
trying to solve by using time outs.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped using timeouts with my children a couple of years ago.  <br/>
Things got pretty crazy around here for a while.  My DH and I had to <br/>
find a new way to take care of problems.  Books that helped us: <br/>
Parent Effectiveness Training by Thomas Gordon, Raising Our <br/>
Children, Raising Ourselves by Naomi Aldort, The Drama of the Gifted <br/>
Child by Alice Miller, Punished By Rewards by Alfie Kohn, anything <br/>
by John Holt.  And on my personal journey, Loving What Is by Byron <br/>
Katie.<br/>
<br/>
I would type more but my children need me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;letting kids work it out&quot; with <br/>
no help at all - kids need plenty of assistance figuring out this <br/>
big, crazy world, full of complicated Others. Some kids (some <br/>
people!) are really good at working out solutions to problems with <br/>
others, but most need some help negotiating and problem solving. My <br/>
5yo is often very capable of suggesting solutions to disputes with <br/>
other kids, but not at hearing their solutions! So she needs help <br/>
with that part, still.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm. I&#39;m uncomfortable with the idea of telling people they <br/>
are &quot;at fault&quot; for lacking skills or needing help. While I&#39;m sure <br/>
your guys are learning not to ask for help, its clear that they <br/>
still need it - they are asking for your input. There are options <br/>
besides intervening, and disempowering them one way, and leaving <br/>
them to fend for themselves, which disempowers them another way. <br/>
<br/>
It takes time and work and practice to learn to facilitate problem <br/>
solving - but it is possible to bring the kids into the learning <br/>
process with you. Talk with them about wanting to learn how to <br/>
figure out these kinds of disputes *better* - not in the sense <br/>
of &quot;you guys need to learn this&quot; but &quot;Hey, I&#39;d like us all to get <br/>
along better but I&#39;m having trouble learning how to do that...&quot; Thus <br/>
you become their partner, rather than their teacher.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This so much depends on the kid - my dd goes away from people when <br/>
she is upset to cool down. She always has, even as a baby she would <br/>
turn away and prefer to be put down. But that&#39;s *her* natural <br/>
tendency, not something I&#39;ve imposed on her. My experience with my <br/>
stepson, when he lived with us as a child, was that time-outs led <br/>
him to stuff down his feelings, rather than deal with them. I don&#39;t <br/>
recommend it. Punishment is seductive, bc kids do change their <br/>
*behavior* as a result, but also shuts down communication big time, <br/>
no matter how much we talk about feelings and solutions afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
The biggest overall solution I&#39;ve found to handling disputes between <br/>
kids, siblings and others, is to be more present with the kids. It <br/>
means finding other ways to meet some of my own needs, especially in <br/>
the short term, but it also means much more consensual interactions, <br/>
and that&#39;s worth a lot to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69366553">Yes, I am fortunate to have a child who did not respond to time <br/>
outs.  He really helped me search for alternatives.  My second DS (5)<br/>
would fall on the ground and scream and cry and refuse to go to time <br/>
out.  Then he would refuse to stay there screaming and crying the <br/>
whole time.  He would hit me.  He was very threatened by the whole <br/>
thing.  And it never worked to calm him down.  I am so glad we don&#39;t <br/>
have those battles anymore. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in an authoritarian home where we were spanked.  So to me, <br/>
TO were a milder, more acceptable form of punishment.  But even my <br/>
oldest DS who seemed to respond well to TO built up a lot of anger <br/>
and resentment and insecurity that we are still working through.  <br/>
Having no punishment seemed scarey at first.  I was afraid I would <br/>
lose control.  Now I&#39;m so glad I did lose control.  Because it was <br/>
just an illusion of control anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Naomi Aldort talks about punishment in her book.  She says any <br/>
behavior a child has that we think is wrong or bad, represents an <br/>
unmet need.  Putting a stop to that behavior doesn&#39;t address that <br/>
unmet need.  So it shows up somewhere else -- like crying over every <br/>
little thing or aggression or fears or all kinds of things that many <br/>
people say are normal parts of childhood.  Ironically some of those <br/>
things are what we put children into TO for.<br/>
<br/>
My second DS is much calmer these days.  He has even learned to <br/>
verbalize his feelings.  He still has times when he sets his mind on <br/>
something and nothing on God&#39;s green earth will change it.  I listen <br/>
to him if he needs to cry or talk about it.  I do what I can to help <br/>
him meet his needs.  When there is nothing that can be done to make <br/>
him happy, I tell him I will listen to him if he needs to talk or <br/>
cry about it.  My oldest son has responded well to just talking and <br/>
being honest.  He still tries to hurt his brother.  When they have <br/>
an argument, I stand very close in case I need to get between them.  <br/>
I tried just letting them work it out, but my oldest was too <br/>
aggressive and my younger ds will take a beating from him rather <br/>
than give in.  I don&#39;t let them fight it out anymore.  Inevitably <br/>
someone gets hit or kicked occasionally but I think it hurts their <br/>
feelings more than anything else.  I try to stay out of the argument <br/>
as much as possible.  With my 2 year olds I try to put words to what <br/>
they are screaming at each other about.  Sometimes just hearing what <br/>
the other person is trying to communicate helps them solve their own <br/>
problem.  I occasionally do this with the older kids too.  Their <br/>
arguments can get loud and sound horrible but it only lasts for a <br/>
short time.  It&#39;s not long before they figure out something that <br/>
works for them and happily move along.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to elaborate on my previous post.  It was rushed and <br/>
may have sounded insensitive.  I have so much respect for every <br/>
mother out there who has the courage to try and do something better <br/>
for their family.  And I know it can feel vulnerable to put your <br/>
personal story on the list for comment and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and love, Rachel (unschooling mother of 4)<br/>

want the family tv.  Sometimes I think it&#39;s more about winning than it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787498147">Rotfl...yes, my second child taught me a lot about parenting, and how traditional parenting <br/>
does not work with untraditional kids! When I&#39;m struggling with harder behaviors, I <br/>
remember to say a mantra of thanks, because without this we&#39;d still be spanking and no&#39;ing <br/>
and time outing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Just because it *worked* with the other kids does not make it appropriate, yes? My kids too <br/>

don&#39;t recall. They had been asking for things all morning, food, games, art supplies. When I <br/>
said &#39;well, sure, help yourselves&#39;, they groaned and yelled &quot;NO! You&#39;re supposed to say NO!&quot; <br/>
Apparently they had just finished a Captain Underpants book and you were supposed to do <br/>
something to get in trouble. That was interesting.<br/>
