<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744188594"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; He won&#39;t learn to be less sensitive by being bullied.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right.  I&#39;m printing out everyone&#39;s post to show to DH.&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t see any reason to leave him in school. In spite of health<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; issues you might have, would he not be happier at home?Yes, he would!  (My heart is breaking...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Time to look at your son, not bend to pressure from school officials,<br/>
&gt;&gt; other parents or anyone else. Your son needs to trust you to help him<br/>
&gt;&gt; be happy.That&#39;s why I think unschooling is so good.  Thanks for all the wonderful reminders,and thanks for taking the time to read through my posts -- I really appreciate it!Shelley<br/>
