<div id="ygrps-yiv-778953795">I was going to reply about &#39;getting out the calculator&#39;, to say I would<br/>
explain to your daughter that the calculator may be the easier way to go<br/>
about impressing her neighbors, but that the &#39;easier&#39; way is not always the<br/>
best (does she really want to memorize some math problems and there answers?<br/>
what will that prove, to whom? I think these are valid questions to have<br/>
even a 7 y.o. think about)<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized the point of your post was about reading, and you say they<br/>
WANT to learn to read. So, to be able to help you I guess my first questions<br/>
to you would be about the specifics of where your daughters are in the<br/>
continuum of reading development. Do they know their alphabet? Recognize<br/>
individual letter sounds? Consonant sounds only? Short vowel sounds? Do they<br/>
know that a single vowel can stand for different sounds depending on what&#39;s<br/>
next to it (among other things)? Do they enjoy being read to? Can they<br/>
follow along word by word when they&#39;re read to? And so on and on! I could<br/>
ask a lot more specific questions such as this, but my point is, the more<br/>
you tell about where each of them are, the easier it would be to see what<br/>
the next step is, and in my opinion, helping children learn to read (as<br/>
helping them with lots of other things, including math) has a lot to do with<br/>
meeting them where they&#39;re at and holding their hand as they climb to the<br/>
next step, so to speak. Does that make sense?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333338495">Simon is 10 (will be 11 in 2 and a bit weeks) and he isn&#39;t really reading yet. He is working on it, and there is a lot of pleasure and excitement in him to have the words decode, but he isn&#39;t fluent. I wouldn&#39;t class him as a reader. Linnaea, who just turned 8, has been reading since she was 6. There was nothing different, really, noticeably, in their environment. Just a variation in nature. I wouldn&#39;t worry. But, then, I did my worrying a while ago and now, well, Simon is so amazing in so many ways, and reading hasn&#39;t limited him in the ways it limits both Linnaea and me. When we play games Simon can find things much more quickly than either Linnaea and I as we wait for the text to give us the clues. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015577447">I usually don&#39;t answer many of these, but this is one I can do :0).  Jordan, my 15yo ds really dislikes reading.  He always has, since learning in public school, starting in K.  They were both in public school until the 4th grade.  He will read if he has to.  He wanted his hunting license so he studied and read, passed with flying colors.  He wants to get his license and his GED, he is reading and studying for both.  But he will not read just for the love of reading.<br/>
Skylor, my 14yo dd loves to read since learning in 1st grade. Since she learned to read she has been going non-stop.  Once she decides on a subject or an author she goes to it full force.  She found and purchased the entire Nancy Drew set and has read them all repeatedly.   She is also interested in getting her GED early and is studying and reading for it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131079134">Reading:  My first born started reading around age two or younger.<br/>
This was due to me placing common words in big red print all over <br/>
the house and playing games with her.  It was lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
My step-daughter learned to read at age five, in the slide in camper<br/>
as we traveled from Florida to Alaska.  She loved playing the Nintendo64<br/>
we installed but couldn&#39;t read a word at the begining of the trip.  By the <br/>
time we got home, she was a full fledged reader.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest learned to read with hooked on phonics around<br/>
four or five. He knew some words earlier like helicoptor but it was the <br/>
HOP computer program that really kicked up his reading interest.<br/>
(He&#39;s been into computers & games ever since.)  I didn&#39;t know just<br/>
how good he read until I pulled him out of school and found that they<br/>
had tested him at the end of first grade and he was reading above an<br/>
eighth grade level.<br/>
<br/>
My point?  Each child has their own triggers and what works for one <br/>
doesn&#39;t always work for the other.  The trick is to not force the issue<br/>
yet find interesting things that make reading intriguing for that child.<br/>
For some it&#39;s comics, for some it&#39;s video games, for some it&#39;s signs<br/>
along the road.  If they have no reason to read, they probably won&#39;t<br/>
desire to read.  If you read, chances are they will too.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found the most interesting, is the kids I know who are forced<br/>
to read, hate it the most.  Lead by example.<br/>
<br/>
Peace & laughter,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674583847">My boys are night and day with reading.  My oldest turned 20 this  <br/>
year.  He started early and caught on quickly in kindergarten (we  <br/>
started homeschooling in first grade).  He loved books out of the  <br/>
womb and still does to this day.  My youngest on the other hand is  <br/>
about to turn 15.  He&#39;s never liked books/reading.  We read to him  <br/>
when he was little and still do but he could take it or leave it most  <br/>
of the time.  He&#39;s just not a book type of guy.  I worry about it  <br/>
sometimes.  He&#39;s never read a full chapter book in his life.  Video  <br/>
games has helped improve his skills as he is motivated to read in  <br/>
that setting.  Sometimes I panic and want to give him reading  <br/>
&quot;assignments&quot; but I rarely follow through.  When I have it&#39;s been  <br/>
short lived.  We are almost always reading a book together which  <br/>
means I read aloud to him.  We&#39;ve also discovered books on tape  <br/>
recently.  Together we listened to the first Harry Potter book while  <br/>
he played WOW and I would either crochet or play my own Internet  <br/>
games.  It&#39;s going to be interesting next year when it&#39;s time to get  <br/>
his license.  He will need to study the book and take a test.   <br/>
Course... that&#39;s an entire year from now.  A lot can happen between  <br/>
now and then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679846501">Rainy learned when he was about 7 1/2.He was 4 when he wanted to learn <br/>
and we started with Bob books and some phonics. He liked doing the <br/>
books ,but he didn&#39;t really get it until 7 1/2. Now he reads everything!<br/>
Phoenix was not interested in reading at all until about age 8.He <br/>
learned pretty quickly though. Tia is 7 now and often asks how to write <br/>
things,but rarely reads. Interestingly, the boys don&#39;t write anything <br/>
unless they really need to, but Tia writes just for the fun of it all <br/>
the time. For my kids, the most important thing is that it&#39;s something <br/>
they really want to read.<br/>

I get freaked out about where my DS 14 is.  This time of year I begin  <br/>
to think about what we&#39;re going to do next school year.  I know... a  <br/>
sure sign that I&#39;m not de-schooled.  I suppose that&#39;s why I am  <br/>
immersing myself in unschool reading at the moment.  At 14 almost 15  <br/>
he struggles with reading and writing.  It worries me.  I find myself  <br/>
thinking about what we&#39;re going to do ... how are we going to get him  <br/>
where he needs to be.  And then I catch myself because  I realize  <br/>
he&#39;s right where he &quot;needs&quot; to be ... and I &quot;need&quot; to meet him where  <br/>
he is.  He is where he is ... he is who he is.  This gives me a sense  <br/>
of relief on one hand ... but on the other I know that I could be  <br/>
doing better by him ... like in &quot;strewing his path&quot;.  I&#39;ve just been  <br/>
so darned brain dead ... I am tapped out of ideas.  I&#39;m confident,  <br/>
though, that it will come as I continue to de-school and relax.  In  <br/>
the mean time DS continues to brilliantly play WOW, play his drums,  <br/>
and when the weather is nice he&#39;s out biking or playing airsoft.<br/>

something wrong with her or that she&#39;s not working hard enough. It  <br/>
will come when it comes. Yes, it&#39;s frustrating! Lots of kids try for  <br/>
hours to ride a bike when they want and they just aren&#39;t  <br/>
developmentally ready. Then the next summer, a few minutes and  <br/>
they&#39;re up riding.<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t learn until she&#39;s *developmentally* ready, until all the  <br/>
brain areas that are needed to decode for reading are matured.<br/>
<br/>
She does, though, need pleasant experiences with the printed word  <br/>
before she&#39;s developmentally ready, just as we need to speak to kids  <br/>
before they&#39;re ready to understand our words.<br/>

keep adding to it. I would focus there rather than on her perceived  <br/>
deficiencies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Both WANT to learn to read so the desire is there.  How did your  <br/>
&gt; kids learn to read and when?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know when my daughter could read but it was difficult for her  <br/>
when she was younger so she didn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t until she was 11 or so  <br/>
that she actually picked up a book to read for pleasure. (It&#39;s a  <br/>
common story! That kids don&#39;t read books on their own until they  <br/>
discover some adult level book that hooks them. Very common is  <br/>
Stephen King ;-) Hers was Janet Evanovich.)<br/>
<br/>
I think Pam Sorooshian recommended a book that was about reading  <br/>
strategies a while ago, how looking at pictures was part of reading  <br/>
and so on. I can&#39;t seem to find the title.<br/>

saying that a parent should do nothing except go about their business <br/>
and when a child is deveopmentally ready they will just read because <br/>
they are surrounded by print? What about a kid who sees a workbook <br/>

ready will read.  I&#39;m disagreeing  with the implication that there&#39;s no use<br/>
in figuring out *where* in that development continuum a child is, that they<br/>
may not benefit from &quot;hand-holding&quot; (ad opposed to &quot;pushing&quot;) them through<br/>
the next developmental step. An analogy would be an infant taking their<br/>
first steps, &quot;cruising&quot; by supporting themselves to furniture. This is a<br/>
common developmental step between not walking, and walking on their own. The<br/>
role of providing the furniture (and perhaps getting the sharp corner of<br/>
that glass coffee table out of the way, to stretch the analogy) is what I<br/>
believe the adults should be for the emerging reader. You can call it<br/>
teaching if you want, I see it more as facilitating, supporting. Yes,<br/>
without it, the child will probably eventually still get up and start<br/>
walking on their own. But if the parents see that there&#39;s a way to make it a<br/>
little bit easier and less frustrating for the child that&#39;s stuck and WANTS<br/>
to get up, what&#39;s the harm in helping them by showing them how? Did you ever<br/>
bend over to let an infant grasp your fingers for balance while taking a few<br/>
steps? If you did, you know the joy of that shared experience. I believe<br/>
it&#39;s the same  with reading: It won&#39;t do any good to try and help at a<br/>
certain step the child is not ready for (which is, by the way, why schools<br/>
don&#39;t work!) But when you bother to observe and listen to your child and<br/>
find out exactly where it is they are, there are things you CAN do (indirect<br/>
things, such as answer a question, strew their paths, and other things such<br/>
as have been talked about on this board in the past) other than sit back and<br/>
let them figure it out.<br/>

I would ask you the same questions about where exactly in the developmental<br/>
reading continuum your son is at. NOT for you to *worry about*, but just as<br/>
information you can use to help him. You said &quot;he struggles with reading and<br/>
writing&quot;. So is he getting stuck due to a lack of fluency? The fact that<br/>
it&#39;s writing as well as reading makes me think it&#39;s not a comprehension<br/>
issue but more of a &quot;putting sounds together/taking them apart&quot; issue. You<br/>
mentioned he shines at WoW, so I assume he&#39;s intelligent in the sense that<br/>
he can think logically and understand complex patterns, etc. What is his<br/>
oral language like? I mean, does he tend to speak in short sentences, does<br/>
he have a rich vocabulary, does he have a sense of flow when he talks about<br/>
events that have happened, etc, etc. At this point I would focus on his<br/>
writing since at his age he probably has things to say (well, every age does<br/>
of course, but I haven&#39;t yet met a teenager without strong opinions! :)<br/>
Also, through improving his writing, his reading will improve. So, what is<br/>
it about his writing that demoralizes him so as not to want to keep trying?<br/>
For kids that struggle with handwriting an obvious way to circumvent that<br/>
would be to encourage him to type on the computer, with the explicit goal of<br/>
improving his writing (IF that is his goal...you mentioned being<br/>
concerned...is he??? I should have asked this first right at the top of the<br/>
post! Because if it&#39;s a case of &quot;bringing a horse to water...&quot; you could be<br/>
spinning your wheels in the air here!)<br/>
See, facilitating someone&#39;s learning IMO takes more than just not worrying<br/>
too much (although that is a fundamental aspect of it! Worry tends to block<br/>
what we can do to help!) It&#39;s first knowing that the horse is thirsty so to<br/>
speak :) and then clearing the path between the horse and the river, which<br/>
means standing right next to the horse and looking at the ground he&#39;ll be<br/>
stepping on, one step at a time, to see what kind of rocks, holes in the<br/>
ground, and quicksand is in the way...OK, NOW I&#39;ve taken that analogy too<br/>
far! :) Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; in my opinion, helping children learn to read (as<br/>
&gt; &gt; helping them with lots of other things, including math) has a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt; meeting them where they&#39;re at and holding their hand as they climb<br/>

&gt; Funny, I was thinking of this very thing earlier today. Occasionally<br/>
&gt; I get freaked out about where my DS 14 is. This time of year I begin<br/>
&gt; to think about what we&#39;re going to do next school year. I know... a<br/>
&gt; sure sign that I&#39;m not de-schooled. I suppose that&#39;s why I am<br/>
&gt; immersing myself in unschool reading at the moment. At 14 almost 15<br/>
&gt; he struggles with reading and writing. It worries me. I find myself<br/>
&gt; thinking about what we&#39;re going to do ... how are we going to get him<br/>
&gt; where he needs to be. And then I catch myself because I realize<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s right where he &quot;needs&quot; to be ... and I &quot;need&quot; to meet him where<br/>
&gt; he is. He is where he is ... he is who he is. This gives me a sense<br/>
&gt; of relief on one hand ... but on the other I know that I could be<br/>
&gt; doing better by him ... like in &quot;strewing his path&quot;. I&#39;ve just been<br/>
&gt; so darned brain dead ... I am tapped out of ideas. I&#39;m confident,<br/>
&gt; though, that it will come as I continue to de-school and relax. In<br/>
&gt; the mean time DS continues to brilliantly play WOW, play his drums,<br/>
&gt; and when the weather is nice he&#39;s out biking or playing airsoft.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I don&#39;t think Joyce would advocate &quot;do nothing except go about  <br/>
their business.&quot; That might be considered the antithesis of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;when a child is developmentally ready&quot; is true. And there&#39;s a  <br/>
grain of truth in &quot;they will just read because they are surrounded by  <br/>
print.&quot; I&#39;d say that was true for my daughter. But &quot;surrounded by  <br/>
print&quot; almost sounds like you&#39;re thinking that plunking them in a  <br/>
library and hoping they&#39;ll read what&#39;s in it, eventually, is what  <br/>
we&#39;re talking about. It isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote about our experience, but hadn&#39;t sent yet:<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
Dd showed signs of &quot;reading readiness&quot; around 7 or 8.  Other than my  <br/>
dh freaking out for a short while and trying to get her to sound out  <br/>
words (which she rightly refused to do) instead of just providing the  <br/>
word she was asking about, we just kept reading to her. She liked us  <br/>
to read stories (fiction/history), but preferred to look at non- <br/>
fiction books herself (mostly about animals). I&#39;m sure she was reading  <br/>
at least some of what was in those books then, but she didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
declare herself a reader until she, herself, felt competent.<br/>
<br/>
Her reading began to take off when she started playing Zoo Tycoon and  <br/>
similar computer games. To &quot;get to the next level,&quot; she had to figure  <br/>
words out. I was available if she wanted to know a certain word, but  <br/>
eventually, she worked it out herself. It was kind of seamless; in  <br/>
other words, there was no specific date that she was officially  <br/>
&quot;reading.&quot; But I&#39;d say she was reading with fluency and comprehension  <br/>
between the ages of 10 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
Computer games, Nintendo DS games, Neopets, Webkinz, MMORPGs, strategy  <br/>
guides, books, magazines, TV, Pokemon and other cards, manga, Betty  <br/>
and Veronica comics, Calvin & Hobbes books, ZooBooks, Which Way USA  <br/>
maps are just some of the &quot;tools&quot; she used to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
She *has* always been surrounded by print in our house.  We are  <br/>
readers ourselves, we own a lot of books and magazines, we use our  <br/>
computers.  My dh is a race car driver, but has written 7 books on the  <br/>
subject. I&#39;m a former sports magazine reporter and currently working  <br/>
on an editing certificate. Words (and reading) mean something to us,  <br/>
for sure.<br/>
<br/>
So, we just &quot;bathed her in words&quot; from birth. But she learned to read  <br/>
when *she* was ready. Mostly, she learned because she wanted to, in  <br/>
order to do what she wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
If your child really wants to do a workbook, go for it. Don&#39;t have a  <br/>
lot of expectations around it, though (like &quot;finishing&quot; it). It might  <br/>
just be fun practice for a short period of time for the child. Let it  <br/>
be a step amongst many.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Asking what an &quot;f&quot; looks like or &quot;how do you write horse&quot; both seem  <br/>
designed to test a child&#39;s knowledge or skill. I recommend against  <br/>
that (see above &quot;sounding out&quot; fiasco, which in my dd&#39;s case, stopped  <br/>
her from wanting anything to do with reading for a while).<br/>
<br/>
You *can* point things out as a matter of course - while you are  <br/>
reading to your child, for instance. Make it fun. But stop if you get  <br/>
resistance. If I saw my dd&#39;s eyes glaze over while I was showing her  <br/>
something &quot;neat&quot; (it was to me), that was a big clue. &quot;Keep reading,  <br/>
mum&quot; was another &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943801747">A nice book that documents how a child learns to read all by himself is  <br/>
&quot;Gnys at Work&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
So many of John Holt&#39;s books talk about letting a child learn to read at  <br/>
their own pace, too.<br/>
 <br/>
All that really needs to be done is to answer the questions the child asks;  <br/>
and read to them.  They don&#39;t even need to be corrected in their  spelling.  <br/>
They will use &quot;inventive spelling&quot; once they learn what  words/letters sound <br/>
like.  Then, when they are reading on their own, they  will catch their own <br/>
&quot;misspellings&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Some children are ready to read at 4 and others may not be ready to learn  <br/>
until they are 9.  Their is such a wide range; and that is why school does  not <br/>
work.  It tries to teach all children to read at the same  time.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is 5.  He loves numbers, but could care less about  letters.  He is <br/>
adding, subtracting, counting by multiples. But, when he  sees a letter, he has <br/>
not interest.  He &quot;reads&quot; the makes of cars by  the emblems on the cars; and <br/>
&quot;reads&quot; numbers everywhere.  So, in his  own unique way, he is reading what is <br/>
important to him.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now, a friend of his learned to read at 5.  She is reading fluently  very <br/>
large words.  She does not care about numbers.  So each child is  so different <br/>
and unique.<br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy this journey.  The growing mind is such a fascinating, awesome  thing <br/>
to just sit back watch, and answer questions when asked.<br/>

games on the computer as toddlers.  They just had lots of fun.  I&#39;ll <br/>
admit that when we actually started homeschooling, before I learned <br/>
about unschooling, I pushed when I shouldn&#39;t have.  I tried to do <br/>

just let them be.  I remember my youngest daughter loved for me to <br/>
make dotted letters and words so she could trace them.  But she knew <br/>
what she wanted me to write.  My son loved to narrate stories <br/>
(books, tv shows, and imagination) while I wrote them down because <br/>
he hated writing.  I just followed their leads.  :)<br/>

remember in 4th or 5th grade he got in trouble in school for <br/>
bringing a Stephen King book to read during their quiet reading <br/>
time. The teacher actually told both of us that he could not have <br/>
the book in the classroom because it was too scary even though she <br/>
hadn&#39;t even read it. It was one of King&#39;s milder books. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the title now but it was about a girl who loved baseball <br/>
who got lost in the woods. Oh yea, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I <br/>
believe. Harry Potter is at least as scary and violent, probably <br/>
more so, but that was ok. I couldn&#39;t believe it. He was 10 or 11 and <br/>
reading an adult level book and his teacher forbid it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784800072">~~I would ask you the same questions about where exactly in the<br/>
developmental reading continuum your son is at.~~<br/>
<br/>
There is no pre-set continuum. That&#39;s a myth. Some people seem to pick<br/>
things up in increments that look like school. Most don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Jared (14) learned to read at the age of 12. There was no obvious<br/>
continuum for him that was visible to anyone else. To try and figure<br/>
that out would have invaded his comfort and space. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
good advice to tell parents to figure out where on the &quot;continuum&quot;<br/>
their child is if unschooling is going to blossom.<br/>
<br/>
You know what your child knows and doesn&#39;t know...until they know<br/>
something new and different. So understanding that a child knows<br/>
his/her a,b,c&#39;s will help how? Understanding that they can recognize a<br/>
few words helps how? <br/>
<br/>
Being comfortable with natural learning includes letting go of the<br/>
idea that kids will learn things in any way resembling school. Jared<br/>
never learned the alphabet sounds, never sounded words out and helping<br/>
him figure those things out would have only impeded him. I know this<br/>
because a couple times when he was frustrated over not being able to<br/>
read we tried pointing out a few things. It doesn&#39;t work that way for him.<br/>
<br/>
He learned words by recognizing the entire word. He slowly had enough<br/>
symbols (entire words) that were recognizable to where he could read. <br/>
<br/>
Every person learns so very differently.  A child that wants to grasp<br/>
letter sounds and word sounds will not leave you alone for asking!<br/>
&quot;What sound does this make?&quot; will probably be a common question for a<br/>
very long time. Reading to kids and for kids, making your home print<br/>
rich and trusting time are really all you need.<br/>
<br/>
Some children may be more determined to figure it out. They will ask<br/>
questions, you can be a resource. When the questions stop, you stop.<br/>
Trust sometimes means that you help  them be comfortable with where<br/>
they are today, rather than jump on every frustration as a reason to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; them anything.<br/>

it&#39;s a nice pastime but they are not working.I know this is not what I <br/>
want to believe, and logically I don&#39;t,but the feelings are there.Yes, <br/>
too much schooling in my head (or heart!).<br/>

Thankyou so much for the comment about teaching versus learning.We are so new to unschooling and are trying to figure it all out...When someone makes something that seems like a complicated idea seem simple it can help a lot,<br/>

unschooling. Tying unschooling to a word that *also* means pushing  <br/>

of putting information in that they think is important and embracing  <br/>
the idea of supporting children&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
What if they don&#39;t joyously pull it in?<br/>
<br/>
Why is the mom holding the information in front of the child?<br/>
<br/>
(No need to answer on list. Those are just ideas to turn over.)<br/>
<br/>
Much better *for understanding unschooling* is Sandra Dodd&#39;s concept  <br/>
of stewing. Exposing kids to cool things. Leave things out that kids  <br/>
can find. Take kids cool places that you think they&#39;ll enjoy. (Not  <br/>
places you think it would be great if they enjoyed. Try to avoid a  <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; agenda.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That comes naturally. No parent needs to figure out &quot;*where* in that  <br/>
development continuum a child is&quot;. Holding out a finger is equivalent  <br/>
to noticing a child is reading &quot;bed&quot; as &quot;bead&quot; and pointing it out.  <br/>
And even that, we don&#39;t need to do each time. It&#39;s a case by case  <br/>
basis. Depends on the child&#39;s personality too. (So don&#39;t go to one  <br/>
extreme and never do it nor the other extreme and always do it.)<br/>
<br/>
The most profound learning happens when people make the connections  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
All of:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do they know their alphabet? Recognize<br/>
&gt; individual letter sounds? Consonant sounds only? Short vowel  <br/>
&gt; sounds? Do they<br/>

&gt; on what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; next to it (among other things)? Do they enjoy being read to? Can they<br/>
&gt; follow along word by word when they&#39;re read to? And so on and on!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is way too much analysis to help a child. *Much* better is to use  <br/>
powers of observation to figure out what the child is doing and what  <br/>
they&#39;re asking. Throw away school benchmarks. Look at your child.<br/>
<br/>
As was pointed out, recognizing individual letter sounds was useless  <br/>
to some children. Also, as was pointed out, lots of kids pick up  <br/>
reading by absorbing whole words. A parent going through that  <br/>
checklist will be looking outside their child for what the child  <br/>
&quot;should&quot; do rather than looking at the child and what they can do and  <br/>
want to do. To help your child figure out the world in their own  <br/>
unique way, know your child, not some checklist (that quite possibly  <br/>
has nothing to do with your child.)<br/>
<br/>
On an assembly line, it&#39;s important to check off the processes the  <br/>
teacher needs to run her product through in order to demonstrate to  <br/>
the authorities that learning is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
At home, neither the order is important nor the checklist itself.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest barrier to unschooling of this suggestion is  <br/>
creating the image in parents&#39; minds that a child&#39;s reading could be  <br/>
blocked for months and months with reading because they haven&#39;t  <br/>
picked up &quot;short vowel sounds&quot; or &quot;consonant sounds&quot;. While certainly  <br/>
imaginable, does it happen with real unschooled children?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really pretty much impossible for a child to be stuck in that  <br/>
state in a natural environment. The information is there. When  <br/>
they&#39;re ready to absorb it, it may take a couple of days for the  <br/>
&quot;Aha!&quot; to hit, but hit it will. (Unschoolers  can infer the truth of  <br/>
that from the fact that their teens read just fine :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another barrier is creating the image of children being stuck because  <br/>
one piece of information is missing. Again, imaginable. Again, does  <br/>
it happen? It&#39;s way too much worry to place on a parent that their  <br/>
child&#39;s learning is being blocked by a piece of information. It won&#39;t  <br/>
help the parent relax into understanding that children are born to  <br/>
learn. It won&#39;t help parents create a peaceful environment. It will  <br/>
fill it full of worry.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has a problem recognizing individual letter sounds -- and  <br/>
no unschooling parent should be testing to see if this is true! -- or  <br/>
any sticking point people naturally go through, much better to play  <br/>
games, read poetry, read books, write lists. (Assuming the child  <br/>
wants to!) Create a rich environment so that the information is there  <br/>
for the child to puzzle out.<br/>
<br/>
If someone sees an opportunity to hold out their finger to a child  <br/>
who would like that finger, absolutely do so! If a child is holding  <br/>
the hammer by the heavy end, they&#39;d probably appreciate showing them  <br/>
which way is more useful. (But step back if they turn it back around  <br/>
again!) But there&#39;s no need to find checklists of skills. Kids will  <br/>
figure it out. We just need to be there to help in support of their  <br/>
quest.<br/>

In unschooling writing should be for the purpose of writing for  <br/>
whatever the child needs it for, not for the purpose of reading.<br/>

To get unschooling flowing, it will help to not even think in those  <br/>

While I think some of what you&#39;re saying is what unschooling parents  <br/>
will end up doing -- encourage typing instead of handwriting if a  <br/>
child picked up in school some how that typing isn&#39;t writing -- too  <br/>
much focus is on parents divining problems and coming up with  <br/>
solutions. For the purpose of helping parents help their kids  <br/>
unschool, there&#39;s too much focus on the problem, too much focus on  <br/>
the parent as fixer, and not enough on helping the child help  <br/>
himself. (Which is a much more useful skill in the long run!)<br/>
<br/>
What Shileen wrote was very much unschooling thought:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And then I catch myself because  I realize he&#39;s right where he  <br/>
&quot;needs&quot; to be ... and I &quot;need&quot; to meet him where he is.  He is where  <br/>
he is ... he is who he is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At 14 almost 15<br/>

bring those goals here. People might have some ideas for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328451560">I am not sure what the original poster meant, but I took the asking what an &quot;f&quot; looks like or how to spell something as the CHILD asking. In that case do you think that is pushing? <br/>
My dd does this ALL the time (well words that is, now). She seems to have figured out letters and will put them into words and have me tell her what they are. Sometimes this is a fun feat for my husband and I.<br/>
I hadn&#39;t really thought about it much, but it seems we are in the beginning of reading or maybe the middle? I am not exactly sure, lol. I guess it really &quot;starts&quot; at birth.<br/>
Our story with reading so far (she is 4 almost 5) is that she has always loved books. We read everyday for hours. Sometimes she reads alone for hours depending on what she wants to do. She has most of our short books memorized. In my opinion that is the beginning of reading. She points out words she knows all of the time. She learned to write her full name a couple of years ago just because she wanted too. LOL. She likes to write little stories and notes to us a lot. If she doesn&#39;t know how to spell something, she asks. Sometimes she wants me to write it down for her to copy, sometimes she wants me to tell her the letters and she can write them alone. I always ask what she wants. <br/>
So I don&#39;t know where exactly that puts us on learning to read (and I don&#39;t really care either I guess) it is just something she really loves so we go for it. No different than the interest in fish, dinosaurs, Polly pockets, Barbie&#39;s, and webkinz. <br/>
BTW Webkinz was mentioned before, it is an amazing reading &quot;tool&quot;. My did can tell you what anything says on there (other than the quizzes). <br/>
So I don&#39;t really have any experience with older children and reading, but my advice is when they are ready it will happen. Kind of like potty training:)!! LOL.<br/>
Back to the original reason I responded, what do you guys think &quot;is&quot; pushing? Answering your children&#39;s questions is just natural and the basis of unschooling to my knowledge. I am assuming that you are talking about the parent &quot;quizzing&quot; the child, but I just want to clarify so I can rethink my position if not:)!!!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Jess:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915863591">my dd (now 11) started writing long before she was reading on her own.<br/>
We never did the alphabet in any traditional way. She asked I told<br/>
her. She would ask what the symbols were or I might point out<br/>
something cool. Like &quot;fancy&quot; writing (script) because she thought it<br/>
was neat. She would write stories while I helped her spell things out.<br/>
Once, I asked her to look it up (my mothers idea, lol) and she just<br/>
looked at me like I was nuts and said I don&#39;t even know how to start.<br/>
I asked her did she want me to show her but she didn&#39;t (a few years<br/>
later she asked me how). She invented her own spellings, which are now<br/>
so precious to look at, totally unintelligible :-) but she could read<br/>
them at the time. She loved to have me read to her. Everything books,<br/>
signs, scraps of things. Once we were reading The Neverending Story<br/>
and I picked it up where we left off and she said to skip to another<br/>
part she had read that already. Well, that was the first I knew! From<br/>
then on she read. The first book she read was HP3 or 4. She was<br/>
somewhere in the seventh year.<br/>
ds5 has no interest in reading, infrequently does he want to be read<br/>
to, and only non-fiction and Captain Underpants.<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can teach anyone to read (or anything for that<br/>
matter). You learn things when you are ready.<br/>
