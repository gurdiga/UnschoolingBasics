<div id="ygrps-yiv-720524942">Thanks for all of the responses...lots of food for thought...a funny <br/>
side note with the Austin Powers...my 3 year old was informed by the <br/>
older ones that there is a character named &quot;Allotta Fagina&quot; and in our <br/>
house things are what they are...vagina, penis, etc...so my children <br/>
have been &quot;playing&quot; Austin Powers using their spy gadgets and stuff and <br/>
my 3 year old daughter loves running around declaring herself Allotta <br/>
Bagina!<br/>
What a hoot...(and she&#39;s naked too, which is her daily outfit, even <br/>
while the snow accumulates outside!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the ones who mentioned why I would think my kids would remember <br/>
the penis enlarger and the fembots over any other ones...well...you were <br/>
half right...my fault for drawing attention to those scenes in the first <br/>
place because the first time we watched it with them I had my husband <br/>
fast forward during the penis enlargement scene...my oldest (8) <br/>
immediately asked what we were doing and we just said it was a boring <br/>
part that they wouldn&#39;t miss...well...he wanted to see it anyway and so <br/>
we went back.  They didn&#39;t see what the big deal was and never paid it a <br/>
second thought...but how they do LOVE the fembots!  My 6 year old <br/>
daughter plays the fembot part and quite well, I might add.  She&#39;s such <br/>
an actress. <br/>
<br/>
This is all just me being brought up in a Catholic, very conservative <br/>
household now totally opposite and an atheist to boot...how time changes <br/>
everything ;-)  I would never have dared ask my mother any questions <br/>
about sex.  I want my kids to feel comfortable talking to me about <br/>
everything. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone...again and again... how I love unschooling and love <br/>
these lists!<br/>
