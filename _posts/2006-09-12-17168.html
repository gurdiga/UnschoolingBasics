<div id="ygrps-yiv-189804283">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you all know that we are now into our second week <br/>
of unschooling, and we are loving it.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is so much more relaxed, and we now just go with the <br/>
flow, instead of worrying about getting ready to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are really loving this.  They are in a safe, and comfortable <br/>
environment, and can have fun, and just enjoy life while they learn <br/>
about things they like.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, we went out shopping, did some gardening/yard work, met <br/>
their dad for a picnic during his lunch time, and went garage <br/>
saling.  Most of all, we just relaxed and had fun.<br/>
<br/>
This week, we went for a walk through the neighborhood, and noticed <br/>
how many houses were like ours, and how many were up for sale.  <br/>
Today, we are having a movie/game day.  The weather is kind of <br/>
yucky, so I&#39;m not sure we will get another walk in. <br/>
<br/>
The kids seem more loving towards each other, and when there is a <br/>
problem between them, instead of walking away angry, we work on how <br/>
things could be different, and how we can problem solve.  It has <br/>
really worked out well.<br/>
<br/>
My son and I talked about school (he brought it up), and I felt so <br/>
bad for the things he had to go through.  It really messed with his <br/>
self esteem.  Hopefully, we can bring it back up again in time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who have helped with suggestions and advice.  <br/>
It is really appreciated.  Please keep it coming.  Especially since <br/>
we are still new to this.  It is nice to have the freedom to do what <br/>
we want, when we want.  Life has changed for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great week, and thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
