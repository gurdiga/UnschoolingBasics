<div id="ygrps-yiv-814379141">Thank you all for your replies and welcome&#39;s regarding my posts<br/>
yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are how things went.  I told the children that we are on<br/>
&quot;vacation&quot; as Ren wisely said that I should do.  We had a WONDERFUL<br/>
day!  A few weeks ago something came on the Discovery Channel about<br/>
the Titanic and I asked Zak if he&#39;d like to watch the movie.  Titanic<br/>
with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet came in Netflix and BOTH of my<br/>
children LOVED the movie.  What a totally UNSCHOOLY movie with<br/>
Leonardo&#39;s character helping Winslets character learn how to live in<br/>
the moment and be free from the pressures and constraints of<br/>
conforming to class and peer pressure.  The whole time I&#39;m thinking,<br/>
&quot;Wow, this is the movie I needed today!&quot;  LOL, I don&#39;t believe in God<br/>
but boy, what a coincidence.  <br/>
<br/>
Our Zoo Newsletter came in the mail and Brooke wanted me to read that<br/>
to her.  She then invited me to come and read about Bottlenose<br/>
Dolphins on Zoo Tycoon, it was very informative.  She loves Zoo<br/>
Tycoon, I didn&#39;t make her play it, or make her read about the<br/>
dolphins, she just wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
And the absolute best part was...Zak is interested in Bonsai Trees and<br/>
also rock gardens.  We went to a nursery and turns out that the<br/>
husband of the wife we met has been a Bonsai artist for over 25 years.<br/>
 It started as a hobby and he turned his passion into a business. <br/>
Anyhoo, we met him briefly as he was on his way to a doctor<br/>
appointment.  His wife gave us a brief overview of Bonsai trees and<br/>
gave me a brochure for a Bonsai Club here in the area, tonight there<br/>
is a meeting and in January they are having a Bonsai master come to<br/>
town.  Then the nice woman said that her husband would SHOW Zachary<br/>
how to do the art of Bonsai.  Zak was beaming!  When we got to the car<br/>
I asked Zak if he wanted to go to the meeting to which he replied,<br/>
&quot;Yes!&quot;  Then I mentioned,&quot;You know, maybe in exchange for being able<br/>
to DO Bonsai trees with this man, we could offer to hand water the<br/>
plants at their nursery a couple of times a week.&quot;  Zak said that he<br/>
would love to do it.<br/>
<br/>
You all, we really didn&#39;t set out to intentionally learn anything<br/>
yesterday...it was our first deschooling day and everything sort of<br/>
just fell into our laps, so to speak.  :-)<br/>
