<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838077921">I&#39;ve tried, to no avail, to locate a recent thread that included a link<br/>
regarding unschooling with regards to partners.  I have to admit,<br/>
mindful parenting comes much easier than applying the philosophy to my<br/>
relationship with DH.  If someone would be so kind to repost where I can<br/>
find that info. I&#39;d really appreciate it.  And so would DH :0).  Thanks.<br/>

Yeah---that happens a lot when we don&#39;t change the subject line. Things <br/>
morph so much from post to post.<br/>
<br/>
I can recommend a yahoo group that focuses on applying the philosophy <br/>
to our spouses:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Peacefulpartnerships</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s run by radical unschooling parents, so the philosophy is pretty <br/>
set.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with spouses seems so much harder then with our children. I <br/>
don&#39;t post much there, but I spend a lot of time reading! Every little <br/>
bit helps! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
