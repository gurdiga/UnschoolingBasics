<div id="ygrps-yiv-340544792">Hi everyone! Im Kelly, 24 yrs old, sahm to Lilliana who is 4 almost 5 <br/>
(x-mas day) she would be starting kindergarden next year, if I wanted <br/>
her to go to a public school that is. But I dont, and I have made the <br/>
decision that she will be homeschooled no matter what. But the more I <br/>
learn about unschooling, the more I love it! I think that its right <br/>
up our alley. I mean, isnt that basically what we do with the kids <br/>
when they are younger, before school age? So I mean, I got this down <br/>
pact! lol Now Im trying to figure out the laws here in SC. Being new <br/>
to all of this the laws can be over-whelming and confusing! But Im <br/>
glad that I have started all this research now! <br/>
Anyways, Im glad that I was invited (thanks Ren!) and joined this <br/>
group!  I look forward to all the info that is shared here!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130119102">Hi Kelly!  Welcome to the group.<br/>
 <br/>
If you don&#39;t mind, where in SC are you?  I am in Beaufort.  It  seems like <br/>
most of the unschoolers are upstate and some in Columbia.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you know about the Live and Learn Conference in Charlotte this  Saturday?  <br/>
It might be a great intro. to unschooling for you.<br/>
