   2. Turn the key to the on position.<br/>
   3. Get someone to push the car for you, or, if you&#39;re lucky enough to<br/>
   be on a hill, just let it roll! (if your car is small enough, open the<br/>
   driver&#39;s door and push yourself, when it&#39;s up to a slow jog speed, jump in<br/>
   and ...)<br/>
   4. Once the car&#39;s rolling, let out the clutch and immediately give the<br/>
   car some gas. The engine should catch, and now you can drive it like you<br/>
   usually would. Just don&#39;t let it stall!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really fun, besides being important safety information. The kids asked<br/>
to push start even after I got a battery :D<br/>
Personally, I like doing it in Reverse :) It helps, too, if you&#39;ve got a<br/>
honda-like car instead of a cadillac-like car :D<br/>
