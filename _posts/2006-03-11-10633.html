<br/>
You children do not have the right to vote but they do have a voice. They<br/>
can talk to adults and their voice could reach through a closed mind. They<br/>
can write or dictate in their own words to an adult who could write on their<br/>
behalf to the right people. My son has written to congressmen about saving<br/>
the Cheaspeke Bay. He heard my brother and I talking about a new bill that<br/>
was passed and that I had just written letters encouraging grants to help<br/>
farmers use new plans to cut down on run off. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279772498">&lt;&lt;...we have a civic duty to bond together to use democracy to change the law.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that takes a tremendous amount of time and energy.  Something I don&#39;t have an excess of right now.  So I simply choose which laws I will follow knowing full well that if caught I would have to face the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the laws I don&#39;t follow:<br/>
<br/>
mandatory seatbelt law<br/>
speed limit (I might do 70 in a 65)<br/>
occassionally forge a doctor&#39;s signature (not a real doctor, just a scribble with an MD behind it for things like needing a medical exam for a non-strenuous youth activity)<br/>
sell raw milk to friends who ask for it (spend a lot of time discussing the pros and cons of pasteurization with people)<br/>
<br/>
These are laws that I see as personal choices rather than for the greater good.  The raw milk law is about money pure and simple (large dairies must pasteurize because their milk is old by the time it gets to the store, I sell it within 24 hours of being milked out).  Large dairies can pay for lobbyists, I don&#39;t have the time or energy to raise those kinds of funds or to raise that kind of awareness.<br/>
<br/>
So I do what I think is best for me and mine and leave it at that.  If other people are happy with the laws, they should follow them.<br/>

knowledge, selling raw milk is not against the law--at least not here <br/>
in Maine.  My ex-husband and I did it, his parents did it, and I know <br/>
of several dairy farms that sell directly from their bulk tank before <br/>
they ship it.  (Well that&#39;s against the law if they have a contract)  <br/>
But beyond that, I know of at least one local dairy that still <br/>
bottles, ships AND delivers their own UNpasteurized milk.  It has <br/>
been my experience that it is more difficult to educate people <br/>
regarding the pros and cons of pasteurization vs non because of the <br/>
propaganda (scare tactics) that have been pushed by big <br/>
comglomerates.  Like you said, I don&#39;t have the time or energy either.<br/>
<br/>
Public school has been used to indoctrinate so much into this <br/>
society, and to perpetuate so many myths, it is scary IMHO.  <br/>
(pasteurization, radon, and the list is endless.) And I don&#39;t have <br/>
much faith in the system either.  I have watched too many people run <br/>
around in circles trying to change things within the system to little <br/>
or no avail...It SEEMS like it was all set up to keep us busy, and <br/>
thinking we can make a change, but it is all just a diversion. (Not <br/>
that change CAN&#39;T be affected--it&#39;s just damned difficult)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385608681">Actually, you can sell raw milk in Texas IF you can get them to get you a license AND if you can afford it (several hundred dollars per year plus you have to pay to have them come inspect you).  We do it just like people who sell farm eggs and that is illegal.  We put milk in a fridge in the garage along with a money jar.  Milk disappears and money shows up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135485761">***You children do not have the right to vote but they do have a voice.<br/>
They<br/>
can talk to adults and their voice could reach through a closed mind.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not good enough.  <br/>
<br/>
Most children are not taken seriously by the adults in their lives.  They<br/>
are certainly not taken seriously by our society.   The evidence of this<br/>
is that they do not have a legal right to vote.  Our society does not<br/>
trust them to be informed enough, knowledgeable enough, experienced<br/>
enough, or serious enough. <br/>
  <br/>
It was not &quot;good enough&quot; that women could talk to their husbands.  Men<br/>
had the legal right to vote according to their own beliefs (or whims).  <br/>
If a woman/wife thought very differently than her husband on a political<br/>
matter it was unlikely he would forfeit his vote to afford her a say.  <br/>
If women had felt their husbands were representing them well enough they<br/>
would not have struggled so long and so hard for the right to vote.    <br/>
<br/>
It was not &quot;good enough&quot; that Black Americans might talk to sympathetic<br/>
friends.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems crazy to us today that our country once denied citizens the<br/>
right to vote based on gender or race but most of us don&#39;t think<br/>
seriously about our citizens who are denied rights based on their age.  <br/>

<br/>
On March 18, 2003, two days before her son launched the<br/>
invasion of Iraq, Barbara Bush appeared on Good Morning<br/>
America. Our nation&#39;s &quot;First Mother&quot; asked Diane<br/>
Sawyer, &quot;Why should we hear about body bags and death <br/>
and how many? . . . Oh, I mean, it&#39;s not relevant. So<br/>
why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like<br/>
that.&quot; <br/>
Like mother, like son.<br/>
