<div id="ygrps-yiv-545702517">Hi Karen,<br/>
It&#39;s Karen (from S.D this time!)  I just wanted to do a very quick reply to<br/>
this, and maybe you&#39;ve already thought of this, but wanted to share anyway.<br/>

like a mean thing to do.  Sage really didn&#39;t object, after all, to having<br/>
his diaper changed, he objected to leaving said activity to have his diaper<br/>
changed.  If I&#39;m trying to get him to come into the bathroom with me so I<br/>
can wipe him where *I think it&#39;s convenient, forget it.  So, I finally<br/>
learned (yes!  still learning!) to do it completely on his terms.  I soak<br/>
the cloths with warm water, and go to where he is.  While he plays or<br/>
watches tv, or whatever it is he&#39;s doing, I pull off the diaper, wipe him up<br/>
and he&#39;s done.  No coercion at all, he&#39;s happy to stand there, uninterrupted<br/>
in what he was doing, while I take care of the rest.  Win/Win!<br/>

She doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**And I even have a reply for this! :)  Right now we&#39;ve been kissed with the<br/>
gift of chicken pox in our house.  My 6yo (middle son) wants nothing to do<br/>
with ANY remedy or comforting solution I offer him.  But, I just keep<br/>
offering.  After all, he knows his body better than I know his body, and I<br/>
have to trust that if he really doesn&#39;t feel like taking an oatmeal bath, he<br/>
probably doesn&#39;t need one.  Day 1 of spots, he takes nothing.  Day 2 of<br/>
spots, he takes nothing.  Last night, day 3 of spots, he looks at me with<br/>
discomfort in his eyes, so I ask him if he&#39;d like an oatmeal bath.  He nods<br/>
yes.  And he even took some Rhus Tox when I offered it to him.  Sure, I<br/>
could have held him down and forced medicine into him when *I* thought he<br/>
needed medicine, but that would have made me look like an ***hole in his<br/>
eyes and heart.  Instead, I was his helper, there to offer him help and<br/>
comfort when he&#39;s ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always an option, another way of looking at things and of doing<br/>
things.  It doesn&#39;t have to be from the angle of &quot;it&#39;s for your own good&quot;.<br/>
I would really hate it if my husband did or said those kinds of things to<br/>
me.  But if he said, &quot;Sweetie, I can tell you&#39;re in a lot of pain, can we<br/>
try this?  No?  How about this?  This?  This?&quot;  until we&#39;ve both agreed on<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your day is beautiful, and kiss your 3yo for me!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE 3<br/>
year olds!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351326830">I appreciate your advice but as I&#39;ve said, the situation is completely<br/>
different.  Your son doesn&#39;t want you to bug him.  My daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to be punched in the head.  Changing her while she&#39;s doing<br/>
something else doesn&#39;t mitigate the fear.  Abuse is totally different<br/>
than irritation.  Though as I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve fixed the diapering<br/>
problem.  She doesn&#39;t resist and happily comes to have her diaper<br/>
changed now because she knows she&#39;s not going to be hurt and I made it<br/>
fun.  Additionally, there isn&#39;t anything she likes better than to have<br/>
an adult invested in her happiness so she will leave a toy with no<br/>
hesitation to interact with us.  Years of neglect and abuse have made<br/>
her crave attention and affection...more than your normal 3 yr old who<br/>
is already beginning to pull away and find their autonomy.  She is<br/>
also only about 12 months old developmentally so that changes the<br/>
situation significantly.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not healthy for her to keep sublimating her physical needs<br/>
because she had to for 3.5 yrs.  It&#39;s important to teach her/show her<br/>
that her body is important and worthy of taking care of.  Shame,<br/>
sadnessm and worthlessness is common in abandoned children.  There is<br/>
way more to consider and overcome in an abandoned and abused child<br/>
than in your average blank slate bio kid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950948460">Hi Karen,<br/>
You&#39;re right, the situation is different.  I didn&#39;t realize your daughter&#39;s<br/>
special circumstances.  Although, it seems counterproductive to do things to<br/>
her &quot;by force&quot; when that&#39;s what she seems to be so afraid of already.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find the answers you are looking for.  You&#39;ve gotten lots of<br/>
great answers here already, notably letting her go diaper free (yes, i hear<br/>
you&#39;ve already solved that one) to using other means of healing an ear<br/>
infection besides antibiotics.  Is she prone to ear infections?  If so, have<br/>
you modified her diet?  Dairy is a big problem for kiddos with recurring ear<br/>
infections.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered wearing her in a sling?  Are you sleeping with her at<br/>
night?  Does she have lots of skin to skin contact with you?<br/>
<br/>

Because she&#39;s Asian we don&#39;t do dairy with her.  She&#39;s on Soy but she<br/>
was on dairy when she was in China.  I believe this will be the last<br/>
ear infection she will have because of withdrawing the dairy.<br/>
<br/>
No we don&#39;t do slings, cosleeping or skin to skin contact.  She finds<br/>
being restrained terrifying and she&#39;s just now coming around to the<br/>
idea of being held as not being scary.  We have let her take the lead<br/>
on that.  Climbing on and off of us as she sees fit and not pushing<br/>
her to display affection she doesn&#39;t feel or frightens her.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t like skin to skin contact for the same reason but when she<br/>
finally gets there we will certainly indulge in it.  CoSleeping is the<br/>
same...it makes her feel uncomfortable but her bed is in our room so<br/>
she&#39;s not alone.  And for now that&#39;s as far as she&#39;s willing to go.<br/>
She started last week to crawl up in the bed in the morning, but not<br/>
for cuddling.  But I expect that will come in time.<br/>

kids come with history (personal belief in reincarnation) or at <br/>

I do not think any kid is a blank slate that you write on though <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624215666">True.  However, if your child is born into your family, and you&#39;ve<br/>
taken care of the child it&#39;s whole life (no daycare)...then you know<br/>

means you have been there to see the history and experiences laid down<br/>
in your child&#39;s life.  You know what happened the first time she went<br/>
swimming.  Or why she&#39;s scared of bumblebees.  You know because you<br/>
were there and you helped write her history.  And if you don&#39;t see how<br/>
it&#39;s different then I don&#39;t know how to make it more clear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887369181">I think you are placing too much on what happened to the child <br/>
before you- my 3 yr old has convinced me that she has had some sort <br/>
of past trauma- when we would play fight and older brother pretended <br/>
to have a gun with noise she would run over and cover me with her <br/>
body- over and over she was protecting me- she hated guns- she likes <br/>
no loves to jump on heads and when hurt she wants to hide and lick <br/>
her wounds and then come out- I call her our little war refugee- now <br/>
I know this did not happen in this life but something is obviously <br/>
coming through-<br/>
<br/>
I think her behaviors in this life are from whatever she lived with <br/>
before but I still just take her where she is and love her and deal <br/>
with it- she is the one who led me to unschooling- I had to change <br/>
because of who she is or was. <br/>
<br/>
yes you knew she had a history but us birth parents sometimes do not <br/>
know why are children are fearful either- my daughters are scared to <br/>
death of swimming pools- I have no idea why<br/>
<br/>
how would you act if you did not know she was abused? <br/>
<br/>
Yes what happened to her was horrible you taking her from it was <br/>
probably the best and worst- in her eyes it had to be pretty <br/>
traumatic to have a stranger take you away from what you know and <br/>
take care of you- having a stanger change you and feed you and keep <br/>
you in a strange home is traumatic- you are causing trauma to her <br/>
just by the nature of adopting her- so yes she had trauma and you <br/>
have given her trauma and you are trying to heal her and love her <br/>
but don&#39;t get lost in the abuse she suffered. <br/>
<br/>
maybe looking at your part in this will help you see her- you choose <br/>
her she did not choose you- she does not know you can not <br/>
communicate with you nothing is familiar<br/>
<br/>
maybe she does not want her diaper changed because she does not know <br/>
who you are- maybe she did not like the plane ride because she she <br/>
did not know who you were- she does not trust what you are giving <br/>
her is good for her- <br/>
<br/>
who told you about the abuse anyway and are you sure it happened and <br/>
not a way to get americans to adopt kids-- just wondering- I just <br/>
wondering since it seems strange the staff would say yeah we beat <br/>
then with a broom when we change them and yeah we tie them up too. I <br/>
just wondered how you knew what happened to her.<br/>

   <br/>
  I think this is *such* a thought-provoking and excellent question to ask!  It just filled me up to see the little girl - while with the knowledge that she has been very mistreated and the complete history is unknown - as being whole and perfect, just the way she *is*.<br/>
   <br/>
  I firmly believe that we *all* want the same thing no matter what our history, no matter what our age, no matter *what*, and that is to be honoured, heard, listened to, loved, accepted for exactly who we are in that moment.<br/>

there is a ton of mystery.<br/>

I have no idea why she&#39;s scared of all the things she is, I have no  <br/>
idea why she&#39;s sad or angry or happy, about 75% of the time. It  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063914562">With all due respect Julie, you are minimizing what happened to my<br/>
daughter by saying it&#39;s not important or comparing it to some what?<br/>
Past life thing with your kid?<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m trying not to read you wrong but you sound like you are<br/>
castigating me for adopting her and treating her fears as real.  As<br/>
far as how I know she was abused, I do.  Wounds, scars on scars,<br/>
misshapen skull.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;my part in this&quot; I know you don&#39;t mean to offend but you<br/>
make me sound as though I don&#39;t know any of this.  I have lived this<br/>
adoption daily for YEARS.  I know well what to expect and what not to<br/>
expect.<br/>
<br/>
Your last paragraph is so insulting I don&#39;t know what to say.  &quot;a way<br/>
to get Americans to adopt children?????!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;  I&#39;m trying to<br/>
remember that not everyone knows what goes into international adoption<br/>
so I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean to be flip.  Everything that happened to<br/>
her is common....and some kids get worse.  A friend of mine&#39;s son was<br/>
cut with scissors when he did bad things.  He was 4.  Older kids can<br/>
tell you what happened to them and others in the SWIs.  And I know she<br/>
was tied because an older child told me.  But I can&#39;t believe I have<br/>
to defend this to you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t treat her as an abused child but it is something I have to be<br/>
aware of.  And I think I&#39;m done discussing this now because I&#39;m<br/>
feeling defensive about her now and that&#39;s not a good thing for e-mail<br/>
communication.  Thank you for your thoughts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; mother didn&#39;t want her. Or try to answer why if you love<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; so much, you won&#39;t take her to see her real mother. If a child is<br/>
&gt; &gt; born to you, that child&#39;s history is not a mystery. &quot;Blank slate&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; means you have been there to see the history and experiences laid<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; in your child&#39;s life. You know what happened the first time she<br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; &gt; swimming. Or why she&#39;s scared of bumblebees. You know because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were there and you helped write her history. And if you don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s different then I don&#39;t know how to make it more clear.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear you keep saying this sentence and I think you are wrong--<br/>
&gt; ALL<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kids come with history (personal belief in reincarnation) or at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; least their own personality-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not think any kid is a blank slate that you write on though<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is what our culture was thought for many years- each of my<br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; came with who they are- my littlest is 3 and even as a tiny baby<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; did not want to cuddle or really be held- as she grew she did not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to be comforted by me but by hiding somewhere- some would<br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that this was because she had an older sister and I spent more<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with her then the little one but that is not true it was just who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she was.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you child came with issues that we hear you are working with-<br/>
&gt; part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the problem is that you are assuming that it only works with<br/>
&gt; bio<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nice kids and it doesn&#39;t- you could have explained how you had an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; adopted abused kid and were trying to be as unschooly as possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but there were issues you were dealing with-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my mom asks every so often if I unschool because I do not think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can control them- I assure her that I could force them to comply<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be punished but I choose not too. my 5 yr old refuses to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere with out me- daddy is now deployed again and she<br/>
&gt; thinks I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; might disappear if hse is not close by- some say I should force<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to go to a class alone &quot;for her own good&quot; but it is not really<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176960856">Karen, it sounds as if you&#39;ve already decided your situation is more unique than anyone else has every experienced, and that no can understand or say anything helpful.

<br/>
And I&#39;m trying not to read you wrong but you sound like you are<br/>
castigating me for adopting her and treating her fears as real. As<br/>
far as how I know she was abused, I do. Wounds, scars on scars,<br/>
misshapen skull.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;my part in this&quot; I know you don&#39;t mean to offend but you<br/>
make me sound as though I don&#39;t know any of this. I have lived this<br/>
adoption daily for YEARS. I know well what to expect and what not to<br/>

<br/>
Your last paragraph is so insulting I don&#39;t know what to say. &quot;a way<br/>
to get Americans to adopt children?????!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; I&#39;m trying to<br/>
remember that not everyone knows what goes into international adoption<br/>
so I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean to be flip. Everything that happened to<br/>
her is common....and some kids get worse. A friend of mine&#39;s son was<br/>
cut with scissors when he did bad things. He was 4. Older kids can<br/>
tell you what happened to them and others in the SWIs. And I know she<br/>
was tied because an older child told me. But I can&#39;t believe I have<br/>
to defend this to you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t treat her as an abused child but it is something I have to be<br/>
aware of. And I think I&#39;m done discussing this now because I&#39;m<br/>
feeling defensive about her now and that&#39;s not a good thing for e-mail<br/>

&gt; her is good for her-<br/>

&gt; &gt; True. However, if your child is born into your family, and you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken care of the child it&#39;s whole life (no daycare)...then you<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; for certain if the child has been hit with a broom. Either it<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; been hit with a broom or you did it. But it&#39;s no mystery. You<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder what kind of misery your child went through. You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; when she cries from the depth of her soul what she is mourning.<br/>
&gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to look your child in the eyes and try to answer why her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; mother didn&#39;t want her. Or try to answer why if you love<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868165079">I&#39;ve been trying to find the way to say something similar to this. <br/>
But I keep getting so frustrated that i just want to scream!  I<br/>
finally figured out why this is affecting me so much and why I haven&#39;t<br/>
yet been able to walk away.  This is EXACTLY how my mother treated me<br/>
my entire life.  Everytime, I opened my mouth, from the time i was a<br/>
small child, she blamed me for insulting her, cutting her down, making<br/>
her feel bad and that&#39;s putting it lightly.  She (my mother)has a<br/>
covert aggressive personality.  I am still dealing with it to this<br/>
very day and only in the last few years been able to shake the guilt. <br/>
<br/>
I really think some doors would open if Karen would stop being a<br/>
victim of her own circumstances (and of us).  <br/>

i think this thread did not start with talking about your daughter <br/>
anyway and it just evolved into that- I understand that I have no <br/>
idea what I am talking about- I just wondered how you knew exactly <br/>
what had happened to her - as opposed to just knowing hse had been <br/>
abused in some way.<br/>
<br/>
this was really not about you asking for help with regards to your <br/>
daughter as much as your seeking to see if it was the same to all <br/>
situations- <br/>
<br/>
I really do not want to minimize what she went through or any other <br/>
child as much as say yeah things happened but I want to give her as <br/>
much freedom as I can- which is really what I hear you saying you do-<br/>
 except for the few instances when you wondered if it counted in <br/>
medical situations<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644416495">How is suggesting that the abuse is made up to get americans to adopt<br/>
kids unschooly?  How is it anything but insulting?  How is saying her<br/>
real abuse is not important?  How is saying being abandoned is<br/>
unimportant unschooly.  Seems to me that&#39;s EVERYTHING but unschooly.<br/>
It does not honor her as a person.  What she feels, what she thinks.<br/>
What she will question later in life.<br/>
<br/>
Saying how would I treat her if I didn&#39;t know she had been abused...IS<br/>
critism.  It&#39;s saying that&#39;s all I do.  And telling me that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t know who we are etc...presupposes that I didn&#39;t already know<br/>
this ergo I have not done my homework.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to<br/>
hear from people, but people who know nothing about adoption, and IA<br/>
in specific should not be offering that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.<br/>
I would never tell one of you that you don&#39;t know your child.  Never.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want advice...I just don&#39;t get it.  You all<br/>
freak about changing a diaper but tell me not to be concerned about<br/>
abuse and loss.  It seems backwards.<br/>

&gt; &gt; then with a broom when we change them and yeah we tie them up too. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just wondered how you knew what happened to her.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; True. However, if your child is born into your family, and you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; taken care of the child it&#39;s whole life (no daycare)...then you<br/>
&gt; &gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for certain if the child has been hit with a broom. Either it<br/>
&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been hit with a broom or you did it. But it&#39;s no mystery. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder what kind of misery your child went through. You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when she cries from the depth of her soul what she is mourning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to look your child in the eyes and try to answer why her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; mother didn&#39;t want her. Or try to answer why if you love<br/>
&gt; &gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so much, you won&#39;t take her to see her real mother. If a child is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; born to you, that child&#39;s history is not a mystery. &quot;Blank slate&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; means you have been there to see the history and experiences laid<br/>
&gt; &gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in your child&#39;s life. You know what happened the first time she<br/>
&gt; &gt; went<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; swimming. Or why she&#39;s scared of bumblebees. You know because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were there and you helped write her history. And if you don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; &gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s different then I don&#39;t know how to make it more clear.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hear you keep saying this sentence and I think you are wrong--<br/>
&gt; &gt; ALL<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kids come with history (personal belief in reincarnation) or at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least their own personality-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not think any kid is a blank slate that you write on though<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is what our culture was thought for many years- each of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came with who they are- my littlest is 3 and even as a tiny baby<br/>
&gt; &gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did not want to cuddle or really be held- as she grew she did not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want to be comforted by me but by hiding somewhere- some would<br/>
&gt; &gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this was because she had an older sister and I spent more<br/>
&gt; &gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with her then the little one but that is not true it was just who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she was.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you child came with issues that we hear you are working with-<br/>
&gt; &gt; part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the problem is that you are assuming that it only works with<br/>
&gt; &gt; bio<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice kids and it doesn&#39;t- you could have explained how you had an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adopted abused kid and were trying to be as unschooly as possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but there were issues you were dealing with-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my mom asks every so often if I unschool because I do not think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can control them- I assure her that I could force them to comply<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be punished but I choose not too. my 5 yr old refuses to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere with out me- daddy is now deployed again and she<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinks I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might disappear if hse is not close by- some say I should force<br/>
&gt; &gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go to a class alone &quot;for her own good&quot; but it is not really<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her own good but for their mindset.<br/>

Maybe you inadvertently used the term, not realizing that there is a  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&quot;Children & Blank Slate Evolution<br/>
by Will Meek<br/>
March 4, 2007<br/>
The �blank slate� view of human development was first documented in  <br/>
the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and is generally credited to  <br/>
Locke and Rousseau. The idea is that a child is born completely free  <br/>
of any predisposition or vulnerabilities, and that everything the  <br/>
child would become was due to the effects of the environment. With  <br/>
advances in biotechnology, neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and  <br/>
psychology, this view has all but been completely discredited today.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are now thought to have significant �pre-programming� from  <br/>
genes that have some influence on almost every want, trait, feeling,  <br/>
thought, and action. However, although we are bombarded right now by  <br/>
news about gene X being responsible for enjoying Saturday morning  <br/>
cartoons, it is important to remember that families, communities,  <br/>
peers, schools, culture, and parents have at LEAST an equal part of  <br/>
making us who we are, even if Rousseau was wrong.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Absolutely not.  I&#39;m not saying unschooling won&#39;t work for every<br/>
child at all, although I believe it will look different based on the<br/>
needs of the child.  My 11 yr old doesn&#39;t need much in the way of<br/>
structure, but my 9 yr old craves structure so I have to do diffrent<br/>
things for each of them.  What I have said and people continue to<br/>
either ignore it or tell me I&#39;m wrong or a horrible parent, is that<br/>
there are times when letting a child have complete control is not only<br/>
irresponsible but negligent.  There are times, and it varies with the<br/>
age of the child, that as a parent you MUST say &quot;No way...&quot; such as<br/>
running in a busy street.  Now, if you&#39;ve managed to come up with a<br/>
way to make sure that the kid stays out of the street and you don&#39;t<br/>
have to say NO, that&#39;s nifty but you are still saying NO.  Whether you<br/>
admit it or not.  Does it matter if they eat nothing but marshmallows<br/>
for three days?  No, not usually.  Does it matter if the kid in<br/>
question happens to be diabetic?  You bet your ass it does.  To say it<br/>
doesn&#39;t and allow any kind of diet because you never want to say NO is<br/>
to kill your child.<br/>
<br/>
My point with my daughter, is that while your average 3 yr old can be<br/>
left in a dirty diaper because they will eventually come to you and<br/>
ask to be cleaned up, because of the abuse and neglect, my daughter<br/>
doesn&#39;t read the signals her body is sending her and thus has to be<br/>
taught what being clean feels like and that a diaper change doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean a beating.  AND that does NOT make me a horrible parent.  It took<br/>
4 diaper changes where she would rather we didn&#39;t, was fearful etc. to<br/>
show her that there is a different way than what she&#39;s used to.  And<br/>
if some of you wouldn&#39;t ever do that to your kid that&#39;s fine.  But I<br/>
know that adopted kids, neglected adopted kids need to be reparented<br/>
and get their needs met as an infant is supposed to.  Infants cry when<br/>
their diapers are dirty.  They want to be changed.  Mommy comes and<br/>
changes them.  They learn they can count on an adult and they matter.<br/>
My daughter may be 3.5 yrs old but not emotionally and not<br/>
developmentally.  AND she still needs to be reparented.  Because she<br/>
doesn&#39;t cry about a dirty diaper is DEEPLY sad.  It&#39;s not OK.  It&#39;s<br/>
not a sign that something else is more important as others have<br/>
suggested.  Yes, that&#39;s true for typical 3.5 yr olds.  I had two of<br/>
them.  I remember those days.  This IS different.  She does have to<br/>
have a different plan than a kid born into a family that has already<br/>
learned trust.<br/>
<br/>
That a bunch of people have said &quot;pfft that&#39;s not true!&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make<br/>
it not so.  And if you ask anyone with adoption experience they all<br/>
know the reparenting is vital to the bonding and eventual development<br/>
of the whole person.  So it&#39;s not that it won&#39;t work for her, she is<br/>
mostly unschooled now anyway because it is the best for our bonding.<br/>
There are times it can not be applied because it interferes with the<br/>
reparenting.  And teaching her that her body is hers and her needs<br/>
will be met is important.  In some arenas of life, such as diapering,<br/>
she had to be reparented to get the idea that someone cared about her<br/>
butt and her comfort.  That when she had a need it would be met, not<br/>
with anger and pain but with love and caring.  And if that&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling I guess I don&#39;t understand the definintion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441430504">For me, it&#39;s about expectations. You can be aware of and concerned <br/>
about her past without putting your expectations on it. Since you&#39;ve <br/>
said she can&#39;t communicate with you, you can&#39;t really *know* why she <br/>
does something. You can make informed guesses and assumptions based <br/>
on what you know about her past but you can&#39;t really know for sure <br/>
unless she tells you. So, maybe the thing to do is to be as gentle <br/>
and respectful with her as possible because she probably was abused <br/>
and has dealt with major loss but not worry about the why of it all <br/>
yet. Does that make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
For example, don&#39;t worry about what you will say to her when she <br/>
asks why her &quot;real&quot; mother didn&#39;t want her until she asks you. You <br/>
can&#39;t address that now, anyway, if you can&#39;t effectively communicate <br/>
with her.<br/>

I just wanted to say that I &quot;DO&quot; have a great deal of long-term  <br/>
experience with an adopted child who was horribly sexually,  <br/>
physically, and emotionally abused from infancy to 3 years old, placed  <br/>
in a foster home, abused THERE until she was five and finally adopted  <br/>
by my sister. They live just a few blocks away, and I was the only  <br/>
adult other than my sister and her husband who ever could take care of  <br/>
her. And then my sister&#39;s husband died from leukemia within months  <br/>
after the adoption was final. I was my sister&#39;s only helper with her  <br/>
daughter and it was extremely difficult. She had two other children  <br/>
and I had my own three. My niece is now 24 years old, so I have had  <br/>
many years of experience, and I know very very well what the results  <br/>
of her early life meant - reactive attachment disorder, physical and  <br/>
mental disabilities, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m telling you all this so you won&#39;t assume that none of us have a  <br/>
clue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I speak for everyone on this list in saying that we admire  <br/>
your courage and kindness in adopting this little girl and we truly  <br/>
sympathize with the difficulties. I KNOW, first hand, how emotionally  <br/>
and physically exhausting it is. Maybe this is not a good time for you  <br/>
to participate on a list like this. I say that because you seem so  <br/>
very oversensitive and much of the intended help or suggestions or  <br/>
ideas directed toward you are feeling, to you, like criticism, even  <br/>
though it is obvious to others that that is not at all intended.<br/>
<br/>
I really strongly suggest that you just read, stop posting, and notice  <br/>
any ideas that seem like they might be adaptable for your situation  <br/>
and ignore the rest.<br/>

<br/>
I appreciate your advice but as I&#39;ve said, the situation is completely<br/>
different.  Your son doesn&#39;t want you to bug him.  My daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to be punched in the head.  Changing her while she&#39;s doing<br/>
something else doesn&#39;t mitigate the fear.  Abuse is totally different<br/>
than irritation.  Though as I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve fixed the diapering<br/>
problem.  She doesn&#39;t resist and happily comes to have her diaper<br/>
changed now because she knows she&#39;s not going to be hurt and I made it<br/>
fun.  Additionally, there isn&#39;t anything she likes better than to have<br/>
an adult invested in her happiness so she will leave a toy with no<br/>
hesitation to interact with us.  Years of neglect and abuse have made<br/>
her crave attention and affection...more than your normal 3 yr old who<br/>
is already beginning to pull away and find their autonomy.  She is<br/>
also only about 12 months old developmentally so that changes the<br/>
situation significantly.<br/>

Karen B kindly replied and hoped to be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly. The polite response is: &quot;Thank you.&quot; Or nothing at all.<br/>
<br/>
We all don&#39;t need to now why the suggestions won&#39;t work for you. Really.<br/>
<br/>
That advice might work wonders for seven other readers.<br/>
