<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191538916">We can have a family sit-down dinner if we WANT to but not <br/>
because we want to hear about each others days. <br/>
*******<br/>
We also no longer have &quot;Family Sit Down Dinners&quot; (Dum dum DUM) either although as my kids have gotten older and their social lives are much more active, we&#39;ll occasionally notice that, &quot;Hey, everyone is home! Let&#39;s sit at the table and eat dinner!&quot; LOL<br/>
No requirements, no coersion. Just for fun.<br/>
