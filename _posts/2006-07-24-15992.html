<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916927911">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
First, thanks to Deb, Michelle, Manisha (what a pretty name!) and <br/>
Robin for taking the time to reply.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, I guess what I am really asking is - are they (the school <br/>
dept) going to notice (or care about) the major difference between <br/>
the last 4 years letters of intent and this years letter of intent?<br/>
<br/>
You are all probably going to hate me for this, but I was one of <br/>
those people who used to give them  WAY more information than I <br/>
guess I really had to.  I would list the curriculum we were planning <br/>
to use and actually photocopy the cover, the table of contents <br/>
and/or the index of each book.  As such, the packet I sent them each <br/>
year was huge by the time I finished doing all 5 kids individually.  <br/>
<br/>
I started this because someone in my town was contacted by the <br/>
school and they wanted proof that they actually owned (or at least <br/>
had in their possesion) all the curriculum they were claiming to <br/>
use.  They made them bring in all the books to a meeting.  I thought <br/>
if i made a photocopy of each cover and table of contents, they <br/>
would realize that i actually had all this stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
I also had to be careful, because, at that point in time, we were in <br/>
the process of adopting our foster child through the department of <br/>
social services.  Now that the adoption is finalized, and i am not <br/>
under such heavy scrutiny, i feel that we are more able to relax and <br/>
just let things happen as part of life.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the suggestions, especially the ones specifically <br/>
related to MA.  I will be sure to check out the AHEM website and the <br/>
Sandra Dodd ones, especially. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL I had to laugh at this - I could go to a bookstore or the library, <br/>
get the stuff, photocopy the cover and such and then take it ALL BACK <br/>
and never use it. Not much proof when it comes right down to it.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that they&#39;ll probably be happy not to receive huge <br/>
packets of info that they have to process and file. And, I&#39;d just say, <br/>
if asked &quot;I&#39;ve got FIVE kids to do paperwork for, I HAD TO find some <br/>
way to streamline it. Is there anything that Charles (et al) requires <br/>
that&#39;s missing?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445156156">They might, and they might not. The only way to know is to send it in. Good luck with it! <br/>
