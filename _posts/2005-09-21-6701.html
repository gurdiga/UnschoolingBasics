<div id="ygrps-yiv-636584120"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve been reading on and off for a while -- the volume of the list <br/>
&gt; overwhelms me, but I&#39;m totally grateful for it when I get the chance <br/>
&gt; to check in. I have to agree here with the &quot;own money&quot; idea, and will <br/>
&gt; point out that the amount of that money isn&#39;t important. If it&#39;s only <br/>
&gt; a little, well, then, that&#39;s realistic for your family and he&#39;ll find <br/>
&gt; the challenge is to be economical enough to use what he&#39;s got. Also, <br/>
&gt; the driving around could be an issue, like you said, so I think the <br/>
&gt; suggestion others made to limit how often you&#39;ll go out to get stuff <br/>
&gt; is a good idea, too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do think sometimes kids get really excited when they realize they can <br/>
&quot;save&quot; money for their family by buying inexpensive stuff or finding <br/>
free stuff. They often forget to pay attention to whether or not they <br/>
actually need it! Gee, where do they get that, I wonder?;-)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! (p.s. If you really have that uncomfortable feeling about <br/>
compulsiveness, try reducing as many stress factors as you can in his <br/>
life and seeing if it also reduces the drive for stuff -- it could just <br/>
be an expression of some underlying anxiety, same as it often is for <br/>
adults...). Hope this helps!<br/>
