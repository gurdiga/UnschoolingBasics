<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am beginning to get amazingly excited about the first of our two unschooling <br/>
conferences this year, Life is Good, held in Vancouver, WA on May 21-24. I absolutely <br/>
LOVE conferences; they are ways to connect with old friends, meet new ones, relax, and <br/>
celebrate all that is good and wonderful in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever been to a conference? Are you uncertain about going? Is your husband or <br/>
partner resistant? I know what that&#39;s like, and it can be scary as hell - but so incredibly <br/>
rewarding. Read on.<br/>
<br/>
Every time another conference approaches, it reminds me of how I felt in the months <br/>
leading up to my first one, Live and Learn in Albuquerque in 2006. When Ginger told me <br/>
she wanted to go, I was pretty unsure - a conference? I mean REALLY? I&#39;ve been to a ton of <br/>
conferences in my professional life, and they are so - - well - - boring and formal. I<br/>
mean, Conferences are places where we all wear name badges, and sit around at tables <br/>
forcing<br/>
 conversation with people we don&#39;t know. Conferences are where we pick up 37 <br/>
pounds of printed flyers and brochures that we&#39;ll never read again. They&#39;re places where <br/>
we fight to stay awake all day so we can earn the right to go back to our rooms and watch <br/>
TV. I mean, unschooling sounded okay - - I was even kinda enjoying it. Why the hell did I <br/>
need to fly across the country to bore myself?<br/>
<br/>
As the conference got closer, my concerns took a new turn. No longer was I worried about <br/>
being bored; I was worried about being overwhelmed and unaccepted. What if everyone <br/>
there already knew each other? What if I wasn&#39;t cool enough, or funny enough, or smart <br/>
enough, or - - God forbid - - unschooly enough? I had serious visions that someone <br/>
would approach Ginger a few days into the conference, point at me, and say &quot;He doesn&#39;t <br/>
belong here - - I think you should reconsider this unschooling thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we were flying there, I began to feel better, but still had one nagging concern; all of <br/>
these Dads were probably so cool, and they probably had neat non-traditional careers that <br/>
allowed them to stay home and be with their kids all of the time, and how could I possibly <br/>
compete with that? Did I even deserve to be here? What the hell would I do when I got to <br/>
the hotel and the whole thing started?<br/>
<br/>
And then we got there, and the rest of my life began. The entire weekend was a dream: I <br/>
learned, I laughed, I cried, I=2<br/>
0relaxed, I played, I created, I asked, I answered, I dug deep, I <br/>
slept, I stayed up all night, I followed my kids around everywhere they wanted me to and <br/>
left them alone when they wanted that, I was challenged, I challenged, I made amazing <br/>
friends from 6 months old to 70, and I came to one essential understanding of my life: <br/>
happiness is king and rules all. My happiness, Ginger&#39;s Kai&#39;s, Kade&#39;s, and everyone else <br/>
that we had a chance to interact with.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s what I did at my first conference, and why I think you should go:<br/>
<br/>
I went to main presentations: the ones from Ren Allen and Ben Lovejoy stood out, <br/>
primarily because they made me think about the love I have for my children and how <br/>
much it can still deepen.<br/>
<br/>
I went to circle chats and smaller meetings. My first circle chat was with Barbara Chase, <br/>
and while way too many brain cells have left the building to remember the exact topic, I do <br/>
recall feeling energized and excited by one critical thing: not everyone there was an <br/>
&quot;expert&quot; or &quot;radical&quot;, and they were all learning and growing, just like me - even the folks <br/>
who have been doing it for years.<br/>
<br/>
I went to SSUDS meetings. The Secret Society of Unschooling Dads is really just a cool <br/>
acronym; there&#39;s nothing secret about it. My first SSUDS meeting was just dads and <br/>
grandads and such, with lots of no-holds barred Q&A about being a Dad and unschooling. <br/>
I asked tons of questions, and was challenged all alo<br/>
ng the way. It was rough for me, <br/>
because many of the answers I got were strange and new - but the people who answered <br/>
me did it from the heart, with no other goal than to make me a better unschooling dad. <br/>
And then after the meeting and all through the weekend, they each sought me out to talk <br/>
one-on-one.<br/>
<br/>
I ran a fun shop. What a great way to meet people! Fun shops are just that; fun, fun, fun. <br/>
We decided to make tissue paper kites ,and brought tissue paper, string, decorations, <br/>
markers, glue sticks, etc. Kids and their parents just flowed in for the whole hour, and we <br/>
found ourselves scrambling just to catch up and keep them all supplied! But we met so <br/>
many cool people and cool kids, and that helped us make connections that led to deeper <br/>
conversations over that weekend - and over the years since.<br/>
<br/>
I participated in the raffle and instant gratification table. I got a chance to buy raffle tickets <br/>
and bid on all sorts of exciting gift baskets and other cool stuff. The kids got to <br/>
participate, too. Another fantastic way to meet people and experience new things.<br/>
<br/>
I actually got on stage during the talent show. A bunch of the younger set got on stage <br/>
and sang &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, and I just couldn&#39;t resist! Subsequent years have seen <br/>
me up dancing to &quot;The Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, among other silly stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I walked to a coffee shop every day; just to escape for a little while and get some &quot;me&quot; <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I watched Cartoon Network for the first time. Before the conference, we didn&#39;t have cable <br/>
at all; never had! But since that very first episode of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; I realized <br/>
that TV is not an instrument of the Devil; it is another wonderful way to connect with my <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I let go. I let go of almost everything: bed times, TV control, the need to be right, the need <br/>
to be on-time, the need to know where my kids were and with whom, the need to be in <br/>
control - and most of all, my preconceived notions that had defined unschooling in a <br/>
rigid, formulaic fashion.<br/>
<br/>
And most importantly, I learned. Without even trying, or wanting to, or planning to, or <br/>
even knowing it was happening. While I learned things about unschooling, to be sure, I <br/>
mostly learned about myself, my life, my family, my goals, my fears, and my passions.<br/>
<br/>
A conference can be all of this, and more. All it takes for you to have a similar, wonderful, <br/>
life-changing experience is to come and let it happen. Look for the people who look <br/>
peaceful and are smiling; they&#39;re the ones who know and are there to help you make the <br/>
same journey.<br/>

&gt; Well, I am beginning to get amazingly excited about the first of our two unschoolingÂ <br/>
&gt; conferences this year, Life is Good, held in Vancouver, WA on May 21-24. I absolutelyÂ <br/>
&gt; LOVE conferences; they are ways to connect with old friends, meet new ones, relax, <br/>

&gt; because many of the answers I got were strange and new - but the people who <br/>
answeredÂ <br/>
&gt; me did it from the heart, with no other goal than to make me a better unschooling <br/>
dad.Â <br/>
&gt; And then after the meeting and all through the weekend, they each sought me out to <br/>
talkÂ <br/>
&gt; one-on-one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I ran a fun shop. What a great way to meet people! Fun shops are just that; fun, fun, <br/>
fun.Â <br/>
&gt; We decided to make tissue paper kites ,and brought tissue paper, string, decorations,Â <br/>
&gt; markers, glue sticks, etc. Kids and their parents just flowed in for the whole hour, and <br/>
weÂ <br/>
&gt; found ourselves scrambling just to catch up and keep them all supplied! But we met <br/>
soÂ <br/>
&gt; many cool people and cool kids, and that helped us make connections that led to <br/>
deeperÂ <br/>
&gt; conversations over that weekend - and over the years since.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I participated in the raffle and instant gratification table. I got a chance to buy raffle <br/>
ticketsÂ <br/>
&gt; and bid on all sorts of exciting gift baskets and other cool stuff. The kids got toÂ <br/>
&gt; participate, too. Another fantastic way to meet people and experience new things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I actually got on stage during the talent show. A bunch of the younger set got on <br/>
stageÂ <br/>
&gt; and sang &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, and I just couldn&#39;t resist! Subsequent years have <br/>
seenÂ <br/>
&gt; me up dancing to &quot;The Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, among other silly stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I walked to a coffee shop every day; just to escape for a little while and get some &quot;me&quot;Â <br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I watched Cartoon Network for the first time. Before the conference, we didn&#39;t have <br/>
cableÂ <br/>
&gt; at all; never had! But since that very first episode of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; I <br/>
realizedÂ <br/>
&gt; that TV is not an instrument of the Devil; it is another wonderful way to connect with <br/>
myÂ <br/>
&gt; kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I let go. I let go of almost everything: bed times, TV control, the need to be right, the <br/>
needÂ <br/>
&gt; to be on-time, the need to know where my kids were and with whom, the need to be <br/>
inÂ <br/>
&gt; control - and most of all, my preconceived notions that had defined unschooling in aÂ <br/>
&gt; rigid, formulaic fashion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And most importantly, I learned. Without even trying, or wanting to, or planning to, orÂ <br/>
&gt; even knowing it was happening. While I learned things about unschooling, to be sure, <br/>
IÂ <br/>
&gt; mostly learned about myself, my life, my family, my goals, my fears, and my passions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A conference can be all of this, and more. All it takes for you to have a similar, <br/>
wonderful,Â <br/>
&gt; life-changing experience is to come and let it happen. Look for the people who lookÂ <br/>
&gt; peaceful and are smiling; they&#39;re the ones who know and are there to help you make <br/>
theÂ <br/>
&gt; same journey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
