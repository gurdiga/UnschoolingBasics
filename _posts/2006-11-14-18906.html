<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910379626">It is getting more possible to continue doing what you love and, if you need college <br/>
credentials, tuck them into your schedule on the side by doing online courses.   There was <br/>
an excellent radio program on this yesterday, which you can still hear by podcast.    If you <br/>
are interested, go to www.wamu.org  (The Diane Rehm Show), see the list of shows on the <br/>
left, Week of November 13, 2006, click on Monday, the 13th&#39;s show, &quot;Online Eucation&quot;.   <br/>
