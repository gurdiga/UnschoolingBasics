<div id="ygrps-yiv-35360872">Join Carolina Homeschooler in October for our fifth trip to Washington<br/>
DC! We&#39;re planning to tour various memorials and monuments, the<br/>
White House, Arlington Cemetery, US Capitol, the Pentagon,<br/>
Ford&#39;s Theater, Museum of Crime and Punishment, Union Station,<br/>
and more.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll also have time to visit the Holocaust Museum and Smithsonian<br/>
museums such as: Air and Space, Natural History, American History,<br/>
American Indian, and others of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
The cost for this trip for a family of four (depending on ages) is<br/>
estimated at $1025 and includes hotel for four nights, breakfast and<br/>
lunch during our stay, all admissions, and Metro travel while we&#39;re<br/>
touring. If you&#39;re interested in bringing down the cost even more, there<br/>
are several mother/daughter teams looking to share a hotel room with<br/>
other mother/daughter teams.<br/>
<br/>
Spots on this trip are limited, and the registration deadline is August 21,<br/>
with all payments due by August 28, so register soon!<br/>
