<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829879327">NBTSC has some kind of work trade program so if you can&#39;t afford it maybe you can look in to that. My daughter goes every year and loves it. That camp was the best thing I ever did to facilitate unschooling for her. She has a ton of friends all over the place from camp. She&#39;s going both sessions this year. <br/>

&gt; ~~~~ looking into Not Back to School Camp if it is <br/>
&gt; something that your son would be interested in and you could manage <br/>
&gt; it. ~~~~<br/>
&gt; I had kind of forgotten about that so I looked it up last night and it is<br/>
&gt; pricey - not just the camp but travel to get there.  My DH and I are trying<br/>
&gt; to figure out how we can make it work and are going to bring it up with<br/>
&gt; Seth.  He loves going to camps so I have a feeling he will want to.<br/>
&gt; ~~~~Also if you can get to an unschooling conference~~~~ <br/>
&gt; We went to the Rethinking Education conference the last 2 years and this<br/>
&gt; year since I will have just had a baby we aren&#39;t planning to attend. Seth<br/>
&gt; really wants to go so I have asked some of my friends to be his surrogate<br/>
&gt; parent if they decide to go but they haven&#39;t decided on going yet.  <br/>
&gt; ~~~~a conference yet but we are going to one in May~~~~~ <br/>
&gt; What conference is in May?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~~~talked a lot about the difference in how teens are expected to be by<br/>
&gt; society and the difference in our relationship.~~~~ <br/>
&gt; I plan on chatting with Seth very soon about all this.  We had a talk about<br/>
&gt; 2 weeks ago about some of the stuff we have gone through recently and it was<br/>
&gt; a good talk.  <br/>
&gt; ~~~~How long has your son been out of school?~~~~<br/>
&gt; This is his 3rd year out of school but with clinging on to the school<br/>
&gt; relationship he had (not very healthy ones to begin with), I think it is<br/>
&gt; taking him longer to let go of the schoolish/societal things.<br/>

We will look into this.  I have read the entire site and brochure so next<br/>
step is deciding if we could afford the travel and the cost of camp - work<br/>
trade or not.  We have to decide quick because deadline for deposit is 3/31.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823009729">If there is any way you can work it out, I highly recommend it. i don&#39;t know your childs history, but mine was in school far too long and camp really opened up her eyes to unschooling. The first thing we did was go to a homeschooling conference in Sacramento, Ca. We got there and she looked around and said &quot;you mean all these kids don&#39;t go to school?&quot; Then she commented &quot;you mean there&#39;s all these workshops and things to do and none of it is required? I can do what I want ?&quot;  Camp is also like that, unless you do second session in Oregon, where they have projects to choose from. But even those I think you can not show up for if you don&#39;t want. It sounds so wonderful there. i wish i could go!<br/>
