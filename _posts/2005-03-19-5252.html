&gt; &gt;   I AM DESPERATELY TRYING TO FIND THINGS FOR MY KIDS TO DO WITH<br/>
&gt; &gt;   KIDS THEIR OWN AGE.  &gt; &gt;                             ~APRIL (FROM LANSING AREA, MICHIGAN)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>April - I&#39;m not sure what I would do if it weren&#39;t for instant messaging and Runescape (an on-line game where you talk to other people who are also playing.)  The kids can talk to their friends anytime their friends are on-line.  And we have to travel to see their friends that live close enough, and stay in a hotel to do it.  My husband and I have been discussing the need to travel even further abroad now that they have on-line friends so far away.  Pretty soon we will need to get in an airplane instead of in a car!    It&#39;s hard to get together with other families because everyone is busy doing their own thing!  I guess that&#39;s why instant messaging is working so well for us--the kids get to tak to their friends without being dependent on me to take them somewhere.  Deirdre in Alabama</div>
