<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363353857">&quot;Also, I&#39;m going to start re-reading all<br/>
my books on unschooling that I have now that we are through the de-<br/>
schooling stage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not done deschooling.<br/>
Deschooling means you see that you can learn from anything and <br/>
everything, it means the school is mostly out of your head. It&#39;s not <br/>
for her yet.<br/>
That&#39;s ok....she is where she is. But the fact that she wants you to <br/>
tell her what to &quot;study&quot; is a sure sign that she&#39;s still deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Once a child de-schools, they are interested in things that make <br/>
them happy, they aren&#39;t needing someone to tell them what to do <br/>
(though they may need a lot of help with ideas, or finding new <br/>
places, people and things etc...).<br/>
I&#39;d continue acting as though it&#39;s summer vacation.  Point out the <br/>
things she&#39;s learned so far and help her channel her interests. Tell <br/>
her you are uncomfortable telling her what to &quot;study&quot; but more than <br/>
happy to bring new materials and experiences into her life.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470997576">Thanks Ren.  I thought because she was becoming interested in learning <br/>
she was through the stage of deschooling.  I guess I need to be a bit <br/>
more patient with her.<br/>
<br/>
We talked a little more about it yesterday.  I pointed out to her that <br/>
she is learning all the time.  I asked her if she was comparing <br/>
herself to her homeschooled and schooled friends and she <br/>
replied &quot;maybe&quot;.  I explained that they are learning things just to <br/>
pass a test and then they will probably forget it and move on the next <br/>
test.  She seemed to be ok with that explanation.<br/>
<br/>
She has periods where I do see some changes going on.  We are playing <br/>
more games together, last night she beat me at chess again, we baked <br/>
cookies together in the afternoon, stuff like that.  Before our change <br/>
in lifestyle of rad-unschooling, she rarely wanted to do stuff with <br/>
me.  We weren&#39;t close, I was a controlling and demanding type of mom <br/>
with lots of stupid rules.  Now that I have changed, she likes being <br/>
around me, she evens tells me that I&#39;m cool now.  I love that we have <br/>
grown close.<br/>

<br/>
This is HUGE! Unschooling really can&#39;t unfold the way we all describe <br/>
it until there is healing in the relationships. The parent-child <br/>
relationship is absolutely crucial here. So definitely be patient with <br/>
her, the rest will fall into place. She LIKES being around you, the <br/>
learning and deschooling stuff is secondary to that! Very cool.<br/>
