<div id="ygrps-yiv-523734436">The &quot;Love To Learn&quot; Conference is next Saturday, August 11th in<br/>
Hickory, NC. Here is a list of the session titles. Anna Brown is<br/>
presenting from a Consensual Living perspective. Ren Allen is speaking<br/>
also!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2007 Sessions:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling and the Large Family<br/>
Tami Fox is a homeschool mom to six children who range in age from 16<br/>
years to infant. She has been homeschooling since 2000. And she will<br/>
share her tips with you in this session on how to manage homeschooling<br/>
and a large family. She will also share creative ways to instill a<br/>
love of life-long learning while managing those little things in life<br/>
that seem to creep up in your schedule.<br/>
<br/>
A Look at Unit Studies<br/>
Tami Fox will share with you how unit studies work in her homeschool.<br/>
She will show you how you can instill a love of learning that will<br/>
last a lifetime with simple tips and techniques. She is currently<br/>
using unit studies to teach her six children who range in age from 16<br/>
year to infant.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;How&quot; of Home Schooling thru High School<br/>
Home schooling through high school is: Impossible? No. Challenging?<br/>
Yes. Rewarding? Most definitely! Are you afraid or apprehensive about<br/>
beginning or continuing to home school during your child&#39;s high school<br/>
years? This seminar will address some of the concerns as to what to<br/>
study, how to determine credits, making a transcript of your child&#39;s<br/>
work and preparing for college. Having had one child graduate from her<br/>
home school and another one ready to leave soon, Bobbi Gillette plans<br/>
to share the lessons she has learned in this process of home schooling<br/>
high school aged children. Samples of transcripts, evaluation forms<br/>
and course of study suggestions will be included in this presentation.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully by the end of this seminar you will be encouraged and<br/>
motivated to home school your child during his/her high school career.<br/>
A time of questions and answers will be included in the overflow<br/>
session. Bobbi is a homeschooling mom of 20 years to four children.<br/>
<br/>
From School to Unschool-The Liberation of Unschooling<br/>
Teresa Blalock will share the experiences of her family and three of<br/>
her four children whom she removed from school to bring them home to<br/>
unschooling. All different ages and at different stages in life, she<br/>
will share the joys and stumbling blocks their family encountered as<br/>
they started on their unschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding the Right-Brained Child<br/>
Is your child a &quot;late&quot; reader? Does your child not remember their math<br/>
facts no matter how many times you go over them? Does your child hate<br/>
to write, or their handwriting is barely legible? Your child may be<br/>
right-brained and/or a visual-spatial learner. Cindy Gaddis will<br/>
discuss characteristics of this learning style and help parents<br/>
discover their child&#39;s path to learning with joy. Come celebrate the<br/>
gifts of the right-brained learner while understanding why certain<br/>
subjects may develop &quot;later&quot;. Cindy will specifically cover reading,<br/>
math facts, writing, handwriting, and more! Cindy is the mother of<br/>
seven children, ages 6-20.<br/>
<br/>
Educate Yourself First<br/>
Before you take on the task of educating your children, you must first<br/>
educate yourself about education. Get started with this seminar,<br/>
presented by Misty Spinelli, which will explain the different<br/>
educational philosophies, including: classical, unit studies,<br/>
traditional, Charlotte Mason, and more. Learn the importance of<br/>
setting goals, and discovering your child&#39;s learning style.<br/>
<br/>
Portals to Knowledge (or How chocolate leads to everything in the<br/>
whole-wide-world)<br/>
Do you worry about how learning happens outside of school? Do you<br/>
wonder what natural learning looks like?<br/>
One topic leads to all kinds of learning adventures. If you or your<br/>
child&#39;s interests seem slightly obscure or bizarre, have no fear. Any<br/>
and all interests have the ability to help us learn about many, many<br/>
topics. See the connections all around you and find out where the<br/>
topic of chocolate can lead (you might be surprised). A delicious<br/>
journey that has touched on everything from environmentalism to<br/>
culture, history, cooking and beyond! Choose your portal, it all leads<br/>
to everything! Ren Allen radically unschools with her four children<br/>
and works full time. Her passion is in tapping the creative genius in<br/>
all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Concurrent Enrollment<br/>
May Khang from Catawba Valley Community College, will be talking about<br/>
the purpose and objectives of Concurrent Enrollment for homeschool<br/>
students. Along with discussing eligibility of students, costs of<br/>
concurrent enrollment, course eligibility, and enrollment procedures.<br/>
She will also be glad to answer any questions you may have about the<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
4-H: A Family Affair<br/>
Learn about the wonderful world of 4-H with Susie Devine. You will<br/>
gain an overview of 4-H, learn how to get involved with a club or<br/>
organize a club in your area, and how the 4-H experience can enhance<br/>
your home school experience and prepare your child for the future.<br/>
Meet a panel of outstanding 4-H teens and learn about what they do in<br/>
4-H and how they feel they have benefited from 4-H. 4-H is a community<br/>
based volunteer-led youth development program for children ages 5-19<br/>
offered in each county through Cooperative Extension. Susie has been a<br/>
4-H club leader for 9 years and under her leadership the club has more<br/>
than tripled in size. She has homeschooled her 3 boys that now range<br/>
in age from 13 Â– 18.<br/>
<br/>
Learning and Earning from Home<br/>
Karen Davis has homeschooled in 6 different states. With one<br/>
homeschool graduate, and three more children at home, ages 16, 10<br/>
and 6, she will be combining schooling and working at home for at<br/>
least another decade. Karen grew up in an entrepreneurial family and<br/>
has always enjoyed having a little side business. She talks about<br/>
choosing a business that will work for you, fitting it into your busy<br/>
life and offers resources for making it all work together.<br/>
<br/>
How to Claim a Medical or Religious Exemption to Vaccinations<br/>
Lisa Jillani is the founder and director of PAVE (People Advocating<br/>
Vaccine Education). North Carolina law allows a person to claim a<br/>
medical or religious exemption to vaccination for school or daycare.<br/>
She will present information on how to go about claiming your lawful<br/>
exemption.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting for the Joy of It! ~ discussing the art of creating<br/>
solutions and living joyfully<br/>
Come and join us as we discuss problem solving so that everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs are addressed through examining assumptions, reactions, cultural<br/>
expectations and classic conflict issues. We will turn these<br/>
challenges upside down, sideways and overcome the obstacles to<br/>
peaceful living. Discover some new tools and approaches for working<br/>
together with others, including children, so that everyone is<br/>
satisfied with the outcome! Anna Brown fields questions about creative<br/>
problem solving from a Consensual Living perspective.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Love To Learn&quot; is an inclusive homeschooling conference. Registration<br/>
is only $30 per family for this one day event.<br/>
