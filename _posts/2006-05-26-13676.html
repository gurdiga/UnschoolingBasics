<br/>
I remember my mothers saying to me as a child:  Everything in moderation.    Your words have helped me to feel even more comfortable with relaxing my requirements for my children.  My mother offered it all and my brothers and I choose what we want to eat as adults based on our pallets, health and when we want to lose weight.  I have always been more extreme than anyone in my family when it comes to eating healthy.  I have kind of been irritated with my husband&#39;s choices of food because I judge them as not so healthy.  However, I am seeing that the two of us bring balance to our children&#39;s lives.  If it were not for my husband&#39;s taste in bread, for example, I don&#39;t think my son would like bread.  I LOVE whole wheat bread and hubby doesn&#39;t.  Once my son got a taste of honey wheat, he began to call that his bread.  For a while I have hated giving it to him but now appreciate that this is just his taste.  I have tried to shape his pallet to no avail and I am grateful that I have had the willingness to relax and let him be.  Just like I figured out a way to eat that works for me, he is doing the same.  The only difference at this point is I have the weight problem and he doesn&#39;t.  Go figure! :)  Who needs to school who on eating?  LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139428107">Funny how this is coming up now. My dh and I have been<br/>
trying different breads. Mostly because my husband<br/>
never really did. His mom only bought white bread. I&#39;d<br/>
love to make bread, but I&#39;m not up to that challenge<br/>
yet. <br/>
He is enjoying sheppard&#39;s. He really likes that one.<br/>
But our son refuses to even try anything but the<br/>
standard white. He&#39;s always been this way about food.<br/>
It&#39;s almost like he thinks we are going to poison him<br/>
or something. He refused baby food because we weren&#39;t<br/>
eatting it. <br/>
Funny I&#39;m enjoying this organic sprouted bread. I do<br/>
find it a little dry and heavy, but I like the taste.<br/>
:) Ds looked at my sandwhich and told me it was yucky.<br/>
lol<br/>

Me too.  Guilt and cravings with food issues got me into eating disorders in <br/>
my teenage years.  A lot of it was about control and rigid expectations, for <br/>
me.  Somehow, starving myself let have control in a stressful life and so <br/>
did eating junk, in a different way.   I&#39;m so glad my teenage daughter is <br/>
more healthy about this than I was.   She chooses her food to promote her <br/>
health and energy level, and exercises for health and to look her best but <br/>
not to force herself into someone else&#39;s mold.  She is way better than I am <br/>
about this STILL.<br/>

because Breanna can&#39;t have corn syrup, and there is only ONE brand  <br/>
(and of that, one variety) of bread in the stores that does NOT have  <br/>
corn syrup, Nature&#39;s Best whole wheat. We can also get french bread  <br/>
from Albertsons, and Nature&#39;s best hot dog buns, but even the  <br/>

<br/>
***I was raised on white bread. When I got out on my own I decided that I was <br/>
going to take it upon myself to always try new things....I also decided that <br/>
I wanted to learn a bit more about my food choices and try to make healthier <br/>
ones. (though I know what&#39;s best, I don&#39;t always choose what&#39;s best for me <br/>
however! &lt;g&gt;) I switched to whole grain breads, 100% whole wheat, whole rye etc. I <br/>
love to bake bread and buy my flour and/or wheat berries from a local organic <br/>
farm and mill & I have now raised our kids on these breads also. <br/>
<br/>
This talk about bread choices reminded me of a funny story about our kids and <br/>
bread when they were a bit younger and in school. One day they came home from <br/>
school and said &quot;Mom, why do you always *make* us eat the whole wheat kind of <br/>
bread? Mostly all the other kids at school *get* white bread! Why do we *have <br/>
to* eat that whole wheat stuff?&quot; I told them, well, you don&#39;t *have to* eat <br/>
whole wheat, if you want white, then you can have white. No big deal. I&#39;ll buy <br/>
some the next time we go to the store. I packed their lunches with white bread <br/>
and they came home saying, &quot;Please don&#39;t pack us white bread again! It is <br/>
GROSS! It&#39;s doughy and sickening! Yuk!&quot; <br/>
*IF* I had not given them the choice and said to them &quot;Whole wheat is better <br/>
for you and I want you to eat whole instead of white, period.&quot; I KNOW they <br/>
would have rebelled and NOT wanted the whole grain bread ever. I&#39;m glad I allowed <br/>
them that freedom of choice. If they chose to eat white now I would buy it <br/>
again...or maybe make it for all of us! We all like the homemade stuff wheat OR <br/>
white! :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714326491">Hi there, <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m new to the list and have been lurking for a bit.  I thought I&#39;d take this opportunity to intriduce myself.  I&#39;m 35, married, have 3 kids- 2 girls 15 and 13, and boy 8. We live in Hawaii right now, but that will change as soon as dh retires from the USMC or they decide to move us, whichever comes first... we&#39;ve got about 3 years till retirement (whew!!) <br/>
   <br/>
  My family has multiple allergies, mostly additives to food but also a few actual foods.  Synthetic colors and flavors, corn syrup, and dairy have all been eliminated in our house and we&#39;re still figuring out new problems.<br/>
   <br/>
  At this point, I make 95% of what we eat including breads, snacks, cookies, and juices and lemonade from fresh fruit in the juicer.  thankfully I like cooking, but it is a major drain on my time and energy. The kids enjoy cooking too, so that helps- in between Spongebob and commercials anyway. LOL<br/>

&gt; because Breanna can&#39;t have corn syrup, and there is only ONE brand<br/>
&gt; (and of that, one variety) of bread in the stores that does NOT have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have a health food store that carries bread?  Most of them do not<br/>
have corn syrup.  Also if you have an European bakery ask if they do.<br/>
Another option would be a kosher grocer or an import store.  You could<br/>
always bake your own as well.  Or move to Australia!  I have a friend whos<br/>
daughter has a corn allergy (life threatening at that).  They had family in<br/>
Australia they would visit and they would aways pack a small suitcase into a<br/>
larger suitcase on the way down and on the way home they would fill the<br/>
suitcase with colas, candies and other things that are sweetened with corn<br/>
here in the states.  Corn syrup isn&#39;t used much in Australia.  They<br/>
eventually moved there and part of it was for their dd&#39;s diet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155553636">It&#39;s so funny you mention that, because dh and I were just talking  <br/>
about it. We have a smallish store, and most of their natural breads  <br/>
have organic corn syrup or organic corn starch. Also not allowed.<br/>
I have yet to find a kosher grocer  in OKC. I&#39;ve searched  <br/>
around...there are some places online I keep meaning to order from.  <br/>
My &#39;kickmyself&#39; moment is the marshmellows, I finally found some corn  <br/>
free ones online and I&#39;ve never gone back when I had the money. Her  <br/>
favorite soda is Dr Pepper, and you can buy that online sweetened  <br/>
with cane sugar, but it&#39;s a killer on shipping. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We thought we had it made today...we went to Johnny Carrino&#39;s, they  <br/>
said no corn in their bread. However, with 10 minutes of eating it  <br/>
you could see the reaction. She started rocking and banging her head  <br/>
within 20 minutes. she&#39;s been crazy ever since, and she&#39;ll probably  <br/>
be sick to her stomach for the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
We just found a bigger health food store about 40 minutes away, I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking this weekend I&#39;ll drive up there and just spend an hour or  <br/>
two reading labels.<br/>
<br/>
We have thought about moving to Australia actually...live in the  <br/>
outback.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907875527">We&#39;re working on that. Breanna&#39;s our one with autism, and not only  <br/>
does she have sensory issues that make it difficult to handle  <br/>
texture, there is the whole &#39;change&#39; thing that she doesn&#39;t cope well  <br/>
with. Texture, taste, and smell are all iffy propositions for her.<br/>
Some bagels are okay, and she ate a pita for the first time last  <br/>
week. Tortillas are a big NO for her because they are too different,  <br/>
and rice cakes are a no as well. She likes crackers with peanut  <br/>
butter, so when we&#39;re out of bread she gets that.<br/>
I consider ourselves fortunate, she does eat a lot for a child with  <br/>
autism. Part of that had to do with manipulation though, and I&#39;m not  <br/>
sure if i&#39;m proud of that or not. Stuff like &quot;You can have more  <br/>
macaroni when you eat your peas.&quot; We didn&#39;t start off so hard, we  <br/>
honestly started with just being able to put the food on her  <br/>
plate...THEN she&#39;d get more mac. Then it was lick the pea, then it  <br/>
was put it in your mouth and spit it back out, followed by chew it  <br/>
and spit it out, next was to actually swallow a pea. When she found  <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t kill her, she was much more flexible about it ;-)  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you if it was something she would develop  <br/>
naturally, but most kids with autism do not.<br/>
