<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168380547">Hi everyone--<br/>
..not sure where to start?..I&#39;ve been reading this list and AU, UD,<br/>
and some other unschooling sites and blogs for about 2 yrs. We took<br/>
our boy out of school this year. Things are going really well,<br/>
deschooling right now. Having a great time. Doing lots of fun stuff<br/>
and keeping our own pace of life. DS just turned 8yrs in sept.<br/>
 <br/>
 At the start of Sept I broke my big toe and, because it&#39;s a break <br/>
right at the joint, I&#39;m still not working (normally about 18hrs/wk).<br/>
Now, I love not working, but usually me and my family&#39;s normal course<br/>
of exercise would be to go on bike rides, walk to the park, play a<br/>
bunch in the yard, hike, build stuff, go to the beach, whatever. It<br/>
felt natural and fun and not &quot;exercise-y&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ve been feeling alternately bummed and agitated that I&#39;m unable to<br/>
do my normal amount of physical exercise. I used to walk our dog 4-5<br/>
times a week in the early a.m. for my own peace of mind and health.<br/>
Now, I&#39;m having to rest my foot and be still and ::UGH!:: I&#39;m having a<br/>
really hard time.<br/>
 <br/>
 Here&#39;s where I need some feedback and help: Since I&#39;m home with my<br/>
boy full time now, but unable to run around with him, how do I<br/>
incorporate some exercise in our day-to-day? <br/>
 My DP (dear partner) is worried about our boy because DS has gained<br/>
some weight. Not a lot, but noticeable. And DP sees it as a result of<br/>
DS being too sedentary---playing video games/watching movies and<br/>
things along those lines. Our deschooling looks like what I&#39;ve<br/>
read--lots of tv, video games. And cards, board games, coloring, etc.<br/>
Because of what I&#39;ve read over the last 2 yrs, I don&#39;t believe that me<br/>
limiting tv or videos will positively affect me or my son&#39;s health. <br/>
 <br/>
 I read (here?) in regard to concerns about weight and/or food<br/>
issues--to add variety or healthy stuff to the food intake and not<br/>
focus on diet or restriction of unhealthy stuff. I really dig this<br/>
because it feels so much more loving to me. This is what I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
do in the past when I&#39;ve worried about food in our family. Add more<br/>
variety of foods and go outside and play more. And every thing&#39;s<br/>
optional, not some weird bossy drill sargent thing. <br/>
 So, with my DP&#39;s (and my own) concerns about my boy&#39;s<br/>
weight/health---how do I add the &quot;good stuff&quot; (i.e. exercise) when I&#39;m<br/>
limited physically right now? And ...how do I unschool the food? I<br/>
have to confess, food is the biggest issue for me to unschool. (That<br/>
and jackets actually. But now, when my boy says, &quot;But I&#39;m not cold.&quot; I<br/>
just breathe in and say, &quot;ok.&quot; with my outbreath.) <br/>
 <br/>
 I guess I used to allay my fears of too much fast food with playing<br/>
outside or some other exercise thing. Now, I&#39;m faced with not being<br/>
able to run around and do stuff so I&#39;m worrying about the fast food/no<br/>
exercise thing more.<br/>
<br/>
 So, I&#39;d love to get feedback on food and exercise and being<br/>
respectful and loving and trusting that every thing&#39;s going to be ok..<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751431078">How long are you going to be laid up? Does it really make a huge difference if you live a more sedentary life during your recovery? Does your son miss the more active aspects of his life? Where I am is solidly shorter and colder days, and Simon and Linnaea are less keen to go outside. Is this a more normal rhythm to your son&#39;s life that you&#39;ve missed noticing because school has come between you and your view of him? Is part of your worry about having time on your hands and doubt in your mind and concern that somehow you&#39;ve just jumped into the scariest waters you&#39;ve ever swum in? Is this more about your frustration with being idle than it is about his?<br/>
<br/>
If your son wants to be more active, if he is missing the moving and the biking, find a park you can drive to and put his bike in the back of the car and go. Encourage your husband to take him out without you. See if there is a zoo or a museum where they have wheelchairs for public use and go there. If he isn&#39;t missing the active life, if he is happy with the video games and the board games and the hanging out with you while you are on the mend, revel in that. How fantastic to think that your son is enjoying what you have on offer so much that he is happy to go slow, to just be with you. <br/>
<br/>
I suffer, mildly, from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SADs) so when the days grow shorter so does my temper. It is important for me to remember that, not only because I can self-medicate by getting outside more and being more active when everything in me is telling me to hunker down and eat, snarling at anyone who comes my way, but also because it means that my vision is skewed by my own unhappiness. It means that I may hear all the negative voices in my head speaking in a chorus about how badly my life is going and how I need to up what we are doing, and that I am failing everyone around me. Maybe something like that is happening to your happy thoughts? Maybe as you itch to move and dance and your toe keeps you painfully aware of your need to sit and heal, the voices of fear and doubt are coloring your view of your son? <br/>
<br/>
If I were you I would try and recognize the true root of my fears. You are walking a new path. You are taking your family by the hand and jumping in the deep end with no knowledge of how warm the water is (except, obviously, for the 2 years reporting by internet sources). I was trying to show a friend of ours how to swim the other day. Not even how to swim, but how to float in water. Y&#39;know the way if you relax and lie back, spreading your legs and arms out, the water will keep you bouyant? But he was too afraid of the power of the water, too afraid of his impending drowning to be able to relax. Just relax. Listen to the voices that made unschooling feel like the right thing. Let the water support you, don&#39;t let your fears drag you down. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239066034">One thing my DS (9) loves is a mini trampoline - he can bounce AND play<br/>
videogames most of the time (not all games but many work just fine). We<br/>
also do things like play &#39;pinball&#39; - I snuggle him a bit then give him a<br/>
bit of a nudge that sends him rocketing across the room, rebounding<br/>
(gently so he doesn&#39;t get injured) off and here and there. He<br/>
occasionally pops back toward me and I have to use my &#39;flippers&#39; (arms)<br/>
to push him back out and not let him past me. (Oh I&#39;m usually sitting in<br/>
a basic old chair for this game). We both get a bit of a workout with<br/>
this one. Can you ask your DH to set up a chair in the yard so that you<br/>
can sit outside and watch DS play/toss a ball together/toss a ball with<br/>
the dog? Not only is it moving a bit but you&#39;d get some sunshine which<br/>
is really a good thing. What about one of those $20 mini-exercise bikes?<br/>
They are basically just the peddles attached to a tensioner and can be<br/>
set onto a table to do upper body workouts with the arms (or set on the<br/>
floor to peddle like a bicycle while you watch TV or surf the Web).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Juillet!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really new here.  I&#39;m not new to unschooling although rather new to applying <br/>
unschooling to our lives. :)  I think I might be able to give you some suggestions but I&#39;m <br/>
leaving the deep unschooling advice to the veteran unschoolers on the list. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I caught how old your son is.  Is he old enough to walk the dog by himself? Or <br/>
maybe with you DP?<br/>
<br/>
Most of my suggestions are for you personally although your son could end up inerested <br/>
as he watches you.  You can still exercise with a broken toe... it just will look differently.  <br/>
Think about it... the rest of your body works, right? Do you have free weights?  And how <br/>
bout one of those big exercise balls?  There is so much you can do with those things.  <br/>
Course, the only thing with the ball that you would have to watch is if you lose your <br/>
balance and use your injured foot to stop.  You would have to be the judge as to whether <br/>
or not that would be a right for you.  But... free weights are great where you can sit in a <br/>
chair and work body parts.  You can do floor exercises too.  Just don&#39;t do anything that <br/>
would hurt your foot.  There are lots of CD&#39;s and books with lots of ideas.  I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
suggest something if you like.  The key is to keep your body active... moving in a way <br/>
that&#39;s safe for you.  It is possilbe.  It might not be what you&#39;re used to right now but I think <br/>
it would help you feel better.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 14.  He and I go to the gym together... have been for about a year.   This week <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that late at night he&#39;s up in his room with the free weights working out.  Next <br/>
thing I know he&#39;s coming down to juice.  It floors me that this boy juices.  Not all the time <br/>
but often.  Most kids his age won&#39;t even eat vegetables much less juice them ... LOL.  I&#39;ve <br/>
not forced him to do any of this.  He does it on his own because the equipment is here and  <br/>
the example is set before him.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought for your son is a rebounder ... especially if he&#39;s too young for weight <br/>
lifting.  My kids have had so much fun on our rebounder.  Who doesn&#39;t like to bounce and <br/>
it is so healthy in so many different ways.  It works every cell in the body.  If it&#39;s something <br/>
you don&#39;t currently have maybe try looking for a good one on Ebay.  I just don&#39;t <br/>
recommend the cheap $25 ones.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps in some way.<br/>

direction For Yourself. You want to be able to do more, so what can <br/>
you do? Take up yoga? Swimming? Rent one of those hand-powered or <br/>
two-person bikes? Look into other sports options for folks with <br/>
disabilities? <br/>
<br/>
But the main thing, I think, is to own this as really your issue. <br/>
You are missing the exercise. Maybe if you get involved with <br/>
something your ds will be interested too, or willing to help out <br/>
(and maybe not, so be open to that possibility).<br/>

Others have made suggestions for your exercise needs and also suggested <br/>
a rebounder for your son. Another idea (if it&#39;s within financial range -<br/>
 new or used) is checking in with your son to see if he&#39;d be interested <br/>
in a trampoline. That would be great exercise and if you could park <br/>
yourself nearby, he&#39;d probably love the audience. If he enjoyed jumping <br/>
on it for half an hour and he had your attention for that half hour it <br/>
would be a pretty effective way of getting some regular exercise every <br/>
day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022504942">Thanks everyone for the valuable feedback! <br/>
I&#39;m looking at a few ideas that you folks put forth--owning my issues,<br/>
for one. My boy isn&#39;t nearly as interested in &quot;exercise&quot; right now as<br/>
I am. He loves what he&#39;s doing---playing games, reading, kicking back.<br/>
So I&#39;m going to get out my yoga ball (that&#39;s been packed away since<br/>
our last move!) and my yoga DVDs and treat myself to what *I&#39;m*<br/>
hankering for--physical movement!<br/>
 I&#39;m going to look around for a trampoline--my boy loves them. And<br/>
also, maybe Guitar Hero, Lunastix, and getting a larger archery bow<br/>
for him since he outgrew his old one. Those are good physical things<br/>
he&#39;s interested in.<br/>
I want to write more, but my boy&#39;s calling for me...I&#39;m still a bit<br/>
hung up with food and trust and working with a partner who is not as up on<br/>
unschooling as I am with regard to food especially. I&#39;ll write more<br/>
about specifics later though.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
