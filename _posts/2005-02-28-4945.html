<div id="ygrps-yiv-987218757">What a great question!  I think I had already done much healing before  I had <br/>
ever even pondered homeschooling.  I went through a period where it  felt <br/>
right to write down goals and things I wanted to happen for myself and my  <br/>
family.  I guess it helped me feel &#39;in the moment&#39; at that time.  It  took me awhile <br/>
to refine this statement, but eventually my favorite affirmation  to write <br/>
was &quot;My family learns in peace and joy&quot;.  I would write it over  and over and <br/>
feel very peaceful.<br/>
 <br/>
My preconceived ideas of how that statement would be fulfilled looked  pretty <br/>
different than unschooling (had no ideas about that at all) but more like  <br/>
happy, ideal schools.  Then, as my oldest entered preschool, it fell way  short <br/>
of that image in my head.  I started looking into homeschooling, but  it <br/>
didn&#39;t sit right with me either and my child was never going to do any sort  of <br/>
&quot;work&quot; with me.   I felt very confused.<br/>
 <br/>
Then one day, following the little rabbit trails of homeschooling links on  <br/>
the web, I read about unschooling.  EUREKA!  The heavens parted and I  swear I  <br/>
could almost hear voices in my head shouting &quot;this is it!  do  this!&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, it took a lot of courage, but I have never doubted that I am exactly  <br/>
where I am supposed to be.  I never quite know what to answer when people  ask <br/>
me why I homeschool...I really want to say &quot;because God made me do it&quot;.  <br/>
