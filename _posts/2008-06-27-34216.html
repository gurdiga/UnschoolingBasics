<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044173253">Hi - Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for websites for my son <br/>
Li to make his own computer games.  He can read a few words on his own <br/>
and I can help him with the rest.  I just asked him what kind of game <br/>
he is most interested in making and he said &quot;fighting.  Like Pirates <br/>
of the Carribean.&quot;  Well, if anyone has any suggestions, we&#39;d love <br/>
them!  Thanks!  Laurie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102014907">My son and his friend have used Game Maker- they are older but maybe <br/>
your son could do it with help. Pretty sure this is a free download- <br/>
Google it-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177255840">Roblox.com<br/>
Its free. It is easy! <br/>
He can make games with scripting or not. <br/>
MD&#39;s characters are (he is 6)<br/>
mario555555<br/>
TYLERMCBROAD<br/>
greystripewarrior<br/>
FLAMERIDER64II<br/>
He plays more with mario555555 and has made more games under him.<br/>
You can make one game per character free , if you want more than you have to get the menbership ( not expensive)<br/>
There are lots of pirates games in it and lots of youtube movies of Roblox.<br/>
If he joins send us a friend request and a message!<br/>
