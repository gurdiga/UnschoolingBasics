<div id="ygrps-yiv-864310508">We have really large bean bag thing that sits in our living area. Everyone <br/>
in the house loves it, including the animals. Today two of my dogs and one <br/>
cat were all sleeping on it and my 9 year old said, &quot;Mom look! The animals <br/>
made a family bed!&quot; Too cute!<br/>
