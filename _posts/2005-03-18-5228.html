<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829856518">My wife and I just started home schooling our two children. We are planning<br/>
on using the &quot;unschooling&quot; method and know nothing about home schooling. We<br/>
would like advice, recommended websites and software for middle school and<br/>
k-2nd. We would also like any recommended textbooks and local programs for<br/>
interaction between home schooled children.<br/>

<br/>
Well, that could be to your advantage if you want to unschool :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Textbooks?   What are textbooks?  My kids&#39; textbooks are the books <br/>
that they want to read.  Sometimes that means Scooby-Doo on  Zombie <br/>
Island and sometimes that means The Encyclopediea of Animals.  We <br/>
have no prescribed textbooks or programs.  <br/>
<br/>
Check the links section as there are some links to some awesome <br/>
websites that talk about unschooling and how to incorporate that <br/>
into your life.  I highly recommend The Unschooling Handbook (OK, <br/>
I&#39;m biased, one of my friends is one of the families in that book <br/>
LOL!) and anything from John Holt (especially his later works).  <br/>
<br/>
I never announced to my kids that we were going to &quot;unschool.&quot;  I <br/>
just started letting go of my control issues and allowed them to <br/>
live.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that there are some active groups in central Florida.  I <br/>
think there is even an inclusive home/unschooling group in your <br/>
area.  I&#39;m taxing my brain to remember what it is.  I get periodic <br/>
announcements from that area and wish that I lived closer so we <br/>
could do some of those activities.<br/>
