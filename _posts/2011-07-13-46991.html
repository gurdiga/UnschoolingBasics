<div id="ygrps-yiv-573108597">Hi All.<br/>
<br/>
My dd will be 4 in a couple of weeks and she really wants to  dig up some dinosaur bones, so <br/>
I was looking into different products.  There seem to be a fair number of them, so I wanted to see if anyone has any experience with them, likes and dislikes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

They will take your family out on a dig.  They also have dinosaur day camps once your kids get to be 8, I think.  We drove hundred of miles numerous times in my daughter&#39;s childhood to take her here!<br/>

Not quite the same as dirt digging, but one fun related activity we have done is &quot;Ice Age Dinos&quot; -- I took a fairly large clear plastic box (has to be able to still fit in your freezer, but we have a 2nd one in the garage), filled it with a couple bags of ice from the grocery store, put some plastic easter eggs with toy dinos inside them into the ice, then filled the spaces with water.  The ice helps the toys not all float to the top or sink to the bottom.  Then I froze the whole thing.<br/>
 <br/>
We took it out onto the back patio and dumped it out - a huge ice cube with frozen stuff inside, and the kids whacked and chipped away at it with various implements to excavate the dinos.  <br/>
 <br/>
They just asked me the other day if we could do it again this year. :)  They really love the Ice Age movies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303383961">We joined our local paleontological society. (We live in New York City. You might have a similar group near where you live.) They host various digs (abd ither dino-related activities for kids abd adults) in our area and elsewhere. We&#39;ve gone in a few day trips and had a great time. If you&#39;re ready for a bigger adventure, there are several places in western US (don&#39;t know where you are located) who run dino excavation trips for families.<br/>
<br/>
On a smaller scale, we&#39;ve purchased lots of small dinosaur excavation kits that have been great. My kids love them so much that I started to buy the kits by the case (seriously!) because they were about half the cost as in our local toy store. You can make similar kits by getting bones (replica dino bones or we tried it with chicken bones, too) and drop them into wet plaster and let it set. <br/>
<br/>
If you live near NYC, the natural history museum has a few simulated full-scale dig sites -- one at the special sauropod exhibit and a smaller one in the children&#39;s Discovery Room. The museum provides eye protection and chisels. (Do call ahead to make sure that these digs are still running.)<br/>
<br/>
What fun!!<br/>
