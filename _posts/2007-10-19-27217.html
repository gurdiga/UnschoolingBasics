<div id="ygrps-yiv-31257884">OK, this might be a bit OT, but I try anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dear friend who is teacher and who has 3 kids approximately <br/>
my kids&#39;age. Of course we have long talks about education whenever we <br/>
can - we are very close for certain things and for other, our views <br/>
are completely opposite ! But we like sharing and learning from each <br/>
other, so ... (and she&#39;s the sweetest person I know, but this is <br/>
another question :))<br/>
<br/>
She told me recently that she gave money to her 9 yo daughter when <br/>
the girl was doing her homework without &quot;fighting&quot;. I was a bit <br/>
surprised and told her that I wouldn&#39;t do that, that it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
like a good idea to me. Anyway. After this talk, I started <br/>
brainstorming : what could she do to solve this homework problem <br/>
(except from unschooling, which is not possible yet as she is the <br/>
breadwinner and her husband would certainly not hear about it !)<br/>
WITHOUT forcing her daughter in a way or another. <br/>
<br/>
This is the ideas I had :<br/>
<br/>
- have a real (I mean friendly) discussion with her daughter to <br/>
understand why she doesn&#39;t want to do her homework : is it because <br/>
she finds the task tedious, is it because she&#39;d rather rest a bit <br/>
after a school day, is it because she&#39;d rather do something else with <br/>
her mother, etc. <br/>
- find ways to make her homework more playful (my friend told me <br/>
about multiplication facts and verbs tenses) and more meaningful too. <br/>
- imply her daughter in the process : ok, your teacher wants you to <br/>
learn these things and it&#39;s really not interesting. What could we do ?<br/>
<br/>
I also thought of a few ways to play with multiplication facts, so <br/>
that they could learn them without sitting at a table, with my <br/>
friend &quot;quizzing&quot; her daughter. Someone said once that you should <br/>
never quizz a kid about something s/he doesn&#39;t know. If she knows, <br/>
it&#39;s fun, you can do it together, try to be quick, and so on, but if <br/>
she does not, she will feel miserable.<br/>
<br/>
I know that here is a list where we talk about unschooling and not <br/>
about &quot;pleasant schooling&quot;, but my idea is to help my friend to see <br/>
things differently and find other solutions, solutions in which her <br/>
daughter would be really taken seriously. I&#39;m not trying <br/>
to &quot;convince&quot; her into unschooling, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. I <br/>
just want to slightly  move her viewpoint, so that she won&#39;t tell me <br/>
anymore (and won&#39;t think it, either) &quot;but what else can I do ? I&#39;m <br/>
tired of fighting with her&quot;. She is very interested in my unschooling <br/>
process, and the discussions we have are really open. <br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t read English either, because if she did, I would have <br/>
given her a few useful links ;p<br/>
<br/>
If there is any suggestion ... :)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571902830">She might also help her dd come up with helpful tricks and mnemonics<br/>
-- some can be silly, like &quot;7 and 8 make the 56th state&quot; (one my ds<br/>
came home with in elementary school), or the 9 times digits all add up<br/>
to 9, and such.  Skip counting can help, too, or using the facts you<br/>
know to figure out the facts you don&#39;t.  (7x8, for instance -- when I<br/>
have a brain fart, I rely on 7x7 = 49 and add another 7; takes longer,<br/>
but I get there, and for some reason the squares are easier to<br/>
remember.  7x8, btw, is, for some strange reason, one of the harder<br/>
ones for most to remember.  Go figure.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it is great that you and your friend can have those<br/>
conversations, and that she is open to alternative ways of looking at<br/>
things!  It&#39;s always best when we don&#39;t set up adversarial relationships!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715669785">As a teacher myself I believe parents should be able to make decisions about whether or it is wise to fight with children about completing homework tasks.  It defeats the whole idea about learning.  I have taught for 20 years and I have never assigned homework.  It was always available on the way out the door if kids wanted to do more of what they did in school but it was never mandated.  Home time is too precious and really shouldn&#39;t be spent in a battle about school.  There are no real studies that homework improves academics until perhaps high school.  This is one of the many reasons I took my kids out of school and while I struggle with the whole idea still, our family life is less stressful, my kids are calm, happy and there are no battles to fight around homework.  <br/>
   <br/>
  On another note, I still feel a little anxious about what both Kora and Lukas stay away from.  It is now about five months into the deschooling process and while I certainly see some moves away from screen time, I find myself in some turmoil over their lack of interest in reading and writing.  I do look hard to see that they are reading it just isn&#39;t consistent and they rarely take themselves through a novel...which they used to love to do...They are both amazing writers but this isn&#39;t part of their daily lives at all.  I am not so worried about academics I just keep feeling sad about how much they used to enjoy both reading and writing and how much we have made it part of our lives and now it seems to keep fading.  I suppose I have to keep trusting the process....and I will...but I wander if this will come back....Thanks for the support....donna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844171262">Another good one (and you have these where ever you go) is your hands which are great for the 9 times table... put the first (left) pinky down, everything to the right of it is the answer to 1x9.. 2nd finger down gives you 1 finger on the left and 8 on the right to make 2x9=18... 9x6, put your right thumb away & you&#39;ll see five fingers on the left hand & 4 to the right to make 54 & so on... I learned this in elementary school from another kid & one of my boys learned it from a teacher in 2nd grade... <br/>
<br/>
This particular teacher was more unschooly than most & I loved talking to him: he believed in kids, didn&#39;t talk down to them & gave them &quot;harder&quot; work than they were &quot;supposed&quot; to have in 2nd grade because it was fun, not because they had to & the kids (at least my kids) loved what he taught & him...sadly he didn&#39;t stay with the elementary school, but was working at the middle school.. elementary schools need teachers like him... oh well... no biggie cuz my guys aren&#39;t in that district anymore... <br/>

screen time, I find myself in some turmoil over their lack of <br/>
interest in reading and writing.<br/>
*********************<br/>
<br/>
It might help you to keep in mind that kids (people in general) go <br/>
through cycles of interest and growth. I&#39;ve seen that with <br/>
my &quot;always&quot; unschooled 6yo - for months she was alllllll about <br/>
drawing, but then her interest waned and for awhile, while she was <br/>
doing things all the time, she didn&#39;t really have a major passion <br/>
going on. Then all of a sudden she was all about cutting things out <br/>
of paper - it was as though the &quot;drawing&quot; part of her was &quot;under <br/>
construction&quot; and now its something more elaborate. <br/>
<br/>
Other things, like reading or singing, she has cycles of interest <br/>
and disinterest. She doesn&#39;t seem to be growing in those areas <br/>
during the times of disinterest, she just finds other things more <br/>
fascinating for a time.<br/>
<br/>
******************<br/>
  I do look hard to see that they are reading it just isn&#39;t <br/>
consistent and they rarely take themselves through a novel...which <br/>
they used to love to do...They are both amazing writers but this <br/>
isn&#39;t part of their daily lives at all. <br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consistent&quot; is an expectation that school fosters. Kids are <br/>
expected to read every day, write every day, do math problems every <br/>
day. That doesn&#39;t really reflect the way people persue interests in <br/>
real life. While its true that some people are avid readers life-<br/>
long, most &quot;readers&quot; go through phases - get all wrapped up in one <br/>
author, for example, and then move on to another. Or one genre. Same <br/>
thing with movies - ever had the urge to see absolutely everything <br/>
that Robin Williams ever performed in (for example, maybe you prefer <br/>
Woody Allen)? <br/>
<br/>
Writing is similar - some people do write every day, but they don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily write the same things every day. One of my favorite <br/>
authors (Mercedes Lackey) says she likes to have a whole bunch of <br/>
projects going at once so that when she&#39;s not feeling creative in <br/>
one she can put it down and pick up another.<br/>
<br/>
***screen time***<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to pull this phrase out and ask you to analyze it a bit <br/>
more. If your kids previously read a lot of novels, in particular, <br/>
are they watching shows and movies and playing games that have novel-<br/>
like qualities? That was something I found *myself* doing when we <br/>
first got Netflix, and then again when I discovered fantasy role-<br/>
playing computer games (there aren&#39;t nearly enough of these!) I had <br/>
been &quot;trained&quot; to think that movies and shows and games were somehow <br/>
less than reading, but when I was able to step away from that I <br/>
could see how I was choosing to watch and play the same sorts of <br/>
things I would choose to read. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, boy, now I&#39;m thinking about the relationship between Charles <br/>
Dickens and series television as its now being produced.... too much <br/>
coffee.<br/>
