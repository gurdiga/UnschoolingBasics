<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356372035">No need for apologies. I agree there are too many labels used to pigeon-hole behavior deemed too unconventional or &quot;disruptive&quot; for the schools.  <br/>
I don&#39;t agree that medication is the always best alternative, but for some it is lifeline.  Psychiatrist and psychologist may not be able to point to a patient and claim a successful cure, but I know lives that have been positively changed by the intervention of the practice.  <br/>

Interesting how they cut the answers off too soon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not that I won&#39;t ever suffer again, but I have been &quot;cured&quot; from <br/>
depression twice and anxiety once. Does &quot;cured&quot; mean never happening <br/>
again? I don&#39;t think so because I can be &quot;cured&quot; from a sinus infection <br/>
that could come back. So if depression comes back, they can &quot;cure&quot; me <br/>
again. (Thank goodness---and my shrink! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think schizophrenia can be cured. It can be managed. I think <br/>
that&#39;s true for many mental illnesses. Management.<br/>
<br/>
Tests? Tests for illnesses? They want to do a blood test for paranoia? <br/>
For depression? For OCD? Not going to happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061749708">I didn&#39;t have a chance to respond to this yet, but wanted to...but like Kelly, I noticed that <br/>
they cut off a lot of answers, just as the doctor was taking a deep breath to continue. I&#39;m <br/>
always suspicious of editing. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There may not be blood tests (although with some people blood tests can show a <br/>
decreased production of seratonin, and other brain chemicals who&#39;s lack will manifest as <br/>
mental illness), however, there are other visual tests (MRI&#39;s) that have shown that some <br/>
people are using different parts of the brain during certain emotional responses. I just <br/>
read a journal article about this...people with OCD or depresssion use the orbital frontal <br/>
cortex overly much, and medication will allow them to use different circuits. The use of <br/>
purely emotional portions of the brain leave them unable to use the logic circuits as most <br/>
people do, to be able to think of a route out of depression, or past washing their hands for <br/>
the 200th time. Very serious problems. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very touchy subject, especially on a board where we are discussing honoring our <br/>
children and allowing them to be their basic selves. However, the two of mine that I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of cannot be their basic selves when autism decreases their life&#39;s abilities. We <br/>
don&#39;t use medication, but we do use outside therapists, for the very reality that much of <br/>
autism&#39;s anger and depression *is* way beyond my means to deal with, just as my mothers <br/>
mental illnesses are way beyong my means to deal with. I don&#39;t leave it up to others to <br/>
&#39;fix&#39;, because I&#39;m in there with them, learning my own coping mechanisms.<br/>

editing is a tricsky thing ; )<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 i know exactly where you are coming from about the depression.  i am feeling managably cured myself these days. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think schizophrenia can be cured. It can be managed. I think <br/>
that&#39;s true for many mental illnesses. Management. <br/>
i had a friend whose brother needed a manager for his schizophrenia.  when he was young it was the family as he grew he felt he was well and left to be on his own.  soon he felt so well he didn&#39;t need his meds in the end the illness managed him and he died as a result of uncontrollable behaviors.  he was too ill to know he was ill most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tests? Tests for illnesses? They want to do a blood test for paranoia? <br/>
For depression? For OCD? Not going to happen.<br/>
 <br/>
only for research purposes,but it would be great to be able to narrow down the best pharmaceutical options for treatment.  To target the area or levels of balance needed would be a great improvement in treatment.<br/>
