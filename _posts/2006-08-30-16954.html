If a  child lives in a world where things are often beyond his/her <br/>
control,  don&#39;t go according to expectations and are more difficult than <br/>
s/he wanted  them to be, then there&#39;s likely to be whining whether it <br/>
*gets* them  anywhere or not. It&#39;s a lament rather than a simple <br/>
acceptance of fate and  can be an indication of a strong spirit rather <br/>
than a broken  one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****I want to agree with this, strongly!  Especially the expectation  part.  <br/>
I see in my own children (and now myself), a very vivid imagination  where <br/>
the desired thing is so real in their minds.  They see themselves  playing with <br/>
the toy, performing a particular action and in my case, wearing a  certain <br/>
pair of shoes.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
When that doesn&#39;t come through....for whatever reason.....there is likely  to <br/>
be disappointment.  That disappointment will be shown in a variety of  ways, <br/>
including whining.  Validating goes a long way here &quot;you were really  looking <br/>
forward to playing with that toy, I&#39;m sorry we can&#39;t get to the store  today&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
My son went through a period of believing if he wished on a star that  <br/>
whatever he wished for would manifest in his bedroom.  That was a rough  time for <br/>
everybody.<br/>
 <br/>
No one ever wanted to go shoe shopping with me, that fantastic pair that I  <br/>
saw so vividly in my mind just did NOT exist!  I didn&#39;t want anything else.  <br/>
And when I did finally resign to the fact that I still needed a pair of shoes, I <br/>
 would have to go back to every single store probably more than once to find  <br/>
the ones that were the least offensive.  By the way, I am rarely like this  <br/>
anymore and if I am, I can do it on my own time and not depend on others to  <br/>
drive me or get involved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Leslie, Emily (my almost 14yo) and I are going through this very<br/>
thing with clothes.  We both have an ideal in our minds of what style<br/>
we are looking for (and both of us have different styles).  We are<br/>
both quite busty, so finding clothes (particularly shirts) is not<br/>
always so easy to begin with and then when you have this idea of what<br/>
you want nothing else will do.  We spent 5 hours one day just looking<br/>
for plain spaghetti strap tank tops and plain coordinating t-shirts.<br/>
We both did a lot of whining that day (commiserating whining).  We<br/>
whined about the stupid fashion industry having an unrealistic model<br/>
of what they think womyn&#39;s sizes are.  We whined at merchants for only<br/>
carrying limited quantities in larger sizes.  We whined at store<br/>
employees who showed little compassion in helping us find what we were<br/>
looking for.  We whined about it being hot (not at anyone in<br/>
particular - it just didn&#39;t improve our moods any!)   We whined at our<br/>
genes for giving us such odd shaped bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime you want a shopping partner to commiserate with come on down.<br/>
I&#39;ll take you to every shoe store in town 3 times if I have to and<br/>
only whine if we don&#39;t stop for lunch :)<br/>

Yay!!  I&#39;ve got a hideous formal deal-y coming up, let&#39;s go shopping  (and I <br/>
never miss lunch)!<br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t gotten crocs yet, but part of the reason is I suspect I will wear  <br/>
nothing else.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only person that feels this  way.<br/>
 <br/>
Waaaa!!  Nothing ever goes the way I envision it (including college,  any <br/>
club I&#39;ve ever joined, employment, etc. etc. etc.)!!!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just had to laugh at all this whining conversation.  I&#39;m really the  only <br/>
one that whines in our family....but I&#39;m very good at it!   &lt;g&gt;  My husband and <br/>
kids don&#39;t let me get away with it for very long  though.  After a few <br/>
minutes, they have this look between them all with the  raised eyebrows that lets me <br/>
know I&#39;ve gone on enough.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t whine about them....and it almost always means I either haven&#39;t had  <br/>
enough to eat or sleep.  Sometimes, I just need to go exercise.<br/>
 <br/>
This morning I sounded like this...&quot;.I&#39;m edgy and tired and I don&#39;t feel  <br/>
like mowing the lawn before the hurricane gets here.  I wish the sun would  come <br/>
out....I don&#39;t like it when it rains all day.  Dammit..I forgot to get  coffee <br/>
creamer and I don&#39;t feel like driving to the store but I hate not to have  <br/>
cream for my coffee&quot;....(That&#39;s the point where they do &quot;the look&quot; between them  <br/>
and I have to laugh because I know I must just sound ridiculous.)<br/>
 <br/>
They are always so sweet with me though...Broc offered to get some coffee  <br/>
creamer and the kids gave me hugs.  I am more aware of it then I used to  be and <br/>
can both stop it and laugh about it. <br/>
 <br/>
I hadn&#39;t really thought about it much before I read these recent posts but  <br/>
both my kids just never seem to have a reason to whine and they have these  <br/>
mellow personalities that don&#39;t lend themselves to it.  <br/>
