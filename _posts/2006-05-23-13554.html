<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429803138">I unschool my three children and my husband is very supportivebut the one thing that we both agree with is that our children have a bed time.  We have allowed them to stay up later than we did when they were in PS.  I believe in unschooling and think that my children are happier and are learning more than they ever would in a very structured enviornment.  I also feel that unschooling is different for every family  and you have to find the balance for your family and if our children ever begin to ask about a later bedtime then we as a family would discuss it and as a family we would have to discuss what is best for all of us including me and my husband.  Maybe taht is something you could do with your child is talk about the bed time and discuss your need for time with your husband.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290672147">My dh worked nights for about 2 years and late evening or night was really<br/>
the only time I had to relax by myself and unwind. This time was very<br/>
precious to me. I explained this to my dc, 7 & 9 and they totally<br/>
understood. We came up with the solution that when it got to be about 10:00<br/>
I would ask them to go get ready for bed but they knew that that didn&#39;t mean<br/>
they had to go to bed. They stayed up and watched TV or played comp. games,<br/>
read, played in their rooms, etc. They always tried to be quiet. After a few<br/>
weeks of this I got comfortable enough to go to sleep when they were still<br/>
up (they are both night owls and I&#39;m not). We talked a lot about safety<br/>
issues too. About sex- With dh working nights, the only time we could have<br/>
sex was during the day. We waited until they were busy with their own things<br/>
and told them we&#39;d be in our room if they needed us (they only came knocking<br/>
a couple of times). We turned on the TV or the radio just enough, but so<br/>
that we could still hear them. <br/>
<br/>
I would think that if you talk to your son about the time you and dh need<br/>
together he would understand and be very supportive. It will take some time<br/>
for you to feel comfortable and maybe some tweaking. Talk about safety<br/>
issues a lot too. Maybe buy a baby monitor until you feel more comfortable.<br/>
Children have an amazing capacity to understand and have sympathy for our<br/>
concerns, especially if approached in the right way. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS-Dh started working days just last week for the first time in 2 years. He<br/>
was surprised to find out that the kids didn&#39;t have a bed time. I was very<br/>
happy when we all transitioned so well. The kids were used to going to their<br/>
rooms to do quiet activities and I realized that they enjoyed this time to<br/>
unwind as much as I did. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301319598">I am teaching my children that everyone, even moms and dads, need some <br/>
alone time every now and then.  My children haven&#39;t been upset by this <br/>
because they too require alone time and have had no problems telling <br/>
the rest of us that they&#39;re going into their room to be alone for a <br/>
while.  We tell the kids we&#39;d like some alone time to talk and cuddle <br/>
like married people do.  We&#39;ve also gotten a little more flexible and <br/>
creative when finding alone time.  To be honest, our relationship and <br/>
togetherness are even closer now.  Mornings are a great time as <br/>
everyone is asleep.  Sometimes when my DH gets home from work, the <br/>
kids are engrossed in a video or game so we can have time alone then.  <br/>
It was a little strange to loosen up at first, but it just wasn&#39;t as <br/>
bad as I feared.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling for about the same amount of time as you and my dh and <br/>
I are too having to figure out our alone time.  We all had a big discussion <br/>
the other day about bed times and us wanting some time alone together.  My 8 <br/>
year old was extremely supportive and said he understood that sometimes his <br/>
dad and Iwould want some time alone together to have sex.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this was the right thing to do, but I was astounded at his <br/>
respect and complete understanding that adults do this and it felt ok too <br/>
for us to be having the discussion.<br/>

<br/>
This is the same thing we do in our family.  The kids go upstairs at <br/>
10PM and are free to stay up as long as they wish as long as they are <br/>
respectful to others in the house.  Also, this is VERY flexible.  It&#39;s <br/>
almost 10:30PM, and the boys are in the living room watching Most <br/>
Extreme on TiVo...mind you the living room is right outside my <br/>
bedroom, so it&#39;s not my favorite place for people to be when I&#39;m <br/>
trying to go to sleep.  The kids all have TV&#39;s in their rooms, big <br/>
change in philosophy for me, so it makes those late nights easy.  They <br/>
can watch something on live TV, a video or DVD or play a video game <br/>
together or alone.  <br/>
<br/>
The key is to respect those you live with by being quiet.  It&#39;s taken <br/>
some time, but we have gotten used to it.  Also, we are respectful of <br/>
those sleeping in in the morning.  I don&#39;t wake the kids up unless we <br/>
have previously planned something or they have specifically asked me <br/>
to do so.  As was mentioned on earlier posts, the teens seem to go <br/>
through a going to be late, sleeping in late thing.  All my HSers have <br/>
done it.  They must need it.<br/>

If you&#39;re not loud enough to wake him when he&#39;s upstairs asleep you&#39;re <br/>
probably not too loud when he&#39;s downstairs awake.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s ten. Let him know you need time alone together.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s ten. He should know enough about the birds and bees to realize <br/>
that his parents need some time together. Sex is a healthy bodily <br/>
function---just like eating and sneezing and pooping. Be open and <br/>
honest. Ask for alone time.<br/>
<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t have to be *just* for sex---it can be to discuss your <br/>
day or issues with work or in-laws or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
We tell our boys we&#39;d like to be alone for a bit. Duncan (10) knows not <br/>
to disturb us. He&#39;s usually too engaged in whatever he&#39;s doing to worry <br/>
about us anyway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217619246">Why not go to bed at your normal time and you and DH get up early <br/>
while the kid is still sacked out for your private time. Sometimes, <br/>
I&#39;ll snuggle with DS so he can fall asleep (he generally falls <br/>
asleep in our bed then I move him via his feet and my guiding back <br/>
to his room) but signal DH to wake me about half an hour after DS is <br/>
asleep so I can take him to his room and THEN we have private time - <br/>
I&#39;ve already had a bit of a nap, so I can be awake for a while <br/>
before going back to sleep and DH can sleep in (He&#39;s the at home <br/>
parent, I&#39;m at work by 8 am Mon-Fri). We also stay up late on <br/>
Fridays since I can sleep in on Saturdays. And we have a regularly <br/>
planned date night where DS spends a couple of hours at MIL&#39;s and DH <br/>
and I spend time - sometimes just sitting in the car sharing a 99 <br/>
cent Coke and talking and listening to music. Sometimes at a movie <br/>
or dinner or Starbucks. Sometimes we head home for intimacy. <br/>
Whatever. Maybe find a Saturday afternoon where you can trade kids <br/>
with a friend (someplace where your child likes to go play) and have <br/>
some alone time together. Then the next Saturday they get alone time <br/>
and you have a spare kid or two (which often means you&#39;ll have some <br/>
free time as well since the spare kids will help occupy yours). Even <br/>
things like going out for a drive in the evening often end up with <br/>
DS taking a power nap in the back seat and DH and I can talk quietly <br/>
about things that we need to discuss right away.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is being creative with things - private &#39;couple&#39; time <br/>
need not be at &quot;bedtime&quot; all the time. Oh, and, lots of <br/>
frequent &#39;checking in&#39; with each other often works better than <br/>
struggling to find a big chunk of time to discuss a whole week&#39;s <br/>
worth of issues.<br/>

need not be at &quot;bedtime&quot; all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s for sure!!<br/>
<br/>
My dh is usually tired before the rest of us. Because Jalen and Sierra<br/>
sleep in my room, next to the bed, we were always trying to tiptoe<br/>
around and be really quiet so dh could sleep after a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
We finally realized how stupid we were being, trying to have all of us<br/>
in the same room on different sleep schedules and rearranged<br/>
everything. Now, dh can sleep whenever he is tired and we can play and<br/>
be on the computer and do what we like as late as we want.<br/>
<br/>
We moved the Queen bed to his office in the basement, hauled Sierra&#39;s<br/>
single bed in here for me and now there&#39;s tons of space in my room and<br/>
dh can&#39;t hear us at night. GREAT!!<br/>
The other side benefit, is we&#39;ll have more privacy for alone time down<br/>
in his space since the kids never use that area for anything. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, forget the mainstream models of what &quot;works&quot;. Do<br/>
whatever works for your family, get creative and try to see that it&#39;s<br/>
all possibility, not limitations.<br/>

life. I have a hard time getting in the mood when I know that DS  is<br/>

 <br/>
Early morning is our best time. We are both rested and I know  that there is <br/>
no chance either child will be awake at 6:00 am unless they have  never gone <br/>
to bed.  Ours are 13 and 16 now but ever since they were much  younger, we have <br/>
closed the door when we want private time.  Also, we  really do like to take <br/>
naps if we have time during the weekend and the kids know  it&#39;s our time.  <br/>
They know they can yell or knock if there is a serious  problem.  I like to keep <br/>
our serious discussions out of the bedroom so if  we need to talk about <br/>
something private, we usually go for a walk  together.  <br/>
 <br/>
We extend that principle of respecting privacy here to everyone.  If  the <br/>
door is closed, we all knock and wait for the person in the room to invite  us <br/>
in.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d suggest trying out some different ideas and with time you&#39;ll find what  <br/>
works best for your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595748082">LOL - I&#39;m laughing because we have 5 kids here too.  The 16 yr old is sooo tired of me and my husband making sexual jokes and stuff.  She&#39;s constantly telling US to go to our room!  LOL.  The younger ones, ages 7,6, 3, and 1 don&#39;t always get that mommy and daddy need time alone.  But what we do is tell them (well, mostly the 7 and 6 yr old) that mommy and daddy are going into their room for a while, and then we lock our bedroom door (I don&#39;t want the 3 yr old barging in on THAT action!).<br/>
<br/>
We do have a limit on active nighttime activity.  By 10 pm everybody needs to be doing something quiet in their room.  Usually my 7 yr old ends up reading a story to her two brothers, and I put the one yr old to sleep in my bedroom.  My 16 yr old may stay on the computer, which is in the living room, and me and dh head to the bedroom and try to have some type of sex life. It gets a bit difficult with a one year old in the room with you, but we do what we can <br/>

  &lt;&lt;cuts into our adult time and sex life..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We have 5 children.  I have finally quit worrying about if the kids <br/>
  hear us, not that I&#39;m verbalizing with abandon, but dh and I are sexual <br/>
  being, the kids are sexual beings....it is very normal and good for us <br/>
  to be having sex.  I am not parading it in front of my kids but I&#39;m not <br/>
  ashamed and embarrassed of it either.  The kids know I defecate and <br/>
  urinate and have sex and eat and breathe.....all very basic body <br/>
  functions.<br/>
