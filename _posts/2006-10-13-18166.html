<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555968755">I need help. I&#39;m not sure if this is normal or not. SO, someone tell<br/>
me if it is. My son has known how to spell his name snice he was 3.<br/>
But lately, he has trouble spelling his name. He is 5. He is having<br/>
trouble with a lot of things. I am not sure if it&#39;s just normal<br/>
forgetting, or if something is wrong. He can&#39;t recall all of the<br/>
alphabet, counting from 1 to 10, or from 10 to 1. These are all things<br/>
a couple of weeks ago he didn&#39;t have trouble with. Is this normal?<br/>
Hmm, let me re-pharse this, is this something that little ones do?<br/>

Sometimes it is better to say the wrong thing and see if they correct you.  My kids love doing this.  Often they won&#39;t answer direct questions though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992105900">***...is this something that little ones do?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something everyone does.  When a person doesn&#39;t really have a need to <br/>
know something, doesn&#39;t have a use for it in daily life, it&#39;s normal to let <br/>
it slip away.   How many times does an unschooling five year old need to be <br/>
able to spell his name?  Count to ten?  Count backwards from ten?  How <br/>
useful is that in his life?   And isn&#39;t there someone who can help him with <br/>
that if it does come up?  (Mom, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking him to spell and count and count backwards?    Don&#39;t do that. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine.   He&#39;ll spell his name again, and count again.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we are in the middle of moving. When he is<br/>
counting or singing the alphabet song, it is his own<br/>
doing. I don&#39;t ask him to do it, to bait him into a<br/>
test of his knowledge. His forgetting, I just have<br/>
seemed to notice. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910641332">&quot;Is everything information based? Is he more clumsy or<br/>

<br/>
Yes, he is mixing up words. Like when he was younger<br/>
he never said yellow wrong. But lately it&#39;s lellow.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why. I know moving is effecting us all.<br/>
I&#39;m just not sure that&#39;s the cause. <br/>
<br/>
He will answer me wrong on purpose if I ask him a<br/>
question. He knows when he&#39;s being tested and will<br/>
show you his disproval. My parents do that to him, and<br/>
so he tells then the wrong answer, or something<br/>
totally inappropriate. Luckily they see past it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340651381">Thanks Deb,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind telling him how to spell his name. It&#39;s<br/>
just he seems to be forgetting a lot. So, I question<br/>
if there&#39;s more going on. <br/>
<br/>
Danie<br/>
Just waiting for moving day, so that moving stress<br/>
will be over. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps, Thanks to everyone who answered. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850375542">With my experience watching our seven grow, in and out of school <br/>
depending on the kids, I would say this happens at variant degrees for <br/>
many ages depending on the child.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, recently our 12-year-old, who has spent most of his <br/>
school years at home, misspelled his name.  If you think about it, <br/>
writing our name is not something we do a whole lot of, especially if <br/>
you are un/homeschooled at whatever level.  What importance is it <br/>
really to a 5-year-old?<br/>
<br/>
The more we do something the better we get at it and the more <br/>
automatic it becomes.  Seriously, I wouldn&#39;t worry unless you are <br/>
seeing other &quot;symptoms&quot; that may alarm you on more of a medical level.<br/>
