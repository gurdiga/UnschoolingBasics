<div id="ygrps-yiv-309755218">Joan, I just got Grossman&#39;s book on NVC in the mail last week.  I got it<br/>
because for a few years it has popped up in conversation in various<br/>
circles of mine.  I don&#39;t have time to read it right away, and just<br/>
wanted to thank you for your writing on the topic.  I have joined the<br/>
NVC parenting group, and that is wonderful as well.  Your posts<br/>
illuminate this process very clearly (to me).  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
