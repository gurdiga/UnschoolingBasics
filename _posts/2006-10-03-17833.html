<div id="ygrps-yiv-955277432">My ds is almost 7 and still pronounces his &quot;R&quot;s with a w sound. He is <br/>
quite articulate and has an amazing vocabulary and we just always <br/>
assumed that he would eventually grow out of his &quot;wascaly wabbit&quot; <br/>
stage. It&#39;s not even that bad (or maybe we&#39;re just used to it), and <br/>
since he&#39;s not in school, the subject has never been pointed out to <br/>
him and (thank god) he&#39;s never been teased. All that being said, I was <br/>
going to bring it up with his pediatrician at his 7 year check up next <br/>
month. I thought I&#39;d throw it out here as well to see if anyone has <br/>
had similar issues with their children, or any advice on the matter.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s seven.  this is a normal speech pattern for children of that age.<br/>
 Sure you could do speech therapy, but chances are pretty good that he<br/>
will outgrow the &quot;wascally wabbit&quot; speech at the same time with or<br/>
without speech therapy.  There are some studies done on speech<br/>
patterns and their natural evolution.  I&#39;ve watched my son&#39;s speech<br/>
patterns change over the past year.  He still sounds sometimes very<br/>
much like a 3 or 4 yo in his pronunciation, but I&#39;ve noticed recently<br/>
that he has some more mature speech patterns going on (he is 8 and<br/>
also has quite an extensive and amazing vocabulary).<br/>
<br/>
And there are quite a few very famous people who have speech patterns<br/>
that are considered &quot;bad&quot; (lisps, consonant issues, vowel<br/>
misrepresentations, etc.) who have never let those &quot;epidiments&quot; stop<br/>
them from their careers.  Even one of the most famous voice actors<br/>
(James Earl Jones) has a speech &quot;issue.&quot;  True.  You have to listen<br/>
closely to hear it, but it is there. Sean Connery is another who who<br/>
has a definite sh lisp.  Lauren Bacall also has a lisp.  Hasn&#39;t<br/>
stopped them from going places.<br/>
<br/>
If he still has a W problem when he is a grown up, he may decide that<br/>
he needs intervention.  I bet, though, that he will grow out of it in<br/>
the next few years though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722108816">My 7 yo has a speech issue as well.  Three years ago, during a traditional pediatrician &quot;well visit&quot;, our pediatrician suggested we take ds for speech therapy.  I did.  When I met with the therapist, I told her, &quot;This is Nikolas.  He has trouble getting stuck.  We need your help to unstick him.&quot;.  She laughed as if I was being funny and began &quot;treatment&quot; of Nik.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As I sat through session after session, there was nothing that she did that I could not.  She blew bubbles with him, asked him to slow down, modeled &quot;correct&quot; speech, read with him, worked on articulation, and a few more things.  Nothing earth shattering.  Nikolas really liked her and the time he spent with her.  So, we continued.  <br/>
   <br/>
  One day, she came out of the session visably frustrated.  She told me that she was no longer able to treat Nik because &quot;he doesn&#39;t realize he has a problem&quot; she said.  I told her that he never did have a problem and reiterated what I had told her on our first day.  We never went back.  She recommended all sorts of treatment options and whatnot.  No thanks.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Four years later, Nik still has &quot;speech issues&quot; (mostly articulation).  We choose to listen carefully to him and help him through it as necessary.  We have never labeled him as anything other than Nikolas (not speech impaired, needing speech anything).  I can tell you for a fact that his speech is *much* better than when he was being &quot;treated&quot; and he is, in fact, growing into more normal speech.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t take him to therapy again unless he requested it.  With us, it just wasn&#39;t necessary to Nik nor to me.  Yup, some people he doesn&#39;t know have trouble understanding him, but, those who take the time to really listen are easily able to understand.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186802754">Does he read? Sometimes these false pronunciations go away when they  <br/>
start to read. Then they realize that there are two different letters/ <br/>
sounds for what they thought was just one. Then they can really see  <br/>
where it is and can from then on hear it. He probably doesn&#39;t hear  <br/>
the difference, so why should he say it differently? It&#39;s a very  <br/>
slight difference!! Instead of going to an &quot;expert&quot; I would simply go  <br/>
to a specialist in ears (I dunno how they are called in English), and  <br/>
just check if he is hearing good. If yes, I wouldn&#39;t do anything  <br/>
else, and if no, then that&#39;s the real problem.<br/>
<br/>
And also, don&#39;t be afraid that he will never learn it. I think the  <br/>
english &quot;r&quot; is very easy for anybody to learn as adult even - take  <br/>
Germans, we don&#39;t have that sound in our system yet this sound is not  <br/>
the problem in German accents. Neither for Spanish people. While the   <br/>
&quot;th&quot; sound is a problem for many people, I&#39;ve never heard of an  <br/>
Englishlearner who couldn&#39;t pronounce the R (unlike the spanish,  <br/>
rolled R!).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do something, you could also show him, without  <br/>
pushing, how the R sound is made in your mouth. It&#39;s not difficult!  <br/>
You just like &quot;w&quot;, but you roll your tongue a bit backwards. This has  <br/>
time until he asks how the letter R would be pronounced or when it  <br/>
comes up naturally. I have English groups for kids aged 1-6 here in  <br/>
Germany, and they have the same &quot;problem&quot;, they say it like a &quot;w&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;u&quot;. But when I have showed them my tongue, how it rolls back,  and  <br/>
drew them pictures of how it looks like in the mouth and when I have  <br/>
showed with my hand how the tongue rolls back, they have usually  <br/>
gotten it very quickly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I noticed this with DS - several sounds that were &quot;fuzzy&quot; sharpened <br/>
up when he started reading things.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 8 now and still has a little trouble with &quot;th&quot; sounds (THings, <br/>
THree, weaTHer, wiTH, etc) - I just now and then, when it&#39;s just us, <br/>
remind him to &#39;bite his tongue&#39; - now he&#39;s occasionally asking <br/>
whether such and such a word has a TH if he&#39;s not sure and he self-<br/>
corrects his pronunciation based on that. I&#39;ve made a point of being <br/>
clearer in my own pronunciations, especially when I&#39;m responding to <br/>
DS &quot;There are Free episodes of Spongebob on!&quot; &quot;Wow, that&#39;s cool <br/>
THree episodes right in a row!&quot; I think it&#39;s basically that he has a <br/>
very flexible tongue (he can actually reach his nose with the tip of <br/>
his tongue) and it tends to &#39;roam&#39; a bit instead of sticking out <br/>
when needed. His tongue just needs a bit of exercise and training <br/>
and it&#39;s getting better rapidly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762034946">Talking about it when you are both alone is really a good idea, since  <br/>
I&#39;m being respectful to my child, I have noticed she highly  <br/>
apreciates it when I say things that might be embarassing only when  <br/>
we are alone (I didn&#39;t before, and wondered why she wouldn&#39;t listen  <br/>
to me).<br/>
<br/>
But the example Deb brought up – I think this would be a good time, a  <br/>
natural situation, in which one could point out what a difference it  <br/>
makes. I&#39;d rather point out that it sounds like they were free,  <br/>
whereas the others one has to pay for. I think most of these  <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; come from not really hearing the difference, and they are  <br/>
mostly not aware of it because we kind of understand anyway, so how  <br/>
would they even think of it? In a situation like this, I&#39;d rather  <br/>
point out the difference it makes, because just saying &quot;th&quot; louder  <br/>
won&#39;t help telling the very slight differences between f and th. Well  <br/>
maybe it helps ;-) I dunno.<br/>

accompanied by clarification, discussion, assistance, etc. Reminding <br/>
him that it&#39;s a &quot;th&quot; word for instance, might help. It took me a <br/>
while of silently and consciously saying &quot;free - three&quot; over and <br/>
over until I could pinpoint a simple reminder or &#39;hint&#39;. For my DS, <br/>
pointing out the &quot;do we have to pay for it or not?&quot; type things <br/>
would more likely lead to frustration than a simple reminder that it <br/>
is a &#39;th&#39; word. So, I agree that just saying it louder is less <br/>
helpful than it could be and does nothing to really address the <br/>
situation (providing help with how to identify and pronounce the <br/>
sound) - guess I didn&#39;t clarify my point well enough.<br/>
