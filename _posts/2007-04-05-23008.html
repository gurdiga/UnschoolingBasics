<div id="ygrps-yiv-296072694">Hey folks I joined this group months ago and have gleaned lots of <br/>
helpful information from all of you.  I don&#39;t write much because I <br/>
am just a newbee to this whole realm. I am writing because I just <br/>
need to vent/talk to those who may understand my frustration.  <br/>
Here&#39;s my thoughts.....<br/>
<br/>
First, I work at a daycare as a pre-school teacher and luckily I get <br/>
to take my two children with me (4 and 1&gt;) However, it is so <br/>
difficult to strive to live one way (unschooling, consensual, etc) <br/>
with my children but have to work where I have to follow &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>
ideas and  such... So what I need help with is advice on how to turn <br/>
my thoughts into a more positive aspect and possibly throw a little <br/>
unschooling in my pre-school.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one dilemma -- unfortunately I have to follow the typical pre-<br/>
school routine where we cover the days of week, letter, and numbers <br/>
etc and unfortunately my boss wants me to still do flash cards --- <br/>
yuck.  I feel like we can use them once a week but more than that ---<br/>
 boring... I like to get the letters in my using them, plain all <br/>
coping/tracing them,  and making cool crafts that entail letters and <br/>
numbers etc.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, she is pretty typical in &#39;discipline&#39; -- she wants them <br/>
quieter than I would expect in turn that makes me always trying to <br/>
keep the quiet.  She made a comment today that basically said that <br/>
they were great kids the two days I was off -- but seemed antsy, <br/>
louder, etc when I&#39;ve been there (let&#39;s not take into consideration <br/>
that today we had a easter party??!!).  Now I agree that sometimes I <br/>
can be on edge and snappier with the kids by I am constantly <br/>
striving to make there environment fun and safe.  I always try not <br/>
to yell however sometimes when the whole group is crazed and just <br/>
don&#39;t hear me when I&#39;ve talked at a lower tone or normal voice I <br/>
will raise mine so they can hear me.  (again boss doesn&#39;t like me to <br/>
yell -- and neither do I but I&#39;m not sure what to do to get their <br/>
attention -- ideas??)  Basically -- dilemma is how to get the kids <br/>
calmed down and listen without yelling, having to sit them down <br/>
physcially, or give any type of time outs???&gt;???  <br/>
<br/>
Now at home I try to let my child live more freely, make choices, <br/>
but living between these two worlds I have to often refer back to <br/>
some of your ideas her at unschooling basics...  I am a quick one to <br/>
yell but am constantly unlearning this learned behavior but...??..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I started having so many thoughts at once I don&#39;t know where <br/>
to turn this e-mail yet so I&#39;ll leave here and wait for some advice <br/>
and thoughts ... <br/>
<br/>
I hope someone out there can understand where I&#39;m trying to go here <br/>
or what I&#39;m trying to explain .... Help!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of sensitive so please, please understand I am still un-<br/>
learning -- unschooling myself and haven&#39;t even completely made our <br/>
own home an unschooled home --- yet I want to put a little <br/>
unschoolilng in my pre-school</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926890488">I am new, too, so I am not sure I have any advice. I have problems interfacing the conventional world with unschooling at times, too.  But what shines through your post is your earnest honesty, your self-examination, your consciousness of the challenges.  It seems to me that should help a lot!  Cameron <br/>

They have great ideas on how to share cool stuff with the kids but  <br/>
the administration wants accountability and ties their hands. It&#39;s  <br/>
why so many teachers burn out.<br/>
<br/>
She has a right to run her preschool how ever she wants. If you  <br/>
aren&#39;t teaching in the way she wants for her school, it&#39;s her right  <br/>
to let you go.<br/>
<br/>
Can you find another school that&#39;s more play centered and less school  <br/>
prep centered? They do exist.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a mom asks what she should do about a child who hits, the answer  <br/>
is to be proactive *before* the hitting starts. Be aware of what  <br/>
dynamic leads to hitting and change it and defuse it.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re getting loud then you need to change the dynamic before  <br/>
they get to the point where you need to raise your voice. It&#39;s a  <br/>
special skill that I know I don&#39;t have ;-) but I know some people are  <br/>
able to sense what to do and which child to go to to change the dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
You need to figure out how to calm the waters before they reach  <br/>
tsunami proportions. That doesn&#39;t mean shushing them all the time. It  <br/>
means redirecting energy that&#39;s building up. You could ask your  <br/>
director or another teacher who seems to be able to exude calm into  <br/>
the room.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think you can do unschooling in a room full of kids who  <br/>
are used to being controlled. Even at home when someone&#39;s starting  <br/>
out unschooling parenting, it&#39;s common for kids to go wild when  <br/>
controls are removed until they figure out the new way things work.  <br/>
(And it&#39;s why we suggest not removing all the controls at once and  <br/>
just saying &quot;yes&quot; more.)<br/>
<br/>
The kids you have are probably controlled at home. If they come to  <br/>
school where it feels like control is a little iffy, they *will* go  <br/>
wild and *will* test boundaries. It&#39;s what control does to kids. It&#39;s  <br/>
like school kids on a field trip. A goodly proportion are loud and  <br/>
they push boundaries when they&#39;re out of school. If you had full  <br/>
freedom at the preschool to help them understand what freedom feels  <br/>
like, and had a good sense of how to work the dynamic of a room, it  <br/>
could work, but being wishy washy on control is a recipe for disaster  <br/>
I think. And your director has different ideas anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706143996">I&#39;ve got some suggestions for you...my DH and I used to <br/>
have &quot;bus/cafeteria duty&quot; for one of our church&#39;s kids ministries, <br/>
we are Cub Scout leaders, and have had kids in PS while trying to <br/>
unschool at home...needless to say, unschooling is just easier if <br/>
you are not exposing them to 2 different standards on a daily <br/>
basis.  We eventually pulled both our kids out and even though some <br/>
schooly stuff still runs through our heads on occasion...we&#39;re much <br/>
more at peace now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;///&gt; Here&#39;s one dilemma -- unfortunately I have to follow the <br/>
typical pre-school routine where we cover the days of week, letter, <br/>
and numbers etc and unfortunately my boss wants me to still do flash <br/>
cards --- yuck.  I feel like we can use them once a week but more <br/>
than that ---  boring... I like to get the letters in my using them, <br/>
plain all coping/tracing them, and making cool crafts that entail <br/>
letters and numbers etc.&lt;///&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IMO, there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with using those things <br/>
as &quot;tools&quot;...as long as that&#39;s how you see them.  Kind of <br/>
a, &quot;which &#39;tool&#39; are we going to use today?&quot;, mentality.  My DD <br/>
loved flash cards when she was that age...something she ASKED to do <br/>
on a daily basis.  So we did them, because she thought they were fun <br/>
not because I thought she needed them...I had to see them as a tool <br/>
or a game...then it really did get fun!  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could start giving your kids the &#39;choice&#39; of what &#39;tool&#39; <br/>
they want to use for learning their letters/numbers that day.  You <br/>
would end up with a child-led variety and you might discover they <br/>
don&#39;t think flash cards are as boring as you think...and may have <br/>
other &#39;do-able&#39; ideas you hadn&#39;t thought of (kids are really smart <br/>
and creative, you know?).<br/>
<br/>
You could also make the flash cards into games like &#39;Memory&#39;: where <br/>
you turn them all face down and they turn one over then try to match <br/>
it with the next fliped up card...you&#39;ll need 2 decks but it&#39;s <br/>
a &quot;quite game&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;///&gt; Plus, she is pretty typical in &#39;discipline&#39; -- she wants them <br/>
quieter than I would expect in turn that makes me always trying to <br/>
keep the quiet.  [...]  I always try not to yell however sometimes <br/>
when the whole group is crazed and just don&#39;t hear me when I&#39;ve <br/>

Basically -- dilemma is how to get the kids calmed down and listen <br/>
without yelling, having to sit them down physcially, or give any <br/>
type of time outs???&gt;???  &lt;///&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand the tendancies to want to yell...I think it&#39;s a hard <br/>
habit for anyone to break.  However, I must say that I agree with <br/>
what Joyce said, try to stop [the noise] &#39;before&#39; it gets out of <br/>
hand.  But I also understand how hard that can be with a large group <br/>
of kids. <br/>
<br/>
Something that the PS system here has adopted (I actually think it <br/>
was a positive tool/action and was impressed) is to &quot;turn the lights <br/>
out&quot;.  If the class/cafeteria is getting too noisey (which is any <br/>
noise at all...ugh!  They&#39;re kids, they&#39;re supposed to be <br/>
noisey...and it&#39;s their &#39;free-time&#39;!) the teacher/monitor turns off <br/>
the light switch without ever saying a word to the class.  The kids <br/>
know when the lights go out that they need to get quiter for the <br/>
lights to come back on.  Once the room is back to the desired noise <br/>
level the teacher flips the lights back on.  (However, somedays when <br/>
I would visit my kids at PS/lunch, the lights stayed off all <br/>
day...UGH!)  <br/>
<br/>
You could play it as a &quot;quiet game&quot;...explain to the kids that the <br/>
lights have &quot;volume sensitive &#39;ears&#39;&quot; and that when the noise hurts <br/>
the light&#39;s &#39;ears&#39; they&#39;ll go out...but when the noise doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>
anymore they&#39;ll come back on.  You could say that the noise gives a <br/>
headache to the lights and so they have to shut their &#39;eyes&#39;...maybe <br/>
I&#39;m getting too carried away.  Anyway...I think you get the point.  <br/>
Then &#39;practice&#39; getting loud...lights going off, getting <br/>
quiet...lights coming on.  You could even &quot;time&quot; how long it takes <br/>
for everyone to get quiet and try to &quot;beat&quot; records.<br/>
<br/>
You might try playing the &quot;opposite game&quot;.  If you say, &quot;get <br/>
loud&quot;...it means get quiet, if you say, &quot;run&quot;...it means walk, if <br/>
you say &quot;stand&quot;...it means sit, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is make EVERYTHING a game!  Do not see things as <br/>
rules or &#39;have-to&#39;s...see them a games and choices.  Try to find <br/>
ways to make the boring interesting and the wild more organized by <br/>
using F.U.N. (freedom, unschooling, & nature/nurture).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121154899">Dear Joyce,<br/>
   <br/>
  I was so glad to get a couple responses on this issue!!  Thank you for your thoughts.  I will definitely look at how to find calm the waters before they escalate.  Unfortanately, my director isn&#39;t very good at this either.  However, I think  I&#39;m on the verge of figuring out a couple of things.   Yesterday, our fellow co-worker let the pre-school and he was so laid back that I think the kids followed suit.  And one thing he said is that he knows I worry about this and that and especially what my director/boss wants/says and he doesn&#39;t.... Sooo... maybe if I just learn to tune out any other thoughts except the fun we can have learning and what I have on the agenda...???  Anyway this is my very first year teaching beyond substitute teaching  and student teaching.  I guessing that I would have to go through some of this whether I had some unschooling thoughts or not.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I do understand it is my directors pre-school/daycare and she can run it any way she would like --- however she isn&#39;t very consistant --- oh well-- I&#39;ll just keep trucking along and keep finding a common ground with her -- and keep striving for a peaceful day. <br/>
   <br/>
  You had mentioned to observe someone else that exudes calm == however, that isn&#39;t my boss either/// but when she had another day care she said her girl over there was great at keeping the kids calm.  Hopefully I can pop over to that day care and watch her for a few hours///??  Again thanks  for the input ...  I feel calmer already<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
         <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728517415">Julie,<br/>
   <br/>
    between you and Joyce so far I&#39;m starting to feel less frustrated!!!  I don&#39;t know why diffusing the situations before their crazed didn&#39;t come to mind.  I think I recognize the feeling of the frenzy started but I miss the cue that would keep it from a full scale tidal wave...<br/>
   <br/>
  Some of our &quot;problem&quot; is that we have 2 1/2 year olds - 6 year olds in our pre-school.  Unfortunately sometimes my 5 or 6 year olds can almost be more disruptive than a 2 1/2 year old. Or at least I expect more from my 5 year olds than my 3 year olds!! My director and I have talked about separating these children but it never happens.    Anyway,  I try apply the lessons and such to all of them (just like I would if I was in a class room full of 5 year olds that all have different learning abilities..)<br/>
   <br/>
  That leads me to another thought.  One of my other co-workers boys is usually there for our pre-school than has to go off to another..  Her childs teacher practically said that her child is acting like he does in her classroom because of our pre-school/daycare setting.  This is my thoughts.. at the day care her child is learning to play with all ages and I don&#39;t put in constraints when it comes to &#39;testing&#39;....  So to me if one 4 year old can recognize and say the alphabet great !! but if another one says the alphabet but doesn&#39;t recognize the letters well that great too...!!! (thanks to unschoolers helping me to recognize that all children will learn at their own pace) Sure at times I am surprised when a 4 year old can&#39;t use scissors but......  have to catch myself here and realize it is all good1! <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Oh and on your thought on tools we do have quite a few games to use like shape, alphabet, number bingo and such.  And when it comes to &quot;math&quot; I try to make it game like and copy lots of creative ideas from the internet and books out there for different play centers.  <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Heck the more I write you folks I realize that I can do this... I just need to keep using tools and finding ways to make it fun...I think I do what you said and actually ask the kids which things they like best.... I have found out already they really love music. <br/>

the light&#39;s &#39;ears&#39; they&#39;ll go out...but when the noise doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>
anymore they&#39;ll come back on. You could say that the noise gives a <br/>
headache to the lights and so they have to shut their &#39;eyes&#39;...maybe <br/>
I&#39;m getting too carried away. Anyway...I think you get the point. <br/>
Then &#39;practice&#39; getting loud...lights going off, getting <br/>
quiet...lights coming on. You could even &quot;time&quot; how long it takes <br/>
for everyone to get quiet and try to &quot;beat&quot; records.<br/>
<br/>
You might try playing the &quot;opposite game&quot;. If you say, &quot;get <br/>
loud&quot;...it means get quiet, if you say, &quot;run&quot;...it means walk, if <br/>
you say &quot;stand&quot;...it means sit, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is make EVERYTHING a game! Do not see things as <br/>
rules or &#39;have-to&#39;s...see them a games and choices. Try to find <br/>
ways to make the boring interesting and the wild more organized by <br/>
using F.U.N. (freedom, unschooling, & nature/nurture).<br/>
