<div id="ygrps-yiv-883033561">My youngest, who is now 11, is not a fluent reader yet. She was in public<br/>
school thru 2nd grade, and was labeled dyslexic while she was there. The<br/>
reading assignments and homework were a huge stress on her. Even once we<br/>
took her out of school, until we started unschooling this past year, we<br/>
tried to help her read, although at a much more mellow level, but I wish we<br/>
hadn&#39;t, it was like we were constantly saying that there is something wrong<br/>
with her that we had to fix, which I hate that we did to her. Now, after<br/>
being let be this past year,  she will occasionally pick up a simple book<br/>
that we have read aloud many times, for enjoyment, occasionally asking me<br/>
what a word or a few words say. Most things, on the computer or tv, we just<br/>
read for her.  But, just yesterday, she went in for an annual eye exam, and<br/>
and doc was of course asking her about reading, Holly told her that it<br/>
stressed her out so she didn&#39;t do it much. The doc did find that she needed<br/>
reading glasses and also recommended Vision Therapy for her. Has anyone gone<br/>
thru that? The last thing I want to do is to get her more help to fix her<br/>
&quot;problem&quot;. But, as I was looking into it a bit on the computer yesterday, it<br/>
showed a picture of how some people with vision problems see words, it<br/>
showed one with the words and sentences chopped up into small pieces and she<br/>
said &quot;yea, that&#39;s kind of what I see&quot;. I am torn about this. I want to<br/>
continue giving her the space to come to reading at her own pace, and I<br/>
deeply do not want to make her again feel that there is something wrong with<br/>
her. But, would I also doing her a disservice by ignoring vision problems<br/>
that could be causing problems for her? When we briefly talked about it<br/>
after the doc, she did not want the therapy at all. I think she had visions<br/>
of more people trying to force her to learn what she didn&#39;t want to learn,<br/>
her self-confidence suffered so much earlier dealing with all this, I don&#39;t<br/>
want to screw up what she&#39;s been gaining with the unschooling and letting<br/>
her be.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My son and I both test &quot;gifted&quot; and struggled to read. It wasn&#39;t concrete<br/>
&gt; like numbers, we could touch 3 and 3 and get 6. We didn&#39;t seem to take well<br/>
&gt; to the stillness that went with reading. I think for very active children<br/>
&gt; hands on is easier and reading isn&#39;t the most hands on but it does come when<br/>
&gt; something piques their interest.<br/>

&gt; When Mo was younger she enjoyed stencils of all kinds - shapes and letters<br/>
&gt; and numbers. She also loved those big rubber mat squares and would separate<br/>
&gt; the letters from the background and use them to build words or use them as<br/>
&gt; giant stencils. That was fun for her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its good to look for resources that line up well with kids&#39; dispositions<br/>
&gt; and learning styles - but its also good not to hang expectations on those<br/>
&gt; tools &quot;leading&quot; to reading in some obvious, direct manner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do what you can to find this out on a purely medical level - if she receives no help, will her Vision get worse? Don&#39;t worry about reading. That&#39;s not going to be hurt by waiting, but it may be set back by more intervention. If the problem *is* degenerative, look into what the therapy actually is - it may be something yall can do at home, or that she can do, herself, more casually. Don&#39;t rush into anything! Give her time to consider the various options *and* more time to deschool. <br/>
