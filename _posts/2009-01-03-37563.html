<div id="ygrps-yiv-805404392">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I don a bit of armor when I post here, but I also know<br/>
change doesn&#39;t happen unless you take risks, so here I go.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
whether we&#39;ll ever be totally radical unschoolers, but I do like the changes<br/>
I&#39;m seeing in the short time since I made a commitment toward change.  Now,<br/>
I&#39;m about to take several risks in posting this here, so please keep in mind<br/>
that if I didn&#39;t recognize the need for change, and wasn&#39;t willing, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be posting, and that I&#39;m in a vulnerable place atm (fighting back<br/>
against some depression that&#39;s cropping up atm), when you reply to me.  I<br/>
hope that&#39;s not perceived as rude, but this list seems to appreciate<br/>
directness.<br/>
<br/>
I had a very stressful day yesterday; my sleep apnea is horrid from my<br/>
all-night bout with the stomach bug earlier in the week and exhaustion is<br/>
prolly the number one trigger for my less-than ideal parenting choices<br/>
(mostly barking at the kids for being kids), I also notice that I get most<br/>
frustrated when trying to complete a task that requires any level of<br/>
concentration (already a challenge when exhausted), and the volume level<br/>
gets really high.  I&#39;m working on that, but the first step was noticing what<br/>
the triggers are.  I absolutely love the posts that were put on here a<br/>
couple of days ago.<br/>
<br/>
At this point though, I&#39;m correcting myself after the fact and really<br/>
hopeful that I get to the point of catching myself before, which I&#39;ve<br/>
certainly done, but not near enough.  At any rate, I&#39;m sad to see my son<br/>
respond the way he does.  He&#39;s very quick to offer an apology for upsetting<br/>
me, when really he was just being a kid.  He&#39;ll preface things by saying &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t want to upset you, but&quot;, etc.  It has really gotten my attention as to<br/>
how it feels for him.  The other day, I noticed how bad the bottom of his<br/>
foot has gotten (they peel, and he picks at it, and now it is really red and<br/>
raw with a couple of deep fissures that make me nervous about infection).<br/>
Anyway, I asked to look at them more closely, and mentioned that it might be<br/>
time to go to the doctor to see if she has any ideas.  He totally flipped,<br/>
poor guy.  He was cowering in the corner of my bed, shaking.<br/>
<br/>
See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning having shots.<br/>
We actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a scary reaction<br/>
to the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since then has<br/>
been bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family.  Don&#39;t even<br/>
get me started about that decision--he turned up positive to three foods,<br/>
only to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive, that it<br/>
could be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for the testing,<br/>
when I never would have done it w/o his insistence.  I&#39;ve learned a lot<br/>
about standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told him that the only thing I could anticipate him getting shots<br/>
for would be if he got bitten by an animal somehow (course doesn&#39;t our dog<br/>
go and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next day, but it&#39;s<br/>
okay.  I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection.  It<br/>
was also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr. V. knows how<br/>
much he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor that).  I said<br/>
this in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to the doctor,<br/>
which though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is prudent (like<br/>
with his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked to see<br/>
his foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot; (we just<br/>
watched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s).  It actually was a<br/>
really nice opportunity to heal, I think.  I just assured him that I would<br/>
never intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s what he<br/>
thought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I love him for<br/>
who he is, etc.  I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about talking<br/>
about him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly and out of<br/>
concern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.  He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>
actually.  I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right now, etc. and<br/>
how senstive he is to criticism.  My parents have done a lot of comparing<br/>
him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love suggestions about continuing to help us heal that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to another challenge---dh!  First off, no one needs to tell me how<br/>
great he is.  I know it.  He&#39;s a phenomenal man, and I love and adore him<br/>
immensely.  He loves his kids dearly, although he admits that 3 is stressful<br/>
to him (me too at times).  He comes from a very traditional parenting<br/>
background, as do most of us, and really is of the belief that kids need to<br/>
respect and listen to their parents just b/c.  I have to admit to fighting<br/>
that mindset for myself at times.  At any rate, I&#39;ve been broaching small<br/>
things with him, w/o saying I heard about it here, b/c he dismisses it then,<br/>
like the wish list board idea, and was going to bring up allowance when he<br/>
hopefully gets a small raise in March (no guarantee with the economy, of<br/>
course).  Well, he brings up allowance himself the other day and I was<br/>
encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he mentions having it tied to chores (kinda laid back, but, still).<br/>
Unfortunately, I kind of jumped on him, in that I was so taken aback, that I<br/>
said &quot;No&quot;, rather firmly.  Which I apologized for later, and explained (I<br/>
was trying to nurse my youngest to sleep, so that was another reason that I<br/>
was more abrupt).  I explained to him that having chores tied to allowance<br/>
was just setting us all up to fail.  I don&#39;t think he buys it.  Honestly,<br/>
we&#39;re both overwhelmed with how often they all drop things on the ground and<br/>
just leave them there.  I don&#39;t have high standards, by any means, but I&#39;m<br/>
very clumsy, and have often hurt myself b/c of things left on the floor.  I<br/>
really worry when I am carrying the 2 yr old, and can&#39;t see obstacles as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, how do I go about making the positive changes I&#39;m trying to<br/>
make, while feeling like I&#39;m causing tension in my relationship?  More<br/>
importantly, how can I respect my husband&#39;s concerns and still make changes<br/>
that I truly believe are necessary for my children&#39;s well-being?  He has<br/>
never been a fan of my decision to homeschool, not to mention unschool, and<br/>
this and deciding to have a 3rd child have really been the only times we&#39;ve<br/>
disagreed (in any major way) in 17 yrs of knowing each other.  I think he&#39;s<br/>
more comfortable with homeschooling, as he&#39;s been able to admit that Josh<br/>
really is motivated to learn on his own (which he highly doubted in the<br/>
past), but he still thinks Josh would benefit from ideas from someone other<br/>
than me, from teachers&#39; years of experience, and that it is more work than<br/>
it is worth (i.e. school doesn&#39;t damage kids).  So, it&#39;s challenging for<br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ve rambled on more than I intended.  I know I brought up several<br/>
issues, and maybe it would have been better to do it in separate posts,<br/>
but....I&#39;m nervous, but also looking forward to your responses.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

you mention that likelihood to him, research the possibilities for  <br/>
healing his foot without going to the doctor. There are naturopaths  <br/>
and homeopaths who don&#39;t use needles and have success with such  <br/>
ongoing issues. But, you could inform yourself first.<br/>

&gt; go and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next day,  <br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; okay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I would even bring this up to my daughter, who has a lot  <br/>
of fear around doctors, dentists and needles. It would set up another  <br/>
fear in her mind about being bitten by a dog and what would happen  <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection.  It<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, it might be better not to try to help him feel more relaxed. Go  <br/>
when you really need to go and help him *right then* with his fears.  <br/>
Don&#39;t talk about what may or may not happen, because that can be  <br/>
stressful. I used to do just this kind of thing with my very  <br/>
sensitive, reactive, and imaginative daughter and it would just set  <br/>
her up for too much worrying about the future. I thought I was helping  <br/>
by &quot;preparing&quot; her. It didn&#39;t help much at all, especially if I went  <br/>
into detail or talked about it more than once.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked  <br/>

disrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor *her*  <br/>
need for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she sees  <br/>
herself, too.<br/>
<br/>
I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in front  <br/>
of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of concern)  <br/>
I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>

&gt; comparing<br/>
&gt; him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it was important to protect my daughter from those  <br/>
comparisons by not over-emphasizing her differences, nor entertaining  <br/>
much discussion with grandparents about it. All kids have their own  <br/>
timelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others.  <br/>
Explaining too much can sound like defensiveness. Being a child&#39;s  <br/>
advocate sometimes means diverting attention.<br/>
<br/>
I notice there are many situations and explanations throughout your  <br/>
post. Then you ask how you can heal the relationship without really  <br/>
telling us what you think your relationship is with your son. If you  <br/>
can think about that, then tell us what you believe is missing or  <br/>
needs repair, that will help clarify, both for you and the list members.<br/>
<br/>
There may be some value to journalling about these things. Getting  <br/>
your thoughts down on paper, the stream-of-consciousness stuff, can  <br/>
help to shed some light on what seems daunting at first.<br/>

Just a note here. My sister used to have that and she found out that every time she had shoes that were synthetic her feet would get worse.<br/>
she can only wear natural fibers and leather. No plastic or rubber.<br/>
She also added omega oils to her  diet and it helped heal a lot faster.<br/>

and homeopaths who don&#39;t use needles and have success with such <br/>
ongoing issues. But, you could inform yourself first.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning having <br/>
&gt; shots.<br/>
&gt; We actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a scary <br/>
&gt; reaction<br/>
&gt; to the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since then <br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; been bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family. <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; get me started about that decision--he turned up positive to three <br/>
&gt; foods,<br/>
&gt; only to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive, <br/>
&gt; that it<br/>
&gt; could be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for the <br/>
&gt; testing,<br/>
&gt; when I never would have done it w/o his insistence. I&#39;ve learned a <br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt; about standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I told him that the only thing I could anticipate him <br/>
&gt; getting shots<br/>
&gt; for would be if he got bitten by an animal somehow (course doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; our dog<br/>
&gt; go and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next day, <br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; okay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I would even bring this up to my daughter, who has a lot <br/>
of fear around doctors, dentists and needles. It would set up another <br/>
fear in her mind about being bitten by a dog and what would happen <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection. It<br/>
&gt; was also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr. V. <br/>
&gt; knows how<br/>
&gt; much he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor <br/>
&gt; that). I said<br/>
&gt; this in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to the <br/>
&gt; doctor,<br/>
&gt; which though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is <br/>
&gt; prudent (like<br/>
&gt; with his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, it might be better not to try to help him feel more relaxed. Go <br/>
when you really need to go and help him *right then* with his fears. <br/>
Don&#39;t talk about what may or may not happen, because that can be <br/>
stressful. I used to do just this kind of thing with my very <br/>
sensitive, reactive, and imaginative daughter and it would just set <br/>
her up for too much worrying about the future. I thought I was helping <br/>
by &quot;preparing&quot; her. It didn&#39;t help much at all, especially if I went <br/>
into detail or talked about it more than once.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked <br/>
&gt; to see<br/>
&gt; his foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot; (we <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; watched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s). It actually <br/>
&gt; was a<br/>
&gt; really nice opportunity to heal, I think. I just assured him that I <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; never intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s what he<br/>
&gt; thought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I love <br/>
&gt; him for<br/>
&gt; who he is, etc. I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about <br/>
&gt; talking<br/>
&gt; about him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly and <br/>
&gt; out of<br/>
&gt; concern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dd doesn&#39;t like to be talked about either. It can be construed as <br/>
disrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor *her* <br/>
need for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she sees <br/>
herself, too.<br/>
<br/>
I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in front <br/>
of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of concern) <br/>
I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>
&gt; actually. I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right now, <br/>
&gt; etc. and<br/>
&gt; how senstive he is to criticism. My parents have done a lot of <br/>
&gt; comparing<br/>
&gt; him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it was important to protect my daughter from those <br/>
comparisons by not over-emphasizing her differences, nor entertaining <br/>
much discussion with grandparents about it. All kids have their own <br/>
timelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others. <br/>
Explaining too much can sound like defensiveness. Being a child&#39;s <br/>
advocate sometimes means diverting attention.<br/>
<br/>
I notice there are many situations and explanations throughout your <br/>
post. Then you ask how you can heal the relationship without really <br/>
telling us what you think your relationship is with your son. If you <br/>
can think about that, then tell us what you believe is missing or <br/>
needs repair, that will help clarify, both for you and the list members.<br/>
<br/>
There may be some value to journalling about these things. Getting <br/>
your thoughts down on paper, the stream-of-conscious ness stuff, can <br/>
help to shed some light on what seems daunting at first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160786590">You did not mention if it was stress related or something topical, <br/>
have you tried the miracle salve? I have found it to be useful for a <br/>

<br/>
I also find that topical application of coconut oil helps heal most <br/>
skin issues. <br/>
<br/>
Can you also offer him a pedicure? or teach him to do it himself and <br/>
apply a foot cream (I love bodyshop products for feet) before he <br/>
wears socks and/or at nights with socks? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry you are having a tough time. <br/>

and caring then she.  That and the fact that she totally respects our<br/>
decisions about our health, and she&#39;s a rare gem (how sad is that?).  I will<br/>
look into this though.  And forgive the rant, but much as I love my<br/>
naturopath, she charges about $100/hr. which is really rough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning having<br/>
&gt; &gt; shots.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a scary<br/>
&gt; &gt; reaction<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since then<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; get me started about that decision--he turned up positive to three<br/>
&gt; &gt; foods,<br/>
&gt; &gt; only to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; could be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; testing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I never would have done it w/o his insistence. I&#39;ve learned a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; about standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>

&gt; &gt; okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure I would even bring this up to my daughter, who has a lot<br/>
&gt; of fear around doctors, dentists and needles. It would set up another<br/>
&gt; fear in her mind about being bitten by a dog and what would happen<br/>
&gt; after that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, I&#39;ve struggled with this a lot.  His fears seem to snowball, and<br/>
any time I&#39;ve given information like this, it&#39;s been in an attempt to stop<br/>
the snowballing.  See, I understand anxiety all too well.  One thing I do<br/>
need to examine is my commitment to being totally honest with my kids, which<br/>
is definitely part of the motivation in giving him an example; I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
ever want him to feel that I lied to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; was also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr. V.<br/>
&gt; &gt; knows how<br/>
&gt; &gt; much he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor<br/>
&gt; &gt; that). I said<br/>
&gt; &gt; this in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; doctor,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; prudent (like<br/>
&gt; &gt; with his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, it might be better not to try to help him feel more relaxed. Go<br/>
&gt; when you really need to go and help him *right then* with his fears.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t talk about what may or may not happen, because that can be<br/>
&gt; stressful. I used to do just this kind of thing with my very<br/>
&gt; sensitive, reactive, and imaginative daughter and it would just set<br/>
&gt; her up for too much worrying about the future. I thought I was helping<br/>
&gt; by &quot;preparing&quot; her. It didn&#39;t help much at all, especially if I went<br/>
&gt; into detail or talked about it more than once.<br/>

it when he brings it up and it&#39;s so hard to know if springing it on him<br/>
would damage trust.  How did you determine that?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; his foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot; (we<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; watched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s). It actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; really nice opportunity to heal, I think. I just assured him that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; never intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s what he<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I love<br/>
&gt; &gt; him for<br/>
&gt; &gt; who he is, etc. I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about<br/>
&gt; &gt; talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; about him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly and<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; concern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dd doesn&#39;t like to be talked about either. It can be construed as<br/>
&gt; disrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor *her*<br/>
&gt; need for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she sees<br/>
&gt; herself, too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I&#39;ve gotten the hint.  I wonder what you all think about<br/>
this--it would be my preference for many reasons to limit our time with my<br/>
family.  They are much more authoritarian in their views and, in their<br/>
effort to &quot;fix&quot; him, they often make suggestions that he feels are<br/>
criticism.  Still, he wants to go over there frequently.  I talk with him<br/>
about how he feels about those things, and he usually just shrugs and says<br/>
he still wants to go over.  So, I follow his lead.  What makes me nervous,<br/>
and something that I don&#39;t think many here would agree with, is I don&#39;t feel<br/>
like children can always weigh multi-factorial decisons like that.<br/>
Certainly he knows that he enjoys going over there, and right now, the<br/>
benefits outweigh the costs, but I admit I&#39;m concerned about damage they may<br/>
cause.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in front<br/>
&gt; of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of concern)<br/>
&gt; I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually. I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right now,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc. and<br/>
&gt; &gt; how senstive he is to criticism. My parents have done a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; comparing<br/>
&gt; &gt; him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found it was important to protect my daughter from those<br/>
&gt; comparisons by not over-emphasizing her differences, nor entertaining<br/>
&gt; much discussion with grandparents about it. All kids have their own<br/>
&gt; timelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others.<br/>
&gt; Explaining too much can sound like defensiveness. Being a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; advocate sometimes means diverting attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do, either by avoiding being there as often<br/>
(again, for many reasons), or by letting them know that I&#39;d appreciate them<br/>
keeping their comments to themselves (not said quite like that, as that<br/>
might trigger their &quot;You don&#39;t respect your parents&quot; point).  Unfortunately,<br/>
this can often end with them concluding that he&#39;s just &quot;too sensitive&quot; like<br/>
me.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I notice there are many situations and explanations throughout your<br/>
&gt; post. Then you ask how you can heal the relationship without really<br/>
&gt; telling us what you think your relationship is with your son. If you<br/>
&gt; can think about that, then tell us what you believe is missing or<br/>
&gt; needs repair, that will help clarify, both for you and the list members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I think is missing is him knowing, totally and completely, how much we<br/>
love him.  I can tell that he doubts it, even as it blows my mind that he<br/>
could ever doubt it.  But his feelings are real, as much as mine are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There may be some value to journalling about these things. Getting<br/>
&gt; your thoughts down on paper, the stream-of-consciousness stuff, can<br/>
&gt; help to shed some light on what seems daunting at first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

would have it, so this is very timely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

salve that was originally intended for my bout with Thrust (awful stuff,<br/>
truly), I wonder if that would work.  I think it&#39;s called &quot;Kelly&#39;s miracle<br/>

&gt; &gt; she can only wear natural fibers and leather. No plastic or rubber.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a very stressful day yesterday;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whenever I start justifying my less-than-ideal parenting, it<br/>
&gt; really is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a clue to me that I need to look at things differently.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point though, I&#39;m correcting myself after the fact and<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hopeful that I get to the point of catching myself before, which<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly done, but not near enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Being aware is the first step towards changing how you react, of<br/>
&gt; &gt; course. So, when you notice a trigger, have a plan. Breathe.<br/>
&gt; Breathe<br/>
&gt; &gt; some more. Remove yourself from the situation for a minute to stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever cycle you are beginning to enter. Exhaustion is common<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have small children and you have three. It will not be like<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; forever! But giving your kids the gift of a frustrated-less- often<br/>
&gt; &gt; mother will help your relationships.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; At any rate, I&#39;m sad to see my son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; respond the way he does. He&#39;s very quick to offer an apology for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; upsetting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me, when really he was just being a kid. He&#39;ll preface things by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying &quot;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to upset you, but&quot;, etc. It has really gotten my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attention as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how it feels for him. The other day, I noticed how bad the<br/>
&gt; bottom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foot has gotten (they peel, and he picks at it, and now it is<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; red and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; raw with a couple of deep fissures that make me nervous about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; infection).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I asked to look at them more closely, and mentioned that<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time to go to the doctor to see if she has any ideas. He totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; flipped,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; poor guy. He was cowering in the corner of my bed, shaking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, you know that he has fear around doctor&#39;s visits. Maybe,<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; you mention that likelihood to him, research the possibilities for<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing his foot without going to the doctor. There are<br/>
&gt; naturopaths<br/>
&gt; &gt; and homeopaths who don&#39;t use needles and have success with such<br/>
&gt; &gt; ongoing issues. But, you could inform yourself first.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shots.<br/>

&gt; &gt; disrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor<br/>
&gt; *her*<br/>
&gt; &gt; need for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she<br/>
&gt; sees<br/>
&gt; &gt; herself, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in<br/>
&gt; front<br/>
&gt; &gt; of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of<br/>
&gt; concern)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually. I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right<br/>
&gt; now,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how senstive he is to criticism. My parents have done a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found it was important to protect my daughter from those<br/>
&gt; &gt; comparisons by not over-emphasizing her differences, nor<br/>
&gt; entertaining<br/>
&gt; &gt; much discussion with grandparents about it. All kids have their<br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; &gt; timelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Explaining too much can sound like defensiveness. Being a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; advocate sometimes means diverting attention.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I notice there are many situations and explanations throughout<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; post. Then you ask how you can heal the relationship without<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; telling us what you think your relationship is with your son. If<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can think about that, then tell us what you believe is missing or<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs repair, that will help clarify, both for you and the list<br/>
&gt; members.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There may be some value to journalling about these things. Getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; your thoughts down on paper, the stream-of-conscious ness stuff,<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; help to shed some light on what seems daunting at first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23843245">That was really good, Robin, thanks.  I&#39;m still perplexed about how to<br/>
reconcile moving in different directions (him wanting to give allowance for<br/>
doing chores, me wanting to be more respectful and have a collaborative<br/>
relationship with my kids).<br/>
<br/>
I also just want to mention beautiful moments, b/c I don&#39;t think I notice<br/>
them near enough.  I was having a &quot;bad&quot; day on Saturday (pain, fatigue,<br/>
stress about having lost something, and yet ever aware that these were small<br/>
problems, yet I thought I *had* to find it for the doctor&#39;s appt on Monday),<br/>
and my youngest, who is 2, walks over to me and goes &quot;here Mama&quot; and gives<br/>
me a gummy lifesaver.  In his world, that could fix it all, and you know<br/>
what, for that moment, it did for me too.  I&#39;m trying really hard to live in<br/>
the moment, *this* moment, and darn if kids don&#39;t already know that, eh?  A<br/>
few minutes later, my 7 yr old comes up and just moves in next to me and<br/>
nuzzles up.  Beautiful moments and a reminder of all we have.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I felt compelled to share, but it is what it is ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

you can ask for help. But kids are not here to do our jobs. We adults  <br/>
don&#39;t get paid for housework, yet we do it because we want a certain  <br/>

If it&#39;s a matter of not being able to afford what he wants right now,  <br/>
you could help him find a way to save for it. Or you could save for  <br/>
it. If you are just determining what is a want vs. a need makes his  <br/>
desires unimportant, or worse, worthless. Calling what makes his life  <br/>
happy as &quot;debts&quot; makes me cringe. As Schuyler said, not a relationship- <br/>
building situation.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is helping our kids get what they want and need.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t talk to them about the wisdom of purchases or  <br/>
alternatives, but they should be able to choose the $75 jeans,  <br/>

for him what is a want, not a need, doesn&#39;t help him learn to make  <br/>
good choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946558240">I feel that since our kids do have to live in the real world, and one of the reasons I unschool/homeschool is to make sure that he gets that real world exposure, the way I&#39;m doing things is appropriate for our family.  I would LOVE to choose not to work, but I would also have to choose not to eat, or wear clothes, or have a warm, dry place to sleep.  It&#39;s not really a question of holding a job, it&#39;s the really about the process of obtaining funds in return for labor/services.  Even your friends who choose not to work for someone else have to do something to get money to live on, unless perhaps they live with you?<br/>
<br/>
Micah has the same choices at home that he would if he were out on his own - make decisions on purchases/finances based on real world needs.  If he needs something, we talk and decide how it will be acquired.  I don&#39;t think that kids (or adults) should rule the house - I think it&#39;s a joint venture.<br/>
<br/>
As to my choosing to bring him into the world, that&#39;s true.  But I don&#39;t choose to support him for his entire life, although you may feel that&#39;s acceptable for your family.  I have five children who are grown and out in the world.  They&#39;re independent and happy.  That&#39;s my hope for Micah at the appropriate time for him, and for us.<br/>

&gt; allowance for that day. We also pay on my paydays, with a note <br/>
&gt; saying what he gets and why he may or may not have gotten a certain <br/>
&gt; amount.<br/>
<br/>
The responsibility for keeping the house belongs to the adults. Yes, <br/>
you can ask for help. But kids are not here to do our jobs. We adults <br/>
don&#39;t get paid for housework, yet we do it because we want a certain <br/>
level of cleanliness or tidiness. To expect children to have the same <br/>
perspective as we do about how a home should look doesn&#39;t make sense. <br/>
Modelling how you would like things to be has more impact in the long <br/>
run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I struggled with this a lot. I wanted him to learn the value of <br/>
&gt; work and money, and I wanted him to be responsible for his own debts <br/>
&gt; (WoW, XBox Live, etc.). I don&#39;t make him pay for clothing or food, <br/>
&gt; since we (DH and I) pool our money to cover all those expenses. <br/>
&gt; Unless, of course, he wants something he doesn&#39;t really need - like <br/>
&gt; expensive sneakers or $75 jeans. We base what he needs on whether <br/>
&gt; he has something that is a reasonable substitute. If he has three <br/>
&gt; pairs of sneakers, he doesn&#39;t need new ones, for example.<br/>
<br/>
So, these are learning goals *you* have for him.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a matter of not being able to afford what he wants right now, <br/>
you could help him find a way to save for it. Or you could save for <br/>
it. If you are just determining what is a want vs. a need makes his <br/>
desires unimportant, or worse, worthless. Calling what makes his life <br/>
happy as &quot;debts&quot; makes me cringe. As Schuyler said, not a relationship- <br/>
building situation.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is helping our kids get what they want and need. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t talk to them about the wisdom of purchases or <br/>
alternatives, but they should be able to choose the $75 jeans, <br/>
especially if they have had a chance to consider the choices. Deciding <br/>
for him what is a want, not a need, doesn&#39;t help him learn to make <br/>
good choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t consider the allowance thing to be coercive, any more than I <br/>
&gt; feel coerced at the grocery store to pay for my purchases or by my <br/>
&gt; boss for having to come in to work to get the paycheck. I think <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s just a part of life.<br/>
<br/>
Part of *your* life. It will be part of his life, eventually. Right <br/>
now, you are responsible, as the parent, for providing for him, not <br/>
making him work for what he wants. I don&#39;t know how that would <br/>
*teach* responsibility without resentment.<br/>

  I think the difference between not feeling coerced by your boss versus feeling that paying your children a job based salary is innappropriate is that your relationship with your boss is clearly defined from the off as a work for pay deal. With your children the money for chores thing is something that you are adding to the mix in some sort of strange desire to set yourself up as their boss. You are creating an unnatural environment within your home. And damaging your relationship as their parent in the process. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706202658">Hi, Meridith!  I don&#39;t know if what we do is totally in line with the <br/>
RU philosophy, but I&#39;ll share it anyway!  We give our kids an <br/>
allowance every week.  They get their allowance because they are part <br/>
of our family.  We don&#39;t require them to do chores or behave in a <br/>
certain manner to &quot;earn&quot; their allowance.  <br/>
<br/>
My 14 year olds get $14 a week, my 12 year old gets $12 a week, and <br/>
on and on!  I buy the children things like food and clothing, I pay <br/>
for any sport or other extra-curricular activities, and I also buy <br/>
them other things here and there when I can.  Basically, by us giving <br/>
the kids an allowance, they have access to their portion of the <br/>
family income.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not buy every toy or item they ask for at the store.  I simply <br/>
suggest we look to see how much money they have.  If they have enough <br/>
money and they want the thing they&#39;re asking for enough...they buy <br/>
it.  If they don&#39;t have enough money I help them figure out how long <br/>
it will be until they&#39;ll have enough money to buy it.  <br/>
<br/>
That is what we&#39;re doing.  I don&#39;t think there is only one way to do <br/>
this.  Every family and every situation is different.  What works for <br/>
one family may or may not work for others.  I think many of us are <br/>
living on one income and there is a budget we need to adhere to.  I <br/>
like the idea of my kids having the ability to spend their money when <br/>
they want and how they want.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327025701">I didn&#39;t say &quot;never say no.&quot; I also didn&#39;t say &quot;buy them whatever they  <br/>
want, whenever they want it.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you walk through Walmart and a child wants 7 or 8 different toys at  <br/>
once EVERY TIME (does this happen in your house?), what do you do?  <br/>
Perhaps, I would say &quot;I have enough to buy x. How about we choose one  <br/>
now and we&#39;ll put the others on your wish list. We can get them as  <br/>
soon as we can.&quot; This honors a kid&#39;s desire for the item, and  <br/>
expresses the parent&#39;s desire to help them get it. You could even pick  <br/>
7 or 8 $1.00 items, if it&#39;s sheer volume she&#39;s looking for &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If it happens every time and the visual stimulation of all those toys  <br/>
is too much, can you go shopping without your daughter? You could even  <br/>
pick up one of the desired items and bring it home, as a surprise one  <br/>
day. How much fun would that be for her?<br/>
<br/>
Has your daughter played pinball, played in ball pits, played air  <br/>
hockey? Does she want to? You could find ways for her to experience  <br/>
those things without having to buy them for your home.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s important to really think about whether &quot;it&#39;s too much&quot;  <br/>
if you can afford it. Is it too much money? Is it too much stuff? Is  <br/>
it too much for you? Motivation is good to explore.<br/>
<br/>
And, as I said &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t talk to them about the wisdom  <br/>
of purchases or alternatives.&quot; Maybe not when a child is melting down  <br/>
at the store, if that happens, but some other opportunity. Help them  <br/>
make choices and decisions. It will help the next time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, now 13, is great to shop with now. She gets an allowance,  <br/>
not tied to chores. We determined about how much we would normally  <br/>
spend per month on things other than food and clothes and gave it to  <br/>
her each pay day. When our income was reduced, we talked to her about  <br/>
reducing her allowance. She was really cool with that. Sometimes, she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t spend any of it. Sometimes, all of it. Sometimes, she asks for  <br/>
an advance and if we can do it, we do.<br/>
<br/>
Before we approached it this way, and she had a small allowance ($1  <br/>
per age per week) when she was younger, it was difficult because  <br/>
things she wanted were more expensive than, say, $7. She was not a  <br/>
saver and  nothing we did helped her do that. I would spend money on  <br/>
things she wanted, try to make her feel guilty for it, while I felt  <br/>
resentful that she couldn&#39;t stick to a budget. Who was I kidding? I  <br/>
have trouble with that!  So, we came up with the solution of giving  <br/>
her generally what we&#39;d spend anyway. It&#39;s so easy now.<br/>
<br/>
With a decent amount of money that is her own, she makes her own  <br/>
decisions, some good, some bad. But, she doesn&#39;t have me making her  <br/>
decisions for her. I can give her my opinion. Sometimes, she takes my  <br/>
advice, sometimes she doesn&#39;t. It makes for a more peaceful  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a compelling reason to say no (ie. for safety reasons,  <br/>
having to sell your house to accommodate the item &lt;g&gt;), children can  <br/>
more easily understand that &quot;no&quot; than when a &quot;no&quot; comes seemingly  <br/>
arbitrarily (at least from the child&#39;s perspective).<br/>

&gt; How do you tell a child no then?  Will it not create a sense of  <br/>
&gt; entitlement in child if when you walk through walmart they want 7 or  <br/>
&gt; 8 different toys at once EVERY TIME, and you buy them.  Why should I  <br/>
&gt; buy them for them on a whim?  I don&#39;t see how that is a MUST for  <br/>
&gt; radical unschooling.  If there is something she consistently wants  <br/>
&gt; then yes I try to provide those things for her.  Meaning if she has  <br/>
&gt; to have a certain game and asks for it on more than a few occasions,  <br/>
&gt; not on a whim or because of a cool commercial,  then I say ok let&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; check that out next time we are at the store,  But if I bought  <br/>
&gt; everything my daughter asked for we wuld have no room in the house.   <br/>
&gt; Literally, from ball pits, to pinball machines, air hockey tables  <br/>
&gt; etc.     So when do you say no Robin, if you are able to afford it  <br/>
&gt; but think it is too much?<br/>

everyone do chores and he&#39;s willing to do them ,that he is) that&#39;s  <br/>
great. But, the fact that he only gets allowance if he does chores  <br/>
just doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me. He obviously would like some  <br/>
money. Why not give him some, aside from household duties?<br/>

It requires a shift in perspective to see how this can work.<br/>

in allowance, but it is considered to be a &quot;small allowance&quot; by <br/>
some.  It really all depends on a family&#39;s income and how many family <br/>
members there are :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559691531">Simon and Linnaea each get an allowance of 7 pounds a week. It used to be 8 but they wanted to each sponser an endangered animal for the other, so Linnaea sponsers Simon&#39;s tiger and Simon sponsers Linnaea&#39;s orangutan. I also buy things that I can afford that I think they will enjoy. I pay for two WoW accounts, I pay for headphones for Simon so that he can listen to the computer in the same room as the television, they seem to break fairly regularly, and I replace them, I buy their clothes and pay for outings. Their money is completely discretionary. They get to choose what they do with it. <br/>
<br/>
I decided that I didn&#39;t like holding all the cards when it came to money and purchases. I decided that I wanted them to have power over what they bought and what they saved for and what they didn&#39;t really want. And I still like getting things for them, so when I feel flush enough, I get things that I choose or that I know they&#39;d like. <br/>
<br/>
The money isn&#39;t free. They totally understand that their dad works for money. They also understand that money is how we pay for things. To heat the house, to pay the rent, to have a tuna sandwich, it all takes money. They don&#39;t live in a vacuum without any awareness of how things work. The other day we went into to town to get video games with their Christmas money. Simon knew precisely what he wanted, having watched youtube Let&#39;s Plays of different games to see what he would like and having looked at reviews at Gamespot.com. Linnaea had really enjoyed Fable 2, so she and I went looking for games that were similar, doing a lot of research for the kind of evil to good continuum that Fable has as well as looking for a game with a dog for a pet. Turns out Fallout 3 has both those things. Anyhow, so we were in town at the game store looking through all the games and I noticed that they had a Sims 2 expansion pack that she didn&#39;t have and pointed it out. She<br/>
 picked it up and looked at it and then said &quot;You know, I want it, but I don&#39;t want it right now. Not more than I want the other game,&quot; and she put it back. These are not people who spend money as if it were free. <br/>

I think if he asks for ways to earn money that is fine.  Then provide it if you can.  I don&#39;t think we have to hand out free money to show our love.  BUt forcing him to do chores does not seem appropriate for the environment.  I do all the house work here and sometimes I have asked her to help clean her toys but if she does not then I do it without yelling.  I hope at some point she will find joy in helping others like i do.  But she has asked me, &quot;how can I earn some money.&#39;  I said would you like to do some things I do around the house and she said yes.  So I told her some options she did some and I paid her.  Her choice, just like my choice to work.  Do you all who oppose allowances hand out money to your kids for everything fun they want, or do you only buy needs and occasional wants?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175993128">Naruto is 6 and Gigi will be 3 in the end of the month. Today we had panned to go to Walmart get some more moon sand <br/>
so we could build a castle.<br/>
I had $20 in my wallet, and the moon sand is $6. We are really really tight in money right now and have talked to the kids about it.<br/>
Just outside the parking lot there was a homeless man holding a sign and the kids asked what was written on it.<br/>
I told them that the man did not have money and that he was homeless. Gigi was the first one to say :&quot; Can we build him a home?&quot;<br/>
We decided to buy the gentleman some food and give it too him since Gigi said we should give him Naruto&#39;s hamburger.<br/>
So we go in and right at the door there is Disney Princesses&#39; Pez set. My kids have been into Pez lately and Cinderella is too much for my little girl to resist.  I ask the kids:<br/>
IF I buy the Pez than I cannot by the man some food. Both my kids wanted to buy the man food and were OK not buying their Pez.<br/>
We came out and the man was gone when we drove by. They were not disappointed. They were worried about were the man went and if he was going to be cold at night because:&quot; Everyone needs a home&quot; The never said ;&quot; Well we should have bought the Pez&quot;<br/>
They know I will buy them the Pez when I can. <br/>
By the way the Pez set was $14.76 with one of each Princess ( Like 8 or 9)If it was less I had the money I would have gotten it for them.<br/>
Kids that get &quot;everything &quot; they want do not became little brats who feel entlited.<br/>
My kids are awesome about getting things or NOT getting things because they know we are on their side.<br/>
In 2006 my son Naruto asked for a Nintendo DS for ME his mom for his Christmas present. He was 4 and a half years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354996663">This reminds me of a comment my mom made a couple of weeks ago.  She said something to the effect of even though she could pretty much buy my niece (6) anything she wanted, she didn&#39;t want my niece to know that.  She believes it is important for my niece to &quot;know the value of hard work&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is so different from how I want my kids to feel.  I want Megan and Zoe to feel as if I can help them to achieve what they want.  I want my kids to know that I&#39;m on their side and not standing by waiting to teach them a lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, I was looking at a website project called &quot;101 Things in 1,001 Days&quot;.  I thought it was a cool idea.  I was getting ready to start my list when Megan asked what I was doing.  She liked the idea too and came up with 101 things in about an hour.  Twelve items on her list were &quot;things she wanted to buy&quot;.  The rest of the list is filled with places she wants to go and things she wants to do.  Some of them are going to be easy (put on a puppet show, see a ballet) and some are going to be a fun challenge to fulfill (work in a bakery, go fossil hunting, work in kiosk in the mall), and some might not happen at all (fifteen items involve international travel) - but I am so excited to help her list come alive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059722384">John Bock, an anthropologist who is at Cal State University at Fullerton, did some work on children&#39;s utility at the chores they might do. It was his Ph.D. dissertation work. I can remember sitting in his house watching slides of children of the Okavango Delta Peoples of Botswana trying to crush mongongo nuts to compare how many they could crush in an hour versus an untrained adult. He looked at how much food they could gather compared with how much caloric output their somewhat clumsy fishing and other kinds of gathering produced. He found that they were more of a burden than an assistance. Certainly at younger ages children&#39;s work was much more about keeping them busy than it was about accruing resources to extend a family&#39;s ability to survive.<br/>
Which is like the little bit I can remember from Dr. Spock&#39;s Baby and<br/>
Childcare book when he wrote about taking your toddler for a walk and how you should expect a block to take an hour given all the potential distractions along the path. <br/>
<br/>
Ooh, here&#39;s a relevant quote from a paper (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockJohnson.pdf)">http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockJohnson.pdf)</a> looking at subsistance ecology and play: <br/>
<br/>
This leads us to expect that a household’s participation in<br/>
agriculture will decrease the amount of time spent in play, since there is<br/>
substantial evidence in this (Bock 2002b) and other traditional communities<br/>
(Blurton Jones et al. 1989; Bulatao and Arnold 1977; Cain 1977; Caldwell<br/>
1982; Lee and Kramer 2002; see Kaplan and Bock 2001b for a review)<br/>
that children are more able to contribute to the household economy in<br/>
farming subsistence ecologies than in foraging or herding.<br/>
<br/>
It suggests that it is only recently that we&#39;ve been handing out chores to ensure subsistance. It might challenge a rawist approach to chores given that chores may have only been around as long as cooking (so 250,000 years), actually, not even that long. <br/>
<br/>
All of this reminds of Rob Walker&#39;s work on hunting proficiency among<br/>
boys and men of the Ache of Paraguay. He found that Ache hunters were<br/>
at their hunting peak at between 37 and 42 years of age<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/ipse/staff/walker/pdfs/achehunt.pdf)">http://www.eva.mpg.de/ipse/staff/walker/pdfs/achehunt.pdf)</a>. Children don&#39;t help a lot when hunting with their uncles. <br/>
<br/>
John Bock wrote a paper (Evolutionary Demography and Intrahousehold Time Allocation:School Attendance and Child Labor Among the Okavango Delta Peoples of Botswana) that had this in it&#39;s summary:<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps most significant for policy implications<br/>
is that whether or not a specific<br/>
child would benefit from attending school<br/>
was not a significant predictor of school attendance.<br/>
Rather, the degree to which parents&#39;<br/>
own reproductive interests were<br/>
served was the primary predictor of which<br/>
children attended school. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockAJHB.pdf)">http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockAJHB.pdf)</a><br/>
<br/>
To rephrase, parents were manipulating their children&#39;s labor and education to suit the parents&#39; needs. I consider myself really lucky to not have to do that. I get to choose to give Simon and Linnaea the freedom of my reproductive interests so that they can choose the things that will most benefit themselves. I don&#39;t need to pull them away from those things that will give them their best outcome in order to have my needs met. <br/>

true and natural it has been since the beginning of time where anthropology can show us how humans shared &quot;chores&quot; to make sure life continued.  I am a rawist because I think at our most natural of states that is how we ate.  I also think at appropriate times children will come to the point that they desire/need to be a part of subsistence.  If you feel your son is ready than I agree with your decision.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s the way the world works.<br/>
<br/>
My Dh is the at home parent, he brings in no income. He does the<br/>
housework - does that mean that I&#39;m paying him for the work he does/he&#39;s<br/>
&quot;earning&quot; the cash he chooses to spend now and again for items he might<br/>
want? Should it be withheld if he doesn&#39;t get the dishes done one day or<br/>
I take out the trash instead of him? If the money DH spends for things<br/>
he might want (the occasional gadget or gizmo whatever) is not payment<br/>
for services rendered, why would I tie DS&#39; spending money to services<br/>
rendered simply because he&#39;s under 18? DS clearly understands where the<br/>
money comes from - he&#39;s even visited me at work and knows what I do. He<br/>
knows that in order to have any of the money we have, I get up early in<br/>
the morning and go to work and come home around dinnertime. He knows<br/>
that I can&#39;t just stay home whenever I want - there is an allotted<br/>
number of sick days and vacation days I have available and after that, I<br/>
can have money held back from my pay.<br/>
