what are some ideas for jobs at home??  I am a single mom living on very little to be able to stay home with both my girls (4and 10). I don&#39;t have family here and most people I know aren&#39;t available to babysit as they work and have their families too or they just don&#39;t understand our lifestyle. I would like to be able to do more but finances are very tight and am now trying to see if there are any other ideas that I haven&#39;t thought of.  I used to do childcare but found that took away from my kids as most people in the is area aren&#39;t supportive of this lifestyle.  I have also cleaned homes for others.  So any other thoughts would be grand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740542878">I too would love some ideas!  I have the opportunity to start part time at Westjet the end of January, but I would so prefer something more flexible that wouldn&#39;t take me away from my girls.  And now that Ryan and I are living in different houses, it&#39;s much more tricky to work out.  I need to bring in additional income, but want to be with my girls!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032153379">I work at home I guess you can say. I work for www.chacha.com. You won&#39;t make a fotune though off this company and right now it is really slow (I only made 10 dollars last night but some nights I have been known to make  up to $50.00) but there is no cost what-so-ever and it is a real work at home job (I found out about it from that Tory lady on Good Morning America). What it is, is people text in questions and they are generated to your computer and you look up the answer and send it to their phone. There are other online job positions they offer but that is the one I am currently doing (I am known as a Generalist on there). Customers do this because ChaCha is free for them to text (ChaCha makes their money from advertising) and it is alot cheaper than having to access the internet on a cell phone. <br/>
<br/>
Like I said though, you will not make a fortune and having a part time job out of the home would probably pay more but you are like me, childcare is too much, no one can keep your children, getting a job outside of the home is difficult because of rise in layoffs and everyone trying to find jobs,  and you really want to be home with your kiddos.I needed to find something because we were only living off my hubbies income and money was getting very tight.<br/>
<br/>
Even though you will not be making a ton of money you will make some to at least fill up the gas tank, buy some groceries or even pay some of another bill (my money is generally spent on gas LOL). Will it make you debt free, make you never worry about money again...probably not but hey, any little bit helps right? :)<br/>
<br/>
Last I read, they were hiring more guides, this may have changed though because it is becoming increasingly popular but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to check it out. Just click on the link that says Become A Guide and follow the instructions. Oh by the way, they train you for everything so you don&#39;t have to worry on how you will learn what to do and they NEVER EVER charge you to work for them, which is what ever legit company does.<br/>
<br/>
PS: If ChaCha isn&#39;t for you, you can go to Good Morning America&#39;s website and they have a thing with quite a few work at home opportunities. I think there is other work at home jobs  called www.alpineaccess.com and www.liveops.com Both of those jobs do not charge you anything to work for them either but I have no idea what they are about (Isaw about them on Good Morning America too :) since I do not work for them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for posting about it this way! I&#39;ve seen several online<br/>
businesses coming through and it makes me uncomfortable. I don&#39;t want<br/>
this list here to advertise for online businesses. If you have<br/>
something you want to share just state what it is (as Kathryn did<br/>
above) and allow any interested list members to contact you off list<br/>
so we can stay on topic here.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one this to talk about a business you started or share a variety<br/>
of ideas,it&#39;s another to make an entire post about some online<br/>
opportunity. Please stick to discussing unschooling. If people need a<br/>
variety of ideas for making income while unschooling, we can discuss<br/>
it without all the information about one online company.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve deleted a message before realizing this conversation came up,<br/>
because it looked like advertising to the list. Make sure your post<br/>
doesn&#39;t read like an ad or it might not make it.:)<br/>

 <br/>
what are some ideas for jobs at home??  I am a single mom living on very little to be able to stay home with both my girls (4and 10). I don&#39;t have family here and most people I know aren&#39;t available to babysit as they work and have their families too or they just don&#39;t understand our lifestyle. I would like to be able to do more but finances are very tight and am now trying to see if there are any other ideas that I haven&#39;t thought of.  I used to do childcare but found that took away from my kids as most people in the is area aren&#39;t supportive of this lifestyle.  I have also cleaned homes for others.  So any other thoughts would be grand.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563312303">The website is www.westathome.com Like I said it took a couple of month to get hired. I applied and took the little test and it was a month or more till they sent me the paperwork to fill out with my personal information. Then it was another month and a half almost before I got the welcome e-mail for me to log on to start training. Though I do not think most people wait as long for the second half. Just keep checking your junk mail folder because their stuff ends up there sometimes. The campain I signed up for pays $7-$9 an hour and even if you get no calls you do make min wage for your state. Also they take out your taxes and stuff so that is nice. I will most likley start the training tomorrow night and I will get paid $6.55 an hour for that. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I am about to start my training for West at home.<br/>
&gt; Basically you take calls for <br/>
&gt; &gt; things like FTD, informercials ect. It is legit. I<br/>
&gt; looked into it a lot before I <br/>
&gt; &gt; started. It takes a few months for the whole process<br/>
&gt; though. However it is 24/7 <br/>
&gt; &gt; so you can choose hours that work the best for you. I<br/>
&gt; will be working the most <br/>
&gt; &gt; at night. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027905404">RE: work at home..for years I have looked for legitamite opportunities<br/>
to work and not have to have someone else raise my kids, I started a<br/>
group about this on facebook circle of moms.The best possibility I<br/>
have found is working an asleep overnight shift. That way you are home<br/>
during the day and see your hubby in the evening and go to work when<br/>
everyone goes to bed. I did awake overnight as well but that gets<br/>
exhausting. Good luck and look for my group on facebook circle of moms<br/>
maybe we can find new ideas and share new ways to be fully mom and<br/>
fully financially able:)<br/>
