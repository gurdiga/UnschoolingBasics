<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309931815">Yes, she definitely has anxiety issues as part of her TS (very common  <br/>
for kids with TS to have multiple issues, as you wrote).<br/>
<br/>
Her anxieties are funny in that she can be supremely confident in one  <br/>
area and supremely terrified in another area.  I&#39;m sure that can also  <br/>
be a very normal thing -  but for her the terror, when it happens, is  <br/>
soooo high, and so limiting to what she is willing to do, that I feel  <br/>
that it&#39;s more than &quot;normal&quot;.  Before I really came to understand her  <br/>
situation (and before I really learned to see life from her side,  <br/>
rather than what society was telling me to do with her), I would push  <br/>
her.  Over time, I learned to let go and I have seen how she has  <br/>
grown, being able to do things when she really wants to.  It&#39;s like  <br/>
one step forward and two steps back (my dh tells me I&#39;m getting that  <br/>
phrase wrong, but I think it&#39;s right -???).<br/>
<br/>
One of my problems, though, is that I still do worry from time to  <br/>
time (especially when something new crops up, or when a huge anxiety  <br/>
happens over something I thought she &quot;got over&quot;).  Then, it&#39;s hard  <br/>
for me to figure out how to react because I seem to have a hard time  <br/>
just taking a breath and not reacting!<br/>

My daughter also has TS (amoung other things). Do you think your  <br/>
daughter has some type of Anxiety Disorder? So many of these  <br/>
disorders run in families or have co-mingling conditions.<br/>

  I understand about the one step forward and two steps back.  I live it with my 7 year old every day.  She has NLVD, TS, SPD, and ADHD.  Does the Tourettes affect your daughter a lot?  Obviously the Anxiety is a big issue for your daughter.  I&#39;m trying to figure out how hard the Tourette&#39;s is for my daughter, but I think it kind of takes a back seat to all the other issues.  Luckily we have not had other kids make fun of her (up to this point) about the TS........although some of her tics a lot of adults and kids would not recognize as a tic.  Her eye tic (eye twitching) makes it real obvious she has TS.<br/>
