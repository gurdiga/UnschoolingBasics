<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305268246">I have 3 kids...8 yos, 6 yod, 4 yos.  This is our 3rd year to <br/>
homeschool.  After 2 1/2 years of being frustrated with my 8 yos, I <br/>
stumbled across unschooling and am very fascinated.  I&#39;ve been trying <br/>
to read up on it and increase my knowledge of the concept.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest question is what do you do all day?  Do you have some sort <br/>
of structure?  Or do you wake up each morning and ask the kids what <br/>
they want to learn about today?<br/>
<br/>
If one says she interested in veterinarians, where do I go from <br/>
there...besides the library or PetSmart?  If one says he likes GI <br/>
Joe...where do I go from there?  <br/>
<br/>
I truly love the whole concept and thought that&#39;s what hs-ing should <br/>
be, but have found myself in a curriculum rut trying to &quot;keep up with <br/>
what others his/her age are doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
HELP!  Send me your guidance, please...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It&#39;s great that you&#39;ve found unschooling. It really is a better way. Won&#39;t it be nice to be delighted with your son instead of frustrated? :o)<br/>

<br/>
I never ask that. It&#39;s too broad. I ask them what&#39;s on the agenda for the day or what they&#39;d *like* to do or if they want to join me in doing something. Our structure is more of a rhythym to our days. We get up, eat, read our email, etc. Our mornings are usually quiet and separate. We read, watch TV, write, take care of personal stuff, do our own projects. Our afternoons are more for together time. That&#39;s when we go out, see movies, check out a museum, visit new places or see friends. It&#39;s not like that everyday. We also do together stuff at home in the mornings or stay home all day in our jammies too. Our days flow and we go with it.<br/>

<br/>
Go where they want to go and no further. For the veterinarian interest I&#39;d be inclined to make animals a  part of our lives. Maybe get some pets, volunteer at the shelter, watch Animal Planet, go to the zoo, talk to the vet about their work, check out fun books, rent some animal movies. For GI Joe...I&#39;d get some GI Joes of course. Maybe that will spark an interest in history or costuming or firearms or something. Be interested with him and see what he&#39;s liking about it. But I wouldn&#39;t push, I&#39;d enjoy the play. The learning happens.<br/>

<br/>
Forget what the others are doing and look at your own kids instead. What are they doing? What do they love? How can you connect with them in their world today?<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
