<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611308406">Okay, if I sound out of it and frustrated, it&#39;s because I&#39;m out of it <br/>
and frustrated!! The kids are sick, I&#39;m still weak from being sick 2-<br/>
3 weeks ago and I&#39;m getting a bit stir-crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loosened up controls on food and tv and trying to talk about <br/>
things instead of just saying no. For instance, Mikey wanted to eat <br/>
breakfast on the couch watching tv yesterday. Okay, sez I, how about <br/>
a waffle? No, he wants oatmeal. Well, that&#39;s kinda messy so I&#39;d <br/>
rather he eats that in the dining room or has something different in <br/>
the living room. Nope, only oatmeal in the living room will do. Okay, <br/>
but pls. be careful. Two seconds later he&#39;s eating it with his hands <br/>
and wiping his hands on the couch. Yes, he had a napkin right there. <br/>
<br/>
I can wipe up oatmeal pretty easily, but in general, it seems like <br/>
situations like this aren&#39;t working. He&#39;ll agree to whatever I want <br/>
and then not do it. I just don&#39;t know whether I need to give it more <br/>
time or whether making conditions isn&#39;t the right way to do this. I <br/>
could give other examples if needed.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also asking questions and then not listening to the answers, <br/>
esp. when he asks what tv show is coming on next. So then he gets <br/>
upset when the next show comes on and it&#39;s not what he wants. And I <br/>
mean really upset so it&#39;s hard to talk to him. Do I shield him from <br/>
the consequences of not listening? I think not listening to me is a <br/>
form of power struggle for us, but I&#39;m not seeing the way out of it <br/>
today. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you wise women can help me see what I&#39;m missing. Besides sleep, <br/>
that is!<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

messy?  When I read this, it sounds like &quot;No, No, No,<br/>
Ok&quot;.....but it doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;hey, have you seen<br/>
what oatmeal does when it dries on something?  Check<br/>
this out!  If I stick it to this towel, come back in<br/>
an hour and we&#39;ll what a mess we&#39;ve made!&quot;...then it&#39;s<br/>
not *you* making rules again (that he may or may not<br/>
tune out)...but it&#39;s the two of you discovering<br/>
together *WHY* oatmeal rubbed in to the couch isn&#39;t<br/>
the best thing!  Having oatmeal rubbed in to the couch<br/>
itself is your opportunity!  You don&#39;t have to stage<br/>
it ;)  Say &quot;Wow!  Look how sticky this stuff is!  It&#39;s<br/>
kind of like play-doh!  This is hard to wash out of<br/>
the couch!!&quot;....OR<br/>
 <br/>

too, if he ate there....<br/>

First of all, an old sheet or throw over the whole couch works wonders. Jayn<br/>
wipes her hands kind of absently on the sofa pillows also. Sometimes I<br/>
suggest using her t-shirt instead - it makes us laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I have a hunch - perhaps I&#39;m wrong, but maybe not. If you are<br/>
making a change from saying no to saying yes with lots of words, it may be<br/>
that he is tuning you out. He has learnt that if he agrees, you stop the<br/>
seemingly endless flow of what may be meaningless seeming talking.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago, Jayn was really upset about leaving the park. She<br/>
was crying in the car seat and I was &quot;trying&quot; to be understanding, while<br/>
still wanting to get going. I was asking her why she needed to stay, beyond<br/>
the agreed upon leave time, and everyone else had gone etc, blah, blah, blah<br/>
- lots of questions and talking at her. I said, &quot;I want to understand why&quot;.<br/>
Her immediate reply stopped me cold, &quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I instantly realized that I was going through the motions of &quot;communicating&quot;<br/>
while I still had my own agenda, and she knew it before I did. I was trying<br/>
to manipulate her, while using the wordy &quot;tools&quot; of compromise!  What a<br/>
wonderful lesson she taught me in that moment. I immediately got out of the<br/>
car, and undid her seat belt, offering her to go back to the park, and<br/>
telling her that she was right, and thanking her. After a few hugs she was<br/>
ready to go home after all, but that is not the point. Sometimes we think we<br/>
are being honest and really communicating when we are not, because we are<br/>
still trying to a circuitous route to getting our own way, or at least<br/>
making sure that they know we are not happy with their way.<br/>

head, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
I need to go sulk, think, get over myself, say yes and then shut up!!<br/>

One thing we do for eating in the living room is we have some sturdy plastic<br/>
bins with lids about 18 inches high. We store pet supplies, legos,<br/>
blocks..that sort of thing in them. And they are perfect little tables for<br/>
when the younger kids want to eat in the living room. If it&#39;s a very young<br/>
child, we put a towel on floor first. They can sit on the floor and eat at<br/>
their own personal table.<br/>
