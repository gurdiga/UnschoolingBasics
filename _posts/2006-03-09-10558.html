<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016174793">Hi,<br/>
I can really sympathise with your problem. I`ve been a single mom  for  <br/>
basically 20 years, I have a 20y/o son and a 13y/o daughter. When my son was  young <br/>
I worked in an office and had to have him in daycare. I only saw him for a  <br/>
half-hour in the morning, a half hour at lunch time and a half hour after <br/>
work(I  worked until 7pm).It was horrible. On top of all that, he had PDD-NOS which <br/>
is a  type of autism.<br/>
 <br/>
When my daughter was born seven years later,I decided to work in group  <br/>
homes. I work third shift.I do an asleep overnight. I won`t be a millionare but  I <br/>
can be with my daughter all that I want.I figure that when she`s on her own I  <br/>
can go back to school(or not).<br/>
 <br/>
I hope things get better for you and your daughter.<br/>
Lyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076212529">First, take a look at your paycheck, then deduct all your expenses (gas, clothes, daycare, etc.).  Now look at your expenses, where can you cut back?  Eating out? Clothes? Adjusting the thermostat? Getting rid of cable?  What are you willing to give up to live your ethics?<br/>
<br/>
So look at your bills...look at your income minus the expenses.  How much money do you REALLY need?  What can you do from home to make that kind of money?  How can you juggle your timetable?  Can you live communally with another single mom?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I was just thinking to day about how the floor plan of our home would be ideal to rent to two single moms...kind of apartment type dwellings on both ends with a communal kitchen and living room.<br/>
