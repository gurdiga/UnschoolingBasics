<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629426414">I&#39;ve been lurking for a little more than a week and thought I&#39;d say <br/>
hello - I&#39;m Meredith, unschooling mom to Morgan, 5, who some of you <br/>
know from over on Always Unschooled or Consensual Living. My 13yr <br/>
old stepson, Rayan, has recently moved in with us - he had been <br/>
living with his mom and visiting alternate weekends for the past <br/>
five years. He&#39;s been asking to move to our house for awhile and his <br/>
mom has finally decided to let him, since she &quot;can&#39;t control him <br/>
anymore&quot;. She&#39;s Very controlling, and tends to be verbally abusive. <br/>
My partner, George, is still fearful of her. She has also had a <br/>
couple abusive boyfriends over the years, we have been finding out!<br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s been in public school. George and I would like to at least <br/>
homeschool and at best unschool him, but mom still has a lot to say <br/>
about the situation, and the last we&#39;ve heard is &quot;School&quot;. That <br/>
could change at any moment - he got suspended at the end of last <br/>
week and we&#39;ve been hoping to use that to help convince mom that <br/>
school isn&#39;t a good place for him (no news, yet, those of you who&#39;ve <br/>
been following the saga from other boards). She prefers to make last-<br/>
second decisions, though, so we won&#39;t know if he&#39;s going to school <br/>
on Monday until Sunday night. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, we&#39;ve been unschooling with Morgan for some time (I <br/>
like to think since preschool) and have gotten pretty comfortable <br/>
with the way unschooling happens for our family, but now we&#39;re faced <br/>
with bringing an older kid who has always been schooled into the <br/>
mix. Its awkward and challenging. He&#39;s not used to having any <br/>
autonomy, or having his needs and feelings matter. We&#39;re not used to <br/>
having two kids! Or helping an older kid figure out what he wants to <br/>
do. <br/>
<br/>
He likes skateboarding, but we live waaaaaay out in the country, and <br/>
so far we&#39;re only getting to the skatepark 1-2times a week - more <br/>
than he&#39;s used to, though! He enjoys Runescape and Myspace and we&#39;ve <br/>
been giving him lots of time on the computer - pretty much all he <br/>
wants. He loves to hang out with his friends, so we&#39;ve been trying <br/>
to facilitate that. But there are still big sections of day when he <br/>
says he&#39;s bored and doesn&#39;t know what to do, and George and I are <br/>
still struggling to shift gears and help him out. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve let him know he&#39;s welcome when Mo and I do &quot;experiments&quot; in the <br/>
kitchen, which could be cooking or mixing various things together to <br/>
see what kind of goo results. Its one of Morgan&#39;s passions. He&#39;s <br/>
still amazed that he &quot;gets to waste food&quot; in such a way and is <br/>
always asking &quot;is this okay&quot;? and &quot;can I really&quot;? Day before <br/>
yesterday we made cookie-cutouts with holes in the middle that we <br/>
filled with crushed candy. Crushing the candy involved a hammer, and <br/>
Ray was just beside himself with astonished excitement when I told <br/>
him he could be the one to pound the candy. He crushed waaaaaaay <br/>
more than we needed! so then he and Mo sucked up the leftovers with <br/>
straws (can I Really?). It was very charming and sad all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sort of at a loss as to where I &quot;belong&quot; in terms of <br/>
talking about Ray, asking for advice, etc. He&#39;s not an &quot;always&quot;, but <br/>
I&#39;m so comfortable on that board they&#39;ve been hearing a lot about <br/>
him. I&#39;d like to at least lurk and get ideas, here - although I&#39;ve <br/>
already posted once, I&#39;m a terrible lurker ;) - and a better <br/>
understanding of what deschooling looks like with young teens, even <br/>
though we *might* not be &quot;allowed&quot; to fully unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me ramble, anyway, y&#39;all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928962755">Meredith,<br/>
<br/>
First---welcome! I feel that I know from other boards, so I was <br/>
surprised to see you write that you&#39;ve only been here a short while! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest, IF he&#39;ll read, to give him a copy of Rue&#39;s book. I know <br/>
many would say The Teenage Liberation Handbook, but Rue&#39;s book was the <br/>
first book Cameron read (cover-to-cover by himself) after leaving <br/>
school. It&#39;s powerful for a child to read it---really! Powerful enough <br/>
for an adult, but the teens I&#39;ve given it to have been slack-jawed! The <br/>
TLH is pretty cool, and kids think, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s neat.&quot;---but they <br/>
don&#39;t always *get* it enough to follow through. They still think they <br/>
need classes or at least a &quot;plan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rue&#39;s book stops them DEAD in their tracks. Every single one has said, <br/>
&quot;I wish Rue were MY mother!&quot; They see how it *could* be instead of how <br/>
it actually IS. They see a light. It&#39;s not the school/educational <br/>
part---it&#39;s that an adult can be NICE to kids. It&#39;s a revelation.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s going to live with you, it might be nice for him to see what <br/>
you&#39;re striving for. *Why* you&#39;re nice and *why* you let him do these <br/>
cool things. Plus he&#39;ll know that you&#39;re not just crazy---some *other* <br/>
mom wrote a BOOK about it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that might make him more difficult at his mom&#39;s house---but, <br/>
like many families around here, once the kids get *too* difficult, the <br/>
parents just want them GONE! So it might work out best for him in the <br/>
long run.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest issue is that it might feel as if he&#39;s taking <br/>
advantage of you. But if he *knows* he can&#39;t---that this is the way you <br/>
live your lives, that you trust and respect him and why---maybe he&#39;ll <br/>
settle in quickly. He doesn&#39;t seem *angry* yet---so maybe you&#39;ll get in <br/>
there before he&#39;s given up.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
