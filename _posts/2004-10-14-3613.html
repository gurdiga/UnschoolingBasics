<br/>
So do you believe that those children are somehow being cheated of <br/>
great unschooling parents because their folks can&#39;t spell or write <br/>
perfectly? HOW ON EARTH is good spelling and writing paramount to <br/>
being a FABULOUS unschool parent? How on earth is good spelling and <br/>
writing paramount to a successful, rewarding life?<br/>
<br/>
Wow...that is so harsh and judgemental and SO offbase I don&#39;t even <br/>
know where to start. There are a few people here, and at <br/>
unschooling.com or other places that consistently misspell certain <br/>
words. Big deal. I probably make more grammatic errors than most, <br/>
but I can also get paid for publishing my writing!! <br/>
<br/>
My bil makes in excess of $100k per year and can&#39;t spell very well <br/>
at all!! I know story upon story of poor writers/spellers that are <br/>
absolutely brilliant. I&#39;m saddened that your opinion of these <br/>
radical unschoolers is so affected by one school subject. <br/>
<br/>
If that same parent, that can&#39;t spell very well is also one of the <br/>
most gentle and kind parents, a parent that is highly involved with <br/>
their children and showing them how to get information, a parent <br/>
that is wildly successful in whatever they choose to do in life, <br/>
would that change your opinion? Maybe school subjects aren&#39;t the end-<br/>
all-be-all of a wonderful life, NOR a good indicator of who will <br/>
make a great unschooling parent. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, there are many very dull minded people that can spell <br/>
and write perfectly. I prefer those with sharp wit and the ability <br/>
to THINK.<br/>

  &gt;&quot;It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>
  themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings <br/>
  and<br/>
  sentence fragments.&quot;&lt;<br/>
<br/>

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow...that is so harsh and judgemental and SO offbase I don&#39;t even <br/>
  know where to start. There are a few people here, and at <br/>
  unschooling.com or other places that consistently misspell certain <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  This just goes along with schoolish thinking--that spelling and grammar, expressing oneself with words equals future success.<br/>
<br/>
  When people fully accept unschooling as a lifestyle, they tend to let go of so many of their biases and judgments of people in general that they formerly saw as important become trivial.  Unschooling is not only good for parents and children, but for the world in general.  Unschooling goes straight to the heart of what is really important in life--joy, fulfillment, relationships, love of life.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How many of these unschooling parents who can&#39;t spell were unschooled<br/>
themselves?  I&#39;d wager none.  They probably can&#39;t spell despite the fact<br/>
that they went through the public school system.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Despite that, I think spelling is like penmanship.  For some people it comes<br/>
easy and for some people, no matter how hard they work, it comes with great<br/>
difficulty.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052427769">I&#39;d think the child is lucky to have great parents and hope there is a<br/>
role model in the picture for spelling :) because, like it or not,<br/>
people do assess literacy based on spelling. I myself know that this<br/>
is not necessarily the case and have often said that there would seem<br/>
to be a spelling gene and that I and my son have it while my daughter<br/>
and my sister do not. But just because my daughter doesn&#39;t have it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t important. And people who cannot spell and<br/>
cannot be bothered to use spellcheck seem to think that spelling is<br/>
not important :)<br/>

Those aren&#39;t the only two options though.  I am a horrible speller.  And that <br/>
is OK, I have managed to graduate HS and go on to get a BS, which I  don&#39;t <br/>
use at all, graduated top 10% of my class in both.  Have held down  jobs and am <br/>
a homeschool Mom who is very active in the community and well  respected, I <br/>
think...LOL.  But there are other options, asking someone to  spell something <br/>
for you, a dictionary, using a different word that you do know  how to spell, <br/>
writing the word down several different ways to see if one way  pops out at you <br/>
as correct.  Spell check is not the only option for a poor  speller.  And I <br/>
don&#39;t believe that spelling lessons, etc., will always  help.  I did all that in <br/>
school and actually scored very well on spelling  tests.  <br/>
 <br/>
As a poor speller, I have always known that this was not a strong point for  <br/>
me and I figured out ways to work with it, make it easier for me.  That is  <br/>
what I feel is important.  Learning to work with your weaknesses.   Recognizing <br/>
them and being able to problem solve and be creative.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285437450">nope it&#39;s not the only option, you&#39;re right. Nor is it always<br/>
available for that matter...the beta email product from google, which<br/>
I use, does not have spell check yet. I really don&#39;t want to get<br/>
sucked into another round of spelling does not equal intelligence. I<br/>
do realize this and have said so in some other thread on this list. I<br/>
have a daughter and a sister who can&#39;t spell and they are both very<br/>
bright.<br/>
<br/>
But I think a parent who teaches a child that it doesnt matter if you<br/>
can&#39;t spell is doing them a dis-service. It does matter. Nor do I<br/>
think that spelling lessons per se are the answer necessarily. At the<br/>
moment the spelling coaching I am giving my daughter involves<br/>
self-conficence because I have noticed that her misspellings usually<br/>
involve the last couple of syllables of long words. I think she gets<br/>
flustered, ie Constitushn. This is something that will vary by child.<br/>
<br/>
But it does matter.<br/>

just like I ignored your usage of &quot;chose&quot; instead of &quot;choose&quot; in a <br/>

My husband doesn&#39;t need to get his spelling checked when he is writing <br/>
an email on a discussion list where the entire point of BEING there is <br/>
to listen and learn from the content of each others&#39; posts. He gets his <br/>

Do you get your email in reverse order? Just wondering as I am not<br/>
sure why you would ask this if you have read my earlier emails.<br/>

I think you meant &quot;self-confidence&quot; not self-conficence.<br/>
<br/>
So when you said in another post &quot;And people who cannot spell and<br/>
cannot be bothered to use spellcheck seem to think that spelling is<br/>
not important&quot; -were you including yourself among the people who <br/>
cannot be bothered?  If so, then what&#39;s the basis for your argument <br/>
about how important it is to check our spelling or have someone else <br/>
do it for us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032458241">ah, more defensive nit-picking. Now tell me, does that look to you<br/>
like a typo or does it look like a spelling mistake? I am talking<br/>
about people who would write confedance and feel like it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
a difference :)<br/>
<br/>
But tell you what :) it has been gently brought to my attention that<br/>
Google *does* have a spellcheck, which I had overlooked. Since my<br/>
typos offend you, if and when I post here again, I&#39;ll be sure to run<br/>
it just for you :)<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087121604">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;d think the child is lucky to have great parents and hope there is a<br/>
role model in the picture for spelling :) because, like it or not,<br/>
people do assess literacy based on spelling. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just to keep the discussion going which people are these, and why do they<br/>
matter to my child?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159652526">thank you for your permission. Actually, I don&#39;t believe I was the<br/>
first to use the word survive. But it&#39;s a thought that surfaced on<br/>
another list and it consoles me at times. There are bad homeschooling<br/>
parents as there are bad schools. And children generally survive them<br/>
both.<br/>
