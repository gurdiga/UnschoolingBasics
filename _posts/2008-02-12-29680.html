<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944202090">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading a lot on this site and gaining such valuable <br/>
information.  I am fairly new at unschooling (since this fall), and <br/>
as I gain more knowledge, thanks to discussion groups like this, I am <br/>
starting to make more and more sense of things.  <br/>
<br/>
Today, my dd(8) had a class at the zoo.  While she had her class ds<br/>
(5) who is a very intense child, and I had some time to spend <br/>
together.  I was determined to make this zoo trip nothing like our <br/>
past zoo trips where I was always trying to turn everything into a <br/>
learning experience.  I just let ds go at his pace, look at what he <br/>
wanted to look at, do what he wanted to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Talk about a great trip!  He passed by stuff that I would have, in <br/>
the past, made him stop and look at while I &quot;discussed&quot; it with him.  <br/>
That was okay (never thought I&#39;d find myself saying that!).  He chose <br/>
instead to climb on all of the structures he could find (those meant <br/>
for climbing on and those not meant for climbing on!), He was more <br/>
interested in the vines that had fallen on the floor in the <br/>
rainforest than in any of the animals and that was okay.  He spent <br/>
more time looking at the common squirrels roaming around the zoo <br/>
grounds than any other exotic animal and that was okay.  He was so <br/>
into feeling all of the textures in the buildings and along the way <br/>
to the buildings.  We stopped so he could punch through some ice on <br/>
the sidewalk, we looked and looked at a dead turtle on the ground as <br/>
he speculated as to why it might have died (it was missing it&#39;s head <br/>
so lots of ideas came up).  <br/>
<br/>
My former self would have thought this was wasted time.  But today, <br/>
with my new outlook on things, I thought this was by far one of our <br/>
best zoo trips.  So did ds.  At one point, he said, &quot;This is the best <br/>
zoo day I ever had!  I like going to the zoo with you, Mommy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now the interesting thing is that there were other homeschooling moms <br/>
walking around with their younger children while the older ones were <br/>
in the class.  It was interesting to notice that they spent lots of <br/>
time giving their children lessons over things they thought were <br/>
important and even demanding that their children pay attention and <br/>
remember what they were talking about.  I was embarrassed to realize <br/>
that this was me just a few short months ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, in the past, I would have buddied up with one of the moms and <br/>
spent the entire time talking and forming a friendship.  I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that this is not good, but for me, this trip was about my son, <br/>
not me forming friendships.  I noticed lots of other moms getting to <br/>
know one another and ignoring their children for the most part, <br/>
except when they saw something that they wanted their child to <br/>
learn.  I was nice to the other moms but said that I was going to <br/>
follow my son around, and I did!  I made this trip all about him, and <br/>
it felt great!  I learned so much about him just in that hour and a <br/>
half!  Can&#39;t wait until next Tuesday to do it again!<br/>

This was really great to read about! It&#39;s amazing how much energy is<br/>
wasted by trying to direct and guide children, rather than simply<br/>
enjoying them.:) I bet you&#39;ll learn a lot from the adventure of<br/>
trusting him and trying to see the world through his eyes. Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439181141">Wow, that really is cool, and makes me want to make a trip to the zoo with my own 2 explorers, dd 14 and 10! Sounds like you all had a great time! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081508458">This was wonderful to read.  Its so true.  I am having many ah ha moments  these days.  6 months through the deschooling process and I think my husband and I are just beginning to learn something.  I too have made more and more days just about the kids and have found them delightful and indeed have found how much energy I save doing so.  What is incredible to me is how much trusting is involved and the surprise to find that when I am directing and guiding I am not trusting.  I feel more involved with the adventure of parenting and less weary because of the work to be done.  I am wondering though what happens to all the years when lack of trust has forced us to make many parenting mistakes....what do our kids do with these errors....<br/>
   <br/>
  All in all it is an incredible journey so far.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Donna and Brian<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329765546"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;what do our kids do with these errors....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By and large, they forgive us and over time come to trust that we have<br/>
indeed changed our ways. And, sometimes, they&#39;ll call us on it if we<br/>
start to slip back into old habits. And we can apologize if something<br/>
comes up &quot;Mommy, how come you used to...?&quot; &quot;Well, at the time, that was<br/>
what I knew to do but I&#39;ve learned some different things since then. I&#39;m<br/>
sorry for doing that...&quot; type conversation.<br/>
