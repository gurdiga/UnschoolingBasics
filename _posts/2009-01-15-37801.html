<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104785488">So my dd6 wanted to make a website. Since I don&#39;t really know how to<br/>
make a website we decided to make a multiply site. Well actually we<br/>
were going to make an msn group because that is the program I have<br/>
used in the past and it seemed to have all the features she wanted but<br/>
they are converting to multiply so we just made one there.<br/>
<br/>
Now she wants to throw a party for the first member who joins her site<br/>
because she is thinking of it like a club.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do here. I mean she is making party invitations<br/>
which is fine but what happens when someone actually joins the site?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298379259">Use a chat program with a conference feature that they can have an online party, send the invitations via email. They will be forced in a text environment to use their imagination and pretend to be eating cake and ice cream and such. But the conversation may not be much different than if they were physically in the same room. I am sure there might even be a program that they can use that will have little avatars they can move around room.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161627480">That would be good if she could write words that other people can read. I still have to have her translate over half of her words for me when she writes. I had not thought of a chat party..... Ok that makes it a little less frightening to try and figure out how to make it work.  Maybe kids can read kid writing better then adults can..... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283478454">You can do this at meez.com.  Each person can make a character and  <br/>
then they can go to a room that she creates and have the party -  <br/>
complete with many party things.  Awareness is required if others are  <br/>
allowed to join the room that she doesn&#39;t know.  You will need to be  <br/>
around because sometimes some pretty &#39;interesting&#39; characters join in.<br/>
Ask me for more information if you need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775384942">I dunno what multiply is... but, maybe you could get some<br/>
voice-to-text software, it&#39;s a lot cheaper now? That ways she could<br/>
talk in the microphone and it turns it into text? Or just let her do<br/>
it, you might be surprised. Or you could type for her. My son was into<br/>
this wizard101 game, where you can chat with other players and he<br/>
mostly asked me to help him talk to folks.</div>
