<div id="ygrps-yiv-562721422">&quot;How can you get along in a doggy-dog<br/>
world like this one without a formal education?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m being cheeky here, so don&#39;t be offended. But YOU had a formal<br/>
education and it sounds like it didn&#39;t serve you very well. You<br/>
managed to graduate (you said &quot;barely got by&quot;) and not know that it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;dog-eat-dog world&quot;? <br/>
Ok, kidding aside, it sounds like you struggled through school. Has<br/>
that experience left you whole? Has it left you passionate about<br/>
learning, full of curiousity and interest in life?  Doesn&#39;t sound that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work for your dd until YOU decide to unschool. You<br/>
haven&#39;t done that yet. Unschooling doesn&#39;t work if a parent waits for<br/>
a child to show some spark while pushing or worrying or seeing their<br/>
child as doing &quot;nothing&quot;. Which isn&#39;t true at all. <br/>
<br/>
What is she watching on television? Watch it WITH her. See the world<br/>
through HER eyes and see her as the wonderful human being she truly<br/>
is...right now, today. <br/>
<br/>
YOU have to decide to trust unschooling, before it can work. You don&#39;t<br/>
have that yet....so you don&#39;t know if unschooling works for her or<br/>
not. It will, I can promise you that much, if you will first start to<br/>
trust her.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it sounds like all the schooling you&#39;ve given her has caused a<br/>
lot of damage. She&#39;s trying to hide from your coercive methods by<br/>
doing things she likes, but now you&#39;re seeing her as &quot;less than&quot;, so<br/>
joyful learning can&#39;t even begin to unfold. More school isn&#39;t going to<br/>
heal that. She&#39;s trying to heal, but you need to start trusting her.<br/>
Trust that her desire to do &quot;nothing&quot;, is a desire to heal. Trust that<br/>
she is getting what she needs right now and start creating an<br/>
interesting life of your own!<br/>
Focusing on developing your OWN learning/interests and passions is the<br/>
best way to show her how joyful learning works. Once she trusts that<br/>
your invitations to join in aren&#39;t followed by coercion or<br/>
disappointment, she&#39;ll be more inclined to happily try new things.<br/>
Until you heal the relationship, re-gain her trust, the learning won&#39;t<br/>
work the way you&#39;re reading about here.<br/>
<br/>
Fix the relationship between the two of you first, then joyful<br/>
learning will simply be unavoidable!:)<br/>

Yes, you are right. I had a &quot;formal&quot; education, and was bored to tears with <br/>
it. I was more interested in my boyfriend, and getting OUT of school than <br/>
staying in.<br/>
My 12 yo tells me she LIKED school. Homeschooling was not something she cared <br/>
to do. But her father and I decided that this was best. The schools here are <br/>
no good. Danger wise, and education wise. The school had done alot of damage <br/>
to her. This is where I think alot of the problem lies. They had her in a <br/>
special needs class for reading difficulties, she couldn&#39;t pass the MCAS, so they <br/>
put her in extra help for that. And her Math grades were poor. She likes school <br/>
because of the socialization aspect.<br/>
I have two other children at home. A 15 yo 10th grader and a 7 yo 2nd grader. <br/>
They both thrive on books and &quot;doing schoolwork&quot;...but my 12 yo is different. <br/>
Can you unschool one, and not the other two??(hope that is not a dumb <br/>
question).<br/>
I guess my biggest fear with Unschooling(as I am sure it probably was with <br/>
others at some point) is what if they are out in the real world, and they cannot <br/>
even do something as simple as figure out how to pay for things at a store, <br/>
or write a simple letter, or wotk at a job and be able to count money and give <br/>
back change....or know the History of our Country....hmmm..actaully now that I <br/>
am saying this out loud, I will assume that these skills will be learned <br/>
since they would see it in our every day lives. <br/>
Pondering now..<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are many other ways of getting the socialization aspect without <br/>
the harm (scouts, ballet, sports, 4H, IMing on the computer, <br/>
telephone calls, etc.)... your daughter might even have some <br/>
suggestions herself.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the main reason I wanted to reply.  If you are allowing your <br/>
children to do what they choose to do as regards schooling, then you <br/>
are unschooling.  It doesn&#39;t matter if that means your children are <br/>
working through schoolbooks, choosing to take classes in a more <br/>
traditional school, or just &quot;playing&quot; all day.  I believe it &gt;IS&lt; <br/>
possible (and likely very damaging) to take a different approach to <br/>
how much you trust each child to plan their activities (thereby <br/>
unschooling one but forcing another to do lessons), but don&#39;t for a <br/>
minute think that unschooling means you have to keep an interested <br/>
child AWAY from activities that look more like school to you.<br/>
<br/>
Does that answer that question?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; since they would see it in our every day lives. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  The biggest advantage of unschooling, in my opinion, is <br/>
that it teaches children HOW to learn and leaves their DESIRE to <br/>
learn intact.  If somehow your child manages to get to adulthood <br/>
missing some important skill, they will at minimum have the knowledge <br/>
of how to gain that skill for themselves when they need it.</div>
