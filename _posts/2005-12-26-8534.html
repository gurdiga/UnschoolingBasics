<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041662085">Welcome Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So you can see I am not totally an unschooler as I believe that<br/>
each parent has gifts and talents to bring the picture that <br/>
definately make a<br/>
positive difference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll find that unschoolers believe we all have gifts and <br/>
talents that make a difference in the lives of all family members, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t equal coercion or forced learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; We expect him to eat healthy and excercise each day. We<br/>
don&#39;t impose any learning situations&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me pointing out the contradiction here....if <br/>
you make him eat a certain way and exercise, that is an imposition <br/>
on his learning in my book! You can still be an unschooler, and hang <br/>
onto those kind of parenting styles...I&#39;m certainly not arguing <br/>
definition here. But at this list, you will find lots and lots of <br/>
advice about trusting children in all areas, not just &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
topics.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to all individuals to take what they want from any list of <br/>
course, but the advice is geared towards applying unschooling <br/>
philosophies to all areas. <br/>
<br/>
Your sons D&D group sounds great..my boys are missing that part of <br/>
their life right now since we moved recently.<br/>

<br/>
The point you are making is certainly the issue worth many conversations and I imagine many great ones have already happened on this list. In most cases, Graham and I sit down and discuss our mutual interest and see if we want to collaborate together. I offer opportunities and he decides. Sometimes his interest lags halfway into the project or when it gets to a point where his skills and abilities are stretched. At this point there can be more gentle nudging onward on my part as I have worked with oodles of kids and I have learned that many have needed that extra external structure and support to get through difficult spots. Its later then upon the projects completion that the children have great pride in accomplishing those difficult tasks, they see it as their victory not mine.  I am all for  a child to be self internalised in all that they do, however we may disagree on the methods for getting there. For example I have spent endless hours working with kids and adults in challenge adventure education. When a person decides they want to say rapel off a cliff and we have taught them everything they need to know and they really want to do it and now they are at the edge of cliff and fear has frozen them up(as it is not a natural feeling to lean backward into space over a cliff) we don&#39;t force them over the edge but we incorporate our knowledge of this child and then utilize what support we can. We try to work them through their fear to a place of trust and safety, sometimes they go over terrified and sometimes crying. It can be the scariest most difficult thing they have ever done and when they are done they are on cloud nine...watch out world here I come. I don&#39;t know if that is a good illustration or not however knowing a child and their thinking process and beliefs allows a caring adult to taylor their  learning opportunities and sometimes I have found an external structure to be exactly what is needed. I really respect many things about unschooling which is why I am here though honestly I am more of a hybrid unschooler/experiential/challenge educator.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; We expect him to eat healthy and excercise each day. We<br/>
don&#39;t impose any learning situations&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me pointing out the contradiction here....if <br/>
you make him eat a certain way and exercise, that is an imposition <br/>
on his learning in my book! You can still be an unschooler, and hang <br/>
onto those kind of parenting styles...<br/>
***I am certainly comfortable with how we are proceeding with our approach to health and fitness. We don&#39;t force him to eat anything though we do expect him to eat for example two vegatables with each meal. He can decide what those veggies are. We expect him to exercise each day. Currently we are offering a whole body workout which represents some of the most current research on fitness and health. We do it together as a family, he takes pride in his gaining strength and flexibility. He is not always gun hoe in starting it each day, however by the end of the session he is alert, more fit, and happy and proud to have accomplished it. I have seen plenty of unfit homeschoolers and frankly I believe we have a responsibility to raise our children to be fit and healthy as well as self directed and confident in their abilities. My son gets about one cold per year and it doesn&#39;t hang around long. He doesn&#39;t get cavities. He has come to enjoy eating healthy, the only time we get flack is when one of his friends are over for dinner and this friend doesn&#39;t value eating healthy, then that unhealthy peer dynamic can play out, but its mostly noise.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to all individuals to take what they want from any list of <br/>
course, but the advice is geared towards applying unschooling <br/>
philosophies to all areas. <br/>
<br/>
You know Ren in my marriage we longer give advice as we have found that neither of us want it. We have come to see that its more interesting and respectful to inspire each other. Believe me this has been a journey to get here and we slip(mostly me) once in awhile. We might share ideas that we are excited about for example when I shared about the plants in my previous posts. However if I determine this to be an advice list I won&#39;t be around long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814093876">&quot;However if I determine this to be an advice list I won&#39;t be around <br/>
long.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you read the guidelines and the introduction?<br/>
Here&#39;s the list description, right on the front page:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask <br/>
experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out <br/>
how unschooling works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin <br/>
or what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for <br/>
you to discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with <br/>
natural learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting <br/>
issues to learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come <br/>
explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt with in the <br/>
past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling <br/>
lifestyle!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a list designed to help people understand UNschooling.<br/>
So yes, it&#39;s advice/discussion/ideas etc...designed to help people <br/>
understand a specific philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a support-for-whatever-kind-of-homeschooling-you-do list.<br/>
I thought that was pretty clear.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you stick around and read for a while, just to see how other <br/>
families have dealt with the same parenting issues and have healthy, <br/>
well-rounded, intelligent children without arbitrary limits.<br/>

  Ren I would like to stick around. I should have been more clear in my end statement. The notation you put in above gets at what I am trying to say which is yes advice is always welcome when someone &quot;ask for the advice&quot; however when its not asked for then there should be no reason to critique what they are talking about. I say this as a recovering advice giver. Hello my name is Chuck Learned, I am a recovering advice giver, spewing out advice when it wasn&#39;t asked for. I have been in recovery for about one year now. I have caused many much grief including myself. <br/>
<br/>
  A many a people I have offended and isolated by my zealot passionate opinions when they were not asked for.<br/>
  So I bring up this topic with much humility, it is so easy to do. Would anyone else like to introduce themselves to the newly formed AGA (Advice Givers Anomymous).<br/>

<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying. This list is very different from <br/>
real life though, in the fact that it IS a discussion list, designed <br/>
to help people move towards unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In the guidelines, we state very clearly that unless you&#39;re willing <br/>
to discuss it, don&#39;t post something...because once you post it, it&#39;s <br/>
open to discussion.<br/>
I originally wrote that, from being on lists for years and seeing <br/>
where things got off track in the past.  People will post something <br/>
and another person will comment and upset the first poster because <br/>
they weren&#39;t &quot;asking for advice&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But at a list, we don&#39;t have a choice about what other people choose <br/>
to post about, only what WE put out there....so I ask everyone to be <br/>
aware that when you post, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s less about advice, than it is about discussion I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
And you will find most anything in opposition to unschooling <br/>
philosophy, getting questioned here.:)<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, I googled your name (yeah, I&#39;m snoopy sometimes) <br/>
and found that you and your partner are into earth buildings. I <br/>
would love for you to post a couple good links on that topic if you <br/>
feel so inclined. Some of us are really interested in that sort of <br/>
thing.<br/>

and some of those responses are very likely to be in the form of advice.<br/>
<br/>
In that spirit, I&#39;d advise you to feel free to give advice here,  <br/>
based on your own personal experience, knowledge, and understanding  <br/>
of unschooling and to expect to receive advice on whatever you might  <br/>
choose to bring up for discussion.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe this policy should be questioned too as whenever you have an <br/>
agenda of convincing people then you are risk of disrespecting them. <br/>
The lists I find most satisfying and helpful are ones where they are <br/>
set up for people to support each other, share ideas, resources, <br/>
hard facts, inspiration and there are no overly aggressive agendas <br/>
too convince people. I wonder if the several hundred people on this <br/>
list think that this is different than real life.<br/>

of a problem in my experience, certainly not enough to warrant a <br/>
policy such as this. <br/>

&gt;&gt; And you will find most anything in opposition to unschooling <br/>

<br/>

feel impelled to save you and give testimony and there is no room <br/>
for wiggle or discension in their view of the world. This usually <br/>
makes most of us who don&#39;t view things the way they do to move away <br/>
from them. I don&#39;t agree with you or Pam on this matter, however I <br/>
realize I have now taken on the role of discenter which is not very <br/>
fun so I have created a poll for the group to respond to. So I will <br/>
let it rest and wait for the poll to finish out in January when I <br/>

<br/>
Then you are free to join those kind of lists, or not. Just like the <br/>
620 plus people here are free to be here or not. Apparently what we <br/>
are offering is wanted by certain people, or they wouldn&#39;t join and <br/>
stay for month after month.:)<br/>
<br/>
This list is exactly FOR the purpose of giving advice to people that <br/>
WANT to understand unschooling. It is not a support list, it is not <br/>
a general discussion list, it has a very specific purpose and the <br/>
members that joined expect us to stay true to that purpose. We can&#39;t <br/>
help people that join for  the purpose of recieving information if <br/>
we don&#39;t keep the list on track.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t appreciate the list I&#39;ve nurtured along, being likened to  <br/>
fundamental Christians either, since we aren&#39;t out trying to convert <br/>
anybody. It&#39;s just a list. It sits here quiet if nobody is getting <br/>
anything useful out of it. Apparently it&#39;s helpful for a few hundred <br/>
people (and growing).<br/>
<br/>
Fundi Christians are out to beat people over the head whether they <br/>
want the info. or not. I started a list, with a very clear purpose <br/>
and intent, people are welcome to join or not. I have nothing to <br/>
peddle or sell like salvation, I gain nothing from showing people <br/>
how unschooling works, other than the satisfaction of hearing about <br/>
how their families are more joyful, more peaceful and learning <br/>
naturally.<br/>

How very odd. Why not just unsub and look for another list that better suits your needs?<br/>

<br/>
Well there&#39;s lots of room for discussion here, but you have to be willing to actually discuss things. :o)<br/>
<br/>
If I signed on to a fundamental Christian email list I would expect that they would respond to my emails from a fundamentalist perspective. If the list&#39;s objectives were to bring people closer to an understanding of their Christian beliefs, I would expect those beliefs to shine through at every opportunity. If I stated my own personal approach to spirituality, I&#39;d expect question, advice, concern and all sorts of other discussion. That&#39;s what their list would be for. For those reasons I would not join such a list or stay on one I stumbled into mistakenly. I&#39;m not a Christian and more importantly I don&#39;t want to be one or know anything further about that particular religious lifestyle. I&#39;m not stopping them, I&#39;m just not joining up either.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not knocking on people&#39;s doors preaching about radical unschooling. We&#39;re not standing on streetcorners telling people their kids are going to school hell each day. We&#39;re here offering our advice to people who willingly seek out information on unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Then that&#39;s what you should have. Seriously and with no malice intended. You could start your own list. It&#39;s easy to do on Yahoo. Pam, Ren and others started and maintain this list and you could do the same with the above statment right in the  list description. You&#39;d probably get lots of takers and would be happily discussing, sharing and supporting without telling us why this list doesn&#39;t suit your needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303260918">Christmas Eve and Day were delightfully relaxed and easy going. Yesterday<br/>
was spent watching new movies and playing new games. Karl discovered Kate&#39;s<br/>
collection of Manga (Get Backers series) and has been reading through the<br/>
series. I looked high and low for a copy of a computer game we used to have<br/>
called Droidworks that Ben vaguely remembered and really wanted for<br/>
Christmas, so he&#39;s been playing that a lot yesterday and today. Today,  I<br/>
took everything out of my kitchen cupboards and totally reorganized them.<br/>
They&#39;ve been driving me crazy for weeks and this week I have time to tackle<br/>
these kinds of projects.  At the moment, the older three have a bunch of<br/>
friends over (at last count there are about 14 teens here). Some are playing<br/>
Imaginiff and the rest are upstairs watching a movie.  Lisa fixed lots of<br/>
good food for everyone and everyone is having a good time. Well, everyone<br/>
except Larry, our iguana. He climbed on the kitchen table and tried to eat<br/>
off the veggie tray. Now, he eats lots of veggies and I&#39;m not particularly<br/>
fussy about animals eating off the tray, but he needs them chopped smaller<br/>
than the ones on the tray. Poor think just about bit his tongue off trying<br/>
to eat a cucumber slice. I finally managed to extract it (without getting<br/>
bit, I might add. No easy feat!) and chopped some for him.  Then he wanted<br/>
to taste the chips so I had to get Kate in here to get him off the table. I<br/>
was busy holding plates and bowls to keep him from eating them. He can be<br/>
quite determined! He was not very happy with me. So all in all, a very nice<br/>
week so far. We are so involved in 4-H and Odyssey of the mind and other<br/>
activities that I really enjoy the break. But by next week we&#39;ll all be<br/>
itching to be busy again!<br/>

We spent all day at the &quot;Hands-On&quot; museum today, then to a pet store. <br/>
We came home with a lovely turquoise beta, whose name is &quot;scaly&quot; <br/>
according to Sierra.:)<br/>

<br/>
This is our best holiday season yet! It&#39;s our third as a family and <br/>
this is the most stress-free, relaxed and peaceful one, so far.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been staying close to home, just chillin&#39; out. We&#39;ll start going <br/>
out later in the week for some weekly activites that we haven&#39;t been <br/>
to since before Christmas. We also have plans to go ice skating. <br/>

&gt; What has everyone been doing to celebrate the holidays?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just finished watching a video of &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;  <br/>
with Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. Aaaaahhhh - so BEAUTIFUL -  <br/>
right up your alley, Ren, because it is all about color and light and  <br/>
connections!!<br/>
<br/>
And that gave me the urge to watch an Iranian movie called, &quot;Gabbeh,&quot;  <br/>
which is also about color - and about family and aging and life and  <br/>
love and is truly probably THE most beautiful movie I&#39;ve ever seen.  <br/>
So I&#39;m hoping to talk my family into watching that, later tonight.  <br/>
Here is a little summary, from &lt;imdb.com&gt;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Early one morning, an old couple emerge from a hut, she carrying a  <br/>
gabbeh, a small carpet, that she wove many years ago while waiting  <br/>
for her husband-to-be to carry her on horseback away from her family  <br/>
clan. As they wash the gabbeh, it comes to life, telling the old  <br/>
woman&#39;s story of waiting for marriage. We join the clan with its  <br/>
sheep, the shearing and spinning and dyeing of wool, and the making  <br/>
of gabbehs. &quot;All life is color,&quot; says her poetic, whimsical uncle;  <br/>
&quot;all life is color,&quot; chant the women as one of them gives birth. With  <br/>
deep focus and landscapes, the film also tells the story of nomadic  <br/>
life.&quot;<br/>

Poor think just about bit his tongue off trying to eat a cucumber <br/>

How cool! I have an iguana also. Her name is Buddie, she&#39;s 8 years <br/>
old, about 4&#39; long and about 6 pounds. She&#39;s also free roaming, like <br/>
yours. Ours is very adventurous....she once climbed down the outside <br/>

about a mile from our house. <br/>

I read the info on the list and it sounded like a place that I would enjoy.  I understood how the list worked and if I had a problem with it, I was free to leave.  <br/>

<br/>
Interesting that you view &quot;giving advice&quot; as synonymous with  <br/>
&quot;convincing people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I may &quot;offer&quot; advice - but I never ever try to talk anybody into  <br/>
TAKING my advice.<br/>

Hey Chuck, maybe your problem was never in the giving, but in the  <br/>
insisting?<br/>

My  problem is that I would MUCH rather lecture than be lectured.  When  I<br/>
post there is this small spot in my head that envisions the community I  post<br/>
to enraptured and bedazzled by my brilliance.  My would be  critics, when<br/>
confronted by my insights and impeccable logic, are rendered  mute and the<br/>
only responses are the accolades of the thousands of people  whose lives have<br/>
been rendered complete by the power of my virtual  presence*************<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Well, in this post, Daniel, you have at least totally cracked me up!   Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
And didn&#39;t John Holt say that the main problem is that everyone wants to  <br/>
teach, but no one wants to be taught???<br/>
 <br/>
****************<br/>
 <br/>
**Then of course, I find that everyone else actually DOES have an opinion  and<br/>
it does NOT necessarily match mine - and they are NOT necessarily  wrong<br/>
either**<br/>
 <br/>
One of the successes of unschooling, I believe, is that it does not  dwell on <br/>
right and wrong, black and white.  The world is a fabulous  in-between and <br/>
swirly sort of place, only egos to make determined lines in the  sand.   The <br/>
unschooler constructs theories about the world and  holds them as true until they <br/>
are proven no longer useful.  Then he builds  upon that theory and refines it <br/>
until it does become useful and right, at least  for right now.  Opinions <br/>
come and go, math and logic stick around a bit  longer (one pretzel plus another <br/>
pretzel is two pretzels, until one is eaten, of  course).  <br/>
 <br/>
I told this once to a friend of mine that perhaps has an unschooling spark,  <br/>
but is married to a very rigid man.  She thought I was an absolute  nutcase!  <br/>
How absolutely irresponsible to not tell my children every right  and wrong, <br/>
correct every mistake, every &quot;i&quot; dotted and every &quot;t&quot; crossed!   I feel so sad <br/>
that this is the world most children live in.  <br/>
 <br/>
Daniel, I eagerly await my gifts and money!<br/>

Hope you all had a great holiday !<br/>

right up your alley, Ren, because it is all about color and light and<br/>

<br/>
It sounds lovely. The other movie description (Gabbeh) actually caused <br/>
me to tear up...it sounds absolutlely beautiful.  I adore movies about <br/>
other cultures too...historical or cultural films are among my faves. <br/>
I will look those up. Maybe netflix? We have a really lame video store <br/>
out here in Jonesborough.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to drive a bit further for Blockbuster.:)<br/>

That sounds great Carol! That&#39;s what we&#39;re missing here, the big get <br/>
togethers with many friends. At least we have Brandie&#39;s family (waving <br/>
at Brandie) who are really fun and wonderful, radical unschoolers.:) <br/>
My boys would love to get a D&D group going again, and maybe a weekly <br/>
hangout/play day. We&#39;ll get there....<br/>
<br/>
Your crazy holiday celebration sounds fabulous!!:)</div>

<br/>
Exactly!  I especially don&#39;t like being taught about how to run a <br/>
successful and bubbly list...but I AM willing to learn.:)<br/>
<br/>
Being taught sucks. The person decides you need information, and they <br/>
try to get it into you no matter the results. If you don&#39;t learn the <br/>
information they&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot;, then you get labeled with some sort of <br/>
disability.:) School does it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
People love to learn of course. And a willing learner has no trouble <br/>
finding someone to share knowledge with them.<br/>
So here we are, back to unschooling and why we&#39;re all here. Love those <br/>
John Holt quotes.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Trying to recupperate... lol... why is it that extended family can be so  <br/>
stressful during the holidays???? <br/>
 <br/>
My BIL tried telling my MIL that WE don&#39;t do &quot;Santa&quot; with the kids. I&#39;m  glad <br/>
she decided to call and ask first. I would&#39;ve been really upset if that had  <br/>
been ruined for my kids. Then my uncle claimed our puppy has fleas, because he <br/>
 SAW them on her. Um, yeah... she&#39;s a double-dapple black, silver, brown and <br/>
a  mini-Dach. I&#39;m SURE he saw them. *sigh*<br/>
 <br/>
The kids had a great time. We&#39;re not doing much this week, since DH is  <br/>
working. They are looking forward to this weekend, where they are going to MIL&#39;s  <br/>
for New Years&#39; Eve. My parents might take the baby, so Dh and I might be  <br/>
spending New Years&#39; alone.  <br/>

We  celebrated christmas three times this year.  Once at home for US,  once<br/>
upstate for Amy&#39;s Father, stepmother and a few others and once for  the<br/>
grandparents (who had to celebrate christmas with the *other* side of  the<br/>
family :) ).  The kids think it&#39;s great and can&#39;t wait to get up  the next<br/>
day to celebrate christmas again!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lol... that sounds like our family. My side Christmas Eve, DH&#39;s side comes  <br/>
to us Christmas Day (we&#39;ve made the family &quot;rule&quot; that if anyone wants to see <br/>
us  Christmas Day, they come to us. I&#39;m not packing up 3 kids and pulling them <br/>
away  from their &quot;treasures&quot; and drive all over the countryside), and then my <br/>
Gram and  extended family the day after Christmas.  <br/>

<br/>
********<br/>
  That sounds good!  One of the things that has brought me so much joy this week is watching my children enjoy their gifts.  I got them the things they asked for but I also added several items just to see if they would like them.  My son, Jared usually doesn&#39;t like craft type stuff, but he got a wood burning kit and has been having a great time with it.  He and my daughter have also been having a good time with their new air hockey table and have been &#39;inventing&#39; new ways to play outside of the typical rules.  I love that they do this!<br/>
   <br/>
  We had fairly nice temps for this time of the year so we met our local unschooling group for an impromtu play at the park.  Most of us shared that we are sick of holidays (or maybe sick of relatives would be more precise:0).<br/>
   <br/>
  I find myself wishing I had the money to go out and get them several new toys like this each month so they would have a constant flow of new stuff to explore and enjoy.  I really want to establish a monthly &#39;presents day&#39;, just need to finanace it somehow.<br/>
   <br/>
  BTW  I really like this list just the way it is...no let me restate that...I NEED this list to be just the way it is.<br/>
  Thanks to the list owners for the hard work,<br/>
