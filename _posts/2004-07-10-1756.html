<div id="ygrps-yiv-114324961">&quot;Your 100% right though, for most adults, if they had dropped the<br/>
eggs they would have done little more then say sorry. But we Hubby<br/>
and I try to be a little more mindful then that and so we might have<br/>
done something more, like make dinner, do the dishes, wash the<br/>
floor. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds to me like there is a lot of punishing oneself in your <br/>
family. Why wouldn&#39;t &quot;sorry&quot; be enough? We like to do nice things <br/>
for each other from a place of love and joy, not guilt and &quot;owing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel a need to make up for anything if I accidentally break <br/>
something, it&#39;s just an accident. Accidents shouldn&#39;t get too much <br/>
attention....it just causes internalized guilt.<br/>
You&#39;re putting a lot of pressure on a very little person and <br/>
teaching her she is responsible for things she is NOT responsible <br/>
for. Daddy&#39;s anger is being internalized, trust me.<br/>
<br/>
No person is responsible for another person&#39;s feelings. To teach <br/>
your child otherwise is very unhealthy. I know this is a lot being <br/>
thrown at you all at once, and I know you are trying very hard to <br/>
make changes. I think some of these patterns are family patterns <br/>
that we aren&#39;t even aware of until someone points it out, so no <br/>
guilt for you either, but maybe something to start thinking about.:)<br/>
<br/>
Around here, we are a team. Accidents aren&#39;t a reason to make <br/>
someone feel badly, the person feels bad already and we help them <br/>
clean up and feel ok about it. My dh doesn&#39;t hold things over my <br/>
head, I don&#39;t hold them over his, and ditto for the kids. We&#39;re <br/>
learning together, striving to do better all the time. That doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean we don&#39;t get frustrated by messes sometimes, but we try really <br/>
hard to catch ourselves and make sure the child knows we aren&#39;t <br/>
blaming them and that we do the same things ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
If I wrecked Markus&#39;s car, I would feel really, really awful. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be expected to replace it on my own, or spend some amount <br/>
of time trying to make up for it. I would want to help fix it, <br/>
because that&#39;s what families do. He would be upset about the car, <br/>
but we would all work together for the good of everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Being a team, a support system, means working together. It involves <br/>
understanding and empathy. I think your dh would do really well to <br/>
try and read up on child development a bit. It sounds like he has <br/>
really high expectations for your dd. It also sounds like he&#39;s <br/>
venting his own childhood trauma somewhat. It might take a ton of <br/>
modeling kindness and deep respect for you, in order for it to rub <br/>
off on him...but it can be done! <br/>
<br/>
I think it was really, really great that you put your foot down when <br/>
he was on his tirade. You stood up for your dd, who couldn&#39;t stand <br/>
up for herself...that&#39;s really important. You did a good thing.<br/>
I would have said, &quot;Hey, eggs get broken&quot; and told her a story of <br/>
when I broke something. Eggs are cheap. They aren&#39;t worth harming <br/>
the fragile emotions of a child.<br/>
Go buy two dozen really cheap eggs. Throw them against a tree, or <br/>
drop them from a deck. Tell her that eggs can be replaced, but she <br/>
can&#39;t and that the important thing is the love you all share. <br/>
<br/>
If your dh is going to get really pissed about eggs, I have to warn <br/>
you, the older children get, the more expensive the breaks!:)<br/>
We&#39;ve lost windows, fragile things, food (hell, Jalen dumped a $7 <br/>
bag of dried blueberries today) and eventually CARS.<br/>
It&#39;s just stuff.<br/>
Trevor made a huge error and left $2,000 worth of camera and video <br/>
equipment on the back of my car, when he was supposed to put it IN <br/>
the car. It was all destroyed...all but one really old camera. I <br/>
still mourn for my equipment! But as he cried, knowing how much it <br/>
saddened me to lose it, I simply hugged him and said &quot;Trevor, these <br/>
kind of things happen in life, it&#39;s stuff I loved, but it&#39;s stuff I <br/>
can replace. I&#39;m really, really glad nothing bad happened to one of <br/>
you, I can&#39;t replace the people I love.&quot; and also &quot;that camera <br/>
equipment could never be as important as your feelings, you matter <br/>
more to me than anything I own.&quot;<br/>
It helped a lot. He already felt absolutely horrible. There was no <br/>
replacing that equipment by making him feel worse!  If you live to <br/>
be my age, and not destroy something valuable, plus a lot of <br/>
invaluable things, then you are unusual. You might as well accept <br/>
these accidents as part of life, and allow her the freedom of <br/>
knowing she is still a good, wonderful person, in spite of making <br/>
mistakes.<br/>
Having her &quot;make up&quot; for accidents is setting her up for emotions <br/>
and unhealthy patterns that need to stop.<br/>
