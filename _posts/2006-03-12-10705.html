<div id="ygrps-yiv-371762904">Hi my name is Lyn and I have been a lurker for quite a while now. I <br/>
stared out homeschooling my daughter three years ago and recently have <br/>
been trying the unschooling route. She is 13 y/o.<br/>
We`ll be going to Texas in a few days (just for a short 5 day visit) <br/>
and I`m trying to think of how unschooling fits into this <br/>
adventure.We`ll be visiting my brother for his 50th birthday.Any <br/>
suggestions would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
I call my daughter my personal GPS because she`s great with directions. <br/>
I have no sense of direction at all and could get lost in a cardboard <br/>
box. LOL<br/>
Thanks</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lyn,<br/>
Welcome to the world of unschooling.  You don&#39;t need to think about how<br/>
unschooling fits in with your trip.  Just take the trip and enjoy each<br/>
other&#39;s company.  I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll both learn something while your gone.<br/>
Treat her like you&#39;d treat an adult friend who was along for the ride.  Have<br/>
a blast!<br/>
<br/>
I always like to pick up the pamphlets at restaurants that have local<br/>
attractions on them and see if there is anything we might want to go to<br/>
while we are visiting a new area.  You might also check the paper for local<br/>
happenings while you are there.  <br/>
<br/>
Our family loves horses, so you can bet if we were going to TX, we&#39;d be<br/>
looking for some horsey things to explore.  We also like going to local<br/>
historical marks in new places.<br/>

  This trip doesn&#39;t need to fit into unschooling, or unschooling into it.  Unschooling is life and this trip is part of your life.  Give yourselves permission to do this trip without any &#39;educational&#39; agenda or expectations -- just have fun.  Treat your daughter like an equal.  Take turns choosing what you&#39;ll do next, or try something new to you both.  Or you could try familiar things in different settings.  Get a taste of the best the areas you visit have to offer, whether it&#39;s food or shopping or even horses.  You didn&#39;t mention where in Texas you&#39;ll be visiting.  It is a big place, after all.  We have visited Ft. Worth several times over the years, because my sister lived there until just over a year ago.  We never went without taking time to go to Six Flags for the rides.  If you&#39;re going to San Antonio, I hear it&#39;s beautiful with their lovely Riverwalk district. <br/>
   <br/>
  Just go, have fun, spend time with each other -- really together-- no agenda, just be there each moment.  Even if all you learn is how much you like -- or don&#39;t like -- what you try while you&#39;re there, it will be a full experience.  Much better than an &#39;educational&#39; experience any day.<br/>

Are you asking for places to visit, stuff to do? Unschooling is the adventure! Try googling the city you&#39;ll be in and start from there. Ask your daughter what she might like to do while you&#39;re there.<br/>
