<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205753634">&quot;But since it&#39;s here. I DO think we need to accept our children&#39;s<br/>
compliments graciously.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well actually, I did hug her and say &quot;you&#39;re so sweet, thank you&quot;<br/>
before I pointed out that I&#39;m learning and growing. I think it&#39;s good<br/>
for her to know that I&#39;m not perfect...she tends to think I AM. ;)<br/>
Kids are loyal at that age, I hope that she can see me as a whole<br/>
person with flaws and strengths.<br/>
