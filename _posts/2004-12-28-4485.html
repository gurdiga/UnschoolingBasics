<div id="ygrps-yiv-144193653">Letting go can be very scary indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read or researched any?  John Holt and John<br/>
Waldrof are excellent places to start. There is a web<br/>
site called radical unschooling.  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
web adress but you can google it or I am sure someone<br/>
else who knows it will post it for you.<br/>
<br/>
I only have one child but I am a single mom making<br/>
less then $1,000 a month. I get no child support or<br/>
goverment assistiant. So I know all about having to<br/>
skimp, skip, borrow and second hand find. There is a<br/>
great book, can&#39;t remember the name of it either but<br/>
it&#39;s all about how to use the whole world as a<br/>
classroom. It has loads of frugal ideas :) There is<br/>
another book I found at Barnes and Noble<br/>
&quot;Carschooling&quot;. It&#39;s great. It&#39;s full of ideas on how<br/>
to turn your car into a learning machine. ;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;knowing&quot; things in order to teach our<br/>
children.......I&#39;m sure most  of us would agree that<br/>
our job as an unschooling parent isn&#39;t so much to<br/>
teach them as it is to point them in the right<br/>
direction on how to get the answer. If you have no<br/>
idea admit it and offer to help them find the answer.<br/>
I believe it is more important to teach our kids how<br/>
to learn for themselves. Is it really that important<br/>
that they know all the capitals or that they could<br/>
find them on a map if they needed to. Silly example<br/>
but hopefully you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
Cheyenne<br/>

<br/>
One thing to remember is that since you really have no idea what the future holds for each of your children, you don&#39;t know what skills will be needed later.<br/>
<br/>
One may be a housewife, one may be an engineer, one may be an artist.  Other than very rudimentary skills, such as reading, basic math, which way is North on a map, etc., your children will need different skills.<br/>
<br/>
They will learn the basics regardless.  Reading comes from tv guides, games, stories, etc..  Kids learn the basics of math once they start having spending money.<br/>
<br/>
The other skills the kids will need will become apparent as their lives unfold and you will be right there to either help point the way or to point the way to someone who has the answers...or as often happens, the kids may find the answers on their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011526103">Once when John Holt was speaking to a school audience, describing his <br/>
views on the their structured curriculum, a student asked him, &quot;But <br/>
surely there must be something important enough that everyone should <br/>
learn it?&quot; He thought for a moment and replied, &quot;To learn to say ‘I’m <br/>
sorry’, ‘I don’t know’, and ‘I was wrong’.&quot;<br/>

Jeanne, that&#39;s *every* parent&#39;s fear! &lt;g&gt; But unschooling helps them  <br/>
understand that they are fully capable of learning what they need when they need  it. <br/>
That&#39;s *very* empowering!<br/>
<br/>

Well, everyone struggles with finances----richer people often more than  <br/>
poorer, sometimes, because they tie their money up in *things*!  &lt;g&gt; Creativity is <br/>
helpful as an unschooling mom! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Can you be specific? Maybe we can brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most people that I read about who are  unschoolers have one or maybe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>two children and were once schoolteachers or  have degrees in <br/>
something.I only have a  GED,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I have two &quot;onlies&quot;----My boys are eight years apart, so I have two  singles! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; When I first started reading about unschooling, I thought  everyone had <br/>
*multiple* kids----or GIRLS!! It all depends on which side of the  fence you&#39;re <br/>
standing on!<br/>
 <br/>
Some people will come on and say that everyone seems to live in the city  <br/>
with all the museums and zoos and opportunities; how do you unschool when you  <br/>
live rurally? Someone in the city will ask how can you unschool without a farm  <br/>
and animals and rows and rows of corn? Then there&#39;s the suburbite!   She  <br/>
complains that the city-dwellers have the great stuff and the farmers  have the <br/>
great stuff, but what&#39;s SHE supposed to do???? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Many of us are ex-teachers, many have no college degree at all! Some have  <br/>
PhD&#39;s; some GED&#39;s. The only requirements to unschool are a love of learning, a  <br/>
positive attitude, a willingness to look things up and do new things, passion, <br/>
 and the trust of and respect of your children. (There may be a few more  <br/>
that someone will throw in there!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and I dont know or understand a  lot.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing you know and understand your children. And that they are  <br/>
remarkable learning machines! You allow them to learn. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have never met any unschoolers in person.I would  love to hear any <br/>

Where do you live? Any chance you could come to St Louis, MO in October?  <br/>
There&#39;s an unschooling conference there. We&#39;ll have several inspirational  <br/>
speakers and TONS of unschooling kids! <br/>
 <br/>
You may even have a few in your town. Give us a location; maybe we&#39;ll  <br/>
surprise you and be in your backyard! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
