<div id="ygrps-yiv-882886328">The absenteeism thing was a porblem for our school district too when<br/>
my daughters attended PS. Ten absenses could get the parent brought up<br/>
on charges and fined! I refused to send them to school sick. It was<br/>
such a relief to &quot;be free&quot; of this bs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529133481">Ours is 12 absences but yes you can be brought on &quot;child neglect&quot; chages. <br/>
  Yes folks I was facing the possibility of up to one year in jail and /or a $1,000 fine because I wasnt rushing my child off to the doctor at every sniffle and I wasnt forcing her to go to school after her doctors note ran out .........she was getting over a case of meningitis she got from a head injury which she got from school and was still wanting to sleep all day. <br/>
  Oh yes and gasp ! I checked my child out of school early frequently to take her to our community theatre, childrens museum, zoo, etc. All the check-outs were during the last part of the day and she was skipping second recess and naptime. <br/>

  Excuse my sarcasm ...guess it dosent matter we are free! free! free! lol<br/>

  This may sound weird to some but Im glowing. If it wernt for this law problem I wouldnt have forced Courtney to quit but Ive just enjoyed so many little things today. For example Courtney playing with her little sister instead of little sister asking where Courtney was every half hour. <br/>
