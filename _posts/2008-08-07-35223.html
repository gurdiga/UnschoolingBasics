This is a group geared toward the raising of Pagan children in <br/>
today&#39;s closed-minded world. This is an International group, so <br/>
anyone, not only people in the US, but other countries may joine. All <br/>
that is required is that you have children or are a Grandparent, <br/>
Aunt, Stepmother, Mother-in-law, etc. Even Fathers, Grandfathers, <br/>
Uncles, Stepfathers, & Father-in-laws are welcome to joine. We have a <br/>
2 more groups, called Raising_Witches_2,and Raising_Witches_3, <br/>
Raising_Witches_4, & Raising_Witches_5. They are only for storage, <br/>
that&#39;s pretty much it. You may join that group from the link below <br/>
after joining this group first.<br/>
Let&#39;s celebrate our Pagan/Wiccan/Witchy/eclectic/etc. Roots and raise <br/>
our kids the way we want to!!!<br/>
