<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031365736">Dear all,<br/>
I am cautiously moving towards unschooling with my DS-3.8yr. The one thing that is continously helping me is reading. Every time i get ready with my meal plate i pick up books for my son and start reading aloud, and within few minutes he&#39;s sitting with me and i continue reading and the spoonful of nutritious meal slides smoothly in to his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I am of that opinion that 4 good meals is a must for a young child and keeps him merry and gay.<br/>
