<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030689442">My stepson travelled to meet us from Boston to Germany by himself when he was around 14 as well. He did have someone who set next to him and was there to help out if needed, but he said he could still do what he wanted and was basically left alone. I would not call it babysitting, he would have hated that too. I don&#39;t think there was an additional fee as I can remember. If it is standard airline protocol I would not lie about the age, especially if he does not look a lot older than his age and might be asked who he is traveling with. Probably also for security reasons to make sure he is not running away or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000767829">My 13-yr old neice just flew with her ski team from MN to OR<br/>
(coincidentally) for a 1-wk ski camp at Mt Hood. (We live in Oregon and met<br/>
her at the airport and drove her and 2 friends up to the mtn, which got<br/>
fresh snow this week! About 150 inch base and the whole mtn is open, usually<br/>
it&#39;s only the top during the summer.) <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, while we were having lunch on the way we found out that the airline<br/>
required an additional fee for kids under 15 so her dad just said she was<br/>
15. Another girl we were driving said her dad did the same thing and she is<br/>
14 (the third girl at lunch was actually 15). My neice is tall and quite<br/>
mature and could pass for 15, but I don&#39;t know if that helped or they just<br/>
believed her dad. She was not totally alone. She was travelling with many<br/>
other kids who actually are 15 or older, so maybe they didn&#39;t question it. I<br/>
don&#39;t know the whole deal, but they didn&#39;t require any sort of proof<br/>
(because there wouldn&#39;t be any!) other than the parent&#39;s affirmation! I&#39;ll<br/>
try to find out if he signed anything. I think it would just be your<br/>
conscience!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-803297051">Check out different airlines. Some don&#39;t even charge, southwest I<br/>
think. Some charge less, my 11 y/o just flew airtran their rules are<br/>
under 12 and they charge 39 bucks.<br/>

<br/>
That isn&#39;t necessarily true. Minors don&#39;t usually need an ID, though<br/>
perhaps for alone travel it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea. Our friend had her<br/>
14 y.o. travel up here under the &quot;escort&quot; option through the airlines<br/>
and he never had to show ID....that was last year. None of my children<br/>
have ever been asked for ID when I travel with them and we&#39;ve flown<br/>
several times with the new security (the most recent being to<br/>
Albuquerque with Trevor in &#39;06).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d call the airline to ask what they require.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232238241">We flew from CT to St. Croix (US VI) last fall and they wanted ID (we<br/>
had passports) for ALL of us, even though DS was traveling accompanied<br/>
by BOTH parents. They wanted birth certificate, passport, or other ID<br/>
for kids, driver&#39;s license or passport or other &#39;government issued photo<br/>
ID&#39; for adults. I suppose it depends, too, on where you&#39;re heading -<br/>
even though we were staying in the US, technically, it&#39;s a territory not<br/>
a state. They wanted ID to match it up with the names on the boarding<br/>
passes.<br/>
