My kids both did Junior Lego League last year with our hs group (pretty lowkey and non-competitive) and my daughter did a robotics camp at a local engineering college this summer and had a blast.  My understanding is that they suggest at least two meetings a week for Lego League and I spoke with one Dad who coached his sons&#39; team and he thought they would have done better with one more per week.  I&#39;ve also considered coaching a LL team but am not sure if I can take on the time committment and do it well....but if there were another committed adult, it might work.    <br/>
HTH a little!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979285854">I have helped with a team the first year that they sponsored lego league.  We met around Sept and the final event was in November, so we really had to meet about twice a week to get everything in order.  We started by modelling problem solving and teaching the kids who weren&#39;t familiar with it, so that they knew the process for resolving their group differences and decision making.  They did most of the work on the actual lego task.  They needed a bit of coaching on the oral presentation part.  It was a learning experience.  As unschoolers, we did the program with school-at-home people who were quite good in letting the children figure out most of it.  <br/>
I should probably post an introduction, but this thread caught my eye.  :-)<br/>
