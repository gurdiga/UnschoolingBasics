<div id="ygrps-yiv-660855282">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
We are hearing a bunch of people say they would like an unschooler&#39;s<br/>
playgroup formed here in CT. We would be happy to organize this. Since it&#39;s<br/>
summer,  let&#39;s start with outdoor places and find somewhere indoors later in<br/>
the year. (We have a few options in mind.)<br/>
<br/>
How about everyone emails us privately and says what days do and do not work<br/>
for them? We will pick a day that works for most people. We would love to<br/>
make it a weekly or biweekly thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also email where you live and we can pick a nice playground/park in the<br/>
middle of everyone.<br/>
<br/>
When we have what works best for us I will post it to other lists in case<br/>
there are others out there who do not know of these lists.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t wait to get our kids together. Our kids have gotten so much out of<br/>
being with other unschoolers at conferences. We would love to have that on a<br/>
more regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
Esther and Jean Elizabeth<br/>
and Ethan (age 9) and Ryan (age: 1 week until I&#39;m 6!!)<br/>
