<div id="ygrps-yiv-514871382">I wanted to respond to this because it is a constant dynamic in our house as<br/>
well, not only between my two children, but also my niece (as is the case<br/>
with you) who I take care of a lot or just invite over to play a lot.  I try<br/>
to help them have conversations about how we can resolve it... So the first<br/>
avenue we try is &quot;Okay, here&#39;s where each person wants to go, these are<br/>
different places, is there a place we can all agree on to go together that<br/>
is either one of these places or a different place altogether?&quot; and we<br/>
brainstorm that.  If that doesn&#39;t work, we move to &quot;Okay, is there a way to<br/>
go to multiple places that would work for mama, the driver, the time we have<br/>
today to go out and what everyone wants to do?&quot;  I also include myself in<br/>
the mix, but equally, if I have a desire/preference to go a certain place.<br/>
<br/>
So in your situation, with two wanting one place, and the third not, I&#39;d ask<br/>
my niece if there is a place she wants to go while we&#39;re out and see if we<br/>
could do both.  Often if my son for instance is feeling resistant, he&#39;ll<br/>
decide to go if we can do the Dairy Queen drive-through on the way, or if we<br/>
can stop by the library to see Daddy (dh is a librarian at our library in<br/>
the town we live in).  If the issue is that niece doesn&#39;t want to go out at<br/>
all, instead of viewing it as her being &quot;difficult&quot;, I&#39;d see it as her<br/>
giving her preference.  I&#39;d ask why ... maybe there&#39;s a game niece wants to<br/>
play before we go, maybe she would be willing to play it after, whatever it<br/>
is, it&#39;s worth finding out so you can discuss it and see if things can be<br/>
resolved.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say that I think there is a dynamic with me where it&#39;s<br/>
especially frustrating when my own two kids to agree (sometimes feels so<br/>
impossible) and it&#39;s my niece who is holding things up.  Arghhh!  I really<br/>
try to watch that I&#39;m applying the same thinking to the situation whether<br/>
it&#39;s my niece or my own child who is the one who wants to do something<br/>
different, because I think I do have a tendency to prefer the wants of my<br/>
own kids, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s my own higher voice or instinct calling<br/>
me.  I don&#39;t want my niece to get the message that she is treated somehow<br/>
worse than one of my own kids at my house and I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to get<br/>
the message a friend or cousin is somehow treated differently.  The<br/>
challenge is coming up with the energy for that for this third child when<br/>
that third child isn&#39;t with me the majority of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The case, unfortunately, was the second one. As far as I could tell, <br/>
she just wanted to sulk in a chair and no amount of gentle <br/>
questioning was reaching her. I asked if she was feeling frustrated <br/>
or if she wanted to do something else. I asked if she had any <br/>
suggestions that would help. She just kept telling me nothing was <br/>
wrong and she didn&#39;t want to go. <br/>
<br/>
To make things a little more clear... We do not normally watch her. <br/>
She lives out of state and was visiting my mom. When my mom left to <br/>
go on a trip, we had her stay with us for a few days. I assumed (not <br/>
a good idea) that she would treat my kids the same way most of the <br/>
girls her age have, that is in a nurturing manner. ie. wanting to do <br/>
Emma&#39;s hair or play games with Jacob or playing outside in the <br/>
sandbox, in the pool or on the swings. I could not have been more <br/>
wrong. Apparently she and my mom had had a tough time together and <br/>
she had been staying up late every night to watch the Olympics and <br/>
not really having any &quot;down&quot; time. She showed up very needy, which <br/>
was hard for me as both my kids had not been feeling well and are <br/>
usually a handful by themselves. <br/>
<br/>
When I posted, I was just grabbing a break for me because I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to treat her with disrespect and was feeling frustrated. My 2 <br/>
were dressed and fed and wanting to go and I thought she would be <br/>
too. (She had said earlier she wanted to go)Then I was overwhelmed. <br/>
Not only was I disappointed, but her feelings were spilling over <br/>
onto my kids who had been in good moods. They are 14 months and 2 <br/>
3/4 years old, so I usually try to time things pretty exactly so we <br/>
can still get meals and naps in within a reasonable time frame.<br/>
<br/>
She also had been treating my kids and me with disrespect the whole <br/>
time she was here. I tried to talk to her in private about this and <br/>
asked her to ask politely when she needed something and to not <br/>
scream at Jacob and Emma because they were not used to being treated <br/>
that way. (They kept getting upset and crying because she would grab <br/>
things from them and tell them &quot;no&quot; and take their food even though <br/>
I said there was more and she could have as much as she wanted, etc.)<br/>
It shocked me to see her behaving that way at 6 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect, I can see that she was just stressed out and needing <br/>
attention and doing anything she could to to get it while figuring <br/>
out our tolerance for her behavior. By the end of her visit, she was <br/>
changing her behavior more towards how we act. She would tell <br/>
Jacob &quot;I am getting frustated&quot; if he walked in front of the tv <br/>
instead of screaming at him to get out of her way. She played a <br/>
video game with him and helped him use the mouse when he had <br/>
trouble. They even played together while I got Emma calmed down for <br/>
her nap. Her trip ended on a good note. I guess she just really <br/>
needed to be treated with respect and allowed to decompress.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, I will be able to try some of your suggestions with my 2 <br/>
as they get older. For now, they are usually happy to go anywhere! :)<br/>

Wow, what a difficult situation and day for you all!  Sounds like you<br/>
