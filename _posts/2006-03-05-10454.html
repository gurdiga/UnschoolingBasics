<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300813236">My Name is Diana and I joined this list a while ago, My son Galen <br/>
had been in Ps from K-5 and it had never been a good experaince for <br/>
him or for our family. I had never wanted him to go to PS but my <br/>
husband Disagreed strongly and because of the typical &quot;social needs&quot; <br/>
theory we kept him there (what a crock that was). He is home with us <br/>
now after a suicide attempt at school and we are learning about <br/>
Unschooling. The Points of view shared on this list have been <br/>
wonderful for us to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
Although our son has to finish out the &quot;school year&quot; in the <br/>
homebound program in order to pass the state tests this year we are <br/>
prepairing for when that is over with. He is already a much happier <br/>
person than I have seen in years, he is making friends with people <br/>
in a local hs/us group we have joined and I simply can not express <br/>
how my happy my husband and I am. <br/>
 Next &quot;school year&quot; we are going to register our son with the <br/>
Homelife Acadamy Umbrella school and let them handle the paperwork <br/>
and such.<br/>
Although doing so we will be going directly against the wishes of <br/>
our parents and the recomendation of Galens specalist- who is a jerk <br/>
and said if we took Galen from school he would die, not only did he <br/>
not DIE he is thriving! and we are changing dr.s<br/>
<br/>
I have read posts from people who come to this list askig how to do <br/>
Unschooling and I find for myself and my family that unschooling is <br/>
not somthing we would &quot;do&quot; but more of a change in lifestyle for the <br/>
whole family. Slowly things are changing here and I think it is <br/>
good, while we have always been a family without many &quot;rules&quot; we <br/>
have some so deeply ingrained in us that I never stopped to even <br/>
think they were &quot;rules&quot;. those are the things we are slowly <br/>
changing, like no sweets till you eat somthing good. That was <br/>
ingrained into me as a young teen when it was discovered I had a <br/>
blood sugar problem and so thats been the unspoken &quot;rule&quot; at our <br/>
home, untill I joined here I never thought to even think twice about <br/>
it. (I wonder how it is that we can be so blind to things?)<br/>
But I find that stepping away from the &#39;rules&quot; slowly instead of all <br/>
at once works well for us,I think everything all at once would be a <br/>
huge shock to the system and cause a lot of chaos.<br/>
We do not have many things to change, like perhaps many others would <br/>
so I suppose I am thnakful that the idea does not seem overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
My husband who was always very negitive about keeping our son home <br/>
is now not only agreable to homeschooling but activly discussing and <br/>
interested in changing our lifestyle to a more unschooling approach.<br/>
That is how we see it, a lifestyle not a method..<br/>
<br/>
As for my son, he is a darling boy, very sweet & polite and I think <br/>
it will take time away from the &#39;school&#39; enviroment for him to stop <br/>
asking me &quot;can I go to the bathroom&quot; &quot;can I (whatever)&quot; I am just <br/>
going to be patient and say yes as much as I possibly can and I <br/>
think with time he will stop asking about the silly things (like the <br/>
bathroom!!)and just go on about his buisness.<br/>
<br/>
He came to me last week when he ran out of birthday money and asked <br/>
me if he could do the dishes for us in exchange for cash. (he knows <br/>
the dishes creep me out) I was kind of surprised by that, okay not <br/>
kind of, more like very-- but willing to give him money so I dont <br/>
have to do them. I wondered briefly if that would be looked down <br/>
uppon in the unschooling comunity and then I figured if he wanted to <br/>
and I wanted to then it didnt matter if someone else thought it was <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
the only major problem I forsee is our familys I know they will be <br/>
calling and asking &quot;what did you learn today&quot; &quot;do you know what 763 <br/>
devided by 8 is? &quot;when did pearl harbor get bombed?&quot; They could <br/>
never in a million years understand unschooling and would never be <br/>
willing to accept that I was doing that, I have already been <br/>
threatened to put my son back in PS next year &quot;or else&quot; thankfully <br/>
they live in another state and I doubt they could sue me for <br/>
custody. I hope they can&#39;t I suppose I had ebtter check the laws.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so thank you all for sharing your wisdom I am learning a lot here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47061094">There is a lot of mention here about Public School but not any other<br/>
schools. I have been looking into the Brooklyn Free School<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://brooklynfreeschool.org/">http://brooklynfreeschool.org/</a> . I&#39;m wondering what people&#39;s thoughts are on<br/>
that. You only have to attend the minimum number of hours a week required by<br/>
the Dept of Ed. and you are free to do what you want. <br/>
I&#39;m thinking of this option in case I get too stressed out with unschooling<br/>
or if ds says he wants to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are more &quot;Free Schools&quot; (I don&#39;t really know what the correct<br/>
term is, Organic Schools maybe?)in the US, but don&#39;t know much about them.<br/>

<br/>
Glad you&#39;re here Diana!!<br/>
It just cracks me up that your dh was the one worried about the &quot;S&quot;<br/>
word. Seeing him playing Magic on the floor with all the kids, and<br/>
video gaming with them etc...one would think he&#39;d been into the whole<br/>
homeschooling thing all along!:)<br/>
<br/>
Galen is such a neat kid. I&#39;m so glad you all are leaving the damage<br/>
of schooling behind and allowing him to heal.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;when did pearl harbor get bombed?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Isn&#39;t that really her own business. That&#39;s not very nice to talk <br/>
about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, they&#39;re all pretty flip answers. If they are calling (since <br/>
they&#39;re some distance away), can the kids be off &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
something whenever they call? Or, the kids can tell them something <br/>
they&#39;ve been *doing* then hand the phone back.<br/>

<br/>
Are you sure he needs to do this? What tests are you talking about? If he&#39;s homeschooling he&#39;ll be subject to different guidelines or rules than the schoolkids.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds pretty cool if your child decides he wants to go there. In the end, though, it&#39;s still a school. You&#39;ll be dealing with a certain amount of beauracracy and outside structure. I wouldn&#39;t rush to get him signed up for Kindergarten. But if at some point he wanted to try school, this seems like a good alternative.<br/>
