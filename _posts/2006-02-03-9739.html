<div id="ygrps-yiv-813822454">&quot; I think<br/>
though that more people will be educating themselves on what <br/>
unschooling<br/>
really is though and who knows...maybe Oprah will do a segment on <br/>
it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath on getting a fair representation from <br/>
Oprah, either. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love her. However, on another <br/>
board about 2 days ago, there was a post about her essay contest for <br/>
her newest book club selection, and the fact that homeschooler are <br/>
NOT eligible to participate in the contest. Here are some exerpts:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oprah&#39;s essay contest excludes homeschoolers<br/>
Host taken to task for requiring &#39;state accredited&#39; education<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Contest open to all legal residents of the U.S. who are currently <br/>
enrolled full-time (and in good standing) in a public or state-<br/>
accredited private or parochial school, grades 9-12,&quot; states the fine <br/>
print on a page explaining the contest on Winfrey&#39;s website. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the restriction, a letter from Winfrey announcing the <br/>
contest, which will judge essays on the book &quot;Night,&quot; says it is <br/>
open &quot;to high school students across America.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Michael Smith, president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, <br/>
or HSLDA, wrote an open letter to Winfrey protesting the policy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We contacted your show to see if homeschoolers could be included and <br/>
were rebuffed,&quot; wrote Smith. &quot;While we do not believe that your show <br/>
willfully excluded homeschoolers, the fact that homeschoolers were <br/>
excluded in the first place is troubling.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Ian Slatter, a spokesman for HSLDA, told WND he spoke to an Oprah <br/>
representative about the policy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We asked whether or not they could make an amendment to the rules to <br/>
allow homeschoolers to participate, and they were not willing to do <br/>
that,&quot; Slatter said. <br/>
<br/>
According to Slatter, the Oprah organization would not commit to <br/>
allowing homeschooled students to participate in future contests.&quot;<br/>
