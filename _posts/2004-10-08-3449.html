<div id="ygrps-yiv-203419728">&quot;We had a very civil conversation and have agreed to disagree<br/>
and to do nothing at this time, but since I am the one that is out with her<br/>
on a more regular basis it does affect me more than him. So I am curious how<br/>
other &quot;unschoolers&quot; handle this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I can tell our method. My dh feels like yours, that they should learn how to save long term. I stood firmly on the ground that it should be their choice, he agreed, but still wanted some kind of long term savings...so here&#39;s the system.<br/>
<br/>
The kids get regular money from us. I have a jar they keep any money they want to save or keep safe, it has a paper in it for keeping track of deposits and withdrawls. A home &quot;bank&quot; of sorts that they have complete control over. They can spend or save whatever they want.<br/>
Then they have a savings account at a real bank. I explained that Dad is really into seeing them save for a car or college or whatever big things they might want one day when they were older. <br/>
I told them that money would not be accessible, so whatever they put in would be gone for a long time.<br/>
It&#39;s completely and totally their choice to put nothing in that account, or a small amount or whatever. That way, dh is happy because they have a long term savings and the boys still  control their money.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has about $300 in long term savings and Jared has almost $200 last time I checked. They&#39;ll usually give Dad a few bucks at a time to put in. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve kept everyone happy and stayed true to unschooling ideals around here. Maybe that would work for you? The key is dh has to promise not to bug them about the amount to put in, or how they use their spending money.<br/>
Markus will ask the boys if they want to put some in long term when he sees they have a chunk of money, but if they say &quot;no&quot; or give him a couple bucks, that&#39;s fine and he drops it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277112858">I&#39;ve been reading through this thread with great interest.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some time ago, when I was tired of &quot;the gimmies&quot;, I decided to give each child (7, 5 1/2, and 4) $2 a week.  I explained that they could spend it or save it, and it was us sharing money with them, not an &quot;allowance&quot; per se, nor tied to any action other than being part of our family.  I have tried to show them charity it that I get $2 too and save some for the elephant house at the zoo and the local nature center.  I have also saved some of the money for a larger purchase.  I verbalize my thoughts when I do this, but they are just not getting it.  Further, the boys especially, spend their money every week on junky stuff -- things that are cheap and/or break quickly.  We have negotiated that I will warn them when I think that something will break or is of poor quality, but the final choice is theirs.  As ds #1 put it, &quot;It&#39;s my money.  You gave it to me.&quot;.  Of course too, if they spend all their money every week, they can&#39;t save up for the $6 items they want.  <br/>
 <br/>
Is there a period of time when they stop spending all their money and start realizing saving and charity?  What&#39;s your experience?  <br/>
 <br/>
As far as dh...  Like you said, I spend the most time with them and he yields to just about whatever I do (although if I were to suggest dying their hair blue he may have a thing or two to say!!).  He actually gives them $1 each at times as well, but finds the process of them spending it in a store where they need prices, etc. exhausts him.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m curious to see what others have to say!!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for posting this!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527146994">I don&#39;t know if this is feasible given whatever your financial situation is - but $2/week may not be enough for the 7 yo.  I have an untested theory that  kids have to have enough money for it to become *real* to them - in terms of actually being able to buy real things that they are interested in, in having enough to have some to spend and some to save.  Personally, I would never expect a child to be interested in charity - I wouldn&#39;t discourage it, but I wouldn&#39;t expect it to happen.   <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I vaguely recall that it was  6 months or so (we started when she was 5) before Lydia stopped spending money the instant she got it. <br/>

I think different kids will have different approaches. Sometimes mine <br/>
choose to save and sometimes to spend. My daughter just got $5 <br/>
birthday money from grandma and decided to put it into long term <br/>
savings. My son spent his on something he&#39;d been saving up for. But a <br/>
few months ago, my son used some of his to join the Audubon society. <br/>
One thing we discovered is that we had to give him a bigger allowance <br/>
in order for him to do more than just spend it all the time. When he <br/>
only got a dollar or two a week, I think he figured he&#39;d never be <br/>
able to save up for something bigger, so he just spent it on little <br/>
stuff - cheap toys and such. We started giving him more (he now gets <br/>
$4 a week) and he can pretty easily save up for a $20 item, so he&#39;s <br/>
more likely to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079537934">My girls (8 and 9) get $2 a week.  They have for several years. My younger<br/>
dd used to spend it as fast as she got it, on candy and small toys.  My<br/>
older dd has almost always been a saver.  Both girls will save for a $30<br/>
Breyer horse.  My older dd probably has a couple hundred dollars stashed all<br/>
around her bedroom.  My younger dd just had a birthday and she has over $50.<br/>
I have always let them buy whatever they want with their money.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
made them save it.  I think the most valuable lessons come from making<br/>
mistakes with your money and I&#39;d rather they made the mistakes with small<br/>
amounts than wait and learn those same lessons with big bucks when they are<br/>
older and the consequences are more serious.  They&#39;ve already learned that<br/>
very often impulse buys don&#39;t bring long lasting pleasure.  They know what<br/>
they like and they don&#39;t mind spending money on those things that they play<br/>
with the most, like Breyers.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While $2 a week isn&#39;t a lot, I still buy things for the family, like board<br/>
games and candy or some small thing that I know they&#39;ll love if it&#39;s cheap<br/>
enough.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Someone was talking about spending a lot on kids and how it might spoil<br/>
them.  I am in the process of getting ready to spend several thousand<br/>
dollars on my girls just to make them happy.  What, you ask?  Lol!  We are<br/>
getting them a horse!!!  And it&#39;s a gift that keeps on costing, but I know<br/>
they&#39;ll love it and use it often, so it&#39;s worth it.  We are looking at one<br/>
that sounds like a keeper on Sunday.  Wish us luck!!<br/>

<br/>
I guess my thought on this is, similar to what another poster replied, were<br/>
you only spending $2.00 per week on fulfilling those &quot;gimmies&quot; (horrible<br/>
expression) that your children had? <br/>
<br/>
It seems a very tiny amount, and would take so inordinately long (especially<br/>
to a child) to be accrued into enough to purchase any toy, book or game of<br/>
reasonable quality that it might be actually discouraging saving. Has it<br/>
stopped them from asking for stuff, or are you just feeling more justified<br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; to the requests? <br/>
<br/>
If it is a token amount designed to be &quot;pin money&quot; for sweets and minor<br/>
stuff to save yourself from constantly having to field requests, then<br/>
expecting it to be saved for larger items is sending a kind of mixed<br/>
message. If it is supposed to fulfill all their personal wants for toys and<br/>
treats instead of them asking you for stuff, it seems really small,<br/>
especially for the older two.<br/>

Many people have had great success with Kool Aid for dyeing kids&#39; hair<br/>
different colors.<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason, other than adult discomfort, why they shouldn&#39;t dye<br/>
their hair if they wanted to? I have every expectation that Jayn will want<br/>
to in due course. I think it will be great fun. There were some kids with<br/>
multi-colored stripes at the conference. It is kind of a rite of passage<br/>
thing, I think.<br/>

=====<br/>
<br/>
Aaaahhh, but see that&#39;s disingenuous. You don&#39;t really get $2.00 a week <br/>
or you would probably do different things with it. You&#39;re getting $2 a <br/>
week in order to teach them a lesson about money, however subtly. As <br/>
long as that teaching impulse is there, Unschooling ain&#39;t gonna work. ;) <br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with others who&#39;ve said that kids need to have enough <br/>
money to do something with and need to have been getting it for a long <br/>
enough time for it to mean something.<br/>
<br/>
My kids get $10 a month (not much more than the $2 a week, granted) but <br/>
it&#39;s taken them several months for it to be something actually to save. <br/>
At first they were only getting about $7 a month, and that just wasn&#39;t <br/>
enough for them to have some money to spend and enough to save as well. <br/>
They&#39;re still not thinking about charity even with the $10; they&#39;re only <br/>
just now starting to think about not spending it impulsively just to <br/>
spend it. Now, they&#39;re actually starting to say that they will save it <br/>
until the next store because they don&#39;t see anything they like or need. <br/>
And, I think that&#39;s a *huge* step. I can see what a struggle that is for <br/>
them, and I applaud it--especially as a person who tends to let money <br/>
burn a hole in my own pocket.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you&#39;d posted this on the AlwaysUnschooled list as well ;) not <br/>
just to plug my own list but because I think this discussion is really <br/>
pertinent and different when applied to young kids. I think that with <br/>
the little ones, we tend to impose our own value systems and wishes onto <br/>
them without giving them the room to grow and the time necessary to <br/>
develop the empathy and desire to give. Yes, I think some kids are born <br/>
more empathetic and with a greater sense of wanting to right the <br/>
injustices of the world. But many of us need to move through our own <br/>
self-centered desires to arrive at that kind of broader philanthropic <br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So, part of *getting* to Unschooling is letting our own hopes and values <br/>
be *our* hopes and values, modeling behavior honestly for our children, <br/>
offering the rationale behind our own actions and allowing our children <br/>
the leeway to form their opinions and make their own choices whether <br/>
they mirror are choices or not. A child who comes honestly and naturally <br/>
to giving is a child who gives without resentment or hope for return. <br/>
Isn&#39;t that really what we hope our children will do?<br/>

You could do that.  The way we do it, is I&#39;m the &quot;banker&quot;...the kids <br/>
feel like their money is safe with Mom watching over it and keeping <br/>
track of the withdrawls and deposits. I guess it depends on how old <br/>
they are, but even my almost 15y.o. likes it better that way.<br/>

<br/>
I am very behind so forgive the late reply. <br/>
<br/>
This is a great idea, I will approach DH with the idea and see what he says.<br/>
<br/>
I know dd would not go for the money jar thing that *I* control. She wants<br/>
to do everything herself and would strongly resist me keeping the money. I<br/>
say get her a piggy bank, dh says get one she can&#39;t open without breaking so<br/>
she won&#39;t spend what&#39;s in it. I don&#39;t agree.... we will have to think about<br/>
this more I guess,<br/>

how to save long term. I stood firmly on the ground that it should be their<br/>
choice, he agreed, but still wanted some kind of long term savings...so<br/>
here&#39;s the system.<br/>
<br/>
The kids get regular money from us. I have a jar they keep any money they<br/>
want to save or keep safe, it has a paper in it for keeping track of<br/>
deposits and withdrawls. A home &quot;bank&quot; of sorts that they have complete<br/>
control over. They can spend or save whatever they want.<br/>
Then they have a savings account at a real bank. I explained that Dad is<br/>
really into seeing them save for a car or college or whatever big things<br/>
they might want one day when they were older. <br/>
I told them that money would not be accessible, so whatever they put in<br/>
would be gone for a long time.<br/>
It&#39;s completely and totally their choice to put nothing in that account, or<br/>
a small amount or whatever. That way, dh is happy because they have a long<br/>
term savings and the boys still  control their money.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has about $300 in long term savings and Jared has almost $200 last<br/>
time I checked. They&#39;ll usually give Dad a few bucks at a time to put in.<br/>
That&#39;s how we&#39;ve kept everyone happy and stayed true to unschooling ideals<br/>
around here. Maybe that would work for you? The key is dh has to promise not<br/>
to bug them about the amount to put in, or how they use their spending<br/>
money.<br/>
Markus will ask the boys if they want to put some in long term when he sees<br/>
they have a chunk of money, but if they say &quot;no&quot; or give him a couple bucks,<br/>
that&#39;s fine and he drops it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749216902">Just thought I&#39;d throw in my two cents on hair dyeing:<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I dyed our hair earlier this year, using Manic Panic<br/>
hair dye. I really liked the dye, and it was *super* vibrant. We had<br/>
to bleach our hair first, and then I did mine in Flamingo Pink, and he<br/>
did his in sort of a Cookie-Monster blue. Our son chose purple for his<br/>
hair; we weren&#39;t going to bleach his hair, however, just apply the dye<br/>
over his already light-colored hair. However, after the dye arrived,<br/>
he sort of lost interest in the concept, but it&#39;s still sitting in the<br/>
cupboard, waiting for him to use it! <br/>
<br/>
I think next time I will be going for two tone red and black; that<br/>
will have to wait &#39;til the spring, however, since i am currently<br/>
working at a place that - get this - expressly forbids employees from<br/>
dyeing their hair anything other than a &quot;natural color!&quot; I will be<br/>
going on maternity leave in March, though, and will probably just quit<br/>
altogether at that point. But I digress :), anyway...I whole-heartedly<br/>
endorse Manic Panic!<br/>
