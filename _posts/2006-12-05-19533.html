<div id="ygrps-yiv-519826716">How do you tell if your child is not ready to learn certain things or <br/>
is just being lazy and disobedient?<br/>
My son has never gone to school. He has a great mind for science, <br/>
biology and history, but will have nothing to do with reading, writing <br/>
or numbers. I could read books to him all day and he would be content, <br/>
but don&#39;t ask him to try to sound out a word. He know certain words on <br/>
sight, but I only know that because he has let it slip a few times <br/>
that he knows what words are on the page. He does know his numbers to <br/>
about 100, and he can do simple addition and subtraction in his head, <br/>
but the minute I put it into a visual, he tells me &quot;my brain is <br/>
shutting down&quot;. ???????? <br/>
Because he is doing it in his head, I know he has the capacity for it. <br/>
Anytime we sit down to do any kind of practice like that, he just <br/>
refuses. Which I guess thats what unschooling is all about, however, I <br/>
feel like he just doesn&#39;t even want to try. I am torn between wanting <br/>
to let him lead the way and feeling like he will never lead the way to <br/>
certain things. Is this normal?<br/>
When you are unschooling, is it always nervous like this? I trying to <br/>
be openminded, but I am scared I guess. Scared he will one day <br/>
say, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you put me is school?&quot; &quot;Why didnt you ever MAKE me <br/>
practice writing and reading?&quot; He has no interest now, but how do you <br/>
know they ever will? And are you doing them a diservice if they NEVER <br/>
learn to read or write?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916976382">Oh, Mindy!<br/>
You are sure to get many responses to this.  But I have one very simple<br/>
question for you:<br/>
<br/>
Do you *really* think he&#39;ll never learn to read or write?  Honestly and<br/>
truly?<br/>
<br/>
Surely you have more trust and faith in your child; and that&#39;s all you need<br/>
to have a beautiful unschooling life!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your boy for just who he is right now, that&#39;s all we have is RIGHT<br/>
HERE and RIGHT NOW...<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t waste precious time worrying about things that certainly will never<br/>
come to pass if he has a loving, supportive mother, which it&#39;s obivous that<br/>
you are.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, and keep reading here and search the archives, you&#39;ll learn<br/>
oodles and more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488869050">Maybe you could look at it a bit differently.  You said that he &quot; <br/>
will have nothing to do with reading, writing or numbers&quot;  But then <br/>
said &quot;I could read books to him all day and he would be content&quot;.  <br/>
Your reading to him is having a LOT to do with reading.  In fact, <br/>
that&#39;s how a lot (most?) kids learn how to read naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;but don&#39;t ask him to try to sound out a word. <br/>
-A lot of kids don&#39;t learn to read this way.  Really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because he is doing it in his head, I know he has the capacity for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it. <br/>
-This is contradictory.  He is doing it in his head, so he IS doing <br/>
it.  He may not want to perform for you.  My daughter was a lot like <br/>
this.  She knew how to read but shut down if I or anyone else ever <br/>
asked her to read something aloud.  Occasionally she would read <br/>
something to me, but never if I asked her to.  She just wanted to do <br/>
it on her own terms.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt; And are you doing them a diservice if they NEVER learn to read or <br/>
write?  <br/>
-He is learning to read.  You already said so.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I was a little worried at times that my dd would never <br/>
write much.  She has difficulty with the physical act of writing and <br/>
just plain didn&#39;t do it for a long time.  But now (at 11yo) she can <br/>
certainly write legibly, if not neatly, and she&#39;s getting to be <br/>
quite a good typist.  Without &quot;practicing&quot; or pressure.  And now <br/>
she&#39;s writing stories and starting to post them online.  <br/>
<br/>
I would stop asking him to practice things for you and step back for <br/>
a while.  If he loves for you to read to him - that&#39;s huge!  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing to me that my younger daughter is suddenly reading when I <br/>
don&#39;t read to her nearly as much as I read to her older sister.  Not <br/>
even close!  She likes it, but my older dd really really loved it.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone can get a little freaked out sometimes, but it can <br/>
interfere with your son&#39;s learning if he thinks that you think he <br/>
should be practicing for you and performing for you.<br/>

better than you do.<br/>
<br/>
Three pieces of advice to help you see this differently:<br/>
<br/>
1) Write down what he *is* doing. So you can see the tremendous  <br/>
amount of learning that he&#39;s doing, even when he&#39;s not doing  <br/>
something that resembles school.<br/>
<br/>
2) Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation. Do what he would enjoy without  <br/>
thoughts of school.<br/>
<br/>
3) Live as though school didn&#39;t exist. Look at all the things that  <br/>
you&#39;re trying to get him to do that you wouldn&#39;t think of doing if  <br/>
school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you worried about reading? Because schools do it now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Which I guess thats what unschooling is all about, however, I<br/>
&gt; feel like he just doesn&#39;t even want to try.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if your husband plunked a carburetor down on the kitchen table  <br/>
and wanted you to rebuild it, would your disinterest be because you  <br/>
weren&#39;t interested or because you were lazy?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He has no interest now, but how do you<br/>
&gt; know they ever will?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When he was an infant without showing signs of talking or walking,  <br/>
did you worry?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read of any unschooling kids -- kids who have a rich  <br/>
environment and parents who understand unschooling -- who don&#39;t  <br/>
eventually read.<br/>
<br/>
*Lots* of kids in school either don&#39;t read or can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
The difference *can&#39;t* be because the kids aren&#39;t taught because  <br/>
unschooled kids aren&#39;t taught to read. The difference is that  <br/>
schooled kids have reading forced on them before they&#39;re interested  <br/>
or ready.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make kids read. But you can make them not *want to* read!<br/>
<br/>
But you can, while making sure they have positive experiences with  <br/>
reading, foster an environment where they do eventually read.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself if what you&#39;re doing is creating positive experiences  <br/>
with what you want him to do. If not, it&#39;s very likely you&#39;re pushing  <br/>
him further and further away from ever wanting anything to do with it.<br/>

<br/>
While you pretend it&#39;s vacation, read more about unschooling. That  <br/>
will give you something to do instead of hover over him worrying  <br/>
about what he&#39;s not doing.<br/>
<br/>
Read through these two sites and that will keep you plenty occupied  <br/>
while he goes about the business of learning ;-)<br/>

 <br/>
These pieces jumped out at me - have you done any reading on learning<br/>
styles? He sounds like an auditory learner but what you&#39;re trying to get<br/>
him to practice is a visual style (looking at print on a page, that sort<br/>
of thing). He IS learning to read (you said so) and learning numbers and<br/>
writing WILL happen when HE has a need to put his thoughts down on<br/>
paper. Then again, he may just want a tape recorder or voice recognition<br/>
software so it can get from his head to the printed page without the<br/>
physical act of hand writing it (&quot;penmanship&quot; is a whole other topic<br/>
from communicating with words).<br/>
 <br/>
Also, don&#39;t discount his reading ability just because he *chooses* not<br/>
to read books - is he reading signs, cereal boxes, toy catalogs, etc?<br/>
That all &quot;counts&quot; as reading even if it isn&#39;t what school would consider<br/>
valid.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and you don&#39;t say how old he is but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s under age 8<br/>
somewhere (maybe 6ish?) - one thing that I did with my DS when he was in<br/>
that &quot;almost reading on his own&quot; stage was to flat out ask him if it<br/>
would be okay for me to sometimes still read aloud to him because I<br/>
liked the cuddling. That made it &quot;okay&quot; for him inside himself to take<br/>
that final step to independently reading - he didn&#39;t want to because he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to lose that time together, but once I brought it out in the<br/>
open, that it was something *I* didn&#39;t want to miss, he said Sure we can<br/>
read together sometimes...and proceeded to go from 0 to 60 and be<br/>
reading on his own in no time flat. Now he will sometimes ask to read<br/>
together and other times he&#39;ll get up in the morning and mention<br/>
something he was reading the night before because he woke up after<br/>
falling asleep and read a while before falling back asleep (he&#39;s 8 now).<br/>
 <br/>
And, as someone mentioned, he did NOT learn via the standard sound it<br/>
out phonics method (we didn&#39;t use any curriculum or &#39;practice&#39; lessons<br/>
nor did we try to make him sound words out). Best I can figure, he<br/>
swallowed words whole, chewed on them a bit, digested the combinations<br/>
and sounds, and built his own &quot;phonics&quot; inside himself that he could<br/>
apply to new words. By learning the sound patterns in context (instead<br/>
of disembodied letters), he was able to skip the &quot;exceptions&quot; to the<br/>
rules and just add to his sound pattern &#39;blocks&#39; that this combination<br/>
does that.<br/>

This summer I learned to juggle. A friend of mine offered to teach <br/>
me. I listened to his explanations, but never picked up a bean-bag <br/>

adult in the program had been to school. Each one had been &quot;taught <br/>

<br/>
Some people like phonics - my 5yr old loves to play games where she <br/>
will think of a word and change one letter and try to pronounce it <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful to understand that schools use the techniques they do  <br/>
not because they&#39;re the best to teach kids but because they&#39;re best  <br/>
for *mass education*.<br/>
<br/>
While teachers and administrators may have the goal of providing the  <br/>
best for each child, they ultimately can&#39;t because they&#39;re using a  <br/>
system designed to raise the general level of education of the masses  <br/>
as cheaply as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The methods they use conform to that goal, *not* to the goal of  <br/>
helping each child be the best he can be.<br/>
<br/>
Having all kids read by 4th grade serves the needs of the schools and  <br/>
teachers *not* the children. No child *needs* to read at 9. Though  <br/>
many manage to and many *want* to, there is nothing that a 9 yo needs  <br/>
to be a better 9 yo by reading. But it&#39;s convenient for the schools  <br/>
to have every child reading by 4th grade so they can use the same  <br/>
curriculum on them, and tap into children taking in information  <br/>
that&#39;s handed to them to speed things up. (But not all children in  <br/>
school are reading by 4th grade. The ones who aren&#39;t are pulled out  <br/>
and given special instruction which, no matter how gently done, gives  <br/>
them the idea that they&#39;re stupid because they can&#39;t do what the  <br/>
&quot;smart&quot; kids can do. :-/)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take years to learn how to read. It takes years (usually)  <br/>
of being around printed matter being exposed to it. It takes needing  <br/>
and wanting to read. It takes brain development that allows it to  <br/>
happen (which for some kids happens at 3 and for some kids doesn&#39;t  <br/>
happen until 13 or 14 or 15.) When the brain is ready, kids are  <br/>
reading in a very short amount of time after they begin. A 15 yo who  <br/>
has just begun to read is not 9 years behind a 6 yo who has just  <br/>
begun to read. The 15 yo will be reading at age level within months  <br/>
and be indistinguishable from peers who started at 6.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about Gardner&#39;s Intelligences that Sandra Dodd  <br/>
posted. What&#39;s important in unschooling is providing what your child  <br/>
needs, not what a school -- who is trying to keep 30 kids together at  <br/>
the same level of skills so they can be mass educated by just one  <br/>
teacher -- would do. If a child needs to run around, then that&#39;s the  <br/>
way he&#39;s going to learn best. If a child needs to listen, then that&#39;s  <br/>
the way he&#39;s going to learn best.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Gardner&#39;s Intelligences....<br/>
&gt; I found a clear article about this.  There are lots out there, but  <br/>
&gt; many are very specialized or focussed in a particular way.  This  <br/>
&gt; one seemed general enough, and I&#39;ve lifted the descriptions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Howard Gardner initially formulated a list of seven intelligences.  <br/>
&gt; His listing was provisional. The first two are ones that have been  <br/>
&gt; typically valued in schools; the next three are usually associated  <br/>
&gt; with the arts; and the final two are what Howard Gardner called  <br/>
&gt; &#39;personal intelligences&#39; (Gardner 1999: 41-43).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written  <br/>
&gt; language, the ability to learn languages, and the capacity to use  <br/>
&gt; language to accomplish certain goals. This intelligence includes  <br/>
&gt; the ability to effectively use language to express oneself  <br/>
&gt; rhetorically or poetically; and language as a means to remember  <br/>
&gt; information. Writers, poets, lawyers and speakers are among those  <br/>
&gt; that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic intelligence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to  <br/>
&gt; analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations, and  <br/>
&gt; investigate issues scientifically. In Howard Gardner&#39;s words, in  <br/>
&gt; entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and  <br/>
&gt; think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with  <br/>
&gt; scientific and mathematical thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Musical intelligence involves skill in the performance,  <br/>
&gt; composition, and appreciation of musical patterns. It encompasses  <br/>
&gt; the capacity to recognize and compose musical pitches, tones, and  <br/>
&gt; rhythms. According to Howard Gardner musical intelligence runs in  <br/>
&gt; an almost structural parallel to linguistic intelligence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence entails the potential of using  <br/>
&gt; one&#39;s whole body or parts of the body to solve problems. It is the  <br/>
&gt; ability to use mental abilities to coordinate bodily movements.  <br/>
&gt; Howard Gardner sees mental and physical activity as related.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use  <br/>
&gt; the patterns of wide space and more confined areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Interpersonal intelligence is concerned with the capacity to  <br/>
&gt; understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people.  <br/>
&gt; It allows people to work effectively with others. Educators,  <br/>
&gt; salespeople, religious and political leaders and counsellors all  <br/>
&gt; need a well-developed interpersonal intelligence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Intrapersonal intelligence entails the capacity to understand  <br/>
&gt; oneself, to appreciate one&#39;s feelings, fears and motivations. In  <br/>
&gt; Howard Gardner&#39;s view it involves having an effective working model  <br/>
&gt; of ourselves, and to be able to use such information to regulate  <br/>
&gt; our lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Added a few years later:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Naturalist intelligence enables human beings to recognize,  <br/>
&gt; categorize and draw upon certain features of the environment. It  <br/>
&gt; &#39;combines a description of the core ability with a characterization  <br/>
&gt; of the role that many cultures value&#39; (ibid.: 48).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other intelligences being considered (and discussed a bit in that  <br/>
&gt; article) are spiritual, existential and moral (or some blend of  <br/>
&gt; those, because though people talk about them, they&#39;re not settled).<br/>

I think it would help you a lot to drop not only these terms in<br/>
relation to your child, but the mere thought that he is either of<br/>
those negative descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Lazy happens because someone else has an idea of what a person&#39;s<br/>
activity level should look like, rather than trusting the person<br/>
themselves. &quot;Lazy&quot; doesn&#39;t exist in my world, neither does<br/>
&quot;disobedience&quot; because having my children obey me is not a goal.<br/>
<br/>
I want them to think for themselves, have their own barometer of what<br/>
is good and right for their lives and they won&#39;t get that from obeying<br/>
me but from discussing, pondering, experimenting and learning in their<br/>
own way. We all listen to each other when something important comes<br/>
up, rather than having any one group in the house subvert themselves<br/>
to authority.<br/>
<br/>
So if learning is the goal, then trust is the first and most important<br/>
factor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945337114">When I noticed my son &quot;slipping&quot; that he knew words, he was also<br/>
reluctant to let me know that he could read.  After talking about it<br/>
[his reluctance] many times, he finally told me that he was scared I<br/>
would stop reading to him if he could read for himself.  As soon as I<br/>
reassured him that I would read to him anytime, anywhere for as long<br/>
as he wants me to read to him, he started openly reading.  He&#39;s a very<br/>
skilled avid reader now, well beyond his schooled friends reading levels.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there&#39;s a reason that he doesn&#39;t want you to know he can read<br/>
similar to that.  Also, my DS flat refused any writing utensils as a<br/>
baby and toddler.  Wouldn&#39;t color for anything - not that I pushed but<br/>
any kind of group setting at that age involves coloring for some<br/>
reason.  Guess they&#39;re not thinking outside the box.  ;)  When he<br/>
turned 4, my 2yr old DD started drawing on the MagnaDoodle.  And of<br/>
course, she&#39;d bring it to us to draw things and eventually, someone<br/>
would write the names of family members.  DS started playing with it<br/>
and within a week, he was writing his name as well as any other 4yr<br/>
old.  It was a slow process and I never pushed anything on him but I<br/>
did comment on &quot;great job!&quot; (not overly pushy though) when he would<br/>
show me something he wrote.  He still wasn&#39;t a big fan of it but he<br/>
and DD have gotten into scrapbooking with me the last year.  When I<br/>
pull out my supplies, they pull out theirs.  And of course this<br/>
involves some writing after you get the basics of cutting and gluing<br/>
down.  Now, just over 6, he&#39;s copying words from books for &quot;fun&quot; in a<br/>
journal.  It&#39;s not daily and he doesn&#39;t have a love of writing but the<br/>
point is that he&#39;s picked up the basics with very minimal practice and<br/>
would be considered at a &quot;normal 6yr old level&quot; for schools.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll get there.  My opinion is that someone would have to work very<br/>
hard to not learn to read and write when exposed to it daily as our<br/>
children are.  I didn&#39;t use them for this purpose but I&#39;ve heard that<br/>
video games are also a great way to get them to want to read<br/>
(especially boys).  Not the cheesy &quot;educational&quot; ones but just a good<br/>
 RPG that requires reading or even something that has a menu you have<br/>
to sort through to choose weapons and armor, etc. for your character.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Morgan used to write letters and numbers with a pen (no crayons or <br/>
pencils) only on paper. She&#39;d only draw on the chalkboard or floor <br/>
in chalk, or with her magnetic drawing board - it got so I&#39;d take a <br/>
picture with my digital camera so I&#39;d have something to &quot;save&quot; ;) <br/>
Over the last year she&#39;s just exploded into drawing on paper and <br/>
using a wide variety of implements. Now I have more kid-art than I <br/>
know what to do with.<br/>
<br/>
She also started writing letters by using stencils - we came across <br/>
a set one day at the dollar store and she was soooooo excited. <br/>
Before then she&#39;d trace things but would get really frustrated if <br/>
she tried to write on her own and it didn&#39;t come out the way she <br/>
wanted. <br/>
<br/>
One of the (never-ending) complaints from my stepson&#39;s now ex school <br/>
was that his handwriting was terrible. On Monday he spray-painted a <br/>
big box for Mo to play in and one of the things he painted was her <br/>
name. His handwriting is lots better in spray-paint! Maybe it was <br/>
just that he was choosing to do something rather than being forced, <br/>
or maybe he&#39;s finally found his &quot;preferred writing implement&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747048171">Wow! You all are an awesome group of information and encouragement, <br/>
thank-you! I started to respond to several comments made and realized <br/>
it would be a book by the time I was done!!<br/>
I am really blessed by this group. I have been so concentrated on <br/>
what &quot;the other kids his age&quot; are doing in school, that even though I <br/>
don&#39;t want to admit it, I am really bowing to the pressure. One minute <br/>
I am thinking what a great thing it is to let him learn at his own <br/>
pace, the next I am comparing him again. <br/>
I hope as I go through this journey, my confidence level in <br/>
unschooling becomes solid, because my heart tells me it&#39;s the right <br/>
thing to do. I am doing lots of reading on it, but I tell you, you <br/>
ladies gave me info I hadn&#39;t read yet. <br/>
Hopefully I can contribute this kind of advice as my son becomes older <br/>
and &quot;I&quot; get wiser. <br/>
Seems I&#39;m the one who needs concentrate on learning a few things, not <br/>
him!<br/>
All of your responses were so helpful, I am printing them out for <br/>
future encouragement!<br/>
Thanks! Mindy</div>
