<div id="ygrps-yiv-272193153">Hi! I&#39;ve been reading posts from this group since June 2004 and this<br/>
is my first post.  I can hardly keep up with the reading, let alone<br/>
write something!  So I&#39;ve saved up a lot and this is my intro, praise<br/>
for the conference, thank yous, comments, and questions all in one :).<br/>
<br/>
My intro:  I&#39;m Christine and I have 4 kids; Alexa (11), Autumn (9),<br/>
Nic (6) and Nate (4).  My girls went to public school for K-4 and K-1.<br/>
 I never even considered homeschooling. &quot;Are you kidding, my oldest<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot; child and I would do nothing but fight!&quot; But luckily my dh<br/>
was offered an assignment to a place where the schools were &quot;awful&quot;<br/>
and everyone sent their kids to $9,000/year/kid private schools. <br/>
Since that wasn&#39;t a possiblity for us, and &quot;education&quot; was a high<br/>
priority for us, I started to research homeschooling.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember what lead me to John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Children Fail&quot; but it<br/>
changed everything.  We ended up staying where &quot;the public schools are<br/>
some of the best in the nation&quot; (*note the sarcasm, very good school<br/>
but still a school) and I still wanted to unschool! This is our second<br/>
year and my oldest dd, who was &quot;dyslexic&quot; in school, is so much<br/>
happier, likes reading again and our relationship is so much better.  <br/>
<br/>
Praise for the conference: I can&#39;t believe that a conference could<br/>
change my life so much!  Dh and the kids rolled their eyes whenever we<br/>
talked about going to a conference for vacation, and I began to doubt<br/>
myself asking them to drive that far for it but I figured if the<br/>
conference was a bust (for them)  there&#39;s lots to do in St. Louis.  We<br/>
ended up only seeing the Arch and the City Museum and  * I * was the<br/>
only one who wanted to at least see the Arch! LOL My dh said that<br/>
since we are *all* having fun and learning so much, we don&#39;t *have* to<br/>
do anything and we should stay at the conference!  I couldn&#39;t believe<br/>
it. He went from thinking that we were making a mistake with<br/>
unschooling, to trusting me because I&#39;m passionate in my belief in it<br/>
and have spent alot of time reading about it, to understanding it and<br/>
believing this would work for our family!<br/>
<br/>
 And while that is so incredibly wonderful to have his support and<br/>
understanding, I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on what it was that made<br/>
the conference even more special than that.  Then I realized that<br/>
although I&#39;ve always believed that you should live in the moment, <br/>
make each day special and find joy in what ever you are doing, I<br/>
really struggled with actually doing it. The conference and all those<br/>
wonderful speakers made me see how wonderful, fun, and exciting every<br/>
day life is *each and every moment*.  Young kids get that, they just<br/>
lose it along the way and if I can reclaim it and keep it for my kids,<br/>
that is the best thing I can do. And learning and trying new things,<br/>
without fear of mistakes or that it will lead to some career, is what<br/>
makes life so fun and exciting. <br/>
<br/>
Thank yous:  Kelly- thank you for cordinating the conference, you<br/>
helped change our lives. And thank you to all the speakers: Pam,<br/>
Sandra, Anne, Ren, Danielle, Robyn and Kelly.  I&#39;m so grateful that<br/>
the &quot;gurus&quot; of unschooling are such eloquent writers and speakers and<br/>
share your time and life with us. I felt like I was at movie premiere<br/>
with movie stars; I&#39;ve read so much about you and learned so much from<br/>
you and there you were in real life!  And thank you to everyone on<br/>
this board for taking the time to ask and answer questions,  I&#39;ve<br/>
learned along with you.  <br/>
<br/>
Kelly, at one of the break out sessions you had mentioned that you<br/>
thought kids had easy years and hard years, and I said it was the <br/>
theory of disequilibrium/equilibrium that you had figured out. Isn&#39;t<br/>
it funny how parents can instinctly figure things out, even without<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; ;)  I couldn&#39;t find a really great link, but this is<br/>
similiar to what I had seen<br/>
.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://crs.uvm.edu/nnco/communsupp/work4.html#bp">http://crs.uvm.edu/nnco/communsupp/work4.html#bp</a> <br/>
<br/>
 Kids go through stages of huge learning spurst (at the 1/2 year or<br/>
odd years)  while they are figuring things out, and they are &quot;out of<br/>
sorts&quot; and &quot;harder&quot; on the parents.  And once they it figure something<br/>
out, (at the beginning of an age or the even years), they are &quot;easier&quot;<br/>
on the parents.  Of course, kids are all different and some start a<br/>
stage 6 months earlier or later, but it&#39;s still a similiar pattern.<br/>
<br/>
Danielle,  you recently said : &quot;Sam came and helped me redefine what<br/>
amazing, loving children look like, and they&#39;re not always easy. ;)<br/>
But, they&#39;re always rewarding, and they benefit just as much, if not<br/>
*more*, from the AP and Unschooling, and they help *us* grow and<br/>
stretch in amazing, glorious ways that &quot;easy&quot;children do not.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have 3 out of 4 &quot;spirited&quot; (not easy) kids and I had been extremely<br/>
frustrated with my youngest when I read that quote. And it made me<br/>
realize that I was lucky to have one easy kid so I didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
the worst parent in the world, and proof to me that so much is their<br/>
inborn personality, and I hadn&#39;t somehow messed them up.  And I was<br/>
given Alexa, Nic and Nate to push me to learn more. I thought one was<br/>
plenty to challenge me, but I guess I&#39;m really stubborn ;)   Nate has<br/>
made it even more clear to me that you can&#39;t force anyone to do<br/>
something (even gently and explaining why).  I&#39;m someday going to<br/>
completely understand &quot;mindful parenting&quot;  which is my goal, and I<br/>
never would have been &quot;stretched&quot; to do so if my children were easy,<br/>
compliant kids that traditional parenting worked with. <br/>
<br/>
So now my questions:  I&#39;ve been trying to say &quot;yes&quot; more and working<br/>
out compromises, but I&#39;m really struggling with balancing everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs and wants.  With my 4 year old, everything has to be his idea or<br/>
he just won&#39;t do it. It is fun to see him doing things his way :).  <br/>
Our biggest struggles have been leaving the house. He&#39;s a happy kid as<br/>
long as we are home. So I&#39;ve been trying to honor what he wants, shop<br/>
and run errands without him, and have lots of completely open days to<br/>
hang out at home. But how do I handle times when I need him to come<br/>
with us and if we stay home,  3 other kids miss out on what they want<br/>
to do?<br/>
<br/>
2nd question:  How do you handle fights between kids?   Especially<br/>
when they have such different personalities.  I worry that the older<br/>
kids take advantage of the younger, the stronger personalities always<br/>
win, etc.  We&#39;ve tried to take turns, flip coins, &quot;paper, rock, and<br/>
sissors&quot;.etc.   But one kid points out that one side of a coin is<br/>
weighted to win more often, and  etc. etc.  They are too smart for<br/>
*my* own good.  We seem to spend all our time to trying to work things<br/>
out  and then they complain that we don&#39;t have time to do more things. <br/>
<br/>
Well enough out of me<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43815666">Welcome Christine!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you got to go to the conference (we couldn&#39;t).   Where do you <br/>
live?   We&#39;re in MA.  <br/>
<br/>
You mentioned your spirited children.  Have you checked out Anne&#39;s <br/>
group, shinewithunschooling?   My dd (13) is spirited, or as I now <br/>
realize, thanks to Anne&#39;s group, highly sensitive.   This is our first <br/>
year unschooling, I pulled Danielle out at the end of 6th grade in <br/>
June.  We&#39;re still deschooling (BOTH of us!).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had much time to check in the past couple of weeks (it&#39;s been <br/>
a challenging month for my dd, first period, bumps in the deschooling <br/>
process, you probably saw my post) plus we had to move my MIL from <br/>
assisted living to an Alzheimer&#39;s nursing facility a couple of weeks <br/>
ago, still trying to sell her house, we&#39;re over an hour away from all <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to pop in and say hi!<br/>
