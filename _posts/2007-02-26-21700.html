all there!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Thanks Kelly and sorry to bother you Sunday night.<br/>

I will be there Tuesday afternoon and would love any tips on what to <br/>
bring to my then 5 year old ds and 18 month old dd.<br/>
Any other tips on the Conference will be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
We are new to the group and have a 2 1/2 yo daughter.  I was just <br/>
reading all the wonderful experiences at the conference and wondering <br/>
if anyone knew of an upcoming conference in Florida or in the <br/>
southeast.<br/>

Thanks for your inspiring stories!<br/>
