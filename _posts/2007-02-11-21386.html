<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053893096">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry but I lost your last email so I hope I don&#39;t fall too far off<br/>
target, I&#39;m working from memory.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, who ever said that Saudi women are imprisoned? I&#39;m amazed at<br/>
how the West perceives women over here, especially when that<br/>
stereotype couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Segregation and<br/>
seclusion are two different matters.<br/>
<br/>
THhose who can afford it (which is quite a few) have their personnal<br/>
drivers to take them where they want. THose who can&#39;t either ride with<br/>
a friend or take a cab. They have the option to go shopping or<br/>
visiting their friends/relatives whenever they want. There are many<br/>
things that a women here could do to pass her time...almost as many<br/>
things as you could do to pass your time. From swimming and working<br/>
out (at all-female centers) to collecting things, cross stitching and<br/>
reading, They however chose to spend their time passively in front of<br/>
the TV. There&#39;s lots I can say about my observations here but I&#39;ll<br/>
wait till I&#39;m in Canada first.<br/>
<br/>
Saudi Arabia is a LOT more modern than most people give it credit for.<br/>
Do you know that I don&#39;t even need to sign up for an internet account?<br/>
I simply access the dial-up number and it&#39;s credited to my phone bill<br/>
(unfortunately, we have to pay for local calls here. It&#39;s a lot easier<br/>
here to get a chip for a cell phone than it ever was in the US or<br/>
Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not going to talk about the negatives for now but they are<br/>
not the things that you would expect. If you think about it, ask me<br/>
about it in July and I&#39;ll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
As for conforting a child, is it really a good idea to confort a child<br/>
with TV?I sincerely want to know because of the following. Let&#39;s say<br/>
that instead of TV, the child seeks food for confort? This is how<br/>
emotionally eating begins..I know because I&#39;ve been battling food<br/>
addiction my whole life. Will you step in before it becomes a problem<br/>
or let it get out of control? I&#39;d like to know your opinion and the<br/>
unschooling opinion in general regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take this as an attack, I simply would like to know what happens<br/>
when a confor turns into a potentially self-sabbotageing behavior.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s exactly why we&#39;re questioning your attitude that the<br/>
country has been &quot;brought to it&#39;s knees&quot; by television.<br/>
<br/>
My Grandfather worked in Saudi when I was a kid. I have family and<br/>
friends that have lived in Turkey (also more westernized) and traveled<br/>
through that region extensively. Just had a big discussion with<br/>
someone because they were lumping Saudi in with the likes of Taliban<br/>
ruled Afghanistan the other day......two different worlds!<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with your attitudes about tv and how it&#39;s affecting the<br/>
country. Television is going to have a very different effect in an<br/>
area where there is more oppression though, can&#39;t really equate it to<br/>
an unschooled  child living in America.<br/>

  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  No, by definition, segregation can&#39;t happen without seclusion, and being disallowed from driving or choosing one&#39;s style of dress in public are specific methods of limiting one&#39;s movements, which equals imprisonment.  I stand by my use of that word.  <br/>

<br/>
Just because there aren&#39;t metal bars, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t a prison.<br/>
<br/>
The things you listed don&#39;t sound like fulfilling things. They sound  <br/>
like things to while away the time. And it sounds like society sees  <br/>
it as a good thing for women to have the leisure to &quot;pass time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Raising kids can be fulfilling, but I think women need to feel the  <br/>
work they do with their kids is not only valuable but essential.  <br/>
Would you say that&#39;s how they feel?<br/>
<br/>
Do they have opportunities where they know they are valuable and  <br/>
essential? That if they were to leave, that it would be very  <br/>
difficult to find someone else to do what they&#39;d been doing?<br/>
<br/>
Can women choose without repercussions from family and society to  <br/>
find fulfillment in a career or to not marry or not have children?  <br/>
Without the freedom to choose, there is no choice. The less choice  <br/>
there is, the more it feels like prison.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As for conforting a child, is it really a good idea to confort a child<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some children *choose* TV as a comfort for stresses they have no  <br/>
control over. Like the stress of school, for instance. They do this  <br/>
on their own without parents to help them. (Of course the parents are  <br/>
part of the source of the stress since they&#39;re making kids go to  <br/>
school!)<br/>
<br/>
The primary goal should be removing the stress.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a problem with choosing TV for comfort when it seems like  <br/>
the right thing to do. If a child came home disappointed from a  <br/>
disagreement with a friend, a snuggle under the covers with mom while  <br/>
watching a favorite movie could be just the ticket.<br/>
<br/>
But your fears of TV might read into that as using TV as a panacea to  <br/>
all problems. No, the goal is to look at the child and help the child  <br/>
get what he wants and needs, not to look for a solution to paste onto  <br/>
any problem that comes along.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Let&#39;s say<br/>

&gt; emotionally eating begins..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think it&#39;s helpful to see an over all pattern rather than to  <br/>
see one instance as the beginning of the road to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Emotional eating doesn&#39;t come from a cup of hot chocolate drunk after  <br/>
a nightmare. It comes from not having help finding solutions to  <br/>
stress and other problems.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know because I&#39;ve been battling food<br/>
&gt; addiction my whole life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did your mom help you with problems in your life? Did you know to the  <br/>
core of your being that she&#39;d be there to help you and support you  <br/>
without judgement no matter what?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t take this as an attack, I simply would like to know what happens<br/>
&gt; when a confor turns into a potentially self-sabbotageing behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the goal is to help our kids be happy, then it isn&#39;t going to  <br/>
help people move in that direction to keep using a solution that&#39;s  <br/>
only whitewashing the real problem. The goal is to get to the real  <br/>
problem and help kids find solutions that really work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much easier to explain with real problems. Theoretical and made  <br/>
up problems aren&#39;t very illuminating because we can&#39;t dig underneath  <br/>
the behavior to get to the whys. And that&#39;s where the real solutions  <br/>
lie.<br/>

THhose who can afford it (which is quite a few) have their personnal<br/>
drivers to take them where they want. THose who can&#39;t either ride with<br/>
a friend or take a cab. They have the option to go shopping or<br/>
visiting their friends/relatives whenever they want. There are many<br/>
things that a women here could do to pass her time...almost as many<br/>
things as you could do to pass your time. From swimming and working<br/>

reading, They however chose to spend their time passively in front of<br/>
the TV.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But why do you think that is? Same here: women---PEOPLE! here have many <br/>
options. Some choose to sit in front of a tv. Others don&#39;t, even <br/>
thought they have a tv---or several in their homes. People choose the <br/>
*best* option *TO THEM* .<br/>
<br/>
The people who get rid of a tv seem weak to me. A tv CONTROLS your <br/>
life? You have to get RID of a *thing* in order to function? You can&#39;t <br/>
simply turn it off?<br/>
<br/>
Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
As for conforting a child, is it really a good idea to confort a child<br/>
with TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to comfort a child with TV.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that children---and some adults---who don&#39;t get comfort from <br/>
the *right* sources may FIND comfort in TV. If that&#39;s their only <br/>
solace, I have no problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
When I feel crappy, I know that I can lie on the sofa with a cup of tea <br/>
and watch M*A*S*H reruns to my heart&#39;s content. What a warm feeling. <br/>
Takes me back to when I was a teen. Very comforting. Just hearing that <br/>
theme song is soothing.<br/>
<br/>
I can also find that feeling out in the garden. But when it&#39;s 35 <br/>
degrees, I&#39;d rather be inside. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t always choose tv. It&#39;s not <br/>
on now. I have a long, long list of things to do today and tomorrow and <br/>
the next day. Will tv be in it? Maybe. Maybe not. But *I* get to choose <br/>
what I do. And my options are MANY.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely want to know because of the following. Let&#39;s say<br/>
that instead of TV, the child seeks food for confort? This is how<br/>
emotionally eating begins..I know because I&#39;ve been battling food<br/>
addiction my whole life. Will you step in before it becomes a problem<br/>
or let it get out of control? I&#39;d like to know your opinion and the<br/>
unschooling opinion in general regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So---how were *you* comforted as a child? Can you find that comfort now?<br/>
<br/>
Our children&#39;s lives are really not subjected to control or addiction. <br/>
Really. It&#39;s really sweet, and we&#39;re avoiding a lot of this turmoil <br/>
you&#39;ve witnessed by being our children&#39;s partners and supports.<br/>
