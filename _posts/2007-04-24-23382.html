<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811627215">Is anyone currently playing Guild Wars?  My dd (14) has been into WOW <br/>
for 2 years and recently reached level 70, then decided she wanted to <br/>
take a break from it (actually uninstalled it) and has been playing <br/>
Guild Wars instead.  She&#39;s interested in connecting with &quot;real people&quot; <br/>
in the game.<br/>

Let me know if he wants to connect online!   She always enjoyed playing <br/>
with other people she knew in WOW, it makes the game more fun!<br/>
<br/>
She just joined a Guild which is another fun way to play.  I can get <br/>
that info if he wants to join!<br/>
