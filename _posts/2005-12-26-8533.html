<div id="ygrps-yiv-568839594">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know for me I am most peaceful when I am in nature and winter <br/>
time is a<br/>
challenge, when we get cut off from all the wonderful green plants. <br/>
You might<br/>
want to consider filling your spaces with lots of plants, trees in <br/>
pots. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is interesting because Tristan is DEFINITELY the happiest when he <br/>
is outside.  He is almost giddy, no he is giddy when he gets out in <br/>
nature.  He LOVES to hike so, consequently, we do a lot of hiking.  It <br/>
is part of the reason we wanted to get out of Alaska, so we could have <br/>
more of the year to be outside in nice weather.  Thankfully, the <br/>
entire family loves to hike so it is a great thing.  I think these <br/>
explosive children also do much better with lots of physical activity, <br/>
at least that is the case with Tristan.<br/>

<br/>
Jalen too.<br/>
Sierra got him a small scooter for Christmas, and Markus got him a <br/>
bouncy ball (like a hippety hop) that you bounce around on.<br/>
He&#39;s been alternating between the two, crusing through the living <br/>
room, dining room and kitchen in a big circle and occasionally zooming <br/>
up the hallway.<br/>
He&#39;s been in almost constant motion today.<br/>
Next on the list, a mini-trampoline and a swing chair from IKEA.<br/>

I have found this with my older two also. Cimion has bipolar disorder <br/>
(like I posted ) and we just took Shawna off Adderall. (yipee!!!)<br/>
Besides the usual bikes, skateboards, rollerblads & skateboards, we <br/>
have a pogo stick (I highly recommend these!) and big wooden playset <br/>
and we just bought a 14&#39; trampoline. <br/>
