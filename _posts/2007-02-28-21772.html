<div id="ygrps-yiv-583479833">Hi. Although I could go on for days about being new to<br/>
unschooling and past/present problems my son and I<br/>
have; I&#39;ll stick to a question at hand right now. My<br/>
son (12) has been home from public school for 2 years<br/>
now. Although we have tried many different approaches<br/>
to homeschooling, nothing is seeming to work out.<br/>
Finally I threw my hands up and decided to lay off all<br/>
&quot;schoolwork&quot;. I have been TRYING to be more mindful<br/>
and less controling, but this doesn&#39;t always work-my<br/>
hangups obviously. SO, he said to me the other day<br/>
that he thinks we should &quot;get on the ball soon&quot; and<br/>
start doing schoolwork again because he would like to<br/>
go to high school. Ugh. So I complied and gave him 2<br/>
SMALL worksheets to do (easy math and grammar-more<br/>
review than anything) the next week. He avoided them<br/>
like the plague and only did them because we were<br/>
getting ready to leave for the day. So, how should I<br/>
go about preparing my son for high school in 2 years<br/>
if he says he wants to &quot;get ready&quot; but doesn&#39;t? I have<br/>
tried to do real life learning of some things-but as<br/>
soon as he thinks I am &quot;teaching&quot; him something, he<br/>
shows no interest. I just feel like a even comparison<br/>
would be saying that my 5 year old daughter was going<br/>
to start school-at the 4th grade level. How could she<br/>
possibly be ready to do 4th grade work if she can&#39;t<br/>
even read. I know I probably sound like I&#39;m going over<br/>
the edge-but I am new to everything right now. I have<br/>
checked out Sandra Dodd&#39;s site and a few others. Sorry<br/>
this post is so long. :-)  Heather L.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might be helpful to talk with him about why he wants to go to <br/>
high-school if he doesn&#39;t like school work - does he think its <br/>
somehow necessary? If so, I&#39;d look into any messages you might be <br/>
sending that &quot;getting a good education&quot; is important. You may still <br/>
have some issues on that subject yourself, if you are new to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you need to learn more about learning, yourself. I <br/>
have a 13yo stepson who *hates* to read books or instructions and is <br/>
currently mostly nocturnal, so he misses a lot of our real life - <br/>
but he&#39;s still learning things all the time. He also tends to shut <br/>
down if he thinks someone is trying to &quot;teach&quot; him something, but <br/>
he&#39;s very open to learning from life itself. <br/>
<br/>
I have a blog set up for &quot;reporting purposes&quot; if you want to see <br/>
what that looks like (or if you want to see me talk about <br/>
unschooling without *ever* using the word &quot;unschooling&quot; &lt;g&gt;):<br/>

<br/>
The most recent post is the &quot;learning plan&quot; we had to submit, but <br/>
the next few say a lot on the subject of how learning looks for a <br/>
kid who is *very* resitant to any kind of teaching.<br/>
