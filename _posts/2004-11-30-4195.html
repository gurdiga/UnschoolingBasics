 </span></blockquote>Ren, has he ever worked with watercolor pencils?  I have a set of watercolor pencils that I got from Stampin&#39; Up.  They are *fantastic*  I think they were $20 for a set of 24 (not sure on the number, but there are quite a few)  and they are just beautiful.  You can use them like regular colored pencils or you can add water to them after you have drawn to give them a water color effect.  I had a large collection of Prisma pencils that Emily has inherited.  She has used my water color pencils a few times (I&#39;m quite protective of them and my chalks for some odd reason - money) and she loves the way they are soft and blendable.  <br/>

It&#39;s funny how when we give our children good quality the demand good quality for there on out!  <br/>
