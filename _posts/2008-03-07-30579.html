<div id="ygrps-yiv-768254493">I was wondering if Erin would be willing or interested in posting up an  <br/>
intro. She is new - like BRAND new re: unschooling, and is a compassionate,  <br/>
wonderful mom that is just starting to really explore unschooling. She is  <br/>
challenging herself left and right - I&#39;d hate for her newness to get lost in the  <br/>
middle of these discussions. this is SUCH a great list, one that challenges my  <br/>
thinking nearly every day, and I embrace that to no end. I came here ready  and <br/>
in a different place in life, and as a result, I have  had less deschooling to <br/>
do than she. The strong opinions and knowledge here  can be daunting (at <br/>
first) - but also, they can be empowering and thought  provoking. Erin is a <br/>
wonderful mom - someone I have seen with my children and  she puts out energy and <br/>
caring and gentleness like no one I&#39;ve ever seen. But  yes - a schooled way of <br/>
thinking, indeed - and you know I love you, Erin, for  all that you were, are <br/>
and will be :) I hope this post makes some sense...<br/>

Who is grateful for all the outspokenness on this list!!! <br/>
