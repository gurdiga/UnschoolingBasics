I have to agree with you both a bit on that one. I don&#39;t really watch TV too <br/>
often and when I do, it&#39;s hardly ever on Oprah any more. I remember watching <br/>
yrs ago when the LA riots had gone on, one man stood up and made a comment <br/>
about how the riots were like a dejavu (I know I misspelled that one) sort of <br/>
thing and her response was something like, (not sure exactly quote by quote it was <br/>
so long ago)! Yes, history does have a way of repeating itself, the tables <br/>
are just turning around now!, she said it in a tone that sounded almost as if <br/>
she was maybe just a bit, pleased. That really made me question her motives from <br/>
that day on. Maybe she was just upset (it was an awfully upsetting topic) and <br/>
not thinking clearly about what she was saying at the time, I don&#39;t know, but <br/>
it really bothered me. We have a mixed family, and there is a lot of love <br/>
between us all. One time, one of my husbands cousins was about 19 and in college, <br/>
she started becoming more and more angry (she is half black, half white) she <br/>
said &quot;My Dad is just too white&quot; etc. She was becoming more and more angry with <br/>
life and even other family members. My husband told her that it was good to <br/>
stand up for your beliefs and fight for what is right and that he/we admired <br/>
her for that, but when you become what you are fighting against, then you are <br/>
loosing the battle. <br/>
<br/>
*****It&#39;s like she&#39;s saying &quot;Hey, look at me.  Look at all the good things <br/>
I&#39;m doing.&quot;***<br/>
I find myself becoming more and more disgusted by Hollywood folks who come <br/>
out and shine like that myself. (or if I have to hear their political <br/>
views.....does acting make you an expert on politics? Even if I happen to agree with <br/>
them at the time, they still drive me nuts!) When 9/11 took place (and other <br/>
atrocities too!) I got so tired of &quot;hearing&quot; about this &quot;certain&quot; person donating <br/>
such and such amount of cash, it was nice of them, but was it necessary to <br/>
hear about &quot;them&quot; doing all over the news? No, I don&#39;t thinks so. Wouldn&#39;t it <br/>
have been cool to hear &quot;An anonymous person donated such and such to help with <br/>
the 9/11 atrocities, they said no name was necessary&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts, I guess I&#39;m sort of sick of Hollywood these days.<br/>
