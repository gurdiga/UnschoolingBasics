<div id="ygrps-yiv-834681956">&quot;I don&#39;t see weapons as being toys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t either....not real weapons anyway. But we have some very<br/>
realistic looking airsoft guns around here that are toys. If you<br/>
didn&#39;t have the orange tip on them (required for realistic toy<br/>
weapons) it would be hard to tell the difference between the toy and<br/>
the real thing.<br/>
<br/>
We play with toy weapons. My backyard is becoming an airsoft field.<br/>
Jared and John (good friend) have been shooting back there frequently.<br/>
Not only at targets but at each other. Eventually we&#39;ll all have guns<br/>
and play shooting games with them.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are smart. They know the difference between shooting a toy weapon<br/>
(realistic looking or not) and the damage a real weapon can do. My<br/>
children have no desire to harm other human beings with weapons or<br/>
even their hands.<br/>
<br/>
As far as toy weapons for younger kids. I would make the 2y.o. a<br/>
boffer style weapon that won&#39;t hurt anyone if he hits them. A 2y.o.<br/>
just doesn&#39;t have the understanding to use a hurtful toy<br/>
appropriately. Jalen did get wooden swords and such, but I stayed very<br/>
close to him while he had it out.<br/>
<br/>
You can make boffers out of pvc pipe and pipe insulation (wrapped with<br/>
 duct tape) and they can engage in duels safely that way. <br/>
<br/>
OR, make a standing target for him to practice on....so he isn&#39;t<br/>
tempted to use his brother as such.:)  I would still do the dishes and<br/>
whatnot, just have the older one come with you while you are<br/>
distracted. That way, if the 2y.o. tries to hit him with it, the 5y.o.<br/>
is right there near you. That&#39;s only an occasional tool, but when you<br/>
really need to get something done that might help.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve purchased a lot of plastic, wood and real swords over the years.<br/>
They aren&#39;t two forever and it will get easier. In the meantime, just<br/>
find him some things that are ok to hit and redirect him to those.<br/>

to fit inside the noodle - typically, we cut the 6&#39; size noodles in <br/>
half and use 3&#39; lengths of PVC. Leave part of the PVC sticking out for <br/>
a handle (electrical tape the end of the noodle to the handle) and <br/>
tape the other end for a distance of about 6&quot; to reinforce it since <br/>
there&#39;s nothing inside that end - having the end of the noodle be <br/>
hollow also limits the bruising if someone gets hit smack on with it, <br/>
it&#39;ll give slightly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554091258">Ren, you just described our house.  We actually have a shooting range and host skeet shooting gatherings.  All my kids have had weapons training and firearms education.  My 16 dd, has a collection of throwing knives, hatchets, and stars.  My spouse has a collection of blowguns among his other various collections.  We even shoot air balls with airzookas and megazookas (this one is great for the 2yo as he can learn to cock it)  *** My spouse highly reccommends the air and mega zookas****  We have paint balls, airsofts, trapshooting, bows & arrows, crossbows, bow-staffs, to name a few &lt;g, does anyone see a continuation of my spouses playground?&gt;  If it&#39;s a boy toy, we got it (I think).<br/>
 <br/>
The funny thing is that my 8yo ds still has his preferred stick sword and a curved stick that was made into a bow.  Those are still his favorites over all the plastic guns, light sabers, wooden swords, airsofts or real weapons.  Guess weapons isn&#39;t really a big thing here, as they don&#39;t compare to the remote control airplanes, trucks, cars, boats and submarines, etc...<br/>
 <br/>
As for the hitting,  if they hit someone, they lost the toy.  Period.  After awhile, they may get it back.  Very rarely was there a repeat offense.  Airsofts are fun, however being hit in the eye could cost you your sight. Therefore, strict rules are to be followed for everyone&#39;s safety and fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Ren, my spouse loved your idea of the padded weapons.  He will be creating padded jousting sticks with my son for their birthdays!<br/>
I need more storage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149090010">So cool.   I forgot...when my son and nephew were that little, we just gave them both half a noodle for swords.<br/>
That works rather well just by itself.<br/>
(Now you all have my spouse contemplating how to make children&#39;s armour.  He has extensive knowledge of composites and is wondering how he can apply this in a new occupation of childrens custom armour design.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113774868">Wow, you are all so incredibly creative, and it&#39;s not even THAT  <br/>
creative. I must have totally lost my ability to be creative - I&#39;m  <br/>
learning again. When I read the post about the dangerous toys I  <br/>
thought like – there is no solution! What the hell will they answer now!<br/>
<br/>
Protect the stupid swords! Get helmets! Make the kids armours! How  <br/>
easy! How fun! Duh!<br/>
