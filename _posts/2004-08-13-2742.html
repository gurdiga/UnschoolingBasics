<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729386526">Hi friends<br/>
<br/>
Just after I read the Matthew Harre article I read this story from Juls sent<br/>
to another list I&#39;m a member of. For me it shows a wonderful way of<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; on a different level. And I see my child as a kind of Baxter,<br/>
eager to learn and excited to be alive.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun<br/>

from Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>
PS Alexander made contact with a little boy in the UK yesterday. They have<br/>
such a lot of fun exchanging posts and telling each other jokes and asking<br/>
about the respective living conditions. The best unschooled environment I<br/>
can imagine. LOL<br/>

Subject: [Abraham-Hicks] It&#39;s All Good<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last weekend I was hired by a woman to take a dog in to my home who has<br/>
&gt; never lived in a house and train him in proper home etiquette.  She met my<br/>
&gt; rather high price and even though I had disaster images in my mind, I<br/>
&gt; accepted her offer.  THen, over the next couple of hours I had 2 other<br/>
&gt; clients cancel, leaving me mostly free this week to work with him but more<br/>
&gt; than doubling my expected income.  I Love it when things work out that<br/>
way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next day when I went to pick up Baxter I was embroiled in the rescue<br/>
&gt; groups politics, inundated with doom and gloom information about his past<br/>
&gt; behaviors and gave serious consideration to baking out of the deal.  But,<br/>
&gt; then I met him and his grin let me know that it was going to be ok.  He is<br/>
&gt; seriously cute and can bend his tail in three spots, the third bend occurs<br/>
&gt; when he&#39;s figuring something out or otherwise concentrating with all of<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; might.  He&#39;s a border collie/pointer/hound mix as far as I can tell in<br/>
case<br/>
&gt; you want a visual image of him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cordy gave his token growl when we got to the front door and Baxter<br/>
&gt; completely ignored him, walked past him, out the back door and found a<br/>
ball<br/>
&gt; to toss to himself and taunt Cordy with.  As I watched them frolic<br/>
together<br/>
&gt; I decided to blank out everything I&#39;d been told about him and just let him<br/>
&gt; tell me about himself.  Cordy gave me a very rare lick on the cheek as<br/>
soon<br/>
&gt; as I decided to do this so I knew that I was on the right track.  Knowing<br/>
&gt; the environment where he&#39;d just come from I decided to just let him be for<br/>
&gt; the day, got a book and we all stayed out in the backyard together until<br/>
&gt; night fall.  He is way too skinny so I fed him until he decided to stop,<br/>
&gt; which was after 3 large bowls of the dog food that I cook for Cordy.  An<br/>
&gt; impressive amount.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we came inside for the night he hopped on top of the kitchen table,<br/>
&gt; purely out of curiosity as far as I could tell.  I explained that dogs<br/>
&gt; generally don&#39;t climb up on food surfaces and he happily hopped off and<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t gotten on it again.  IN fact he has learned everything from basic<br/>
&gt; manners to how to use a dog door, ride in the car, watch a little league<br/>
&gt; game, etc in one or two repetitions.  He is as smart as Cordy and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; saying quite a lot especially since he&#39;s been living in a field with 50<br/>
&gt; other dogs for the last 18 months of his 2 years on the planet with very<br/>
&gt; limited human interaction and no socialization of any kind.  In the past<br/>
72<br/>
&gt; hours he has learned what takes most dogs many months to learn and is<br/>
&gt; clearly eager for more.  He could teach cats about curiosity and I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what has gotten him in trouble in the past but if you just let him<br/>
&gt; figure out whatever has his attention he&#39;s satisfied and checks it off his<br/>
&gt; list.  I&#39;m finding him to be wonderfully facinating and a whole lot of fun<br/>
&gt; to teach and be around, Cordy agrees and I know this because for the first<br/>
&gt; time ever he moved over to let Baxter share his bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because he has settled in here so easily I have spoken to him every day<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; every night about how this is just a temporary arrangement.  That on<br/>
&gt; Thursday he will either go back to the rescue ranch or into a foster home.<br/>
&gt; Each time he has laid a paw on my cheek, wagged his tail and then licks my<br/>
&gt; nose.  I felt that I wasn&#39;t really getting through to him so I decided to<br/>
&gt; get quiet and speak with him telepathically just to make sure that he<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; understood what was going on.  I did my thing and he about shot out of his<br/>
&gt; skin when he obviously heard me talking with him.  It took some time to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; him to stop licking me and pouncing on me in glee but once he had calmed<br/>
&gt; down I explained it again in great detail.  Once again, he put one paw on<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; cheek, wagged his tail and then licked the end of my nose, but this time I<br/>
&gt; heard him say, &quot;It&#39;s ALL Good.  I&#39;m here now, aren&#39;t I and I&#39;m having a<br/>
&gt; wonderful time.  That&#39;s the important part, what&#39;s happening right now,<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; happens next will happen next but there&#39;s no use worrying about it now, is<br/>
&gt; there?  I always have a wonderful time wherever I am, so don&#39;t worry about<br/>
&gt; me.  I love learning new things and I&#39;ve learned more new things in the<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ve known you than I have in a long time, so I&#39;m happy and now I<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; them for forever so what could be better?  The journey is the fun part.&quot;<br/>
&gt; And then he went to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BUt I&#39;ve been thinking about what he said a lot this evening and it&#39;s so<br/>
&gt; very, very true.  So often in relationships with everything from money to<br/>
&gt; marriages we worry about the future and fearing that the good times will<br/>
end<br/>
&gt; at some point, but that&#39;s really not the point of the excercise.  The<br/>
point<br/>
&gt; is to enjoy your happiness in THIS moment and allow the future to take<br/>
care<br/>
&gt; of itself, and if you&#39;re happy now, then you&#39;ll be even happier later<br/>
&gt; because of LOA. (Law of Attraction)  CJ (Chief Joseph) had said that the<br/>
point Is the journey when I talked<br/>
&gt; with him and  I loved that line so much that I&#39;ve put it on my business<br/>
&gt; t-shirts but I didn&#39;t really get it until I heard Baxter say it.  10 years<br/>
&gt; studying this stuff and the most poignant words come from a rangy mutt who<br/>
&gt; stops off for a week.  I LOVE my life!<br/>

one life who has  broke my heart the worst was an old fellow who was savagely <br/>
abused by an exhusband,then the  woman who owned him first wouldtake him to be <br/>
groomed ,,weekly!!groomers as a whole{there are exceptions}but they are not <br/>
kind ,,especially if the dog is tramatized by someone who should know better...i <br/>
do clip him,but it takes several days and lots of paitence and huggs on my <br/>
part...in the last year and a half,,he has come along,,long way.in trust,,and <br/>
learning to love,,he sleeps with myoldet son now,,,which when we first got <br/>
him,,he was strictly a womans dog,,very protective of me ,,even from the other <br/>
dogs,,,he&#39;scome out  of alot of it ,,but he&#39;ll never forget im afraid...&gt;&gt;June<br/>

Well, as a groomer. I take exception to this, and I also think that unkind  <br/>
groomers are the exception, NOT the rule. <br/>
 <br/>
There are plenty of stupid, mean PEOPLE, and some of them become  groomers.<br/>
 <br/>
Taking several days to groom him yourself is more unkind than finding a  good <br/>
groomer who can do it in an hour.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve had many dogs who are groomed weekly. Most look forward to it.<br/>
 <br/>
Look around. <br/>

,,and should be the exception,,the reason i take a couple of day to grrom him <br/>
,,after several other dogs,,,,is he gets very stressed and any attempt to <br/>
restrain him is met with a nip and bites from him,,,im very gentle with him and yes <br/>
aLL  of mine love howthey feel after it is done...he actually  takes maybe an <br/>
hour-hour and a half total...i didnt mean any disrespect at all...hes such a <br/>
sweet old fellow ,,,i hate to think ofwhat he&#39;s been through at a grown mans <br/>
hand who should have gone to jail for it...&gt;&gt;June<br/>

Knitting? There&#39;s a reason that knitting baby booties is one of the first  <br/>
things new moms start doing! It&#39;s not for the warm baby feet! &lt;G&gt;  It&#39;s to kill <br/>
the boredom those last few weeks! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 Do your boys like musicals?  Get some good ones like Sound of Music, Willy <br/>
Wonka, Wizard of Oz etc.  If you have DVD&#39;s take a look at the special <br/>
features.  We often watch the movie and don&#39;t have time for the special <br/>
features and then forget to watch them.  On some DVD&#39;s the special features <br/>
are longer than the movie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147016333">Oh, I second Willy Wonka! On that note, what about reading aloud to<br/>
the kids? Sam and his dad have been reading the works of Roald Dahl<br/>
together at bedtime for a while now. Or, if your kids are a little<br/>
older, maybe Terry Pratchett books? You could also try your hand at<br/>
making those little hemp jewelry kits they sell in the crafts section<br/>
of some stores. Just a few thoughts. :) Bright blessings to you and<br/>
