<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766415366">I need some ideas for including the little ones, specifically when i<br/>
am reading to, with or discussing a book with odd.  They want to be<br/>
near us, but they are too little to be actually involved (unlike when<br/>
we are doing art or writing or what ever- I can guide them then) but<br/>
when odd really wants to talk about literature I am stuck for some reason-<br/>
any ideas here?  (It could be very obvious- I am 33 weeks Pg with #4<br/>
and ssm to have lost my abillty to think somedays LOL)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can they watch a movie with headphones while y&#39;all sit next to them to <br/>
read? Can you hold the book with one hand and play Candyland or <br/>
something with the other? Or can the 7yo play with the littles while <br/>
you read to all of them?<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;discussing literature&quot; can y&#39;all do that while cleaning or <br/>
doing laundry or something? What do you do when your 7yo wants to chat <br/>
about something *besides* literature? Talking about books doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to be any different than that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20502560">Hi Melynda - I&#39;m 32wks pg with #4 so we have a lot in common.  LOL  I<br/>
miss my brain sooooo much!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
As far as your question goes - we have always included the youngers in<br/>
the conversations around here.  Obviously they&#39;ll interject with<br/>
things that sound like they&#39;re coming from a 3yr old (or whatever) but<br/>
I think it&#39;s important that they listen and feel welcome into the<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
As far as reading stories goes...I typically read different stories<br/>
based on their &#39;level&#39; during the day but DH reads a book to the<br/>
oldest 6.5DS just before bed.  4DD (her bday was today) has been going<br/>
in to listen to the his stories for months.  They&#39;ve read all through<br/>
the Narnia series a couple times, Charlotte&#39;s Web...some smaller books<br/>
here and there and now they&#39;re doing Lord Of The Rings.  She takes a<br/>
couple of quiet toys and listens to the story while she plays.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure that it matters if she catches the story and conversation -<br/>
she&#39;s hearing the rhythm of speech, increasing vocabulary and just<br/>
plain being included, which is probably more important at 3-4yrs than<br/>
comprehension of the story at hand.  She does know that she needs to<br/>
be quiet or she&#39;s not welcome to stay.  She can pick a different story<br/>
for herself but she rarely, if ever, does.  She can tell me more about<br/>
the storyline than I thought she would be able to...and surprises me<br/>
with &quot;what does xxxxx mean?&quot; the next day.  (Of course, to prove me<br/>
wrong as children often do, she just came downstairs in the middle of<br/>
the story with a sad face, &quot;Daddy&#39;s reading the end of the chapter and<br/>
I don&#39;t want to listen to it because I thought there were gonna be bad<br/>
guys to fight but there aren&#39;t any.&quot;  lol)<br/>
<br/>
My youngest will be 2 next month and she is still on her own story<br/>
schedule but I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before she&#39;s welcomed into the<br/>
family story time with the big kids before bedtime.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, those are my .02...from one brain-dead preggo to another.  LOL<br/>
 ;)  <br/>
