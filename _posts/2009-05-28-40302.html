<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525308279">I know the usual question is &#39;so what about Math?&#39; but I need some guidance on this one please.<br/>
DS 13 decided to keep a &#39;Travel Journal&#39; on our recent vacation to a game park. This is something I do, so he thought it would be good to have a book to look back on and remember his vacation. (No coercion, honestly!!) This was his entry on one of the days: <br/>
&quot;didn&#39;en slepe went in the heppo pools sor crocadials we sor cheat and lion sor two water hols they wer dri got to low sardi came bach ladz a round went to a brid hide slept.&quot;<br/>
This boy is 13!! Surely he should be able to communicate better than this in writing? I have made no comments to him about this, but I am worried that he will never learn to write and spell without some input! <br/>
He can read, but does not choose to do so every day. He prefers Asterix to &#39;normal text&#39;. He enjoys being read to, which i do often. <br/>
Any ideas on this for me please?</div>

This was his entry on one of the days: <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>******Who is the journal for?  Is the journal for his own personal use?  I know that when my oldest writes something that is for himself he tends to care much less about spelling and punctuation.  But when he writes something that people will see or in a game on the internet he asks me a lot of questions about spelling and things.    <br/>
<br/>
Have you asked him?  Depending on which of my children, I might just ask them.  &quot;Hey, I really enjoyed reading your journal today, but I had trouble with a few words.  Could you tell me what they are?&quot;  That would be enough for my oldest.  He is very sensitive to me pointing our mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could just ask him if he&#39;d like some assistance with his spelling?  The only word I actually, haven&#39;t been able to figure out is &quot;sardi&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m smiling because you MUST be from the Boston or maybe New York area?  &quot;Sor&quot; for &quot;saw&quot;.  &lt;G&gt;  I can&#39;t remember which, but one of those accents actually SAYS &quot;I sor it&quot;.<br/>

It&#39;s hard to wait for them to have a reason. But when we learn  <br/>
because we need something, we learn far better than we learn when  <br/>
someone else is pushing it in. Wait for him to need it and pull it in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001227029">I had to giggle at this one because my now 17yo dd couldn&#39;t spell (or be bothered to spell, more accurately) until she started IMing and started her own web magazine at 14yo.  Among many other words, I always had to spell &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for her... Even though she had been making her own cards(drawing/writing) and baking cakes (decorating, etc) since she was 3!!!  We laugh now about the **hundreds** of times that I spelled those two words for her (I wrote it out on a big board, but she preferred me to tell her).  Now, *she* tends to get annoyed w/ people who don&#39;t spell properly and I have to gently remind her to be tolerant, they&#39;re just emailing/texting and some people just have a harder time w spelling...<br/>
<br/>
I know that this isn&#39;t exactly on point, but I stumbled across this web site recently and wanted to share.  A man w/ cerebral palsy found his way to communicate/draw beautiful pictures with a typewriter.  I thought it was just incredible..<br/>

My native language is Portuguese. A pretty straight forward spelling language.  Its a hard language to learn because of verbs but not on spelling.<br/>
I was a great student that learned to read by myself early on and that got As on grammar all my life ( in Portuguese ).<br/>
I have re-read some of journals from when I was around that age and I did make many mistakes spelling simple words.<br/>
Maybe a little less or creative than your son but Portuguese is not English!<br/>
I think you are expecting too much of him.<br/>
 My 6 year  old asks for help spelling and he does like to spell correctly.<br/>
He likes me to point it out. Some kids don&#39;t. Have you asked your son?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532771537">My daughter loves to write...and has never been a great speller.  I ask if she&#39;ll read me what she wrote, and then I can hear what she really meant instead of guessing or looking at her writing and saying &quot;what a mess!&quot;.  I always told her--what&#39;s most important is getting your thoughts onto the paper.  You can always fix the spelling later, but if you don&#39;t get your thoughts down, there won&#39;t be anything to fix!<br/>
<br/>
When she was 15, she got a laptop that had automatic spell-check (by underlining in red misspellings), and it within 6 months improved her spelling by 1000%.  She&#39;ll never be a natural speller like some people are, but SO WHAT? She loves to write and share her work, and she writes prolifically and passionately--and how much more important is that to her than being reminded how BAD she is at spelling?<br/>

<br/>
My husband is 42. He has lived in the US for 10 years, and speaks English<br/>
(his 3rd language) totally fluently and with barely an accent. He is a<br/>
successful entrepreneurial businessman (who incidentally never went to<br/>
college and barely graduated high-school). There are no native English<br/>
speakers in his office, so I proof all of the important documents that are<br/>
produced.none the less, he probably send out at least 30-50 un proofed<br/>
emails a day.sometimes he runs them through spell check, but even then does<br/>
not pick up on spell check choosing the wrong version of a spelling/ word.<br/>
When I see his emails my frequent remark is &quot;you actually sent this out???<br/>
To people you do/ want to do business with you???&quot; Regardless, this has<br/>
never seemed to hinder his ability  to earn an income!<br/>
