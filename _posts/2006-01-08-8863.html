<div id="ygrps-yiv-623414960">Ren, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing, and trying to get him to focus on what the issue is that&#39;s causing the problem and not just the outburst.  He just gets upset easily, and I try to remind him to step outside of the frustration and look at the real issues and not just the mess/noise/etc.  It&#39;s just hard for him to keep from getting frustrated quickly when there is a lot of loud noise.  He does try hard, it&#39;s just keeping him on track that these are people and we can talk with them and resolve issues in a small easy way instead of escalating it into a loud power struggle.  But he is catching on, and although he doesn&#39;t always agree with my choices, he does find that after time it&#39;s an improvement.  Right now he&#39;s really not happy with our unschooling choice, but he&#39;s willing to wait and see how it develops.  He knows I will do what suits the kids best.  He does want to be a better, more tolerant parent, he just needs some guidance.  It&#39;s just frustrating sometimes when he looses patience so quickly and yells at them.  But then again I had to grow and evolve too, so I&#39;m sure as he gets used to the concepts he will be able to handle the noise and mess better.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124348699">&quot;He was raised by very strict, borderline abusive<br/>
parents, and he tends to get very loud/angry/negative. I&#39;m working<br/>
with him, trying to get him to come around, but still it&#39;s<br/>
challenging sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to be a buffer. When he starts to get ugly, place yourself between<br/>
him and the children and solve the problem. My dh was never super loud<br/>
or anything, but he is known to get edgy and grumpy about messes. <br/>
Rather than jumping on the kids WITH him, I became their defender. <br/>
I tried to do it in a manner that didn&#39;t put HIM on the defensive...so<br/>
I started helping the kids, being their friend, making sure he knew<br/>
that if he bitched at them it was affecting ME.<br/>
<br/>
He started backing off.<br/>
He still gets grumpy about the household mess at times, but he&#39;s<br/>
really quiet about it usually.:) Most of the time he just cleans up.<br/>
<br/>
The other night, he cleaned up the kitchen after all of us (again) and<br/>
there was this can of refried beans left open. I offer to put it away...<br/>
<br/>
Markus replies &quot;What, you&#39;re just not going to expect anything from<br/>
them?&quot;  &quot;Them&quot; being the kids of course.  I looked at him funny and<br/>
said &quot;how does putting a can of beans away translate into not<br/>
expecting ANYTHING?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, you clean up after them all the time&quot;<br/>
Yes, I do. And they clean up after me, and they clean up after<br/>
themselves and it&#39;s all GOOD honey. Really. I pointed out that Trevor<br/>
had cooked himself a meal, cleaned up the entire thing and left a<br/>
stupid can of beans out and here he is focusing on the beans and NOT<br/>
the ten other cool things Trevor did.<br/>
<br/>
I actually laughed at that point, because he was really just tired and<br/>
being silly.  Jared popped his head into the kitchen and said &quot;DAD,<br/>
it&#39;s a can of BEANS&quot; like he was the silliest man on earth.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t say anything after that.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77815685">And I meant to say welcome to the list Tina, but I got off on a can of<br/>
beans story! :)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you found your way here.<br/>
