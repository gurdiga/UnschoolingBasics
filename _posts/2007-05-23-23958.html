<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834722522">hi, <br/>
 I think steiner is really a powerful thinker that adds a lot to <br/>
challenging assumptions about existence, that said the whole bit <br/>
about brain development and psychology supporting steiner&#39;s veiw is <br/>
a load of... it just isn&#39;t true, the waldorf people pick and choose <br/>
what might support their notions. I am a cerified waldorf class <br/>
teacher . I&#39;ve read a lot of steiner during my immersion , probably <br/>
200 of his 6000 published works, a harah for the free steiner <br/>
l;ending libray , nice system. These ideas really are antithetical <br/>
on the most part to the philoshophy of unschooling. Letting the baby <br/>
cry and stopping breast feeding at 1 , I&#39;m sorry its not connected <br/>
enough about real present relationships and the ability to <br/>
understand and engage at the moment with another human being. It is <br/>
full of dogma and rules, now when i say it I mean the waldorf <br/>
ideology, more than steiner himself. people have taken his ideas and <br/>
formed rigid prescriptions, steiner himself on his death bed felt <br/>
that his whole educational philoshophy was wrong and he would do it <br/>
very differently, ah , death left that as an un 0- elucidated <br/>
statement. steiner felt there should be no formal education till the <br/>
age of 12, and the school was a compromise toward the laws of the <br/>
german govt, but visit a school , it is certainly a better version <br/>
of school, but it borrows so much and doesn&#39;t penetrate to the heart <br/>
of relationship enougjh. this phys ed spatial dynamics is excellent, <br/>
and the art , cool , but it is really way too creul a system, though <br/>
it rests so much on the relationship of the class teacher with the <br/>
students. trust me the waldorf ideas will lead you to a judgemental <br/>
place of right and wrong and not really challenge you to explore the <br/>
relationship, and the true learning from emotional experience that <br/>
unschooling offers to you and your child<br/>
