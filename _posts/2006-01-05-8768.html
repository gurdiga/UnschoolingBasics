That stamping set sounds like a lot of fun! I&#39;m sure for a 3 and 5<br/>
year old, they just wanted to dig in and didn&#39;t really think about<br/>
taking care of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone has already posted this, I haven&#39;t read all  the answers<br/>
yet, but I didn&#39;t realize they were 3 and 5! <br/>
I think I would not have put all the stamp pads out at once. I would<br/>
put all the stamps out and lotsa paper, but probably just give them<br/>
each one pad at a time unless they asked for more.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re too little to keep colors separate, but I might like to keep<br/>
some pads nice for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Let them mix playdough...it&#39;s cheaper and you won&#39;t feel badly if it<br/>
all ends up brown.;) Maybe have some stamp pads just for them and keep<br/>
some separate for everyone else?<br/>
