<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471127255">Hi Everyone, <br/>
  Just a quick question for those of you with older kids....my daughter is 9 and is developing rapidly....she&#39;s gone through a tremendous grorth spurt in the last year ...and with all the hormonal changes have come changes in her skin.  Is anyone aware of good skin care products for young girls...right now, she got oily skin with black heads beginning to develop.  <br/>
  Thanks so much for any suggestions.<br/>
  Peace, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582547180">Costco sells an acne system- soap, toner, and lotion all in one package- that my girls and I use.  It&#39;s in a white bottle with blue and orange color accents.  Forget the name of it, though.  This has worked really well for me and my middle dd.  My oldest has really poor skin though and we had to get a prescription from her doctor.  Right now she uses a prescription benzoyl peroxide lotion, soap, toner, cream, and takes minocycline.  I don&#39;t know if your doctor will give your dd any prescription since she&#39;s only 9, but if the OTC wont work, it&#39;s worth asking.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have a friend with kids in the same situation and both of us and our kids have had NO luch with stirdex or clearasil.  Don&#39;t even waste your money!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Avon has (or had) an acne skin care line that I heard was pretty good.<br/>
 Emily went through this stage a few years ago and we discussed how<br/>
daily cleaning was the key to healthy skin.  That and proper<br/>
moisturizing.  People think that because they have oily skin they<br/>
don&#39;t need to moisturize.  Also drinking plenty of water helps with<br/>
healthy skin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706839989">Don&#39;t know about specifically preteen issues but you might check Mary <br/>
Kay - most of their stuff is hypoallergenic, they have unscented stuff <br/>
if scents are an issue (it is for us), and they do have a range of <br/>
oily skin and blackhead/blemish products that could help. Check out <br/>
their website to investigate products and find someone to get them <br/>
from in your area. The local person will even come out and do <br/>
personalized facials (a mother and daughter event perhaps?). A couple <br/>
of friends of mine are involved in it and it was very low key - I said <br/>
yes to one or two items (a basic moisturizer and cleanser) and no to a <br/>
bunch of other stuff and it was no big deal.<br/>

<br/>
Although I feel waaay too old to still have to deal with this, I <br/>
sometimes still get a blemish.  I have found that using Tea Tree Oil <br/>
really helps.  Have you ever heard of it?  You can find it at Health <br/>
Food/Nutrition shops in a small bottle, but it lasts for a long time.  <br/>
That would be for a specific spot that pops up.  Just dab some on <br/>
before bed for a couple of nights, and it really takes care of it.<br/>
<br/>
They do make some great Tea Tree Oil skin care products, and I&#39;ve <br/>
thought about purchasing an entire set, just haven&#39;t yet.  I did buy <br/>
some Tea Tree Oil soap that I use before bed for overall face washing.<br/>
<br/>
You might do a &quot;Google&quot; search and just enter &quot;Tea Tree Oil Acne&quot; and <br/>
read about Tea Tree Oil&#39;s benefits.  It&#39;s also great for any kind of <br/>
cut, scrape, fungus, etc.  If nothing else, it&#39;s interesting to read <br/>
about (it comes from a tree in Australia).<br/>

types.  All Aubrey OrganicsR products are completely natural, made with<br/>
herbals, essential oils and natural vitamins. No synthetic chemicals of any<br/>
