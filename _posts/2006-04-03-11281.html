<div id="ygrps-yiv-880085926">unschooling is so great!<br/>
<br/>
i looked back in the messages and our intro was #9978....this is just <br/>
a brief update as to how !!!great!!! unschooling has been for our <br/>
family since that point!<br/>
<br/>
well, we have made a decision to be done with the homeschool charter <br/>
program we have been a part of the past couple years. both my husband <br/>
and i feel it to be such a good decision....the philosophy there and <br/>
in our home are just way too different. our dd&#39;s are excited for the <br/>
change.  the last number of weeks have just been so wonderful!!  <br/>
sometimes i feel a bit too  lazy as i think i am missing out on some <br/>
of the things my dd&#39;s would like to explore more about....but i think <br/>
i am deschooling and therefore not providing all the avenues for <br/>
them....but in the same breath....if they are really interested they <br/>
will keep pursuing and asking me....as for right now....the play in <br/>
our home has multiplied 10 fold and there is much more fun, laugher <br/>
and joy!! unschooling causes me to breathe a giant sigh of relief <br/>
often!  i, too, am going to make a list of all the wonderful things <br/>
we are able to do that would be missed if we weren&#39;t unschooling....i <br/>
am so grateful for the relationships we are building as a family and <br/>
for the people my children are becoming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853795490">Hi Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
I am so happy to hear your positive reflections on your unschooling<br/>
experience.  We, too, have been with a charter program for about 5 years now<br/>
and are preparing to leave and start the &quot;unschooling experience.&quot;  I am<br/>
actually a little scared, but excited for the change.  Our educational<br/>
consultant at the charter commented on how much more work it is for the<br/>
parents to unschool, and how difficult it can be with a little one (I have a<br/>
10yo, 8yo, 5yo and 1yo).  I can imagine the liberating feeling of no more<br/>
paperwork pressures and how we can learn by living life and reading classic<br/>
books instead of learning what the state thinks everyone should know at a<br/>
certain age.  I think my kids are looking forward to it, and we are all<br/>
trying to think of a good name for our school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in how you are approaching &quot;deschooling&quot; and how long<br/>
you think it will last.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

such because their sister needs this or that....we are just going <br/>
about life, working together so all needs are met naturally.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i have NO idea how long i think it will last....probably a good long <br/>
time (unfortunately)....daily i hope to trust my children more and <br/>
more. i see things in myself now that i hadn&#39;t even thought of before <br/>
as being a negative...now i can change them for the positive , as <br/>
something that will give my children more respect and dignity as a <br/>
person. as far as my approach....we basically went cold turkey. <br/>
suddenly there wasn&#39;t a difference between the weekend and the <br/>
weekdays. it was cool too (because i love to read and write...it was <br/>
exciting for me to see my children have this interest as well....not <br/>
that i think they *needed* to do this to make this unschooling <br/>
experience cool....) as soon as any pressure was off for reading and <br/>
writing, my children decided to do it on their own....for <br/>
example....&quot;it is so and so&#39;s birthday mom, can i write them a <br/>
birthday card? NO! i will make them a book!&quot; (suddenly writing words <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have even tried writing the week prior....doing it <br/>
because they want to and have the confidence to try and ask for help <br/>
if they want or not to and know that what they create is special <br/>
because it came from their hearts) OR &quot;HAPPY EASTER! HAPPY EASTER! I <br/>
JUST READ HAPPY EASTER!!!&quot; reading a balloon at the grocery <br/>
store....now that built more confidence than an entire early reader <br/>
could have any day!<br/>
<br/>
i am just so happy we found unschooling, found support (even if it is <br/>
cyber support~i do wish i could just pull a bunch of you out of the <br/>
computer and into my home so we could just chat and drink a cup of <br/>
tea...in person!), and found the freedom to learn so naturally.  it <br/>
is definately a journey, so glad to be on it!<br/>
peace, sarah</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s probably right.  I think that unschooling is more work.  Instead of<br/>
telling children what it is that they are going to learn, you end up with 4<br/>
kids who have 4 different things that they want to pursue!  You may find<br/>
yourself suttling and shuffling for a while as your kids enjoy the freedom<br/>
of being able to explore their world.  That doesn&#39;t mean that doing more<br/>
work is a drudgery!  It&#39;s fun and exciting!  I am more energized on days<br/>
that we have full of activities than I am on days when we are sitting back<br/>
relaxing doing &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 I can imagine the liberating feeling of no more<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things.<br/>
<br/>
One, classics aren&#39;t any better or worse than what the state thinks you<br/>
should read.  Classics are just books.  A certain genre of books.  They are<br/>
equal in importance as reading a comic book or the latest manga.  They are<br/>
equal to mysteries, trash romance, and technical manuals.  And reading isn&#39;t<br/>
anymore important as watching a movie, playing a video game, or standing<br/>
outside in the grass wiggling your toes.<br/>
<br/>
Two, why do you need to name your school?  Is this a state requirement?  If<br/>
not, don&#39;t name it.  Just call it life.  That&#39;s what you are doing.  Life.<br/>
Not school.<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in how you are approaching &quot;deschooling&quot; and how long<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you think it will last.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you envision as &quot;deschooling?&quot;  Your whole lives are going to be<br/>
&quot;deschooled&quot; from now on.  Deschooling never ends.  Hopefully you will get<br/>
to a point where you stop thinking about the &quot;educational importance&quot; of a<br/>
certain activity and stop ranking activities by those importances.  Growing<br/>
a garden will be done not to teach about how seeds germinate, to measure<br/>
growth, to teach the importance of organic growing, or any other reasons you<br/>
might think will teach your child a lesson.  Growing a garden will be done<br/>
because someone is interested in some aspect of gradening.  Whether it is<br/>
the joy of growing something or the desire to be able to walk outside and<br/>
pick fresh cherry tomatoes from your own bush.  Now in growing that garden,<br/>
someone may want to keep a chart of how tall their corn is growing.  Not so<br/>
they can learn math, but so that they can see when it is as tall as they<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling never ends if you are embracing an unschooling lifestyle!<br/>

<br/>
Actually they aren&#39;t equal. They are vastly less important if the<br/>
learner is more interested in comic books!!:)<br/>
I understand what Michelle is saying, but wanted to add on.<br/>
<br/>
If the learner enjoys comics, they are of vastly higher importance<br/>
than classics. If the learner enjoys video games, they are of vastly<br/>
higher importance than book reading. What the learner is fascinated<br/>
with, is most important for their journey. We need to trust their<br/>
interest above what we ourselves value, in order for learning<br/>
(ie;unschooling) to unfold in the most optimal manner.<br/>

   <br/>
  Some of today&#39;s &#39;classics&#39; were trash romance in their time.  Dickens wrote serial fiction for newspapers -- work considered way beneath the upper class.  Now schools hail his work as classic.  Much as I love books and reading, I recognized long ago that reading is reading and everything counts.  I don&#39;t care if my kids are reading comic books, illustrated condensed novels, harlequins or cereal boxes -- it&#39;s all reading and I trust that reading anything is part of gaining more info about the world.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are equal to mysteries, trash romance, and technical manuals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And frankly, some of them are just ...well, not very classical.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college - I got a Liberal Arts degree with an emphasis <br/>
on Spanish Literature, which I had long since come to hate but was <br/>
stuck either finishing, or starting over - I was often given essays <br/>
to read which talked about things like the use of time in the novel, <br/>
or the use of voice, with examples from classic books. I had read <br/>
none of those books. And I had no time to read them either, not in <br/>
college. So I was somehow expected to know what the essays meant, <br/>
when I had none of the context I needed.<br/>
<br/>
I made a list of all those &#39;classic&#39; books that seemed so important <br/>
to have read, and after I graduated, I tried to read them all.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe somebody somewhere swoons over &#39;Moby Dick&#39;, &#39;Ulysses&#39;, and the <br/>
unabridged &#39;Robinson Crusoe&#39;, but I am not among that crowd. Ugh.  I <br/>
learned to give up rapidly on a &#39;classic&#39; that put me to sleep in <br/>
three pages, or from which I could read the same paragraph over and <br/>
over without understanding a word of it. And as for &quot;children&#39;s <br/>
classics&quot; like Lorna Doone and Black Beauty, ugh. Even the Newbery <br/>
Award books have changed since the award was first handed out in the <br/>
1920&#39;s. They&#39;re all dark now. They always have to have a moral or a <br/>
lesson or a &#39;purpose&#39; to the story. Do authors and award-givers <br/>
really believe kids don&#39;t see right through it all?  I read every <br/>
one I could get my hands on, through about 1976, when I was in third <br/>
grade. I&#39;m not even interested in the recent winners. So how can I <br/>
recommend them to my own children? &quot;Here, it won an award&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I have found more delight in the pages of Fantasy-writer Patrricia <br/>
Briggs than I ever found in Dickens, or DeFoe. The big difference is <br/>
that her books go out of print rapidly, while theirs persist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling, I&#39;m sorry. We love books here in my house. My kids <br/>
don&#39;t read much yet on their own (at 8, 6, 6 and 2) but they love to <br/>
listen to me read, or to listen to books on tape, and I think that&#39;s <br/>
just as good). We don&#39;t revere books but we live with them - double-<br/>
deep on shelves, piled on the floor, under the beds, laid open <br/>
upside-down on unused surfaces.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s vitally important is to *enjoy* reading as much as <br/>
possible. How many children have had their desire and joy of reading <br/>
snuffed out by &#39;reading assignments&#39;? How many - and this seems <br/>
nearly as bad to me - have been prevented from having time to read <br/>
for pleasure, by being assigned &quot;important&quot; reading they could not <br/>
understand, did not enjoy, and forgot as soon as possible after?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my name is Angela. I have four daughters, and while we <br/>
don&#39;t exactly unschool (I&#39;m too afraid of family reactions among <br/>
other things), we&#39;re closer to that on the continuum than anything <br/>
else I can put a finger on. We live in Bothell, Washington. I&#39;m <br/>
enjoying this list a great deal.<br/>

Seriously, my brother fought with learning to read.  Hated reading the books<br/>
forced on him.  Detested book reports because he couldn&#39;t figure out what he<br/>
was supposed to be getting out of the books. Reading is far too static for<br/>
him.  But my brother has probably seen every movie that has been in the<br/>
theaters this year (save Brokeback Mountain hmph).  He can talk to you day<br/>
and night about movies.  He likes deep movies like the Matrix trilogy and<br/>
Eyes Wide Shut (one of his favorites).  He hated reading LOTR, but loved the<br/>
movies.  He even gets the subtle (and not so subtle) humor in Kenneth<br/>
Brannagh&#39;s Much Ado about Nothing even though he probably could never get<br/>
past &quot;Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more but be thee blythe and bonny!&quot;<br/>
He&#39;d get to &quot;Hey nonny nonny&quot; and be totally lost.   Finding that which you<br/>
love is what is important.  And if that love happens to encompass books then<br/>
great.  And if it doesn&#39;t, great, too!<br/>
