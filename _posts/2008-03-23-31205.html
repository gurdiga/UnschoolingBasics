<div id="ygrps-yiv-486403893">Thank you all for the insight. I feel if you just take a step back and<br/>
really exam the situation you begin to realize that most of the cruddy stuff<br/>
you dish out to your children is old stuff. For me becoming a father puts a<br/>
burden on me to provide for my family, something I didn&#39;t have as a young<br/>
man it was just me. But if I go back further I probably am the only 37 year<br/>
old on this list who&#39;s mother paled water to bathe her kids and wash dishes<br/>
&quot;out house action&quot; until I was three. My mother used to tell me she would<br/>
act like she was cleaning the fridge because we didn&#39;t have much food when<br/>
people would visit. Some of this stuff is fear some ego but a lot of it is<br/>
love for our kids that we just want them to have a better life than we did<br/>
so we have to be conscious not to crush their little souls and if that is<br/>
possible I know in my heart they will be so beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breath step back and love the little rascals<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930903242">Actually, my hubby, 35, was raised homestead style, just as you  <br/>
described. No water, no electricity. Even better, his parents took  <br/>
custody of three cousins when their mother died, in childbirth, so  <br/>
she had six kids under four in a one-bedroom &#39;house&#39; on top of a  <br/>
gorgeous mountain.<br/>

the river, used charcoal for cooking, went to the public bathhouse  <br/>
once a week to get clean. He didn&#39;t see a television set until he was  <br/>
about 12 years old and went to live with his married older sister in  <br/>
the city.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138062170">My hubby grew up for a portion of time on a farm, without TV, limited indoor plumbing (no <br/>
bathroom stuff), milk from the cow, eggs from the chicken, etc.,  farmwork all day.  His idea <br/>
of &#39;hard work&#39; is so much different from mine, as you can imagine!  :)</div>
