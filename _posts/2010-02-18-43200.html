<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813662400">Somewhere I have seen a list of activities that people normally do broken down into &quot;schoolish&quot; subjects.  I have a friend who is looking into unschooling/homeschooling and I thought this might be useful for her in the beginning (and then hopefully she will see learning does happen and begin to be able to trust the process).  Does anyone have that sort of a post saved or know what it was titled so I could look it up in the archieves?  Thanks, Laurie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246020744">Hi Laurie,<br/>
I thought it was great, too! I had it saved under &quot;Homeschool Issues Educationese, but my link no longer exists. I&#39;ll search for it & send it off to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234796733">Could you send it to me, too?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m Annette, from the lovely state of Washington..  I&#39;ve been lurking and learning for a short time, as our plan is to start unschooling &quot;next year&quot; (I&#39;m a middle school teacher -- I&#39;m the one who is going to need the most deschooling!).  My daughter Meagan will be six in May, and so far she has attended Montessori preschool/kindergarten. <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy this group and have learned a ton already. (Thank you to Jenna for bringing me into the fold!)<br/>
<br/>
:) Annette</div>
