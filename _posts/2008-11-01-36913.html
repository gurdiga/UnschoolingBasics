<div id="ygrps-yiv-131289213">Hello I am new to this list and newish to unschooling. I am not very<br/>
good with introductions but here we go.<br/>
<br/>
In our family it is me and my husband and my 2 girls who are 6 and 13<br/>
till January. I am the daughter of a upper level division university<br/>
professor and as such my eldest started her formal education at the<br/>
tender age of 2 when I started my collage education. She started with<br/>
Montessori schools and seemed to be thriving till she turned 6 and<br/>
entered public school where things started to go downhill. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the deplorable social environment of school which had not<br/>
changed since I loathed going to school as a child she excelled<br/>
scoring in the top 90% of that test they like to give every year. She<br/>
was even invited to test into the accelerated program. Only problem<br/>
was the timed math tests. She could not handle them and because of<br/>
this the teacher assigned her to do one every single day which meant<br/>
we spent 3 to 4 hours fighting her to get her to do one 5 min test<br/>
every night. That and the hours of fighting every morning to get her<br/>
to school and I had enough.<br/>
<br/>
Being friends with a homeschooling mom made me think we could do it.<br/>
So when she failed to get into the accelerated program due to the<br/>
timed math I decided it was proof that she had already learned what<br/>
the school could teach her (how to take that yearly test) and it was<br/>
not worth the fights and the tears everyday.  <br/>
<br/>
Its now about 3 years later and we have spent most of that<br/>
deschooling. We did try to do some homeschooling but the eldest just<br/>
wants nothing to do with any kind of school like learning.  <br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting has never seemed to work for them either. At<br/>
least I have been a failure parent in every parenting class I have<br/>
ever been in because I can&#39;t make my family do anything none of the<br/>
techniques seem to work on them and I feel most of it is highly<br/>
manipulative. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway that is a little about us and how we got here.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Happily, unschooling isn&#39;t about manipulation or making your family <br/>
do anything - its not even about tricks and &quot;techniques&quot; really. Or <br/>
perhaps I should say that most of the &quot;techniques&quot; have to do with <br/>
shifting the way *you* think about things ;)<br/>

and now he&#39;s 15. I&#39;m so out of touch with the grade thing these days, <br/>
I honestly have to look it up when I go to file paperwork with the <br/>
state. Anyway, he&#39;s still totally disinterested in anything that <br/>
smacks of schoolish &quot;learning&quot;. For all that, he&#39;s a busy, active <br/>
learner, for sure. We&#39;re currently going through some rounds with his <br/>
bio mom, who still has part custody, who&#39;s concerned he&#39;s &quot;not <br/>
learning anything&quot;. Ray was the first one to pipe up and say &quot;Of <br/>
course I&#39;m learning! I&#39;m learning all the time - its not like school <br/>
where you&#39;re only allowed to learn when everyone finally turns to <br/>
page 375 or something.&quot;<br/>

(she&#39;s 7, now). Over time, as I learned more and more about radical <br/>
unschooling, I discovered that the parts of Montessori that are most <br/>
like unschooling were the parts I (and Mo) liked best anyway. <br/>
The &quot;begin with observation&quot; parts and the &quot;follow the child&quot; parts. <br/>
Those lead right to unschooling - look at what your child is doing, <br/>
likes to do, struggles with, and find ways to support and help <br/>
*without getting in the way*. That&#39;s a common theme in both <br/>
montessori and unschooling. <br/>

wonder what I&#39;m doing ;) Welcome to the list and to unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100159594">Hi ladyslinky,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list. <br/>
<br/>
It sounded like your kid is smart enough to say &quot;enough is enough&quot; <br/>
and refused to play by the rules anymore, other than her own rules. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re very right about your family priorities here. <br/>

<br/>
3 years of deschoooling seems rather long but still possible. Have <br/>
it ever occured to you that you&#39;re already unschooling? The boundary <br/>
between deschooling and unschooling melts somewhere in between. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling is nothing resembling school at all, no scheduled <br/>
learning and no testing. My kid cannot do anything timed anyway, <br/>
including his ps2 games.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our days is pretty much about playing and watching tv and talking <br/>
alot and lots of bedtime stories everynight. This is the preferred <br/>
mode of learning for the moment now. And my son LO......VEs money, <br/>
so lots of spending and counting and negotiating for money.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>
