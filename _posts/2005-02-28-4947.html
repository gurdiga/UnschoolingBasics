Not in my experience.  We have been living an unschooling lifestyle for <br/>
the past two years even though my son could have only started <br/>
kindergarten this past September.  Lots of my friends had their <br/>
children in preschool at age three -- and I&#39;ve heard of people <br/>
enrolling their TWO year olds in &quot;pre-preschool&quot;, but that&#39;s just <br/>
daycare IMO.<br/>
<br/>
For us, unschooling isn&#39;t *only* about not doing school or <br/>
school-at-home.  It also involves a lot of trust and freedom and joyful <br/>
living.  Having said that . . . I say we&#39;ve been unschooling for two <br/>
years because during the time prior to kindergarten enrollment age I <br/>
*could* have been sitting down with my DS and making him do pages in <br/>
Pre-K workbooks, making him write the alphabet, making him sound words <br/>
out, making him do science experiments with me, limiting his TV viewing <br/>
time until after his &quot;homework&quot; was finished, etc.  As it turns out, he <br/>
did (and enjoys) doing all of those things on his own that I could have <br/>
*made* him do for &quot;school&quot; (but we don&#39;t limit TV).  Instead, he <br/>
experiences freedom and joy and fun when he chooses to do each of those <br/>
things and sooooo much more.  :)<br/>

That is so sad! I honestly do not know one person who has had their children in full time daycare since such a young age. Most of my friends were/are SAHM until the kids reach school age when they either continue SAH or get a job. <br/>

My older two were in daycare in infancy -- Will at 9 mos, Andy at 3 mos.  They were both in home daycare.  Will was in preschool at 30 mo, followed by public school.  With Andy I quit work when he was 18 mos old.  He did a short stint -- about 6 mos -- in preschool while I worked at a daycare center when he was 3.  Dan&#39;s never been anywhere but home.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s funny how Andy will talk about his few months in pre-school and tell people he hates school.  His most vivid memory was that another child bit him -- repeatedly.  Andy was that kid&#39;s favorite victim.  His story has been enough to convince Dan that he, too, hates school.  <br/>

I have been debating whether or not to respond to this.<br/>
I finally decided that I will try to.  I consider that my son (9yo) has been unschooled his whole life, though in the beginning I didn&#39;t know that there was a word for it.  He has also been in daycare (a childcare home) since he was 6 weeks old.  I can hear the gasps.  I am a single parent, I have to work (yes, I guess that I could be on welfare, and I did that for a while, but I do find my job rewarding).  I have a job that allows me to work 3 long days a week, so that I still work full-time, but am able to have 4 full free days with my son.   I worked really hard to find a childcare home that is loving and caring, it really has become an extended family.  It is not a school-type situation.  I also try to have my son with family as much as possible, when I work weekends he spends them with his grandma or his uncle.  Not all daycares situations are schooly, and not everyone can be a stay at home mom (or dad).  I don&#39;t find my situation sad at all.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478508445"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;I mean aren&#39;t we really all homeschooling until our children go to <br/>
&gt; public school?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This question came up recently on our local unschooling group too.  <br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote about it:<br/>
<br/>
I  feel that unschooling has begun in our home long before the kids are <br/>
school aged.  My firstborn will be 5 in May and my second is 18 months.  <br/>
I am very much an attachment parent, and when ds was little I was very <br/>
controlling about tv watching and food and so on.  I was in a great AP <br/>
moms group that I met through La Leche (we started the NM breastfeeding <br/>
calendar, if anyone&#39;s seen it).  But, like some of you have experienced, <br/>
as the kids got older all the moms started wanting more and more <br/>
control.  Of the original moms group, three of them now do time-outs <br/>
regularly, one bans all TV and another bans all sugar.  Another mom I <br/>
know who is very AP with her babies actually spanks her older ones!  I <br/>
don&#39;t get it. I stopped doing time outs when ds was 2 but I was still <br/>
trying to control TV and food.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I was doing was actively trying to *teach* him things.  He <br/>
was a very verbal baby and toddler and everyone was going on about how <br/>
intelligent he was so I had a strong impulse to try to make him learn <br/>
stuff.  You know, I&#39;d show him flash cards or try to get him to <br/>
recognize words (being the natural unschooler that he is he totally <br/>
resisted, which only frustrated me because I knew he could do it).  I <br/>
also tried to take him on homeschooling field trips, but he hated those <br/>
too, especially ones where there was an activity to do where he had to <br/>
follow instructions.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the last couple of years I have learned more about radical <br/>
unschooling and I have really come to understand how valuable it is to <br/>
give children control over their own bodies and minds.  I don&#39;t do <br/>
anything &quot;schooly&quot; with him any more and he has much more control over <br/>
his time and what he eats.  So he hasn&#39;t been unschooled all his life, <br/>
but I would say that a definite shift occurred in my parenting when he <br/>
was 2 going on 3.  Perhaps you could say that&#39;s when *I* became an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe other parents already instinctively did this with their kids, so <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have thought to call it unschooling until school age <br/>
came.  But for me, the total respect for children that radical <br/>
unschooling embraces was not something I understood right away.  <br/>
Fortunately for dd, she has benefited from the experience I had with ds <br/>
and she will be, in my mind, unschooled from birth.<br/>

<br/>
No, they aren&#39;t.  The big difference with your situation is that you <br/>
didn&#39;t put your son in daycare with the *intention* of him being <br/>
&quot;educated&quot;, and then to be moved up to being &quot;educated&quot; in Preschool, <br/>
etc.  He needed a caregiver so that you could make a living for the two <br/>
of you.  Very different situation IMO and it&#39;s nothing that you should <br/>
apologize for.  I don&#39;t think that you&#39;ll hear gasps from this group <br/>
with regard to your life situation.   I don&#39;t think that this list <br/>
comes across as &quot;home at all costs&quot;.  Rather, how to make your <br/>
unschooling life possible.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t be defensive!!:) I think you&#39;re an incredibly aware parent, <br/>
finding such a creative solution for allowing your child to stay out <br/>
of school.<br/>
Not everyone has a full-time partner in this adventure. I&#39;m always <br/>
encouraging single parents to look at other options if their <br/>
children don&#39;t want to be in school! I think you&#39;ve found a really <br/>
great one.<br/>
I was fortunate enough to have plenty of support for my 6 month <br/>
stint as a single parent. I know that even if something happened to <br/>
my dh or I, my children could continue their unschooling adventures.<br/>
It&#39;s great to read about single parents making things work.<br/>
<br/>
A close friend here in Pensacola is trying to come up with solutions <br/>
for keeping her dd out of school....she&#39;s asking other homeschooling <br/>
parents to babysit. Right now she&#39;s in a very small daycare <br/>
situation.<br/>
Not all parents with children in school or daycare are part of <br/>
mainstream practices.<br/>
Some of my good friends are huge supporters of unschooling but their <br/>
children have chosen school for right now. Their children don&#39;t have <br/>
all the baggage that most school kids do, because their parents <br/>
counter all that crap. It&#39;s working for them. The children know they <br/>
can come home any time, that grades don&#39;t matter, and that the <br/>
parents will support their interests.<br/>
<br/>
School and daycare don&#39;t have to be horrible for children, it <br/>
depends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015541965">I am on the other end of this...I am the day-care provider for a delightful<br/>
8 year old homeschool girl. Her mom is a single parent....she started coming<br/>
here a little over two years ago, when she became &quot;school age&quot; and her mom<br/>
didn&#39;t want to send her to school.  She works odd hours, usually late<br/>
afternoon into the evening.  She is just a part of what we do each day.  I<br/>
have babysat for families that didn&#39;t &#39;need&#39; to work and I rarely do that<br/>
any more. I much prefer the single parent who is committed to doing what&#39;s<br/>
best for their child. She gets a lot of flack for homeschooling and working<br/>
minimal hours (she works just enough to live on and get insurance) but it<br/>
works great for all of us.  I have a great deal of respect for what she is<br/>
doing.  She is giving her child a gift beyond measure.  And I get to have a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163122475">Thank you all for your words.<br/>
I have always felt very confident about my parenting, my decisions about my son&#39;s education, etc.  But when it comes to more personal issues, I have a lot to work on.  Over the last few years I have really worked on being more mindful, less angry (I was such an angry young person), and less defensive.  I have succeeded wonderfully with the first two!  :-}  I am still working on it though, and I appreciate all of your thoughtfulness.<br/>
<br/>
I have often found parenting sites and lists where I for the most part agreed with the parenting philosophy, only to find that they were very anti- working parent, single parent, daycare, etc, so I ended up getting upset and leaving.  I have come a long way in the area of not letting things get to me, but I do still get defensive sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that many people label daycare, working parents, etc as bad, when really it is the mindset of the parents that they have issues with.  I know some stay-at-home parents who are definitely NOT the kind of loving, compassionate, involved parent that I want to be.  Same with working parents.  I think it bears repeating: It is the mindset of the parents.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your words and support, and for letting me vent in that last email!  <br/>

my opinion.  There are women, however, who have done a crappy job <br/>
raising their kids and can now not stand who they have become so <br/>
they send them to school/daycare all day out of not wanting to deal <br/>
with them.  Either that or the nice car/house is way more important <br/>

my friends were/are SAHM until the kids reach school age when they <br/>
either continue SAH or get a job. &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; I have been debating whether or not to respond to this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(9yo) has been unschooled his whole life, though in the beginning I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that there was a word for it.  He has also been in <br/>
daycare (a childcare home) since he was 6 weeks old.  I can hear the <br/>
gasps.  I am a single parent, I have to work (yes, I guess that I <br/>
could be on welfare, and I did that for a while, but I do find my <br/>
job rewarding).  I have a job that allows me to work 3 long days a <br/>
week, so that I still work full-time, but am able to have 4 full <br/>
free days with my son.   I worked really hard to find a childcare <br/>
home that is loving and caring, it really has become an extended <br/>
family.  It is not a school-type situation.  I also try to have my <br/>
son with family as much as possible, when I work weekends he spends <br/>
them with his grandma or his uncle.  Not all daycares situations are <br/>
schooly, and not everyone can be a stay at home mom (or dad).  I <br/>
don&#39;t find my situation sad at all.  Though I will admit that I may <br/>
be a little defensive.  :~}  <br/>

  I am on the other end of this...I am the day-care provider for a delightful<br/>
  8 year old homeschool girl. Her mom is a single parent....she started coming<br/>
  here a little over two years ago, when she became &quot;school age&quot; and her mom<br/>
  didn&#39;t want to send her to school.  She works odd hours, usually late<br/>
  afternoon into the evening.  She is just a part of what we do each day.  I<br/>
  have babysat for families that didn&#39;t &#39;need&#39; to work and I rarely do that<br/>
  any more. I much prefer the single parent who is committed to doing what&#39;s<br/>
  best for their child. She gets a lot of flack for homeschooling and working<br/>
  minimal hours (she works just enough to live on and get insurance) but it<br/>
  works great for all of us.  I have a great deal of respect for what she is<br/>
  doing.  She is giving her child a gift beyond measure.  And I get to have a<br/>
  little girl around again and my youngest has a playmate...we all benefit.<br/>

Maria,<br/>
I certainly appreciate your feelings about being able to stay home <br/>
with your kids, but you&#39;re not being fair to those of us in totally <br/>
different situations.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the military for over 15 years when, at the age of 36, <br/>
found myself happily and unexpectedly pregnant, (when prior to that <br/>
thinking I would never be).  I chose to put my daughter in daycare, <br/>
part of which was because of my life and bills and debt that had to <br/>
be paid and not being willing to put my family at risk by leaving <br/>
the military, when being so close to retirement with a guaranteed <br/>
income when I retired.  My husband did not make enough money at the <br/>
time to allow us to to change our income status so drastically by my <br/>
staying at home.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is now 12, has had many issues most of her life (which <br/>
would have been there in one way or another with or without <br/>
daycare).  I have been researching homeshooling for the past 2 years <br/>
and found unschooling in the process.  I now realize this is the <br/>
best path for her, she will be out of school (and dreaded middle <br/>
school) at the end of the current year.  <br/>
<br/>
We each make choices for our famiies and children, doing the best we <br/>
can.  I feel I made the best choices possible at the time and given <br/>
the current circumstances.  I take offense to some of your comments, <br/>
but I also accept that you may have limited experience in knowing <br/>
others who&#39;s lifestyles are very different than yours.  I hope you <br/>
will continue to learn and grow in your journey through life and <br/>
learn from those like myself who have made very different choices, <br/>
but care no less deeply, about their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666820069">&quot;HOWEVER, what would a mom do if she<br/>
lost her husband?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or her partner, or decided to be on her own because it was simply <br/>
healthier for herself and her child, or had raised the child on her <br/>
own without a partner from the beginning, or loved her work and <br/>
found a way to minimalize the impact of her time away from the <br/>

<br/>
there are more reasons to have a child in a daycare situation than <br/>
losing a husband. I don&#39;t like the way our society treats <br/>
daycare/school options in regards to children, but there are many <br/>
life choices that might affect a family&#39;s choice in this area.<br/>
<br/>
I also hope that in this discussion, everyone remembers that it&#39;s <br/>
not about you or your choices personally. It&#39;s just a discussion <br/>
about school and daycare in the light of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164677770">Hi, Jann!  My comments were based, like you said, on my experience <br/>
solely.  Thank you for letting me know that there are other <br/>
sitations out there that I might have not considered....<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be VERY biased in this area because of my own situation.  <br/>
My husband is in predental school.  He cannot take on any part time <br/>
job because he basically needs a 4.0 in order to get into UCLA <br/>
dental, his first school choice.  If he doesn&#39;t go to UCLA, he still <br/>
needs a 3.8 in order to apply anywhere anyways.  That means that I <br/>
am the sole provider.  Actually, God is but he is using me to do <br/>
so.  That means that I have to work around my husband&#39;s school <br/>
schedule.  My husband &quot;homeschools&quot; the boys during the day and <br/>
I &quot;homeschool&quot; at night.  Basically, we are both there for our kids <br/>
if a learning opportunity should arise...  Anyways, we do sacrifice <br/>
a house in order to be able to afford to do this.  We live in an <br/>
apartment and drive one older car.  We pay cash for everything in <br/>
order to stay clear of debt and I basically wear the same clothes <br/>
constantly.  We work hard to keep our kids out of school/daycare.    <br/>
<br/>
So as you can see, I&#39;m totally biased!  Don&#39;t take <br/>
offense...really.  It really is someone else&#39;s opinion.  Just have <br/>
peace knowing that you do what God leads you to do and have peace <br/>
knowing that you did the right thing...<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>

Thanks for pointing this out Ren, there are so many different ways to follow our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so lucky that I have been able to find a childcare home that is loving and not school like at all.  My son loves to help with younger children, (one of his current goals is to become a TaeKwonDo instructor), and there are quite a few younger children at the daycare, and for much of the day he is the only &quot;school-age&quot; child.  He helps out with them and because of that gets treated pretty &quot;adult,&quot; which is how I think he should be treated.  They all should, IMO.  BTW, by adult I mean with the same respect that we give adults, I hate that children are often treated as second class citizens.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lurker with an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Its been ages since I&#39;ve responded to the old SAHM vs Working Mom thing, <br/>
but I&#39;m gonna pick up on this because I&#39;ve been thinking about this. <br/>
When ds (13 today) was little I was the &quot;I will NEVER work until my <br/>
child is grown&quot; SAHM who judged why other folks worked and the situation <br/>
they found themselves in.<br/>
Thankfully that woman is gone.<br/>
I now live by the NSNM (never say NEVER motto) which keeps me from <br/>
eating my words.<br/>
Some of those words were:<br/>
&quot;I will NEVER allow my ds to play with guns (swords, violent superhero <br/>
figures, Twisted Oz figures)&quot;<br/>
&quot;I will NEVER allow a (2,3, 4) video game systems in our house&quot;<br/>
I will NEVER work because I like having dsl, a cell phone or support a <br/>
comic book and Ebay habits and dh refuses to pay for my fix&quot;<br/>
&quot;I would NEVER allow my child to make all his own decisions about <br/>
sleeping, eating, clothing, hair length and lack of personal hygiene&quot;<br/>
&quot;I would never let my child just play video games (watch tv, sleep, <br/>
play) all day long&quot;<br/>
&quot;I will NEVER wait tables again&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well the list could go on and on.<br/>
Our lives change and priorities change. I no longer judge working moms <br/>
on why they work.<br/>
I may think that they do not &quot;need&quot; (ie the big house, an SUV, nice <br/>
vacations, lovely clothes...as if I wouldn&#39;t like to afford something <br/>
other then a dbl. wide) to work but there are things we just do not know <br/>
about others nor is it anyone&#39;s job to decide what should be important <br/>
to another family.<br/>
Not that there is anything wrong with offering suggestions on ways to <br/>
come home if a Mom wants to or says &quot;I want to homeschool, but can not <br/>
afford to quit my job&quot; . Well then we have an opening to say &quot;buy a <br/>
cheaper car, loose the dry cleaner bill,  down size your home, quite <br/>
eating out 5 days a week&quot;.<br/>
I now work with gals who&#39;s kids must go into daycare asap (and then <br/>
school)  because they are the breadwinners for a family with either an <br/>
absent father/partner or a worthless (of course my response to that is <br/>
&quot;I can support me and the kids, but I can&#39;t support me, the kids and <br/>
YOU&quot;) one who has no job and sits and watches tv all day....these folks <br/>
have no way to even think about NOT using daycare or the school.<br/>
I also know moms who unschool and have come up with ways for them to be <br/>
able to work and have the kids home.<br/>
Really, no harm intended to the OP, just a different take and what I&#39;ve <br/>
learned in the past 42 years.<br/>
