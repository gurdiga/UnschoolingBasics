<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835077182">&quot;Or do you wake up each morning and ask the kids what<br/>
they want to learn about today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does your husband wake up each morning and ask you what you want to <br/>
learn about? Do you wake up and think &quot;what do I want to learn about <br/>
today?&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t.<br/>
I DO think about all the cool things I&#39;d like to start as projects <br/>
(for myself) and info. I need to look up that has sparked my <br/>
interest at some point, or places I&#39;d like to go.<br/>
So yeah, it has some structure in that we all have things we&#39;d like <br/>
to do.<br/>
But I never, ever say &quot;kids, what do you want to learn about today?&quot;<br/>
They&#39;d look at me like I just dropped in from Mars!:)<br/>
<br/>
I DO ask if they have any place they need to go today, or what they <br/>
want to eat for breakfast.  Kids learn by living...people learn by <br/>
living. So make the living really great today, that&#39;s the key.<br/>
<br/>
Make your lives interesting and rich, not to learn anything, but to <br/>
have a rich and interesting life!  People that lead interesting <br/>
lives, LEARN new stuff all the time. Honest.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the best way to transition. Forget about what they &quot;need&quot; to <br/>
learn and start figuring out what makes you all happy. Maybe today, <br/>
it&#39;s just watching a movie together, cuddling and reading a book or <br/>
baking some bread. Make your home a refuge for all that live there, <br/>
make your days all about good living and the learning will bubble <br/>
and flow constantly.<br/>
<br/>
As to the vetrinarian interest, the best way to squash it is to <br/>
focus on the career aspect right now. What parts does your child <br/>
like about the vet thing? If it&#39;s the animals, start visiting places <br/>
where they can be around animals...pet stores, zoos, aquariums, <br/>
wildlife sanctuaries, breeders, farms, etc....<br/>
<br/>
If my child liked GI Joe, I&#39;d buy them GI Joe stuff...as much as our <br/>
budget would allow anyway.  When you see the whole wide world as a <br/>
big playroom, waiting to be explored, their interests are an excuse <br/>
to explore, not to &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>
