<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978175629">There&#39;s been an increase in membership lately, just want to welcome<br/>
all of our new members. If you&#39;re new to the idea of unschooling,<br/>
please feel free to browse through our &quot;links&quot; section where you&#39;ll<br/>
find websites, blogs and reading all about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you&#39;re new to unschooling or a veteran, welcome to Unschooling<br/>
Basics!<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling the list is going to be somewhat lower volume as many<br/>
prepare to head for Albuquerque in September. For anyone that hasn&#39;t<br/>
heard about the Live and Learn conference, there&#39;s still time to sign<br/>
up. liveandlearnconference.org has all the details.<br/>
