<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720145325">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am still new to this and have a couple of questions.  My first one <br/>
is how do you let go of the anger, frustration and guilt, of leaving <br/>
kids in a public school for so long?  Mine have been bullied  the <br/>
whole time they were in school, and nothing was ever done to stop <br/>
it.  We did go through all of the channels, and nothing <br/>
happened/worked.  My son was going to be in 5th grade this year, and <br/>
my daughter in 4th.  Had I known about the homeschooling earlier, I <br/>
would&#39;ve done it before.  Some people don&#39;t agree with us <br/>
homeschooling-they think my kids should endure all the problems, and <br/>
learn to deal with it.  I and my hubby don&#39;t agree-that&#39;s where the <br/>
frustration comes in.  The anger and guilt is from all of the stuff <br/>
they&#39;ve had to put up with, (guilt), and the other is from having to <br/>
deal with it, going through all of the channels, and banging our <br/>
heads on the wall, when nothing was taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my second question.  I&#39;ve read that the state has <br/>
required &quot;subjects&quot; that the kids are supposed to know.  How do you <br/>
fit that in with &quot;unschooling&quot;, or do you just not worry about it?  <br/>
My idea is to let my kids get excited about learning again, (I think <br/>
it was lost when they were made to learn things they had no interest <br/>
in, in school), and to relax, and enjoy living life.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
them to have any added stress and pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Any/all advice is welcome.  I can use any ideas to get started, <br/>
cheap/free field trips to go on, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also is anyone in the group from South Lyon?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anger about all the things that happened in school?  You are all going<br/>
to have to heal through deschooling and do it together.  My oldest<br/>
daughter went through 2nd grade, but I have very little guilt about<br/>
those three years because she was in such wonderful classrooms with<br/>
&quot;dream teachers.&quot;  (If I had to send my children to school they were<br/>
the kind of teachers I would want them to have!)  My younger two both<br/>
went to kindergarden with some horrible experiences and while I feel<br/>
badly about making those decisions, I can&#39;t hang on to them.  I have<br/>
to release that and chalk it up to &quot;doing the best with what I had<br/>
available to me at the time.&quot;   Dwelling in it will only suck the fun<br/>
out of unschooling.  YOu know what you don&#39;t want, so go towards that<br/>
which you DO want!<br/>

least they will know what the &#39;real world&#39; is like and be able to cope<br/>
with it!&quot;  EEEEEEK!!!  They aren&#39;t learning to &quot;cope with it&quot; they are<br/>
learning to *contribute to it*!  I&#39;m sorry that it took so long for<br/>
you to see homeschooling as an option.  OK, all the guilt you are<br/>
going to get from me.  Now go do something FUN together!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your best bet would be to find an unschooling or relaxed homeschooling<br/>
group (e- or live) in your state or county to help you through your<br/>
state&#39;s maze of rules.  While some states have a &quot;recommended&quot; list of<br/>
subjects to cover, you first have to decipher if you have to document<br/>
it or if it is &quot;something they think would be good to know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your children will be excited about learning, but it may not be<br/>
learning in the way that you have come to accept as &quot;learning.&quot;  It is<br/>
going to look much different from what they did in school!<br/>

<br/>
What state are you in?  Are you required to report to the super/school <br/>
annually? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in MA and we&#39;re required to submit an annual progress report (or <br/>
standardized test OR work samples, our choice, I chose the report).  <br/>
This was our first year, so I just wrote down in a journal things that <br/>
we did.  Then when it came time to write up the report, I went back <br/>
through it and turned the things she did into &quot;educationese&quot;, and <br/>
wrote a paragraph for each school subject.   (and yes, I had to <br/>
get &quot;creative&quot; with some things, especially math!)<br/>
<br/>
In my letter to the super I stated &quot;An annual progress report will be <br/>
submitted upon request&quot;.   I just sent in my letter of intent (LOI) to <br/>
homeschool for this year, and got my &quot;approval&quot; back within a week <br/>
(almost the SAME letter as last year, except the dates were <br/>
changed!).  I did not include the progress report (since I said &quot;upon <br/>
request&quot;), they didn&#39;t request it in their approval for this year, so <br/>
unless they contact me further, I&#39;m just hanging on to it (but it&#39;s <br/>
ready)!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about what they&#39;re &quot;learning&quot; or what they&#39;re supposed to <br/>
know.   Unless you have to report, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Give them time <br/>
to heal and deschool.  My dd was in school through 6th grade, she left <br/>
in June 2005.   She&#39;s still healing, but I see tremendous changes (for <br/>
the better!) by letting her be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Vanessa,<br/>
I have a story similiar to yours. From what I&#39;ve been hearing with <br/>
parents I know, 4th grade truly seems to be the &#39;sink or swim&#39; year. <br/>
Either you fit in and plug along or you don&#39;t and the torture starts <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s 4th grade year was a misery. It still hurts me today to <br/>
recall how he&#39;d have us drag him kicking and screaming to school. Or <br/>
the awful day he ran into the snow in socks so we wouldn&#39;t take him to <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re feeling. I didn&#39;t really consider <br/>
homeschooling as a choice either until the summer after 4th grade. All <br/>
I can tell you as far as healing is deschool, deschool, deschool. My <br/>
oldest is so much happier. He thanks us for taking him out of school. <br/>
He&#39;s so glad not to have to go anymore. Both my school age boys hug us <br/>
and tell us they love us so much more than they ever did. My 11 yr old <br/>
hugs me on a regular basis (and he&#39;s not a hugger typically).<br/>
<br/>
Your children will be so thankful for what you&#39;ve done for them by <br/>
taking them out of school.<br/>
<br/>
I surely don&#39;t have all the answers. We are still trying to find our <br/>
way but at least we are all together and our relationship is strong. <br/>
The biggest thing to me that hurt (beyond my son&#39;s pure suffering) was <br/>
the fact that the school &#39;takes&#39; your child. You don&#39;t know them <br/>
anymore, you don&#39;t see them anymore, they don&#39;t &#39;belong&#39; to you <br/>
anymore. I wasn&#39;t, and still am not, ready to let them go. <br/>
<br/>
What a gift this life is.<br/>
<br/>
Best to you,<br/>
Tonya</div>

  EASY answer to this: would you break a child&#39;s finger each year <br/>
because one day your child might suffer a broken leg? Why wouldn&#39;t he <br/>
need to endure and learn to deal with that too? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 Which state?<br/>
<br/>
  My state (SC) says the kids have to cover the following subjects: <br/>
reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and social studies (notice <br/>
there&#39;s no higher math, history, art, music, or PE &lt;g&gt;)---and in high <br/>
school, reading and writing are changed to literature and composition.<br/>
<br/>
  But basically I don&#39;t worry about it. How can you go through a week <br/>
without &quot;covering&quot; these multiple times???<br/>
<br/>
  You could always say that he kids were in *such* a bad school last <br/>
year that you had to *demote* them grade-wise to cover what they missed <br/>
last year. Then after a couple of years of deschooling (the healing <br/>
process), you could &quot;promote&quot; them ahead. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 You&#39;re the principal, right? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I live in Michigan, where we are a relaxed<br/>
homeschooling state.  Since I am new to this, I wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure if we absolutely had to do these subjects.<br/>
<br/>
The ones that they are saying need to be covered are<br/>
math, reading, english, science, social studies,<br/>
constitution of US of Mi, history present form of<br/>
civil government of the US, the state of MI and the<br/>
political subdivisions and municipalities of the stae<br/>
of MI in high school.  I think that&#39;s alot of stuff<br/>
for them to learn, and things they aren&#39;t interested<br/>
in.  We took them for a tour of the state capitol, and<br/>
my kids were totally bored.  They absolutely hated it.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any ways, thanks for all of your help.  Keep up the<br/>
suggestions, I can use all of them I can get.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the best ways that I have introduced our government to my<br/>
children is by being active in it.  My kids have seen me working on<br/>
different people&#39;s campaigns, making phone calls to registered voters,<br/>
taking an interest in different bills and other pieces of legislation,<br/>
and being an active voice to my elected representatives.  They&#39;ve all<br/>
been with me to vote and have even gone out with me to help at peace<br/>
rallies.  I&#39;m not a 100% all out there gal for politics, but on the<br/>
issues that are important to me I *am* &quot;all out there!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Emily (just 12 at the time) probably knew more about the issues<br/>
surrounding the last US presidential election than many adults who<br/>
actually voted.  She thought it totally unfair that she could<br/>
comprehend the issues but wasn&#39;t allowed to vote, but anyone who was<br/>
over 18 whether they could spell vote or not could.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some great discussions on how laws are made and why it is a<br/>
good thing for the president to not have &quot;supreme power&quot; and checked<br/>
by the other branches of government.  Because they have watched both<br/>
trials and legislation work their way through the process I would bet<br/>
that they understand all those &quot;required subjects&quot; better than<br/>
children who are fed dry boring books!  Why?  Because they are living<br/>
it!<br/>
