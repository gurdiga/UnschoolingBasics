<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006903265">About taekwondo.  Even though it makes me look like an idiot and an evil<br/>
mommy, I thought it might help someone else see what not to do!<br/>
<br/>
Remember how I was saying I make the boys go to taekwondo because they don¹t<br/>
want to quit, so they have to go in between.  Well, since I announced that<br/>
they can choose whether or not to go to taekwondo each class, the following<br/>
has happened.  The 8 yo has decided not to go at all, and wants to quit.  He<br/>
also decided he wants to try youth football and do more gymnastics (he does<br/>
once a week gymnastics and wants to do the Saturday class).<br/>
<br/>
The 13 yo said he didn¹t want to go anymore until his back stopped hurting.<br/>
His back has hurt for a couple months (!!).  I kept saying it was growing<br/>
pains because he grew several inches in the last several months.  But on<br/>
Thursday (the day after he said that) he was running into the house for<br/>
something and that hurt it enough to where he was walking funny the rest of<br/>
the day.  I had been taking him to taekwondo with his back hurting for<br/>
weeks, but I had talked to the teacher and he wasn¹t doing anything<br/>
strenuous that involved his back and was being careful.  Anyway, I took him<br/>
to the dr on Friday, had xrays done, had more xrays done Tuesday, and am<br/>
taking him to an orthopedist next week.  They are not entirely sure what is<br/>
wrong yet, but they said absolutely no taekwondo.  So far he plans to return<br/>
to taekwondo when his back is better.  We¹ll see if he still feels that way<br/>
then :)<br/>
<br/>
Our evenings have been quite different!  Monday, Wednesday and Friday<br/>
evenings at taekwondo was a way of life for 5 years!  Now I find myself with<br/>
some relaxing evenings at home; what a concept!<br/>
