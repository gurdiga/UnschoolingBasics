<div><strong><font face="Andy" color="#ff00ff" size="4">Hi everyone my name is Debbie. 
I live in Port Huron, Michigan. I am 38 and will be married to dh for 19 years 
this july.&nbsp; We have one dd who is graduating in a week and 1/2 from public 
schools. I homeschool my two boys 14 and 9.&nbsp; We brought the oldest home 
during his 6th grade year and this is the 9yr olds first year home schooling (at 
his request but was planning on bringing him home this next year but he wanted 
it sooner). I have aways been interested in unschooling and dh is very for it 
(what we think in our heads is unschooling) but we still have a bit of 
deschooling to do ourselves.&nbsp; I still find myself saying I need to get this 
math book or this spelling book or history book. Then of course there were days 
that I felt bad that I was failing them when I was either too busy to get 
lessons together ect and i felt I was&nbsp; bad mom and teacher for them because 
they did not do &quot;enough&quot; schooling for the day. Since day one of bringing home 
the oldest and after reading many books, I formed the opinnion that there were 
many things that the &quot;schooled children&quot; were being forced to learn and of that 
stuff what did we remember today. And when and if we, &nbsp;today, &nbsp;want to 
know something we research it, whether it is from library sources or the 
internet or calling those who are experts in that particular field. I believe if 
I teach my children how to find those resources that they will do fine in the 
future with anything they do in thier lives, but then I am back at beating 
myself up again that they need to use a math book lol Like I said &quot;I&quot; have to 
deschool myself. </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Andy" color="#ff00ff" size="4">&nbsp; I am here hoping you 
all will be able to guide me with your wisdom and experiences of your 
unschooing&nbsp;experiences so that I will be able to let&nbsp;go and be one of 
you. </font></strong></div>
