his reading and math skills like 2 levels. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does wonders for kids who do not easily fit in to the round holes at school.  My son would also be diagnosed ADHD/LD if he were in school.  He went to Kindergarten for 3 months and they were already &quot;concerned&quot;.  It took Zach 2 years of being at home for him to let me read him a book after being made to feel stupid at school.<br/>
<br/>
Zach continues to really, really struggle with reading and math equations, done in the context of his 4-H projects.  The big difference is in how he feels about it and himself.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is just one thing of many he does.  He has improved greatly with nothing more than practice (he likes to read to me while I rub his back).  He knows he doesn&#39;t do it very well...but he also has time to pursue the things he really is good at, such as baseball and shooting skeet.  It helps to give him a balance.  His entire day isn&#39;t rapped up in something that is just hard for him.<br/>

happy, instead of &quot;successful&quot;?  If you homeschool<br/>
using a curriculum, assingments, other things your son<br/>
is not interested in, he will have the same results<br/>
but it will be *you* he is disappointing, not his<br/>
teacher.  Is that what you want for him?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the great thing about unschooling--there are no<br/>
levels to be behind.  Your son can do what makes him<br/>
happy instead of what he hates.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know that many people who unschool have found that<br/>
words like &quot;ADD&quot; and &quot;dyslexia&quot; are meaningless when<br/>
they incorporate unschooling into their lives.  These<br/>
are terms only used when trying to fit your child into<br/>
the cookie-cutter &quot;student&quot; mold in schools, and you<br/>
and your child can be above that and never look back. <br/>
Good luck with the adventure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101731322">I haven&#39;t read it, but I came across a book that may be of service to you I think it was called Upside Down Learners. I found it at a Barnes and Noble.<br/>
<br/>
I think ADD, HD, LD&#39;s labels are crazy!!!!! Why is he ADHD? Because he can&#39;t sit in a desk and stare at a dead book for hours without being restless? And then we put them on a controlled substance? A controlled substance?!?!?!? As in morphine is a controlled substance. <br/>
<br/>
LD I think is diagnost(can&#39;t spell that well) way to early.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to come across too strong. I would strongly suggest that you do some research for yourself in that area. <br/>
<br/>
To me it seems the unshooling vs homeschooling would half to lie in what works best for your family. Some kids love the structure of doing a certain thing a certain way at a certain time. Others need the freedom to explore the world at their own pace and in their own way. <br/>
<br/>
I know a family who&#39;s daughter exhibited &quot;ADD&quot; attributes but they felt most comfortable with a curriculm, (not that I agree with using a curriculm) but..... the mom would do things like give her spelling test while dd was jumping on the trampoline or history lessons while walking the dogs etc....<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367429151">You may wish to join the yahoo group Shining with Unschooling.  We  discuss <br/>
how we can help our children that would be diagnosed and labeled, etc.  be <br/>
themselves.<br/>
 <br/>
If my son was in school, we would be going down the same road as you, LD&#39;s,  <br/>
special ed., ADHD.  Most of those issues disappear with unschooling, but  <br/>
there are some challenges that keep a child from learning what he wants to  learn. <br/>
 We are a chatty but very supportive group!  <br/>

Here is a bit of the description:<br/>
Allow Your *Non-Typical* Child to SHINE with Unschooling!  <br/>
I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that unschooling does nothing less  <br/>
than save the lives of non-typical children.  <br/>
This list is a discussion/support/connection forum for the parents of  <br/>
non-typical children (out-of-sync, highly sensitive, Asperger&#39;s, explosive,  etc...) <br/>
who are either unschooling or who want to learn more about unschooling.  <br/>
Hope to see you over there! <br/>
