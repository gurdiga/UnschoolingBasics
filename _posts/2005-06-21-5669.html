<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036447898">Hi There,<br/>
 <br/>
Just thought I would mention this movie - my husband and I first saw it<br/>
about 3 years ago and thought it was pretty amazing... even the way the<br/>
movie has been ptu together (animation on the top of digitally shot scenes)<br/>
is cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway - someone just gifted us the DVD, and so it was brought to mind<br/>
again. Great if your teen is into philosophy and deep thoughts!  Available<br/>
at your nearest video store.<br/>
 <br/>
Regards,  <br/>

PS:  Here&#39;s a review:<br/>
 <br/>
More than food for thought, Waking Life is a philosophical and visual<br/>
banquet for the mind. From scenes of immolation, floating and tango, to<br/>
micro-waved burritos and existentialism, Linklater has created a provocative<br/>
film. <br/>
<br/>
We first encounter a boy who floats into the sky unless he holds onto<br/>
something to keep him grounded. In his adult life (played by Wiley Wiggins),<br/>
we follow him as he moves in a dreamland from person to person in various<br/>
scenarios, having never lost his sense of drifting skyward. Early in the<br/>
film he&#39;s in an accident and while part of his time and ours is spent<br/>
wondering if the reason he can&#39;t wake up is because he&#39;s in a coma and<br/>
nearing death, most of the film is purely enjoying the visuals and<br/>
listening. Typical plot questions are secondary to the exchange of ideas.<br/>
Various conversations and monologues about known, personal and questionable<br/>
philosophies (many about dreaming and that time before we wake) take shape.<br/>
A much-needed dose of existentialism colors the rants, raves, and<br/>
ruminations of a unique cast of characters. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Linklater digitally shot the film and used a modern version of<br/>
rotoscoping-in laymen&#39;s terms creating animation from live action by way of<br/>
tracing. The film was then colored using computer software to create layers<br/>
of color. The effect is beautiful: impressionism, solarization, by the<br/>
numbers cartoon-like, eerily human. The images have a dreamlike quality<br/>
unlike anything that&#39;s ever been seen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Existentialist philosophy permeates throughout the film. If it&#39;s the belief<br/>
that &quot;people have absolute freedom of choice and that the universe is<br/>
absurd, with an emphasis on the phenomena of alienation and anxiety&quot;,<br/>
Wiggins embodies it and shows that it&#39;s a hopeful philosophy. As he visits<br/>
over 20 people, some who see him, some who don&#39;t, all offer him a bone to<br/>
chew on their way of thinking. Particularly refreshing about the film is<br/>
that so many different ideas are offered without shoving anything down the<br/>
throat or sounding overly pretentious. <br/>

Like a dream, the film fluidly moves from idea to idea or scene to scene<br/>
without much explanation but with the implicit acceptance that the state of<br/>
dreaming allows what reality does not. Watching Julie Delpy and Ethan<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.plume-noire.com/cinema/critiques/trainingday.html">http://www.plume-noire.com/cinema/critiques/trainingday.html</a>&gt; Hawke<br/>
reunited and bedroom philosophizing in one scene and then watching two men<br/>
shoot each other in a bar while discussing the merits of no gun control (&quot;A<br/>
well-armed populace is the best defense against tyranny.&quot;) necessitates a<br/>
suspension of reality. Steven<br/>

appears, as does director Richard Linklater (as a pinball wizard philospher<br/>
no less).  I might also add it was enjoyable to watch something basically<br/>
free of crude product placements or a bad soundtrack trying to promote a<br/>
bunch of bands with no real tie in to the film. As for the music in the<br/>
film, what could be better than tango to convey the ultimate reverie? <br/>
<br/>
A somnambulist walking and floating and meeting people satiates a desire to<br/>
see something more than a self-serving gabfest onscreen. A void in film has<br/>
been filled whereby it can and should be used as a forum to discuss culture<br/>
instead of just spouting opinions about current non-events based on popular<br/>
media. <br/>
