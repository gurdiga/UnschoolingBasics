<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m glad.  But  you interpreted the looks to mean a negative thing.  <br/>
<br/>
***Serriously, I have been his parent long enough to do that and I did <br/>
and he shpowed no interest.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool, but what you typed was: &quot;...he has not eaten despite my <br/>
suggestions that maybe he needs to do that...&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t type that you had taken him his favorite food and he had<br/>
declined.   And if you did take his favorite food and he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
stop to eat that&#39;s normal for a person who is in the flow.   Mihaly<br/>
Csikszentihalyi has written about &quot;flow&quot; and you can google him or read a<br/>
blurb about his book at Amazon.  The book is called, (I think)   &quot;Flow:<br/>
The Psychology of Optimal Experience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Mostly I wrote the post not to beliettle him but to illustrate why I <br/>
might be nervious and to see if anyone else ever felt nervious or <br/>
experianced somthing similer.***<br/>
<br/>
You interpreted his focus and actions as abnormal. If his actions had<br/>
been ok with you, if they had seemed normal to you, you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
posted in that way.   That&#39;s ok.  Moms get nervous sometimes.   People<br/>
have tried to help you see that there is nothing wrong with what he did<br/>
and nothing wrong with his interest in origami.   <br/>
<br/>
You chose to see his interest through a critical lens.   That&#39;s easy for<br/>
parents to do.  That&#39;s what most parents do.   What&#39;s not easy is looking<br/>
at ourselves and at why we get nervous if our kids seem not quite as<br/>
mainstream as we imagine other kids to be.  Look at your happy kid and<br/>
see what you can do to enjoy his new found interest *with* him, instead<br/>
of thinking about why he shouldn&#39;t be interested. <br/>
