<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895175889">Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are at the early stages of planning a long term trip to South America.  I would love to visit Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.  Our daughter is 15 months old.  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to post here for several reasons.  I respect all of you for taking this unschooling journey of which we are at the very early stages of.  I&#39;m constantly readings posts, blogs, and after attending a conference it has truly become a passion in itself for me at this point.  We are going through our &quot;deschooling&quot; process and as challenging as it can be at times we are loving it.  <br/>
<br/>
First, I know this is an international post so I would love to meet you and your family if we happen to be in your country.<br/>
<br/>
-Second I thought a lot of you might know of someone in any of these countries and we can use them as a contact/network to get a local inside of how things work.  Do you know of any organizations or people that have worked or volunteer in these countries?<br/>
<br/>
-Third we will be away from our comfort zone and I do want to keep uschooling &quot;deschooling&quot; ourselves and our daughter and by us being away we&#39;ll need tons of support from our unschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
-Fourth I know there are some expatriates here and even tough we are not looking into moving somewhere else &quot;yet&quot;.  I would love to hear your story and how you went about things? and how do you keep unschooling?.<br/>
<br/>
-Fifth, I&#39;d like to get a general idea to see if anyone will be interested in  renting temporarily for various lengths of time e.g. a week, a month our  1 bed apt in NYC.  We live in the borough of Queens and it takes about 20 mnts to get to Manhattan.  We have two sofa beds in the living room.<br/>
<br/>
-As unschoolers I know from the posts I&#39;ve read that many of you do travel here and there and I&#39;d love to hear tips on how to cut down on costs and make it a great experience.<br/>
<br/>
-Last but not least I&#39;d like to just see if anyone would be interested in joining us.  My husband and I are fluent in Spanish.  We have nothing concrete, yet.  But perhaps if anyone is interested in visiting any of these countries we can share the experience or meet there, whatever works for everybody.  Like I said we are at the very early stages of planning our adventure and we are open to suggestions, ideas, warnings.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529478111">Fernanda, vivo en Colombia, en pueblo muy cerca a Bogotá llamado Cajicá. Sería lindísimo conocerte a tí y a tu familia si van a estar en Bogotá. En Colombia el homeschooling es un movimiento que apenas se está dando a conocer, por eso no somos tantos como para poder agruparnos por metodologías, y por eso no tenemos un grupo de &quot;unschoolers&quot;, pero hemos formado un grupo de familias que estarían felices de conocerlos.<br/>
<br/>
Espero que podamos encontrarnos!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119285211">Gracias Ana Paulina,<br/>
<br/>
Que emocion saber que hay un movimiento de &quot;homeschooling&quot;, la familia de mi esposo vive en Cali so de seguro que si vamos para Colombia pasamos por Bogota.  Todavia no sabemos cuando vamos a ir pero nos encantaria conocerlos.  Si de pronto cualquiera de las familias por alguna razon visita NYC por favor contactarnos para conocerlos.<br/>
<br/>
Gracias por responder y nos mantendremos en contacto.  <br/>
<br/>
