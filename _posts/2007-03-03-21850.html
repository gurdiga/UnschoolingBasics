<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943035781">How do others handle it when a child requests something to eat... and then doesn&#39;t eat it but wants something different a little while later?<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo has been doing this quite a bit recently.  This afternoon, he asked for raisins and a peanut-butter apple.  Ate the raisins, decided he didn&#39;t want the apple (already prepared, and pb apple doesn&#39;t look so appetizing if you save it for long) but asked for a peanut-butter rice cake instead.  What I did was to point out that I wasn&#39;t comfortable wasting food, encouraged him to have the apple instead, but when he really only wanted the rice-cake I did give it to him.  I also suggested that when he asks for food, I would ask him to stop and really listen to his tummy and see if he really wanted it.  He thought that was a good idea, but mainly, it appeared to me, because it coincided with my giving him the rice cake:-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, wondering how others would have handled this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Bite my tongue and put away the first food, giving them the second<br/>

It&#39;s all part of their learning experiences. Think about what a<br/>

the food isn&#39;t being &quot;wasted&quot; at all...just used for learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, I would trust that he would learn all the important stuff he <br/>
needs to know from living a joyful life with his honest, loving <br/>
adviser by his side (that&#39;s you).  In other words, I would trust that <br/>
he will, when he is ready to, make the connections about everything <br/>
(including the folly of wasting food).  Until then, I have found it <br/>
to be very freeing to look at all the consumable resources (like <br/>
food, toilet paper, tape) as tools through which my son learns about <br/>
himself and his world.  So what if an entire roll of toilet paper <br/>
goes to some other purpose than wiping butts?  Or, a whole jar of <br/>
mustard gets used in some inedible concoction during an <br/>
&quot;experiment&quot;?  Or any other resource, for that matter?  I just go out <br/>
and buy another, and chalk it up to this joyful, unschooling life!<br/>
<br/>
I highly doubt my son will be an adult who &quot;wastes&quot; food creating <br/>
weird experiments or uses up a whole roll of scotch tape making some <br/>
weird sculpture, but I bet he&#39;ll turn a benevolent eye on *his* child <br/>
when my grandchild wants to experiment with food or tastes something <br/>
and doesn&#39;t end up eating it or takes a new roll of paper towels <br/>
outside and tries to sop up the mud in the driveway with it just to <br/>
see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that these kinds of messy culinary experiments are exactly <br/>
what we signed up for when we opted for an unschooling life!  And, <br/>
trusting is the key!<br/>
<br/>
(Truth be told, I really had to make a conscious shift in my attitude <br/>
when Liam was about 18 months old before I was able to let that stuff <br/>
go.  Once I did, our lives got infinitely better!!)<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  There are some food items I&#39;d rather not be used for <br/>
experiments, such as quarts of grade B organic maple syrup, either <br/>
&#39;cause they&#39;re so expensive or they&#39;re hard to come by.   Those items <br/>
are out of easy view.  Almost everything else is fair game!<br/>

Do you really think he&#39;ll learn not to waste it, though?~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s not really being &quot;wasted&quot;, he won&#39;t have to learn that!!:;)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, I DO make alternate suggestions when Jalen wants to<br/>
use strawberries (although he did make a strawberry concoction this<br/>
week, I just asked him to be a bit sparing with them) or other<br/>
expensive ingredients. We&#39;re on a tight budget at the moment and I am<br/>
definitely aware of being thrifty.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make issue of food being &quot;wasted&quot; when someone is full...we<br/>
just feed it to someone else or the rat, or save it for later. Food is<br/>
MORE wasted by putting it into a body that doesn&#39;t want it! Oh, and we<br/>
compost, so I don&#39;t feel that anything is ever truly wasted, just used<br/>
differently.:)<br/>
<br/>
Your child has a loving guide to help him discover all kinds of<br/>
information, including information about food. Children don&#39;t have the<br/>
same priorities that adults do, and they shouldn&#39;t! His job is to<br/>
explore the world, not worry about &quot;wasting&quot;. Our job is to help them<br/>
do that with the least coercion possible.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids change their minds a LOT. Try having a lot of ingredients<br/>
prepared and ready so he can pick and choose a concoction at any<br/>
moment (or just snack off a prepared tray).<br/>

If it is a common thing - when he asked for something, I&#39;d suggest  <br/>

&quot;Peanut Butter Apple? Or - do you think you might want PB on  <br/>
something else? Maybe a rice cake? Or a banana?&quot;<br/>

I would support him in thinking a little before the food appears,  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve struggled a bit with this recently since our budget has been <br/>
soooooo tight. Mo&#39;s been wanting to make Krabby Patties, but not eat <br/>
them, so we&#39;ve been looking for alternatives - making them with <br/>
crackers, getting really cheap buns or rolls, cutting bread into <br/>
quarters so we can make &quot;more&quot; with less materials, especially the <br/>
cheese (she doesn&#39;t use meat, just cheese). Sometimes she&#39;ll make <br/>
them with paper or cloth, but she&#39;s really excited by the food <br/>
aspect. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been eating a lot of Krabby Patties - which has meant talking <br/>
with her about making them the way I want to eat them. Sometimes she <br/>
wants to experiment, though, so some end up in the compost.<br/>
<br/>
The other night, right after dinner! she wanted to make a bunch of <br/>
KPs with crackers, but we were really low on cheese and didn&#39;t know <br/>
if there would be money for another couple days. We do okay with <br/>
planning our food-use, but the KP thing sometimes throws a kink in <br/>
the system. We made the mistake of starting out trying to convince <br/>
her to make them with paper - bad idea! the conversation was heading <br/>
south quickly. She started breaking crackers, and I got an idea and <br/>
suggested we play &quot;KaratE&quot; Sandy Cheeks style with the crackers, <br/>
since we could stretch those more easily than the cheese. That was <br/>
perfect, she and I played at whacking the crackers into crumbs and <br/>
then Mo played vacuum-cleaner-dog to suck/lick them off the counter. <br/>
It was hysterical! So a potentially yucky scene turned into a barrel <br/>
of laughs for me and Mo together. <br/>
<br/>
Part of what made it all work out was *me* looking for an underlying <br/>
need, rather than focusing just on what Mo was saying she wanted. <br/>
She wanted to play/experiment with food *and* she wanted to do <br/>
something nice with/for her mom. Once I figured out how to connect <br/>
with those needs, the matter of the KPs fell by the wayside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093638345">I don&#39;t have much problem with kids changing their minds some. There will be some &#39;waste&#39; of food as they learn what they like and how to hear what their bodies need and can hold. But there is a real problem for me with too many changes: it&#39;s too much work. I find that as we are struggling our way toward real freedom for all of us (ds age 7, dd age 10, ds age 13, and me, the middle-aged, tired single parent) that it&#39;s too much work for me to make everything they think of to eat, help all of them with all the ideas they have, model generous cleanup of everything, empathize, play, and work!! No surprise there. Even as I describe it and remember joyful days I can also hear the resentment in my voice. I have had to give myself permission to be tired, to refuse even reasonable requests if I can not say yes without severe stress, to need a break. This is a hard journey for me. I forget to take care of myself and we all suffer. But I know I must model that I am worthy of care<br/>
 also, so sometimes I will reply to a changed food or activity request, &quot; I am not able to do that right now. Go ahead and (get something else to eat, not requiring my help/ get out that paint set, whatever). When I can help I will.&quot; They may pout which is hard on me.  I also have a hard time with fluid bedtimes, and here is why. As a single parent I used to get my much needed private time, to think, read, pay bills, meditate, pray, write, in the middle of the night or very early morning. Now my kids are choosing completely different schedules, so my 13 yo ds wants to stay up until 3:00 am and sleep until noon, while my 7 yo ds gets up at 7 or 8 after falling asleep in our family bed amongst the late-night family reading or video whenever he can. He is sleep deprived, I think but can not sleep late, never could. Then my dd, age 10 , says that the 13 yo gets &#39;private mom time&#39; with me at night and the 7 yo gets it in the morning. Her schedule of preference is to sleep from<br/>
 midnight to 10. She is never awake when the boys aren&#39;t around. And also a challenge: there are no more hours left to fulfill my needs for adult companionship or solitude.  So how do I balance this? How did I get from food to sleep...I guess because I haven&#39;t learned how to balance all this.              From: Katharine Wise &lt;katharinewise@...&gt;<br/>

clean his plate, so he will keep eating until it&#39;s all gone, whether he <br/>
wants it or not, then --ahem-- get sick.  That IS a waste of food, <br/>
because even HE doesn&#39;t get any benefit from it.  (and icky, too) <br/>
I believe it was Erma Bombeck who wrote about fussing over food...then <br/>
realizing that that&#39;s why refrigerators were invinted.  Granted, some <br/>
things don&#39;t wait well, but even then, there&#39;s nearly always something <br/>
you can do...like Ren said, feed it to the rat!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268947706">Depends - I&#39;ll often do smaller portions if I think he wants just a<br/>
taste of something fully prepared to get up again and make more if he<br/>
really loves it. A whole apple is a pretty big thing for a 4 yr old<br/>
tummy.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll also ask DS (he&#39;s almost 9) if he wants a drink of water while I<br/>
get him (whatever) it was - sometimes he was just thirsty but couldn&#39;t<br/>
differentiate it from hungry. Also, sometimes, I&#39;ll ask him to call his<br/>
tastebuds and double check how much of whatever it is they&#39;ve asked for.<br/>
He pretends to dial a cellphone and talk with them - a useful tool when<br/>
he can&#39;t decide what it is he wants to eat also. He&#39;s been known to sit<br/>
at a table in a restaurant, hand to ear, talking to his tastebuds and<br/>
trying to decide what to order. We just wait for him and have the server<br/>
check back in a minute or two.<br/>
 <br/>
Your not comfortable with wasting food right now but you&#39;ll probably way<br/>
less comfortable dealing with food related issues (over eating, under<br/>
eating, etc) later on. At 4 yrs old, the &#39;idea&#39; of a peanut butter<br/>
apples is great but the reality is that it is large and a handful (or<br/>
small packet) of raisins is big enough to be filling for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513902740">When my kids were little and and food waste really upset my husband (now ex) we&#39;d just give the small child an empty plate. If he or she asked for an item we gave about 1or 2 teaspoons. If it was liked they could have more or ask for a different item. If not at least little was wasted. We did not try to get them to eat, just let them see us enjoying it. Little kids really don&#39;t need much food by adult (especially American) standards.   <br/>

Depends - I&#39;ll often do smaller portions if I think he wants just a<br/>
taste of something fully prepared to get up again and make more if he<br/>
really loves it. A whole apple is a pretty big thing for a 4 yr old<br/>
tummy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also ask DS (he&#39;s almost 9) if he wants a drink of water while I<br/>
get him (whatever) it was - sometimes he was just thirsty but couldn&#39;t<br/>
differentiate it from hungry. Also, sometimes, I&#39;ll ask him to call his<br/>
tastebuds and double check how much of whatever it is they&#39;ve asked for.<br/>
He pretends to dial a cellphone and talk with them - a useful tool when<br/>
he can&#39;t decide what it is he wants to eat also. He&#39;s been known to sit<br/>
at a table in a restaurant, hand to ear, talking to his tastebuds and<br/>
trying to decide what to order. We just wait for him and have the server<br/>
check back in a minute or two.<br/>
<br/>
Your not comfortable with wasting food right now but you&#39;ll probably way<br/>
less comfortable dealing with food related issues (over eating, under<br/>
eating, etc) later on. At 4 yrs old, the &#39;idea&#39; of a peanut butter<br/>
apples is great but the reality is that it is large and a handful (or<br/>
small packet) of raisins is big enough to be filling for a while.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With Mo, sometimes she eats &quot;adult size&quot; portions and other times <br/>
hardly anything. It always throws me for a loop for a day or two, I <br/>
get used to dishing up great big quantities and then *poof* suddenly <br/>
she&#39;s eating two bites and she&#39;s done - or the opposite, I get used to <br/>
giving her tiny portions and all of a sudden she wants more, and more, <br/>
and more! I know its related to her growth cycles - too bad there&#39;s no <br/>
advance warning :P<br/>
