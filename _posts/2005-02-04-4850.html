<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184542059">No, I haven&#39;t been snubbing this list, just have problems with my <br/>
ISP.  I can&#39;t respond to the messages from my mail (keep getting <br/>
something about I can&#39;t reply to yahoogroups from my location that I <br/>
need to connect to Bellsouth - and I&#39;m on a Bellsouth DSL line - so <br/>
go figure.  Bellsouth can&#39;t figure it out)  So I went no mail <br/>
thinking I would just read and respond from yahoogroups.  You <br/>
became &quot;out of sight out of mind&quot; because you ended up filing on the <br/>
second page.  Sorry!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a great winter so far.  Keon (my 6yo) has had a store run <br/>
in our house.  It was great fun.  He was stealing our things and <br/>
selling them back to us (at varying prices).  WE even had to <br/>
purchase kleenex from him (at 5¢ a piece).  He made around $5 in 2.5 <br/>
days of business.  Today he is having a &quot;going out of business sale&quot; <br/>
and I think I am going to do a buy out after his sisters have <br/>
finished shopping.  He has enjoyed his whole game of setting up <br/>
shop, having a sale, making transactions and change, writing out <br/>
reciepts in case you want to exchange something (no; he won&#39;t refund <br/>
your money on used kleenex - I tried LOL!), having store hours, <br/>
taking breaks, creating an &quot;employees lounge&quot; (which I&#39;m not allowed <br/>
to be in because I am not an employee) paying his employees (he&#39;s <br/>
been paying his sisters 25¢ a day to keep watch over his store when <br/>
he has taken bathroom breaks and lunch breaks.  I&#39;ve loved watching <br/>
him be so serious in his endeavor.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe now I will remember to check page 2 for messages LOL!<br/>
