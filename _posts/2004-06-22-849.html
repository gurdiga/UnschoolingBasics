 </span></blockquote>******My experiences over the past 20+ years with homeschoolers in <br/>
southern Louisiana show some segregation going on. The homeschoolers <br/>
here shun unschoolers and non-Christians. I was shunned from a <br/>
meeting back when Laurie was a kid, but I was hoping they had opened <br/>
their eyes a bit since then. They won&#39;t even return my phone <br/>
calls...even now. I&#39;ve thought about sneaking into a meeting and <br/>
spreading unschooling propaganda &lt;g&gt; but so far I haven&#39;t found <br/>
anyone who will divulge a time/place for a meeting. I don&#39;t know if <br/>
they&#39;re afraid I&#39;ll make converts or if they feel I have an evil <br/>
message to share. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told repeatedly that if you say you&#39;re homeschooling here, <br/>
people assume you are fanatically Christian and that you think your <br/>
kids are better than theirs. They think you&#39;re in a cult or that <br/>
you&#39;re homeschooling because you fear your child will hear a cuss <br/>
word. To be honest, it appears that IS why some homeschool here.  <br/>
<br/>
One family of homeschoolers teaches strictly from the Bible, no <br/>
other books allowed in the home. (they call themselves unschoolers, <br/>
btw). No television in the home, no friends allowed over unless the <br/>
parents approve them (and the girls are in their late teens) and <br/>
their clothing options are long-sleeve long dark dresses. With 90+ <br/>
degree temps and 100% humidity, that&#39;s cruelty IMO. Well, it&#39;s all <br/>
cruelty, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where uninformed people would think homeschoolers are <br/>
segregated, but like others have said, Nowhere are you more <br/>
segregated than in school. <br/>
<br/>
