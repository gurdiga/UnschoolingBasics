<div id="ygrps-yiv-781606572">We will be visiting Greenville, NC from Aug 22-Sept 17.  We will be visiting grand parents, which we do every year.  My kids have asked if I will try to find them some kids to visit/play with while we are there.  Anyone know some friendly people there?  I lived there for 20 years, but that was 1970-1990.  I don&#39;t know anyone there with kids anymore. I am 47, and the friends whom I stayed in touch with have grown-up kids.  My kids are 8(b), 10(g), and 13(b). Like most homeschooled kids they are used to socializing with people of all ages and both genders.  Hope to hear from someone. Thanks!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You realize the Live and Learn conference will be taking place during<br/>
that  time over in Black Mountain NC?  I know there is a strong<br/>
unschooling group in Asheville, I imagine there are some over in<br/>
Greenville. We&#39;re just over the mountains in TN if you feel like<br/>
traveling some more.:)<br/>
