<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069902307">I would like to know how to handle relatives. We just had a horrible<br/>
experience at my in-laws. It was my ds 5th birthday which he shares<br/>
with his grammy. So we drove up to visit at ds&#39;s request. They were<br/>
horrid, controlling, denying, negating, they were so cruel to my kids.<br/>
My ds cried on his birthday because no one would pay attention to his<br/>
expect to snap at him, or be insulting. Neither his aunts or uncle got<br/>
him a gift, and though he didn&#39;t complain to them noticed and felt<br/>
slighted. He grammy got all the attention and presents. He got yelled<br/>
at for touching the baby (not ours, his cousin) eveb though he was<br/>
doing the same thing as the grown ups. I don&#39;t know what to do. I<br/>
stuck up for him as much as possible but it was ridiculous. I really<br/>
want to say something to all of them but dh doesn&#39;t want me to and I<br/>
want to respect him but I don&#39;t agree. I feel like posing and<br/>
ultimatum about going there again. We have already had issues with<br/>
them and my oldest (10), who is a &quot;step&quot; in their family. They are<br/>
extremely disrespectful to her. They also ignored our new baby! Which<br/>
was part of why we were visiting so they could met her. It really<br/>
sucked for all involved.<br/>
the &quot;good&quot; part is that dh actually noticed! It takes earth shaking<br/>
for that. but he felt impotent to *do* anything. claiming that he has<br/>
no influence over them. it&#39;s a start though. Before he was always<br/>
telling telling dd to &quot;suck it up&quot; and &quot;play the game&quot;. getting mad at<br/>
her for how his parents reacted to her being herself. he wasn&#39;t quite<br/>
supportive to her but he did acknowledge her treatment and wasn&#39;t<br/>
fussing at her.<br/>
unschool for us was easy, it&#39;s these *radical* concepts that are hard to &quot;get&quot;<br/>
<br/>
please help me work through this or refer me to someone who can help,<br/>
as I feel like I have no one to turn to,<br/>

Hi there--<br/>
When I&#39;m in a situation that is disrespectful to my son and it&#39;s a<br/>
situation where we can&#39;t easily leave (at the house of far away<br/>
relatives for a special event, for example), I just hang out with my<br/>
son more and ignore the obnoxious people. Not really ignore, but just<br/>
find other things that interest us. If there&#39;s an interesting backyard<br/>
or unexplored woods or pretty trinkets on the piano we go and explore<br/>
those together. Together is the key to a better day. Together means<br/>
that the relatives won&#39;t worry that my ds will break anything and also<br/>
I am right there to help buffer the cries of &quot;Don&#39;t go in there!&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t touch that!&quot;, &quot;You can&#39;t eat over there!&quot;. It does take me away<br/>
from some of the conversation with adult relatives, but that&#39;s ok with<br/>
me. I don&#39;t much like talking with folks who can&#39;t be nice to kids anyway.<br/>
Me and my partner take turns doing this and visiting with relatives so<br/>
we don&#39;t appear too unsociable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868364468">Yeah, the hardest part for me is dealing with the things I can&#39;t<br/>
change. My boy gets real sad at things like being an only child in a<br/>
sea of friends with extended family nearby. Or dealing with relatives<br/>
he loves, but sometimes they&#39;re rude or unthinking. It&#39;s is hard at<br/>
times. Maybe next year the common birthdays can be celebrated slightly<br/>
differently? <br/>
My ds can bring up old hurts from way long ago. We talk about it,<br/>
sometimes with solutions in mind (for the next time we see someone),<br/>
sometimes I just listen. <br/>
I think you being there for your son is so very helpful in more ways<br/>
than just the situation of the moment. It&#39;s not seen as a great or<br/>
valued thing, but I think the effect of having a mom and dad who care<br/>
and are able to listen is a very powerful and long lasting remedy. (I<br/>
still wish there was a magic pill for hurts like this.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, that is a lot to deal with! Big hugs to your son and to you ~ it&#39;s<br/>
tough to find your family in these situations. I don&#39;t have any words of<br/>
advice, because I&#39;m going through similar issues with in-laws, and am<br/>
reading this thread with interest.<br/>
<br/>
This past holiday was rough for us, too. We visited my parent&#39;s house, which<br/>
was okay. Lately I&#39;ve talked to my mom (via phone calls) a *lot* about<br/>
peaceful parenting and respecting children and she&#39;s been fairly receptive.<br/>
Maybe some of that is starting to sink in because things were better -<br/>
although we did have a disagreement about her making the kids turn off the<br/>
tv upstairs because she felt it was just &quot;junk&quot; (and then she proceeded to<br/>
sit down and watch the news, which I *personally* feel is full of &quot;junk&quot;...<br/>
and being the smart-alec that I am, of course didn&#39;t miss the opportunity to<br/>
point this out and comment on the differences between interests and why it&#39;s<br/>
impossible (and wrong) to decide these things for another person... but this<br/>
went nowhere fast, so I just let it go and apologized to the kids for having<br/>
to shut off the tv... sigh.<br/>
<br/>
However, my in-laws are apparently unapproachable about this stuff from any<br/>
angle - we are making no progress with them because whenever we bring the<br/>
subject up they just fidget &quot;politely&quot; and then change the subject. If a<br/>
real-life instance brings up the opportunity to discuss these things, they<br/>
just ignore our comments/input. It&#39;s frustrating. They strongly prefer to<br/>
avoid conflict, so they don&#39;t disagree with us directly, they just pretend<br/>
we didn&#39;t say anything. Sometimes we feel like we&#39;ve invisible. DH and I<br/>
have looked at each other to confirm that we really did say something out<br/>
loud, since it seems to have gotten silently sucked up into the vacuum of<br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spoken to MIL about not spanking ds and she made a disapproving frown<br/>
but didn&#39;t say anything. I&#39;ve tried to talk to them about lots of things<br/>
that just go unheard, like letting ds go to sleep by himself because he&#39;s<br/>
been a solo sleeper since he was a babe and cannot settle down with other<br/>
people in his space (whereas dd is a family bed sleeper). But they insist on<br/>
trying to lay down with him, and then give up after two hours and complain<br/>
about how little sleep they got all night. I&#39;ve also asked them to give the<br/>
kids their space when we&#39;re visiting, but they seem to think that&#39;s akin to<br/>
ignoring them, so instead they have an in-their-face-every-second style of<br/>
interacting with them ~ and end up complaining about how exhausting the kids<br/>
are. Um... yeah. I think the kids would say the same thing about them!! It&#39;s<br/>
draining!<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago it donned on us that over time we have visited less and<br/>
less often, but not in a conscious effort to do so. It&#39;s just been a natural<br/>
distancing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving with them was really stressful. We were under the impression<br/>
that it was just going to be a small family meal, but when we arrived there<br/>
were several neighbors, friends of theirs, and another family (grandma<br/>
included!) that came with my SIL, which made for a really full, noisy house.<br/>
Ds, who is sensitive to these things and is very spirited in even normal<br/>
circumstances, teetered on the edge of spinning out of control the whole<br/>
evening, which made for a lot of quick work and intervention on our part.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, which kept us both feeling tense, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s<br/>
*very* hard for me to hear my natural mom voice when I&#39;m in the presence of<br/>
my in-laws... it&#39;s difficult to be at my parenting best in their home<br/>
because it is so the opposite of our home. I really struggle to stay in a<br/>
space where I&#39;m patient and kind and can creative problem solve on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
At one point ds was jumping on the couch and when I tried to redirect him to<br/>
something else he moved up to the back of the couch ~ he was giving off<br/>
those &quot;locked in&quot; signals that come just before he explodes in a million<br/>
directions. My FIL said something about how he could get down quietly or get<br/>
down with a burning butt - I  had a big mental cringe and ds cowered, then<br/>
refused to move when I reached for his hand. I was gritting my teeth because<br/>
ds took my FIL&#39;s words to mean that *I* was going to be the spanker. Maybe<br/>
FIL felt he was being helpful, or he thought I didn&#39;t have the situation<br/>
under control so he needed to step in, or maybe it&#39;s &quot;just the way things<br/>
are done&quot; - I don&#39;t know, but it wasn&#39;t cool under any circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I was standing there in a room full of people, feeling really on the spot<br/>
and wishing that ds and I could be far, far away in another galaxy. I ended<br/>
up saying very loudly that he was absolutely *not* going to get a spanking<br/>
(long pause with a reassuring smile)... Could he show me the trainset in the<br/>
other room? So he finally got down and we walked out together and I could<br/>
just *feel* the eyes on us and before our shadows were even around the<br/>
corner the whispering started. UGH!! So frustrating!<br/>
