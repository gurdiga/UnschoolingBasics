<div id="ygrps-yiv-543873558">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just read on the Va Eclectic list that our local news did a piece on <br/>
unschooling.  Here&#39;s the link to the written part of it, but there&#39;s <br/>
also a link on that page to the actual video:  <br/>

<br/>
I really wish they would have shown the kids doing something other than <br/>
sitting at the kitchen table with mom doing what looks like school at <br/>
home.  That really didn&#39;t give a good look at what unschooling is really <br/>
like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went and looked at the video (and the &quot;rant&quot; video that is associated with<br/>
this story) and have to say it does not look like unschooling to me.  Even<br/>
the language that they children and mother used did not seem &quot;unschoolish&quot;<br/>
It sounded very &quot;non-curriculum homeschooling&quot; which is different from<br/>
unschooling.  There were words like, &quot;things that I have to do&quot; and<br/>
&quot;personal tutor.&quot;  I can&#39;t imagine hearing one of my kids or one of Ren&#39;s<br/>
kids refering to us as their &quot;personal tutors.&quot;  She also seemed very<br/>
college-goal oriented for her children.  If this is not really a true<br/>
representation of how this mother unschools I would love to know what all<br/>
they cut out because it felt very un-unschoolish to me.<br/>
<br/>
Also the rant was STUPID.  The whole gist of it was that &quot;nothing should<br/>
come between a child and their education.&quot;  Uh, ok.  Whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905121517">Thanks for the link. You&#39;re right about it not being good at showing <br/>
unschooling but I thought it was a very good homeschooling piece. <br/>
They seemed very relaxed and at ease with each other. <br/>
