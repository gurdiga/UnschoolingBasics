<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782785168">&quot;I would tell her that &quot;behind&quot; and &quot;ahead&quot; are concepts that<br/>
have little meaning outside of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
I am confused as to how she got the idea that high school is something<br/>
to finish? My kids don&#39;t even know what grades they&#39;d be in. I<br/>
understand some people are driven to accomplish certain things, but<br/>
why all the focus on &quot;math&quot; and completing something at a certain age?<br/>
<br/>
Life is a journey. It doesn&#39;t matter one whit if a person learns these<br/>
things ever (if it isn&#39;t something they need for their life at the<br/>
moment)...much less at 13 or 15 or 25.<br/>
<br/>
Why is she focused on math so much and not on doing what she loves to<br/>
do? People don&#39;t naturally focus on some percieved weakness usually,<br/>
when they&#39;re joyfully pursuing their lifes passions.  What does she<br/>
love doing and how can you fuel those interests? Helping her be<br/>
comfortable with the fact that there is NO need to finish anything at<br/>
a certain age, nor is there some body of math knowledge she needs in<br/>
order to pursue learning beyond high school (does she think she needs<br/>
it for college or something?) would be of more help imo.<br/>

<br/>
Which there is NO need to go to college.  If math is an area in which<br/>
she has problems, most likely she is not going to pursue a field of<br/>
interest where math is a priority.  And if she does, then she will<br/>
learn to use math in the context of what she is doing.  As for<br/>
college, many colleges have math classes now called &quot;Math for<br/>
Non-Majors&quot; or &quot;Math for Humanities Majors&quot; or even &quot;Math for the<br/>
Masses.&quot;  These classes review traditional mathematic principles and<br/>
introduce the concept of algebra and how it is used in a &quot;real world&quot;<br/>
sense.  Not just a set of arithmetic problems.  Rarely are any math<br/>
classes needed after that point.  I have a friend who teaches &quot;Math<br/>
for Humanities Majors&quot; at a local community college.  I&#39;ve actually<br/>
thought of taking her class just because she makes it sound so fun!<br/>
She told me that they do a &quot;math project&quot; in her class that can be<br/>
anything you want as long as it involves changing numbers in some<br/>
form.  I asked her if knitting a pair of socks in a different size<br/>
than called for in the pattern counted and she said, &quot;Oh, that would<br/>
be an advanced project!&quot;  :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have always considered myself &quot;weak&quot; in math, but I can<br/>
increase recipes and change knitting patterns with great ease even<br/>
though it can sometimes require great mathematical concepts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977809229">Dear Deb, Ren and Michelle<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice.   For the first time last week she wanted to KNOW what grade she would be in if we did do grades.  How many times have we snuggled and read Teenage Liberation Handbook!  We love it, even Hannah loves it!  But now, for whatever reason she wants to learn more about math.  I know some folks might say, &quot;thats not unschooling, why is she even thinking about graduating, you can&#39;t use text books, etc...&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I say I want to assist my daughter in whatever she feels she would like to pursue, at least look into more, and that includes math.  If she wants a MATH BOOK, what&#39;s the biggie? Is there a problem with a kid WHO WANTS a math book?  If all we&#39;ve done our whole life is lived (cooked, kept track of bank accounts, gardened, repaired our home, you know, real living!!) then I think that is all a kid needs.  If a later time Hannah feels she needs to learn or brush up on a concept for whatever reason, she can do it then.  BUT SHE WANTS TO DO IT NOW and why should I stand in her way?  I don&#39;t need advice on unschooling, I need advice on how to help my daughter with higher math BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO KNOW!<br/>

 <br/>
Shannon, my kids are younger so I don&#39;t have any specific ideas for the  <br/>
higher math, but have you tried looking through some homeschooling resource  <br/>
websites for some programs other than saxon (I think that is what you  said).<br/>
 <br/>
_www.fun-books.com_ (http://www.fun-books.com)   is a  catalog/on-line store <br/>
that is run by a family of unschoolers.  I have  emailed them for advise about <br/>
some of their products and they have always been  helpful.  They carry a <br/>
series called &quot;key to.....(algebra, geometry, etc.)&quot;  that might be helpful for <br/>
your daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
I have also waded through the A to Z Home&#39;s Cool resource page and found  <br/>
some good things here and there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great - take her to the bookstore or library  - there are WHOLE <br/>
SECTIONS of books there. My personal favorites are the Schaum&#39;s <br/>
outline series for math stuff - a few pages (maybe 2 maybe 10 <br/>
depending) introduce a topic, a couple pages show step by step <br/>
worked out examples, a couple pages have exercises (with answers <br/>
given in the back of the book) then it moves on to the next <br/>
topic/chapter. You can do it however you choose - try a few <br/>
exercises, if you&#39;ve got it, move on; if not, go back over it and <br/>
try a few more...<br/>
<br/>
What exactly are you wanting us to tell you? If she wants to learn <br/>
it, find ways for that whether it&#39;s a couple workbooks or a tutor <br/>
from a local university or a community college course or whatever it <br/>
takes. The thing is there is NO difference between her wanting to <br/>
learn &#39;higher math&#39; now and her wanting to learn to bake cookies <br/>
when she was 8 (or whatever). Do exactly the same thing - facilitate <br/>
her interest, her way, her timing, however long she&#39;s interested in <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927212633">In your original post, you said that she was worried about graduating <br/>
from high school, not that she was interested in math.  That&#39;s why you <br/>
got the responses you did.  You said that she wanted to learn it <br/>
because she was upset about being &quot;behind&quot;, and keeping up with the <br/>
average school schedule is not what unschooling is about.  <br/>
<br/>
People here were just wondering why your daughter was worried about <br/>
graduating  because kids may not know that it&#39;s not necessary, <br/>
especially if someone else tells them it is.  So is your daughter <br/>
interested in math or is she concerned that she won&#39;t be a successful <br/>
adult if she doesn&#39;t &quot;catch up&quot; to school kids or is she worried that <br/>
she won&#39;t be able to have a specific career or did someone tell her <br/>
she was stupid?  Or it could be something completely different.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shannon, I think most of us focused not on the fact that she wanted to<br/>
do math but the reason she felt she needed to know math.  If she has<br/>
been unschooled and living a truly free life and embraces the<br/>
philosophy if the Teenage Liberation Handbook, I would question not<br/>
how she should learn math but why she wants to learn it and help her<br/>
through that.  I truly got from your original posts on the matter that<br/>
she is feeling like there is something lacking in her.  Perhaps the<br/>
important thing would be to find her some books and then help her see<br/>
how she doesn&#39;t need those things to &quot;finish&quot; anything.  She isn&#39;t<br/>
unfinished as she is.  Or maybe I should say there is no &quot;finishing&quot;<br/>
that anyone needs to do.  We always evolve, grow, and change as our<br/>
situations do.<br/>
<br/>
(warning:  movie analogy coming up)  In the movie Freaky Friday, the<br/>
mom and daughter switch bodies for the day.  The mom (in the<br/>
daughter&#39;s body) goes to school to take some big placement test.  The<br/>
mom is thinking to herself as she looks at some math questions, &quot;Pi?<br/>
What is pi?  It&#39;s 3.something.  She&#39;s never going to need to know what<br/>
pi is.  *I* have never needed to know pi.  This is really stupid!&quot;<br/>
(paraphrased).  Sometimes I wish that parents could switch bodies with<br/>
their kids for a few days and really look at all that &quot;the system&quot;<br/>
says that they need and see if they truly are applying those things in<br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I really would look more into your daughter&#39;s why&#39;s rather than her<br/>
how&#39;s.  The how&#39;s will find a way if it is something that she truly is<br/>
passionate about.  If it isn&#39;t something that she sees a need for then<br/>
she is never going to understand it fully.  It is going to become a<br/>
painful part of her life, fill her with self doubt (maybe more so than<br/>
she is now), and she still isn&#39;t going to &quot;get math.&quot;<br/>

notation of  math when he or she has no practical application for it and<br/>
no experience with it.   I&#39;m looking for that post or article (I&#39;ve<br/>
forgotten where it appeared)  and haven&#39;t found it yet but maybe she<br/>
saved it and will come along and wow us with it again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
It might help you avoid some things that could potentially frustrate your<br/>
daughter. <br/>
<br/>
***why should I stand in her way? ***<br/>
<br/>
No one was suggesting you stand in her way.  Finding out why she wants to<br/>
do math from a book might help you help her in the best way.  <br/>
Sometimes we think we need  to do one thing in order to get to something<br/>
else we really want.  Say a kid is thinking about being a vet.   A friend<br/>
says &quot;how will you get into college/vet school without a high school<br/>
diploma?&quot;     The kid goes about the business of pursuing a high school<br/>
diploma even though she doesn&#39;t really want that.  What she really wants<br/>
is to know the possibility of getting into college/vet school exists for<br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;But now, for whatever reason...&quot; she wants this.  We&#39;re not<br/>
saying &quot;stand in her way,&quot; we&#39;re saying &quot;find out why.&quot;<br/>
