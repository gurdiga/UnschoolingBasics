<div>Yes! Have alternatives available. But don&#39;t make the Oreo into some forbidden fruit.(OK, if it was a fruit, we wouldn&#39;t be all Mom-like about this and want to forbid it in the first place . . . :) . . . you know what I mean.) </div>

<div>My DS eats his fair share of junk. But, amazingly, for a boy who is a pretty picky eater, if there are celery sticks and strawberries available, he&#39;ll choose those most of the time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And someone mentioned not beating ourselves up -- this is such good advice imo. We are all trying to do our best. We change over time. Our kids change. Allow yourselves the freedom to change without a ritual denigration of former thinking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My 2 cents anyway! :)</div>

I think it&#39;s really important to stop treating some food as junk or bad. Food is just food. <br/>
<br/>
When you continue to attach lables to the food your kids are going to pick up on that. You can smile swwetly and not say anthing as you son or daughter grabs cookies instead of an apple, but if you consider it &quot;junk&quot; and call it &quot;junk&quot; your kids WILL pick up on it and it will continue to be a power/control issue.<br/>
<br/>
Let food just be food.<br/>

<div>Ok, my turn,&nbsp; I have an overweight son.&nbsp;What would be the &quot;right&quot; way to handle this situation, being unschoolers.&nbsp; I do not monitor (or try not too) his food, I do have to remind him to slow down when eating.&nbsp; I stopped buying junk food, but that doesn&#39;t stop the eating. </div>
<div>This has been on my mind for years.&nbsp; I don&#39;t ever want him to think I think less of him for being heavy, and I have always told him how much he is loved no matter what, and that we just want his body to be healthy.</div>
<div>&nbsp; any ideas?</div>
<div>thanks</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386872764">Maybe instead of worrying about the food, try as a<br/>
family to burn more calories....Plan a hiking or<br/>
biking vacation?  Take up ice skating or swimming?  If<br/>
you do enough exercise you will burn up the<br/>
calories....<br/>
