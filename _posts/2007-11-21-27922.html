I recomend thsi game for all ages of playes. It is super fun and you can &quot;help&quot; by playing with a second controler. My ds is only 5 and it is fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843839581">Oh well for the sale. I am not getting up at 3 AM to go to a sale and stand outside when is 17  degrees waiting for the store to open.<br/>
I rather pay $15 dollars more. Anyways we have pre-ordered because MD has been dying to play it for months.<br/>
Hey Count Black was not that hard! But them again MD always did the bosses for me &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
