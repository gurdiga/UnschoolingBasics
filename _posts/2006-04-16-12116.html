<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390761220">I need some attitude help here (MY attitude, of course!).  As I said in a<br/>
post a moment ago, my views on food consumption are pretty loose.  Not 100%<br/>
free yet, this is what I&#39;m working towards.  I&#39;m finding that it is a lot<br/>
easier to let go of my worries with my 6yo than it is with my 2yo.  Almost<br/>
certainly this is because Drew is older and more mature, and is making<br/>
intelligent food choices on his own.  He likes to eat, but it&#39;s not a huge<br/>
part of his life.  So his choices don&#39;t usually go against my personal<br/>
opinions on what a 6yo should eat - makes it a lot easier to let go and<br/>
allow him to make the choices!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then the Universe sent me Josh, who has a love affair with food - much like<br/>
mommy does.  He loves it, it&#39;s a joy to him.  He thinks about it a lot,<br/>
loves to cook, loves to shop, loves everything about it.  This is a good<br/>
thing.  But mommy still has some hangups that I can&#39;t seem to release.  The<br/>
current situation is candy and sweets.  I don&#39;t care that he eats them.  I<br/>
get into trouble about &#39;when&#39; and &#39;how much&#39;.  He wakes in the morning and<br/>
wants gummy worms.  I just can&#39;t seem to say yes to this - I can&#39;t let go of<br/>
the need to feed him something healthy before he has them (he does get them<br/>
in the morning, just not as a first food).  I know this goes against my<br/>
goals, so what is my problem?  I&#39;m worried about 1) overall health and 2)<br/>
his teeth (which are a major problem and expense - not a justification, just<br/>
a reason for my anxiety).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I look at overall food consumption, i.e. weekly, he eats wonderfully.<br/>
Chicken, fish, rice, noodles, broccoli, carrots, apples, grapes, raisins,<br/>
etc.  All healthy food for a growing kiddo.  So why do I still knee-jerk<br/>
&quot;no&quot; when he asks for a chocolate donut and hasn&#39;t eaten his lunch yet?  I<br/>
KNOW he&#39;s going to eat his lunch, or something else later, that is healthy.<br/>
The child certainly will not live on chocolate donuts.  And anyway, the<br/>
donuts aren&#39;t going to last forever, there are only so many in the package.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And so I argue with myself during the day.  What&#39;s my real problem here, and<br/>
how can I start to look at things differently?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something like this happened to me, too. I have an older kid who  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have much of a sweet tooth, so his choices under a free  <br/>
system never set off my alarm bells. Then along came Carl, now just  <br/>
two, who loves sweets. It&#39;s been a challenge for me to step back,  <br/>
breathe deeply, and let him have what he wants--I was saying to my  <br/>
partner one day that if anything, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more important not to  <br/>
limit Carl than not to limit Eric, because with Eric, we could  <br/>
restrict candy and he might not even notice, but with Carl--well, he  <br/>
would notice, and restricting it would make him think about it more  <br/>
and more, and next thing we know, he&#39;d be binging. I have  <br/>
successfully just let Carl have what he wants, and he does stop  <br/>
before he lapses into a sugar coma &lt;g&gt;--he doesn&#39;t even eat as much  <br/>
sugary stuff as I have sometimes been afraid he would. And, like with  <br/>
your son, he has a great diet overall. He&#39;s just been that little bit  <br/>
more challenging to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s our own brain-training that does this--you have to eat  <br/>
&quot;real&quot; food first, you have to earn dessert, all that kind of stuff.  <br/>
I know my mom had a lot of rules about food that seem arbitrary to me  <br/>
in retrospect, like no pop before 11 a.m. (and you can bet I was  <br/>
watching that clock some mornings!). That stayed with me so much that  <br/>
I was shocked when I fell in love with David, who used to have a Coke  <br/>
with breakfast every morning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe just take a breath, and say, &quot;Sure!&quot; when he asks for the gummi  <br/>
bears or the donut. If the response really is a knee-jerk reflex,  <br/>
planning an alternative response in advance might help.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re looking at things just fine, but are stuck on  <br/>
this one thing. So I&#39;d say you probably don&#39;t need to do more  <br/>
thinking about it, but decide on an alternate action.<br/>

&gt; Hello All, I&#39;ve been reading the posts, and we have a real food issue here.  I have always <br/>

5 more kids to the mix, so now 9 kids.  In his house you didn&#39;t have a piece of bread with out <br/>
asking.  Not so at my moms house, and she would get irritated(still does) when i would ask <br/>
first.  I ve gotten better, but  when we go anywhere, i bring lunch/dinner and lots of snacks, <br/>
just in case.  At home our oldest always was a free range type, she ate whatever when she <br/>
was hungry.  No issue, then one of our twins has big food issues, she eats until she throws <br/>
up, not all the time, but if i don&#39;t pay close attention, once a day.  She is 5 and is epileptic, <br/>
has developmental issues(so what), and still puts everything in her mouth.  So food has <br/>
become an issue in our house.  Now my kids have to ask, and some times i have to say no, <br/>
and I hate it.  But i have learned to space her eating, or stall her a bit telling her to let her <br/>
food digest a bit, but it is still ME controlling her eating, any suggestions?  BTW we are <br/>
vegetarians, and the kids usually choose healthy foods, so eating healthy foods isn&#39;t the <br/>
issue, but G&#39;s overeating.  Melanie in Vt (with three angels)<br/>
