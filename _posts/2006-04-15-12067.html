<div id="ygrps-yiv-550997672">At this month&#39;s LLL about nutrition one mother shared that her pediatrician<br/>
had actually told her if she didn&#39;t start solids early enough, that he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t learn to eat.  She acknowledged how silly it was that she listened<br/>
to him.  Obviously her child wouldn&#39;t be a teenager and not know how to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess &quot;they&quot; are the &quot;experts in the field, but let us not forget Dr.<br/>
Spock was an &quot;expert&quot;.<br/>

  Heh I have to laugh. I was lucky Courtney had a great pediatrician who suggested she was ready for solids past 6 months AND when she started grabbing them off my plate and who stated the average age to wean was 3 years. She finally got interested in solids at 18 months and ate maybe 3 jars of baby food in her life.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We moved and the ped I got stuck with for a while with my son actually told me the very same thing. I feel blessed that I had already been educated in this area :) <br/>
