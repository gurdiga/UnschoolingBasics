<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052171594">&quot;I&#39;m open to suggestions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Buy another computer. Seriously!:)<br/>
I got an emachine for a great price and it&#39;s worked fabulous. Their<br/>
tech support was great when we were setting it up and having trouble<br/>
with the router. Just get some cheap emachine from Best Buy and that<br/>
will save you all a lot of stress I bet.<br/>
<br/>
If you really can&#39;t do that, then consider allowing each person as<br/>
long as they want (reminding them that people are waiting) and get the<br/>
other kids involved in some REALLY fun activity. Pull out clay or<br/>
playdough, put on a new movie, pull out some fun little toys or games<br/>
you&#39;ve been saving (because you planned ahead and buy little stashes<br/>
of things for just such a day), bake a pizza, do whatever it takes to<br/>
engage them so they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re missing something.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to be the full-time working parent. Maybe you could have<br/>
some activities set up ahead of time that you know they love, for dh<br/>
to engage them with? I guess it depends how actively involved he is<br/>
and how much tolerance he has for mess and such. I work full-time<br/>
also, but I&#39;m fortunate to have a dh that gets it now (not in the<br/>
past) and invites the kids into whatever he is doing. Jalen has been<br/>
helping Daddy dig in dirt a lot lately, as Markus landscapes the front<br/>
yard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, try to get more technology in your home if possible. Find ways<br/>
to engage everyone if not. And try to give them as much time as they<br/>
need on these activities so they feel &quot;full&quot; and not needy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh! I meant to reply to this...dh works at a university, you might  <br/>
call a local college or school district and see if they have an  <br/>
&#39;overflow&#39; dept. We bought one of our PC&#39;s for $35 at one, and it  <br/>
plays all the games that the kids want, and gets online. It&#39;s kind of  <br/>
slow sometimes, but it really works.<br/>
<br/>
As well, for extra computer time, we have dh&#39;s work computer set up  <br/>
so that you log on to get in, and goes to a different desktop for  <br/>
each person. SO his work stuff is protected, and actually Josh can  <br/>
use it to save stuff he doesn&#39;t want the girls messing up (like RPG&#39;s  <br/>
and stuff)<br/>
<br/>
Might look into some kind of OS that does that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238501415">I know Linux does this quite well... I&#39;m no linux/computer geek, but the boys&#39; dad is & he&#39;s quite good with this stuff & loves to play with different Linux operating systems while I just want something that works well! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have my computer set up with a separate account for everyone & several of the files/programs have permissions set up so some files are accessible to all and some are accessible to the owner of a specific account...the modem & printer are networked together so we don&#39;t conflicts over who is online or getting something printed out...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we are working towards getting one or two more computers so that the level of &quot;is it my turn yet?&quot; gets a lot lower... we still probably won&#39;t have one computer per person (6 in the household) as I don&#39;t think we have enough room for that... Ren, you had a great idea re: letting each person have as much time as they want while reminding them that other people are waiting for a turn on the computer, while having interesting things going on for the others who are waiting.  <br/>
<br/>
I considered giving each person a &quot;day&quot; when the computer is theirs when I&#39;m not using it... (I&#39;m sharing mine with the boys)... don&#39;t know if that will work or not.<br/>
<br/>
Originally we tried having each person have a certain amount of time, but that didn&#39;t work because the youngest would be really frustrated because time doesn&#39;t mean anything to him yet... he&#39;s 4 and will say he wants 4 minutes &lt;lol&gt;... <br/>
<br/>
Last night, one of the boys asked &quot;is it my turn yet?&quot; several times while the 4 yr old was playing on the computer & I said &quot;let him have some fun. watch the movie with us&quot; (we were watching Spirited Away for the 3rd or 4th time...from Netflix)... I still had not gotten to a point where I figured out how to work things out so that everyone would have the time they want since we still don&#39;t have the other computer(s) we&#39;re hoping to get (and we still probably won&#39;t have enough computers, we&#39;ll still have to figure out how to share)... <br/>
<br/>
My older son said that the youngest was going to turn out like Veruca, the little girl in Charlie & the Chocolate factory whose father gave her everything she wanted... and after he presented her with the golden ticket to go to the chocolate factory, she said &quot;Daddy. I want another pony&quot; or something like that... and later when she wants one of Willy Wonka&#39;s trained squirrels, the movie shows the squirrels deciding she is a bad nut, etc... <br/>
<br/>
I told him he won&#39;t turn out like Veruca! &lt;grin&gt; He just doesn&#39;t grok the concept of time yet... Heck, if we don&#39;t talk about it, only Gary or I will know what day it is... we&#39;ve got a calendar, but don&#39;t always look at it... the twins (11) MIGHT know what day it is & I know Evan will keep track during soccer season cuz he doesn&#39;t want to miss a game or practice!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we&#39;re still working out good ways to share the computer... hopefully we&#39;ll have more computerage in the house in the next few weeks or so...2 more would be ideal: one for the older 2 and one for the younger 2... the 3 oldest ones are looking forward to setting up a version of Linux on the computers!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

(in their cases to keep out dust and such) under beds, next to beds, <br/>
beside the sofa, wherever. Add in a wireless router to serve as the <br/>
connection to the printers and Internet and such and you&#39;re good to go <br/>
anywhere in the house. (it&#39;s also really handy to be able to pop up a <br/>
laptop in the bedroom when you&#39;re watching a movie and going &quot;I know <br/>
I&#39;ve seen that actor before - where was it?&quot; and you can jump onto <br/>
imdb and find out)<br/>
