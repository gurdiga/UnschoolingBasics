<div id="ygrps-yiv-708553979">&#39; I completely disagree with that idea in my experience. My son is<br/>
only 3 and half and has more than 50 Thomas The Thank Engine<br/>
&quot;engines/car sets&quot;. He loves every single one of them. We have at<br/>
least 6 or 7 Thomas and he knows minimal diferrences between them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even remember which list I was reading this week, but there<br/>
was a thread about the benefit of having lots of something. If you<br/>
have SCADS of legos for example, you can build much cooler things. If<br/>
you have a lot of blocks, all the more fun!<br/>
So while I completely understand being frugal (I like the simple<br/>
things) I don&#39;t think withholding things from our children that they<br/>
love, helps them understand the point of being frugal.<br/>
<br/>
We can help them better by modeling and encouraging such traits as<br/>
recycling, re-using, gifting used things etc...<br/>

Christmas.  Someone mentioned Thomas the Tank Engine which was almost<br/>
our theme.  The boys just didn&#39;t have quite enough track, and they had<br/>
mentioned a couple of large pieces they wanted.  The railway has now<br/>
completely outgrown the table, but it can easily accomodate two small<br/>
boys and their father, with plenty of room, because we have lots of<br/>
track.  Someone else got one the boys a new Lego automobile set, a<br/>
really nice one.  We can build about three more Lego cars now than we<br/>
could given the cool new wheels and other pieces. I was once attacked<br/>
at the computer by a nearly three foot tall Bionicle.  Though, I don&#39;t<br/>
know how many individual Bionicles it took to create it, I do know it<br/>
was a feat of engineering.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445990169">...which should really read frugality, shouldn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t know if<br/>
frugalness is a word, time for the dictionary!:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My son is one who gets overwhelmed with too much stuff. Too many<br/>
different things out at once (as in, available to him)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you already do this, but here&#39;s something we like to do...<br/>
we put some of their toys in bins and keep them in the basement. The<br/>
kids help us choose some things they&#39;re tired of, but aren&#39;t ready to<br/>
part with and we haul them away.<br/>
Then, you rotate stuff, so they always have some &quot;new&quot; old things to<br/>
play with. I love pulling out some old toys that suddenly are very<br/>
interesting because they&#39;ve been out of sight for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Keeps the environment from being overwhelming and they still have<br/>
access to a lot of interesting things.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have scads of Legos, you can play BrikWars (brikwarsdotcom is <br/>
their website) - it&#39;s a pretty cool game where you build a little <br/>
town, or some fortresses or whatever and then use the miniature <br/>
figure (minifigs in the game parlance) and dice to have battles - <br/>
the fun part is that buildings get blown up (lego pieces <br/>
disassemble) but they can be rebuilt or the pieces used to assemble <br/>
small walls for cover or whatever. We&#39;ve got an ever-changing 6&#39;x3&#39; <br/>
BrikWars scenario in our basement. At first it was a bunch of simple <br/>
blocky buildings which gave way to buildings and look out towers <br/>
which have now evolved into two ginormous castles - DH&#39;s colors are <br/>
red, black and white, DS uses the blue, green and yellow. It&#39;s <br/>
really cool.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;ve got scads of legos (and especially minifigs) that you <br/>
aren&#39;t using anymore ever, I&#39;d like to see about arranging some sort <br/>
of trade or purchase deal...<br/>
