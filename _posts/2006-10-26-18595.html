<div id="ygrps-yiv-451369865">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
this e-mail got too long, but I&#39;m so bad in summarizing, so I&#39;ve put  <br/>
headers for you to decide wich part you want to read – the question  <br/>
is understandable without the begining ;-D<br/>
<br/>
*My dad*<br/>
=======<br/>
I survived my first 4 days with my father visiting us after we  <br/>
started gentle parenting. He&#39;s a &quot;fan&quot; of coercive methods and has  <br/>
long worked with children - with &quot;uneducatable children&quot; - children  <br/>
of parents who don&#39;t do anything with them, neglect them and just  <br/>
don&#39;t care, so they start not going to school, playing in the cat&#39;s  <br/>
toilet, throwing with pooh, parents beating them and so on. He worked  <br/>
for the youth office to take care of these children. Now he&#39;s working  <br/>
in a school were children have a lot of freedom in learning, though  <br/>
they still have some classes they have to attend. He says he sees  <br/>
they don&#39;t learn anything, and of course learning in freedom works,  <br/>
if you&#39;re going to live in &quot;the jungle&quot; and don&#39;t need &quot;civilized&quot;  <br/>
skills. Nobody would hire you without a good graduation certificate  <br/>
blahblah. I avoided saying anything about my dream of not sending my  <br/>
daughter to school ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*Talking to him*<br/>
============<br/>
Well anyway, I succeeded in explaining my new way of gentle  <br/>
parenting, no punishments, no rules and no limitations, lots of help  <br/>
and strewing etc. I also succeeded to avoid any labels  <br/>
(&quot;unschooling&quot;, &quot;gentle parenting&quot;, or worse &quot;antiauthoritarian  <br/>
education&quot; (which is known by this name as the way the Hippies did in  <br/>
the 70&#39;s and has a very very  bad reputation around here for &quot;not  <br/>
having worked&quot;))<br/>
<br/>
*His fight with my daughter*<br/>
=====================<br/>
It was so cool, he was much more tolerant than I had expected (I was  <br/>
nervous and had wanted to avoid the subject, but we had to talk about  <br/>
it, because when I wasn&#39;t there, an argument arised between him and  <br/>
my daughter. He told her to &quot;bring the jacket upstairs&quot; and she said  <br/>
&quot;I can decide on my own if I want to do that&quot; and he started yelling  <br/>
at her &quot;YOU BRING THE JACKET UPSTAIRS BECAUSE I TELL YOU SO&quot; and so  <br/>
on, so she got histeric and shouted and cried, he packed her by her  <br/>
shoulders and &quot;threw&quot; her in her room for being disrespectful and  <br/>
told her she was not allowed to come out until she &quot;calmed down&quot;. So  <br/>
I had to explain why she reacted that way and we engaged in a  <br/>
peaceful conversation about gentle parenting and our new ways).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The outcome of our discussion*<br/>
=========================<br/>
I was so proud of him for understanding most of what I said, for  <br/>
being respectful and so tolerant of other ways and open minded to  <br/>
listen. I was so proud of *me* for having soooo many arguments  <br/>
(thanks to you, this list, and all those blogs and websites on  <br/>
unschooling!) and for being able to respond to most of the &quot;typical&quot;  <br/>
questions! :-D He agreed on a lot of what I said, and he couldn&#39;t  <br/>
quite make his point, at the end he just said &quot;well it sounds good,  <br/>
but i have the feeling there is *something* wrong with the concept,  <br/>
but I don&#39;t know exactly what it is yet; something bothers me about it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*My question*<br/>
===========<br/>
But – There were a few questions/comments I couldn&#39;t respond to,  <br/>
would you help me out?:<br/>
<br/>
(Since this e-mail is already so long, I will only post a first  <br/>
question and later on others if I don&#39;t forget...)<br/>
<br/>
How will children learn that what you do/decide to do has a  <br/>
(sometimes bad) *consequence*, if you don&#39;t let your child experience  <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, he said I was pushing my responsibility (for her)  <br/>
onto her. Because if her actions had bad consequences, *she* would be  <br/>
the one who would have to live with the consequence (bad teeth, a  <br/>
cold, bad skills, being &quot;dumb&quot; because of TV etc, no friends for lack  <br/>
of social skills, whatever (he didn&#39;t name these consequences, I&#39;m  <br/>
making them up for better understanding)). I said that in any child  <br/>
rearing &quot;technique&quot; the children are the ones who carry the  <br/>
consequences (but his point was that forcing the child to put on a  <br/>
jacket would *avoid* the bad consequence of a cold, for instance, and  <br/>
it was my responsibility that she doesn&#39;t GET sick in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he thought this approach would be OK (but meaner  <br/>
than just using coercive methods) if I would let her experience the  <br/>
cold and the sickness, so she would &quot;learn the consequences of her  <br/>
actions&quot; - but then I said that if she made a mistake, I wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
there saying &quot;well - bad luck - you see how stupid a decission it was  <br/>
to not bring the jacket? now live with the consequences&quot; – so I would  <br/>
either have already brought a jacket and carried it myself until she  <br/>
felt cold, or given her mine or went home or bought one on the way  <br/>
or... (creative solutions).<br/>
<br/>
But then he said, if I was *always* there for her, jumping in at  <br/>
whatever conflict/problem arose, how would she learn that in (&quot;real&quot;)  <br/>
life, all actions have consequences and that later on there wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
always be somebody with an umbrella to rescue you from the  <br/>
consequences of standing with pyjamas in the rain?<br/>
<br/>
I only said that she&#39;d see what the consequences were anyway (oh,  <br/>
it&#39;s cold if I don&#39;t bring a jacket), but she just didn&#39;t have to  <br/>
suffer the consequences and that at times it was more important to  <br/>
learn &quot;mommy will be there for me, I can count on her&quot;). I said I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine a child was so dumb as to conclude I would always be  <br/>
&quot;serving&quot; him/her for the rest of my life, as my mother isn&#39;t doing  <br/>
anymore (and never was, lol!) and that children usually become  <br/>
independent themselves all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Another argument would be, but it didn&#39;t come to my mind when we  <br/>
talked, is why would children who are forced to put on their jackets  <br/>
*learn* that their actions have consequences – they don&#39;t even have  <br/>
the few minutes of experience like our children, until we pull out  <br/>
the jackets of our backpacks. Plus all the bad things they learn  <br/>
about their parents being mean, arbitrary, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, I feel there must be more to say about that... any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading and for making me strong to &quot;survive&quot; a  <br/>
conversation with my father about it,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It comes down to a matter of trust for us. If I say to my <br/>
daughter &quot;Your friend may not want to come over anymore if you spend <br/>
all your time on the phone while she&#39;s here. She looks upset because <br/>
you&#39;re ignoring her.&quot; she trusts me enough to know that I may be <br/>
right. She can still choose to stay on the phone but then her friend <br/>
has the choice to go home. Also, before her friend came over, we <br/>
would have talked about certain situations and ways to handle them.  <br/>
I don&#39;t micro-manage my daughters, so when I do offer a suggestion <br/>
or advice because I have experience in a certain situation, they <br/>
usually trust that I know what I&#39;m talking about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523979884">Well as I said, these are just examples of things people usually say.  <br/>
I know all this. There surely are bad consequences to some actions.  <br/>
It&#39;s already a &quot;bad consequences&quot; to be cold without jacket and  <br/>
having to suffer. Whatever, these were just random examples :-)<br/>

fine and we continued on our walk.  Along the way I started <br/>

me she should be dressed warmer.  My thought was this, she knows if <br/>
she&#39;s cold, she knows she can go back and get a coat, or whatever, <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t insist that you dress warmer just b/c I feel cold.  <br/>
