<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014984796">It&#39;s funny that this topic came up now.  I just started reading JOhn <br/>
Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;, the first part of which deals with <br/>
reading and writing and specifically with invented spelling.  As a <br/>
teacher I can say that like everything else the views on approaches <br/>
like phonics, invented spelling, etc. is an ever swinging pendelum, <br/>
constantly changing.  So the concerns about learning to spell, or <br/>
write, or whatever are completely unfounded.  There was a time about <br/>
10 yrs. ago that the trend was to immerse a child completely in a <br/>
print rich environment and they would learn to read and write.  This <br/>
was the &quot;trend&quot; called Whole Language that was occuring while I was <br/>
in college.  Does this approach sound familiar, I think it was as <br/>
close as a school as ever come to unschooling.  But, of course some <br/>
power at be from above decided it wasn&#39;t working after only a couple <br/>
of years and the pendelum swung again. My point in all this is that <br/>
even if your child is in school there&#39;s no more reason to believe <br/>
that he will be a better speller.  My husband is a horrible speller <br/>
and has terrible grammar.  I on the other hand was considered a good <br/>
speller growing up, but as an adult I find myself struggling at <br/>
times, both of us grew up in public schools.  <br/>
<br/>
This leads me to my second point.  Many people say that reading <br/>
helps you learn to spell.  Maybe for some, but I disagree with that <br/>
for me.  I must read the word restaurant several times a day, but <br/>
still I find often when I write my spell check catches that I write <br/>
restraunt.  So reading it often hasn&#39;t improved my spelling.  I came <br/>
to have good &quot;English skills&quot; through my mother.  I vividly recall <br/>
writing papers in grade school, afterwards my mom would mark with <br/>
brackets the areas that had a mistake be it spelling, run-ons, <br/>
punctuation whatever, and then would hand it back for me to find and <br/>
fix.  So, again I didn&#39;t learn it through workbooks or school. <br/>
(Though not exactly the unschooling way either).  Just from what <br/>
I&#39;ve read I&#39;d reccomend reading &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d never seen what Jennifer posted about only the first and last <br/>
letter mattering, but I found it very interesting.  Being a teacher <br/>
of the deaf I&#39;ve seen some very interesting invented spelling.   <br/>
Often I get e-mails from deaf adults that my husband can&#39;t decipher <br/>
b/c of the bad spelling and grammar he&#39;ll ask, &quot;is that English?&quot;  <br/>
Yet these are very intelligient people, some of whom have even <br/>
traveled the world.  Doesn&#39;t seem to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share some thoughts.<br/>
