<div id="ygrps-yiv-719356186">So, yeah, you guys know that already.  But I spent about an hour last<br/>
night winding down by reading a particularly fascinating thread.  The<br/>
one entitled, &quot;Within Reason,&quot; I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and heya, I&#39;m Heather, I have two very little ones (DS 18 months,<br/>
DD 4)-- we live in East Tennessee.<br/>
<br/>
Since joining this group I have been more mindful in all aspects, but<br/>
most of all parenting.  I will not deny that I have just been<br/>
self-booted out of a control-freak phase-- in fact, I shall be very<br/>
open about that.  It shows that I have grown.<br/>
<br/>
A month ago, if you would have told me that I&#39;d be considering<br/>
homeschooling my kids, I would have laughed very, very hard.  In your<br/>
face, quite possibly.  Now, I&#39;m not only thinking of homeschooling,<br/>
but thinking of unschooling, and the more that I see the definition of<br/>
Unschool unfold, the more I am drawn to it.  And really, if you told<br/>
me  a month ago that the thought of having another baby would make me<br/>
like seriously wistful... <br/>
<br/>
...so that&#39;s what this list has done for me. <br/>
<br/>
My DD is in Head Start-- if ONLY I had thought of this a month ago. <br/>
She loves it, it&#39;s a 4 hour day and they do all kinds of fun stuff. <br/>
The classroom is actually pretty neat.  So, in interest of the whole<br/>
child-led learning thing-- I&#39;m letting her finish.  She&#39;d have a cow<br/>
if I pulled her out of there.  Before this school we spent much time<br/>
sitting around snapping at each other.  She expects home with me to be<br/>
the same again.  Everyone assumes that I am the same.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but I am not the same!  The last few weeks I have undergone a<br/>
transformation.  I have sprouted wings.  I see a continuation of that<br/>
attachment parenting that is so dear to me in the first couple of<br/>
years of my kids&#39; life.  This gentleness is so much different than the<br/>
&quot;MY-WRATH-WILL-COME-DOWN-UPON-YOU&quot; style of parenting that I have been<br/>
exposed to much of my life.  <br/>
<br/>
So thanks, you guys.  It&#39;s not just this list, it&#39;s also inspiring<br/>
blogs, especially Ren&#39;s and Arun&#39;s.  I&#39;ve started the beginnings of my<br/>
own blog to catalog this exciting adventure here: <br/>

there will be.  I&#39;m a blogger to the toes.<br/>
<br/>
See ya around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408300502">Here, here. I&#39;ve really changed my parenting with much help from this <br/>
list. It&#39;s fabulous being more relaxed, and going back to attachment <br/>
parenting-thinking. I think that is mostly what my son has responded <br/>
to so positively. And, I thank you for that.<br/>
