<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388452333">I have been lurking around this list for a while.  I have not posted because it&#39;s hard to <br/>
know where to begin while at the same time not turning my post into a book ... LOL  This <br/>
is my 14th year of homeschooling.  I have one son in college and I have one son who is <br/>
technically in 9th grade.  Over th years I feel like we&#39;ve done it all or at least tried.  I&#39;ve <br/>
dabbled in unschooling.  When my oldest was in 9th grade we pretty much unschooled <br/>
that year.  He refers to that year as the year we didn&#39;t do anything.  Interestingly, that was <br/>
the year that he finally learned  how to play guitar after trying a couple of times years <br/>
prior.  His music is very important to him ... he is in a band and I love to hear the songs he <br/>
has written.  We have not truly unschooled since that year.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m just at a loss.  My youngest son although in 9th grade does not read or write <br/>
well.  He does improve each year but he is far from 9th grade material.  You can imagine <br/>
how this affects everything. (By the way, he&#39;s never written a report or any kind of paper in <br/>
his life.)  His math is less than desirable as well.  He&#39;s got the basics down pretty well for <br/>
the most part be he&#39;s of the age where he should be doing algebra ... I don&#39;t think so!!   I <br/>
realize that I have tried to fit a round peg in a square hole by making him do traditional <br/>
types of school work.  As of two weeks ago I threw the curriculum out the window (a very <br/>
expensive lesson for mom!).  Other than helping me out with things around the house and <br/>
with my business, he spends his time playing World of Warcraft (greatly responsible for <br/>
improving his reading skills amongst other things as he is a brilliant game player) and he <br/>
plays his drums...very well I might add and always on his own.  I&#39;ve never pushed it ... <br/>
that&#39;s  his own baby.  We have been playing a lot of board games as well since we threw <br/>
out the curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the problem?  Where do I begin!!  I&#39;ve been freaking out because I&#39;ve got the <br/>
mind set of things counting towards graduation.  And what about college?! I haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to relax and trust this process.  I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s the right thing.  And God <br/>
forbid if someone asks him or I what he&#39;s doing in school.  I think we both panick.  If I <br/>
could feel confident in what we&#39;re doing I&#39;m sure it would help him feel confident as well.  I <br/>
go about my day wondering what the heck we&#39;re doing.  Oh my gosh... and then I just die <br/>
when I hear my son announce to his friends &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything today&quot;.  Geez.... don&#39;t say <br/>
that I&#39;ll tell him.  You let the wrong person hear that and we&#39;ll have the authorities <br/>
snooping around.<br/>
<br/>
Well... this is a good start.  Trust me... I could go on and on but I&#39;ll let it go at this.  For <br/>
once in my homeschooling career I&#39;d like to be confident in what we&#39;re doing and just <br/>
relax.  I&#39;m tired and burned out.... and it shows at home as my creativity across the board <br/>
is spent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990036030">Hang in there.  I&#39;m new to this unschooling process myself.  My kids <br/>
are much younger, but I too cringe when I overhear them telling a <br/>
relative we didn&#39;t do anything.  I feel the need to step in and <br/>
elaborate on the issue.  But I do realize that we have to get out of <br/>
that mentality of what will others think.  Homeschooling is not <br/>
traditional schooling as we know it.  We have the freedoms to run it <br/>
pretty much any way we want, Thank God for that.  We have to have <br/>
confidence in ourselves and our decisions for our family.  We can&#39;t <br/>
allow others to dictate how to run our homes. So relax and let things <br/>
flow.<br/>

<br/>
I usually lurk, but I am sometimes good at making people feel better. You<br/>
seems to need a hug --  so here ((())). I hope it helps!<br/>
<br/>
Your son seems to see the whole school/learning thing as a failure on his<br/>
part. Maybe it would help to find the things he likes (drums obviously) and<br/>
encourage them. Celebrate what he can do and what feels good to him. I know<br/>
from personal experience that it is easy to look at a child¹s activities and<br/>
say ³he did not do what I wanted him to do today ³ but in your mind that<br/>
gets mutated into ³he did nothing². Don¹t let that happen. He does tons of<br/>
things every day. He is learning all the time. But maybe not the academic<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Then you  might want to look together at why he has such a hard time with<br/>
those subjects you mention (reading, writing, math). Is it a confidence<br/>
issue? It his learning style different from the way he has been introduced<br/>
to those subjects? Is it a lack of motivation (finding books interesting to<br/>
him, having a good-to-him reason to write, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
I will leave you with another hug ((( ))) and encouragement to not worry so<br/>
much. It is his life and his learning. He will make of it what he wants. But<br/>
you can help him in his endeavors!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743203275">I may be an odd one to respond, because, technically, I&#39;m not an<br/>
unschooler (I view myself as relaxed eclectic) but here goes.<br/>
<br/>
First, learning happens much better, deeper, even faster, if it is<br/>
backed by interest.  We were cruising along, doing the sequential<br/>
history thing, somewhere maybe in the Renaissance (iirc), when ds<br/>
asked if, when we got a chance, could we please learn about WWII.  (He<br/>
had been playing Battlefield 1942 on the computer.)  Rather than tell<br/>
him to wait for it, we switched gears immediately, went to the<br/>
library, got WWII for Dummies (or Idiot&#39;s Guide to WWII -- I can&#39;t<br/>
remember which), and had a cool time learning about it.  (As I had<br/>
never had it in school, we really were both learning, too!)  We<br/>
discussed things, saw parallels between what we were reading and Star<br/>
Trek: Deep Space 9 (we were watching it, and were up to the parts with<br/>
the Dominion.)  When we got to the battle of Stalingrad, he excitedly<br/>
said, &quot;That&#39;s exactly how it plays out in the game!&quot;  Life was good!<br/>
<br/>
Remember, too, that there is nothing fixed about WHEN a particular<br/>
subject needs to be learned.  Nothing fixed that says he HAS to<br/>
graduate on such and such a day.  Those are things that can be changed<br/>
up and down, as appropriate.  What if he doesn&#39;t learn algebra until<br/>
he is 16?  Will his world end?  (I hope not, as I assume he lives in<br/>
the same one I do!)  <br/>
<br/>
He may find he learns these things better through concrete means, when<br/>
they come up in things he enjoys doing.  From my observations, I think<br/>
a lot of teens (and especially boys) really like to have some<br/>
concrete, real-world connections, something that they are contributing<br/>
in a real way, not abstract paper pushing.  (And this holds true for<br/>
academically-oriented kids, like my son.)  He may need to see the real<br/>
use of it before he fully grasps it.<br/>
<br/>
He may graduate with huge honkin&#39; holes.  That&#39;s okay.  I graduated<br/>
from public school with huge honkin&#39; holes, too (see the bit about<br/>
WWII -- that wasn&#39;t the only hole), and managed fine.  The important<br/>
thing is that he knows how to fill those holes as he needs/wants to!<br/>
<br/>
So, when those ugly fears raise their ugly heads, ask yourself, &quot;What<br/>
harm is there if he doesn&#39;t get all these things by the age of 18? <br/>
Will I kick him out then?  Will he be doomed to a destitute life?&quot; <br/>
Odds are, no.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982021430">What do most schooled children reply when you ask what they did at <br/>
school today? &quot;Nothing,&quot; is a pretty common reply. What if someone <br/>
asked you what you did today? Often the polite answer is, &quot;Nothing <br/>
much,&quot; simply because the real answer is &quot;did a load of laundry, ate <br/>
breakfast (lunch, dinner), went for a walk, played some games, read a <br/>
bit...&quot; and on and on. If it&#39;s your best friend asking, you&#39;ll probably <br/>
relate the big aha you had that day, a struggle or something that was <br/>
interesting to you. But if it is someone you don&#39;t generally have deep <br/>
conversations with, &quot;Nothing much,&quot; does pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s still frustrating when you feel you need to defend what <br/>
you&#39;re doing! But maybe you could get your kids on board (depending on <br/>
their age and inclination) with a help-mom-out-here plea where if they <br/>
get asked that question, they think hard of what was the most <br/>
interesting thing they thought about, did or realized that day and <br/>
relate it to whomever is asking.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121580862">Thank you for the warm replies ... for the support and suggestions... and the hugs :).  As <br/>
much as I hate to admit it, I seem to care too much what other people think.  I know that&#39;s <br/>
a common issue.  It seems to be cropping up in other areas of my life recently.  Funny... <br/>
twice today I have found myself talking about this.  Caring too much about how others <br/>
think about us is causing me great stress that I don&#39;t need.  I have heard of a book (years <br/>
ago) called something like It&#39;s None Of Your Business What Other People Think Of You.  <br/>
Something like that.  I should hunt that down and read it.  And I&#39;m realizing more and <br/>
more to help with some of those uncomfortable moment when people ask questions is to <br/>
have answers ready ahead of time.  Be prepared so that I don&#39;t have to fear or avoid.  <br/>
Cause I think I&#39;m darn well ready to put this crap to rest.<br/>
<br/>
But more than that... I worry about my son.  I try to find rest in the fact that he has always <br/>
been a late bloomer.  He&#39;s immature for being 14.  I worked with an educational counselor <br/>
for the Moore Academy (as in Dorothy and Raymond Moore) ... a very wise eldery woman <br/>
who I highly respect would remind me of his immaturity and to accept him and support <br/>
him where he is.  I try to do that.  But from time to time fear crops up that I need to be <br/>
doing more... that he needs to be doing more.  All of Austyn&#39;s friends are in school.  When <br/>
I hear them talk about their school work I sometimes freak out ... not that they&#39;re talking <br/>
alot about school.  Sometimes they  mention a tough day or a quick blurb about <br/>
something they&#39;re doing.  And  occasionally it&#39;s conversations with other homeschoolers <br/>
who do more traditional schooling.  Anyway, Austyn is not a reader.  Never has been... <br/>
maybe never will be.  Even when he was a little boy he didn&#39;t care to be read to much.  His <br/>
favorite books most of the time were hands on types of books with pop ups or things to <br/>
do or find.  Guess that should be my first clue.  A few years back he was in a reading <br/>
program for a year where he went twice a week.  It was a kind of hands on type of <br/>
program that was really good.  It helped him a lot but he still finds it difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I admire all of you who are able to trust this process... trust yourselves... and trust your <br/>
child.  Lately I&#39;ve been thinking that I need to do more work on myself... in a nurturing <br/>
type of way ...  to bring creativity and inspiration back into our home as I notice more and <br/>
more how zombie like we are particularly during the day.  Sounds wierd I know... but we&#39;ve <br/>
had a lot of challenges that have left us with this burned out feeling.  I&#39;ve got to learn to <br/>
let go of the &quot;stuff&quot; and allow a fresh energy  to sweep through our home and our own <br/>
spirits so that we can soar once again.<br/>

bad words via Grand Theft Auto. Learnt how to drive on the ride side <br/>
of the road in Simpsons and learnt about nuclear plants too.  We went <br/>
visiting musuems, leanrt alot about ancient civilization, about <br/>
bones. We learnt what skiing is about, tried it and not too sure <br/>
about it. We also learnt that to stay the whole day in pjs is fun and <br/>
ok, because who cares what other people thinks. We also leanrt that <br/>
it&#39;s common sense to change out of our pjs, if we need to go out, <br/>
because we would look silly if we go shopping in our pjs LOL! We&#39;ve <br/>
learnt so many more routes, to go to so many more places, so much <br/>
more than when we first started! <br/>
<br/>
And yes, we know additions and subtractions too, because we need to <br/>
in order to be able to take enough cash out of the bank, before we <br/>
can go shopping for anything. And of course, we know MUmmy&#39;s the <br/>
cleverest because she know&#39;s her multiplication, hence we&#39;re always <br/>
thinking of ways to &quot;upset&quot; her by showing off OUR multiplication <br/>
knowledge!!! <br/>
<br/>
Son : I know what 10 x 5 equals to!<br/>
Mum : No, you don&#39;t, and you can&#39;t because I&#39;m the cleverest HAH!<br/>
Son : OH no you&#39;re not! 10 x 5 = 50!!<br/>
Mum : Aaarrrgh!!! How come you knew that??!! It&#39;s killing meee.... <br/>
(pretend to melt into a pool of cushions!) No I can&#39;t let you beat <br/>
me...Bet you don&#39;t know what 10 x 10 is!!<br/>
Son : Oh yes I do, IT&#39;s 100!!&quot;<br/>
Mum : Arrgghhh.. the clever mummy witch is dying because your brain <br/>
power is too strong for me.....aarrrggh!!!<br/>
<br/>
Son then jump with gleee onto mummy witch!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do intervene by re-phrasing the questions to &quot;Tell us/ whoever <br/>
how much you paid for your new gaming magazine and tell us what&#39;s in <br/>
it? or , how do you get that &quot;promotion&quot; in your Toon Town game, or <br/>
how many jellybeans do you need for those gags&quot; Of which son will <br/>
happily launched into his detailed descriptions of all the different <br/>
Cogs and gags and toon-ups with lots of numbers addition thrown in as <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
So the queston should be re-phrased to &quot;How did you managed to kill <br/>
that clever mummy multiplication witch that day?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579221052">Interesting you should bring this up because I often feel like if I were<br/>
to post about my insecurities and doubts I may get beat over the head<br/>
for them. I do understand how you feel as I have been struggling with<br/>
the same thoughts lately also. My children are a lot younger but non the<br/>
less I fell so worried and full of doubt about this process. My kids are<br/>
12, 9, 7, & 5 and we have always, for the most part, unschooled- I<br/>
probably would be defined eclectic- modestly- with strong unschoolong<br/>
tendancies. My 9 yr old is not reading very well and writing is a<br/>
non-interest for the most part. She is not very articulate and really<br/>
struggles to explain herself clearly so she often (always has) been very<br/>
introverted. I try to talk with her about the benefits of reading and<br/>
encourage her to work on it but she resents me for it and has begun to<br/>
feel concerned herself (i feel so guilty about that). I feel like I<br/>
started out with such great intentions but now it&#39;s a snowball going<br/>
downhill and no matter how hard I try I can&#39;t stop it. I &#39;ve considered<br/>
adding more structure and stuff to the day but my kids (all of them) are<br/>
too smart for that- they won&#39;t have any of it! They are unschoolers and<br/>
they know it- so Mom has to regress- I feel very out of control and<br/>
unhappy(some days) with what I have allowed. Maybe I should have never<br/>
given them so much freedom to learn on their own? Please don&#39;t bash me-<br/>
i&#39;m just another loving mom trying to find the right path- handle me<br/>
with kindness huh? hehe It doesn&#39;t help that DH really isn&#39;t on board<br/>
either. He thinks we should have more order- our order! ha! that&#39;s a<br/>
joke! We have very little opportunity to get out since I also sit for a<br/>
little one during the week and out car is too small to fit her so we are<br/>
home with really no friends around. That doesn&#39;t seem to bother my kids<br/>
too much but it bothers me! With very little money I am always worried<br/>
and distracted. Arghhh! I need perspective too. Burned out is a great<br/>
description of how I am feeling also. Maybe it helps just to know that<br/>
others feel that way also. Let me offer ((hugs)) also and say from one<br/>
momma to another- we will get through this...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Had to LOL - a favorite car game is for DS to try to come up with a<br/>
number question that will stump me. He&#39;ll do things like &quot;What&#39;s 10x<br/>
20+50-12?&quot; and I&#39;ll just calculate it out, generally, as he says it<br/>
(238). Sometimes he includes DH in to see which of us can get the answer<br/>
first (usually me lol). But, on occasion, when it&#39;s just a couple<br/>
numbers (10x3+15 for example), I&#39;ll say Well, where are the parenthesis<br/>
because that changes the answer - 10x3=30+15=45 OR 10x (3+15) is 10x18<br/>
which is 180. and so on - brief intros to the idea of order of<br/>
operations without having to call it that. On occasion, he&#39;s wanted to<br/>
see how that looks written out so we&#39;ll run through a few number<br/>
questions on the chalkboard at home (we painted a whole section of the<br/>
dining room/kitchen wall with chalkboard paint).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your son was late into puberty (as was mine -- at 15.5, he finally<br/>
began it, and is almost 16, still in early puberty, really), would you<br/>
worry?  Or would you say, he is following his own time schedule?  <br/>
<br/>
We all have asynchronous development, different strengths and<br/>
weaknesses, and so forth.  The schools have this bizarre notion that<br/>
ALL 3rd graders should be doing xxx and ALL 9th graders should be<br/>
doing yyy... but really, some are ahead, some are behind in various<br/>
subjects.  The &quot;average&quot; that they are teaching to is a minority.  It<br/>
is as unfair to expect ALL kids to be hitting a particular educational<br/>
milestone because they are a certain age as to expect them to hit a<br/>
certain height milestone at a certain age.  As adults, we accept that<br/>
other adults have stronger and weaker areas, and as an adult, I have<br/>
discovered parts of me that were very behind back when have begun to<br/>
blossom.  We should give kids the same respect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my ds was in elementary school, we had him in private school. <br/>
There was a mother who brought her dd into the school from public<br/>
school.  The public school, at a certain grade (I can&#39;t remember<br/>
which) had a medieval thing they did.  I was so envious.  But our<br/>
little school, with help of parents (myself included) decided to do a<br/>
medieval study/Valentine&#39;s day feast.  The mother who had moved her dd<br/>
to the school said that what we did was real substance; what the ps<br/>
did was nothing in comparison.  (And they had a lot more resources!)<br/>
<br/>
So, they may be talking about school, but it may SOUND more &quot;wow&quot; than<br/>
it really is if you get down to brass tacks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that I found is a LOT of boys much prefer books about<br/>
things, not stories.  (Of course, many, my ds included, get drawn in<br/>
by humorous books!)  And shorter things, like magazines often appeal.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many boys don&#39;t want to SIT and be read to.  They may need to do<br/>
something else while listening.  My son (and yes, I still read to him,<br/>
even though he is capable of reading quite well and almost 16) doesn&#39;t<br/>
usually look like he is listening when I read aloud -- he may be<br/>
crocheting, twiddling the Rubik&#39;s cube, making chainmaille... you name<br/>
it.  But he is listening as well.<br/>

you always wanted to do, he may be curious enough to watch, or maybe<br/>
do some, too.  Baking, or sewing, or art or... you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
It is so hard, sometimes, for us to get back in touch with that inner<br/>
child, to recapture that sense of wonder that we used to have, after<br/>

sew and craft and bake and decorate and do whatever crazy project I could come up with.  <br/>
I need to find that part of me again.  I also think it&#39;s time to sit down and talk to Austyn <br/>
about where we are and what we&#39;re doing and why.  We really haven&#39;t done that much.  It&#39;s <br/>
been very helpful &quot;airing&quot; this out and getting some perspective.  And it is very helpful <br/>
reading about what other people are doing.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes it&#39;s funny how our kid&#39;s occasionally asked about sums and numbers, <br/>
purely out of curiosity! It&#39;s interesting how they doesn&#39;t view &quot;asking <br/>
about a sum question&quot; is like asking for trouble &quot;because now mummy&#39;s <br/>

&lt;&lt; As much as I hate to admit it, I seem to care too much what other  people <br/>
think. I know that&#39;s <br/>
a common issue. It seems to be cropping up in  other areas of my life <br/>
recently. Funny... <br/>
twice today I have found myself  talking about this. Caring too much about <br/>
how others <br/>
think about us is  causing me great stress that I don&#39;t need.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me it wasn&#39;t just what people thought of me, it&#39;s what I imagined they  <br/>
thought of me, even without them saying anything, which only made me weaker and <br/>
 more anxious with people who actually did say anything critical.  I&#39;d  drive <br/>
myself nutty preparing for conversations that never even  happened, and I&#39;d <br/>
often find myself getting pretty depressed.  I&#39;d  tell myself to stop worrying <br/>
about what other people think, but it never did any  good.  <br/>
 <br/>
What I found that helped was a book by Albert Ellis called The New Guide to  <br/>
Rational Living.  It was new to me but it&#39;s actually a pretty old book  and <br/>
not all that well-written (I even skipped a few chapters) but I&#39;d say  it&#39;s had <br/>
about as much of an impact on my thinking as John Holt&#39;s stuff did  years ago. <br/>
 In the same way, it started this wave of thinking  differently about all <br/>
kinds of areas of my life and had kind of a domino  effect.  <br/>
 <br/>
And as an added bonus, it&#39;s chock-full of dated vocabulary that kept  me <br/>
chuckling throughout, with words like balderdash and hogwash  that sadly, you just <br/>
don&#39;t hear too much anymore.  ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
(Oh, and if anybody happens to think my recommendation is total hogwash or  <br/>
even poppycock, I&#39;m okay with that now.  I&#39;m not even going to think about  it. <br/>
 LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057647413">Wow, Shileen, wow!!! No wonder you&#39;re burnt out! You&#39;re being too <br/>
hard on yourself. You did so well with your first, and now, obviously <br/>
your 2nd kid is nothing like your first, and you&#39;re panicking, and <br/>
you&#39;re blinded by all your panicking, so much so, you&#39;re drowning in <br/>
your confusion, which exerbates the panicking even more! <br/>
<br/>
Consider this scenario. What would you do, if you son&#39;s decided he&#39;s <br/>
gonna create his own version of War Craft? Or that he only wants to <br/>
be a professional guitar player, and I don&#39;t think he needs algebra <br/>
to be able to play that guitar fantastically. What can 9th grade do <br/>
to help him become a better professional War Craft player? <br/>
<br/>
Now consider this. What would you do if your son decided he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to go to uni, but instead he wants to go be a farmer? Would you <br/>
let him, or would you throw your hands up in horror? <br/>
<br/>
By then end of the day, algebra can be learnt when he&#39;s 20. Degrees <br/>
can still be achieved when he&#39;s 30. With all these internet, Open <br/>
University and correspondence courses, getting a certified education <br/>
is possible at whatever age. But getting a wholesome, life changing <br/>
and passionate career is another story. <br/>
<br/>
Not all of us is lucky enough to be able turn clock back and do all <br/>
those things that we wished we had done. Like when I&#39;m 36, and hated <br/>
my advertising job, and I wished I had persist in convincing my <br/>
parents to let me pursue fashion(which they all think is full of <br/>
fluff and small money!), instead of marketing. Even if I can take <br/>
that degree course now, I couldn&#39;t possibly afford the pay cut and <br/>
time and the energy to start my career all over again, in the fashion <br/>
world. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen so many people having to pick a degree course, just because <br/>
they&#39;ve came to that stage of thier life where they have to, they <br/>
didn&#39;t know what they want, so it&#39;s a case of &quot;just pick one&quot;. Went <br/>
thru the whole uni thing and graduate with a degree. then realised <br/>
it&#39;s not what they want. Alot of my friends ended up doing a job, <br/>
totally different from what they were trained to do. <br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m trying to say is, until he decided what he wants to be, <br/>
all these grade 9 subjects is not relevant to his mind, therefore <br/>
will be a burden and struggle for him to learn, because it seems so <br/>
pointless. <br/>
<br/>
My son wanted to be a train driver. Now I&#39;m thinking what&#39;s the point <br/>
of going to the uni, when all he only wanted to learnt was about how <br/>
to work a train? He&#39;s better off joining the local Railroad society. <br/>
<br/>
But then he&#39;s only 7, and his ambitions will be changing like the <br/>
weather. <br/>
<br/>
So, i thinking, what&#39;s the harm in throwing your caution to the air <br/>
and just let him and you chill for a duration of time, until his <br/>
interest is beginning to show you more concrete signs of directions? <br/>
Then you can start to pick up from there? <br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;m able to help.<br/>

<br/>
So what&#39;s the problem?  Where do I begin!!  I&#39;ve been freaking out <br/>
because I&#39;ve<br/>
got the mind set of things counting towards graduation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Graduation from what?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you know that &quot;The Truly Educated Never Graduate&quot; ? &lt;g&gt; I have <br/>
the bumper sticker.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And what about college?!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
What ABOUT college?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I haven&#39;t been able to relax and trust this process.  I&#39;m not even <br/>
sure if it&#39;s the right<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then why are you doing it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And God forbid if someone asks him or I what he&#39;s doing in school.  I <br/>
think we both<br/>
panick.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
What does it matter?<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked Duncan the other day what he did in school. He usually <br/>
answers that he doesn&#39;t DO school. His answer the other day was: &quot;I <br/>
learn.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Typically, *schooled* kids answer, &quot;Nothin&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If I could feel confident in what we&#39;re doing I&#39;m sure it would help <br/>
him feel<br/>
confident as well.  I go about my day wondering what the heck we&#39;re <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s time to do some research in order for *you* to feel confident.<br/>
<br/>
www.sandradodd.com<br/>
www.joyfullrejoycing.com<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child, an Unschooled Life<br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s Dumbing Us Down  and   The Underground History of <br/>
American Education<br/>
Grace Lewellyn&#39;s Teenage Liberation Handbook<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards<br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s The Book of Learning and Forgetting<br/>
Wes Beach&#39;s Opportunities After &quot;High School&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It will help a LOT for you to be informed and confident.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh my gosh... and then I just die when I hear my son announce to his <br/>
friends &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything today&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And then they impress him with ALL they learned in school that day, huh?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Geez.... don&#39;t say that I&#39;ll tell him.  You let the wrong person hear <br/>
that and we&#39;ll have the<br/>
authorities snooping around.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead, why don&#39;t you help him understand, in educationese, what he <br/>
DID learn today?  Give HIM confidence in what you&#39;re doing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well... this is a good start.  Trust me... I could go on and on but <br/>
I&#39;ll let it<br/>
go at this.  For once in my homeschooling career I&#39;d like to be <br/>
confident in what we&#39;re doing and<br/>
just relax.  I&#39;m tired and burned out.... and it shows at home as my <br/>
creativity<br/>
across the board is spent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Confidence is empowering.<br/>
<br/>
But if you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s hard to have <br/>
confidence in it.<br/>

 I feel like I<br/>
started out with such great intentions but now it&#39;s a snowball going<br/>
downhill and no matter how hard I try I can&#39;t stop it. I &#39;ve considered<br/>
adding more structure and stuff to the day but my kids (all of them) are<br/>
too smart for that- they won&#39;t have any of it! They are unschoolers and<br/>
they know it- so Mom has to regress- I feel very out of control and<br/>
unhappy(some days) with what I have allowed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Rather than &quot;regressing&quot;---how about leaping FORWARD?<br/>
<br/>
What have you &quot;allowed&quot; that makes you so unhappy?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe I should have never<br/>
given them so much freedom to learn on their own?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---coerced learning works so well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your goal for your children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn&#39;t help that DH really isn&#39;t on board<br/>
either. He thinks we should have more order- our order! ha! that&#39;s a<br/>
joke!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Order in what?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 9 yr old is not reading very well and writing is a<br/>
&gt; non-interest for the most part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most unschoolers of 9 yos would say the same thing about writing. A  <br/>
lot would say the same thing about reading.<br/>
<br/>
The *real* question is, what do they say about their teens?<br/>
<br/>
While I can&#39;t reassure you on the writing (my daughter has been  <br/>
writing in some form since she could pick up a pencil -- not from  <br/>
anything I did other than making paper and pencils available) but she  <br/>
was a later reader. Actually I&#39;m not sure when she could read. She  <br/>
just didn&#39;t like to. It wasn&#39;t until she was 12 maybe that she found  <br/>
an (adult) series she really liked and started reading for pleasure.  <br/>
Now her ability to read is indistinguishable from those who started  <br/>
reading at 6.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is not very articulate and really<br/>
&gt; struggles to explain herself clearly so she often (always has) been  <br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; introverted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would truly rethink that view of her. You&#39;re looking at where she  <br/>
isn&#39;t instead of where she is. Look at her  strengths rather than her  <br/>
perceived weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you think that you&#39;re the cause of how she is but  <br/>
you and she will be loads happier if you celebrate who she is right  <br/>
this moment rather than giving one thought to trying to move her from  <br/>
where she is to where you think she should be.<br/>
<br/>
She will get where she will inevitably end up in a more joyful state  <br/>
of mind if you celebrate where she is at each place on her journey  <br/>
rather than worrying about where she isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to talk with her about the benefits of reading and<br/>
&gt; encourage her to work on it but she resents me for it and has begun to<br/>
&gt; feel concerned herself (i feel so guilty about that).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t. Right this minute swear to yourself that you won&#39;t say another  <br/>
word about reading.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if someone talked to you about the benefits of  <br/>
documentaries and encouraged you to work on paying attention to  <br/>
documentaries? Doesn&#39;t the thought of someone wanting you to like  <br/>
such a vague thing that doesn&#39;t in itself have much meaning make it  <br/>
sound really dull?<br/>
<br/>
But if someone says &quot;Hey, I saw this really cool show on [some thing  <br/>
that you&#39;re passionate about]&quot; wouldn&#39;t you want to see it?<br/>
<br/>
Only schools need to worry about reading because they have people who  <br/>
will take away their funding if they can&#39;t show that the kids are  <br/>
learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers live life. Part of life includes TV shows and real people  <br/>
and games and books about things the kids are interested in. Learning  <br/>
to read is a by product of wanting to explore what interests them.<br/>
<br/>
Reading for reading&#39;s sake is as dull as watching documentaries for  <br/>
documentary&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe I should have never<br/>
&gt; given them so much freedom to learn on their own?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you believe the schools are doing any better? Do you think  <br/>
every 9 yo in school is reading? And writing? Yeah, they wish. The  <br/>
schools take credit for kids learning to read, but when kids are in a  <br/>
print rich environment with nurturing parents, the kids will read  <br/>
when they&#39;re developmentally able. (Thousands of unschooled kids are  <br/>
testament to this.)<br/>
<br/>
What schools do is rob kids of the realization that they can read  <br/>
without being taught and then torture the ones who would naturally  <br/>
read later into believing they&#39;re broken and too stupid to do what  <br/>
&quot;everyone&quot; else is doing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That doesn&#39;t seem to bother my kids<br/>
&gt; too much but it bothers me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think their happiness isn&#39;t enough of a clue that they&#39;re  <br/>
happy?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a serious question to ponder. I think another damaging thing  <br/>
schools, and society in general, is to get us to believe that we  <br/>
can&#39;t know what&#39;s true by our own observation. We need experts to  <br/>
tell us. We can&#39;t supposedly know when a child is sick. We can&#39;t  <br/>
supposedly know when a child is learning properly. So we need experts  <br/>
to tell us all the things we&#39;re too ignorant to see for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s disempowering. And a bunch of bunk.<br/>
<br/>
While I would try to joyfully get out of the house when you can,  <br/>
being in the house with a mom who celebrates the moment is going to  <br/>
top a mom who is in the house wishing she could be elsewhere. One  <br/>
joyfully eaten Oreo will trump one Oreo eaten with the regret that  <br/>
there isn&#39;t a whole bag of Oreos.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695298343">That&#39;s really neat. My dd (10) had &quot;invented&quot; a game like that starting in<br/>
toddlerhood. She started adding cars and it developed from there. We still<br/>
do it when she requests it. Now my ds (4) has been playing for a couple<br/>
years.Our state requires testing, which my dd decided to try and I had to<br/>
explain the symbols because we&#39;ve never written math.<br/>

&gt; Had to LOL - a favorite car game is for DS to try to come up with a<br/>
&gt; number question that will stump me. He&#39;ll do things like &quot;What&#39;s 10x<br/>
&gt; 20+50-12?&quot; and I&#39;ll just calculate it out, generally, as he says it<br/>
&gt; (238). Sometimes he includes DH in to see which of us can get the answer<br/>
&gt; first (usually me lol). But, on occasion, when it&#39;s just a couple<br/>
&gt; numbers (10x3+15 for example), I&#39;ll say Well, where are the parenthesis<br/>
&gt; because that changes the answer - 10x3=30+15=45 OR 10x (3+15) is 10x18<br/>
&gt; which is 180. and so on - brief intros to the idea of order of<br/>
&gt; operations without having to call it that. On occasion, he&#39;s wanted to<br/>
&gt; see how that looks written out so we&#39;ll run through a few number<br/>
&gt; questions on the chalkboard at home (we painted a whole section of the<br/>
&gt; dining room/kitchen wall with chalkboard paint).<br/>
