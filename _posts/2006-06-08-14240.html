<div id="ygrps-yiv-173617618">Hi, All,<br/>
I just love this board!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today is the last day of prison - I mean school - for the <br/>
children in my area. When the kids and I were out, someone asked them if <br/>
they were excited about summer vacation.  And they just sort of stood <br/>
there kicking the dirt and finally my oldest says &quot;We homeschool&quot;.  So <br/>
then the lady turns to me and asks if we&#39;re &quot;taking a break&quot; for summer <br/>
and admitted that she wouldn&#39;t be able to teach her kids anything <br/>
because she would go nuts.  So then I am standing there with my mouth <br/>
hanging open too and kicking the dirt trying to find a way to say &quot;We <br/>
learn all the time and love it!&quot; but for some reason it wouldn&#39;t come <br/>
out of my mouth.  I think I ended up saying something to the effect that <br/>
&quot;no, we don&#39;t take a break&quot; and that I consider myself a facilitator, <br/>
not a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
This is the third time this has happened to me in the past 2 weeks and I <br/>
think I need to rehearse some joyfully delivered answers.  Certainly the <br/>
foot in my mouth is not cutting it! There are lots of school-at-homers <br/>
in my neck of the woods, so most of the people who have asked me about <br/>
it are not negative about homeschooling itself per se.  But they do <br/>
assume we do school work at home and stay on a school schedule, etc.  <br/>
Some of these people homeschool themselves and others don&#39;t.  I feel <br/>
like I should at least plant a seed in their mind but I never know where <br/>
to begin.  The questions come from a worldview that is so total alien to <br/>
our reality that I don&#39;t even know how to begin to answer.  And I guess <br/>
I am afraid of saying too much and freaking them out.  I&#39;ve noticed that <br/>
I never ever say the word &quot;unschool&quot; in front of anyone except other <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Or advice for a newbie?<br/>
<br/>

freedom from school- Yeehaw!)</div>

getting kids to do school homework - we do stuff the kids think is  <br/>
really fun and interesting.&quot;<br/>

I feel compelled to let people know unschooling exists! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I say, &quot; We unschool. It&#39;s a form of homeschooling. But it doesn&#39;t look <br/>
*any*thing like school!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I brought them out of school because I think school is emotionally, <br/>
spiritually, and educationally damaging to children. Why would I want <br/>
to do that at home? &quot; with a smile! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My children still *love* to learn. That&#39;s very important to me---to <br/>
keep that love of learning alive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they say, &quot;I could never do that!&quot;--- I say, &quot;You&#39;re right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;My kids would drive me crazy!&quot; ---I say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I <br/>
love to spend time with my boys: they&#39;re soooo interesting!&quot; and I give <br/>
a list of things they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling is about delving to passions---that&#39;s the only way to <br/>
learn!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Always with a big smile! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re new too (well, dd has been out of prison for a year now!).   <br/>
My standard answer when people ask (those who are just making <br/>
conversation and don&#39;t really care one way or the other) to &quot;so, <br/>
how&#39;s homeschooling going?&quot; - I say &quot;Great!&quot;.   The other comment <br/>
that drives me nuts is &quot;so, that must be really HARD for YOU!&quot; and, <br/>
depending on my mood, I&#39;ll say, &quot;not really&quot; or &quot;WHAT&#39;S hard? <br/>
(playing dumb)&quot;.   Generally I just keep it simple, I&#39;m not good at <br/>
spouting off yet about what unschooling is (like Kelly! and I don&#39;t <br/>
think you&#39;re scary at all!), and to be honest, most people don&#39;t <br/>
really care (or my friends who teach in schools would give me a <br/>
blank look because they&#39;re so brainwashed).   They <br/>
think &quot;homeschooling&quot; is radical enough.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite is &quot;it&#39;s GREAT that she can learn at her own pace!&quot; - no <br/>
need to go into details as far as I&#39;m concerned (and I like it that <br/>
way most of the time!).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I get this too.  Or the comment that goes, &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand to be<br/>
with my kids *all* day!&quot;  I usually reply, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to be<br/>
anywhere else!  I love my kids and love spending time with them and<br/>
sharing in their passions and exploration of the world.&quot;  I truly do<br/>
not understand why people have children if they are going to put them<br/>
in day care starting at 6 weeks, have them in preschool, at school all<br/>
day and then at after school care until 6pm and then to babysitters<br/>
and pawning them off to &quot;extracurricular activities&quot; all weekend.  Why<br/>
have kids if you can only stand to interact with them for 2 or 3 hours<br/>
a day???<br/>
<br/>
When asked if we are going to take a break I usually respond with,<br/>
&quot;How do you keep a child from learning?&quot; or &quot;Take a break from what?<br/>
We are learning all the time!&quot;  Of course for the uninitiated they<br/>
probably think that I have my kids at the table every day with tons of<br/>
workbooks and science fair experiments and going through volumes of<br/>
spelling words.  They probably think, &quot;Poor homeschooled kids.  They<br/>
just never get a break!&quot;  While my kids and I are thinking, &quot;Poor<br/>
schooled kids. They just never will understand what joy we find in all<br/>
this learning!&quot;  :-D<br/>
<br/>
I find that smiling and talking enthusiastically about all we do is<br/>
the best way to counter any questions.  It&#39;s sort of like what we tell<br/>
new nursing moms whose &quot;well-meaning family&quot; says, &quot;So is he sleeping<br/>
through the night?&quot;  You just smile and say, &quot;Oh he sleeps like an<br/>
angel and we are sleeping just fine.  How kind of you to be<br/>
concerned!&quot;<br/>

***Thanks all for those great responses.  I have been practicing my <br/>
comebacks all day - I think I just need to be ready for the question any <br/>
time, anywhere.  As it is, they seem to catch me off guard and then I <br/>
stand there like an idiot.  I want to be an unofficial unschooling <br/>
evangelist too!  Maybe if I make it down to Albuquerque, we can have an <br/>
unofficial unschooling evangelizing practice run on each other.<br/>
<br/>
The comments about not wanting to be with one&#39;s kids is really very <br/>
sad.  But I was thinking, most of these parents are coming from the <br/>
viewpoint that they will have to teach their kids boring stuff and <br/>
&quot;make&quot; them do it - all day, 5 days a week.  I would hate that too!  <br/>
What a way to ruin a relationship and suck the joy right out of life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374536161">If they say, &quot;I could never do that!&quot;--- I say, &quot;You&#39;re right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also say this with some explanation; &quot;You&#39;re right, if you think <br/>
that you would be duplicating school at home.  It&#39;s really not <br/>
necessary though, because school&#39;s structure must be scaled to handle <br/>
20 to 30 kids in a classroom.  You know how much a child can learn <br/>
with an individual tutor, right?  So, our learning is understandably <br/>
not structured after a classroom environment.  The learning happens in <br/>
many bits and pieces throughout the day.  I find that just being with <br/>
the children and just talking lots about what&#39;s on everybody&#39;s mind is <br/>
where the real value and joy is found.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Invariably, I get a knowing nod from the person I&#39;m with.  From the <br/>
responses I get from most people, I believe that they feel that they <br/>
have a better understanding of how learning can happen outside of <br/>
school without the burden of setting up a miniature classroom (I <br/>
realize that this is a drop in the bucket to understanding what we do, <br/>
but hey, you got to start somewheres).  I also hope to leave them with <br/>
a nugget of hope that they too, could homeschool their children. I <br/>
think when I include the word joy in there, this kind of throws folks <br/>
a bit.  I&#39;d venture that they are thinking, &quot;Learning is work.  Where <br/>
is this joy thing coming from?&quot; But, I also think that this is <br/>
somewhat compelling to them.  Sometimes they will enquire more about <br/>
what we do if they get enough warm fuzzies and don&#39;t feel threatened.<br/>
<br/>
The wording in my response is always somewhat different, of course.  I <br/>
am now trying to be careful not to use the word teach and rephrase <br/>
things to utilize the word learner as much as possible.  I&#39;m hoping, <br/>
by using unschoolish wording without calling out unschooling directly, <br/>
that the person can experience the shift in thinking while not feeling <br/>
alienated.<br/>
<br/>
Any response is colored by the other person&#39;s openness though.  <br/>
Sometimes, I just change the subject.  I admit, other times I am not <br/>
in a good enough mood to be patient and am more direct or even <br/>
impish.  When I am patient though, it is interesting seeing a glimmer <br/>
of understanding in people&#39;s eyes, especially when I take the time to <br/>
build a bridge from their view of the world to an unschooling world.<br/>
