<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059077313">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and currently living in Florida.  We are moving to<br/>
Iowa in a couple of months to live on a small farm near my brother.<br/>
Iowa seems to have a lot more regulations on homeschooling than Florida<br/>
does.  If anyone in the group is from Iowa, I could use some tips.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By the way, my family is now pressuring me to put my kids in public<br/>
school because Iowa schools are the best in the country!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Luana<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950695258">Hi Luana,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not in Iowa, but can offer you some things about<br/>
the schools.<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Iowa my entire time I was in public<br/>
schools.  I wouldn&#39;t put my kids in school there. <br/>
There are just as many problems in schools there, as<br/>
there is every where else.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Michigan, in a smaller town.  We were told<br/>
that the school system my kids were in, was the best. <br/>
We had tons of problems here, that nobody wanted to<br/>
address, and so we finally pulled the kids out of<br/>
school last year, they are 9 and 11.  We are still<br/>
deschooling, and I am finding out more stuff that I<br/>
never new ( and I have been really active in the kids<br/>
lives) about, because they never told me.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, if you are happy with<br/>
homeschooling, then I would stick with it.  I had some<br/>
pressure from friends, and some family members, about<br/>
leaving my kids in public schools, but did what I<br/>
fealt was best for my kids.  They are so much more<br/>
happier, and feel safer, and feel free.  I only wish I<br/>
would&#39;ve know about homeschooling sooner.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know Iowa laws, but you can looking it up on<br/>
the internet.  I loved living in Iowa, and me and the<br/>
kids visit there quite often, in fact we are heading<br/>
there in less that two weeks, to spend 5 weeks with my<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and good luck with your move.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The best of something bad for kids doesn&#39;t make it good!<br/>
<br/>
By what standards are they judging &quot;best&quot;? Someone has determined the  <br/>
goal and developed an assessment of how well schools are meeting that  <br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the goal?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the assessment?<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is doing well on achievement tests, is that *your* goal  <br/>
for your kids? Do you want a process that will turn your kids into  <br/>
whizzes at taking a particular standardized test?<br/>
<br/>
Then you should seek out the school that does that really well.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about living happy, rich lives full of freedom. If  <br/>
that&#39;s the goal there isn&#39;t a single school in the US doing as well  <br/>
as an unschooling home. In that case, unschooling is the best.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the problem with words like best and good. They&#39;re an  <br/>
assessment of how well something is performing to someone&#39;s  <br/>
standards. When people talk about good and best and bad and worst, we  <br/>
can get caught in the trap of thinking that we&#39;re all talking about  <br/>
the same foundation of standards. We all know what a good child is,  <br/>
don&#39;t we? But an authoritarian parent might think a good child is an  <br/>
obedient child. They might think the best method of parenting is a  <br/>
spanking done without anger.<br/>
<br/>
So what do they mean by &quot;best&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179820208">Iowa Schools are more strict a lot more strict then most states.  I actually looked at moving there and decided not too cause of the homeschooling laws.  Cant remeber all of them but it is an easy search on the net.   My parents live there and homeschooled my sister.  They had to use a curriculiam and constantly had to have someone in there...    I cant remember everything.  But I will say they did quit homeschooling and my sis went to the PS system there and she hated it.  It was very clicky and to top it off when she graduated after she had atttended there for 3 years the supertendent mispronounced her name....   Sarai (sara+ i) pretty hard name lol......   We live in Kansas and the laws here are awesome.  I personally dont want anyting more strict because this is what we are used too...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635993558">Luana, we travel to Iowa regularly, and so I joined a list that I  <br/>
just mostly peruse occasionally for ideas on what to do when we&#39;re  <br/>
there, but I know that they address your type of question there  <br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
The list is IAUnschoolers, and here&#39;s the link:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889368217">Maybe I&#39;m having a sun stroke - it&#39;s almost eighty degrees here and that&#39;s <br/>
hot for Montany.<br/>
But since I read the subject line I have that song from &quot;State Fair&quot; stuck <br/>
in my head, &quot;All I Owe Iowa&quot;  or was it &quot;Ioway?&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about schooling or unschooling there but I do know <br/>
you&#39;ll be good and gosh-darn sorry when you go. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis, back to diggin&#39; in the weed patch, singing, &quot; I owe Iowa all I <br/>
owe and I know why.<br/>
I am Iowa born and bred, and on Iowa corn I&#39;m fed,<br/>
Not to mention her barley, wheat, and rye!&quot;<br/>

PS. Yeah, it must be sun stroke.</div>
