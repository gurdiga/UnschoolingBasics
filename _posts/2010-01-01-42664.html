<div id="ygrps-yiv-14333405">I wish more people understood unschooling and that it was more accepted. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I get tired of the kids being asked, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; when we are out in town.  At one point I was more patient with answers, but it seems that people are being more &quot;pushy&quot; with their questions and I am getting tired of having my kids cross examined by strangers and even well meaning friends at times.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you do or how do you handle these questions when faced with them?  I think I am in need of a fresh approach to it.  :)<br/>

I tell people Mo&#39;s age - I can never remember what grade she&#39;s in, I only look at that form once a year. Right now, if someone asks, she says &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled&quot; and then refers the asker to me. Since I don&#39;t consider it anyone else&#39;s business I keep things short. The most I&#39;ve ever said is &quot;it varies by subject&quot;. I&#39;m also a fan of the &quot;bean dip&quot; ploy - changing the subject, I mean, as in: &quot;we&#39;re all doing great, pass the bean dip&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If someone other than a random stranger wants to talk home/unschooling with me, I try to get a sense of what they want. Most of the time, people just want to connect and what they know, when talking to kids in school, is &quot;what grade are you in&quot; and &quot;what is your favorite subject?&quot; So it helps family and friends if I &quot;prime&quot; them a little with stories of what my kids are into and enjoy. Blogs and now Facebook are handy for that, the relatives can see what the highlights are and have starter questions and comments like &quot;So, what are you building these days, Mo?&quot; and &quot;Hey, new forge! Did you find a source for coal yet, Ray?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This last trip to visit relatives I talked a lot about food, actually, since Mo&#39;s at the age where kids usually have lost the conservatism of the earlier years, but still have a predictable group of foods that most adults can offer. I didn&#39;t want Grandma or Aunty to be heartbroken when Mo turned down home made mac-n-cheese (but kids Always eat my mac-n-cheese) or noodle soup. I didn&#39;t approach those conversations as being about unschooling, though, but in terms of &quot;Mo&#39;s needs are a little different, here&#39;s what I do.&quot; And from there, if asked, I&#39;d go into why, but only if asked. <br/>

It might help to brainstorm some standard replies your kids can use. If they&#39;re frustrated by not knowing what &quot;grade&quot; they&#39;re in, give &#39;em a number to tell people. If they&#39;re being quizzed on &quot;skills&quot; or &quot;facts&quot; they can use the strategy school kids use - variations of: &quot;I know, but I&#39;m not in school right now, so I don&#39;t have to say&quot;. George got that at an xmas party not long ago - he&#39;s used to being able to say &quot;hey kids check it out&quot; and our kids will look at whatever goofiness he&#39;s come up with and be at least a little intersted. Well, the schooled kid he was trying to show a new gizmo to replied &quot;I know what and I know why&quot; and walked away. You could suggest your kids use something similar. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve stepped in when people cross examine Mo because she tends to shut down if she&#39;s pushed too much - actually put my body in between her and the adult and say &quot;its not our homeschool time&quot; or &quot;I think she&#39;s ready for a break&quot; or whatever comes to mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268834869">Thanks!  Those are great ideas.  :)<br/>
I actually prepped the girls this year before we went to town after public school started, so they would at least have an answer to the grade level. <br/>
<br/>
I was just joking with hubby this afternoon about answering the next person with, &quot;oh they don&#39;t go to school, we just let them run and do whatever they like&quot;  LOL!!!!  (I love to cut up, so we had a big laugh at the reaction that would get.  hahaha)  The extra funny part to it is that is exactly what they do.  :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526818863">And what would be so horrible about the truth? :)<br/>
<br/>
My answers have varied from a smile and simple &quot;oh, we homeschool&quot; to &quot;Grades? No, we don&#39;t have to fiddle with any of that nonsense. We are homeschoolers.&quot; What do they study? &quot;Whatever they are interested in. I just try to keep up.&quot; No testing? No curriculum? &quot;No, thank goodness. What a waste that would be.&quot; And if the person is not happy, I still have walking away with a smile, with happy kids clearly enjoying their lives.<br/>
<br/>
People may not understand, or want to understand, the word unschooling. But they can and do understand the wastefulness of a lot of what goes on in school and they can and do understand kids clearly enjoying themselves.<br/>
<br/>
And if that ticks them off, the heck with them. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270669601">Im glad that you asked this question because this happens to me all the time. I have a 6yr old son and a 4yr old daughter. People ALWAYS ask my son what grade he is in. He replies &quot; Im homeschooled&quot; Most people just get a strange look on their face and say something like &quot;oh&quot; or &quot;I see&quot; and then I just try and talk about something else. Last week I had a woman ask my daughter if she was in Pre-K or head start or some other program I can&#39;t remember. Abby looked at the lady like she was crazy and then shot her glance to me.. I just told the woman we are homeschoolers and then quickly left. I was even a little suprised at the question just for the fact that I had forgotten that kids really go off to programs like that at such a young age. I can&#39;t imagine sending my little girl off all day or even half a day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98455366">I say we homeschool, but my 7 year old, if she&#39;s in earshot, will  <br/>
correct me and say we unschool to which I usually get more questions.   <br/>
If someone asks the kids when I&#39;m not right there they tend to say  <br/>
stuff like, &quot;We don&#39;t do anything except play.  We don&#39;t do any school  <br/>
stuff.&quot;  Usually I&#39;m not too far away and will get quizzical looks or  <br/>
more questions or something then I end up laughing, explain more if  <br/>
pushed or do the bean dip thing or amazingly enough someone always  <br/>
needs me so I get distracted helping someone.  I&#39;d really like for the  <br/>
kids to say something more like we&#39;re autodidactic or something other  <br/>
than &quot;we do nothing&quot; but they don&#39;t understand how others might be  <br/>
affected by it.  Most times I don&#39;t care and keep going but in my  <br/>
current position I have to be more careful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644226005">My 10 year old I guess has learned a bit from me lol! <br/>
<br/>
Having a severly autistic son means we can&#39;t do things normally most of the time . The other day ( and it won&#39;t be the first time by a long shot) my son was in the basket with no shoes on and an older lady decides to give me a talking to for not having any shoes on my son in such freezing cold weather. i could stress about it or try to defend myself letting her know that I never let those bare feet touch the ground. In one breath I simply said my severly autistic son has a habbit of taking of his shoes and hurling them at peoples head so for the saftey of others around us I leave them in the car...oh I love that pin where did you get it &lt;girn&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So now my 10 year old tends to give people the absolute truth. School? oh I don&#39;t go anymore I&#39;ve found it to be a complete waste of my time .<br/>

I do love to get into the more detailed parts--like the waste of time-- and even explain we &quot;loosely homeschool&quot;.  :)  I even set things up as year around with the school district and other who inquire so they can understand why we have so much &quot;free time&quot; out of &quot;school&quot;.  (rolling eyes here to even have to use those words)  laughing!  I hate to have to talk the talk just to please others.  I am too much of a rebel for it, I guess. :)<br/>

&gt; People may not understand, or want to understand, the word unschooling. But they can and do understand the wastefulness of a lot of what goes on in school and they can and do understand kids clearly enjoying themselves.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I actually prepped the girls this year before we went to town after public school started, so they would at least have an answer to the grade level. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686751715">Dawn, that is exactly what can be so challenging.  I&#39;ve had my kids do this too and boy oh boy did I have to do some talking.  I did learn fast to explain that *everything* we do is learning and then gave examples.  It is amazing to see how people light up when they realize that living is learning!  laughing!  We live in an area that is homeschool friendly, but also they have been known to make that call and get CPS involved if they don&#39;t think you are doing what is considered &quot;schooling&quot; in their opinions.  I can relate to having to be careful.  :)<br/>

&gt; I say we homeschool, but my 7 year old, if she&#39;s in earshot, will  <br/>
&gt; correct me and say we unschool to which I usually get more questions.   <br/>
&gt; If someone asks the kids when I&#39;m not right there they tend to say  <br/>
&gt; stuff like, &quot;We don&#39;t do anything except play.  We don&#39;t do any school  <br/>
&gt; stuff.&quot;  Usually I&#39;m not too far away and will get quizzical looks or  <br/>
&gt; more questions or something then I end up laughing, explain more if  <br/>
&gt; pushed or do the bean dip thing or amazingly enough someone always  <br/>
&gt; needs me so I get distracted helping someone.  I&#39;d really like for the  <br/>
&gt; kids to say something more like we&#39;re autodidactic or something other  <br/>
&gt; than &quot;we do nothing&quot; but they don&#39;t understand how others might be  <br/>
&gt; affected by it.  Most times I don&#39;t care and keep going but in my  <br/>
&gt; current position I have to be more careful.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I wish more people understood unschooling and that it was more  <br/>
&gt; &gt; accepted. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I get tired of the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; kids being asked, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; when we are out in town.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; At one point I was more patient with answers, but it seems that  <br/>
&gt; &gt; people are being more &quot;pushy&quot; with their questions and I am getting  <br/>
&gt; &gt; tired of having my kids cross examined by strangers and even well  <br/>
&gt; &gt; meaning friends at times.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you do or how do you handle these questions when faced with  <br/>
&gt; &gt; them? I think I am in need of a fresh approach to it. :)<br/>

LOL!!!  I love it!  And it is oh so true!  ~A<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My 10 year old I guess has learned a bit from me lol!  <br/>
&gt; Having a severly autistic son means we can&#39;t do things normally most of the time . The other day ( and it won&#39;t be the first time by a long shot) my son was in the basket with no shoes on and an older lady decides to give me a talking to for not having any shoes on my son in such freezing cold weather. i could stress about it or try to defend myself letting her know that I never let those bare feet touch the ground. In one breath I simply said my severly autistic son has a habbit of taking of his shoes and hurling them at peoples head so for the saftey of others around us I leave them in the car...oh I love that pin where did you get it &lt;girn&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now my 10 year old tends to give people the absolute truth. School? oh I don&#39;t go anymore I&#39;ve found it to be a complete waste of my time .<br/>
