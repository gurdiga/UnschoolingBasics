<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694786348">I have a friend who ives in New York who has a bad<br/>
situation on his hands. He just found out he&#39;s a dad<br/>
(DNA test came back conclusive) to a beautiful 5 year<br/>
old girl. The mom brought the daughter to his<br/>
apartment and stayed for a few days so that the<br/>
daughter could meet her dad. Then after a few days,<br/>
the mom announces that she needs some time, and will<br/>
be back in a few days... leaving the daughter with the<br/>
dad.<br/>
<br/>
The dad is 21, in law school, and a bachelor...<br/>
needless to say he&#39;s freaking out. He has no social<br/>
ecurity number for his daughter, no birth certificate,<br/>
nothing.. and he can&#39;t reach the mother. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if New York allows philosopical<br/>
exemption on vaccinations? Or what he would need to do<br/>
to go about getting a copy of her birth certificate or<br/>
issued a social security card? He&#39;s keeping his<br/>
fingers crossed that the mom will be back in a few<br/>
days... but he&#39;s also trying to prepare for the<br/>
possibility that mom may not be back at all, or not<br/>
for a long while.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090062412">I don&#39;t live in NY and don&#39;t know the answers to any of your questions, either, however it strikes me that -- oops just realized he&#39;s in law school -- that he should get legal counsel asap.   Who knows what this mom might do or say if and when she returns?  Seems to me any mom who could do what she&#39;s already done, could also leave for a year or two or three -- and then come back and demand the child or make who-knows-what claim against the dad.  Or, alternatively, to come back in 3 days, take the child, and never come back so that he loses contact with his new-found daughter.  So to have some sort of legal record of what happened might be good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>New York only has religious exemption for vaccines.  AND no one can ask what <br/>
religion you are. This comes up as an issue is if she is going to <br/>
school/preschool or camp.  A simple letter stating that &quot;per NY State <br/>
law/regulation (google exact name or number) we do not vaccinate for <br/>
religious reasons&quot; is sufficient.  If  anyone asks what religion he can <br/>
respectfully decline to answer informing the person asking that they really <br/>
are not allowed to ask that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or what he would need to do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to go about getting a copy of her birth certificate or<br/>
&gt;issued a social security card?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t know how someone other than legal parent of record can request this <br/>
information.  sounds like he may need some legal advice himself.<br/>

I think birth certificate data is public record, along with marriage<br/>
data, real estate transactions, etc. He&#39;d need to know where the birth<br/>
certificate was filed (where the child was born) and then check with<br/>
their town/county records office. There&#39;s usually a small processing fee<br/>
to get a duplicate birth certificate (or any other paperwork).<br/>
 <br/>
Then again, I could be totally wrong.<br/>
