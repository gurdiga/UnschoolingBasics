<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558676520">I know many of you are thinking of the Jenners, even if you don&#39;t know<br/>
them personally and I wanted to pass this new information along...<br/>
There has been an email list set up specifically for organizing help<br/>
over the next two years as Hannah is treated with chemo.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to join, it&#39;s open to everyone (but Diana and family)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DianaHelp/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DianaHelp/</a><br/>
<br/>
So if it&#39;s in your heart to help, feel free to join. There is talk of<br/>
setting up a webpage of items for sale that will be donated to them.<br/>
So people like me that are short on money right now, can make things<br/>
and help.  Anyway, come on over if you&#39;d like to get involved or keep<br/>
up on the plans.:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>
