<div id="ygrps-yiv-248773127">My mother most recently decided to drill my five year old on arithmetic while she watched <br/>
him for us one day, without me knowing. The next day, my dh tells me my mother called and <br/>
told him to bring my son over the next day so she can teach him math. She believes he <br/>
should know this stuff by now. *Sigh* I&#39;m not sure how to approach the situation. I&#39;d like to <br/>
explain what we are doing but then I think why should I? <br/>
Even though I know she means well. I still feel sort of disrespected because she seems to be <br/>
going behind my back to do what she thinks is best for my son. I&#39;m a very introverted person <br/>
and I don&#39;t like confrontations but I&#39;d really like to get her to step back. She knows we&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling but not unschoolling and a while back I asked her to stop questioning me <br/>
about our choice which she has done but now this happens.<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions or has anyone handled this situation before?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109956657">Just like teaching anything else we need to educate the people in our<br/>
children&#39;s lives this is more difficult because they must unlearn all the<br/>
things that they believe in. I would simply tell anyone who thinks that my<br/>
son needs to learn something that he is busy learning other things right now<br/>
and math isn&#39;t as important as those things right now in his life. If you<br/>
would like more information on my philosophy of teaching I can recommend a<br/>
few good books or websites to you.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing to remember is that your child&#39;s grandparents are<br/>
doing what they think is best because they love your child not because they<br/>
want to irritate you. When many of us started homeschooling or unschooling<br/>
we didn&#39;t truly &quot;get it&quot; either. It has only been through the information<br/>
and support of this group that I remember to let go and let my child be a<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
If she truly wants to teach him math maybe the two of you can compromise?<br/>
Maybe baking with Grandma and they could work on making a recipe larger or<br/>
smaller. A practical application that would be fun and make Grandma happy<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want her to back off then I would tell her as unemotionally as<br/>
possible that you understand that she is doing what she believes is best but<br/>
that until she has educated herself on the philosophy of learning that you<br/>
have chosen, she needs to not concern herself with his learning and just be<br/>
content being a Grandmother who loves and spoils her grandkids. <br/>
