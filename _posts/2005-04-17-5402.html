<div id="ygrps-yiv-935345191">Evelyn I went through the same feeling when I started unschooling my<br/>
kids; Jon 17 and Ethan 14. They too, felt like they were doing something<br/>
they shouldnt be doing because they had been in public school all their<br/>
lives. We heard this from other members of our family as well. After<br/>
awhile when some system is around for such a long time and a majority of<br/>
people are doing it, it does seem like the &quot;only and right thing to do.&quot;<br/>
Unschooling saved my sons life. Too long a story to go into except to<br/>
say he has dyslexia and the school decided they couldnt help him so they<br/>
basically stopped helping him in 3rd grade. I feel, as a mom watching<br/>
his torment, that I did what any individual would do that cared. I got<br/>
him away from the source that was injuring him even when it wasnt &quot;cool&quot;<br/>
with others. <br/>
I think we all go through a process of unschooling ourselves and letting<br/>
go of old patterns of thoughts so we can move on. Like any other change,<br/>
it has had its difficult moments. For the most part, including my sons<br/>
life:) it has been wonderful. <br/>
