<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340125407">&quot;I&#39;m reassured by it and will<br/>
continue to read the Harry Potter books to my son snuggled on the couch<br/>
together with the promise that he will read them to me when he is<br/>
ready and<br/>
able to!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or not. But he&#39;ll have the ability to do that one day!!:)<br/>
Neither of my older boys read novels right now, but they could if they<br/>
wanted to. And they have the ability to read to me, but they don&#39;t.<br/>
It&#39;s just not something they enjoy.<br/>
Well, other than snippets from games or friends.<br/>
