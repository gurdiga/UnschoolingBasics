<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592301">My DS (20 months) has always said &quot;OW&quot; when he was hurting somebody. He has reached <br/>
a point where it is more the gesture than the actual hurting. It used to be a combination of <br/>
scratching and hitting usually on the face. I came to RU boards for advice when this <br/>
started and was told to say &quot;OW&quot; (thus where he got it from). And things like &quot;that hurts&quot; <br/>
and &quot;I dont like being hurt&quot;. This was probably getting close to a year ago when it started. <br/>
But now he kind of just says OW and hits your face, but doesnt (usually!) actually hurt me <br/>
or whoever it is. <br/>
<br/>
I have found there are many motivations behind it. Sometimes its anger, like another child <br/>
steals something he had or wont hand over something he wants for example). A lot of <br/>
times its a need to physically connect with someone. And often its just a physical <br/>
boisterous kind of release. More rarely its about attention. And other times its kind of hard <br/>
to work out what prompted it but have ruled out the others. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously just saying that hurts etc hasnt been working for us. I have tried A LOT of <br/>
things, all the while trying to maintain respect for my son the whole time. I have given him <br/>
lots of indoor physical toys to give him an outlet for that (like hammer pegs- sword <br/>
fighting etc). I try to intervene whenever I see that &quot;look&quot; when he&#39;s interacting with <br/>
someone else, but he tends to then redirect it at me and apart from physically holding <br/>
both hands back (which upsets him/makes him madder) I havent found a way to stop it in <br/>
the moment. Lately the thing we have been mostly doing is saying &quot;______ doesnt like <br/>
OW&#39;s&quot; and then talking about other things said person DOES like, Hi-5&#39;s, tickles, and other <br/>
physical things which are fun for him to do. It sometimes works after the first OW and <br/>
changes his mood. Sometimes the only thing which &#39;works&#39; is just removing him. <br/>
<br/>
Im at my wits end with the whole thing. Am I handling things &quot;right&quot;? Is there any other <br/>
things people could suggest for stopping it before it happens or immediately after. Its <br/>
mostly pretty hard to know when he is going to do it because even if he has a reason for it, <br/>
its within him until released in the OW- if that makes sense. Just looking for some ideas <br/>
on this as it is reaching the point where even Im starting to think he needs some more <br/>
&#39;discipline&#39;. I&#39;ve thought of doing something like a time in, as in I would pick him up and <br/>
remove him from the room immediately, but I see no way that this would have any effect <br/>
as he is always with me anyway. And how does it &#39;teach&#39; anything unless I attached a rule <br/>
to it that he couldnt go back or lectured him on what he did or something, neither of <br/>
which seems right to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to disagree with you, there! Because you also said:<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or whoever it is. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Change is happening. Its just happening more slowly than you&#39;d <br/>
like ;) Some kids are really into putting their hands in other <br/>
people&#39;s faces. Its some kind of strange, basic impulse. Its <br/>
something they eventually grow out of, but in the meantime the <br/>
priority is to keep people from being hurt. If he&#39;s not hurting <br/>
that&#39;s Great!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m betting that the need to both connect and express himself <br/>
physically are the biggest underlying motivations. He doesn&#39;t have <br/>
very many skills yet - even though I&#39;m sure he seems to have more all <br/>
the time, he&#39;s still pretty little. So going for a face is an <br/>
attractive way to communicate because its effective. It get someone&#39;s <br/>
attention and gets a response. <br/>
<br/>
Since he&#39;s drawn to faces in this way, you might want to create some <br/>
special games or ways to play together that are all about faces. Can <br/>
he stroke your face? Is there something he can rub on your face, like <br/>
lotion - lanolin maybe (nice and safe around the eyes)? Brushing your <br/>
hair might be good, too. That might help to &quot;fill him up&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>
able to explore other ways of communicating.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A certain amount of the problem is sheer inability to control his own <br/>
behavior. Its totally possible that - Right Now - once he starts an <br/>
action he can&#39;t stop it even if he wanted to. That&#39;s not something <br/>
you can solve quickly, its a developmental issue. You can help by <br/>
finding ways for him to use his hands delicately and gently so that <br/>
he builds up some better control over his body, but there&#39;s no <br/>
overnight fix.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds good to me - good idea to talk about what the other person <br/>
does like, too. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sometimes the only thing which &#39;works&#39; is just removing him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes. He&#39;s not even 2 yet. Still a lot of learning to do - <br/>
communication skills, physical skills, impulse control, empathy, <br/>
patience.... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im starting to think he needs some more <br/>
&gt; &#39;discipline&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know a family where the dd pokes people in the face for all the <br/>
same sorts of reasons you listed above. They discipline her for it <br/>
(time out) but it has never once, that I know of, stopped her from <br/>
doing it. She&#39;s nine, and I&#39;ve seen her slowly start to grow out of <br/>
it, but she still sometimes pokes if she&#39;s really curious or trying <br/>
to get someone&#39;s attention. It really is an impulse she can&#39;t fully <br/>
control yet.<br/>
