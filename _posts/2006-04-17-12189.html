<div id="ygrps-yiv-273258392">That&#39;s what I heard last night as I was cooking dinner.  We have a friend<br/>
Emily&#39;s age visiting us from Mobile this weekend.  She&#39;s a delight to have<br/>
(another unschooler).  Last night I was baking focaccia and making<br/>
spaghetti.  Our friend walked into my kitchen and said, &quot;Oh, your house<br/>
smells like Ren&#39;s!&quot;  I cocked my head not knowing if this was a good thing<br/>
or a bad thing so asked.  She said, &quot;Oh all the herbs. It smells like Ren&#39;s<br/>
kitchen when she cooks.&quot;  I found that funny because I always associate tea<br/>
smells with Ren&#39;s kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
I miss you Ren and your smelly kitchen!<br/>
