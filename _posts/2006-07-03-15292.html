<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863564236">So here&#39;s a real life example of one of the issues I&#39;m struggling with.  Any<br/>
advice of a kinder gentler way?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Problem - dd wants me to play with her all the time.  Once we start playing,<br/>
she doesn&#39;t want a break for potty, eating, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Scenario:  This morning I was playing with dd.  We&#39;d been playing a variety<br/>
of things for nearing 2 hrs.  We made our way to our new office library and<br/>
were playing in there.  I saw a box of books that I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>
shelve for months now.  It was only about 2 shelves worth and would take<br/>
less than 5 min, so I thought while we&#39;re in here playing I&#39;ll go ahead and<br/>
shelve the books.  So while dd was preoccupied gathering markers and<br/>
pretending it was food I started shelving the books.  A minute later dd<br/>
says, &quot;do you like what I drew mom?&quot;  she had scribbled on the carpet with<br/>
one of the markers.  (This is not the first time this has happened with her<br/>
drawing on something she&#39;s not supposed to to get my attention.  Once while<br/>
she was coloring at the coffee table I left to go to the bathroom, as I was<br/>
coming out she came towards me saying, &quot;come see what I drew mom&quot;.  She&#39;d<br/>
scribbled all over the table.)  But, that&#39;s another scenario.  In this<br/>
scenario she wasn&#39;t drawing with the markers at the time, but using them as<br/>
a prop in her imaginary scene.  So anyway, I told her we were going to need<br/>
to clean that up and we headed off to get supplies.  As we walked I asked<br/>
her why she had drawn on the floor, she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t have any paper.&quot;  I<br/>
reminded her about the paper in the art cabinet (in the same room) and not<br/>
to draw on the carpet.  She started cleaning it up and I went back to<br/>
putting the books away. (My fatal mistake, I now realize.. I probably should<br/>
have stopped then and helped her clean).  So while I was finishing up,<br/>
instead of cleaning she got more markers and drew even more.  A minute later<br/>
when I found that she&#39;d drawn more.  I became much more agitated.  Since we<br/>
had just talked about this.  I did pick her up and hug her, and told her<br/>
that if she wants my attention of for me to play with her that she needs to<br/>
tell me with her words not her actions.  She spotted a book she was<br/>
interested in and asked to read it while we were cleaning up.  I told her we<br/>
could read it after we cleaned it up.  She got upset and started asking to<br/>
nurse.  Again I told her after we finished cleaning.  I also told her that<br/>
when we have to take time to clean up writing on the floor that means it<br/>
takes longer before I can play with her, read her book, have &quot;nummies&quot;, etc.<br/>
After it was cleaned as best as it could, we read the story (twice) and<br/>
nursed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So here are my questions.  First of all, was that responding respectfully,<br/>
or was there different I should have done.  Second, how can I get her to not<br/>
do destructive things when I can&#39;t give her my attention?  We starting to<br/>
plan on expanding on our family, and I&#39;m concerned about how she&#39;s going to<br/>
act when I need to give my attention to a baby.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821086602">How old is your dd? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming between 2-4 since she is going potty and nursing.  At her <br/>
age she is much to little to expect to clean up a marker mess IMO.  I <br/>
think she is acting pretty typical.  At this age she wants to be with <br/>
you constantly.  Cherish it...soon they don&#39;t!!  All 3 of my kiddos <br/>
are off doing their own things right now.   I don&#39;t think she is at <br/>
the maturity of understanding not do color certain places with <br/>
markers.  To her they are for creating.  For fun!!  She thinks she is <br/>
doing something cool not something bad.  I think you needed to be a <br/>
little more observant at what she was up to and if you don&#39;t want <br/>
marker messes don&#39;t have them out for her to play with as imaginary <br/>
food. Get blocks or something else.  <br/>
<br/>
Also washable markers are a great investment!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230529828">Hi Misty. I hear your frustration. Your daughter is 2.5, right? I think <br/>
maybe you&#39;re expecting a little too much from her in terms of 1) <br/>
understanding 2) compliance and 3) self-control<br/>
<br/>
I my experience, most two year olds don&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; that it&#39;s not <br/>
okay to draw on stuff other than paper. Maybe your DD really does know, <br/>
but the appeal in the moment of drawing on the carpet was too strong to <br/>
deter her. So to attribute to her actions that she did it &quot;to get your <br/>
attention&quot; may not in fact be the case.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d supervise when a kid this age is using markers, or make sure she is <br/>
in a place where it doesn&#39;t matter if she goes off the paper. Washable <br/>
markers are great. They really do wash out of stuff I&#39;ve found.<br/>
<br/>
Two year olds aren&#39;t good at being patient and waiting until after a <br/>
task is completed to start something else. Delayed gratification just <br/>
isn&#39;t their cup of tea. If they want to play with you, they want it <br/>
now. If they want to nurse they want it now. You wanted to finish what <br/>
you were doing without interruption, but with a kid this age -- and <br/>
even older -- that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>
<br/>
Try to really *be* with her when she&#39;s drawing or playing and save the <br/>
other organizational stuff for when she&#39;s napping. There are times when <br/>
she will play contentedly by herself too. You&#39;ll know the difference in <br/>
her moods. This just wasn&#39;t one of those moments. She wanted to engage <br/>
you, yes, but that&#39;s probably not why she drew on the carpet. KWIM? She <br/>
was probably just proud of her drawing and wanted to share it with you.<br/>
<br/>
I probably would have not left my dd alone with the markers at that <br/>
age, but if she did draw on something -- and she has -- I&#39;d have said <br/>
neutrally, &quot;I&#39;m going to get a damp rag to clean that up.&quot; and just <br/>
started cleaning it. If she wanted to help me clean, cool, if not, <br/>
that&#39;s okay too. I have also said something like, &quot;Let&#39;s not draw on <br/>
the bannister from now on. Let&#39;s just draw on paper.&quot; No shaming, no <br/>
yelling, no long lecture. (Not that you did that.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes two year olds can be pretty sophisticated verbally, and this <br/>
leads us to think that they should &quot;know better&quot; when they engage in <br/>
certain activities that aren&#39;t to our liking. But I&#39;ve found that it <br/>
takes a lot of patient repetition for the concepts to really sink in. <br/>
And I don&#39;t mean lecturing, that would never fly with my DD, I mean, &quot;I <br/>
see you&#39;re getting out a box of markers, let me get you some paper. <br/>
Let&#39;s make a card for daddy!&quot; And just make sure that she sees over and <br/>
over that markers and paper go together like pb and j.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30194448">Hi, Misty,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one of the veterans on this list, but I&#39;ll throw in my 2 cents since <br/>
I have been &quot;letting go&quot; of these things lately.<br/>
<br/>
I think looking at the environment might be better than looking at your <br/>
daughter&#39;s behavior at this age. My 2-ish year old son loves drawing on all <br/>
things except paper so I try to have lots of paper around. He would never go <br/>
into a cabinet for paper if he wanted to draw, though, so I try to have lots <br/>
of little stacks of paper in his room (he has a little table with <br/>
markers/crayons/paper) and I always seem to have scraps of paper around the <br/>
house, too (usually blank envelopes from junk mail - reduce, reuse, recycle, <br/>
ya know?).<br/>
<br/>
I also love washable markers and crayons. In fact, they are the only ones I <br/>
buy. Even when he draws on paper, there are often accidents where he runs <br/>
off the paper and onto the floors or table, or accidentally hits the wall <br/>
with one while he&#39;s walking around, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my son also gets frustrated with me at certain times if I try to do <br/>
something with house work or my business while we&#39;re playing. That&#39;s often a <br/>
signal to me to keep playing with him and wait on the other stuff. Usually <br/>
if I stop and think about it, the thing I&#39;m choosing to work on is something <br/>
that can wait. There are also times when I can get away with a few minutes <br/>
here and there of short spurts of work. There are also times when I know I <br/>
cannot get any work done. I&#39;m confident these times will pass.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605840617">You don&#39;t sound like much of a multi-tasker, Misty.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you had your FULL attention on the books you were  <br/>
shelving and completely lost touch with what she was doing, right?  <br/>
Even if just for a couple of minutes?<br/>
<br/>
Some people could shelve books and watch their little one at the same  <br/>
time - but it seems like the lesson for you to learn in this scenario  <br/>
is that you aren&#39;t able to do things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Know thyself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398220968">Hi everyone,<br/>
here is something I have been struggling with for the<br/>
last couple of weeks. I had decided that I would try<br/>
letting my 4 y.o. son watch anything he wanted on TV<br/>
at any time. The only thing that works on that TV is<br/>
video or DVD, no regular channels, but we have plenty<br/>
of the above. So, my 4 y.o. has been doing pretty well<br/>
with the self-regulating. He watches on average about<br/>
1-2 videos a day. Many days he would not think of<br/>
watching because he would rather do other stuff like<br/>
play or read - Now in comes his little brother, 22<br/>
months old. A few months ago I had put the TV away for<br/>
a bit so that he would not watch any, then pull out<br/>
the TV for the oder one when the younger one was<br/>
napping or had gone to bed. I had done that since the<br/>
movies that the 4 y.o. wanted to watch would stress<br/>
out my little one too much. <br/>
Now that the TV is in the open again, the little one<br/>
wants to watch it almost all the time. He can easily<br/>
go from one movie to another without anything else<br/>
that would interest him. Before he would like to sit<br/>
down with a book or pretend-cook or help me in the<br/>
kitchen or with the laundry - now the only thing that<br/>
keeps him away from the TV is going outside and<br/>
sometimes painting. Now that it is summer I try to<br/>
take him out as much as possible, but it seems to me<br/>
he still watches too much for his age. I remember<br/>
reading that kids under 2 should not watch any. So<br/>
now, how do I respect his wishes of really wanting to<br/>
watch badly, his health, and than the wished of his<br/>
brother who can&#39;t concetrate on playing if the TV is<br/>
on all the time.  He does not like to watch little kid<br/>
movies, he loves The Lion King and Babar and<br/>
occasionally Bob the Builder. There are some bad<br/>
scenes in those movies and I am not sure how he<br/>
processes those things. I watch him watching the TV,<br/>
and he is totally glued to it, occasionally commenting<br/>
on his favorite scenes to me. When things get a bit<br/>
scary, sometimes I forward it ( if it is a video it<br/>
upsets him)  or he wants to nurse while still<br/>
watching. <br/>
I do tell him that sometimes he can not watch because<br/>
his brother wants to play and he can get very upset.<br/>
Before his big brother gets up he could easily watch<br/>
two videos in a row without barely moving. He usually<br/>
is a child on the go - very active and fearless and<br/>
happy when he can move. The only thing he sits still<br/>
for is TV. But when he does not get enough movement I<br/>
believe it does not do him good. Sometimes after<br/>
watching I have to take him straight outside or he<br/>
gets violent, starts hitting his brother with things<br/>
or destroying his play. then I have the problem of one<br/>
wanting to be inside playing with me and one needing<br/>
to be outside. Neither one can be left alone yet. <br/>
It is sweet sometimes seeing them cuddled close<br/>
together watching a movie, but I am just not<br/>
comfortable with my little one watching so much. Has<br/>
anyone else had that kind of a problem or any ideas to<br/>
it? <br/>
One thing I plan to do is get some sort of TV cabinet<br/>
where I can close the doors but not sure that would do<br/>
anything.  <br/>
I do try to make the other toys very visible and<br/>
exciting, but it just does not compare. <br/>
thanks for any suggestions,<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269411815">ROTFL....that&#39;s funny Vijay, and I&#39;m glad to see someone else post  <br/>
it! There are days when I&#39;ve had four little voices chattering at me  <br/>
for six hours, as well as Breanna running around doing her verbal  <br/>
stims (running up and down the hallway &quot;Toilet paper..toilet  <br/>
paper...toilet paper...rats!&quot; is her favorite one now) and then my  <br/>
eleven yo pontificating about his latest interest. I&#39;m usually  <br/>
trapped because Avari needs me a lot right now, nursing and needing  <br/>
feedback. I can close my eyes and see a little cartoon version of me  <br/>
running in circles, screaming!<br/>
<br/>
Instead we usually pack up, go somewhere. Do anything where I can  <br/>
lesson the number of people chattering to those who are really  <br/>
needing me and not just doing it because it&#39;s the &#39;in&#39; thing ;-)  And  <br/>
sometimes we just head to the library, pick up our maximum number of  <br/>
movies and try a movie party. If things are going really poorly, we  <br/>
will head to the movie store, but in general the library has some  <br/>
great movies.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree, I&#39;ve never seen a kid zoned. i&#39;ve seen other adults  <br/>
label them as zoned, but when I look at them, really LOOK at them, I  <br/>
see the kids really picking up a lot of things. Even shows that I  <br/>
used to disapprove of, we really talk about and learn from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289220669">Isn&#39;t that funny? They pick something and literally run with it! Our <br/>
kitchen has two doorways that lead to the living room and a small <br/>
hallway off the living room, so Charlotte (3) loves to run around and <br/>
around that circuit sing-songing, &quot;Ring around, what&#39;s that sound, ring <br/>
around, what&#39;s that sound,&quot; over and over. I have no idea where she <br/>
heard this. She sings it faster and faster until I&#39;m the only one who <br/>
can understand what she is saying (if someone comes in for the fast <br/>
part having missed the earlier slower repetitions).<br/>
<br/>
It makes me laugh because she&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be in the kitchen <br/>
watching a show. All of these studies correlating TV and obesity . . . <br/>
well I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a danger in this house, lol. If she&#39;s not <br/>
jumping on the couch watching Madagascar (as a former New Yorker, this <br/>
movie cracks me up: &quot;Look! The star is out! No wait, it&#39;s just a <br/>
helicopter.&quot;) she&#39;s jumping on her bed watching Pirate Dora or just <br/>
plain running around and around and around.<br/>
<br/>
She used to just sit and watch Baby Einstein videos, but those days are <br/>
long gone.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit, before I had kids I thought &quot;no tv, only healthy foods, <br/>
no plastic toys, etc.&quot; was the way to go. Now thanks to these <br/>
unschooling groups I see that closing the door on all of those things <br/>
is just closing the door on more joy that my family could experience. <br/>
Now I am a &quot;yes&quot; mom and proud of it. So we enjoy guilt-free TV, <br/>
frosted flakes, and all kinds of not only plastic but even (gasp) <br/>
battery operated toys and we love every minute of it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and we&#39;re all learning lots of cool stuff too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299739118">Well I hate to sound discouraging, but as far as converts, people <br/>
aren&#39;t usually ready for these ideas until they are, KWIM? In other <br/>
words, they may be perfectly content with traditional homeschooling. Or <br/>
even if they&#39;re struggling, they may not yet be actively seeking an <br/>
alternative.<br/>
<br/>
It might be best to wait for an opportunity that seems more ripe for <br/>
the picking rather than seek to convert people. In other words a local <br/>
mom that I&#39;ve been working with on baby slings (she has twins) knows <br/>
that I am an unschooler. Her sister homeschools 4 kids and has a new <br/>
baby and is getting tired of beating her head against a wall trying to <br/>
get her kids to do math and read more. She&#39;s actively asking me for <br/>
information about unschooling. So I&#39;m trying to just drop little <br/>
tidbits and not overwhelm her, and not judge her and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a local homeschooling group that is mostly unschoolers and <br/>
we&#39;ve been reaching out to all kids when we make plans for a summer get <br/>
together, schooled, homeschooled, unschooled, etc. Whatever! Sometimes <br/>
the kids are the best advocates for this way of life. I invited this <br/>
&quot;unschooling curious&quot; mom to join us at our next get-together and she <br/>
asked if they are all recreational or if there are any academic <br/>
activities. I was pretty incredulous, that she would actively seek out <br/>
academic activities for her kids over the summer, but I kept it light, <br/>
smiled, and said, &quot;Well I guess the way we figure it is the schooled <br/>
kids are off for the summer, so why not the homeschooled kids too? Plus <br/>
we think learning happens all the time anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Believe me I could have either gone off, or I could have gone on and on <br/>
but I knew that either of those approaches might scare her away or <br/>
offend her or bore her. I want her to trust me and have an open mind. I <br/>
want these little tidbits to percolate in her mind until they find a <br/>
place to take root and sprout.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is a) pick your opportunities <br/>
carefully to plug unschooling b) try not to take too overzealous of an <br/>
approach (not saying *you* would, but sometimes we get passionate about <br/>
something and get a little heated when discussing it) and c) just keep <br/>
trying to find people you enjoy spending time with whether they are <br/>
unschooled, homeschooled, or schooled.<br/>
<br/>
Lead by example! Open the door wide and let everyone see what a <br/>
relaxed, joyful life it is.<br/>
<br/>

This made me think of my son playing video games...<br/>
We recently went to a family reunion weekend with my dad&#39;s family. <br/>
When we arrived, some of my cousins (5 yo and 7 yo) were sitting and <br/>
playing video games and the adults were all making those comments <br/>
about kids just sitting around and why don&#39;t kids play outside <br/>
anymore, etc. Jacob decided to play too and I waited for the <br/>
reaction. When he plays, he acts like he is IN the game- he jumps <br/>
around on one foot, leaps in the air, &quot;steers&quot; the controller around <br/>
while pushing buttons, and is quite the ball of energy. Everyone <br/>
thought it was highly amusing (and stopped commenting). <br/>
<br/>
He spent tons of time outside that weekend as well. It was cool to <br/>
see him able to step back and do whatever he felt like. Last summer <br/>
was our summer of him wanting to be indoors and playing all day <br/>
while Emma wanted to be outside all day. (Luckily we have french <br/>
doors off the family room so I could accomodate both kids at the <br/>
same time and be able to see them)<br/>
<br/>
With regards to the original post, I agree with what others have <br/>
posted! Trust them. They will find the balance that works for them. <br/>
Offer lots of cool other options. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, one more comment, the movies and videos WILL get boring over <br/>
time. TV does too. Mine are pretty much past the stage of wanting <br/>
repeats. Now I hear &quot;Isn&#39;t there anything new?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164029865">Here some ideas just off the top of my head. I&#39;ve toyed around with <br/>
getting an unschooling group going in my area.<br/>
<br/>
1. Put up flyers every place a parent or a child would go. <br/>
2. Plan a get together for about a month after you get the word out. <br/>
Something informal and casual. <br/>
3. Post the link to your group on unschooling lists and boards. <br/>
Maybe a few search engines also. <br/>
4. Maybe you can plan a get together at the library. If yours is <br/>
like ours, they don&#39;t change a fee and they&#39;ll help you promote it. <br/>
5. Make up a t-shirt saying something like San Diego Unschoolers and <br/>
wear it when you&#39;re out. Make some for your kids also. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of right now. Good luck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536217944">I was the same way before I had my son. My husband was so sad because he had <br/>
a mom who never allowed him to have sugary cereal (always bought the huge <br/>
bags of health food store puffed rice). Of course when he got to college <br/>
(and really for many years until he decided to change his diet for his own <br/>
reasons) he would buy the sugariest cereals or dump tons of sugar onto the <br/>
healthy stuff I would buy.<br/>
<br/>
My son has now discovered TV and I dealt with the same feelings the original <br/>
poster is dealing with. I admit I had used TV as a babysitter for a half <br/>
hour each evening so I could make dinner. At first it was just Teletubbies <br/>
when he was about 10 months old. He loved it and learned a ton from it. I <br/>
used to think it was a creepy show until I sat and watched it with him <br/>
occasionally. They have a lot of neat things on there - short films from <br/>
different countries with kids doing all sorts of new activities; singing; <br/>
dancing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
About 4 months ago we were both sick and stayed home all day watching movies <br/>
and different kids TV shows. On that day he discovered Dora, Backyardigans, <br/>
Barney and an animal show called Zoboomafoo. He loves these shows now and <br/>
can&#39;t get enough of them. Particularly Dora and Backyardigans. It&#39;s funny, <br/>
though. He HAS to watch each of these 2 shows at least once per day and he <br/>
rejects any other ideas for activities I have for us. I start to worry and <br/>
then just when I feel like it&#39;s becoming too much I see him making <br/>
connections with real world events or people. We&#39;ll be out somewhere and <br/>
he&#39;ll point to something or someone or hear a song, etc., and say, &quot;like <br/>
Dora does&quot;. It will take me a minute to run through the episode in my head <br/>
and see what connection he&#39;s making. Once I see how he&#39;s connecting them I <br/>
really can see how much he&#39;s learning from this new thing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, after worrying about all this TV exposure (he&#39;s just 2) and then <br/>
exploring my feelings through these forums and various unschooling books, I <br/>
remembered how much I learned from TV when I was a kid. I can remember 10 <br/>
specific things I learned from TV at a young age (including particular <br/>
reading rules that began to make sense through TV). It was weird to have <br/>
those memories crop up all of a sudden. Amazing what you guys can pull out <br/>
of a person through these forums :)<br/>

&gt;~I must admit, before I had kids I thought &quot;no tv, only healthy foods,<br/>
&gt;no plastic toys, etc.&quot; was the way to go. ~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME TOO!<br/>
&gt;My poor children were destined for a life of crunchiness with no say<br/>
&gt;in the matter. Good thing I discovered that I didn&#39;t need to EXHAUST<br/>
&gt;myself trying to control all of that. phew.<br/>

Supporting his interests -- that would mean making sure his two  <br/>
favorite shows (at least) get recorded so that he can be sure not to  <br/>
miss them. If you record them, then you can reassure him that he can  <br/>
watch them as soon as you get home (if you&#39;re wanting to go out - if  <br/>
you&#39;re not wanting to go out, then be supportive and plan other  <br/>
activities around his favorite shows).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you stop worrying and start supporting his interests, you&#39;ll be  <br/>
a lot happier and so will he.<br/>
<br/>
Can you start looking at his tv shows differently? Instead of  <br/>
thinking they&#39;re taking him away from something, think of how they  <br/>
are opening up all kinds of ideas and images and possibilities for  <br/>
him and how your role is to expand on those - talk about them, enjoy  <br/>
them together, make connections to them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The same principle will hold throughout his childhood/teenagehood.  <br/>
Later, he might be into skateboarding to the point that it seems, to  <br/>
you, like &#39;that&#39;s all he ever does&#39; - and that might not seem, to  <br/>
you, like a &quot;worthwhile pursuit.&quot; But, you&#39;ll need to shake off your  <br/>
biases and trust him and support that interest. You can&#39;t imagine,  <br/>
now, what interests he might have, later. My 18 yo spent years  <br/>
absolutely enthralled with everything to do with CATS (the musical).  <br/>
My 15 yo loves soccer and martial arts more than anything else. So -  <br/>
we all have gotten really into the FIFA World Cup and just a week or  <br/>
two ago I took some kids to watch a Brazilian martial arts demo, and  <br/>
I bought a whole bunch of Bruce Lee movies when I happened to see  <br/>
them for sale (cheap), and on and on. I don&#39;t try to get her to do  <br/>
something else - but I do support what she is interested in and I put  <br/>
my energy into coming up with connections and ways to expand her  <br/>
world based on her real interests. At the same time, she&#39;s constantly  <br/>
exposed to other possibilities as we live our active, interesting,  <br/>
happy lives.<br/>

watch Dora or Backyardigans for the 2nd or 3rd time in a row. I don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with it, I just want to be sure I&#39;m offering other things to do so <br/>
that he&#39;s not only looking to the TV for entertainment. We do support his <br/>
interests. We TiVo his favorite shows so he can watch them over and over <br/>
again. We also get videos and books that have to do with these characters. <br/>
Some days we don&#39;t get out of the house because he&#39;ll wake up wanting to <br/>
watch them and then I&#39;ll suggest something for afterward (like going to the <br/>
library or working in the garden or going to the park or hardware store or <br/>
out to get ice cream, etc.) and he&#39;ll say no to that idea and he&#39;ll ask to <br/>
watch the episode again immediately afterward. Again, I no longer have a <br/>
problem, I was just letting the OP know that it&#39;s part of the process of <br/>
letting go.<br/>

DVR!  Our DVR has really freed up our lives.  We are currently renting<br/>
one through our cable provider, but we are talking about getting our<br/>
own that will also record things to DVD.  DVR has freed us to be able<br/>
to watch two (or three) conflicting shows, freed us to be able to<br/>
watch what we want when we want and freed us from feeling like we are<br/>
missing out if we choose one activity over another (such as television<br/>
and a park visit or planned activity)  Plus being able to fast forward<br/>
through commercials is well worth the cost LOL!!<br/>

  Here some ideas just off the top of my head. I&#39;ve toyed around with <br/>
getting an unschooling group going in my area.<br/>
<br/>
1. Put up flyers every place a parent or a child would go. <br/>
2. Plan a get together for about a month after you get the word out. <br/>
Something informal and casual. <br/>
3. Post the link to your group on unschooling lists and boards. <br/>
Maybe a few search engines also. <br/>
4. Maybe you can plan a get together at the library. If yours is <br/>
like ours, they don&#39;t change a fee and they&#39;ll help you promote it. <br/>
5. Make up a t-shirt saying something like San Diego Unschoolers and <br/>
wear it when you&#39;re out. Make some for your kids also. :-)<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanx for the ideas! I think that I have a destination in mind, and a pretty good idea on hoe to get there. ;)<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanx again to all for the ideas!<br/>
