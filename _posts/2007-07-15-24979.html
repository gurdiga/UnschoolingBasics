To clarify though, the BC &quot;party&quot; (July 2008) will not be a conference, but a radical <br/>
unschooling retreat, a more relaxed gathering, beachside, meant to complement your <br/>
conference experiences and help foster greater connections and deeper friendships. Like <br/>
some kind of weird radical unschooling summer camp gone wild.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562259955">Excellent!<br/>
Rachel (7yo) just gave me a map with courses outlined where she&#39;d like to visit and Canada is <br/>
one of them. :-) Oh Canada, here we come! lol<br/>
<br/>
She really is quite funny, each end point has a different shape, each shape stands for a <br/>
certain number of days. So seven in Canada, four in Boise, a couple in Indianapolis...I can&#39;t <br/>
remember any of the others (there&#39;s about 12), but it&#39;s taped to our wall. I didn&#39;t ask, for fear <br/>
of sounding...quelching, but why did she pick out the cities that she did? Heehee, I&#39;m hoping <br/>
that in a day or two I can ask what she wants to do in Boise.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I added it solely to point out that the gatherings of unschoolers<br/>
are multiplying!<br/>
It seems where there was one or two, there are now five or six! Chances to<br/>
gather and inspire all over the country!!<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s not one going on in your part of the world, plan one! It doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to be big or formal -- just FUN!<br/>
Ask Mary Gold (LIFE is Good coordinator)-- if you plan it, they/we WILL<br/>
come!! :)<br/>
