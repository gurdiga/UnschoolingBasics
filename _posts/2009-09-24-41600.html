<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212385643">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Darcy, and I am just starting our &#39;official&#39; unschooling journey with our children, Ilyas (6) and Halemah (16 mo).  I say &#39;official&#39; as I find we&#39;ve been unschooling all along, just didn&#39;t have a name for it!<br/>
<br/>
We live in the Houston area and tried PS for a few weeks last fall.  It didn&#39;t work for my son, nor for me (I am a horrible PS mom, I found). I then read a few John Holt books, which basically gave me the &quot;OK&quot; to do what my gut was telling me all along.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading through the messages and printed out the book list.  Thank you so much for such a great resource!!<br/>
