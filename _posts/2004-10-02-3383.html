Sorry I didn&#39;t get back to respond to you all....we lost the <br/>
internet for a few days and then I couldn&#39;t find this thread for a <br/>
while!! Good to know all your relations are doing ok right now. <br/>
<br/>
I finally heard from Sonja (the unschooling Mom that lost <br/>
EVERYTHING) and they&#39;ve been getting donations of food and clothing <br/>
and such from churches down there. I asked her to call so I could <br/>
get some of the stuff everyone here sent our way. <br/>
<br/>
Update on Jay and Betsy: <br/>
Katie got extremely sick with Salmonella this week and was <br/>
hospitalized (does it ever end?). She was released yesterday and is <br/>
doing MUCH better...it was the dehydration actually that got really <br/>
scary and was the reason for keeping her there. Once they got her <br/>
hydrated, she perked up fairly quick. <br/>
I&#39;ve given them some of the donations you all sent...they were <br/>
totally floored. They asked for me to give them addresses so they <br/>
could thank everyone, but I told them folks had asked me to just <br/>
keep them updated rather than have them write a personal thanks <br/>
(figuring they had enough to worry about right now). <br/>
They&#39;ve been so touched by everyone&#39;s concern. Interestingly, I had <br/>
some cash (from all the donations) ready for them and had planned to <br/>
take it over the next day. <br/>
Jay had shown up at our door at about 10pm on Thursday night, <br/>
looking very ashen and shaky. He told us about Katie and how worried <br/>
they were (we knew she was sick, but not in the hospital), so the <br/>
help came at the perfect moment really...they desperately needed a <br/>
boost that night. <br/>
He was almost in tears. <br/>
<br/>
They are more grateful for all the concern and want you all to know <br/>
how much it means to them. Things will get better and they&#39;ll never <br/>
forget all the kindness they&#39;ve encountered from unschoolers they <br/>
had never even met!! <br/>
<br/>
Katie is coming over soon to take home a big bagful of all the art <br/>
supplies/clothing items that have also been sent. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Love, <br/>
Ren</div>
