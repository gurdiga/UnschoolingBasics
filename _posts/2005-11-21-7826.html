I hope you don&#39;t mind me playing with that sentence a bit Tyra:<br/>
<br/>
Of course, watching a movie (or tv) with them means that they can <br/>
learn about anything...<br/>
Of course, exploring new places means they can learn about anything....<br/>
Of course, surfing the internet means they can learn about anything...<br/>
Of course, talking to people means they can learn about anything...<br/>
Of course, playing means they can learn about anything....<br/>
Of course, playing video games means they can learn about anything...<br/>
Of course, being interested in_________(fill in the blank with <br/>
ANYTHING, truly...even chocolate) means they can learn about <br/>
anything...<br/>
<br/>
I realize this was probably just a slip of the tongue (or fingers as <br/>
the case may be), but I think it&#39;s good to point out where we might be <br/>
placing a higher value on certain kinds of learning over others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on an article right now, about how ANY topic in the entire <br/>
world can be your portal to knowledge. I&#39;m using chocolate as my <br/>
example...<br/>
Chocolate alone, has taken me to England, Indonesia, Trinidad, Central <br/>
and South America, Pennsylvania, to ancient civilizations up to <br/>
current times, into horticulture, environmentalism, coooking, customs <br/>
in culture, chemistry, mythology and religion....<br/>
I&#39;m going to stop now, because it&#39;s obvious that chocolate can help <br/>
you learn about anything in the whole wide world.<br/>
<br/>
Pick another topic. Anything. Maybe your child loves Bratz, or Neo-<br/>
pets or GTA. It CAN lead to all kinds of learning. It can lead <br/>
anywhere in the whole world ( and maybe beyond this world) IF, and <br/>
only if, you trust the learning process.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes our interests are more shallow, we only want a little bit of <br/>
information on topic. But when you trust that interest and fascination <br/>
are the key, it CAN lead anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is one such portal. But there are loads of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034527978">You know fisher price makes this dvd read with me system. I am considering<br/>
getting it my kids don&#39;t really like to be read to but if its on the tv they<br/>
will love it and be able to look at the book while looking at the tv will be<br/>
fun for them. I also think ;that interative tv system is cool might be<br/>
fisher price that made it. I also think the leapster is cool we will be<br/>
getting that. Look at what your kids enjoy make ways to combine the things<br/>
that you love and they love. These things might now work for you but I am<br/>
excited to get started using them as soon as I am able to buy them I proble<br/>
wont get the interactive tv cause the other two will be sufficient in<br/>
filling their needs. I will be exited to get them new games and books for<br/>
there systems and so will they. I use to read 40 books a day to them they<br/>
didn&#39;t like it like I did I was passionate about the kids books most of the<br/>
time I just read aloud to myself cause they lost intrest. I know how they<br/>
work and the dvd books which surprisingly enough have most of our favorite<br/>
books will fascinate them they will become passionate about as much as I am<br/>
this way. They love tv they could never get tired of it Magic school bus,<br/>
Cybercase, Blues clues, Blues room, Dora, go Diego, Backyardagians, and<br/>
countless movies we record on the dvr we have dish tv. I can not tell you<br/>
the endless learning they have encountered and paths that had been made<br/>
through other sources that was sparked by these shows. They are suppose to<br/>
be in kindergarten and they are probable smarter that high school students.<br/>
This may disturb some people but the tv is one of the family to them the<br/>
love,love, love it. You should see them take the characters from movies and<br/>
shows they watch and make new stores when they role play through out the day<br/>
creating new story lines and reenacting ones they have seen. It is not a<br/>
mindless thing for my kids they could tell you everything they have watched<br/>
beginning to end what people say, how they might of felt, so on so on. Hey<br/>
maybe they will create their own movies and animation one day see. My kids<br/>
are also computer junkys as well they love animated interaction they learn<br/>
from it what do I have to complain about they are smarter than I ever was at<br/>
that age or even when I was older. Shoot I didn&#39;t know anything about<br/>
habitats, animal facts, Spanish up to300 words or more, all kinds of thing<br/>
about the human body, electricity, how the solar system works, orbits,<br/>
asteroids, what suns are and that its possible that other earths exist<br/>
orbiting another sun, life cycles, names of different animals in there life<br/>
cycles, oh man I don&#39;t know if I could write it all done but that is a good<br/>
summary of it. Hey you could let them watch all the land before times and<br/>
they could learn about period of times in evolution. he he he, They are<br/>
watching Land before time now on Toon Disney I recorded it so they can fast<br/>
forward through commercials which they know how to do they can also pause it<br/>
when they go to the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Hope something I said was helpful<br/>

&gt; getting it my kids don&#39;t really like to be read to but if its on the tv they<br/>
&gt; will love it and be able to look at the book while looking at the tv will be<br/>
&gt; fun for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also think ;that interative tv system is cool might be fisher price that<br/>
made it. I also think the leapster is cool we will be getting that. Look at<br/>
what your kids enjoy make ways to combine the things that you love and they<br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
These things might now work for you but I am excited to get started using<br/>
them as soon as I am able to buy them I proble wont get the interactive tv<br/>
cause the other two will be sufficient in filling their needs. I will be<br/>
exited to get them new games and books for there systems and so will they.<br/>
<br/>
I use to read 40 books a day to them they didn&#39;t like it like I did I was<br/>
passionate about the kids books most of the time I just read aloud to myself<br/>
cause they lost intrest. I know how they work and the dvd books which<br/>
surprisingly enough have most of our favorite books will fascinate them they<br/>
will become passionate about as much as I am this way.<br/>
<br/>
They love tv they could never get tired of it Magic school bus, Cybercase,<br/>
Blues clues, Blues room, Dora, go Diego, Backyardagians, and countless<br/>
movies we record on the dvr we have dish tv. I can not tell you the endless<br/>
learning they have encountered and paths that had been made through other<br/>
sources that was sparked by these shows.<br/>
<br/>
They are suppose to be in kindergarten and they are probable smarter that<br/>
high school students. This may disturb some people but the tv is one of the<br/>
family to them the love,love, love it. You should see them take the<br/>
characters from movies and shows they watch and make new stores when they<br/>
role play through out the day creating new story lines and reenacting ones<br/>
they have seen.<br/>
<br/>
It is not a mindless thing for my kids they could tell you everything they<br/>
have watched beginning to end what people say, how they might of felt, so on<br/>
so on. Hey maybe they will create their own movies and animation one day<br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are also computer junkys as well they love animated interaction they<br/>
learn from it what do I have to complain about they are smarter than I ever<br/>
was at that age or even when I was older.<br/>
<br/>
Shoot I didn&#39;t know anything about habitats, animal facts, Spanish up to300<br/>
words or more, all kinds of thing about the human body, electricity, how the<br/>
solar system works, orbits, asteroids, what suns are and that its possible<br/>
that other earths exist orbiting another sun, life cycles, names of<br/>
different animals in there life cycles, oh man I don&#39;t know if I could write<br/>
it all done but that is a good summary of it.<br/>
<br/>
Hey you could let them watch all the land before times and they could learn<br/>
about period of times in evolution. he he he, They are watching Land before<br/>
time now on Toon Disney I recorded it so they can fast forward through<br/>
commercials which they know how to do they can also pause it when they go to<br/>
the bathroom.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I agree, Ren, and thank you for expanding the sentence. If Anastasia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband is like mine, he does not want to hear what my son learned from TV,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is why I emphasized reading. However, I really don&#39;t value one over<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other as far as my son is concerned. I will say personally, reading is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; passion of mine. But, there are some things that my son has learned just<br/>
&gt; &gt; from living and neither I nor my husband had anything to do with it so, yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I most certainly agree that we all can learn from anything. That is exactly<br/>
&gt; &gt; why I KNOW unschooling is the way!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot; Of course reading to<br/>
&gt; &gt; them means that they can learn about just about anything.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope you don&#39;t mind me playing with that sentence a bit Tyra:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, watching a movie (or tv) with them means that they can<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn about anything...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, exploring new places means they can learn about anything....<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, surfing the internet means they can learn about anything...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, talking to people means they can learn about anything...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, playing means they can learn about anything....<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, playing video games means they can learn about anything...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, being interested in_________(fill in the blank with<br/>
&gt; &gt; ANYTHING, truly...even chocolate) means they can learn about<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything...<br/>
