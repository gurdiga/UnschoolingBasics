<div id="ygrps-yiv-39247068">I&#39;m hoping some of you will be able to offer some insight.  Here&#39;s the<br/>
situation - we started giving weekly money to the kids about 1.5 years<br/>
ago and it&#39;s been working out fine.  It&#39;s just that as dh and I evolve<br/>
more into this &#39;family money&#39; lifestyle we&#39;re having a difficult time<br/>
making sense of how allowance fits in.  Up until recently, if ds&#39;s<br/>
didn&#39;t have enough allowance to get what they wanted the 5.5 year old<br/>
would comment on how he would save and had no issues with that.  Dh<br/>
and I have been pleased with this - at times one has to wait. <br/>
However, lately if they don&#39;t have enough we&#39;ll cover the difference.<br/>
 Our issue with this is that one isn&#39;t always able to get what they<br/>
want, when they want it.  I know part of my issue with this is from<br/>
how I was raised.  I was gifted what I wanted and come age 18 I was<br/>
cut off and it was sink or swim time.  I knew nothing about budgeting,<br/>
saving, spending...  I see such value in the kids having their money<br/>
to spend how they want. Dh and I are just trying to make sense of how<br/>
to deal with family money/allowance.  Rue - I recall you noting in<br/>
your book about your kids getting a flexible monthly amount.  That has<br/>
stirred my thinking and would very much appreciate you elaborating, if<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t mind. And thank you for writing your book - such an<br/>
insightful read - reccomending it all around!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890089053">For us, DS gets a set allowance every payday (when I get paid, he does <br/>
too). Often he forgets and the money just sits in his wallet. <br/>
Generally, we pay for most things anyhow but sometimes we just don&#39;t <br/>
have the cash on hand, but he does. For us, it kind of guarantees that <br/>
money is his to use as opposed to getting sucked up into everything <br/>
else. And he enjoys having his own money to use at will. He quite <br/>
understands the idea of saving and spending - he saved for 2 months <br/>
for something -even though- we offered half so he could get it sooner. <br/>
He knows that we have bills - we talk about it, about how if we want <br/>
to do x then we can&#39;t do y - applies to adults as well as kids. We <br/>
don&#39;t say &quot;no we can&#39;t buy you that&quot; then turn around and go spend $$ <br/>
at Starbucks or Borders. I guess it&#39;s more of what I might <br/>
call &#39;walking around money&#39; - something in his pocket should he choose <br/>
to use it.<br/>

Dagny has a bank account.  She puts most of her monthly money there, along<br/>

ebay, and babysitting.  If she needs something she tells me if she wants to<br/>

going to need clothes next month or wants a new memory card for her camera<br/>
before the conference :o) she&#39;ll ask me if we have the money or to start<br/>
saving.  She&#39;s usually comparison shopped by the time she tells me and has<br/>
an idea of how much she&#39;ll need, but we used to do that together.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for making the time to respond.  Your post, of course, sparked<br/>
more questions:)  I&#39;m curious to know at what age you started this and<br/>
in what way you introduced the buget to your kids.  I know many kids<br/>
see the bills getting paid.  Ours are done online and the kids just<br/>
haven&#39;t seen it.  However, recently my soon-to-be six year old asked<br/>
why dad has to work so much to make money and we explained where lots<br/>
of the money goes.  Financial understanding is such an important tool<br/>
and, in my opinion, to get a hands-on grasp of it while young is<br/>
invaluable.  <br/>

I totally agree... I only wish I had that knowledge at a younger age... My  <br/>
parents kept finances a &quot;secret&quot;, still do. All I knew is, they HAD money, yet  <br/>
would &quot;pretend&quot; to be poor. Drives me nuts now as an adult and being in the <br/>
real  world myself. Theirs views were pretty warped, to say the least.<br/>
I hope hope hope I don&#39;t do such a disservice for my kids.  <br/>

**They&#39;ve been involved since they were babies. I&#39;d give them old checkbooks<br/>
and registers, receipts, and a calculator if they wanted.  Eventually they<br/>
started asking questions about specific bills and how often we pay for<br/>
things and why I keep track of the things we buy. I regularly talk about<br/>
things we&#39;re saving for and talk it through with them when I&#39;m trying to<br/>
decide if I should buy something.  They&#39;ve always been involved in big<br/>
financial decisions we&#39;ve made, too - buying our house, refinancing a few<br/>
years later, buying a car, etc.  When we&#39;re going to buy something we all<br/>
pick it out together.  They&#39;re votes count just as much as mine do, which<br/>
confuses the salespeople, which amuses us :o).  ~Rue<br/>
