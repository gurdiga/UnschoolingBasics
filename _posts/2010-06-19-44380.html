<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219598058">My son just got an X-Box for his birthday and we really do not know  most fo the games.<br/>
We have been big Nintendo fans and he loves Mario, Zelda and Sonic.<br/>
He will be 8 years old.<br/>
Can you suggest games he may like so we could rent on GameFly and try them out??<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
OH and if you want to be his friend please send your info and I will add to his friends list ( is that how it works??)<br/>

and have building or design aspects to them.<br/>
<br/>
Halo 3 is a long puzzle (where you kill aliens) it also includes a  <br/>
forge area that is for creating your own forts and playing against a  <br/>
friend irl or live.<br/>
Halo one is a favorite also.<br/>
<br/>
Saints Row 2 is another game that is multi-faceted it includes meeting  <br/>
challenges and designing both your character and automobiles.<br/>

Assasins Creed and Fallout 3 are some newer games he is enjoying.<br/>

Some other young friends enjoy the Lego Indiana jones but Easy finds  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70182702">Thanks Faith. Halo is the one MD likes. We got Halo OSsomething wiht the bundle and i will<br/>
be getting him Halo3.<br/>
He also like puzzles games.<br/>
I will try those other ones.<br/>
How does one play with friends on Live and can we add Easy ( MD is going to be 8 this coming week)?<br/>
We got Lego Indiana Jones and Star Wars for the Wii.<br/>
He rarely if ever plays them.<br/>
MD also LOVES Roblox and likes Maple Story so any games like that would be great.<br/>

Oh, you have to have an xbox gold account to play games with friends. I don&#39;t know what it costs in the U.S. You go to account and add friends from there. <br/>

&gt; Simon&#39;s name is beserk 566 and Linnaea is vampire616 (Simon and I aren&#39;t<br/>

&gt; Oh, you have to have an xbox gold account to play games with friends. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what it costs in the U.S. You go to account and add friends from<br/>

In the US: The one year card is 50$ - which is a great deal on it&#39;s own -<br/>
AND if you&#39;re near a costco, you can pick one up for just under 40$ :)<br/>
