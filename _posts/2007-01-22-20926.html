<div id="ygrps-yiv-917966057">Hi All,<br/>
This looks like an active group with lots of resources;). My name is <br/>
Lynn, and my 10 year old dd has just begun unschooling. I&#39;m not <br/>
entirely clear on what this is, but I&#39;m glad to know it is not <br/>
following someone else&#39;s rigorous schedule. We had tried <br/>
homeschooling-well maybe it was more of virtual schooling, which is <br/>
public school ciriculum at home. Within 2 months we were both <br/>
frustrated, burned out, and behind. As we began traveling/camping, <br/>
things became impossible. No longer residng full time in Wisconsin, <br/>
my dd was no longer eligible for the program. Over the holidays, I <br/>
just let <br/>
her decompensate and enjoy life. She has now begun to write, read <br/>
children&#39;s classics, is working on spelling and art as well as <br/>
computer skills, all without even realizing that she has begun <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s natural, and I&#39;m already seeing the dd she used to <br/>
be before trying to fit in the educational mold. There is far too <br/>
much pressure, and the joy of learning is squashed.<br/>
<br/>
Now my dd is willing to listen and learn, and everything is a <br/>
lesson;). Math has been her most difficult subject, as she never <br/>
memorised the basic facts. She&#39;s able to work problems, but those <br/>
basic facts hinder her speed and confidence. She also has become an <br/>
accomplished reader <br/>
without the ability to spell. I have plans of using math workbooks <br/>
until she masters the facts, and phonics to strengthen her spelling <br/>
skills; however, I am confused about how to satisfy state schooling <br/>
statutes. Additionally, I&#39;m not ceratin what state to use, as we are <br/>
spending time in several states for periods of 3-6 months. I have <br/>
some property in Wiscoonsin, but do not anticipate spending more <br/>
than a few months there this year. Lastly, I could use some tips in <br/>
planning/documentation/organization. Thanks for reading, and I look <br/>
forward to all your posts.<br/>

<br/>
are good resources. A local group would have more state-specific <br/>
information. Personally, I&#39;d look up the requirements of all the <br/>
states you plan to be staying in - you may not have to register in <br/>
any of them if you are there less than six mos, but Don&#39;t take my <br/>
word for it!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keep going and you can get to a place where Nothing is a &quot;lesson&quot; - <br/>
your dd can learn organically. My five year old has never <br/>
been &quot;taught&quot; and learns amazing things at every turn. My 13 yr old <br/>
stepson came to live and unschool with us just a few months ago and <br/>
is enjoying a new life of learning with no teaching. <br/>

How will memorizing the basic facts help her be a better 10 yo and do  <br/>
10 yo things better?<br/>

be better at being 10?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of college graduates can&#39;t spell well either despite years of  <br/>
lessons and reading.<br/>
<br/>
The subject of spelling has been discussed a lot and from adults&#39;  <br/>
stories it seems that the ability to spell well is genetic. All the  <br/>
lessons in the world aren&#39;t going to overcome genetics. And for those  <br/>
who are hardwired to spell well, all they need do is absorb spelling  <br/>
from the world around them.<br/>
<br/>
I think automatic spell checkers are a boon to spelling :-) I&#39;m a  <br/>
decent speller but seeing words I&#39;m iffy on underlined in red helps  <br/>
reinforce the right and wrong spelling. And I *want* to spell well.<br/>
<br/>
The teens are usually when kids start wanting to spell well because  <br/>
they&#39;re doing more communicating in writing (IMs, email, message  <br/>
boards, etc.) And they learn quickly because they want to learn. It&#39;s  <br/>
really as simple as that :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have plans of using math workbooks<br/>

&gt; skills;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What the people on the list do at home is up to them. What people  <br/>
bring to the list to share is where we can help them -- and other  <br/>
reading -- see ways to move closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some questions to think about. They aren&#39;t meant to be snarky  <br/>
but to help you see where school thought is creating a false image of  <br/>
the situation and preventing you from seeing what the situation  <br/>
really looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think she won&#39;t learn math or spelling without workbooks?  <br/>
What do you imagine we&#39;ve done with our kids? Do you think our kids  <br/>
are somehow different? Do you think that your daughter isn&#39;t as smart  <br/>
as our kids? Or do you think we have 17 yos who can&#39;t figure out 7x5  <br/>
or spell their way out of a paper bag?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309217997">Thanks for the references;). When I said everything&#39;s a lesson, I <br/>
meant that my dd has recovered her natural curiosity and joy of <br/>
learning. She asks me so many questions now, and I&#39;m really enjoying <br/>
her enthusiasm, and helping her discover the answers.<br/>
