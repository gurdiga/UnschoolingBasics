First I was afraid,  I was petrified.<br/>
Kept thinking I could never teach , &#39;Cause I&#39;m not certified.<br/>
But we spent so many nights<br/>
Re-teaching homework that was wrong.<br/>
I grew strong, so now I teach my kids at home!<br/>
We learn &#39;bout math  and outer space.<br/>
I just kept on despite the fear with a big smile across my face.<br/>
I bought a set of Base Ten blocks.<br/>
I bought books with answer keys.<br/>
My parents think we&#39;re nuts,<br/>
but they don&#39;t even bother me<br/>
<br/>
Come on, let&#39;s go walk out the door.<br/>
We&#39;re on the road now, &#39;cause we&#39;re not home much anymore<br/>
My friends would laugh and say we&#39;d be unsocialized.<br/>
I heard one mumble  that I&#39;d give up by July.<br/>
Oh no, not I! I will survive!<br/>
As long as I know how to read<br/>
I know we&#39;ll be alright.<br/>
I&#39;ve got all my life to learn. I&#39;ve got energy to burn.<br/>
and I&#39;ll survive.  I will survive.<br/>
<br/>
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.<br/>
Decided to attend a play date at the local park,<br/>
and I met oh so many moms who offered eagerly to help.<br/>
They used to cry.  Now they hold their heads up high,<br/>
and so do we! My kids are cool!<br/>
They&#39;re not those chained up little people stuck inside at school.<br/>
So if you feel like dropping by and just expect us to be free<br/>
you&#39;d better call ahead first &#39;cause we&#39;re probably busy!</div>
