Wish I had some great solution for you, but wanted to pass along a big<br/>
*cyberhug* and say I do understand.  My in-laws are happily half the country<br/>
away from us, but I have a SIL who was just about ready to file for<br/>
protective custody at the end of our last trip to visit them all (she is the<br/>
poster mom for &quot;societally/culturally correct&quot; parenting...she thinks there<br/>
will be a prize at the end of her life I think.  And my MIL thinks my SIL<br/>
has it all figured out.  In any event, you should have seen the look on<br/>
SIL&#39;s face when she left her kids at Nonna&#39;s and later found out her six<br/>
year old son and three year old daughter had participated in a dip with<br/>
their cousins - my kids - in Nonna&#39;s big jacuzzi bathtub NAKED (gasp) under<br/>
my &quot;supervision&quot; which basically consisted of &quot;yeah, sure, good idea&quot; and<br/>
running the water.  But I think it was my daughter sticking stuffed animals<br/>
under her clothes and pulling the six yr old cousin off to the bathroom<br/>
yelling &quot;Come on, let&#39;s do waterbirths!&quot; and then giving him a complete<br/>
detailed description of how that happened exactly that pushed her over the<br/>
edge.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very happy they do not live nearby as I am envisioning how difficult<br/>
that would all be.  Any chance you could just find some chosen family to<br/>
replace them?<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

they are uninvited from it.  Tell them you are more than happy to come <br/>
visit them when you can.  Or to have them over for scheduled events, but <br/>
right now you are concentrating on keeping your family happy, entertained, <br/>
educated and HEALTHY and you don&#39;t have time for people to just drop in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125426991">Well, June.. this probably isn&#39;t too helpful but maybe it might make you smile :-).........<br/>
My husband and I married when I was 15 and he was 18 -6 years later we had 4 kids-no money-he had only part time work for 2$ an hour ( we are 65 and 68 now so that gives you an idea. )<br/>
We had moved to Winnipeg  a few years previous looking for a better future-I was a mess-depressed-frustrated-the worst housekeeper-a crummy barely furnished  rental house.My husband used to do the dishes, and  clean up  in the evening  after supper and after the kids were in bed. He would take over for me and roll around on the floor and  rough house with them which they loved.<br/>
 One of my  husbands  older brothers  came over  one day-wandered into the kitchen where  the dishes were literally piled up in the sink two feet high (no counters)-left-came back a few hours later when  my husband got home-tired and  hungry-he tied into him about what a crummy housekeeper I was and what a mess the house was- and that he should leave me.<br/>
 My husband-who was and is the quietest non violent person you would ever meet took him by the back of his collar and a handfull of pants on his arse-frog marched him out the door, tossed him into a snowbank in the front yard-without a word the whole time mind you;came back in and sat down  and had his supper and played with the kids and never said a word about it.<br/>
That  bit of support  has given me  a laugh whenever I think about it. He hasn&#39;t given him the time of day since either. ;-) <br/>
 Hang in there..<br/>

...................................................................<br/>
Actually, I have very often  just stood and talked to my inlaws in the yard , sometimes  even while they are sitting in their car. <br/>
They don&#39;t come around anymore, I  feel no obligation to  invite people in that I hardly know -doesn,t matter who-when they drive in the yard unanounced i meet them in the yard.We have a long driveway and we park out front and have a gated yard because people arrive in front of our Boarding Kennel when they drive in.Before our Kennels were expanded we had a huge herd of Registered Dairy goats and before and during that we had lots of livestock and horses and were hardly ever in the house.<br/>
Most of the relatives etc. come  from cities or town  and have no idea what living on a piece of land with livestock etc. and a bunch of kids and their interests is like and no way did they ever &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>
For me it was way more upsetting to hear later what some one said about our place than it was for me to know they  thought I was weird for not inviting them in. Always had an out by saying &quot;well I have to start feeding, or milking, or bring the sheep in or whatever.&quot;<br/>
The bare bum babies used to get to them too ;-)...that  I never bothered explaining....<br/>
