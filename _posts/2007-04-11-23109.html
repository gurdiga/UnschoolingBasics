<div id="ygrps-yiv-342716788">I read this group, Always Unschooled, and Consensual Living when I <br/>
get time.  I am currently a month behind, so sorry for the old quote, <br/>
but here it is<br/>
<br/>
******I think the key is right in the middle of that statement: &quot;the <br/>
whole child&quot;. Schools leave people damaged. Wanting school goals and <br/>
school solutions comes from that damage. Acheiving school goals <br/>
doesn&#39;t move a person closer to healing that damage. *****<br/>
<br/>
Meredith, you post on all three groups, and your *insight* into the <br/>
very nature of problems - what they are about, why they happen, and <br/>
how to fix them never ceases to floor me.  Like the above quote - you <br/>
really open my eyes to issues I never could have conceptualized - I <br/>
mean .. I can tell *something* is wrong or undesireable or off .. but <br/>
I am rarely able to figure out what the true meat of it is.  You can <br/>
and do - and there are a lot of people on these groups that are also <br/>
consistently insightful and can kindly share the knowledge in a way <br/>
so anyone can and wants to understand.<br/>
<br/>
So, what&#39;s the secret - this is a question for any of you experts out <br/>
there  Did you start at this same confused, damaged place that I did <br/>
and you&#39;ve just been at it longer?  Are you versed in psychological <br/>
concepts?  Did you read some special books?  I really hope to someday <br/>
be as secure in *that place* of inner knowledge that a lot of you are <br/>
already.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, what&#39;s the secret <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes its just a matter of being &quot;outside&quot; the situation, and <br/>
being able to see a different perspective because of that. For me, <br/>
reading and answering posts gives *me* a better perspective on my <br/>
own life and parenting, too. There are times when I&#39;m making a <br/>
suggestion and thinking &quot;hey, I should be doing more of that!&quot; There <br/>
are other times when answering a post that I&#39;ll see a solution to a <br/>
problem I&#39;ve had myself. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lousy at asking questions. There are some people on these boards <br/>
who are fabulous at asking really complex questions. I love that. I <br/>
can&#39;t do that. Its a whole different kind of ability. I&#39;m not the <br/>
sort of person who can just write, either - that amazes me. I need <br/>
someone else to get me started, to nudge me in a direction. That&#39;s <br/>
an important part of *my* process.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s wonderful wisdom on the unschooling boards! I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve <br/>
found some in my posts. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did you start at this same confused, damaged place that I did <br/>
&gt; and you&#39;ve just been at it longer? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started out pretty confused and damaged - my &#39;true confessions&#39; <br/>
tend to get posted on AU more than here, just bc of the nature of <br/>
the questions people ask. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you versed in psychological <br/>
&gt; concepts?  Did you read some special books? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to answer this from a different direction - I think of <br/>
parenting as a spiritual practice. For *me* that ends up being an <br/>
outgrowth of my zen and yoga practices, but I&#39;ve met other parents <br/>
online and irl for whom its a christian practice, or a wiccan <br/>
practice or &quot;simply&quot; a matter of being passionately devoted to their <br/>
families. Just like with our kids, its not so much a matter of how <br/>
and where things are learned - the learning itself grows out of a <br/>
joyful connection with life.<br/>
<br/>
*And* I read a lot of unschooling boards and blogs and websites. <br/>
Thich Nhat Hahn doesn&#39;t hold a candle to a Danielle or Ren or <br/>
Shuyler talking about a day with their kids. <br/>
