 </span></blockquote>Absolutely! Not only can you, but you should.<br/>
<br/>
*But* it needs to be a true question. You need to be as okay with  <br/>
&quot;no&quot; as with &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You model respect for them when you value their judgement of whether  <br/>
something is worth their own time. The more they see you honoring and  <br/>
respecting them, the sooner they will return it (as they are  <br/>
developmentally able to!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who took care of the hypothetical farm before the kids came along?  <br/>
While it would be more convenient for the adults if the kids did help  <br/>
out, the kids are in essence being treated as conscripted labor.<br/>
<br/>
Parents create the world they want to give to their children. Gifts  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t come with strings or they aren&#39;t gifts! If you wanted to  <br/>
give a farm-life childhood to your kids as a gift, then don&#39;t attach  <br/>
strings to it. If you had kids specifically to lighten your load,  <br/>
then you should be honest about that and accept that you&#39;re going to  <br/>
need to steal from your relationship with them in order to get them  <br/>
to do chores.<br/>
<br/>
That said, some people have the gift of projecting the &quot;We&#39;re all in  <br/>
this together attitude,&quot; and the kids do feel a part of the team. But  <br/>
you can&#39;t get there by making them, or dumping chores on them.<br/>
<br/>
If you maintain ownership of the chores and treat help as you would  <br/>
help from a friend, it fosters better relationships and you become  <br/>
someone your children want to help. &quot;Here&#39;s what I want to do today.  <br/>
Why don&#39;t you come along and help out so it will get done sooner and  <br/>
we can do something together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you read here:<br/>

<br/>
Probably &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;Chores&quot; and &quot;Commitments, obligations,  <br/>
responsibilities&quot; will help you understand what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>

help your child with something, or just do it.  I often carry some of<br/>
ds&#39;s chainmaille stuff out to the car (he likes to work on it while we<br/>
are going places), since I have more available hands than he might at<br/>
the time.  <br/>

Not on a farm....yet. But I know more than one RU family that<br/>
homesteads or farms. Danielle Conger (who might pipe up here) has a<br/>
mini-farm and you can check out her lovely online Ezine &quot;Connections&quot;.<br/>
She can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/.">http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/.</a><br/>
<br/>
The Contrary Goddess is a hard working RU mama who can be found here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://contrarygoddess.blogspot.com/">http://contrarygoddess.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think in her case, the kids have grown up with the idea that they<br/>
are reliant on the food they grow and animals they raise (because they<br/>
truly ARE) and so their contributions are necessary and valuable. If a<br/>
child knows a parent is there to help them, is on their side and<br/>
willing to work with their preferences it works a lot better. Anyhoo,<br/>
I&#39;m sure you can find a lot of examples of mindful parenting and farming.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live on a small farm, but not one like you seem to be envisioning, so <br/>
my answer may not be in line with what you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
<br/>
We moved here about 2.5 years ago from suburbia, and our goal (or more <br/>
specifically *my* goal) was to homestead. We do not support ourselves <br/>
with our farm; my husband works and that money is what we use to pay the <br/>
bills.<br/>
<br/>
This past year, I&#39;ve begun to try to earn some money from our farm in <br/>
order, basically, to cover food costs for our family, which is <br/>
money-making of a sort. We have a very small CSA (subscription garden), <br/>
and we raise free-range meats. Another goal of mine has been for this to <br/>
offer a business opportunity for the kids if/ when they want it. This <br/>
has meant reworking our finances a bit to be able to &quot;pay&quot; them for <br/>
their work time since indoor help has always been optional and not tied <br/>
to their budget. Outdoor work is still totally optional, but it carries <br/>
with it the opportunity to make &quot;extra&quot; money on top of their regular <br/>
part of the family budget.<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t require the kids&#39; help in anyway, it still affects my <br/>
everyday parenting because there are things *I* must get done to keep <br/>
things running smoothly, which makes me less available at these times <br/>
than others. I try to do much of my work outside of my parenting hours <br/>
(i.e. before the kids wake up in the morning), but there&#39;s always enough <br/>
work to be done that it&#39;s not always possible. This has offered the kids <br/>
opportunities to do things on their own while I&#39;m out in the fields and <br/>
just a shout away, creating a really safe atmosphere for them to explore <br/>
their own independence and self-sufficiency in their own ways. It also <br/>
offers some really nice one on one time with the kids when one of them <br/>
chooses to come out and work with me, as well as some great outdoor time <br/>
for all of us when we&#39;re all outside together.<br/>
<br/>
The kids love our life. I love our life. Farming, at least with the <br/>
luxury of an outside income, isn&#39;t at all contrary to RU philosophy, <br/>
I&#39;ve found. I&#39;m happy to answer specific questions if this isn&#39;t quite <br/>
what you were getting at.<br/>

My husband and I just read the Mutual Respect threads.  What and<br/>
exciting morning.  My husband starts with &quot;I really have an open mind<br/>
but...&quot;  Why don&#39;t my children have to respect me (not throw cheerios<br/>
on the floor, leaving dishes with food on the table, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How old are your children?<br/>
<br/>
Respect has nothing to do with obedience.<br/>
<br/>
And cleaning is just not important to small children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning is hard for me.  I don&#39;t find joy in it (I think it is just my<br/>
own stubborn rebellion).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but who, do you think, is capable of changing your attitude <br/>
about cleaning? Your kids? Your neighbor?<br/>
<br/>
Who should take responsibility for your attitude?<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to foster that same attitude in your children? The I HATE <br/>
HOUSEWORK attitude? Wouldn&#39;t you love for them to see how pleasant <br/>
housework can be? How do you think that would work? By telling them how <br/>
much you hate it? Why would they choose to do something so heinous?<br/>
<br/>
Would taking pleasure it in kill you? Do you think a positive attitude <br/>
about cleaning might possibly rub off on your children?<br/>
<br/>
Did your mother hate housecleaning? Did she make you do it?<br/>
<br/>
How did you come to hate it so much? Do you want the same for your <br/>
kids? And your grandkids? How would you go about changing it? What <br/>
small steps could you take toDAY?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are just beginning to let go<br/>
of our own conditioning but man it is hard!  It is really easy to slip<br/>
back to &quot;I told you to do it!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure it is! That&#39;s what deep breaths and a positive attitude can change <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
What if I said, &quot;I told you to do it!&quot;? Would that change how you <br/>
approached it? Would you feel better about it if I just did it happily <br/>
and joyfully---without bothering you? Would you wonder just what *was* <br/>
so much fun about cleaning? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy. And it&#39;s exhausting at first. But the more you do it, <br/>
the easier it gets. Promise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for the nitty gritty of letting go of our<br/>
preconditions.  Can we ask them to do things to help out?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it a QUESTION??????<br/>
<br/>
What if they say NO? Are you willing to take that as an answer? &#39;Cause <br/>
a real question can be answered honestly with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot; or a <br/>
&quot;maybe later&quot; or a &quot;in a minute.&quot; ALL valid answers to the questions, <br/>
&quot;Can you help me?&quot; and &quot;Will you do this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to take &quot;no&quot; as an answer for a really long time? <br/>
Happily and joyfully---no strings attached?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that &quot;Can you help_____?&quot; is a better question than &quot;Will <br/>
you DO____?&quot; at first. Most are willing to *HELP* a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;no&quot; needs to be a valid answer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husbands question &quot;What if we lived on the farm and we needed them <br/>
to help with<br/>
the chores in the morning?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you live on a farm? If not, it&#39;s a hypothetical.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause there would be more questions attached to that---like, did they <br/>
ask to have/live on a farm?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
(my kids would love this!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
yeah---maybe. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s a lot of work. They might help out for a while, <br/>
but they&#39;re kids. It might not last long.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re having a hard time accepting and demonstrating to them <br/>
that housework is *play*, I doubt you would do that great a job <br/>
convincing them that farmwork is play! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Forget the farm labor! Start ENJOYING the housework you have <br/>
already---really! Be grateful that you have dishes to wash and clothes <br/>
to fold and floors to mop and precious children to pick up after. Let <br/>
them see how you appreciate what you *have* NOW! They&#39;re seeing <br/>
drudgery through *your * eyes. Let them see JOY! It starts with YOU!<br/>
