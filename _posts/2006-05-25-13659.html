<div id="ygrps-yiv-943591247">Awesome little movie, maybe three minutes long, on the internet. It  <br/>
talks about the different animals abilities and reflects alot of what  <br/>
we see in public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Which animal resembles your child<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked the movie, except the part about the fish.  However, if you go to<br/>
the website that sponsors this little film, it seems to be a blogg. I also<br/>
had some problems with some of her parenting philosophies.  The impression<br/>
that I got from her blogs were that children are manipulative, difficult and<br/>
controlling and shouldn&#39;t be spoiled and made to earn their keep.  Hmmmmm.<br/>
Quite different from the movie.<br/>
