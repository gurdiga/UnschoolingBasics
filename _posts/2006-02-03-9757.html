state as well as on what their own plans are as they become older  <br/>
teens and young adults. There is too much variation among unschoolers  <br/>
to answer such a general question.<br/>

For example, in NY a person can get hs diploma with 24 college credits. I know several unschoolers who have acheived this in community college.  You don&#39;t need a hs diploma to enroll and take college coursework - it depends on the university system.  In other states, i understand that homeschooling parents can issue their own hs diploma.  <br/>
