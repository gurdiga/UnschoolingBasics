<div id="ygrps-yiv-500392636">Have you gotten any ideas that will help you out yet?  I know you have asked <br/>
on several lists. As a single, working parent it may be hard enough to find <br/>
the time and energy to cook dinner, much less read and respond to e-mail. <br/>
Perhaps if you let us know what town you are in, someone will have a resource for <br/>
you.<br/>
  <br/>
My kids are teens now, and I have been pretty much a single parent for the <br/>
last six or so years.  I&#39;m hearing a familiar frustration in your writing, that <br/>
I felt when I was trying to do everything alone.  It is hard to do, and the <br/>
guilt can be crippling.  I felt very committed to unschooling, and since the <br/>
kids had never spent much time in school, I did not want to force them into it, <br/>
just because I was suddenly their single, sole provider.  They were smart and <br/>
clever and understanding, and I assumed we could do it all.  Whatever that <br/>
was...  <br/>
Now, that we look back, we all can see that there are some things we would do <br/>
differently. I often ran out of time, money, or energy to provide my kids <br/>
with the guidance and encouragement they needed. There was a lot of love, and <br/>
hugs, and laughter, and tears, but very few of the presents, supplies, <br/>
excursions, workshops and classes that they were used to, or that our old friends were <br/>
doing. I was struggling to keep food on the table.  Feeling angry, depressed <br/>
and defiant about our situation and yet, determined to stick to my ideals.  The <br/>
kids became resentful about how hard life had become.  We often talk on these <br/>
lists about keeping our kids with us as we are working/learning through <br/>
traumas, and healing together as a family.  But as a single stressed out mom, <br/>
helping all of us recover from some harrowing circumstances, I needed lots of <br/>
guidance and support myself.  Beyond Unschooling Support, I found some relief and <br/>
new friends by going to various weekly support meetings for domestic <br/>
violence/divorce/single parenting/healthy cooking,  etc.  They usually offered some kind <br/>
of child care, and my kids met other kids from similar circumstances.  <br/>
Looking back, they might have enjoyed a year or two in school, had I relaxed <br/>
my standards a little. I just didn&#39;t think I could stand it.  According to <br/>
their most recent discussion, I did not realize how much they were bored and <br/>
climbing the walls while I was at work, or in therapy, or at the doctor.  One has <br/>
become very self sufficient, the other is still waiting for someone to <br/>
entertain him.  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to say to take care of yourself, heal and be happy, and share your <br/>
light and wisdom with your sensitive son.  You&#39;ll both feel better.  <br/>
I&#39;m off to work now.  A job I enjoy, but still overworked and underpaid.<br/>
Wishing you well,<br/>
Bird</div>
