<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377203543">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been following along with various discussions for several weeks<br/>
now and it&#39;s helping our family along our unschooling journey.<br/>
 I really appreciate the seasoned unschoolers among you for taking the<br/>
time to answer questions and share your experience.  Hopefully I can<br/>
do the same one day - right now, I think I&#39;m still muddling through it<br/>
all and taking it a day at a time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is seven and while I&#39;ve always been philosophically drawn<br/>
towards unschooling, it&#39;s taken me some time to reassure that anxious<br/>
&quot;schooled&quot; voice at the back of my head continually questioning the<br/>
validity of what we&#39;re doing.  We recently moved to an area that has a<br/>
supportive IRL unschooling network and that, along with various<br/>
boards, is helping tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
For my question, I&#39;m hoping people could share any resources or<br/>
personal stories about sex positive parenting.  We&#39;ve had some<br/>
experiences lately with playground play that has some<br/>
parents a little on edge.  It appears to be of the &quot;I&#39;ll show you<br/>
mine, you show me yours&quot; variety.  &quot;Truth or dare&quot; has also made an<br/>
appearance - with what I consider pretty innocent dares - &quot;What color<br/>
are your underpants?&quot;, &quot;Dance like a noodle&quot;, etc.  The response of<br/>
some of the parents involved seems a little alarmist and there is now<br/>
talk of &quot;No playing in the bushes&quot;, &quot;No truth or dare&quot;, etc.  While I<br/>
want to respect the wishes of these parents, I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>
this without communicating a &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; type of message to my<br/>
daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Just from drawing on my own experience, I knew I wanted to raise my<br/>
daughter in a more open and honest atmosphere regarding sex.  Growing<br/>
up, I never got even an abbreviated version of &quot;the sex talk&quot; and the<br/>
results were pretty disastrous.  I was definitely a late bloomer<br/>
(pretty much terrified of the idea of even kissing someone) and not<br/>
having had a model for a healthy sexual relationship, I found it<br/>
difficult to set boundaries or to know what I wanted in a<br/>
relationship.  It took a long time for me to take control of my own<br/>
sexuality and I think I missed out on a lot of fun, and spent far too<br/>
much time projecting the image of a victim.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, it&#39;s fairly natural for kids to have some curiosity<br/>
about each other.  I also think that for very young kids, once that<br/>
curiosity is satisfied, without the hormones to back it up, they are<br/>
going to lose interest pretty quickly.  I think we have a fairly<br/>
healthy attitude towards sexuality at our house.  Nudity is common, we<br/>
use appropriate language to talk about our bodies, she knows where<br/>
babies come from.  After one game of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; she said someone<br/>
was dared to kiss her.  I did have a little internal knee jerk &quot;Oh<br/>
no!&quot; reaction, but to her I just sort of laughed and asked if the<br/>
little boy had kissed her. She said, &quot;No, he didn&#39;t want to, so he had<br/>
to take another dare,&quot; then she laughed and added, &quot;I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to.  I don&#39;t want to kiss anyone!&quot;  We had a little discussion<br/>
about that in which I mentioned how much I look forward to a kiss from<br/>
her dad when he gets home from work.  She rolled her eyes at this,<br/>
&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re grown-ups...and he&#39;s your husband.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With my daughter, I&#39;ve been hesitant to bring up these new playground<br/>
rules.  She says they like playing in the bushes because they make<br/>
trails and little club houses there.  She says sometimes she and her<br/>
friends want privacy to avoid having to negotiate with younger<br/>
siblings.  This corresponds with the type of play she has preferred at<br/>
home - making little houses out of natural materials, carving out<br/>
little private spaces in which to play.<br/>
<br/>
I admit to having asked her and her friend not to play in the bushes<br/>
one afternoon and basically, I just said that her friend&#39;s mom wasn&#39;t<br/>
comfortable with it, so while playing with her friend, we needed to<br/>
respect that.  That afternoon, the kids went into the<br/>
bushes anyway, but without first telling me where they were going<br/>
(they usually do) and they didn&#39;t come out until we had several<br/>
anxious parents, myself included, calling their names repeatedly and<br/>
bush-whacking up the hill to where we thought they might be.  She&#39;s<br/>
only seven, and so I do need to know where she is.  I&#39;m more worried<br/>
about not knowing where she is for an extended period of time than<br/>
whether or not she and her buddy are stealing kisses in the bushes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want her to get the idea that there is anything inherently<br/>
shameful about what they are doing, if anything.  She&#39;s pretty<br/>
headstrong.  I doubt anyone could wheedle her into doing anything she<br/>
wasn&#39;t comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
I have read Judith Levine&#39;s &quot;Harmful to Minors&quot; and while it is<br/>
helpful in a more academic type discussion about how the media and<br/>
changing cultural values fuel increased hysteria about the sexual<br/>
abuse of children, it&#39;s not heavy on advice to the average parent<br/>
treading a delicate path.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing the collective wisdom<br/>
of the group on this,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969568305">Hi Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  I think you have articulated what I&#39;m feeling about some of<br/>
the other parents involved - the sex aspect is being overemphasized<br/>
and I think coloring the discussion a little too much.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, my first concern is my daughter&#39;s safety and I think we&#39;re<br/>
doing a pretty good job there.  We&#39;ve never pushed the whole &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
talk to strangers&quot; thing and she has grown up feeling free to trust<br/>
her instincts in whatever situations come her way.  If there is<br/>
something she doesn&#39;t quite feel equipped to deal with, she&#39;s not<br/>
afraid to come and ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
To clarify - in this situation, I don&#39;t think she is uncomfortable or<br/>
unsafe at all.  Given my daughter&#39;s personality, I don&#39;t think she is<br/>
being pressured into doing anything she doesn&#39;t want to and from my<br/>
conversations with her, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything happening to<br/>
cause concern.  <br/>
<br/>
My concern is how to explain the new playground rules to her.  After<br/>
the recent games of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, the consensus seems to be that a<br/>
sexual element has been introduced to the children&#39;s play and that we<br/>
should do everything we can to stop it, including introducing some<br/>
pretty arbitrary playground rules - banning the game and telling the<br/>
children that playing in the bushes (within earshot, but out of sight)<br/>
is no longer allowed. <br/>
<br/>
Since my daughter thinks &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; is just a fun game wherein<br/>
she and her friends get to &quot;dare each other do wacky things&quot;, I am<br/>
finding it hard to explain why the game makes some of the adults feel<br/>
uncomfortable.  The same with the bushes.  I believe my daughter when<br/>
she tells me she likes playing there for a specific set of reasons,<br/>
none of which have to do with sexual exploration.  It therefore seems<br/>
arbitrary to ban this. <br/>
<br/>
She asks me outright, &quot;Why aren&#39;t we allowed to play in there?&quot;  and<br/>
&quot;Why was it okay before, but not now?&quot;.  The answer to this question,<br/>
in my mind is adult hysteria, but that&#39;s not the answer that&#39;s going<br/>
to satisfy my seven year old and, out of respect for the other<br/>
parents, I&#39;m not going to take that approach.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that articulates my concern a little better.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kirsten<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you agree with these unoffical rules? Were you there when they <br/>
were discussed?<br/>
<br/>
If it were my kid I would say - you are allowed to play this but <br/>
some of the other parents do not want to have their kids playing- if <br/>
she asked why then state that the parents think this game might lead <br/>
to dares that kids feel pressured to take and the parents do not <br/>
know if their kid would just say no. <br/>
<br/>
I think you said she was 7 so I think that would be a good <br/>
conversation to have with her. <br/>
<br/>
You can make it less about being sexual and more about the ability <br/>
to say NO when you do not want to do something. <br/>
<br/>
Are you able to maybe take this approach with the other parents? You <br/>
could say they could make dares that do not involve touching each <br/>
other. So no kissing dares but maybe go kiss the tree. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps in some way<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Out of respect for your 7 year old (and your relationship with her), you may<br/>
just want to explain it *is* their hysteria causing this arbitrariness.<br/>
They are responding out of fear. They&#39;re afraid their children don&#39;t<br/>
understand how to keep themselves safe. Explain that you trust her to *trust<br/>
her tummy* (how I explained to my kids the warning our own instinct gives<br/>
us), the other mommies don&#39;t have that trust in their kids. Talk of how<br/>
*she* is good at protecting herself from other people touching/acting/doing<br/>
things she is uncomfortable with, and other kids just don&#39;t know how to do<br/>
that, so their parents feel they must do it for them.<br/>
We&#39;re dealing with a similar situation... Hayden, 8.75, is good friends with<br/>
two little girls who are 9 & 11 (NOT unschoolers). I&#39;ve known their mother<br/>
almost 30 years and the kids have known each other for all of their lives.<br/>
Their dad says &quot;no sleepovers with boys&quot; period. The kids want to get<br/>
together and have big chunks of time to play and visit... Dad says NO. Does<br/>
he really think Hayden and the girls would do anything? I don&#39;t think so,<br/>
but he has it in his head that Boys are evil for Girls and it doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
that it&#39;s not just any boy, it&#39;s HAYDEN. The rule is the rule is the rule.<br/>
I&#39;ve got a very brokenhearted boy at my house whom I&#39;m comforting without<br/>
knowing exactly what to say... The Dad is being stupid. period. I can&#39;t<br/>
justify, I can&#39;t explain (I won&#39;t, in fact, as I don&#39;t know how to explain<br/>
the guy&#39;s perspective without leaving some weird shadow of what it means to<br/>
be male in Hayden&#39;s mind...) -- I&#39;m left with saying it just sucks and we&#39;ll<br/>
do what we can to get you guys together without it being an overnighter.<br/>
I think the worst part is that we had sleepovers all the time when Hannah<br/>
was alive...<br/>

It sounds like you already are doing that. When we encounter arbitrary<br/>

don&#39;t want their child doing x,y,z and leave it at that. This has<br/>
sometimes led to &quot;but Jalen (or whomever) gets to_______&quot; from some<br/>

Sometimes after explaining that the other parents don&#39;t like their<br/>

If there is no harm then I&#39;m not going to place that burden on my child.<br/>

And here *I* would be the obnoxious weirdo!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to inform these parents exactly how ridiculous they are being! <br/>
Shake some damned sense into them. I couldn&#39;t sit by while they made <br/>
stupid rules that made no sense, and I would have to be sure that the <br/>
kids heard me be so outraged---my kids and theirs.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know....I think that just going along with nonsense <br/>
is...well...nonsensical. And if the parents thought that not allowing <br/>
their children to have these freedoms *now* was going to keep their <br/>
children out of trouble ---well, they were just nuts.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t let all that ignorance go unchallenged.<br/>
