<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579457105">Lovely subject line, eh?  Something kept pinging in my brain that I<br/>
had heard an article recently about children with bowel problems.<br/>
Constipation and the connection to neurology rather than diet.  I<br/>
finally found it.  The doctor interviewed is in Portland, OR.  It&#39;s a<br/>
good read and something to ask your doctor about.  From what it sounds<br/>
this is a simple procedure which has almost immediate results.  Maybe<br/>
it is something that could help your son.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I remembered this is because all three of my children have<br/>
suffered from bowel problems.  I thought I had screwed up somewhere as<br/>
a parent because I could urine train them but not bm train them.<br/>
Emily and Mary Elayne both have grown out of this condition, but Keon<br/>
continues to have problems with this.  He has only recently been able<br/>
to express to us that he truly doesn&#39;t feel himself eliminating<br/>
sometimes.  We are actually looking into this procedure for Keon to<br/>
see if it would help.  It gets truly frustrating as a parent to have<br/>
to be washing poopy undies all the time and having them wear out<br/>
faster because you have to bleach them and having an upset little boy<br/>
because his favorite pair of navy boxers with dog bones now are hot<br/>
pink after so many washings and bleachings.  :(<br/>
<br/>
We did medication:  limited help.  We did diet changes:  no help<br/>
except those that were extremely laxative in nature and then it had<br/>
the reverse effect.  We did punishments: HA!  We did rewards:  Double<br/>
HA!  We did ever present parenting:  nada.  I remember hearing this<br/>
article several months ago in a haze of sleep and suddenly waking up<br/>
and going, &quot;Wait, they could be talking about my kids!&quot;  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until recently that I remembered I was going to do research on it and<br/>
made a note of it.  Your post put me into action to find the article<br/>
again<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the article:<br/>

<br/>
Instead of bleach, I would suggest Soil Love. I find<br/>
it at my local 99 cent store. But if you can&#39;t find<br/>
it, I&#39;ll send you a bottle. I use it more than bleach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite blanket was in my dad&#39;s trunk for years<br/>
because he accidently spilled oil all over it. Soil<br/>
love got it out. And it didn&#39;t ruin the fabric. Which<br/>
I worried over because my mother made the blanket for<br/>
me. <br/>

I doubt it&#39;s much fun for the child.. Boxers can be  replaced, your child&#39;s <br/>
emotions cannot. <br/>
 I doubt it&#39;s on purpose or to cause you to  wash. I don&#39;t think you intended <br/>
to focus on that but you did.. <br/>
 <br/>
*How is the child? How does he feel when this happens  and mostly what is <br/>
your reaction to it?  How old are we talking? <br/>
 <br/>
Children react to their parents emotions they hear the  sighs(not saying you <br/>
do).. <br/>
Watch him (without him knowing).. Is he hiding behind a  chair, corner or a <br/>
room. Again age is a huge factor. If we are talking about a 3  or a 4 yr old I <br/>
certainly would give it more time.<br/>
Know when he goes bc if he is holding  it&#39;s dangerous(you should be able to <br/>
tell from the stool he is passing). If  you giving him softeners that will <br/>
trigger accidents also.<br/>
 <br/>
 My thoughts are.. IF his movements are  uncomfortable and he&#39;s holding then <br/>
gets in a situation where he can&#39;t and then  it happens something to loosen <br/>
those stools are needed along with a diet look..  Med&#39;s that bring on movements <br/>
are torture to a child with this  issue.  Fiber in his food may be needed. <br/>
Privacy to go? Again age is a  factor..<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting you skip the medical eval though I  would look at age and <br/>
triggers first. <br/>
