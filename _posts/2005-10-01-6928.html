<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029876608">I know many of you are in touch with Valerie but for those who might not<br/>
have heard, she was able to go see her house in Lake Charles and was<br/>
please that the damage isn&#39;t too extensive.  <br/>
They&#39;re still asking people not to move back in to Lake Charles but I<br/>
think she plans to visit frequently to get things in order.   She&#39;s<br/>
staying in Baton Rouge for the time being. <br/>
