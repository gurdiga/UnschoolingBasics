<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342702334">I hear you!  After I went to the waterpark gathering we returned home<br/>
and I suddenly realized how I have been behaving!  Just awful!  I&#39;m<br/>
pregnant and I KNOW that it has something to do with it.  i just<br/>
didn&#39;t know how hard it was going to be this time around!<br/>
<br/>
What I really wanted to address, was your children&#39;s desire to leave<br/>
school sooner than yours.  I was wondering what security you were<br/>
waiting for?  If its the legal stuff and the paperwork than I can<br/>
somewhat understand.  (Although I don&#39;t have to worry about that<br/>
myself, so I don&#39;t quite understand it well)  If it isn&#39;t legal stuff,<br/>
than what security are you waiting for?  Is it worth prolonging their<br/>
suffering in the public school system?  I wonder if you should<br/>
consider just letting them come home.  In my eyes, the sooner the<br/>
better.  They will most likely be deschooling for quite some time<br/>
anyway.  There is not a lot of preparation there.  It&#39;s a process for<br/>
all of you.  <br/>
<br/>
My two cents.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167322100">The question of security:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a member of this list for some time but I&#39;ve been lurking.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was a sahm, happily unschooling, until we became homeless in 2006.  I got<br/>
a job where I could bring the children (working at my UU church) but then<br/>
the position got cut.  We are in a program that requires both adults to work<br/>
- so I had to go and find some full time work.  This meant Safiya (9) and<br/>
Dakari (8) had to go to school.  I&#39;m working on becoming a personal trainer<br/>
so that I can still be &quot;working&quot; but create my own schedule.  That, however,<br/>
won&#39;t be final until the late spring.  Then we can make the transition.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m no newbie to the whole unschooling thing, but I&#39;m &quot;new again&quot; because<br/>
the past year and a half has been so rocky that we&#39;ve fallen away from the<br/>
unschooling philosophy.  And with dh that&#39;s not a good thing at all - he was<br/>
never into it to begin with.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122704151">When I replied to you I had a funny feeling that the &quot;security issue&quot;<br/>
was beyond anything I had in mind.  Guess i should go with my gut.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Becca says:   This group and any other group geared to cs/unschooling/peace is a great place to be....    I was introduced to unschooling a couple of years ago from a friend that does (and I must say has a great relationship with her 14 year old).  Anyway, I stayed plugged into to ps system (pre-school and 1/2 year of kindergarten) for a while.  This January 10th (I think)  I took the full plunge into unschooling!! And I will say that it is challenging to stop alllllll the bad habits  -- sending to room, spanking (eeek), yelling... etc.  But I truly think making the commitment and sticking to it is worth it.   That last few weeks I&#39;ve been on reading, posting and sucking all the info I can about  deschooling and unschooling.   Maybe  sometimes too much since it has taken away from paying closer attention to my boys -- but I have needed the extra knowledge and support to know that everything is going to be just fine.  About the third week into it now I feel that I can do<br/>
 this  and fears are diminishing (and my mother is even easing up-- she was very negative when I first took Ian out&gt;&gt; oh well her problem) .    Anyway, just thought I let you know that I can relate to you and many more on this list also.   Sometimes statements from some will feel very direct but I personally feel we need this to get us over the  hump  --- Most of these folks have been right where we are standing. <br/>
  Also keep visualizing the peaceful home and it will be so.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386787145">Hi Maisha ---<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back!!<br/>
<br/>
I remember all the stuff you were going through - glad to hear that  <br/>
things might be more secure for you all.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is that you start with saying yes more often.<br/>
Really - just that.<br/>
<br/>
You have lots of reasons to have your patience worn down, so take care  <br/>
of yourself, forgive yourself, and remember that you can heal yourself  <br/>
by being gentle and sweet with your kids!<br/>
