<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013821303">So, surfing the internet, I found a resource group, but at this <br/>
point, with my son only 10 months old and me (I hate to admit) <br/>
working full-time, I&#39;m still gathering ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question:<br/>
I come from a very hard-working family, definate &quot;Protestant Work <br/>
Ethic&quot; there. My mother is a work-a-holic. I find myself fighting <br/>
between ideals of freedom and natural living contrasted with &#39;must <br/>
work to make money&#39; so-called &#39;traditional&#39; values. Unschooling frees <br/>
kids (and their parents) from the constraints of the typical school <br/>
day - &#39;work for kids&#39;. Much as it would be my hope that I&#39;d raise my <br/>
child to be a musician or dancer or organic farmer, how do I prepare <br/>
him for the reality of most people&#39;s working-life: 8 - 5 stuck at a <br/>
desk, working on someone else&#39;s schedule? I believe that changing the <br/>
values we instill in our children changes the values of the society <br/>
as a whole, but before they get to be in charge, they have to deal <br/>
with my parents generation, and the traditionalists of my generation, <br/>
not to mention their peers who will be products of the No Child Left <br/>
Behind Act. <br/>
<br/>
How much faith do you put in unschooling as &quot;the right thing to do <br/>
for the individual character&quot; and how much is practical? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help! Its hard sometimes to be confident I&#39;ve got the <br/>
right ideas, that I&#39;m doing the right things, with such nagging <br/>
little questions looming in the distance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s your sticking point. You see that as reality when it  <br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
While most families won&#39;t have the ability to not have at least one  <br/>
person doing some kind of work that brings in money, not all those  <br/>
people working are at a desk, let alone &quot;stuck&quot;. In fact most of the  <br/>
people you meet during the day in the middle of the week are not even  <br/>
at a desk! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And look at that phrase: &quot;Work for a living&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t it be better  <br/>
to &quot;Live for a living&quot;? I suspect you&#39;ve got tunnel vision about  <br/>
working since you&#39;ve grown up with focus on making money so what you  <br/>
do to get that money becomes a big gray dull box. In many ways it&#39;s  <br/>
like school. When the focus is on getting a diploma, the path getting  <br/>
there is tedious and dull and annoying. The goal is to do as little  <br/>
as possible to get to the end.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been so focused on the end goal of work as making money,  <br/>
then work becomes something tedious and dull and to do as little of  <br/>
as possible to get the paycheck. And then, rather than self- <br/>
fulfillment, people tend to focus on what they can buy with what  <br/>
they&#39;ve worked so hard to get. And ultimately it isn&#39;t all that  <br/>
satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
But if, like with unschooling, the focus shifts to finding what you  <br/>
enjoy, finding what makes you bounce out of bed in the morning, then  <br/>
the money will follow. And even if the money isn&#39;t corporate  <br/>
executive huge, it will be a lot more fun working for it *and* it  <br/>
will be easier to put up with less outside of work because the work  <br/>
will be fulfilling.<br/>
<br/>
Your homework for the weekend is to go out and visit people who are  <br/>
working at nondesk jobs and ask about them :-) Look at all the people  <br/>
working in museums, retail stores, restaurants, grocery stores,  <br/>
stables, dog groomers, road crews, landscapers, electricians,  <br/>
photographers, plumbers, auctioneers, sports directors, coaches,  <br/>
personal trainers, florists, bakers, house painters, occupational  <br/>
therapists, dental hygenists, animal control officers, hair  <br/>
dressers ... And then there are part-time-at-desk jobs: reporters  <br/>
(but maybe with laptops the desk may not figure all that often),  <br/>
professors, wedding planners, ministers, field biologists ... But  <br/>
even full-time-desk jobs are not all drone jobs: software engineers,  <br/>
graphic designers, technical writers, computer technicians, video  <br/>
game designers, president ...<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s hardly even touching on the arts or entertainment which  <br/>
make some people nervous as far as stability ;-)<br/>

30 with a part time job as greeter at Wal-Mart. I just think  <br/>
childhood should be about having fun and hang the future. ;-)<br/>

there is about an accountant or help desk operator if that is what<br/>
your child wants to do.  What if he wants to grow up and be an office<br/>

life surrounded by tons of people who are very traditional.  He&#39;s<br/>
looked at oddly because he likes to work from home (so he can have the<br/>
freedom to go do things with his kids), has waist length hair, is a<br/>
flaming liberal, and comes up with solutions in some of the oddest<br/>
ways, *and* has never had a day&#39;s worth of college education but is in<br/>
a professional position surrounded by lots of, uhm, BS holders.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does practical mean?  Does it mean that your child is going to be<br/>
able to sustain himself once he is an adult or does it mean that what<br/>
we are doing is recklessly leading our children down a road of<br/>
poverty?  And the two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.  :)  I&#39;ve seen some<br/>
very creative money making careers that have been started by<br/>
unschoolers.  If I didn&#39;t believe in what I was doing, I wouldn&#39;t do<br/>
it.  I think it helps that I can see my co-parent who has essentially<br/>
unschooled himself over the past 25 years to get to doing something<br/>
that he LOVES!  He&#39;s a computer programmer, network administrator and<br/>
engineer.  His office has 3 computers and 8 monitors (they call it air<br/>
traffic control at work LOL!) where he is found holed up unless he<br/>
happens to be off fixing something.  He hums while he works, comes<br/>
home mostly happy, proud of the work that he does, loves working with<br/>
all the newest and latest gadgets, gets all excited when he finds out<br/>
that he is going to get a new blade server, and is just a &quot;big boy&quot;<br/>
with an expensive &quot;erector set.&quot;  Other people may view his job as<br/>
being &quot;chained to a desk&quot; and &quot;someone else&#39;s schedule.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
see it that way because he *wants* to be there and *loves* being<br/>
there.  He isn&#39;t even daunted by deadlines because he sees them as<br/>
challenges &quot;Can I make this computer program work in 5 days?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not all unschoolers are eclectic wild families.  Not all unschoolers<br/>
are working to become eclectic wild families (although some of us are<br/>
LOL!)  Not all unschooled children are going to grow up to become<br/>
eclectic wild individuals (although some may).  The important thing is<br/>
helping our children lead *happy* and interesting lives.  And what<br/>
your child finds interesting may look a whole lot like what you see as<br/>

<br/>
Why does he need to be prepared for someone else&#39;s life?<br/>
<br/>
He will meet all kinds of people and the ones who are &quot;stuck&quot; will seem like <br/>
sad, stuck people to him.  The ones who are alive and vibrant and who know <br/>
they can do what they love will be the people who inspire him.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t prepare him for much, honestly.  You don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll need in <br/>
thirty years.  But if you help him live the kind of life he wants to today, <br/>
he&#39;ll be prepared to live the kind of life he wants in the future.<br/>
<br/>
You can derail him though.  You can make life seem like it sucks and he&#39;d <br/>
better get used to it, and chances are then, his life will suck.<br/>
<br/>
***How much faith do you put in unschooling as &quot;the right thing to do<br/>

<br/>
For me, faith doesn&#39;t enter into it at all.<br/>
<br/>
When you think about how babies learn, they learn by doing.  No one explains <br/>
to a little baby how to pay attention to, or look for momma.  Babies <br/>
experience having their needs met and then naturally look to the one who has <br/>
met them before to meet them again.    No one explains how to start talking. <br/>
Babies watch and listen to other people and experiment with making noise and <br/>
then with saying words until they&#39;re talking.   No one explains to them how <br/>
to start walking.  The become interested in standing and walking and we give <br/>
them lots of opportunities to do that.<br/>
<br/>
You have been trained to think that learning itself is a thing that in not <br/>
natural to humans and must be put there by teachers.  But humans naturally <br/>
learn and naturally want to do what other humans are doing.  There&#39;s <br/>
evidence all around you in all the kids who aren&#39;t in preschool, who are <br/>
walking and talking and playing and dressing themselves and feeding <br/>
themselves.  In the kids of people like me who aren&#39;t in school at all and <br/>
never have been,  who are pursuing interests and experimenting with ideas <br/>
and in adults who are taking up new hobbies or traveling for fun, or making <br/>
art, even though they&#39;re no longer in school.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to have faith *at all.*  You just have to think.<br/>

Reality? <br/>
That&#39;s never been our reality. Ever. And dh and I weren&#39;t unschooled!!<br/>
Why would that need to be anyone&#39;s reality? <br/>
<br/>
Why would you want to prepare YOUR child for someone elses reality anyway?<br/>
<br/>
If he WANTS to work a 9-5 job behind a desk, unschooling won&#39;t make it<br/>
impossible for him to do that. Unschooling just makes it possible to<br/>
see that our reality is our CHOICE.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many work options in the marketplace for all different<br/>
types of people. There&#39;s always the possibility of running your own<br/>
business and working from home. There&#39;s the possibility of NOT working<br/>
too. Life is all about choices. Life is short and ideally spent<br/>
focusing on things you love, not things you fear.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Deb.<br/>
<br/>
Faith is about believing in things without any proof...not something I<br/>
tend to practice in life.;)<br/>
I don&#39;t need to have &quot;faith&quot; because I&#39;ve got four children that are<br/>
(almost)17, 13, 9 and 5 that are learning beautifully every day of<br/>
their lives and all but the 5 year old are reading, having never been<br/>
taught or given a single lesson.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need faith, I KNOW unschooling works. I KNOW people can learn<br/>
whatever they need, whenever they need it. Trust and belief I have an<br/>
abundance of, but faith? Nah.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I have lived the life of our choosing (often with tough<br/>
financial impact) for a long time now. We&#39;ve lived in nicer houses,<br/>
and really small, older houses. We&#39;ve driven newer cars and really old<br/>
junkers. We&#39;ve worked for ourselves and for others by choice. <br/>
We&#39;re living exactly where we want to, doing exactly the work we<br/>
choose and having lots of time for family connections. I KNOW life is<br/>
what you make it and I have no doubt my kids will do the same.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I put my faith in unschooling as the best way for a person to do what  <br/>
interests them, what they are passionate about. This is, imo, the  <br/>
best way to prepare for a career, too.<br/>
<br/>
My mom loved children of all ages, but especially 3 and 4 year olds.  <br/>
In case nobody has noticed, preschool (nursery school, in her time)  <br/>
teachers often make no more than minimum wage - it is definitely a  <br/>
VERY low-paying career. But she LOVED her career and she was  <br/>
passionate about learning everything she could about child  <br/>
development and learning in young children. That led her to  <br/>
eventually earning a masters degree in early childhood education. She  <br/>
got involved in many local organizations related to young children  <br/>
and put in MANY hours over many many years helping parents of young  <br/>
children. She tirelessly protested the &quot;pushing-down&quot; of curriculum  <br/>
and too-early teaching of reading in kindergarten and younger. She  <br/>
worked on campaigns to keep academics out of preschools.<br/>
<br/>
She ended up running a laboratory preschool where people could learn  <br/>
how to run a developmentally appropriate program which consisted  <br/>
ENTIRELY of free play and which was not a daycare program (the  <br/>
children were there for 2 1/2 hours, up to 3 times per week). She  <br/>
created the program at a high school and she directed it for 30  <br/>
years. High school kids and other adults from the community could  <br/>
learn there.<br/>
<br/>
And, by the way, she made enough money to be able to live well - well  <br/>
enough to travel EVERY summer all over the world - not surprisingly,  <br/>
her travels mostly involved visiting early childhood programs in  <br/>
Norway, Germany, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, Austria,  <br/>

curious what she thought of them, if you know.  I think very highly of <br/>

&gt;  eventually earning a masters degree in early childhood education. She<br/>
&gt;  got involved in many local organizations related to young children<br/>
&gt;  and put in MANY hours over many many years helping parents of young<br/>
&gt;  children. She tirelessly protested the &quot;pushing-down&quot; of curriculum<br/>
&gt;  and too-early teaching of reading in kindergarten and younger. She<br/>
&gt;  worked on campaigns to keep academics out of preschools.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  She ended up running a laboratory preschool where people could learn<br/>
&gt;  how to run a developmentally appropriate program which consisted<br/>
&gt;  ENTIRELY of free play and which was not a daycare program (the<br/>
&gt;  children were there for 2 1/2 hours, up to 3 times per week). She<br/>
&gt;  created the program at a high school and she directed it for 30<br/>
&gt;  years. High school kids and other adults from the community could<br/>
&gt;  learn there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  And, by the way, she made enough money to be able to live well - well<br/>
&gt;  enough to travel EVERY summer all over the world - not surprisingly,<br/>
&gt;  her travels mostly involved visiting early childhood programs in<br/>

Our society needs &quot;worker bees&quot;---those folks that sit behind desks and<br/>
stand in assembly lines and stock groceries.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not rearing worker bees.<br/>
<br/>
Schools produce actually many more worker bees than we need. You can<br/>
see it in their eyes. Children who have already given up on dreams, and<br/>
the only &quot;Truth&quot; they know is the life you&#39;re suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
That is not my children&#39;s Truth. That&#39;s not their Reality---now or in<br/>
their futures.<br/>
<br/>
Living a life of dull drudgery in order to prepare for a life of dull<br/>
drudgery will get you a life of dull drudgery. Worker bees.<br/>
<br/>
We lead rich lives full of fun and spontaneity and interesting things<br/>
and people because those are the lives we hope our children will<br/>
pursue---those are the lives that they have NOW. I doubt they&#39;ll go<br/>
looking for dull desk jobs.<br/>
<br/>
I tell them often that *THEY*---and only they---get to choose their<br/>
destinies.<br/>
<br/>
Couple of queens?! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s bigger than school would have you believe. Faith? Naw--just look<br/>
into their eyes.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This sounds very similar to my mother&#39;s work story.<br/>
She also started at a preschool that paid very little, but she LOVED<br/>
her job, LOVED the kids and put her heart and soul into it. I remember<br/>
helping her with lesson plans when I was a young teen, drawing up felt<br/>
figures for her storytelling and such.<br/>
<br/>
She went back to school for her EC degree and eventually got into<br/>
library work. She was much loved in the community for her storytimes<br/>
and passion for children&#39;s lit.<br/>
<br/>
It all started with a low paying job, that she would have stayed at<br/>
because she loved it. <br/>
<br/>
And desk jobs aren&#39;t always for &quot;worker bees&quot; anyway. Lots and lots of<br/>
people ENJOY desk jobs. I worked a 9-5 kinda job at a desk right out<br/>
of high school, taking reservations for a big hotel chain. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
very much pay, but it was a great way to get out on my own and spread<br/>
my wings.  I learned some useful stuff there. <br/>
<br/>
The important thing isn&#39;t what kind of job you have, it&#39;s that you<br/>
feel empowered to choose your path at any time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193283">She was not a huge Montessori fan - in practice. She liked the ideas  <br/>
of respecting children&#39;s time as significant and &quot;real&quot; and that  <br/>
children learn best when choosing their own activities and  <br/>
structuring their own time - but the schools themselves are too  <br/>
strict about doing things &quot;right.&quot; The equipment is overly  <br/>
specialized and is supposed to be used in certain ways - the teachers  <br/>
give &quot;lessons&quot; that are very structured - for everything from  <br/>
handwashing to writing. There is also not much value given to pretend- <br/>
play and creativity - usually no paint, no dress-ups, no props for  <br/>
general use for dramatic play. The classes are too large - too many  <br/>
children per adult and &quot;orderliness&quot; is highly valued.<br/>
<br/>
My mom&#39;s school was far more free - no kid ever had to do anything he/ <br/>
she didn&#39;t choose to do - all their time was &quot;free time.&quot; The job of  <br/>
the adults was to make it possible for the kids to do what they  <br/>
wanted to do, to help them when they needed help, and to provide an  <br/>
environment that was filled with opportunities and experiences.<br/>

My oldest daughter went to a public Montessori School. At the time I wished they had split the children into groups, because there were 4 or 5 bullies in the class that dominated certain areas of the classroom. My daughter was mild mannered and shy and therefore avoided the rowdy kids and the bullies, and missed out on spending any time in certain areas of the classroom as a result. I felt this was not her choice, but rather forced on her by circumstances. But that is possibly due to the nature of schooling and not the Montessori method itself. I pulled her out of that school because of teacher retention problems, and she went to a traditional public school. She actually liked it better having her own desk and knowing that she had her own space. She felt safer there, it was less chaotic. <br/>

how do I prepare<br/>
him for the reality of most people&#39;s working-life: 8 - 5 stuck at a<br/>
desk, working on someone else&#39;s schedule? I believe that changing the<br/>
values we instill in our children changes the values of the society<br/>
as a whole, but before they get to be in charge, they have to deal<br/>
with my parents generation, and the traditionalists of my generation,<br/>
not to mention their peers who will be products of the No Child Left<br/>
Behind Act.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where in the WORLD are you getting these &quot;facts?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is that *your* reality?<br/>
<br/>
My children don&#39;t deal with your parents&#39; generation---not in the way <br/>
you&#39;re suggesting. The older one works and plays with members of my <br/>
parents&#39; generation and is treated as an equal. He has friends of all <br/>
ages because he seeks them out as mentors and friends.<br/>
<br/>
If *you* see yourself as less-than, you will be treated as less-than. <br/>
Cameron is on equal footing.<br/>
<br/>
As for the NCLBA children, I doubt they&#39;ll be a very big influence on <br/>
my children or their lives. NCLBA children won&#39;t think of themselves as <br/>
worthy of much of anything becasue that&#39;s how they&#39;ve been treated. <br/>
They *may* feel &quot;entitled&quot; to services and such because that&#39;s how <br/>
they&#39;ve grown up, but my children will be OK with going AFTER what they <br/>
want instead of expecting the lottery to come their way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a different mindset. I&#39;m not &quot;preparing&quot; my children for <br/>
adulthood. We&#39;re living life now. As we do, we&#39;re collecting the skills <br/>
we need now and fine-tuning them as we go. They&#39;ll *be* prepared as a <br/>
side effect because they&#39;re *living* it NOW.<br/>
