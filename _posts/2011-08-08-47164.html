<div id="ygrps-yiv-453287918">Hi, I am very new to the group but I&#39;ve been doing much  research about the<br/>
options we will have unschooling.  There is the local library which teaches<br/>
classes in computers, at least here in Baton Rouge; there is also this site<br/>
called zero tuition college where kids can pair with mentors; there are<br/>
continuing education course offered at any nearby university or college<br/>
(these cost a bit); there are thrift stores that sell older computers really<br/>
cheap (you could get a book o computer repair and let him just take the old<br/>
thing apart and learn), maybe someone would be willing to donate one as<br/>
well....just a few suggestions...In Louisiana I believe the kids have to be<br/>
15 to work legally..<br/>
Peace<br/>
