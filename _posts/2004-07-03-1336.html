<div id="ygrps-yiv-672289387">I know many here are seeing the damage my roomate is doing. I wanted <br/>
to share the situation. <br/>
<br/>
 Her and her son where getting away from her EX in CA. She had no <br/>
place to live, and no job. BUT the company she worked for said they <br/>
would hire her out here. She had been my best friend for years, but <br/>
clearly not close as we lived 3000 miles away. I had no idea she was <br/>
like this, none at all. <br/>
<br/>
 So she moves away from everything she knew to start over and it <br/>
seems like she is not learning anything at all. It took her months to <br/>
start the job and then she got fired. We are NOW in a very bad way <br/>
when it comes to money, all the savings is gone and all the bills are <br/>
due. <br/>
<br/>
 Mean while she is still in the hospital for her breathing problems. <br/>
She is supposed to start her new job next week. He and I agree on few <br/>
things as it turns out. But I just can not kick her out. She smokes <br/>
out side as asked by us, she does not hit her son in front of my <br/>
family as we asked her, and she is working on not yelling at them. <br/>
But there is just something wrong with her..... <br/>
<br/>
 She wanted my husband to drop her son off to her at the hospital <br/>
tonight before his double shift. I asked who would pick him up and <br/>
she said he would stay over night with her and go home with her when <br/>
she is discarged. He is 4 years old! She has no money to buy food for <br/>
him and nothing for him to do. Her responce was that the nurses would <br/>
help her. They are not even letting her walk the halls yet. I told <br/>
her I would ask him and let her go, got sick of her complaing about <br/>
problems she has gotten her self into. So I call the hospital and ask <br/>
them about what she is planning and they say it will not happen and <br/>
if she tried they would be forced to call social services on her as <br/>
there is no one to get her son when my hubby is working and her <br/>
neighbor friend is away. So they said they would talk to her about <br/>
it. She calls me latter in short telling me off and saying she will <br/>
do what every she wants with her son and that she can not sleep <br/>
without him and on and on and on. All this time she told us he could <br/>
not sleep without her, thus they share a bed. The last few nights <br/>
have proven he has no problem sleeping with out Mommy. Soooo it shows <br/>
she is dependent on him emotionally not the other way around. <br/>
great... more problems. So in short she is not talking to me. <br/>
<br/>
 I am leaving it all up to hubby now. I have tried. I just have no <br/>
clue what else to do. If she stays and changes and works they we have <br/>
a chance to get out of the whole, if she leaves/kicked out, then we <br/>
will be in a bad way for a very long time and not even sure we could <br/>
make it. Having her hear has hurt us in ways I never thought of. I am <br/>
so sick of having the bleeding heart and always feeling like I need <br/>
to take care of other people out side my family. So blind I swear it. <br/>
<br/>
 Ok so that is the situation. <br/>
<br/>
 I am scared, and feel broken. But oddly, in those amazing moments I <br/>
have with the kids, none of matters. I swear I am living off of those <br/>
moments now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242834278">Hi Kimmy - I can see it would be scary to not have the backup of your<br/>
roommate helping out financially - but really it&#39;s just the illusion of a<br/>
backup because not only has she been a drain on your family emotionally, but<br/>
it sounds like she has been financially as well.<br/>
<br/>
Crystal is adorable.  I love the way her smile comes out her eyes :0).  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
This is really starting to get beyond the scope of Unschooling issues to me,<br/>
and I feel very concerned for you and your little sweetheart. In fact I have<br/>
been vaguely worried about you ever since your earliest posts when you were<br/>
writing about self-control issues, and then your mysterious vomiting. It&#39;s<br/>
difficult to know how to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling &quot;broken&quot; is especially telling. You can&#39;t be a proper mother to your<br/>
dear little girl if you are broken. <br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t be responsible for your happiness either - it is too much for a<br/>
child to have to be your only source of joy. Believe me, I spent my<br/>
childhood feeling responsible for my mother&#39;s emotions, and it is amazing<br/>
how this dynamic can last for ever and color your relationship negatively.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633704518">Kimmy, <br/>
Crystal is just adorable.  She sounds so much like my little boy, <br/>
Lucas.  Sometimes I feel like he is going to drive me crazy!  But he <br/>
is just the most amazing kid!  I truly hope you can get out of the <br/>
roommate situation asap.  I feel sorry for the little boy.... It <br/>
sounds like it is really causing problems with your family.  Where <br/>
do you live again?  I also hope you can find some peace with <br/>
yourself.  You sound like a person whose heart and mind are in the <br/>
right place, you are just overburdened with more than your share of <br/>
life&#39;s stresses.  Hang in there, and seek help if you feel you need <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
