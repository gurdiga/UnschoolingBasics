<div id="ygrps-yiv-981485747">We just hooked up to cable after 3 years without. Ds (5) likes some <br/>
NickJr. shows: Bob the Builder, Little Einsteins, Wonder Pets, Blues <br/>
Clues, Thomas, Wiggles, Jay Jay, etc. And we are trying to figure <br/>
which other shows are not &quot;mean or scary&quot;. Anyone have suggestions for <br/>
children&#39;s shows which are interesting, action oriented or activity <br/>
type shows that he might enjoy? He doesn&#39;t like movies with anyone <br/>
being sad or scared. He has no concept of guns at this point. But, we <br/>
desire to expand his world with exposure to shows that are <br/>
entertaining. We have been fascinated at the depth and breadth of his <br/>
awareness of life through the videos that he chooses. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>

if &quot;Cartoon Network&quot; is something separate that we need to buy or if <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have Noggin?  We love Noggin here. During the daytime it is full of<br/>
all the really good children&#39;s shows that used to be on Nick and Disney, but<br/>
were cancelled due to &quot;changing times&quot;  Sweet shows like Little Bear,<br/>
Allegra&#39;s Window, and Gulla Gulla Island.  Also check to see what local PBS<br/>
station you have.  My kids are older and have a more diversified viewing so<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the current shows are on PBS besides Sesame  Street.<br/>
<br/>
Does he like real life shows?  What about cooking?  My kids love watching<br/>
the Food Network and there are quite a few shows that they life such as<br/>
Unwrapped and How Things are Made (I think that is the title) that are on<br/>
various channels.  They show how different foods and machines are cooked and<br/>
made.  Quite fascinating.  If he likes that sort of thing he may even like<br/>
Mythbusters.  Really cool show that has lots of engineering and science all<br/>
wrapped up in a fun and funny show.  Not that I think it warrants watching<br/>
because it has science, but I am always amazed at how much of it my kids are<br/>
picking up by watching an &quot;entertaining&quot; show.<br/>

shows. It seems like we might need Noggin too if we don&#39;t have it. <br/>
NickJr was ds&#39;s priorty, as best we could discern based upon video <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235616931">My daughter Courtney loves watching the Discovery channel! Anything on mummies and ancient Egypt, she&#39;ll love. My hubby likes that stuff too so they watch it together. She&#39;s really been interested in skeletons and bones and muscles (ick) but its cool. We just go to the library and see what we can dig up.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150144679">Thanks for the start of this post.  As I said before I decided to look <br/>
into TIVOing a few different shows for dd since she had lost interest <br/>
in Sesame Street and Dora for the time being.  With her dog &quot;fetish&quot; <br/>
right now I decided to Tivo the two Clifford shows, &quot;Clifford&#39;s Puppy <br/>
Days&quot; and &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;.  I once heard that the Puppy <br/>
Days seems to be better since the other deals a lot with schooly <br/>
issues for the owner, Emily Elisabeth and her friends.  I was <br/>
pleasently  surprised by today&#39;s episode in which Clifford and his <br/>
friends tried to solve the needs of their grumpy neighbor Mr. <br/>
Beakman.  We watched them both, and I&#39;d reccomend both of them based <br/>
on the episodes I saw.<br/>
