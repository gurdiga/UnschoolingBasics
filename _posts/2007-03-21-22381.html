<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it too much on the computer. Is that okay? Or its the deschooling<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *is* okay. There&#39;s a whole field of study called &quot;information <br/>
science&quot; that has grown up over the past few decades. It used to be <br/>
called &quot;library science&quot;. Does that help you feel better about it? <br/>
Keep in mind that you have a lot more deschooling to do than your <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, a kid spending Lots of time doing <br/>
anything is filling a need and/or following a passion. That&#39;s Great! <br/>
People of all age learn best persuing things that interest them. In <br/>
persuit of passions people learn *amazing* things. <br/>

&gt; Is everything okay with that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think of it this way - if he were cleaning his room or working a <br/>
page of math problem, would you be okay with him &quot;finishing&quot; before <br/>
going to do something fun? This is part of supporting his learning <br/>
process - he gets to decide what&#39;s important enough to &quot;finish&quot; and <br/>
what can wait. Or be discarded.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will freak out!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling takes courage. It doesn&#39;t always seem that way when <br/>
we&#39;re frisking about the park picking wildflowers while other kids <br/>
are in school (guess what I did yesterday!) but it&#39;s true. We have <br/>
to be bigger than our fears of being called bad moms, bigger than <br/>
our fear of failure. You don&#39;t have to tell everything to everyone - <br/>
you don&#39;t have to set yourself up to be criticized! But you do need <br/>
to learn how to ignore the voices in your head that are saying &quot;bad, <br/>
can&#39;t, wrong, don&#39;t, lose, fail, potential, future, control, and <br/>
NO.&quot; And that takes some courage and some trust in yourself. <br/>
<br/>
That was the hard part for me. I can trust my kids. It took me <br/>
awhile to be able to trust myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343212292">My daughters love boxes. Not the older one as much anymore, but when she was<br/>
little she would sleep in them in the living room. I have some really cute<br/>
pictures of her snuggled up at the age of 7 or so in her big box. I remember<br/>
a friend making the comment that most mom&#39;s would let there kids play in the<br/>
box in the a couple days then it had to go, and she thought it was great<br/>
that I let them keep them until they HAD to trashed because they were<br/>
falling apart. Some of the really big ones have went to the shed for while<br/>
just to come in again another time. The youngest still loves them any size<br/>
if she sees one, it&#39;s hers.<br/>

demystifies, destigmatizes and has no power.  No more or less than books or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792546662">We got rid of our TV before our children were born.  Had nothing to do with children, just that Star Trek Next Generation went off the air, dh didn&#39;t like the newer Star Treks and I&#39;d always wanted to live with the TV anyway.  We very occasionally rent DVDs to watch on the computer or when we&#39;re at grandparents&#39; houses, but basically we&#39;re just not big TV or movie people ourselves and the children certainly don&#39;t ask for it.  (Actually, it was kind of a bummer the last time we stayed in a hotel because they kept bouncing on the beds and I hoped that the TV would entertain them as a novelty.  It didn&#39;t.)  <br/>
<br/>
Sooo... would you go out and get a TV in order that the children had exposure to it?  (I have to say I&#39;m not considering that, but I&#39;m curious what others think.)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815809679">Just wanted to clarify that it was not THIS Melissa who said that. We stopped limiting our <br/>
TV/Computer/Videogames two years ago, and EVERYONE has noticed how much more <br/>
interactive our kids are, how much joy and excitement we now have in our lives. <br/>
Number one is that those items are tools in our life, not icons that &#39;deserve&#39; worship.<br/>
Number two is that I see my three year old has developed very advanced problem solving <br/>
skills. He is mechanicially inclined anyway, but the many games and technology that he <br/>
has been able to master, take apart, reprogram, has been such a benefit for him. There <br/>
has been no negative influence that I have observed, in any of my children. All seven of <br/>
them, because even Avari (15 months) can play Super Monkey Ball on the gamecube.<br/>
I think you&#39;ll get flamed because the studies that &#39;prove&#39; your statement are flawed in that <br/>
there are not children who are receiving the same interaction and support from their <br/>
parents. And Waldorf? Isn&#39;t that the educational program that doesn&#39;t allow toddlers to use <br/>
black crayons? That&#39;s all I remember from that philosophy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am assuming your child has had exposure to tv even if you don&#39;t own one.  <br/>
So if your child asked you to get one - it would be no different than your <br/>
child asking for a bicycle or library card.  TV is  another resource, tool <br/>
or interest.  If you can afford to get one, it shouldn&#39;t be limited because <br/>
you personally aren&#39;t interested.  Its about supporting your childs <br/>
interest.  The question i would have is how much your bias against tv <br/>
affects their ability to ask for it if they should want it?  Are you open <br/>
minded when it comes to something that doesn&#39;t interest you or do your <br/>
opinions leave little room for your children to dispute?<br/>

considers scheduling life around....so we purchased a vcr in order to record <br/>
it when we&#39;re on the road.  she now owns all the seasons available on DVD <br/>
and has admitted that this season is not as interesting...either the writers <br/>
are running out of steam or the characters are getting boring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187080505">In my old &quot;controlling parent&quot; days I thought that I should be ever<br/>
vigilant about tv and what my kids were watching and how much they<br/>
watched etc.   What I have learned over the years is that tv much like<br/>
video games and computers (and junk food and lots of other things!) <br/>
gain more appeal when made taboo!  I observed over the years that<br/>
children that visited our home that came from tv limiting homes would<br/>
sit and watch ANYTHING that was on a television mindlessly and never<br/>
wanted to do anything else, they would sit inside and watch while my<br/>
kids would be outside playing!   My husband LOVES tv... me...not so<br/>
much but that is just me... so limiting tv was never really an idea<br/>
that was going to fly at my house!   What I see in my children is that<br/>
they limit themselves by having been allowed to watch as much as they<br/>
want they realize when they feel foggy from being sedentary too long<br/>
(my 5 yr old hops up and down and flaps when he is excited so tv is<br/>
very active for him!!HA!)   They also chose good programming most of<br/>
the time... Myth Busters, Discovery channel, animal planet, Discovery<br/>
Health, Learning Channel, PBS and so on.   They watch junk too but<br/>
rarely all day long and never with the intensity that I see in their<br/>
TV limited friends.   Their favorite toys are and have always been the<br/>
simple things like blocks,legos, kenex, chalk, crayons, clay etc they<br/>
have never craved toys that &quot;do too much&quot; they like to be creative<br/>
with dressing up, playing with puppets and so forth.    When we first<br/>
got a video game system I worried they would play all the time (and I<br/>
am learning in that case so what!?)  but they didn&#39;t they play when<br/>
they want and decide when they have had enough.  Sometimes they play<br/>
alot of hours in the day and sometimes not.   <br/>
<br/>
I think I have realized over the years that what is stimulating to one<br/>
person may not be to another.  We all have things we do for a lot of<br/>
hours in the day... it could be reading, it could be internet, it<br/>
could be gardening, or a million other things that don&#39;t have the same<br/>
value to everyone... I think it&#39; s more that we chose to use our time<br/>
(and our children chose to use theirs) in ways that are stimulating to<br/>
us and cause us to grow.    Enjoyment is the goal for us because I<br/>
realized a long time ago that happy children (and all people) grow and<br/>
learn more when they are happy.   When I see kids that are so bound up<br/>
in the rules of life at their house that they become surly and dull it<br/>
just breaks my heart.   They seem to get so stagnant from the fear of<br/>
breaking a rule or being chastised for doing something their parents<br/>
see as worthless they just stop doing anything.   Or their parents<br/>
pack their schedules with all the things they think their kids should<br/>
be doing that they never get the chance to find out what they might<br/>
like.   I recently listened to a conversation between a mother and<br/>
child where the child was asking for dance lessons and the mother was<br/>
listing all the activities they were scheduled to do on each day and<br/>
how dance would not fit in... the child said well I don&#39;t really enjoy<br/>
 the art class I am taking could I stop that and do dance instead....<br/>
the mom stood there explaining how it would be wrong to just quit and<br/>
she wasn&#39;t going to raise a quiter!  UGH!   I wanted to say you are<br/>
raising a quitter because you are training her to quit thinking for<br/>
herself!<br/>

<br/>
That describes me perfectly (in the past). I come from a home where tv<br/>
was a &quot;wordly influence&quot; and demonized at every turn. When I went to a<br/>
friends house that&#39;s ALL I wanted to do (much to my friends dismay).<br/>
<br/>
I was laughing about this &quot;tv should be limited&quot; discussion that was<br/>
starting here at the list. It&#39;s sort of ironic, because the timing of<br/>
this discussion happened as I had a house FULL of radically unschooled<br/>
children! I just said goodbye to Danielle Conger who has three<br/>
radically unschooled children, who had a ball with my four radically<br/>
unschooled children taking walks, making ATC&#39;s, climbing trees,<br/>
jumping on the trampoline, playing games, playing with Bratz, running<br/>
through the sprinkler, having a pizza picnic, working out their<br/>
differences OH, and watching a little bit of tv!:)<br/>
<br/>
Out of seven unschoolers, the only ones slightly interested in opting<br/>
out of the other activities were my two teens who have active online<br/>
and gaming lives at the moment. These children had no big fascination<br/>
with tv, yet they had free access to it at all times. In fact, the<br/>
room Danielle&#39;s family slept in has a tv with full cable available.<br/>
<br/>
The tv was on a very small portion of the day. If it had been on more,<br/>
that would be fine too! But it just doesn&#39;t have that much attraction<br/>
when you&#39;ve got friends, water, pizza and trees.:)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a growing body of research that is finding much of the<br/>
&quot;damage&quot; from tv and video games doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
From increased hands-on experience and my radically unschooled<br/>
influence, I find computers to be actually helpful at such a young age.:)<br/>
<br/>
Watching my own (and many other unschooled kids) in action, I KNOW the<br/>
&quot;research&quot; just doesn&#39;t hold up in our lives. I trust the child right<br/>
in front of me more than what some body of &quot;experts&quot; tells me.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, if I trusted the &quot;research&quot; out there, I&#39;d have my kids in<br/>
school, fully vaccinated, going to church and have no tv&#39;s or<br/>
computers in my house. OUr lives are exactly the opposite of all that<br/>
and my kids are thriving. They are creative, interesting and<br/>
interested, curious (yes, even the teens) and thoughtful. <br/>
<br/>
The idea of limiting any part of something my child is interested in<br/>
leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I am not here to be a closed door to<br/>
my children, blocking them from things they want to enjoy. I prefer to<br/>
be an avenue that helps them get where they want to go and attain the<br/>
desires of their heart......which includes tv and video games in our home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659484925">Precisely what I&#39;ve seen every week. We have a community potluck at our house every week. <br/>
There is our family, unschooling. A homeschooling family with complete restriction. A public <br/>
schooling family with TV/videogame moderation, and a public school family with complete <br/>
restrictions. We are all fairly attached parents, very involved in our kids lives, but there is a <br/>
direct correlation (I know, incomplete data, with only four families) to how much TV and <br/>
videogames the kids utilize while in our unrestricted house. The kids with complete <br/>
restrictions, spend their entire time on our handheld game systems in front of the TV, they <br/>
will not eat, talk to anyone, nothing, because they have to get their fill while at our house. <br/>
The parents still maintain the bizarre hope that as the boys get older, they will not &#39;discover a <br/>
need for electronics&#39;. Um, they already HAVE a need that they are trying to fill now, and the <br/>
parents have just created an environment that intensifies that need. <br/>

the resources that can help them? You already watch DVDs, what about <br/>
a subscription to a rental service like netflix or blockbuster? <br/>
<br/>
We live too far out in the country for free-tv, and George and I <br/>
aren&#39;t big tv fans, so for awhile we just had videos and dvd, and <br/>
then a subscription to netflix. That seemed to meet everyone&#39;s needs <br/>
and fill up our interests. When my stepson moved in we realized that <br/>
we would have to upgrade our subscription, and the cost would be <br/>
comparable to having a satelite dish. We can&#39;t afford both. So I <br/>
asked my stepson what he&#39;d prefer - satelite. No question. Okay, we <br/>
dropped the netflix and got the dish. <br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s a very social learner, so tv provides a lot of opportunities <br/>
for him to learn about the world in a way that makes sense to him. <br/>
We try to watch some tv with him every day so that he can talk with <br/>
us about what he&#39;s seeing and hearing and thinking. I had sort of <br/>
expected that. I didn&#39;t expect the tv to have quite so much of an <br/>
effect on my 5yo. She&#39;s facinated by the cartoons, and all the <br/>
different ways things can be drawn. <br/>
<br/>
Some days she draws all day long, inspired by what she&#39;s seen on tv. <br/>
She loves to draw movement and emotion and perspective, and <br/>
different cartoons depict those things in different ways. She&#39;s <br/>
working her way around the various shows - watching one for a few <br/>
weeks, then another, although she always comes back to Spongebob and <br/>
Dora. I&#39;m seeing her drawing style shift as she watches different <br/>
things. She&#39;s using the tv as a way to learn about drawing. Books <br/>
and people and nature didn&#39;t do that for her. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan had seemed perfectly content with the dvd-rentals. It didn&#39;t <br/>
seem like we were limiting her in any way, but the difference in the <br/>
past few months has been really startling. I *thought* she liked to <br/>
draw before. Now it occupies an enormous place in her life. Maybe it <br/>
was just &quot;time&quot;. Maybe I was with-holding a valuble resource bc I <br/>
couldn&#39;t see the value in it *to her*. Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sooo... would you go out and get a TV in order that the children <br/>

convenient and you could afford it? A museum pass? A season ticket <br/>
to a community theater? A pool pass? A gym membership? Would you buy <br/>
a whole bunch of art-supplies if you came across some for a <br/>
reasonable price? Would you buy an entire encylopedia set at a yard-<br/>
sale or auction just to have? Have you ever subscribed to a magazine <br/>
or book-cub for your kids without being sure they would like it? <br/>
Would you drive to visit a relative or old friend you kids didn&#39;t <br/>
know well?<br/>

You get the idea.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My daughter Kat, 12, has been following the TV discussion and  <br/>
&gt; wanted people to know she has been writing since she was 7 or 8 and  <br/>
&gt; feels that without TV she wouldn&#39;t have the inspiration she does.  <br/>
&gt; She counted up the pages in her comics and other writings and they  <br/>
&gt; come to 879. (She says there are many more pages of writing and  <br/>
&gt; comics that she hasn&#39;t put into binders and those would probably  <br/>
&gt; bring it up over 1000 pages.) She says she&#39;s been inspired by  <br/>
&gt; Pokemon (the most), Gundam Wing, Monster Rancher, and Digimon. Her  <br/>
&gt; alter ego, Avn the cat, who has been with her since she was 3 or 4  <br/>
&gt; was inspired by Disney&#39;s Peter and the Wolf.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the past three years she&#39;s filled 3 more 2&quot; binders of comics  <br/>
inspired by Pokemon (though the story lines have little to do with it  <br/>
now). Her alter ego has starred in two 50,000 word novels (written  <br/>
for National Novel Writing Month). (A 3rd 50,000 word novel centered  <br/>
around a different character but had its genesis in all the fantasy  <br/>
she&#39;s seen and read.)<br/>
<br/>
Anime -- most from TV -- (and manga) has inspired a huge development  <br/>
in her drawing and she&#39;s on her 5th sketchbook in a little over a year.<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon inspired her to work with Sculpey, and she&#39;s created a huge  <br/>
number of them (as well as other creatures from her imagination). (It  <br/>
seems not uncommon that working in 3D helps kids translate what they  <br/>
see to 2D.)<br/>
<br/>
Her love of that type of monster has inspired her to create thousands  <br/>
-- I think she&#39;s up to her 3rd *4&quot;* binder -- of creatures. Her love  <br/>
of drawing creatures led her to giving a Creature Creation class for  <br/>
homeschoolers for a couple of years, starting when she was 12.<br/>
<br/>
Most of her friends share her interest in anime, most also began with  <br/>
Pokemon on TV.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s a great deal of evidence that TV sucks the creativity and  <br/>
social skills out of kids. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203779692">~~  Would you let your 5 y.o.<br/>
watch &quot;Jaws&quot;?!?!?~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would. I don&#39;t &quot;let&quot; or &quot;not let&quot; my kids watch shows. I trust<br/>
their signals and comfort level far above my own. Heck, Jaws is really<br/>
pretty tame compared to most movies that are being made now. We find<br/>
it rather amusing for the most part.:)<br/>
<br/>
Jalen wanted to watch Predator Vs. Alien when he was a mere three<br/>
years old. I was concerned. I explained how scary it would be, that<br/>
there were monsters etc...and he insisted that he wanted to watch it.<br/>
So I sat with him and we watched it together. I offered to cover his<br/>
eyes, or fast forward and encouraged him to let me know if it bothered<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
He enjoyed every minute of it until he fell asleep! Didn&#39;t bother him<br/>
in the least. His older sister never liked movies of that genre and<br/>
would let us know right away that she was scared or didn&#39;t like<br/>
something. <br/>
<br/>
We pay attention to their comfort level, we watch with them, we can<br/>
fast forward over parts that might bother them if they agree to that,<br/>
we can mute (often the sound is the scary part) and use all sorts of<br/>
tools to help them access the things they&#39;re interested in.<br/>
<br/>
If they happen to watch something that disturbs them, they have two<br/>
parents that are going to comfort, empathize and help them the next<br/>
time all over again. They don&#39;t get &quot;I told you so&quot; or limits in<br/>
response to the experience. <br/>
<br/>
In my experience, kids that have a lot of trust given to them, learn<br/>
their own limits quite well and are comfortable letting you know when<br/>
they want to expand upon their comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
All of my children have been comfortable with different things at<br/>
different ages. I&#39;m glad they know themselves and know that we support<br/>
them wherever they&#39;re at.<br/>
<br/>
I DO warn them about content and other parts that might bother them.<br/>
They do the same for me.:)  <br/>
<br/>
I make a living by working as a makeup artist so because of that<br/>
passion we&#39;ve delved into artistry and film effects often. We talk<br/>
about how certain effects are acheived, how the makeup artists use<br/>
latex...making molds and casts of various ingredients, what is used to<br/>
create blood effects etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Film making is a fascinating art form (well, many art forms really)<br/>
and to learn about that makes the scary parts (or other intense parts)<br/>
a lot more understandable and interesting. I choose to empower my<br/>
children rather than limit them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046120258">I&#39;m not sure what some of this means, like &quot;indiscrepancy&quot; or <br/>
that &quot;young children are all sense organ&quot;, but I do not assume that <br/>
all children will react to media in the same way.  What disturbs <br/>
people, yes even young children, varies greatly.  Some <br/>
movies/songs/books/ that are made specifically for children can be <br/>
very scary to some.  And some things that scare certain adults may <br/>
not scare some children.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when we first got the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; on DVD, and dh <br/>
and I watched it.  Darcy was 5, I think, and she asked about it.  I <br/>
said that she might find it scary, and she said that she didn&#39;t want <br/>
to watch it.  But a few days later, she asked if she could.  So dh <br/>
and I sat down to watch it with her.  She thought some of it was <br/>
cool, and then she lost interest and went off to play - no further <br/>
interest in it ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Also at the age of 5, she picked up a book of folk stories that we <br/>
had and proceeded to read several of the stories.  I didn&#39;t think <br/>
much of it until she was scared to sleep by herself that night when <br/>
she usually did go to sleep alone.  She was scared to go to sleep <br/>
without me for months after that.  I never would have thought to <br/>
protect her from my book of folk tales that I guess had a few ghost <br/>
stories in it.  <br/>
<br/>
I have never liked clowns or puppets - they kind of freak me out.  <br/>
And what scared me the most and for the longest time were natural <br/>
disasters like tornadoes and earthquakes.  Even if I wanted the <br/>
world to be good, there&#39;s no way that my parents could protect me <br/>
from the knowledge that tornadoes and earthquakes occur, at least <br/>
not for long.  I had terrible dreams about them for years.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;m not saying to sit your child down in front of a horror <br/>
movie in order to see if it scares them or not.  But if they express <br/>
an interest in watching something and you talk about it with them, <br/>
offer to skip anything they want to skip or just turn it off if they <br/>
want, I don&#39;t think it will be a problem.  If they have the power to <br/>
turn it off or the opportunity to talk about it, it won&#39;t have any <br/>
power over them.  Every child is probably scared of something, and <br/>
they may not know they are scared of something until they see it, <br/>
but I think it&#39;s just as likely to be tornadoes or clowns or bugs or <br/>
dogs as it is to be something from a movie.<br/>
