<div id="ygrps-yiv-258952513">To quote Jan Hunt(&#39;cause I can&#39;t write):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children deserve our best efforts to give them love and understanding at <br/>
all times, even when - especially when - they are not behaving as we would <br/>
wish. If we can show them compassion and understanding at those times, we <br/>
can teach them by example some of the most essential ingredients of a happy <br/>
life: the capacity to love others unconditionally, the willingness to offer <br/>
help and express empathy at all times, and not just at those times when <br/>
others are making life easy for us. If we can teach this to our children, we <br/>
have given our child a priceless gift, one that will continue through the <br/>
generations. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of the most important principles of parenting is that the feelings <br/>
behind a child&#39;s behavior must be recognized, accepted, understood, and <br/>
openly dealt with, before the behavior can change. Until that happens, the <br/>
unwanted behavior - or behavior even less welcome to the parent - will only <br/>
continue. How could it be otherwise? It is the same with adults, after all. <br/>
If we &quot;misbehave&quot; toward our partner, but he or she makes no effort to <br/>
understand and accept the feelings which brought about that behavior, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t hear the message we are trying to send, we will continue to try to <br/>
express those feelings in the same, or even less effective and less welcome <br/>
ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Feelings are not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;; they are normal, valid, and important. I <br/>
love you enough to stop and really pay attention to what it is you&#39;re trying <br/>
to tell me, in the only way you can tell me in this moment, at this age, and <br/>
in these circumstances. I do not like being bitten any more than you would <br/>
like it. At the same time, I understand that you would not have done this <br/>
unless you were feeling angry/ sad/ upset/ worried/ disturbed about <br/>
something. I take your needs and feelings seriously, and I&#39;ll help you to <br/>
find better ways to express your feelings so that everyone&#39;s needs are <br/>
met.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of our Natural Child Project Parenting CardsÂ© sums it up this way: <br/>
&quot;Look past the behavior... what is your child feeling?&quot; When we focus on a <br/>
child&#39;s needs and feelings, rather than the specific behavior we wish to <br/>
change, we can then truly communicate our love for our child. That the <br/>
behavior will then improve is almost a side issue. As Mozart wrote, &quot;Love, <br/>
love, love, that is the soul of genius.&quot; It is also the soul of parenting.&quot;<br/>
