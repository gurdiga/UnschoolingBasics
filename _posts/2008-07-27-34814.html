<div id="ygrps-yiv-415540909">Thank you so much Kelly! You have no idea what this set in motion! We have this old swimming pool we want to convert into something else, and so far we thought about a greenhouse/studio combination. But it turns out that a stage would be such a great thing. The kids would love doing theater shows and forming their own group, I have been wanting to do a dance group etc. So now we are actively thinking on how to make the old swimming pool into a performance space, surrounded by flowers and doubling as a hang-out with firepit... Thank you, thank you!<br/>
