<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663516950">I have been lurking here for quite awhile and am so tempted to <br/>
unschool, but several things are holding me back.   <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I can&#39;t come to terms with is the TV and music <br/>
issue.  I grew up in a trailer and after school I would come home <br/>
and be forced to listen to Very Loud music from each end of the <br/>
trailer due to my brothers.  I think the trailer was actually <br/>
shaking to the loud bass of Black Sabbath and such.  I just wanted <br/>
to play my choir music on the piano (my mom wasn&#39;t at home after <br/>
school).  I felt like I was always subjected to loud music.  Also, <br/>
my mom would come home from work around dinner and would then watch <br/>
her TV shows all evening long and I got so tired of having her TV on <br/>
(secretly, I was bored and wished she would do something with me).  <br/>
I would retreat to my bedroom to just get away from it.  I do enjoy <br/>
watching TV with them at times, but sometimes I want to hear quiet~  <br/>
I am afraid my kids would always want to watch TV if I didn&#39;t place <br/>
any restrictions on it.  And I would rather not get them TVs in <br/>
their bedrooms.  Are there unschoolers here who don&#39;t place <br/>
restrictions on TV, but tell their kids &quot;I am tired of having that <br/>
TV on and listening to it, can we turn it off now?&quot;.  The living <br/>
room is right off of the kitchen so I have to listen while I am <br/>
cooking.  They always watch cartoons and I am really tired of them.  <br/>
My boys are 10 and 12.    As far as the music, I know they can <br/>
listen to their own IPods and such, but I haven&#39;t encouraged that <br/>
either.  We have hearing issues in our family.  My grandma has <br/>
terrible hearing and I suffer from some hearing loss as well.  <br/>
Listening to music with something jammed in your ear is not a good <br/>
idea.  I have looked into it.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250287753">I think there is a big difference between an Unschooling household where TV<br/>
is just one of many interesting things to do and a home where the children<br/>
are left alone after school to fend for themselves.  Have you always<br/>
unschooled?  Do your kids feel they need TV as an escape from something<br/>
stressful?  Are they still deschooling after being brought out of school<br/>
recently?  Do you bring neat things into your home to introduce to your<br/>
kids?  Do you play games with your kids and read to them?  Are you providing<br/>
a rich environment for them based on their interests?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I too can&#39;t stand to be around the constant noise of the TV.  We have two<br/>
TVs.  One is in the basement family room and the other is on the main floor<br/>
in the living room where the noise carries all through the house.  There is<br/>
always one place to escape from the noise of the TV.  But my kids still like<br/>
me to watch with them (almost 10 and 11.75) and they often will wait for me<br/>
to be free to sit and watch TV with them and do something else until I am<br/>
ready.  The TV noise isn&#39;t a distraction for me if I am sitting there<br/>
watching it.  It&#39;s when I am not watching it that it bothers me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there another room in the house where you could put the TV that would put<br/>
a door between you and the TV?  Could they turn the volume really low and<br/>
put the closed captioning on so they won&#39;t miss something?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to let the kids know that I felt I needed some quiet<br/>
time if the TV had been on loudly for a LONG period of time.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
force the issue, but I have always been respectful of my children when they<br/>
need something and so I am confident they would be respectful of my needs<br/>
too.  They might ask if I minded if they finished a show or turned it down<br/>
but they would try to meet my needs too.  <br/>

Yes. Of course! But I don&#39;t &quot;tell&quot;, I ask them. It&#39;s just like when <br/>
we&#39;re in the car and I&#39;m BLASTING Metallica (or Sabbath...lol).....they <br/>
sometimes ask &quot;Mom, can you lower that?&quot; or &quot;Mom, can we listen to <br/>
something else?&quot; It&#39;s all about respect....on every side. As far as <br/>
TV....I&#39;m bothered by the commercials so I ask that they (including my <br/>
husband) mute them and that helps me a lot.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663206510">I think part of the situation is that you have lots of <br/>
previous &quot;baggage&quot; (though that word does get so overused). Words <br/>
like &quot;come to terms&quot;, &quot;subjected to&quot;, &quot;retreat&quot; pop right out in <br/>
that regard.<br/>
<br/>
Do you actually sit and watch them watch? Do you get familiar with <br/>
the characters and such? Do you *choose* to spend time with them <br/>
doing things they enjoy (which might be TV) rather than <br/>
feeling &quot;subjected to&quot; things you have to &quot;come to terms&quot; with? <br/>
Would it be an issue for you if you hadn&#39;t &quot;been subjected&quot; to loud <br/>
music and disengaged parenting?<br/>
<br/>
Part of &quot;coming to terms&quot; with it is dealing with the fact that this <br/>
is your issue, not theirs - they don&#39;t have that background of <br/>
having a mom who prefers TV to them, they don&#39;t have a background of <br/>
competing stereos, etc. To them, TV is just something fun (and <br/>
something to use to decompress from daily stresses if they&#39;re still <br/>
in school or deschooling). And part of it is getting everyone <br/>
together and discussing it and brainstorming ways that mom can get <br/>
some quiet occasionally AND they can watch their favorite programs. <br/>
For instance, can you record/TiVO their favorite shows so they can <br/>
turn the TV off sometimes and watch the show later? Is there a place <br/>
where you can go and close the door for 20 minutes of quiet? (at 10 <br/>
and 12, they can surely be by themselves for 20 minutes). Can they <br/>
use closed captioning sometimes? We do that often because of the <br/>
trucks going by the house - instead of turning the TV louder, we <br/>
turn on closed captioning. It makes us all a bit nuts to go to MIL&#39;s <br/>
house where they have the TV blasting loud most all the time (of <br/>
course, MIL&#39;s eyesight is about as bad as her hearing so either way <br/>
she misses stuff). <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about turning the house into a free-for-all. It <br/>
is all about respect and trust - for everyone in the household, not <br/>
just kids, not just adults. By extending that respect, you build a <br/>
bank account of respect so that when you request something that you <br/>
need, it is there to draw on (poor analogy there really in many <br/>
ways). My 8 yr old, never regulated re: TV, DS sometimes wants to <br/>
spend time with me on days I&#39;m home from work when I&#39;m not feeling <br/>
well. I&#39;m usually sleeping most of the time if I&#39;m home on a sick <br/>
day. He turns on the TV in my room BUT first he asks if it&#39;s okay <br/>
with me. If I say Okay (which I usually do, I can generally sleep <br/>
through anything, especially if I&#39;ve taken some head cold <br/>
medication). He then turns it way down low and puts on captioning so <br/>
he can watch and be with me and still not bother me. It&#39;s just <br/>
mutual respect, person for person. How would you approach another <br/>
adult about the situation? You likely wouldn&#39;t yell at them that <br/>
they HAD TO turn it down ...or else.... Nor would you (I hope) <br/>
suffer martyr-like in silence and then snipe and put down their TV <br/>
watching. Maybe take it totally out of the realm of TV and pick <br/>
something else - cooking fish for instance. If you really hated the <br/>
smell of fish cooking but your SO really enjoyed baked halibut, what <br/>
would you do? You&#39;d probably work out some compromise - your SO <br/>
bakes halibut only when you&#39;re out visiting friends or you invest in <br/>
a really good air freshener/cleaner for those occasions or your SO <br/>
chooses to only get baked halibut out at a restaurant so you don&#39;t <br/>
have to live with the cooking smells or something  - you&#39;d <br/>
brainstorm ideas. Do the same with the kids over TV.<br/>
