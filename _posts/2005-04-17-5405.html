Learn Unschooling Conference.<br/>
<br/>
I LIVE THEREFORE I LEARN: Living an Unschooling Life<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is both easy and difficult to describe. The easy answer is<br/>
that unschooling means &quot;not schooling,&quot; but it is a lot harder to<br/>
explain what we do instead of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means not depending on the usual school methods. It means<br/>
no lesson plans, no curriculum, no assignments, no quizzes or tests, no<br/>
required memorizing, and no grades. It means that the parent does not<br/>
become the child&#39;s schoolteacher—it means not creating a miniature<br/>
classroom in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, unschoolers focus on living a rich and stimulating life<br/>
together. Seriously, that&#39;s it. We do not &quot;school,&quot; but, instead, we<br/>
concentrate on living a life filled with opportunities and<br/>
possibilities and experiences. Human children are born learners.<br/>
Literally. What unschoolers aim for is keeping that love of learning<br/>
and intense curiosity alive as the children grow up.<br/>
<br/>
How do we do this? In practice, it is going to look very different for<br/>
each unschooling family. &quot;We follow our interests,&quot; is the unschoolers’<br/>
anthem. And, each family&#39;s interests will lead to all kinds of<br/>
learning—history, math, writing, music, reading, science, and all the<br/>
other real-life subject matter that is valuable and interesting. But we<br/>
won&#39;t think of them as “subjects.” We&#39;ll just think of them as<br/>
interesting and fun and fascinating and something we want to pursue<br/>
further or not. One thing will lead to another and life goes on and<br/>
kids learn and parents learn and life is full of opportunity everywhere<br/>
we look.<br/>
<br/>
It is natural for people to learn—each in their own way. It is natural<br/>
for children to want to understand the world around them. They also<br/>
want to join the adult world and become competent and capable adults<br/>
themselves. They&#39;ll strive for this in their own natural ways.<br/>
Unschooling parents work on creating a home environment that supports<br/>
their children&#39;s natural desire to learn and grow.<br/>
<br/>
Each child is unique and experiences the world in a different way than<br/>
any other person and expresses themselves in ways that are different<br/>
from every other person. There is no curriculum in the world that is<br/>
designed specifically and dynamically for any particular child, but an<br/>
unschooling lifestyle can, in effect, provide a 100 percent<br/>
individualized learning experience. Unschoolers aren&#39;t likely to learn<br/>
exactly what the professional educators and textbook publishers think<br/>
they should—so, in that sense, they will have gaps in their learning.<br/>
But they&#39;ll learn so much more, too, that is not included in those<br/>
lists of &quot;learning standards.&quot; What is important for one person to<br/>
learn is not necessarily important for another and we don&#39;t really have<br/>
any way of predicting what will be important to know in the future. We<br/>
DO know that learning that is forced or pressured is not lasting and<br/>
that most of what kids are &quot;taught&quot; is not truly &quot;learned&quot; in any kind<br/>
of lasting way unless it is something in which they are interested.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers also have in mind a lifelong timeline for learning. We<br/>
don&#39;t worry about whether a child is &quot;at grade level&quot; because we know<br/>
that children are learning &quot;something&quot; all the time and that they will<br/>
eventually learn whatever they need to know for whatever reasons they<br/>
have. We don&#39;t worry that they&#39;ll miss something important because, if<br/>
it is important, they&#39;ll realize that and find a way to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
A true unschooling slogan is, &quot;Life is learning, learning is life.&quot;<br/>
Unschoolers simply do not think there are times for learning and times<br/>
for not learning. They don&#39;t divide life into school time or lesson<br/>
time versus play time or recreation time. There is no such thing as<br/>
&quot;extracurricular&quot; to an unschooler—all of life, every minute of every<br/>
day, counts as learning time and there is no separate time set aside<br/>
for education.<br/>
<br/>
Is unschooling right for everyone? My answer is, &quot;It depends.&quot; I think<br/>
ALL children can learn and grow and thrive as unschoolers. But, I also<br/>
think it takes an intensity and focus on living life with a great deal<br/>
of gusto on the part of unschooling parents. Unschooling parents work<br/>
hard. For example, they must develop a very high level of sensitivity<br/>
to their children to know what to offer, when to support, when to back<br/>
off, how busy they want to be, how much solitude they need, when to<br/>
nudge them a bit with encouragement, when to get more involved, and so<br/>
on. AND parents need to be able to always have their kids and their<br/>
interests in the back of their minds, thinking always about what would<br/>
interest them; bringing the world to them and bringing them to the<br/>
world in ways that &quot;click&quot; for that particular child. And it takes a<br/>
great deal of trust that the child will learn without external<br/>
pressure.<br/>
<br/>
We could do the curriculum—I could put together a few hours per day of<br/>
&quot;school work,&quot; insisting that my children do it. But I&#39;ve read<br/>
everything I could get my hands on about learning and I&#39;ve had 30 years<br/>
of teaching experience and I know, deep down inside, that any coercion<br/>
in learning creates either open resistance, passivity, or apathy, and I<br/>
don&#39;t want to create any of those in my children. Learning feels<br/>
good—it might be hard, but it is also pleasurable. Coercion feels bad<br/>
and trying to learn under coercion is not pleasurable, even when we<br/>
make the best of it. Children who have only experienced the pleasure of<br/>
unforced learning show the effect in their incredible creativity,<br/>
confidence, intensity, focus, persistence, self-knowledge, and strong<br/>
sense of personal responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Not all parents WANT their children to grow up strong-willed and truly<br/>
independent-minded. And, it is fair warning to say: &quot;Be careful what<br/>
you wish for.&quot; If what we mostly want is for our children to respect us<br/>
and to adopt our beliefs and goals, unschooling may not be for us. Many<br/>
parents have a general definition of &quot;success&quot; in their own heads, and<br/>
what they want is for their children to achieve their version of<br/>
success. Many want their children to offer living proof that they were<br/>
good parents—they may even be especially interested in outcomes that<br/>
will impress friends, relatives, and acquaintances. Again, unschooling<br/>
is probably not a good fit under those circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do have goals, though, that impact our day-to-day<br/>
interactions with our kids. We want our children to discover<br/>
theirlife&#39;s passions and to jump into them with both feet, with<br/>
confidence and trust in life and themselves. We want our children to<br/>
know, deep inside themselves, that they are strong and capable and can<br/>
make their own individual choices. We want them to be willing to buck<br/>
the mainstream culture AND buck the counterculture and think for<br/>
themselves and do what they think is right and good and worthy and<br/>
valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I think, most of all, we want them to love being alive—now and in their<br/>
future.<br/>
