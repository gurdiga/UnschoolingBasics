<div id="ygrps-yiv-249747487">&quot;MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid, it is not a chemical mixed up in a<br/>
lab somewhere. It is found naturally in many of the foods we eat, like hard<br/>
cheeses. Yes, it enhances the flavor of food and that is why it is used.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely allergic to MSG.  I&#39;ve been hospitalized twice because of<br/>
reactions, the first time I nearly died; the second time wasn&#39;t as bad.  I<br/>
know it&#39;s a naturally occurring amino acid, but it does get added to foods<br/>
that can cause reactions.  Now I am extra careful.  (The first time was from<br/>
Thai food.  The 2nd time and subsequent times have been from hard cheeses.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114334720">I would say that you obviously have an alergy. My point was more that people make MSG out to be this big bad chemical that does all these terrible things to our bodies, not realizing what it is and where it comes from. I have friends that won&#39;t eat anything with MSG but when pressed for information they can&#39;t even tell you what exactly it is, only that it&#39;s bad. Alergies are a different story. I have a friend that is alergic to pork. That doesn&#39;t mean pork is bad for everyone. I wasn&#39;t really speaking of alergies at all.<br/>
