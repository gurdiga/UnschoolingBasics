<div id="ygrps-yiv-621338869">What are you supposed to do with test results? That would be my big  <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
Some states don&#39;t do anything with them, they don&#39;t even want to see  <br/>
them, you&#39;re just required to test.<br/>
<br/>
Other states will want to see that the child tests in the top 50% of  <br/>
age related children. If they don&#39;t, then what? Can you test again?<br/>
<br/>
I would honestly look more into that before I worry.<br/>

On paper, hold her back and then skip a year - its the common trick in my neck of the woods. <br/>
