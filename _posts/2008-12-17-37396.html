<div id="ygrps-yiv-523236974">Look for starbloxx - that&#39;s DS. I think DH is ocredbrd (as usual, his<br/>
nickname in college was Red Beard because of his distinctive reddish<br/>
beard duh that&#39;s probably obvious lol) I don&#39;t know how it all works to<br/>
go about finding people on Roblox and sending friend requests or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
DS is getting an upgrade to Builder&#39;s Club for Christmas ... must<br/>
convince him somehow not to take his laptop up to bed with him that<br/>
night. Getting him to go up to bed instead of staying downstairs all<br/>
night is easy - I&#39;m setting up his presents as a treasure hunt and he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to see where I hide things. BUT if he heads upstairs, he<br/>
often takes his laptop along and plays up there all night (wireless<br/>
networks are excellent!) Gotta convince him to just leave his laptop<br/>
downstairs somehow so we can upgrade him without him knowing until the<br/>
next morning...I&#39;m going to wrap a little Lego person with a note to go<br/>
check Roblox. That&#39;ll be the last thing on the treasure hunt because<br/>
once he gets to that, nothing else will happen lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919872963">I can send them a friend request. I have played a lot of Roblox! <br/>
Oh and just log in on another computer ( even if he is on in his laptop- its OK I do it all the time to read messages or send friend requests when he is in a game)<br/>
and upgrade from there. The only thing you cannot do is try to  go in a game while he is in a game- that will kick his cahracther off  but to just go in to upgrade to builders club is fine!He wll never know you were log in on another computer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116067894">THANKS! - we can log in on DH&#39;s laptop. Would he have to log out and<br/>
back in to see the upgrade or would it pop up all of a sudden while he&#39;s<br/>
playing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44564986">It would show up on My ROblox page as a badge that says Builders Club that is all!<br/>
So he would have to notice the badge and not outside ads. The inside Roblox ads would still be there but no outside ones.<br/>
So not something really flashy.<br/>
If you want him to notice just tell him to look at his badges.<br/>
