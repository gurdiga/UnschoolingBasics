<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552046541">As I&#39;ve read this thread, it seems to me that the commonality underlying<br/>
financial peace is making the family bank account(s) &quot;ours&quot;, rather than<br/>
&quot;yours&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;.  I concur: throughout my 21+ years of marriage with my<br/>
sweetie, I can&#39;t imagine doing it any other way.  Though our situation has<br/>
changed over time (from neither of us working, to only me working, and now,<br/>
only him), our bank account has always been OURS, regardless of who<br/>
contributes what.  And I, too, handle the books, not only because I can do<br/>
it the fastest, but because I like the control (and my hubby doesn&#39;t mind me<br/>
having it).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The concept of a division of labor within a family seems to have been<br/>
neglected over the past decade or two.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m overstating it to<br/>
say that a successful division of labor (whenever possible) is the keystone<br/>
of a successful marriage.  I mean, it just makes sense not to duplicate<br/>
labors.  The nonsense that domestic tasks are somehow demeaning or<br/>
unfulfilling really undermines the most important part of our life (that is,<br/>
home-life), and, if you think about it, is neither here nor there anyway,<br/>
since domestic chores must be done by SOMEBODY.  Not honoring them doesn&#39;t<br/>
make them go away (I&#39;ve tried!), and only serves to foster resentment.  Now,<br/>
when I&#39;m vacuuming dog hair for the 80-jillionth time, I think of it as my<br/>
contribution to my family.  If I don&#39;t vacuum it, someone will have to,<br/>
right?  Why would I want to give more work to my husband or son?  They&#39;re<br/>
already doing their own jobs.  It also helps to think of the blessings<br/>
involved, and there are many: I have a house to vacuum; I have a vacuum<br/>
cleaner to help with the task; I have a home large enough to have pets; I&#39;m<br/>
lucky enough to have a family to take care of; etc.<br/>

We&#39;re kind of on the flip side of this - I am the sole income and hubby has<br/>
been at home fulltime with DS for the last 12 years (DS is 14). In the last<br/>
couple of years, there are more and more at home dads but for a long time it<br/>
was a conversation killer of sorts when meeting people &quot;What do you do?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m a fulltime stay at home dad&quot; &quot;Oh&quot; Aside from Mr. Mom comments (which<br/>
make me crazy - they assume men are incompetent at caring for their own<br/>
children), people didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it. It&#39;s totally by<br/>
choice - when DS was born, we consciously decided to have one parent home<br/>
with him (barring unusual/unforeseen circumstances beyond our direct<br/>
control). What that has turned out to mean is that my job<br/>
prospects/pay/benefits have me at work fulltime and hubby at home. He loves<br/>
it. He gets to write, create, cook, explore, play videogames (he&#39;s been a<br/>
gamer since the first home systems came out back in the day). I come home to<br/>
a hot meal and a cozy home. I make sure he knows I appreciate his work, as<br/>
he lets me know he appreciates me getting out of bed in the dark and cold<br/>
and heading off to work.<br/>
<br/>
I handle the bookkeeping stuff by mutual agreement (our first couple years<br/>
of marriage, we traded off each year but after a couple of years, he didn&#39;t<br/>
want it back lol). In most cases, I just pay things as they come due but<br/>
when we get additional discretionary funds (holiday bonus for example), we<br/>
discuss how to allocate things. We often joke that he&#39;s the Captain and I&#39;m<br/>
his Executive Officer. Part of my job, as I see it, is to facilitate the<br/>
things our family wants to do - checking the funds and looking for ways to<br/>
make stuff we want happen, happen, and letting DH and DS know the options -<br/>
we can do X now, but that will impact Y that we were thinking about for next<br/>
month. We can postpone X, postpone Y, or consider Z.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Clarity of expectations is more important than &quot;division of labor&quot; per se. It makes sense to know who&#39;s going to be cooking dinner before everyone&#39;s hungry ;) And it may make sense for one person to do certain tasks based on ability or interest - for instance, for awhile I did all the stacking of firewood and hauling of trash because George wasn&#39;t able to do so. And nowadays I do all the sweeping and mopping because he&#39;s kind of oblivious to the degree of cleanliness at floor level and I like to walk around in bare feet. But things like dishes and laundry and weed-eating we both do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78446643">Nope. Not all of us. I get a monthly &quot;allowance.&quot; No, it&#39;s not what most of my friends do, but it works best for *us*. We handle money completely differently: Ben accounts for every penny. I *never* reconcile my account. The way I do it makes him very, very uncomfortable. This works for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it may take a while for each family to find what makes everyone comfortable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe. But as long as there non of the sides is keeping tabs in who is doing more or who is doing less because that would lead to resentment.<br/>
My husband is the breadwinner . He is a dairy farmer. He works 365 days a week from 4 :30 in the morning until 8-9 PM and sometimes had to get up at night to check on pregnant cows or deliver babies, or sick animals.<br/>
I do everything else, kids, home, yard. He helps me  by  cutting wood with the chain saw. I stack, load, unload and split  the easy ones. We help each other. We do not keep tabs. I do what I can to help him and he does the same to me.Since he works very very hard everyday and I get to sleep in ( he never does only when he went to the hospital) I am super nice to him. I also manage our finances, pay the bills and even sign his checks. He  just deposits the check in his account and I do the rest ( he does not even know how to log in online to his account!) <br/>
 I think it is because we are friends and trust each other. We discuss any big expense. Which for us is  like 100 dollars up for anything other than groceries!<br/>
We did have an agreement that if we had kids I would stay home with them. I did work until my son was almost two and took him to work until he was 13 months than my mom watched him but that was hard so I quit.<br/>
