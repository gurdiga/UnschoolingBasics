<div id="ygrps-yiv-810741153">My main goal at dinner time is to feed them nutritious food.  Unfortunately,<br/>
the best food takes time to prepare and I don&#39;t want to just give them a<br/>
&quot;quick fix&quot; and then have them not be hungry and not get the nutritious<br/>
food.  I understand this fear may not be well founded, but it is my concern.<br/>
I did read about an experiment done with a bunch of three-year-olds.  They<br/>
were allowed to choose whatever foods they wanted from a pretty broad buffet<br/>
and they found that the children who had not yet been indoctrinated ate the<br/>
things that their bodies needed.  One example they gave was a child with<br/>
rickets who took CLO all on his own until he was cured.  I *know* that this<br/>
can work, I just need time and a little bit of personal success to *believe*<br/>
it.  Until I truly believe it, my fears will rear their ugly heads and tell<br/>
me it won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I think I saw some mention of it somewhere.  I bemoaned the fact that I<br/>
didn&#39;t know about it last year when it was in Fitchburg, MA, which is less<br/>
than an hour from me.<br/>

<br/>
The &quot;best&quot; food can be raw food that takes seconds to wash and maybe <br/>
slice up into bite-sized portions or things that are already ready or <br/>
quick to prepare.<br/>
<br/>
Give them a &quot;quick fix&quot; of:<br/>
<br/>
string cheese, whole wheat crackers, apple slices, carrots and dip <br/>
(healthy dip), raisins, peeled tangerine sections, a bowl of healthy <br/>
canned soup, cottage cheese and pineapple, celery and peanut butter, <br/>
pear slices with some cinnamon sprinkled on top, a piece of chicken <br/>
leftover from dinner, a bowl of cereal with chopped fruit, a handful of <br/>
nuts, a bowl of frozen grapes, a bowl of frozen peas heated up in the <br/>
microwave, sliced avocado and crackers, a cup of hot chicken broth with <br/>
an egg dropped into it and stirred around, a hard-boiled egg, and on <br/>
and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re overly vested in your time-consuming dinner preparations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering - by the time you&#39;ve spent your early evening preparing <br/>
dinner, then you all eat it, then you clean up from it, then you <br/>
immediately start your bedtime routines --- when does the whole family <br/>
hang out and play games and talk and build things and watch movies and <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t take my kids shopping often (this is my &quot;me time&quot;) but when <br/>
I do I am always asked for something that I don&#39;t &quot;approve&quot; of.  But <br/>
it is my mother&#39;s voice in my head saying, &quot;That isn&#39;t good for <br/>
you.  That&#39;s fattening.  That&#39;s got lots of chemicals and <br/>
additives.  etc&quot;  (I grew up in a fairly hippie household where my <br/>
mom used to make our own granola and we went for an entire year <br/>
eating nothing but chicken for our meat at dinner.)  So I am <br/>
regularly asked for Reese&#39;s, cookies, chips, ice cream, etc.  But <br/>
what I notice is that my kids will eat those foods for a few days <br/>
and then will want, no crave, something that is more nutritious - <br/>
something that their bodies are needing.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, my kids each has a &quot;whacky&quot; snack choice.  My oldest <br/>
loves frozen peas (right out of the freezer, no thawing, no <br/>
cooking).  My middle child prefers pickles and sour cream and onion <br/>
baked chips.  And my son likes apples.  Any kind of apple.  Granny <br/>
Smiths are about his favorite!  Those are the snack foods I know I <br/>
can&#39;t come home without.  If I forget cookies, big whoop.  I can <br/>
always make cookies (which they prefer) but forget frozen peas or <br/>
apples and I am up a creek!<br/>
<br/>
You may have a while where your kids seem to only eat &quot;junky&quot; foods, <br/>
but you will also be surprised to see that they are eating much more <br/>
nutritiously than you would have thought on their own!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480290428">LOL - I agree, there are just some things that you can&#39;t go home <br/>
without. DS comes with me to do the shopping - saves me all the <br/>
bending and lifting! He&#39;s so proud of his almost-7 yr old  muscles - <br/>
they can life 5 lb sacks of sugar, flour, potatoes and can carry 2 <br/>
full gallons of milk from the car to the kitchen. I remember one <br/>
time within the last year, I slowed as we passed the snack cake <br/>
section since he had been requesting them for weeks and weeks (and <br/>
we&#39;d get them then they went on sale and I bought 5 boxes at once). <br/>
I asked if he wanted anything and he said Yes - where&#39;s the cottage <br/>
cheese? Without those tapes running in his head, he eats freely, <br/>
without any emotional connotations or baggage. One day he may eat <br/>
cookies or poptarts and the next consume an entire small melon over <br/>
the course of the day. Some days it&#39;s lots of proteins and other <br/>
times its all veggies or fruits. We talk about nutrition and he asks <br/>
what different things do - what do carbohydrates do? what does <br/>
protein do? etc. DH is hypertensive (part lifestyle part genetics) <br/>
so we look for sodium content consistently - DS has been known to <br/>
put something back if the sodium number is too high. And, given free <br/>
choice at the mini-mart, he chose a bottle of water the other night. <br/>
Since he has no neediness for sodas, or sweets, or whatever, he can <br/>
just leave them if that&#39;s not what he wants. I&#39;m waiting to see how <br/>
long the candy he gets from MIL for Easter lasts. Halloween candy <br/>
usually lingers until Christmas (if DH or I don&#39;t poach).</div>

 </span></blockquote>What we&#39;ve done at times when this seemed to be a pattern DS was <br/>
going through, was prepare the salad ahead so he could &quot;snack&quot; on <br/>
that or sliced fruit or cheese or whatever - basically make it a <br/>
multi-course meal. He could eat when he needed to, might or might <br/>
not eat dinner, but the &quot;quick fix&quot; was also good nutritious food. <br/>
Especially in summer, we keep chunks of melon handy in the fridge, <br/>
little grape tomatoes that are just kid size, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Something else, too, is that since he was an infant, he&#39;s had <br/>
something akin to a 36 hour &quot;day&quot;. He&#39;d eat a lot between waking and <br/>
noon one day, between noon and 4 or 5 the next day, and between 5ish <br/>
and 9 the third day, then a day that was lightly distributed all day <br/>
(looked like a &quot;normal&quot; day) then back to am, afternoon, pm, break. <br/>
His energy levels often follow the same pattern - some days he&#39;s up <br/>
and at it, other days he sleeps in and he&#39;s raring to go at 9 pm, <br/>
and so on. We don&#39;t have any of the imposed structures of the <br/>
schooled world so, barring appointments, his natural rhythms don&#39;t <br/>
need to be squashed into the 3 square meals and early to bed pattern.</div>

You&#39;ve gotten some good answers.  I also might say &quot;we are going to  eat <br/>
dinner in a few minutes, would you still like to eat something or do you  want to <br/>
wait for dinner?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
They are free to answer any way they like because I will honor the  choice.<br/>
 <br/>
In a more specific example, my child asks for ice cream right before  dinner. <br/>
 I said &quot;dinner is going to be ready in ten minutes, would you like  to eat <br/>
some dinner with protein first and then have your ice cream?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You are giving them information and still giving a choice.<br/>

<br/>
Judy,<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more about control than about the foods themselves. If <br/>
you go shopping alone and they don&#39;t ask for anything in particular, <br/>
then you&#39;ll probably buy a great variety of foods. If they go with <br/>
you and ask for a bag of cookies, you can say yes and *over time* as <br/>
they see then can have them whenever they want, they&#39;ll be listening <br/>
to their bodies, not trying to get all the cookies they can before <br/>
Mom stops them! <br/>
<br/>
If they like cookies and you&#39;re uncomfortable with buying bags of <br/>
highly processed ones, you can head right for the bakery section and <br/>
get them each a cookie to eat whie walking around the store! It may <br/>
satisfy their cookie craving in a way that you are okay with--or it <br/>
may not...that&#39;s the thing about strewing: the kids may or may not go <br/>
along with your ideas, but you can certainly put them out there. <br/>
<br/>
In the learning from others&#39; mistakes department, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve <br/>
been doing that is NOT going so well...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve let go of almost all food controls. Dh does the grocery shopping <br/>
and buys TONS of sugary products. He and the kids really have sweet <br/>
teeth--they love fruit and any form of sugar. I try to put lots of <br/>
fruits in front of them, but with so many choices of sugrary foods, <br/>
they do eat a lot. Then dh is frustrated at what they are eating and <br/>
starts saying &quot;no candy until you eat something healthy.&quot; So then <br/>
they feel controled and want more sugar just to win the power <br/>
struggle with him!<br/>
<br/>
I finally got him to skip all the sugary snacks this weekend (we <br/>
still have plenty in the house!), but then he went to the convenience <br/>
store twice with one or both kids and bought candy, ice cream and <br/>
Easter candy. <br/>
<br/>
Last night the kids hardly ate anything at dinner, so I mentioned to <br/>
dh that they would most likely be hungry in a couple hours. I knew <br/>
that if they said they were hungry to him at 8pm, he&#39;d think &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
dessert time&quot; and only offer desserts. I knew they hadn&#39;t had a lot <br/>
of protein, fruit or veggies, so I wanted to make sure to offer those-<br/>
-probably by making a platter of carrots, popsicle peas (yep, also a  <br/>
favorite here), an apple, cheese, etc. But I was on the phone...and <br/>
he gave them Jello only. Not a big deal once, but it&#39;s just <br/>
frustrating over time.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I hijacked!<br/>

LOL!  I was just thinking of throwing out my 10 yo&#39;s Halloween candy.  It&#39;s<br/>
hanging in a bag in the pantry.  She never eats much of it.  Her 8 yo sister<br/>
does eat most of hers eventally, but it&#39;s does take her a couple of weeks to<br/>
get through it.  Grampa and Grammy just sent the girls solid chocolate<br/>
Easter bunnies about a week ago.  The 10 yo&#39;s is still in the box and the 8<br/>
yo has been doling herself out bits and pieces here and there.  Hers is<br/>
almost gone but it has been a week. <br/>
