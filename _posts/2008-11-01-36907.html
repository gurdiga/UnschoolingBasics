<div id="ygrps-yiv-810105935">Thanks for all the replies.  I realize that strewing is much more than just lying objects around, and I am constantly pointing out interesting things (at least interesting to me:)), discussing something we are reading, trying out new foods, etc. . .I really liked the idea of mixing up books, regardless of age.  My dc share a bedroom so books do inevitably end up everywhere; however, my dh and I have many of our books upstairs in shelves above the closet just because it is more accessible. I think I am going to bring those downstairs and mix them in LR bookshelf.  <br/>
