<div id="ygrps-yiv-371733505">My two year old has recently began to have a lot of trouble with choices.<br/>
Whether to wear one coat or another, watch one video or another, he<br/>
genuinely become quite hysterical, picking one and then the other, and<br/>
adamantly insisting on one shirt, but already, while we are still putting<br/>
the shirt on, completely losing it and demanding another shirt.  He is very<br/>
familiar with his wardrobe and is not picking from what we show him, but<br/>
naming the shirts: &quot;truck shirt,&quot; or &quot;doggie shirt,&quot;.  Sometimes he insists<br/>
on wearing a shirt for several days,which is fine, but if something does<br/>
need cleaned it upsets him greatly.  It is not in an environment of rushing<br/>
out the door where this is happening.  We do not necessarily restrict him to<br/>
one or two choices, but naturally I have to intervene and pick something for<br/>
him, and he usually calms down after I have done so, but sometimes he is<br/>
hysterical for a while. With videos I have begun to hide them because he<br/>
becomes such a nervous wreck.  I can see the problem is that he wants to<br/>
watch all of the movies!  I myself have difficulties myself making small<br/>
decisions such as ordering off a menu or selecting a movie and often make my<br/>
husband choose.  With large, important issues I know my mind well.<br/>
<br/>
We want our son to have true choices and I want to guide him but without<br/>
intervention he just gets more and more distraught.  I think it is about<br/>
control.  I let him select food for himself, from a pool of available foods,<br/>
but there are times when he gets hysterical about the food I am eating, even<br/>
to the point of trying to take it out of my mouth!  For example, if he can&#39;t<br/>
decide whether he wants his sweet potato heated, but I heat mine up and<br/>
offer both choices, he can eat mommy&#39;s, which is hot, or the other, which is<br/>
cold, but he is furious at my choice.  Sometimes this becomes so<br/>
overwhelming for me that I put him in his crib for about 15 minutes and just<br/>
try to calm down.  At times it might seem that he is just being difficult<br/>
but I think he is overwhelmed by all of the options.  He&#39;ll ask me to bring<br/>
him water, but refuse it when I bring it, and then scream when I take it<br/>
away.  I worry we give him too much choice.  What is the right balance? I<br/>
know at his age there are a lot of frustrations, I want to minimize them for<br/>
him yet help him build decision-making skills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42547745">At two, there&#39;s a kind of tension between a strong desire for autonomy<br/>
and a realization that the world is WAY bigger than you are which is<br/>
scary. Then, there are some people who have to get the &quot;right&quot; choice,<br/>
even when there&#39;s no right or wrong choice (a blue tshirt or a red<br/>
tshirt, doesn&#39;t matter much in the overall scheme of things) for<br/>
whatever reason (a need to please, fear of disappointing, lots of other<br/>
possibilities). When DS was younger, he&#39;d often have choosing troubles.<br/>
Most often, we&#39;d just choose not to choose if at all possible. We also<br/>
developed sometimes elaborate schemes for &quot;random&quot; choice. For instance,<br/>
for the longest time I walked around with 3 of those frilly cocktail<br/>
toothpicks in my purse. One with blue frills, one with red, and one with<br/>
yellow. If DS was having trouble choosing something, we&#39;d try to narrow<br/>
things down as best as we could then he&#39;d assign a choice/option to each<br/>
of the toothpicks. I&#39;d hide the frilly ends in my hand and he&#39;d pick a<br/>
toothpick. Then he&#39;d consider if that option was what he wanted - he<br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;stuck&quot; with whatever he picked, but it helped him to focus his<br/>
consideration on one thing at a time. Sometimes, we&#39;d take advantage of<br/>
the fact that restaurants give kids crayons and paper kid menus - we&#39;d<br/>
put Xs through things one at a time to narrow his choices visibly. It<br/>
also helped him sometimes to hear me verbalize my choosing process -<br/>
&quot;hmm do I want chicken? No I&#39;ve had a lot of chicken lately. Pasta? Too<br/>
big. Ah ha! They have a fish that I like, I&#39;ll get that...&quot; Plus, I&#39;d<br/>
rearrange things - like skip the rice pilaf for extra steamed broccoli<br/>
(yeah I know I&#39;m mostly using restaurant examples but the process<br/>
applied to a lot of other situations). Over time it helped him to see<br/>
that most things are not as black and white as he thought. If picking<br/>
out a shirt to wear was difficult at this moment, no problem, stay in<br/>
pjs (or naked) for now, maybe wrap up in a blanket if it&#39;s chilly. I<br/>
know you&#39;re saying there&#39;s no rushing to get out the door or anything<br/>
(which is good) but there may still be a feeling of &quot;have to choose NOW&quot;<br/>
because this is when Mommy is asking. We rarely had a &quot;time to get<br/>
dressed&quot; or &quot;time to eat&quot; type thing based on the clock when DS was<br/>
younger, that only added to his stress level (even if it was a situation<br/>
of having a set appointment time for something, we&#39;d work with it so<br/>
that getting dressed could take an hour or two in little bits and pieces<br/>
if he needed it that way). In the sweet potato example you gave, what I<br/>
might have done would be to say something to the effect of &quot;well, cold<br/>
is right here now - you can try it that way. We can change it to warm if<br/>
you change your mind.&quot; Oh yeah that&#39;s a point I don&#39;t know if I made<br/>
clear - that sense of A SINGLE RIGHT CHOICE, that once the choice is<br/>
made it&#39;s immutable. Very concrete, black and white, set in stone<br/>
thinking - not uncommon in toddlers and young children. Time is a<br/>
definite factor - developmentally things will change over time.<br/>
Sometimes what it took for DS to choose the red shirt or the blue shirt<br/>
was for me to not &quot;offer&quot; either but simply to provide whatever info was<br/>
pertinent (temperature, plans for the day, etc) and then just sit<br/>
quietly or even leave the room &quot;I&#39;m going to go potty, I&#39;ll be right<br/>
back&quot; type thing to allow him space to choose without other eyes on him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a way that your husband could change that part of your  <br/>
personality to make that bit of life less frustrating for you?<br/>
<br/>
Or is his patient understanding and help what you need to handle the  <br/>
moment?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your son has your personality quirk and it&#39;s not  <br/>
meshing well with some developmental stage that comes with hitting 2.  <br/>
There&#39;s probably some bit of how the world works that he had an  <br/>
&quot;Aha!&quot; moment on. Like a &quot;Wait, when I choose this, I have to *not*  <br/>
choose that too?!? And I have to do that for every single choice?!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The intensity is because he&#39;s 2 and hasn&#39;t found ways that work for  <br/>
him to deal with it. He won&#39;t be 2 forever. But it may take time for  <br/>
him to build up strategies.<br/>
<br/>
What will help him is what helps you when you&#39;re in that state.  <br/>
Understanding, help to deal with the moment, not expecting him to be  <br/>
other than who he is. Be calm and understanding with an attitude of  <br/>
you can get through this together.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe rather than trying to give him strategies or fix the problem,  <br/>
see yourselves as a team and what you can do together to get through  <br/>
it. Though it will be mostly you coming up with ideas and doing at  <br/>
this point and for many years perhaps. He will watch and absorb what  <br/>
you do. You can&#39;t necessarily fix the problem but you can find ways  <br/>
to get through it. The most important strategy is finding ways to  <br/>
avoid putting him in the position that causes meltdowns. You won&#39;t  <br/>
prevent them all and that&#39;s not the point. You just want to cut down  <br/>
on them.<br/>
<br/>
But rather than thinking in terms of &quot;I can&#39;t give him choices or  <br/>
he&#39;ll melt down,&quot; think in terms of adjusting the world as much as  <br/>
you can for him so that it&#39;s something (for the most part) he can  <br/>
handle right now. And when he can&#39;t, understanding is probably the  <br/>
best thing for him.<br/>

<h4>Amanda Mayan</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705679171">2 things come to mind..too much choice and different kinds of choices.or<br/>
executing choice in a different way..2 is a difficult age.for them and for<br/>
us. 2 is a difficult age..they want to do things for themselves.chaos<br/>
generally results. The best is to find some coping mechanisms for the both<br/>
of you. Some examples from my life.<br/>
<br/>
Maya LOVES chosing her own clothing, from a young age (like when she could<br/>
resist letting me put something on her) I gave her choice.before, everything<br/>
was hung and I would lift her up to choose from her closet. As she was more<br/>
mobile.I put her clothing in drawers she could reach.and she would pull them<br/>
all out EACH MORNING when she got dressed.to prevent myself from becoming<br/>
like a cartoon character with my eyes exploding in rage each time I stopped<br/>
folding the clothing. She has a &quot;tops&quot; drawer and a &quot;bottoms&quot; drawer and she<br/>
goes in, tears it apart and I just shuffle stuff back if I need to.but she<br/>
doesn&#39;t even need my help to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it&#39;s just overwhelming for him.you could lay out 2 options, and<br/>
then if he asks for something specific, get it for him, but at least the<br/>
choice is narrowed from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Maya can&#39;t decide what to wear.or she wants shorts and it&#39;s 50<br/>
out.so we layer.the shorts she wants over or (my preference J) under jeans<br/>
or long pants.maybe if he can&#39;t decide between shirts he wears both?<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe a small fridge with &quot;pre-loaded&quot; sippy cups.water, juice,<br/>
whatever.so that he can get them for himself.I found an office style fridge<br/>
easily on freecycle. Also, Maya has a snack drawer that is low so that she<br/>
can get into it without my help (though sometimes she asks me to get her<br/>
something anyway.which I happily do) some of the things in her drawer are<br/>
nuts, M&Ms, rasins, pita chips, cereal, freeze dried apples ect.there is<br/>
also fruit on the counter that she can access on her own (but this does not<br/>
mean that I do not offer her things throughout the day too.it just means she<br/>
can do things for herself if she wants)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of these suggestions will help with his choice challenges. Of<br/>
course, when they have free access to clothes, snacks, ect..there will be<br/>
more mess for you to clean up.I remember Maya grabbing a box of fruit loops<br/>
(which she asked for, tasted, and never touched again) that lived in her<br/>
drawer for a while.and dumping them on the floor.while saying, I&#39;m making a<br/>
mess because I&#39;m mad at you.not my favorite moment ever, but definitely a<br/>
safe way for her to express anger and get it out (luckily that was a one<br/>
time thing).and then there is just the normal mess of a toddler.but when<br/>
cleaning after her, I just think about how much better it might be in the<br/>
long run.also, whe helps me clean and is starting to not be so &quot;chaotic&quot;<br/>
when getting things for herself!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking of my own son&#39;s struggles (he is now 11.5) as a<br/>
toddler... many of which stemmed from the same kind of overwhelm with<br/>
choices.  *I* thought I was giving him *real* choices (all the toddler<br/>
development propaganda said to!) of &quot;Red shirt or Blue shirt&quot; and &quot;Warmed or<br/>
Regular&quot; but in hindsight and honestly, this technique set is FALSE and set<br/>
us up for misery every.single.day.<br/>
<br/>
Would have been so much better to have continued on our path of trust -- his<br/>
trust in me that I know what is comfortable for him to wear and my trust in<br/>
his communication about his clothing -- and addressed REAL choices when they<br/>
really did come up (once a week &quot;chocolate or twist icecream?&quot;).  Offering<br/>
clothes, &quot;here&#39;s your blue tee-shirt! All fresh and soft; I know how much<br/>
you love it!&quot; is much better with Hayden, even NOW, than &quot;Red or Blue?&quot; (and<br/>
yes, my boy would also spend a lot of time pining for the unchosen shirt,<br/>
sure it was the better choice than the one he made...)<br/>
<br/>
With food, I&#39;ve come to realize that a genuine offer is a much easier<br/>
springboard for him than an open &quot;choose!&quot; situation.  i.e. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of making a turkey sandwich, can I make one for you, too?&quot; &quot;Mama&#39;s<br/>
having a warm sweet potato, would you like some too?&quot; From there, he either<br/>
has a ready-made idea or a place to begin to make his own.... i.e. &quot;Ooooh,<br/>
can I have a PB&J instead?&quot; or &quot;Can I have my sweet potato cold instead?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is going off on a tangent! It can be useful to know that &quot;autonomy&quot; often gets used to mean two things rolled together: autonomy itself, in the sense of independent action or decision making and another driving force known as competence. With young children, in particular, it can be hard to tell those things apart - the results of independent actions impact on one&#39;s sense of competence, after all - but it can still be helpful at times to think of them separately. It can give you more ideas, options to try. <br/>
<br/>
So if a child is having trouble with decision making, it could help to look for ways for him to feel more capable in general. Especially a 2yo, who&#39;s going to tend to be More driven by competence than autonomy per se, since he&#39;s still working on mastering his own body. By around 3ish the drive tends to shift a little more in the direction of autonomy, of wanting independent choices, at least in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Morgan liked exploring competence from a pretty early age, but she also didn&#39;t want to make a whole lot of decisions. Figuring out How to do things was her focus - how to get her shirt On was a much bigger interest for her than picking one, for instance. Or deciding How to eat a potato was a bigger focus than deciding if it should be warm or cool or sweet or white. <br/>
