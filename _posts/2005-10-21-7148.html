<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414887949">Hi folks,<br/>
I posted a few weeks ago about our sudden very large family, and <br/>
you&#39;ll understand that things have been a bit overwhelming. I wanted <br/>
to update you.<br/>
<br/>
First, it seems like we&#39;re going to be getting a bit larger. I just <br/>
discovered that I am pregnant, a total surprise. This would not have <br/>
been the time I would have planned a new baby, but somehow with <br/>
everything else, I feel remarkably calm (and happy) about it. I was <br/>
worried that the kids would be worried or upset, but they are all <br/>
very happy. Becca, who is 9, said &quot;We&#39;ve all had such a sad time. <br/>
It&#39;s good to have something wonderful to look forward to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had read your sweet responses to the older kids, who didn&#39;t say <br/>
much. The next day they ALL came to Dan and me. Emma told us that <br/>
they had all agreed that if one of us were willing to be home with <br/>
them they would like to unschool. Sophie, who is 13, a Virgo, and <br/>
VERY serious said, &quot;Look this whole thing is going to look like the <br/>
Waltons, especially with a new baby. We&#39;re going to go crazy without <br/>
some structure, and we all have to pitch in. We&#39;re a weird family, <br/>
but we ARE a family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that point I started to cry (Dan, too), and said I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
be home with them. Annie, who is 10, and another Virgo, wants to make <br/>
up charts to keep us organized. I thought that might be overdoing it. <br/>
She said, pointing to me and Dan, &quot;Your main jobs are to love us and <br/>
to keep telling stories about our parents so the little ones don&#39;t <br/>
forget them.&quot; As you would imagine, we cried for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have let my employers I will not be returning. (Dan and I have <br/>
been on a leave of absence.) Dan goes back to work November 1. And we <br/>
are settling in.<br/>

That brought me to tears!  How very very beautiful of<br/>
an opporutunity for you all.  Congratulations on the<br/>
news of being with child.  If your love in your home<br/>
is 1/2 of what shows through on this email you wrote,<br/>
it is so much more than many children receive.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us posted as to what is going on with you.<br/>

If I can stop crying long enough to write this....  I have been  thinking <br/>
about your family so much since reading your first posts and I didn&#39;t  respond <br/>
because I just couldn&#39;t find the words to convey both my sadness and my  hope <br/>
for you all.<br/>
 <br/>
You sound like just a remarkable woman and I&#39;m thrilled for you that you  are <br/>
having a child.<br/>
You are giving those children and yourself such a gift to be with them.  <br/>
Along with telling those stories you will be creating stories of your own.   I <br/>
hope you continue to let us know about your lives and your journey.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319510720">Hi, I&#39;ve been off-line for the better part of a year and just got online a few days ago.  We are in California and we decided to try signing Jaiden (7yrs ds) up in a charter school this year. He is a child who craves structure and order (always has). He has made scheduals for himselfs amd posted them all over the house :).<br/>
 <br/>
I feel a little strange unschooling and being in a charter school, but Jaiden seems to be much happier now. Thats what matters right? <br/>
 <br/>
Avery (4yrs ds) is all excited about getting signed up in the charter next year, but I worry a little more about that, he&#39;ll be 5 and I think he should just be, but his big brother in in charter school so he HAS to be in it too. Avery is also a very different personality than Jaiden he doesn&#39;t like structure at all. I guess we&#39;ll burn that bridge when we get to it :).<br/>
 <br/>
Hmmm, this is all very rambly and disconected my coffee is still trying to work it&#39;s way to my brain. I just wanted to pop in and say hi, I&#39;m glad to be back.<br/>

Congratulations on your new little one-to-be. I believe little ones are  sent <br/>
to us for reasons we may never know, and sometimes it seems like it&#39;s not  <br/>
the best time to be having a baby, or it&#39;s unexpected, but, someone sent them  <br/>
for a reason.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m so glad the children are settling in. You are so wonderful to be doing  <br/>
this, something that they will never, ever forget. And they sound like a bunch  <br/>
of great kids. Best of luck to you all... <br/>

discovered that I am pregnant, a total surprise.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lindsay, congratulations, this is amazing and wonderful news. Like many<br/>
others I was moved to weeping by the sweetness of the children&#39;s words. <br/>
<br/>
It is *fine* to support the Virgo organizational qualities that your girls<br/>
are initiating. Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean disorganized, unless that is how<br/>
everyone is happy! <br/>
<br/>
Keep well.<br/>
