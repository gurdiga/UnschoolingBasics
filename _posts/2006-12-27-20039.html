<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897560682">You might want to read &quot;Don&#39;t bother me mom - I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc<br/>
Prensky.  I received it for Christmas, but haven&#39;t read it yet.  The cover<br/>
reads &quot;How computer and video games are preparing your kids for 21st century<br/>
success - and how you can help!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although some of the suggestions are common sense to those of us who<br/>
unschool...like play the games with your kids and talk to your kids about<br/>
them, what they like about their games, etc.  (I have flipped through it a<br/>
bit...)<br/>
<br/>
The back cover reads in part, &quot;Prensky believes that kids are so attracted<br/>
to these games because they are learning about important &quot;future&quot; things,<br/>
from collaboration, to prudent risk taking, to strategy formulation and<br/>
execution, to complex moral and ethical decisions.  The author&#39;s arguments<br/>
are supported by PhDs studying both violence and games in their totality,<br/>
and by studies of gamers who have become successful corporate workers,<br/>
entrepreneurs, leaders, doctors, lawyers, scientists and other<br/>
professionals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend and her 11 year old daughter spend a couple days with us<br/>
before Christmas.  My son, also 11, and her daughter played a lot of Pokemon<br/>
games on their respective gameboys.  The kids mentioned I might be getting a<br/>
DS lite for Christmas.  She asked if I wanted one.  I said it would be nice<br/>
when we were all waiting somewhere together and my dh & 2 kids were all<br/>
playing Brain Age together, that it would be fun for me to play too.  She<br/>
seemed exasperated...&quot;you are supposed to have conversation when you are<br/>
waiting!&quot;  I didn&#39;t think til later to explain that since we homeschool, we<br/>
are together almost 24/7 and have plenty of conversation.  Unlike her<br/>
family, where she had just finished telling me about her daughter (in the<br/>
gifted program at her school, of course), who had been getting up at 3:30 &<br/>
4 a.m. (!) to get her homework finished.  Ack!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry for the rant :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484761254">Perhaps I need to look into that book... This is one sticking point<br/>
for me. As I&#39;ve mentioned in previous posts, my children (6,6,3) have<br/>
not shown any interest in video games - even the pc games we have -<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s coming, as most kids at some point get into them. I have<br/>
read alot of research showing how it is so bad for kids - the quick<br/>
pace action, the constant bombardment of lights/sounds, the hours<br/>
spent infront of the tv. Obviously, there is a whole other set of<br/>
research probably showing the opposite but until recently, I guess I<br/>
had brainwashed myself into thinking that the &quot;no electronic games&quot;<br/>
policy was best for kids. And it&#39;s a hard piece of thinking to change<br/>
when you have read the research about adhd and LD caused in large part<br/>
by too much tv and video games. However, given all the positives I<br/>
have already seen from lifting the arbitrary limits on TV time, food,<br/>
and bedtimes, how can videogames be any different?   <br/>

Good point Heather! That how I feel about &quot;family sit-down dinners&quot;. We <br/>
don&#39;t need to catch up on our day-we&#39;ve spent a good portion of it <br/>
together. We can have a family sit-down dinner if we WANT to but not <br/>
because we want to hear about each others days. <br/>
<br/>
That book sounds interesting. I may check it out of the library. <br/>

<br/>
**** That how I feel about &quot;family sit-down dinners&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago my boys saw one of the commercials for &quot;the family table.&quot;  My <br/>
6yo ds said, &quot;We don&#39;t always sit down and have a family table dinner. <br/>
Daddy is working at dinner a lot.  Does that mean we aren&#39;t close enough? <br/>
Does it mean we aren&#39;t doing something we should be doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Before I had a chance to respond, his 10yo brother said (I paraphrase, but <br/>
pretty accurately), &quot;Buddy, we are with Mommy and each other all day, every <br/>
day.  We see Daddy whenever he&#39;s home, even during the day, &#39;cause we don&#39;t <br/>
go to school.  We couldn&#39;t be much closer if we wanted to be.  We aren&#39;t <br/>
doing anything wrong.  Some families NEED the family table just to make sure <br/>
they talk to each other at least once a day.  That&#39;s not us.  If I saw you <br/>
any more than I do, I&#39;d be totally sick of you.  Some days I am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, what else could I possibly add to that?  Direct and to the point and <br/>
ending in requisite snarkiness, just so little brother doesn&#39;t think big <br/>
brother likes him TOO much.  :oD<br/>

I  still find it hard to believe that allowing kids full rein of <br/>
electronics  for months on end will actually help them learn <br/>
self-control. Is there  anyone that has seen the end result of it?<br/>
<br/>
I sold our n64 because the  boys were constantly fighting about using it.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Not sure what you mean by &quot;end result&quot;.  My boys are 10 and 13 and  have <br/>
never had controls placed on them.  I can tell you that working out  solutions to <br/>
problems that arise is a valuable tool.  At first when they  would argue about <br/>
who played first or for how long, I would mediate a little, to  first calm <br/>
the situation, then talk about what exactly each person wants.   Then we would <br/>
start throwing out solutions for the problem until we hit on one  that everyone <br/>
was happy with.  So those types of &quot;problems&quot; can be worked  out in a <br/>
mutually agreeable way.  Now they are very good at working out  agreeable solutions <br/>
without my help.  It works for 2 boys and when the boys  have friends over they <br/>
work out solutions that are agreeable to 3 or 4  boys.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure if I had removed the game system when a  problem arose that <br/>
would have helped them learn problem solving tools.  I  am not a &quot;gaming&quot; person <br/>
myself.  But dh is, and the game systems are a way  for him to reconnect with <br/>
the boys at the end of his work day.  So it has  worked out in a very positive <br/>
way for our family as a whole as well as leading  to lots of interesting <br/>
tangents for the boys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181977712">Right, but my boys are 8 and 4 years old (twins). At that time they were <br/>
about 6 and 2 years old. It is very difficult to reason with two very <br/>
young children.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I find hard to accept about video games is the culture of <br/>
violence. It does not sit right to tell kids not to hit each other and <br/>
to be cooperative when you&#39;re playing Kill Stuff In A Good Story IV? <br/>
Isn&#39;t that a contradiction?<br/>
<br/>
Mind I&#39;m not totally against games. I enjoy them and I have learned a <br/>
lot from some of them. The DS has some good games that I *might* <br/>
consider.  Anything in life can be either good or bad, it is just how <br/>
you use it. I just feel that its my role as a parent to be there and <br/>
help consider good choices. As we have limits on ourselves, so do they.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned is it right to give up something because it causes <br/>
grumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in front of <br/>
them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners.  It&#39;s <br/>
about compromising. That&#39;s a good thing to do with anyone in any <br/>
situation when the boundaries are healthy. :)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s been almost a FULL DAY, and Deb Lewis hasn&#39;t yet commented on <br/>
violence?!  She must be out of town! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be by shortly, I&#39;m sure....<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has a friend who was playing Nintendogs. He had 4-5 dogs, all <br/>
happy and well-cared for. He decided to starve one. He wanted to see <br/>
how far the game would go. He&#39;d feed the other dogs in front of it. It <br/>
would beg and whine. It grew thinner and thinner. Weaker and weaker. <br/>
C-r-a-w-l-i-n-g along the floor. It did anything to get his attention. <br/>
It was so pathetic!<br/>
<br/>
We moms were FREAKING OUT!<br/>
<br/>
Now, Duncan *adores* his Nintendogs. He only keeps as many as he can <br/>
care for and got angry at Cameron&#39;s girlfriend, who played with his DS <br/>
and bought another dog---but then went home after the weekend, leaving <br/>
*her* new dog for Duncan to care for. &quot;Doesn&#39;t she realize that a dog&#39;s <br/>
a big responsibility? That she can&#39;t just *get* one and then forget <br/>
about it?&quot; So he&#39;s *very* attached to and cares a lot about his virtual <br/>
pets.<br/>
<br/>
But he also realizes that these are just pixels.<br/>
<br/>
Now...I don&#39;t really know what a &quot;pixel&quot; IS, but I do know that they <br/>
aren&#39;t real dogs. &lt;g&gt; Nevertheless, the boy who was starving his <br/>
virtual dog had my stomach in a knot.<br/>
<br/>
He was experimenting with the GAME. He would *never* starve his own <br/>
REAL dogs! I guess I *know* that in my mind, but my heart was breaking <br/>
for this starving pup...uh...pixel.<br/>
<br/>
I think many adults have a hard time understanding that these are <br/>
simply games---NO ONE is getting hurt---not a soul! Nor would these <br/>
children purposefully harm anyone IRL. But this a VIRTUAL world. Wild <br/>
and crazy things can be done in a virtual world---things none of these <br/>
children would ever *consider* doing in real life! They can be strong <br/>
super-heroes and super-villains. They can starve sweet, little pups. <br/>
They can save and destroy planets. It&#39;s a GAME! Absolutley NO violence <br/>
is being committed! Absolutely NO damage is being done!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a parent trivializes what a child holds dear or throws away or <br/>
sells a child&#39;s game or denies a child time to play...then REAL damage <br/>
is being done to that child and that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The *parent* has the power over the child and is wielding it to suit <br/>
the parent. A child feels small and powerless. THAT&#39;s real damage! A <br/>
parent that spanks or pops or smacks or paddles or whips a <br/>
child---THAT&#39;s real violence!<br/>
<br/>
What about the children that DO play violent games and then go out and <br/>
shoot up a school?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that those children were loved and accepted for Who They <br/>
Are by everyone close to them? Or do you think they were laughed at and <br/>
ridiculed and coerced and denied and trumped on a regular basis? Do you <br/>
think they were trusted and respected and treasted with kindness and <br/>
patience and generosity? Or do you think their parents wished they <br/>
could fix or change them---or just wish that they were *different*?<br/>
<br/>
Columbine shooters don&#39;t get that way because they were allowed to play <br/>
video games. They get that way because the people who should have loved <br/>
them most didn&#39;t treat them with respect and kindness and accept that <br/>
Who They Are was good enough.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met almost all the kids whose parents write here regularly. Not an <br/>
axe-murderer among them! &lt;G&gt; Gentle, kind, thoughtful kids who love to <br/>
kill and starve pixels. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Using Might over Right will get you short-term results. Using Right <br/>
over Might takes a little longer---more thought, more patience, more <br/>
work!---but it&#39;s a life-long relationship you&#39;re after, right?<br/>
<br/>
Video games don&#39;t cause violent children. But children who are exposed <br/>
to real violence *very* often become violent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>

What limits do you arbitrarily place on yourselves?<br/>
<br/>

grumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in front <br/>
of<br/>
them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners.<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Picking your nose in public is considered bad manners in this society. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether it makes someone grumpy or not. What *YOU* do <br/>
cannot make *ME* grumpy. I get to *choose* how *I* feel about <br/>
everything. *YOU* are not responsible for *MY* feelings.<br/>
<br/>
My mother used to say, &quot;You make me embarrassed when you do ________.&quot; <br/>
Uh....No. I can&#39;t *make* her be embarrassed. *She* gets to make the <br/>
decision whether to be embarrassed or not.<br/>
<br/>
Playing video games doesn&#39;t *make* someone else feel grumpy. There&#39;s <br/>
something *else* going on there. There are other options than simply <br/>
limited gaming time.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would seem that way. But kids *know* the difference between  <br/>
pretend and real.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend is how we play out real life. It&#39;s also how we play out  <br/>
things we *don&#39;t* want to do in real life. It&#39;s a way of exploring  <br/>
what life would be like with different rules. But playing doesn&#39;t  <br/>
make the rules change in real life. Kids *know* that. They *know*  <br/>
they&#39;d have to give up the peaceful, loving home they have to live in  <br/>
a world where people shoot each other. (Kids who are drawn to  <br/>
violence *don&#39;t* have that.) And they find it utterly baffling that  <br/>
*we* are the ones getting fantasy and reality confused!<br/>
<br/>
Please please do read at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
under the headings on the left (video games, TV) and right  <br/>
(Influencing child behavior). It&#39;s a question that comes up a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some specific pages:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/39qde8">http://tinyurl.com/39qde8</a><br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s just so much baggage in between what we&#39;ve been told is right  <br/>
about kids and what happens when kids are treated as whole human  <br/>
beings. Very few people in society know what respected children are  <br/>
like. They only know what controlled (and neglected) children are  <br/>
like. All the advice society hands out is about controlled and  <br/>
neglected children, not respected children. So a lot of what we say  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense. Our advantage is that we *have* respected  <br/>
children so we know how they behave. And since we&#39;ve discussed this  <br/>
so much, because we trust ourselves to see our kids as who they are  <br/>
rather than filtered through society&#39;s vision of them, we know why  <br/>
they&#39;re different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just feel that its my role as a parent to be there and<br/>
&gt; help consider good choices<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As do we. The difference is that we&#39;re here as a resource. We don&#39;t  <br/>
pressure them into a particular choice. We&#39;re there to help them  <br/>
problem solve the consequences. (Quite often doing things  <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; (but really unconventionally!) is a more powerful way to  <br/>
learn than doing things right.)<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that so much of what society fears will cause harm  <br/>
to kids we know from experience just isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
Control and lost (parent) trust has caused much more damage than  <br/>
video games ever will.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As we have limits on ourselves, so do they.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are real limits. (We can&#39;t fly.)<br/>
<br/>
There are limits we *choose* to abide by. (Stop signs and speed limits)<br/>
<br/>
There are limits we *choose* to impose on ourselves. (Just 15 minutes  <br/>
of email before getting dressed.)<br/>
<br/>
But the limits we *choose* to impose on others are in an entirely  <br/>
different category.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t your husband deciding to limit you to 15 minutes of reading a  <br/>
day feel different than the Stop sign at the end of the street?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Someone mentioned is it right to give up something because it causes<br/>
&gt; grumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in  <br/>
&gt; front of<br/>
&gt; them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; about compromising.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big difference is that you make that *choice*. You decide that  <br/>
it&#39;s more important to you to maintain the relationship than to pick  <br/>
your nose.<br/>
<br/>
Deciding for someone else that they need to stop picking their nose  <br/>
is control, not choice. They can say &quot;That&#39;s gross!&quot; You get to  <br/>
decide what to do about it.<br/>
<br/>
Part of  our role is to help our kids see where they&#39;re stepping on  <br/>
others toes while trying to get something they want. (Like trying to  <br/>
get that booger in public ;-) Conventional parenting says we need to  <br/>
make them adhere to the rules. We need to make them &quot;compromise&quot;. (It  <br/>
isn&#39;t a compromise if it&#39;s forced or coerced.)<br/>
<br/>
Our older kids are respectful because they haven&#39;t been made to be  <br/>
respectful. They&#39;re respectful of others because who they are in the  <br/>
right now has been treated with respect.<br/>

I know...I did it, it can be more difficult with limited  communication <br/>
skills and attention span etc.  But that is something that we  have done their <br/>
whole lives, it is just a part of how we live.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another thing I find hard to accept about video  games is the culture of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>violence. It does not sit right to tell kids not  to hit each other and <br/>
to be cooperative when you&#39;re playing Kill Stuff In  A Good Story IV? <br/>
Isn&#39;t that a  contradiction?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I personally don&#39;t tell my kids not to hit.  We work out solutions to  the <br/>
problems at hand.  But that is another topic.  I also have seen my  children <br/>
grow with TV and video games and they are not drawn to things that are  too <br/>
violent or scary for them.  And they do know what is pretend and what  is real.  My <br/>
boys still, at 10 and 13, do not like some of the video games  where you are <br/>
killing &quot;people&quot;, I think it looks too real to them and they just  don&#39;t like <br/>
watching it.  They do like shooting aliens and things  though.  My boys are <br/>
very in tune with their feelings.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just feel that its my role as a parent to be there  and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>help consider good choices. As we have limits on ourselves, so do  they&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I also feel it is my role to help my children when they  want it.  They will <br/>
often ask my opinion.  We talk about video games  and TV a lot.  But I don&#39;t <br/>
choose to limit my children.  They limit  themselves.  I personally just don&#39;t <br/>
feel it is my role to place limits on  another person based on my thoughts and <br/>
feelings (taking theirs into  account).  My feeling is that other people can <br/>
choose to limit themselves  taking my thoughts and feelings into account if <br/>
they wish.  And also I can  choose to limit myself taking other&#39;s thoughts and <br/>
feelings into account.   Just a different way of looking at things I guess. <br/>
