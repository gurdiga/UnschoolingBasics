A Letter to Concerned Relatives<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     My son is just turning 12. I have not been actively pushing him to <br/>
do &quot;schoolwork&quot;, in fact, he hasn&#39;t been doing much of anything. I was <br/>
getting some flack from relatives because he can&#39;t &quot;rattle off&quot; the <br/>
times tables when they fire questions at him. This had me thinking <br/>
about how I could explain &quot;unschooling&quot; to people who have no idea what <br/>
it means. Their main concern (other than the ever popular <br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; question) were that the kids didn&#39;t have &quot;some kind of <br/>
regimented schedule of learning&quot; and that I was keeping them home to <br/>
&quot;shelter&quot; them from &quot;the real world&quot;. Here is a copy of the letter I <br/>
wrote them:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your first concern was that they should have &quot;regimented&quot; schedules for <br/>
learning. A good schedule is one that meets your personal requirements. <br/>
Mike&#39;s (DH) schedule changes weekly to meet his work requirements. My <br/>
children&#39;s schedules change to meet their requirements. There is <br/>
nothing inherently &quot;right&quot; about getting up early or going to bed by <br/>
8pm. Some of our best learning experiences have occurred at night, when <br/>
the kids are laying down listening to me read to them.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of sitting down at a table and reading out of a textbook is a <br/>
misunderstanding of what learning really involves. The tiny bits of <br/>
facts that are generally presented in textbooks are difficult if not <br/>
impossible to apply to everyday life. I am curious what a &quot;sensible <br/>
goal&quot; for curriculum would be in your opinion? My main goal is to raise <br/>
independent, thinking, loving adults with a grasp on the basic skills <br/>
they will need to succeed in life. Just how much of what YOU learned in <br/>
school do you use everyday? Quick, what is the capital of Germany? What <br/>
is the major export of Brazil? Have you ever dissected a frog at work? <br/>
Recite the periodic table of elements in order. What is the symbol for <br/>
Iron? Diagram this sentence and circle the predicate and underline any <br/>
prepositions. Diagram a factor lattice for the number 32. Had enough?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you make learning part of your lifestyle, you are <br/>
learning all the time. We made a weak battery by using foil, salt, and <br/>
baking soda.... to clean the tarnish off my good silver. We experiment <br/>
with chemical reactions every day... it&#39;s called cooking. What makes an <br/>
egg go from a liquid to a solid? Why does cornstarch change the <br/>
physical properties of a white sauce? What makes the holes in bread? <br/>
How does yeast make dough rise? If you have company coming and you have <br/>
to triple your recipe for Pepper Steak, how much soy sauce will you <br/>
need if the original recipe calls for 1/3 cup? If you get $20 for your <br/>
birthday, and your brother has $5 left over from Christmas, and there <br/>
is a toy that you want that costs $35 but is on sale this week for 25% <br/>
off plus tax, if you pool your money, can you buy it? And if you do, <br/>
what fraction of it is really yours, since you paid more for it than <br/>
your brother? :-) Now THAT is practical learning!<br/>
<br/>
Quizzing a child to see if he knows the times tables and can rattle <br/>
them off is not an accurate measurement of that child&#39;s grasp on math. <br/>
I am using a practical, hands on approach to math that give the child a <br/>
grasp of the fundamentals. If they can see units instead of numbers on <br/>
paper, then it is easier to manipulate numbers. I don&#39;t want my <br/>
children to just spout memorized facts, I want them to grasp the <br/>
concepts that make those facts work. For example, yesterday I asked <br/>
Chris to figure 3 times 12. He got it in seconds. I asked him how he <br/>
got the answer so fast, since he has only been working on the times <br/>
tables up to 10. He said &quot;it was easy, you just take 3x10 and add 3x2 <br/>
... duh!&quot; See, it doesn&#39;t matter if he KNOWS the answer by memory, it <br/>
is more important that he knows how to GET the answer! Memorizing math <br/>
facts is only for your own convenience. It has no bearing on your <br/>
understanding of multiplication. I could teach IVY the times tables. <br/>
(she is already learning the 3&#39;s times table from listening to her <br/>
brothers practice) but she obviously would have no idea what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe that my primary reason for homeschooling is to keep my <br/>
kids away from the &quot;big bad world out there,&quot; you are WAY off! I keep <br/>
my kids home because I LIKE THEM HERE! I want to have this time to <br/>
spend with them, I want them to be able to develop close ties with <br/>
their brothers (and sister). I want them to get their values from US, <br/>
not their peers. In case you hadn&#39;t noticed, my children are sweet, <br/>
loving, intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, helpful, and basically <br/>
great kids! Why do I need to send them away for 8 hours a day? What <br/>
will they learn in school that will make such a difference in their <br/>
lives? I can think of many negative things that they would learn there <br/>
that would effect their lives! Hmmm, lets see, there&#39;s sex, drugs, peer <br/>
dependance, bad language, bad attitudes, humiliation, low self-esteem. <br/>
I can&#39;t see how learning any of these things will benefit my children! <br/>
So why send them? What would they get at school that is so valuable <br/>
that they can&#39;t learn it at home? Why not turn that around and ask, <br/>
what can they get at home that they can&#39;t get at school?<br/>
<br/>
Unconditional love, acceptance, support, guidance, values, practical <br/>
life experience, learning how to make a marriage work, how to be a good <br/>
parent, to share, to show compassion, to help others, to make good <br/>
decisions. I would say that the things you get at home are the most <br/>
important. Somehow, a &quot;good job&quot; isn&#39;t going to be much help if your <br/>
marriage is falling apart, is it? What good is a high school diploma if <br/>
you don&#39;t know how to balance a checkbook or do your own grocery <br/>
shopping, or cook your own meals? And if you think school teaches these <br/>
things, you are sadly mistaken! School is an artificial environment, <br/>
nothing there pertains to real life.<br/>
<br/>
No other time in your life will you be in that kind of circumstance <br/>
where you are stuck in a room with people exactly your own age, working <br/>
next to, but not with each other, being told to do things by an <br/>
&quot;authority figure&quot; that have absolutely no bearing on your real life. <br/>
(Ok, maybe prison comes close) It is no wonder that school attendance <br/>
is compulsory, no thinking person would voluntarily go there!<br/>
<br/>
You talk about my kids having to go out and meet the world face to <br/>
face. Well I have news for you.... they LIVE in the real world, it is <br/>
the public school that is the sheltered environment. My kids get &quot;real <br/>
life&quot; experiences every day. They go shopping, they run errands, they <br/>
do housework. How much of what goes on in a classroom is what YOU do <br/>
every day?<br/>
<br/>
There will be no great &quot;shock&quot; for my kids, they are already LIVING in <br/>
the real world. Why would I want to take them and pen them up in an <br/>
institution for 12 years? If you have any specific questions about my <br/>
children&#39;s education, please feel free to ask me. I am quite pleased <br/>
with their progress.<br/>
