As  others have said, a 7 yr old is really NOT ready to handle  sole<br/>
responsibility for that many living creatures - even one bunny as a  pet<br/>
is a LOT of responsibility. As an &quot;assistant&quot;, sure but not as  the<br/>
primary caregiver. If the adults in the household are not willing  to<br/>
handle the majority of it, it needs a major rethinking. Also, why is  it<br/>
that the rabbits &quot;have to&quot; be fed/watered/that the rabbits &quot;have to&quot; be fe<br/>
in the morning? Would it be less of a struggle if the bunny care  could<br/>
happen before lunch (for example)? I&#39;m guessing the rabbits don&#39;t  care -<br/>
they&#39;ll adjust to whatever schedule you set  up.<br/>

Just for some information..rabbits eat more at NIGHT then they do  during the <br/>
day. They tend to nap and be calmer during the light hours and get  more <br/>
active and eat more, etc from  late afternoon to night. <br/>
So taking that into consideration, that might help you with rabbit  care.<br/>
Of course fresh water is always a must. and perhaps some hay to nibble on  <br/>
could be helpful <br/>
