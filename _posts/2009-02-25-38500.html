<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939700857">Hello all! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We here at Great Big Happy Life Headquarters are VERY  excited to announce<br/>
that John Taylor Gatto, an author whose work has greatly influenced the<br/>
minds and hearts of many unschooling and homeschooling families,  will be<br/>
joining us at the Great Big Happy Life Unschoolers Conference Retreat.  His<br/>
talk will be a delicious exploration of what Gatto calls open source<br/>
learning.I imagine we can expect the same level of insight and seriously<br/>
thought-provoking material from his talk as we have been exposed to in his<br/>
writing.  If you have never read his stuff,  you are missing out on some<br/>
amazing ideas! The author of Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of<br/>
Compulsory Schooling (1992); The Exhausted School (1993); A Different Kind<br/>
of Teacher (2000); and The Underground History Of American Education (2001),<br/>
he just released Weapons of Mass Instruction, his latest book. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Gatto&#39;s visit with us is really just a nice surprise for all of us who<br/>
will be attending.It was actually a bit of a surprise to the organizers J.we<br/>
weren&#39;t sure if we could make it happen BUT WE DID!!! <br/>
<br/>
He joins a wonderful and dazzling lineup of presenters which includes Dayna<br/>
Martin, Amy Childs, Erika Davis-Pitre and Cameron Lovejoy among others.Of<br/>
course these folks are the HEART of our gathering and we are just feeling<br/>
like we&#39;ve got an amazing blend of experiences in store for everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are also adding to our participant-led funshop list every day..We&#39;ve got<br/>
balloon rooms, serious paper airplane making, designing your own blue jeans,<br/>
a gaming room, knitting, an ATC funshop and more are being added every week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At the rate we are going, we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we far exceeded our<br/>
original vision for attendance (yippee!)  Don&#39;t delay in purchasing your<br/>
lodging if you have a particular lodging option in mind and you don&#39;t want<br/>
to let it get away..Registration and meal plan deadline is still 3/28 at<br/>
midnight. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
See you all soon!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
